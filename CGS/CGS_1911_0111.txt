OF THE YEAR.

FIELD WORK.

Work during the year has included surveys along the coasts of the United States and outlying Territories, including Alaska, Hawaii, and the Philippines, and triangulation, leveling, gravity, and magnetic work in the interior States and Territories. A reconnoissance for primary triangulation to extend from the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation in the vicinity of Colorado Springs, Colo., to the Canadian boundary was begun in Colorado early in May, and by the end of the fiscal year over 400 miles of progress had been made. Provision was made for connections with triangulation stations of the United States Geological Survey, section comers of the General Land Office, and with monuments of several State boundaries. The line follows approxi~ mately the one hundred and fourth meridian. One party was engaged in primary triangulation, one in reconnoissance for primary triangulation, six in revision of triangulation, one in gravity work, and one in determinations of latitude, longitude, and aziDJuth. The Texas-California arc of the primary triangulation extending from central Texas to the Pacific coast, connecting the ninety-eighth meridian primary triangulation in the vicinity of Weatherford,. Tex., with the Pacific coast triangulation in the vicinity of San Diego, Cat., was completed during the year. It is connected with the United States and Mexican boundary at a number of places and is joined to and correlates a number of detached Government surveys. It furnishes the geographic positions on the United States Standard Datum of more than 200 points which can be used to control future public surveys within the region traversed. Tidal observations have been recorded at a number of permanent stations and at temporary tidal stations maintained in the progress of the field work. Observations of eurrents along the Atlantic coast have been carried on with the cooperation of the Bureau of Lighthouses, and arrangements have been made with the Bureau of Education of the Interior Department and the Revenue-Cutter Service of the Treasury Department by which tidal observations on the coast of Alaska will be obtained at numerous points at a nominal cost to the Government. . Exchange of data with the United States Engineers, the Bureau of Lighthouses, the Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department, the General Land Office, the Geological Survey, and the Isthmian Canal Commission, has been continued as heretofore. The collection of information for the Coast Pilot and for the correction and revision of charts on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and in Alaska, Ha~aii, and the Philippines has been continued. A number of parties have been engaged in making magnetic observations at numerous points in the United States, in Alaska, Porto Rico, and Hawaii, and magnetic observations have been made on vessels of the Survey at sea whenever practicable.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 191x.

Work at the latitude observatories at Gaithersburg, Md., and Ukiah, Cal., maintained by the International Geodetic Association, has been continued, under the direction of the Superintendent, and the results have been transmitted to the association. A zenith tube designed by Dr. F. E. Ross for the determination of the latitude variation by a photographic method has been installed at Gaithersburg. This undertaking was rendered possible by a special grant from the International Geodetic Association. An officer of the Survey has served as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, in addition to other duties, and another has been continuously employed in cooperation with the Maryland State Board of Shell Fish Commissioners. This officer was also authorized to supervise the survey of certain portions of the oyster beds in the State of Delaware, without expense to the Government. Assistance was rendered by furnishing points, location of stakes, etc., to the Fish Commission of the State of North Carolina and points were determined by triangulation for use in the survey of the oyster beds of the States of Alabama and Mississippi. Latitude, telegraphic longitude, and an azimuth were determined at Fairbanks and Tanana, Alaska, at the request of the United States Geological Survey. The latitude and longitude of a point in the grounds of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City were also detennined. On the Atlantic coast hydrographic surveys were made on the coast of Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and Florida, and field work for the Coast Pilot has covered the coast from Maine to Rhode Island. Four vessels and one land party were employed in the work, as follows: Steamer Bache: Hydrography of Nantucket Shoals, examination of Five Fathom Bank off Cape May, triangulation and hydrography near Key West, search for a reported shoal near Rebecca Shoal Lighthouse and for another shoal reported near Marquesas Rock Buoy; incidentally, the position of the steamer Luckenbach while stranded on New Ground Shoal and the position of the wreck of the schooner Hannah M. Bell on Elbow Reef were determined. Steamer Endeavor: Hydrographic surveys in Buzzards Bay, Mass., assisting the steamer Bache in determining the positions of buoys for use in the survey of Nantucket Shoals, hydrography of Chesapeake Bay between Smith Point and Cherrystone Light, and determination of the positions of lights and beacons in Mobjack Bay, Va. Schooner Matchless: Revision of the hydrography of the James River from the vicinity of Newport News and the triangulation and topography from Jamestown Island to Petersburg and Richmond, Va., and revision of the hydrography, triangulation, and topography of the York River. Steamer Hydrographer: Engaged in Coast Pilot examinations along the coast from Calais, Me., to Point Judith, R. I., for the field revision of the Atlantic Coast Pilots, Parts I-II, and III. Wire-drag work was done on the coast of Maine in Penobscot Bay, and in Long Island Sound south of Clinton, Conn. Improvements have been made in the mechanical appliances used in connection with the wire drag, permitting the increase in the length of the drag to any desired extent, and enabling a larger area to be covered in a less time than heretofore.

On the Pacific coast general surveys were made on the coast of Alaska by six vessels of the Survey during the season available for work. During the intervening time one of these vessels was employed on the coast of California, two on the coast of Washington, and one in the Hawaiian Islands, as follows: Steamer Explorer: Triangulation, topography, and hydrography of Bristol Bay, Alaska, examination of the mouth of the Kuskokwim River, hydrography and topography of the island of Oahu, Hawaii, completed. Steamer Patterson: Triangulation, topography, and hydrography in Cook Inlet, Alaska; offshore hydrography of the coast of California between Bodega Head and Cape Arena, and of the coast northward of San Francisco; general surveys on the coast of Alaska in the vicinity of Dolgoi Island. Steamer Gedney: Survey of Tongass Narrows, southeast Alaska, and of Wrangell Strait; topography and hydrography at the head of Portland Canal; chart revision work in Puget Sound; and survey of the entrance to Willapa Bay, Wash. Steamer McArthur: Survey of Cook Inlet, Alaska, north of the Forelands; survey of Grays Harbor, Wash.; examination of Perouse Glacier and Icy Bay, Alaska, and additional hydrography in Katalla Bay. Steamer Taku: Survey of shores of Knights Island, and of Prince of Wales Passage, and Bainbridge Passage, Alaska; location of aids to navigation in Cordova Bay. Steamer Yukon: Surveys on east shore of Cooks Inlet, Alaska, south of the Forelands. Five parties were engaged in the field revision of charts in various localities on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Magnetic observations were made at the regular observatories at Cheltenham, Md., Tucson, Ariz., Honolulu, Hawaii, Sitka, Alaska, and Vieques, P. R., and the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were determined by field observers at about 350 stations on land and in 24 localities at sea by the vessels of the Survey. Self-registering tide gauges were maintained at Portland, Me., Fort Hamilton, N. Y., Philadelphia, Pa., Baltimore, Md., Wilmington, N. C., Fernandina, Fla., Weeks, La., Galveston, Tex., San Diego, Cal., San Francisco, Cal., Seattle, Wash. The tide indicators at Fort Hamilton, N. Y., Reedy Island, Del., and the electrical tidal indicators in the rooms of the Maritime Association and at the Seaman's Friend Society's Institute in New York City have continued in operation.
HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.

A complete survey of the island of Oahu has been made and data collected for the Coast Pilot of the Hawaiian Islands. Through the courtesy of the surveyor general of Hawaii, the Coast and Geodetic Survey is furnished with records of tide observations made by the Territorial government. A magnetic observatory is maintained by the Coast and Geodetic Survey at Honolulu.
PORTO RICO.

A permanent magnetic observatory is maintained by the Coast and Geodetic Survey at Vieques, P. R. No surveying work was done in Porto Rico during the year.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19u.
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

In the Philippines surveys have been conducted by the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Pathfinder and the insular government steamers Fathomer, Marinduque, Romhlon, and Research, and by parties living on shore. Surveys have been made of the following localities: Northeast coast of Mindanao and adjacent islands; Mindoro, Panay, Masbate, Luzon, Semirara Group, and Tablas; Mindanao Sea, central and western parts; Jolo Harbor and approaches; southwestern coast of Mindanao, Basilan Strait; south coast of Luzon, Burias, and Masbate Islands; southeast coast of Cebu; north coast of Mindanao; and north coast of Leyte. The field work in the Philippines completed to June 30, 191 1, is estimated to cover 5i.3 per cent of the whole coast line of the islands. At the office in Manila the records received from the field parties have been examined, reduced, and checked wherever necessary, duplicates prepared, results of triangulation adjusted, and elevations computed. Progress has been made in the preparation and compilation of results and sketches for the publication of the Luzon triangulation. The usual studies have been made for each proposed piece of field work from all available sources of information; notes, specifications, and instructions for field parties have been prepared and general supervision exercised over the technical details of the field operations. · Requests for data needed in surveys by the Army have been filled, in addition to other calls for information. Finished tracings have been made for chart publications, hydrographic sheets plotted and completed, and topographic sheets inked and completed when necessary. Sailing directions and notices to mariners for the Philippines have been prepared and a large amount of original hydrographic information has been received and filed. Lights and buoys on the charts have been colored and hand corrections to the charts made when required. The Survey has a representative on the lighthouse board of the Philippine Government. Progress has been made in the compilation by the geographic division of a general map of the Philippines.
INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARIES.

Progress made in the survey and marking of the boundary line between the United States and Canada and on the one hundred and forty-first meridian boundary between Alaska and the British possessions, which is conducted under the direction of the Superintendent as Commissioner on the part of the United States, may be briefly stated as follows: The party working on the northeastern boundary between Maine and New Brunswick in the valleys of the St. John and St. Francis Rivers, conjointly with a Canadian party, carried the triangulation and topography from the vicinity of Edmundston, New Brunswick, to the head of Cross Lake, on the St. Francis River, a distance of about 50 miles; and 18 boundary monuments were erected and determined in position by triangulation. Work was resumed in the spring of 1911. The party, also working in conjunction with a Canadian party on the St. Croix River, began work in the neighborhood of Calais, Me., from which point the triangulation, topography, and traverse line measurement were carried to the vicinity of Vanceboro. From Woodland, Me., to the mouth of the river the survey is entirely completed.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

Work was resumed in the neighborhood of Woodland in the spring of 191 l and was in progress at the close of the year. The party engaged on the survey of the boundary line from Pigeon River westward toward the Lake of the Woods carried the triangulation from South Fowl Lake to the west end of Rose or Mud Lake. The topography of the boundary lakes and connecting waterways between the same limits was completed, with the exception of Rose Lake. During the season of I9IO the parties working on the northwestern boundary along the forty-ninth parallel east of the Rocky Mountains completed I3I linear miles of triangulation from a little east of the north fork of Milk to the Middle Branch of Poplar River. Two base lines were measured, azimuth determined, and connection made with the triangulation. In the spring of I911 work was resumed and by the close of the year about 40 miles of triangulation had been completed and the reconnaissance carried IO miles farther. Eighty-five monuments were set in the season of I 910, and about 30 miles monumented in May and June, I 91 I. During the same period the topography was carried along the boundary for I3I miles and l6I miles of levels were run. Work was resumed in the spring of I9II and was in progress at the date of this report. Work on the por~ion of the Northwestern boundary from a point at or near Short Creek, a tributary of the Souris or Mouse River, to the eastward, wascontinued during the season of I910 by a Canadian party, accompanied by a field officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey as American representative. The triangulatfon and topography of the boundary were carried from Short Creek eastward to monument No. 170, nearly at the eastern terminus of Turtle Mountain, a distance of l 36.4 miles, but no monuments were set east of I72. In all, 94 monuments were set. In April, I9l I, the party again took the field for the identification and establishment of monuments from the vicinity of Bannerman, Mont., eastward. The party engaged in the survey of the Alaska boundary at the head of the Big Salmon River ran a line of precise levels from Skagway to the summit of White Pass; connected the triangulation at the head of the Big Salmon River with that at the head of Glacier Bay, strengthened the location of certain boundary peaks and extended the topography over the region at the head of Muir Glacier. A Canadian party, accompanied by a field officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey representing the United States Commissioner, was engaged at the beginning of the year in marking the Alaska-Canada boundary at the head of Portland Canal. Work during the season included the recovery of old triangulation necessary for the establishment of monuments and the erection of the monuments and their connection with the triangulation reference marks. Work on the survey and marking of the boundary line along the one hundred and forty-first meridian between Alaska and Canada was continued during the season of I910· The demarcation of the boundary line (one hundred and forty-first meridian) was extended from a point about 40 miles north of the Yukon River, where work closed in . I909, to a point IO miles beyond the Rampart House, a distance of 155 miles. The line projection was in direct charge of a Canadian surveyor, with an assistant surveyor representing the chief of the American party. The line cutting and monumenting were done by a Canadian party. A vista 20 feet wide was cleared through the timber and small aluminum bronze monuments were erected at intervisible points not more than 4 miles apart. The monuments were connected with the triangulation. In all, 62 miles of vista were cut and stadia line run, and 20 monuments placed. Magnetic declination was observed at I 5 stations.

A Canadian party accompanied by an American surveyor was engaged in line cutting and monumenting south of Sixty Mile River, completing the work not previously done from the Yukon River to Mount Natazhat Ridge.
COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE.

The work of the office includes, besides the executive and accounting departments, the reduction and plotting of results obtained in the field and the preparation of these results for publication in the form of charts, Coast Pilots, tide tables, notices to mariners, reports, and special publications. These operations include computing, drawing, en· graving, lithographing, photographing, electrotyping, and chart printing, as well as the distribution and sale of the charts, Coast Pilots, and tide tables. Instruments required for the use of :field parties are repaired and in some cases constructed in the office, which has a complete equipment for mechanical work. Good progress has been made in all branches of the work, although the force employed is not sufficient for the most efficient and economical administration, in view of the increasing volume of work and the constant growing demand for the results of the Survey. Increases made in the compensation of the computers, engravers, and mechanicians, and in the lower grades of clerks, and of certain other employees have been of considerable benefit to the efficiency of the personnel in enabling the Survey to retain employees who would otherwise have sought advancement by transfer to other departments or in private employment. A large amount of time and labor were devoted to answering calls for information from the President's Commission on Efficiency and Economy and the preparation of data called for by Congress. Improvements in methods and processes have been made in many branches of the work, tending to increased output and improved quality of results. The appropriation for the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the :fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, was $1,005,120, divided as follows:

Total .............................................·...·..... GENERAL REMARKS.

The exacting demands of modern navigation, due to increased traffic, larger size and draft of vessels, and the improvement of channels and harbors, require a corresponding extension of the surveys required to keep the charts up to date. A new chart may require extensive corrections soon after it is issued, and when the number of corrections becomes very great, a new edition becomes necessary. Surveys must be made at frequent intervals to keep pace with changes due to natural causes, to artificial improvements, changes in lights and buoys, and newly discovered rocks and shoals. Many waterways formerly but little frequented are now extensively used, and the great development of motor boating, has caused an extensive demand for accurate charts of the inland waterways and shallower waters along the coast. Data concerning

tides and currents and the deflection of the compass needle are necessary for the use of the navigator and are embodied for his use on the charts and in the Coast Pilots and Tide Tables and in other publications. The positions of lighthouses and other aids to navigation must be accurately determined, and finally important channels and harbors must be carefully gone over with the wire drag to make certain that no hidden dangers have been overlooked by the ordinary methods of surveying. · While the whole of the Atlantic coast artd the greater part of the Pacific coast of the main portion of the United States have been covered by detailed surveys, resurveys are constantly needed and will always be needed to furnish information required by changed conditions. Demands are constantly made for new surveys of harbors on the coast of Alaska, as the development of that territory is largely dependent on accurate surveys of the coast and waterways. To meet this need all the vessels of the Survey on the Pacific coast have been employed on that coast during the season available for work. Attention is again called to the importance of providing means for carrying a scheme of triangulation down the valley of the Yukon River from the international boundary to the mouth of the river as a basis for economic surveys in Alaska.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, VESSELS AND THEIR WORK.

1911.

Steamer "Bache."-On July 1 the Bache was at Boston undergoing repairs, on the completion of which on July 14, hydrographic work on Nantucket Shoals was begun and continued until October 20. Some minor repairs were made at Boston, and on November 9 the vessel sailed for Lewes, Del., arriving there on the 11th. An examination of Five Fathom Bank, off Cape May, N. J., was taken up and continued until December 22, when the Bache proceeded to Baltimore to take in stores and equipment for the winter's work. The vessel left Baltimore for Hampton Roads on January 8 with instructions to make an examination of the shoals off Cape Charles, Va., but, owing to unfavorable weather, this work was abandoned, and the steamer sailed from Norfolk for Key West on January 24, arriving February 2. From that date until the end of June the party was engaged in the extension of the triangulation from the vicinity of Key West to Rebecca Shoal Lighthouse and northward to New Ground Shoal and the revision of the hydrography through Boca Grande Channel and westward to New Ground Shoal. Steamer "Endeavor."-The Endeavor was engaged in hydrographic work in Buzzards Bay, Mass., which work was suspended from July 19 to August 2 in order that the vessel and party might cooperate in the work of the steamer Bache in determining the positions of buoys on Nantucket Shoals. Leaving Buzzards Bay August 15 the vessel arrived at Baltimore on the 22d. After taking in supplies the Endeavor left Baltimore September 2 for her working ground in the lower Chesapeake, where she took up the revision of the hydrography of Chesapeake Bay between Smiths Point and Cherrystone Light and afterwards in Mobjack Bay. Work was still in progress at the close of the year. Schooner "Matchless."-This vessel was engaged first in the revision of the surveys of the James River until April 1 and of York River from April 10. On June 13 she proceeded to Baltimore for repairs, which were in progress at the close of the year.
WIRE-DRAG WORK.

Wire-drag work was prosecuted on the coast of Maine at Tennants Harbor and in Penobscot Bay and in Long Island Sound south of Clinton, Conn. A large number of new reefs and shoals were discovered and least water found on many known reefs.
CHART REVISION.

Chart-revision work was done along the eastern coast of Virginia from Wachapreague Inlet to Cape Charles. The revision of the triangulation and topography was completed and the hydrographic revision is well advanced. Revision of surveys for chart correction was done on the north shore of Long Island and in Greater New York. Chart-revision work was done on the coast of Massachusetts from Gloucester to Plum Island; in North Landing River, N. C., including incidental triangulation; and on the coast of Maine from Cape Neddick Roads to York. Revision work was done on Delaware Bay and in the location of buoys and stakes in Albemarle and Croatan Sounds in aid of the North Carolina Fish Commission. The steamer Hydrographer was engaged during the summer of 1910 in the field revision of Coast Pilots, Parts I-II and III. The work covered the coast from Calais,

Me., to Point Judith, R. I. Work closed October 31, and the vessel returned to Baltimore November 9, where she was docked and some small repairs made. She was laid up for the remainder of the year. The schooner Transit has been laid up near Morgan City, La., during the entire year.
PACIFIC COAST.

Steamer "Explorer."-This vessel was engaged in the survey of Bristol Bay, Alaska, and afterwards made an examination of the entrance to tl~e Kuskokwim River. On the completion of this work the vessel sailed October 5 for the Hawaiian Islands and took up the survey of the island of Oahu, which was completed on February 20. Sailing from Honolulu on February 28, the Explorer arrived at San Francisco on March 13. Arrangements were made at once for extensive repairs needed to the vessel, and this work was in progress at the end of the year. Steamer "Patterson."-The steamer Patterson was employed during the summer on surveys in Cook Inlet,. Alaska, and afterwards upon hydrography off the coast of California. She sailed from her working ground in Alaska for San Francisco October 3, arriving October 22. The vessel was undergoing repairs from November 24 to January 13, when she took up the hydrographic work off the coast of California, which was continued until March 15. The vessel was under repair from March 20 to about April 15. She sailed for Seattle April 20, making soundings on the way off the coast of Oregon. Arriving at Seattle April 28, she sailed May 4 for Unalaska, was at Ketchikan May l x and 12, and arrived at the working ground near Dolgoi Island on May 18. Surveys were begun at once in that locality and continued to the close of the year. Steamer "Gedney."-The Gedney was engaged in surveys in southeastern Alaska at Tongass Narrows; at the head of Portland Canal; and in Wrangell Strait. Closing this work October 15, the vessel sailed for Seattle, arriving October 29. She was afterwards employed upon chart-revision work in Puget Sound and the survey of Willapa Bay, Wash. The Gedney was undergoing repairs from March 15 to May 23, after which the work at Willapa Bay was taken up and continued to the close of the year. Steamer "McArthur."-This vessel was engaged upon surveys in Cook Inlet, Alaska, until September .28. She sailed for Seattle October 3, arriving October 21. The vessel was then repaired. On November 25 she sailed for Grays Harbor, Wash., arriving November 29. The survey of that harbor was continued until March 13, and on the 17th the vessel sailed for Seattle. Repairs were in progress between April 5 and 29. On May 12 the McArthur sailed for Cook Inlet, Alaska, stopping on the way to make examinations at La Perouse Glacier, Icy Bay, and Katalla Bay. The vessel reached Seldovia June 2. Work in Cook Inlet was in progress at the close of the year. Steamer "Taku."-The steamer Taku was employed during the summer of 1910 in the survey of the shores of Knight Island and of Prince of Wales Passage and Bainbridge Passage, Alaska. Several aids to navigation were also located in Cordova Bay. Work closed September 23, and the Taku was laid up. On June 15 work was resumed in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and continued to the close of the year. Steamer "Yukon."-The steamer Yukon was engaged at the beginning of the fiscal year in the survey of the east shore of Cook Inlet, south of the Forelands. Work closed September 15, 1910. Work was resumed in Cook Inlet on June 5, 19ll, and was in progress at the end the year. ·

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19u.

An officer of the Survey was engaged upon chart-revision work in southern California and in San Pablo Bay until April, i91 x. The revision of the surveys of the Hawaiian Islands, and especially on the island of Oahu, was carried on by a shore party, acting during the latter portion of the time under the general supervision of the commanding officer of the steamer Explorer.
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

The details of the work in the Philippine Islands are contained in the report of the Director of Coast Surveys· at Manila, under whose immediate supervision all work in those islands is carried on. INSPECTOR OF GEODETIC WORK.
WM. Bowm, Inspector.

The duties of the Inspector were performed at the Office in Washington by correspondence with field parties and by examination of records, computations, and reports. - The most important event of the year in this branch of the Survey is the completion of the Texas-California arc of primary triangulation, which extends from central Texas to the Pacific coast. It connects the ninety-eighth meridian primary triangulation in the vicinity of Weatherford, Tex., with the Pacific coast primary triangulation in the vicinity of San Diego, Cal. It is connected with the United States and Mexican boundary at a number of places and is joined to and correlates a number of detached Government surveys. It furnishes the geographic positions on the United States Standard Datum of more than 200 points, which can be used to control all future public surveys within the region traversed. There are 92 primary stations in the main scheme of this triangulation, and in addition 38 stations in secondary schemes, which provide for the connections with the United ·States-Mexican boundary monuments and existing triangulation. The total area covered by the triangulation is 48 400 square miles, the average length of line east of El Paso being 17 miles, and thence to the Pacific coast 62 miles. The maximum length of line is about 121 miles. Two primary bases were measured and 24 primary azimuths were observed. The total work was done in less than three years and six months, and the observations in less than two years and four months. The remarkable rapidity and low cost of this work were due to the small amount of camp equipage used by each unit of the party, the economical organization of the parties, and to generally favorable conditions of weather. Gravity work was continued throughout the year, and the intensity of the force of gravitation was determined at 24 new stations, and 3 old stations were reoccupied. The line of precise levels between Fort Worth and El Paso, Tex., was completed during the fiscal year. The line of precise leveling between El Reno, Okla., and Jericho, Tex., was extended 59 miles beyond the latter place in June, 19n. In all, 520 miles of precise leveling was done during the fiscal year. An error of 1 meter was discovered near Sherman, Wyo., in the field work of the large loop of leveling extending from Crawford, Nebr., to Pocatello, Idaho; Butte, Mont.; Huntley, Mont.; and thence back to Crawford. Another error of 1 meter had been found between Pocatello and Butte in June, 1910. The closing error of this loop is now

well within the desired limit. The necessary corrections will be made in the published results. Latitude, telegraphic longitude, and an azimuth were determined at Fairbanks and Tanana, Alaska, at the request of the United States Geological Survey. The latitude and telegraphic longitude of a point in the grounds of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City were determined in June, 1911. Excellent progress was made in revising the triangulation of the Gulf coast; in the Delaware River the geographic positions of certain aids to navigation were trigonometrically determined; and in North Carolina a party was engaged in connecting the triangulation of the Neuse River, by the United States engineers, with that of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The revision of the old triangulation on the coast of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, between Cape Henlopen and Cape Charles, was finished during the fiscal vear. In co~nection with the revision, a base line 3,566 meters in length was measured at Metompkin Island, Va. A reconnoissance for primary triangulation, to extend from the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation in the vicinity of Colorado Springs, Colo., to the Canadian boundary, was begun at the southern end early in May. By the end of the fiscal year over 400 miles of progress had been made. Provision was made for connections with triangulation stations of the United States Geological Survey, section comers of the General Land Office, and with monuments of several State boundaries. The line follows approximately the one hundred and fourth meridian. Three appendixes to the Annual Report for l 910, viz: Primary Base Lines at Stanton, Tex., and Deming, N. Mex.; Triangulation in California, Part II; and The Measurement of the Flexure of Pendulum Supports with the Interferometer, were prepared and published during the year. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF MAGNETIC WORK.
R. L.
FARIS,

Inspector.

The duties of this Office are the planning of magnetic work to be done in the United States and their outlying territories; the inspection of the magnetic work in the field and at the magnetic observatories; to recommend changes in the personnel and salaries of magnetic observers; recommend the construction or purchase of new magnetic instruments, or alterations of old ones when needed; recommend changes in design of instruments or methods of observing to obtain better results or saving of time; and to supervise the planning and construction of buildings for magnetic observatories. It was not necessary to make any inspection trips into the field or to any of the magnetic observatories during the year, except in the case of the Cheltenham Observatory, which was twice personally inspected. All other inspection work was perfordme at the Office by examination of the reports and records from chiefs of magnetic parties and others engaged in magnetic work, and by correspondence. The magnetic observatories at Cheltenham, Md.; Tucson, Ariz.; Honolulu, Hawaii; Sitka, Alaska; and Vieques, P.R., were in operation throughout the year. In addition to the magnetic observations, seismographs were kept in operation and meteorological observations made at all of the observatories.

A reconnoissance for primary triangulation, to extend from the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation in the vicinity of Colorado Springs, Colo., to the Canadian boundary, was begun at the southern end early in May. By the end of the fiscal year over 400 miles of progress had been made. Provision was made for connections with triangulation stations of the United States Geological Survey, section comers of the General Land Office, and with monuments of several State boundaries. The line follows approximately the one hundred and fourth meridian. Stations Pikes Peak-Bison were selected as a base, with Divide as third point, in starting from the transcontinental triangulation. By June 30 the reconnoissance had been extended to the forty-fifth parallel of latitude, and 29 primary points had been located.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19n.

In Buzzards Bay tide stations were established at Mattapoisett and West Falmouth and referred to the old station at Clarks Point by simultaneous observations. The necessary hydrographic signals were erected at old triangulation stations or at new stations established for the purpose, a number of selected areas were examined by sounding, and the data needed for a revision of the charts of this region were obtained. After completing the work in Buzzards Bay the vessel proceeded to Chesapeake Bay and resumed hydrographic work in the vicinity of Tangier Island. . Several selected areas between Smith Point and Cherrystone Light were examined by sounding. The work continued until September 7, when it was suspended for three days to determine the position of aids to navigation in Mobjack Bay. The work in the open bay continued until December 7, when the hydrographic revision of Mobjack Bay was begun. This work was completed on March 22, and the vessel proceeded to Baltimore to be repaired. On May 10 the vessel resumed work in Chesapeake Bay, and it was continued during the rest of the fiscal year. Assistant Boutelle reports that the officers of the ship "all worked faithfully and diligently."

The elevations of 18 bench marks established by the United States Geological Survey and the United States Reclamation Service were determined. The elevations of seven triangulation stations were also determined. The heat was excessive during the summer months and rod thermometers showed a temperature of 127° F. The work was completed on January IO, 191 I. From April IO to May 9 Assistant Cade was engaged in determining the geographic positions of aids to navigation on Delaware River. Several triangulation stations previously established by the Corps of Engineers, United States Army, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey were recovered and used for this purpose. The work was suspended on May 9 and preparations were made to resume leveling work in Texas. This work began at Jericho, Tex., on June l and was continued until the end of the fiscal year. The route followed the Chicago, Rock Island & Gulf Railway to Amarillo, and thence along the Pecos & Northern Texas (Santa Fe) Railroad toward Albuquerque.

On July 1 the party on the schooner Matchless was engaged in the revision of the triangulation, topography, and hydrography of the James River. The hydrography was revised from the vicinity of Newport News and the topography and triangulation from Jamestown Island to Petersburg and Richmond. A topographical and hydrographic survey of the Appomattox River was made extending from City Point to the head of navigation at Petersburg. On April 10 the revision of the surveys of the York River was begun, and this work was continued until June 12, when the vessel was taken to Baltimore for repairs. The triangulation of this river was carried from Yorktown to near Moodys Old Wharf, a distance of 16 miles; the topography was completed to Biglers Mill, a distance of zo miles, and the hydrography from the mouth of the river to Kings Creek 5 miles above Yorktown, a distance of 13 miles. Current, tidal, and magnetic observations were made at a number of stations while the surveys were in progress.

SUMMARY oF &nsULTS.-1 805 square statute miles covered by triangulation, 319 geographic positions determined, 91 signal poles and I I scaffold signals erected, and 85 stations occupied for horizontal measures. Total length of triangulation measured along its central axis, 150 statute miles.

The revision of the triangulation of Mississippi Sound, executed between September and January 8, 1911, was undertaken for the purpose of recovering a sufficient number of old stations or determining the positions of a sufficient number of new points for use in future topographic and hydrographic surveys, for determining changes in shore line since the last surveys, determining and verifying the positions of aids to navigation and of prominent landmarks for use on the charts, and to supply points for use in the oyster survey of Mississippi Sound and a portion of Mobile Bay. Notes giving details as to changes in shore line, in aids to navigation, and other matters useful for the correction of the charts were turned in by the chief of party at the close of the season. The auxiliary power schooner Cincinnati was used for the transportation of the party. The revision of triangulation on the coast of Texas between Matagorda and Aransas Pass Lights was executed between March 29 and May 30. No marked changes in the shore line were discovered except at Gr!iSS Island in San Antonio Bay on the point on the south side of the mouth of the Aransas River. Positions of aids to navigation were determined, discrepancies noted, and prominent land marks located for use on the charts.

[H. C. GRAVSS, Commanding the Steamer Hydrographer.]

On July l and from that date until November 15 the Coast Pilot party was engaged in field work on the steamer Hydrographer for the revision of United States Coast Pilots, Parts I-II and III, from the northeast boundary of Maine to Point Judith. Passamaquoddy Bay and tributaries were completed by July 26 ~nd work was afterwards taken up along the coast between Eastport and Bar Harbor; Bar Harbor and Rockland; Rockland and Portland; Portland and Boston·; and Boston and Point Judith. Many uncharted rocks were located and their positions determined for use on the charts. A hydrographic examination was made in Broad Sound northward of The Graves Lighthouse on the coast of Massachusetts where dangerous shoals were reported, but no marked shoaling was found except as shown on the charts. Localities were also examined where the hydrography is changing from the action of the sea, notably at Pollock Rip Slue and parts of Nantucket and Vineyard Sounds.

SUMMARY
OF

RESVI.TS.-Length of line of leveling revised, 441 kilometers.

Revision of the line of precise levels between Pocatello, Idaho, and Butte, Mont., which was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year, was continued from Monida to Huntley, Mont., until September 7. Some steep grades were encountered in the vicinity of Apex and again at Feeley, which made progress slow at those points. At Butte direct connection was made with the line from Pocatello to Butte. From Whitehall to Bozeman the line runs through nearly level country and over this section rapid progress was made, the I Is miles of line from Livingston to Billings being leveled over in a period of two weeks. Work was afterwards continued on this line by another officer.
CONNE;CTICU'r, MAINE:, AND NE;W YORK.

(N'. H. HECK.)

SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Triangulation: 286 square miles covered by triangulation, zosignals erected, 34 stations occupied for horizontal measures, 47 geographic positions determined. Topography: 9Y, square miles covered by topography, 26 miles of general coast line run, 26 miles shore line of rivers completed, 5 topographic sheets revised. Hydrography: 109 square miles of area covered with wire drag, 742 miles run while dragging, 453 soundings made, 4 tidal stations established and 2 reoccupied, 4 hydrographic sheets finished.

On July I a wire-drag party was at work on the coast of Maine and work was continuously prosecuted until the close of the season on November 23. The entire season's work with the exception of the last month was on the open coast, and included the approaches to West and East Penobscot Bays from Burnt Island to Isle au Haut. An area of 106 square miles was dragged and 308 soundings were taken, about 80 per cent of which represent new shoals or important reductions of depth on charted shoals. During the season great advances were made in the mechanical equipment used in operating the drag, resulting in a decrease in the size of the party and a greatly increased output of work. Small gasoline launches of 2 to 3 horsepower were installed, taking the place of manual labor for all heavy work, such as taking up and setting out tne drag, hoisting the anchors, and lifting lobster pots. The resulting decrease in the size of the party saved the cost of installation. As the length of the drag can now be increased up to 12 ooo feet if necessary, the output of work is much greater, and as much as 9 square miles have been covered in a day with only moderately favorable conditions of weather. In removing the drag from shoals, an operation which formerly required a great deal of time, the use of power has effected a considerable saving. It is also possible to use a greater drag length in examining shoals; with the longer drag the length of the towline is increased to increase the length of the towline base. The shape of the buoys has been modified to reduce resistance and prevent damage from contact with the boats. A more complete signal code has been developed, and a simple means adopted for indicating on the hydrographic sheet the effective depths obtained. On January 9 the revision of the topography of the Hudson River between Yonkers and New York was taken up, including the west shore from a point opposite Yonkers to Jersey City, and the east shore from Yonkers to One hundred and twenty-fifth Street,

New York. In this area many changes were found and a large area of land made by filling, and many new wharves were added to the charts. On April 1 work was resumed on the coast of Maine in West and East Penobscot Bay with the wire drag and was in progress at the close of the year. On June 10 the party was divided in order that an examination might be made with the wire drag of a portion of Long Island Sound, where a shoal had been reported. The nonexistence of the shoal at the point indicated was proved, but an extensive area with uncharted depths of 5 to 6 fathoms was developed. An area of 3~ square miles was dragged and 13 soundings of uncharted depths were taken. In addition to the above work, triangulation was done on the coast of Maine to determine stations and objects useful to navigation. A number of tidal bench marks were recovered and established.

square miles of area covered, 2x primary stations 12 azimuth stations occupied.

The primary triangulation in the scheme between Texas and southern California, the reconnaissance for which was made in 1907-8, was in progress at the beginning of the year, the party having taken the field in June, and by February 24, 1911, the entire work remaining to be done in New Mexico, Arizona, and southern California had been completed. Progress made during the season covered about 600 miles between Deming, N. Mex., and Needles, Cal. A connection was made at the western end of the arc with the 1898 primary triangulation of southern California at the stations San Jacinto, Cuyamaca, and Santiago. The work was carefully planned in advance so as to take advantage of the most favorable conditions for observing and for the transportation of the party, the higher peaks being necessarily occupied during the summer months. Work was begun at the western end of the scheme where the weather conditions were more favorable, and when observations there were complete observations were taken up on the high peaks at the eastern end, near Deming, N. Mex. Observations on the high peaks were completed before the winter storms set in, and rapid progress was made on the remainder of the work. The triangulation was connected at numerous points with that of the United States Geological Survey; of the United States-Mexican boundary survey; with the Coast and Geodetic Survey primary coast triangulation in southern California; and with the California-Nevada boundary survey. Level connections (by vertical angle measurements) were made with stations of the United States Geological Survey, United States and Mexican boundary survey, and with a bench mark of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at Needles, Cal. Azimuth observations were made at 12 of the regular triangulation stations. In May work was begun in preparing stations, building signals, and opening lines of sight for the extension of the primary triangulation along the coast of Washington from Columbia River to Grays Harbor and from Grays Harbor to Tacoma. By July 1 this work was well advanced.

[W. C. HODGKINS, Commanding Steamer Bache.] SUMMARY OF RESUL'l'S.-Triangulation: 225 square miles of area covered, 21 signal poles erected, 6 observing tripods and scaffolds built, 19 stations occupied for horizontal measures, 20 geographical positions determined. Magnetic work: 3 land stations occupied, 7 stations at sea occupied. Topography: 16.5 miles of.coast line surveyed, 1 topographical sheet completed. Hydrography: 2 249 square miles of area sounded, 5 570.89 miles run while sounding, 69 752 soundings, 9 665 angles measured, 4 tidal stations established, 3 current stations occupied, 4 hydrographic sheets completed.

Work on the hydrography of Nantucket Shoals was begun soon after the middle of July, the lighthouse tender Azalea and the steamer Endeavor with observers on shore cooperating in the location of buoys in positions convenient for the hydrography. A scheme of triangulation was carried from Sankaty Head and Monomoy Lighthouses across the shoals and the positions of the five buoys and also of the Nantucket Lightship were determined. The steamers Endeavor, Bache, and Azalea took up their positions for the triangulation, returning to their regular stations when the principal part of the work was completed, while the Bache was occupied for about 10 days longer in determining the first position of that vessel, the delay being due to the difficulty of seeing Sankaty Head from the ship. Hydrographic work on the shoals was then taken up and continued as weather permitted until October 20. The results of the work indicated a bank, not dangerous, to the eastward of Fishing Rip; and another, dangerous for large vessels, midway between Fishing Rip and Phelps Bank, and close to the 5-fathom sounding reported by the steamship Persia in 1863. The work also indicated that the shoals reported by the Chelston in May, I9IO, and by the Manitou in January, 19Io, do not exist where reported, but it is probable that the Chelston struck on the 16-foot lump on the north part of Davis

Bank, shown on the charts, and that the Manitou' s 8-fathom sounding was on Fishing Rip Shoal. The experience of the Bache indicates that owing to the uncertain currents no shipmaster is safe in assuming that he is making good his course and distance when navigating in these waters. Between November 11 and December 22 the party was engaged in an examination of Five-Fathom Bank, off Cape May, N. J. On January 8 the Bache sailed for Key West, making an unsuccessful search en route for shoals reported off Diamond Shoal Light Vessel; off Cape Romain, and between Cape Canaveral and Jupiter Inlet. The work of extending the triangulation from the vicinity of Key West to Rebecca Shoal and of revising the hydrography with special reference to New Ground Shoal, Boca Grand Channel, and the region about 11 miles southeast by south of Rebecca Shoal Lighthouse was taken up immediately after arrival at Key West. Considerable difficulty was experienced in the extension of the triangulation to the westward of the Marquesas Keys, but this was overcome, and at the end of June the triangulation was finished and the hydrography nearly completed. An exhaustive search was made for a 17-foot spot reported about 11 miles southeast from Rebecca Shoal Lighthouse, and its existence at or near the reported location disproven. Search for another reported shoal near Marquesas Rock buoy was made without success. Incidentally, during this work the position of the steamship Luckenbach, while stranded on New Ground Shoal, and the position of the wreck of the steamship Hannah M. Bell on Elbow Reef were determined.

The work done is included on charts 268, 269, 369', 369 5, and 369 8· Important topographic and in some case hydrographic changes that were found to have occurred since the charts were published were incorporated in the charts, data being obtained from recent local surveys by the United States Engineers, railroads or others, and by inspection in the field. Points were located by sextant angles and tape measurements where necessary. Triangulation work was begun in North Carolina on May 6 for the purpose of connecting the triangulation by the United States Engineers on the Neuse River and its tributaries, with that previously executed by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The observer was directed also to remark and redescribe any old Coast and Geodetic Survey stations found and to determine the geographic positions of any permanent objects along the shore such as beacons, church spires, stacks, etc., not already included in the triangulation by the United States Engineers. This work was in progress on June 30. On April 6 a determination was made of the position of the North German Lloyds steamer Prinzess Irene which had run aground on the south shore of Long Island, N.

stations occupied

Between July 19 and 24, observations were made from Sankaty Head Lighthouse to determine the position of the steamers Bache and Endeavor, engaged in triangulation to furnish positions needed in the survey of Nantucket Shoals, which work was assigned to the Bache. During the intervals of this work, when weather was unfavorable for observations, the positions of two new range lights for entering Nantucket Harbor were determined, and six tidal bench marks were recovered. Between March 31 and May 26 a revision was made of the triangulation of Galveston Bay, Tex. In 1900 a base line had been measured by the United States Engineers near Texas City, and from this base a scheme of triangulation had been extended covering the shores of Galveston and East Bays. In this work a search had been made for the old triangulation stations of the Coast Survey, of which 8 were recovered and made a part of the work. An examination of the observations and computations showed that no new triangulation would be necessary if the stations established by the United States Engineers could be recovered. A search was made for triangulation stations established by the United States Engineers, of which 21 were found and 8 have been destroyed, but of the 5 old stations of the triangulation by the Coast Survey searched for none were recovered. The work in Galveston Bay and in East Bay was practically completed, but no work was done in West Bay. Channels have been dredged to Port Bolivar, Texas City, and across the bay to the mouth of the San Jacinto River. Channels have also been dredged to the mouths of Dickinson Bayou and Trinity River, to Seabrook, and across Hannas Reef in East Bay (East Bay Pass). The positions of the beacons on these channels were determined by

The statistics given above cover the whole season, May 12 to September 2, 19IO, when work was suspended for the winter. The survey of Cook Inlet from the Forelands to the head of the inlet was completed by making a hydrographic survey of this portion and by making a topographic survey of 22 miles of the shore line on the north shore to complete the survey of the three sections of this shore which were unfinished at the close of the previous season. In Turnagain Arm the triangulation was extended to a point 15 miles above the entrance, and a topographic survey was made along both shores for a distance of IO miles. A hydrographic survey of the entrance south of Fire Island was made and the soundings were extended 12 miles above the entrance. Similar work was done in Knik Arm, the triangulation extending to the town of Knik and the hydrographic work to a point IO miles above the entrance. A topographic survey was made of the north shore for a distance of 10 miles south of Knik and along 5 miles of the south shore of the Arm. During the season one party was kept at work on shore, living in camp, and for a portion of the time another party was so employed. Some current observations were made during the season, but the other work was not delayed for this purpose. The strong tidal currents encountered increased the difficulty of making satisfactory soundings and caused considerable delay in this work. A range of the tide amounting to 35 feet was observed on the tide staff established in Knik Arm at a point about 8 miles above the entrance. The duration of slack water at times does not exceed five minutes and the flood tide advances over the flats at a rapid rate in a line of white breakers of considerable height accompanied by a loud roar.

Knik Harbor affords protection in all kinds of weather, and deep water close inshore was found in the vicinity of the mouth of Ship Creek, where a good supply of fresh water e..xists throughout the summer. Magnetic observations were made with a compass declinometer at several triangulation stations in Cook Inlet. Assistant Beck reports his appreciation of the service rendered by the officers and crew. The officers worked hard and harmoniously and the crew was composed of exceptionally good men. On October 3 the McArthur sailed from Port Graham and reached Seattle on the 21st. Assistant Beck resigned from the service on March 31, 19II, to.accept the position of inspector in the Bureau of Lighthouses.

On July 1 the Gedney was engaged in the survey of Tongass Narrows, Alaska, with a subparty on shore at Wards Cove and another subparty with the steamer Cosmos at work at the head of Portland Canal. On July 27 work was taken up in Wrangell Strait and the triangulation of Sumner Strait and Frederick Sound was connected with the work of the Army Engineers in Wrangell Strait, establishing points for the topographic and hydrographic survey of the strait. On August 6 the Cosmos, having completed work at the head of Portland Canal, was assigned to work at the south end of Wrangell Strait and continued with the Gedney on this work until the close of the season in October, when the survey of the strait was practically completed. The work done in Tongass Narrows completes the survey from the northern entrance to midway of Pennock Island. All of Wrangell Strait has been surveyed, but some additional soundings at critical points and anchorages outside the southern entrance are desirable. The completed survey at the head of Portland Canal extends from Lion Point to the head of the canal, including the town site of Stewart, British Columbia. This work, including hydrography and topography, was undertaken in order to more accurately locate the international houndary lines at that point.

eastern shore, only one quadrilateral having been laid out and partly observed. The topography was confined to the western shore and was carried from Nichols Hills to 7 miles beyond Cape Constantine, a distance of about 30 miles. The hydrography was extended from the limits of the work in 1909 to both the southeastward and southwestward, and extends on the southward to deep water. Four hundred and sixty-nine square (statute) miles of. hydrography were done, involving more than 2 ooo miles of soundings lines and nearly 22 ooo soundings. The season was noted for unusual fogs, which often interfered with the progress of the work. Tides were observed 28 days and nights continuously to determine the datum plane. Work off the Nushagak was closed on September 17 and the Explorer sailed for the Kuskokwim, examining the coast and the approaches to the river. An excellent report of this work was made, furnishing the best sailing- directions for entering the Kuskokwim yet available.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the party on the steamer Yukon was engaged in surveys on the east coast of Cook Inlet, Alaska, from East Foreland southward. This work was completed westward to Kalgin Island, and 30 miles to the southward. A small local triangulation with a short base line was executed to furnish positions and orientation for a 1/10 ooo harbor sheet at Kenai, and the topography was continued 5 miles up the river. Two lines of soundings were run up the river to the limits of the topography. A number of dangers to navigation were located and determined in position. The approaches to the Kenai and Kasilof Rivers were developed sufficiently for the demands of the ports. Tidal observations with automatic and staff gauges were made during the season, and current observations were made at four stations. Work was closed about the middle of October and the vessel was laid up at Kodiak. In May work was resumed on the coast of Alaska with a party on the steamer McArthur. On the way to Prince William Sound an examination was made of La Perouse Glacier and an attempt to enter Icy Bay was prevented by the ice in the bay at that season. Some supplementary soundings were made in Katalla Bay and east of the Martin Islands to complete the hydrography previously executed.

On July 1 the steamer Patterson was engaged in the topography and hydrography of Cook Inlet, Alaska. The eastern shore line of Cook Inlet was surveyed from abreast the southern end of Kalgin Island southward to Kachemak Bay. A topographic survey was made of Kachemak Bay and approaches from Anchor Point on the north and the north side of Port Graham on the south to just above Homer Spit and Coal Bay. The hydrography of Cook Inlet was completed from the southern end of Kalgin Island to Port Graham and from the eastern shore to about the center of the inlet. In Kachemak Bay the hydrography has been finished as far eastward as a line north and south passing through Gull Island. This includes Coal Bay and anchorage near Homer. Tidal observations were made at Port Graham with an automatic gauge and staff gauges were read at other points. In all, 6 stations were occupied for the observation of tides. Currents were observed at 12 stations on the eastern shore of Cook Inlet. In the magnetic work, 4 stations in Cook Inlet were occupied for declination. The ship was swung in Kachemak Bay, once at sea, three times in the inside passage, and at Union Bay on the return from Alaska. The vessel arrived at Seattle on October 22 and at San Francisco on November 2. Soundings were made along the usual steamer routes between Seattle and San Francisco. Work on the coast of Alaska was resumed in the vicinity of Dolgoi Island on May 19. A base line was measured at the head of Volcano Bay, signals erected, and triangulation begun. An automatic tide gauge was set up in Dolgoi Harbor, at which continuous tidal records were taken from June 9 to the end of the month. Topography was begun on June 24 and hydrography on June 27.

From February r 5 the party on the steamer Research continued the revision of observations of the triangulation between Siquijor and Camaguin Islands and Illigan Bay, across the Mindanao Sea, for the purpose of obtaining trustworthy data for the continuation of the triangulation across the island of Mindanao. The object of this work was to secure data for the proper coordination of all surveys of the Philippine Islands. This work was completed on May 13, after which date the vessel went to Cebu for some minor repairs, and then proceeded to Tacloban for the purpose of taking up the work of triangulation, topography, and hydrography of Carigara Bay and Daram Channel. This work was in progress at the close of the year.

During July the party on board the steamer Research was engaged in hydrography along the south coast of l\fasbate Island, the triangulation and topography of which had already been executed. From August 1 to September 3 the vessel was undergoing repairs at Iloilo. In September the party was transferred to the east coast of Cebu Island, investigating on the way the location of a reported shoal off the mouth of the Himugaan River on the north coast of Negros. No traces of such a shoal were found. Work on the coast of Cebu was begun September 15. The triangulation having been previously executed, the topography and hydrography were begun at once and progressed rapidly. No offshore dangers to navigation in the waters between Bohol and Cebu were found. The eastern part of the hydrography joined the hydrography done

Hydrography: x 732 square miles of area sounded, l 420 miles run while sounding, 21 849 soundings made, 2 tidal stations established, 2 hydrographic sheets finished.

During the period from January 25 to the date of last report received the party on the steamer Romblon was continuously engaged in surveys in the vicinity of Burias and Masbate Islands. The triangulation consisted of a large scheme of triangulation which was carried on in conjunction with the work of the steamer Fathomer. Progress in this work was necessarily slow on account of the difficulty of observing over the long lines. When conditions were unfavorable for observing the longer lines the tertiary scheme was carried forward and points were located for use in topography and hydrography. The topography consisted of the mapping of the shore line of the outlying islands between Bondoc Peninsula and Burias Island, including the harbor of San· Pascual and the entire west coast of this island to Aguja Point at the south end. A detached survey was also made of a portion of Port Barrera, Masbate Island. The hydrography was carried on over the region covered by the topography and over. a considerable portion of the sea between Burias, Sibuyan, Romblon, and Banton Islands. An automatic tide gauge was operated at San Pascual, Burias Island, and staff readings were taken at the same place and at Barrera.

During the season from July 1 to December 31, the party on the steamer Fathomer was engaged upon surveys on Mindoro, Tablas, and Panay Islands, with the exception

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19n.

of a short time spent in repairing and outfitting at Manila. The triangulation consisted of the completion of observations at 6 secondary stations and at 10 tertiary stations. The main scheme of secondary work was completed around the southern end of Mindoro to the west coast; southward it was .completed over the Semarara group and the Maniguin Island, from which the Cu yo Islands may be easily seen; and eastward and southeastward it rests on Tablas and Panay, extending to the locality selected for the Ibajay base net on the north coast of Panay. The topography between July l and December 31 was extended over the Semerara group, some portions of Mindoro and the south end of Tablas Island, and a subsheet of small topographic corrections near Sicogan and Calagnaan Islands, northeastern Panay. The hydrography includes the Semerara group, portions of the Mindoro coast, the entire west and south coasts of Tablas Island, and all the waters between Mindoro and Tablas and 5 miles to seaward south and southeast of the Semerara Islands. A development was also made near Sicogan and Calagnaan Islands, northeast Panay. Tides were observed with an automatic gauge at Looc Bay and with staff gauges at numerous points. Magnetic observations were made with compass declinoµ1eter at seven stations on shore and the ship was swung five times. Work was begun in February on the survey of the area bounded by Luzon, Burias, Masbate, Panay, and Tablas Islands in conjunction with the party on the steamer

Marinduque.
The triangulation consists mainly of large figures in the principal or secondary scheme for the islands, laid out to complete the final connection between Luzon and all of the islands south of it, for the coordination of the various independent surveys. The scheme had reached Tablas Island in the year 1910, and is being connected directly with the southern work extending from Masbate and northern Panay southward. The site for a base line at Navas, northwestern Panay, was selected and the small figure near it laid out. The topography included the northwest end of Panay and Maniguin Islands, beginning at Pandan on the west coast, where it was connected with the work of 1907, and was extended on the north coast to Ibajay, leaving only 14 miles for the completion of the shore line of the entire island of Panay. On Tablas Island the survey was extedded along the southern half of the east coast and over Carabao and Borocay Islands; the southern half of the west coast of Romblon Island, and more than half of the south coast of Sibuyan Island were also completed. The inshore hydrography was completed along au· of the shore covered by the topography and was generally extended to the 50-fathom curve. The offshore hydrography was completed southward to a line 1U miles south of Maniguin Islet and westward and northwestward to a connection with the work of the previous season, thus completing the hydrographic survey of all the area between Mindoro, Tablas, and Panay. Carabao and Borocay Passages between Tablas and Panay were finished and much work was done in various parts of the sea between Tablas, Panay, Masbate, Sibuyan, and Romblon Islands. Soundings were obtained over the proposed cable route from Calivo to Romblon for the use of the Bureau of Posts.

Tides were recorded by an automatic gauge on Tablas Island and staff gauges were read at various points. The magnetic work consisted of ship swings and declinometer observations at stations about 15 or 20 miles apart. Current observations were made at nine stations distributed over an area of 5 ooo square miles. A log line and a 12-foot pole were used and hourly or half-hourly readings were taken: The currents measured were generally less than 1 knot, but in the passages between Tablas and Panay they were 2 or 3 knots. Sea-water temperatures were measured twice, once west of Panay and once east of Tablas, using the NegrettiZambra thermometer. In these localities the sea is about 700 fathoms in depth and connected with the China Sea and the Pacific by channels of less than 300 fathoms. The temperature was found constant below this depth and 50° to 51° F., compared with a surface temperature of 83° to 86° F. The ascent of Sibuyan Peak, 6 722 feet high, was made for the purpose of placing a triangulation station there. This is said to be the first ascent ever made, although there had been several attempts by various persons both in Spanish times and since. Two reconnaissance parties were used, with a total of 2 officers and 21 men; one party being engaged for 10 days and the other for 8 days. The only difficulty was found to be the thick small growth on the upper half of the ascent, making.extensive trail cutting an absolute necessity. One night was spent on the summit and the peak was rejected as a station site on account of the difficulty of clearing and making it ready for occupation, and on account of almost impossible cloud conditions about it throughout the year. The mountain lies upon an island about 12 miles in extent and is the highest elevation in a radius of 90 miles. It has always been called the roughest and most difficult peak of the Archipelago, although Mount Baco, 8 200 feet, in Mindoro, which is not so well known and has never been climbed, is probably worse. The vegetation and geology of it appear to be of little interest and there is no wild life. In structure it appears to be part of the rim of some crater of very great age, so old that few traces , of volcanic activity remain, and there is left only the curved form of the steep, sharp range on which it lies. The rock is a very homogeneous limestone, not stratified or otherwise marked, reddish brown and coarse grained, its surface showing constant erosion by rain and wind, pitted thus 1 to 2 feet deep. The upper slopes of the peak are almost completely covered by bowlders 10 to 30 feet in size, which had apparently been much shaken about in the severe earthquakes six weeks before. There are large landslides on all the slopes and a few were heard during the ascent. The vegetation extends entirely to the summit and grows on the bare rocks, as practically no moss is found and no soil, the heavy and continual condensation from the clouds supporting it. The shrubs are 6 to 12 feet in height, growing in a thick interwoven matted fashion, so that one may crawl over their tops. They are very crooked, with a hard tough wood which burns with difficulty. The most frequent are a kind of dwarf fir or agojo, and a chaparral. Only a few other varieties are found. The pitcher plants are numerous, with pitchers containing a quart of water, good for drinking. The Bejuco stops at 5 ooo feet and there is no cogon grass. There are few insects and none of the wood leeches, so numerous on the other islands.

HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.

[W. C. DIBRELL, Commanding Steamer Explorer.] SUMMARY oF RESULTS.-Triangulation: 32 square miles of area covered, 2 signal poles erected, 7 stations occupied for horizontal measures, 3 geographical positions determined. Magnetic work: 6 land stations occupied and observations made in 5 positions at sea. Topography: 22 miles of general coast line surveyed, r topographic sheet completed. Hydrography: 590 square miles sounded, 1 580 miles run while sounding, 6 300 positions determined, 16 324 soundings made, 17 hydrographic sheets finished.

During the season from October I 8 to February 20 the steamer Explorer was engaged in the survey of the island of Oahu. The triangulation had been completed and the topography begun by another party. The party on the Explorer completed the topography and extended the hydrography to the 100-fathom curve all around the island and at frequent intervals to much deeper water. By the end of the season the survey of the island of Oahu had been completed. The instructions for this work contemplated the prosecution of systematic surveys of the Hawaiian group, beginning with the island of Oahu. Work already done was not to be repeated. The hydrography of Oahu was to include the 100-fathom curve, and the topography was to be restricted to a delineation of the shore line. A party in charge of Assistant 0. B. French had been at work on the islands for some months previous to the arrival of the Explorer, and upon the departure of Mr. French in October he was succeeded as chief of party by Mr. L. W. Smith, aid. Mr. Smith was instructed by the Superintendent to place himself and party under the direction

of the commanding officer of the Explorer for duty upon the arrival of that vessel in Hawaiian waters. When the Explorer reached Honolulu the shore line had been completed from a point just eastward of Mokapu Peninsula, along the northeastern and northwestern coasts of the island nearly to Kaena Point. The hydrography had been completed between Honolulu and Diamond Head out to the 20-fathom curve, and Mr. Smith was then engaged upon the development of Kaneohe Bay, his equipment consisting of a chartered schooner and launch. A subparty was at work upon the island of Kauai. Mr. Smith continued work in Kaneohe Bay until completed and then took up the inshore sounding and hydrography of Waialae Bay. When that was done the unsurveyed portion of the shore line of the island of Oahu was run and sufficient local triangulation was executed for the control of the hydrography and topography. The hydrography executed by the Explorer includes the entire water area adjacent to the island of Oahu, excepting Pearl and Honolulu Harbors. Pearl Harbor was omitted on account of dredging in progress and the chart of Honolulu Harbor was found to be sufficiently accurate without an additional survey. The development of the hydrography was completed out to the 100-fathom curve and along nearly the whole coast widely spaced soundings extend much farther, reaching to from 3 to 5 miles from shore. Seventeen current stations were occupied, and magnetic observations were made at a number of land stations. Magnetic observations were also made on shipboard at five positions off the coast of Oahu, and the ship was swung on sixteen headings at the beginning of the season and again at the end. The ship was swung also off Mokapu Peninsula, off Waialae, and off Wainae.
[O. B. FRENCH.] RESULTS.-Astronomic observations: 1 azimuth determined. Base measurement: r base line measured. Hydrography: 2 square miles of area covered, 25 miles of line sounded. Topography: 80 miles of shore line surveyed, 6 miles of shore line revised, 10 miles of roads surveyed, 3 topographic sheets completed. Triangulation: 352 square miles of area covered, 53 stations occupied, 132 geographical positions determined.
SUMMARY OF

The revision of the survey of the Hawaiian Islands was in progress on July 1 and was continued under the direction of Assistant French until October 11, 1910, and after that date under the direction of Assistant W. C. Dibrell. (See the report of his work.) An abstract from the Territorial records on file at Honolulu to furnish the data needed in the work and for use at the Office in Washington, was completed. The triangulation was extended along the coast of the western half of the island of Kauai and a topographic survey was made of the shore line. In connection with this work, observations were made to determine an azimuth, and a base line more than 2 miles long was measured. The region covered by the triangulation is very rough and broken with ridges 4 ooo feet in elevation and precipitous in many places. These ridges are covered with a dense mass of tropical vegetation, through which it was often necessary to cut a passage. Hydrographic signals were established along the coast covered by the triangulation at intervals of approximately 1 mile.

A continuous record of the variations in the earth's magnetic condition was obtained at the magnetic observatory near Honolulu, Hawaii, during the year with self-registering instruments. Observations were made once each week to determine the absolute value of three elements of terrestrial magnetism, and once each month to detennine the scale values. Special declination observations were made on April 28 in connection with the eclipse of the sun on that date. In order to comply with the request of the Royal Society of London for international cooperation in magnetic work on certain term days from May, 1911, to January, 1912, covering a portion of the period of the magnetic work of the English South Polar Expedition now in the Antarctic regions, a special record was obtained on the magnetograph in accordance with an international program. Daily meteorological observations were made and continuous temperature records were obtained in the open air, in the magnetograph room, and in the seismograph room. Time observations were made every week. The seismograph was kept in operation and a practically continuous record was obtained. One hundred and seventy earthquakes were registered during the year at this station.

(0. B. FRENCH.]

In response to a request. from the West Rockaway Land Co. and the Department of Docks and Ferries of New York City for the location on a drawing furnished by them of the high-water line at Belle Harbor, Jamaica Bay, N. Y., as shown by the surveys of 1835 and subsequent years, it became necessary to send an officer to Belle Harbor in order to make a connection between points shown on the drawing and the triangulation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. This work was completed May 22 to 25. The field ·expenses of the work were paid by the West Rockaway Land CG.
ROCKI,AND SPEED TRIAL COURSE.

[O. B. FRENCH.]

In response to a request from the Navy Department, an officer was assigned to supervise the erection of permanent beacons to mark speed trial course in the vicinity of Rockland, Me., in place of the temporary wooden structures used in the past. Designs for iron structures were prepared to meet the requirements of the Navy Department and a contract for the work was made with the lowest responsible bidder. During the period May 6 to May 12 the sites for the foundations of the new beacons were selected, and the positions were determined by triangulation and marks were placed so that the contractor could use them in placing the foundations. The foundations were completed before the end of the fiscal year, but the erection of the superstructure remained to be done at that time. The field expenses of this work were paid by the Navy Department.

out of position or destroyed, and to establish stakes in Roanoke Sound to meet the requirements of recent legislation by the State. The field work was begun on February 1 1 and completed on March 4. Positions in Pamlico Sound established to meet the requirements of the acts of the General Assembly of North Carolina of 1909 relating to fish and fisheries, were re-marked in position or the position checked if the marking was found to be satisfactory; two additional stakes were placed on the Oregon Inlet Reservation. The recent legislation relative to fishing in Roanoke Sound forbids pound or other net fishing during the shad and herring fishing season anywhere in the Sound except west of a line extending from Buoy No. 39 (1 ooo yards east of Hog Island) to a point 200 yards east of Broad Creek Point and one-fifth of the width of the Sound from the shore line northward of a line bearing east 10° north from Ballast Point. In compliance with the law and under the direction of the Fish Commission, stakes were placed in the Sound in the proper localities and their positions determined by sextant angles. The execution of the work was facilitated by the cooperation and assistance rendered by the officers of the Fish Commission of North Carolina.
[R. S. PATTON.]

Work in Albemarle and Croatan Sounds, N. C., for the location of boundaries of fishing grounds was begun October 15, in accordance with the request of the State authorities. Buoys marking the limits of the grounds were placed and their location determined by sextant angles on points determined by triangulation. In Albemarle Sound 42 buoys were planted between October 31 and November 23 completing the work required. Work in Croatan Sound was begun November 25, and by November 30 thirteen buoys were planted, completing the work. The boundaries of the fishing grounds were marked in accordance with acts passed in 1909 by the Legislature of North Carolina, providing that i.n the Carolina sounds all net fishing should be so restricted as to leave a free passage for the fish from the inlets, through the sounds to the various rivers tributary to them. Thus in the two sounds in which the present work was executed the law provides that an area of one-third of the width of the Sound shall have no nets set in it.

MASSACHUSETTS, BOSTON HARBOR.

iJ. F. PRATT.] At the request of the Boston Chamber of Commerce, an inspection was made of Boston Harbor with a view to the erection of tidal indicators for the guidance of vessels entering the harbor. Owing to the influence of the winds and the natural fluctuations of the tides, it is well knowt;l that the water level is at times below the plane of mean low water shown on the charts, and also that the times of high and low water may differ from those in the predicted tables, which represent normal conditions. The tidal indicators are intended to show to vessels the act.ual height of the tide at any time by inspection. They have been successfully used in New York and San Francisco Harbors and in the Delaware River. A careful examination was made of various localities suggeste<l as suitable sites for the indicators and information gathered for a report on the subject, with an estimate of probable cost and other data.

Early in July preparations were made for determining the latitude and longitude of a point and the azimuth of a line at Fairbanks, Alaska, and similar work at Tanana, Alaska. This work was undertaken at the request of the United States Geological Survey and was intended to furnish a starting point and an azimuth for the land surveys. Latitude and azimuth were observed, latitude on 7 and azimuth on 4 nights; and longitude was determined by exchange of telegraphic signals on 3 nights with an observer at Valdez. At Tanana a station was selected in the Government reservation on which Fort Gibson is located. Telegraphic signals for the determination of longitude were exchanged with the observer at Valdez on 5 nights, azimuth determined by observations on 3, and latitude on 7 nights.
GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION, NEW YORK.

[EDWIN SMITH.]

At the request of the United States Geological Survey a station was selected and marked in Manhattan Square, New York City, just north of the buildings of the American Museum of Natural History. This station was marked with a concrete pier, and about IOO meters to the northward of it a meridian mark was set. The station was connected trigonometrically with points in and upon the museum buildings. Latitude was observed on five nights and longitude determined from the base station at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, Washington, D. C., signals being exchanged on four nights.

Topography, levels and line profile were carried from the end of the work of 1909 to monument 355 near Coutts, the point of starting by the Canadian parties, a distance of 50.13 miles, by July 31, the levels being extended 2.5 miles south to the United States Geological Survey bench mark. The levels run along the boundary by the Canadian parties were also connected with the United States Geological Survey bench mark near Hinsdale, Mont. Work was then taken up at a point west of Frenchmans Creek, and continued until August 24, when the party returned to the camp at Bluff Creek. Topographic work was completed to monument site 261 B, a distance of 81.65 miles, by October 14, and work was then closed for the season. Work was resumed early in June, l9II, and was in progress at the close of the year.
[J. B. BAYLOR.]
SUMMARY OF RUSULTS.-Triangulation: 89 triangulation points occupied, i8 monuments erected and determined in position by triangulation, I base line measured. Topography: 50 miles of boundary line mapped, is plane table sheets completed. These statistics include work by the Canadian party.

At the beginning of the fiscal year work was in progress on the northeastern boundary line of the United States and Canada between Maine and New Brunswick, the party representing the Commissioner on the part of the United States working conjointly with a Canadian surveying party in the trigonometric and topographical survey of the St. J o.hn and St. Francis River valleys. The triangulation points on each side of the St. John River were marked with concrete monuments. These monuments are used as reference monuments to fix the exact location of the international boundary line on the St. John and St. Francis Rivers as reproduced from the official boundary charts of the Commissioners, under the treaty of 1842. In a short section of the St. Francis River, where the triangulation points are located on the heavily wooded hills, separated from the bed of the river by a dense growth of woods, concrete reference monuments were located near the banks of the river and connected with the triangulation points. Three base lines were measured, two by the Canadian party and one by the American party. A line of levels was run by the Canadian party up the St. John and St. Francis River valleys to the head of Cross Lake above the rapids, where the season's work ended. This line of levels was connected wherever practicable with the bench marks of the Canadian transcontinental railway, in course of construction. Detailed plane table maps were made of the adjacent valleys on a scale of 1/5 ooo, with 20-foot contours. Work was begun on May 5, 1910, in the vicinity of Edmundston, New Brunswick, and the survey and monumenting were carried to the head of Cross Lake on the St. Francis River, where the season closed on October 30. Work was resumed about the middle of May, 1911, and was in progress at the close of the year. Field work was begun by the American party near the head of Beau Lake and by the Canadian party on the St. Francis River, where the boundary line leaves it at what is now known as Boundary Lake. Up to June 30 ten triangulation points were observed on along the St. Francis River by the American party, and a base line was measured. Lines of sight had to be cut

through the woods for much of this work. A plane table sheet on the St. Francis River was nearly completed and the reference triangulation points for defining by coordinates the boundary line on the St. Francis River were marked with concrete monuments. A line-cutting party was kept at work clearing a vista 30 feet in width through the forests along the boundary.

The survey of the boundary from the mouth of Pigeon River westward toward the Lake of the Woods was continued during the season of 1910. The party was in the field at the beginning of the year, but owing to delay caused by forest fires field work was not begun until July 18. Starting from a line of the stadia work of 1909 near South Fowl Lake as a base, a scheme of triangulation was begun extending along the chain of of lakes through which the boundary runs, from Pigeon River to Rose or Mud Lake. Subsidiary triangulation of the separate lakes was executed for the purposes of the topography and connected with the general scheme. The triangulation points were marked in a permanent manner. The heights of triangulation stations on each lake were determined by vertical angles. Observations for azimuth were made at station Abel on South Fowl Lake. The topography covers the shore line of the lakes and of the streams connecting them, all of the portages, and the location of the high cliffs or bluffs along the chain of lakes. At Watup portage, between Mountain and Rove Lakes, where there is no water communication, the portage was surveyed and contour lines run. This portage takes the shortest route from lake to lake. It was cut out to a width of some 20 feet, and new blazes were made on the trees. No indication of any water connection between the lakes could be found. A base line was measured on the ice between triangulation stations Cad and Arthur on Rose Lake. The triangulation was carried to the west end of Rose Lake, but the topography of the lake was not completed. Field operations closed for the season on December 8, and were resumed on May 31. During June, 22 stations were occupied for observations of horizontal angles, and some progress was made in the topographic work.

With the inception of the triangulation a general survey of the line covering a strip 2 miles in width was carried on. Beginning at Short Creek astronomical station the work was carried eastward as far as monument No. 170, near the eastern terminus of Turtle Mountain, a distance of 136.4 miles, but owing to unfavorable weather no new monuments were set east of 172. In all 94 cast-iron monuments were set between and including old monuments 219 and 172, 48 replacing the old and 46 for the new sites. The average distance between sites was 1.4 miles. Two hundred and sixty square miles of topography was completed during the season. The statistics given are for the season beginning April 26 and ending November 27, 1910. Mr. Granger again took the field with the party of Mr. McArthur at St. John, N. Dak., on April 27, 1911, for the identification of old and the establishment of new monuments from the vicinity of Bannerman, Manitoba, eastward, and the work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. Work on the survey and monumenting the boundary was begun at old monument No. 171 and carried eastward, and by June 30 the triangulation, topography, and monumenting had reached monument No. 154, a distance of 39 miles.

SUMMARY OF RUSULTS.-2 square miles of triangulation, 14 signals erected, 62 stationsoccupicdfor horizontal measures, 371 geographic positions determined, 17J1 miles of level lines run, 17}4 miles of traverse line measurement.

Two cooperating parties for the survey of the boundary line between the United States and Canada on the St. Croix River were in the field at the beginning of the year, the Canadian party being under the charge of Mr. A. J. Brabazon. Work was begun by the American party in the vicinity of Calais, Me., the Canadian party having just completed the triangulation to a point immediately above the bridge at Baring, but having yet to execute the reconnaissance and signal building between that point and Woodland, Me. In the meanwhile the American party undertook the connection of the more marked topographical features with the triangulation in the vicinity of Intemationai, Union, Milltown, and Baring Bridges and the reoccupation of such points below Baring as had to be connected with the points built by the Canadians during the current season. Upon the completion of the first part of the scheme the American surveyor made a reconnaissance of the section of the river between Woodland and the Grand Falls of the St. Croix and then began operations for connecting recognizable points in this area with the triangulation of 1887. In this work a number of traverse lines were run in two directions, measurements being made with a 50-meter steel tape, and lines of leveling were run to reduce the measurements to their horizontal values. The changes of directions between the various sections were measured with a 7-inch theodolite. The ends of the traverse lines were connected by triangulation. Work was closed near Vanceboro on October 26. From Woodland to the mouth of the river the survey is entirely completed. The same parties resumed operations near Woodland in June, 1911, and work was in progress at the clos.e of the fiscal year.

SUMMARY OF Rl?SULTS.-131 linear miles of triangulation, 524 square miles covered by triangulation, 75 stations occupied, 77 monuments occupied, l 198 horizontal angles measured, l 198 vertical angles measured, 128 miles of boundary monumented, 85 monuments set, 2 bases measured, I azimuth determined.

From a line a little east of the north fork of Milk River, where the triangulation was carried during the season of 1910 the work was extended to Sweet Grass or Coutts, where a base was measured and a junction made with the Canadian triangulation. An azimuth was measured, by a Canadian surveyor, in connection with longitude work, and a connection made with the triangulation. A base was also measured and an azimuth determined a little west at Rocky Creek. Work closed in the latter part of October at Scobey, Mont. In May, 1911, work was resumed on the Middle Branch of Poplar River and up to the close of the year about 40 miles of triangulation had been completed and the reconnoissance had been extended about 10 miles farther. About 30 miles of boundary were monumented in the same period.
ALASKA BOUNDARY.
(0. M. LELAND.]

The party engaged in the survey of the Alaska Boundary at the head of the Big Salmon River began work on June 16 and closed field operations on September 17. The work done included the running of a line of precise levels between Skagway and the summit of White Pass, a connection by triangulation of the work of 1907 at the head of Glacier Bay by Mr. Ftemont Morse of the Coast and Geodetic Survey with that at the head of the Big Salmon River by the Canadian party of Mr. Ratz in 1905, the more accurate determination of the positions of peaks Nos. 6900, 6600, and 6000 of the latter work, and the extension of the photo-topographical work to cover the region at the head of Muir Glacier. This party did not take the field in 1911, but the computations of the field work were completed for 1910, and work was continued on the photographic plotting of the work done in 1907, 1908, 1909, and 1910, which is yet unfinished.
(FREMONT MORSE.)

At the beginning of the year a Canadian party was engaged in marking the AlaskaCanada boundary near the head of Portland Canal, the United States being reprt':'sented by a field officer assigned for that duty. The instructions to the Canadian surveyor were, in brief, as follows:
To draw a line from Eagle Point Monument on an azimuth of 270 (astronomical east) and mark it on the east side of Portland Canal with a concrete monument. Also to mark it near the shore on the west side of the canal in the same way, determining t11e distance between the monuments. To mark all Coast and Geodetic Survey triangulation points on both sides of the canal, south from the above line to the latitude of Lion Point with concrete. If these points can not be found by the marks on the rocks, etc., to reestablish them as nearly as possible by triangulation and then mark them. To remove the monument placed on the straight line joining D and G 6535, and to place it on the straight line joining S SII7 and S 6535. Monument G 5n7 and trace the line SII7-6535 by a narrow cutting to the Salmon River at least. To connect S 66oo, S 6800, and S 778o by triangulation.

Reference monuments were put up at East Monument on the east side of Portland Canal due east from Eagle Point Monument; at Law Reference Monument, built over the

old Coast and Geodetic Survey triangulation "Law," on the east side of the canal; Southwest Base Reference Monument, built over the Coast and Geodetic Survey triangulation station "Salmon River Southwest Base"; Keen Reference Monument, built close to the old triangulation station "Keen." These monuments were built of concrete. At Lion Point Astronomical Station, the old brick pier was utilized and repaired. The necessary triangulation was executed by the Canadian surveyor from the northern end of Portland Canal to a junction with that of the American representative working from the southern end of the scheme. On the American side at the mouth of Salmon River, where a town site had been laid out, the end of a wharf projecting over the flats was determined to see whether it crossed the boundary. It was found to be a short distance from the boundary on United States territory. The determination of Boundary Peak 7780, which had previously been determined by triangulation from the Unuk River, showed a remarkably close agreement with the previous work. Work in this locality under a similar arrangement was resumed in the spring of 1911 for the purpose of locating reference monuments for defining the boundary line down Portland Canal, but no field work was done before the close of the fiscal year.

SUMMARY OF RF.SULTS.-Triangulation: 65 signals erected, 72 stations occupied, 157·7 miles of progress in triangulation, l 231.6 square miles covered. Topography: 610 square miles covered, 750 miles of traverse lines run, 5 883 elevations computed from vertical angles, 139·7 miles of topographical belt completed. Line projection: 155 miles of line cutting and monumenting, 62 ·miles of vista cut and stadia line run, 20 monuments placed. Magnetic observations: 15 stations occupied. The statistics given are for the whole season of 1910, beginning May 24.

Work on the survey and marking of the boundary line between Alaska and Canada along the one hundred and forty-first meridian was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year. The object in view for the season of 1910 was to complete the projection of"the one hundred and forty-first meridian through to the Porcupine River from the point reached in 1909 about 40 miles north of the Yukon River, and to push the triangulation and topography well north of the Yukon so that during another season the base of supplies might be moved to Rampart House, on the Porcupine. By May 24, 1910, the party with its outfit, forage, provisions, and horses had arrived at Sheep Creek, Alaska, where a permanent base camp was established. The party was divided into eight subparties, each with its own cook, outfit, and pack train. To one of these subparties was assigned the work of triangulation, to another the reconnoissance; three parties were engaged upon topography, one was occupied in transporting supplies, and another had charge of the base camp on Sheep Creek. The chief of party exercised general supervision of the whole work and also occupied a number of stations in the triangulation. The difficulties of transporting a large party and its supplies and equipment through a wild and rugged country and of keeping open a line of communication by which the advance parties could be supplied with provisions necessary for their maintenance were very great. Pack horses and canoes were used for transportation; of the 76 horses taken in at the beginning of the season only 45 remained at its close, and those in a worn-out condition, owing to hard service and scanty provender.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19u.

Reconnoissance.-The duties assigned to this party were the laying out of the triangulation scheme and the erection of signals. In addition to this, practically all the main routes of travel were laid out, and much trail cutting was done. After assisting in cutting the main pack trails up Sheep Creek and down the Yukon River, the party was steadily employed on reconnoissance until August 15, when a connection was made with the work near the Porcupine River. Work to the southward was then begun, and connection was made with the triangulation at stations Salmon and Storm on August 28. Triangulation.-From the final points occupied in 1909, about 40 miles north of the Yukon, a belt of triangulation along the one hundred and forty-first meridian was carried to points north of the Porcupine. A base line was laid out near the Porcupine, with which the triangulation will be connected, but its measurement was postponed until the next field season. Observations were made on the main line signals wherever pos!lible, and observations were made at the line signals by the line projection party. Topography.-One of the topographic parties executed the work from latitude 65° 10' to 65° 30' and from 66° 10' to 66° 30', covering 200 square miles of area included on four sheets. The second party completed seven sheets, closing at latitude 66° 10'. The triangulation party was occupied on topographical work for a portion of the season, and completed the topography of a little over 50 square miles from latitude 66° 30' to
66° 41'.

Line projection.-The line projection was in direct charge of a Canadian surveyor, with an assistant surveyor representing the chief of the American party. During a portion of the season this work was done in conjunction with that of the triangulation party, but later the parties were operated independently. The line was projected from point E of the- boundary to P, about 10 miles beyond Rampart House, a total of i55 miles, the extremes of latitude being 65° 16' 13" and about 67° 29'. Line and monumenting.-The line cutting and monumenting were done by a Canadian party. A vista 20 feet wide was cleared through the timber, and small aluminum bronze cone monuments were erected at intervisible points not more than 4 miles apart. The monuments not already tied into the triangulation were located by three point observations. In all 62 miles of vista were cut and stadia run and 20 monuments placed. The boundary crosses the Porcupine River at the mouth of Sunaghun Creek. Magnetic obser11ations.-Observations of magnetic declination were made by the triangulation party, and I 5 stations were occupied. The party for the survey of the Alaska boundary again took the field in the spring of 1911, and by June I had arrived at Rampart House. Work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.
[D. w. EATON.]

A Canadian party accompanied by an American surveyor was engaged in line cutting and monument setting along the boundary south of Sixty Mile River, completing the work not previously done from the Yukon River southward to the Mount Natazhat Ridge. In all, monuments were set for about uo miles, and about 60 miles of line were cut.

SPEED TRIAL COURSE, DELAWARE BREAKWATER.
[ISAAC WINSTON.]

At the request of the William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding & Engine Co. a new speed trial course, 1 nautical mile in length, was established off Delaware Breakwater at the entrance to Delaware Bay, the Cramp company paying all field expenses. Signals were erected at the approximate location of south range E, and at a point on shore on the prolongation of the old (south) range line, and also near three additional points needed for the range marks; and observations of horizontal angles were made at these four points and at two of the three lighthouses, whose positions furnished the bases for the determination of the trial course. The positions of the poles on the south range were then shifted to the positions indicated by the preliminary computation and the observations were repeated. The final computation was then made, and the positions of the range marks were indicated on the south range. The range marks on the north range were to be placed over the triangulation stations on that range. The positions of the range marks with reference to the points indicated for them were afterwards verified by measurements on the ground, as requested by the Board of Inspection and Survey of the Navy Department.
MARYLAND OYSTER BEDS.

[C. C. YATES.] SUMMARY OF RF.SULTS.-Triangulation: 360 square miles of area covered, 102 stations occupied, loo geographic positions determined. Physical hydrography: 240 observations of the density of water made.

Under authority conferred by law, the Survey continued to cooperate with the Maryland Shell Fish Commission in surveying and marking the natural oyster beds, bars, and rocks in the State of Maryland. All field work undertaken by the Survey was completed on December 15, 1910, and since that date the whole party has been engaged in completing the records and computations and in the preparation of the charts and reports for the remaining counties covered by the work for publication. The descriptions of the boundaries and landmarks in Charles County were published during the fiscal year.
DELAWARE OYSTER REDS.

[C. C. YATES.)

Under the authority of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, an officer of the Survey continued the supervision of the survey of the oyster beds of the State of Delaware. The necessary field work was completed under his direction as consulting engineer on October 19, 1910, and since that date the preparation of the necessary charts and description of boundaries, etc., for publication has been continued. The expense of this work, including the salary of the officer of the Survey while engaged on it, was paid by the State of Delaware. The appreciation of the State authorities for the service rendered by the Government in assigning an officer to this duty is shown in a resolution adopted by the State legislature, thanking Assistant Yates for the very valuable service rendered by him in successfully carrying out the work of the Delaware Oyster Survey Commission.

DETAILS OF OFFICE OPERATIONS.
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE.
[ANDREW BRAID, Assistant in Charge.]

The Assistant in Charge of the Office has direct supervision of the work of the different divisions of the Office. The Tidal Research Section is under the immediate direction of the Assistant in Charge, and the Miscellaneous Section is a subdivision of his office.
COMPUTING DIVISION.

Satisfactory progress was made in the reduction and discussion of field operations and the preparation of results for publication. Among items of work of importance done during the year may be mentioned the preparation for publication of the results of the triangulation in the northern portion of California, which is published as Appendix 5, report for 1910; the preparation for publication of the results of triangulation along the east coast of Fl9rida; along the northern portion of the ninety-eighth meridian in Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota; and along the southern portion of the ninety-eighth meridian in Texas. This work was nearly completed at the end of the year. Computations have been made to show the effect of topography and isostatic compensation upon the intensity of gravity. Considerable progress has been made in the computation of the triangulation along the coasts of the United States as well as along the boundaries between the United States and Canada and Alaska and Canada.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

The report of this division shows an increased demand for information concerning terrestrial magnetism, chiefly of the magnetic declination in the United States. The results of the field observations on land and at sea during the fiscal year I9IO were prepared for publication as Appendix No. 3, Report for I9l0. A chart was nearly completed, showing the lines of equal magnetic declination in the United States for I9l0, and the secular change tables were revised and extended to 19Io. The reduction of the work of the Cheltenham Observatory for 1907-8, the Sitka Observatory for 1907-1909, the Honolulu Observatory for 1907-8, and the Baldwin Observatory for 1907-1909 were completed and subinitted for publication. The work of the Porto Rico Observatory for I 907-8 was completed. "Directions for magnetic measurements" were completed and published. Tabulations were made of data relating to earthquakes recorded at the magnetic observatories, and copies of the records of the principal earthquakes were furnished to the International Seismological Association. Similar information relating to Honolulu was
67

68

COAST AND GEODETIC Sl!RVEY REPORT, 191x.

furnished to the seismological committee of the British association. Other special requests for data were promptly complied with. The reduction of the work of the Cheltenham Observatory for 1909-10 was begun. The times of the abrupt beginnings of 15 selected magnetic storms, 19o6-1909, were determined for each of the five magnetic observatories, to be compared with similar readings from foreign magnetic observatories.
TIDAL DIVISION.

There were received, examined, registered, and indexed in this division records from 24 self-registering tide-gauge stations, with a combined length of 15 years and 27 days, and records from 95 staff gauges, with a combined length of 6?{ years. The total of all tide observations made by the Survey and received during the year is 2 1 years and 4 months at 119 stations, and from other sources, 29 years, 4 months, and 23 days.at 42 stations, making a grand total of 50 years, 8 months, and 23 days at 161 stations. The preparation of the annual Tide Tables was continued. Harmonic analyses were completed for 11 stations, with a combined length of 2 years and 9 months. Nonharmonic reductions were made for 73 stations, with a c9mbined length of 26 years, 7 months, and 23 days. Mean sea level was computed for 19 stations, with a combined length of I 1 years, 11 months, and 25 days. High and low waters and hourly heights of the sea were tabulated for 222 stations, with a combined length of 41 years, 4 months, and 29 days. The following is a list of the sources from which tide observations were received besides those made by the Survey: I. United States Army Engineers, tides in the United States; 1 station, 8 months and 3 days; Canal Zone, 3 stations, 3 years. 2. American ambassador to Mexico, Mexico, 36 stations, 23 years, 4 months, and 20 days. 3. Alaska boundary survey; 1 station, 1 year. 4. Hawaiian government survey; 1 station, 2 years. Copies of predicted tides for the year I9I2 for Sandy Hook, N. J., Baltimore, Md., Charleston, S. C., and San Francisco, Cal., were sent to the Imperial Hydrographic Office at Wilhelmshaven, Germany, in exchange for similar data for Hamburg and Apia. At the request of the Secretary of the Marine Department of New Zealand, copies of predicted tides for the year 1912 for Wellington and Auckland, New Zealand, were furnished. The Tide Tables for the year 1912 were completed and the proof read.
DRAWING AND HNGRAVING DIVISION.

In the work of this division during the year, progress has been made toward carrying out the recommendations of the chart board as to the simplification of information shown on the charts, the construction of charts on the mercator projection, and the replacing of present charts of the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts by a smaller number of new charts. The construction of the proposed new charts also affords an opportunity for the·orientation of charts with the meridian and the elimination of double units of depths.

INSTRUMENT DIVIRION.

This division attends to the accounting for all instruments and general property of the. Survey and the necessary correspondence relating to instruments and property; the repairs to instruments; the designing and construction of new instruments and apparatus; experimental work arising from the proposed application of new discoveries and inventions to the purposes of the Survey; the determination of instrumental constants; the selection and purchase of new instruments and material; the construction and repair of office furniture, and minor repairs to the office buildings.

DETAil;,s OF OFFICE OPERATIONS.

73

The principal work of the division is to keep in repair the instruments used in the Survey, and to undertake new work only when special designs, experiments, or conditions required by the special and peculiar needs of the Survey make purchases in the open market impracticable. The gas engine, furnishing power for the freight elevator and instrument shop, and the pneumatic time system and call-bell system are attended to by employees of this division. The new tide-predicting machine completed in February, 1910, was taken apart in April of this year for the purpose of polishing, gilding, lacquering, etc. Considerable progress has so far been made, and the large glass case for housing the machine when finally finished is about half completed. A short article descriptive of the machine has been prepared for publication. Two new compass declinometers have been completed and subjected to a preliminary test, which establishes the fact that the main purpose of their design, the elimination of index error, has been realized. Two new geodetic levels were also completed during the year. The use of permanent metal station marks to fix and identify triangulation stations has been much increased during the year, and extended by the adoption of similar reference marks, one or more of which are placed in the vicinity of each triangulation station. Similar marks are also used for marking magnetic stations. Fifteen new invar tapes for base measurement were completed during the year. A testing apparatus for the purpose of detecting magnetic properties in brass castings was designed and constructed, and a method was devised of illuminating at night poles used in current observations. A set of these poles with the necessary apparatus was furnished to five light vessels stationed along the New England coast. The new zenith tube for latitude observations, constructed by William Gaertner upon plans prepared by Dr. F. E. Ross, for the International Geodetic Association Observatory, Gaithersburg, Md., was inspected and adjusted. A new adjustable copying or target board was devised and constructed in the Instrument Di.vision and installed in the Photographic Section of the Office. By its use a large tracing can be photographed in sections without restretching and fastening into place. An apparatus was also designed and consti-ucted for making readily accessible the tide curves produced automatically by the new Coast and Geodetic Survey tide-predicting machine. The rolls containing the curves, which are over 365 feet long, can be mounted in it and quickly unwound and rewound, thus exposing for reference the curve for any day of the year for which the information is sought.
LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES.

The current routine work of the division was kept up to date except in the Library Section, where the work fell slightly behind owing to lack of clerical assistance. The revision of the book-subject catalogue was nearly completed. The records received from the field were indexed as received. The library file of Coast and Geodetic Survey charts and the files of foreign charts are now arranged in proper numerical order. Five thousand obsolete, duplicate, and unnecessary books and pamphlets have been removed from the shelves for transmission to the Library of Congress, the Superintendent of Documents, and the Weather Bureau.

TIDAL RESEARCH SECTION.

The principal work done in the Tidal Research Section, which was organized at the beginning of the year, may he briefly summarized as follows: A paper entitled "Arctic tides" was completed and issued by the Survey as a Special Publication. Harmonic constants are given for 50 stations, all but one of which lie north of the sixtieth parallel. The discussion was undertaken primarily for the purpose of utilizing the observations secured by the Peary expedition, but in order to show their full significance and to throw as much light as possible upon remaining Arctic problems, an effort was made ·to collect and use all available results pertaining to the tides in Arctic waters. A paper entitled "General description and uses of the new or simultaneous tidepredicting machine" was prepared and submitted for publication. The preparation of the matter in this paper involved numerous tests of the machine. Numerous requests for information in regard to tidal and current problems were answered. Current observations taken on Nantucket Shoals and in the James River were reduced. A new diagram of the East River currents was completed for the annual Tide Tables. During the last two months of the fiscal year a systematic compilation of tidal matter from published (French and German) sources was begun
MISCELLANEOUS SECTION.

The Miscellaneous Section makes all purchases under the appropnation for Office expenses and also makes many purchases to fill orders for supplies required for field parties, including the necessary correspondence, sending out of blank proposals to bidders for supplies, preparation of orders for the same, preparation of vouchers, and other miscellaneous work. All requisitions for printing and binding are also prepared

in this section. Stationery for the Office and field parties is kept in stock and issued on requisition. In July, 1910, the sale and distribution of Coast Pilots and Tide Tables was trans- · ferred from the Miscellaneous Section to the Chart Division. In the same month, in accordance with instructions from the Department, all publications of the Survey, excepting Charts, Coast Pilots, and Tide Tables, were transferred to the Division of Publications. This Bureau ceased to distribute publications on August 10, and the transfer of 'the publications on hand to the Department was completed September 30, except such as were retained for official use. The appended report of publications distributed for the year, therefore, includes only the July distrihution. The office inventories of furniture, machinery, and tools, with all papers and records relating thereto, were turned over and placed in charge of the Instrument Division on December 31, 1910. The following publications were received from the Public Printer during July, 1910:

Inspectcr of Magmitic Work; Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

INTRODUCTION.

The present publication contains the results of magnetic observations made on land and at sea by officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the prosecution of the magnetic survey of the United States and all outlying territories during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1911. There are also included some results obtained by surveyors engaged in marking out the Alaskan boundary along the one hundred and forty-first meridian. Five magnetic observatories have been in continuous operation throughout the year-at Cheltenham, Md.; Sitka, Alaska; near Honolulu, Hawaii; on Vieques Island, P.R.; and near Tucson, Ariz. There will be found in the tables the values of the magnetic elements for each of the observatories, based on the observations of December and January.
OBSERVATIONS ON LAND AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

The distribution of the stations on land is shown in the following table, from which it will be seen that observations were made during the year in 43 States and Territories. Numerous old stations were reoccupied, in order to determine the secular change of the magnetic elements.

SECULAR CHANGE OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION.

A comparison of the declination results at "repeat" stations occupied during the year with the results of earlier observations in the same localities is presented in the following table. The letters after the names of stations indicate, (a) that the old station was reoccupied exactly, (b) that the new station was very near the old one, and (c) that the new station was some distance (a quarter of a mile or more) from the old one. A tabular value of annual change refers approximately to the middle of the period from which it is deduced. A plus sign indicates increasing east declination or decreasing west declination, and a minus sign the reverse. It will be seen that west declination is

increasing at the rate of about 6' a year in New England and that east declination is increasing at the rate of about s' a year on the Pacific coast. The line of no change extends from Key West, Fla., to Duluth, Minn. At the magnetic observatory at Vieques, P. R., west declination is increasing at the rate of about 9' a year.

INSTRUMENTAL CORRECTIONS.

The instrumental comparisons made with the <;tandard instruments at Cheltenham during the year indicate that the corrections used for the previous year's work require little correction except in the case of magnetometer No. 31, the Porto Rico Obseniatory instrument. As a result of comparisons at Cheltenham in 1903 and at the Porto Rico Observatory in 1905, + 0.00095 H was adopted as the correction to be applied to horizontal intensity results with that magnetometer to reduce them to the Cheltenham standard. In July, 1910, the yacht Carnegie of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, stopped at Vieques on her way to South America, and her instruments were compared with those of the Porto Rico Observatory. These comparisons indicated that some change had taken place in magnetometer No. 31 sioce the comparisons of 1905. To verify this, magnetometer No. 36 was compared at Cheltenham in January, 19II; with No. 31 at the Porto Rico Observatory in February and April; and again at Cheltenham upon its return. These comparisons gave for the correction to No. 31 in March, 1911,-0.0005 H. A careful scrutiny of the observatory records failed to find any evidence of a sudden change in magnetometer No. 31 which might account for this change in its relation to the standard magnometer, and it was therefore considered best to assume a gradual change from +0.00095 H in January, 1907, to -0.0005 1-l in March, 1911. The values given in the appendixes for 1908, 1909, and 1910 must therefore be corrected to read as follows: 1908.0, 29095r; 1909.0, 28993r; 1910.0, 28895r. Corrections to magnetometers.

The correction to these dip needles varies with latitude.

The correction +J.'S was used for observations in Alaska.

REDUCTION OF OBSERVATIONS.

Each value of the magnetic declination has been reduced to the mean of the month in which the observation was made with the aid of the continuous observations at the nearest magnetic observatory, allowance being made for the change in diurnal range with change in magnetic latitude. No attempt has been made to correct the dip and intensity results for diurnal variation.
ARRANGEMENT OF TABLES.
LAND OBSERVATIONS.

The values of declination, dip, and horizontal intensity presented in Table I are arranged by States alphabetically, and the results for each State are given in the order of increasing latitudes. The latitudes and longitudes are in most cases the result of solar observations made with the small theodolite which forms a part of the magnetometer. In default of observations or a chart the geographical coordinates were scaled from the best available map, either a topographic sheet of the United States Geological Survey, a post-route map, or some other State map. In such cases only the nearest whole minute of latitude and longitude is given. The horizontal intensity is expressed in terms of the one hundred thousandth part of a C.G.S. unit of intensity of magnetic force, termed a gamma and designated by the Greek letter r· In order to include the desired amount of information in the available space the following abbreviations have been adopted. Only the month and day of the date are given, since all the observations were made between July 1, 1910 and June 30, 1911, except where a statement to the contrary is made in a footnote. ·The months have been abbreviated as follows:

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19u.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS. Magnetic observers are instructed to mark every station in as permanent a manner as possible, either with a stone or a post of some durable wood, so that it may be available for future occupation. They are also required to furnish a sufficiently detailed description to locate the station, even if the marking should be destroyed, and to determine the bearing of two or three prominent objects in addition to the one used as reference mark in the azimuth and declination observations. The information is given in abridged form on the following pages for each of the stations occupied during the year. Further details can usually be obtained upon application to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The usual method of marking a station is by a stone post about 3 feet long and 6 or 8 inches square, set so as to project an inch or two above ground. Previous to 191 r these stones were lettered on top U. S. C. & G. S., with a drill hole in the center to mark the exact point, but beginning with the year 1911 a circular brass station marker 3,U inches in diameter, set flush in the top of the marking stones, has been substituted for the lettering just mentioned. These brass station markers have the words "U. S. Coast & Geodetic Survey Magnetic Station" cast on them. A small drill hole in the center of the marker marks the center of station. Whenever the local authorities desired, and were willing to bear the expense, a second stone was set to denote the true meridian. The descriptions of stations are arranged alphabetically by States and by names of stations.
ALABAMA. Abbeville, Henry County.-Thc station is on the grounds of the primary school, about 4 blocks south of the town's center. It is in the southeastern section of th~ field, 285 feet from the fence west of it, 380 feet from the iron railing around the cemetery north of it, 92 feet from the footpath cast of it, and 87 feet from the fence south of it. It is marked by a granite post 10 by 10 by 30 inches, projecting 4 inches above ground, with a brass station marker in the top. The following true bearings were determined:
o

Geneva, Geneva County.-The station is about three-fourths of a mile south of the center of the town on the field of Mr. Tilton. The west end of this field borders on the main road going south from Geneva. The magnetic station is in the southeast end of the field, about one-fourth mile from this road, and may readily be located by first going to the large oak tree which stands out very prominently. It is 57.4 feet northwest of the base of this tree and 89. 2 feet north of a wire fence inclosing the field on the south. It is marked by a granite post 8 by 8 by 30 inches with a C. & G.

TRIANGULATION ALONG THE NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN, NEBRASKA TO CANADA, AND CONNECTION WITH THE GREAT LAKES.
By
WILLIAM

Bowm,

Inspector of Geodetic Work; Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

GENERAL STATEMENT.

In 1907 the arc of primary triangulation was completed which runs approximately along the ninety-eighth meridian and extends from Corpus Christi on the Gulf of Mexico to the United States and Canada boundary, with a spur running across the State of Minnesota, connecting the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation with that of the Lake Survey in the vicinity of Duluth. Hereafter the term "ninety-eighth meridian triangulation" will be used for all of the primary triangulation extending from Corpus Christi, approximately along the ninetyeighth meridian, to the Canadian boundary and to Duluth, and the Point Isabel base net. In this publication are given certain data regarding the field and office work connected with that portion of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation which is north of the Page base net, Nebraska. Several members of the Computing Division have taken part in the preparation of this appendix. The preparation of the results of the triangulation for publication was made by Mr. H. C. Mitchell. The greater portion of the work of making the difficult adjustments involved in fitting in the new triangulation between the fixed triangulation at Page, Nebr., and Duluth, Minn., was done by Mr. C. R. Duvall or under his immediate direction. Mr. A. L. Baldwin had immediate direction of the computation and adjustment of the elevations from vertical measures and the discussion of the results. The engineer intent only upon securing the necessary information to enable him to extend this triangulation or to base other surveys upon it will find the information he desires on pages 233 to 342 of this appendix, commencing with the explanation of the table of positions, lengths and azimuths. The index printed on pages 325 to 342 used in connection with the sketches at the end of the publication, will enable him to find quickly the data for any given locality. The discussion of the field work and the comparison of the results of the different seasons' work on the ninety-eighth meridian will be confined, as far as is practicable, to that done after 1901, for in the following year some notable changes were made in the field organization and in the methods of making the observations. It would be unfair to the parties working on the ninety-eighth meridian previous to 1902 to make a direct comparison of their progress with the progress made later. Beginning with the season of 1902 observations were made on both heliotropes and acetylene lamps, thus greatly extending the observing period, and trained light keepers or heliotropers were kept throughout a season and frequently the same men were employed during a number of seasons. Besides, the parties were directed to obtain an accuracy represented by an average closing error of a triangle of one second of arc, and no delay was made to get the ideal observing conditions.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1911.

The results of the triangulation done along the ninety-eighth meridian, previous to 1902, and extending from Anthony base net, in Kansas, to the Page base net, in Nebraska, are given in Appendix 6, Report for 1901, and Appendix 3, Report for 1902. The triangulation done in 1902 along the ninety-eighth meridian to the south 'of the Anthony base net, in Kansas, is published in Appendix 4, Report for 1903, while that done in 1903, on the southern portion of the ninety-eighth meridian, is published in Appendix s, Report for 190s. The four appendixes mentioned above cover the results of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian from the Seguin base net, in Texas, latitude approximately 29° 2s', to the Page base net, in Nebraska, latitude approximately 42° 30'. The remainder of the work at the south end of the ninetyeighth meridian is published in Appendix s. Report for 1911, and the results of the triangulation at the northern end of the ninety-eighth meridian, above the Page base net, are contained in this publication. Thirteen of the fifteen base lines along the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, on which the length of the triangle sides depend, were measured in two seasons, those of 1900 and 1906, by parties under Computer A. L. Baldwin and Assistant 0. B. French, respectively.' There were also used to control lengths in this triangulation the Minnesota Point base, in the vicinity of Duluth, which was measured by the United States Lake Survey and the Laguna Madre base, in Texas, which had been measured by the Coast and Geodetic Survey to control the lengths of lines on the coast triangulation of the Gulf of Mexico. During the season of 1900 the duplex base bars of this Survey and so and 100 meter steel tapes were used on each of the nine bases measured, the different pieces of apparatus being standardized on the field, using the iced-bar apparatus. One kilometer of each base, called the test kilometer, was measured with the duplex bars and with each of the four tapes. About one-fifth of the total length of all the bases, after the test kilometers were deducted, was measured with the duplex bars, about two-fifths were measured with the so-meter tapes, and the remaining two-fifths were measured with the 100-meter tapes. As a result of this season's work it was decided that in future primary base measurements only tapes were necessary and that the most efficient length of tape was about so meters. During the season of 1906 six primary bases were measured, four of them being on the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. Complete measurements were made on each base with so-meter steel tapes and also with invar tapes of the same length; standardizations of all the tapes were made on the field, using the iced-bar apparatus to determine the length of the comparator. The invar tapes were also standardized at the Bureau of Standards, before and after the work on the field. The invar tapes proved to be very satisfactory and they are now used exclusively to measure primary base lines by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. 2 RECONNOISSANCE. The reconnoissance tor that portion of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation between the Page base net, Nebraska, and the line between stations Farmer and Salem in South Dakota (see illustrations Nos. 1 and 2) was done by the triangulation party under Assistant F. D. Granger, in 1900 and 1901, just preceding the erection of signals and the occupation of the stations.

The reconnoissance from the line between stations Farmer and Salem to the Canadian border and eastward to the vicinity of the town of Aitkin, Minn., in approximate latitude 46° 30' and approximate longitude 93 ° 40', was done in l 903 by a reconnoissance party under Assistant W. H. Burger. The actual field work was begun on April 23 and ended on October 5, 1903. The reconnoissance of the northern end of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation was resumed in 1904 by the triangulation party under Assistant W. H. Burger, with Signalman Jasper S. Bilby in immediate charge of the reconnoissance. This work started in the vicinity of Aitkin, Minn., the point to which it had been carried in 1903, and it was extended eastward to Duluth, Minn., where it was connected with the primary triangulation of the Lake Survey. The actual field work was begun in July and ended on August 3 1, l 904. The instructions under which this reconnoissance was done were, in part, as follows: INSTRUCTIONS FOR RECONNOISSANCE.
CHARACTER OF FIGURES. (1) The chain of triangulation between base nets shall be made up of .completed quadrilaterals and of central-point figures, with all stations occupied. It must not be allowed to degenerate even for a single figure to simple triangles. There must be two ways of computing the lengths through each figure. On the other hand there must be no overlapping of figures and no excess of observed lines beyond those necessary to secure a double determination of every length, except that in a four-sided central-point figure one of the diagonals of the figure may be observed. STRENGTH OF FIGURES.
(2) In the chain of triangulation between base nets the value of the quantity

R=(N~!!__c)I

second best (call it RJ exceed 80, in units of the sixth place of logarithms. These are extreme limits never to be exceeded. Keep the quantities R 1 and R 2 down to the limits 15 and 50 for the best and second best chains, respectively, whenever the estimated total cost docs not exceed that for a chain barely within the extreme limits by more than 25 per cent. The values of R may be readily obtained by the use of the "Table for determining relative strength of figures in triangulation." (Seep. 166.) In the above formula the two terms Nd;;dNc and l'[a 2A +aAau+a 28 ] depend entirely upon the figures chosen apd arc independent of the accuracy with which the angles are measured. The product of these two terms is therefore a measure of the strength of the figures with respect to length, in so far as the strength depends upon the selection of stations and of lines to be observed over. In the following table the values tabulated are I[o 2A-l-oAo11 +o2 8 ]. The unit is one in the sixth place of logarithms. The two arguments of the table arc the distance angles in degrees, the smaller distance angle being given at the top of the table. The distance angles are the angles in each triangle opposite the known side and the side required. ih and 08 arc the logarithmic differences corresponding to one second for the distance angles A and B of a triangle. The square of the probable error of the logarithm of a side of a triangle is

The summation indicated by I is to be taken for the triangles used in computing the value of the side in question from the side supposed to be absolutely known.

The strength table is to be used in connection with the values of NdN:c to decide during the prog-

APPENDIX 4. TRIANGULATION, PAGE, NEBR., TO CANADA AND DULUTH. LENGTHS OF LINES.

167

(3) No line of the primary triangulation outSide of the base nets should be less than 6 kilometers long. There is little if any advantage in so far as accuracy is concerned, in making the lines much longer than this. Therefore endeavor, in laying out the triangulation scheme, to use the economic length of line; that is, endeavor to use in each region lines of such lengths as to make the total cost of reconnoissance, building, and triangulation a minimum per mile of progress, subj.:!ct to the limitations stated in these instructions. FREQUENCY OF BASES. (4) If the character of the country is such that a base site can be found near any desired location 2 R 1 between base lines should be made about 130. This will be found to correspond to a chain of from 15 to 35 triangles, according to the strength of the figure~ secured. With strong figures but few base lines will be needed and a corresponding saving will be made on this part of the work. If topographic conditions make it difficult to secure a base site at the desired location, 2 R 1 may be allowed to approach but not exceed 200. There will be danger when this is done that an intervePing base may be necessary; for, if in any case the discrepancy bet·veen adjacent bases is found to exceed 1 part in 25 ooo an intervening base must be measured.

BASE SITES AND BASE NETS.
(5) In selecting base sites keep in mind that a base can be measured with the required degree of accuracy on any site where the grade on any 50-meter tape length does not exceed 10 per cent, and that narrow valleys or ravines less than 50 meters wide in the direction of the base arc not obstacles to measurement. The length of each base is to be not less than 4 nor more than 12 kilometers. In each base net great care should be taken to secure as good geometrical conditions as possible. There should be no hesitancy in placing the.base on rough ground, provided the roughness is not greater than that indicated above, if by doing so the geometrical conditions in the base net arc improved. Each base net should not be longer than two ordinary figures of the main chain between bases. The base net may also be strengthened by observing over as many lines between stations of the net as can be made intervisible without excessive cost for building or cutting. Caution is necessary in thus strengthening a base net by observing extra lines, to avoid making the figure so complicated as to be excessively difficult and costly to adjust.

The 1903 party, working in South Dakota and Minnesota, consisted of the chief, a signalman, and a driver. The outfit consisted of three horses, two light wagons, and the necessary small instruments. The members of the party depended upon the country for meals and lodging. Mr. Bilby worked alone on the reconnoissance in Minnesota in 1904 and in Texas in 1904-5. He had with him a very small outfit carried in a light spring wagon. In the following table are given the data regarding the progress and cost of the two seasons' work on reconnoissance at the northern end of the ninety-eighth meridian, together with similar data for comparison for the party making the reconnoissance at the southern end of the ninety-eighth meridian during the season of 1904-5. 1

It will be noticed that the rcconnoissancc at the northern part of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation cost more than that done in Texas at the southern end of this triangulation. The reason for this probably is that on the southern work Mr. Bilby was alone on the reconnoissance, using a very light outfit. The unit costs for the reconnoissance at the northern end of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation arc less than half the costs of any other reconnoissancc of a similar character previously done in the United States in the same kind of country. The cost per mile of progress for this reconnoissancc is only about 50 per cent greater than that of the rcconnoissance for the arc of P.rimary triangulation between M~rysville, Cal., and Tacoma, Wash., done in 1903-5, in a mountainous country. 1 The progress per month on that reconnoissance was 93 miles (150 kilometers), while the average progress per month was 85 miles for the reconnoissance on the northern portion of the ninety-eighth meridian, in Soutp Dakota and Minnesota. On much of the reconnoissance in South Dakota and Minnesota poles varying in length from 12 to 60 feet, with flags or lozenges, were erected over the stations. The observer climbed these poles to get an outlook ahead and back to the rear stations. They assisted him in selecting the stations as well as in making estimates of the heights of signals to be erected to make the stations intervisible. On a portion of the line running toward Duluth, the poles were frequently placed in trees. The greater portion of the area covered by the reconnoissance was prairie or land under cultivation, gently rolling, with numerous rows of trees and groves in the vicinity of the farmhouses. By using the poles above mentioned, the lines could be made to clear these obstructions. It was seldom found to be necessary to use poles on the reconnoissance in Texas, and this was a factor in reducing the cost of the work there.

The results of this arc of primary triangulation are not yet published.

PROGRESS OF OBSERVING. The triangulation between the Page base net, Nebraska, and the stations Wieters and Freeman in South Dakota (see illustration No. 1) was done during the season of 1901 by the party under Assistant F. D. Granger. In 1903 the party under Assistant 0. W. Ferguson carried the work from the two stations mentioned above to and including the Brown Valley base net, South Dakota. (Sec illustrations Nos. 2, 3, 4.) In 1904 the triangulation was extended from the Brown Valley base net to the vicinity of Brainerd, Minn. (see illustration No. 5), by a party under Assistant Wm. H. Burger. In 1905 Assistants Burger and H. D. King carried the work from Brainerd to, Duluth and made a connection with the triangulation of the Lake Survey. (See illustrations 6, 7, 8.) During this season Mr. Burger was in charge for about one month, with Mr. King in his party. When Mr. King had become familiar with the work he took charge, relieving Mr. Burger. In 1906 the writer carried the triangulation from the line between stations Wahpeton and Western (see illustration No. 9), in approximate latitude 46° IO' and approximate longitude 96° 20', to and including the Stephen base line. (See illustration No. IO.) In 1907 he continued this triangulation from the Stephen base net to the Canadian border (see illustration No. II), thus completing the ninety-eighth meridian arc of primary triangulation. A connection was made with triangulation stations on the Missouri River where the primary triangulation crosses that river to the westward of Yankton, S. Dak., and stations of the Mississippi River triangulation station were connected with the primary triangulation in the vicinity of Royalton, Minn. Connections were also made with many section comers established by the General Land Survey. The longitudes and latitudes on the United States Standard Datum of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers triangulation stations connected with and of the section comers are given in the list of geographic positions on pages 237 to 266. The signals used in all of the triangulation on the northern portion of the ninetyeighth meridian were identical with those used in 1902 and described in Appendix 4, Report for l 903. During each season of triangulation the building party was organized and equipped in a manner very similar to the building party of 1902. 1 It usually consisted of a signalman or a foreman, and three men. During each season the building party was in immediate charge of Signalman Bilby. The outfit of the building party was made as light as possible and consisted principally of the necessary tents and bedding for the members of the party, and the tools and hoisting apparatus required in erecting the signals. During the season of 1902 the building party had attained a very high efficiency. This efficiency was maintained throughout the succeeding seasons on the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. The unit costs per vertical foot of signals erected are not given in this publication, but they are probably within IO per cent of $3.20, the unit cost in 1902.

The organization of the observing parties varied slightly from season to season, consisting of from three to five men, besides the observer. The number of permanent light keepers was four. The tendency has steadily been to decrease the camp equipage and during the short season of 1907 it was practically at a minimum, consisting of two tents, cots and bedding for four persons, other small articles of camp equipage, and very light hand baggage. The entire outfit was hauled on one 2-horse wagon and the instruments were carried in a spring wagon. With a small camp the outfit can be prepared for moving in a very short time and, after a move, the camp can be pitched very quickly. On this account it was found that the energies of the party could be put into the technical work, while with a large camp equipment much time and energy are expended in caring for and moving the property. The outfit of instruments necessarily remained about the same in each of the parties. Each triangulation party on the northern portion of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation had only one observer. There were two observers in the parties working on the ninety-eighth meridian in 1902 and 1903. (See Appendix 4, Report for 1903, and Appendix 5, Report for 1905.) LIGHT KEEPERS. In general, four light keepers were used in the triangulation party and they were directed by letter and by code signals sent in a modified Morse alphabet, using the lamps and heliotropes in signaling. 1 As was the case during the season of 1902, the light keepers lived in tents, prepared their own meals, and moved from station to station in hired wagons. Each was supplied with progress sketches of the work and also descriptions of the stations. With these it was easy for them to move from station to station and to locate from a station all of the other stations to which it was necessary to show lights. As far as practicable, the same light keepers were kept throughout the season, and it was usually the case that at the beginning of the season it was possible to secure the services of light keepers who had been trained during a previous season. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS TO CHIEFS OF OBSERVING PARTIES. The general instructions issued to the chiefs of the observing parties are given below:
INSTRUMENTS.
In general, direction instruments of the highest grade should be used in triangulation of this class. Repeating theodolites are to be used only when the station to be occupied is in such a position as to be difficult of occupation with a direction instrument or when there is doubt of the instrument support being of such a character as to insure that the movement of the observer about the instrument does not disturb it in azimuth. Such stations usually occur on lighthouses and buildings.

In making the measurements of horizontal directions measure each direction in the primary scheme·
16 times, a direct and reverse reading being considered one measurement, and 16 positions of the circle

are to be used, corresponding approximately to the f<_>llowing readings upon the initial signal:

When a broken series is observed, the missing signals are to be observed later in connection with the chosen initial or with some other one, and only one, of the stations already observed in that series. With this system of observing no local adjustment is necessary. Little time should be spent in waiting for the doubtful signal to show. If it is not showing within, say, one minute of when wanted, pass to the neict. A saving of time results from observing many or all of the signals in each series, provided there are no long waits for signals to show, but not otherwise. STANDARD OF ACCURACY. In selecting the conditions under which to observe primary directions, proceed upon the assumption that the maximum speed consistent with the requirement that the closing error of a single triangle in the primary scheme shall seldom exceed three seconds, and that the average closing error shall be but little greater than one second, is what is desired rather than a greater accuracy than that indicated with slower progress. This standard of accuracy used in connection with other portions of these instructions defining the necessary strength of figures and frequency of bases will in general insure that the probable error of any base line, as computed from an adjacent base, is about I part in 88,ooo and that the actual discrepancy between bases is always less than 1 part in 25,000 REJECTIONS-DIRECTION OBSERVATIONS. The limit for rejection of observations upon directions in the main scheme shall be 511 from the mean. No observation agreeing with the mean within this limit is to be rejected unless the rejection is made at the time of taking the observation and for some other reason than simply that the residual is large. A new observation is to be substituted for the rejected one before leaving the station, if possible without much delay. NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS-SUPPLEMENTARY STATIONS-DIRECTION INSTRUMENT. In observing upon supplementary stations and in observing from supplementary stations upon stations in the main scheme four measures of the character outlined above shall be made of each direction, using the circle in the first four positions stated in that paragraph. A supplementary station is one which is not in the main scheme but which is observed upon or from which observations are taken for the purpose of· connecting with stations which can not be effectively reached from the stations in the main scheme and with which a connection is required by specific instructions.

NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS-INTERSECTION STATIONS-DIRECTION INSTRUMENT.

An intersection station is a station of which the position is determined by intersections from stations of the main scheme or supplementary stations and which is not occupied. One such measure as is outlined on page 171 shall be made of each direction to each intersection station. A second such measure shall be made if.it can be secured under conditions nearly as favorable to accuracy as were the conditions when the first measure was made and without much delay to observations in the main scheme. Each series of observations on intersection station is to contain some one, and only one, of the main scheme or supplementary stations. It is important to have at least three lines _to each intersection station in order to secure a check, but a possible intersection station should not be neglected simply because only two lines to it can be secured.
OBSERVING-SUPPLEMENTARY AND INTERSECTION STATIONS. Observations upon and from supplementary stations and observations upon intersection stations may be taken under any atmospheric conditions whenever the object to be pointed upon is visible, and no delay is likely to be made to secure good seeing before observing. LAND SECTION CORNERS AND OTHER SURVEY MARKS. Whenever it is feasible to do so without incurring undue expense and delay, the section comers established by the United States Land Survey, and survey marks of any kind found upon the ground, shall he connected with the triangulation either by direct measurement of a distance and direction from a station or by using them as intersection stations. VALUE OF INTERSECTION STATIONS. In selecting intersection stations it should be kept in mind that the geographic value of a piece of triangulation depends upon the number of points determined, the size of the area over which they are distributed, and the permanence with which they are marked. The geographic value of the triangulation is lost for a given area when points can not be recovered within that area. The chance of permanency is increased by increasing the number of points as well as by thorough marking. These considerations should lead to the determination as intersection stations of many artificial objects of a permanent character, such as lighthouses, church spires, cupolas, towers, and large chimneys; should lead occasionally to the determination of specially marked stations established for this particular purpose; and should frequently lead to the permanent marking upon the ground of topographic or hydrographic stations and their determination as intersection stations. The practice of permanently marking such hydrographic points as are in commanding positions-{)n promontories, for example-and which are so situated that the station is not likely to disappear if permanently marked (on firm ground not likely to be washed away or on rocks), and determining their positions as intersection stations will frequently obviate the necessity wl1ich would otherwise exist for new triangulation when a later hydrographic survey is made. It is especially desirable to increase the area effectively covered for geographic purposes by selecting intersection stations which arc outside the area covered by the main scheme. VERTICAL MEASURES IN MAIN SCHEME. Vertical measures are to be made at each station in the main scheme on each station in the main scheme. These vertical measures should be made on as many days as possible during the occupation of the station, but in no case should the occupation of the station be prolonged in order to secure such measures. Two measures, each with the telescope in both the direct and the reversed positions, on each day, are all that are required. These measures may be made at any time between rr.30 a. m. and 4.30 p. m. It is desirable, however, with a view of avoiding errors due to diurnal variation of refraction, to have a fixed habit of observing the verticals in the main scheme at a certain hour, as, for example, between 3 and 4 p. m. If the vertical measures at a station are made by the micrometric method, double zenith distance measures shall be made on at least two of the lines radiating from that station.

APPENDIX 4. TRIANGULATION, PAGE, NEBR., TO CANADA AND DULUTH. VERTICAL MEASURES-SUPPLEMENTARY AND INTERSECTION STATIONS.

173

In addition to t11e vertical measures required in the main scheme, vertical measures must be made ateach station, whetlier in tl1e main scheme or supplementary, over every line of which the horizontal direction is measured. Two measures each wi t1i tlie telescope in both the direct and reverse positions are all tliat are required on all lines to or from supplementary or intersection stations, except when the observations upon such stations are made for tlie purpose of connecting witli bench marks of which tlie elevations are fixed by precise leveling or tidal observations. In tlic latter case observations should be made on as many days as possible during the occupation of t11e station, but in no case should tlie occupation of a station be prolonged in order to obtain measures. Also, in tlic latter case, tlic vertical observations are to be made in botli directions over every line more tlian s kilometers long, even though horizontal measures may be necessary in but one direction over tlie line. MARKING OF STATIONS. Every station, whctlicr it is in tlie main scheme or is a supplementary or intersection station, which is not in itself a permanent mark, as are lightliouses, church spires, cupolas, towers, large chimneys, sharp peaks, etc., shall be marked in a permanent manner. At least one reference mark of a permanent character shall be established not less tlian 10 meters from each station of tlie main scheme and accurately referred to it by a distance and direction. Such reference marks shall preferably be established on fence or property lines, and always in a locality chosen to avoid disturbance by cultivation, erosion, or building. It is desirable to establish such reference marks at all marked stations. At all stations where digging is feasible botli underground and surface marks which are not in contact with each other shall be established. Wood is not to be used in permanent marks. DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS. Descriptions shall be furnished of all marked stations. For each station which is in itself a mark, as arc lightliouses, church spires, cupolas, towers, large chimneys, sharp peaks, etc., eitlicr a description must be furnished, or t11e records, lists of directions, and lists of positions must be made to show clearly in connection witli each point by special words or phrases if necessary tlic exact point of tlie structure or object to which the horizontal and vertical measures refer. Every land section comer connected witli tlie triangulation must be fully described. The purpose of tlie description is to enable one who is unfamiliar with tlie locality to find tlie exact point determined as the station and to know positively tliat he has found it. Notliing should be put into the description tliat does not serve tliis purpose. A sketch accompanying description should not be used as a substitute for words. All essential facts which can be stated in words should be so stated, even tliough they are also shown in the sketch. ABSTRACTS AND DUPLICATES. The field abstracts of horizontal directions and vertical measures are to be kept up and checked as tlie work progresses and all notes as to eccentricities of signals or instrument, of height of point observed above ground, etc., which arc necessary to enable t11e computation to be made, are to be incorporated in t11e abstracts. As soon as each volume of the original record has been fully abstracted and the abstracts checked, it is to be sent to the Office, tlie corresponding abstracts being retained by the observer. A duplicate of tlie description of stations is to be made. If tlie original descriptions of stations are \\Titten in the record books, a copy of t11cse descriptions compiled in a separate book may be considered the duplicate and should then be marked as such. A duplicate of the miscellaneous notes mentioned above may also be made if considered desirable. No oilier duplicates of tlie original records are to be made. Pencil originals should not be inked over. NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS-MAIN SCHEME-REPEATING THEODOLITE.
If a repeating tlieodolite is used for observations in tlie main scheme, corresponding to tliose indicated on page 171, make tlie observations in sets of six repetitions each. For each angle measured follow each set of six repetitions upon an angle wit11 tlie telescope in t11e direct position immediately by a similar set of six on tlie explement of tlie angle witli tlie telescope in the reversed position. It is not

1 74

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19n.

necessary to reverse the telescope during any set of six. Make the total number of sets of six repetitions on each angle ten-five directly on the angle and five on its cxplcmcnt. Measure only the single angles between adjacent lines of the primary scheme and the angle necessary to close the horizon. With this scheme of observing no local adjustment is necessary, except to distribute the horizon closure uniformly among the angles measured. The limit of rejection corresponding to that stated on page 171 shall be for a set of six repetitions 4 11 from the mean. NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS-SUPPLEMENTARY STATIONS-REPEATING THEODOLITE.
If the observations at a supplementary station or upon a supplementary station, corresponding to indicated on page 171, arc made with a repeater, four sets of six repetitions each should be made, two directly upon each angle with the telescope in the direct position and two upon its cxplement with the telescope in the reversed position. No measures introducing station conditions other than closure of horizon are to be made upon or at supplementary stations.
tho~

NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS ON INTERSECTION STATIONS-REPEATING THEODOLITE.
If the observations upon intersection stations, corresponding to those indicated on page 172, are made with a repeater, two sets of three repetitions each should be made, one directly upon an angle with the telescope in the direct position and one upon its explcment with the telescope in the reverse position. Fix the direction to each intersection station by measuring the angle between it and some line in the main scheme or to a supplementary station. No measurements introducing conditions are to be made. FIELD COMPUTATIONS.

The field computations arc to be carried to hundredths of seconds in the angles, azimuths, latitudes, and longitudes, and to seven places in the logarithms. The field computation may be stopped with the completion of the lists of direction for all stations and objects, and the triangle side computation for the main scheme and supplementary stations, unless tllere are special reasons for carrying it further, The computation to this point should be kept up as closely as possible as the work progresses to enable the observer to know that the observations are of the required degree of accuracy. No least square adjustments are to be made in tl1e field. All of the computation, taking of means, etc., which is done in the record books and the lists of directions should be so thoroughly checked by some person other than the one who originally did it as to make it unnecessary to examine it in the Office. The initials of the person making a"nd checking the computations in the record books and the lists of direction should be signed to the record as the computation and checking progresses.

METHODS OF OBSERVING EMPLOYED. All the angle measures were made by the direction method, using the 1 2-inch (30-centimeter) theodolites which had been made in the Instrument Division of the Survey. These instruments are described in Appendix 8, Report for 1904. The telescope used has a clear aperture of 61 millimeters and its focal length is 74 centimeters. The circle is graduated to five-minute spaces and is read by the micrometer microscopes to single seconds. The telescope of the theodolite has two parallel vertical wires, about 20 seconds apart, for making the paintings for horizontal angles. The results from a number of seasons' work indicate that this arrangement of the wires in the telescope is more satisfactory than either the single vertical wire or the oblique cross. The double wire is especially effective when the image of the light or heliotrope is large and unsteady.

APPENDIX 4. TRIANGULATION, PAGE, NEBR., TO CANADA AND DULUTH.

175

One of the theodolites used during the season of 1903-4 in Texas and all of the theodolites used thereafter on the ninety-eighth meridian primary triangulation had two pairs of lines, about four minutes apart, in the micrometer microscope. 1 This arrangement saved much time, for, when a reading backward or forward was made by placing one pair of lines on a five-minute graduation of the circle, then the other pair of lines would have to be moved through the space of only one minute to bring it in contact with a second graduation to make the forward or backward reading. With the previous arrangement of only one pair of wires it was necessary to move the wires through a space of five minutes to make the second reading. The readings upon the initial signal were so selected that the mean value of any angle is practically free from errors due to periodic errors of graduation and is almost entirely free from the effects of the run of the micrometers. However, the micromter microscopes were adjusted whenever tests showed that the mean run of the three was more than one second for a five-minute space or when any one micrometer microscope had a run greater than three seconds. 2 Practically all the primary horizontal observations were made on heliotropes or acetylene lamps. At the eastern portion of the arc, extending toward Duluth, some observations were made during cloudy days on short poles placed on the light stand of the signal. This was made practicable by the short lines of this section of the triangulation. PROGRAM OF OCCUPATION OF STATIONS. In the following tables the primary stations occupied during the several seasons are arranged in the order of their occupation. The second column of each table indicates the days on which horizontal observations on primary stations were taken, the third column the number of such days, and the fourth column the approximate height of the instrument above the ground. In using the heliotrope the point observed upon was placed about 1.6 meters above the instrument. There were some exceptional cases where the heliotrope was placed more than this distance above the instrument.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19n.

The average heights of signals for the five seasons at the northern portion of the ninety-eighth meridian between 1903 and 1907, inclusive, are 10.92, 11.56, 17.94, 15.22, and 16.41 meters, respectively. The following table gives the essential facts for each season's work on the ninetyeighth meridian after the year 19or. Similar facts for the triangulation done on the ninety-eighth meridian previous to 1902, and on the thirty-ninth parallel in Kansas, are given on page 368, Appendix No. 6, Report for 1901; and page 223, Appendix 3, Report for 1902.

The letters

S" and ·' N" indicate the southern and northern portions of the ninety-eighth meridian, respectively.

The number of observations of a primary horizontal direction was the same in each of the parties. The work of abstracting the results of the horizontal angles was materially reduced in 1905 by a simple arrangement of the record of observations by which the resulting directions were computed in the record book. A checked copy of the resulting directions was kept by the observer as a duplicate and to guard against loss. In previous seasons the record was practically duplicated in making the abstracts, and this work frequently delayed the progress of the observing party. The ratio of the observing days at a station to the total number of days at the station, between the first and last observations, gives an idea of the weather conditions encountered, whether favorable or otherwise. The higher the percentage the greater is the amount of time favorable for making observations. These percentages are based upon the whole time at the station, Sunday included, although no observations were made on that day. The percentages for the five seasons' work on the northern portion of the ninety-eighth n'ieridian, 1903 to 1907, inclusive, are 77, 89, 77, 87, and 90, respec-

tively. The percentages for the other seasons on the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation varied from 70 to 86. The average number of days on which primary observations were made at a station varied from i.8 to 3.8, with an average of 2.6 for the 11 observing parties. The table shows that there is a tendency toward uniformity. From the fall of 1903 to 1907 the average number of days varied from r .8 to 2.6, with a mean of 2.3 for 8 observing parties. The maximum number of days on which primary observations were made at a station becomes very uniform beginning with the fall of 1903. The maximum number after that varied from three to five. The minimum number of days of primary observations per station was one, except during one season, in which the minimum number was two. The average number of days at a station between the first and last on which primary horizontal directions were measured is 3.2 for the 11 observing parties considered. There has been a slight but gradual decrease in the time spent at a station. The next column shows the time spent between stations after primary horizontal measures were completed at one station and before they were begun at the next. This is largely a matter of transportation. The party with the light outfit could move to the next station and frequently begin observations the same day or night without overworking the members of the party. The parties of King in 1905 in Texas and of the writerin 1907 in Minnesota were running light, with no cook or mess outfit, and the average number of days between stations was 0.2 and o.r, respectively. It is shown in the next column that the number of days per station (obtained by dividing the total number of days during the season, between the dates of the first and last primary horizontal observations of the season, by the number of primary stations occupied) for these two seasons average 3 and 2.1, respectively. The table shows that the number of days per station has a tendency to decrease. The last column is interesting in showing the rates of progress in stations per month. There has been a gradual increase, with an average of 7.8 stations per month for the r l observing parties. The decreased amount of work involved in making the abstracts of the directions beginning with the seasons of l 905, the saving in time by having two pairs of lines in the micrometer microscope (see pages 175 and 180), and the tendency to reduce the camp equipage were factors in increasing the rate of progress. STATEMENT OF COSTS. The following table gives a statement of the unit costs of the different seasons' work on the ninety-eighth meridian, beginning with that of 1902. The weather conditions, ease of access to station and ease of securing supplies, and the amount of building were not very different for the different seasons, except that the last portion of the work done by the party in Minnesota in 1905 extended across a tamarack swamp where travel between stations was very difficult and all the signals were high. The primary triangulation in the vicinity of the Point Isabel base line, in Texas, was done by Assistant 0. B. French, in 1906, while he was there engaged on the measurement of the base. 1 Three of the six stations were occupied during the measurement of the base from the base camp, while the other three stations were occupied after the completion of the base measurements. The observing party used a light camp outfit while occupying the last three stations.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, r9n.

The triangulation of the Point Isabel base net was done at a very small expenditure of time and money. It would be rather difficult to separate the cost of this triangulation from the total cost of all the work done at Point Isabel. As the work was very limited in extent and was done under exceptional conditions, a knowledge of its cost would be of little value for purposes of comparison with that of other seasons' work discussed in this appendix.

The letters" N." and "S." indicate the northcnt and southcnt portions of the ninety-eighth meridian, respectively. were two observing parties in one organization during the seasons of 1902 and 1903-4.

In the above table the two seasons 1906 and 1907 are considered together, for the signals at the 38 stations were all erected in 1906 and it would be difficult to separate the expenses of building into two seasons. There is only one season for which the cost per station occupied differs more than 11 per cent from the mean of all. 1'his is also the only season for which the cost per mile of progress differs more than 1 9 per cent from the mean of all. This is the season of 1905, in Minnesota, where the cost of building signals and of transportation was heavy in working across the tamarack swamp. (See p. 18r.) The cost per station occupied and per mile of progress for this season differed 17 and 33 per cent, respectively, from the mean cost for all of the seasons. It will be noticed that the mean cost per square mile of area covers a wide range and does not give a clear idea of the economics of the work. It is important to note that there are certain more or less fixed costs for each season's work, which are independent of the rate of progress of the building and observing parties. They are the railroad transportation to and from the field, the local transportation between stations of the observing party and of the light keepers by hired teams, the cost of new articles of outfit, the cost of lumber for signals delivered at the stations, and the salary expenses in the period before observations begin and after they end during which

the party is organized and outfitted and is disbanded, respectively. Other things being equal, it appears that the unit cost would be less if the seasons are lengthened, for then some of the fixed expenses would be distributed over more work, and because the members of the party employed only for the season gain in efficiency with experience. The salaries, pay, and subsistence of the members of the observing party and light keepers and the care and feed of horses arc about 35 per cent of the total cost of a season, hence it would require an increase or decrease in the rate of pr0gress of the observing party of l 5 per cent to affect the unit costs by S per cent.

It would be very difficult to obtain similar cost data for the eastern oblique arc, but the unit costs are believed to be close to those for the transcontinental arc.

STATEMENT OF ADJUSTMENTS. No local adjustments of directions were made. The method of supplying missing observations in broken series specified in the general instructions makes such adjustments unnecessary. The lengths and directions of the three sides of the triangle Walnut-Hall-Page southwest base had been fixed by the adjustment published in Appendix 6 of the Report for 1901, "Triangulation northward along the ninety-eighth meridian in Kansas and Nebraska," and their geographic positions as there printed were held fixed. At the eastern end, where the triangulation connects with that of the United States Lake Survey, the length of the Minnesota Point base was adopted as measured. The geographic positions of the terminal stations were finally held fixed, but at first a single adjustment was made of the entire chain of triangulation connecting the triangle WalnutHall-Page southwest base with the measured base at Minnesota Point on the shore of Lake Superior. In this triangulation there was known, in addition to the fixed triangle and the length of the Minnesota Point base, the lengths of the Brown Valley base and the Royalton base as measured in 1906 by Assistant 0. B. French. 3
A few points were occupied in each of two seasons. Seep. :257. Appendix No. 6, Report for 1898.

For convenience, the single adjustment is considered in the three sections into which the base lines naturally divide it. The first section extends from the Page base net to Brown Valley base; the second from the first section to the Royalton base; and the third from the second section to the Minnesota Point base. (See illustrations 1-8.) In this first adjustment there were 193 angle and side equations and 3 length equations, a total of 196. The adjustments of the remainder of the triangulation, that between Fergus Falls and Canada, were made in two sections. The first section extends from the line \Vahpeton-Western to the Stephen base, requiring 67 condition equations. (See illustrations 9 and 10.) The second section extends from the line Donaldson-Deer to the Canadian line, and required the solution of 15 condition equations. (See illustration 1 x.) ADJUSTMENT OF THE DISCREPANCIES IN LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, AND AZIMUTH. After the completion of the adjustment for the primary chain connecting the fixed geographic positions in the Page base net with the triangulation of the United States Lake Survey, the positions were computed through these adjusted triangles. The discrepancy in latitude which developed was o".727 (or 30 meters); in longitude, 1".427 (or 30.3 meters); and in azimuth, 5".94. In other words, the closure of the loop of triangulation through Lakes Superior and Michigan down to the thirty-ninth parallel, westward to the ninety-eighth meridian and northward to Brown Valley and Duluth, a total of 3 400 kilometers, is 42.6 meters in position, or 1 part in 80 ooo. This total discrepancy in loop closure was distributed in the chain of triangulation between the Page base net and Minnesota Point base. The whole discrepancy was thus distributed in only about one-fourth of the entire loop, and probably in the strongest portion. The introduction of the whole loop into the adjustment, or of any considerable portion of it, other than the part used, was impracticable on account of the great amount of computation involved. Not only would such a step have greatly increased the work of making the loop adjustment itself which already included 196 conditions, but it would also have made necessary the recomputation of much triangulation based on the previously adjusted portion of the loop. It will be seen on examining the corrections to the directions or angles, arising from the adjustment of the discrepancies in latitude, longitude, and azimuth, which are shown separately from those arising from satisfying the angle, side and length equations, that in no case does the correction amount to as much as four times the probable error of the direction or angle, and in many cases it is less than the probable error. The probable error of a direction, which is the best test of the wisdom of the method adopted, shows that whereas the probable error of a direction was ±o".38 before distributing the latitude, longitude, and azimuth discrepancies, it was increased to but ±o".51 after the distribution. The maximum correction 1".44 to a direction was increased to but 1 ".65 by this distribution.

199

In the l 2 sections of the ninety-eighth meripian triangulation for which results have been published (including Appendix 5 of this Report) the largest maximum correction in any section was 1."96 and the smallest maximum correction in any section.was o."60. The maximum corrections for the 5 sections treated in this publication vary from 1."44 to o."78. Of the 42 sections of primary triangulation not on the ninety-eighth meridian for which statistics are given in this appendix, pages 231 and 232, there are 12 for which the maximum correction was greater than r. "44 and 6 for which it was less than o. "78. The probable error of an observed direction is

in which .rv2 is the sum of the squares of the corrections to directions and c is the number of conditions. The probable errors, resulting from the figure adjustment, of an observed direction for the six seasons' work at the northern portion of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation are as follows :

is smaller than the section between Fergus Falls and the Stephen base, while the correction for one section is greater than that for the section from Page base net to Brown Valley base, ± o. "45 against ± o. "42. Four average values of dare as follows:
Eastern oblique arc .................................................... Transcontinental triangulation .......................................... Ninety-eighth meridian, all sections ...................................... Ninety-eighth meridian, 5 sections at northern end ....................... ±o. 51 ±o. 44 ±o. 33 ±o. 36

These values were obtained by taking straight means of the values of d by sections. ACCURACY AS INDICATED BY CORRECTIONS TO ANGLES AND CLOSURES OF TRIANGLES. The correction to each angle is the algebraic sum of the corrections to two directions. In order to make it possible to study the corrections to the separate angles, they are shown in the following table for every triangle in the primary scheme from the Page base net to the United States and Canada boundary and to Duluth. There are two columns of corrections to the angles, one for those resulting from the figure adjustment and the other due to the introduction of latitude, longitude, and azimuth equations. (Seep. 184). There are also shown the errors of closure of the triangles, the corrected spherical angles and the spherical excess for each triangle. The plus sign prefixed to the error of closure of a triangle indicates that the sum of the angles is less than 180° plus the spherical excess. The spherical excess is a convenient indication of the size of the triangle, since it is proportional to the area. Wherever no entry is made in the two columns of "Corrections to angles" the angle in question was not measured.

The average closure of a triangle for the other 12 sections of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation is o" .87. The average closure of a triangle for the 680 triangles on the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation is o".92. These average closing errors indicate that the methods employed on the field and the number of observations made give the accuracy called for by the instructions. There are very few closing errors of triangles on the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation greater than 3 ". It does not appear to be advisable to cut down the number of observations, at least in the near future. A decrease in the number of positions from 16 to i 2 would materially increase the average closing error of the triangles and would also increase the number of triangles for which the closing errors are more than 3". For all geographic purposes an average accuracy greater than that now obtained is not necessary, while with some Laplace stations in the scheme 1 it is believed to be sufficient for all geodetic purposes. Greater accuracy could be obtained by making observations over a line on many more days thap at present, and the observer could no doubt obtain smaller errors by

declining to observe on very faint and very unsteady objects, or when the wind causes bad vibrations in the signal on which the instrument is mounted. It is believed, however, that it is more important to accomplish the maximum amount of work of a reasonable accuracy rather than a smaller amount at a greater accuracy. That portion of the general instruction for primary triangulation bearing on this subject states that "In selecting the conditions under which to observe primary directions, proceed upon the assumption that the maximum speed consistent with the requirement that the closing error of a single triangle in the primary scheme shall seldom exceed three seconds, and that the average closing error shall be but little greater than one second, is what is desired rather than a greater accuracy than that indicated with slower progress." Although the parties on the ninety-eighth meridian primary triangulation were not striving for extreme accuracy at the expense of progress, yet the averag~ accuracy of the results as shown by the triangle closures (see also the comparison of probable errors of an observed direction, p. 231) is greater than that for the other great arcs of the United States, the transcontinental triangulation, and the eastern oblique arc. The comparisons of the average closing errors are given below:

No attempt has been made here to set forth the agreement of the separate measures of each direction as a criterion of accuracy, since it is well known that it is of little value for that purpose. A close agreement of the separate measures of a given direction is of little consequence, since such measures are usually subject to constant errors of considerable size, which become evident as soon as the closure of the triangles are studied or an attempt is made to adjust a figure. ACCORD OF BASES. There are five bases which serve to fix the length in the triangulation between Page and Canada and Duluth, viz, the Page, Brown Valley, Royalton, Minnesota Point, and Stephen bases. The accord in length between each of these bases as measured and its value as computed from the triangulation through the adjacent triangles furnishes a valuable test of the accuracy of the triangulation. In solving the normal equations in each section of the figure adjustment the length equation was, as usual, assigned to the last place, so that after all the conditions relating to triangle closures and ratios of length had been satisfied, the discrepancy in length became known. In the following table the discrepancies developed between bases are given in terms of the seventh place of logarithms and are also expressed as ratios. A plus sign before the discrepancy expressed in terms of logarithms means that the first base mentioned is longer as measured, than as computed through the intervening triangulation from the second base mentioned.

Two of these discrepancies are slightly larger than any others in the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation heretofore published, but they are not as great as the discrepancy between the Seguin and Alice bases. (See p. 370 of Appendix s of this Report.)
ACCORD OF AZIMUTHS. Laplace azimuths were computed at three stations of this triangulation, viz, at Minnesota Point north base, at Dalton Astronomic, and at Stephen west base. At the first of these the Laplace azimuth is z".31 larger and at the second o". 75 smaller than the United States Standard azimuth. At Stephen west base it was certain that the Laplace azimuth was more accurate than the geodetic azimuth computed through the ~riangulation and the discrepancy between the United States Standard azimuth and the Laplace azimuth at this station was distributed by means of an azimuth equation. In the solution of the normal equations this azimuth equatioQ was assigned to the last place, and so the discrepancy in azimuth became known after all the conditions relating to triangle closures, ratios of sides, and the length between bases had been satisfied. This discrepancy was 2".25. In other words, if the equation had not been introduced, the United States Standard azimuth would have been too small by 2".25 as judged by the Laplace azimuth instead of agreeing with it, as it now does. STUDY OF ERRORS. Beginning with the season of 1904 each observer on the northern portion of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation kept a record called the Error Book in which he made notes of the weather conditions, the character of the line observed over, and the appearance of the object observed upon. For each period -of observations of primary horizontal angles there were entered in the record the date, with the hour; the direction of the wind; the strength of the wind; the station observed; the intensity, size, and degree of steadiness of the image of the heliotrope or lamp; the character of the image, whether symmetrical or asymmetrical; and the character of the line, whether high, low, grazing, or clear only at night, as a result of elevation by refraction. In a column or remarks, notes were made regarding the condition of the atmosphere, whether clear, hazy, or smoky. The object of keeping this record was to accumulate data from which might possibly be learned the cause or causes of the large, and especially of the unusually large, errors of observation in triangulation. It has been impossible for the author, in the limited time at his disposal for such work, to make a complete analysis of all the accumulated data.

225

As considered in the Error Book, a high line is one with its greater portion elevated well above the ground and obstructions. This usually occurs when the line crosses a depression or valley. A low line passes over a very flat country or just over ridges, trees, houses, or other obstructions. Grazing was the term employed to describe a line which was barely clear during the day. A refraction line was one which was clear only at night as a result of great refraction. A refraction line is, strictly speaking, a grazing line. In the section of 134 directions between Brown Valley base net and Royalton base, 43 per cent of the lines are high, 48 per cent are low, and 9 per cent either grazing or refraction. The average correction to a direction is o".28 for the 134 directions of the section. The average correction to a direction for the 48 per cent of low lines is o" .30, for the 9 per cent of grazing and refraction lines is o".46, and for the four directions over two refraction lines is o".52. Similar data for the 146 directions of the section from Royalton base net to Duluth are: Average correction to a direction for all directions is o".26, for the low lines is 0 11 .30, and for the grazing and refraction lines is o".23. There was only one refraction line and the mean correction to the two directions over it was only o".06. For the section of 154 directions between Fergus Falls and the Stephen base line the average correction to all the directiot;ts is o".26, to directions ovi;r low lines is o".22, and to directions over grazing and refraction lines is o".25. The mean correction to the two directions over the one refraction line of the section is o' '.19. The following table summarizes the data given in the preceding three paragraphs:

In the first section the average correction for a low line is 7 per cent greater than the average for the whole section and 36 per cent greater than the average correction for the high lines. The average correction for the grazing and refraction lines is more than double that for the high lines. In the second section the average correction for a low line is 15 per cent greater than the average for the section and is 25 per cent greater than the average correction for a high line. The average for the grazing and refraction lines is even less than the average correction for a high line.

For this section the average correction to the grazing and refraction lines is o".or smaller than the average correction for all the directions.

In contrast to the other two sections the large corrections appear more frequently, proportionately, on the high than on either the low or the grazing and refraction lines. The evidence given above for high and low lines is so conflicting that no safe conclusions can be drawn from it. The data for the grazing and refraction lines are also conflicting, doubtless due to the small number of directions involved.
SYMMETRICAL AND ASYMMETRICAL OBJECTS.

It is a well-known fact that occasionally the image of the heliotrope or lamp will be asymmetrical. In such an image there is a bright nucleus with a fainter portion of the image extending to the right or left. The records show that in practically every case this less dense or fainter portion of the image is on the side opposite to the direction from which the wind is blowing. If the wind crosses the line from the left, then the image will be asymmetrical toward the right, and vice versa. Of the 134 directions of the section from Brown Valley base net to the Royalton base line, 48 had asymmetrical images during all or some portion of the observations. The average correction to these directions is o".29, while the average correction for the whole section is o".28. Forty of the 146 directions of the section between Royalton base net and Duiuth had asymmetrical images and an average correction of o".27. The correction for the entire section· is o".26. The section of 154 directions between Fergus Falls and Stephen base line had 32 directions with asymmetrical images, and the average correction is o".24, while the average correction for the whole section is o".26. For 17 directions on the section between Brown Valley base net and Royalton base line all of the observations were made on asymmetrical images only. The average correction to these directions is o".34. On the section between Royalton base net and Duluth observations were made on asymmetrical images only, on 12 directions, and the average correction for these directions is o" .36. There were only 4 directions of the section Fergus Falls to Stephen base net for which all observations were made on asymmetrical images only, and the average correction to these 4 directions is o".34. The average corrections for all directions on these three sections are o".28, o".26, and o".26, respectively. Hence the increases in the corrections are 2 l, 38, and 31 per cent, respectively, for the directions-where only asymmetrical images were observed. The table below shows the percentage of the directions observed on asymmetrical and symmetrical images and the frequency with which the large corrections occur on each for the section between the Brown Valley base net and the Royalton base line. In getting these percentages a direction having an asymmetrical image for even only one observing period was classed as asymmetrical regardless of whether the image was symmetrical or not at other observing periods.

vations for ~ach of a number of directions were made in only one observing period. No attempt was made to have observations for a direction or station extend through more than one observing period or more than one day. The accuracy of the 1902 work was high and well within the required limits. On the section between Brown Valley base net and Royalton base line all observations were made over each of 63 directions (46 per cent of all) during only one observing period, afternoon or night, and the average correction for these directions is o".3i. The average correction is o".25 for the remaining 71 directions for which observations were made in more than one observing period. The average correction for the oneperiod directions is 24 per cent greater than the average correction for the other directions. Of the forty-two corrections greater than o".349, twenty-two (52 per cent) occur in the one-period directions, and of the twenty-one corrections greater than o".499, twelve .(62 per cent) occur in the one-period directions. On the section from Royalton base net to Duluth all observations were made over 37 directions (25 per cent of all) during only one observing period, and the average correction for these directions is o".32. The average correction is o".24 for the remaining 109 directions for which observations were made in more than one observing period. The average correction for the one-period directions is 33 per cent greater than the average correction for the other directions. Of the forty-six corrections greater than o".349, sixteen (35 per cent) occur in the one-period directions, and of the seventeen corrections greater than o".499, seven (41 per cent) occur in the one-period directions. On the section from Fergus Falls to Stephen base line, all observations were made over each of 44 directions (29 per cent of all) during only one observing period, and the average corrnction for these directions is o".3i. The average correction is o".24 for the remaining l 10 directions for which observations were made in more than one observing period. The average correction for the one-period directions is 29 per cent greater than the average correction for the other directions. Of the forty-one corrections greater than o".349, fourteen (34 per cent) occur in the one-period directions, and of the twenty-two corrections greater than o".499, nine (41 per cent) occur in the oneperiod directions.

As a rule the corrections to directions over which all observations were made in one observing period are about 30 per cent greater than the corrections to the directions for which observations were made in more than one observing period. Thirty-three per cent of the directions had observations in only one observing period, while 41 per cent of the corrections greater than o".349 and 46 per cent of the corrections greater than o" .499 occur in these directions. It is reasonably certain that the average correction to a direction would be materially reduced by distributing the observations of a direction over more than one observing period and that the number of large errors would thereby be considerably reduced.
SUMMARY OF SOURCES OF ERRORS.

Primary horizontal observations were made on the heliotrope as soon as it became sufficiently distinct to make paintings, and observations were made on lights at night whenever they were visible. Observations were also made during winds which caused decided vibrations in the tripod on which the theodolite was mounted. The progress was slow under this condition. Observations were sometimes made during strong winds by making the pointings during the occasional short lulls. The wires placed on an object during one of the lulls would move off as much as 20 seconds during the hard puffs and would vibrate badly, but when there was another let-up in the force of the wind the wires would again cover the object. It was noticed that the twist of the signal caused by wind was least when its direction was normal to a side of the triangle formed by the three legs of the tripod. The tendency of the signal to resume its original position after having been twisted by the wind was due to the fact that the structure was under a strain caused by the bowing of the legs during its erection. (See pp. 829 to 840 and 824, Appendix 4, Report for 1903.) From the above discussion it would appear that errors in observing horizontal directions are increased by (a) low lines, (b) asymmetrical images of the object observed, heliotrope or lamp, (c) making all observations of a direction in only one observing period. Other sources of error are, no doubt, large accidental errors of pointing made when the image is very faint or very unsteady and large accidental errors made when the instrument is unsteady from strong wind blowing against the supporting structure.

The instrument was elevated at least 10 feet at each station on the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. This brought the line of sight well above the disturbed layers of air near the ground in the vicinity of the station and added to the apparent steadiness of the object observed. Each observer followed strictly the instructions which require that "in selecting the conditions under which to observe primary directions proceed upon the assumption that the maximum speed consistent with the requirement that the closing error of a single triangle in the primary scheme shall seldom exceed three seconds, and that the average closing error shall be but little greater than one second, is what is desired rather than a greater accuracy than that indicated with slower progress." Greater accuracy could be obtained, but it would be at the sacrifice of progress and economy. This does not seem to be justifiable. (See pp. 222 and 223.) ACCURACY OF THE PRIMARY TRIANGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. In the following table 59 sections of triangulation in the United States, for which the required tabular values can be conveniently obtained, have been arranged in order of accuracy, the most accurate being placed first. The most severe, and therefore the best, test of accuracy is believed by the writer to be the quantity d expressing the probable error of the observed direction as derived from the corrections to directions resulting from the figure adjustment; accordingly the various sections of tri!lngulation have been placed in the order of the values of d. In the few cases in which d is the same to the nearest hundredth of the second for several sections, the next column, a, has been used to decide their relative rank. The method of computing d and a has already been explained fully on pages 199 and 222.

TRIANGULATION, PAGE, NEBR., TO CANADA AND DULUTH.

Of the 59 sections of triangulation tabulated, the five sections of the northern portion of the ninety-eighth meridian rank as numbers 16, 23, 29, 31, and 38. The mean d for all five sections is o".36, which falls between 28 and 31 in the above list. The 12 other sections rank as numbers 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 15, 17, 24, 28, 34, and 41. The mean d for the 17 sections in the ninety-eighth meridian is o".33 which falls between numbers 15 and 17 in the list. The average accuracy of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation is about equal to that of the best half of the triangulation previously done in the United States. EXPLANATION OF POSITIONS, LENGTHS, AND AZIMUTHS, AND OF THE UNITED ST ATES STANDARD DATUl\1. The lengths, as already fully explained in connection with the adjustments, all depend upon the Page, Brown Valley, Royalton, Minnesota Point, and Stephen bases. The lengths as given are all reduced to sea level. If the actual length of a line simply reduced to the horizontal is desired, it may be obtained with all the accuracy ordinarily needed by adding to the sea level length as given a correction= (length of line as given) mean elevation of the two ends of the line in meters]. The maximum value of this [ 6370000 correction does not exceed 1 o+flu for the length of any portion of the triangulation here published. The maximum error made in the use of the above approximate formula for the correction does not exceed :nrnhinr for the length of any portion of this triangulation. The positions-that is, the latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths-need special explanation. All of the positions and azimuths have been computed upon the Clarke spheroid of 1866, as expressed in meters, which has been in use in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for many years. After a spheroid has been adopted and all the angles and lengths in a triangulation have been fully fixed, it is still necessary, before the computation of latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths can be made, to adopt a standard latitude and longitude for a specified station and a standard azimuth of a line from that station. For convenience, the adopted standard position (latitude and longitude) of a given station, together with the adopted standard azimuth of a tine from that station, is catted the geodetic datum. The primary triangulation in the United States was commenced at various points and existed at first as a number of detached portions in each of which the geodetic datum was necessarily dependent only upon the astronomic stations connected with that particular portion. As examples of such detached portions of triangulation there may be mentioned the early triangulation in New England and along the Atlantic coast, a detached portion of the transcontinental triangulation centering on St. Louis and another portion of the same triangulation in the Rocky Mountain region, and three separate pprtions of triangulation in California in the latitude of San Francisco, in the vicinity of Santa Barbara Channel, and in the vicinity of San Diego. With the lapse of time these separate pieces have expanded until they have touched or overlapped. The transcontinental triangulation, of which the office computation was completed in 1899, joins atl .of the detached portions mentioned and makes them one continuous triangulation. As soon as this took place the logical necessity existed of discarding the old geodetic data used in these various pieces and substituting one for the whole

234

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 191r.

country, or at least for as much of the country as is covered by continuous triangulation. To do this is a very heavy piece of work, and involved much preliminary study to determine the best datum to be adopted. On March 13, 1901, the Superintendent adopted what is now known as the United States Standard Datum, and it was decided to reduce the positions to that datum as rapidly as possible. The datum adopted was that formerly in use in New England, and therefore its adoption did not affect the positions which had been used for geographic purposes in New England and along the Atlantic coast to North Carolina, nor those in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The adopted datum does not agree, however, with that used in The Transcontinental Triangulation and in The Eastern Oblique Arc of the United States, publications which deal primarily with the purely scientific problem of the determination of. the figure of the earth and which were prepared for publication before the adoption of the new datum. As the adoption of such a standard datum is a matter of considerable importance, it is in order here to explain the desirability of this step more fully. The main objects to be attained by the geodetic operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are, first, the control of the charts published by the Survey; secbnd, the furnishing of geographic positions (latitudes and longitudes) of accurately determined elevations, and of distances and azimuths, to officers connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey and to other organizations; third, the determination of the figure of the earth. For the first and second objects it is not necessary that the reference spheroid should be accurately that which most closely fits the geoid within the area covered, nor that the adopted geodetic datum should be absolutely the best that can be derived from the astronomic observations at hand. It is simply desirable that the reference spheroid and the geodetic datum adopted shall be, if possible, such a close approximation to the truth that any correction which may hereafter be derived from the observations which are now or may become available shall not greatly exceed the probable errors of such corrections. It is, however, very desirable that one spheroid and one geodetic datum be used for the whole country. In fact, this is absolutely necessary if a geodetic survey is to perform fully the function of accurately coordinating all surveys within the area which it covers. This is the most important function of a geodetic survey. To perform this function it is also highly desirable that when a certain spheroid and geodetic datum have been adopted for a country they be rigidly adhered to, without change, for all time, unless shown to be largely in error. In striving to attain the third object, the determination of the figure of the earth, the conditions are decidedly different. This problem concerns itself primarily with astronomic observations of latitude, longitude, and azimuth, and with the geodetic positions of the points at which the astronomic observations were made, but is not concerned with the geodetic positions of other points fixed by the triangulations. The geodetic positions (latitudes and longitudes) of comparatively few points are therefore concerned in this problem. However, in marked contrast to the statements made in preceding paragraphs, it is desirable in dealing with this problem that, with each new important accession of data, a new spheroid fitting the geoid with the greatest possible accuracy, and new values of the geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths of the highest degree of accuracy, should be derived. 1'he United States Standard Datum was adopted with reference to positions furnished for geographic purposes, but has no reference to the problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. It is adopted with reference to the engineer's problem

of furnishing standard positions and does not affect the scientist's problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. The principles which guided in the selection of the datum to be adopted were: First, that the adopted datum should not differ widely from the ideal datum for which the sum of the station errors in latitude, longitude, and azimuth should each be zero; second, it was desirable that the adopted datum should produce minimum changes in the publications of the Survey, including its charts; and, third, it was desirable, other things being equal, to adopt that datum which allowed the maximum number of positions already in the office registers to remain unchanged, and therefore necessitated a minimum amount of new computation. These considerations led to the adoption as the United States standard of the datum which had been in use for many years in the northeastern group of States and along the Atlantic coast as far as North Carolina. An examination of the station errors available in 1903, on the United States Standard Datum, at 246 latitude stations, 76 longitude stations, and 152 azimuth stations, scattered widely over the United States from Maine to Louisiana and to California, indicated that this datum approaches closely the ideal with which the algebraic sum of the station errors of each class would be zero. 1 The adopted United States Standard Datum, upon which the positions and azimuths given in this publication depend, may be defined in terms of the position of the station Meades Ranch as follows:

"

Points are then said to be upon the United States Standard Datum when they are connected with the station Meades Ranch by a continuous triangulation, through which the corresponding latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths have been computed on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, as expressed in meters, starting from the above data. The principal lists of geographic positions heretofore published on the United States Standard Datum throughout the whole United States are contained in the following publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and of other organizations: . Appendix 8 of the Report for 1885, positions in Massachusetts and Rhode Island; Appendix 8 of the Report for 1888, positions in Connecticut; Appendix 8 of the Report for r 893, positions in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland; Appendix 10 of the Report for 1894, positions in Massachusetts; Appendix 6 of the Report for l 901, positions in Kansas and Nebraska; Appendix 3 of the Report for r902, positions in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Colorado; Appendix 4 of the Report for r903, positions in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas; Appendix 9 of the Report for 1904, positions in California; Appendix 5 of the Report for 1905, positions in Texas; Appendix 3 of the Report for l 907, positions in California; Appendix 5 of the Report for 1910, positions i11 California; in Appendix EEE, pages 2905-303 r, Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers, r 902, positions of points on and near the Great Lakes; in the publications of the Massa· chusetts Harbor and Land Commission; and in various bulletins of the United State! Geological Survey. In the present report, in addition to this appendix, there are twc other appendices giving positions on the standard datum-Appendix 5, positions ir Texas, and Appendix 6, positions in Florida.
1 This is further borne out in the reduction of 765 astronomic stations in connection with the "Supplementary investiiiatio1 in 1909 of the fiiiure of the earth and isostasy," by]. F. Hayford, published by tbe Coiut and Geodetic Survey.

TABLES OF POSITIONS.
In the tables of positions the latitude and longitude of each point are given on the United States Standard Datum (see p. 233), also the length and azimuth of each line observed over, whether in one or both ways. Along with the latitude and longitude of each point the lengths and azimuths are given of lines from that point to other points of the triangulation. No lengths or azimuths are repeated, and for a given line the length and azimuth will generally be found opposite the position of the last mentioned of the two stations involved. For the convenience of the draftsman a column of "seconds in meters" is given, in which is placed the length (in meters) of each small arc of a meridian or parallel corresponding to the seconds of the given latitude or longitude. To facilitate further the use of the tables, a column is given of the logarithms of the lengths. It must be remembered that it is the logarithm which is derived first from the computation, the lengths given in this table being then derived from the corresponding logarithms. The rule followed in recent publications of this Office has been to give latitudes and longitudes to thousandths of seconds for all points the positions of which are fixed by fully adjusted triangulation. Points, the positions of which are given to hundredths of seconds only, are marked by footnotes as being without check (observed from only two stations) or checked by verticals only. In the columns giving azimuths, distances, and logarithms of distances, the accuracy is indicated to a certain extent by the number of decimal places given, it being understood that in each case two doubtful figures are given. In some cases there is very little doubt of the correctness of the second figure from the right, while in a few cases some doubt may be cast on the third figure from the right. These tables may be conveniently consulted by using as finders the I I sketches at the end of this appendix, and the index on pages 325 to 342. In the third column of the index will be found for each point a reference to the page on which its description is given, in the fourth column the number of the sketch on which it appears, and in the fifth colµmn the page on which its elevation above sea level will be found.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS. This list may be conveniently consulted by reference to the illustrations at the end of this publication or to the index. All azimuths given in these descriptions are reckoned continuously from true south around by west to 360°, south being o 0 , west 90°, north 180°, and east 270°. Where magnetic azimuths are given they are indicated as such. In general the surface and underground marks are not in contact, so that a disturbance of the surface mark will not necessarily affect the underground mark. The underground mark should be resorted to only in cases where there is evidence that the surface mark has been disturbed. The dates and initials given in each description immediately after the county refer to the date of establishment of the station, the man by whom it was established, and the date when the station was last visited. Any person who finds that one of the stations herein described has been disturbed, or that the description no longer fits the facts, is requested to send such information to the Superintendent, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D. C.

APPENDIX 4. TRIANGULATION, PAGE, NEBR., TO CANADA AND DULUTH. GENERAL NOTES REGARDING THE MARKING OF STATIONS.

267

NoTE r.-The station was marked as follows: A hole was dug to a depth of 4U feet, its diameter being 18 inches for the upper 2 feet and 1 2 inches for the remaining distance. A terra-cotta pipe 2 feet long and 4 inches in diameter was placed in the lower part of this hole, and the pipe and the surrounding hole then filled with concrete made of Portland cement, sand, and broken rock. A 60-pennywire nail was set vertically in the top of this pipe, its point projecting one-fourth inch above the concrete and marking the station. A 6-inch layer of sand was then placed in the hole. Directly over the underground mark and extending from the sand to the surface of the ground was set a piece of pipe similar to the one already described. The surface mark was the point of a 60-penny wire nail set in the concrete which fills this pipe and the surrounding hole, and covers the pipe to the depth of half an inch. The reference mark was a piece of terra-cotta pipe 2 feet long and 4 inches in diameter set in a hole 1 foot in diameter, both pipe and hole being filled with concrete. The top of the pipe was level with the surface of the ground. A 60-penny wire nail was set in the top of the pipe and projects one-fourth inch above it. NoTE 2.-The manner of marking this station was similar to that described in note i, except that instead of terra-cotta pipes there were used iron pipes, 2 feet long and of the diameter given in the particular description. NOTE 3.-The station is marked underground by a tack in the center of the cork of a stone jug, buried at a depth below the top of the surface stone varying from 2.25 to 3.2 feet. The surface mark is a marble post, 2.5 feet long and 8 inches square on top. Cut in its top are two V-shaped grooves at right angles to each other, and the letters

u.s.c.s.

NOTE 4.-This station was established by the Mississippi River Commission in the survey of the Mississippi River, and was marked by their usual tile and pipe station mark, the underground mark being a vitrified tile with a copper bolt set in its upper end, and the surface mark an iron pipe surmounted by a brass cap, suitably inscribed. This statism is published in the Report of the War Department, 1899, part 5, p. 3389 or 3390. NoTE 5.-This station is marked by a 3-inch red metal cap, somewhat curved, and lettered as follows: "U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey B. M. $250 fine or imprisonment for disturbing this mark." This cap is screwed on a 4-foot (or 4U-foot) iron pipe set in the ground and usually cemented at the base, from 4 to 6 inches being exposed above the ground. The base of the pipe is split and spread to a diameter of about 1 foot. A square or small circft! is cut in outline in the center of the cap. NOTE 6~-The underground mark at this station is a copper tack in the cork of a stone jug; above this was placed the surface mark, a nail in the top of a 4 by 6 inch pine stub. NoTE 7.-Marked with the regular station mark of the Missouri River Commission, the underground mark being a block of stone 18 inches square about 3 feet below the surface of the ground, and having a small drilled hole in it. The surface mark is an iron pipe with a cast-iron cap having a raised triangle on it with a small drilled hole in its center. The cap is lettered "U. S. Missouri River Commission."

These zenith distances were corrected for height of the object observed and of instrument so as to refer them all to the ground at each station, or to the station marks. The difference of elevation of each pair of stations in the main scheme was then computed from the observations over the line joining them, by the formula

in which h 2 and h1 are elevations of the stations, ( 2 and ( 1 are the measured zenith distances, s is the horizontal distance between the stations, and p is the radius of curvature. As there are always two or 'more lines to each new station, many rigid conditions existed between the observed differences of elevation, even if the connections with the precise leveling were ignored, and the least square adjustment furnishes the readiest accurate means of deriving the required elevations. The elevations from the stations of the Page base net northward to the international boundary and eastward to the Minnesota Point base at Duluth were adjusted in four sets of equations. The first adjustment involved all stations of the primary scheme on either side of the Brown Valley base from station Mound at the south to station Foss at the north. The second adjustment involved all stations of the primary scheme between the stations of the Page base net in northern Nebraska to the station Mound of the first adjustment. The third adjustment fixed the elevations of all stations of the primary scheme between station Foss of the first adjustment, and the Minnesota Point base on Lake Superior.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19u.

The fourth adjustment fixed the elevations of the primary stations of the Fergus Falls to Canada section of the triangulation. In the first adjustment the elevations of stations Mound, Oscarson, and Foss were held fixed at 634.87, 317.56, and 297.24 meters, respectively, 1 these being the elevations as fixed by precise leveling. The difference of elevation between the two ends of the Brown Valley base was held as determined by the precise leveling, namely, 7.70 meters and the difference 8.44 meters computed from the measured zenith distances was rejected. The elevations of the two ends of the base and of the nine remaining stations connected by the observations are unknowns to be determined by least squares from the 3 l observed differences of elevation indicated below. In the following tabulation the observed differences of elevation treated in the first adjustment are shown, together with their adjusted values. The weight, p, assigned to each observed difference of elevation is inversely proportional to the square of the length, s, of the line between stations in meters and was conveniently computed by the formula log P= 9- 2 logs. The observed difference of elevation is given the sign of the elevation of the second station named minus the elevation of the first. The quantity contained in the last column but one is the correction to be subtracted from an observed difference of elevation to obtain the adjusted difference of elevation.

The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from this first adjustment is ±0.85 meter. In other words, the reciprocal observations over a line 3i.7 kilometers (19?{ miles) long, this being the length of the line corresponding to unit weight, determined the difference of elevation of two points with such a degree of accuracy that it is an even chance whether the error is greater or less than 0.85 meter. The probable errors for lines of other lengths were assumed to be proportional to their lengths. The probable errors of the elevations of the three stations fixed by precise leveling are about ± 0.04 meter. The probable error approaches this value for stations adjacent to those fixed by precise leveling and is greatest for the most remote stations. Of the elevations least accurately determined, those of the stations Brown Valley northwest base and Brown Valley southeast base have a probable error of ±0.24 meter from the vertical angle measures, alone or when combined with the probable error of the elevations fixed by the precise leveling, it was still ±0.24 meter. The results of the second adjustment in which the stations concerned are those from the Page base net in northern Nebraska to stations Mound and Helgen of the first adjustment, are shown below in the form used for the first adjustment.

In this second adjustment, nine stations were taken as fixed. Five stations of the Page base net-Hall, Old, Prairie, Page southwest base, and Page northeast basehad been fixed by a previous adjustment, their elevations being 624.53, 577.92, 596.55, 626-49, and 580.84 meters, respectively. These are the elevations set forth on pages 422 and 423 of Appendix 6, Report for 1901, corrected by - 14 centimeters to take account of the effect of new leveling subsequently introduced into the precise level net. In addition to Mound and Helgen with elevations of 634.87 and 593.15 meters, respectively, derived from the first adjustment, stations Hansen and Crane had been fixed by precise leveling; their elevations being 529.58 and 565.82 meters, respectively. The elevations of the 2 8 remaining stations indicated by the observations are the 28 unknowns determined by least squares from the 74 observed difference of elevation given in the above table.

The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from the adjustment is ±0.39 meter. Unit weight corresponds to reciprocal observations over a line 31.7 kilometers (19%' miles) long. The probable error of the stations fixed by precise leveling is about ± 0.04 meter. Station Elm Springs was assumed to be the one least accurately determined, and its probable error was therefore computed as a limiting value and was found to be ±0.26 meter from the vertical angles alone, or, when combined with the probable error of the elevations fixed by the precise leveling, it was ±0.26 meter. In other words, for the least accurately determined station in the main scheme between the Page base net and the station Mound, there is an even chance that the elevation is correct within 0.3 meter or I foot, and for most stations in the main scheme the accuracy is greater than this. The elevations of the stations of the main scheme from Wahpeton at the south and west, to Minnesota Point north and south bases at the north and east were obtained from the third adjustment, as shown in the tabulation below. The elevations of Foss, Oscarson, Elbow, Dalton, Alexandria, and Osakis were held fixed at 297.24, 317.56, 390.09, 423.32, 451.28, and 428.43 meters, respectively, these being the elevations as fixed by precise leveling. 1 The elevations of Royalton .north base and Royalton south base were held fixed at 348.23 and 324. 17 meters, respectively, as determined by the leveling made at the time the base was measured and by a short trigonometric connection with P. B. M. back base having an elevation of 323.292 meters. 1 The elevation of Carlton was held fixed at 376.61 l meters from a short trigonometric connection with P. B. M. 5, whose elevation from precise leveling is 332.219 meters. 1 Two additional elevations were held fixed from the precise leveling as follows: "P. B. M. Court House" at Aitkin and "B. M. Iron Bay Iron Works" at West Duluth with elevations 370.810 and 191.707 meters, respectively, and the nonreciprocal observations connecting these with the three or four stations of the main scheme were used in this adjustment with a weight 0.3 of that assigned to corresponding lines of the main scheme and over which reciprocal observations were obtained:

In this third adjustment the elevations of the 44 remaining stations indicated by the observations are the 48 unknowns determined by least squares from the 109 observed differences of elevation given in the above table. The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from this adjustment is ±0.42 meter. Unit weight corresponds as in the other adjustments to reciprocal observatio~s over a line 31.7 kilometers long. ' Station Wright was selected as being most remote from the stations determined by precise leveling, and the probable error computed for its elevation is ± o. 1 9 meter from the vertical angle measures alone. This probable error, combined with the probable error of stations fixed by precise leveling, becomes ±0.2 meter. The results of the fourth adjustment, in which the stations concerned are those from the line Wahpeton-Western to the Canadian border, are shown below in the form used for the first adjustment.

In this fourth and last adjustment the elevation of nine stations were taken as fixed. The stations Wahpeton and Western had been fixed by the third adjustment, their elevations being 294.63 and 340.40 meters, respectively. Stations Indian, Borup, Wicklow, Sherack, Argyle, and Stephen west base were held fixed from the results of precise leveling, their elevations being 425.91, 277. 14, 277. 10, 262.64, 259.89, and 253.60 meters, respectively. These elevations were obtained from the elevations of the following bench marks of the precise level net, viz, E 4 , E 5 , K 0 , D6 , 0 0 , and T 0 , their elevations being 422.000, 277.500, 276.442, 262.523, 260.331, and 253.713 meters, respectively. These bench marks are located near the triangulation stations in each case and the small difference in the height between the bench mark and the station determined with a vertical angle was adopted without correction. The difference of elevation between the two ends of the Stephen base line, as determined by the leveling over the line, and the elevation of Stephen east base, 268.62 meters, were adopted. The elevations of the remaining 29 stations indicated by the observations are the 29 unknowns determined by least squares from the 86 observed differences of elevation in the above table.

The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from this adjustment is ±0.58 meter. Unit weight corresponds as in the other adjustments to reciprocal observations over a line 31.7 kilometers long. Station States may be assumed to be the one least accurately determined and its probable error, if computed, would probably not exceed ±0.4 meter when combined with the probable error of the elevations fixed by precise leveling. ELEVATIONS. The datum for all the elevations is mean sea level. The stations are in three classes: First those fixed directly by the spirit leveling, and of which the elevations are subject to a probable error of ±0.04 meter; second, the stations in the main scheme fixed by reciprocal measures of vertical angles and which are subject to probable errors varying from ±0.1 to ± 0.4 meter, and the third, the intersection stations, of which the elevations are fixed by measurements of vertical angles which are not reciprocal, the intersection stations not being occupied, and whose elevations are subject to probable errors which may be as great as ± 2 meters in some cases. The accuracy with which each elevation in the main scheme is determined depends mainly upon the remoteness of that station from the nearest one of which the elevation is fixed by spirit leveling, as indicated in class I of the following table. Station States is probably least accurately determined of all the stations in the main scheme. For a table to be used in converting feet to meters, or vice versa, see page 236.

TRIANGULATION ALONG THE NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN, SEGUIN TO POINT ISABEL, TEX.
By A. L.
l3ALDW1N'

Computer, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

GENERA!., STATEMENT. During November and December, 1904, and January, 1905, a triangulation party under the direction of Mr. W. H. Burger, assistant, extended the primary triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian from the line Serita-Stockdale, on which the triangulation of the preceding winter had closed, to the Alice base line. The line SeritaStockdale is the southern limit of the first figure to the southward of the Seguin base net. During October and November, 1905, a similar party under the direction of Mr. Harold D. King, assistant, connected the line Elliff-Nolan of the triangulation of 1904-5 with the Laguna Madre base line on the Gulf of Mexico. The line Elliff-Nolan comprises one side of the third figure north of the Alice base line. This section of the triangulation is almost at right angles to the ninety-eighth meridian, and was determined upon after an examination had been made of the coast triangulation, which is less than half a degree to the eastward and parallel to the triangulation proposed along the meridian. This coast triangulation extends nearly south from the Laguna Madre base line to Point Isabel, a distance of about 180 kilometers (112 miles). It consists of 15 quadrilaterals, and all the observations were made by Mr. R. E. Halter, assistant, in the years 1877 to 1880. Although scarcely more than tertiary in the character of the observations, it is supplemented by an accurate base line at each end, and has a Laplace station at its southern extremity to control the azimuth. It was adjusted and the results arc set forth in this appendix. The Point Isabel base figure, comprising six stations, connects the Point Isabel base line with the line Fronton-Cameron of the coast triangulation. The observations were made by Mr. 0. B. French, assistant, in March and April, 1906. The length of the triangulation here discussed, measured along the ninety-eighth meridian, is 235 statute miles, and the number of primary stations occupied is 38. The primary triangulation along this meridian was complete at the south end when the Point Isabel base net was finished, in April, l 9o6. The results of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation from the vicinity of the Page base in the northern part of Nebraska to the junction with the portion published

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19rr.

in this appendix, have already been published,1 and Appendix 4 of this report contains the results of the triangulation between the Page base and the Canada boundary. The engineer who wants only the necessary information to enable him to extend this triangulation, or to base other surveys upon it, will find the information he desires in the latter part of this appendix, commencing with the explanation of the tables of positions, lengths, and azimuths. The index printed at the end of the appendix, used in connection with the sketches, will enable him to find quickly the data he desires for any given locality. The progress made in the primary triangulation in the season of 1 903-4 in Texas, which was commented upon 2 as being up to that time probably the most rapidly and economically executed triangulation of that grade of accuracy, appears to be exceeded in economy and closely approached in speed of execution by the primary triangulation reported upon in this appendix. This redounds to the credit of the three officers who executed the triangulation. The reconnoissance for the primary scheme., beginning with the. line. Serita-Stockdale and extending to the Alice base, with the connection to the Laguna Madre base., was executed in two short seasons, September 20 to November 4, 1904, and December 26, 1904, to January 12, 1905, by Signalman Jasper S. Bilby. On this reconnoissance he. traveled alone by means of a light one-horse buggy, and carried a small outfit. The field organization for the season 1904-5 consisted, in addition to the recoonoissancc party, of a building party, one observing party, and four light keepers. The building party, consisting of a foreman and three hands under the direction of Mr. Bilby, erected the observing towers in advance of the observing party and marked the stations in a permanent manner. The observing party consisted of an observer, who was also the chief of party, a foreman, hand, and cook. The signals used in all the primary triangulation on .this southern portion of the ninety-eighth meridian were identical with those used in 1902 and described in Appendix 4 of the Report for 1903· The instrument used by both Mr. Burger and Mr. King was theodolite No. 145, a direction instrument with a horizontal circle 12 inches in diameter. 3 All paintings for horizontal angles were made by using two parallel vertical lines about 20" apart in the diaphragm of the telescope. The arrangement of the pointing lines in the micrometer microscopes and the method of making the paintings are. the same as described on pages 248-249 of Appendix 5, Report for 1905. The four light keepers were directed by letter and by code signals sent in a modified Morse alphabet, using the lamps and heliotropes in signaling. The general instructions issued to the chiefs of the observing parties are published in Appendix 4 of this report. All the primary observations were made in accordance with these general instructions. The field organization for the season 1905 was similar to that for the season 1904-5, except that the building party completed the erection of signals before the observing

was begun, and the observing party with Mr. Bilby as foreman had only a recorder, and its entire outfit was moved in one large farm wagon. The number of light keepers was five. The notable feature of this season's work was the extent to which acetylene lamps were used. During the entire season heliotropes were used for two positions only and on only one primary horizontal direction. The field organization for the season of I 906 was unique. Mr. 0. B. French, assistant, was able, because of the length of the lines, to interrupt the base-line campaign on which he was entering and to occupy three of the six stations of the Point Isabel base figure from one camp. The observations were made on lights almost entirely. At only one station were any daylight observations made. Six nights of observing completed the observations at the six stations. PROGRAM OF OCCUPATION OF STATIONS. In the following three tables the primary stations occupied during the several seasons are arranged in the order of their occupation. The second column of each table indicates the days on which horizontal observations on primary stations were taken, the third column the number of such days, and the fourth column the approximate height of the instrument above the ground. ·

STATEMENT OF ADJUSTMENTS. No local adjustments were made, these having become unnecessary since the adoption of the present method of supplying missing observations in broken series. The quadrilateral formed by the stations Lavernia-Thomas-Stockdale-Serita, the observations for which were made at the close of the season of 1903-4, forms a part of the first adjustment. The length and direction of the line Lavernia-Thomas had been fixed by the adjustment of the section of triangulation between the Lampasas base net and the Seguin base. 1 The figure adjustments were made in three sections. The first se.::tion comprised the quadrilateral mentioned in the preceding paragraph together with all the triangulation of the seasons of 1904-5 and 1905 and served to connect the line LaverniaThomas of the Seguin base net with the Alice and the Laguna Madre base lines (see illustrations Nos. 1, 2, and 3); the second section comprised only the Point Isabel base net (see illustration No. 7); and the third section served to connect this base net with three points of the first section, including the ends of the Laguna Madre base line, and comprises the coast triangulation of the seasons 1877 to 1880. (See illustrations Nos. 4, 5, and 6.) The lengths of the Alice and Laguna Madre base lines had been fixed by base measurement. The length published for the Alice base, as reduced to sea level on the supposition that the elevation of Alice east base above mean sea level was 60 meters, is 6 971.688 meters. 2 The assumed elevation, 60 meters, was the best that was available

for Alice east base at the time the report upon thP. base measurements was published. When the triangulation was completed to the Gulf in 1905, the adjustment of the vertical observations determined the elevation of this point to be 42 .3 l meters. This decreased the computed reduction to sea level by 0.0196 meter, and made the reduced length of the base line 6 97z.7076 meters. The length of the Laguna Madre base was determined by measurements made by a party under the direction of Mr. R. E. Halter, assistant, in April, 1882, using the 4-meter secondary contact-slide steel bars, designated as bars Nos. 5 and 6. A measure in each direction was made with this apparatus; the first measure gave 5 486.869 meters and the second measure s 486.841 meters. A mean of the two measures, 5 486.855 meters, was adopted as the length of the base. No sea-level correction was applied, as the mean elevation of the line was approximately only 2 meters above mean sea level. In this first adjustment the direction and length of the line Lavernia-Thomas, the length of the Alice base, the length of the Laguna Madre base, and the direction of the line Alice-Wood were held fixed. Station Alice is a Laplace point, the geodetic station having been occupied as an astronomical longitude and azimuth station. The Laplace azimuth 1 of the line Alice-Wood was computed and held fixed at 276° 47' 23".79. A Laplace azimuth 1 (also called a true geodetic azimuth) as used in this publication is one computed at a station of the triangulation from coincident longitude and azimuth observations, using the Laplace equation: (Astronomic azimuth - Laplace azimuth)+ sine of latitude (astronomic longitude - geodetic longitude)= zero. In the following condition equations the numbers assigned to the directions correspond to those shown in illustrations Nos. l to 7. The number of a direction inclosed in parentheses, thus (1), means the required correction to that direction. In each set of condition equations, those which refer to closures of triangles are given first, the azimuth equation next, then the equations which refer to ratios of sides, and the length equations last. In the solution of the normal equations, however, the azimuth equation was assigned a place immediately preceding the length equation. (See p. 371 .) In the side and length equations the absolute term is expressed in units of the sixth decimal place of logarithms. The work of making the difficult least square adjustments was done by Mr. M. H. Doolittle and Mr. E. H. Bowen. CONDITION EQUATIONS.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19u.

The maximum correction to a direction in the first section adjusted was 1".09 to the direction from Mathis to Elliff. The maximum in the second section was o".60 to the direction from Point Isabel west base to Point Isabel south base. The maximum in the third section, consisting of the tertiary triangulation along the coast, was 4".87 to the direction from Singer to Armadillo. The probable error of an observed direction is
d= ±0.674.JF

in which v2 is the sum of the squares of the corrections to the directions and c is the number of conditions. The probable error for an observed direction for the first section is ±o".36. Or, separating the triangulation according to seasons, the probable error of a direction for the season 1904-5 is ±o".41, and for the season 1905, ±011 .25. The probable error for an observed direction for the second section is ±o".25. The probable error of a direction being the best test of the accuracy of triangulation, these probable errors place the triangulation of the season 1905 and that of the Point Isabel base net among the best sections of triangulation yet reported in the United States. This is shown in the table printed on page 231 of Appendix 4 of this report. ACCURACY AS INDICATED BY CORRECTIONS TO ANGLES AND CLOSURES OF TRIANGLES. The correction to each angle is the algebraic sum of the corrections to two directions. In order to make it possible to study the corrections to the separate angles, they are shown in the following table for every triangle in the main scheme from Seguin base net to Laguna Madre base, from Laguna Madre base to Point Isabel base net, and in the Point Isabel base net. There are also shown the error of closure of the triangles, the corrected spherical angles, and the spherical excess. The plus sign prefixed to the error of closure of a triangle indicates that the sum of the angles is less than 180° plus the spherical excess. The spherical excess is a convenient indication of the size of the triangle since it is proportional to the area.

The maximum correction of any angle of the primary triangulation is 1 ".42 to the angle at Choate between Bryde and Karnes. The mean error of an angle, a= .J~~ (in which l'J 2 is the sum of the squares of the closing errors of the triangles and n is the number of triangles) was computed for

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1911.

each section of the primary triangulation. For the first section the mean error of an angle is ±o".72, and for the second section ±o".40. Separating the first section adjusted, into the two seasons, we have the following facts of interest: For the season of 1904-5 the mean error of an angle is ±o".78, the maximum closing error of a triangle 3".25, and the average closing error l ".04. For the season of 1905 the mean error is ±o".62, the maximum closing error of a triangle 11 11 2 .23, and the average closing error 0 .85. Similar statistics for the second section, the season of 1906, show a maximum closing error of a triangle of 1 ".61 and an average closing error of o".50. THE ACCORD OF BASES. There are four bases which serve to fix the lengths in the triangulation under discussion, viz, the Seguin, Alice, Laguna Madre, and Point Isabel. The accord in length between each of these bases as measured and its value as computed from the triangulation through the adjacent triangles furnish valuable tests of the accuracy of the triangulation. In solving the normal equations in each section of the figure adjustment the length equation (where one exists) was, as usual, assigned to the last place, so that the discrepancy in length after all the conditions relating to closures of triangles and ratios of sides had been satisfied, became known. In the following table the discrepancies developed between bases are given in terms of the seventh decimal place of logarithms, and are also expressed as ratios. A plus sign before a discrepancy expressed in terms of logarithms means that the first base mentioned is longer as measured than as computed through the intervening triangulation from the second base mentioned. There is also given for comparison in the table the discrepancies between bases of seven sections of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation for which the results have already been published.

ACCORD IN AZIMUTH. The introduction of Laplace azimuths is novel in adjustments of primary triangulation in the United States. Such azimuths are usually of a much higher degree of accuracy than the geodetic azimuth directly computed through the triangulation. The geographic positions along the ninety-eighth meridian as far south as Lavernia-Thomas had already been computed on the United States Standard Datum (see below) and are not subject to change. At the three Laplace stations-Salina west base, Bowie northwest base, and Austin-the United States standard azimuth was greater than the Laplace azimuth by 4".9, 6".8, and 9".3, respectively. ·It is not certain, however, that the Laplace azimuth at Austin is more accurate than the geodetic azimuth computed through the triangulation. The station was not occupied in the triangulation, and the observations from the main scheme were secondary in character. Although it was not known what amount of twist might still be in the triangulation at Lavernia-Thomas, it was determined to distribute it by means of an azimuth equation, and in this manner to make the United States standard azimuth at Alice equal to the Laplace azimuth. This azimuth equation in the solution of the normal equations was assigned a position next preceding the length equation, so that the discrepancy in azimuth, after all the conditions relating to closures of triangles and ratios of sides had been satisfied, became kt?-own. At Alice the discrepancy in azimuth amounted to 1 11 .22, the Laplace azimuth being greater than the United States standard azimuth by that amount. This means that the assumed twist in azimuth undenvent a change in sign and became almost insignificant in size. In a similar manner, a Laplace azimuth was held fixed at Fronton, a station of the Point Isabel base net. The azimuth discrepancy, after all the conditions of triangle closure and ratios of sides through the tertiary triangulation of the third section had been satisfied, was l l ".07. The azimuth computed through the triangulation was smaller than the adopted Laplace azimuth for the line Fronton-Cameron, which was held fixed at 134° 1o' 33".51. ERRORS AND COST. A study of the errors developed in the primary triangulation has been made by Mr. William Bowie, assistant, inspector of geodetic work, in Appendix 4 of this report. In the same appendix (p. 181) Mr. Bowie has also computed the cost for the various seasons of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, and has included therein the cost data for these sections. · EXPLANATION OF POSITIONS, LENGTHS, AND AZIMUTHS, AND OF THE UNITED STATES STANDARD DATUM. The lengths, as already fully explained in connection with adjustments, all depend upon the Seguin, Alice, Laguna Madre, and Point Isabel bases. The lengths as given are all reduced to sea level. If the actual length of a line simply reduced to the horizontal is desired it may be obtained with all accuracy ordinarily needed by adding to the sea level length as given a correction= (length of line as given) mean elevation of the two ends of the line in meters]. [ 6370000 The maximum value of this correction does not exceed v>rtlfll" for the length of any

portion of the triangulation here published. The maximum error made in the use of the above approximate formula for the correction does not exceed mm11lf for the length of any portion of this triangulation. The positions-that is, the latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths--need special explanation. All of the positions and azimuths have been computed upon the Clarke spheroid of 1866, as expressed in meters, which has been in use in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for many years. After a spheroid has been adopted and all the angles and lengths in the triangulation have been fully fixed, it is still necessary, before the computation of latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths can be made, to adopt a standard latitude and longitude for a specified station and a standard azimuth for a line from that station. For convenience, the adopted standard position (latitude and longitude) of a given station, together with the adopted standard azimuth of a line from that station, is called the geodetic datum . . The primary triangulation in the United States was commenced at various points and existed at first as a number of detached portions in each of which the geodetic datum was necessarily dependent only upon the astronomic stations connected with that particular portion. As examples of such detached portions of triangulation there may be mentioned the early triangulation in New England and along the Atlantic coast, a detached portion of the transcontinental triangulation centering on St. Louis and another portion of the same triangulation in the Rocky Mountain region, and three separate portions of triangulation in California, in the latitude of San Francisco, in the vicinity of Santa Barbara Channel, and in the vicinity of San Diego. With the lapse of time these separate pieces have expanded until they have touched or overlapped. The transcontinental triangulation, of which the office computation was completed in 1899, joins all of the detached portions mentioned and makes them one continuous triangulation. As soon as this took place the logical necessity existed of discarding the old geodetic data used in these various pieces and substituting one for the whole country, or at least for as much of the country as is covered by continuous triangulation. To do this is a very heavy piece of work, and involved much preliminary study to determine the best datum to be adopted. On March 13, 1901, the Superintendent adopted what is now known as the United States Standard Datum, and it was decided to reduce the positions to that datum as rapidly as possible. The datum adopted was that formerly in use in New England, and therefore its adoption did not affect the positions which had been used for geographic purposes in New England and along the Atlantic coast to North Carolina, nor those in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The adopted datum does not agree, however, with that used in The Transcontinental Triangulation and in The Eastern Oblique Arc of the United States, publications which deal primarily with the purely scientific problem of the determination of the figure of the earth and which were prepared for publication before the adoption of the new datum. As the adoption of such a standard datum is a matter of considerable importance, it is in order here to explain the desirability of this step more fully. The main objects to be attained by the geodetic operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are: First, the control of the charts published by the Survey; second, the furnishing of geographic positions (latitudes and longitudes), of accurately determined

APPENDIX 5. TRIANGULATION, SEGUIN TO POINT ISABEL.

373

elevations, and of distances and azimuths to officers connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey and to other organizations; third, the determination of the figure of the earth. For the first and second objects it is not necessary that the reference spheroid should be accurately that which most closely fits the geoid within the area covered nor that the adopted geodetic datum should be absolutely the best that can be derived from the astronomic observations at hand. It is simply desirable that the reference spheroid and the geodetic datum adopted shall be, if possible, such a close approximation to the truth that any correction which may hereafter be derived from the observations which are now or may hereafter become available shall not greatly exceed the probable errors of such corrections. It is, however, very desirable that one spheroid and one geodetic datum be used for the whole country. In fact, this is absolutely necessary if a geodetic survey is to perform fully the function of accurately coordinating all surveys within the area which it covers. This is the most important function of a geodetic survey. To perform this function it is also highly desirable that when a certain spheroid and geodetic datum have been adopted for a country they be rigidly adhered to without change for all time, unless shown to be largely in error. In striving to attain the third object, the determination of the figure of the earth, the conditions are decidedly different. This problem concerns itself primarily with astronomic observations of latitude, longitude, and azimuth, and with the geodetic positions of the points at which the astronomic observations were made, but it is not concerned with the geodetic positions of other points fixed by the triangulations. The geodetic positions (latitudes and longitudes) of comparatively few points are therefore concerned in this problem. However, in marked contrast to the statements made in the preceding paragraph, it is desirable in dealing with this problem that, with each new important accession of data, a new spheroid fitting the geoid with the greatest possible accuracy, and new values for the geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths of the highest degree of accuracy, should be derived. The United States Standard Datum was adopted with reference to positions furnished for geographic purposes, but has no reference to the problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. It is adopted with reference to the engineer's problem of furnishing standard positions, and does not affect the scientist's problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. The principles which guided in the selection of the datum to be adopted were: First, that the adopted datum should not differ widely from the ideal datum, for which the sum of the station errors in latitude, longitude, and azimuth should each be zero; second, it is desirable that the adopted datum should produce minimum changes in the publications of the Survey, including its charts; and, third, it is desirable, other things being equal, to adopt that datum which allowed a maximum number of positions already in the office registers to remain unchanged, and therefore necessitated a minimum amount of new computation. These considerations led to the adoption as the United States Standard of the datum which had been in use for many years in the northeastern group of States and along the Atlantic coast as far as North Carolina. An examination of the station errors available in 1903, on the United States Standard Datum, at 246 latitude stations, 76 longitude stations, and 1 52 azimuth stations scattered widely over the United States from Maine to Louisiana and to California,

indicated that this datum approaches closely to the ideal in which the algebraic sum of the station errors of each class would be zero. 1 The adopted United States Standard Datum, upon which the positions and azimuths given in this publication depend, may be defined in terms of the position of the station Meades Ranch as follows:

Points are then said to be upon the United States Standard Datum when they are connected with the station Meades Ranch by continuous triangulation, through which the corresponding latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths have been computed on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, as expressed in meters, starting from the above data. The principal lists of geographic positions heretofore published on the United States Standard Datum throughout the whole United States are contained in the following publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and of other organizations: Appendix 8 of the Report for 1885, positions in Massachusetts and Rhode Island; Appendix 8 of the Report for 1888, positions in Connecticut; Appendix 8 of the Report for 1893, positions in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland; Appendix 10 of the Report for 1894, positions in Massachusetts; Appendix 6 of the Report for 1901, positions in Kansas and Nebraska; Appendix 3 of the Report for 1902, positions in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Colorado; Appendix 4 of the Report for 1903, positions in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas; Appendix 9 of the Report for 1904, positions in California; Appendix 5 of the Report for 1905, positions in Texas; Appendix 3 of the Report for 1907, positions in California; Appendix 5 of the Report for 1910, positions in California; in Appendix EEE, pages 2905-3031, Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers, 1902, positions of points on and near the Great Lakes; in the publications of the Massachusetts Harbor and Land Commission; and in various bulletins of the United States Geological Survey. In the present report, in addition to this appendix, there are two other appendixes giving positions on the standard datum-Appendix 4, positions in Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and Minnesota, and Appendix 6, po.sitions m Florida. TABLES OF POSITIONS, AZIMUTHS, AND LENGTHS. In the tables of positions the latitude and longitude of each point are given on the United States Standard Datum (seep. 371), also the length and azimuth of each line observed over, whether in one or both ways. Along with the latitude and longitude of each point the lengths and azimuths are given of lines from that point to other points of the triangulation. No lengths or azimuths are repeated, and for a given line the length and azimuth will generally be found opposite the position of the last mentioned of the two stations involved. For the convenience of the draftsman a column of "seconds in" meters" is given, in which is placed the length (in meters) of each small arc of a meridian or parallel correl This is further borne out in the reduction ol 765 astronomic stations in connection with the "Supplementary investiptloa in 1909 of the fi11ure of the earth and isostasy," by], F. Hayford. published by the Coast and Geodetic Survey.

sponding to the seconds of the given latitude or longitude. To facilitate further the use of the tables, a column is given of the logarithms of the lengths. It must be remembered that it is the logarithm which is first derived in the computation, the lengths given in this table being then derived from the corresponding logarithms. The rule followed in recent publications of this Office has been to give latitudes and longitudes to thousandths of seconds for all points the positions of which are fixed by fully adjusted triangulation. Points, the positions of which are given to hundredths of seconds only, are marked by footnotes as being without check (observed from only two stations) or checked by verticals only. In the columns giving azimuths, distances, and logarithms of distances the accuracy is indicated to a certain extent by the number of decimal places given, it being understood that in each case two doubtful figures are given. In some cases there is very little doubt of the correctness of the second figure from the right, while in a few cases some doubt may be cast on the third figure from the right. These tables may be conveniently consulted by using as finders the seven sketches at the end of this appendix and the index on pages 41 I to 414. In the third column of the index will be found for each point a reference to the page on which its description is given, in the fourth column the number of the sketch on which it appears, and in the fifth column the page on which its elevation above sea level will be found. For the convenience of those who wish to convert the distances given in this table or the elevations given later on from meters into feet the following conversion table is here inserted :

DESCRIPTION OF STATIONS. This list may be conveniently consulted by reference to the illustrations at the end of this publication or to the index on page 41 l. All directions in the descriptions given in the form of azimuths are reckoned continuously from the south around by the west to 36o 0 , west being 90°, north 180°, and east 270°. The azimuths are true; where magnetic bearings are given they are indicated as such. Usually the surface and underground marks are not in contact, so that a disturbance of the surface mark will not, in general, affect the underground mark. The underground mark should be resorted to only when there is evidence that the surface mark has been disturbed. Any person who finds that one. of the stations here described has been disturbed or that the description no longer fits the facts is requested to send such information to the Superintendent, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D. C.
GENERAL NOTES IN REGARD TO STATION MARKS.

NOTE i.-A hole was dug 18 inches in diameter to a depth of 2 feet, then l foot in diameter to a depth of 4_% feet. In this was set the lower or underground mark, a 2inch iron pipe, 2 feet long; the hole was then filled level with the top of the pipe with a concrete made of Portland cement, sand, and broken rock. The pipe was filled with concrete and a 60-penny steel wire nail was set in the center of the top, with its point projecting one-fourth inch, to mark the center of the station. Over this was placed 6 inches of sand. Then the surface mark, a similar piece of pipe, was plumbed directly over the lower mark, and the hole and pipe filled with concrete level with the surface. A 60-penny steel wire nail set in the center of the top of this pipe with its point projecting marked the center of the station. The top of the concrete was then covered with onehalf inch of cement, on which were inscribed the letters U. S. C. & G. S. and the year. The reference mark was an iron pipe, 2 feet long, set in a hole l foot in diameter, surrounded and filled with concrete, with a 60-penny wire nail projecting one-fourth inch above the top of the pipe, which was level with the surface of the ground. NOTE 2.-'fhe station was marked by a subsurface mark and a surface mark. The subsurface mark consisted of a piece of terra-cotta sewer pipe, 4 inches in diameter and 2 feet long, filled with concrete and encased in a cylinder of concrete 1 foot in diameter and 2 feet long. In the center of its top is embedded a 60-pcnny steel spike, head down, the point of the spike projecting about one-fourth inch above the surface and marking the center. It is 2~ feet below the surface of the ground, the bottom of the pipe being 4,% feet below the surface. ' Above the whole is placed a layer of sand 6 inches deep. Resting on this layer of sand is placed the surface mark, consisting of another piece of terra-cotta sewer pipe, 4 inches in diameter and 2 feet long, filled with concrete and embedded in a cylinder of concrete 18 inches in diameter and 2 feet long. In the center of its top is placed a 60-penny steel spike, head down, its point projecting about onefourth inch above the surface of the concrete, which was finished with one-half inch of neat cement mortar and marked with the letters U. S. C. & G. S. 1905. The point of the spike marks the center of the station and is very little above the surface of the grqund. The reference mark is a cylinder of pipe and concrete similar to the subsurface

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19u.

mark, placed with its top even with the surface of the ground. The point of a steel spike, in the cement, is the reference mark, and it is nowhere less than 10 meters from the station. NOTE 3.-The station was marked by a concrete pyramid or coral rock buried 3 to 4 feet below the surface of the ground and having in its top a drill hole filled with lead. Above the underground mark was placed a cedar stub with a copper tack in its top, the stub projecting from 6 to 18 inches above the surface of the ground. Four reference stubs were placed around the station at the distances given, on lines intersecting at the center in approximate right angles; these stubs were usually of cedar. Non~ 4.-The station was marked the same as in note 3, except that there was no center stub at the surface, its place being taken by the signal, which was a scantling set in the ground and well braced.

B., 1867).-0n the first and highest hill going north from the Boca Chica Bridge; about 70 meters from the Gulf shore, and opposite the seventh telegraph pole, counting from the bridge; this telegraph pole has a copper nail driven into it. The hill is covered with grass, and is on the western side of the railway track. The station was marked with a mesquite post, 3 feet long, its top projecting 6 inches above the surface of the ground; a copper nail was driven in its top. Rio Grande Observatory (Cameron County, Tex., W. E. G., 1854; 1867).-0n a barren sand hill about l 5 feet above tide water, on the American side of the mouth of the Rio Grande. The station was marked by a monument of masonry, cross lines marking the center. In l 867 the cross lines were gone, what was probably only the base of the monument remaining; its center was considered the center of the station. The hill on which the station was standing being in danger of washing away, was protected with planking. · Mesena 2 (Cameron County, Tex., R. E. H., 1885).-About 4_%' miles west from Point Isabel Lighthouse; near the shore of the Laguna Larga. The station is reached from Point Isabel by following the road to Brownsville for 4 miles, to where it forks, one branch following the Laguna Madre, and the other or left-hand branch approaching the shore of the Laguna Larga, and traversing the long hill on which the station is situated; this hill is nearly abreast of the point where the right-hand road recedes from the shore of the Laguna Madre, and viewed from the forks of the road is the most prominent hill in sight. The center mark was the bottom of a beer bottle buried 2;4 feet below the surface of the ground, while 10 inches below the surface four beer bottles were placed l foot from the center on lines intersecting at right angles; a mesquite stub was placed for a surface mark. In l 905 the apparent location of the station was recovered, as indicated by three signal stakes and three instrument stakes, but no other marks were recovered. McManus (Cameron County, Tex., R. E. H., 1885).-About 8 meters from the railroad on the north side of the road. The station was marked by a mesquite stub projecting 8 inches above the surface of the ground, and by 4 brickbats placed around and against it, 2;4 feet below the surface. Kingsbury (Cameron County, Tex., R. E. H., 1885).-About 2;4 meters from and on the north side of the railroad. The station was marked with a piece of brick with a triangle on its side buried 2;4 feet below the surface of the ground, over which was placed a mesquite stub, with its top l foot above the ground. Tank (Cameron County, Tex., R. E. H., 1885).-At the Resaca, near the water tank, and about 2 inches from the south side of the track. Marked by a stub. Egan (Cameron County, Tex., R. E. H., 1885).-0n the south side of and 2;4 meters from the railroad. It was marked by a triangle cut in a brick and buried 2;4 feet below the surface of the ground; above the brick was placed a mesquite stub. The three theodolite stubs were left standing. VaJ,/s (Cameron County, Tex., R. E. H., 1885).-0n the south side of the railroad and about 2;4 meters from it. It was marked by a triangle cut in a brick buried 2;4 feet below the surface of the ground; above it was placed a mesquite stub. Gomilla (Cameron County, Tex., R. E. H., 1885).-0n the south side of and about 2;4 meters from the railroad. The underground mark was a triangle cut in the side of a brick; the surface mark was a mesquite stub.

Sherwood (Cameron County, Tex., R. E. H., 1885).-About 3 meters from the south side of the railroad; marked with a mesquite stub. Forto (Cameron County, Tex., R. E. H., 1885).-0n the north side of and about 20 meters from the railroad, in a cultivated field owned by Emile Forto, and rented to a Mexican. The station was marked by a beer bottle buried 2U feet below the surface of the ground; above this was placed a mesquite stub, projecting 1 foot above the ground, and having a copper tack in its top. Garrison (Cameron County, Tex., R. E. H., 1885).-0n the Fort Brown reservation adjoining the city of Brownsville; in the vicinity of the Artillery quarters, being 200 feet from the northeast corner of the Artillery barracks, and 536 feet from the southeast corner of the magazine. The station was marked by a beer bottle buried upright 2U feet below the surface of the ground. One foot below the ground were placed four other beer bottles, in a horizontal position, their heads close to the station and pointing to it. The station was marked with a mesquite stub projecting 1 inch above the ground. Brownsville (Cameron County, Tex., E. D. P., 1885).-In the military post southeast of the town of Brownsville. The northeast comer of the post hospital was distant 160.4 feet in azimuth 82° 20'; the southeast corner 154.4 feet in azimuth 64° 03'; the azimuth of the garrison flagpole was 104° 45', and of the northernmost tower of the cathedral at Matamoras, 30° 32'. The station was marked by a large iron cap buried 2 feet underground. Astronomical observations were made on a pier built of wooden posts.

COMPUTATION, ADJUSTMENT, AND ACCURACY OF ELEVATIONS. The zenith distances directly observed at each station were first computed and were corrected for height of object observed and of instrument, so as to refer them all to the station marks. The difference of elevation of each pair of stations in the main scheme where zenith distances had been observed was then computed from the observations over the line joining them by the formula

h.i- hi= s tan U .((2 - (1 )

[1 + h.i2p +hi+ s2,,z] 12r-

in which h2 and h1 are the elevations of the stations, ( 2 and ( 1 are the measured zenith distances, s is the horizontal distance between the stations, and p is the .radius of curvature. As there were always two or more lines to each new station, many rigid conditions existed between the observed differences of elevation, even if the connections with the precise leveling were ignored, and the least square adjustment furnishes the readiest accurate means of deriving the required elevations. The elevations of the stations in the main scheme from Lavemia and Thomas at the north to Elliff at the south, and from these stations eastward to Mustang, Padre, and Aransas Lighthouse on the Gulf coast, were obtained from a single adjustment, as shown in the tabulation below. The elevations of I,avemia and Thomas were held fixed at 237.79 and 227.38 meters, respectively, these being the elevations as fixed by the adjustment of the vertical angles

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1911.

in the adjoining section of trianguiation. 1 The elevations of Laguna Madre south base: and of Aransas life-saving station were held fixed at 1.779 and zero meters, respectively. In the following tabulation the observed differences of elevation treated in the adjustment are shown, together with their adjusted values. The weight, p, assigned to each observed difference of elevation is inversely proportional to the square of the length, s, of the line between stations in meters and was conveniently computed by the formula log p= 9 - 2 log s. The observed difference of elevation is given the sign of the elevation of the second station named minus the elevation of the first. . 'fhe quantity contained in the last column but one is the correction to be subtracted from an observed difference of elevation to obtain the adjusted difference of elevation.

The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from the adjustment is ±o.88 meter. In other words, the reciprocal observations over a line 3r.7 kilometers (19% miles) long, this being the length of the line corresponding to unit weight, determined the difference of elevation of two points with such a degree of accuracy that it is an even chance whether the error is greater or less than o.88 meter. The probable errors for lines of other lengths were assumed to be proportional to their lengths. The probable errors of the elevations of the two stations fixed by direct connection with sea level are about ± 0.05 meter. The probable error approaches this value for stations adjacent to those so fixed and for the stations adjacent to Lavemia and Thomas which are adjacent to the Seguin base, where there is a connection with the precise leveling. Station O'Neill was assumed to be the least accurately determined and its probable error was therefore computed as a limiting value and was found to be ± 0.39 meter from the vertical angle measures alone, and when combined with the probable error of the elevations fixed by spirit leveling, it was not changed. In other words, for the least accurately determined station in this portion of the main scheme, there is an even chance that the ekvation is correct within 0.39 meter or 1.3 feet, and for most of the stations in the main scheme the accuracy is greater than this. The elevations of the four stations-Reynolds, Alice, Wood, and Alice cast basewere then obtained from a single adjustment as shown in the tabulation below. The elevation of station Elliff was held as fixed by the preceding adjustment at 31.07 meters. The line of precise levels run in connection with the measurement of the Alice base in 1900 served to furnish the difference in elevation between east base and west base at 9.44 meters, which was adopted in preference to the differencc 9.74 meters from the observed vertical angles.

The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from the above adjustment is ± o. l 2 meter. In other words, the reciprocal observations over a line 31.7 kilometers (19% miles) long, this being the length of line corresponding to unit weight, determined the difference of elevation of two points with such a degree of accuracy that it is an even chance whether the error is greater or less than 0.12 meter. The probable errors for lines of other lengths were assumed to be proportional to their lengths. The probable error of Alice, the station most remote from Elliff, may be stated to be less than ± 0.39 meter, the limiting value computed for station O'Neill. The distance from the stations fixed by connection with sea level is almost the same and the probable error of the connecting lines less than for O'Neill. In other words, for the least accurately detemiined station in this portion of the main scheme there is an even chance that the elevation is correct within 0.39 meter or l .3 feet, and for the four other stations in the main scheme the accuracy is greater than this. ELEVATIONS. The datum for all elevations is mean sea level. The stations are in three classes: First, those fixed by direct connection with sea level. The elevations in this class are subject to a probable error of ±0.05 meter. Second, the stations in the main scheme fixed by reciprocal measures of vertical angles and which are subject to probable errors varying from ±0.1 to ±0.4 meter. Third, the intersection stations, of which the elevations are fixed by measurements of vertical angles which are nonreciprocal, the intersection stations not being occupied. These elevations are subject to probable errors which may be as great as ± 2 meters. The accuracy with which each elevation in the main scheme is determined depends mainly upon the remoteness of that station from the nearest one of the stations whose elevation is fixed by direct connection with sea level, as indicated in Class I of the following table, or on its remoteness from the nearest of the two stations, Lavemia and Thomas, which stations are adjacent to the Seguin base where there is a connection with precise leveling. Station O'Neill was assumed to be the least accurately determined of the stations in the main scheme.

TRIANGULATION ALONG THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA, AND ON THE FLORIDA KEYS.
By
HUGH

C. MITCHELL,

Computer, Coast aml Geodetic Survey.

GENERAL STATEMENT. The main and in fact the only large purpose of this publication is to present to the engineering public as complete a list as possible of the trigonometrical data along the east coast of Florida, on the Florida Keys, and from l<'ernandina inland to Gainesville. This triangulation presents no unusual geodetic features, is not of primary degree of accuracy, was done under methods now largely superseded (except that which was done since 1900), and consequently offers little or no material for discussion. If its scientific value be small, on the other hand its practical value is large, for it offers to the engineer and to the geographer the positions of a large number of points determined trigonometrically and all correlated on one geodetic datum, known m;; the United States Standard Datum. (Seep. 422.) THE TRIANGULATION. In describing the triangulation and the computation thereof it behooves us to be as brief as possible, not entering into any of those details of field or office work which characterize and greatly enhance in value our publications of primary triangulation results, but dwelling only in a general way on the historical aspects of the work, touching lightly on the computations made in reducing and correlating the observations, and then proceeding to the main body of the appendix: The list of geographic positions with explanation thereof, followed by as complete description<> as are available of the stations and their markings, and all supplemented by a st>ries of sketches and an index, by the aid of which it is possible to find at once all data relating to a given station, or to locate with ease the trigonometrical data in any given locality. The observations involved in this triangulation were begun as early as 1849, and extend to as late a date as June, 1911, at which time the geodetic connection between Key West and Dry Tortugas was established. Ordinarily, triangulation which has been done many years prior to the date of the publication of its results is largely reduced in value to the engineer by the loss of stations, either through the destroying agencies of time or the building agencies of man. In many cases the engineer fails to recover a station which still exists, and still possesses its original geographic value; this failure may be due to changes in the surrounding topography, or to the destruction of surface and reference marks; the whole appearance of things around the station may be so changed that the description no longer fits the facts, but the station mark-probably

only the underground mark-may still remain in place, undisturbed and unmoved since it was set in place years before and its geographic position determined. Digging at the proper place would discover the mark and recover the station, but without the guidance of the reference marks or of the local topography to help in finding the point, it can be recovered only by relocating the point within a few feet by means of triangulation carried from near-by or even distant triangulation stations. This may be accomplished by intersecting lines from near.by stations, obtaining the needed directions from the table of azimuths, or it may sometimes be more easily accomplished by establishing a temporary station (such as a flag in a tree) in the immediate vicinity of the old station, as near as can be determined, and then obtaining the position of this temporary station by triangulation from other stations whose recovery is certain. The geographic position of the temporary station can then be compared with that of the old station, their linear relation determined, and offsets measured to the spot indicated by the comparison as the probable location of the old station. During the years 1905 to 1909 an officer of this Survey visited the localities of the various stations included in this appendix with the view of providing a sufficient number of recoverable triangulation stations along the coast to completely control any topographic or hydrographic surveys that might be undertaken. Many old stations were not recovered by this officer-some of them, it was determined, had been destroyed by nature or by man; others, it seemed probable, still existed, but the expense of cutting trees and brush, and other expenses incident to a complete search, were so great as to put a limit to the search made for them. Many stations were recovered, the marks, one 9r both, being still intact, some reference marks being still in existence-in many cases the local topography being still determinate in character. Such stations were usually re-marked in a more permanent manner, and complete and up-to-date descriptions made of them. In some cases, unfortunately not rare, the recovery of the station was uncertain, only a part of the marks being recovered, their identification being uncertain, and in some cases the marks found did not tally with those named in the original description. In such cases it was assumed that the station was recovered, and it was re-marked in a permanent manner. The recovery or nonrecovery of such a station can be proven only by using it in connection with a sufficient number of other stations of known positions to insure that if it be a nonrecovery a discrepancy will develop which will serve as an index. A caution is always placed in the description of such a station, and it should be heeded. Such a station should always be used in connection with at least two other stations whose positions are known, and whose integrity is unquestioned. In some localities where insufficient stations to provide the required control were recovered, new triangulation was executed. This new triangulation always depended on old stations. for positions and lengths; no more of this new triangulation was done than was needed to provide the required control. In addition to this systematic revision work for the purpose indicated above, there are in various localities triangulations of recent date done in connection with special surveys of limited extent, this including the connection of astronomic stations with the main triangulation, and work done in connection with local hydrographic surveys. There are also included in this appendix the results, computed at this Office, of the resurvey of the St. Johns River, made since 1900 by the United States Engineers.

APPENDIX 6. TRIANGULATION IN FLORIDA.

421

The latest work included in this appendix is the geodetic connection between Dry Tortugas and the main Florida Keys. This connection, made by means of signals placed on shoals and reefs, was completed in 1911, and makes it possible to include in the list of positions published on the United States Standard Datum all geographic positions in the vicinity of Dry Tortugas. It will be seen from the sketches at the end of this appendix that the triangulation consisted, as a rule, of a chain of quadrilaterals with all angles observed. In the revision work of 1905-1909 concluded angles were used extensively. Along one section of the beach, length measures made with long wires were substituted for triangles; positions were carried ahead by means of these beach measures, the horizontal angles in the traverse being measured. Rough checks were had by an imperfect scheme of triangles, which usually had one point unoccupied. These beach measures were made between the Indian River and Miami. Traverse of a high degree of accuracy was measured along the railroad between Baldwin and Cedar Keys, the results of this traverse only as far west as Gainesville being included in this appendix. ADJUSTMENT OF THE TRIANGULATION.
It is proposed here to make only a general statement of the adjustment of the triangulation, giving rather a geographic description of the various chains and loops than a technical discussion of the methods used in making the adjustments; that is, in distributing the discrepancies which were developed in the computation of the triangulation. From stations of the eastern oblique arc above Atlanta a chain of primary triangulation extends down to Augusta, Ga.; this chain was adjusted in the ordinary way to eliminate discrepancies of triangle closures and ratios of lengths. From Augusta, Ga., to Beaufort, S. C., there extends a primary traverse, which was so adjusted as to bring out an observed azimuth at Beaufort. Thus adjusted this triangulation and traverse were held fixed, not being altered in any way because of any loop into which they subsequently entered. In a similar manner the triangulation extending down the coast from Beaufort to Fernandina, Fla., the triangulation from Fernandina to Baldwin, part way across the. Florida peninsula, and the traverse from Baldwin to Cedar Keys on the Gulf coast of Florida, were held fixed after being adjusted for discrepancies of triangle closures, ratios of sides and lengths, and made to conform to observed azimuths. In other words, all discrepancies except those developed in closing loops of triangulation were eliminated, and when loop closures were developed the portiOns of triangulation mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs were held fixed, receiving none of the correction thereby made necessary. The chain of triangulation (including a small section of measured traverse) along the Gulf coast between Cedar Keys and Mobile Bay, which is on the Eastern Oblique Arc, was then adjusted, holding fixed the triangulation at Mobile Bay, at Cedar Keys, and all observed azimuths and measured lengths along the coast. In a similar manner the chain of triangulation, and sections of measured traverse extending down the east coast of Florida, around Cape Sable, and up the west coast to Cedar Keys was adjusted, holding fixed the triangulation at Fernandina. at Cedar Keys, and all observed azimuths, and measured lengths.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19rr.

In each of these two pieces of triangulation all observed azimuths were held fixed and the triangulation adjusted to them, it being reasonably certain that the observed azimuths were superior to any that might be computed through the triangulation. All measured lengths were also held. The discrepancies remaining in the triangulation after all conditions noted above had been satisfied were distributed along the weaker sections of the triangulation by means of latitude and longitude equations, it being believed that the character of the triangulation warranted this, and that the corrections fell close to where they belonged. This also made considerable saving in the computation. The spur of triangulation extending out to Key West and thence to Dry Tortugas was adjusted in the usual manner, as was also the triangulation of the St. Johns River, except that triangulation of two periods covering the same portion of the St. Johns River had to be correlated. All observed azimuths and measured lengths were held. The geodetic connection with the triangulation of Dry Tortugas was made through a single point (Rebecca Shoal Lighthouse), through which was carried the United States standard latitude, longitude, and azimuth, but no length. The lengths of lines west of Rebecca Shoal Lighthouse were fixed by a base measured on one of the Dry Tortugas keys. THE UNITED STATES STANDARD DATUM. All of the positions and azimuths have been computed upon the Clarke spheroid of 1866, as expressed in meters, which has been in use in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for many years. After a spheroid has been adopted and all the angles and lengths in a triangulation have been fully fixed, it is still necessary, before the computation of latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths can be made, to adopt a standard latitude and longitude for a specified station and a standard azimuth of a line from that station. For convenience, the adopted standard position (latitude and longitude) of a given station, together with the adopted standard azimuth of a line from that station, is called the geodetic datum. The primary triangulation in the United States was commenced at various points, and existed at first as a number of detached portions in each of which the geodetic datum was necessarily dependent only upon the astronomic stations connected with that particular portion. As examples of such detached portions of triangulation there may be mentioned the early triangulation in New England and along the Atlantic coast, a detached portion of the transcontinental triangulation centering on St. Louis and another portion of the same triangulation in the Rocky Mountain region, and three separate portions of triangulation, in California in the latitude of San Francisco, in the vicinity of Santa Barbara Channel, and in the vicinity of San Diego. With the lapse of time these separate pieces have expanded until they have touched or overlapped. 'l'he Transcontinental Triangulation, of which the office computation was completed in 1899, joins all of the detached portions mentioned and makes them one continuous triangulation. As soon as this took place the logical necessity existed of discarding the old geodetic data used in these various pieces and substituting one datum for the whole country, or at least for as much of the country as is covered by continuous triangulation. To do this is a very heavy piece of work, and involved much preliminary study to determine the best datum to be adopted. On March 13, 1901, the Superintendent adopted what is now known as the United States Standard Datum, and it was decided to reduce the positions to that datum as rapidly as possible. The datum adopted was that formerly in use in New England, and therefore its adoption did not

APPENDIX 6. TRIANGULATION IN FLORIDA.

affect the positions which had been used for geographic purposes in New England and along the Atlantic coast to North Carolina, nor those in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The adopted datum does not agree, however, with that used in "The Transcontinental Triangulation" and in "The Eastern Oblique Arc of the United States," publications which deal primarily with the purely scientific problem of the determination of the figure of the earth and which were prepared for publication before the adoption of the new datum. As the adoption of such a standard datum is a matter of considerable importance, it is in order here to explain the desirability of this step more fully. The main objects to be attained by the geodetic operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are, first, the control of the charts published by the Survey; second, the furnishing of geographic positions (latitudes and longitudes), of accurately detern1ined elevations and of distances and azimuths, to officers connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey and to other organizations; third, the determination of the figure of the earth. For the first and second objects it is not necessary that the reference spheroid should be accurately that which most closely fits the geoid within the area covered, nor that the adopted geodetic datum should be absolutely the best that can be derived from the astronomic observations at hand. It is simply desirable that the reference spheroid and the geodetic datum adopted shall be, if possible, such a close approximation to the truth that any correction which may hereafter be derived from the observations which are now or may hereafter become available shall not greatly exceed the probable errors of such corrections. It is, however, very desirable that one spheroid and one geodetic datum be used for the whole country. In fact, this is absolutely necessary if a geodetic survey is to perform fully the function of accurately coordinating all surveys within the area which it covers. This is the most important function of a geodetic survey. To perform this function it is also highly desirable that when a certain spheroid and geodetic datum have been adopted for a country they should be rigidly adhered to without change for all time, unless shown to be largely in error. In striving to attain the third object, the determination of the figure of the earth, the conditions are decidedly different. This problem concerns itself primarily with astronomic observations of latitude, longitude, and azimuth, and with the geodetic positions of the points at which the astronomic observations were made, but it is not concerned with the geodetic positions of other points fixed by the triangulations. The geodetic positions (latitudes and longitudes) of comparatively few points are therefore concerned in this problem. However, in marked contrast to the statements made in preceding paragraphs, it is desirable in dealing with this problem that, with each new important accession of data, a new spheroid fitting the geoid with the greatest possible accuracy, and new values of the geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths of the highest degree of accuracy, should be derived. The United States Standard Datum was adopted with reference to positions furnished for geographic positions, but has no reference to the problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. It is adopted with reference to the engineer's problem of furnishing standard positions, and does not affect the scientist's problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. The principles which guided in the selection of the datum to be adopted were: First, that the adopted datum should not differ widely from the ideal datum for which the sum of the station errors in latitude, longitude, and azimuth should each be zero; second, it was desirable that the adopted datum should produce minimum changes in

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1911.

the publications of the Survey, including its charts; and, third, it was desirable, other things being equal, to adopt that datum which allowed the maximum number of positions already in the office registers to remain unchanged, and therefore necessitated a minimum amount of new computation. These considerations led to the adoption as the United States Standard of the datum which had been in use for many years in the northeastern group of States and along the Atlantic coast as far as North Carolina. An examination of the station errors available in 1903, on the United States Standard Datum, at 246 latitude stations, 76 longitude stations, and 152 azimuth stations scattered widely over the United States from Maine to Louisiana and to California, indicated that this datum approaches closely the ideal with which the algebraic sum of the station errors of each class would be zero. 1 The adopted United States Standard Datum, upon which the positions and azimuths given in this publication depend, may be defined in terms of the position of the station Meades Ranch as follov;s:

The principal lists of geographic positions heretofore published upon the United States Standard Datum throughout the whole United States are contained in the following publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and of other organizations: Appendix 8 of the Report for 1885, positions in Massachusetts and Rhode Island; Appendix 8 of the Report for 1888, positions in Connecticut; Appendix 8 of the Report for 1893, positions in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland; Appendix 10 of the Report for 1894, positions in Massachusetts; Appendix 6 of the Report for 1901, positions in Kansas and Nebraska; Appendix 3 of the Report for 1902, positions in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Colorado; Appendix 4 of the Report for 1903, positjons in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas; Appendix 9 of the Report for 1904, positions in California; Appendix 5 of the Report for 1905, positions in Texas; Appendix 3 of the Report for 1907, positions in California; Appendix 5 of the Report for 1910, positions in California; Appendix EEE, pages 2905-3031, Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers, 1902, positions of points on and near the Great Lakes; in publications of the Massachusetts Harbor and Land Commission; and in various bulletins of the United States Geological Survey. In the present report, in addition to this appendix, there are two other appendixes giving positions on the standard datum-Appendix 4, positions in Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and Minnesota; Appendix 5, positions in Texas. TABLES OF POSITIONS. In the tables of positions the latitude and longitude of each point are given on the United States Standard Datum (see p. 422), also the length and azimuth of each line observed over, whether in one or both ways. This is, in a way, a duplication, as the

lengths and azimuths are implicitly contained in the corresponding latitudes and longitudes, while, on the other hand, from the latitude and longitude of a single point all the remaining latitudes and longitudes may be derived by means of the given lengths and azimuths. The amount of computation involved in transforming one of these systems of coordinates into the other is so great that it is necessary to have the double system for the convenient use of the tables. Along with the latitude and longitude of each point the lengths and azimuths are given of lines from that point to other points of the triangulation. No lengths or azimuths are repeated, and for a given line the length and azimuth will generally be found opposite the position of the last mentioned of the two stations involved. For the convenience of the draftsman a column of "seconds in meters" is given, in which is placed the length (in meters) of each small arc of a meridian or parallel corresponding to the seconds of the given latitude or longitude. To facilitate further the use of the tables, a column is given of the logarithms of the lengths. It must be remembered that it is the logarithm which is derived first in the computation, the lengths given in this table being then derived from the corresponding logarithms. The rule followed in recent publications of this Office has been to give latitudes and longitudes to thousandths of seconds for all points the positions of which arc fixed by fully adjusted triangulation. Points, the positions of which are given to hundredths of seconds only, are marked by footnotes as being without check or checked by verticals only. These notes mean that the object was pointed on from only two triangulation stations and that therefore an error in either pointing or in the identification of the object from either occupied station would not be detected in the computation, except that where vertical as well as horizontal observations were made on the object, a valuable check is obtained, and only a small error could pass undetected in the computation. In the columns giving azimuths, distances, and logarithms of distances the accuracy is indicated to a certain extent by the number of decimal places given, it being understood that in each case two doubtful figures are given. In some cases there is very little doubt of the correctness of the second figure from the right, while in a few cases some doubt may be cast on the third figure from the right. These tables may be conveniently consulted by using as finders the 22 sketches at the end of this appendix and the index on pages 561 to 579. In the third column of the index will be found for each point a reference to the page on which its description will be found, and in the fourth column the number of the sketch on which it appears. For the convenience of those who wish to convert the distances given in the table from meters into feet the following conversion table is here inserted:

DESCRIPT.IONS OF STATIONS. This list may be conveniently consulted by reference to the illustrations at the end of this publication or to the index. All azimuths given in the descriptions are reckoned continuously from true south around by west to 360°, south being o 0 , west 90°, north 180°, and east 270°. Where magnetic azimuths are given they are indicated as such. In a number of cases where azimuths are not available, directions are given, referred to some initial point as o 0 · These are not azimuths, and express only the angular relations at the station between the various objects enumerated. In general, except where the contrary is specifically stated, the surface and the underground marks are not in contact, so that a disturbance of the surface mark will not necessarily affect the underground mark. The underground mark should be'resorted to only in cases where there is evidence that the surface mark has been disturbed. In a number of descriptions of stations the warning is given that the position of the station is uncertain, and that the station must be used with caution. Most of such cases are due to the incomplete recovery or unsatisfactory identification of the original station marks in later visits to the station, in some cases it being uncertain whether the mark recovered was a center or a reference mark. Such stations can usually be used for hydrographic or topographic purposes, but when used as a base for triangulation should always be connected with at least two stations whose recovery is unquestioned. The initials and dates given in each description immediately after the county refer to the date of the establishment of the station, the man by whom it was established, and the date when the station was last searched for, whether it was recovered on that visit or not. Any person who finds that one of the stations herein described has been disturbed, or that the description no longer fits the facts, is requested to send such information to the Superintendent, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D.

NOTE 3.--Same as note 1, except that the two pipes were placed one on the other in contact, and a mass of concrete or cement mortar was placed around their junction, and around the bottom of the lower pipe. NOTE 4.--Same as note 3, with the addition of a reference mark consisting of a 4-inch terra-cotta pipe, 2U feet long, placed as indicated. NOTE 5.-The station was marked by an iron cone placed usually 2 feet below the surface of the ground. Through this cone was driven a stake with a tack in its top to mark the station. Around the station and at a distance therefrom of 3 feet were placed four other stubs, forming a square with the station at the intersection of its diagonals. NOTE 6.--Same as note 5, except that no iron cone was used. NOTE 7.-The station was marked by a bottle buried about 2 feet below the surface of the ground. Above this was placed a stub, in the top of which was a copper tack to mark the center of the station. Around the station and at a distance therefrom of 2 feet were placed four stubs in the form of a square, the station being at the intersection of its diagonals. NOTE 8.-The station was marked by a bottle placed about 2 feet below the surface of the ground. Above the. bottle was placed a coquina stone having in its top a hole into which was melted a lead bolt. The intersection of crosslines on this bolt marks the station. Sometimes a copper tack was driven in at this intersection. :Four stakes placed around the station form a square with the station at the intersection of its diagonals. NoTE 9.--Same as note 8, except that no mention was made in the original description of four stakes surrounding the station. NOTE 10.-The station center was marked by a nail in the top of a nassan stone, which had its top face flush with the surface of the ground. Four stakes were driven in north, east, south, and west of the station; nails were driven in the tops of these stakes and lines connecting them diagonally intersect at the station. NOTE 11.-The station was marked by a 5-inch terra-cotta pipe 26 inches long set in the ground flange up and projecting above the surface of the ground. The pipe was filled with cement, and a 4-inch pine plug 26 inches long was forced to the bottom. In the top of the plug was placed a 20-penny wire nail to mark the center.
