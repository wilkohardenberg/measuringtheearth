In addition to the above, the salaries of 342 petty officers and enlisted men were paid out of the appropriation for pay of the Navy. III. THE WORK OF THE YEAR. A.
FIELD OPERATIONS.

Magnetic work, which had considerable development during the past year, was executed in many parts of the United States, including a systematic survey of the State of North Carolina. The investigation of the literature bearing on Mason and Dixon's Line was made, and the result will be published hereafter. A standard of length was established in Boston for the street commissioners' office, and a set of length measures has been verified for the State of Maine by tl~e Office of Weights and Measures. In view of the necessity of making charts in the Philippine Islands, an Assistant was detailed in the latter part of the fiscal year to acquire, at Manila, such information as would bear on the subject. He arrived during the month of June, and continued his studies for several weeks, getting information of value for the intelligent prosecution of subsequent hydrographic and topographic work. Under the supervision of the Superintendent, latitude observations were begun at Gaithersburg, Md., and at Ukiah, Cal., in October, 1899, and continued during the period covered by this Report The work at these stations was executed under the direction and at the expense of the International Geodetic Association. The resurvey of Chesapeake Bay was continued by all the parties available for this important work. Topography was executed at a number of points on the northern shores of the bay. An Assistant of the Coast and Geodetic Survey jg a member of the Mississippi River Commission, and in this capacity was engaged during the greater portion of the year in performing the various duties resulting from his appointment to this position. Lines of precise leveling were carried westward, with the ultimate object of crossing the continent and establishing the difference of level between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as to give heights along the line in the different States traversed. This line will also serve as a base from which innumerable points in the interior of the ~ountry may have their altitude above tide water established.
*The salaries of the civilian watch officers were paid under this hea<ling.

INTRODUCTION.

19

Prominent among the schemes of work now in hand by the Coast and Geodetic Survey stands the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian. This was prosecuted during the past year in Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska. The work in Alaska was carried on by a number of parties operating at Cape Nome, the mouth of the Yukon, Scammon Bay, and on the Copper River. Several vessels were sent to Porto Rico, and were engaged in making surveys of this island and the adjacent ones. The Patlijinder was for some months in the Hawaiian Islands. The party did triangulation on Maui, Molokai, and at Hilo, on Hawaii. A hydrographic survey of four harbors in these islands was also made. An Assistant made an inspection of the chart agencies on the Atlantic coast, and valuable information was acquired, as to the needs of the maritime public concerning charts. The Coast Pilot party was engaged in the compilation of data derived from its own field observations and from other sources. In connection with the solar eclipse of May 28, 1900, an Assistant of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was detailed to make time observations and to establish meridian lines, as requested by the Smithsonian Institution, and others of the Coast Survey personnel were employed in making magnetic observations during totality at points on the line of the eclipse. Availing himself of a brief sojourn in Porto Rico, one of the surgeons attached to the service made a special study of the sanitary conditions of Porto Rico and Culebra, and abstracts of his reports are published in Appendix No. 2. Gravity connections were made toward the close of the fiscal year by an Assistant on the Survey, between the station at Washington, D. C., and some of the principal stations of Europe. This work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. A suryey of the Brunswick outer bar, called for by a special act of Congress, and made by an Assistant of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, under the direction of the Secretary of War, was completed during the year. The Patlifinder sailed from Washington in June, 1899, and arrived at San Francisco three months later. A detailed account of this successful voyage is given in one of the appendices to the present Report. With the view of utilizing the Marconi system of wireless telegraphy, the Inspector of Standards was detailed to witness the experiments made by the Navy Department, off Navesink, late in the month of October. The work on Chesapeake Bay has already been mentioned as far as the land operations are concerned, and it only remains in this place to say that the hydrographic survey was continued, and at many points formed the principal occupation ot the parties. This same remark applies to the work in Alaska, where hydrography was done at many points, including some offshore work by the steamer Patterso?i in the development of the great bar off the mouth of the Yukon. Hydrographic surveys were made in many places in the waters of Porto Rico, notably in the harbor of San Juan and in the sound lying between Culebra and the east coast of Porto Rico. A speed-trial course for the ships of the Navy was laid out at Cape Charles City, Chesapeake Bay, at the request of the Navy Department.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

The work of marking the temporary boundary line between Alaska and British Columbia, in accordance with the terms of a modus'vivendi dated October 20, 1899, was undertaken at the request of the Department of State, by an officer of the Survey, as Commissioner of the United States, and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.
B.
OFFICE COMPUTATIONS.
I. GENERAL.

The regular computations of the Survey were carried on in the lines of geodesy, leveling, magnetism, etc.
2. SPECIAL.

Besides the regular work of the Survey in the matter of computations, special investigations have been made with a view of determining the size and shape of the earth. One very important contribution to the solution of this problem has been made in the transcontinental triangulation, the results of which appear in Special Publication No. 4, of this Bureau. The Arc Section during the past year was engaged in the recomputation of the triangulation along the eastern coast of the United States, following the Appalachian chain and extending from Calais, Me., to New Orleans, La. This work is almost ready for publication, and will form an important contribution to the subject. Some work has also been done on an oblique arc from San Francisco to the Mexican Boundary.
C. PUBLICATION OF RESULTS.

During the year the Report for the year 1898 was sent to the printer; that for 1899 was finished, and considerable work had been done on that for 1900. This brought the publication· of the Annual Reports practically up to date. Second !!ditions of several bulletins were issued, and supplen~ents to' the Coast Pilots published as occasion demanded. The usual Tide Tables were prepared for the year 19or. Notices to Mariners were sent out monthly and three special publications, Nos. 3, 4, and 5, were prepared and sent to the printer. Of especial interest is the first named, which is an Atlas of the Philippine Islands, containing about 30 charts, with text in Spanish and English. The second one, Special Publication No. 4, is The Transcontinental Triangulation and the American Arc of the Parallel, a volume of 871 pages, the material for which had been accumulating for twenty-five years. Other reference to these publications is made in the body of the report, both in the details of office work and in the account of general progress.

PLAN OF OPERATIONS.

a.

General statement.

The work during the year has been a continuation on the general lines previously followed. The localities in which work was done were determined by the necessities of the case. Changes are continually going on in many localities, and this has necessitated many resurveys. The general expansion of the material interests of the United States within the last few years has resulted in calling upon the surveying departments of the Government for renewed efforts and the development of new plans of work in the outlying Territories. The gold fields of Alaska having brought this Territory into extreme prominence, the Survey has been called upon to furnish preliminary charts of the entrances to the Klondike and other gold-bearing regions. With this end in view parties have been dispatched to Cape Nome, the mouth of the Yukon, Scammon Bay, and the Copper River Delta.
b. Resurveys.

The principal resurveys of the year have been that of Chesapeake Bay and of the bar outside ·the Golden Gate, at San Francisco. In the former case a comparison of the old work with the new shows the necessity for much resurveying, and this· work is being carried on by numerous parties as rapidly as the appropriations permit. The survey of the bar off the· entrance to San Francisco Harbor was completed just before the termination of the year. c. New w01·k. By far the larger part of the resources of the Survey was devoted to the development of regions where work had not been done before. Au unusual amount of work was done in Alaska, but in view of the great demands for information from this quarter, it
35

COAST AND, GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, r900.

seemea necessary to send all the parties there which could be economically employed. Much work was done in Porto Rico in triangulation, reconnaissance, and hydrography, the result of which has been the development of several harbors and their approaches. The Patlifinder spent several months in the Hawaiian Islands making supplementary surveys of four harbors and their approaches.
2.

ORGANIZA'fION OF PARTIES.

The organization of parties has been in conformity with the needs of the situation. There were during the year 6 engaged on reconnaissance, 20 on topography, and 26 on triangulation. Eighteen hydrographic parties were in operation during the year in the localities previously mentioned, and current and tide observations were made by these parties in numerous places. The geographic distribution of these parties was as follows: twenty-four parties were in the Eastern Division, 6 in the Middle, 8 in the Western, 6 in Alaska, 1 in Hawaii, and 5 in Porto Rico. '

The Inspector has immediate supervision over all the topographic and hydrographic field work of the Survey, the most important data required in the construction of charts. On July 1, Assistant Ogden was at San Francisco, Cal., on inspection duty. Late in July he returned to Washington, D. C., via Seattle, Wash., where he spent a day in consultation with Assistant Gilbert. He made frequent visits to the Eagre while at work in New York Harbor, and directed operations which resulted in the location of a range for carrying deep-draft vessels between Coenties and Diamond reefs. After completing this field work the Eagre was docked and Assistant Ogden personally inspected the vessel in connection with the local inspector of hulls. He performed similar duty in inspecting the Blake, at Boston. Numerous other trips of inspection were made during the year. The office work attending the care of the vessels required much labor, in cause-· quence of the legislation by Congress for transferring the enlisted· force from a naval to Plans and specifications for rebuilding the steamer Bache and the a civil basis. construction of a new steamer for the Coast Pilot work were prepared.

COAST AND GEODE'J'IC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

The duties of the Coast Pilot party are both in the field and in the office. It is necessary to check information and verify facts on the ground before they can be utilized in the compilation of the Coast Pilots. The party was engaged iir the office from the beginning of the fiscal year .until the 22d of July. The ·vork consisted in the compilation of the Alaska Coast Pilot and the revision of the United States Coast Pilot, Part IV. Some work was also done relating to Peril Strait, Alaska. The work of the party, after taking the field in J,uly, will be given in the description of the general field work, and it only remains in this place to state some of the duties performed in the ·office. The party returned to Washington on September 1, and during this month and the following one were engaged in the preparation of the third edition of the Coast Pilot of the Atlantic Coast, Part IV, a copy being sent to the printer on October 25. One supplement to the Coast Pilot, Part III, and one to Coast Pilot, Part VIII, were prepared and the proof read. A notice of the range in the deep-water channel of East River, New York, was prepared. During November and December the party was engaged in reading proof of Part IV, the collection of data and preparation of manuscript for the Alaska Coast Pilot, and the preparation of a supplement to Parts I-II, IiI, VI, and VIII. Some work was also done on the collection of data for the Pacific Coast Pilot. During January and February the party was engaged in reading proof for the third edition of the Coast Pilot, Part IV; in preparing a second edition of Bulletin No. 40, Alaska, and data for the Pacific Coast Pilot; supplements for Parts I-II and IV were prepared and proof read, and discrepancies on charts covering the locality included in the third edition of the Coast Pilot, Part IV, were submitted. Lieut. D. H. Jarvis, United States Revenue-Cutter Service, gave valuable assistance in the preparation of the second edition of Bulletin No. 40, having been assigned to this duty at the request of the Superintendent. During March and April the party was engaged in reading proof and in collecting data in the field for the second edition of the Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VII, and during May and June in the preparation of the second edition of the Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VII. This work was well advanced at the close of the year. One member of the party was employed almost continuously during the year on routine work, consisting of the collection of the latest information for insertion in the Coast Pilot volumes and the correction of the volumes to date of issue. The following is an abstract of the publications prepared by the party during the fiscal year, with the date of each:
Supplement to the United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part IV, September 30, 1899. Supplement to the United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VIII, November 23, 1899 Supplement to the United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VI, February 24, 1900.

OFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF GEODETIC WORK.

J. F.

HAYFORD,

Inspector of Geodetic Work.

The work of inspecting the geodetic operations of the Survey was carried on during the year almost exclusively by careful examinations of the records and computations sent to the Office by the field pan.ies. The monthly reports and letters from the field parties were also examined systematically. On January l, 1900, the Inspector of Geodetic Work was also made Chief of the Computing Division, and after that time the records and computations were necessarily subjected to a still more careful scrutiny during the progress of the computations. The only inspection in the field during the year was made on a single day spent with a leveling party running a line between the western end of Lake Erie and Cincinnati. IV. OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR OF MAGNETIC WORK.
L. A.
BAUER,

Inspector of Magnetic Work.

The duties of the Inspector involved the immediate direction of the field operations · in terrestrial magnetism and the preparation of special reports on the progress of the work, as called for by the Superintendent. In all, 226 different stations were occupied in various parts of the United States. A site for a magnetic base station was selected near Washington, D. C., and the correlation of the different magnetic instruments belonging to the Survey un·dertaken. The special field work carried on by the Inspector as chief of party is given in detail elsewhere, and also his duties as Chief of the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism. V.

The disbursement of the funds of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is made not only by payments directly from. the Disbursing Agent, but also largely through the medium of its Assistants and other officers, when acting as chiefs of parties. These officers, on approval of the Superintendent, receive advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent in lump sums, under authority of an Executive order dated March 26, 1886, as follows:
EXECUTIVE MANSION, Washington, D. C., llfarc/1 26, I886. Under authonty of section 3648 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, permission is hereby given that needful advances of money be made to officers of the Navy detailed to duty as chiefs of parties in the service of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and to all Assistants, SubAssistants, and Acting Assistants, or officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey acting as chiefs of

42

parties and engaged under instructions from the Superintendent of such Survey up9n any woi;k or operations of said Survey. · No compensation shall be allowed for the disbursement of any moneys hereby authorized to be advanced, and the officers or persons authorized to receive and disburse moneys so advanced, shall be subject to all the terms, provisions, and conditions of law as to the custody, disbursement, and rendering of accounts of public money of the United States. But no advances of money sl,iall be made to a civilian chief of 'any party in the s~rvice of said United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, unless a bond of such civilian officer shall be given in the penal sum of $2 ooo with two sureties who shall have'qualified in that sum, and which bond shall contain the usual condition of the bond required by law from disbursing agents or clerks, and shall be approved by the Solicitor of the Treasury, and be filed in his office, and shall from time to time be renewed, strengthened, or increased, as the Secretary of the Treasury may direct.
GROVER CLEVELAND.

In conformity to this order there:! are now 57 officers of this Survey bonded in the sum of $2 ooo, or more, each. When acting as chiefs of parties these officers receive, from time to time, such advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent as are required to meet the necessary current expenses of the w9rk in hand. A ledger account is kept in the office of the Disbursing Agent with each chief of party receiving an advance, each one being charged with all advances made to him, and on the other hand receiving credit for all proper expenditures made by him when presented on regularly supported vouchers, and after such accounts have been audited in the office of the Disbursing Agent and fou~d to be correct. All of these accounts, with their supporting vouchers, are then sent to the First Auditor of the Treasury for examination and audit by him. This system has met the needs of this service and Tesults, in the main, in economy and good order in its expenditures.

The work of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures was divided into two general sections. The first dealt with the comparison of mass, length, and capacity; with the calibration and adjustment of the instruments used in such comparisons; and with the solution of problems which arose in connection with standards. The second section, which was assigned to electric measures, included the construction and comparison of standards, the calibration of measuring apparatus, and the solution of problems which arose in connection with such work.
SECTION I.

During the past year the usual number of thermometers, weights, tapes, and other length measures were verified for the Executive Departments and for private individuals and institutions. Part of the set of standard weights and measures for the State of Maine was put iri order and compared, and the preparation of a set of metric standards for Porto Rico was begun. · At the request of the street commissioners of Boston, Mass., a 100-foot bench standard, built for the use of the city surveying department, was graduated in feet and meters and standardized. This work was accomplished in a satisfactory manner and at a trifling cost to the city compared with its value. Engineers and surveyors of that

ADMINISTRATIVE STA'rEMENT.

vicinity are now provided with ready means of verifying their tapes and chains, the accuracy of which is of prime importance in public and private surveys. For the past ten years all length comparisons, except of tapes and base bars, have been made in the comparing vault under the sidewalk in front of the Coast and Geodetic Survey building. This temporary wooden structure had become useless owing to dampn.ess, and for sanitary reasons it had to be tom down in July, 1899, thus leaving the Office without facilities for making comparisons of length measures from 1 too· 1 meter. Accordingly the construction of a comparator having the desired range was begun, and the piers for it were built in the balance room of the Butler Building.

337

The legalization of the international electric units by Congress, in 1894, made it the duty of the Office of Standard Weights and Measure's to provide facilities for the official verification of electric standards and measuring apparatus. Preliminary steps to provide the Office with the necessary facilities were taken soon after July, 1897, when the appointment of a verifier for that purpose was authorized. Considerable work was accomplished, and in March, 1900, the electricians were notified, through the principal technical journals, of the readiness of the Office to undertake the verification of certain kinds of measuring instruments in terms of the provisional standards adopted. To avoid the delay which would. naturally arise from the construction of primary mercury standards, it was decided to refer, for the present, all measurements of resistance to the mean value of a number of wire coils, known in terms of the best existing mercury standards. The general excellence of the Reichsanstalt type, the ~xtremely small temperature coefficient, and thermo-electromotive power with respect to copper, and their permanency, led to the selection of manganin coils of the type mentioned.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

A large number of Clark standard cells were set up with the purest material obtainable in the market, and a number were set up with material purified in this ·Office. The intercomparisons made indicate a most satisfactory agreement of all the cells on hand, well within 0·005 per cent. The mean electromotive force of the three dozen or more cells furnishes, therefore, a standard of reference which can be relied upon within this limit. The Office is practically equipped to undertake the verification of a limited amount of the following classes of apparatus: Resistance standards.-Coils of the following denominations: 1, 2, 5, ro, roo, 1 ooo, 10 ooo ohms. Low-resistance standards for current measurements of the following denominations : o· 1, o ·or, 0·001, 0·0001 ohms. Resistance boxes ; potentiometers, and ratio coils. Standards ef elecftomotive.force.-Clark standard cells, and other standard cells. Direct-current measuring apparatus.-Millivoltmeters and voltmeters up to 150 volts. Ammeters up to 50 amperes. VIII. FIELD OPERATIO NS.
A. COAST PILOT.

.

The Coast Pilot party, during the year, was engaged in both field and office work. During the month of August on board the steamer Endeavor, the party was collecting data in Long Island Sound and vicinity. In the month of March, while the party was engaged in office work in Washington, Mr. John Ross took the field in order to obtain material for a report on the ports and waterways along the Atlantic coast, between Chesapeake Bay entrance and St. Augustine, Fla. This information was needed for the revision of Coast Pilot, Part VII.

GEODESY.

RECONNAISSANCE.

a. Middle Division.

Reconnaissance, that necessary part of geodesy before extended triangulation can be carried out, was executed in different parts of the United States, and also in the ·outlying territory. In Nebraska Assistant Granger continued the reconnaissance of the ninety-eighth meridian northward until sufficient points had been obtained for a complete season's work of observation of angles. On the same scheme of work, that is to say, the triangulation along the ninetyeighth meridian, Assistant Forney executed reconnaissance in Texas. This work was carried on, for the purpose of determining available points for the triangulation which was to follow, and also for the location of certain base lines, which were demanded in order to verify the triangulation.
b. Division o.f Alaska.

In order to determine the availability of Scammon Bay as a harbor for deep-sea vessels, reconnaissance was made, during the season of 1900, by Assistant Putnam. This required the determination of astronomic latitudes and longitudes, as well as the

measurement of an azimuth. Much unfavorable weather was experienced. minations depend entirely upon observations of the sun.
c. Outlying Territory.

Before taking up tne triangulation, topography, and hydrography of San Juan Harbor, Porto Rico, and of the islands in this vicinity, Assistant Boutelle made a reconnaissance in each of these different localities. This work brought to light a number of new facts, and aided materially in the prosecution of the subsequent work. Assistant Nelson, who was charged with the triangulation, base measurement, and other geodetic work on the island of Porto Rico, also made a reconnaissance for the particular needs of his work. It devolved upon Assistant Forney to make a reconnaissance for a triangulation across the island of Porto Rico, connecting the work near Ponce with that at San Juan, and a reconnaissance was made which covered the locality.
2.

BASE LINES.

a. .Middle Division.

Six base lines were selected and located by Assistant Forney on the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, between the northern boundary of Texas and the Rio Grande. These were situated in the neighborhood of :Bowie, Stephenville, Lampasas, Seguin, Hidalgo, and Alice, Tex.
b. Division of Alaska.

In order to begin a triangulation in the vicinity of Scammon Bay, Assistant Putaam measured a base line on the fiats south of the Khun River, near its mouth, from which a rough triangulation was extended ~long the south side of the bay to Cape Romanzof. In order to control the triangulation of the Kwiklowak pass of the Yukon River four base lines were measured, having an average length of about 2 ooo meters and a distance between the bases of from 10 to 30 miles. Four base lines were measured by Assistant Faris in his work at the mouth of the Yukon and along the adjacent coast. A great many of the lines forming the sides· of the triangulation connecting these bases were only from 300 to 500 meters long. The length of the bases ranged from about 300 to 1 6oo meters. A base line about 2 ooo meters long was measured on the northwestern shore of Golofnin Bay by Assistant Pratt.
c. Otttlying Territory.

A base line was measured at Great Harbor, Culebra, by Assistant Boutelle, and from this a triangulation was extended over the island and to the outlying rocks to the westward. A base line was measured by Assistant Nelson in the neighborhood of Boqueron, on the west coast of Porto Rico.
3. TRIANGULATION.

a. Eastem Division.

The work undertaken by Assistant French, on the coast of New Jersey, for the purpose of bringing the charts of this locality up to date, involved the execution of triangulation, which was carried on as th~ necessities of the case required during the entire

,

72

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

season. Triangulation was executed on Chesapeake Bay, from the entrance of Eastern Bay to the Miles River, by Extra Observer Donn, and the triangulation of Miles River was pushed southward from Deep Water Pond. Between the 15th of September and the 24th of October the work was completed as far as the line Royal to Oak. The unfinished topography of the Miles River to the northward over the Wye River required a tertiary triangulation, which was executed by Extra Observer Donn during the season. Assistant Flemer carried on the triangulation on the west shore of Chesapeake Bay, from Bay Ridge to Curtis Point, including that of South River. The upper part of Chesapeake Bay was taken up by Assistant Vinal, and the triangulation expanded from the head of the bay to Port Deposit, and in Northeast River to the head of navigation. In the prosecution of his hydrographic work Assistant Welker executed a triangulation at the head of Eastern Bay. Toward the close of the fiscal year Assistant Welker took up the triangulation of Chesapeake Bay below the mouth of the Potomac River. In order to make a resurvey of the old main channel into Charleston Harbor, S. C., it was necessary to determine a number of points. The triangulation for this purpose was executed by Assistant Fairfield during the month of June, and the results were furnished to Assistant Vinal, who was charged with the hydrographic survey.
b. llfiddle Division.

From the rst of July till the 28th of October, 1899, Assistant Granger continued his work on the ninety-eighth meridian, and during this time occupied seven primary stations. During the month of June Assistant Granger continued his work on the ninety-~ighth meridian in the State of Nebraska. This work was in progress at the end of the fiscal year, and was being carried northward. Starting from the transcontinental triangulation, at the stations Wilson and Heath, Assistant Eimbeck carried the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian southward. Three stations were occupied during the season, from July r to November 23.
c. Western Division.

The triangulation around Rich's Passage and Port Orchard was executed by Assistant Dickins during the month of April. In the survey of Seattle Bay, by Assistant Gilbert, a secondary triangulation, based on the line Alger to Freeport was made. In the execution of hydrography from Point Penole to Marin Islands, triangulation was <1one by the party in charge of Assistant W estdahl. The primary triangulation of' southern California was completed by Assistant Mosman. This now extends to the Mexican Boundary, and the work may be subsequently developed westward from any of the figures along the coast.
d. Division of Alaska.

Triangulation was executed in Alaska in the various localities occupied by the Coast and Geodetic Survey parties. By Assistant Putnam, at the mouth of the Yukon and on Scammon Bay; by Assistant Faris, at the mouth of the Yukon; by Assistant Pratt, in Golofnin Bay; by Assistant Ritter, on Copper River, and by Assistant Dickins, in making connection between Chatham and Rosario straits.

Triangulation in Porto Rico was done by Assistant Boutelle, by Assistant Forney, and by Assistant Nelson. Assistant Hodgkins, operating on the steamer Blake, made a trigonometric connection between the island of Culebra and the longitude station established some years ago at Port Christian, St. Thomas, West Indies. All the triangulation executed by Assistants Boutelle and Hodgkins depends upon a base line near the head of Culebra Harbor, measured by Assistant Boutelle. In making hydrographic and topographic surveys in the Hawaiian Islands, Assistant Perkins executed triangulation in the vicinity of Kahului Harbor and Kamalalaea Bay, Maui, Hilo Bay, Hawaii, and Kaunakakai. Harbor, Molokai. This triangulation is all based upon the Hawaiian Government work previously executed.
4. ASTRONOMIC DETERMINATIONS.

During the month of October Assistant Sinclair, cooperating with Assistant McGrath, determined the longitude of Maricopa, Ariz., from the base station at El Paso. In connection with Assistant Putnam's work at the mouth of the Yukon and on Scammon Bay, seven latitude stations, seven longitude stations, and six azimuth stations were occupied. Observations were made for latitude and azimuth by Assistant Flynn, under the direction of Assistant Faris, near the Kawanak Pass of the Yukon River Delta. Astronomic observations were made by Assistant Pratt, at Cape Nome and in Golofnin Bay. Owing to continued cloudiness, however, only solar observations could be obtained. Azimuth observations were made by Assistant Forney, at station Latimer, in Porto Rico. An azimuth station was made at Great Harbor, Culebra, by Assistant Boutelle, arid also by Assistant Nelson in the Boqueron Valley, Porto Rico. Azimuth observations were made at several points in the Hawaiian Islands, by Assistant Perkins, in connection with his magnetic work. The longitude of the International Geodetic Latitude Station, at Gaithersburg, Md., was determined during the month of August, by Assistants Smith and McGrath.
C. HYDROGRAPHY.

GENERAL STATEMENT.

Hydrographic operations have been continued during the year on the eastern and western coasts of Alaska, and in the outlying territory. By far the greater part of the work has been inshore hydrography, but a portion of the work of Alaska was so far from' land as to be classified under the term offshore work.''

INSHORE WORK.

a.

Easten1 Division.

Hydrography was executed on the Monomoy Shoals and off Boston Entrance, Massachusetts. A hydrographic survey was n:.ade during the early part of the fiscal year of the area extending from the west side of Governors Island, New York Harbor, to the Battery, and up the East River beyond Coenties Reef. A drag procured from the United States Engineers was brought into requisition, and by this means a sunken wreck was found off the South Ferry slip lying in about 30 feet of water, and having. about 17 feet over it at its highest point. The investigation of certain reported shoals and obstructions in the Delaware River was undertaken by Assistant Young. Signals were erected in t~e latter part of May, and the hydrographic work was carried on until the close of the fiscal year. Hydrography was executed at the head of Chesapeake Bay, including the Susquehanna River, to Port Deposit, and th.e Northeast River to the head of navigation. Assistant Welker, in command of the steamer Baclte, made supplemental surveys in the Patapsco River. Hydrographic operations were carried on in Bush River, ·Sassafras River, and Elk River by the steamer Endeavor, under command of Assistant Yates. A resurvey of the old main channel into Charleston Harbor was executed by Assistant Vinal on his return from Porto Rico.
b.
Western division.

A survey of Rich's Passage, Port Austin, Wash., was made by Assistant Dickins, commanding the steamer Gedney. Soundings were made in' the vicinity of Sa:n Francisco, from Point Penale to Marin Islands, from October to December, 1899. A hydrographic survey was also made by Assistant W estdahl, commanding the steamer McArlkur, of the bar outside the Golden Gate.
c.

Division of Alaska.

In connection with his general plan of operations in Alaska; Assistant Pratt, ·commanding the steamer Patterson, made a detailed hydrographic survey of Golofnin Bay. A hydrographic reconnaissance was executed in Scammon Bay and at the mouth of the Yukon in the Kwiklowak Pass by Assistant Putnam. Assistant Faris did hydrography in the neighborhood of St. Michael and in the Kwikpak and Kawanak passes. The mouth of the Copper River was explored bydrograph~cally by Assistant Ritter.
d. Outlying Territory.

The operations carried out during the year in Porto Rico involved the execution of considerable hydrography. This was executed by Assistant Boutelle, commanding the schooner Eagre, in the harbor of San Juan and on the west shore· of Culebra Island, by Assistant Vinal, commanding the schooner Matcltless, in the harbor of San Juan, !J.nd by Assistant Hodgkins, commanding the steamer Blake, in the sound east of Culebra, including Mangrove Harbor. In the Hawaiian group hydrography was executed by Assistant Perkins, commanding the steamer Paik.finder, at the port of Kahului, in Kamalalaea Bay, in

Kaunakakai Harbor, and between the islands of Maui and Kahoolawi. At Hilo a hydrograpic survey was also made by him, covering the harbor, the reef, and the approaches out to the 100-fathom curve.
D.
1.

HYPSOMETRIC.

EASTERN DIVISION.

Precise leveling was executed by Assistant Ferguson from Toledo to Cincinnati, Ohio, and from Covington to Corinth, in Kentucky.
2.

MIDDLE DIVISION.

Aid Tilton continued leveling operations during the year from Cortlana to Nortolk, Nebr., and on a side line 20 miles in length westward from Grand Island to the triangulation station Shelton. During the spring and early summer of 1900 the line was carried from Norfolk, Nebr., to Sioux City, Iowa. A side line 7 miles in length, to Hadir, Nebr., was also executed.
3. WESTERN DIVISION.

Assistant Winston continued the line of the previous season, beginning ·north of Denver and going as far as Rock Creek, Wyo., by way of Cheyenne.
E. MAGNETIC.

Magnetic observations were made and a number of valuable results were obtained in different localities. First of all may be mentioned the work carried out in the States of Rhode Island, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Ohio, Kansas, Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. This was done under. the immediate direction of Assistant Bauer, inspector of magnetic work, and comprised over 100 stations. Second, the work of Mr. D. L. Hazard in . South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Kentucky, and Tennessee, including about 40 stations. At all these the regular series of determinations, including declination, dip, and intensity, were observed, and in many cases meridian lines were established. Assistant Preston continued the series of annual observations at Cherrydale, Va. Assistant Baylor occupied a number of county seats in Maryland, and .also made magnetic observations at Cape Charles City, in connection with the to.tal solar eclipse of May 28. Other observations in connection with the eclipse were made by Assistant Putnam at Wadesboro, N. C. About thirty stations were occupied in North Carolina by Assistant Baylor between July 1 and December 20. This work was done under the joint auspices of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the North Carolina Geological Survey. Meridian lines were established from morning and afternoon sun observations, and the lines were marked with granite posts. While engaged in astronomic observations at Gaithersburg, Md., Assistant Smith began magnetic determinations during the month of November. These were continued weekly until the 4th of April, after which date the observatory was turned over to the party of Assistant Bauer. The programme included the regular observations for declination, dip, and intensity. Dip observations were continued weekly until the 22d of May, but the other elements were not observed after the middle of April. Three magnetic stations were occupied by Assistant Putnam in connection with his work

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

at the mouth of the Yukon, in Alaska. Two additional ones were occupied by Assistant Faris in the same general locality. Five magnetic stations were occupied by Assistant Perkins in Hawaii, of which three, namely, Hilo, Lahaina, and Honolulu, were old stations previously occupied by Assistant Preston.
F.
I.

TIDAL.

'tIDE OBSERVATIONS.

Tide observations were made in connection with hydrographic work by Assistants Vinal, Welker, and Yates in Chesapeake Bay; by Assistant Vimtl in Charleston Harbor; by Assistant Dickins at Rich's Passage, Wasbington; by Assistant Westdahl in Sau Francisco Bay; by Assistants Pratt, Putnam, Faris, Ritter, and Dickins in Alaska; by Assistants Vinal and Hodgkins in Porto Rico, and by Assistant Perkins in Hawaii. Automatic tide gauges have been in operation at New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and Fernandina on the eastern coast, and at San Francisco and Seattle on the western. Besides these a number of observations have been furnished by other parties, notably the United States Engineers and the Mississippi River Commission. Records from several foreign ports have also been received. The tide indicators at Fort Hamilton, N. Y., and Reedy Island, Delaware, have continued to give satisfaction.
2.

CURRENT OBSERVATIONS.

Current observations were made at Kahului Bay, ·Hawaii, by Assistant Perkins. The currents were studied by means of bottles, each carrying a flag, aud so weighted that only an inch of the neck showed above the water. These were set adrift outside the mouth of the harbot, and for a considerable distance along the outer edge of the reef, and observations made upon them to determine the velocity and direction of the current. Over 200 current stations were made by Assistant Pratt, incident to his hydrographic work in the North Bering Sea.
G.
r.

TOPOGRAPHIC.

EASTERN DIVISION.

In connection with the hydrography at. Monomoy Shoals aud Boston Harbor, topography was executed by Assistant Hodgkins, commanding the steamer Blake, during the summer of 1899. Similar work was done by Assistant French along the New Jersey coast, in connection with the revision of charts. Considerable topography was completed during the year on Chesapeake Bay; by Assistant Bowie at the north end of the bay, as far as Port Deposit and Northeast; by Extra Observer Donn in the vicinity of Kent Island and on the Miles and Wye rivers; by Assistant Flemer from Bay Ridge to Curtis Point; by Assistant Nelson ou the Sassafras River and its tributaries; and by Assistant Vinal on the Elk River. Ou his return from Porto Rico, Assistant Vinal stopped at Charleston, S. C., where topographic work was done in connection with the hydrography of the old channel.

ADMINISTRATIVE STATEMENT.
2.

77

WESTERN DIVISION.

Topography in. the vicinity of Seattle was executed by Assistant Gilbert in September. During the year three sheets were finished by Assistant Morse, in the vicinity of San Francisco.
3. DIVISION OF ALASKA.

The topography executed in Alaska was as follows: By Assistant Pratt, at Cape Dyer and on Golofnin Bay; by Assistant Putnam, on Scammon Bay and at the Kwiklowak mouth of th~ Yukon; by Assistant Faris, in the vicinity of St. Michael and at the mouth of the Yukon; by Assistant Ritter, on the Copper River.
4. OUTLYING TERRITORY.

The neighborhood of Great Harbor, Culebra, was surveyed topographically by Assistant Boutelle. Assistant Nelson carried on the same class of work, beginning in the neighbprhood of Ponce and continuing along the coast to Mayaguez. The shore line of the harbor of San Juan was rerun and the topographic details mapped one-half mile back from the shore by Assistant Vinal. Assistant Hodgkins surveyed, during the season, a portion of the shore line of Culebra and the adjacent islands. In connection with his hydrographic work, Assistant Perkins executed shore-line topography in the Hawaiian Islands.
E. SPECIAL DUTY.
GENERAL STATEMENT.

Besides the regular work of the Survey, which is much the same in successive years, a number of special investigations are usually desirable and necessary. During the year several of these investigations led to important results, and it is proposed in this place to give a short account of the work and the results accomplished.
I.

INSPECTION OF CHART AGENCIES.

With a view to getting information to improve the character of the charts, there was sent out during the previous fiscal year a circular to shipmasters and other nautical experts. The paper proposed certain questions to which answers were requested. Sixty-one replies came, and much information from the point of view of the public as to the character of the charts was obtained. Without attempting to give a stttnmary of the replies to this circular, it may be said that the large majority suggested no. essential change in the published chart. The information brought out led to instructions being issued to Assistant Bradford to make an inspection of the chart agencies along the coast, and to acquire all possible information from mariners and other parties interested in the subject. Assistant Bradford made a tour of the coast, visiting 45 places along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Conferences were had with officers of chambers of commerce and boards of trade. Valuable information on the subject of charts and chart making was obtained. ·
2.

GRADUATION OF BENCH STANDARD.

At the request of the street commissioners of Boston, Mass., a graduation in feet and meters was made on their 100-foot bench standard.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900. 3. BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE SURVEYS OF MASON AND DIXON'S LINE.

A bibliography of the surveys of Mason and Dixon's line was prepared. This required a great amount of research, and fourteen towns and cities were visited in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware. Numerous libraries and city offices were examined, and many calls were made at newspaper offices and on historians. ~
4. SANITARY CONDITIONS IN PORTO RICO.

Availing himself of a ·sojourn on the islands of Porto Rico and Culebra, the surgeon of the schooner Eagre made a study of the sanitary conditions of both islands, and has submitted an interesting and valuble report thereon. Vital statistics for Porto Rico are given for the·month of August, and a mortality table is furnished from 18901899, classifying all deaths under nine heads, from .which it appears that nearly onehalf of the deaths were from tuberculosis. Of the island of Culebra the report speaks very favorably. The climate differs from Porto Rico by being somewhat cooler and less rainy. The general health of the people is good, but, as in Porto Rico, the prevalent diseases are consumption and rheumatism.
5. MISSISSIPPI RIVER COMMISSION.

While engaged on the survey of the Brunswick outer par, Georgia, Assistant Marindin, as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, was called upon to attend the seventy-ninth session, at St. Louis. A tour of inspection was made from t~e lastnamed place to New Orleans.
6. PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

While in command of the steamer Pathfinder, engaged in hydrographic and topographic work in the Hawaiian Islands, Assistant Perkins was detached to proceed to Manila and report on the conditions prevailing in that section as regards the work of this Bureau. He reached Manila on the 4th of June, and remained until the 15th of July. The results of his studies are given in a series of letters and reports. His investigations covered the field of longitudes, tides, magnetism, triangulation, and topography.
7. SEISMIC OBSERVATIONS.

While engaged on his regular work on the Copper River, Alaska, Assistant Ritter had opportunity to observe a number of earthquakes, a list of which has been submitted with his season's report.
8. CONNECTIONS BETWEEN GRAVITY STATIONS IN EUROPE AND AMERICA.

Assistant Putnam received instructions on June r r to make the necessary pendulum observations at Washington, London, Berlin, and Paris to suitably connect these primary stations. The work was done at the request of the International Geodetic Association, and at the close of the fiscal year the work had been completed at Washington' and at Kew Observatory, in ~ngland. The party expenses were paid out of the funds of the Association.

COLLECTION OF DATA RELATIVE TO THE EARLY SURVEYS OF THE BOUNDARY OF. CALIFORNIA.

In compliance with instructions of March 24, Assistant Edmonds undertook the collection of data relative to the early surveys of the southeastern boundary of California, and visited the offices of the United States surveyor-general at San Francisco and Sacramento, Cal., and at Reno and Carson City, Nev
ro.

INTERNATIONAL LATITUDE SERVICE.

The International Geodetic Association having undertaken the establishment of six latitude stations near the thirty-ninth parallel of north latitude, three of these stations were located within the United States. One was established at Gaithersburg, Md., one at Ukiah, Cal., and a third, which was not entirely at the expense of the Association, but merely subsidized, was· located at the Cincinnati Observatory. The work at Gaithersburg, Md., and at Ukiah, Cal., is done under the general supervision of the Superintendent Coast and Geodetic Survey, acting for the association, and the expenses at these stations are paid by him out of funds furnished by the association. By authority of the Honorable Secretary of the Treasury, an Assistant of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Mr. Edwin Smith, was detailed. to carry out the work at Gaithersburg. At Ukiah, Cal.; it was necessary to employ an observer, and the charge of .the work was given to Mr. Frank Schlesinger. A detailed account of the methods of observation, and other considerations of a theoretical nature, will be found in Appendix No. 5 of this Report.
n.
COMPARISON OF MAGNETIC INSTRUMENTS IN EUROPE.

In order to have a thoroughly reliable comparison of the Coast and ·Geodetic Survey magnetic instruments with those used in the European observatories, Assistant Bauer was charged with the task of carrying this project into effect. He left the United States in September and returned on the 19th of December. During this time he visited England, France, Germany, and Russia, and compared the instruments taken with him with the best standard instruments of these countries.

INVESTIGATION OF HYDROGRAPHIC METHODS.

Assistant Yates was charged with the examination of ·some of the principal hydrographic methods employed in England and Continental Europe. Leaving the United States in April, he was engaged until the close of the fiscal year in this work.
13.

LOCATION OF CABLE.

It having been decided to lay a submarine cable between West Chop Light-House and Nobska Light-House, Vineyard Haven, Mass., an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was detailed to determine its location at the time it was put down.
14. INVESTIGATION OF METHODS EMPLOYED IN THE MARCONI SYSTEM OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.

Prof. S. W. Stratton, Inspector of Standards, Office of Weights and Measures, was directed to report to Admiral Farquhar, U. S. N., commanding the North Atlantic fieet 1 late in October, to witness the test by the Navy Department of the Marconi system of .

15. CAPE CHARLES CITY SPEED TRIAL COURSE.

The Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Endeavor, at the request of the Navy Department, laid out a speed trial course, in September, at Cape Charles City, Va.
16. LOCATION OF BUOYS ON CAPE CHARLES CITY SPEED TRIAL COURSE.

At the request of the Navy Department, an assistant of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was detailed, on March 26, to assist in the location of buoys at the ends of the trial course off Cape Charles City, Va.
17. CRUISE OF THE PATHFINDER.

The Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Pathfinder, which was completed just before the beginning of the fiscal year, made the trip from Washington, D. C., to San Francisco, Cal., under the command of Assistant Perkins. The trip proved to be a successful and rapid one. A full description of the voyage, written by the commander, and accompanied by a chart showing positions and dates, is given in another part of this Report.
18. BRUNSWICK OUTER BAR.

A resurvey of the outer bar at Brunswick, which, according to law, was to be made by an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey under the direction of the Secretary of War, was executed by Assistant Marindin, between August and December, 1899. Assistant Marindin reported to the Secretary of War, through the Chief of Engineers, and received, on August 12, instructions to make the survey under the provisions of the river and harbor act of June 3, 1896, and as amended by the river and harbor act of March 3, 1899. The work continued until the middle of November, when the party returned to Washington. A report was submitted to the Secretary of War on the 4th of Decem her.
19. ALASKA PROVISIONAL BOUNDARY.

On December 20, 1899, Assistant Superintendent 0. H. Tittmann was appointed commissioner of the United States for the purpose of marking the temporary boundary line between Alaska and British Columbia, as defined by the modus vivendi agreed to by the United States and Great Britain under date of October 20, I 899. After several conferences with the British commissioner, Mr. W. F. King, in Ottawa and Washington, the plan of work was adopted, and Mr. Tittmann left Washington on May 12. Assistant 0. B. French was assigned to duty under Mr. Tittmann's direction, as United States engineer, to execute the necessary field work. The Commission reached the field of work early in June and the work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

Assistant Charles A. Schott, who was appointed Chief of the Computing Division in 1855, and whose active service in the Coast and Geodetic Survey dates back to 1848, was relieved of the charge of this Division on the 1st of January, 1900, and this duty was assigned to Assistant J. F. Hayford. · buring the first half of the fiscal year, while Assistant Schott remained in charge of the Computing Division, work was done on the transcontinental triangulation, the report for which was submitted on the 5th of September, 1899. After this date, until the 1st of January, attention was given to the preparation of a report on the oblique arc along the Atlantic coast. The work carried on by the different computers was largely of a routine nature, and consisted in the revision of star places, geodetic operations, abstracts of horizontal directions, etc. During the last half of the fiscal year, as before mentioned, the Computing Division was in charge of Assistant J. F. Hayford, and the work continued much on the same lines as had been previously followed. The work of this Division, as stated by Mr. Hayford, falls naturally into four classes: ( 1) Supplying information of various kinds to field parties and to persons outside the Survey; (2) final computations or revisions of computations in connection with recent field operations; (3) computations which are necessary to reduce older fieldwork to a standard datum; (4) the preparation of results for publication. Some idea of the amount of work involved in the first class may be had from the statement that during the month of February alone 180 descriptions of stations, many of them including sketches, and all accompanied by a statement of geographic positions, were furnished to various parties. The two prominent pieces of work which were pushed with energy during the last half of the fiscal year were the computation of the triangulation in southeastern Alaska and the adjustment of the precise level net. The combined length of the level lines, of which the results were published for the first time in Appendix No. 8, Report for 1899, is over 2 800 kilometers. Of this, l 300 kilometers was leveling done in 1899, and 1 500 kilometers was old leveling in which the office computations. were either incomplete or had not been commenced on January l, 1900.

The establishment of a Division of Terrestrial Magnetism has brought about increased office duties in this line. During the fiscal year the final report on the magnetic survey of Maryland was made. The preparation was begun of magnetic declination tables for the use of surveyors. The field computation of the current magnetic observations were revised. A new discussion of the secular variation of declination at stations where new values were available was also made. Original records were prepared for binding, including about 200 volumes. The values of annual changes in declination, dip, and horizontal intensity were collected for all stations reoccupied since 1880. Two chapters were written for the report of the Magnetic Survey of North Carolina, one on the secular variaticm, the other 011 the distribution of the magnetic declination. Copy for the printer was prepared for the report just mentioned. Miscellaneous computations and revisions were also carried on, and a list of the magnetic declinations at about 3 ooo places, for publication in the Tide Tables for 1901, was prepared. Much time was devoted to the study of the plans of foreign magnetic observatories, and the preparation of plans and specifications for a magnetic observatory to be erected at Cheltenham.

harmonic constants used for predicting some of the ports have been greatly improved, a number of additional subordinate stations were introduced, and better values given for many old stations. Nonharmonic reductions were made for thirty-seven stations, the equivalent of about five years of continuous records of high and low waters. Harmonic analyses were completed for several short series of hourly heights, and several series of a year each have been partially analyzed, the total work being equivalent to the complete analysis of one year of continuous record. A beginning was made in collecting together the harmonic tidal constants for the world, and although not completed at present, the list contains 248 stations, for which 503 years of harmonic analysis have been made. The following tidal records were received during the year: From the Maritime Exchange, at Philadelphia, Pa., one year's automatic gauge record at Reedy Island Quarantine Station, Delaware. Three months of automatic gauge record at Great Fox Islands, Virginia, made in
1895.

From the United States engineers, records at the places named below and for the time stated: Fort Carroll, Patapsco River, Maryland, more than two years; Fort Sumter, Charleston Harbor, Sottth Carolina, nearly four years; St. Simons Light, Georgia, one year; Brunswick Outer Bar, Georgia, one year and three months; Galveston, Texas, 3 ye~rs; Galveston Bar, Texas, one year; Galveston Entrance, Texas, one year; Morgans Point, Galveston Bay, Texas, one year. From the Mississippi River Commission, the record at Biloxi", Miss., for three years. From the commandant of the Puget Sound Naval Station, Bremerton, Wash., the record at that place from July l to January 15. Tracings from the record of the automatic tide gauge 'at Honolulu, H. I., were received for the calendar years 1897, 1898, and 1899. From the three foreign ports named below, tidal records were received for the periods specified: Manzanilla, Mexico, one month; Valparaiso, Chile, one year; Port Chalmers, New Zealand, one year. A tracing for one month from the record of the automatic gauge at Recife Arsenal, :Pernambuco, Brazil, was obtained. In the last Annual Report some account was given of an attempt to partially explain the origin of the principal tides upon a rational basis. This work has since been continued by Dr. R. A. Harris, who has prepared Part IV-A of the Manual of Tides, which is published as Appendix No. 7 to this Report under the title "Outlines of Tidal Theory. " Fifteen years of automatic tide gauge records have been tabulated as hourly heights of the sea, ready for harmonic analysis. The plane of reference has been deten;'Iined for 37 stations in San Francisco and San Pablo bays, California, by comparison of their observations with simultaneous tides at Sausalito, or the Presidio. -Tide notes were prepared for 205 stations on 64 charts. Requisitions from 17 field parties were filled, requiring descriptions of 208 bench marks, tidal data for 225 stations, and current data for 68 stations. Tidal information was called for by 121 persons not connected with the Survey, the response to which required the preparation of 237

descriptions· of bench marks, current tables for 50 stations, and tidal data for 635 stations. There were received, examined, and registered in the Tidal Division an aggregate of about thirty-one years of record from automatic tide gauges, together with 121 original and l 13 duplicate volumes of tidal observa:ions made by 17 hydrographic parties, and the record of the currents at 8 stations. About five years of tabulated hourly heights of the sea, with the times and heights of high and low waters, were also received.

The Drawing and Engraving Division is one of the important divisions of the Office. The work was divided into four sections, namely, the Drawing, Engraving, Printing, Photographing and Electrotyping sections. Each one of these had its own particular work, and all the work was coordinated to bring about the completion of finished charts. During the year 287 calls for information were made upon the Division, involving areas, shore Ii.nes, distances between various points, tracings from original topographic and hydrographic sheets, copies of old and canceled charts, construction of special maps, negatives, blue prints, etc.

DRAWING SECTION.

In the Drawing Section a number of new features were introduced during the year ·which greatly facilitated the work and 'economized time and labor. Prominent among these features may be mentioned the "history sheets,'' on which are preserved, i_n compact fom1, records of all materials and authorities embodied in new charts. Every detail and authority used upon charts published by this O~e is here shown. These sheets enable the Chief of the Division to determine at once the date on which any correction was applied and the authority for such correction. The history sheets are a most important addition to the records of the Section. Another feature of the records initiated during the year is the card index of original sheets, which contains a history of all sheets and schemes for charts and which shows what is required in the way of inking, lettering, approval, etc., to complete the

sheet. As soon as the original sheet is finally approved, or the drawing for a new chart is completed, its card is removed from the index and filed. This feature is found to be a great timesaver and, taken in connectimi with the history sheets and the standard proof upon which the details of the correction are shown, completes such a record of the charts and sheets as will enable anyone in future years to determine the history of each chart. There were an unusually large number of charts drawn during the year. A complete record of the occupation of each draftsman is kept on the files of the Office. The following drawings have been completed dt,rring the year for photolithographing and engraving:

Three hundred and ninety-three charts were revised, corrected, and verified for new editions or reprints. Forty-six topographic and thirty-five hydrographic projections have been constructed for the use of the Office or field parties, and six projections have been made on copper plates. Three hundred and thirty-one topographic and hydrographic sheets were in hand for lettering, inking, platting, or revision. Clark~'s spheroid projection was applied to thirty-one old sheets.

The Inspector of Charts, in addition to the superV1s1on of the work of the Division, gave personal attention to the final inspection of new charts and new editions in their various stages of progress. The work of the Division was divided into two sections, the Chart Section and the Hydrographic Section.
r.

CHART SECTION.

Jn this section all correspondence was earned on, and the bookkeeping relating to the business of the sales agents was done. C9rrections to printed charts were made before they were issued to the different parties requiring them. Besides the duties just mentioned, auxiliary ones, such as coloring, mounting, etc., were perforn1ed. Bulletin No. 36, a Table of Depths for Channels and Harbors of the United States, was prepared, as well as a new edition of the Title and Notes for Charts. Several schemes for new charts were made, and studies of other charts already existing were made with a view to their improvement.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

Omitting the years 1898 and 1899, during which the issue of charts was abnormally large, a comparison with issues during the past ten years shows that during the year 1900 the total issue was 19 per cent larger than the average. The free distribu· tion was 16 per cent larger than the av~age, and the net sales were greater by 23 per cent, both in copies and in value. Nine hundred and ninety-four copies of the Chart Catalogue were distributed. A new edition of this Catalogue is in preparation. Twelve chart agencies were established during the year, while 1 was discontinued, leaving the total number of agencies now existing 17!.

HYDROGRAPHIC SECTION.

In the Hydrographic Section the charts were corrected, and the monthly notices to mariners were prepared. This required considerable digesting of material, and the work is so complex that .it can not well be described briefly. In this section the sheets as they came from the field were platted and verified and proofs were revised. The following table gives the statistics in this section for the fiscal year 1899-1990:

?~:~:~ment

The duties of the Instrument Division consist in the accounting for all instruments and general property, whether in the field, on the vessels, or in storage. It also involves the repair of instruments, the design and construction of new apparatus, and experimental work. New instruments which have been selected for purchase are tested in this Division. Besides the routine duties already mentioned, the Instrument Division carried on experiments with a new form of lamp, designed for the purpose of furnishing signals for triangulation parties. The light-giving power of the lamp supplied in the instrument shop with an 8-inch reflector appeared to be, at a distance of 10 miles, about five or six times as great as the usual form of signal lamp used on the Survey. Two new theodolites, Nos. 167 and 168, were completed. To provide the international latitude stations at Gaithersburg and at Ukiah with the necessary apparatus for their observations, two meridian marks were made at the Coast Survey Office during the past year. They consist of two horizontal scales, etched upon opal glass and mounted on longitudinal slides, which are fastened to an iron T-bar. The apparatus enables the observer to frequently check the azimuth of the instrument, which is mounted eccentrically, as well as to determine the value of the two latitude levels without removing them. These meridian marks were made after pl~ns furnished by the International Geodetic Association. Eight new level rods were begun, to provide for a contemplated increase in the precise level parties. Two new precise levels were constructed and finished in time to be issued to field parties. A description of these leveling instruments is published in Appendix No. 6 to this Report.

GENERAL STATEMENT.

The work of the Library and Archives Division may be classed into general matters of routine, accessions, indexing, shelf arrangement, binding, and special work. During the year the books have been examined, with special reference to their serviceableness. Those of little value have been sent to the upper floors, and others have been transferred to the Library of Congress. About 5 ooo pamphlets were classified and added to the book shelves. The new terrestrial magnetism collection, purchased in Europe, was indexed and shelved. One hundred and ninety-nine volumes were collated and sent to the bindery. More than one-half the astronomical records are indexed, entrance being made for each station occupied, T;wo hundred and five volumes of magnetic records, prepared in the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, and 87 volumes of tidal books, prepared in the . Tidal Division, were bound. Original bibliographic work was carried on in Washington and Philadelphia libraries by the librarian, in connection with the bibliography of the surveys of Mason and Dixon's line.
2.

ACCESSIONS ..

The accessions to the library are by exchange and purchase. Those of the exchanges which are not useful to the Survey are sent to the Library of Congress. Much more is now being received, however, from geodetic and hydrographic institutions than heretofore. A rare and valuable collection on terrestrial magnetism, chiefly pamphlets and separates, was selected and purchased during the summer of 1899. The following table gives statistics of the library accessions:

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900. 3. INDEXING.

The current accessions to the library, the pamphlets on terrestrial magnetism, and some 200 maps of Alaska were indexed. The most important work, however, in this direction, which was begun early last year, was the. indexing of' the astronomical work. The volumes for Alaska, the Pacific Coast States, the Rocky Mountain States, the Southern States and part of the Middle Atlantic States have been thoroughly examined and entry made in the index for each station and subject. At the request of the Librarian of Congress a complete list of all serials and periodicals currently received in the Survey library was compiled.
4. SHELF ARRANGEMENT.

A collection of pamphlets, which had heretofore been stored in somewhat large and cumbersome tin boxes, was taken out, labeled and classified, and placed alongside the books, according to the subjects to which they belonged. As fast as new pamphlets are received they are put into temporary pasteboard covers and treated as books. Newspaper clippings on shipwrecks, dangers to navigation, survey work, and a variety of other subjects of interest are placed in book-sized portfolios and arranged by subjects with the books and pamphlets. As a result, all of the literature on any given subject is now to be found classified in its proper place on the shelves. A number of dupl!cates and material little used were taken to the top floor of the fire-proof building, and have been put in storage where they are easily accessible if wanted. These include old Coast Pilots, duplicates of the Nautical Almanac, United States legal reports, etc.
5. BINDING.

Two hundred and five volumes, classified by the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, have been bound, in which form they are more convenient for general use. The Tidal Division arranged tide books for the State of New York. These were bound into eighty-seven volumes, and are arranged on the shelves in numerical order.
6. ISSUES.

An arrangement was effected by which the bulletins of new accessions were circulated among the field officers and ships, and blank forms have been printed for use when the temporary loan of new books and periodicals is desired. Considerable use was made of this privilege. The Library al80 acts as an intermediary for loans from the Library of Congress. Works required for official use can be called for and obtained through the Library of the Survey.
7. SPECIAL WORK.

The Librarian having been directed by the Superintendent, in the spring of 1899, to prepare a bibliography of material bearing on Mason and Dixon's line, utilized all of his spare time and .opportunities to push this work. Examinations were made at the Pennsylvania Historical Society, Philadelphia, and in the city of Washington.

Upon being relieved of the charge of the Computing Division on January 1, 1900, Assistant C. A. Schott was directed to continue the discussion of the Oblique Arc along the Atlantic Coast and the work.of reducing the California triangulation. Two computers were assigned to assist the Chief, and thewhole energy of the Section was devoted to continuing the computation of the Oblique Arc, with the following result: The triangulation was completely adjusted to fit the six base lines and to satisfy the geometric conditions. The results are in shape for publication. The geographic positions were computed from Connecticut to Louisiana, on the same data as developed for the Transcontinental Triangulation. There are 17 longitude stations, 71 latitude stations, and 55 azimuth stations, in the Obliqur Arc. The longitude results are ready. for publication. The greater part of the latitude results are also ready, and the azimuths only require transcribing. . Jn the arc section was read the proof of Special Publication No. 4 "The Transcontinental Triangulation,'' which was exceptionally laborious.

The steamer Blake, W. C. Hodgkins, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, was at Washington on the 1st of July, 1899, having just returned from her season on the south coast of Porto Rico. On July 12 the vessel. left Washington for Boston, Mass., where she was to be thoroughly examined by the United States local inspectors, and where certain hydrographic examinations were to be made. The order was subsequently modified to the extent of directing her to stop at New York City, in order to leave an alco-vapor launch at the builder's works in Je~sey City. The vessel arrived at New York on July 16, the launch was landed on the ·17th, and the trip to Boston was resumed the same day. She arrived on the afternoon of the 19th. The contemplated inspection of the ship's hull was made, and the state of the vessel was found to be such that it was recommended that the vessel be docked for further examination. It was decided, however, that this should be postponed until the completion of the work on the Monomoy and Nantucket shoals; and the vessel therefore left for Hyannisport on the 7th of August, and on the 9th began the field work at the localities mentioned. Fog, which was very prevalent during the period, materially retarded the progress of the work. Hydrography, however, was done on eleven days, during which time 208·4 nautical miles of sounding lines were run. Four thousand nine hundred and seventyfour soundings were made and 2 586 sextant angles observed. In addition to the above the position of the Nantucket Shoals light-vessel was determined by sextant

observations made on the vessel, the time being carried from Hyannisport. The hydrography closed on September 14, and the Blake then proceeded to Boston. On September IS au examination was begun of a certain shoal spot reported off Boston Entrance. The Blake went into the dry dock on the 17th and came out on the 27th. Work was closed at Boston on the:: 17th of October, at which date hydrography had been executed on thirteen days. Seventy and five-tenths nautical miles soundings had been run, 4 080 soundings had been made, and 1. 932 sextant angles had been measured. The vessel now proceeded to Baltimore, where she arrived on October 21. On the 26th she was hauled out on Spedden's Marine Railway, at Canton, and the work of tearing out and rebuilding her stern was at once begun. On December 21 the vessel was run off the railway, and from this date until the 31st of December she lay at the wharf, the carpenters and ma~hinists in the meantime being employed on various minor repairs. The subsequent work of this vessel will be found under the heading ''Outlying Territory."

DETAILS OF FIELD OPERATIONS.

I2I

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.

1o8 magnetic stations occupied. 2 sites examined for magnetic observatory. Constants of magnetometers Nos. 3, 18, and 19 determined. 10 dip circles compared. 4 magnetometers compared. 2 magneto~aphs compared. Magnetic instruments compared with those at Kew, Potsdam, Pawlowsk, Pare St. Maur, ·and Darmstadt.

During the year important work was done under the direction of the Inspector of Magnetic Work. The operations may be conveniently treated under four heads: I. The determination of constants; II. Examination of sites for a magnetic observatory; III. The regular magnetic observations of the party, and IV. Comparisons of instruments.
r

I.

THE DETERMINATION OF CONSTANTS.

The constants of magnetometer No. 3 were determined at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, in Washington, by Mr. Hazard; and those of magnetometers Neis. 18 and 19 by Mr. Vehrenkamp, in July arid August, 1899.
II. EXAMINATION OF SITES FOR A MAGNETIC OBSERVATORY.

It being desirable to establish a magnetic observatory base station near Washington, examination was made in the vicinity for a suitable locality. The first investigations were made at Gaithersburg, Md., on the lot now occupied by the International Geodetic Association for the observation of astronomic latitude. Various points were selected on this piece of ground and complete examinations made. In addition, the magnetic elements at nine places within a radius of 9 miles of the locality were determined. These places were Waring, Middlebrook, Cross Roads I, Cross Roads II, Redland, Derwood, Hunting, Quince Orchard, and Seneca. These observations revealed marked local disturbances, the values of the declination varying from o 0 51' W. at Waring, 3 miles northwest of Gaithersburg, to 8° 24' W. at Derwood, 3 miles southeast of the same place. Even on the International Geodetic Association ground, comprising about 2 acres, values of the declination differing one-half degree were obtained. These observations were made by Messrs. Fleming and Vehrenkamp. Following this work, -Mr. Fleming examined the grounds of the State Reformatory School at Cheltenham, 16 miles southeast of Washington. Three points on the grounds were occupied, and four in the immediate vicinity within a radius of about 1 mile, and a complete determination of the magnetic elements made at each point. The results indicate that the distribution of magnetism !s quite unifonn over this area, and show that between this point and the one at Gaithersburg the· preference should be given to Cheltenham.
III. THE REGULAR MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

Regular magnetic observations were made in th~ following places: Rkode Island.-By Mr. Hazarp.: Boston Neck on August 8 and 9; and McSparran Hill on August 26 .. These points are in the neighborhood of Narragansett Pier.

122

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

Maryland.-Observations were made at the following stations: Centerville, Cheltenham, Corunna, Dickerson, Easton, Hagerstown, and Gaithersburg. Linden, the base station of the magnetic survey of Maryland, was reoccupied by Mr. Fleming on July 5, 6, 7, and 8. · Virginia.-The following stations were occupied and all the magnetic elements determined: Arlington (near Warrenton), Calverton, Milford, Manassas, Culpeper, Charlottesville, Natural Bridge, Staunton, Covington, Greenwood, Orange, Fredericksburg, Rectortown, Strasburg, Winchester, Salem, Monterey, Warm Springs, Goshen, Burketown, Harrisonburg. West Virginia.-All the magnetic elements were determined at the following places: Morgantown, Kingwood, Romney, Martinsburg, Charleston, Lewisburg, Hinton, Beckley. Fayetteville, Summersville, Clay, Charlestown, Winfield, West Union, Ripley, Princeton, Welch, Falls Post-Office, Moorefield, Baileysville, Oceana, Glebe, Bushy Run, Franklin, Cave Post-Office, Williamson, Logan, Travellers Repose, Madison, Marlinton, Hamlin, Mingo, Addison, Camden. North Carolina.-In connection with the total eclipse, May 28, magnetic observations (absolute and variation) were made at Rocky Mount and at Wadesboro. Ohio.-Tbe magnetic declination and, intensity were determined at Cincinnati, on the grounds of the observatory, on August 2.1 and 22, by Mr. Vehrenkamp. New Mexico.-All three magnetic elements were determined by Mr. Fleming at Lumberton, November 28; Tres Piedras, November 30; Santa Fe, December 2 to 4; Albuquerque, December 5 to 7; Fort Wingate, December 9; Grants, December II; Socorro, December 13 and 14; Fort Craig, December 16; East Las Vegas, December 18 and 19; Springer; December 22 and 23, and Clayton, December 26. Colorado.-The three magnetic elements were determined by Mr. Fleming at Denver, November 14 and 15; Pueblo, November 17 and 18, and Conejos, November 21 and 22. . Texas.-A station at Amarillo was occupied by Mr. Fleming on December 31, and magnetic observations made.
IV. COMPARISONS OF INSTRUMENTS.

Between September 8 and December 18, Assistant Bauer was engaged in comparing magnetometer No. 18, and Dip Circle 56-4 440, with the standard instruments at the following European observatories: Kew (near London), Potsdam (near Berlin), Pawlowsk (near St. Petersburg), and Pare St. Maur (near Paris). The dip circle was also compared with Prof. K. Schering's earth inductor, at Darmstadt, Germany. Besides inspecting the general arrangements and the installation of instruments at the above-named observatories, the observatory at Utrecht was visited, and the compass departments of the Russian admiralty at St. Petersburg, of the German Naval Observatory at Hamburg, and the English Admiralty at Deptford (near London) were inspected.

East River: 70·3 miles sounding lines. Off Coney Island: 45·8 miles sounding lines.

On June 29, 1899, J. B. Boutelle, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, received instructions for hydrographic work in New York Harbor. The party left Washington, D. C., on July 15, 1899, in the schooner Eagre, and proceeded to New York, arriving there on July 19. After about a week of rain and fog, hydrographic work was commenced in the East River on July 27, over an area extending from the west side of Governors Island to the Battery, and up the East River to beyond Coenties Reef. Owing to the immense traffic passing through here it was found impracticable to work from a launch or small boat of any kind, and a tug was hired for the purpose. The above area was first covered by sounding lines, run 50 meters apart, and special search was made for obstructions and for shoal spots off the Battery shown on the chart, but without s~ccess. A drag was then procured from Major Adams, United States Engineers, consisting of a flat barge with an attachment of heavy vertical iron pipes on either side and a horizontal pipe about 40 feet long at the bottom, held in place forward and aft by rope guys. This could be" set at any required depth and towed over the area to be searched. By means of this drag a sunken wreck was found off the South Ferry Slip, lying in about 30 feet of water and having about 17 feet over it at its highest point. Search with the drag failed to find the 24-foot spots off the Battery shown on the published chart, but a small ledge \vas developed there with 27 feet over it.' The drag

was then run, set at 30 feet M.L. W., over the channel for entering or leaving East River on what is known as the '' Arbuckle Range.'' The shoalest sounding obtained on this range was 32 feet, and with the drag set at 30 feet no bottom was found over a space from loo to 200 feet on either side of this range. ' Three triangulation points, Governors Island 2, New York Produce Exchange, and Dow's Eleyator, were occupied with a theodolite, and the geographic positions determined of the Central Elevator and northwest corner of St. Margaret's Hotel (formerly Arbuckle Flats), which form the ''Arbuckle Range,'' and also of several other prominent objects. · The Eagre was then put upon a dry dock in Erie Basin, for inspection anq repairs to the hull, and the party was engaged in computing and platting the East River work until September 2 r, when, at the request of Lieut. Commander J. C. Fremont, supervisor, harbor of New York, an examination was made of the dumping ground off Coney Island. Lieut. Commander Fremont placed the tug Argus at the disposal of the party, and sounding lines were run about 200 meters apart over an area indicated by him. The work in this vicinity was closed, and on Septem her 30 the vessel sailed for Baltimore, arriving there on October 3.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.

Revision of charts from Cape May to Sandy Hook. 1 position for light-house determined. 150 square miles triangulation. 53 stations occupied.

The charts covering the coast of New Jersey have, for some time, needed revision. In order to accomplish this, instructions were issued, u11der date of May 26, 1899 to Assistant 0. B. French, to proceed to Cape May and undertake the revision of all the charts from that locality northward to Sandy Hook. The plan proposed was to occupy known triangulation stations with the theodolite, and from them determine subsidiary points to be used in locating new features in the neighborhood; this last location to be made by the best means available, either direct measurement or the obser:vation of angles with the sextant. Assistant French arrived at Cape May on July x. He immediately began a reconnaissance, and discovered that a great number of changes had taken place since the map now used was published. The original topographic sheet was photographed in the Office, and a copy was carried to the field, and upon thi.s copy the necessary corrections were made. By this means the Cape May sheet was corrected in a rapid and economical manner, and with all the accuracy necessary for the purposes intended. Sufficient triangulation points were fo~nd to locate subsidiary points for all the work along the coast. In many cases it was . necessary to depend on local maps, especially where towns were involved; but these were found to be generally sufficiently accurate for the purpose. South of Barnegat enough tnangulation stations were found for use in this work; but north of the last-mentioned point very few stations could be recovered, and those that were found were so situated that they were of little use in the absence of high signals for observations. It therefore became necessary to carry on a scheme of triangulation from Barnegat light-house to Sandy Hook, a distance of about 50 miles. The stations selected were generally cupolas, church spires, flagstaffs, etc., which made the occupation of many eccentric stations necessary. Care, however, was always taken to locate the exact position of the instrument accurately, so that the observations could be reduced with a sufficient degree of exactness to answer the purpose. Toward the end of September the health of Assistant French became seriously impaired and he was obliged to relinquish field work. The operations were continued by Mr. F. F. Weld, Aid, Coast and Geodetic Survey, who had joined the party on August 1, and who carried out the scheme, under direction of Assistant French, with complete success. . The field work ended in November and Aid Weld returned to Washington on the 12th.

COAST AND GEODETIC SGR VEY REPORT, 1900.

Sufficient data were collected during the season to bring all the topographic sheets along the New Jersey coast up to date, with the exception, however, of a few places on the Western Bay, which was not inclu4ed in the original programme. South of Bay Head there are few places where material changes occur, and those sheets may be considered as practically up to date. This region was surveyed about thirty-five years ago, and very few artificial features then existing could be found. The streams, sloughs, and bays lying farther inland remain practically as they were a generation ago. The smaller channels, where the current is sluggish, are filling slowly; but the larger ones, which serve as the immediate outflow to the sea, undergo great modification with every stonn. The bars at the mouths of the inlets are generally very shoal, few having more than 2 or 3 feet of water in their deepest channels at low tide. Assistant French was absent at home from September 23 to December 6. On the latter date he returned to the office in Washington and began preparing the data collected along the New Jersey coast. This lasted until the 12th of May, when he wa& detailed to the party of Assistant Superintendent 0. H. Tittmann, to be engaged in marking the provisional Alaska boundary, as agreed upon in the modus vivendi of October 20, 1899. While stationed at the office in Washington, Assistant French received orders to locate the position for the West Bank light-house in New York Harbor, in Lower New York Bay. Leaving Washington on the 21st of March, the work was completed on I the 29th.

Assistant Young was attached to the party of Assistant J. F. Pratt, on board the steamer Patterson, making a hydrographic survey of the Yukon Delta, from the 1st of July to the 31st of October. During the season he located four-buoys and two range beacons to mark the channei through the fiats off the Apoon Entrance to the Yukon, and was engaged in triangulation in Golofnin Bay and on hydrography in Safety Harbor. The details of this work are set forth in the report of Assistant Pratt. On the return of the Patterson to Seattle, Assistant Young was detached on November 1 from the ship and was employed at the suboffice; making computations of the field work .. He also had charge of the suboffice under the direction of Assistant Pratt. On December 5 he left Seattle for Washington, where he arrived on the 10th,. Leave was taken unti~ the 31st. From the beginning of the year to the IIth of March Assistant Young was employed on the computation pertaining to the work of Assistant G. R. Putnam in the survey of the Yukon Delta. On February 20 he proceeded to Woods Hole, Mass., where a telephone cable was located. This work is described in a special report. Relieving Assistant Yates of the command of the steamer Endeavor on March 12, he proceeded with the ship to Old Point Comfort on the 26th, in order to locate buoys marking the ends of the trial course for ships of the Navy off Cape Charles City. The details of this work are set forth in a special report. . The Endeavor returned to Baltimore, where she remained until the 8th of May, undergoing slight repairs. On the latter date she sailed for Philadelphia, having the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography on board. Assistant Young's instructions were to investigate certain reported shoals and obstructions and also to make a general hydrographic survey of the channel from Newcastle to Bombay Hook . . From the I 1th to the 20th of May the ship was lying at the wharf at Philadelphia, and the officers were employed in copying descriptions and positions of stations at the Office· of the United States Engineers. Signals were erected between May 22 and 27, and from the latter date to the close of the fiscal year the hydrographic work was carried on continuously. A complete hydrographic survey was made during the month of June. This included the channel below Pennsville, the cross lines being 200 feet apart and extending some distance on each side of the channel.

Acting under instructions of June 21, 1899, Assistant Bowie, with his party, took the field on July 6 for the topographic resurvey of the vicinity of Havre de Grace, Md. The headquarters of the party were first located that place, and as the work progressed, successively transferred to Aberdeen, Port Deposit, and Northeast. The shore line of this work had already been run by Assistant Hodgkins during the previous season, so that there now remained only the inland topography. Between Perrymans station and Havre de Grace the country is low and heavily wooded, so that it was necessary to resort to plane-table traverse lines in order to control the topography. The limits of the work extended from the shore line back to the main country road between Havre de Grace and Port Deposit, on both sides ·of the river. The topographic features are quite diversified, and the irregular contours rendered the work difficult and made progress somewhat slow. From Perryville eastward as far as Northeast the country is rolling, with contours of regular intervals. All of the triangulation points located by Assistant Perkins in 1898 were recovered. Of the old points established many years ago all were lost except Principio astronomic station, which was found and identified. Assistant Bowie returned to Washington on November 16. He took leave of absence until December 5, at which time he reported to Assistant R. L. Faris, then engaged in computing his Alaskan work. On the 23d of December instructions were issued to'Assistant Bowie to proceed to Baltimore and locate the new bridges across Curtis Creek and Cabin Branch. This involved the execution'of about 2~ miles of topography on the new road connecting the two bridges. The original topographic sheets were taken· 'to the field and the

The topography of Kent Island and vicinity was resumed by J. W. Donn, Extra Observer, Coast and Geodetic Survey, near the close of the previous fiscal year. Instructions were issued on June 6, 1899. The party took the field soon thereafter, and work was begun on the 20th. By the close of the fiscal year the shore line on the west side .of Kent Island was completed. ' The entire month of July was devoted to the watershed on 'the western side, and this was completed by the close of the month. The plan adopted by the Superintendent was to carry on topography and hydrography at the same time, the latter being executed by Assistant Welker, on the steamer Bache. In order that advantageous cooperation might be maintained between the two parties, Extra Observer Donn transferred his operations to Wades Point, near Claiborne, about August r. While awaiting the arrival of the hydrographic party the work was carried on in the region known as Bayside, and at intervals points for the extension of the triangulation up Eastern Bay and Miles River were established. The station Boz, on Tilghmans Point, was found to be impracticable as a turning point for the triangulation, and Dixon was established, a few miles south. From this point the triangulation can be carried up Miles River, and also an advantageous connection made with the preceding work. The hydrographic party arrived on the 7th of August, and arrangements were immediately made with Assistant \\r elker for such cooperation as would secure the most economical results. There were few trigonometric points available for the work in Eastern Bay. This condition necessitated laying aside the topographic work for the time being, and made necessary an extension of the triangulation before other work could be done.

line Royal to Oak, the topography in the mea_ntime keeping pace with this work, and there was executed the work on Bodkin and Parsons Islands, on Turkey Point, and the shoreline of Eastern Bay from Greenwood to Bennetts Point. The stations occupied in the triangulation are shown on the accompanying sketch, where the trigonometric points are clearly indicated. Between October 26 and November 30 the shoreline of Eastern Bay, from the mouth of Greenwood Creek to the south point of Shipping Creek, was finished. The entire work of the season was based upori trigonometric points directly, or upon plane-table determinations by intersections. By this means errors of distortion in the sheets were distributed as evenly as possible. The determination of the details was, therefore, the result of, trigonometric work, ·and not of traverse or plane-table triangulation. The sketch shows the entire season's work ~nd includes the shoreline of Eastern Bay and Miles River, as well as the whole extent of Kent Island except a small portion at the northern end which was executed during the previous season.

Instructions were issued on June 29 to Assistant Flemer to take up the triangulation and topography of the west shore of Chesapeake Bay, .from Bay Ridge to c;urtis Point, including the triangulation of the South River, with the adjacent topography. The party located near the mouth of the South River on July 14. The instruments, baggage, and lumber were transferred from Bay Ridge to Arundel-on-the-Bay on the following day. A reconnaissance developed the fact that a number of triangulation points established by Assistant F. W. Perkins during the previous season had disappeared. This necessitated the reestablishment of stations known as ''Thomas 2 '' and "Gowan 2," and from the triangle just north of this line and defined by the points !'Hill 2," "Selby," and "Arundel," the triangulation was carried up the river as far as Taylorsville. Before making the triangulation the topography was executed from Bay Ridge south to Thomas Point, including the town of Arundel-on-the-Bay, which had recently been laid out. The stations occupied in the execution of the triangulation are shown on the accompanying sketch, as well as the topography based thereon and executed on both sides of the South River. Several concluded points were established, which are likewise shown in the sketch by dotted lines. The triangulation was completed on August 18, and on the following day th~ topography was begun. This was carried on continuously until September 9, when the members of the party began to suffer more or less from malarial fever. From the 9th to the 17th two members of the party, including Assistant Flemer, were confined to bed.

From the 14th to the 23d a third member was sick, and on the 15th and 16th all field work was suspended. During the period in which the party was more or less crippled by sickness, the men able for duty were engaged in erecting signals for topographic work in the upper part of the river, so that after sufficient members of the party had recovered to carry on work, it went on more rapidly than before. On October 18 the party was transferred from Edgewater to Steiners Landing, and the operations were continued in the vicinity of Rhode and West rivers. No triangulaNo, 4.

tion was made here, as the time was short arid it was desirable to have the shore line of the latter river for use in hydrographic work later. The topography was controlled by means of a plane-table triangulation, based on stations along the South River. On November 27 the party was disbanded, and on the 28th Assistant Flemer reported at the Office in Washington. Assistant Flemer was on duty in the Office until March 10, 1900, and during the remainder of the fiscal year was on leave of absence without pay.

Assistant W. I. Vinal assumed command of the schooner Matchless on the 1st of April, 1899, and on the 1st of July he was engaged in a hydrographic survey of the head of Chesapeake Bay, including the Susquehanna River to Port Deposit, and the Northeast River to the head of navigation. This work was finished on August 12. The party was then moved to Elk River, where the. work of 1898, including triangulation, topography, and hydrography, was continued to Elkton, Md. Similar operations were carried on along the Bohe~ia River and its two branches until the close of the seasqn's work. Twenty-two stations were occupied for horizontal angles. Tide gauges were established at Hopper's Wharf, Havre de Grace, and at Frenchtown on the Elk River, and on the drawpier of the bridge crossing the Bohemia River, and these were compared with the standard gauge at Reybold's Wharf, Elk River. Returning to Baltimore, the party was employed on office work until the end of the calendar year, the necessary repairs being carried out during the same time.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.

Patapsco River: · 59 miles sounding lines. 2 199 angles measured. 1 tide station established. 3 hydrographic sheets. Eastern Bay: 22 square miles triangulation. 9 stations occupied for horizontal angles. 17 geographic positions determined. 75 square miles hydrography. I 577 miles sounding lines. 24 690 angles measured. 3 tide stations established. :2 hydrographic sheets.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the steamer Bache was at Baltimore making special examinations for shoal spots in the Patapsco River, and arrangements for the hydrographic survey of Rock Creek. On the 5th of July these special examinations were completed. ' On the same day the steamer Bache was moved to Woodall's shipyard for repairs. These were completed on the 25th, and the party proceeded to Sea Girt, where a survey of the entrance to Rock Creek was made. A system of lines was run normal to the shore about 25 meters apart, and another system at right angles to this the same distance apart was executed. The outline of the channel entering the creek was located by the measurement of sextant angles at all principal bends. Work was commenced on July 31 and completed on August 3. On August 5 the dredged channel from Buoy No. 48 to the Canton elevator, Baltimore Harbor, was located and surveyed by running four lines of soundings parallel with the axis of the channel and crossing the same by a system of zigzag lines.

DETAILS OF FIELD OPERATIONS.

During the progress of all the hydrographic surveys thus far mentioned tide observations were made at Fort Carroll staff, and·an results were reduced to a plane of reference established at that point. On the 7th of August the steamer Backe, with party, moved to Eastern Bay, Maryland, for the purpose of making a hydrographic survey of that locality. · The Backe arrived at Eastern Bay on August 7. The locality to be surveyed was projected on two sheets, the lower one extending as far as Tilghmans Point, and the upper completing the locality to the upper end of the bay. Extra Observer John W. Donn, was ·engaged in topography in this vicinity, and was able to supply the party with the necessary shore line and triangulation for the lower sheet. By August 22 the hydrographic signals had 'been erected and located, and sounding was commenced. The main system of lines was rectangular, but in places requiring special development diagonal systems were used in addition. The lines were run approximately 200 meters apart. The necessary shore line and points on the upper sheet were ready oy October 9, and work was immediately begun. These were furnished by Extra Observer Donn, and wherever additional points were found necessary they were either determined by the plane table or by triangulation with the theodolite. The entire geographic position of the survey depends on the base line Wade 2 to Long 2, as furnished by the Office. The triangulation up to the mouth of the Miles River was executed by Extra Observer Donn's party, while north of this point the work was done by the party of Assistant Welker. Tide gauges for the reduction of the soundings were established at Claiborne and at Deep Water Point, near the mouth of the Miles River. The plane of reference was transferred from the Thomas Point light-house bench mark, established in 18g8, to Cl&iborne Wharf gauge, and from the latter it was transferred to the Miles River gauge, transfers being made by means of simultaneous readings at the gauges. A bench mark was also established at Bloody Point light"house, at the entrance to Eastern Bay. The party experienced considerable difficulty in procuring supplies, and in view of this fact it was thought best to make Baltimore the base, and make a trip whenever necesSa.ry to procure outfit and provisions. The hydrographic survey was executed on a scale of 1-20 ooo. About one-half the time was lost on account of unfavorable weather. Before completing the season's ;work a special examination of the Wye River was made, in obedience to instructions from the Superintendent of November 15. The shore.line was tested for about 2~ miles above the entrance by means of plane-table triangulation, and was found to agree, within the desired limits, with that of the published chart. On account of the lateness of the season only one day could be used to make an examination of the hydrography of the river. This was done by using Coast and Geodetic Survey Chart No. 135 as a guide, and checking the same by running a line of soundings through the center of the stream from the entrance of the river up through Back Wye River, through Wye Narrows, and down Front Wye River. The season's work closed on December 7, and the steamer was then taken to Baltimore and put into winter quarters. The remainder of the calendar year the party was engaged upon the records of th~ season's work, and the crew in overhauling and repairing the steamer. From December 18 to 31 Assistant Welker was on leave of absence,

On January 4 Assistant Welker was appointed presiding officer of a board of survey to report on the condition and appraise all the material in the Coast Survey store shed at Woodall's shipyard, in Baltimore. This work was finished on the 31st of March. In the meantime other work was done, consisting in the preparation of engineers' log books and an entire set of new fom1s for rendering reports, statistics, and accounts of Coast Survey vessels. These new forms were to be used after the transfer of the Navy complement. On the 1st of May instructions were received to take charge of the suboffice at Baltimore, Md. On the q.th of May the steamer Bache was taken from her winter quarters to Lower Canton, at Baltimore, for final overhauling and preparation for field work. In the meantime the office was turned over to the custodian of the building in which it was located, with au inventory of the property contained. therein. During the time the vessel was in winter quarters it was put in good repair by the force on board. Painting was done inside and out; the boiler, engine, launch, and small boats were thoroughly overhauled; numerous other small repairs were made, and all office work relating to the past season's operations, including the work on records, computations, reductions of tides and soundings, etc., was completed, with the exception of the platting of the soundings in Eastern Bay. All supplies and outfit were on board by May 21, and the steamer started for Washington in accordance with instrur.tions of May 14. On the 26th the vessel left for Norfolk, Va., with a party for the observation of the total eclipse of the sun. She returned on the 29th. On June I the steamer went to Baltimore, and preparations were at once commenced to take up the triangulation and hydrography of Chesapeake Bay below the Potomac River. On June 8 the steamer was taken to the working grounds, and the building of signals for triangulation and hydrography was at once begun. The progress of the

work was necessarily slow, as many of the lines of sight were 20 iu.iles long, and the occupation of a single station required many days on account of the impossibility of seeing signals through the hazy atmosphere. At the end of the fiscal year satisfactory progress had been made. Signals had been erected on the west shore from the mouth of the Potomac to the Rappahannock, and on the eastern shore from Highland Bar light to Tangier Sound light, far in advance of the triangulation. At the close of the fiscal year the vessel was still engaged in this work. Assistant Welker had leave of absence from the IIth till the 23d of June.

At the close of the previous fiscal year Assistant Charles C. Yates and party, on board the steamer Endeavor, were engaged in the hydrographic survey of Bush River, Maryland. The work continued after the 1st of July until the 17th, when orders were received by Assistant Yates to prepare the vessel for sea duty and for a change of commanding officers. On July 22 the command of the vessel was turned over to Mr. John Ross, Nautical Expert, at Baltimore, Md., who had received instructions to prc.oe·t~!d north and continue the examinations for the Coast Pilot in Long Island Sound., On the 23d Mr. Ross landed the party of Assistant Yates at Bush River and the operations were continued, the party now working on shore and having as an equipment a small launch belonging to the Endeavor, and a skiff hired for the purpose of sounding in shoal waters. The work proper began on the 26th of July, and was continued without interruption until the 31st of August, at which time it was brought to a successful conclusion. On 144

this same date Assistant Yates resumed the command of the steamer Endeavor, at Baltimqre, to which point she had just returned from her duties in Long Island Sound. Assistant Yates returned to Bush River, where he disbanded the shore party. The area covered by the survey in Bush River included all the tributaries from its mouth to the Pennsylvania Railroad bridge. Additional work was done in Romney Creek, and this completed the survey begun by the schooner Eagre during the previous season. A study of the survey of Bush River and Romney Creek shows no remarkable features or changes not developed by the original survey of 1889. From September 8 to September 28 the Endeavor was.engaged in the location of a speed trial course at Cape Charles City, Va. This work is described under special operations. The vessel returned to Baltimore after the completion of the field work, and was engaged in office work until the 12th of October, at which time the :report and accompanying records were transmitted to the Office. In view of the proposed deep-sea channel along the Sassafras River, from Chesapeake Bay to Delaware Bay, a survey of this region was undertaken on the 13th of October.

From that date until the 29th of November the work went on without interruption. The fact that only 6 square miles were covered, and that the number of soundings taken was more than 2 I ooo shows the character of the work. After the completion of the Sassafras River survey, the steamer Endeavor spent three days in Baltimore Harbor, and then, on December 3, took up some additional hydrographic development at the mouth of the Elk River, and in the vicinity of Pooles Island. There was much interruption in this work, owing to bad weather, which usually prevails at this season of the year, and it was not until the 17th of December that the operations were completed. The Endeavor then went into winter quarters at Baltimore. In accordance with instructions of the Superintendent the preparation of maps and data relating to changes in the upper Chesapeake Bay, as shown by the surveys of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was commenced about February 1 at the suboffice in Baltimore. The work was undertaken by Assistant Yates, in conjunction with the director and officers of the Maryland geological survey. It involved the obtaining of .tracings, S. Doc. 68--10

on a uniform scale, of two complete sets of shore line, one from the original survey of 1845 to 1850, and the other from the surveys of 1897 to 1899, as well as two corresponding sets of selected hydrographic cross sections. On March 10, when this worlr. was discontinued, all the necessary tracings of the shore line, together with the necessary data for constructing the hydrographic cross sections, had been collected. Three sets of blueprint copies of the shore-line tracings were obtained. Two of these were sent to the Maryland geological survey, and one to the Office at Washington, at the request of the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography. From the beginning of the year until the 12th of March, when Assistant Yates was relieved of the command of the Endeavor, the office work was prosecuted with vigor, and was only completed with hard work and long hours. During this period the branch office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was established in the custom-house at Baltimore. On the l ~th of March all office work relating to the vessel was up to date, and all records, sheets, etc., relating to the field work had been sent to the Office.

From January 2 to May 21, 1900, Assistant Baylor was engaged at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office upon his report of the magnetic survey of North Carolina. He also made, during this time, magnetic computations, and determined the constants of various magnetic instruments. On May 4 Assistant Baylor received instructions to resume field work, and from May 2 I until the end of the fiscal year he was engaged in laying out meridian lines in the State of Maryland. During this time the following county seats were occupied: Snow Hill, Princess Anne, Denton, Elkton, Ellicott City, 'Westminster, Annapolis, Prince Fredericktown, Leonardtown, Upper Marlboro, and Rockville. True north and south lines were determined from sun observations, and these lines were marked with granite posts. The magnetic declination was determined with a compass declinometer at each station. It should also be mentioned that Assistant Baylor made a series of magnetic. observations at Cape Charles City, Va., in connection with the total eclipse of May 28, 1900.

SUMMARY OF OPltRATIONS.

39 stations occupied.

In order to make absolute determinations of the three elements of the earth's magnetism in the Southeastern States, Mr. D. L. Hazard recei~ed instructions, on March 16, to prepare for field work. On March 20 he left Washington, and the next afternoon began work at Columbia, S. C. The observations were continued from this date until the 29th of June, when the instruments were turned over to Mr. J. W. Miller, Magnetic Observer, who had been with the party since the roth of June, and who was then capable of continuing the campaign alone. At each place at least one complete set of observations was made, and at those marked with an asterisk two sets were made. Special declination readings were taken every ten minutes from 7.30 a. m. to 5 p. m., on Thursdays, at Oglethorpe, Thomasville, Lake City, Fernandina, Palatka, Marianna, Decatur, and Knoxville. Special declination observations were made at Union Springs on the day of the solar eclipse. The following is a list of the stations occupied:

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.

6 square miles triangulation. 2 stations occupied. 2 geographic positions determined. 44 miles sounding lines. 3 o88 soundings. I 826 angles measured. 2 tide stations established. 1 hydrographic sheet.

At the beginning of the year Assistant H. L. Marindin was engaged on office work connected with the resurvey of Sa5safras River, Chesapeake Bay. He was so occupied until July I4, when there were transmitted to the Office one original hydrographic sheet, Turkey Point to Bush River, and twelve original sounding books for the above work. Ou this date instructions were issued for Assistant Marindin to report to the Secretary of War for duty in connection with the resurvey of the outer bar at Brunswick, Ga., as required by the river and harbor act of June 3, 1,.896. Supplemental instructions were issued for a conference in regard to the organization of party and the necessary requisition for instruments. These preliminaries being arranged, Assistant Marindin reported to the Secretary of War, through the Chief of Engineers, and received on August 12 instructions to make a survey of the outer bar at Brunswick, under the provisions of the act stated above, and as amended by the river and harbor act of March 3, 1899. The orders from the Secretary of War were received on the 15th of August, and on the I 7th Assistant Marindin started for Brunswick, having previously made arrange- · ments for the other members of his party to meet him there without delay. On the 29th the party was completely organized and ready to begin work. No steamer suitable for the work could be found at Brunswick, and it was therefore necessary to charter one from Jacksonville, Fla., from which all the soundings were made, and which was used to convey the party from St. Sinions Island to the scene of work on the outer bar. The field of operations lay at a distance of about 5 miles from land, so that it was necessary to have the steamer continually ready to sail at a moment's notice when the weather was favorable for doing the work. The exposed situation and the great accuracy required in this work made it impossible to work continually, as the least breeze from the southeast so disturbed the water that it was impossible to meet the requirements of the instructions. By the middle of October a sufficient number of

depths had been measured to indicate the width and depth of .the critical parts of the channel. A rough plat was made, which revealed a probable slight deficiency in the depth for a 25-foot channel over a length of about 800 feet. This was between Buoy No. 3 and Buoy No. 6.

TRIANGULATION AND HYDROGRAPHY, BRUNSWICK OUTER BAR. GEORGIA.

Before leaving New Orleans Assistant Marindin received word from Mr. Ford, temporarily in charge of the work at Brunswick, that the soundings had been completed, and instructions were therefore sent for the party to return to Washington, where they arrived on the 15th of November. Assistant Mariudin also arrived on the 15th, and immediately began the preparation of his report on the results of the Brunswick Outer Bar survey. Mr. Ford aided in this work, and the report, together with the finished chart, was completed on the 4th of December and transmitted the same day to the Secretary of War. The cost of this survey was paid by the War Department. Mr. Marindin was on leave of absence from the uth of December till the close of the calendar year, with the exception of the 1gth and 20th, when, in obedience to instructions from the Secretary of War, he prepared a supplemental report on the means employed by the contractor in deepening the channels over the outer bar at Brunswick, Ga.

SUM.MARV OF OPERATIONS.

365 kilometers leveling line. r21 bench marks established.

A party to be engaged in precise leveling was organized on the 1st of June, 1899, by Assistant 0. W. Ferguson. The work proposed was a line from Gibralter, Mich., to Cincinnati, Ohio. Field work began on the 3d of June and was completed oil the 28th of November. During this interval the line of precise levels was run between the aforesaid points and continued westward from Cincinnati as far as Lawrenceburg, Ind., 22 miles. This was done in order to make a strong connection with t.he transcontinental levels along the thirty-ninth parallel. Only one trustworthy bench mark could be found in Cincinnati, and it was necessary to proceed 22 miles westward before another one could be found. This work is described in Appendix No. 7 to the Report for 1899, and a sketch of the line is given. It is there published somewhat out of chronological order, since it was desirable to give the results of all the correlated leveling work in this portion of the country.

7 triangulation stations. 41 primary directions observed. 50 tertiary directions observed. 390 square miles triangulation. 18 geographic positions determined. 15 elevations 'determined trigonometrically.

The triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian, in Nebraska, was carried on by Assistant Granger, working north from the station Cameron, where he was on the 1st of July, 1899. A 12-inch theodolit~, No. 146, .was employed in the observation of horizontal directions. At station Cameron observations were made in 13 positions of the azimuth circle, two series, telescope direct and reverse, being taken in each position. At the following station, Pompey, and at all subsequent ones, the instrument was used in 24 positions, with one series in each position, telescope direct and reverse. At each station observations of double zenith distances and micrometric measurements . for differences of height were made. The original intention was to observe the line from Brayton to Elm. This required a signal of 50 feet height at the latter point, and one of 70 feet at the former. On closer inspectiOn of the ground, however, it was found to be impracticable, owing to the limited area of level ground in the vicinity of Elm, to construct a signal of the height required. The point Daily, therefore, was selected, and the quadrilateral Elm-Custer-Brayton-Yale modified by the introduction of an interior station. This obviated the necessity of high signals, and gives a figure equally strong. The observations being concluded at Brayton, an observing tripod arid scaffold were erected at Custer, the instruments and outfit placed in storage at Greeley Center, and the party disbanded. Assistant Granger then. proceeded to Washington and reported in person at the Office, where he was employed from November 11 to November 24. Assistant Granger had leave of absence from November 25 to the end of the calendar year.

485 square miles reconnaissance. 7 points selected. 645 square miles triangulation. 9 stations occupied. 23 geographic positions. 20 elevations determined.

Assistant Granger was on duty at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office from the beginning of the calendar year until April 9, on which date he proceeded to Greeley, Nebr. His instructions were to organize a party, continue the reconnaissance of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation northward until sufficient points had been obtained for a complete season's work of observation of angles, and then to return to Greeley and take up the triangulation proper. He was also directed to select a base line in the valley of the Elkhorn River, if suitable topographic features could be found there. Arriving at Greeley on the 18th of April, the party was organized, and on the 24th proceeded northward toward the Elkhorn River. As some of the points selected in the scheme of 1896 were uncertain as regards intervisibility, it was decided to make an investigation of this phase of the subject and, if necessary, make a rearrangement of the scheme of triangles: This reconnaissance was carried out and a scheme comprising the stations Walnut, Sparta, Council Hill, and Hall as the last quadrilateral, was adopted. Being unsuccessful in his attempt to find a suitable location for a base line at the point previously indicated, an .examination was made of the country in the neighborhood of Page station, and here, in a valley, was found a site, 8 kilometers in length, which answered every requirement. The station Page gave the southwest terminal of this base line, and only two stations, Prairie and Old, were required for the base net. Including the base 'line, the work laid out up to this point fixed 12 stations for the triangulation which could be occupied. It was therefore decided to return to Greeley and take up the measurement of angles.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.

384 kilometers leveling line. 64 bench marks established.

On June 30, 1899, Aid Benjamin E. Tilton was attached to the leveling party of Assistant A. L. Baldwin. Mr. Baldwin being instructed to report for duty at Washington, the charge of the operations was confided to Aid Tilton, who prosecuted the work continuously from the beginning of the fiscal year to October 17, when the party was disbanded at Norfolk, Nebr. The personnel consisted of a recorder, two rodmen, and two hands, which organization was permanent throughout the season. Actual field operations were possible on about twenty-one days per month, the principal causes of delay being bad weather. The line was carried 220 miles from Cortland, Nebr., northward to Norfolk, in the same State; and also a side line was run westward from Grand Island, Nebr., 20 miles, to the triangulation station Shelton. Three permanent bench marks were placed at or in the vicinity of'Norfolk. This, with a Geological Survey bench mark, about 2 miles south of Norfolk, constitute the: set of marks established at the end of the season. Aid Tilton was granted his annual leave on the close of field operations and reported at the Office, in Washington, on November 20. After this date, assisted by Aid W. H. Burger, he continued the revision of field computations relating to the season just closed. This work was completed on the 15th of January, 1900, and the results are printed in Appendix: No. 6 to the Report for the year 1899. A report was submitted on the 25th of January, after which date Aid Tilton began checking the field computations of the leveling work executed by Assistant Winston at different times between 1889 and 1894. This work was completed on the 23d of March, on which date he began work on the adjustment of the level net, and was so occupied until the 24th of April.

On April 4 instructions were issued to Aid Tilton to prepare for field work to complete the line of precise leveling started by him the previous season as far as Sioux City, Iowa. Leaving Washingto,n on April 25, after taking three days' leave of absence he proceeded to Norfolk, Nebr., arriving 011 the 1st of May. The party had the same organization as the previous year, namely, a recorder, two rodmen, and two hands. Field operations were begun 011 May 8, and the line was completed to Sioux City, a distance of 80 miles, by the 20th of June. Twelve permanent bench marks were left on this line. After finishing the work he proceeded with the party to Norfolk, Nebr., and at once started the line Norfolk to Page, Nebr., to connect the levels with the Page base line. The work. was completed to Hadir, Nebr., a distance of 7 miles, by the 30th of June.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.

3 stations occupied. 500 square miles triangulation.

On the 1st of July Assistant Eimbeck began the erection of signals at the stations Wilson and Heath, of the Transcontinental Triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel. The line joining these two stations was to serve as a basis from which the triangulation along the ·ninety-eighth meridian was to start. After having placed these stations in order a signa1 was erected at Bossing. From this point seven primary lines, including the reference mark, were observed. The preliminary preparations, the organization of the party, and the construction of the signals at the stations Sherman and Central occupied the time from July 19 to August 9. Observations began on the 10th, and work concluded on the 13th of September, during which time signals were erected at Little River and Chase, and a large number of observations on secondary points were made and zenith distances measured. On the 14th of September the party proceeded to Sherman, from which six primary and about twenty secondary lines were observed. The necessary preliminary work extended until September 20, and the actual observations began on the 21st, and continued tmtil the 13th of October. From this point the longest line of the season was observed, namely, from Sherman to Wilson, the length of the line being about 32 miles. The third station was Loder, from which three primary and about twenty-five secondary directions, as well as azimuth distances, were observed. From October 14 to October 19 preparations were made, and the required observations were obtained between the 20th and 30th October. The work for the season closed at Loder, and the instrumental outfit was sent to Salina and placed in storage on the 2d of November. In the observation of horizontal directions and vertical angles the theodolite and vertical circle were alternately used by mounting them upon the 4-foot iron stand surmounting the frame tripod at each triangulation station. The observations were executed in stri<;t conformity with the Superintendent's instructions; that is, a single series in each of twenty-four evenly spaced positions upon the limb of the theodolite. The zenith distances upon the primary triangulation points were measured, in general, on eight different days, in the afternoon or just before the horizontal direction observations V.·ere taken up. The ordinary frame tripod, such as was 'used at Bossing and Sherman, having proved unsatisfactory, in consequence

of the high winds, Assistant Eimbeck decided to build what he called a "' quadripod," ~nd \:his being employed at Loder proved to be a vast improvement on the previous construction. The twist in azimuth proved to be regular and very small, and the vibrations experienced from high wind were barely perceptible. The party was disbanded on the 11th of November. Assistant Little and Foreman Kenney left immediately for Washington, and Assistant Eimbeck, after having disposed of the party accounts and made arrangements for storage during the winter, reported to the Superintendent on the 23d of November. Twenty days' leave of absence was taken between this date and the close of the year, and the rest of the period until June 30, 1900 was devoted to office work in connection with the field operations. During this latter period the series of observations carried on at the Coast Survey Office, in Washington, for the purpose of determining the variation of the coefficient of refraction depending upon the season of the year were continued. The observations were made monthly, during the first twenty days, and consist of about twelve to thirteen days' differential micrometer measures upon four terrestrial objects in the southwestern horizon. During Assistant Eimbeck's absence in the field, July 1 to November 15, these observations were made by Mr. E. G. Fischer, Chief of the Instrument Division. ·

3 8oo square miles reconnaissance. 50 points selected. 6 base lines selected and located. 10 ·concrete piers constructed.

After connecting his reconnaissance alo~g the ninety-eighth meridian with the work of Assistant Eimbeck, Assistant Forney proceeded, on July 11, ~899, with his party, to Bowie, Tex., where he arrived on the 12th. After pitching camp, a reconnaissance was made for a base line at this place. One was located with its southeastern termin~s 6 miles west of the town of Bowie and its northwestern terminus 1 mile southeast from the town of Bellevue. Each end of the base was marked with a permanent concrete pier capped with a hard limestone block weighing 600 pounds. On the 25th of July the party left Bowie and traveled by wagon to Stephenville, Tex., arriving on the 30th. The base was located at this point, with its northern terminus on Bunker Hill, 5 miles east of the town of Stephenville, and its ends were marked in a manner similar to that employed at Bowie. On August 14 Assistant Forney left Stephenville and proceeded tb Lampasas, Tex., arriving on the 16th. A base was located with its northern terminus 2 miles east of the town, and the usual permanent concrete piers were constructed at the ends of the line. Leaving this point on August 28, the party arrived at New Braunfels, ·Tex., on the 2d of September. No suitable location could be found here for a base, and on the I 2th the party proceeded to Seguin, Tex., where an excellent site for a base was found in Guadaloupe Valley, 9 miles north of Seguin. The line was located and the usual concrete piers were constructed at the ends. On September 28 the reconnaissance was taken up from this point southward and carried through to the 'Rio Grande, develop~ ing a series of well-conditioned figures forming a chain of 18 unbroken quadrilaterals. The scheme extends 263 miles along the ninety-eighth meridian, with an average length of sides of 16 miles, covering an area of 3 419 square miles. A strong connection was made at the southern end with the line Sardines-Laguna Seca, two of the triangulation stations selected by Assistant Forney in 1894 while making the reconnaissance for triangulation along the Rio Grande. A base line was located 8 ~ miles west of north from Hidalgo. It was not practicable at the time to procure material for constructing permanent piers, and the ends were marked by a triangle cut on a mesquite tree. On November 29, after having completed the reconnaissance,

the party left Hidalgo for Alice, Tex., where they arrived on the 4th of December. A base line was selected here, about 7 miles south of the town, and marked with permanent piers of concrete. Instructions were issued on the 28th of November to Assistant Forney to ship by freight to Washington, D. C., all instruments and such camp equipage as would be useful for future work. Some condemned Coast and Geodetic Survey property was sold at public auction, and on December 20 Assistant Forney proceeded to San Antonio, at which point he wa? on leave of absence from December 31, 1899 to January 10 1900. He reported at Washington on January 14. From Anthony, Kans., to Hidalgo, Tex., covering a distance of 740 miles along the ninety-eighth meridian, eight base lines were laid out, with an average length of 7·5 km., the longest Jine being 12·8 and the shortest 6·okm. These lines are placed at intervals of 100 miles apart. Many of the points on these base lines are located near ' railroad stations, where connection can be made for telegraphic longitude.

longitude determined.

During the month of July, 1899, Assistant Sinclair was engaged in office work relating to his last season's operations. During August and September and until the 6th of October he was engaged on the topographic sheets illustrating the CaliforniaNevada oblique boundary from Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River. During this time preparations wtre made for the determination of the difference of longitude between Maricopa, Ariz., and El Paso, Tex. · On October 6 Assistant Sinclair proceeded to El Paso, Tex., in order to make' this determination, in cooperation with Assistant J. E. McGrath. Arriving at El Paso on the 12th of October, the observatory erected in 1893 was repaired, the pier was rebuilt, and the necessary preliminary arrangements made for the longitude determination. The ground on which the El Paso station was established in 1892 has since that date been transferred from the General Government to the city, and ~ill soon be converted into a public park. On accotint of the delay in preparing the station at Maricopa, no exchange of signals was effected before the 20th of October. Six determinations were made between the 20th and 26th, the observers exchanging positions when the work was half completed. During the latter part of Assistant Sinclair's stay at Maricopa an astronomic latitude was observed with telescope No. 6, by 50 observations on 18 pairs of st~rs, on· October 24, 25, and 26. All the work for which instructions had been issued having been completed on the 27th, the outfit was shipped to Washington and the observers returned, reporting on the 1st of November. The longitude work occupied Assistant Sinclair until the end of October. After completing the computations relating to the field work, the topographic sheets of the California-Nevada boundary survey were again taken up and work on them continued until the 29th 9f November. Leave of absence was then granted him until the close of the calendar year. In January, 1900, the positions ,of points on the corrected boundary line, 141 in number, were computed, and work was also continued on the topographic sheets. From this time until the end of the year Assistant Sinclair was engaged in preparing his report on the entire· operations connected with the oblique boundary, from its beginning, in 1893, until its close, in 1899. A map was also prepared, on a scale of 1-400 ooo, showing the Von Schmidt line of 1873, the Coast and Geodetic Survey random line of 1893-1899, the triangulation of the line from Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River, 400 miles, and other miscellaneous data. The report appears as Appendix No. 3 of this Report.

On the 20th of February he received instructions to proceed to Seattle to take command of the steamer Gedney and prepare her for work in the Aleutian Islands. Assistant Dickins was unavoidably detained in San Francisco until the 7th of March, when he proceeded north and arrived at Seattle on the 11th. On his arrival it was found that the Gedney had been inspected by the United States inspectors and reported as unseaworthy. Assistant Dickins was, therefore, ordered to continue the resurvey of Rich's Passage and Port Orchard, and this work was completed on the 22d of April. Office work was continued at Seattle after this date, and preparations were made to make an examination of the water front of Port Townsend. On May 26, just as the party was about to proceed to Port Townsend, telegraphic orders were received for the transfer of several members of the party to other duty. For the time being, therefore, it was impossible to proceed with the field work, and office work was resumed. On June 2, at the request of the cqntractors and builders of the torpedo boat Goldsboro, range signals were erected on the speed trial course. It was now determined to take up the work in Seattle, and preparations were made, but on the 21st telegraphic instructions were received which authorized the repairs of the Gedney at the naval station. Having communicated with the commandant, he requested that the vessel be brought over to the station, and on the 25th the work of stripping her was begun.

At the beginning of the year Assistant J. J. Gilbert was in charge of the suboffice at Seattle, Wash. In anticipation of instructions to make a resurvey of the city of Seattle, much of his time was devoted to the collection of data, not alone from the city engineer, Mr. R. H. Thompson, but also from Capt. W. R. Ballard, of the West Coast Improvement Company, and f. om Mr. A. H. Kiehl, United States Assistant Engineer, at the military station. Many of these plats were on different scales, which necessitated a general reduction to that chosen, namely, 400 feet to the inch. Compila~ions and reductions occupied Assistant Gilbert until August 9, when he received instructions to take up the work. Estimates were immediately submitted,· and on August 23, the approved estimates being received, the work was taken in liand. The necessary instruments were brought to Seattle from Lopez Island, the steamer Fuca was overhauled and brought to Seattle from Port Orchard, and the necessary projections were made. An automatic tide gauge was kept in operation at Seattle, Wash., under the direction of the Assistant in charge of the suboffice at that place. This suboffice served as headquarters for field officers, temporarily out of the field, and furnished accommodations for the completion of the field records. Various officers, temporarily on duty at the suboffice, acted as tidal observers, as the occasion demanded. A triangulation was executed, based on the line Alder to Freeport, and many objects along the shores of Seattle Bay and throughout the city were located, and the network was extended across Lake U:nion as far as the State University building. On September 25 the topography was commenced, and continued without interruption until the en.d of the. season. Some of the shore line of Lake Union and Lake Washington was obtained from the city plats, and is believed to be nearly correct. Several lines were run locating street corners, which facilitated the use of the city plats.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.

61 square miles topography. 3 miles coast line. 66 miles creek shore line. 301 miles roads. 3 topographic sheets.

At the close of the previous fiscal year Assistant Fremont Morse had just finished the triangulation to supply points for the topographic work around San Francisco. The work was laid out on three sheets, and it was taken up on the southern one on July l, 1899. This sheet extends from False Cattle Hill northward, nearly to the north end of Lake Merced, and from the ocean shore of the San Francisco Peninsula eastward for about 4 miles, including the town of Colma, the cemeteries lying at the west base of the San Bruno Mountains, and the outlying portions of San Francisco, and known as Ocean View, Lake View, and Ingleside. This· work engaged the attention of the party until the lOth day of October. On account of foggy and other unfavorable weather many delays occurred. During July only fifteen days were suitable for plane-table operations, while twenty days were secured in August, and only thirteen in September. On the uth of October the headquarters of the party were transferred from Colma to San Francisco; and the work on the two other sheets, already projected, was taken up. The lower one, which overlapped, to a certain extent, the Colma sheet, was finished on December 13, and on the same date the party began work on the upper sheet, and this was concluded on the 9th of January. The accompanying sketch shows the general location of the shore line and the position of the three topographic sheets completed between July l and January 9. At the close of the field operations preparations were made for taking up the work on the summit of Mount Tamalpais, in order to make a map of the region and the Scenic Railway, which now runs to the summit. The party moved to Mill Valley on January ro. On the 15th everything was in readiness, but unfavorable weather for two days prevented work. The survey was finished on the 26th and the topography connected with former work in this locality. In the meantime instmctions, dated January 15, had directed Assistant Morse to complete the San Leandro sheets, and accordingly the party was moved across San Francisco Bay and located at the town of San Leandro. The work continued with little interruption until April 24, when the season closed.

GILBERT, Assistant. F. W. EDMONDS, Assistant.

Assistant A. F. Rodgers has been in charge of the suboffice at San Francisco during the entire year. The duties devolving upon him are various, and require an intimate knowledge of the details of the work on the Pacific coast. Among the duties may be mentioned the filling of requisitions for instruments and equipments, and furnishing data to the officers of the Survey and to coordinate branches of the Government, officers of the Engineers, and to civilians. Information is collected in regard to localities and sailing routes in Alaskan waters. Data is prepared for publication in the daily newspapers of San Francisco relating to the sun, moon, and tidal phenomena for current dates. During the year Assistant Rodgers had charge of the building of a wharf and the construction and installment of a tide indicator on the southern extremity of Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Bay. On February 8 the adjustment of the index of the indicator, to show the surface plane of the water of the bay, was commenced. · The index was set by readings of the fixed staff at the Coast Survey tide station at the Presidio. Observations and slight _adjustments were continued for about one month, readings at tenminute intervals being made at the indicator by means of a telescope, from the summit of Telegraph Hill, and compared with simultaneous observations by the tide observer at the Presidio. This indicator is regarded as a substantial aid in navigating the waters of San Francisco Bay. It is also of use to the artillery officers using the range finders at the army posts. An automatic tide guage was kept in operation at the Presidio, San Francisco, Cal., throughout the year under the direction of Assistant Rodgers, with Mr. H. S. Ballard as tide observer. During the year the. following persons were temporarily employed in the office, under Assistant Rodgers's direction: Mr. C. W. Fitzgerald reported on July 18. He was detached by order from the Superintendent dateq November 3, and reported for duty ?n the steamer Patil.finder. Mr. P. M. Newhall reported under orders of November 14, and was on duty until January 3, 1900 Assistant F. W. Edmond:; reported on December 6. In April he was tenworarily detached, in order to collect data relating to the California-Nevada boundary, and on May 17 he reported to Assistant Fremont Morse. Mr. W. P. Taliaferro reported for duty as writer, and served until the end of the year.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.
12 triangulation stations occupied. 38 geographic positions determined. 65 square miles hydrography. 1 286 miles sounding lines. 22 028 angles measured. 56 929 soundings. I tide station.

On the rst of July, 1899, the steamer McArthur, with party on board, was lying alongside the dock at the Union Iron Works, San Fran<;isco. The repairs to the ship, begun some time previous under the direction of Assistant Dickins, had been suspended by telegraphic order from the Superintendent, but they were resumed on July 5 and continued until completion on July 20. Following this a trial was made and various anchorages in the harbor were examined under the immediate supervision of the Inspector of Hydrography and Top9graphy, who was on board. On July 26 the vessel was laid up in ordinary a_t Oakland Harbor, and the office work on the San Diego and San Pedro hydrographic sheets was continued. On August 15 the Superintendent of the Survey made an official visit and inspected the ship and crew. Between the 17th and 25th, under his personal direction, the. vessel visited Mare Island Navy-Yard and various portions of the bay on a tour of inspection. Returning to Oakland Harbor on the 25th., office work was continued until the last of September. Instructions wen! received by Assistant Westdahl on September 2 for the resumption of the hydrographic survey of San Francisco Bay and approaches as soon after October 1 as the office work then in hand would permit. Pending the arrival and installation of a new boiler for Launcli No. 28, Assistant Westdahl recommended that the bar work be taken up first, and to this end Assistant Morse was asked to cooperate to the extent of erecting two large signals at certain designated triangulation stations for use in the bar work. These signals were duly erected, but on October 2 telegraphic orders came to do the inside work first, and at the same time Assistant Perkins, in
175

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

command of the Pathfinder, was requested by the Superintendent to turn over temporarily to the McArtlzur one of his launches. The decision in regard to the inside work was most fortunate, since such thick weather prevailed during the months of August, September, and October that little could have been done outside. On October 9 the ship was moved to McNears Landing, where work was immediately begun on sheet No. 10, from Point Penole to Marin Islands, by the erection and determination of the necessary signals. Actual sounding began on October 23, and continued without interruption until December 22, when the sheet was completed, with the possible exception of some closer work in the examination for sunken rocks to the westward and southward of the Brother Islands. From October 24 to 28 and from November 6 to 11 two officers and five men from the Pathfinder were temporarily transferred to the McArthur for instruction in hydrographic work. This enabled Assistant W estdahi to use two parties. On December 22 the ship proceeded to Oakland, where the boiler was cleaned. On the 29th and 30th she proceeded to San Francisco to fill the bunkers with coal and returned to Oakland, where she remained until the 31st of December. On the 4th of January, the weather having moderated, the ship proceeded up the bay to begin work on the hydrography from Marin Islands to California City Point. The erection and determination of hydrographic signals was begun the same day. A tide gauge was set up at the Point San Quentin ,wharf, and the plane of reference established by night and day observation of high and low waters for several days. A comparison could thus be made with the self-registering gauge at the Presidio station. Afterwards tides were observed here only while soundings were being made. Actual work began on January 15 and was continued during every available period until the completion of the sheet on February 28. During January the work was much retarded by stormy weather and strong currents. Under date of February 1 Assistant Westdahl had been instructed to take up the resurvey of the bar upon the completion of the sheet then under way. On February 28, therefore, the ship was steamed to Oakland Harbor, to prepare for the bar survey. On the morning of March 15 a beginning was made on the bar survey. After locating signals and doing other preliminary work the actual sounding began on the 26th. Everything was in readiness, however, on the 20th, but on account of unfavorable weather nothing could be done until nearly a week later. In the meantime a staff was replaced at the old tidal station at Sausalito, and observations of high and low waters were made upon it for one week for comparison with the Presidio station. A great deal of fog and hazy weather and periods of rough water retarded the operations of the party. On two .occasions when ·it was impossible to work the boiler was cleaned and the coal bunkers refilled. At the close of the year the resurvey of the bar was practically completed.

TRIA:SGUI,ATION.

7 424 square miles area covered. . 6 stations occupied. 36 geographic positions determined. 8 old stations.recovered. 24 elevations determined (trigonometric). 1 elevation detefmined (spirit leveling).

At the beginning of the fiscal year Assistant Mosman was moving camp from San Juan to Cuyamaca. The journey was made by rail to Lakeside, and from the latter point by wagons to the camp near the triangulation station. From Lakeside to Cuyamaca the distance is about 40 miles, with a rise of about 6 ooo feet. At the time this transportation was effected it was exceedingly difficult to procure wagons, as all teams were taken by supply parties for the Cuyamaca mine. On July 15 camp was ready, and the work of preparing the station site was begun. From the camp to the triangulation point, a distance of about half a mile, there is a rise of about 345 feet, making the transportation difficult and slow. Everything, including instruments, lumber, sand, and water, had to be carried by hand. Before the theodolite could be mounted much work was done in preparing the site, as more than 20 tons of rock were to be handled before the situation could be made fit for the observations. The theodolite and vertical circle were ready for observing on July 22, and the signals and heliotropes were ready on the 25th. The first observations were obtained on the 28th. The usual foggy weather along this portion of the coast very much delayed the observations. Few observations could be obtained in the morning on either Soledad or Niguel, and for days at a .time no heliotropes could be seen at these stations, either in the morning or afternoon. Notwithstanding these adverse circumstances, all the primary directions were finished by August 14, and those on Old Light-House and Monument No. 258 on August 19. Tecato was occupied on the 26th and San Miguel on September 2. The instruments were dismounted and all the outfit wa.S at tht7 foot of the mountain by the 6th. On the 7th transportation to the railroad at Lakeside was begun, and on the 10th all outfit was shipped to Los Angeles or San Francisco. On the 15th the mules; wagons, and harness were sold at San Diego, and the party discharged except the recorder and one man, who were kept at Los Angeles a few days to make inventories and ship instruments.

SUBPARTY.

Assistant W. B. Fairfield reported to Assistant Mosman on June 27 at San Juan, and left Los Angeles for San Jacinto on July 5, accompanied by Prof. J. C. L. Fish as recorder and Peter A. Thomasen as packer. On the 8th he hauled the outfit to Strawberry Valley, at the foot of Sat'l Jacinto Mountain. Owing to the rough trail and lon~ distance to the top of the mountain, the last pack did not arrive until July 20. The first observations were obtained on the 24th, and they were finished on the 28th. On August 1 moving began, and the last pack went down the mountain on the 8th. On the 9th the outfit was hauled to San Jacinto, and the following day it was shipped by rail to El Toro. On the 15th hauling began from El Toro to the lower end of the trail on Santiago Mountain, and on October 22 the last of the outfit was brought up to the camp. Six days later observations were begun at Santiago triangulation station, and they were finished on September 2. Between the 5th and 7th the outfit was taken down the mountain, and it was shipped by rail on the 9th from El Toro. A part of it went to Los Angeles to be forwarded to Washington, and a part was shipped direct to San Francisco. Assistant Mosman arrived in Los Angeles on the 16th of September, and was occupied in settling accounts and shipping instruments until the 20th. Assistant Fairfield left for Washington, and Recorder Lewis for Madison, Wis. On the same date, September 20, Assistant Mosman left for San Francisco. After attending to minor matters of a routine nature, he left on the 24th for the East, stopping at Ord, Nebr., from the 3d to the 9th of October in order to visit the party of Assistant Granger, under official orders from the Superintendent. He arrived at Schenectady, N. Y., on October 11. From the 12th to November 2 he was on leave of absence, and on the latter date reported for duty in Washington. The abstracts and computations pertaining to the work were turned in on January 20. All original and duplicate records had been previously sent to the office. Assistant Mosman speaks in high terms of the services rendered by Assistant W. B. Fairfield, who was attached to the party from June 27 to the end of the season. Prof. J. C. L. Fish and Mr. Arthur W. Lewis are also highly commended by Assistant Mosman for the energy displayed and the interest taken in the work. Assistant Mosman was employed at the office until January 25, engaged in computations pertaining to his field work during the past season; At this date instructions were given him to report to the Assistant in charge of the Office for duty in the Computing Division, which duty he performed until the 31st of May. From June 1 until the 25th he was on leave of absence, and from the latter date until the close of the fiscal year preparations were made to take the field in Kansas, on the triangulation of the ninety-eighth meridian south of the thirty-ninth parallel.

J. E. McGRATH: ARIZONA, Maricopa.
ASTRONO!IUC.

Assistant J. E. McGrath was occupied at the beginning of the fiscal year in the Computing Division of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, making computations relative to the California-Nevada boundary line. This work continued until the 10th of August. For one month following thi's last date he was engaged in determining longitude in cooperation with Assistant Smith of the international geodetic latitude station at Gaithersburg, and making the office computations for the same. He afterwards resumed work on the computation of the California-Nevada boundary work. On September 18, 1899, Assistant McGrath received instructions to take charge of a cooperating party for the determination of longitude at Maricopa, Ariz., the other party being under the direction of Assistant C. H. Sinclair. The programme contemplated the exchange of signals on three nights between Maricopa and El Paso, Tex., . followed by three more nights after the observers had exchanged places. After numerous preliminary arrangements the parties left for the field on October 6. The town of Maricopa being devoid of all resources, as far as labor and building are concerned, it was necessary to procure assistance from Phoenix, a town near by. It was not until October 19 that everything was in readiness for the proposed observations. On this night the transit instrument was placed in the meridian and secured. On the following evening regular observations for longitude began, and these were continued each evening, without interruption, until October 23. The observers now exchanged places, Assistant McGrath going to El Paso and ~nt Sinclair coming to Maricopa. The travel was performed on the 24th, and on the evening...Qf the same day signals were again exchanged, and the same programme was repeated for Ul,ree successive nights. The observations on the 26th closed the work for the entire deteonination, and on. the following day the instruments were dismounted and shipped to ~ngton. The observatory was turned over to the city commissioner of streets, who has chatr&e of the property on which the building stands. Assistant McGrath, after taking five d!lp' leave of absence, arrived in Washington on the 6th of November, and on the following day reported at the office for duty. From November' 8 to 27 he wa8 employed at the office, first on the computation of the longitude at Maricopa, and afterwards resuming work on the California-Nevada boundary computations. · On November 28 he was assigned to duty in the party of Assistant Nelson, instructed to take up geodetic operations in Porto Rico.

PRECISE LEVELING.

KELLEY,

Recorder.
SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.

340 kilometers leveling line. 41 bench marks established.

The line of precise levels has been continued from Denver during the past year by the party under Assistant Isaac Winston. Taking the field early in May, at the beginning of the year the party was working northward from Denver. The greater portion of this region is irrigated, and the atmosphere was extremely tremulous, which to a considerable extent retarded the work. Another unfortunate circumstance was the strength of the wind, which blew with great force most of the time and made it necessary to use guys on the rods during a considerable portion of the season. The work, however, was considerably facilitated by the use of the observing tent, which was constantly used. By permission of the officers of the Union Pacific Railway, velocipede cars were used as a means of transportation, and resulted in a great saving of time and otherwise facilitated the work. The changes in elevation along the line were very great, and at many points this was so marked that long sights were impossible, even when other conditions were favorable. From Denver to Greeley, 50 iniles, the elevation decreases 162 meters, and then increases 336 meters in the following 50 miles. From Cheyenne to Sherman, the highest point of the transcontinental route, the elevation increases 677 meters in about 30 miles. The descent west of Sherman is equally steep over a considerable portion of the route, as far as Laramie. The work during this season was carried on with modified instruments and methods. The conclusions arrived at by a committee on precise leveling, appointed by the Superintendent to consider the instruments and methods in use, were put in practice, and the result was that the work in the field was much less laborious and the results seemed to be equally accurate. Assistant Winston speaks in high terms of the contrivance devised hy Mr. E. G. Fischer, chief mechanician, Coast and Geodetic Survey, for reading the level from the eye end of the telescope. This is a modification of the device used in France, but is simpler and superior in the result. Assistant Winston was assigned to office work on the 31st of October. He took up the computations of the field notes of the work just executed, and prepared them for publication. This lasted until the ·29th of January, when he reported for duty in the Computing Division, and was engaged there until the 9th of May. On this date he was detached and was assigned to the plattibg of. the field notes made by the party of Assistant 0. B. French along the coast of New Jersey for the revision of charts. He was engaged on this work until the close of the year.

On July 1 Assistant Pratt, commanding the steamer Patterson, was at Seattle, Wash., making preparations to resume work in Alaska. On the 3d of July, at 2.30 p. m., the vessel sailed for Dutch Harbor, stopping on the way at Port Townsend long enough to put accounts and mail matter ·in the postoffice. Dutch Harbor was reached on the 13th of July, after a passage of 9j1 days, and a distance covered of 1 668 miles. When off the Sannak Bank and Islands it was evident from good determinations that there was a very strong set or current to the northeastward. From tentative

on the flats at the entrance of the Apoon mouth of the Yukon. He immediately dispatched Assistant Young and Recorder Newhall, with the steam launch and material, to establish buoys and beacons in the channels. On account of the importance of Cape Nome as a landmark an attempt was made to locate it astronomically, but during the three days-July 25, 26, and 27-devoted to the work there, no stellar observations could be obtained on account of clouds. The latitude and longitude were, however, obtained by solar observations with the sextant. The entire · 111 on th of August was devoted to soundbJ'own, ing, outside the 3-fathom I ' curve, the great Yukon Flats ,, ', ' /1 between Stuart Island and I I Cape Dyer. This is shown I Divide t on the accompanying sketch. !.'./Jase I Practically all this work is out of sight of land. About 30 beacons aud buoys, in about 18 feet of water, were erected bet ween Stuart Island and Cape Dyer, many of them being 20 or' more miles from land. The beacons were 30 feet high above water. About 2 980 miles soundings were nm on this piece o( work. A topographic survey of the outer face of Cape Dyer promontory was made, and sufficient boat work done to develop the approach to Cape Dyer and the entrance to Scammon Bay. The soundings show that there are no lumps, as heretofore supposed, off the mouth of the Yukon, TRIANGULATION OF GOLOFNIN BAY..ALASKA and that the southern portion of this great shoal does not extend t>ffshore quite as far as supposed. The currents in the vicinity of the end of this shoal are quite strong, as much as 2 knots per hour, and their strength and direction depend on the force and direction of the wind and condition of the tide·, although it was quite appar~nt that the flow was in a northeasterly direction the greater portion of the time. Surveying these unknown shoals, with their uncertain and treacherous currents, with a vessel of the size of the Patterson wa& a very risky and exceedingly try. ing undertaking, but the work went on continuously, day and night, unless interrupted by heavy weather.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY, REPORT, 1900.

In going to and from St. Michael lines of sounding were run, so that the southern half of Norton Sound was covered with hydrographic work. The entrance to Port Safety (see sketch) was next surveyed. This is a small bay or lagoon about 7 }6 miles east of Cape Nome, and has only recently been known to civilization. This will be an important place in the future, as excellent prospects have been obtained back of it. There is about 6 feet of water on the bar at extreme low tide, with a rise of about 4 feet. Before leaving this place range beacons were erected for crossing the bar and notices to mariners writte11 and posted at St. Michael. The last locality surveyed was Golofnin Bay. A base line of about 1 73 miles was measured on its northwestern shore, from .which a comprehensive triangulation was expanded abundantly covering the entire onter bay. (See sketch.) An astronomic position was determined at a station on the island on the east side of the bay. Owing to continual cloudiness at night, the position had to be obtained by solar observations with the vertical circle. A magnetic station was occupied on this island for declination and dip. The shore line was run with the plane table, but the adjacent topography will have to be filled in by photo-topographic means, the triangulation stations and some subsidiary ones having been occupied with the topographic camera. The hydrography covers the entire bay and also the narrows between the two spits at the head of it. The anchorage is quite near to the southern and western spit. On September 23 enough work had been accomplished for a preliminary chart of the lower and deep-water portion, and the work was closed for the season. On the 24th the Patterson, with party, returned to St. Michael, and after waiting seven days for necessary arrangements incident to closing the work in Bering Sea, she sailed on October 3 for Dutch Harbor, taking the steamer- Taku in tow, under steam. Arriving at the latter place on the morning of October 8, the Taku was moored in the small basin and the Patterson continued her voyage on the IIth for Seattle, where she arrived on the 20th of October at 9 p. m. The cruise since leaving Sau Francisco was about 8 830 miles. Assistant Pratt remained in command of the Patterson during the remainder of the year, and in addition to his duties as commander was assigned the charge of tlie suboffice at Seattle. In February he established -and marked a trial course near Seattle 1 nautical mile long, to comply with a request from the Navy Department. During the remainder of the year office work connected with the past season's field work was done, repairs were made to the ship, a crew was enlisted, and all preparations made for another season's work in Alaska. In spite of many unfavorable circumstances, all preparations for the voyage north were completed by June 18, and on the 19th the vessel sailed for Nome City, Alaska. At the close of the year the voyage had not been concluded. ·

During the month of April, I899, while engaged in other duty at Washington, D. C., Assistant G. R. Putnam received instructions to prepare for field work in Alaska. The operations contemplated a survey in the neighborhood of the Yukon Delta and in Scammon Bay, some distance to the south. The party, all under the direction of Assistant Putnam, was divided into three parts, of which the first was
185

under Assistant Putnam's direct supervision, and carried on the work from the steamer Yukon . . This party consisted of E. R. Frisby, Aid; P. S. Rose, foreman; R. McD. Moser, recorder; W. C. Page, recorder; 2 engineers, 1 cook, 1 Eskimo pilot, and 5 sailors and hands, making in all 14 persons. The second detachment was under the immediate direction of Assistant G. L. Flower, accompanied by R. J. Mansfield, aid; J. H. McEld~wney, recorder; 1 engineer, 1 cockswain, l cook, and 1 hand, making a total of 7 persons. This party operated from the launch Alpha. The third was a traverse party under charge of Dr. H. M. W. Edmonds, with 1 rodman, l cook, and l hand-4 persons in all. The entire expedition as thus constituted was composed of 25 persons. They sailed from Seattle on the steamer Roanoke on the 10th of June, 1899, passed through Akutan Pass on June 18, and arrived at St. Michael Bay on the 24th. The following two weeks were spent in preparing the steamers, launches, and boats for the work of the season, and the party was able to take the field actively on the 9th of July. The plan of oper~tions was for the Yukon to proceed first to Scammon Bay and make an examination, topographically and hyclrographically, of this locality. While this work was in progress Mr. Flower established himself at the Kwiklowak mouth of the Yukon, and began the development of that region. When the Scammon Bay work was completed, Assistant Putnam returned to St. Michael for supplies, and went immediately thereafter to the Kwiklowak bar and began hydrographic observations on August 5. On the 9th the launch party· of Assistant Flower began work up the Kwiklowak. In the meantime Dr. Edmonds began his traverse line along the Delta coast, northward from the Kwiklowak, of which detailed information will be given later. During the latter part of August and the first part of September the combined parties made a survey of the Kwiklowak Pass and proceeded up the river as far as the vicinity of Andreafski. The work was closed on September 13, and from this time to October 3 the party was at St. Michael, disposing of the vessels and putting them in shape for the winter. During this time office work was continued as opportunity offered, and the Patterson with the party on board sailed on the 3d for Seattle. Arriving there on the 21st of October, the men were discharged and the regular members of the field force were engaged on office work and inventories until the 28th. Assistant Putnam and the other officers reported at Washington early in November, and were engaged during the greater part of the winter on the preparation of the field notes made during the season. It would he impracticable to give a detailed account of all the operations carried out by a party doing as extensive work in hydrography, topography, and triangulation as was ac~omplished by the force under As,sistant Putnam's direction. during the season. But an outline of the work in the different localities can be sketched sufficiently in detail to convey an idea of the results accomplished.
SURVEY AND .RECONNAISANCE OF SCAMMON BAY.

In all, fourteen days were devoted to this part of the work, and during this time two southeasterly gales with rain and mist, each lasting several days, were experienced, so that the hydrographic work could only be carried on during six days. As the work in this locality was detached from that in the Yukon Delta, it was necessary to make astronomic determinations of latitude, longitude, and azimuth. Ten chronometers and

a meridian telescope were carried for this purpose, but although the latter was set up at three of the temporary headquarters occupied, unfavorable weather prevented any star observations. The determinations, therefore, depend on observations of the sun, nearly all with the 7-inch theodolite, ancl the clednced positions and azimuth were adjusted

from these data. 'rhe longitude was determined from St. Michael, with time observations made before and after the voyage. , By observing the Kusilvak Mountains and Mount Seward, from the triangulation points near the Yukon mouth, it was po:sible to compare the results of the systems of

the flats south of the Khuu River, near its mouth, and a rough triangulation was made along the south side of Scammon Bay to Cape Romanzof. A traverse line was also run along the south shore of the bay from Khuu River to the cape, and to a point about 2 miles south of it; also for about 14 miles along the coast toward the Yukon Delta. Many shoals in the bay were located from elevated stations, whose heights above sea level had been carefully determined. The distances were computed from the measured angle of depression, using the height as a base. The hydrographic work was somewhat hampered by bad weather, but the examination showed that the greater part of Scammon Bay is foo shoal to be of much practical value to navigation. Deep water was found immediately south and east of the South Sand Island, but the limited area of this, and the shoals on each side of the channel leading to it, render it probably of little value. There is a narrow channel into the bay and into Khuu River, a deep but narrow tidal stream. Tides were observed at the mouth of the Khuu River during the progress of the bydrographic work, as were also a few current observations. There is a double daily tide here, as at the Kwiklowak. Magnetic observations were made .at this point, and numerous photographs were taken with topographic and view cameras.
THE CHANNEI.S AT THE KWIKLOWAK MOUTH.

One of the most important parts of the season's work of this party was the development of the Kwiklowak mouth of the Yukon River. The operations brought out the fact that the pass divides at its mol,lth into five channels, fl.owing out in directions varying from southwest to north. Beginning at the south, these are Acharon, the Taku, the Kutmuknuk, the Kwiklowak, and the Nurukomarot. All of these were carefully examined. The important results of this examination affecting navigation are published in Coast and Geodetic Survey Bulletin No. 40, second edition, 1900. A self-registering tide gauge was kept in operation at Avogon from July 14 to August 11. This was connected by. water l~vels with the gauge of the previous season, at Kwiklokchun. Tidal observations for the south-channel work were made at Waklarok, and limited observations were also made at three outside points to obtain the relation between the time and range of tides on the bar and at the mouth. Current observations were made in the bar channels.
i'\OUNDINGS ALONG THE COAST.

The importance of soundings along the coast was fully recognized by Assistant Putnam, and although this work was not included in the original instructions, he availed himself of several trips made between Scammon Bay and St. Michael, as well as from the Kwiklowak mouth to Scammon Bay, in order to obtain information on this point. The results of this work are shown on a hydrographic sheet, but they should be considered rather in the nature of _a reconnaissance than as precise information. During this voyage of 200 miles, although keeping close in, with the steamer drawing less than 5 feet of water, the shore of the delta coast was never sighted. Specimens of sea water were taken and their densities determined.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, r900.
KWIKLQWA}{ PASS OF THE YUKON RIVER.

In accordance with the original plan, the latter part of the season was reserved for inside work up the Kwiklowak No. 24. Pass and the Yukon River. Astronomic observations for latitude and time were made with the meridian telescope at Kwiklokchun and Avogon, near the mouth , and at Anuk, about 50 miles up the river. The longi tude of Kwiklokchun was determined as a result of two voyages from St. Michael, with 9 and 7 chronometers respectively, in combination with the result obtained i'n a similar manner during the previous year; and that of Anuk, results from one voyage, '>vith 7 chronometers. The triangulation was carried a distance of 87 miles up the Kwiklowak Pass and Yukon River, to within a short distance of the mouth of the Andreafski River. Placing a hydrographic s ignal off the Yukon Delta. Au effort was made to proceed by quadrilaterals or by independent overlapping triangles where practicable, but very little time was spent in cutting lines and norie in preliminary reconnaissance. There were 104 triangulation stations established and 5 old ones reoccupied. The topographic survey up the pass and riv.er was made with sextant, theodolite, and sketchbook. The photographic camera was used, and numerous general views were obtained throughout the delta. The hydrography was developed by a system of lines run with the steam launch. A good channel was found from the Kwiklowak mouth to near Andreafski.

To obtain an approximation of the discharge of the Yukon, a cross-section and current observations were obtained opposite Azacharak hill, 73 miles from the mouth, where the river is well confined between banks and carries practically all the water.
RECONNAISSANCE OF THE SHORE LINE AT THE MqUTH OF THE YUKON RIVER .

.In the course of the work it was found desirable to make a reconnaissance of the shore line in front of the delta, extending from the Kwiklowak entrance on the south to the Apoon on the north. This was undertaken by Dr. Edmonds. He was accompanied by a cook, I rodman, and I canoeman. The bed of the ocean off the delta is so little inclined that each succeeding tide floods an area of many hundreds of square miles. 'With the ebb, this vast expanse is completely drained; it then presents to the eye an unbroken surface of mud, and offers the traveler a most uninviting and difficult footway. Starting from the lower, or Kwiklowak entrance, at a well.:established triangulation station, the party proceeded north, measuring the distance by stadia. At the close of the work, six weeks later, after surveying 80 miles of shore line, connection was also made with a point in the main triangulation which extends from St. Michael southward, so that the traverse line is suitably controlled by work depending on astronomic observations. \ Assistant P~tnam states tha~ this coast had probably never been seen before by a white man. l:ie calls attention to the fact that the shore line, previous to Dr. Edmonds's work, was erroneously placed on cur best charts at least IO miles to the eastward. The many difficulties overcome, discomforts experienced, and valuable geographic knowledge acquired can not be adequately described in a short narrativl'!. The task, to use Assistant Putnam's words, required the greatest endurance, perseverance, and courage, and credit i~ also due to the men who accompanied Dr. Edmonds. The following information is extracted from the report cited, which is too extensive for full publication. Only the lightest draft boats could be used, a small dingey and a canoe being the only ones taken. The tents were light, though large enough to permit the use of temporary bunks, thus placing the inmates out of reach of the floods. In order to control the azimuths, large signals were established some distance inland, and these were continually observed as long as they were visible. Triangulation was frequently resorted to, in order to cross the small outlets flowing into the. sea. In general, it may be stated that there is a distinct grass line separating the sea from· the land. In some places banks from x to 3 feet high form the dividing line. Canoes can not come close inshore exc~pt at high tide, and even the streams can not be entered except under these conditions. When landing at any other time it is necessary to walk for a quarter of a mile or more over the mud, whi~.li is gen,erally so sticky that even hip ·boots, attached with a belt, are drawn from the body. In such cases it is necessary to work barefooted. Every hundred yards or so a slough or stream enters the sea. It was necessary to wade around each of these, requiring a long detour into the ocean before the channel shoaled enough to permit.wading. The readings of the instru.ment were necessarily made quickly, on account of the unstable condition of the foundation. Favorable stations had to be selected, and spots were occasionally occupied where it took many minutes for the observers to release each

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

As this occurred

Both the barometer and tide tables were called into requisition, and work was planned to meet the probable conditions. Fog or darkness sometimes separated the

parties, or floods came and swamped the outfit. It was necessary 011 this account to place everything on staging. At the end of the day's work the party wa. often completely wet through, and as there wa: usually little chance to dry clothing it was wrung out and allowed to dry on the body during the night. Until this year there h as been practically no information concerning the character of the coast of the Yukon Delta, and the means of travel along it, either by land or sea. Travelers have lost their way going from the river to St. Michael, and have drifted into the marshy wastes of the delta. The entire country is lonely in the extreme. During the day the muddy :flats No. 30. extend far out from land, and the woeful cry of the loons and exasperating, noisy calls of the geese disturb the peace at night. The native travels, preferably, by the river highway , as he there has the advantage of deep water and plenty of driftwood for cai.nping purposes, and he may also take advantage of the incoming tides and currents of rivers. In crossing the face of the delta he awaits the proper tide and favorable breezes for his sailboat, and calm water for the kyak. The "oomiaks, '' or larger family boats, keep out at sea until opposite the point of destination. The kyak, or single canoe, keeps closer inshore, and takes advantage of the inland passages.
One mile al sea off the Yukou Delta coast.

It has beeu previ-

ously supposed that there was a system of islands and sloughs with deeper water, by which it was possible to go along the delta face and not be dependent on the tides. There are, however, but three islands or groups of islands, and the only slough systems that can be taken advantage f are the mouths of the main riv rs. The Yukon Delth coast may be divided into three distinct portions, each having its own characteristic:. The first extends from the southern pass a distan e of 35 miles to the Kwikpak. The shore line is a low bank from 2 to 3 feet high, with firm hard mud and sand extending I or 2 mile seaward. The middle portion, or swampy lands, S. Doc. 68--13

194

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

extends 25 miles from the Kwikpak to the Okshokwhewhik. The remaining portion, from the last-named point to the Apoon, is characterized by jutting points of land, occasional bushes, and patches of deep moss. At high water one can generally keep within a quarter of a mile from shore in light-draft boats, such as Peterboro canoes, and may even at places skirt along the banks. At low water one must here, as elsewhere, keep so far out to sea that even with field glasses only the very largest rivers can be located. Loaded boats can at no time approach sufficiently near at this point to readily distinguish the land. The largest streams can be entered at any time in light-draft boats. This statement applies particularly to the Kawockawik, 5 miles north of the Avogon or Lower Yukon entrance; the Pagomawik, 17 miles from the Avogon, and the Kwikpak system, 25 miles from the same point. The first 18 miles of coast from the Kwiklowak entrance are marshy. After this the banks become better and wood appears. Land may be approached more easily here, and favorable spots for camping are found. Between the Avogon and the Kwikpak mouths the distance is about 28 miles. Natives travel this distance in kyaks in one day, taking advantage of inland passages near the mouth of the Kweguk. The Kweguk and Pagomawik rivers are used by natives to go into the interior, even to the head of the delta, and are navigable by large boats, except at the entrance. The first 5 or 6 miles on either side of the Kwikpak are characterized by good banks. Light-draft boats can keep well inshore. The better streams are all marked by stacks of wood at varying distances from the coast line. From here to the lower mouth of the delta is one day's journey in a kyak. To the Apoon it is a two days' trip. To St. Michael requires two days in a good sailboat, with favorable winds. No dwellings whatever are to be found. For five weeks no human being was seen, but the country is a paradise for waterfowl and mosquitoes. One almost stumbles over tl:ie geese, and on the rivers they scarcely get out of the way of the boat. The only prominent features of the whole district are the high conical wood stacks that mark the rivers. These stacks may be observed even when out of sight of land, and are situated a mile or two inland, at the first camping spot. It is not safe to camp lower down the river than at the first wood stack, and even there it is safer to sleep on staging, as after southerly winds the sea comes inland a full mile or more. At low tide, standing at the grass edge, the sea is often invisible. Sea gulls may be seen wading around in an inch or so of water, a mile from shore. The mud is of that peculiar nature which made it necessary during lunch time to march around in circles to prevent sinking, never remaining more than a few moments in one spot. From the Kwikpak to the good land near Okshokwhewhik but few rivers afford stopping places. Three miles from the Kwikpak there is a branch of the same. At 14 miles the Malitqweengak, ·at 18 miles the Elongozhewik, and at 22 miles the Oowik. These streams are marked by the aforesaid wood stacks, the Elongozhewik having two. From the time of leaving the Pagomawik, where the last view of the Kusilvak Mountain is obtained, no elevations are visible until, near the Elongozhewjk, a distant view of the mountains back of ''Hogback,'' and later on those beliind Point Romanzof, is obtained. The last stretch of coast of about 25 miles is the most pleasant. The Apoon approaches the coast somewhat, and many rivers connect with the sea. These

are well-defined, have raised banks, and are heavily lined with willows to within a short distance of the shore. From October 3, on which date the parties were at St. Michael, to November 5, when Assistant Putnam arrived in Washington, the time was employed in settling up the affairs of the party at Seattle and in making the trip. Assistant Putnam was engaged at Washington until May 3, when he was detailed to duty with the Smithsonian Institution expedition to observe the total eclipse of the sun. This duty is reported under the heading Special Duty.

On the 1st of July Assistant R. L. Faris was at St. Michael, Alaska, with a party of 26 officers and men. The work projected for the season was the topographic survey of St. Michael and Stuart Island, with the hydrography in the neighborhood, and the .complete development, topographically and hydrographically, of the Kwikpak and Kawanak passes leading to the mouth of the Yukon Delta. The steamer Taku and the steam launch Delta were put at the disposition of the party, and on July 10 active work began.

Flynn, with the steam launch Delta, taking charge of the triangulation, topography, and hydrography of the Kawanak and Kwipak passes of the Yukon Delta. The second subdivision was in charge of Mr. D. W. Eaton, topographer, and was engaged in planetable work during the entire season, first on St. Michael and Stuart islands, and on the shore north of St. Michael, and later south of the latter point and in the passes before mentioned. The third division, with the steamer Taku, was in charge of the chief of the party, and began the execution, in July, of the triangulation and hydrography of St. Michael and Stuart islands. · In August and September this party was moved to the passes and combined with that of Assistant Flynn, and all worked on triangulation, topography,

and hydrography of the passes, and developed the hydrography of the Kawanak for a distance of about 20 miles above the mouth to a point beyond the 3-fathom curve in the ocean. The topography executed by Mr. Eaton north of St. Michael included about 16 miles of shoreline, to which must be added·a part of the coast between Point Romanzof and Apoon Pass, which was done in the early part of the season. The total topographic work embraced 91 miles of coast line. The hydrography about Stuart and St. Michael islands, and that at the Yukon Delta, is embraced in 6 hydrographic sheets. Two magnetic stations were occupied during the season, at which the magnetic declination was observed.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

The party left the Yukon Delta on September 15 and returned to St. Micnad, where the vessel was laid up for the winter. A better understanding of the features brought out by the work in the Yukon Delta may be had by reference to the sketch. It will be seen that the Kawanak Pass begins near the head of the Apoon Pass and flows nearly parallel to the Kwikpak, emptying into Norton Sound about a mile below the mouth of the latter. The location of this channel was controlled by a system of triangulation extending 16 miles from the mouth of the pass, the last four stations of the scheme depending on sextant angles only for position. The results of Assistant Faris's work in this region, important to navigation, are published in Coast and Geodetic Survey Bulletin No. 40, second edition, 1900. The work in Alaska is so different from that executed in many parts of the United

States that a brief outline of the conditions controlling the operations may not be without value. In the first place, the work is far removed from a base of supplies . There is much unfavorable weather, and transportation is expensive. The geographic features of the delta of the Yukon are continually changing, so that the most economical procedure was to make a fairly accurate map, without devoting much time to unnecessary refinement. In conformity with these ideas it was decided to control the work by astronomic stations located conveniently to the main channels, to determine the longitudes by chronometer from St. Michael, and to observe the latitudes and azimuths. From the astronomic stations thus established a . triangulation was developed, from which, when necessary, simple traverse lines were run, in order to establish minor details. It was considered more important to avoid large errors than to seek ac<..:urate refinement, and

for this reason only such general checks as necessary were employed; that is to say, the measurement of all the angles of a triangle and the closing of the horizon, but no great effort was made to attain a high degree of precision, through the repetition of angular measurements. Base lines were measured wherever necessary, and this made great precision in the angular measurements a question of secondary importance. The triangulation of Stuart Island was completed about July 20, and covered au area of about 75 square miles. This work was performed, largely, by Mr. R. B. DerickNo. 33.

son, Aid. The field computations of this work were made, and the stations platted on the sheets for immediate use. It was necessary to occupy 72 stations in the triangulation of Kawanak Pass. This work was done by Assistant F lynn, and the signals were built by Aid G. S. Phelps. Time, latitude, and azimuth observations were made by Assistant Flynn, near the mouth of the pass, and a base line was measured there. On August 2 the party under the personal direction of Assistant Faris, on the steamer Taku, proceeded to the mouth of the Kawanak Pass and took up the execution of a scheme of triangulation from it. mouth running seaward to the 3-fathom curve. This work has already been described ,

and it is only necessary to add in this place that the scheme included 7 shore signals and 12 water signals, distributed along each side of the channel for a distance of r 6 nautical miles from the mouth of the pass, and out of sight of the cdast. Mention has already been made of the plan adopted in erecting water sig nals,* by means of gas pipe. The cost of these signals was about $3·50 apiece, including freight and all expenses from Seattle, which shows how much more economical it is to use signals of this kind than to depend upon the usual structures of wood. The water signals were, generally, located by angle measurements from shore stations, but the four outer ones depend upon sextant angles alone. On August 23 the subparty under Assistant Flynn conibined with the party ou the Taku , and the combined force was devoted to triangulatjon , topography, and

hydrography on the upper Kwikpak, the Apoon, and Okwega passes, reaching the mouth of the Apoon Pass on September 12. One hundred and sixty-seven triangulation stations were occupied in this scheme. The work begins at a measured base near the head of the Kwikpak and extends down that pass to another base at the head of the Apoon Pass, thence down the Apoon to .its mouth, joining \>.·ith the triangulation of 1898 from St. Michael. Another base was measured 6 miles above the mouth of the. pass, at Kotlick. The narrowness and crookedness of the Apoon Pass rendered it very unfavorable for good triangulation. One hundred and four stations were required to cover its length of 35 miles.

other work, however, 4 bases were measured, at au average distance of 21 statute miles apart. The ends of the bases were marked by driving a large stub firmly in the ground and measuring between then~ with a 50-meter standardized steel tape, which lay on the ground and was stretched at a tension of 15 kilograms. The tape lengths were marked by pins stuck in the side of driven stakes which were aligned by the eye. From the Kotlik base to the Apoon base there are 78 stations and a large number of the lines are only from 300 to 500 meters Jong.
TOPOGRAPHY.

62"60'

The nature of the work in this part of Alaska is uch that it is not always possible or desirable to use the plane table. Other methods were, therefore , employed, and the topography executed during tht:: season was done by sketching, employing sextant angles for location of position, and by running traverse lines with a steam launch, compass, and log. The work around St. Miehael and tuart islands was considered to be sufficiently important to employ the plane table, and this method was adopted in this part of the field. . On the lower end of the Kawanak and Kwikpak passes positions were located I y the use of a sextant, and in the passes themselves many lines were established by using a steam launch, compass, and log. When such traverse line: were run it was done so that the two ends of the traverse joined known positions, so that any errors could be readily adjusted. In some parts of the planetable work celluloid sheets were used and proved very serviceable, in view of the continual moisture incident to this locality. The work was afterwards transferred from the celluloid sheets to projections on paper and filed with the

original celluloid sheets in the Office archives. The great advantage . of the sextant method is that it can be used in almost any weather, and admits of great rapidity. The use of the plane table under many of the conditions that exist along the coast of the Yukon Delta would be entirely impracticable, if not impossible.
HYDROGRAPHY.

In the hydrographic work it was considered most important to develop the main features of the channels and to especially lo"cate minimum depths in critical places.

delta of the Yukon, the Apoon and Okwega having one tide and all the other passes two tides a day. Two magnetic stations, the one at Kotlik and the other at Okwega, were made, and declination was observed by means of a compass declinometer. The barometer and thermometers were read at the Yukon Delta and at St. Michael during July, August, and September, the result of which showed the mean temperature for August and September to be 8°'2 C. and a mean pressure for the three months of 39·6 inches. The monthly means were made up from readings every two hours during the twenty-four of each day during the month. On September rs the party returned to St. Michael for the purpose of putting the vessels on the ways and properly caring for the outfit during the winter. On October 3 the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Patterson, under command of Assistant Pratt, sailed from St. Michael, bound for Seattle, v.:ith the party on board except Messrs. Flynn, Derickson, and Edmonds, who boarded the ship at Dutch Harbor. The Taku was sent to Dutch Harbor, aud was manned by Messrs. Flynn, Derickson, and Dr. Edmonds, these gentlemen having volunteered to make the passage with her. The Patterson arrived at her destination on the 21st, and all temporary party employees were discharged and the party disbanded. In compliance with instructions from the Superintendent, Assistant Faris reported in person at Washington on the . 4th of November. On the 13th, after six days' leave of absence, the computations and office work of the season's operations in Alaska were taken up and completed by April 27, 1900. From this date to May 13 Assistant Faris was on leave. From the 14th to the 26th he was attached to the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, and on the latter date left Washington for Seattle to join the steamer Patterson, under the command of Assistant J. F. Pratt. He reported on the 1st of June, and was engaged in duty on that vessel until the close of the year. ·

TRIAN9ULATION.

Instructions were issued on April 29 to Assistant H. P. Ritter to organize a party for the prosecution of work at the mouth of the Copper River, in Alaska. Assistant Ritter had carried on work in this locality during the past season, and his instructions were to take up the operations at t'he point left off and carry them on, in order to develop the region around Orea, Alaska. . The party left San Francisco on May 26 and arrived at Orea, Prince William Sound, on June 12, having called at Seattle on May 9 and Sitka on June 7. Immediately on arrival at the field of action operations were begun to build a camp. The outfit and boats, which had been stored at Orea during the winter, were overhauled, and all material was transported to the camp site situated near Cape Whitshed, about 12 miles distant. From this point triangulation was carried 011, starting from the base line '' Whitshed to Egg Island,'' determined during the previous season, and carried around the cape, continuing in a northeasterly direction toward Orea and Cordova. Connection was made with the Orea astronomic station of 1898. From the base line just mentioned a scheme was also extended in a westwardly directio\1 from Cape Whitshed to the vicinity of Point Johnson, Prince William Sound. During the course of the work the positions and heights of the principal peaks of the different mountain ranges in ·the vicinity were determined. The triangulation

stations were permanently marked. The triangulation party encountered many difficulties in their work, not the least of which was the great distance it was sometimes necessary to travel for the occupation of points. Camping sites were extremely difficult to find, and ou many days it was necessary to travel as much as 15 miles to occupy a station.
HYDROGRAPHY .

Hydrographic operations began as soon as the other work permitted. Soundings were taken on. nine days during the month of August. The hydrography of Orea Inlet, extending from the mouth to Spike Island, was executed with care. In addition

to the soundings, a number of flats, channels, shores, and rocks were located at extreme low water by means of the plane table. At Sr ike Island the hydrography joins that which was executed in 1897 by the United States Fish Commission :teamer Albatross, Lieut. Commander J. F. Moser, commanding. In order to shpw the general hydrographic conditions of the mud flats forming the western end of the Copper River Delta, a number of sounding lines were run extending from Cape Wl:iitshed eastward as far as Glacier Riv r.

The topographic work consisted mainly of delineating with the plane table the shore line and contiguous topograph), and determining, in addition, mountain peaks

and such other salient topographic features as time and weather permitted. The localities thus mapped during the season included the western end of the Copper River Delta from Egg Island to Cape Whitshed, Point Steel to the entrance of Orea Inlet, the eastern end of Hawkins Island Cut-off, and Orea Inlet from the entrance to the head of Cordova Bay. Aid Denson was in charge of the triangulation work. Assistant Latham had charge of the photography, the location of tide gauges and bench marks, and the determination of time for tide obser\rations. Assistant Ritter did the topography and exercised general supervision. The hydrography was done by the chief of party, Assistant Latham, and Aid Denson. In the early part of October the party moved to Orea, from which point the work was extended into the upper end of Cordova Bay. Leaving Orea on the 23d, San Francisco was reached on the 18th of November. Assistant Latham was detached from the party and proceeded East. Aid Denson remained until December 1, assisting in the prepar~tion of records, and Assistant Ritter left on the 19th, reporting at Washington on the 2d of January.
TIDE OBSERVATIONS.

Tide observations were made at Camp Whitshed, both day and night, from June 27 to August 1. Tides '"ere also observed at O.-ca from July 26 to July 31, and again from October 1 to October 23. The observations at Orea and Cape Whitshed being to a certain extent made simultaneously for a number of days, the relations between the tides at the two stations was well fixed. In connection with the tide work, observations for the temperature of air, wind, and weather conditions, etc., were recorded in the record book.
PHOTOGRAPHY.

The photographic outfit consisted of 2 cameras; one a photo-topographic for 5 by 8 inch plates, and the other a view camera using plates 6~ by 8~ inches. Necessary developing accessories were carried along, and the negatives were developed in the field. Photographic stations were located with a view to furnish data and give detailed features of the area surveyed during the summer.
SEISMIC OBSERVATIONS.

From September 3 t0-September 29, 1899, a number of more or less severe earthquake shocks were felt in camp at Cape Whitshed. These were recorded by Assistant Ritter, and the list was submitted with his report. The work of sounding and running shore line during and after the disturbances gave an opportunity to judge of the effect of the earthquake shocks upon the topographic features. It was found that the changes were very slight, an overhanging outer or soft bank being sometimes precipitated into the water below. The party arri~ed in San Francisco on the 18th of November, and the time from this date until the 19th of December was employed in closing up the field work, in obedience to the Superintendent's instructions of November 9. On December 19 Assistant Ritter left for Washington, where he arrived on the 1st of January, having had leave of absence on the way, at Cleveland, Ohio.

Assistant Ritter was engaged in the reduction of field work for the previous season until the 7th of March, when preparations were made to resume field work in Alaska. He left Washington on the 14th, bound for Sau Francisco, from which point he sailed for Orea, Alaska, via Seattle, on the 29th of March. Arriving on the I 7th, he was engaged in organizing his party and making preliminary observations until the 6th of May, when be left Orea for Unalaska, in order to bring over the steamer Taku, which was to be employed during the season in the neighborhood of Orea. Returning on the 26th of May with the Taku, surveying operations were continued without interruption and were still in progress on the 30th of June.

On the 1st of July the steamer Gedney was in San Francisco Harbor, taking on stores preparatory for work in Alaska. Everything being in readiness, the vessel, under command of Assistant Dickins, sailed 011 the 4th of July and arrived at Seattle on the 9th. After a few repairs, the necessity of which had developed 011 the trip up the coast, the vessel left Seattle on Sunday morning, July 16, and arrived at Sitka on the 24th, having stopped on the way at Victoria Harbor and at Departure Bay, British Columbia. After having taken on coal and made minor repairs to the Cosmos, which was found in rather bad condition, the party left Sitka for Killisnoo, where launch No. I q was taken in tow, and the working ground was reached on the 6th of August. Work was immediately begun on the triangulation, and signals were erected between the 7th and 2 xst. On the latter date observations began and were continued until September 22, at w~ch date the complete connection between Chatham and Sumner straits had been made. Owing to bad weather and other unfavorable circumstances, no base line or azimuth could be measured as a test. After closing work, the vessel proceeded to Killisnoo, where launch No. II7 was left. Sitka was reached on the 27th. The Cosmos was housed for the winter, and left in charge of Col. M. C. Goodrell, United States Marine Corps, who kindly offered to have the boathouse inspected at least twice a

month. Such parts of the machinery as required repairing were subsequently brought to Seattle, and a special report was made on the condition of the vessel. Receiving inst;uctions at this point to search for an uncharted rock in Wrangell Narrows, recently reported, the vessel left Sitka and proceeded to Killisnoo, where launch No. II7 was hauled out and housed. Arriving at Wrangell Narrows on October 7, a search was made for the obstruction to navigation reported, but nothing was discovered except the Topeka . No. ~8. Shoal, which is. already charted, and 134" oo' on which it is believed the steamer Cutch struck. 30' Passing through the strait on the voyage southward, it was noticed that the Point Lockwood rock buoy was nussmg. This was reported to the inspector of the Thirteenth lighthouse district. Arriving in Departure Bay, British Columbia, on the evening of October 11, the coal bun~ers were filled the next day, and the ship got under way for Victoria, where she arrived about midnight. The Gedney sailed on the morning of the 14th for Seattle, and arrived in the afternoon. Receiving orders at this place regarding the reported rock in Rosario Strait, the ship left on the morning of the 18th and arrived at New Whatcom in the evening. Two days were lost on account of bad weather, but on the 21st she proceeded to Rosario Strait, a tide gauge was Triangulation between Cbaibam and Sumner Sttalt,Alaska. established, and the necessary signals erected. On the 22d the Buckeye Shoal was located and developed, and on the 23d another shoal near the entrance to Obstruction Pass, which had been reported by the captain of the steamer Lydia Thompson, was located. The vessel then returned to Seattle and awaited further orders. On the 28th Assistant Dickins received instructions to turn over the command of the Gedney to Mr. G. F. Thomae, first watch officer, and proceed to San Francisco for office duty. He arrived at the latter point on the 5th of November. Assistant Dickins's occupation for the remainder of the year is reported under the Western Division. S. Doc. 68--14

On April 12 Assistant Gilbert received instructions to proceed as soon as practicable to Seattle, Wash., and take command of the steamer Pathfinder. He left San Francisco on the 16th and reached Seattle on the 20th. On Sunday, the 22d, Assistant Gilbert was present at morning inspection and formally assumed command of the. vessel. The first duty was to attend to certain repairs. On May 18 the vessel was taken to Port Orchard, and early the next morning the Pat/ifinder and the Patterson were docked together. The vessel came out of dock on the 24th. She was delayed two days longer, getting some fittings from the foundry and machine shop, at the end of which time Assista11t Gilbert returned with the vessel to Seattle. The last coal was taken on board on the morning of the 13th. Six officers and nine men of the United States Geological Survey were also taken on board, and the ship sailed at 12.30 the same day. After a week's passage Tegalda Island, off Akutan Pass, was sighted. Approaching the island near enough to verify his position Assistant Gilbert shaped his course through the pass and entered Dutch Harbor at 10.30 that night. Coal was he.re taken aboard. Leaving Dutch Harbor Sunday morning, June 25, Nome was reached on the following Wednesday. A stay was made here only long enough to mail letters, and at 3 p. m. the vessel proceeded to Golofnin Bay, where anchor was cast at 9 p. m. On Thursday, June 28, the Geological Survey party and outfit was landed in the morning, and in the afternoon six buoys were placed, marking the best channel through the bay. A line of soundings was run to the mouth of the bay. The buoys were made of oil barrels, and were anchored with concrete blocks of sand, gravel, and cement, weighing about :80 pounds each. Immediately thereafter the party. started for St. Michael, where the vessel came to anchor seven hours later. 1.'he next two days were occupied in putting down a shed over the Yukon anci the launches, and on the 1st of July the only preliminary work remaining to be done was to launch the Yukon and set up the machinery.

Instructions were issued to Assistant Forney on the 15th of January, 1900, to take up triangulation in Porto Rico. He sailed on January 20~ accompanied by Mr. J. S. Bilby, foreman, and arrived at Ponce on the 27th. From this point he proceeded to San Juan, arriving .on the 3d of February. At this point an outfit of mules, saddle horses, and wagons were furnished through the courtesy of the department quartermaster, United States Army, and on February 2 the party left San Juan with the outfit for Ponce, arriving on the 4th. . On February 5 the equipage and instruments were moved from La Playa to Ponce, and the camp was pitched east of the city. The reconnaissance for the triangulation across the island from the line Cardona Light-Muertos Light to San Juan Light was immediately begun. After making an effort to observe from Cardona Light on a lozenge 5 feet square at Magota station, it was found that the results were unsatisfactory, and heliotropes were therefore stationed at Magota and Aibonito stations. This plan also proved unsatisfactory,, owing to the clouds and fog which almost constantly hover over the mountain ranges during the day. At night, however, from I I p. m. ttritil 4 a. m., the mountain peaks were comparatively free from clouds. What are known as Economy gas lamps were then placed at these two stations, and the observation of horizontal and vertical angles carried on with little interruption, giving satisfactory results. Reconnaissance and triangulation was conducted simultaneously, and rapid ~nd satisfactory progress was made; and the whole work was completed, together with the determination of an astronomic azimuth at San Juan, in three months from the time of beginning.

The island of Porto Rico was crossed by two quadrilaterals, and the main scheme of Assistant Forney's triangulation was connected with that of Assistant Hodgkins south of San Juan. In addition to the main scheme of triangulation across the island, prominent peaks lying to the eastward and westward, and prominent objects, such as chimneys and church towers along the southern slope and shore of the island, were determined by intersection. Complete series of vertical angles were measured on all points determined. Assistant Forney states, as a result of his experience, that triangulation in the interior of Porto Rico can not be carried on advantageously without the use of lights

and night observations. He estimates that without this method the time consumed in the prosecution of the work would at least have been doubled. Assistant Forney makes grateful acknowledgment to General Davis, commanding the Department of Porto Rico; to Major Glassford, the chief signal officer, and various other officers of the Army for aid given in .t4e prosecution of the work and for courtesies extended. On May 5, the triangulation having been completed as well as the azimuth observations at Latimer triangulation station, the camp equipage and instruments were packed and placed on board the U. S . transport .Crook for transportation to New York. On May 10 the hands were discharged, and the same day Assistant Bowie, Mr. Bilby, and Assistant Forney sailed for New York, arriving on the 19th. Assistant Forney was employed in the Office until the close of the year.

The work of repairing the Blake, at Baltimore, continued until the 10th of February. Assistant W. C. Hodgkins, commanding, received instructions 'in January to proceed to Porto Rico and Culebra Island and take up hydrographic and topographic work in that locality. The vessel got under way on February xo, but the weather being unfavorable, . a short stop was made at Norfolk, Va. On the 14th she sailed for San Juan, which point was reached on the 20th of February. Culebra Harbor was reached before noon of the 24th. The Coast and Geodetic Survey schooner Eagre was found here at anchor, under command of Assistant J. B. Boutelle. After consultation with Assistant Boutelle in regard to the condition of the work, the Blake proceeded to St. Thomas to make arrangements for using that point as a base of supplies. The work of the survey was taken up on the 27th of February, by making a reconnaissance of the islands and the building of the necessary signals. A latitude station was selected on Battle Cay, a small island in Mangrove Harbor, on the east side of Culebra Island. A trigonometric connection was made between the

An intermediate station was established on Savana Island, about midway between Culebra Light and St. Thomas Harbor, which, in connection with the station on the eastern end of Vieques Island, enabled 3; fairly well-shaped scheme to be laid out. All of the triangulation of the season depends upon the base line near the head of Culebra Harbor, measured by Assistant Boutelle. A considerable number of triangulation points were established on the north coast of Vieques Island and on the east coast of Porto Rico, so that a topographic or hydrographic party would have no difficulty in beginning work anywhere north of Point Lima or east of Point Arenas. The topographic work of the season was limited to the survey of the shore line of Culebra and adjacent islands, the harbors being surveyed on a scale of J : S ooo and the remainder of the shore on a scale of I: 10 ooo. The hydrography followed much the same rule. The party on the Blake had one sheet covering the so-called sound, east of Culebra, including Mangrove Harbor. Four sheets show the hydrography around the island, and one covers the extensive sheet of water between Culebra, Vieques, and Porto Rico. The eastern part of the sound, as far as examined, was found of sufficient and nearly uniform depth. West of this, and close to the shore of Porto Rico, there is a rather narrow and somewhat tortuous channel, with a depth of water sufficient for any ordinary vessel. To the south of a dangerous area there is also a good channel between these shoals and those lying toward the shores of the island of Vieques Island. Great caution should be exercised in this locality, as the indications of the shoal spots upon existing charts are thought to be unreliable, both as to their number and their positions. Some distance to the eastward of the eastern rock a bank of considerable extent was discovered, with depths of 5 fathoms or less, while it deepened suddenly to 12 fathoms all around. There was no indication of this bank on the cha~ts. A number of lines were run through the passage between the north end of Palominos Island and a chain of islets and reefs, known as the Cordilleros, which extends nearly to Cactus Bay and forms a barrier between the Atlantic and Vieques Sound. This barrier is, however, more of a danger than a protection. The frequent gaps permit the ocean swell to pass with little hindrance in heavy weather, so that at Port Mula, on the northern coast of Vieques Island, the anchorage is very unsafe during a norther on account of the heavy swell which sets in. The principal passages through the reef are those called Hermanos, and the Barriles. Both have been supposed to be deep and free from danger, but caution is necessary in navigating the Hermanos Passage until it is regularly surveyed, as rocks have been reported to exist nearly midway in the passage. The Barriles Passage has been quite carefully surveyed. The anchorages along the southeastern coast of Porto Rico are all poor, being upon roadsteads exposed to the prevailing winds of the sea. On June 30 the Blake closed work at Culebra Island and proceeded to St. Thomas, to prepare for the trip to San Juan on her return to the United States.

On January 6 Assistant Boutelle left Baltimore, bound for San Juan, P. R., where he arrived on the 21st of January. The party immediately began the survey of the harbor at San Juan, and signals were erected as a preliminary to the topographic and hydrographic work. At this st~ge of the operations instructions were received by Assistant Boutelle to stop the work at San Juan and proceed with the vessel to Culebra Island, in order to make a survey of that locality. A base line and an azimuth were measured at Great Harbor, Culebra, and the triangulation was extended over the island and the

outlying cays to the westward. The geographic positions were computed, using the published position of Culebra light-house as a base. The topographic and hydrographic work on the sheet covering Great Harbor was executed on a scale of I :5 ooo. Assistant Boutelle reports the great difficulty experienced in executing the hydrographic work outside of the harbor, owing to the very heavy sea running at all times. During the three months at Culebra there were only three days when it was smooth enough for good work outside the harbor. A topographic sheet was completed on the south side of the island, after which the inshore hydrography of the southwest shore of Culebra was executed. On May 13 the Eagre proceeded to Fajardo and made a preliminary survey of that harbor. The triangulation was extended from the Culebra work already executed. The hydrography of the harbor was completed over an area covering the anchorage in front of the playa and extending to Cape San Juan, including the Laja Shoal, a dangerous obstruction to navigation in front of the harbor. The soundings were extended out to not less than 6 fathoms. · On May 31, in accordance with instructions from Washington, Assistant Boutelle proceeded with the vessel to San Juan, and after laying up the steam launch for inspection at that place he sailed for Baltimore on June 7, arriving there on the 17th. Assistant Boutelle reports the inadequacy of sailing vessels for the execution of hydrography in Porto Rico and adjacent islands. A steamer that can stand a heavy sea is a necessity for all except harbor work. The question of water is a very serious one for any vessel without a dfstilling apparatus. The places where water can be obtained are St. Thomas, San Juan, Mayaguez, and Ponce, and it is necessary for a sailing vessel like the Eagre to employ at least one-third of her time in going for water.

At the expiration of a leave of absence, on November 16, Assistant Nelson reported at the Office and was engaged until the 22d in making preparations for field work in Porto Rico. He started on November 23 and arrived at Ponce on December 11, having been detained eleven days at San Juan while waiting for the arrival of the outfit and instruments and making arrangements for transportation with the quartermaster of the army. The members of the party arrived in Ponce on December I?, and the party was immediately organized and field work begun. Reconnaissance was carried from the Ponce to Guayanilla Bay. Up to the close of the calendar year five triangulation points had been selected, six signals were built, and two stations were occupied. The party moved from Ponce to Tallaboa on December 22 and went into camp. Considerable delay was occasioned in the work while clearing out lines from the known triangulation points, as the entire country west of Ponce is covered with a dense growth of trees and brush. Three. parties were in continual operation-triangulation, topographic, and signal building. By the 8th of January signals were up to within 4 miles of Guanica, and the topography was finished to Guayanilla Bay. When the triangulation was started it was necessary to occupy the old station at Ratonas Island. 'rhe signal had been destroyed, and there was nothing to show that the spot had ever been marked, so that it was neces5ary to return to the Ponce base line for a starting point. A large lagoon near Point Cuchara was surveyed. This is a prominent feature and is shown on all published charts, but is very shoal.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.

The party was in camp at Guanica Bay from February 22 until March 2. On the 3d Assistant Nelson moved from Guanica to Parguera. The party remained here until the 17th, executing the triangulation and topography in the vicinity. On the 18th of March the party went into camp at Boqueron, near the bay of the same name. While at this station a base line and astronomic azimuth were measured in the Lajas and Boqueron Valley, near the bay. Observations for time were made at the camp, about half a mile west of the azimuth station at West Base. The party stayed at the Caho Rojo light-house for a few days, while working around the southwest corner of the island, on account of the great difficulty in reaching this particular part of the coast. On May 1 the party moved to Mayaguez, and from this point the triangulation and topography were carried to Rincon triangulation station, at Jiguera Point, where the season's work closed on May 29. The party then proceeded on the U. S. transport Crook from San Juan to New York, arriving in Washington on the morning of the 7th of June. Assistant Nelson speaks in high terms of the services rendered by Assistant J. E. McGrath and Aid F. H. Brundage; and he also acknowledges the kindness of the United States Army officers in furnishing transportation and other means for facilitating the work.

The time between the 13th of November, 1899, and the 12th of February, 1900, was spent in Baltimore, the party being engaged in miscellaneous office work, and in repairing, renovating, and fitting out the vessel for duty in the south. Acting under instructions of February 5, the Matckless sailed for Porto Rico on the 12th, arriving at San Juan on the 2d of March. The voyag~ was a long and rough one, and it was necessary to spend a few days in repairing damages to the vessel and to allow the crew needed rest. The hydrographic field work was begun in the l:iarbor of San Juan, where the sounding was confined to the limits of shoal water on the south and west sides, thus completing the hydrographic survey begun in 1899 by Assistant Hodgkins. The shore line was rerun and topographic details mapped about one-half mile back from the shore. The contour curves shown by the Spanish survey of this vicinity were examined in a number of places and found to be correct in almost every instance. Special attention was given to the development of shoals and the location of wrecks. The wreck of the Cristobal Colon lies in the middle of the entrance to the harbor, and was examined in company with a party from the United States Engineers office. After completing the work in the vicinity of San Juan, the vessel sailed on June 2 for Charleston, S. C., in accordance with instructions dated· May 21.

most desirable points of work to be first taken up. At the request of President Dole, it was·decided to i~vestigate cert~in -hati~~s ~t the isl~nd of Maui, where facilities for handling freight are quite insufficient at present; and th~ demand upon them is increasing. A thorough hydrographic and topographic survey of the port of Kahului, on the north side of the isthmus connecting East and West Maui, was first made. The harbor, which is a deep pocket at the western end of the coral reef that extends along the northern -shore of Maui;-15· ~~tremely limit~d in area. The protection which the reef affords against the regular trade winds is sufficient to insure safety under the prevailing conditions, but the sea, which breaks heavily on the reefs at all time.s, is generally so severe in the harbor as to make handling cargo difficult, and when the winds haul to the northward it is extremely rough. Such conditions would make it very undesirable to bring a wooden vessel alongside of a wharf. The reef offers a good foundation for a breakwater, but a structure that would withstand the onset of the sea at that place would be very expensive, and could not be completed in time to meet the needs of the island. The approaches were examined to the limit of the 100-fathom curve, and currents and wave conditioµs were alsojnvestigated. The currents were observed by using bottles, each carrying a small flag and so weighted that only about an inch of the neck showed above water. These were set adrift outside of the mouth of the harbor and for a considerable distance along the - out$!r edge of the reef, and observations made upon them to determine the velocity and direction of the current. Upon the completion of the work o~ the north coast of Maui the party moved to Hilo, on Hawaii. At this point a detailed survey was mane covering the harbor, the reef, and the approaches, and extending to the 100-fathom curve. Magnetic observations were also made. After completing the work at Hilo the vessel ran to Honolulu for coal, and a party of four officers and two men were landed on the way, at Lahaina, to make magnetic and tidal observations, and to commence the triangulation. The survey of this region includes Kamalalaea Bay, the great fiat lying between Maui and the islands of Kahoolawe and Lanai, with the Auau, Kealaikahihi, and Alalakeiki channels. The hydrography covers the area between Maui and a line joining Lanai and Kahoolawe. In addition to the work already described, a survey was made of the harbor of Kaunakakai, on the south side of Molokai, which includes all necessary details. The entrance is marked by buoys. This harbor is a narrow pocket in a coral reef which gives acce~ to a good pier extending from the shore to deep water, and it affords g.ood shelter. The hydrography of the harbors and reefs was all done with a launch and whaleboat, using a hand lead. In deep water the soundings were made from the steamer with the Lord Kelvin apparatus, using the Tanner tubes, the hand lead being substituted on the shoal parts of the lines. The lines of soundings in harbors were spaced according to the irregularities of the ·bottom, and were ranged in the usual manner. On the reefs the lines were run wherever the conditions made it practicable. Much hydrographic work was done as soon as the signals had been erected and in

advance of the triangulation. For the steamer work outside of harbors the plan of running two or more lines parallel with the coast was finally adopted, the near inner one being as near shore as the nature of the bottom seemed to warrant, and to cover the remaining spaces out to the roo-fathom curve with lines sufficient to develop the general features of the bottom. The triangulation was based on the Hawaiian Government survey work, and the method pursued was to accept the geographic position of a certain point, with the azimuth and distance to the farthest accessible station, and use this data as a base for the work. The topography was confined to the shore line 9f the harbors and their immediate neighborhood, including the towns and villages. Outside these limits the shore line was used as determined by the Hawaiian Government surveys. Efforts were made to aid the topographic work by the use of the camera, but the conditions were unfavorable and the result was not very satisfactory. The haze in this region is persistent, and this necessitates considerable exposure in order to secure details. As the vessel always had a decided motion, it was necessary to choose between an under exposure and a blurred negative. At Honolulu, Hilo, and Lahaina the magnetic stations previously occupied in 1892 by Assistant E. D. Preston were recovered and reoccupied. At Waikiki a telephone line made the selection of a new station necessary. At Kahului no previous observations had been made so far as known. Each of the determinations of declination consists of both elongations on a given day. At each of the stations except Waikiki the azimuth was determined from the adjacent triangulation. On account of the slight fluctuations of the needle and the irregularities in the time of elongation, the observations for declination were usually prolonged beyond the necessary time, and at Kahului and Hilo, on one day each, ro-minute observations were continued throughout the day without change of setting, while at Lahaina three such continuous sets were secured.

Until the 23d of January Assistant Marindin was engaged in miscellaneous office work at Washington, D. C. On the date just mentioned a letter was received from the Honorable Secretary of War, transmitting a copy of a resolution of the United States Senate of the 22d, requesting a report on the amount of work done by the contractor, Mr. C. P. Goodyear, on, the Brunswick Outer Bar, Ga. This report was completed on February 23 and was immediately forwarded to the War Department. From this date until March 12 attention was given to various matters, among which was an inquiry as ·to the proposed hydrographic work in the harbor of San Pedro, Cal., and notes on the undernin; of the salt water up the Hudson River, as well as to the possible effect of the proposed improvement of East Channel from Sandy Hook Bar in New York Bay. · On March 12 Assistant Marindin was called to attend the seventy-ninth session of the Mississippi River Commission, at St. Louis, Mo. This duty included a tour of . inspection from St. Louis to New Orleans, at the conclusion of which Assistant Marindin returned to the office and reported on the 27th of March. On the 29th a further request was received from the War Department for information as to the amount of material removed in the channel over the Brunswick Bar, Ga., by the explosion of dynamite. The computation of volumes was completed during the first part of April, and on the 26.th the report was forwarded to the War Department. From the latter date to the end of the fiscal year he was engaged in miscellaneous duty in connection with the Mississippi River Commission and the Coast and Geodetic, Survey.

Graduation of bench standard.

During the month of May, Mr. L. A. Fischer, of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, received instructions to proceed to Boston and graduate the · roo-foot bench standard belonging to the street commissioners' office into feet and meters. This bench standard is adjacent to the west side of the old court-house building, and is suitably protected from the sun during a large part of the day. The standard had large silver plugs inserted at 0 feet, IO feet, 50 feet, and 100 feet, and at 1 meter and 30 nieters-in all, s~x plugs. The surface of the bench standard was also polished at intervals of IO feet and 3 meters, to carry temporary graduations. The graduating and comparing bar was IO feet long, and was graduated at the ·following points: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and IO feet, as well as at 1, 2, and 3 meters. The values of these graduations were carefully determined by comparison with the standards at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office before the bar was shipped to Boston, and after its return to Washington additional comparisons were made to check the first. 225 S.

Marconi system of wireless telegraphy.

On the 28th of October telegraphic instructions were sent to Prof. S. W. Stratton, Inspector of Weights and Measures, to report to Admiral Farquhar, U. S. N., commanding the North Atlantic fleet, to witness the test by the Navy Department of the Marconi system of wireless telegraphy. He proceeded to New York, arriving on the 30th of October, and reporting immediately to Admiral Farquhar on board the flagship New York. The tests were to be made by means of two ships, the New York and Massackusetts, and a shore station at Navesink, each being fitted with a set of Marconi apparatus. The ships mentioned proceeded to sea Monday morning. Communication was kept up between them and with the shore station throughout the day and early part of the night, at distances varying from 1 to 35 miles. The following day was stormy, with heavy rain and a gale. The vertical wire at Navesink was disabled by the storm, thus preventing communication with the shore station. The tests were continued during November 1, and included the so-called interference experiments intended to demonstrate whether or uot a third station could interfere with the sending of signals between two others. The distances over which the messages may be sent depends largely upon the height of the vertical wire and the adjustment of the apparatus. A height of 150 feet was used in these experiments. Professor Stratton concludes his report with acknowledgments, both to the officers of the United States Navy and to Mr. Marconi, for courtesies shown and opportunity given to,witness the experiments.

Bibliography of the surveys of Mason and Dixon's line.

The importance of the boundary line between Pennsylvania and Maryland, and between Maryland and Delaware, has led to the preparation by this Office of a bibliography of the publications made on this subject. This work was intrusted to Mr. Edw. L. Burchard, chief of the Library and Archives Division, and the field work connected therewith was accomplished in July and August, 1899. In order to have knowledge of all that had been done on this subject, as well as to prepare for more effective work in all the localities, Mr. Burchard undertook, by correspondence, to locate the material necessary for a report. To this end letters were sent to the editors of the principal newspapers and to the clerks of the county courts in each county along Mason and Dixon's line, as well as to large cities in the neighborhood. This procedure brought out considerable information and paved the way for an effectual search in the different localities mentioned. Fourteen towns and cities were visited in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware; 24 libraries and city offices were examined, and 32 calls were made at newspaper offices and on historians.

was undertaken pursuant to a request from the Navy Department, as it was desired to have a course exactly 1 nautical mile in length and in the deepest water obtainable at th.e location chosen. Considerable difficulty was expe:r:ienced in executing the necessary triangulation, on account of the heavily wooded shores. The range marks necessary for this work were also necessarily somewhat close, on account of the topographic features. The party returned to Baltimore on the 28th of September and were engaged in office work in connection with the trial course until the 12th of October, at which date the completed records were sent to the Office, in Washington. From March 14 until April 17 Assistant Yates was on leave of absence, and from the 18th to the close of the year he was on duty in Europe, engaged in studying the hydrographic methods and organizations of England, France, and Germany. He also established a number of foreign chart agencies and made a study of . the processes of engraving at the Military Geographic Institute at Vienna.

SPECIAL OPERATIONS.

Location of buoys on speed-trial course.

At the request of the Navy Department, an Assistant of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was detailed on March 26 to assist in the location of buoys at the ends of the trial course off Cape Charles City, Va. Assistant F. A. Young was charged with this work, and left Baltimore for Old Point Comfort on the evening of March 27. Arriving on the following day, he joined the light-house tender Maple, which proceeded immediately to Portsmouth, where Capt. Joseph N. Hemphill, U.S. N., of the Board of Inspection and Survey, to whom Assistant Young reported, took charge. Two second-class can buoys, marked with horizontal white and black stripes, each furnished with 30 fathoms of chain and a block of granite weighing 3 ooo pounds for an anchor, were taken on board. The tender next proceeded to Norfolk, where'Lieut. Commander Richard Henderson, U. S. N., joined the party. As there was a stiff northerly breeze prevailing and a choppy sea running, it was impossible to locate the buoys from a small boat. Two trial buoys were prepared, each consisting of a small red keg, with 30 fathoms of line attached and anchored by a 15-pound weight. The southeast buoy was first located. The Maple was placed on range outside the outer position and steamed landward, the buoy being dropped when the required position was reached. The determination was made by means of sextant angles measured between objects on shore whose position was known. The northwest end was located in the same way, and the large buoys were then put in position. Each anchor is provided with 30 fathoms of chain, so that there is some play, and the differences in position due to ebb and.flood tide would possibly amount to 50 feet. However, as the buoys are only to be used as marks, the distance being measured by ranges, this change of position has no material effect.

In obedience to instructions of February 21, he left Washington in company with Mr. Harry L. Ford on that day, and arrived at Woods Hole on the morning of the 22d. All preparations had been made to lay the cable on the 23d, but on account of delay in loading it in New York anq a heavy southwest gale on the 25th and 26th nothing could

be done until Tuesday, the 27th. On this date an attempt was made to start the line from Nobska Light Point, but in their endeavor to carry the end of the cable ashore it became jammed among the rocks, and so much delay was caused thereby that the laying was deferred until the following day. On the morning of the 28th a second attempt was made, this time from the other end, namely, West Chop, and as the beach is there bold and free from rocks a favorabie start was made. At 9.15 a. m. the line was begun, the pilot steering on a natural range and making straight across. At 10. 30 the tug was anchored within 200 yards of the terminal at the other end. The entire work was completed by 2. 15 p. m., and a message was sent over the line. The first 2 miles were run in one hour, and during this time angles were taken every five minutes on the signals Falmouth Heights Observatory, Nobska Light, and Tarpaulin Cove Light. In the second half of the work the boat sometimes ran at a speed of 12 miles per hour, and the entire 2 miles were covered in about fifteen minutes. A projection was made before leaving the office, on a scale of 1 :20 ooo, showing determined triangulation points, and the location of the cable was laid down from angles measured with the sextant. Assistant Young acknowledges the valuable services of Mr. Harry L. Ford, and also speaks of the assistance rendered by Mr. McCoy, superintendent of construction for the telephone company, and Mr. Manson, who was present in the interest of the Akonite Company.

INTERNATIONAL LATITUDJ>. STATION. LONGITUDE. MAGNETIC.

J.

E. McGRATH, Assistant (cooperating party).
SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.
1 longitude station. 7 nights' longitude observations. 3 azimuth stations. I magnetic declination station. 2 stations for magnetic dip. 2 stations for magnetic intensity.

During the year Assistant Edwin Smith was in charge of the International Geodetic Association latitude station at Gaithersburg, Md. Considerable preliminary work was necessary in the establishment of this station; and Assistant Smith took formal charge of the operations on the 1st of July. The first work was to establish a station by erecting the necessary buildings, etc., for the latitude work. By August 11 the observatory was sufficiently advanced to admit the placing of instruments. On this date Assistant J. E. McGrath reported to Assistant Smith for duty in this connection, and the work of determining the difference of longitude between the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office in Washington and the observatory at Gaithersburg was undertaken. Three exchanges of signals were had, on August 19, 22, and 25, Assistant Smith being at Gaithersburg and Assistant McGrath at Washington. The observers now exchanged places, and four more nights were obtained, namely, August 29 and 31 and September I and 4. Work was then continued on the construction of the necessary buildings for the international latitude work, and .on September 20, the date at which the instruments arrived from Germany, the observatories were so far completed that it was possible to put the instruments in place. On September 21 the zenith telescope was mounted in the observatory and the clock was set up in the office building. The first observations were actflally made on October 2, but owing to unforeseen difficulties with the electrical illumination no observations of permanent value were made until about two weeks later. The beginning of the international latitude observations dates from October 18, 1899. As before stated, the expenses of this station are paid out of funds furnished by the International Geodetic Association.

The magnetic observatory was begun in September, but was not completed until the middle of October. The first observations were made on November 18, just one month after the beginning of the latitude observations. Since the latter date regular observations for declination, dip, and intensity have been made weekly. The weekly magnetic observations were continued to April 4, after which date the observatory was turned over to the party of Assistant Bauer. The tent was then set up some distance northeast of the observatory, where magnetic observations were made on April 12 by Mr. Edmunds and Assistant Smith, and on April 16 by Assistant Smith alone. Magnetometer No. 3 was then returned to the Office. The dip observations were continued weekly until May 22.

Steamer Endeavor, JOHN Ross: NEW YoRK, Long Island Sound.
SPECIAL DuTY. COAST PILOT PARTY. HitRBERT C. GRAVES, Nautical Expert. HARRY L. FORD, Nautical Expert. JAS. M. GRIFFIN, Clerk.

The Coast Pilot Party, under the direction of Mr. John Ross, was engaged in office work from the beginning of the year to the 22d of July. On this date, in obedience to instructions of July 17, Mr. Ross proceeded to Baltimore; Md., and assumed command of the Endeavor, relieving C. C. Yates, assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey. The other members of the Coast Pilot Party reported on the same date, and in the afternoon the Endeavor proceeded to Bush River, Maryland, in order to land Assistant Yates and his party, who had been instructed to make a topographic survey in that vici1iity. On the 23d the Endeavor got under way for New London, Conn. The work in hand was the revision of the United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part IV, as far as is included in the limits of Long Island Sound. Stops were made on the way, at Hampton Roads July 24, Delaware Breakwater July 25, New York July 27, and the vessel reached its destination on the 28th. The collection of Coast Pilot information was immediately begun and continued for three days in the immediate vicinity of New London. From August 1 to August 7 the party visited Fishers Island Sound, Point Judith Breakwater Harbor, Great Salt Pond Harbor, Gardiners Bay, Greenport, Plum Gut, Niantic Bay, and Duck Island Breakwater Harbor. At all these places information was obtained and changes noted for use in the revision of the Coast Pilot. As of special interest it may be noted that the life-saving station at Rock Point, near Greenport, was located, and an examination was made for a reported rock at Niantic Bay. On August 8 the address of the Endeavor was changed to New Haven, Conn., and between this date and August 18 the following places were visited: Thimble Islands, Bridgeport Harbor, Port Jefferson, Sheffield Island Harbor, Northport Harbor, Oyster Bay, Captains Harbor, Hempstead Harbor, and Sand Point. At all these points information of value was obtained, more particularly in the line of reported rocks and ·dangers to navigation. · In order to investigate the reliability of certain information received regarding a rock off Larchmont Harbor, the Endeavor came to anchor on August r8 at City Island. While at this point the boilers were cleaned and preparations made for the return trip to Baltimore, Md. On August 22 the party proceeded to Hoboken, N. J., for coal, and on the 25th to Erie Basin, where the party, under orders from the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography, went on board a tug to assist in an examination of a reported danger in the harbor of New York.

Tht. Endeavor left Sandy Hook on August 26 for Baltimore, Md. A stop was made at the Delaware Breakwater, and the party arrived at Baltimore at 10:45 p. m., August 28. On August 31 the party returned to Washington, the vessel in the meantime being turned over to Assistant C. C. Yates, by order of the Superintendent. The localities mentioned above constituted the salient points of the trip. It should l>e mentioned in this connection, however, that besides visiting the places stated, both shores of Long Island Sound and its estuaries were carefully examined for such changes in hydrography, topography, and aids to navigation as affect the Cqast Pilot volumes in these waters. A number of changes affecting the sailing directions in the second edition of the Coast Pilot, Part IV, were also noted. Mr. Ford was detached from the Endeavor on August 18 and ordered to Brunswick, Ga. Mr. Graves was detached on August 31, at Baltimore, and resumed his office duties in Washington. Mr. James M. Griffin resumed his duties at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office in Washington on September 1. . Mr. C. L. Green reported for duty on August 24 to assist in bringing the Endeavor to Baltimore. He was detached on August 30. From .September r until December 31 the party was engaged in office work in \Vashington. Mr. Ross remained with the party until March. On the 2d of this month instructions were issued directing him to make a report on the ports and waterways along the Atlantic coast, between Chesapeake Bay Entrance and St. Augustine, for the purpose of obtaining data for the revision of the Coast Pilot, Part VII. He left Washington on the ~vening of March 6, arriving at Norfolk on the morning of the 7th. From this point southvyard the trip was continued, and valuable information was acquired at many points along the route. Investigations were made between Chesapeake Bay and Albemarle Sound, in the inland passes between Georgetown and Charleston, S. C., the inland passage between Charleston and Beaufort, S. C., the traveled route between Beaufort and Savannah, Ga., and between the latter point and Brunswick. From Brunswick, Ga., to Fernandina, Fla., the necessary information was also acquired in order to revis.e the Coast Pilot in hand. South of Fernandina there is no inland waterway along the coast that is available for vessels of more than 3 feet draft, except Biscayne Bay and the Hawk Channel.

In connection with the observations of the total solar eclipse of May 28, Assistant Putnam was detailed for certain astronomic work for the Smithsonian Institution expedition. He made two trips to Wadesboro·, N. C., the point of observations, the one extending from the 7th to the 12th of May and the other from the 26th to the 29th. The transportation was furnished by the Smithsonian Institution, which also defrayed

the actual expenses in connection with this work. The latitude and longitude of a central point in the grounds was determined to the nearest second of arc. The latitude depends on observations on nine pairs, observed on two nights by the Talcott method. The longitude depends on star-transit observations for local time made at Wadesboro on five nights, in comparison with the noon telegraph signals from the Naval Observatory at Washington on five days, using two chronometers. An azimuth was determined by sun observations in the morning and afternoon with the 7-inch theodolite, which was set up at the astronomic station. The reference mark was the tower of the Pee

Dee Institu\e. From this azimuth line various meridians in other directions were laid out with the theodolite, as needed in setting up and adjusting the various instruments. With the assistance of Mr. Hoxie measurements were made with steel tape and theodolite to locate all buildings, apparatus, and instruments on the grounds, and from these the accompanying plan has been platted on a scale of 1 :200. The magnetic declination was determined at the magnetic station on May 27-28, using Coast and Geodetic Survey declinometer No. 733. The declination was found to be remarkably close to the agonic lihe. At the request of Professor Holmes, State Geologist of North Carolina, and by direction of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, a meridian line was laid out for the use of surveyors and others. This meridian is marked by two marble blocks, 9 inches by 9 inches by 2 feet.

EDMONDS: CALIFORNIA.
SPECIAL DUTY.

From the beginning of the fiscal year to October 29, Assistant F. W. Edmonds was attached to the Coast Survey steamer Gedney, under the command of Assistant E. F. Dickins. After having been detached from the steamer Gedney, and having taken a leave of absence, he reported to Assistant Rodgers on the 6th of November, and was engaged under his direction until the 30th of March. In compliance with instructions of March 24, which were received on the 30th, Assistant Edmonds undertook the collection of data relative to the early surveys of the southeastern boundary of California. With this object in view he visited the offices of the United States sun1eyor-general at San Francisco, at Sacramento, Cal., and at Reno and Carson City, Nev. At the latter point tracings were made of two interesting maps of the surveys of 1863 and 1865. This work lasted until the 7thof May. On the following day Assistant Edmonds reported to Assistant Rodgers for duty in the suboffice at San Francisco, and was assigned to general office work. On May 22 he reported to Assistant Fremont Morse for duty in office work under his direction. On the 29th of May Assistant Edmonds was directed to report to Assistant Dickins for duty on the steamer Gedney, and from this date until the close of the year his duties were aboard ship and in the suboffice at Seattle.

ULLRICH: PORTO RICO, CuLEBRA.
SPECIAL OPF;RATIONS. SANITARY CONDITIONS.

PORTO RICO.

The following facts are taken from a report by Dr. Ullrich, who, as surgeon on the schooner Eagre, was stationed at San Juan, P.R., for a short time in February, I900. The city of San Juan is situated on a promontory, about 100 feet above sea level, sloping on both sides toward the water. The trade winds, which blow from the east nearly the entire year, temper the climate agreeably. In December, 1899, the extreme ranges of temperature were from 65° to 85° F., with an average of 76° for the month. The greatest daily range was 15°. The most rain falls in November, the least in March. The city is well drained, owing to the nature of the surface as well as to the sewers, which empty into the harbor near its entrance. The sanitary conditions during the old regime were woefully inadequate, but at present regrilar inspection is made, and property holders are obliged to comply within a reasonable time with modern sanitary requirements. The streets are now well paved, vitrified brick being used in the business portion of the city and small cobblestones in the remainder. They are kept clean by prisoners, and are swept several times daily. · ' The water supply comes from Stony River. A reservoir is established at Rio Piedras. From this point pipes carry the.water a distance of about 8 miles to the city. The reservoir is new and has a capacity sufficient to supplY: about 700 ooo gallons per day. Two large filters, which are as yet unfinished, will be used in connection with the reservoir. The water should not only be filtered, but· boiled, before being used for drinking purposes. The vessels in the harbor are supplied with spring water brought off in lighters. The population of San Juan, in I897, according to Spanish records, was 33 955, of whom one-half can neither read nor write; 7 per cent of the remainder can read only. Public schools are crowded, but are well ventilated and lighted. The mortality records show that during the decade 1890-1900 the average number of deaths per year was 975 . . According to the last census the death rate was about 32 per 1 ooo, which is exceedingly high when compared with that of United States cities. The vital sta,tistics for August, 1899, show that the death causes are about equally distributed among 36 diseases, with the exception of one-pulmonary tuberculosiswhich is several times as large as any of the others. The month of December, 1899, shows about au equal distribution, agreeing, however, with the month of August in that consumption is several times as large as the average. · S. Doc. 68--16
241

242

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

From 1890 to 1899 a mortality table is furnished, classifying all deaths under nine heads, from which it appears that of the 4 ooo deaths during this period nearly 2 ooo were from tuberculosis. The next cause, in point of number, is malarial fever, with 731, and the last is diphtheria, with 52. No single case of smallpox now appears in the city, the disease having been stamped out by the vaccination on the island of 780 ooo people during the months of April, May, and June. Leprosy and elephantiasis exist among the poorer classes. A small island west of the entrance of the harbor has been set aside by the board of health for the isolation of the leprosy patients. At present, however, they are confined in a smali building in the rear of the city jail. It is believed that the city is fairly healthy, notwithstanding the comparatively high death rate, which is believed to be due more to the character of the population and the unfavorable conditions than to the climate. Quarters of the poor are overcrowded, a condition which can not be remedied, owing to want of space. Americans residing here enjoy excellent health and speak well of the climate.
CUL'EBRA.

Culebra is a small island about 5 miles long and 2 ~ miles wide, lying 20 miles east of Porto Rico. Vieques, or Crab Island, is half as far away, and is four or five times the size of Culebra. rn· connection with the last-named island, a report by Dr. Ullrich, a medical officer attached to the schooner Eagre, may be cited as giving some information of the sanitary condition of the place. The climate differs from Porto Rico by being somewhat cooler and less rainy. The general health of the people is good, but the most prevalent ·diseases, contrary to what one would expect, are consumption and rheumatism. Malaria also exists to a considerable extent where the soil favors its development. In looking over the official records, Dr. Ullrich found no death from typhoid fever or smallpox. Notwithstanding this fact, the inhabitants were all vaccinated during the year. There is absolutely no good drinking water except that caught during the rainy season in two large cisterns. This water is dea1t out daily to the people, at the rate of 1 gallon per head for adults and one-half gallon for children. There are only two streams in the island that fl.ow during the entire year. Water can be found by digging wells. In every case, however, it develops a peculiar odor after standing, and has a cloudy appearance and brackish taste. The island has excellent grazing facilities, and at least 2 ooo head of fine cattle were seen. The most urgent recommendation made by Dr. Ullrich is that all drinking water should be either distilled or boiled. With this precaution he believes the climate as healthy in Culebra as in many favored places in the United States.

CRUISE OF THE UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURWY STEAMER PATHFINDER FROM WASHINGTON, I.UI.U,

D.

C., TO SAN FRANCISCO, CAI.., AND Tb HONO-

H. I ..

A report by FRANK WAI.J..EY PERKINS, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Commanding.

The U. S. S. Path.finder was designed especially for use in surveying the Aleutian Archipelago, where, owing to strong currents, distance from a base of supplies, etc., a vessel of considerable power and coal capacity was demanded. Her field of operations was by no means to be confined to those northern waters, but a craft that was suitable for that region would be capable of keeping the open sea for long periods and in any kind of weather. Such a vessel would therefore be adapted for duty of any class. She was built at the Crescent Shipyard, Elizabethport, N. J., and launched December 7, 1898." She is a three-deck steel vessel of extra strength, with 15 water-tight compartments, is 196 feet 3 inches over all, 33 feet 6 inches beam, 19 feet 8 inches depth of hold, and when equipped for sea draws 13 feet of water and has a displacement of about 1 ooo tons. She is brigantine-rigged, carrying some 4 500 square feet of canvas; has a single screw 10 feet diameter and 13 feet pitch; triple-expansion engines developing 846 horsepower or 1 173 horsepower under forced draft, giving a speed of from xo·5 to I3 knots at sea. She is fitted with all the appliances and conveniences of a first-class steamer of her size. I took command on June 1, 1899, and on the 7th ran down to Hampton Roads. The crew numbered 65, all enlisted men from the Navy. In the wardroom, with the exception of the doctor, draftsman, fourth and fifth watch officers, and captain's clerk, there were only Coast Survey officers, consisting of the first, second, and third watch officers, chief engineer, a recorder, and three cadet aids. The first watch officer served as executive officer. The recorder and cadet aids each stood watch with an officer of the deck. It was nof practicable to get the deep-sea sounding apparatus completed ·before sailing and no regular surveying work was contemplated, but it was hoped that more or less information could be collected without interfering with an early arrival at our destina~ion, San Francisco, which was of primary importance. On the morning of June 16 the vessel left Newport News and ran down to Old Point Comfort, where we lay to long enough to send off final telegrams and to pick up the mai.l orderly, who had been sent overland to meet us with the last mail. With a fri;sh northeast wind we then ran out of the capes of Virginia, and at 12·24 p. m. shaped our course for Anugada Pass, with St. Lucia, our first port, straight ahead. In crossing the Gulf Stream that night the opposing wind and current gave us a rather nasty cross sea, but otherwise the run to Sombrero light was very comfortable. The vessel can roll and pitch, but she does it very easily, her heeling angle rarely reaching 15° from the normal, and solid water bas rarely come on deck in the roughest
243

weather, although the spray often made the bridge a very wet berth. It took two or three days for some of the party to overcome seasickness, but before we passed Sombrero light, on the 21st, all hands had reported at mess. The engines and boilers worked admirably, causing us neither trouble nor delay on the whole voyage. The coal taken on at different ports varied greatly in quality, and although every precaution was taken it was not possible to determine with accuracy the amount received. \Vhen under the lee of the island of Guadeloupe, on June 22, finding that we would make Port Castries in the night. we lay to and made some experiments with the Tanner sounding tubes, for use with the Lord Kelvin sounding machine. The results were highly satisfactory, and we have since made use of them in the regular work between 20 and 100 fathoms, where their results are sufficiently accurate and the method much more expeditious than with the hand lead. At Port Castries, on the island of St. Lucia, which, by running at half speed all night, we reached at 6·30 a. m. on the morning of the 23d, we overhauled the machinery and blew down and filled the boilers with fresh water. We lay alongside of the pier to coal the ship, and the coal was delivered by women, who carried it on their heads in flat baskets, of about 100 pounds capacity, a continuous line of them passing on at one gangway and off at the other, each woman receiving a tally check from the quartermaster stationed at the gangway as she came on board. At short intervals three or four women were stopped and their loads were weighed, from which a mean weight was deduced. By this method we took on 115 tons in about two and one-half hours. It is a very quick method when a regular chute is not available. We sailed at noon on Sunday the 25th, and it had been the intention to go direct to Bahia, but yellow fever was raging there and I decided to run to Pernambuco. When leaving Port Castries the wind and sea were moderate from the east-southeast, but after passing the Barbados the sea was heavy enough to give us a motion of over 20°. The following day the wind and sea were dead ahead, and we had an opportunity to learn what a short ship could do at pitching. The set of the current north of Cape St. Roque was strong from the west. We heade<l to the ,eastward to give the cape a good berth, and on the morning of the 5th squared away· for Pernambuco, where we arrived on the morning of the 6th, after running at half speed all night. The captain of the port was very"courteous, and obtained for me from the authorities at Rio permission to make magnetic observations. This I had applied for through our consul, and I had also brought up the subject when making an official call. The delay, however, was great, and this, together with almost constant rain, prevented our accomplishing all that was desirable. Leaving Pernambuco on the evening of the 11th, we entered the magnificent harbor of Rio on the morning of the 16th (Sunday). There were a large numh<:r of war vessels at anchor, but none flying the American flag. While at Rio, where we remained until the 22d, we took advantage of the arrival of Mr. Buchanan, our representative at Argentina, to make a circuit of the bay with Minister Bryan and a party. Its navigation is quite easy, the charts good, and the scenery, like the harbor, is magnificent. Leaving Rio on the 22d, we soon ran out of the rainy weather into the cooler climate and pamperos of Montevideo. This beautiful city was in gala dress to receive

General Roca, who arrived on August 3. All the ships were gay with bunting during the day, and with electric lights at night, leaving an agreeable picture of our last sight of civilization, as on the following morning we took our departure for the Straits of Magellan. At 7. 30 a. m. we got under way from the inner anchorage with a light head wind and smooth sea and stood over for Cape Antonio, whence we shaped our course for Cape Virgins, regulating our speed so as to enter the straits with a fair tide, which we did at 7 a. m. on the 9th. Passing south of Nassau Rock we ran in past the excellent light recently completed on Dungeness, and anchored at noon 5 miles west of Possession Point, in ro fathoms of water. At 6.40 a. m., on the 10th, the wind still from the north and east, with a mist obscuring the shores to the west and south, we steamed cautiously to the southwest. Cape {)range was sighted shortly after passing the Narrows Bank, and when abreast of Plumper Anchorage, Direction Hill was sighted. A wrecker was at work on a stranded steamer on Delgada Point, and as we passed through the First Narrows with a fair tide the wreck of one of the Grace Company's steamers was seen on the port hand. The mist clearing away, we sighted the buoy on Triton Bank, ran through the Second Narrows and Queen Channel, and entered Broad Reach before the turni~g tide had gained much force. The wind by this time was strong from the eastward, and as a landing at Point Arenas was impossible we kept on and anchored for the night in Freshwater Bay, 11 fathoms, hard bottom. The region passed through during the day was decidedly uninteresting. As one enters the straits a single cattle ranch near Cape Virgins is seen, looking mean and desolate on the almost barren shingle. Possession Bay is a broad arm of the sea, the land being low and flat on the south, with bluff banks on the north and west, excepting the low point at Dungeness rising gradually inland, where at a few miles it culminates in rounded hills of moderate elevation. At Delgada Point there is a small bleak-looking settlement, and after passing the First Narrows an occasional isolated ranch house is seen on the treeless shores. As one approaches Point Arenas a scanty tree growth appears with occas~onal evidences of civilization. Point Arenas, or Sandy Point, is a straggling settlement of some size but scant attractions. The 11th was typical straits weather, the wind still fresh from the eastward, bringing fog, rain, and snow, with clearer intervals. At 6 a. m. we got under way, rounded Cape Froward and ran up the English Channel, and at 2.28 p. m. anchored in Borja Bay,_ with 20 fathoms. Here were first found the boards posted on trees, giving names and dates when different vessels had used the harbor, and which were found at most of the anchorages from here 011 through the channels. We were under way at 6.30 a. m. on the 12th, and steamed through Long and Sea Reaches, passing Tomar Island at noon. The weather was bright and cold, with a strong northerly wind and steady barometer when we headed up for Smyth Channel, and at 4.45 p. m. let go in 22 fathoms of water in Isthmus Bay. On the 13th we ran to Wide Bay, and on the 14th anchored for the night in 13 fathoms of water outside of Lucas Cove. An examination was made of English Narrows, in order to know when the tide would serve, for the swift current that sweeps through this narrow and crooked channel is the greatest danger in these passages, aside from the rainy, foggy straits weather, of which we, however, had no personal experience. We passed through on the turn of the tide, at 7 a. m., taking the shorter and

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT; 1900.

straighter course, east of Midchannel Island. A buoy on the point of the shoal making out from Cedar Point made this quite practicable. In place of the bright weather that we had since leaving Borja Bay, on this day it was overcast, fog hung about the mountains on either side and light rain or mist fell at times, but not enough to interfere with the navigation of the ship. Before noon we cleared the channels and anchored in Port Ballenas, in 26 fathoms of water. The weather in the Straits of Magellen and in the Chilean. passages is generally so unfavorable, the anchorages are so few and limited in extent, and the region so far removed from civilized centers, that it is most famous for its dangers and discomforts; yet, for grandeur and picturesqueness its scenery has probably few rivals. After rounding Froward the passage is through a succession of partially sulm1erged mountain gorges; the depths are great, and the mountains, clothed at their lower levels with a thick growth of stunted trees and above ending in snow-capped peaks, rise for thousands of feet directly from the water's edge on either hand, while up lateral valleys can be seen the blue and wrinkled glaciers which fill them. Great credit is due to the officers of different nations, who have under such adverse circumstances given us such excellent charts of this inhospitable region. Through the straits and in som1= portions of the channels they are all that could be desired; but in the latter most of the topographic work is entirely lacking in character. The shore line is for the most part fairly good, and the natural features are so bold that navigation is very easy when they are recognized. Unfortunately the draftsman has not done his work in a manner to display this. A better chart of the English Narrows and its approaches, especially at the north end, is very much needed. As the work could be done only at slack water and would have consumed several days, I did not feel authorized to stop to make it. Of the natives we saw very little. A few columns of smoke here and there suggested their presence on shore, and one boat load of squalid men, women, and children waylaid us to beg for tobacco. The men wore remnants of shirts which covered parts of their arms and a short distance below the shoulders. A hag-like old woman had a square of matting secured about the neck by a string, leaving the whole of her parchment-covered skeleton exposed, save a small section of her back. One younger woman there was in the rudely constructed craft who was completely clothed, but the children who emerged from time to time from among the litter in the bottom of the boat, were' entirely nude. When one remembers that this was in 50° south latitude, and that great cakes 'of ice were floating in the water, and, moreover, that these people were probably dressed more elaborately than usual, their indifference to cold is surprising. There was little animal life. Occasionally the head of a hair-seal would appear above the water for a moment, and one or two were seen sunning themselves on the rocks. Near the head of the Chasm Reach we passed a flock of penguins. There were a few wild geese, among which the kelp goose alone was recognized. All are said to be unfit for table use. A few lonely looking ducks were also seen. Before entering the straits, and again near the Bay of Pines a few albatross came about the vessel, and a flock of cape pigeons bore us company from Isle Monte as far as Callao, when they left us, probably to escort some southbound vessel to lower latitudes. The temperature ranged from 34 ° to 50° F., with a mean of say 40°. At midday

on August 16 we passed Isle Monte and steered northward. There were evidences of recent heavy weather, but the sea went down the following day, and on the afternoon of the 20th we went into Valparaiso, where we stopped only long enough to get letters. The storm which we had just escaped had been very severe here, and the streets were all but impassable from the mud washed down from the hills, while the water front had suffered severely from the heavy sea. The run to Callao, where we arrived on the 25th, was uneventful, but as the 4 ooo miles steaming from Montevideo" had nearly exhausted our coal supply, we remained here long enough to fill the bunkers. While this was being taken on board and the storerooms were being replenished, as many of the officers as could be spared from duty went into the interior, visiting Lima and taking a trip across the mountains. Unfortunately the railroad was not completed to the point where the revolution was active the day we went up, and we made so early a start the next morning on our return that we missed, by a few hours, a very one-sided engagement at the summit of -the Pass, the troops on their way up passing us at our breakfast station as we came down. Leaving Callao on August 30, we steamed north with light airs and a smooth sea. On crossing the line in the Atlantic, "Neptune," in the person of the largest and laziest sailor in the forecastle, accompanied by " Amphitrite," a comical little salt with a brogue as liquid as her husband's empire, with other familias, all grotesquely attired, and bearing emblems of their several offices, came on board and initiated his new subjects with all the ancient rites. In the neighborhood of the Galapagos, which gave warrant for the name, quantities of turtle were seen floating on the water, a score of which were added to our larder. The men went alongside of them in a small boat, seized them by the flipper, and turning them over, deftly hauled them inboard. Throughout the voyage the machinery had worked perfectly, the weather· had been propitious, violent storms had been reported by vessels just preceding or immediately following us, all of which we had escaped, and nothing happened to mar what was possibly one of the most satisfactory trips ever made over the same ground. On the evening of September .13, however, when off the coast of southern California, the doctor reported that he suspected appendicitis in the case of Cadet Aid James J. Sylvester, who had been suffering more or less with abdominal pains since morning. The course was at once changed to San Diego, which the vessel reached the following evening. The next day ~e was sent ashore to the sanitarium at Coronado, and on the morning of the 16th an operation was performed, terminating fatally. The loss of this -plucky little fellow, who was a universal favorite, cast a shadow over the whole ship's company and robbed our return to home waters of the pleasure that we had anticipated. While at quarters on Sunday, the 17th, when abreast Point Pinos, an object was sighted through the mist a mile and a half inshore, the nature of which we could not at that time determine, but which it was later concluded must have been the great timber raft. reported adrift somewhere near the entrance to San Francisco. The suspicion was reported upon our arrival, and led to the recovery and removal of that menace to navigation. We entered the Golden Gf1te that afternoon in a fog, and anchored off the city. Certain improvements and alterations were suggested by our experience, and these, together with haulin'g out, cleaning bottom, and a few minor items of repair were

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

authorized. Specifications were then prepared and bids asked for. The great amount of work on hand at all the shops and yards, occasioned by the great emergency calls on the part of the army transport service, and those employed in freight carrying more or less directly connected with or growing out of that service, made it hard to get bids. After much annoying delay, however, the work was taken in hand and on the 17th of November the vessel was ready for sea. The Coast Survey expenses of the steamer from the time of leaving Washington until she reached San Francisco (exclusive of all pay except of cadets), and inclusive of putting her in as good condition as when-she started was, in round numbers, $8 ooo, or, say, 55 cents per nautical mile. Of this 75 per ce1,1t was for coal.

At Pernambuco, Montevideo, and Callao we coaled from lighters, the coal being passed aboard in baskets, occupying about two days at each place. As the coal bill is the largest item of expense, the inferior quality (mostly Welsh) and the scant weights add greatly to the expense of a voyage in these waters. Recorder H. H. Pritchett made magnetic observations, and, assisted by the third and fourth watch officers (Atkinson and McGrath), obtained results for declination, dip, and intensity at Port Castries, Pernambuco, and Callao. These observations were made while the vessel was taking on coal-the time was always short and it was not always practicable to make full sets. It was a source of great disappointment that observations could not be made at other points. Tidal and current observations were also impracticable, but by the courtesy of Dr. Saboia, chefe da commissao de melhoramento do Porto de Pernambuco, I procured a tracing of one month's curve at that place, and information which I hope may lead to our obtaining data at a number of other ports in Brazil. The establishment of agencies for the sale of our charts I did not find practicable. The number of local charts of the United States called for by vessels touching at South American ports is very small, and as the United States Hydrographic Office furnishes our charts to their agents the demand is amply supplied. At midday on November 22, with full bunkers and storerooms, and a supply of instruments suitable for the anticipated work in the Hawaiian Islands, we started for Honolulu. A heavy sea was making on the bar through which we passed, and the vessel pitched heavily, but without taking on water. Outside the wind was contrary and the water rough, and for a week we steamed into a head sea with a gale in our teeth, but as the islands were approached we met the fine weather common to that region, and shortly after noon on the 2d of December entered the harbor of Honolulu and moored ship.

PERKINS: MAN~LA, P. I.
SPECIAL DUTY.

During the month of March, 1900, Assistant Perkins, who was in command of the Pathfinder, engaged in hydrographic and topographic work in the Hawaiian Islands, received instructions to proceed to Manila and report upon the conditions in that section bearing upon the work of the survey. He sailed on the 30th of March from Honolulu, took a month's leave of absence without pay, which was spent in Japan and China, and reached Manila on the 4th of June. From this time until the 15th of July he was actively engaged, investigating the different conditions and collecting all available information as to the means of prosecuting work in the Philippine Islands similar to that carried on by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. During his stay and on the way back, which was by way of Yokohama and San Francisco, numerous letters were written to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, giving such information as had been obtained. From these letters and preliminary reports the following statements have been briefly summarized: On account of the revival of business, which makes the interisland traffic very profitable, vessels of any kind are very difficult to secure, and even the Army and Navy are unable to obtain the small vessels that they require for light work in shoal water. Such vessels, however, could be bought or built at Hongkong, where the quality of the work and material is better, and the cost of material much less than at Manila. The charge for docking vessels at Hongkong is about half what it is in San Francisco, and material is about the same price as on the western coast of the United States. On the whole, repairs can be made there as well as in the United States, and for somewhat less money. Coal can at present (August, 1900) be bought at Manila at about the following prices: Cardiff, $25 per ton; Australian, $20 per. ton; Japanese, $16 per ton. The average supply of coal in private hands is stated to be about 16 ooo tons. The larger buildings in Manila are well adapted for use as offices, and for the needs of draftsmen, engravers, etc. The observatory of the Jesuit Fathers has a very complete and well-selected instrumental outfit in both the seismic and meteorological departments. It has also a new equatorial and a good transit. The observations carried on there are continuous. Time signals are sent over the wires each day to all sections, and systematic observations of latitude are to be shortly begun. A small printing and lithographing plant is established in the observatory. There exists also at Manila the lithographic establishment of Chofre & Co., which has been in operation for twenty years. The main building is about 80 by 100 feet.

They have roller presses, compositors' rooms, etc. The engines for running the plant are in duplicate and are run, alternating, a month each. Their steam planer is large enough for any size stone, and they have two good mills for grinding ink. The maximum size stones for which the presses are adapted is 65 by 95 centimeters, though there are only a few stones of that size. There is a large supply of stone on hand, but most of them are small. All .the employees are Filipinos, with the exception of the manager or general foreman. The telegraphic system extends all over the northern and western coasts of the island of Luzon and to many islands to the southward, and within a year it is estimated that all the islands will be connected with the capitol. The war has necessitated the construction of numerous telegraph lines, both land and cable, in addition to those operated by private firms. Astronomic and hydrographic surveys of the east coast of Luzon and from Aponi east and south to San Bernardino are said to have been made by Capt. Juan de la Concha. They have not been published. Early tidal records extending back a number of years were found at the office of the captain of the port. These have been sent to the Hydrographic Office at Washington. A magnetic survey of the group and the adjacent coasts of China has been made by the Jesuits. The stations, however, were not marked nor described, so as to be available for future occupation, except at Manila, where :3ystematic observations have been conducted for some ten years. No records or instruments of value in the work of the survey appear to have been left by the Spaniards, though a few instruments evidently not considered worth sending away were found. The existing charts are very defective, the errors amounting in some cases to as much as 10 or 15 miles in relative positions. Such conditions, of course, make the navigation of these waters extremely dangerous, and emphasize the necessity of beginning as soon as possible an accurate and systematic survey of the group. In view of the above, Assistant Perkins suggests the following plan for future work in the islands: ( 1) Longitudes.-Advantage should be taken at once of the excellent telegraphic facilities, and as many astronomic parties as can be put in the field should be detailed with instructions to determine the position of as many points as possible. (2) Tides.-As the astronomic work will practically be confined to coast points, tide observations could advantageously be made by these parties. Self-registering tide gauges should be maintained at Manila and at other important points. (3) Triangulati'on.-More or less triangulation will be required, although the plane table should be used in making the preliminary surveys, except in the case of large bodies of water like Manila Bay. (4) Topography and hydrography.-Itwill of necessity be some time before detailed topography can be done, but the plane table will be in constant requisition. The most satisfactory way of making a rapid preliminary survey of sufficient accuracy will be as follows: Upon reaching a harbor or region to be surveyed all available boats should l;>e sent out to flag the coast. At the same time a tide gauge should be erected and observations cpmmenced. A plane-table party should be organized and the shore line should be run and the flags and signals determined. One of the plane-table stations should be a previously established astronomic station, or should be occupied for an azimuth on

APPENDIX NO.

the sun, and time and latitude should be observed. If an officer is available for the purpose, magnetic observations should be commenced at the same time. So soon as four or five signals or flags have been erected the hydrographic boats should commence work without boat sheets. The plane table can give from 4 to 6 or more miles of such shore line in a full day, so that the boat sheets for that section should be ready the second day. The hydrography of the previous day can be put on them and systematic work continued. Peaks and objects in the background of value to the navigator and outside the limits of the topographic sheet should be determined with the theodolite from bases furnished by the topography. The best time for work is from November till May, but the other half of the year can be used for the surveys on the eastern coasts.

OGDEN: OCCUPATION DURING THE YEAR OF THE VESSELS OF THE COAST SURVEY. CONDENSED STATEMENT.

The steamer Patly1nder sailed from Washington for San Francisco about the middle of June. She arrived on the 17th of September. After being docked and overhauled at the last-named place, she proceeded to the Hawaiian Islands on November 30, where she was engaged upon surveys and examinations until the end of March. At the end of this time she returned to Seattle, and after being docked for some minor repairs sailed for St. Michael early in June. ~he was engaged in work in Bering Sea at the end of the year. The steamer Patterson sailed during the month of June from San Francisco to engage in hydrography in Alaskan waters. During the season she developed the outer edge of the flats off the Yukon Delta, from Cape Romanzof to St. Michael, besides making a careful hydrographic examination of Golofnin Bay and some other points on the north shore of Norton Sound. She returned to Seattle in the fall, where, on account of a collision with the ferryboat City of Seattle while at anchor, she was practically under repairs during the whole wipter. Late in June she sailed again for Bering Sea, her work being projected for this season to extend northward as far as Port Clarence. The steamer Blake returned from Porto Rico in June, 1899. She sailed shortly afterwards for Boston, where a preliminary examination was made by the United States local inspectors to determine her condition and seaworthiness. 'l'he report ot the inspectors indicated that considerable repairs would be required, but they were unable to make any positive recommendations until they should have an opportunity to open her out and find by actual sight the condition of her timbers. It was decided, however, that she should execute, immediately, on Nantucket Shoals, and especially on the Pollock Rip Slough, some work called for by the Light-House Establishment. While making this examination the position of the Nantucket Shoal light ship was determined, wit~ a view of verifying the location of some of the shoal soundings that had been obtained by the U. S.S. New York. After completing this work she returned to Boston and made a thorough examination for some ledges which had been reported by the captain of a Cunard steamer. She was then put in dry dock, and, an examination being made, the frames and bull generally were found to be in good condition. The fashion timber and cant frames were badly decayed, and it was determined that they should be removed before the vessel should again proceed on an extensive voyage. She was subsequently ordered to Baltimore and put on the railway at Spedden's shipyard, where the necessary repairs were made. She sailed for Porto Rico in Februai:y and remained there until the close of the year. The steamer Bache was engaged during the summer months on the hydrography of Eastern Bay, Maryland, in connection with a shore party which was executing triangulation and topography in that locality. During the winter months she was laid up at

Baltimore, and such slight repairs as were required to keep her in condition for work in Chesapeake Bay were made by the ship's complemen:t. She left dock in ~fay, and during the balance of the year was engaged in erecting signals in the lower bay for use in completing the triangulation necessg:ry for a hydrographic survey in that locality. The steamer Gedney sailed from San Francisco early in July, bound for Chatham Strait, Alaska. She touched at Seattle on the way. During the season, which was necessarily short, she connected the triangulation with that which had been previously executed in Sumner Strait. On the return of the vessel to Seattle a careful survey of Rich's Passage and the approaches to Puget Sound Naval Station was made. This was completed early in May. A careful inspection of the vessel was made at this time, and it was found that extensive repairs would have to be made before she was in a condition to again resume work in Alaska. These repairs were undertaken during the month of June, and were ui1der way at the close of the year. The steamer McArthur was in the hands of the Union Iron Works, at San Francisco, at the beginning of the year. The repairs were completed in July, and the ship was placed in ordinary in Oakland Creek. She resumed work in the vicinity of Brocks Island in October, and late in the season made a resurvey of San Francisco.Bar. The steamer Endeavor established a mile trial course for the Navy Department in the vicinity of Cape Charles City during the month of July. She was then assigned to the Coast Pilot party for the verification, in the field, of a new edition of the Coast Pilot embracing Long Island Sound, New York. Returning to Chesapeake Bay in September, she resumed the hydrographic survey of Sassafras River and other work in the vicinity of Pooles Island. During the winter months she was laid up in Baltimore, and in the spring was assigned to hydrographic work in the Delaware River to determine the best water for deep-draft vessels above Bombay Creek. She was engaged upon this work at the close of the year. During the time from the 1st of July until the close of the season the Yukon was engaged at the mouth of the Yukon River. She remained at St. Michael during the winter, and in the following spring was assigned to the Patlzjinder as a tender for her season's work in Bering Sea. The steamer Taku was employed also in the Yukon Delta and was towed to Dutch Harbor by the Patterson on her return from the season's work in the fall of 1899. In the spring of the following year she was assigned to the party to operate in Prince William Sound. She was successfully towed there from Dutch Harbor under contract. The schooner Eagre was ordered, in July, to New York, in order to make a survey at the request of the Navy Department in the vicinity of the Battery and Governors Island. On completing this work the Eagre was docked in the Erie Basin, and was opened out by removing a strake all around the vessel above the water line. As it was determined to send the schooner to Porto Rico during the following winter, extensive repairs were found necessary, and proposals were obtained for rearranging the quarters in the ship as well. The vessel was subsequently ordered to Baltimore and put in the hands of Woodall & Co., where the required repairs were made. She sailed for San Juan in January and returned to Baltimore during .the month of June. At the beginning of the.year the schooner Matckless was engaged on a hydrographic survey of Chesapeake Bay, including the Susquehanna River and Northeast River. Upon the completion of this work she proceeded to Elk River and finished the survey

254

of that stream and the Bohemian River. She was then overhauled and repaired in September for the cruise to Porto Rico. Very little work was found necessary. She left Baltimore for San Juan in February, and during the remainder of the season was engaged in completing the hydrographic and, topographic survey of that harbor. Leaving there early in June she proceeded to Charleston, S. C., and made a survey of the old main.channel, in compliance with a request from the Light-House Board. She was engaged upon this work when the year closed. The schooners Quz"ck, Trans#, and Spy were not in commission during the year.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE.
In 1893 Prof. George Davidson, Assistant, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, undertook to collect information concerning the early surveys of the eastern boundary of California. His extensive acquaintance with men on the Pacific coast and with the events which have transpired since 18..j.9, from many years residence in San Francisco, and numerous expeditions through the western coast region, gave him great facilities for _obtaining accurate knowledge, and he corresponded with many of the surveyors who had been engaged upon the eastern boundary survey in order to ascertain facts in connection with it. This information, in the shape of letters, was kindly turned over to me by him. While the material concerning work executed less than fifty years ago is not so abundant as might be supposed and some of it is entirely without value, an effort has been made to give an outline of the principal surveys, and to bring together data that may be of future use. The matter here incorporated is limited, principally, to extracts from reports, and to a reproduction on a small scale of such early maps and sketches as could be found. Although it has not been practicable to investigate thoroughly all of the possible sources of information, it is believed that most of the important documents have been examined. In April, 1900, Assistant Frank W. Edmonds, Coast and Geodetic Survey, examined the records in the offices of the United States surveyors-general at San Francisco, Cal., and Reno, Nev., as well as the offices of the State surveyors-general at Sacramento, Cal., and Carson City, Nev., for material bearing upon the early suryeys of this boundary. No trace of the Goddard map could be found, but copies of the map of Houghton & Ives.of 1863, and of the extension of that survey by Lawson & McBride in 1865 were found, and a tracing was made of each. Mr. Edmonds was also able to settle conclusively the fact that a telegraph line ran from San Francisco to Sacramento and Placerville, and thence, via Lake Valley and Genoa, to Carson City, so it is presumed that Lieutenant Ives, who made observations for latitude and longitude in Lake Valley at the south end of. Lake Tahoe in r 86 l, utilized this wire for longitude, as there was a telegraph office at the Lake House, which was very close to his astronomic station near the lake shore. Nothing could be found relating to the work executed by Lieutenant Ives in 1861 except the allusion to it by Mr. Houghton, surveyor-general, California (Rep. for 1863, pp. 36-37), in which he states that the ''field notes and topographic maps'' of Lieutenant Ives were delivered to him for examination; that both initial points were determined by Lieutenant Ives, and that the Colorado terminus was marked in three places as 114 ° 36'. The sketch which shows the river as it was in 1861, is believed to have been copied from the map of Lieutenant Ives. The Coast and Geodetic Survey Office was drawn upon for computation of the geodetk line, geographic positions, etc. Assistant W. B. Fairfield prepared nearly all of the tabulation, description of stations, and computation of heights. Assistants Baldwin, Nelson, Flynn, Edmonds, and McGrath rendered valuable aid in the computations. 257 S. Doc. 68--17

THE OBLIQUE BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA.

I. FORMATION OF CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA.

After the Mexican war a large territory was ceded to the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, February 2, 1848. A portion of this territory was formed into the State of California September 9, 1850. Its limits, in part, as defined by the State constitution, are as follows:
Commencing at the point of intersection of the forty-second degree of north latitude with the · one hundred and twentieth degree of longitude west from Greenwich and running south on the line of said one hundred and twentieth degree of west longitude until it intersects the thirty-ninth degree of north latitude; thence running in a straight line in a southeasterly direction to the river Colorado, at a point where it intersects the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude; * * *

The above defines the eastern boundary of the State, but this report only treats of the oblique portion of the eastern ·boundary-namely, that which is included between the intersection of the thirty-ninth degree of latitude with the one hundred and . twentieth meridian and the thirty-fifth degree of latitude with the center of the Colorado River. Utah was organized as a territory, also, on September 9, 1850, from a portion of the Mexican cession. Its western boundary was· made to conform to the eastern boundary of California. Nevada Territory was formed from Utah Territory on March 2, 1861. It became a State October 31, 1864. Several additions were made to its area before it reached its present dimensions. Its western boundary was made to conform to the eastern boundary of California. Only the oblique portion of this boundary was retraced by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. II. EARLY SURVEYS BEARING ON THE CALIFORNIA. EASTERN BOUNDARY OF

A. SITGREA VES, I852.

In 1852 Capt. Lorenzo Sitgreaves, United States Topographical Engineer, reached the Colorado River of the West. His sketch of the river and his report are published in Executive Document No. 59, Thirty-second Congress, second session. His nearest camp to the present Camp Mohave was No. 33. One day's march north of this, at
263

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

No. 32, observations were made for latitude and longitude. The latitude is given as 35° 08' 55".4, longitude 114° 39' 27". From the sketch it will be seen that the longitude of Camp No. 33 is nearly the same as that of No. 32, on the east bank of the river. The California oblique boundary is shown on the sketch, but it is not prolonged to the river; its prolongation would intersect the thirty-fifth parallel of latitude in longitude 114° 40', very nearly. This topographic sketch is on a scale of 10 miles to the inch and the topography is too general to -be of value here, but -it has an historic interest because Mr. G. H. Goddard used Sitgreaves's longitude ( 114 ° 40') of the Colorado terminus to compute the oblique line from Lake Tahoe (Bigler) to the Colorado River.

GODDARD, I855.

INSTRUCTIONS OF SURVEYOR-GENERAL MARLETTE.

The following .extracts are made from the '' Report of a survey of a portion of the eastern boundary of California and of a reconnaissance of the old Carson and Johnson immigrant roads over the Sierra Nevada, by George H. Goddard, civil engineer.''
SURVEYOR-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Sacramento, August 3, I855.
As you are now provided with the necessary men, animals, and instruments, you will proceed without delay to Placerville, en route for Carson Valley. * 'f * At or near Carson Valley you will determine, astronomically, with some precision, the position of the eastent boundary of the State; and I would suggest that such portion of the State line as shall fall in Carson Valley, or so much of it as you may deem necessary, be measured and defined with tolerable accuracy. * * * Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
SIR:

S. H. MARLETTE, Surveyor-General. GEo. H. GODDARD, Esq., Civil Engineer, etc.
INSTRUMENTS.

( 1) An altitude and azimuth instrument, by Parkinson & Frodsham, of London; 12-inch horizontal circle, divided to 10' and reading to 1o''; 16-inch vertical circle, divided to s' and reading to 5"; telescope, 4-foot focal length, 3-inch objective, 2 eyepieces, 120 and 180 diameters. The instrument was supported on a central pillar, and the telescope revolved at one extremity of its axis, by which it was more adapted to astronomic than to geodetic purposes. ( 2) A very fine 6 ~-inch theodolite, of English make and usual construction. (3) One large chronometer, by Dent, London, No. 1946. (4) One small chronometer, by Parkinson & Frodsham, London, No. 1628. Also, a cistern barometer and an aneroid barometer; a sextant and two artificial horizons.

LAKE BIGLER (TAHOE) ASTRONOMIC STATION.

"Bigler Lake is a noble sheet of water from IS to 20 miles in length by 6 to 7 in width. We arrived at its shore at dusk and camped at the point of timber which forms the eastern boundary of the swamps on the southern end of the lake. "September r5.-I went along the beach of the lake to the mouth of the Truckee River. This beach is a strip of firm, solid ground inclosing the swampy fiats. I selected a favorable -site for our

APPENDIX NO. 3.

BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA.

265

astronomical station. * * *. It was near the mouth of the river and sufficiently far from the timber to prevent its interrupting our view. I had a block cut and prepared for the instrument. * * *· "September 16.-Had a raft made, and floated the block half a mile along the lake shore to the place chosen yesterday. * * * "September 18.-* * * In the afternoon crossed the Truckee on our raft and went to the point of timber on the western side of the flats, from which I took bearings on our tent and the flag on the granite hlock. * * *-(Goddard's report, p. II2.)" "September 21.-* * * The continued bad weather bad prevented my getting the observations I most desired at this camp; still, considering the means I had at my disposal, the result of the survey had been satisfactory, and its main object attained. The position now of the boundary line between Eldorado County and Carson Valley was detennined with a very small amount of error, and it only remained to carry that line over the mountains to see exactly where it would fall in the valley. ''Previous to doing this, however, the observations had to be recomputed with the corrected result already obtained, and on that being done a monument should be erected at the point where the boundary leaves the lake, and a station fixed in line therewith on the summit of the ridge above Carson Valley. As this, however, could not be done before the office work required in the first instance was completed, I concluded that it would answer all present purposes to connect Carson Valley with the survey and locate the several settlements there, so that when the map of the entire work was completed the boundary line could be drawn thereon with accuracy, leaving the tracing it off on the ground to a future occasion. (Same, p. 115. )" 3. LONGITUDE, LATITUDE, AND AZIMUTH OF THE OBLIQUE BOUNDARY.

The latitude and longitude of this camp, by a mean of our best observations, is latitude 38° 57' or"; longitude rr9° 58' 02", and its altitude above the sea 5,850 feet. The initial point formed by the intersection of the th~rty-ninth parallel with the one hundred and twentieth meridian is therefore 4 miles distant from the camp, on an azimuth of 30° 301 west of true north. Assuming the longitude given by Capt. L. Sitgreaves, United States topographical engineer, of the point where the Colorado River crosses the thirty-fifth parallel as r14° 4o', the boundary line will form part of a great circle uniting these two points, and at the thirty-ninth parallel and one hundred and twentieth meridian the line will make a spherical angle with the meridian of S. 48° 25 1 55 11 E., and at the junction of the rr4° 401 meridian and thirty-fifth parallel of N. 45° 13 1 05 11 W.

LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE, SOUTH END OF LAKE TAHOE.

In 1861, Lieut. Joseph C. Ives, under direction of the Department of the Interior, made observations for latitude and longitude at the south end of Lake Tahoe to focate the northwest terminus of the oblique boundary of California. These observations were completed .and he reported to the Secretary of the Interior under date of August 30,

1861, that the.field astronomic duty was completed, and it only remained after the computations were made to run the line, which any surveyor could accomplish. Finally, on the 11th September, 1861, Lieutenant Ives, pursuant to instructions from the Department, turned over to the United States surveyor-general's office (California) the field notes, maps, reports, and computations of the astronomic observations which had been taken. (See Annual Report General Land Office, 1865, pp. 13, 14.) These field notes, maps, etc., were in the office of the surveyor-general of California (E. F. Beale) in 1863, and were examined by Mr. J. F. Houghton. I have no evidence as to when the work on the Colorado River at latitude 35° was executed; but presumably in 1861, from reference to it by Mr. Houghton. No one knows what became of these maps, etc., of Lieutenant Ives; letters were written to Mr. Houghton, who examined them personally, to the United States surveyors-general of California and of Nevada; to the surveyors-general of the same States, and to the General Land Office, Washington, D. C., and finally Assitant F. W. Edmonds searched the offices of the surveyors-general in California and Nevada·in vain. Although the legislature of Nevada authorized the governor to have the boundary between California and Nevada established from Lake Bigler (Tahoe) as far southeast as Esmeralda, by act approved November 29, 1861, the following letter from the surveyorgeneral of Nevada shows that nothing was done until 1863:
CARSON CITY, Nav.,

Mr. C. H.

SlNCI.AIR,

United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D. C.
DEAR SIR: In reply to your inquiry of the 16th instant', I beg to state that the Territorial legislature of Nevada, by act approved November 29, 1861, authorized the governor "to have the boundary line between the State of California and the Territory of Nevada surveyed and established from Lake Bigler to below or south of Esmeralda, at as early a day as practicable." One thousand dollars were appropriated for the purpose, but the act provided "that if the State of California shall establish the boundary line before the 1st day of March, 1862, then this act shall be null and void.'' The records do not show that any action was taken by the Territory of Nevada or State of California until 1863, when the line was surveyed from Lake Bigler to Mount Diablo base line in Esmeralda County, Nev.; Butler Ives, commissioner for Nevada; J. F. Houghton, surveyor-general of California; J. F. Kidder, engineer in charge. This is the first survey of the boundary line south of Lake Bigler or Tahoe of which I can find any record. * * * No field work was done under the act of 1861 in 1861, nor, so far as I can ascertain, before 1863. Respectfully, yours, E. D. KEI.I.ltY,

Surveyor-General and State Land Register. D. J. F. HOUGHTON AND BUTLER IVES, r863.

LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE, SOUTH END OF LAKE TAHOE.

The Report Surveyor-General California, 1863, contains the following statement:
"By an act of the legislature approved April 27, 1863,"it was made the duty of the surveyorgeneral of the State to define and establish the entire eastern boundary line of the State by running, measuring, and marking a transit line between the point of intersection of the thirty-ninth parallel of north latitude with the one hundred and twentieth degree of longitude west from Greenwich, near Lake Tahoe and the point where the thirty-fifth degree crosses the Colorado River, as the said points were established by Lieutenant Ives, chief astronomer of the United, States Boundary Commission, appointed for that purpose." * * *

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

Butler Ives, esq., a United States surveyor of experience, was appointed by the acting governor of Nevada, Orion Clemens, as commissioner. Twenty-five thousand dollars were appropriated for running, not only the oblique boundary line to the Colorado, No. 3. but also that portion northward - - - - - - - - - - - - - - . . , . - - - - - - - - - - - - along the one hundred and Oop(Ml IJ.om""' OriiJi.naL Vt tltL orrv. ..-en.~ . .,.,,.,,,,,~·G·ne,.ai,s,,,,,,,,-. twentieth meridian from the thirty-ninth parallel to the Oregon boundary, latitude 42 °. Mr. John F. Kidder, an engineer and surveyor of large experience, was engaged as engineer in chief, and Mr. James S. Lawson as compassman and topographer. The report further states:
"Immediately upon the passage of the act above referred to, appreciating the importance of having the , position of the initial point at Lake Tahoe definitely determined as a starting point and anxious to avoid the delay and expense of establishing an observatory to determine longitude, I took the latitude and longitude of Lieutenant Ives's observatory at the south end of Lake Tahoe as determined by himself, making, myself, test observations for latitude, which agreed to seconds with those made by him. As no report has been published of his field work and computations, and as some doubt has been expressed as to whether Lieutenant Ives ever reduced his observations so as to determine the initial points at the lake and 011 the Colorado, I will here furnish the evidence I have been able to obtain, that they were so detennined by himself.

"While the bill providing for the survey was pending before the legislature, through the courtesy of United States surveyor-general, E. F. Beale, esq., the entire field notes, topographical maps, etc., connected with the observations of Lieutenant Ives, which were in his possession, were delivered to rue for examination. "I found the notes of a long series of observations at his observatory near Lake Tahoe, extending over some months of time, with the latitude of the observatory, taken by sextant and sidereal clock, computed and carried out as north latitude 38° 56 1 47 11 ·52. " Observations were made by myself, and the latitude computed, which differed only in seconds from that of Lieutenant Ives, and his results were used in the survey as correct. "A careful search for his reduction of his observations for longitude resulted * * * in a failure to find them among his notes. (Same, p. 36.)"

In 1861 the Territorial legislature of Nevada authorized the governor to have the boundary line run from Lake Tahoe as far southeast as Esmeralda to determine the position of Aurora with reference to the boundary line.
3. LONGITUDE RESULTS OF LIEUTENANT IVES AT LAKE TAHOE AND THE COLORADO RIVER.

''In order to establish the initial point at Lake Tahoe, which was necessary before the work could proceed, Mr. Kidder placed himself in communication with Lieutenant Ives, then at work at his observatory in Lake Valley, who in his answer, dated August 28, 1861, says: "I trust our observations this week will give us our longitude with reference to San Francisco." And fourteen days later he telegraphed from San Francisco, September rr, 1861, to Mr. Kidder as follows:" Approximate longitude of station is seven hours fifty-nine minutes and fifty-three seconds west of Greenwich,'' all of which correspondence and telegrams are in my possession, on file in this office. . "The initial point on the Colorado River is by act of Congress admitting the State of California into the Union where the thirty-fifth parallel crosses the Colorado, which is marked in tlzree different places upon tlze topograpliicalfield books and maps accompanying Lieutenfl.nt Ives's survey as u4° 36' west from Greenwich, at which place a monument was placed, distant about 2 miles from Fort Mojave. (Report Surveyor-General California, 1863, p. 36. )"

The azimuth of the line was computed at the Office of the United States Coast Survey. The oblique line was run 102 miles and 46 chains southeast from Lake Tahoe beyond Aurora nearly to the White Mountains, where Indians and the approach of winter put a stop to the field work. No work was executed at the Colorado River end of the line, as it was evidently the intention to trace the line through from Lake Tahoe to the terminus located by Lieutenant Ives on the Colorado, and correct back. A copy of the map showing this survey on a scale of 6 miles to the inch is in the office of the surveyor-general of Nevada, at Carson City. A tracing was made for the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, where it is on file. This map is shown here, on a reduced scale, on the same sheet with the map of the continuation of the boundary survey, for a distance of 73 miles l l ·92 chains, in 1865, by William McBride, engineer, and James S. Lawson, commissioner, of Nevada.
INSTRUMENTS.

For astronomic work an alt-azimuth by Parkinson and Frodsham, of London, with a 12-inch horizontal circle reading to ten seconds and 16-inch vertical circle reading to five seconds, telescope 4 feet focal length, was used. This is probably the instrument used by Goddard in 1855. For ranging out the line a straight-line transit by Temple, of .Boston, a model of superior workmanship, was secured.
4. SOUNDINGS IN LAKE TAHOE ALONG THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTIETH MERIDIAN.

The average depth of 21 soundings taken on the one hundred and twentieth meridian is 934·24 feet; that of 12 soundings extending over a distance of 12 consecutive miles, exclusive of 3 on the north and 6 on the south shore, isl 424·6 feet. The greatest depth reached was l 523 feet. The deep soundings invariably show the bottom to be composed of .fine, impalpable mud, except one made some 3 miles from the north shore, where the lead was bruised upon a rocky bottom at a depth of l 242 feet. The shoal soundings gave a bottom of sand, or sand, gravel, and bowlders. Its waters are transparent, and abound in the finest quality of lake trout. Its outlet is the Truckee River, which at the

270

point where it debouches from the lake has a capacity equal to a current 4 feet deep by 6o in width moving at the rate of 3 miles per hour. It is fed by numerous streams from the surrounding mountains, many of whose highest peaks are covered with perpetual snow. Its shores for the greater part are bold and rocky, alternating with sand and shingle beaches in the more sheltered places.' (Report Surveyor-General California, 1863, p. 54.)

This line was a prolongation of the line run by Houghton and Ives in 1863. James S. Lawson was appointed commissioner by the governor of Nevada under the act of February 7, 1865, amended March 10, 1865, these being the dates of approval by the legislature. The commissioner was directed to survey and establish the western boundary line of the State of Nevada for a distance of 70 miles from the point where the same had been suspended by the joint commission from the State of California and the Territory of Nevada in 1863. He says:
"I engaged the services of William McBride, a thorough and competent surveyor and engineer, at the maximum rate allowed, to wit, $45 per mile. * * * On the 1st of May we reached the terminus of the California survey, which was readily found, as I had been one of the party comprising that expedition in 1863, and had been upon the ground again in 1864 to aid in further securing the points of the line at this place. · · "The monuments and marks were undisturbed, and no difficulty was found in determining the course of the line from the center points established beneath the mounds, as well as from the original stakes, which were still standing, and which were found to coincide with the holes drilled in the rocks. "From these center points the line was continued with a new and carefully adjusted instrument ~of superior make by reversals at each setting upon fore and back sights. * * * "No new observations were necessary in extending the line from the end of the California survey, as those above referred to are believed to be correct, and the fullest assurance is felt of the accuracy of that work in the field; hence _it was deemed advisable to extend the boundary from the points already established. * * * · ''On the 1st of June we had reached the end of the seventieth mile, the limit of the work by the provision of the act authorizing the survey. This point being difficult of access as well as description, I deemed it advisable to continue the line to a more favorable point, which was found upon an isolated ridge of rocks at the head of a valley extending south and eastward at· a distance of 3 miles 11 ·92 chains in advance, and which, being marked by hole in rock and mound of stone, may readily be found from the map and field notes accompanying the report. "Substantial monuments and marks were made at the most conspicuous points, sufficient to define the course of the line and perpetuate it for a long time and until cut-stone or other monuments shall be required.,,

A reproduction of this map, reduced from a tracing, will be found among the illustrations of this report. This map is on the same sheet with the Houghton and Ives survey of 1863, being a prolongation of that survey to the southeast. The original, which is in the surveyor-general's office, was on a scale of 6 miles to the inch. Three thousand four hundred and fifty dollars were appropriated to meet the expenses of this survey.

EXAJlfINATION OF ARCHIVES IN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA BY ASSISTANT F. W. EDMONDS, FOR MATERIAL BEARING ON EARLY SURVEYS.

SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., May 3, I900. S. PRITCHE'l'T, Superintendent United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D. C. SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report upon the work assigned to me by your instructions dated March 24, 1900, to gather data bearing upon the early surveys of the eastern boundary of California, from Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River:

SEARCH FOR NOTES AND MAPS OF LIEUTENANT IVES IN SAN FRANCISCO.

On Monday, April 2, I called upon the United States surveyor-general at Sau Francisco, who immediately ordered a search made through the files of his office for maps and field notes, etc. Nothing was found there but the records of the Von Schmidt survey of 1872-73. While this search was going on I exami.ned the letter books of United States Surveyor-General E. F. Beale, who held office in 1863, and found the following letter addressed to Surveyor-General Houghton, dated March 23 1 1863:
''Yours of the 20th instant duly at hand. I have made careful examination of books and sketches left in my charge by Lieutenant Ives, late of the boundary commission. I find upon his topographical sketches that the initial point is set down as n4° 36' west of Greenwich." "I can find no data referring to Lake Bigler, of the intersection of the thirty-ninth parallel north latitude and the one hundred and twentieth parallel west longitude from Greenwich."

The foregoing letter is doubtless the basis of the following statement, quoted from Surveyor General Houghton's Report for 1863 1 p. 36:
"A careful search for his observations for longitude resulted among his notes.''

*· * *

in a failure to find them

a. Telegraph line .from San Francisco to Placerville, Lake Valley, Genoa, and Carson, t'n I85fJ o; I86o.

I have taken considerable pains to settle, if possible, the question of Lieutenant Ives's longitude observations in Lake Valley, and have corresponded with a number of persons and interviewed others. I here submit the result of my inquiries. In regard to the existence of a telegraph line at that time there is no doubt. I quote the following extracts from letters written to me by Mr. James Gamble, who had charge of the lines of the old California State Telegraph Company:
"I can not give you the exact date of the completion of the first line connecting San Francisco with Carson City without referring to my scrapbook, which is in my desk at San Francisco, but will do so the fir13t time I am in San Francisco if desired. It was about 1859 or 186o. ' I think that a company known as the Humboldt Telegraph Company completed a line between Placerville and Carson City, Virginia, and Gold Hill. At Placerville this line connected with the California State Telegraph Company of which I was the general manager. The Humboldt and other lines in California were consolidated with the California State Company in l86o, and all placed under my management, when the Overland Telegraph Company was organized to build the line from Virginia City to Salt Lake, there to connect with the Western Union, which was then building west. This line was built under my direction in 1861 and completed on the 24th day of October of that year, giving California direct communication with the eastern States. * * * . "The telegraph station in 1861 was at Yank's, on the old stage road, and 'from there the wire Followed tl1e road to Genoa. I am under the impression that Ives had a te1egraph connection 'h-ith his camp, but cannot locate it. * * *

272

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

"Yank, or Clements, his proper name, had his station on the old stage road some distance south of the lake. He afterwards rented or purchased Tallac, where he kept a place for tourists. * * * Mr. Clements is not living."

The followingisextracted from two letters of Mr. Frank Bell, one of Mr. Gamble's old assistants, who had personal charge of the mountain wires:
"I took charge of the lines in 1862. Yank's station was about 6 miles from lake, the shortest route, and about 7 miles from the Lake House. The Lake House was situated directly on the lake, our wire passing it. We /1ad an office at Lake House. Goddard's station was 1~ miles east of I,ake House or 1 mile west of Friday's station, but at the time the first survey was made Captain Lapham kept this station; Goddard did not keep it for some years afterward. It is only a few hundred y!J.rds from the lake. I,ake House was nearest point the wire ran to the lake." * * *

b.

Telegraphic longitude by Lieutenant Ives, r86r.

"At time you refer to (August and September, 1861) I was in Los Angeles. My recollection is that this matter was talked over after my return. I have an impression that an attempt was made to use the telegraph which had been completed shortly previous, but not being very well equipped wilh repeaters, was not very successful."

Mr. George Senf was stationed at Sacramento at the time of the Ives survey, and he tells me that he remembers Lieutenant Ives and the fact of !tis using tlze telegraph line for !zis longitude work in Lake Valley, but he does not recall whether the results were successful. He is now employed in the Western Union Telegraph office at San Francisco. On September 11, 1861, Lieutenant Ives telegraphed Mr. Kidder the" approximate longitude'' of his station, and as he had made use of the wire for three weeks from San Francisco it would seem to indicate that some difficulty was experienced in successfully obtaining the exchange with San Francisco; probably, as Mr. Bell says, due to the lack of a sufficient number of repeaters along the line.
2.

SEARCH FOR NOTES AND MAPS IN SACRAMENTO.

At Sacramento I made a very careful search in the surveyor-general's office for the maps and field notes of Lieutenant Ives, personally ·opening and examining all the rolls of old maps in the office. I was given free access to the files, but could find nothing bearing upon his work. Professor Davidson in writing to me said:
"The Ives story I long since consigned to the unattainable. His notes were not in the public office, nor were they in the private papers of General Houghton, because he had them all looked over. I was well acquainted with the keeper of the archives in San Francisco and they were not findable."

a.

Goddard map (of r855) lost.

Neither the Goddard nor the Houghton and Kidder maps could be found in the Sacramento office. Upon returning to San Francisco I called on Mr. Goddard at his office, and he told me that his map was not turned over by him, owing to the fact that he was not paid to complete it, but that later it was purchased by Lieutenant Wheeler for the sum of $100; it finally fell into the hands of the State university, where it was lost track of, and when Mr. Goddard himself sought to recover it the map could not be found.
b. Goddard monuments 011 oblt'que boundary.
It (the Goddard map) was on a scale of 2 miles to the inch, and showed the position of !tis astronomic station at tlze lake, the monument marking the line there, and the two monuments which he set at the terminus of the line near the crossing of the road, about

APPENDIX NO. 3.

15 miles southeast of the lake. One of these monuments was placed close to the road and the other on the summit of a hill about 200 feet above the surrounding valley. No· intermediate·marks were established. Mr. Goddard spoke of some of the hardships he encountered while making his survey, one of the most serious of which was the hostile Indians, who killed some of his animals. In his longitude work at the lake he used two chronometers, which he says varied considerably in their rates, due to transportation over the mountains. His longitude depended on the mean of several observations made of the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter. About this time some of his party left him, and he remained with one man for some time to obtain a " lunar." The weather was cloudy, however, and he had to leave, destroying much of his equipment to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Indians. When his survey was made the Territory of Utah wanted to establish a court at the Mormon town of Genoa, and it was made a part of his dutx to determine on which side of the line the town was situated. In the surveyor-general's office at Sacramento I discovered three maps rolled together, marked on the outside in pencil "Higley's East Boundary Survey." One of these I traced and refer to as Exhibit A.* It shows topography along the shore of the lake, while the one adjoining this on the north extends a distance of 35 miles to Sierra Valley and shows the topography on either side of the one hundred and twentieth meridian for a width of 4 or 5 miles. The third sheet extends to the westward of Sierra Valley about 25 miles to Jackson, on the Yuba River. No one in the office knew anything about these maps, and they bear no title except the pencil inscription on the back. Higley was surveyor-general of California from 1858 to l 86 l, to near the end of the year. He did not personally go into the field. The shore line on the west side of the lake is in pencil, as well as a portion of the oblique line, and I have copied the ink and pencil portions just as they were on the original. Later, in Carson City, I came across the following, which I believe refers to this map:

About this time Mr. Kidder was chief clerk in the United States surveyor-general's office for Nevada Territory, and an act of the Territorial legislature approved November, 1861, provided for the running of the line to below Esmeralda, provided the same was not run by the State of California before the 1st day of March, 1862. I feel confident that this map is the work of Mr. Kidder, the more especially as I am informed there was no other work to the north of the lake as early as 1861. Mr. Kidder is now in too critical a condition to be communicated with.

SEARCH FOR NOTES AND MAPS IN RENO AND CARSON CITY.

On April 12 I arrived at Reno, Nev., where I called upon the United States surveyor-general, but found nothing pertaining to the boundary except the map and field notes of the Von Schmidt survey.
a. lJfaps of I863 and ;865.

The following morning I went to Carson City, and there called upon the surveyorgeneral of the State. I was much pleased to find the maps of Houghton and Kidder of 1863, showing the entire survey from the lake northward to the Oregon line, and from the lake southeastward to the White Mountains, where the survey terminated. In addition to the above I found a map of the same scale ( 6 miles to the inch) by James S. Lawson, in 1865, commissioner for the State of Ne\·ada to survey and establish the western boundary of the State for a distance of 70 miles from the terminus of the survey of 1863.

on the earth's surface agreed substantially with line as run by observations at observatory, Camp Bidwell. * * * Made deep excavation near rocky ledge; deposited three large black bottles (glass), also charred cottonwood stake 30 inches long and 6 inches circumference; built about it a monument of .large stones, well shapen, circular, 9 ft. diameter, 7 ft. high, 4 ft. diameter at top, sunnounted by a dressed sandstone 20" x 20 11 x 1011 , marked as follows in deeply cut characters, viz: On north face, "Oregon;" on soutlI face, "Long: 120°," "Lat: 42°;" 011 east face, "Nevada;" 011 west, "Califon1ia;" on top, "D. G. Major, U.S. Astr., 1868." Distance to large rock 4 ft. x 4 ft. 30 links, direction S. W. to large rock 3 ft. x 3 ft., dist. 22 links, direction N. Planted a juniper post 6 ft. long, 8 inches square at top, marked on S. E. "N," on S. 'N. '' C," on N. '"'·face" O," on N. E. face" 1868, 120° L, 42° L." Blazed and marked many trees in creek bottom."

This extract from the field notes does not describe the method of determining the latitude and the longitude, nor the instruments used, except a mention of transit. It may be assumed that the longitude was not telegraphic, because in 1872 Von Schmidt found, by prolonging the one hundred and twentieth meridian from Verdi northward to the forty-second latitude, that the northeast angle or corner of D. G-. Major was 3 miles too far west. The Verdi longitude was determined by telegraph, from San Francisco. The notes of D. G. Major state that at the observatory established at Camp Bidwell'· A lengthy series of astronomical, magnetic, and barometric observations were made, extending into three lunations, for the purpose of ascertaining the intersection of the one hundred and twentieth meridian with the forty-second parallel, a geographical position of much importance, it being the initial point of the California-~evada line on the Oregon boundary. Over three thousand observations were made at this observatory, and the results deduced after a rigorous discussion were reduced to Camp Bidwell, and are perpetuated on a stone monument. * * * On the cap stone surmounting the monument I engraved the latitude, longitude, magnetic variation, and altitude above mean sea level; also the hour lines for a sun dial."

Col. Robert S. Williamson, United States Engineer Corps, about l 868 set a · monument near Verdi, supposed to mark the one hundred and twentieth meridian.
H. THE ALEXEY W. VON SCHllfIDT LINE, I872-1873.

On July 20, 1872, Willis Drummond, Commissioner of the General Land Office, entered into contract with Allexey W. von Schmidt to run the eastern boundary of California, as defined by article 12 of the constitution of said State and confirmed by act of Congress entitled "An act for the admission of the State of California into the Union," approved September 9, 1850 (Stat. L., Vol. IX, p. 452). The consideration was $41 200, and bond was given for $82 400. He was required to make all of the determinations of latitude, longitude, and azimuth in his own proper person. For determining longitude on the ~ine of the Central Pacific Railroad he was permitted to use the telegraph either with Salt Lake City or San Francisco. The northeast corner nf California, as established by D. G. Major, was made by the Department the initial point of the survey, and the numbering of the succes.c;;ive miles was to begin from the Oregon boundary, or forty-second parallel of latitude. In his field notes Von Schmidt states that he established a point at Crystal Peak, near Verdi, Nev., by telegraph, as the one hundred and twentieth degree of longitude "·est from Greenwich, and traced that meridian north to the forty-second degree of latitude, the south boundary of Oregon, and established the northeast corner of

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

California more than 3 miles to the east of the point located as such northeast corner by Daniel G. Major in 1868. He states:
From Major's corner I therefore ran east * * * 258·73 chs., at which point I established a large stone monument for the northeast corner of the State of California * * * . The monument consists of a post 8 ft. long and 8 inches square, marked on the north side "0 Lat. 42 deg.;" east side, "Nevada;" south side, "1872, Long. 120 deg.;" west side, "California." This post is solidly built into a stone mound 6 Y. ft. high with 8 ft. base and projects three feet from the mound. * * * At the half height of the mound four large stones are inserted, the one facing to the south marked "1872 A. W. von Schmidt, Long. 120°, T,at. 42°;" one f<1.cing west marked "C;" one facing to the north marked "0;" and the other, facing to the east, marked "N."

From the longitude established at Verdi the one hundred and twentieth meridian was carried to the north shore of Lake Tahoe. In 1873 he began field work 011 the north shore of Lake Tahoe, set up two signal poles for a range on the one hundred and twentieth meridian, and noted where the prolongation of this meridian struck the mountains and a snow patch on the hills south of Lake Tahoe; then, having procured the steamer Truckee, on a calm day he went across the lake, keeping in line by means of the range, and put up a flag at the point of landing. He states:
I next proceeded to take observations of Polaris * * * . Having laid off the true meridian, I proceeded to observe my fire signals and flag at the northerly end of the lake, and found that by moving my position at the south end of the lake two chains to the west from the flag set up at the point of landing I was on the true 12oth meridian. I continued these observations for three days and nights in succession, using flag signals by day and fire signals by night, until I became satisfied I was on the true meridian as brought down from Verdi, where it had been established by telegraph, namely, the 12oth degree of longitude west from Greenwich.
I.

LONGITUDE OF VERDI, ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTIETH MERIDIAN, 1872.

In 1872, at the request of another Department, the Superintendent of the United States Coast Sunrey directed Assistant George Davidson to determine the one hundred and twentieth meridian at the crossing of the Central Pacific Railroad. This was done by the interchange of telegraphic longitude signals at Washington square, San Francisco, the old Coast Survey station of 1869, and a station established to the east of Verdi by Mr. S. R. Throckmorton, Aid, United States Coast Survey. Six nights' exchanges of signals were ~btained, and personal equation was determined on five nights by the observers. The one hundred and twentieth meridian was located by triangulating a distance of something like 2 miles west from the astronomic station. This work -.vas tested in 1889, when the primary longitude of the United States reached Verdi, and the difference was less than 3 feet. In the report of the surveyor-general of California for 1890, page 15, the following statement is made by Grunsky and Minto:
The initial point of the Von Schmidt survey was the observatory station ocrnpied by Prof. George Davidson at Verdi in r872. From this point the position of the r20th degree of longitude west from Greenwich was established, and thence the meridian line was extended northward to the 42nd degree of north latitude and southward to Lake Bigler. The accuracy of the work along this part of the boundary of the State ha:; never before been brought into question; but the results of our work, as hereinafter shown, indicate that, although the point near Verdi was correctly established, the line marked by monuments as the boundary is l 60C} ft. too far west at the northern shore of the lake.

Finding the shore near the one hundred and twentieth meridian unfit for instrumental work, Von Schmidt ran east 77·55 chains on a course N. 89° 58' 30" E.; thence

He made the latitude of this station 38° 56' 45" by observations on Polaris and the sun with sextant and zenith sector, and the longitude 119° 58' 55 11 · His azimuth line was calculated by using the intersection of 120° with 39° at Lake Tahoe and Lieutenant Ives's· determination of the Colorado River end, longitude r 14 ° 31t'oo", latitude 35°. He then ran 454·77 chains on a course N. 89° 58' 3011 E. from the one hundred and twentieth meridian in latitude 38 ° 56 1 45", making the longitude of this point on the azimuth line I I.:) 0 55 1 I 3" ·6.

This tree was found as described in 1893. It then appeared to be about 8 inches in diameter, but the marks proved its identity. The cast-iron monument, however, was never put in place, as there was no evidence of its existence.

This monument was found in 1893. In 1899, after the prolongation of the Von Schmidt line to the Colorado River by means of several mileposts that were recovered, the iron monument was found to be about 150 meters northeast of the line. In proof of the fact that it no longer stands in the position originally intended for it, the following letter is taken from the Report of the Surveyor-General of California for 1890, p. 29:

These two posts were well preserved in 1893 and 1899. The east 35° latitude post is the one used for azimuth, triangulation, and determination of latitude by observation with the zenith telescope in 1893. When Lieut. J. C. Ives established the Colorado terminus in 1861, presumably, the river was on the eastern side of the alluvial bottom, and his longitude of the center of the river was given as 114° 36' at the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude. In 1873, when Von Schmidt reached the Colorado River, the bed of the stream had changed to the west side of the bottom, making a difference of 143 chains along the thirty-fifth degree. Being in s0me doubt as to whether he should take the center of the river as he found it or adopt that of Lieutenant Ives, he referred the matter to the Commissioner of the Land Office, the Hon. Willis Drummond. A copy of both letters is here inserted:
SAN FRANCISCO, CAI,., October 9, 1873. Hon. WII,LIS DRUMMOND. Waski11gto11, D. c. SIR: I beg most respectfully to make the following statement and to ask for instructions as to what your department considers the intersection of the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude and the middle of the channel of the Colorado River. In striking my azimuth from the thirty-ninth degree of north latitude and one hundred and twentieth meridian to the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude and the middle of the channel of the Colorado at longitude 114° 36', as given by Lieutenant Ives (assuming his point for a matter of convenience as a random line), I found on reaching the Colorado that while my line came within 20 chains of a perfect closure on Ives's old point the channel of the river was not there, hut had materially changed. To show the change in the bed of the river I forward you herewith two sketches, one showing the position of the river in 1863 ( r86r, probably), as per Lieutenant Ives's topographical sketches, and the other as I found it in I873. The·Colorado at this point runs between two banks formed of gravel wash, distant from each other an average of 2 miles. Between these gravel banks it is all sand, and the main channel of the river changes through this sand bed at pleasure. The two sketches show its relative position on the thirty-fifth degree of latitude in 1863 (r86I?) and I873; the difference is I mile 63 chains. I was credibly informed by United States officers at Mohave that the river constantly changes its channel at the point indicated in the sketches. The camp sutler at Mohave also informed me that the river bed at this point had changed back and forth twice since his stay there-about twelve years. What I desire your opinion on is whether I shall recognize the intersection of the thirty-fifth degree of latitude with the old channel of the river as it was established by Lieutenant Ives, or the intersection of the thirty-fifth degree of latitude with the present channel as I now find it. I have been led to make this inquiry of you for my guidance in the matter from the fact that the subject has been the cause of much adverse discussion among the surveyors and scientific men here, leaving me in great doubt as to my duty in the matter. Very respectfully, yours, A. \V. VON SCHMIDT,

United States Surveyor and Astronomer, Eastern Boundary California.

River, and whether you shall recognize the old channel of the river or the present channel as you now find it. * * * In reply I have to say that, under the circumstances, in reference to the changes in the river channel at different times, and the fact that Lieutenant Ives's survey has never been retun1ed to or recognized by the Department, your obvious duty will be to consider the intersection of the thirtyfifth degree of latitude with the middle of the channel of the river as you find it by your own determination and survey. * * * Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

along the thirty-fifth degree of latitude of 143 chains was to be made from the terminal as located by Lieut. J. C. Ives in 1861, and of 118 chains southwest of the random line run by Von Schmidt, namely, 20 chains to the southwest, being the error of closure on the Ives point; and 98 chains to the southwest, being the amount of correction due to the shifting of the rive'r between 1861 and 1873. This correction of 118 chains-nearly 1 Yz miles-to the southwest at the Colorado River terminus of the Von Schmidt random, was not distributed proportionately along the entire line from the Colorado River to Lake Tahoe, but was limited to a distan_ce of

282

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

about 130 miles from the Colorado River, or approximately one-third of its length, making a line with an angle in it. On account of this failure to correct the line all the way back, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey line, which started about onethird of a mile to the northeast of the Von Schmidt line at Lake Tahoe, crossed it twice, once at a distance of 54·3 miles from Lake Tahoe, in Sweetwater Valley, and again at a distance of 331 ·3 miles from Lake Tahoe, in Mesquite Valley. If the Von Schmidt line had been corrected all the way the Coast and Geodetic Survey line would not have crossed his line at all. As it is it crossed both his random line and his so-called corrected line. Illustration No. 8 shows clearly the relation of the different lines to each other. The first 270 miles of the Von Schmidt line is simply his uncorrected random, and the remaining I 30 miles bends away from the random to the southwest so as to strike the corrected terminal at the Colorado. While no systematic effort was made to find all of the old marks on the Von Schmidt line, search was made for them from time to time at different points where it could be done without retarding the regular work too much. Enough marks were recovered to reproduce with a fair degree of accuracy the entire line and thus give a comparison of the two surveys. Fifty marks were recovered as shown in the tabulated description. In his field notes relating to the oblique part of the eastern boundary of California, Von Schmidt makes the following statement:
I next proceeded to lay off azimuth of transit line running in a southeasterly direction from the thirty-ninth degree of north latitude, where it intersects the one hundred and twentieth degree of west longitude in Lake Tahoe, to where the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude intersects the middle of the channel of the Colorado River. To do this, it was necessary to know the longitude at the terminus in the Colorado River. There being no telegraphic facilities at that point, I concluded for the time being to assume the longitude of that place as determined by Lieutenant Ives in 1863 ( 1861-?) * * * run a line to Ives's point, then establish the intersection of the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude with the middle of channel of the Colorado River by a series of observations, correct my line back, should I find error in longitude, and mark and establish the true line in the field, ALL
OF WHICH WAS DONE.

The line as reproduced by the Coast and Geodetic Survey fails to confirm the terminal phrase of the above quotation. The Von Schmidt map was made on a scale of 2 miles to the inch. A photographic copy of the map and a copy of his report and field notes are in the possession of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey.
INSTRUMENTS.

In his field notes Von Schmidt mentions a meridian telescope, a zenith sector, a field transit, a sextant, and a barometer. His distances were obtained by chaining, when practicable, and by triangulation when the ground was very rough. His method was to measure a chain base at right angles to the line, observe the angle at the other end of the base, but not the small, acute angle at the distant, elevated point on the line. This gave rough distances, but perhaps close enough for the purpose.

The longitude of the State line in latitude 38° 57' 25"·06 by calculation with the azimuth 31r 0 19' 36"·99 as furnished in 1890 by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, for the azimuth of the State line at the intersection of 39° latitude and 120° longitude is made to be-Longitude 119° 56' 14"·33, a difference of 51"·57 or 4 073·3 feet. So the conclusion is drawn that the meridian boundary at the north end of the lake is r 609 feet too far west, and the first stone on the lake shore making the oblique boundary is 4 073·3 feet too far west. They state as follows:
"Having, as above set forth, ascertained the longitude of a point on the State line in the same latitude as the granite monument on the southeastern lake shore, the survey was continued from this granite monument as follows:" "N. 89° 59 1 43 11 ·79 E. * * * 4 073 ·3 feet to a point (J') on State boundary line in the same latitude as the granite monument on the lake shore (J). Set a pine post*. * * * Made a stone mound around post, thence on the boundary line with an azimuth of 131° 21 1 58 110 94 toward Lake Tahoe * * * 70·46 chains to shore of Lake Tahoe, bearing north and south, set a tamarack post*. * * *" From the point (J') which is on the State boundary line, and 4 miles 39·64 chains distant from the point o in the lake where the thirty-ninth parallel of north latitude is intersected by the one hundred and twentieth degree of longitude west from Greenwich, the survey of the State boundary was continued in the direction toward the intersection of the thirty-fifth parallel of latitude with the Colorado River as follows: "With the same azimuth above noted for this point, azimuth 31 r 0 21' 5811 ·94 1 ascending steep mountains bearing NE. and S\V. and noting all distances as though measured from the above-named point in Lake Tahoe * * * 16 miles 77 chains, west fork of Carson River, 30 feet wide runs N. 20° E. Beyond which this survey could not be extended owing to lack of necessary funds." *These two posts were found in 1893, the one on the lake shore lying on the sand, but identified by the marks, and the other one still in place.

which makes the monument 21"·14=1 727 feet too far west. The stone monument at the north end of the lake was found to be in Latitude 39° 13' 17''·25. Longitude 120° oo' 21"·96. The work at the Colorado end of the line was done in September, 1889, by William Minto, assisted by L. H. Taylor. Mr. Minto says:
"The work of determining the longitude of the intersection of the middle of the Colorado River with the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude was much simplified by the action of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey."

This ''action'' was the determination of the latitude and longitude of the Needles, a station on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad about 12 miles south of the thirty-fifth degree of latitude. ·Latitude 34° 501 18"·17. Longitude 114 ° 36 1 l 1"·04. A meridian line was also marked from the longitude pier to a point on the mesa about 300 meters south by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. The report continues:
"In September, 1889, the Coast and Geodetic Survey station thus established was connected by a system of triangulation with the monuments established by Col. A. W. Von Schmidt on the thtrtyfifth parallel of north latitude, as determined by him in running the State boundary in 1873. The Von Schmidt monuments found standing were the two posts designated in his field notes as being on the line of the thirty-fifth degree-one on the bluff west of the river and 2076 chains west of his intersection of the middle of the river by the said parallel of latitude, and the other 23 ·oo chains farther west, both in mounds of stone and earth and marked as described in his field notes. There is also a stone marked, as the notes describe it, "L 35° N" in the mound around the most easterly post." "Station was found to be in latitude 35° oo' 23 11 ·39 and in longitude n4° 39' 23 11 ·61, and the terminal point L of the Von Schmidt boundary survey of 1873 is in latitude 35° oo' 23 11 ·39 and in longitude II4° 39' 0711 ·o8." "Incidentally the latitude and longitude of the flagstaff at Camp Mojave was also established by this work: Latitude 35° 02 1 3011 ·22, longitude 114° 37' 14 11 ·48." "As nearly as could be determined from the Von Schmidt survey of 1873, the Colorado River from L fo L' had a southeasterly course, and this course as nearly as it could be determined was made the basis of the computation of the longitude of the intersection of the thirty-fifth degree of latitude with the center li,ne of the Colorado River in its position of r873. The l~titude 35° oo' 23 1 '·99 and longitude 114° 39' 07 11 ·o8 of the point L, with an azimuth 322° 32 1 25 11 ·65 from L to L', the latitude of I./ being 35° 001 0011 , established the longitude of L' at 114° 38' 45 11 .30, and the distance from L to L' was found to be 907'97 meters." · " The boundary line from Lake Bigler southeastward to the Colorado River must therefore connect a point in latitude 39° 00 1 00 11 , longitude 120° oo' 0011 , with a point at the Colorado River in latitude 35° 00 1 0011 and longitude u4° 38' 45 11 ·30." " From Colonel Von Schmidt it was learned before the above field work was undertaken that he was directed by the department in authority to make the center line of the Colorado River as he

The correct azimuth of the boundary line northwestward from the point L' is 134° 33' 0911 ·29, and this line, which the above work indicates as the correcterl position of the State boundary, passes about 414 feet to the southwest of the Von Schmirlt terminal point L.

BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA.

banks are 2·75 miles apart along the thirty-fifth degree, and the river changes from oue side of its bed to the other during the different periods of high water, which prevails usually in the months of May, June, and July, when the snow is melting in the mountains. It 1861 the river was on the east side of the alluvial bottom; a slough, or lake, the remains of an old channel, is still there. In 1873, when Allexey W. Von Schmidt reached the Colorado River with his survey of the boundary line, the river was on the west side of the bed; a small lake still exists on that side also, showing the old channel. In 1893, when the Colorado River terminus was located by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the. center of the stream coincided very nearly with the middle point between the permanei1t bluff banks. This was during the high water in the month of June. In 1899 the river was practically in the same position as it was in 1893. When the party completed the tracing of the boundary in January, 1899, it was during the period of low water, and while the middle point came on a low sand flat, a rise of I foot in the water would have covered this flat and brought the middle of the stream and the middle point between the permanent banks nearly into coincidence. The water.was less than 3 feet deep in the channel at that time.
A. INSTRUCTIONS TO PROF. GEORGE DAVIDSON:

The letter of instructions to Prof. George Davidson, Assistant, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, from the Superintendent, dated April 17, 1893, giving the general method of procedure and defining the position of the Colorado River terminus, is here inserted, with a few slight changes:
UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY, 0FFIClt OF THE SUPERINTENDENT, Washi11gto11, D. C., April I7, r893. Prof. GEORGE DAVIDSON, Assistant, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, San Francisco, Cal. SIR: Congress having provided for a resurvey of that l>art of the boundary line between California and Nevada which extends from a point in Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River, and for the re-marking of the same, the general direction of the field operations connected-with the work is placed in your hands. Assistant C. H. Sinclair and Subassistant W. B. Fairfield have been instructed to report to you for active duty upon this survey. Their experience and skill is such that it is believed that your presence in the field will not be necessary, except occasionally for purposes of inspection or for making personal examination of the more difficult parts of the field work. This boundary, as defined by act of Congress, is a "straight line" joining two points. One of these points is astronomically defined, the other only partially so, it being dependent for its longitude on the location of the Colorado River. The actual location of these two points, the termini of the line, is a necessary preliminary. As much of the present season as is necessary will be devoted to this part of the work. The amount of moriey available during the present fiscal year is $5,000, and about the same amount can be used during the fiscal year 1894. It is not desirable, therefore, to put two parties into the field, and, besides, the different climatic conditions obtaining at the two ends of the line make it advisable, at least for the present, to begin with one party at the southeastern tenninus, rather lightly equipperl, so that the expense of transfer to the vicinity of the lake on the approach of extremely hot weather will be small. Mr. Sinclair and Mr. Fairfield will doubtless be able to accomplish all that is necessary for the location of the terminus near the Needles by June I, or perhaps a little later. They should then pro· ceed to Lake Tahoe anrl locate the first monument of that end of the line. In the meantime, the coordinates of the termini having become accurately known, the azimuth of the line can be computed

288

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

and plans can be formulated for the execution of the chain of secondary triangulation necessary to its exact location. Beginning with the southeastern end of the line, the method used in locating that terminus should be essentially as follows: By definition this point is at the intersection of the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude with the Colorado River. From this point the line proceeds, according to the constitution of the State, "along the middle of the channel of said river) " from which it must be inferred that said point is itself in the middle of the channel of the Colorado River. At the latitude of 35° the river flows between two welldefined bluffs, separated from each other by a distance of 2~ miles. Between these the actual bed of the river vibrates from time to time, now being near one side and now near another. In 186o Congress passed an act appropriating money for a survey of this.boundary line, and in this act the line is defined as" beginning at the intersection of the thirty-ninth parallel of north latitude and the one hundred and twentieth degree of longitude west from Greenwich and proceeding in a southeasterly direction in a straight line to the point where the thirty-fifth parallel of north latitude crosses the Colorado River." This is, perhaps, the latest definition of the line, and it would be proper to assume that the southeastern terminus must be determined by the position of the river at the time of the passage of the act. As throwing light upon this point, the only information available here at this time consists of a published map of [Lieutena11t] Ives's exploration survey or reconnaissance of 1858 and a map of his survey of ( 1863) 1861? (see sketch No. 1, and No. 4 ), the latter having dpubtless been made for the purpose of locating the boundary line. In the former his latitude, as shown on the map, is in error a little more than one minute, according to his own record for his nearest astronomical station. If this correction is made, the two maps show the river in essentially the same position. It may be inferred, therefore, that its bed did not change materially from 1858 to ( 1863) 1861 ?, and that these maps show it practically as it was in 186o, the date of the act of Congress. If the latitude as shown in the later map is not seriously in .error, the. thirty-fifth parallel was along the bed of the river for a mile or more, as the river at that time and place ran nearly west to east across the valley separating the bluffs between which its bed is confined. From this it appears that all of the conditions to which this terminus is subjected will be satisfied by assuming it to be midway between the two bluffs between which the Colorado Rt'ver flows, on the line of the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude. Two points in latitude 35° north on these bluffs, equidistant from the point agreed upon as the terminus of the line, should be carefully determined and well marked. This definition will, therefore, be adopted as furnishing the most equitable, the most prominent, and hence the most easily reproduced location of the southeastern terminus. Besides, it is believed to be historically correct and in accord with the act of Congress of r86o. It may be assumed that the iron monument placed in 1873 will afford a first approximation to this point. An astronomical station should be established near it, and latitude observed. It should be connected by triangulation with the Coast and Geodetic Survey astronomical station at Needles. An azimuth should also be observed to connect with the triangulation. Having the latitude and longi. tude of this point, the location of the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude 011 the bluffs of the river may be determined and the proper position of the first boundary monument completed. For this purpose the azimuth of the line may be assumed to be 134° 33'. The monument should be.located on hard high ground on the bluff of the river, as near as may be, so that any defect in azimuth may have little effect. Before leaving it will be well to set up another monument in the line, say a mile or two away. In the execution of the work at Needles it will doubtless be necessary to establish a camp in the vicinity of the terminus o~ the line. It is not believed, however, that the outfit need be very extensive or expensive. If possible, such wagons and animals as are needed should be hired at the Needles or Mohave, as it will not be found necessary to transport them to the northern end of the line. If necessary to purchase them, they may be taken away after the work is done, and kept where it may be done at the least cost. Possibly much of the outfit for this camp can be furnished from the stores now on hand and under your charge in San Francisco. Mr. Sinclair has, at my request, prepared an estimate of the cost of doing the work at thil;i point, which he will submit to you for your consideration. The object in view is the equipment of the party in such a manner that there will be no loss, and as far possible nothing to dispose of when the w~rk is completed.

At Lake Tahoe it is assumed that the party will not need a camp, unless the astronomical work should be completed in time to take up some of the geodetic work before the close of the season. This work is not immediately necessary, however, although a necessary and important part of the complete scheme. At Lake Tahoe the work will consist of the verification of the location of the "initial boundary monument." Establishing an astronomical station near it, latitude will be observed and longitude determined by the most convenient and available method. It is understood there is a telephone wire connecting Tallac with some telegraphic point, as Carson City or some other station already occupied for longitude by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. If this is the case, telegraphic connection can doubtless be obtained with little difficulty. Three nights' exchange of signals, with another three nights after exchange of observers, will give sufficiently accurate results. If Tallac fails, the line to Glenbrook may be utilized, and if found absolutely necessary a temporary line may be erected connecting Genoa and the astronomical station on the shore of the lake: In case of either :>f the first two places being used, the longitude of the station may be determined by using heliotrope or powder signals, exchanged with Tallac or the transport of chronometers from Glenbrook on the lake; or it may be found cheaper to connect the astronomical station directly with telegraph connected .by temporary line. The azimuth of this end of the lin.e may be assumed to be 48° 41', but the result of the fixing of the southeastern terminus will make a revision of this value possible. Th~ location of a monument at the beginning of the line is impracticable owing to the fact that it is in Lake Tahoe, but with the observed latitude and longitude of the astronomical station and the azimuth of the line, the distance from the station to the nearest point on the boundary may be computed. It will be desirable to make this initial point as near the lake as maybe, and also to establish a second point on the line at some distance from the first. At the conclusion of this part of the work, should the season and available funds permit, some geodetic work may be undertaken·before leaving the vicinity of Lake Tahoe. The position of Tallac should be determined by using the base Freels and Round Top and the new astronomical station. The old and the new initial boundary monuments should be connected with Freels and Tallac. It is understood that Tallac will be easy of occupation, but that Freels will offer more difficulties. It is believed, however, that it can be easily occupied with special equipment or call!!!_ outfit. You will know better than anyone else what is required for the occupancy of Round Top. A single day of fair weather at each of those stations will be sufficient. . Magnetics should be observed at each station. The work of locating the two termini of the boundary line will probably extend through the summer months, and wh~n it is entirely completed it will not be too early to begin preparations for pushing the work from the southeastern point. A secondary triangulation, with sides 20 to 40 miles in length, and closely clinging to the lines, is to connect the two ends. It is hoped that the.work of locating the termini can be so conducted as to leave a considerable fund available for the execution of this work during the coming autumn and winter, beginning at the Colorado River. This will require a tolerably extensive outfit in the way of camp equipage and working force. Just what this should be can be better known, it is believed, after the experience gained in the execution of the above instructions. You will, of course, avail yourself of all sources of information relating to the subject, and be ready to submit plans and estimates in advance of the time for beginning operations in the field. As $5 ooo can be expended before July 1, and as it is believed that the party in the field, first at Needles and afterwards at Lake Tahoe, will not require so large an amount up to that date, you will endeavor to expend such balance as is available before July 1 in the purchase of portions of the field equipment for the triangulation party. As before stated, but one party can be kept in the field, but it is possible that by active work during the coming winter such advance may be made from the southern end that the operations of that party will not be cut off by high temperature in the early summer. Mr. Sinclair has estimated for the pay of a recorder at $45 per month, and in selecting some one for this position it is very desirable to secµre some young man who is a graduate from the engineering or physics courses in one of your two leading institutions of learning, as it is from this class that the professional corps of the survey should be recruited as-opportunity is offered from time to time. When the:: results of the observations at the two termini are in hand it will be possible to finally

S. Doc. 68--19

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.
comput.. the lines, after which general instructions for the execution of the scheme of triangulation can be prepared. Finally, these instructions are not to be considered as unalterable, and this is especially so with regard to details, in which you must be largely governed by local conditions. In case you think it necessary to make any considerable departure from the general scheme indicated above, you will as soon thereafter as possible explain such deviation and give your reasons for the same. While it is expected that the work will be of such a character as to assume absolute confidence in the result, it is not thought necessary to maintain in its execution that high standard which is regarded as essential to ·he success of our primary triangulation. The instrumental equipment need not be so elaborate, nor the observations so often repeated. Much money has already been expended in the location of this line, with unsatisfactory results. It is our ambition, first, to do the work so that it will never need to be done again, and second, to show that with our organization, instrumental equipment, corps of skilled observers and professional esprit, we can execute a piece of work like this at a less cost than any other body of men, especially those temporarily created under the authority of a "joint commission,', which is itself generally an expensive adjunct, not necessary, and with which we are not burdened I trust, therefore, that iri submitting a scheme and estimates for the coming triangulation work you will not lose sight of this important consideration, and I believe that through your extensive knowledge of the country and local conditions, together with the excellent opportunities for gaining information which are available to you, you will be able to reduce the cost of the work to as low a limit as is compatible with its proper execution. Respectfully, yours, T. C. MENDENHAI.I., Supe1 intendent.

LOCATION OF THE SOUTHEAST TERMINUS, COLORADO RIVER.

In compliance with instructions of the superintendent dated April 8, 1893, I went to San Francisco, Cal., early in May to report to and confer with Assista t Davidson, accompanied by Assistant W. B. Fairfield, who was associated with me on this boundary survey from its beginning in 1893 to its colllpletion in 1899. As the instructions to Professor Davidson state, the thirty-! 'th degree of latitude was to be determined by observations (with the zenith telescope); the longitude to locate the center of the river where it crosses the thirty-fifth degree was fo be carried up by triangulation from the telegraphic longitude station at the Needles, which was determined in 1889, the distance being about 13 miles~ an azimuth was to be observed near the thirty-fifth degree and a point located approximately in the boundary line by using the old azimuth of the line derived from imperfect data of former years. After this, a recomputation of the work was t.o be made by the office, the error determined of the points approximately placed, and the corrected boundary marks set in position. Between May 2 and 13 arrangements were completed in San Francisco for executing the work, and on May 13 the party and outfit started to the Needles, Cal., as th~ base for conducting the field operations. The party consisted of Assistants C. H. Sinclair and W. B. Fairfield, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey; Mr. G. J. Kammerer, recorder; William Diercks, foreman; and George Simons, hand, brought from San Francisco, and Sam Costello, hand, hired at the Needles, who also did the rough cooking required at the astronomic station. Mr. Fair.field succeeded in hiring a buckboard with a pair of horses at the Needles for reconnaissance, signal building, and triangulation between the Needles and the thirty.fifth degree of latitude. . Upon reaching the Needles steps were taken to secure a team for hauling the instruments, observing tent, lumber for the platform, cement to construct the pier, and other material up to the thiry:y-fifth degree of latitude, about 13 miles over a rough, sandy road on the west side of the Colorado River.

Before doing this I made a preliminary trip with the mail carrier to Fort Mohave, then converted into a school for Indians, the distance being nearly 18 miles over a sandy road on the east side of the river. The officials at the school were very obliging, furnishing me with a boat and men to cross the:triver and visit the iron monument that was supposed to be the terminal mark of Von Schmidt's line run in 1873. Fort Mohave was too far from this point, being on the wrong side. of the river, so the idea of living there was abandoned. I therefore returned to the Needles and on May 19 moved up to the thirty-fifth degree latitude post of Von Schmidt by team. This place was the nearest known position to the latitude required. Two of these posts were set in 1873 to mark the parallel of thirty-five degrees, and the east one, which is on a bluff of sand and gravel about 50 feet above the water and overlooking the alluvial bottoms of the river, was selected as a triangulation and azimuth point. Just 5 ·87 meters due west of this eastern post, a latitude pier 17 inches by 17 inches by s ~ feet high was built of concrete during the afternoon of our arrival at the thirty-fifth degree. An observing tent 8 by 10 feet was erected on a platform to shelter zenith telescope No. 6, which was used to make the observations. The latitude was determined by 97 observations on 20 pairs of latitud~ stars on May 22, 23, 25, 27, and 28five nights-and value of micrometer on 43 H. Cephei through lower culmination on one night, May 29. Time was observed wit;h the zenith telescope to determine the error of pocket chronometer Karr No. 1012. The latitude was determined by what is commonly known as Talcott's method. Two stars are selected on different sides of the zenith and nearly at equal distances from it; the difference of zenith distance is measured by means of a delicate micrometer, noting the level and the approximate time of culmination of each star; only the differential refraction is introduced. Upon the completion of the latitude preparations were made for determining the azimuth, which was done in the usual manner by measuring the angle between a fixed terrestrial mark and the moving star, noting the chronometer time when pointing on the latter, and referring the observations to the meridian, thus determining the angle between the plane of the meridian and the terrestrial mark. These azimuth observations were made on Polaris" at any hour angle," June 2, 3, and 4, by me, using an 8-inch theodolite No. 153, reading to 5" by 2 verniers; on June 22, 23, 24, and 25 further measurements of the azimuth were made by Assistant W. B. Fairfield with Gambey theodolite No. 20, a 10-inch instrument reading to 5" by 4 verniers. Thirty-seven separate results were obtained for this azimuth. In order to determine points for the topography near the thirty-fifth degree of latitude a base of 462·5 meters was measured twice with a 30-meter steel tape, and a small scheme of triangulation developed, which also served to get the distance acros.<> the river. The field computations of the latitude showed that the thirty-fifth degree of latitude post of Von Schmidt was in 35° oo' 15"·16, or that the point was about 467 meters too far north. This distance was laid off to the ·south, and 3 redwood posts, each 4 inches by 4 inches by 6 feet, were placed to mark the thirty-fifth degree, 2 of these on the west side of the river and 1 on the east bank in Arizona. Each of these posts has carved on it Lat. 35°. I893. C. G. S. The 2 posts on the west bank are . 440·07 meters apart. The most easterly is 83 meters from the foot of the bluff and 100 meters from the shore line of the lake (old channel). The post on the Arizona or e'ast side of the river is 135 meters from the foot of the bluff and 140 meters from the shore

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900,

line of the lake (another old channel). The posts were placed on the high bluffs (40 to 50 feet) which overlook the trees on the river bottom. They were surrounded with mounds of stone and sand and each has a stone under it with a drill hole in the top to mark the point. The distance between the 2 posts nearest the river on the east and west banks is 4 580 meters; from foot of bluff to foot of bluff is 4 362 meters; one-half of this is 2 18 I meters, the distance to the center of river, or the middle point between the bluff banks. Von Schmidt marked his thirty-fifth degree of latitude by 2 cottonwood posts, l on the bluff and the other 462 '8 meters west. Both were found in good condition. The post near the river was carefully removed; a stone with a drill hole in it was placed 2 feet below the surface for an underground mark, and another stone placed over this with a drill hole in it for a surface mark. This station was used both as a point in the triangulation and for observing azimuth. Upon completing the azimuth observations the post was set back in its old place, a large nail driven in the top, and centered over the point below. A mound of stone and sand was built around the post. This post is also the north end of a meridian, the south end being 468'62 meters distant, marked by a drill hole in a block of concrete. A small pile of stone was placed over it. The topography includes a mile on each side of the thir_ty-fifth degree of latitude, on a scale of n;--k!nr. covering an area of 7 square miles. It was executed by means of a small plane table, partly by me and partly by the recorder, Mr. G. J. Kammerer, for the purpose of defining clearly the bluff line along the river, which is the only stable shore line of the Colorado River at and near the thirty-fifth degree of latitude. These bluffs are formed of sand, gravel, pebbles, and bowlders washed down from the mountains. They are devoid of vegetation, except greasewood and sagebrush. They vary in height from a few feet to 70 or 80 feet, and sloping down toward the river are deeply furrowed into ravines by_ heavy rains, giving the appearance of numberless embankments or dumps from mines at right angles to the general direction of the stream, which has washed around the end of these embankments during high water, keeping the river ends precipitous. The alluvial bottoms are from 2 to 3 miles wide, the soil being a sandy loam rising several feet above the river, but generally submerged during the time of high water. The growth is chiefly willow, interspersed with cottonwood and mesquite. Some of the land is cultivated by Indians; there are also a few ranches owned by whites. The current is very swift and the channel changes rapidly during high water. Sometimes from 20 to 30 feet of the bank will be cut away in a day. The topographic sheet shows approximately the rate of change during the short time we were in that locality. In 1893 the east bank was being cut away. Trees from 5 to 12 years old were swept away like twigs. Lakes or remains of old channels are numerous. After the preliminary computations ha<l been made· posts were set to mark the approximate position of the oblique boundary line on firm ground. The first of these was 2 o8o meters north and 293 meters west of the Von Schmidt east latitude post, and 3 646 meters northwest of the center of the river. The second post is 2 250 meters northwest of the first post. These two posts are redwood, 4 inches by 4 inches by 6 feet, placed in the ground about 2 feet, with a mound of stone and sand around each. The one nearest the river has carved on its. E. LINE POST, c. G. s.; the other N. w. LINE POST, c. G. s. All of these marks wt!re of a temporary character, awaiting the Office computations of the observations before being permanently placed.

The triangulation from the astronomic station at the Needles to carry up the.longitude-to the thirty-fifth degree was executed by Assistant W. B. Fairfield. He measured a base of l 709·326 meters in length four times-twice in the day aud twice at nightwith a steel tape 100 meters long, under a strain of 10 kilograms. Posts were driven every IO meters to support this tape, and the contacts were made on pieces of tin nailed on top of the 100-metei:' posts. Two thermometers were read during the measurements. 'rhe day temperatures ranged from 98° to u6° and the night temperatures from 69° to 86°. The base line.was leveled by Mr. G. J. Kammerer, and also connected with the rail of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad at the Needles. This latter point was given by the railroad authorities as 477 feet above the Southern Pacific Railroad datum, which is the level of high water in San Francisco Bay, 5·7 feet above the level of mean low low water at Fort Point. The distance between the Needles and the thirty-fifth degree east post of Von Schmidt was covered by two quadrilaterals. The latitude at the Needles was by.this means ·connected with that at the Von &;hmidt post and showed a difference of 9. 19 seconds of arc, or 283 meters, due to local deflection. 'l'he operations near the southeast terminus a( the oblique boundary were completed by June 30, 1893, and the party returned to San Francisco to prepare for taking up the work on Lake Tahoe near the.northwest end of the oblique boundary.
C.

LAKE TAHOE OR NORTHWEST TERMINUS, I893.

Preparations for this work were in progress from early in July to the 25th of the month. Horses, mules, wagons, harness, bedding, tents, instrumental outfit for longitude, latitude, azimuth, and triangulation were procured and shipped to Carson City; finally, the party left for the same point July 25. . The first step to be taken was the determination of longitude at a point on the Von Schmidt boundary of 1873 near Lake Tahoe. This was done by using Carson City as a b.ase and connecting the lake station with it by the telephone line, which runs fron1 Carson City to Glenbrook and thence along the shore of the lake to Bijou and Tallac, for exchanging longitude signals. The station used at Carson City was the latitude pier erected by me in 1889, om·803 north and 8m'015 east of the transit pier in the observatory of Mr. C. W. Friend. A rough wooden building was erected to shelter the instrument. The station on Lake Tahoe was placed in the. open area on the. east or front side of the Lakeside Tavern, formerly the property of Mr. Lapham, but in 1893 occupied by Mr. E. B. Smith. . · This station is 61 ~ feet south and 33 feet west of the second granite monument from the lake shore, set by Von Schmidt in 1873 to mark the line at the road. This monument is "211 miles 30 chains" from the Oregon boundary. On one side is ''CALIFORNIA,'' the other ''NEVADA,'' and on the southeast face is '' 187 3,'' evidently changed from 1863. The stone has a good foundation in gravel soil, and was in a vertical position. The location of the longitude station was selected with reference to the telephone line from Carson City to Bijou. The use of this was ~ven us by the owners. . The longitude pier was built of brick laid in cement, 2 ~ feet in the ground and 3 feet above. The top is I 7. i.>y 25 inches. After the astronomic work was completed the pier (called ''Transit'' in the triangulation records) was coated over with Portland cement, and a granite slab 17 by 25 by 6 inches placed on top. The station mark is a

294

COAST. AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900,

copper bolt in top of the slab. In 1899 all of. this cement coating had been destroyed by frost, and, to prevent the bricks from disintegrating, a concrete coating made of cement and broken stone was placed around this pier. A latitude pier" 17 by 17 by 40 inches was erected 50 inches due west of the transit pier for the zenith telescope (No. 6), but it was removed after completing the observations, except the brick foundation about a foot below the surface. Upon the completion of the astronomic stations, longitude signals were interchanged between Carson City, where Professor DavidsoJ:\ made the observations, and Lake Tahoe on August 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. ·After this Professor Davidson went to Lake Tahoe and· I went to Carson, and signals were again interchanged on August 9, 10, and 11, which c6mpleted the determination. The longitude determination was made in the following manner: Both stations were fitted up with instruments as near alike as possible; the same stars were observed at both stations, so as to eliminate errors of right ascensi~n; after half the observations were completed the observers changed places to eliminate the personal equation. The observations were made on two time sets divided into two groups containing each four time stars and an azimuth star. Eight levels were read during each time set, or 16 during the night's work. The two time sets gave two independent corrections for the chronometer, and hence a rate so that the chronometer corrections might be applied to the epoch of interchange of signals between the two stations. About 30 signals. were sent in each direction and recorded on the chronographs which are arranged for double speed. The time observations were recorded at ordinary or single speed. On August 16 zenith telescope No. 6 was mounted on the latitude pier at Lake Tahoe, and the latitude was determined by 108 observations on 22 pairs of stars during five nights-August 16, 17, 18, 19, 2o-and value of micrometer on a Ursre Minoris through upper culmination with chronographic record on August 21. A primary azimuth was determined by Assistant George Davidson about Sf:veneighths mile northwest of Lakeside Tavern, on the shore of Lake Tahoe, with 20-inch theodolite No. 115, and introduced in the triangulation computation. Immediately after the observations were completed the preliminary computations of both latitude and longitude were made for field purposes . . Early in September a base of 930 meters was measured with a steel tape on the shore of the lake and a scheme of triangulation developed and executed for the topogr~phy and for locating a point approximately on the boundary due north of the longitude station ( '' Transit ''). The following data for determining this point were available:

t I) The observed latitude; (2) The observed longitude; (3) The approximate azimuth 3II 0 19' at the intersection of 39° latitude and 120° longitude furnished by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Office from former determinations of the Colorado River terminal.
The preliminary computations showed that the longitude station was 790·9 meters due south of a point on the oblique boundary. The meridian used in the preliminary work was laid off with the astronomic transit, and the distance, 790·9 meters n~~h of the longitude pier, was measured with a steel tape; the point thus located was called "Turning Point 1893." It was marked by

a block of granite with a copper bolt in the top. This station was occupied with a 10-inch Gambey theodolite and the preliminary azimuth of the line was laid off and three other points were placed approximately in line and marked:
( 1) "Initial stone 1893" on the lake shore, block of granite with copper bolt: (2) "Road 1893," west side of main road, block of granite with copper bolt.
(3) "Mountain 1893," drill hole in stone on mountain 2·29 miles distant.

A meridian stone (granite) was placed 507'2 meters north of the longitude pier.
It is in the east-and-west cut made by Grunsky and Minto in x889, from Von Schmit's

lake-shore stone, or 2 rn mi\_es 76 chains monument. Another granite meridian mark was placed about 390 meters south of the longitude pier. Each of these was marked by a copper bolt in top with cross lines. Five boundary marks established by Von Schmidt in 1873 were recovered, all in good condition:
( l) The granite monument on the shore of the lake, called "Lake shore stone" in the records, niarked "210 miles 76 chains'.' on the northwest face, "1873" (changed from 1863) on the southeast face, "N.EV." on the northeast, and "CAI.." on the southwest face. This monument was in loose sand and leaning somewhat. A crib work of logs was placed around it after the stone was made vertical. (2) A square wooden post set in the marsh to mark 2u miles. (3) Granite monument on the southeast side of the road in front of Lakeside Tavern, marked "2II miles 30 chains," counting from Oregon, date changed from 1863 to 1873, and with "CAI.IFORNIA" and "NltVADA" on their respective sides. (See illustrations Nos. 15 and 16.) (4) Wooden post to mark 212 miles, on the.foothills. (S) Tree marked "212 miles 53 chains," to preserve the site of Von Schmidt's observatory on the southeast shore of the lake. ·

The field notes of Von Schmidt state that this point (5) was marked by an "iron monument." I failed to find anything but a pine tree 8 inches diameter, marked "212 m. 53 ch. 21 lks.," "1873 1 " "CAI..," and "Nltv." The iron monument could not have been carried to that place except in sections, on account of the steep grade and rough mountain side. It was never set in place. No search was made for Von Schmidt's line marks southeast of this point, as they were too far from our base of oi}erations. This line (Von Schmidt) is blazed through the woods very clearly, and may be traced without any difficulty. While executing the topography the line of 1863 was identified by means of a fence, running along it and trees with blazes. cut on them and traced nearly to the mountain summit. No marks were near the iake, but a wooden post without marks about 10 by 10 inches, 6 feet long, was found in the fence line just west of the Placerville road. The post was badly decayed at the ground and ready to fall. I learned afterwards that the two granite monuments now on the Von Schmidt line of 1873 were formerly on this line. The date 1863 was changed to 1873, as is clearly shown by inspecting the figures. These granite monuments are 6 feet long, 2 feet rough cut with base dimensions about 12 by 12 inches, and 4 feet dressed, being 10 ~ inches at the bottom and 8 ~ inches at top, and terminating in a fiat pyramid. Near the triangulation point, "Upper Truckee," three-eighths mile west of the mouth of the Upper Truckee River, two wooden blocks were found that had evidently been sawed off from a large tree about 2 ~ feet in diameter and used as instrument supports, presumably by Von Schmidt in 1873. These blocks were in the last stages of decay, and were nearly obliterated by a storm in September, 1893. 'l'he most westerly

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

block was in the water, the lake having encroached upon the south shore. Two good photographs were obtained of these blocks. The post set by Grunsky and Minto in l 889 to mark their boundary near the shore of the lake was found lying on the ground and photographed without disturbing it. A second post set by them '' 4 07 3 ·3 ft.'' due east of the '' Lake Shore Stone '' of Von Schmidt was also found and determined on the topographic sheet No. 2151, scale l: 10 ooo. No other marks set by these engineers were looked for. Several of the section trees of the land survey were included in the topography. A number of the triangulation points along the lake shore toward Bijou and Rowland's were permanently marked w_ith stones having drill holes in the tops. A block of granite with a copper bolt and cross lines on top and with "120°" cut on its north face, was set on the low, narrow, grassy rim of firm land separating the marsh of the Upper Truckee River from the lake. This stone is three-eighths mile east of the mouth of the Upper Truckee River. It has about 18 inches exposed above ground . . While I was engaged at the southeast end of Lake Tahoe, Assistant W. ~airfield executed the triangulation necessary to connect the primarytwork depending on the Yolo base, with \he small triangulation executed by me. He used for this purpose the line "Lola-Round Top," 91 038·53 meters in length, and gradually contracted the scheme until he finally joined my work on the line "Folsom-Lake Shore Stone," 3 017'08 meters in length, differing from my rough determination with a steel tape base only o· 3 meter, which is sufficiently close for topographic purposes.

APPENDIX NO. 3.

BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA.

297

The country traversed by the boundary, as shown on the topographic sheet ooo, has the following characteristics: Near the shore the soil is chiefly sand from the disintegration of the granite forming the surface rock of the mountain range. The slope is gradual up to the foothills, which begin three-fourths of a mile from the shore. Beyond this the country is very much broken by hillocks and ~mall peaks, having both sides and summits covered with masses of granite. This continues for three-fourths of a mile farther, rising at 1 ~ miles from the lake to an elevation of some 600 feet above its surface, where the steep side of the mountain is reached. · The rise continues to an altitude of 3 300 feet above the lake. The sloping ground and many of the little valleys are cultivated where water can be procured for irrigation. . Several small mountain streams are utilized for this purpose, but the supply is not very abundant. All of this region was covered with a splendid growth of sugar pine, pitch pine, tamarack, white fir, and white cedar. Most bf the original forest bas been cut and the timber used in the mines of Virginia City and the neighboring towns. This industry necessitated the building of two narrow-gauge railroads--one at Bijou, the s611thern end of the lake, with several branches running through the timber, and the other at Glenbrook, to carry the lumber from the lake up to the summit, whence a flume conveyed it to Carson City, the nearest point to the railroad running to Virginia City and Reno. ~o steamers were employed to tow rafts of logs to the sawmills and the barges, laden with wood from Bijou and other points on the lake, to Glenbrook. · · In 18.g8 the narrow-gauge railroads were tom up and removed to the northwest side of the lake. For years the lake has been a summer resort. Many hotel& have sprung up to meet this demand. A railroad now connects Tahoe City with Truckee, and a large. steamer carries the mail and excursion parties around the lake during the summer. Mr. Frank \V. Edmonds acted as telegraph operator at the Lake Tahoe astronomic station, was recorder to Professor Davidson in observing the primary azimuth, and assisted in the preliminary computations and building of signals for triangulation and the topographic work. Mr. G. J. Kammerer aided Assistant Fairfield in his triangulation. Among the many who rendered service and showed us courtesies may be mentioned Mr. C. W. Friend, of the Carson City observatory; Bliss Brothers, representing the Virginia and Truckee Lumber Company and owners of the telephone line from Carson City to Glenhrook; also the owners of the telephone lines from Glenbrook to Bijou and Tallac Hotel. No charge was made for using this line, and free transportation on the steamers plying between Glenbrook and Bijou was given us. The season closed about November 1, and the party returned to Carson City for the purpose of storing the outfit and putting the animals out to winter. The party reached Sau Francisco from Carson City on November 3, 1893, and was disbanded. Mr. Fairfield and I remained in San Francisco, working on the records, until November 26, when we started to Washington.

FIELD OPERATIONS OF I894.

During the winter of 1894 the office computations of the work executed at the Colorado River and Lake Tahoe termini were made, and the party was directed to resume operations on the California and Nevada oblique boundary, beginning at Lake Tahoe and running southeast in tracing the line. The great railroad strike beginnint:, June 28, 1894, and continuing about a month, prevented us from getting into the field by July 1.

INSTRUCTIONS.

The following instructions of May i6, 1894, show the general scope of the field work:
TREASURY DEPARTMENT, UNITltD STATltS COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Washington, D. C., May I6, ;894.
C. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant, Coast and Geode~ic Survey, Washington, D. C.
SIR: After completing the Tacoma-Seattle longitude work and the necessary computations at San Francisco relative thereto, you will please arrange, in conference with Assistant Davidson, for the resumption, on July r, of work on the California and Nevada boundary line. You will begin at the Lake Tahoe end of the ·boundary and first observe an azimuth for the determination of its direction. This azimuth may be observed at a point 8o5·15 meters due north of the longitude station, which point is the intersection of the meridian of the longitude station with the oblique boundary. Calling To the initial point in Lake Tahoe, and TI, T 2, etc., the points in the line proceeding southeast, and C o the initial point in the Colorado River, and CI, C 2, etc., the points in the line proceeding northeast, the azimuthTo to Co= 3n° I41 36"·6 and the azimuth

T
hence the back azimuth T

I I

to Co= 3n° I6 1 3911 ·8, to T o

= 131°

16' 3911 ·8.

Having obtained the direction of the line, you will range it out with a theodolite, establishing points on the lake shore, road crossings, and summits, so that from any principal line mark two others, one forward and the other backward, may be visible. These line marks should be placed from I to 5 miles apart, according to the character of the country. The distances between the principal line marks will be measured by small triangulation, continuous as far as practicable, and intermediate distances may be obtained where triangulation is impracticable by tape measures and telemeter. Assistant W. B. Fairfield will be assigned to your party, and has already been instructed to report to you on July 1, at Lake Tahoe, after having attended to the purchase of necessary outfit. · Mr. Fairfield will execute, under your direction, the triangulation, and attend ~o the sketching of the topography, while you are engaged on the ranging out and marking of the line; but as your work will probably progress more rapidly than his, you will, from time to time, discontinue temporarily your line work and assist in the triangulation. Latitude and longitude observations will be made at or near the intersection of the Carson and Colorado Railroad with the boundary, and an azimuth will be observed at said intersection. According to the railroad map the station named" Queen" is very near the boundary. The magnetic elements should be determined at Carson City and Lake Tahoe, and the magnetic bearing 'of the boundary line should be observed at all monuments and triangulation stations occupied. For the latter purpose a compass declinometer may be used. Assistant George Davidson will exercise general supervision over the v.:ork, and you will confer freely with him and keep him fully informed as to the progress of the work, but you will have control over your party funds and will submit your accounts, journals, and monthly reports directly to this office.

Your estimates for monthly expenses, etc., will be approved, but the amount of the allotment (probably $5 ooo) can not be fixed until after the passage of the appropriation bill by Congress. You will be duly notified hereafter of the amount of your allotment, and on its exhaustion you will, without further instructions, disband party, make suitable provision for the care of the public property in your charge, and proceed to Washington, D. C., and report to me in person at this Office. Mr. Fairfield will also proceed to Washington, and his traveling expenses and your own, and all necessary expenses of the work, will be covered by these instructions. Respectfully, yours, 'l'. C. MENDENHALL, Superintendent.

AZIMUTH OBSERVATIONS SOUTHEAST END LAKE TAHOE.

In compliance with these instructions the party left San Francisco on July 27 for Lake Tahoe and reached the field of operations on the 31st, after getting together the animals, wagons, instruments, and other outfit stored in Carson City at the close of the preceding season. In June, Assistant W. B. Fairfield had gone to Carson Valley and purchased additional mules for our complement of team and pack animals. From the new determination of the termini a more correct knowledge of their geographic position was obtained and a recomputation of the direction of the oblique boundary was made. The new azimuth was about five minutes less t_han the preliminary· one used in 1893, and the new distance north of the longitude pier to reach a point on the oblique boundary was 805·15 meters instea4 of 790·9 meters. The meridian was extended north of the old position of 1893 14·25 meters, and a large block about 16 incheS in diameter and 7 feet long was cut from a dry pine log and planted 2~ feet in the ground as a support for the azimuth instrument (theodolite No. 82, 10-inch Gambey). Azimuth was determined on August 3, 4, and 5 by means of ten sets on ''Polaris at any hour angle.'' The terrestrial mark was placed at Folsoms Knob, distant 2 ~ miles. After computing the azimuth, the angle of the line was laid off and a point was located on the shore of the lake 46o·7 meters distant and called "Initial ·I894." The azimuth station itself was called "T 1." Another point, T 2, was set from the azimuth station 377·9 meters southeast on the road· from Bijou to Glenbrook and Carson City (from Placervil1e to Carson Valley). These two points were marked with stones having copper bolts in top, moved from the preliminary poin~s set in 1893. The theodolite was then transferred to the point on the shore of the lake, ''Initial 1894," and a point was located on the mountain, T 3, 3 946·4 meters distant. The theodolite was after this moved up on the mountain, where a camp ·was established. The stations T 3, T 4, T 5, T 6, and T 7 were.successively occupied, the distances between them being as follows: T 3 to T 4, 263·4 meters; T 4 to T 5, 988"6 meters; T 5 to T 6, 652 meters; T 6 to T 7, 602 meters. Thus, in ranging out 4 miles, it was necessary to set up the theodolite five times in order to get over the summit of the mountain, which rises to 9 517 feet above the sea, or nearly 3 300 feet above the lake.
3. RANGING OUT THE LINE-ORGANIZATION OF PARTY.

The party was now divided in~o three sections. One under Mr. Fairfield, who had charge of the triangulation for determining the length of the line, the magnetic observations, and topographic sketching. The other two sections were the ranging-out section with the theodolite, under my immediate charge, and the forward section, which cooperated with me, under Mr. A. W. Cuddeback, who went ahead to locate points in

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

line by means of a pocket heliotrope. Two heliotropes were used to get in line, one at the theodolite and one with the forward party, both parties being provided with a code of signals. The length of sight was limited only by the topographic features.
4. CARSON VALLEY-ANTELOPE MOUNTAINS-SWEETWATER MOUNTAINS.

From T 7 a number of points were located in Carson Valley, and as far away as T 22, on the summit of the Antelope range, a distance of 20·4 miles. The theodolite was then moved back to T 6 because it was higher, and T 32 was lined in on the east slope of the ''Middle Sister,'' in the Sweetwater Mountains, 43 ·7 miles from the instrument. This was a very long sight, the longest recorded, to my knowledge, up to that time, of lining in a point, but it was exceeded by the next sight from T 32 to T 60 on the White Mountains. The theodolite was moved from T 6 to T 32, and a number of points put in on the back line to the northwest as far as T 23 on the southeast slope of the Antelope Mountains. It required three days to move from Lake Tahoe to the Sweetwater Mountains. The camp outfit and instruments were carried up on pack animals to a spring on the northwest side of the " Middle Sister," about a mile from the station.
5.
s~ormy

WHITE MOUNTAINS.

From T 32 the White Mountains loomed up conspicuously, and as the season for weather was approaching I sent the forward section directly to this distant place, · and succeeded in getting a point located in 1 hour 40 minutes from the time the heliotrope was first seen. This long sight of 68'8 miles was made on a small pocket Steinheil heliotrope, with a mirror l }i inches by l inch, and the signals were clearly interpreted at that distance. This point was T 60, the southeast limit of our work for the season, 116'2 miles from the shore of Lake Tahoe. The forward section returned after this to T 42, working back toward the theodolite station T 32. This point T 42 was nearly 27 miles from T 32 and almost 42 miles this side of the White Mountains. Points were located on all of the important intervening ridges back to T 32. The theodolite was afterwards moved to T 42, and points were placed on the ridges and roads to T 49, 16'5 miles southeast. In order to reach T 49 it was neeessary to cross the desert, a distance of 30 miles, withot~t water. The route was from Aurora by Spring .Peak across the desert to Adobe Meadows, at the east end of which is a large spring, making an excellent camping place. The instrument was set up at T 49, and points were lined in as far as T 53. The latter was then occupied and T 54 put in, so point by point until T 59 was reache~, which marks the crossing of the Carson and Colorado Railroad, about r 10 miles from the shore of Lake Tahoe. Assistant W. B. Fairfield had charge of the triangulation, as before stated. It was decided at the beginning of the season.to carry a schenie of triangulation .along the line, with sides from 1 to 5 miles in length, to get the distances and control the work. The base for this purpose was obtained by contracting the primary wo.r~ from '' Round Top''-'' Lola'' to the requisite dimensions near Lake Tahoe. As the line could be ranged out more rapidly than the triangulation could be executed, I stopped the ranging from time to time and assisted in the triangulation, reconnaissance, and signal building.

APPENDIX NO. 3. -BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA.

301

The angular measures \\'ere made with a 6-inch Gambey reading to 5'!, a ro-inch Gambey reading to 5", and a 7-inch Buff and Burger theodolite reading to ro''. The party consisted of r r men, all told; 23 animals, of which 5 were saddle horses and 18 were mules; 2 large wagons and I thoroughbrace, with a pair of mules. The party during this season was able to subsist on the country, at the ranches and small hotels. Provender, such as hay and grain, was generally procured in the immediate neighborhood of the work. Owing to frequent moves, the field operations were more in the nature of a reconnaissance than regular triangulation. During the season 60 points were established on the random line and 35 additional triangulation points were fixed. Upon the completion of the triangulation the entire outfit was taken back to Carson City, the instruments and wagons stored, and the animals quartered for the winter. While this was being done, the magnetic elements were determined on three days with theodolite magnetometer No. 17 and dip circles No. 23 at Carson City, in the grounds of the" Pavilion," and in the meridian of the transit of Mr. C. W. Friend's observatory, one square south. The station was marked by a stone .with a drill hole in the top. The magnetic elements were also determined on three days at the Lakeside Tavern, southeast end of Lake Tahoe, at a point 25 meters due s<>uth of the longitude pier of 1893, with the same ihstruments, just after. the station at Carson City was completed. The season closed and the party was disbanded on November 27, and Mr. Fairfield and I started to Washington on December 8, after getting the records in shape at the suboffice in San Francisco.

Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D. C. SIR: You will please make your arrangements to resume the survey of the California and Nevada oblique boundary, beginning at the point where of>erations were suspended lilst Season. The plan of operations will be the same as that of last season, except that it is not considered necessary at this time to determine longitude, latitude, and azimuth at the railroad crossing, since it is not required for the successful prosecution of the survey. A tape-line base, however, is to be measured at the railroad crossing and connected with the triangulation. Assistant W. B.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

Before leaving Washington for the West in 1895 I had written to Professor Davidson, who was in charge of the suboffice at San Francisco, and requested him to secure for me a few trustworthy men; consequently we were not long detained in San Francisco, but on June 3 proceeded to Carson City, Nev., where th~ outfit was stored and the animals had been left for the winter. A few days were spent in shoeing the animals, repairing wagons, harness, and making other preparations for the season's work, and then the party started for Bertrand's ranch, near Benton, Cal., at the crossing of the Carso.n and Colorado Railroad, near the end of the 1894 work, about 160 miles distant. As the animals were fresh from the pasture the journey was made by easy stages to prevertt making the shoulders of the mules sore and in order that the teams might be in good working condition upon reaching the 5cene of operations. About a week was consumed in making the drive. Our outfit comprised two 6-mule wagons, one thoroughbrace drawn by two mules, and two double buckboards, five saddle and pack animals in addition, making twenty-three animals and twelve persons in the party. Three other mules were purchased during the season. The buckboards proved to be a most serviceable addition to the outfit. With them, by using the large wagons as the bases of supply, camps were made in difficult· places for a short time, and the pack animals were emplOyed where the buckboards could not travel:.
2.

BASE AND AZIMUTH, WHITE MOUNTAINS.

The party reached the starting point on June 13. Next day preparations were made for measuring a base with.a steel tape and an azimuth for the triangulation. Azimuth was measured at T 59, on Polaris, June 14 and 15 with_ theodolite No. 82, xo-inch Gambey, time being determined with the same instrument and with theodolite No. 159, a 7-inch Buff and Berger. On Sunday night, June 16, the base was measured twice with 100-meter steel tape No. 153, using a straight reach of the railroad and laying the tape along the rails. This base was l 080·14 meters in length; the temperature was noted by two thermometers laid on the rail. The base was connected with the triangulation by Assistant Fairfield, who occupied several points to the northwest for this purpose. The organization of the party was in three sections similar to that of last season. 'l'he triangulation, topographic sketching, and magnetic observations were placed in charge of Assistant W. B. Fairfield. The forward section, for ranging out the line, was under Assistant A. L. Baldwin, who cooperated with me directly by going ahead and selecting the location of points on ridges or at the proper distances in the valleys. The direct ran~ng out and interpolating points was under my charge.
3. CROSSING THE WHITE MOUNTAINS, FISH LAKE VALLEY, SYLVANIA MOUNTAINS, GRAPE VINE MOUNTAINS.

The first station occupied by me for ranging out the line was T 60 (see illustration No. 42), the most southeastern point located. during the preceding season on the bold north front of the White Mountains, which stand across the line as a formidable barrier about 13 ooo feet above sea level. It is an exceedingly difficult station to . rea~h, owing to its altitude and precipitous sides. The .footing is very insecure in many places, on account of loose sand, and the difficulties were increased by the

APPENDIX NO. 3.

BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA.

303

rarefied atmosphere. On Monday, June r7, a start was made for the summit, and camp was pitched at night at the highest water that could be found, in a little spot made green by the melting sno~. Next morning we moved upward, slowly, as far as the animals could be induced to go, then, dividing the load between three of us, we reached·the station after five hours arduous climbing, where it was necessary to shovel away the snow in order to get a forward sight. Patiently we waited for the heliotrope to flash from the forward· party, and at last when it came they were on the wrong mountain, about 3 miles too close. It was too late for them to climb the next mountain that day, so there was nothing left us but to descend to our camp and repeat the trip. When the ascent was made the next day the forward party was seen to be on the right mountain about 9·7 miles southeast in an air line, but as this station was 9 286 feet above the sea and the climb above the valley was about 4 ooo feet, it was slow work for them and they were not in place until the afternoon, when a point was lined in at T 64 and two of us packed to the animals the observing tent and theodolite before dark and spent the night at our· improvised camp. Next day the pack animals were brought over from the Queen mine and all of.the effects were moved back to Bertrand's ranch, where the large wagon had been left. By getting 'an early start and driving late the team was able to move in one day as far as McNett's ranch, nearly 40 miles, and not very far from T 64. Next day we went to a running stream for camp and carried the theodolite up to T 64, and a point was lined in back at T 61, about 6·6 miles to the northwest. This was on June 22, and from this time until July, 4, points were lined in from T 64 back to the northwest and all across the Fish Lake Valley as far as T 79 in the Sylvania Mountains, nearly 37 miles to the southeast. When the outfit was moved from T 64, we went to Piper's upper ranch, Oasis, Cal., near the south end of Fish Lake Valley, where the forward section was waiting for us. Beyond the Sylvania Mountains is a region difficult to operate in on account of the scarcity of water and provender. After due consultation, Mr. Baldwin started on an ex.ploring expedition through this region on July 7, and I moved up to T 79 with the theodolite so as to be ready for the forward ranging. Mr. Baldwin flashed a heliotrope from the big.best point of the Grape Vine Mountains on the 1 rth, 40 miles distant, but it was too late in the day to get a point, and one could not be located until the 15th, near T 89, owing to scarcity of water and long distances from his ha~ of supplies. In the meantime I was able to line in points near by and to make reconnaissance and erect signals for the triangulation. The forward party, after putting in two intermediate points, returned from their expedition on the i9th, and it was then decided to bring up the triangulation and get the entire party together before advancing through the region to the southeast. Mr. Fairfield was carrying the triangulation over the White Mountains, and, while I worked from T 79 to the northwest, Mr. Baldwin operated about 20 miles northwest of me and formed a junction with Mr. Fairfield. We were thus able to put three triangulation parties in the field. Arrangements were also made for sending hay and grain to the southeast, a very necessary precaution, as it bad to be hauled from Fish Lake Valley. An extra 6-horse team was hired for this purpose, because our own teams were utilized in distributing

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

provender to the different mountain stations and hauling supplies from the railroad at Bishop. By August 10 the triangulation had bee_n brought up, provender sent to the southeast, and the parties moved in the same direction.· Poillts having been lined in at T 85 and T 86, I moved forward to the Grape Vine Mountains, passing through the head of Death Valley via Sand Spring, where Mr. Fairfield was engaged in triangulation and putting in a few line stations. The only tree at Sand Spring was a sickly mesquite that made no shade, and the extremely high temperature was most trying to the members of the party as well as to the animals, which were exposed to the broiling sun. The first water beyond Sand Spring is at Staininger's ranch. A second ranch owned by the same man is nearer the Grape Vine Mountains closer to the boundary line. There was a small supply of alfalfa hay at this place, making it a good base from which the work could be conducted. The party remained there until all of the back triangulation was brought up and a forward point lined in for advancing across the Grape Vine Mountains. Although the next spring in the Grape Vine Mountains was less than ~ day's travel by trail from Staininger's, it required three days to get the teams around, and a distance of 65 miles was traversed. The route wasfrom Staininger'.s to Thorp's mill, 18 miles; thence to Oasis, Nev., or Beatty's, 28 miles; thence to Big Springs about 19 miles,. up in a canon just at the east foot of the sharp summit called "Nye" in our triangulation, the next to the highest in the Grape Vine Mountains. Grain and hay were sent in advance to this spring, the party reaching there on September 5, moving up from Beatty's ranch with buckboards and pack animals, so as to leave the big teams available for hauling supplies. From here the ranging was advanced to the southeast end of the' Great Amargosa Desert, T 90 having been put in from T 89, T 91 from T 90, and T 92 from T 9z. T 92 was a very commanding station. From it points were lined in all across the desert as far west as T 105, about 6o miles distant, the farthest point reached during the· season, being on the mountain range dividing Ash Meadows from Pahrump Valley, called by Von Schmidt Chung-up, or Waterless Mountains. Upon leaving Big Spring the party moved to Oasis, Nev. (Beatty's ranch), and then 8 miles to the next running water. From there it was 40 miles to a water hole, near'franklin Well, dug in the old bed of the Amargosa River, which comes out in Death Valley. Most of this distance is through deep sand, making it a trying trip for the mules with a heavy wagon. Mr. Baldwin had preceded the main party to the water hole and cleaned it out as well as dug it deeper so as to get an abundance of water. While waiting for me to come up he made a reconnaissance, erected signals, and selected a base for checking the triangulation. Upon reaching this place it was decided to close the season's operations after bringing up the triangulation and measuring a base and azi_mutb, because it would have required more than a month to complete another reach of the line, and funds were not sufficient for that purpose. Accordingly, while Mr. _Fairfield was bringing the triangulation through the Grape Vine Mountains and the Little Amargosa Desert, Mr. Bald'.yin undertook the central portion and I executed the triangulation at the southeast end as far ru; T' 105 high, the farthest point in the scheme to the southeast, nearly 275 miles from the shore of Lake Tahoe.

On October 4 1 with the assistance of Mr. Baldwin, a base of 1 494·9 meters in length was measured twice, at night, with Ioo-meter steel tape No. 153, over rolling · ground near the southeast end of the Great Amargosa Desert. I also measured an azimuth at T IOI east, on October 8 and 9, using "Polaris at any hour angle," with Buff and Berger theodolite No. I59· All of the triangulation was completed by October Io, and arrangements made for starting toward the· railroad at Bishop, Cal., by October I4. The route was from Franklin Well (or rather a water hole southeast of it) to Oasis, Nev., "lower water," 40 miles; thence to the "upper water," 8 miles, where one day was spent in getting our effects loaded. From there to Thorp's mill, 28 miles. The water at this well was very bad at that time, but since then the mill bas been repaired, the well cleaned out and found to contain excellent water, but no provender is to be had there. The next stopping place was Lida, 35 miles, where there is good well water, but a very uncertain supply of provender. A small store at this place keeps a few supplies for miners. The next move was to Fish Lake Valley, Oasis, Cal., or Piper's ranch, 24 miles, where all kinds of supplies may be procured; provisions in small quantities, bay in abundance, and generally grain. From Thorp's mill a light team may proceed over the mountain grade by State Line Mills, near Orien.tal post-office, to Tule Cafion, Pigeon Springs, and Palmetto to Piper's ranch. From Piper's it is 40 miles to Big Pine and.15 miles farther to Bishop. Good water is found at Gill~ert's, 12 miles from Piper's, an'd, also, at the tollgate on the pass Io miles from Big Pine. We reached Bishop, I90 miles from Franklin Well, on Su~day, October 20. Here the animals were p~t out for the winter, the wagons stored, and the rest of the outfit was taken to Carson City by rail to be overhauled. We were in Carson City on the night of October 23. As many of the men as could be spared were discharged; the others were set to work overhauling, repairing, and oiling the harness, saddles, etc., and making out the inventory.
· 5. ·MAGNETICS AT LAKE TAHOE AND CARSON CITY.

As Mr. Fairfield found it necessary to reoccupy some of the triangulation points' on Lake Tahoe, I mad~ use of this opportunity to redetermine the magnetic elements at the magnetic station established in I 894 near Lake Side Tavern, southeast end of Lake Tahoe, 25 meters due south of the longitude pier. This magnetic station was marked by a block of granite standing 10 inches above ground with cross lines cut on top. All of the magnetic elements were determined on three days with theodolite magnetometer No. 20 and dip circle No. 21. After this the magnetic elements were determined on three days in the '' Pavilion '' grounds, Carson City, at a new station establisht!d about 50 meters east of the I894 station, so as to be free from the influence of the railroad track. Azimuth was observed at this station on one night, and a meridian line m1uked with two cut granite blocks, 8 by 8 by 30 1nches, with a deep cross on top, in the Pavilion grounds, which is county property, and therefore may be preserved. By the time this work was done, Mr. Fairfield had completed his ob5ervations on Lake Tahoe, and after duplicating the records the final start was made on the night of November I2 1 and I proceeded to Washington and reported to the superintendent.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

The work done by Assistants Fairfield and Baldwin can not be commended too highly. They were practically in charge of their sections, dependent upon their own good management and intelligence for subsisting their men and animals and executing the work, which was done in most satisfactory manner. Their cooperation in the work was always cordial and effective.
F. FIELD OPERATIONS OF I898--<;9.

There were several reasons for not resuming work on the boundary line until 1898, the chief of which was the small amount of money available for this survey. Owing to the intense heat during the summer along the southern part of the line, it was considered more advantageous to execute the work during the fall, winter, and spring. After running the random line and triangulating it to obtain the length, it was necessary to correct the line back to Lake Tahoe on the supposition that the random would not strike the terminal post at the southeast end near the Colorado River. It was, therefore, not advisable to undertake the survey until the funds were sufficient to do all of this. Under any circumstances it was necessary to take the outfit back over the line as far as Bishop to winter the stock, so it would have been bad management to return and not work back. This working back or correcting the line made it necessary that the party should be provided with not less than $10,000, and until 1898 that sum was not available.

ORGANIZATION OF PARTY AND TRAVELING TO THE FIELD.

As a preliminary step toward the resumption of the California and Nevada oblique boundary survey, I went to San Francisco on October I, from Utah, and after the end of my leave of absence, October 15, was engaged in making preparations for field work. Assistant W. B. Fairfield, who had been engaged in primary triangulation in southeastern California, found me in San Francisco. Mr. Frank W. Edmonds, who was made an assistant in July, 1899, was also added to the party. A few trustworthy men of long experience in our survey work were engaged in San Francisco, and on October 20 the party left for Carson City, Nev. Reaching Carson City the next day, the work of overhauling the outfit, selecting and shipping it from the storeroom, occupied us until the 22d. On Sunday, the 23d, the party went by rail to Bishop, Cal., where the animals were in pasture and the wagons had been stored in 1895. We reached Bishop October 24, and were employed until the 30th in shoeing the animals, repairing the wagons, getting supplies, and perfecting arrangements for taking a large party through 210 miles 'of country, for the most part desert, uninhabited, and with but few watering places. The start on the long journey was finally made on October 31. The party consisted of 11 persons, 2 6-mule wagons, 1 thoroughbrace and 2 double buckboards, besides 5 saddle horses and 3 extra pack mules, a total of 26 animals. There were two additions to the party later on, making 13 persons in all. The experience gained in former seasons was of use in making this trip. As the animals were fresh from pasture they could not be driven hard at first for fear of making their shoulders sore and breaking them down. Moreover, the distances traveled were, to a great extent, regulated by the watering places. Once only 8 miles were traveled; another day it was necessary to make 35 miles; after several hard days in succession the teams were allowed to rest an extra day, so it was not until the morning of November 12 that the party reached the scene of operations, after a journey of nearly 210 miles from Bishop. The organization of the party was similar to that of the preceding season, viz, the ranging section under my immediate charge, the forward section under Mr. Frank W. Edmonds, and the triangulation under Assistant W. B. Fairfield. All three sections assisted in this last work according to the need of bringing it up' with the ranging of the line.
3. ASH MEADOWS, STEWART VALLEY, PAHRUMP VALLEY.

The first working cari1p was at Mound Spring, near the southeast end of Ash Meadows, on the road to Pahrump Valley, and 6 miles north of the last station located in 1895, called T 105, which was the first to be occupied this season as a ranging station. Arrangements were made to have hay and grain hauled to this spring from Manse, a ranch in Pahrump Valley, 24 miles southeast. This ranch supplied the party with hay and grain for 100 miles, and without it we would have incurred heavy expense in hauling supplies from the railroad and from Fish Lake Valley by team. On Sunday, November 14, with one member of the party I went over the line to the northwest, putting up signals for back ranges at T 103 and T 101, the latter nearly 16 miles from T 105. On the 14th the theodolite was moved to T 105 and mounted for ranging in line points to the southeast. The same day the forward section went over the mountain to Stewart Valley to get a point. The distance driven. was very great and

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

the mountains exceedingly rough, so it was not until late in the afternoon that the heliotrope was seen about 3 miles away along the mountain top. Unfortunately the sun was cut off by a near mountain before the position could be obtained, and the forward section had to drive until r r o'clock that night before reaching a stopping place. Next morning the forward party gave two points in line to the southeast, T ro7 and T 108, 7 and ro miles away.
4. MESQUITE VALLEY, STATE LINE MOUNTAINS, IVANPAH VALLEY.

In the meantime Assistant Fairfield, who had gone forward to reconnoiter and erect signals for triangulation, was lined in at 'I' 106, 3 miles distant on a very rough mountain, using a pole for that purpose. Point after point was ranged in up to T n6, 34.·5 miles distant, on a small ridge at the south end of Pahrump Valley. The ridge cut off all view across Mesquite Valley, but did not obscure the State Line Mountains, nearly 61 miles distant. To this place the forward section was sent, and on November 22 a point was located by heliotrope at T 123 from T ms. This was the second longest sight o~ the entire line. The theodolite was next moved ahead to T 123, passing the ranch at Manse, where Mr. Flynn joined the party and went with us to Sandy and to Bullock's Well, 6 miles from the station on State Line Mountains, where supplies bad been sent. The day after leaving Sandy the instrument was taken up to State Line Mountains at T 123, and next day Mr. Edmonds began working back to the northwest, giving me a point in line near Sandy post-office, about 14 miles distant. Mr. Edmonds himself first went to T r 16, 26 miles away, to enlarge the signal and to show a heliotrope in line, so as to make sure of an object to point on for the back ranging. By November 30 all of this portion of the line had been completed back to T u7, after which Mr. Edmonds went to the southeast in Ivanpah Valley. On December 2 and 3 four points were lined in to the southeast-T 125, T 126, T 127, T 128. On. Decembers it was cloudy, and no ranging could be done without sunshine, but angular measures were made for triangulation at T 123, and Mr. Flynn was engaged in erecting signals and observing angles to the northwest. On December 7 T 130, 26 miles distant, was located on the New York range of mountains near Vanderbilt, the limit of seeing to the southeast. For three days, December 8, 9, and ro, snow storms and heavy rains prevailed so that but little could be accomplished; the party not having provided stoves, suffered severely at night during this period. On December II, 12, and 13 the thermometer stood at ro 0 , 12°, and 14 ° in the early morning, temperatures rarely experienced in that southern country, according to the statement of miners.
5. DRY LAKE WELL, NEW YORK MOUNTAINS, MANVEL, CASTLE MOUNTAINS.

Before moving forward to the New York Mountains two quadrilaterals to the northwest of State Line Mountains and one to the southeast were completed by my section, to help along the triangulation. On December 20 the party moved ahead to Manvel, via Dry Lake Well, the only water on the road. On December 22 we reached Malpais Springs, on the southeast slope of the New York Mountains, and the nearest water to T 130. On the 23d the theodolite was moved to T 130 and T 131 put in. The same day from T 131 a point was located at T 132, on the lofty cliff or butte in the

APPENDIX NO. 3.

BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA.

309

Castle Mountains, 5 miles distant. On the 24th No. 132 was occupied by the theodolite and No. 133, 4 miles distant, was lined in. In order to move forward from this place to the southeast at Piute Springs it was necessary to haul hay and grain there from Manvel, and while this was being done by Mr. Edmonds, Mr. Flynn and I erected signals and observed angles in the triangulation scheme. Mr. Edmonds was ready to resume the lining in by December 30. On that date a point was lined in at T 134, and nexi: day T 135, T 136, T 137, and T 138 were set from T 132, the last being 23 miles distant. The weather continued very cold and windy all of this time.
6. MALPAIS SPRINGS, PIUTE SPRINGS.

While Mr. Flynn was left to complete some of the triangulation near Malpais Springs, and to bring forward the big team, I moved ahead in the buckboard on the east side of the Lewis range of mountains to join Mr. Edmonds with the forward section at Piute Springs, January 2, 1899. He had traveled by the western route from Manvel and it was necessary to cut away the bushes· and repair the road in the defile to the eastward at Piute Springs in order to get his team through. This was completed on the .3d, and next day while Mr. Edmonds traveled over to the Colorado River with the thoroughbrace and buckboard by the old government road, I went to the Needles on a saddle horse by the great Piute wash, and sent up hay and grain to the camp near Vo11 Schmidt's east 35° latitude post. On Friday, January 6, the big team that had been left at Malpais Springs crossed the grade and reached the camp on the Colorado River. On January 9 I went to the summit at T 138, overlooking the Colorado River Valley, and lined in T 139 and T 140. Next day, January ro, the last two points, T 141 andT 142, were lined in from T 139, and the work of ranging out the random line was completed. Six years before a post had been placed by us to mark a point on the oblique boundary nearest to the river crossing of the thirty-fifth degree of latitude. It was with some feeling of interest that this point toward which the theodolite had been directed in 1894 from a similarly placed point in the oblique boundary near Lake Tahoe, about 400 miles distant, was approached. From the lining station, T 139, it could not be seen how near the random line came to this post; but, when returning to camp, a detour was made on horseback to see what the distance was. Gradually, while drawing near, both points came into view, and upon reach~ng the place it was found that we had come within r 50· 5 meters of str'iking the point'. The line passed over altitudes varying from about 500 feet at the Colorado River to nearly 13,000 feet at the White Mountains. It was shown by the observations that the local deflections at the Colorado River end amount to about 9" · 19, 283 meters in latitude, and at the Lake Tahoe end to a greater amount. The uncertainty in azimuth at different points on the line may be great; but if so, the errors due to local deflection must have very closely balanced, as proved by the small error at the end of the line-a line ranged out and triangulated for nearly 400 miles. In 1893 A5sistant W. B. Fairfield measured a base with a steel tape at the Needles, and executed a scheme of triangulation to connect the latitude and· longitude stations at that point with the latitude station at Von Schmidt's thirty-fifth degree east-latitude post. In order to connect the triangulation brought down from Lake Tahoe with this

310

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

work a reconnaissance was made, signals were erected, and horizontal angles were observed until a junction was made with Assistant Fairfield, who was working toward the Colorado River from the northwest. This work was completed by January 24, and two days later Mr. Fairfield's section reached the Colorado River camp. ' Mr. Flynn took charge of the computations from the time of his arrival, and under his direction were placed those members of the party who could assist him, and such good progress was made that all of the adjusting was completed by February 16, about five weeks a:fter he first reached the Colorado River. During a part of this time I was engaged in sketching th~ topography of the river from Fort Mohave to the Needies on a scale of 4 ir·ho, usit:ig the stations established in 1893 and a small mountain plane table. Upon completing the computations a comparison of the work brought down from Lake Tahoe could be made with that brought up from the Needles, the line of junction being "Peak-Von Schmidt's East Lat. Post "-3 180·34 meters in length.

When it is considered that the scheme of triangulation along the line was inferior in character, the sides of the triangles varying from less than a mile to 10 miles in length, the angles measured with theodolites having circles 6, 7, and 10 inches in diameter, using 12 repetitions chiefly, upon signals of poor quality, not waiting for favorable conditions, but observing at any hour of the day, the agreement in length (0·29 meter) and in azimuth ( 10"· 1) may be regarded as highly satisfactory. Quadrilaterals and central figures were carried from one end of the line to the other, and in no instance was a distance in the main scheme left unchecked; but in a

few cases it was found necessary to depend on concluded angles, ori account of having mistaken other objects for signals during the observations, when it would have delayed the work too much to go back for a reoccupation of the stations.
8. BASE LINES.

Two intermediate bases were measured as checks upon the t;:iangulation, which therefore depends upon four bases-the Yolo, a primary, from which, through the primary line "Lola-Round Top" (91 038·53 meters in length) was determined the first line in the scheme.

These bases give a fair distribution of checks. Two intermediate azimuths were observed, one at the White Mountain base and one near the Amargosa base, but the entire line, as ranged out by back and fore sights, depended upon the initial azimuth measured on Lake Tahoe at ''Turning point, r 894,'' where the tracing of the line was started in August, 1894.
G. THE CORRECTED LINE.

The first operation after completing the adjustment and computations of the trian-gulation was to set the terminal post, located approximately in 1893 from the field computations, in the corrected position. This was done by setting up the theodolite at '' S. E. line post of 1893 '' and laying ofI the angle to the south from the triangulation, then measuring due south r2·42 meters with a steel tape. The theodolite was then set over this corrected position, and the second point northwest nearly abreast of "N. W. line post of I 893 '' was lined in by laying off the azimuth of the line as determined by the office computation.

The terminal mark on the Colorado River is a mass of concrete 17 by 17 by 18 inches, being a portion of the old latitude pier used at the ''Von Schmidt E. Lat. post '' in l 893. This was sunk in the ground and has a drill hole in the top to mark the station. On top of this was placed a redwood post 6 inches by 6 inches by 6 feet long, marked '' s. E. LINE POST.'' It is the old post used in 1893. Around the post was built a cairn IO feet in diameter and 6 feet high. An outer circular wall of stone nearly 20 feet in diameter and 1 foot high surrounded the cairn. Four stones with drill holes were set in the ground just outside of the outer wall, two being in the direction of the line and two at right angles. From the center it isMeters.

This terminal is called No. 142 1 counting from Lake Tahoe. The .second station, called No. 141, about 2 250 meters northwest from No. i42, is marked by a drill hole in a stone set in the ground. On top of this is a redwood post 6 inches by 6 inches by 6 feet, marked "N.W. LINE POST,'' being the old post used in 1893. A cairn 5 feet in diameter and 4 feet high was built around this post. The two posts set to mark the approximate thirty-fifth degree of latitude in 1893 were moved to their correct positions also, which was 19 feet due north of the old position of 1893. The marks on these posts were not changed, but under each post was placed a stone with a dri~l hole in it, and a large cairn was built around each. The west post has a circular trench about 10 feet in diameter dug around it, in addition to the cairn.
2.

RETURN OVER THE LINE.

REDUCTION OF PARTY.

Having set all of the marks that could be conveniently reached from the camp on the Colorado River, the party began its return over the line to c~rrect it and set the final boundary marks, on Friday, February 17. There· were but few places in the first 75 miles where the offsets could be directly laid off with a steel tape. A slight move ·at right angles to the line often meant changing to a different hill, sometimes nearer and sometimes farther ahead than the station on the random line. When the ground was very rough or mountainous the new points were lined in and the corrected position of the point was located generally by angular measurements. By the end of February the party had reached Manvel on its return. It was found advisable to reduce the party at this time in order to. lessen expenses so as to leave money enough to· complete the correction of the line. Mr. Flynn was, therefore, directed to take charge of the men and outfit that could be spared, cross the desert to Bishop, Cal., about 300 miles distant, sell l l animals, one large wagon, and the thorough brace, store the rest of the outfit in the Federal building at Carson City, and report to the Superintendent in Washington. By this reduction the monthly expenses were changed from an average of $1 23r22 to $709"86 1 with 7 men and 14 animals. Such portions of the outfit as were not required in the field were shipped by rail from the Needles and Manvel to the suboffice in San Francisco. The party made rapid progress in correcting the line for the first 140 miles, because the triangulation signals were all standing and the weather was favorable. To the northwest of this, after striking the Grape Vine Mountains, bad weather prevailed. Snowstorms were frequent and the line had to be reached from springs a long distance off. Where the signals were standing, the muslin, put on three and one-half years befor~, had disappeared. When the party reached Fish Lake Valley and were working across the White Mountains, snow interfered very materially with the progress, although it was late in April. Early in May the party crossed to the north side of the White Mountains, where the altitudes were not so great and snowstorms '"'ere less frequent.
3. TERMINAL MONUMENT, LAKE TAHOE.

By gradual stages the work advanced until Lake Tahoe was reached, and there, on June 12, the stone that marked the beginning of the line on the lake shore was set in concrete, which completed the field operations. Most of the boundary positions were marked by a post-redwood, cedar, or pinewith a cairn from 3 to 5 feet high around the post. If the point fell in the desert with

no stones near, a single stone with drill hole in it was used as a ground mark, and a . mound of earth or sand was heaped around the post, with a circular trench outside. Eight of the· points, Nos. I, 2, u, 12, 13, 14, 24, and 27, were marked.with granite monuments 6 feet long, 6 inches at top, dressed.down 4 feet from the top· to 12 inches, and rough cut for 2 feet to set in the ground, weighing about 850 pounds; the top terminated in a fiat pyramid. These monuments were quarried near Carson City and dressed in one of the Carson City stone yards. The boundary posts were marked with the letters '' C'' and '' N '' on their respective sides, with the number on the northwest. The letters were made with wire nails l ~ inches long driven into the posts. On the stone monuments the letters "C" and "N" were cut, but the numbers were painted. When .the line is permanently marked the distances may be cut or cast according to the nature of the material. ·The present system of numbering the plarks is simply for the purpose of identification. On June 13 the party moved from Lake Tahoe to Carson City, and until the 20th was engaged in making the inventory, packing and shipping the instruments and other outfit to San Francisco, and completing the duplicate records .. On June 20 the animal~ and wagons were sold at public auction, and the same day I went to San Francisco with the remaining members of the party, where they were discharged. I then started for Washington and reported to the Superintendent on June 30. In former years I have had occasion to refer to the cordial and cheerful cooperation between the different members of the party, without which progress would be slow and success doubtful in work of this ·kind. Assistant W. B. Fairfield was in charge of the triangulation and he always showed .most commendable zeal and interest in executing the work. Mr. Edmonds, who was in charge of the forward section of the line work, proved equal to every emergency that arose. His work required good judgment, foresight, and many sacrifices of personal comfort to get his party through a region sparsely settled. Mr. Flynn joined the party after the work was started, and displayed great energy in taking hold of the reconnaissance, signal building, and triangulation. His principal work was in adjusting- the triangulation of the last 130 miles of the line, and this he did with mai:ked success and in a short time, considering the great mass of work involved in abstracting angles, adjusting and computing the triangle sides and geographic positions for the entire season. In 1893, topographic surveys were made at the Lake Tahoe and Colorado River termini, on a scale of n·lu-H· Only a limited area was embraced in these sheets. In 1899, to show roughly the topography, 14 sheets were used, on a scale o'f n·~inr· The work was done chiefly with a small mountain plane table, which was set up on the line and oriented by means of some of the triangulation points. The sketching was executed partly by me and partly by Mr. Edmonds. The altitudes on the sheets were obtained by vertical measures with the theodolite. No elevations on the sheets were obtained with the plane table. Many photographs were taken along the line in 1899, but most of them were injured by a era$ in the camera, due to the lofty elevation and dry atmosphere. Magnetics with compass declinometer No. 741 were observed all along the random line.

CHANGE OF AREAS.

By comparison with the Von Schmidt line the State of Neva.da gains about 321 square miles; California gains about 65 square miles; making a net gain for Nevada of about 256 square miles. Owing to the barren character of the country traversed, the change of area does not mean a material gain of taxable wealth to either State in arable 'land. As to the value of mineral wealth involved, that will depend upon future discoveries; at present there are no indications of important changes.

APPENDIX NO. 3.

BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA.

3I5

Of this sum $5 ooo was allotted to the California boundary by the Superintendent. For the years 1894 1895, 1896, 1897, and 1898 the bill was substantially the same, except as to the sums allotted. For 1899 the clause was slightly different, pr6viding1

For surveying and temporarily marking that portion of the eastern boundary of the State of California commencing at and running southeastward from the intersection of the thirty-ninth degree of north latitude and the one hundred and twentieth degree of longitude, etc., ten thousand dollars. Approved July r, 1898. '

The temporary character of the boundary marks was made necessary by the fact that the true points could not be located until the Hne had been traced through to the Colorado River and corrected back along its entire length to Lake Tahoe, and by that time not only was the fiscal year nearly ended, but the appropriation was almost exhausted.
COST.

The cost of the California-Nevada oblique boundary survey, excluding the salaries of the Coast and Geodetic Survey officers engaged upon it, was as follows:

A number of the animals were supplied by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, as they were already on hand, and these were sold at the close of the work in l 899 with the others purchased for the boundary work; but it is proper to state that some of the tents were paid for out of the boundary allotment, which partly offsets the animals sold. The total. length of the line from the beginning in Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River terminus is very close to 405 statute miles, and the cost per linear ·mile was f,76'20. This cost would have been very materially reduced if the appropriation had been sufficient to execute the work with one organization of the party and with no necessity for keeping the animals between seasons. The party was organized and put in the field four separate times, entailing considerable expense for traveling, expressage, and freight. Each time the men had to be trained for their duties and the animals broken in afresh with new drivers, which caused much delay in executing the work.
L. DESCRIPTION OF THE CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA OBLIQUE BOUNDARY.

Lake Tahoe l~es in the heart of the Sierra Nevada Mountains at an altitude of nearly 6 224 feet, surrounded by summits that rise from a few hundred feet -to about 5 ooo feet above the lake surface, or approximately l l ooo feet above the sea. The

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

loftier summits are usually snow-capped until midsummer, but there are sheltered spots where the snow remains during the entire year. From the lake shore the ground rises gradually, or is nearly level for a short distance, except where the bold cliffs come down to the water's edge. Some of this ground is cultivated where sufficient water is furnished by the mountain streams for irrigation. A luxurious growth of pine, fir, tamarack, and cedar covered nearly all of this region thirty years ago, but the greater part of this has been cut to supply the mines at Virginia City and other places with timber, and for general building purposes. Many of the mountains were entirely denuded and the lower lands have left on them little that is valuable for timber. The lake is about 20 miles north and south and 12 miles from east to west. About 3~ miles from the south shore of Lake Tahoe, a little east of the upper Truckee River, and 2 miles frol!l the east shore, between Zephyr Point and '' Folsoms Knob,'' or ''Round Mound,'' the one hundred and twentieth meridian west from Greenwich intersects the thirty-ninth parallel of north latitude, and this intersection marks the beginning of the oblique boundary. The water reaches a depth of something like 1 300 feet at this place. (See ill. No. 3, diagram of depths.) Running to the southeast from the starting point on an azimuth of 311° 14' 36 11 ·6, the line strikes the shore after traversing the water for a distance of 3 '6 miles. 1The first stone, called No. 1 (distance 3·6 miles from the one hundred and twentieth degree of longitude and the thirty-ninth degree of latitude, altitude 6 230 feet), is a granite monument 6 feet high, of which 2 feet are in the ground near the shore of the lake on a firm strip of sandy soil about 5 feet above the surface of the water. This strip is from 20 to 60 meters wide, running parallel to the shore, covered with thin grass and a few forest pines. Beyond this is a narrow belt of pines and tamaracks, then a marshy place covered with good grass, then a second narrow belt of pines and tamaracks, followed by a sandy reach, gently rolling, with a few bushes and sage brush upon it, up to the azimuth station of 1894, 460·7 meters distant from No. I, which is still marked, as it it was then, by a block of granite projecting about a foot above ground with a copper bolt in the top. Three distinct shore lines are found northwest of the azicuth station. From this point to No. 2, which is located on the west side of the road between Bijou and Hobart, the soil is sandy and covered with large timber, partly cut out. No. 2 is a granite monument like No. 1, distant 838'6 meters.from it. Crossing the road the line traverses ground from which the first growth of trees was cut, but there are small ones left; then continues over gently rising ground broken by granite-covered hillocks until, at a distance of 1 ~ miles from the lake and about 600 feet altitude above the lake, the abrupt sides of the steep mountains are reached. From here to No. 3-distance, 1·9 miles, altitude, 9 019 feet on the, west top of the mountain-the original forest has not been cut. Between No. 3 and No. 4 it is only 263 ·4 meters. The line is still in timber, rising over rough bowlders. No. 3 and No. 4 are marked _by pine posts, with cairns. From No. 4 to No. 5 (not corrected on account of deep snow; it should be moved 1·11 meters northeast) the distance is 988 ·6 meters. The line crosses a level reach thinly covered with trees, then rises at No. 5 to 9 517 feet. From No. 5 the line crosses a hollow, then ascends to an altitude of 9 475 feet to No. 6-distance, 652 meters. (No. 6 not corrected on account of deep snow; it should go 1 ·26 meters northeast.) From No. 6 the line crosses another deep hollow to No. 7, 604 meters distant, altitude, 9 340 feet.

No. 7 is on a large rock just at the foot and on the northeast side of a cliff on the backbone leading up to Monument Peak. The line then descends obliquely across the mountain to Carson Valley along the rough, wooded mountain side to No. 8, 4·6 miles; altitude, s 2I4 feet. This point is 4 303 f'eet below the high summit at No. 5, which is only 5 ·4 miles northwest. Near No. 8 the timber is thin and small. Beyond No. 8 the line crosses a ravine with running water in it to sandy soil covered with sagebrush, gradually rolling and sloping to the east to. No. 9, distant I' I miles; altitude, 4 834 feet. Fay's red barn is nearly east. From No. 9 it is still in sagebrush, soil sandy and covered with bowlders to No. IO, 0·9 mile distant, 4 866 feet altitude. Fay's red barn is nearly north; the schoolhouse is northeast. Leaving No. 10 the line crosses stony and sandy soil covered with sagebrush for 0.87 mile to No. II, 4 8oI feet altitude. This point is in the forks of the road and a short distance south of Baldwin's house. A cut-granite monument with broken top, held in place by means of hoop iron, and a cairn around it, marks the point. From here the line crosses sagebrush for a short distance, then enters the pasture land and, continuing in it for 1 ~ miles, passing a short distance west of H. Godecke's ranch in the valley to No. 12, distant I '4 miles; altitude, 4 847 feet. Deluchi's barn is east. No. I2 is a cut-granite monument lilre No. l, nearly in the east fence line of the road that runs north and south. From No. 12 it is 0·35 mile across sandy soil covered with sagebrush to No. 13, also a cut-granite monument like No. I .on the west bank of the west fork of the Carson . River. The altitude isA 848 feet. Deluchi's parn is nearly north. Crossing the river the line traverses a pasture field, then up a sagebrush ridge to N'o. 14; altitude, 4 980 feet; distance, o·6 mile. This is also a cut-granite monument like No. I, and between two roads in the valleys northwest and southeast. Still traversing sagebrush the line·crosses a road in a small valley, rises over a hill, cross.es another valley, then ascends to No. IS on the west slope of a thickly-wooded hill covered with sagebrush to No. I6, I "64 miles distant, altitude 5 460 feet, marked by a post with a cairn around it. From No. I 5 the line descends into the valley of a creek called the Middle Fork of the Carson, crossing a road, to No. I6; marked by a post and cairn on the southeast side of the stream in meadow land, 0·45 mile distant, a])out one-half mile north of Gallanar's house. Leaving No. I6 the line crosses a fence with a road alongside at the foot of a hill, and ascends through scattered pines to No. 17, 1·06 miles distant, and 5 815 feet altitude. From No. 17 it passes through scattered pines, descending, crossing a road, and after going down a steep declivity strikes the East Fork of the Carson River at No. 18 on the southeast side in the fence line of Kelley's ranch on the southwest side of the road, r ·2 miles distant, and 5 104 feet altitude. The mark is a post within a cairn not far from the bank of the river. After crossing the road leading to Kelley's house near by, the line rises rapidly through dense pines to No. 19, a bold rocky summit, 0·72 mile distant, altitude 6 027 feet, marked by a post in a pile of stone. Following along the edge of the mountains over very stony ground covered with sagebrush and a few pines, on the west slope of a reddish, rocky bluff is No. 20, disttmt 0·7I mile, marked by a post in a pile of !'tone. From this place there is a steep descent to Bryant Creek, passing O'Reilley's ranch on the northeast side of the house; then up the mountain halfway to the top on the southwest slope is No. 21, 1 ·77 miles distant, and 6 323 fee\ altitude.

COAST A.i.'{D GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

Following the mountain side for half a mile the line first crosses a deep ravine, then rises over a ridge covered densely with pine, crosses a second ravine, another ridge, bare except for sagebrush, then descending and again ascending for more than a mile, at a distance of 2·86 miles it reaches No. 22, altitude 7 613 feet, on the west slope of the high east and west ridge overlooking the narrow valley of Mountaineer Creek. It is marked by a post of mountain mahogany set in a large cairn. Crossing an irregular plateau covered with sagebrush, a few scattered cottonwoods and pines, for 2·6 miles, altitude 7 523 feet, No. 23 is found on the east slope of a bold mountain mass overlooking Alkali Lake, Antelope Valley, and Holbrook. It is marked by a pine post in a large cairn northeast of a thick growth of mountain mahogany. From this point the descent is very precipitous, being more than 2 ooo feet, to the cut-granite monument marking No. 24, 1 ·9 miles distant on the northwest side of the stage road from Coleville to Holbrook, and about one-fourth mile northwest of Alkali Lake. Just across the lake on a bold hill without timber and very conspicuous from all points, at a distance of 1 ·45 miles, and 5 304 feet altitude, is the large cairn with a post in it marking No. 25. Following the sage brush-covered hills for nearly a mile, the line crosses the road from Coleville to Wellington, then enters the meadow land, which is marshy for the first half mile and firm beyond, to No. 27, where a cut-granite monument was placed on the west bank of the West Walker River, 2·32 miles distant, and 4 936 feet in altitude. This is the last cut-stone monument; the other marks are posts in cairns or mounds. The stream makes a sharp bend, running north and south, here, and there is a small island that divides the waters. A mound of earth was built around the stone, outside of which was dug a deep circular trench. About one-fourth mile southwest is the fence of Thomas Rickey, the great cattle owner, who controls nearly all of the land in Antelope Valley, cultivating alfalfa and sometimes harvesting 5 ooo tons of hay. None of the land in Antelope Valley crossed by the line is under cultivation. No. 26 was only a temporary station, not marked. From No. 27 the line crosses bottom land for a considerable distance, then rises through sagebrush to No. 28 2·32 miles distant; altitude, 5 112 feet. No. 283/z is to mark the crossing of the Wellington and Topaz road, 494·5 meters distant, and through sagebrush. The line rises over the sagebrush slope to the foothills of the Sweetwater mountains and strikes a wooded ridge covered with nut pine at No. 29, distant 4 "66 miles from No. 28 Yz; altitude, 7 480 feet. At an altitude of 7 963 feet, and a distance of 2 · 32 miles, the line reaches No. 30, on a bare ridge, except sagebrush.. It then crosses a wooded ridge, a second valley, then ascends to an altitude of 8 643 feet at No. 31, 1;25 miles distant. . From this point the line descends into the rough ravine of Desert Creek, threefourths of a mile distant, crosses a low ridge into a small valley, which it traverses for 2 miles, and then begins the steep ascent of the ''Middle Sister,'' in the Sweetwater mountains, crossing on the east slope over very rough, loose stone until it reaches No. 32, distant 3·85 miles, and at an altitude of ro 556 feet. The northwest slope has a belt of pine trees, but the suomit is loose stone. Von Schmidt placed a small flag pole farther up the backbone to the southwest, which was in good condition after twenty years' exposure to the weather. A large cairn is also on the summit nearly 1 o feet high, built of fiat stone carefully laid. This is about one-fourth of a mile southwest of No. 32. The undergrowth on the summit is Manzanita.

From No. 32 .the line descends rapidly, crosses a ravine, then rises over a rough ridge about a mile southeast, then strikes the northeast slope of a bold spur, from which it descends into the Sweetwater Valley and follows across it through sagebrush to No. 33, at an altitude of 6 986 feet and 5 ·26 miles distant. This station is at a fence corner. Two miles northwest of this, or 54 · 3 i:niles from the intersection of 120° and 39° in Lake Tahoe, is the crossing of the Von Schmidt line of 1873, which runs on the northeast side for 277 miles before the second crossing in Mesquite Valley southeast of Sandy post-office. About 1 ?( miles southeast of No. 33 is a faint road along a fence, running to the old Clinton mines. Nearly one-half mile beyond it crosses Sweetwater Creek, and soon afterwards begins to rise to No. 34, which is on the ridge with a few scattered pines 3 ·3 miles distant; altitude, 6 530 feet. From No. 34 the line ascends to No. 35, on a wooded ridge 0·38 mile distant, and 6 444 feet altitude. This point is less than half a mile distant from the Bridgeport road running on the southwest side of the East Walker River. Crossing this stream the line rises over a broken country to No. 36, 3·46 miles distant, altitude 7 259 feet, on a ridge densely covered with a small growth of nut pine. A Von Schmidt cairn is a short distance northeast. The line next crosses several valleys and ridges to No. 37, 2·6 miles distant, altitude 8 010 feet, nut pine and cedars abounding. Between this and the next point the country is very rough, rising to an altitude of 8 348 feet at No. 38, 1 ·6 miles distant. It is 3 ·07 miles to No. 39 and the country is very rough over the mountains, crossing a creek three-fourths of a mile southeast of No. 39, where the altitude is 8 009 feet. About 200 meters northeast of No. 39 is an old Von Schmidt post marked 278 miles. From No. 39 the line descends into a valley, crosses a ridge and also Rough Creek 2 miles distant, then rises up over the bold bluff and at No. 40 reaches an altitude of 8 954 feet, 3·5 miles distant, on Beauty Peak, which is bare of trees, but covered with stones and sagebrush. The old triangulation station is north of this point about 200 meters. From No. 40 the line descends for I ·29 miles over rough ground and stones through sagebrush to No. 41 on the slope. Seven-eighths of a mile beyond this is the edge of a steep .bluff on the northwest side of the road from Bodie to Hawthorne near ''Sunshine" or Davidson Ranch, an old stage station. This bluff is a part of the canyon of Bodie Creek which narrows down rapidly toward Aurora, leaving scarcely enough room for a road and forming highly picturesque scenery. The southeast side is not so precipitous, but rises gradually to the west slope of Mount Brawley, one of the roughest climbs on the line, being a bold uplift of rock very dark and rounding up from the west to the northeast, where the sides are prec1p1tous. This is at an altitude of 9 247 feet at No. 42, and distant 2·31 miles. The line here is about one-eighth of a mile southwest of the Von Scdmidt line of 1873. The highest summit of West Brawley. less than one-fourth of a mile northeast, is 9 506 feet. This station is 2 '8 miles southeast of Aurora and 5 miles northeast of Bodie. The line desends from Mount Brawley over very rough ground and across a faint road about a mile distant, then going over rough hills reaches No. 43 on the northwest side of the road between Bodie and Aurora, 1 '65 miles distant.

From No. 43 the line continues to descend to the valley or desert covered with sagebrush, crosses and climbs an isolated mountain, bare except sagebrush, to No. 44 on the east slope nearly l ·79 miles distant, and 8 52 l feet altitude. Then the line descends to the valley, passes the edge of a small lake bed and climbs a wooded mountain with double top, crossing a very deep, rocky ravine on the mountain before reaching No. 45, 2·76 miles distant, and 8 179 feet altitude; the timber is pifion and juniper. From this station the hills covered with scattered nut pine continue for more than 2 miles before reaching the desert; then the line crosses a sandy reach with some nut pine and juniper for about 2 miles and strikes No. 46, ~·57 miles distant, which is about 50 meters southeast of the desert road from Aurora to Adobe Meadows and Benton, in the midst of juniper and nut pine; sandy soil: There is a gradual rise through the woods and across the hills and hollows to No. 47, altitude 7 878 feet and 2 ·29 miles distant, on a rocky, wooded ridge. It is on the east slope about 65 meters from the highest part. The next station, No. 48, 2·74 miles distant, is on a high table-land very stony on the west edge of a·lava knoll. To reach it the line crosses some very rough hills and defiles, through sagebrush and a few scattered pines and scrub junipers. The line continues over very rough and gradually ascending table-land for 0'68 mile to No. 49, which is on the northeast slope of a hump of lava. There are three of these humps close together on the ridge. The station, T 49, on the random line was on the west side of the center hump, and No. 49 is on the east side. The line descends for nearly 4 miles to the bottom of a ravine draining to the eastward into Hontoun Valley, then ascends for 2 miles over hills, all the way through nut pine and cedar to No. 5 l, 6'8 miles distant, on a nut-pine ·covered knoll. The old station, T 50, on the random line was not corrected. It should go northeast 35 ·69 meters. It is located on a small hill s~utheast of the ravine in the bottom. At the time of correcting the line it was impracticable to delay the party for the purpose of reaching this place. A dry camp would have been necessary, and the region is almost without value, being nearly inaccessible under present conditions, except for pack animals. The old point, T 50, is 4·18 miles from No. 49 and 2·6 miles from No. SL Between 51 and 52 the distance is only 0·5 mile through nut pine. Both of these stations are on the east slope of wooded ridges. From the latter point the line descends into a valley, crosses a )VOOded ridge into another valley, then up the sides of a densely wooded ridge to No. 53 on the west slope, 2·22 miles distant and 7 942 feet altitude. From this place it crosses hills and hollows through scattered nut pine, stones, and sagebrush to No. 54, 3·8 miles distant and 7 802 feet altitude. This station is on the east slope of a narrow bluff ridge very stony and with a few nut pines. The next point, No. 55, is only 0·46 mile distant and 7 789 feet altitude, on the west slope of a ridge covered with sagebrush. The next point, No: 56, is 0·66 mile distant, on the east slope of a ridge. No. 57 is only 0·28 mile distant, also on the east slope of a hill. The line now ascends to a rough plateau, then rises to No. 58 among large stones and a few scattered nut pines l ·47 miles distant and 7 092 feet altitude. The descent onward from this point is quite precipitous for a mile to the valley, then the line crosses the valley to the Carson and Colorado Rail way, 2 '98 miles distant, to No. 59, altitude 5 951 feet, which is on the noi;thwest side and 2r meters fro~ the rail-

road track. The road from Bertrand's Ranch to Queen Mine is about one-fourth mile to the northwest of this mark. All the stations from No. 47 to 58 are in the Excelsior Mountains. Rising gradually from No. 59 through sage brush for 1·9 miles, the line goes to No. 59Yz, ~ 618 feet altitude; then, in a little more than a mile, it strikes the steep ascent of the White Mountains, reaching the highest altitude along the line, about 12 930 feet, at No. 60, 4 '61 miles distant. Here it crosses in a sag between the two highest summits, a little nearer the northeast summit. The southwest summit, about three-eighths mile from the line, is the highest, being 13 465 feet. The mountain is very difficult of ascent; it is formed of light-colored gr~nite, which is rapidly disintegrating. There is no vegetation on top; only huge masses of rock and sand. The line desc;ends the steep southeast side of the mountain, then rises to T 61, 3 · 13 miles distant, and 11 323 feet altitude. This point was not corrected, being snowcovered and very difficult of access. It should go northeast 44 ·90 meters. It falls on the southeast slope of a very high summit. The next point is 3 ·35 miles distant, and 9 653 feet in altitude, falling on the east side of the mountain. T 62 High is only about 250 meters southwest of this point and should not be confounded with it. A Von Schmidt post, marked '' 333"'. 26'h.,'' is onehalf mile northeast of this station. The line continues on the rough mountain side to No. 63, distant 2·3 miles and 9 077 feet altitude. No. 64 is on a narrow, rocky ridge· nearly a mile southeast and 9 286 feet altitude. There is a deep canon northwest with running water in it, and another southeast of this station. There is a deep ravine about halfway to the next point, No. 65, which is r·36 miles distant and 8 585 feet altitude. This point falls on the southeast slope. From here there. is a descent into a deep ravine with water; then a rise to a ridge on which No. 66 is located, on the northeast slope, distant 2 ·43 miles and 7 972 feet in altitude. The line continues obliquely along the northeast slop~ of the mountain for 4·1 miles to No. 67, on the last spur of the main White Mountain Range, 6 77 r feet altitude. After a sharp descent the sandy soil of Fish Lake Valley, covered with sagebrush, is reached, and the first valley mark is No. 67 Yz, distant 4 ·4 miles and 4 986 feet altitude. About rYz miles northwest of this is the McBride post of 1865. No. 68 is in the valley, 2·1 miles distant and 4 994 feet altitude. About threefourths of a mile north, at the road crossing, is a Von Schmidt post. No. 69 is 1 '8 miles distant and 5 088 feet altitude. No. 70 is 0·71 mile dif;tant and 5 056 feet altitude. No. 7 I is 0·71 mile distant and 5 002 feet in altitude. Here was located a bench mark of the United States Geological Survey, marked "5 070 feet." The road to Leidy's ranch crosses just northwest of here. No. 72 is 2'82 miles distant and 4 982 feet in altitude. Soil still sandy and covered with sagebrush. No. 73 is 3·36 miles distant. Piper's ranch, Oasis, Cal., is 131:i miles southwest. No. 74 is 1 ·74 miles at the road crossing going to Silver Peak, altitude 5 053 feet. S. Doc. 68--2 1

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

A bench mark of the United States Geological Survey, marked "5 121 feet," was lOl:ated here. One mile east of this, on the northeast slope of a hill, is a Von Schmidt post, marked '' 363 miles.'' Oasis, Cal., is 2 miles west. The next mark, No. 75, is 2·57 miles distant. No. 76, 0·73 mile distant and 5 255 feet in altitude, just southwest of the road to Palmetto. No. 77, distant 1'22 miles, is the last point in Fish Lake Valley. All of the soil is sandy and covered with sagebrush. There are some ranches in the valley which are very productive where water can be procured for irrigation. Grain is grown to a limited extent also, but alfalfa is the principal crop. In 1895 nearly all of our provender was hauled from this valley to the southeast, as far as Oasis, Nev. The next point, No. 78, is on the first high ridge limiting the southeast end of the valley; the Sylvania Range, 3 ·36 miles distant and 6 774 feet in altitude; it is on the southwest slope. The line crosses a rough, mountainous region, high hills and deep ravines for a distance of 3·21 miles to No. 79, 7 927 feet iu altitude, in a sag of the ridge, with some nut pines growing on it. The old Sylvania mining camp, now abandoned, is a mile _north. There are a few springs through this region known to the ranchers and miners. Less than three-fourths of a mile southeast is a wash or cafion, probably l ooo feet deep and half a mile wide, which leads up to the northeast about half a mile beyond the line. Crossing this, the line goes over rough country, partly wooded, to No. 80, 4·87 miles distant and 6 894 feet in altitude. The drainage from here is into Death Valley. The country is still very rough, but descends to No. 81, which is on the west end of a range of hills, 6·83 miles distant and 4 270 feet in altitude. No. 82 is just southeast of a big wash and the road from Tule Cafion, 2 '8 miles distant and 3 763 feet altitude. This country is much cut up by washes from the mountains on the northeast. No. 83 is just southeast of a large wash, 4·41 miles distant and 4 216 feet in altitude. The next point, No. 8~, is on a high hill, west slope, 4 766 feet in altitude and 2·14 miles distant. The terrene is extremely rough between the next t\~'O points, No. 85 being on a hill, 5 197 feet altitude, I ·23 mile distant. Continuing on the same rough mountains, No. 86 is on the east side of the summit of a symmetrical hill, 5 698 feet altitude and 4 ·25 miles distant. Crossing a valley and going up a steep slope, No. 87 is found on the east side of a hill covered with yucca, 1·l3 mile distant and 5 444 feet in altitude. The line goes over rough hills and ravines and washes to No. 88, 5 ·47 miles distant and 4 260 feet in altitude, on the rocky hill southeast of the road from Staininger's to Thorp's mill. In·order to reach the region from No. 81 to No. 84, Sand Spring was used as a water and supply place. The water at Sand Spring, running through grass, has a taste of the roots and is not very wholesome without being boiled. Staininger's ranch, about 20 miles southeast of this place, was the base for reaching all the stations between No. 85 and No. 89, inclusive. There is an abundance of water of good quality, though warm when it emerges from the ground, and a few acres of good ground have been placed under cultivation. Afalfa grows luxuriously, but one can not depend on finding

provender at this place except during the summer and early fall when the hay is being harvested. It is not practicable to reach the stations in this region, except No. 82, with teams; only saddle and pack animals can be utilized. The foot of the hill below No. 88 being close to the road, the station is accessible. Between No. 88 and No. 89 the line crosses a very rough region for 5 ·64 miles over ravines, washes, and canons, the foothills of the lofty Grape Vine Mountains. The altitude of No. 89 is approximately 7 ooo feet. it is located on a precipice fully r ooo feet above the gorge to the northeast. The boundary mark is about 300 feet lower than the random line point, T 89. The point called T 90 on the random line is 4 miles from No. 89. It falls on the west slope of the main peak of the Grape Vines on top of a cliff about 80 feet above the valley or ravine below. It was not changed, but should go northeast 77"70 meters to bring it on the boundary. It will be necessary to go to the northwest a short distance and climb the steep sides of the mountain. The altitude of T 90 is 7 800 feet; that of the main peak is 8 77 r feet. Continuing across narrow valleys, rough hills, and deep gorges for 4 "85 miles the line climbs to No. gr, 7 87 r feet altitude, on the crest of a ridge running north and south. On the west of this place is a deep canon extending toward Death Valley. On the north, then extending southeast and soutli, is a great canon, one of the roughest on the line; it divides the mountain range and winds around into Death Valley. Beyond this canon the line crosses a rough mountainous region traversed by gorges before reaching No. 92, on the west slope near the top of a smooth mountain covered with sagebrush, distant 3 ·4 miles and 7 034 feet altitude. This point commands the Little Amargosa and Great Amargosa deserts for 60 miles. For Nos. 90, 91, and 92 the Big Springs of the Grape Vine Mountains, at the east foot of the sharpest and next to the highest peak, was used as a base; only pack and saddle animals can be used. The Big Springs are reached from Staininger's by Thorp's mill, where there is a fine well of water, then to Oasis, Nev., and then doubling back west into the mountains about 65 miles from Staininger's. Between No. 92 and No. 93, 9·52 miles distant, the line crosses to the northeast slope of the Grape Vines, over a region without value, very mountainous, and with no water. Near No. 93, to the west, up the canon, are Daylight Springs. The distance from No. 93 to No. 94 is 5 "68 miles, and the line descends to 3 853 feet, crossing washes and sagebrush. From No. 94 the line crosses a rough, rolling country on the east slope of the Funeral Mountains to No. 95, distant r ·39· miles, altitude 3 899 feet. There is a considerable descent from here across a valley covered with sagebrush to No. 96, 3·57 miles distant, altitude 3 614 feet. Between No. 96 and No. 97 the country is of the same general character and the distance 6 · 1 7 miles. It is about 2·5 miles to No. 98, and nearly a mile farther to No. 98}1l, ·both on the northeast slope of the Funeral Mountains. Between these two points and to the southeast on the main slope are T 98, 2 927 feet altitude; and one-half mile southwest, T 98 High, 3 677 feet altitude. To the southeast of No. 98 }1l is a wash, then a ridge with several summits. There are many washes, some of considerable extent, leading

from the mountains on the southwest side of the line. No. 98 Yz is the last point northwest of the great Amargosa Desert. The next point, No. 99, is 5 ·I 6 miles distant and 2 349 feet in altitude, after passing through a flat sandy region covered with sagebrush and greasewood. Nearly north of No. 99 about 8 miles distant, rising sheer out of the desert, is a mass of great white sand hills several hundred feet high without vegetation, a marked feature in the landscape. No. roo is in a saddle between two low hills, the west one a dark lava formation and the east one light colored. The distance from No. 99 is 5·16 miles, the altitude 2 358 feet. The mountains are, several miles to the west of the line. Sand and sagebrush are crossed with a descending slope for 4"45 miles to No. IOI, altitude 2 271 feet. About a mile south of this in the old bed of the Amargosa River, among the mesquites, is the water hole, not far from what was called Franklin well. The water is whitish in appearance, but not disagreeable to the taste; it may be found in abundance by digging from 6 to 8 feet. Still descending, the line crosses sand, gravel, and through sagebrush and greasewood for 4·24 miles to No. 102, altitude 2 176 feet. To the south and I 464·9 meters distant is the south base, T ro2 being the north end of the base. On the northeast, about 2 miles distant, the sand hills, covered with small mesquite, begin. These extend to the west rim of the Ash Meadows. The line continues to descend to No. 103, which is the lowest monument in the Great Amargosa Desert, being y83 miles distant and 2 l I 9 feet altitude, located in a soft bed of brownish red soil, in which the animals sink from 6 to 10 inches. Half a mile to the northwest is an old stream bed covered with coarse grass, and a short distance southeast is another, draining from the eastward. The region called Ash Meadows, from the ash trees growing along the streams, lies on the southeast side of the Great Amargosa Desert. There are a number of warm springs in the meadows, of great volume, sufficient to irrigate a large area, but the amount of alkali in the soil is prejudicial to the cultivation of hay to any great extent. The grass is sufficient to support a goodly number of cattle. No. 104 is 2"66 miles distant from No. ro3, at the west end of the second range of bold hills rising out of the valley. No. 105 is on the high ridge formmg the eastern slope of the Chung Up or waterless mountains, at a distance of 5 · 11 miles and an altitude of 3 860 feet. The station is on the east side of a sag and not far from the top of the ridge, among large, fast stones. Care must be taken not to confound the three points on this top; T 105 is nearest to the sag, No. 105 up the slope to the northeast, and T 105 High still farther to the northeast and at an altitude of 3 937 feet. It is very rough, rising from the valley to No. Io5. The main summit is one-half mile west. The line runs over the rough mountains for 3 miles to No. 106, 3 358 feet altitude, located on the east ,5lope of a very precipitous black, rocky ridge, rising in sheer cliffs nearly 900 feet above Stewart Valley. Beyond No. 106 the line descends rapidly to Stewart Valley and traverses sandy soil covered with sagebrush to the old bed of a lake covered with soft, brownish soil, then along sandy soil to No. 107, 4·18 miles distant and 2 423 feet in altitude. The next mark is No. 108, 3 miles distant. The monument is on the southwest end

of a small range of mountains that bound Stewart Valley on the east. It stands up boldly on a rocky point at least 50 feet higher and 200 meters north of T I08, which is 2 484 feet in altitude. A short distance southeast the line crosses two roads running from Resting Springs to Pahrump and Manse ranches, not much used now. The line is now in Pahrump Valley, traversing sand and sagebrush for 5 miles to No. I09, 2 494 feet altitude. Pahrump Valley is lowest on the southwest side near the western mountains. It rises gradually toward the eastward in the direction of Charleston Peak, a very high summit, about 11 ooo feet in altitude, covered with some pine and \\'ith large timber pines in the ravines. A sawmill supplies lumber to the mines and the ranches in the valley. There are two ranches near the northeast end of Pahrump Valley, the one farthest north giving name to the region, and 6 miles southeast is Manse. The water supply comes from warm springs, the quantity at Pahrump ranch being sufficient to irrigate about 500 acres of land and the two large springs at Manse a like quantity. These springs have a uniform temperature of 72° and an unvarying flow the year round. There are no other iniportant springs to the northwest until Ash Meadows are reached, 24 miles. Fourteen miles south of Manse there is a ~mall quantity of water at Stump Spring of good quality, but no more until Sandy is reached, 30 miles south of Manse. Stump Spring is on the old imniigrant route from Las Vegas to California. Leaving No. I09 the line traverses sand and sagebrush to No. 1IO, 3·54 miles distant, and 2 516 feet altitude. The same character of country is found to No. 111, 3 ·93 miles distant, and 2 527 feet altitude. No. 112 is 3 ·41 miles distant, with an altitude of 2 586 feet, and from here the line runs a short mile to No. 1 13, al ti tu de 2 6 IO feet. No. 114 is 2·17 miles distant, altitude 2 647 feet, and No. II5, 2·0 miles distant, with an altitude of 2 689 feet. The character of the country is the same-sand and sagebrush. Stump Spring is 2 miles north and a little east; an old adobe hut without a roof is still standing just northeast of the spring. Leaving No. l 15 there is a gradual descent, partly through sagebrush and some bunch grass, a few sand hills and washes, to the foot of the ridge on which No. 116 is located, then a rise through thick bunch grass up the stone and gravel slope to No. 116, 3 ·3 miles distant, altitude 3 089 feet. This last point is on the northeast slope of a low ridge running across the valley, dividing it from Mesquite Valley. The low hills near No. 116 turn nearly parallel to the line and extend for nearly 4 miles to the southeast, until they connect with the high, rocky butte near the center of the valley, almost 6 miles from No. II6. A little over one-half mile east of this is the Von Schmidt 521 milepost. Crossing over the ridge into Mesquite Valley the line traverses sandy and gravelly soil covered with sagebrush and Spanish bayonet. No. 117 is on the west end of a black, rocky ridge about 3·75 miles from No. r 16, and about o·s mile northwest of T l 17andTl17 High, which are on a brown hill covered with a mass of loose stone. The al ti tu des of these latter are 2 92 1 and 2 924 feet, respectively. No. 11 7 is somewhat higher, from 5~ to 60 feet. Half a mile north of this is Von Schmidt 524 milepost. Leaving No. l 17 the line crosses a depression for over half a mile, then a narrow ridge, and near by the stony hill on which the random line points were located, then descends again into Mesquite Valley and continues through gravel, sand, sagebrush, and Spanish bayonet to No. 118, 5·49 miles distant and 2 631 feet altitude, and

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

oue-fourth mile southwest of the main road between Pahrump and Sandy. On the northeast side of this road is a region of sand hills, a few of them covered with mesquite. There are a few sand hills about a mile north of the station also; Von Schmidt 531 milepost is one-half mile east. Southeast of No. 1 r8 the line traverses sandy soil and sagebrush to No. 119, 2'66 miles distant, altitude 2 591 feet. Von Schmidt 533 milepost is one-fourth mile north, and Von Schmidt 534 milepost is a little more than three-fourths mile southeast. The line continues through sand and sagebrush to No. 120, .distant 2·13 miles, altitude 2 556 feet, on the northeast side of the road running southwest from Sandy to the mountains. Sandy post-office is 1 ~ miles northeast among the sand hills. A large quartz mill, the Keystone, was erected there years ago, which is not in use now; but there are copper mines in operation a few miles northeast of Sandy. The water here is good, being raised from a well by means of a windmill, though the quantity is limited. Von Schmidt's 535 milepost is one-fourth mile north of No. 120. The road to Manvel is about 200 meters northeast. About r 7S miles southeast t~ line crosses the Manvel road and about three-fourths of a mile farther a road branching from it to Sandy. A mass o~ sand hills is encountered about one-half of a mile northeast of No. 121, which is :~·32 miles distant and 2 584 feet altitude on a sand hill. About 1·25 miles southeast of No. 121 the Von Schmidt line is crossed a second time. The second crossing is 331 ·31 miles from the intersection of 120° of longitude and 39° of latitude in Lake Tahoe, and 277 miles from the first crossing in the Sweetwater Valley between No. 32 and No. 33. The line crosses the west slope of high ground on the northeast, full of washes and stones, and also across the upper road between Sandy and Bullock's well, less than a mile northwest of No. 122, about 3·33 miles distant and 2 551 feet altitude. Bullock's well, with alkali water fit only for stock, is 1 }'2 miles south of No. 122. There is no shelter at this place, but a good growth of· mesquite, which may be used for firewood, covers the numerous sand hills. The well is at the southeast end of the sand hills. The line continues on the west slope of the mountains across washes and stony ground covered with sagebrush, greasewood, and some Spanish bayonet, rising over the foothills, and finally crosses the main ridge of the State Line Mountains on the northeast side of the pass, above the precipitous ledges, on the southwest slope of the main ridge in a very commanding position, to No. 123; distant from :No. 122, 3·91 miles. The random-line point T 123 has an altitude of 4 342 feet. The boundary monument No. 123 is about 150 feet higher. The State Line Mountains are very striking in appearance. Some of the mass is unstratified, but most of the mountain is formed of horizontal strata from l foot to 50 feet thick, greatly eroded by weathering. Some of the strata are fossil bearing; a few of the summits pyramidal in shape, with irregular, receding steps. The line continues well on the edge of the mountain down the so~theast side, striking the southwest edge of the terminal hills in Dry Lake, until it reaches No. 12$, 5 ·75 miles distant and 2 588 feet in altitude. On the corrected line No. 124 was not necessary, and was therefore omitted. No. 125 is on the alkali flat, forming the north end of Dry Lake about a mile east of the old well (no water) where the road to Sandy, going over the divide, strikes the sagebrush at the foot of the ascent. . The road crossing the State Line pass is in very good condition, but the grade on the northwest side is steep

in places. It is about ro miles across from foot to foot. About one-fourth mile southeast of No. 125 the line crosses the road from Manvel to Good Springs, a mining camp in active operation at this time ( 1899). The ground is sandy for a short distance ::ind then is covered with stone and large bowlders, sloping upward to No. 126, y6 miles and 2 981 feet altitude. The land rises up to the northeastward. The line continues on the slope through stones and sagebrush for 4·46 miles to No. 127, which is on the southwest side of a high rocky ridge above the general level. The ridge is of black lava and very precipitous. The point on the random line T I 27 has an altitude of 3 387 feet, and No. 127 is about loo feet higher c1.nd north one-eighth mile. For a mile the line continues in the mountains on the west slope, then strikes the sloping mesa, rocky and covered with sagebrush, crossing washes and sandy soil to No. 128, 6'42 miles distant, on the west slope of the mountains. This point is nearly one-fourth mile due east of T 128 on the random, 4 075 feet altitude. T 128 High is just southwest of this, and 4 092 f~et altitude. The line crosses the west slope of the mountains over washes, stony and sandy soil, with sagebrush, for 1 ·72 miles to No. 129, on the northeast slope of a ridge. The random line point T 129, a short distance west, is somewhat higher, being 4 483 feet in altitude. The line continues on the west slope of the mesa over stones and sand through Spanish bayonet and a forest of yucca to the New York Mountains until No. 130 is reached, 4 miles distant and 5 182 feet altitude. The water for operating from No. 125 to No. 129 may be procured at Dry Lake well, of good quality, on the road from Manvel. To reach No. 130 it is advisable to go to Manvel, then to Malpais Springs, nearly two days' drive from Dry Lake well. There are three other points near No. 130, T 130 and T 131 on the random line, and T 130 High about one-fourth mile northeast. Malpais Springs are 2·5 miles south of No. 130, in a cafion, with a large stock corral and watering troughs. The line descends through the large yucca forest, Spanish bayonet, and sagebrush, across the sloping mesa for s ·13 miles to No. l 32 on a conspicuous flat-top summit in the Castle Mountains, 4 983 feet altitude. There are two of these summits close together, the line falling on the north one. The Castle Mountains have a number of peculiar rock-capped peaks like cauliflower blooms, the boldest and highest being southwest of the line. The road from Manvel to Searchlight Mines passes about a mile north. The gorge at Malpais Springs drains into the Great Piute Wash that runs into the Colorado River a few miles north of Needles via Ibex Station on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. The line traverses a rough region, hills and valleys, for 4 miles, to No. 133, on the northeast slope of a high rocky mountain. The random line point T 133 is 4 096 feet in altitude, and the line point is about 100 feet lower. For 3'5 miles beyond this the line is in the hills and then comes down into the desert, traversing it to No. 134, 9 miles distant and 2 303 feet in altitude. This point is about a mile northeast of four small buttes in the valley. Von Schmidt's 592 milepost is about 1 mile west, alongside . ·the road to Piute Springs. Between No. 134 and No. 135 the line rises on the southwest slope, through sand and sagebrush. No. 135 is 5·88 miles distant on the south end of a mass of small summits. The old station on the random line is 2 631 feet in altitude; No. 135 is lower, in a sag among the hillocks. Correcting the line threw T 136 off of the hillside into

the lowlands, and it was omitted. The line rises obliquely across the slope and ridges through sagebrush, stones, and sand to No. 137, distant 4 miles from No. 135, altitude 2 671 feet. No. 138 is only one-fourth mile from No. 137, owing to a rolling table-land. It is in a ledge of large rocks, falling in the space between two of them. The crossing of the road from Piute Springs to Fort Mohave is one-fourth mile southeast of this. No. 13876 is 0·80 mile from No. 138. The soil is sandy, covered with granite bowlders, sagebrush, and a variety of cactus. The line crosses a number of small granite hills for nearly three-fourths mile to No. 139 on a rocky granite ridge running east and west. T 140 on the random line, altitude 2 168 feet, falls on lower ground in the corrected line and was omitted, as the next, No. 141, is visible, distant 6·25 miles. Leaving No. 139 the line passes over ground covered with granite bowlders and hills with sagebrush and cactus growth. Three miles to the southeast is a spring in a gorge of the white granite formation. The vertical cliff is covered with Indian hieroglyphics near the spring; the quantity of water is small, and it runs dry some seasons. Just below the spring a broad wash is reached and then a low mesa sloping off toward the river. A quarter of a mile northwest of No. 141, altitude 821 feet, a higher mesa land is reached, formed of sand and gravel. The line from No. 141 crosses the granite hills, covered with sagebrush, to a lower mesa of stone, gravel, and sand, to No. 142, the terminal monument (distant 1·45 miles and altitude 517 feet), which is about 100 meters from the edge of the trees in the river bottom. When tracing the line Malpais Springs was used as a base for Nos. 130, 132, 133; then Piute Springs for Nos. 134, 135, 136. From the Colorado River by hauling water and making a dry camp the rest of the points, Nos. 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, and 142 were placed in position. The line descends from an altitude of about 2 670 feet at the summit of the diYide leading up from the Colorado River to 517 feet at No. 142 on the Colorado River in a distance of 976 miles. The old Government road between Fort Mohave and Piute Springs is very badly washed between Piute Springs and Manvel; crossing the pass it is very steep and rough. Manvel is the best supply point for Piute Springs, and the Needles for the Colorado River camp near the thirty-fifth degree of latitude. In reality the food supplies for the men were brought from Manvel as far northwest as Pahrump Valley, 75 miles distant. To the southeast of No. 142 the line enters the bottom land of the Colorado River, passing through mesquites, willows, and some cottonwoods over a sandy loam for 2·67 miles to the central point between the bluff banks at the crossing of the thirty-fifth degree of latitude, the terminus of the oblique boundary between California and Nevada. From Fort Mohave to the Needles the Colorado River has bottom lands from 1 to 3 miles wide, edged by bold bluffs of sand and gravel. which may be considered permanent, so little are they subject to change, except ::ouperficially through the agency of cloudbursts in the mountains, that send down the water in torrents, tearing gulches and gorges through the mesa. The river wanders from side to side through its alluvial bottom in the most capricious manner during high water, at which time most of the low land is submerged and receives a rich deposit of fertilizing material. There are a number of Mohave Indians

111. ALTITUDES.

The altitudes were obtained by observing vertical angles on Mount Grant, a primary station in the transcontinental triangulation, and on the North (Montgomery) Peak, White Mountains, the height of which was determined in the transcontinental triangulation from the primary stations-Mount Grant, Lone Mountain, and Toiyabe Dome. Neither of these stations was occupied to determine heights along the California-Nevada oblique boundary, but verticals were observed on them from different points which agreed closely. The altitudes from Lake Tahoe to T 47 and Sag depend on Mount Grant, !ind the altitudes from T 53 to the Colorado River and the Needles depend on the North Peak, \Vhite Mountains. The altitudes of these two stations can not be called final, but rather relative, as the data in hai1d is not sufficient to warrant a complete adjustment. In carrying the altitudes depending on Mount Grant (3 428 meters, 11 247 feet, Coast and Geodetic Survey register) to the northwest from T 47, the height of Lake Tahoe was found to be 6 224 feet, or I foot less than that given on the United States Geological Survey chart (6 225 feet). There is a break in the heights depending on Mount Grant toward the southeast, about 30 miles northwest of the White Mountains, and, in order to carry the heights southeast of this break, the North (Montgomery) Peak, White Mountains (4 104 meters, I 3 465 feet, Coast and Geodetic Survey register), was used. At T 74, on the random line, a Geological Survey bench mark was found with the altitude (Carson and Colorado Railroad data) 5 121 feet; carrying the levels over the White Mountains, a distance of 41 ·7 miles by vertical angles from Queen Station, this bench mark is 5 119 feet; differing fr<?m the United States Geological Survey levels only 2 feet. Queen Station, on the Carson and Colorado Railroad, is given by the railroad levels, based on the San Francisco datum, as 6 254 feet; Queen Station, by vertical angles from North Peak, White Mountains, is 6 188 feet; making a difference of 66 feet. Transferring the railroad levels from Queen Station oy vertical angles along the random line to the Needles, Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, a distance of nearly 300 miles, the altitude is 532 feet; Needles, by railroad levels from San Francisco along the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, 480 feet; difference, 52 feet. Using North Peak, White Mountains, the altitude of the Needles (by trigonometric levels) is 466 feet; difference, 14 feet.*

In 1894 the vertical measures were made with the 4-inch vertical circles (reading minute) attached to two theodolites, with 4-inch horizontal circles, by Fauth & Co. and by Buff & Berger. In 1895 and 1899 the altitudes were determined with

Round Top: Latitude, 38° 39' 4311 ·636; longitude, 120° oo' 04 11 ·997. Mount Lola: Latitude, 39° 25' 53"·342; longitude, 120° 21' 55"'4¢. Round "rap to ?tfount Loin: Azin1utq, forward, 159° 51 1 41"'6o; hack, 339° 37' 56"'02. Distance, 91 038·53 1neters; I.. og., 4·959 225 2. This was the best available information at the tim" the work was done and the computation completed. On :\larch 13 190r, the necessary connections between triangulation in widely separated localities having been made and the computations being sufficiently advanced to afford the basis for such a decision, the Coast and Geodetic Survey adopted a standard datum, to be known as the "U.S. Standard Datum," to which all geographic positions throughout the United States will be reduced, wherever possible, as rapidly as practicable, so as to make such positions strictly comparable in all portions of the country. On the U.S. Standard Datum the positions of Round Top and Mount Lola are as follows:. · Round Top: Latitude, 38° 39' 50' 1·316; longitude, r20° oo' 01 11 ·126. Mount Lola: I,atitude, 39° 26' oo'"o61; longitude, 120° 21' 51"·594. Round Top to ~fount Lola: Azimuth, forward, 159° 51' 45 11 ·92; back, 339° 37' 0011 ·33. Distance, 91 039·14 tncters; Log., 4·959 228 2. The corrections to reduce the positions here published to the U. S. Standard Datum will be of the i;ame order of magn:tude as the corrections at Round Top and Mount Lola indicated above, and \Vill not be constant from one end of the line to the other. The exact values of these corrections are not now available, and this note is inserted to prevetit the use of the uncorrected positions for geographic purposes. July 30, 1901. EDITOR.

A cut granite monument in road on southeast side fronting Lake Side Tavern, old house of Lapham, 58o meters southwest of corrected ijne. This monument was used as the starting point of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1893, for the determination of latitude and longitude (telegraphic) on account of its convenience to the telephone wire running to Carson City, which was utilized for the exchange of telegraphic longitude signals. The first point on the lake shore was established by measurement, with reference to this stone. Pine post 6 inches by 6 inches by 7 feet on foot hills, west slope, 570 metei:s southwest of corrected line. Site for Von Schmidt's iron monument, which was never set.

It is also in the latitude of Von Schmidt's east post of 1873, which is supposed to have been intended for the parallel of 35° N. latitude. A concrete pier was built in 1893, 18 inches by 18 inches by 5 feet long (3 feet above ground), 5·87 meters due west of this post for zenith-telescope No. 6. The station (post) is connected by triangulation with the astronomic station at Needles, Cal., occupied in 1889 by Assistant C. H. Sinclair.

[See illustration No. 12.]

These instruments were constructed at the Office of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in \Vashington, D. C., in 1887-88. They were made as nearly alike as possible; aperture, 3 inches; focal length, 37 inches; magnifying power about ro4; glass diaphragm with 2 horizontal and 13 vertical lines, of which l l were used for time observations, arranged in 3 tallies of 3, 5, and 3 lines each, and 2 outside lines for eye and ear observations, the star being confined between the horizontal lines while transiting; equatorial intervals about 2 ·5 seconds; diameter of pivots l ~ inches; the pivots rest along their entire length in the Ys; the azimuth and level adjustments are made at the base of the iron stand supporting the Ys; the iron stand rests upon an iron sub-base to which it is attached by 3 holding-dO\vn screws, of which 2 are in slots to permit adjustment in azimuth; the sub-base is fastened to the pier with plaster of paris or cement. Striding level of No. 18 one division equals r ·674, of No. 19 equals l ·s5 seconds of arc. For longitude work the observations are recorded on a Fauth cylinder chr011ograph (see illustration No. lJ) by means of an observing key held in the hand of the observer, who breaks the electric circuit as the star crosses each line of the diaphragm of the trat~sit. During the exchange of longitude signals the chronograph is made to revolve at double speed so that the signals may be read to o"or. A sidereal break-circuit chronometer is used to make the chronographic record at regular intervals of one or two seconds, the transits of stars being on the same sheet.

LETTER OF THE .'iUI'ENINTENDENT TO PROFESSOR DAVIDSON.
t::'NITED STATES COAST AND G1;0DETIC SURVEY, OFFICE OF THJ> SUPERINTENDltNT,

IVaslli11gton, D. C., Marc/J 8, r893. Yours relating to the proposed survey of the Nevada-California boundary line has been under consideration for some time. I submitted it to Mr. Schott; requesting him to make a full memorandum of his views on the best method of doing the work. His reply is extremely interesting, and I send you a copy of it herewith.
DEAR PROFESSOR DAVIDSON:

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1<)00.

am strongly inclined to the ''geodetic method'' of locating the line, that is, by means of a system of triangulation connecting the two eJCSre1.1ities, provi<led it <loes not prove to he too expensive. Local deflection is likely to introduce such errors into the determination of astronomical positions that the result would ne··er be entirely satisfactory. I wish you would read the paper carefully and s~nd me your views at your early convenience. In the meantime the location of the extremities of the line might be gone into. It is only the oblique portion of the line that we are required to survey. Undoubtedly the meridian north from Lake Tahoe is in error, but .the appropriation does not prodde for this. If found to be a serious matter it may be corrected in the future. \Vithin a month :.\fr. Sinclair and Mr. \Valter Fairfield will be available for this work and will be directed to report to you. l\1r. Sinclair will he in the" neighborhood" of the southern extremity of the line, and he might receive instructions to look into the matter there, as to 'the existence and whereabouts of the monument and other matters relating thereto, without reporting to you in person. He might also connect our telegraphic longitude station at Needles with the boundary point and pr.:iceed with the determination of the southern point. Mr. Fairfield might also begin operations in the vicinity of Lake Tahoe.' Here it will probably be necessary to establish a telegraph line from one of our stations to the shore of the lake, and the latitude and longitude of a point on the shore as near the presumable intersection of the boundary line as possible must be ascertained. All of this work can he done independent of any decision as to how the line itself is to be run. About $5 ooo will be available, and I would like to see it judiciously expencled before July 1. If not possible to expend all of it wisely in the field, it might be invested in material, supplies, equipment, camp, etc., which would be required after July I. I will be glad to hear from you with reference to these matters at an early date. Yours, faithfully,

T.

Dr. T. C. MENDENHALI,,

Superi11te11de11t United States Coast and Geodetic Survey.
SIR: The letter submitted to you by Assistant Davidson.on the California and Nevada line does not exaggerate the difficulties to be encountered in marking it, yet there are some points, either lightly or not at all touched upon, in that letter which I deem of importance, and beg leave to submit them for consideration. 1. LOCAL DEFLECTION. The line is to begin at the intersection of the one hundred and twentieth degree of longitude with the thirty-ninth degree of latitude, thence to run in a straiglit line to a point where the channel of the Colorado crosses the thirty-fifth degree of latitude. These termini fall in the water and are inaccessible. The first step to be taken is the fixation of two points on terra finna nearest to them and t'n the junction line. 'fo do this we have to decide whether the law contemplates astronomic or geodetic data; in·other words, is the line to be run with or witlzout local deflections, that is, is it to be a wavy and irregular line or a straight and smooth one; the law calls for a "straight Jine." Let us see, however, what these local deflections amount to; Average local deflection from 59 latitudes, Maine to Georgia.

each of two points their relative true position may be out several hundred feet, as found by their geodetic latitude and longitude; in fact, we can not get the real azimuth" and distance of the line joining them so long as they are laid down astronomically only, the local deflections being included; this is our case. \Vhat sort of a line, then, would we get by starting from an astronomical.encl point (charged with local deflection in latitude and longitude) with a local deflection azimuth and try to reach, hy alternate forward and backward sighting, the opposite end, likewise charged with local deflections, as well ·as every intermecliate point of our line where the instrument was set. up, its verticality depenrling on the local azimuth? The surveyor may find himself several hundred feet out of line and not know whether this was due to defective work or purely difference of local deflections. Suppose we have placed our two auxiliary end monuments in position ( hy astronomic or geodetic means) we must connect them by triangulation if we require to know their distance apart and direction; the mere computing based upon disco1111cctcd latitudes and longitudes will land us in the above local-deflection uncertainty. Hence to locate the line accurately clemands triangulation from one end to the other. Indeed, we have already a triangulation point-\Vhite Mountain ~ .· located by Assistant Eimbeck, in or close to the line about 115 miles from Lake Tahoe. The triangulation being effected, any desired number of points in the line may be located with accuracy, triangulation being independent of local deflection. A surveyor attempting to follow the line by sighting will soon find himself stopped by obstructions ranging above 12 9Q<) feet (\Vhite ?.fountains) of elevation (Lake Tahoe is 6 224 feet above the sea .md the Colorado River at Fort Mohave 514 feet) and would have to resort to a local triangulation, as Assistant Davidson has already pointed out; further, shoulrl he attempt to take up a new (verification) azimuth it would not be completecl without a knowledge of his latitude and longitude. The former he may observe, the latter get from distance run anrl direction of line. His assigned distance will he too rough (for instance; he has to climb within 4 miles of I,ake Tahoe, an altitude of nearly 3 200 feet, and come down again at the other side of the spur; also the incline will have to he allowed for). The number of permanent monuments in the line may be estimated by the consideration that about 20 miles should be their greatest distance apart, so that a surveyor setting up his transit at one end of them may get a sight forward and backward over the line; further monu111ents arc required where a road crosses the line, and in particular where obstructions limit the length of the sight. For 400 miles 20 monuments and for special sights perhaps as many more would be needed.

VARIETY OF LINES Bc'TWEBN THE TERl\11:-l'ALS.

As to the kind of line between two points 11ot intcrvisib!e, contemplated by the law givers, their term ''straight'' line may be interpreted to mean any of the following eight theoretical lines, viz: (a) The intersection of the surface by a plane through the nonnal at one end (A), and through the other end ( B). It is a plane elliptic arc. (b) A similar plnne curve passing through the normal of B and through A. These two curves will be distant at about the middle of our line, say 202 miles from either end, by only 1"'·83 or 6 feet (see my report of July 17, 1885), and the angles contained between these arcs at A and B will be 2 11 ·45 and 2 11 ·19 (see my report of January 6, 1890). (c) A line called "line of alignment" by Clarke, defined by the property that at every point in it the azimuths of A and B are 18o 0 apart, and it is important to observe that no other three points in the line possess this 7C property. It is a tortuous curve closely approaching(d) The geodetic or shortest liue between A and B; it has no ele111ent in common with either (a), (b), or (c). (c) A forward straight line starting in the plane through the normal at A and through B, and in advancing keeping B constantly sighted. (f) A forward sight line starting at B as above; these lines are distinct and tortuous. (g) A forward and backward sight line over limited distances, i.e., in which the azimuths of the 11carest poi11ts forward and backward equal 7C, and which has been contemplated in speaking of the direct tracing out of our line. It is simply a composition of a series of lines each having the character of ( e).

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

(h) A line of the same kind as preceding, but starting from the opposite end. The two lines are distinct. It can also be asserted that the length of these lines are practically equal, no one difference amounting to a millimeter, and 6 of these lines are packed in between the first two plane arcs. Hence it is immaterial which of these curves the computer may adopt, and in particular for the above steps of 20 miles they are absolutely undistinguishahle one from the other. We may take then the geodetic line, or we may use the formula! on page 463, Appendix 9, Report for 1885, which are quite rigorous enough, after they have been accommo<lated to the inverse problem. Let us now examine the method of locating the end points al Lake Ta/Joe* and 11ear Jl:fo/Javc, both from an astronomic and from a geodetic point of view. 3. THE LAKE TAHOE TERMINAL CONSIDERED ASTRONOMICALLY.

Select a point on the shore and as near as may be in the line. It will probably be less than 5 miles from the intersection of latitu<le 39° and longitude 120°. Observe here an astronomic latitude and an astronomic longitude, the latter by means of transfer of the nearest telegraphic longitude station, viz, at Genoa. It is but 6 ~ miles distant in an air line, but separated from our line by a high range of mountains (the pass is 3 300 feet above the lake); hence to get the difference of longitude by wire, by rockets, by azimuthal difference, or by chronometers would be equally difficult or impracticable. Suppose, however, we have it; hence also the clotted line (in figure). To get a point on the boundary line we must necessarily know the azimuth of the boun<lary line. This can only be had approximately, as we do not know the difference in the local deflections of the end points of the line; my calcul:ttions make it48° 41 1 29"·6, the longitude of the Colorado end being given (in r885) as 114° 37' 53 11 ·5; but with the later longitude, r r4° 38' 45 11 ·3, as given me in 1890, azimuth becomes 48° 4o' 23 11 ·0; thus a few feet ( 7) of uncertainty will enter in our problem, one or the other longitude being assumed correct (may be neither is so). The solution of a sphe~cal triangle with difference of latitude (say) as a side and angles, <r and~· gives a point in the boundary line; comparing this point with the astronomic point, the direction and azimuth, the latter is to be shifted to get in line, becomes known. 'Ve thus secure the first boundary monument. The two maps referred to show a nonconformity with the law, inasmuch as the boundary line when produced backward fails to intersect latitude 39° in longitude r20°, but intersects in 120° oo' 45 11 nearly; the actual line is accordingly three-fourths of a mile too far west, taking off that llluch from California. Now it was known since 1874 (see my report of April 8 1874) that the boundary monument at Verdi was in longitude r20° oo' 4811 ·6, and this seems to be Lile explanation fort.he difference shown on the map, the topography of which is correct. but not so the boundary line. There is no telling whether or not that erroneous longitude marked at Verdi was correctly transferred south to the lake; most likely not, since Assistant Davidson notes a heavy difference nortli of Verdi in latitude 42°. 'Vith this meridianal boundary line, however, we are not concerned at present. 4. THE LAKE TAHOE 'tERMINAI, CONSIDERED GEODETICALLY.

Locate a point geodetically near the boundary and place the same in line as before, and the first boundary monument is secured. Not to depend on the present geodetic data of the triangul.,.tion, the later telegraphic longitude stations, Verdi, Virginia City, Carson City, and Genoa, should all be connected with the triangulation, a work which has to be doue anyhow as part of the survey of the *For Lake Tahoe, see Wheeler's topographical maps, United States Geological Surveys, scale 1 inch to the mile, and Atlas sheet No. 56 B. For Mohave, see sheet No. 74; also Explorers and Surveyors, War Department, Rio Colorado of the West, map No. 1, 1858. For intermediate parts of t.he line see maps Nos. 56 B, 57, and 66.

thirty-ninth parallel; it is already nearly three years since these longitudes were determined, and there is danger of losing the stations. The best sketch showing the triangulation is No. 10, Report for 1890, and there is Assistant Eimbeck's reconnaisance sketch of 1875. The only astronomical work required would be the measure of an azimuth at the boundary monument. The positions of a number of secondary triangulation stations (unoccupied) are already known, as Peavine, TVaslioe, Sage, Saddle, Freels, Cary's, etc. 5. THE COLORADO RIVER TER::\1INAL, CONSIDERED ASTRONOMICALLY AND GEODETICALLY.

Here we have the same problem and similar considerations as at the 'fahoe end, only further complicated by the uncertainty of the boundary monument, it may or may not be in existence now; if not, it is to he reestablished as the course of the river was at a certain given former time or as it is found now. The reqmred azimuth here is 134° 32' 09 11 ·8 or 134° 33' 0911 ·3. The latitude and longitude of the monument may be had from a triangulation of about a dozen miles from Needles and the longitude must be had from the telegraphic longitude of Needles, viz: 114° 36' I I 11 ·0 nearly (Sinclair 1889). At the beginning of the line latitude and azimuth also should be observed. The latitude of the Needles is 34° 50' 17 11 ·90 ± 0 11 ·14 (Sinclair, 1889 ). Fort (or camp) Mohave, Arizona, is said to be in latitude 35° 02 1 09 11 ·0 and longitude 114° 35' 54 11 ·0 ('Vheeler* in 1875 by connection with iron 111onzmze11t of California boundary, an important remark). The Colorado at ::\'lohave was reached by Captain Sitgreaves in I852, by Lieutenant Ives in I858, and by Lieutenant Wheeler in I87I, and there is more than one topographic sketch of the river at that point extant (see illustrations Nos. 1, 41 5, 10, and 57). Mohave is about 2;~ miles from the boundary terminus. (See also 'Vl1eeler's map of the Grand Caiion of the Colorado, 187I.) The positions of the two terminal line monuments being thus established the whole line may be run( r) By successive steps, starting from astronomic data and following the line in the manner already considered, and taking our chances to meet properly in the middle. ( 2) By connecting the two terminal line monuments by triangulation (and computing the position of the line accurately) and locating in or close to it a number of points by triangulation, say 50 miles apart,' and at all special points, and ascertaining by computation how far, and in what direction each is off the line, and finally placing them in the line. The intervening line spaces can be run direct as in the first case. Here we have absolute certainty to succeed. To make the geodetic connection of the end monuments two courses are open, one to follow thr line via Conness triangulation point and Lone ::\fountain triangulation point southeastward, and the other to start from Utah on the line Pioche triangulation point and Tushar triangulation point where three peaks are indicated abput latitude 37° and follow along the 'Utah-Nevada boundary southward. 'l'o reach the Colorado end by this route is considered by Assistant Eimbeck as perfectly feasible and it strikes me to be preferable to the other route, probably involving less exposure. To sum up this somewhat lengthy dissertation, the modus operandi-i. e., whether it should be of a more astronomical or geodetical character, is first to be decided; this done there will be needed to place in the field ''the Lake Tahoe party'' to connect the telegraphic longitude stations with the primary triangulation and to establish the first boundary monument; also to start a second party, "the Colorado-Mohave party," to connect the astronomical station Needles with the boundary monument after locating the latter; and if geodetic connection is resolved upon to start a third party, "the California-Nevada or the Nevada-Utah triangulation party," as the case may be, to connect the two end monuments of the line; and lastly, to send into the field at least two parties to run the line or locate the line itself. Three years will be consumed, even with/11/l 111ca11s, and more years will be needed with inadequate annual means (of men and money). A total expenditure of $40,000 may be taken as a minimum with which to accomplish the work, one of the most difficult that could be , offered to the geodesist. Considering that a contribution toward elucidating the best means of dealing with the problem in hand may in the end save time and money, this report may not be taken as too lengthy. I remain, sir, yours, respectfully,
CHAS.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT C. A. SCHOTT.
CO:.llPUTING Dn·1s10::-;-, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY, llfard1 8, 1894.

Dr. T. C. MENDENHALL. SIR: The Office computation of the triangulation connecting Needles, Cal., and Fort Mohave, Ariz., was completed some time ago, but the report was delayed by the meetings of the conference. This triangulation was made in 1893 by Subassistant 'V. B. Fairfield, and the computations by the observer and by Mr. Courtenay, aided by Mr. Kummell. The main figure was adjusted by least squares, and the results proved quite satisfactory. · The base was measured by a 100-meter steel tape

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900. and has a length of 1"7 kilometers (about). The triangulation extends over 14 statute miles nearly, and fixes the position of 38 points, all of which have been inserted·in the registers. The astronomic data are as follows: The latitude is that observed at Von Schmidt's 35° latitude post of 1873, viz, 35° 001 15 11 ·02±011 ·o8 (C. H. Sinclair, May, 1893), The azimuth is that observed at the same station, viz, Azimuth of mark 142° 41 1 56 11 ·0 (C. H. Sinclair and ,V. B. Fairfield, June, 1893 ). The longitude is that determined telegraphically at Needles, viz, II4 ° 36 1 n 11 ·04 ( C. H. Sinclair and R. A. Marr, May and June, 1889). * * * The triangulation connecting two astronomic latitude stations brought to light a large local differential deflection in the meridian, viz, between Von Schmidt's 35° post and Needles. Difference latitude, astronomic, 35° 001 1511 ·02 ± 11 ·o8- 34° 5o' 17 11 ·90± 11 ··14 = 9 1 57 11 ·12 ± 11 ·16 Difference latitude, geodetic, 35? 001 1511 ·02 - 34° 50 1 o811 ·71 = 10' o6 1 /·31 Differential local deflection
9 1 /· 19

which is at the rate of o'/·92 per minute (nautical mile) if supposed equally distributed. This large deflection, which relative to the vertical at Needles, indicates an attraction of the plumb-line northward as we approach the Mohave end, or boundary end, has an important bearing on the determination of the southeastern terminus of the California and Nevada boundary. Instead of taking a mean latitude for the geodetic latitude, as usual, the retention.of the 35° post latitude was preferred for the triangulation for the reason that it is nearer to the parallel of 35°, hence only demands a small reduction for differential deflection, viz, one-fourth of 0 1/·92 or o'/·23, i. e., TI meters (about 23 feet). This, of course, assumes a uniform change of deflection, but it is the only assumption we can make in the absence of direct observational test of the actual astronomic latitude of 35° as demanded by law for the southern limit of the boundary. This parallel is therefore 1511 ·02 0 1 /·23 or 15 11 ·25 or 470 meters south of Von Schmidt's 35° latitude post. The longitude of the terminus of the boundary is defined physically, i. e., the mid-channel of the Colorado River where it is intersected by the parallel of 35°. Owing to the meanderings of the river this point is ever changing, but if we take the middle point on the parallel of 35°, between the more stable gravel bluffs on both sides, we shall get a definite position for the terminus of the boundary, as follows:

Difference /·61 in latitude .35° equals 4 58o meters.

Distance of western post from foot of bluff 83 meters, and of eastern post 135 meters, sum 218 meters, which subtracted· from 4 58o gives 4 362 meters for width of river bed between the bluffs. Half of this ( 2 181 meters) added to 135 meters, or 2 316 meters converted into angular measure equals .1 1 31//·33, hence longitude of center or of mid-channel 114° 37 1 52 11 ·02; the latitude of the !lame is 34° 591 5911 ·77 as expressed in our coordinates. Call this point Co. Mr. Sinclair established two stations in the line, as near as this could be done in the field, and it will be necessary to ascertain how near they are to their correct position: Position of southeast line post is in latitude 35° 01/ 23 11 ·o6 and longitude l 14° 39 1 3411 ·64. The difference of this line post and the above center is difference of latitude, 1/ 23/1 ·29 or 2 566·7 meters, and difference of longitude 1 1 42//·62 or 2 6o2·0 meters, hence tan a= 44° 36 1 32 11 , and the azimuth C0 to the southeast line post 134° 36/ 32 11 , but the true azimuth of the boundary is (as near as can be ascertained) 134° 281 41 1 /·o. This shows the southeast line post to be too far north by u·69 meters (0 1 /.38), hence by laying off this amount due south of the southeast line post the first point C, in the boundary line will have been established. Noth·ng further seems to be demanded at this end of the line. The northwest line post would have to be shifted in the same direction but for a somewhat greater distance ; however, this is not required in the prosecution of the work. The Von Schmidt iron boundary monument of 1873 was washed over the bluff, but was hauled up again and put farther back, its position is therefore of no further value, but it shows that the boundary of 1873 was about 850 meters distant (to the west and south) from the site now proposed. The reason fpr this is that Von Schmidt took the mid-channel of

the river as he found it in 1873, and as it was again in 188<] in latitude 35°, the latter of course is but a curious coincidence. The position of C1 as here determined ( <p = 35° 01' 22 11 .89, A= 114° 39' 3411 .64) may be taken as known with as much precision as the case admits of under our hypothesis. It will also be of interest to compare the position of the Fort Mohave flagstaff as assigned by the United States engineers and by this Office. Captain Wheeler* found, by connection with the above iron boundary monument, the latitude 35° 02' 09" and the longitude 114° 35 1 5411 , elevation 756 feet; the survey of 1893 gave latitude 35° 02 1 31 11 ·6 and longitude II4° 371 13 11 ·9. Mr. W. Minto in 1889 made it latitude 35° 02' 3911 ·2, starting from Needles, hence 35° 02 1 3011 ·0 when starting from latitude station of !'893 or present data and longitude 114° 37' 1411 ·5. Mr. Minta's determination rests on an independent triangulation. Yours, respectfully, CHAS. A. SCHOTT.

PREFACE TO OFFICE COMPUTATION OF AZIJJlUTH AT T,.

The station called "Turning Point 1894,'' by Assistant Sinclair, is identical with my station T, when computing its position in April, r894; it is a point in the boundary line and from it starts the transit line marking out the boundary. T, stands for first point of line at Lake Tahoe. The astronomic position is<p

SIR: The results of the astronomic measures taken in connection witl1 the fixation of the end points of the California and Nevada oblique boundary line have been reported. I herewitl1 present the final results for the positions of the initial monuments at either end, based upon a recomputation of the whole geodetic line and upon a more exact computation of these points than could be had before. Below, the letters T and C refer to the Tahoe and the Colorado -end of the line, respectively. These results are: Total length of geodetic line 'l'o to Co= 652 020 meters, or 405 · I46 statute miles.

-------------------- Azimuth of line at T., 3u 0 16' 39 11 ·8. Azimuth of line at C., 134° 27 1 42 11 · I. The point T, is So5·15 meters north of the astronomic station of 1893 and very near to the point marked "Turning point" on Assistant Sinclair's map of that year. The point C, is 12·42 meters south of Assistant Sinclair's line post of 1893. Here no further notice of effect of local deflection could be taken, since it woulcl not be safe to carry a supposed law of change beyond the actual parallel of observation. A line of sight in which the forward and backward azimuth at any point in the line shall always lie 18o degrees apart can now be traced out from T, toward C., starting with the above azimuth at T,. This line when transited through to the opposite end should pass through C., and any deviation from it will have to be corrected proportionately along the whole line. * * * I append a copy of the computation showing the dependence of the points To ancl T., and Cu and C,.

DESCRIPTION OF ST A TIO NS ON THE RANDOM AND CORRECTED LINES CA.LIFORNIA AND NEV ADA OBLIQUE BOUNDARY.
No. 1 (initial 1894).

This station was established in 1894 on the shore of Lake Tahoe, and marked by a granite stone with a copper bolt in it. The stone projects about 14 inches above ground, and was not disturbed when a granite monument was placed alongside it in June, 1899. The monument was set in concrete, and the hole was enlarged so as to include the old stone in the c,.oncrete mass. Being the first stone in the oblique boundary, it was called '' No. 1.''

Granite Monument.

i

The monument is of granite 6 feet long, 12 by 12 inches at the base and 6 by 6 inches at the top; weight about 850 pounds. (See illustration.) The boundary monuments are designated as No. 1, No. 2, etc., the marks on the random line as T 1, T 2, etc., counting from Lake Tahoe. The monument has '' C '' cut on the California side, '' N '' on the Nevada side, and "No. 1" marked on the northwest face in black paint. The old (turning point and azimuth station, 1894), was not disturbed, but it is not called a line mark, as it is too close to "No. 1" and "No. 2" (at the road), which are about 834 meters apart. It is ma-rked by a copper bolt in a granite block projecting 12 inches above ground, as described in the work of 1894.

This is a line station and is 011 the north side of the road that runs from Glenbrook to Bijou. It is about one-half mile northeast of the Lake Side Hotel. 8 is marked by a granite post, IO inches by IO inches by 6 feet, set in ground just outside the fence line. Stone projects above ground r foot, and a copper bolt in top marks the station.
No.I.2

This point was marked by a granite monument, like the one at "No. 1,'' placed alongside the granite block with copper bolt, which was not disturbed. The monument has'' C" cut on the California side, "N" on the Nevada side, and "No. 2" painted in black on the northwest face. A large pine tree, 3 feet in diameter, stands about 6 feet southeast of monument on line. A triangular blaze was cut on this tree on the northwest side and one at the southeast side.

This station is located on the northern slope of a spur putting out northwest from the main range and about 300 yards northwest of the first summit. The slope is rocky, bare of grass, and covered with tamarack and yellow pine timber. The station overlooks Lake Tahoe to the northwest and Castle Rock to the north. The country road on east side of lake is about 2 miles northwest, and Kingsbury grade crosses summit of range about 3 miles northeast of this station.

This station is located on the rocky crest of spur that extends northeast from main ridge and is about 100 feet lower than the crest at station '' T 5. '' Can be reached most easily by following around side of ridge to southeast from station '' T 5.'' It overlooks Carson Valley to the east and southeast. The station is.on a large rock, marked by a drill hole, and a ~airn 5 feet high and 5 feet at base was built on line 6 feet northwest of station. The point on the corrected line, to be called '' No. 6, '' should. be at right angles froin the line at this station, to the eastward, distant 1 ·26 meters. When the station was visited in June, 1899, it was not found practicable to put jn the corrected point, as the snow was 15 feet deep over the station, even the signal pole being out of sight.

This station is located on a bold, rocky spur that puts out from the main range in a northeasterly direction. The point of intersection with the main range is a high peak, known as '' Monument Peak.'' From this station a fine view can be had of Carson Valley to the east and southeast, and the mountains beyond. The road along the west side of Carson Valley runs along foot of mountain, about 2 miles below the station. It can be reached most easily by following along east side of ridge from station '' T 5.'' Station is on a large granite rock that projects about 10 feet above the general surface of the spur, and is marked by a hole drilled in the rock. A rock, 25 feet higher than station, is 15 feet southwest of same. The point on the corrected line, ''No. 7,'' was put in at right angles from the line, to the eastward, distant from triangulation station r ·41 meters, and was marked by a drill hole, the hole being ahout 1 foot from the north edge of rock. A pine post, marked '' C.

Station Von Schmidt's 35° latitude posts.

In 1873 two posts were placed by Mr. Allexey W. Von Schmidt, United States Astronomer, to mark the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude on the west side of the Colorado River, about 12 miles north of the town of Needles, Cal. The post nearest the river is on a sand and gravel bluff, about 50 feet above the water and about 40 feet from the shore line. At this time ( l 893) the water is a lake, the remains of an old river channel. The other post is 463 meters west. The post nearest the river was used as a point in triangulation and also as the azimuth station. A large mound of stone and sand surrounded this post, which was well preserved, with the original carvings in good condition. This post was temporarily moved, a stone with a drill hole was placed 2 feet beneath the surface, and a larger stone with a drill hole was set as a surface mark. After the observations were completed for azimuth and horizontal angles, the post was carefully centered over its old position and a large cairn was built around it. This point is also the north end of a meridian line, the south end of which is 468 '69 meters distant, and mad-.ed by a concrete block 12 by 18 by 10 inches, with a small hole in it.

PROPORTIONS AND SPACING OF ROMAN LETTERS AS ASCERTAINED FROM THE BEST EXAMPLES.

By WII.LIAMS \Vh:LCH, Draftsman, Coast and G'eodctic Survey.

Draftsmen and engravers agree very closely, in a general way, in regard to the width of the different Roman letters compared to their height, and they agree more closely still in regard to the relative spaces which are left between the different letters when they form words; but there are considerable differences of opinion among them in regard to the exact proportions and spacing of the letters. From these facts it seems reasonable to believe that there may be geometric or resthetic laws governing the proportions and spacing of letters, and that the differences of opinion may be caused by a lack of knowledge or appreciation of such laws, or by the unexplainable differences of taste which exist among different individuals. Or it is possible that the different lines forming the letters may produce optical deceptions or physiological illusions which affect different eyes or minds differently or to a different degree. As each draftsman and engraver strives to form the letters and to space them in the way which gives the most pleasing appearance to himself, it is evident that, whether such laws are geometric or not, they must be as far as possible in conformity with those controlling ornamental art. It is an easy matter to select and measure a large number of examples of first-class lettering done by different individuals, and then the average of these measurements can be taken. By doing this it is very evident that if such laws exist and are geometric, they may be discovered; if they are resthetic, proportions will be found which will be pleasing to the greatest number of different individuals; and if optieal or mental aberrations affect the matter to any degree, results will be obtained which will be satisfying to the greatest number of eyes or minds.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

The examples which are given in the following table are about the best that could be obtained, although they may not be the best in existence, The height of the letters is taken as the unit of measurement, and the widest part of each letter is given, regardless of the fine horizontal lines which are at the tops and bottJms, as is shown in the upper line of the words PENOBSCOT BAY, on page 490.

The foregoing table gives the mean width of all the letters compared with th~ir height as 4 to 5. It is well known that the most pleasing proportions are simple multiples of some unit which it is difficult for the eye to detect; therefore the 1etter l and the stems of the other letters, compared with their height, should he 1 :6 or 1 :7 instead of the mean of several different proportions, as given by the above table. In order to obtain the average spacing between the letters, 40 titles were selected

PROPORTIONS AND SPACING OF RO:!.\'IAN LETTERS.

from charts of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey which ranged in date from 1856 to 1896, and as far as could be ascertained were drawn free-hand, without any rule or other guide than the eye, and were made by trained engravers and draftsmen of a number of different nationalities. First the spaces between all straight-stemmed letters, like I, and all round letters, like 0, were measured. The height of the letters was taken as the unit of measurement. Between I and I 20 were measured. They varied from ·45 to "67, the average being "60-. Between I and 0 40 were measured. They varied from ·37 to ·53, the average being ·45+. Between 0 and 0 6 were measured. They varied from ·29 to ·33, the average being ·30+. From these values the space on either side of I may be called a, and that on either side of 0 called b, and the following equations written;
2a

= ·60

a+ b =

·45

From these equations the space on either side of a straight stem is found to be ·30, while that on either side of a round letter is ·15. The following example shows the method and the result of spacing straight and round letters, in accordance with these measurements.*

The average space found between the straight stems compared with the height of the letters is the pleasing proportion of 3 to 5. As there are 26 capital letters, and each one has two sides, there are in all 52 spaces to be ascertained. The above measurements give just 20 of these spaces. By taking the space on either side of the straight stems as ·30, and those on either side of the round letters as ·15, the other spaces were ascertained as follows: On the left side of A 20 spaces were measured from straight-stemmed letters. The'e spaces varied from ·37 to ·50, the average being ·437. On the same side of the letter 20 spaceswere also measured from round letters. Thesevaried from ·23 to ·35, the average being ·284. Subtracting ·30 (the space on either side of I) from ·437 1 and subtracting ·15 (the space on either side of 0) from '284, gives ·135 as the average space on the left side of A.

A great many measurements were made from the other letters and the averages found in the same _way. These measurements are rather too numerous to be given in detail, but the following table gives the result. The mean width of all the spaces given · in the table, compared with the height of the letters, is the proportion of 2 to 5.

To avoid the decimal point the height of the letters in this table is taken as ro. On· each side of each letter is given its spacing. The spacing between any two letters is found by adding the spacing on the right of the first letter to the spacing on the left of the second. For example: The spacing for AB is 4f8; for CD is 4; for HI is 6, and for LA is 2. In the example below the name P~NOBSCO'l' BAv is shown laid off according to the values given in the preceding tables.

For the spacing between two words, lay them off as though the letter I were in the middle of the space between them. A period or comma adds its width to the space, and its distance from the preceding letter is equal to the spacing which is on the right of that letter. The following examples show the result of spacing about the worst combinations of letters, exactly according to·the values given. ·

In the upper line the stems are one-sixth, while in the lower line they are one· seventh, the height of the letters. "A Text Book on Plain Lettering·,'' by Prof. H. S. Jacoby, of Cornell University, is a very excellent and carefully prepared work of 48 pages, about 12 of which are devoted to the spacing of letters. The two lines below show words spaced by the two methods. The upper line is made exactly according to Professor Jacoby's proportions and spacing. It can be noticed that in it the masses of white between the letters are approximately equalized, while in the lower line the letters themselves are so evenly distributed that no two appear to stand closer together or farther apart than any other two.

By knowing the exact widths of the letters and the exact spaces between them, a draftsman, engraver, sign painter, sculptor, or designer can lay off words precisely the length desired and know they will be all right without spending time and effort in sketching them in beforehand and changing them. This is especially desirable in lettering maps. In practice the measurements may be laid off on a piece of stiff, thin paper, very · close to its edge. It can then be moved about until the word occupies the right position on the drawing. These marks. can be projected from the edge of the paper or pricked through to the drawing. A very close rule for determining the length of a word before laying it off is: Multiply all the letters by 8 and all the spaces by 4. The relations between the widths and spacing of the 'letters being determined throughout the alphabet, they may be varied in many ways, provided the variations are uniform. When it is desired to spread out the letters and make the words longer, any unit may be added to the spaces given in the table. The idea is the same as that of printers in spacing type when they insert blanks of equal width between the letters. If it is desired to make a word shorter, the letters can be crowded more closely by measuring their widt~s by one scale and the spaces between them by a scale with slightly closer divisions. There is anpther method, which is derived from the previous table and which avoids the trouble of adding the spacing as given in it. By this second method the spacing between all the letters is laid off exactly equal. The measurements, however, are not taken from the extreme widths of the letters, but are laid off from points near the left of each letter (except J). The alphabet given below shows the points from which the spacing is measured, and under each letter is given its width between these

equidistant measurements. The extreme width of each letter is the same as that given in the previous table. This uniform spacing may be any distance which is not less than three-sevenths the height of the letters.

This method is best for very wide spacing on account of the rapidity with which the words can be laid off; and as slight defects in wide spacing are not very apparent, the width of the letters between the spacing may be measured py the eye and only their extreme widths measured accurately. From numerous specimens measured and tests made, it was found that the spacing is most pleasing in appearance when the uniform distance is some fractional part of the height of the letters, as one-half for dose spacing; four-sevenths, three-fifths, or fiveeighths for medium; and two-thirds, five-sevenths, or three-fourths for wide. In the following examples the stems of the letters are one-seventh of their height; the spacing in the upper line is three-sevenths, in the lower line five-sevenths, and in all the examples shown elsewhere it is three-fifths the height of the letters.

CLOSEST SPACING WIDE SPACING
\\Then a definite length is given for a word, the spacing between the letters can be found by multiplying all the letters by 6 and dividing the remaining distance by the number of spaces. The roman small (lower case) letters were investigated by the same method-i. e., quite a number 0f the best examples were selected, and every detail of each letter was carefully measmed and averages found. The results are shown in the alphabet which is given on page 493. Under each letter is given its width between. the equidistant spaces, as expla~ned in the last table of capital letters. The extreme width of each letter was found to be as follows: i, 1 = I%.; t = 4~; f, j, r = 6Yz; g, n, h, s, u = 8 (g has width of top, including ball, r r Ji; width of bottom, ro); a, v, y, x, z, k = 8}f; b, d, p, q = 978; e, c = 9Yz; o =lo; w = l,3~, and tn = 14fS·

The height of the short letters is taken as 10, and the tall ones was found to be 16, which is the pleasing proportion of 5 to 3 between the lower and upper parts of the tall letters. In slanting letters, the average slant was found to be the proportion of 2 to 5 between the sine and the cosine of the angle of slant. The proportion of 3 to 8 gives a slightly less slant, while 3 to 7 gives one which is slightly greater. There are numerous optical deceptions in the alphabet which must be overcome in order to make the letters appear correct. They are as follows: A, and all letters with round tops, like 0 and S, must be about one-fortieth higher than the other letters, or they will appear to be too low. C, G, 0, Q, S, and the curved parts of B, D, P, and R, must have the widest part of the cunre about one-eighth greater than the straight stems, or it will appear too narrow. B, E, F, H, R, and S must have the middle part slightly above the center, or it will appear too low.

B, C, E, K, S, X, and Z must be narrower at the top than at the bottom, or they will appear wider.

The fine horizontal lines at the bottom of the letters must be slightly heavier and longer than those at the top, or they will appear lighter and shorter, and the little curved lines which fill in the angles at the bottom of the letters must be almost horizontal, while those at the top _must be very small and almost vertical.

A piece of transparent celluloid, about one-twentieth of an inch in thickness, can be cut in the shape shown below. It not only facilitates the work, but it greatly lessens the effort required to make the letters accurate. These angles were found by carefully measuring about two hundred well formed letters with a protractor and taking the mean of these measurements for each angle. They are given from a vertical line. In the corresponding small letters (except y) the angles were found to be slightly greater.

PREFACE.

Observations for the variation of latitude have been made from the middle of October to the close of the fiscal year at Gaithersburg, Md., and at Ukiah, Cal. This work has been carried on under the general direction of the International Geodetic Association, of which the United States is a member. The central bureau of the association is located at Pottsdam, Germany. In view of the fact that the results of these observations are of interest and value in all geodetic work of precision, the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was invited by the association to assume supervision of the work as far as the acquisition of sites, the disbursement of ftinds, and the selection of ob~ervers were concerned. It was thought well, therefore, to give in an Appendix to the Annual Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey a popular exposition of the theoretical side of the subject, and also a brief statement of the methods of observation. The former has been written by Mr. Frank Schlesinger, who has charge at Ukiah, and the latter by Mr. Edwin Smith, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, in charge of the Gaithersburg Observatory. Still another station has been established in the United States, at Cincinnati, Ohio. The astronomical observatory at that place happens to lie on the ·parallel of latitude chosen for the other stations. This favorable circumstance has led to the inauguration of a series of observations with the same object in view, and the work is being carried out by Mr. J. G. Porter, the director, using an instrument loaned by the Coast and Geodetic Survey.

THE INTERNATIONAL LATITUDE SERVICE AT GAI'rHERSBURG, MD., AND UKIAH, CAL., UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE INTERNATIONAL GEODETIC ASSOCIATION.

I.

VARIATIONS OF LATITUDE CONSIDERED WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE PROGRAMME OF THE INTERNATIONAL GEODETIC ASSOCIATION.
By FRANK Scttr.i-:srNGER, Ph. D., .Special Obsen;er.

The chief object of this paper is to give a short account of the latitude work now being carried out by the International Geodetic Association, especially in this country. The purpose and difficulties of this work will, however, be better understood if we first glance briefly over what has already been done on this important problem. '
A. EULER'S THEOR J'.

The history of the subject properly begins as early as 1765, with Euler's memoir 011 The Theory of the Motion of Solid and Rigid Bodies. We are to imagine with Euler that the earth is a perfectly rigid body, and that its mass is so distributed that its equatorial moments of inertia are equal. Two polar axes may now be defined: First, tlze axis of figure, that is, the polar principal axis of inertia, and second, the axis of rotation, or that about which the earth perfonns its diurnal revolutions. We may consider tht: latter axis as being fixed in space, for though this is by no means the case, its motions are completely defined in the theory of precession and nutation. We are here concerned merely with the motions of points on the earth's surface as referred to the axis of rotation. Euler showed that. under these suppositions the axis of figure would describe a right cone about the axis of rotation; or, what is the same thing, that the pole of figure would describe a circle about the rotation pole. Now, as latitudes are based upon the position of the rotation pole on the earth's surface, it will be seen that every point upon the latter must suffer a periodic change in latitude amounting to twice the radius of this circle. The period of this oscillation depends only upon the ratio of the polar moment of inertia to the equatorial, and this is known very accurately from precession and nutation. The Eulerian period, therefore, destined t~ play so important a part in
501

the history of latitude variation, was known to be very nearly three hundred and five days. What the radius of the polar motion might be could not, however, be determined from theory, except that it must be small. Its actual value was a matter for observation to decide.
B. EARLY OBSERVATIONS.

The first astronomer to accept the invitation thus implied was Bessell. In r 842, examining his own observations, he could find no trace of an oscillation with a period of three hundred and five days. The only conclusion that could be drawn was the negative one that the variatfon was too small to be detected by the astronomical methods then available. As instruments and methods improved we find successive attempts being made by various observers to detect Euler's variation. Thus the following results for the radius of the polar motion were published :

These results seem fairly accordant, but there is another condition which must be fulfilled. The phases of the oscillation, as derived from each of these four series separately and reduced to one epoch and to one longitude, must be the same. To this condition the results did not at all conform, so that astronomers were again constrained to believe that variations of latitude, if they existea at all, were insensible even to the refined methods then attained in practical astronomy. This view was almost universally accepted until less than fifteen years ago.
C. NECENT .INVEST.ICATIONS.

It is a significant fact that the observations from which a variation of latitude was first revealed a1id announced were undertaken with an entirely different purpose in view, and without ~ny suspicion of a change in latitude. In 1884 Kiistner, of Berlin, began a short series of observations for the purpose of testing a method devised by him for determining the constant of aberration. The method employed involved the measurement of small differences of zenith' distances in the manner devised by Talcott, of the Corps of Engineers, United States Army. Although there was every reason to believe that this method would lead. to precise results Kiistner found that his separate values of the aberration constant agreed neither among themselves nor with the best previous determinations. By a nice chain of logic Kiistncr was able to exclude one possible explanation after another till only a latitude variation was left to account for these discrepancies. His next step was to examine other nearly contemporaneous series of observations, and when he found that several puzzling anomalies could thus be accounted for he no longer hesitated to announce a variation of latitude. He stated that the latitudes of Gotha, Berlin, and Pulkowa had each fluctuated to the extent of a few tenths of a kcond of arc. This announcement at once awoke the liveliest interest, and the matter was promptly taken up by the International Geodetic Association. Observations were set on foot at Berlin, Prague, Strassburg, and Potsdam, and these showed an agreement. that left few

doubting the reality of latitude variations. There wer!! a few, however. Indeed, as recently as 1892 we find the Director of the Paris Observatory pronouncing against variations. The crucial test was made in 1891 by the International Geodetic Association and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Observations for latitude were made by the former at Berlin, Strassburg, and Prague, and at Waikiki, in the Sandwich Islands; and by the Coast and Geodetic Survt!y at Rockville (in Maryland), San Francisco, and also at Waikiki. The last station was especially important because its longitude is about 180° different from those of the German stations. Consequently, if the latitudes of the latter are found to increase during a certain period then that of Waikiki must be expected to simultaneously decrease by the same amount. As this was found to be the case, we may say that the two independent series of Marcuse and Preston, at Waikiki, firmly established the fact that the earth's axis of figure was slowly revolving around its axis of rotation. Meanwhile Chandler, of Cambridge, Mass., had already begun his investigations upon the law of variation. The results obtained by him mark an epoch not only in this subject, but in the whole progress of precise astronomy. For he was able to trace variations of latitude as far back as the time of Bradley ( l 750), and to show that many of the discouraging discrepancies encountered since that time were due to fluctuations in the latitude. Chandler's first announcement, and the most important, was to the effect that all recent observations showed a period of al;>out four hundred and twenty-eight days, or 40 per cent more than Euler's classic period. Although Chandler's evidence on this point was most conclusive his period was hesitatingly received until Newcomb pointed out a serious defect in Euler's theory-the neglect of the effect of the earth's plasticity upon the polar inotion. Newcomb showed that if the earth were assumed to be slightiy more rigid than steel, instead of absolutely rigid, the Eulerian period would be increased to agree with that <?f Chandler. It seems strange that this oversight on Euler's part should have remained so long unnoticed by the many master minds that concerned themselves with the mechanics of the earth's motion. Had it not been for this oversight on the part of theory there can be little doubt, it must be confessed, that observers would long since have detected the variation, for it now appears that many of these had noticed that a change in the latitude would make their results more accordant, but none had the boldness to announce such a change before Kiistner did so. Chandler's further researches ind~cate a law of variation which is by no means simple. The motions of the pole of figure are composed of two separate lllOtions; first, (what is now accepted as the modified Eulerian motion), unifonu motion in circle with a radius slowly variable between o" ·os and o" · 17, and with a period of about four hundred and twenty-eight days; second, an elliptical motion with au annual period; the semiaxes being o" ·I l and o" ·03, respectively, and the rate. of motion being such that the radius vector from the center describes equal areas in equal times.
D. DISCUSSION OF CHANDLER'S LAW.

Much difficulty has been encountered in attempting to assign physical causes that would lead to such a polar motion as is indicated by Chandler's empirical law. However, it may be said that these difficulties are forthe most part quantitative only. Newcomb's explanation of-the lengthening of the Eulerian period to four hundred and twenty-eight

days (namely that based upon the nonrigidity of the earth), is not the only one admissible. The mobility of the earth's envelopes of water and air, as well as properly directed currents in them, would tend to increase the period. Moreover, Woodward has shown that if the equatorial moments of inertia of the earth be not equal, as Euler had assumed them to be, the resulting period would be more than three hundred and five days; however, it does not seem probable that the increase from this cause can exceed two or three days. The annual part of the polar motion is due no doubt to meteorological causes, such as deposits of snow and ice, and atmospheric and oceanic currents. But it must be remarked that it is only differential effects of this class that can give rise to an annual term. For example, equal deposits of snow upon the Western and upon the Eastern hemispheres would leave the polar motion undisturbed; or, again, au ocean current flowing with constant velocity in a fixed path might affect the four hundred and twenty-eight day motion, but not the annual. If, however, the current flows in one direction during one-half the year, and in the opposite direction during the other half of the year, this might produce the observed effect. · Another class of causes is to be found in the changes going on in the interior of the earth, and still another has been quite recently implied in the researches of Halm, who has established, on evideuce that leaves little room for doubt, a connection between latitude variations and the intensity of the earth's magnetism. It seems clear that the problem of latitude variation is not yet in sight of complete solution. Indeed, it may be that the causes of the polar motion are such as to preclude the possibility of predicting them for more than a few years in advance. At any rate, all are agreed upon the necessity of further obsen·ation, for it must be remembered that only during the present decade have we precise knowledge of the motions of the pole. Our knowledge of them prior to 1890 is derived from observations made for very different purposes, and indeed, as we have .seen, before the existence of such a motion was suspected.
E. THE WORK OF THE INTERNATIONAi, GEOIJETIC A5'SOCIATIO/V.

For almost ten years the International Geodetic Association has had under consideration a plan for observing variations of latitude which finally came into operation in the fall of r 899. The zenith telescopes employed in this work and the method of using them will be found described elsewhere. It is my purpose here to outline only the general plan of the work. The distinguishing feature in this plan is the establishment of a number of stations upon the same parallel of latitude, and ,is widely separated in longitude as possible. The selection of suitable sites was far from easy, as many other conditions besides the above had to be kept in view. It was desirable to have a good average of clear nights, to have the character of the country the same on the north as on the south of each station, and to have good seismological, hygienic, and social conditions.

In arranging the pro-~ gramme for observing, the controlling desideratum has been to obtain the most accurate results for the variation of latitude solely, and not to attempt to use the observations for deducing the value of the constant of aberration. Following Kiistner's lead, in which he obtained the first conclusive observational DISTRIBUTION OF THE STATIONS evidence of a change in latitude, most other latitude observers have also sought to determine the aberration constant. Such a plan necessitates a limited number of groups, of which one at least must be observed during nearly the '"hole of the period in which it transits at night. The central bureau of the Association has decided to use no less than twelve groups, each exteuding over two hours

By ''duration of group connection '' is meant the period in which the same two groups are observed; thus, Groups I and II are observed together during a period of thirty-five days, Groups II and III during twenty-nine days, etc. ·It will be noticed that these peri~ds are short in the spring and long in the fall. This arrangement was adopted principally for the convenience of the observer, as the night's work is thus brought as nearly after sunset as was deemed safe. In midwinter observing will begin not less than two and a half hours after sunset, while in midsummer this minimum interval is reduced to one and a half· hours. Each group contains 8 pairs, only 6 of which, however, are to be used directly in determining the latitude. The two others are of very large zenith distances and were introduced, upon the suggestion of Professor Helmert, in order to detect anomalous refraction. In the discussion of previous latitude observations such anomalies have often been appealed to in order to account for some puzzling systematic discrepancies in · the results. It has happened, for example, that the values of the latitudes from all the pairs on a certain night were greater than the true value. This result would be brought about if the index of refra~tion were greater to the south of the station than to the north. In the present programme such a condition of affairs will be revealed in the observations themselves for any single night, since there will be 4 pairs at about 60° zenith distance, while the latitude pairs. exceed 20° zenith distance in only five cases in all twelve groups.

The observing list therefore requires the selection of 96 suitable pairs, a greater number than has usually been employed. Nevertheless it has not been a very difficult task to make the selection, because the instruments are of large enough aperture to permit the use of stars down to the seventh magnitude; and, besides, accurate knowledge of proper motions, or even positions, of the stars is by no means necessary in the present case. A proper-motion effect can not be confused with a variation of latitude, for the latter at any station has its counterpart, or rather its intaglio, at a station on the opposite· meridian. For example, if the latitude of Ukiah should increase, then that of Tschardjui must decrease by practically the same amount, since these two stations differ nearly 180° in longitude. On the other hand, if the increase in the latitude of Ukiah should be only apparent and due to ignorance of proper motions, then the latitudes of all the other stations would be increased. by the same amount. Similarly an incorrect value of the constant of aberration, or any other cause that would render the apparent places of the stars inexact, is practically without effect upon the results. Another advantage which arises from having all the stations on one parallel is that it will never be necessary to compute the apparent places of more than 16 stars for any date, as the same stars are observed simultaneously at all the stations. Considerable computing is thus saved.· From the results thus far obtained it appears that expectations of accuracy are likely to be realized. A preliminary discussion by Dr. Albrecht, of the central burea_u of the association, has shown that the probable error of a single determination of latitude is about o" · 12 on the average, and that the place of the pole may be defined with a probable error of less than 0"·02.

LOCA TJON OF STATION.

On July 1, 1899, the Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey assigned the writer to take charge of the International Geodetic Association Latitude Station at Gaithersburg, Md. At various times previous to this date he had assisted the Superintendent in selecting the station. On Aprill, 1899, a lot containing 2·3 acres was leased for a term of ninety-nine years. '!'his lot is in a corner of the north part of a farm belonging to Mr. I. 'I'. Fulks. .It is about half a mile from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad station. Gaithersburg is 2 I miles northwest of Washington. '!'he sketches show the location of the lot and the plans of the buildings. The observatory is on a summit about 540 feet above tide water. It is some l 500 feet northwest of the site originally selected, and, though a few feet lower, is in every other respect a better location. The buildings were begun soon after July l, 1899, and in the early part of August the observatory was in a condition to be used for the determination of longitude. '!'he observations were made with the Coast and Geodetic

The observatory was then prepared for the latitude instrnments, which reached Gaithersbnrg September 20. They were at once set up, and by October I were ready for the regnlar observations.
H.

THE

HUIIJJIN<~·s.

Plans for an observatory, to be built of iron, were received from the Central Bureau of the International Geodetic Association. It was found, however, that the observatories of the American stations could not be built of iron from the available funds. New plans for observatories, to be built of wood, were therefore made by the writer. These plans conform as nearly as practicable to the original ones. The observatory at Gaithersburg is built of Georgia and Virginia pine, the roof being covered with heavy tin. The zenith-telescope pier is in the center of the observatory. It is of brick, 22 inches square, with a white marble cap 24 inches square. The brick pier rests on a stone foundation (a cube of 5 feet), the top of which is 6 inches below the surface of the ground. The foundation of the observatory is of stone, 2 feet wide, projecting 6 inches above the surface of the ground, and of the same depth as the foundation of the zenith-telescope pier. The space between the foundations of pier and observatory is about half filled with loose earth. The observatory is IO feet square inside, and the walls are 7 feet 4 inches high above the floor. These walls .rest on the inner edge of the stone foundation. On the outer edge of the stone foundation rests a wooden lattice 12 feet square, the top of which is a few inches lower than the walls of the observatory. This lattice keeps the sun from the walls of the observatory and leaves a well-ventilated space all round them. The door is in the center of the west wall, to be convenient to the office. There ·are two ventilators in each of the four walls near the roof east and west and near the floor north and south. These ventilators are always open, except during observatory hours, when they are closed tight. In the south wall are two openings through which to view·the meridian mark. These openings are always kept closed, except during the few minutes necessary for setting the instrument on the meridian mark.

510

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

The roof is in two parts, which m~ve east and west on iron wheels. The north wheels run on an iron track and the south wheels in an iron groove. The roof is double, and open to the air north and south, so there is a free circulation of air through it. There is a ventilator in each half of the roof, under which is a hood so arranged that no water can get on the instrument, even if the ventilator should be blown off. The roof is easily opened and closed by the observer inside the observatory by ropes running over pulleys. The full opening is 6 feet 6 inches, and the full opening is always used at Gaithersburg. The interior of the observatory is painted a pale, dull blue, and the exterior is painted white. Extending across the north side of the observatory is a shelf r foot 6 inches wide, which sen1es as a recording desk, etc. On the west end of this shelf is a locker for tools, and below the west and east ends are other shelves for the batteries used for electric illumination. l'he chronometer is set into the shelf and can be wound from below without moving it. On the north wall, over the chronometer, is a tin hood ' which throws the electric light onto the chronometer and recording desk and protects the ob5erver's eyes. Around the pier, just below the marble cap, is a band of wood, to which are fastened the switches and rheostats for control of the electric lights. At the center of the south wall is suspended the mercurial barometer. · A thermometer is suspended from the axis of the zenith telescope .. During the warmest part of the summer days this thermometer, as well as the one attached to the bai:ometer, indicated temperatures from r 0 to 3° C. below the temperature of the outside air. During observing hours the temperatures inside and outside the observatory have been determined by swinging a thermometei;. In general the inside temperature has been found 0°·1 to 0°·2 C. higher, occasionally o 0 ·5 C. higher, and in a few cases slightly lower than the outside temperature. This indicates that the observatory is well planned. to secure nearly equal temperatures of the air inside and outside. 'I'he zenith telescope is so high that the tube has to be brought to a' nearly horizontal position in order to close the roof of the observatory. At a distance of 53·85 meters south of the center of the zenith-telescope pier is the meridian mark, mounted in a brick pier resting on stone foundation, similar to the zenith-telescope pier. This pier and meridian mark are protected by a double casing of galvanized iron painted white. From the door of the observatory is a platform extending rs feet to the door of the office. The office building is r8 feet by 24 feet, with an extension of ro feet at the north end for servants' quarters. This building is not intended as a residence, but the Gaithersburg station is so isolated that it was necessary to provide the observer with a place to sleep on observing nights, as well as a place to retire for a few minutes on cold winter nights and to work in during the hours he would necessarily be at the station and not observing. The clock, chronograph, and barograph are kept in the office, as indicated on the plans,

THE INSTRUMENTS.

The instruments furnished by the International Geodetic Association are a zenith telescope. and accessories, a sidereal clock, a sidereal watch, and a Richard barograph. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has furnished a cylinder chronograph, a sidereal breakcircuit chronometer, a mercurial barometer, and several thermometers. The clock and zenith telescope only need special mention. The clock is by Strosser & Rohde, Glashiitte i. S., and has a Riefler pendulum. It is mounted in the office on a post which extends 5 feet into the ground, and is isolated from the building. During the past yea.r the range of the temperature in the office has been not less than 50° C., and in the winter there were times when the range was as great as 30° in twenty-four hours, as no fire was allowed there except when the observer was present. The intervals between time observations have frequently been ten days. Even under these unfavorable conditions the uncertainty of the clock correction has at no time been greater than ±0'·3, a matter of no importance in the latitude work. The zenith telescope is one of four made by Julius Wanschaff, in Berlin, for the International Geodetic Association latitude service. The "Anleitung zum Gebrauch des Zenitteleskops auf den Internationalen Breitenstationen,'' by Th. Albrecht, gives a detailed description of these instruments, the methods of installation and observing, and the programme to be followed in the latitude work. The accompanying illustration . of the instrument is a reproduction of that in the '' Anleitung.'' The zenith telescope is an altazimuth, or universal instrument. The vertical axis and horizontal circle are attached to. a heavy circular base, supported by three leveling screws on point, line, and plane. Tllt! horizontal circle is 2scm in diameter, graduated to 101 , and reads to lo'' by two verniers. The movable part of the instrument may be clamped to the horizontal circle by the screw .f, and the verniers set by the tangent screw g. 'When the approximate circle reading of the meridian has been determined the stops k are fastened to the circle by the screws i. The clamp f is then loosened and the movable part of the instrument clamped to the stop by a clutch worked by the screw /, and the final adjustment in the meridian is n1ade by the stop screws k. The instrument may then be quickly reversed 180° and clamped to either stop by l. The weight of all the movable parts upon the bearings of the vertical axis is regulated by the screw n. This requires very nice adjustment in order that the instrument may be easily reversed without disturbing the instrumental constants. At Gaithersburg it has been necessary to readjust this for every change of temperature of 40 to 50 C. The weight carried by the horizontal axis upon the bearings of the wyes o is regulated by the friction rollers p, supported 01~ springs adjusted by screws q. The optical parts of the instrument were made by Carl Zeiss, in Jena. The objective has an aperture of 108mm and a focal length of 130<'". With the eyepiece used in the latitude work, the telescope has a power of 104. Near the eye is a prism which reflects the cone of light at right angles, so the micrometer and eyepiece are placed in a most convenient position for observing. On the side of the telescope tube opposite the eyepiece is a focus scale, and the focus is clamped by the screw /;. The telescope tube is inclosed by another tube open at the eye end and pierced by a double row of holes near the horizontal axis. The dew cap y is 24<m long.

512

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

The setting circle is attached to the telescope tube opposite the horizontal axis. It has a diameter of 24'"', is graduated at 10', and reads to 10" by a vernier. The levels are by Carl Reichel, in Berlin. The scale divisions are a little over 2m°'. The arc value of 1 division of the striding level is about 2 11 ·5, and of the latitude levels about r". The scale of the upper latitude level is o to 40, and of ·the lower one 50 to 90. These levels are mounted in double tubes, and the two latitude levels are attached to a solid frame, one above and one below the center of axis of setting circle. They are adjusted parallel to each other by the screws z. They are chambered and the bubbles can be adjusted to the desired length and· equal to each ·other without removing the levels from the instrument. The levels being above the observer's eyes, the scales are read in the mirrors {J. By means of the clamp v and tangent screw w the circle is set to zenith distances, and when set the clampy, at axis of circle, is applied and the clamp v loosened.* The telescope is then set approximately to the zenith distance and clamped at s, and the level bubbles brought to the middle of the scale by the tangent screw s. The micrometer head is at o, and by an ingenious device the whole revolutions and fractions are read by the same index. The micrometer head is divided into 100 parts. One revolution of the screw is 40"; so the smallest direct reading is o" ·40, and by estimation o" ·04. The working field is limited by two fixed threads parallel to the micrometer thread to 30 revolutions of the screw, or 20', and the eyepiece can be centered over any position of the micrometer thread by the screw A. At right angles to the micrometer thread is a system of r 1 transit threads with equatorial intervals from the middle thread 0, 2~5, ro~·. 1373·, r6·, and 24·. The collimation of the middle transit thread and the verticality of the micrometer thread are adjusted by opposing screws z and K. In front of the eyepiece is a reversion prism. This is mounted in a tube which can be turned just 90° against a stop on the tube of the eyepiece. When the eyepiece with the prism attached is adjusted fo distinct vision of the micrometer thread, the eyepiece is clamped in its adapter, and the eyepiece and prism can be revolved without clanger of changing the focus, and the threads made to appear at any desired angle, whatever the inclination of the telescope may be. Between the micrometer box and the large prism is another box containing the auxiliary lens, which by means of the rod µ may be shunted into the optical axis of the telescope. When this is done an object at the distance of 53 ·s5 meters (meridian mark) is at distinct vision at the focal plane of the objective. This lens changes the collimation, but as it works against a stop the change of collimation is always so nearly the same that it makes no difference in the control of the azimuth by setting on the meridian mark. The field of the telescope may be illuminated by oil or electric lamps, and the brightness of the illumination may be controlled by the screw u. At Gaithersburg only electric lights are used, and they are controlled by a rheostat. The illustration shows the instrument fitted for electrical illumination at t.
*In 1892--93, while the writer was in charge of the instrument division of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, designs were made for a special latitude instrument. In the drawings mentioned will be found the design for a clamp at the axis of the setting circle with an improvement over the abovementioned clamp y, in that the same motfon that applied the clamp at the axis loosened the clamp at the circle without disturbing the setting. The design is by Mr. E. G. Fischer. E. S

The instrument was first set up and adjusted in September, 1899, using the value of b = 1 ·74, and reducing the transit observations by Mayer's formula. In October a series of seven nights' observations were made and reduced by the method given in the 1 "Anleitung," from which was found b = 1 ·69. During this series of observations the meridian mark was established. The method given in the "Anleitung" for reducing the transit observations is briefly as follows. The notation is preserved. Let u = clock correction, c = collimation constant, b side flexure, k 0 and k.,, = azimuth constants for telescope east and west. These five quantities must be determined from the transit observations. Let. U = mean of observed threads reduced to the middle thread and corrected for aberration and rate of clock, a and o the right ascension and declination of zenith and south stars, and let U', a', and o' be like quantities for the pole stars and i the level error of horizontal axis referred to west end. Then each zenith and south star will give an observation equation.

The time observations at Gaithersburg are always made before the latitude observations, at intervals of five to ten days. It is not often that such a complete set of stars can be selected without interfering with the latitude work. Frequently two or more zenith and two or more south stars have been combined with one polar star at upper culmination, with good results. When no polar star above 80° declination is available, the value of b is assumed as known and the observations reduced by

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, Icp:>.

Mayer's formula. Five nights' observations in September and October, 1900, give b= 1·· 37, or c5· 32 less than the value from the same set of stars a year ago. The observations throughout the year seem to indicate that this is a real change in the value of b. The instrumental constants must be kept within such limits that the latitude results will not be affected so much as o"·oI. On a latitude determination the effect of

For a latitude pair (z not greater than 20°) c or k may be 5011 , and £ 40". For a. refraction pair (z 60°) c or k may be 30" and t' 25 11 · The displacement of the middle thread from the meridian on account of the side flexure b is b cos z, a maximum in the zenith, and the combined effect of collimation and flexure is c - b cos Z. If now c is adjusted to the condition c - b = o, the combined effect will be zero for the zenith and Yz b at 6o 0 zenith distance. This condition will entirely eliminate the effect of collimation and flexure on the latitude pairs, and the error ~ b or less than 12" on the refraction pairs will be inappreciable. The latitude levels are frequently tested by aid of the meridian mark. The auxiliary lens, which must be used in these tests, changes the value of micrometer, and a special determination of a revolution of the micrometer screw with the auxiliary lens in optical axis has to be made before the absolute value of the level divisions becomes known from these tests. This has yet to be done at Gaithersburg. The level tests, however, serve to show the condition of the levels, and if any change has taken place in them. The value of one revolution of the micrometer screw and its progressive and periodic errors are determined by observing the transits of a polar star near its elongation, over progressive readings of the micrometer. This has conveniently been done at Gaithersburg four times during the year without interfering with the latitude observations: December, 1899, on tJ Urs. Min., 51 Cephei, and A. Urs. Min. March, 1900, on a Urs. Min. May and June, 1900, on tJ Urs. Min., 51 Cephei, and i\. Urs. Min. August and September, 1900, on a Urs. Min. The resulting mean value of one revolution of the micrometer is very nearly the same as determined in .Berlin. There seems to be no appreciable periodic error, but there seem to be some greater errors in different parts of the screw than indicated in the statement received with the instrument. ·

THE METHOD OF OBSERVING LATITUDE.

The roof of the observatory at Gaithersburg has always been open at least two hours before beginning the latitude observations. About half an hour before time for the first latitude pair the side ventilators have been closed, the instrument carefully leveled, and the middle transit thread set on the meridian mark, telescope east and west. Temperature inside and outside the observatory and the state of the barometer have been recorded at the beginning, middle, and end of each night's work, and more frequently in case of sudden changes.

The telescope is set to the mean zenith distance of the two stars of the first pair, being careful to securely set the clamp y and loosen the clamp v. The instrument is clamped by l to the E. or \V. stop. The micrometer head is then set to the approximate reading for the first star, from the approximately kno\vn difference of zenith distance and the eyepiece is centered over the micrometer thread. The reversion prism is then turned against its stop, and the eyepiece and prism turned until the micrometer thread appears vertical. About half a minute before the star enters the field the state of the two latitude levels are read and recorded. As the star crosses the field, four bisections · are made with the micrometer thread at points in the field corresponding to equatorial intervals 20·, 6_71·, 6_71·, and 2o' (if a lower culmination star 6_71', 2,71·, 2,71', 6,71'). The reversion prism is turned 90° against its stop between the second and third bisection, so that if the star enters the field moving up it will leave the field moving down.* The four micrometer readings are then recorded, a note of the sharpness and steadiness of the star is made, and the state of the two levels· again read and recorded. The instrument is then reversed 180° and clamped by l against the other stop, and the micr9meter and eyepiece are set for the second star. By means of the tangent screws. the levels are brought to the same reading, as nearly as practicable, as for the first star. The second star is then observed as the first. The instrument remaining clamped to the stop, the telescope is set for the second pair, etc. If the first pair begins telescope w, the second pair will begin telescope E, the third pair W, etc., during the night's work. On the following night the first pair will begin E, the second pair W, etc. The following is a specimen of the record:

THE PROGRA.llfME OF OBSERVING.

Twelve groups of stars, each covering two hours of right ascension, have been selected by the Central Bureau. Two groups are obseryed each night, covering four hours, in summer between the hours of 9 p. m. and 3 a. 111., and in winter between 7 p. m. and I a. m. The duration of the groups is from fifty to eighty days, and the duration of the group combinations is from twenty-five to forty days. It is expected that from eight to twelve good nights will be obtained in each group combination. Each group has eight pairs, six latitude pairs with zenith distances less than 20° and difference of zenith distance less than 15', and two refraction pairs of about 60° zenith distance and difference of zenith distance less than 5 1 · The stars are between the fourth and seventh magnitudes. An eighth magnitude star can be observed with the instrument. To facilitate the reduction of the observations the ''Anleitung '' gives tables for the correction for curvature of the parallels and for refraction. The Central Bureau has furnished the apparent declinations for the mean of the two stars of each pair for every two days. Convenient tables for the level corrections and the value of micrometer have been formed, so that the computation of a night's latitude observations is not a great matter. The record of each month's latitude observations is kept in a separate book, a duplicate of which is kept at the station. The original record is sent to the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, and thence to the Central Bureau, at Potsdam. With each· monthly record book are also sent the results of the time observations, the record of the level tests, the record of the observations for value of micrometer screw, and the barograph sheets. In addition to making the latitude and other observations, the observer has to make all the computations, duplicate the records, and look after the maintenance of the station. The results of the year's work can not be given, as the observations will be finally reduced and published by the Central Bureau. It may be stated, however, that the probable error of one observation for latitude from all the observations at Gaithersburg is about ±011 ·09 for the latitude pairs and about ±0"·16 for the refraction pairs. A recent report of the Central Bureau, giving the results from January 5 to May 11, 1900, confirms this statement.

DESCRIPTION OF PRECISE LEVELS NOS. 7 AND 8, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY, 1900.
By E. G. FiscrutR, Chief of the Instrument
Di~sion.

A. INTRODUCTION.

When it became necessary to provide additional instruments for carrying out the geodetic leveling planned for the season of· 1900, opportunity arose to embody in a new design the fruits of the deliberations of the committee on precise leveling of 1898-<)9,* . whose conclusions had been tried and proven with the three geodetic levels Nos. 1, 5, and 6, remodeled in the instrument shop of the Survey in the spring of 1899 and m~ed in the field during the whole of that season. A careful study of the results obtained with these instruments proved conclusively that the use of the new alloy of iron and nickel, which was first applied in their reconstruction, and the reduction of the distance between the level and the line of collimation were decided improvements and practically eliminated errors due to temperature effects . . These facts were kept in view by the writer in designing the new instruments; As the newly adopted method of ·observation obviated the use of the reversible ·stride level and the rotating telescope, the distance between the level and the line of collimation could be reduced to a minimum by placing the former in an opening cut into the telescope and the latter could be placed within a tube-shaped support, at one end of which two pivot screws provide a horizontal axis around which the telescope can be rotated and the line of collimation put into the horizon by means of a fine motion or micrometer screw mounted at the other end. By makirlg the support for the telescope tubular, it was not only giv~n the strongest and lightest form, but it could be made to serve at the same time as a protection to the level mounted in the telescope. The level-reading device, in principle the same as that used in the reconstruction of levels Nos. 1 1 5, and 6, being mounted at the side of the telescope at binocular distance from it, offers, with the exception of a small mirror, which is almost horizontal al,ld fastened neither to the level nor the telescope, no additional surface to wind pressure and enables the observer to stand with head and body erect while observing the rod with one eye and the level with the other.
*See page 352 of the Report of 1898-<)9.

COAST AND GEODETIC s·uRVEY REPORT, 1900.

As has been done in designs of other instruments made by the writer for the Survey, the legs of the instrument were put as high up 011 the center bearing as possible and the lower part of the latter disposed of within the head of the tripod; thus not only affording room for an unusually long and therefore more durable and rigid center, but also bringing the center of gravity of the instrument much nearer to the plane of support.
B. THE llfATERIAL.

For all those parts upon which depend the constancy of the relation between the line of collimation and the level-the telescope, the tube incasing the level vial, the draw tube, reticle ring, and the supporting cylinder-the material selected is the same as that used in the reconstruction of geodetic levels Nos. 1, 5, and 6 in the spring of 1899. The nickel-steel alloys brought out by Dr. Ch. Ed. Guillaume,* of the International Bureau of Standard Weights and Measures, had attracted considerable attention by reason of their low expansion coefficients (down to 0·000001 per degree centigrade}. Inquiry established the fact that tubing and castings, almost indispensable in the construction of instruments, could not be obtained, because attempts to produce them had not yet been successful. Mr. George T. Ennis, of this city, who furnishes the brass castings required in the shops of the Survey, was pursuaded to undertake a series of trials in 1899 of alloying various kinds of steel and iron with nickel. A quantity of what in the trade is called "machinery steel" and commercially pure nickel were weighed off in the proportion of 64 of steel to 36 of nickel, the same from which Dr. Guillaume obtains a coefficient of less than one-millionth per degree centigrade. The furnaces of brass founders being supplied with air only by natural draught, it was with considerable difficulty that sufficient heat could be developed to melt the steel, and when mixture with the nickel was finally accomplished the temperature was still too low to allow impurities to rise freely to the surface and leave the casting sound and solid. · In another attempt steel turnings from the large gun forgings being assembled at the Washington ordnance yard were used, but the trial castings also proved porous. The coefficients of these specimens, as determined from the temperatures of o 0 and about 60° C., were, however, quite low, namely, three-millionths, nearly. The melting point of cast iron being much lower than that of wrought iron or steel, a trial was made with it, using the same proportion. But while the castings were now sound and free from pores the coefficient bad increased to nearly five-millionths. The results of Dr. Guillaume's investigations showing that but a slight variation from the above given proportion caused a change of several units in the sixth place of the coefficient, it was thought likely that a loss of one or the other of .the two metals by oxidation during the melting and mixing was the cause of this increase. For this reason a nqmber of alloys were made of different proportions, of which one of 66_73 parts of a medium-grained cast iron, furnished by the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company, and 337J parts of what is called ''grain nickel'' was finally adopted. It can be cast, free from sand and blowholes, and has a coefficient of 0·000004. No thorough tests as to strength, etc., were made of this alloy, but so far as shop practice reveals its physical properties it can be said to be rather brittle, easily worked
*These alloys are protected by patents.

in the lathe and with the file, entirely malleable, and behaving practically like the better and softer grades of cast iron. It can readily be brazed and soldered, and, unlike cast iron, very easily takes an exceptionally fine polish, resembling that of nickel. The smoothness with which it wears against itself, even under considerable pressure, should be particularly mentioned. For instance, the nickel-iron drawtubes of the three remodeled instruments of 1899, though moving in bearings of the same metal, do not show the slightest wear or looseness, though they were used in running 200, 300, and 600 miles of leveling line, respectively. None of the acids except aqua regia will readily attack it. A rectangular piece submerged in water for twelve days showed formation of what resembled iron oxide, but only along the sharp corners and without pitting, while the surfaces remained bright. A rough test proved the specific gravity of the alloy to be between that of iron and of nickel, but below that theoretically deduced from their proportions. The nickel used in these experiments was purchased at a cost of 42 cents and the iron at 6 cents a pound, making the cost of the two-to-one alloy 18 cents per pound, which is 2 cents less than that of good brass. The pointed screws pivoting the telescope, the screws holding in place the level tube and by which the level is adjusted, the screws holding and adjusting the reticle ring, and the fine-motion micrometer screw, upon all of which depends the constancy of the relation between the line of sight and the plane tangent to the middle point of the level vial, and which require to be of a material much harder than the casting above described, are made of nickel steel, with a coefficient of ·000001, obtained from the Societe Anonyme de Commentry Fourchambault, 26 Place Vendome, Paris. This alloy is well adapted for screws of all kinds, and should now entirely replace steel in the manufacture of all measuring screws, such as micrometer screws for astronomic and surveying instruments, micrometer calipers, gauges, etc., used in mechanical engineering, provided, of course, that the nuts into which such screws are threaded are made of the same material, for it is obvious that a screw with a coefficient of ·000001 could be made to fit closely in a nut of brass whose coefficient is ·000018 only at one certain temperature. The material used in the construction of other portions of the instrument will be named in the description of those parts.
C.

THE TRIPOD.

The tripod is of the usual form. The three legs, separating some distance above the feet into two rectangular rods, pivot in the head by means of bolts about 1°m diameter at points fonning a regular hexagon. The feet consist of pointed hollow sockets about 14cm long and 3Yz 0 m diameter at' the top, fitted and fastened by screws to the legs. They are made of 10 per cent aluminum bronze, an alloy but little inferior to steel in hardness and toughness. The two rods forming the leg are made of black walnut, 2<m by 3Yzcm, aud fastened together at two points by walnut braces which are screwed between them. The tops of the legs are brass bound to guard against the splitting out of the bolt holes. In obtaining the length of the legs, which should be made to suit the observer's height, their normal angle with the ground was taken to be 60°, the vertical distance between the bolt holes in the head of the stand and the line of collimation being r3<m. The head of the stand, also of black walnut, is 4Yz"m thick and carries sunk into

its upper surface the three V-grooved plates forming .the supports for the foot screws of the instrument. In a circular recess in the lower surface is held by a ring-shaped plate marked a in fig. 1, a washer, b, shaped so as to form a seat for the convex shoulder of the nut c, which is threaded on the screw d. This screw, 1 cm· 3 in diameter and of a pitch of 8 threads per centimeter, enlarges at its upper end to a cup-shaped nut, which can be screwed upon the lower end of the center socket of the instrument. The washer b is not confined in its recess so closely but what it can move laterally and adapt itself to any position the vertical axis may assume in relation to the head of the stand. When the instrument .is set upon the stand the lower end of the center socket will come to rest upon the cup-shaped nut before the foot screws can touch their supports, thus leaving it in an \lnstable position and making it practically impossible for the observer to forget to secure the instrument to the stand before it is carried to the place of work. The nut c is loosened before observing, and tightened only when the instrument and stand are to be carried from station to station.
D. THE INSTRUMENT BASE AND CENTER.

The instrument base, designated by e on the diagram, is a single piece of hard and fine-grained cast iron, furnished by the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company, of Providence, R. I. In its three legs, at a radial distance of qcm, are threaded the foot screws/, of 9~mm diameter and 15 threads per centimeter, and having a bearing of 2=·3. The screws are of such length as to permit a motion of 6mm above and below the normal P.Osition, thus allowing the instrument to be leveled even under unusual inclination of the head of the tripod. No position of the foot screws can prevent the fine-motion or micrometer screw from freely passing over them. The ends of the legs are split in the usual manner and provided with milled-head screws for clamping the foot screws. The clamp armg, with its clamp screw lz, is fitted into a groove near the top of the center socket, and carries at the outer end the fine-motion screw i for moving the telescope horizontally in azimuth. The central portion of the instrument base is bored out conically and affords a bearing throughout its length for the unusually long center ( 10=), 1which is made of the hardest grade of tool sta:l, Sanderson's No. 6. It is secured against being withdrawn by a small nut screwed to its lower end. Upon its upper end is fastened permanently, by screwing and riveting, a disk or flange}, of 5cm.g diameter, made of hard cast iron, which forms the base of the supporting cylinder.
E. THE SUPPORTING CYLINDER.

This, indicated in :figs. 1, 2, and 3 by k, is a nickel-iron casting, as stated above. Its length is 21cm.6, its outer diameter 5=·9, its inner diameter 5cm·4, leaving a thickness of wall of 2mm·5. At its middle point is a cylindrical boss or hub (!in Figs. 1, 2, and 3), of the same diameter as the flange of the center, to which it is firmly fastened by four steel screws. Two lugs, m in fig 2, are threaded to receive the pivoting screws n, which are made of nickel ste~l, .and, with their points 2mm.6 below the center of the supporting cylinder, form a horizontal axis for the telescope. At a distance of 1cm.2 from the rear end and below is fastened, by two screws, the nut o (Fig. r), made of nickel iron, which carries the fine-motion or microme~er screw p. This latter, o! 39 threads per centimeter nearly ( 100 per inch) and 7mm diameter, is provided at its upper

end with a small tip of glass hard steel, and carries, below, an adjustable micrometer head of white zylonite q, which is 4<"'· 1 in diameter and is divided into 100 parts. A hard rubber disk with milled edge, projecting beyond the micrometer head, not only protects the graduation from the fingers, but, by reason of its large diameter, facilitates the setting of the sensitive level. An index for reading the micrometer head is provided. The supporting cylinder carries a removable eccentric ring r inserted into its forward end (Figs. 1 and 2), of which the inner diameter is such as to permit the telescope pivoted between the screws n to rotate slightly without touching. A similar rings (Figs. 1 and 3) at the rear end, however, is cut out so as to permit the telescope to move up and down, abo\·e and below the normal or horizontal position, by about 111 2 "', while the sides of the ring permit of no lateral play, but form a guide for that amount of \'ertical motion. Directly in front of the micrometer screw is fastened to the supporting cylinder a small case holding an eccentric which can be rotated by a lever handle at the right side of the instrument. When the lever handle is turned up the eccentric pushes against the telescope, lifts its weight off the micrometer screw, and presses it gently against a spring sunk into the upper part of the ring s. In this position the instrument can be carried without the risk of jarring the telescope and thereby disturbing the level adjustment. This device is not shown in the diagrams but can be seen in the photographic view (Fig. 4). Against the hub /, on the right side of the instrument, is fastened a bracket carrying a small universal level, which is easily observed from the eye end of the telescope by means of a mirror mounted abo\·e it at an angle of 45° (see Fig. 4). · At the forward end of the supporting cylinder and below is mounted a post t (Fig. 1 ), reaching downward between the horizontal pointing screw i and the spring case of the clamp arm g. The upper part of the supporting cylinder has cast into it a rectangular opening with a framing u surrounding it. A piece of plate glass, fitted into this framing by dovetail grooves, closes the opening against dust or air currents, but can quickly be moved forward for the purpose of adjusting the level by loosening a small milled head scre\V (see Fig. 4), and turning up a hinged locking piece. Over this opening and against the sides of the framing is mounted by brass anus v the glass mirror w, arranged so as to permit of a small rotary adjustment for the purpose of adapting the level reading device to individual observers. It may be stated here that the opening in the supporting cylinder was placed as near as possible to its rear end and away from the middle of the instrument, because the level could at that place be put closer to the line of collimation without entering the cone formed by the apertures of the objective and the reticle ring. Small grooves around the ends of the supporting cylinder afford the means of fastening, by wire rings or narrow metal bands, the leather cones x (Fig. I). They are fastened to the telescope in a similar manner, and effectively shut out dust and air currents without in the slightest degree preventing the telescope from assmning the position determined by the pivoting screws at o.ne end and the micrometer screw at the other encl of the supporting cylinder.

THE TELESCOPE.

The tube with the objective head and drawtube bearings, forming the telescope, is cast of nickel iron in one piece and bored and turned in the lathe. Its outer diameter being 4<m·37 and the inner 4<m·o5, gives a thickness of wall of Imm.6. Immediately at the eye end and at a distance of 9cm from it are two constrictions forming the bearings y for the drawtube. A ring z is fitted and soldered into the telescope at the place where the 60° points of the pivoting screws n are bored into it (28<""9 from the eye end) for the purpose of strengthening it to resist strains caused by undue tightening of these screws. The drawtube, cast solid of nickel iron and bored out, is fitted closely into its bearings, and carries within an enlargement at its outer end, by means of four nickelsteel screws, the nickel-iron reticle ring. Great care was taken to fit the threads of these screws very tightly to insure, as much as possible, invariability of the position of the reticle. One vertical and three horizontal spider threads of the finest grade obtainable are mounted upon the reticle ring. The horizontal threads are equidistant and the upper and lower embrace a space of 3ocr" at a distance of worn. Two Steinheil eyepieces, of 12mm.5 and 9mm.5 (one-half inch and three-eighths inch), equivalent focus, to suit different weather conditions, are supplied. The objective lens is mounted in a cell cast of nickel iron. It is held in place by a spring ring, fastened with three small screws, in such manner as to hold it firmly in position, without restraining it from expanding and contracting with changes of temperature. It has a clear aperture of 4<m·2 and a focal length of 41cm, giving a magnifying power of 32 diameters with the 12mm.5 and of 43 diameters with the 9"'m·5 eyepiece. The drawtube is moved into focal distance in the usual way, by means of a rack and pinion, and has sufficient range to enable the observer to point on an object as near as 3 ·5 meters. Just within or under the leather cones x the telescope carries two enlargements or collars, which are turned to equal diameters, and serve the purpose of placing the pointing line into the geometric axis of the telescope. This adjustment is made in the shop permanently1 It is done by laying the telescope, with these collars, upon two metal · wye supports provided with leveling foot screws. Pointing on an object and. rotating the telescope in the wyes reveals any want of parallelism between the axis of the two collars and the line connecting the intersection of the vertical and· middle horizontal threads and the optical center of the objective. This is corrected by means of the four screws holding the reticle ring. Since the spider threads move with the drawtube, it also must move in a line parallel to the axis of the collars, in order to preserve true collimation in any position required by focusing upon the rod at different distances. To insure this parallelism, great care was taken in making the telescopes. The objectives were centered with special care, and the collars were turned true at the same chucking under which the drawtube bearings were bored. Inasmuch as any error of collimation enters into the result of leveling only to the small amount due to differences between back and fore sights, it may be said that these instruments, as far as collimation error is concerned, are practically faultless. In the same wve supports above mentioned, the level attached to the telescope is adjusted so that its axis is parallel to the vertical plane containing the line of collimation.

APPENDIX NO. 6.

This adjustment eliminates what is commonly called the 11 wind'' of the level, and can not readily be made in the field. The position of the forward drawtube bearing and that of the micrometer screw were selected with the view to sufficient rigidity of that part of the telescope which rests upon the micrometer screw. The point of contact with the hardened tip of the screw is a small hardened steel plate a,, fastened into the telescope at the forward drawtube bearing. The distance between the axis of the micrometer screw and the axis of rotation formed by the pivoting screws n is 19cm·.15 nearly, which, with the screw pitch of 39 threads per centimeter, gives a value of about 2"·6 per division of micrometer head The distance between the axis of rotation of the telescope and the vertical center is 9cm·s.
G. THE LEVELS.

The levels were made by A. Pessler, and are of the chambered type. They are r rcm.5 long, rcm.5 in diameter, and carry a graduation gem long in 2mm spaces. The length of the bubble used is about 25 div., or 5c""o. The values of the levels are 1"·94 for level No. 7 and r" "86 for No. 8. The mounting of the vials has been attended to with special care, with the aim of securing the greatest possible constancy of adjustment. The glass vial rests within a tube of nickel iron upon the ends of four smaq screws b,, piercing the tube, two at each end of the vial, r 20° apart. A small tip c,, at the end of a flat spring fastened to the tube and also piercing it, presses with sufficient force upon the vial at each end, exactly over the supporting screws, to hold it firmly in place aqd yet permit it to expand and contract independently of the tube. Longitudinally the vial is confined by a cork ring d, at each end, which, however, leave a small clearance, so that the vial is free also in that direction. This is the manner in which all level vials, excepting only the smaller ones, have been mounted in the shops of the Survey for the past thirteen years. The level tube, with the vial thus supported, is secured to the telescope, sunk through an oblong opening close to the cone formed by the apertur'es of the objective and reticle ring. At the forward end it is held by a screw holding it down to a rounded support e,, screwed to the telescope, upon which it can be moved laterally by two opposing screws for adjusting the ''wind.'' The other end is made adjustable in the vertical for the purpose of keeping the level parallel to the line of collimation. This is the only adjustment required on the part of the observer in the field. A square-headed vertical screw f,, of about 27 threads per centimeter and fitting closely in the level tube end, is threaded tightly into that part of the telescope forming the forward drawtube bearing. Two strong helical steel springs, one on each side, press the level tube tightly upward against the shoulder of the screw f.. A socket wrench, with a lever arm 7cm.5 long, permits of applying rotary force to the screw without exerting any other pressure against the instrument and thereby displacing the pointing of the telescope, as is the case when using a screw-driver or capstan bar, so that this delicate adjustment is made quickly and with ease, and seldom requires to be repeated. As already stated, the adjustment of the reticle is made permanently in the shop, the observer having no means of testing it in the field. It is of great importance, therefore, that the reticle ring should not be disturbed, but that, when necessary, the level be moved into parallelism with the pointing line. In a new instrument the writer

532

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPOR'f, I9<J<l.

would conceal the four screws holding the reticle ring and so prevent displacement of the line of collimation. It may be of interest to state here the manner in which the error of collimation is determined in the field, which can not be done better than by quoting from a set of instructions issued to the observers:
Once during each <lay of observation the error of the level should be determined in the regular course of the leveling an<l recorded in a separate opening of the record book, as follows: The ordinary observations at an instrument station being completed, transcribe the last fore sight reading as part of the error detennination, call up the back rod and have it placed about IO"' back of the instrument, read the rod, move the instrument to a p::>sition about wm hehiml the front rod, read the front rod, and then the back rod. The rod readings timst be taken with the bubble in the middle of its tube. The required constant Cto be determined, namely, the ratio of the required correction to any rod reading to the corresponding subtended interval isE

= (sum()Fdistant rod intervals) -

( sum of near rod readings) - (sum of distant rod readings). (sum of near rod intervals).

The level should not be adjusted if C is less than 0·005. If a new adjustment of the level is made, C should at once be redetermined. It is desirable to have the determinations of level error made under the ordinary conditions as to length of sight, character of ground, elevation of line of sight above the ground, etc.

The value 0·005 for C means that the line tangent to the level vial at its middle point makes an angle of approximately three seconds with the pointing line of the telescope. The following statement of the behavior of the instruments in the field,* showing the constancy with which they maintain their adjustment, will testify to the fine workmanship put upon them, for which credit is due to Mr. C. Jacomini and 0. Storm, instrument makers of the Survey:
The instrument was carefully put in adjustment at \Vashin1,>1:on and sent by express to a point in Kentucky. The observer there, on beginning work with it, found it to be still in adjustment and continued to use it for one and one-half months, during which time the value C never exceeded 0·005. At the end of that time it suddenly showed a magnitude of 0·015, which was corrected. After constant use for nearly one and one-half months more, the record showed the greatest error to be o·oo6. The mean algebraic value of C during this period was 0·002, or but little more than one second of arc.

+

The attendant carrying the instrument from station to station readily learns to hold it in such position as to prevent any change of the length of the bubble by establishing communication between the chamber and interior of the vial. In the vials used for these instruments the openings in the chambers are not at the bottom, but slightly to the side, away from the reading device.
H.

THE LEVE'L READING DEVICE.

The operation of reading the position of three fine lines, the spider threads, projected upon the graduation of the level rod is a trying one under the best conditions, and subjects the observer, when the air is hazy or unsteady, to severe strains. As it is of the highest importance that these readings be taken only at the instant when the level indicates horizontality of the line of sight, the instrument should be designed particularly with a view to the observer's comfort, so as to enable him to observe the rod and the level as nearly as possible simultaneously. It is thought that the level - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - · - - - - - - - - -·----------------------------------·~See

reading device provided for these instruments fulfills all requirements, since only the time required for transferring mental attention from one object to another need elapse between the two observations. It is a modification of that used by Berthelemy, of Paris, in his precise level,* which consists of two adjustable prisms mounted upon the stride level and three prisms mounted in a casing fastened to the wye support of the telescope, with a short tube immediately on the side of the latter reaching as far as the eyepiece. Besides the objectionable feature of the overloaded stride level, the design has the fault of requiring the observer to shift his head between observations upon the rod and the level. The modined form here described was already applied in the spring of 1899, when precise levels Nos. I, 5, and 6 were remodeled, and it was amply tested in the field

during the season of that year; but in designing an entirely new instrument it was possible to improve greatly upon the manner of its application. Two clamp rings, g,. Fig. 3, support an aluminum tube with an eye end reaching back to a point even with the eyepiece of the telescope when focused for an average distance. Against this tube is screwed a dovetail bar, h,, Figs. 6 and 7, upon which move, within the tube, two slides, i, and J,, carrying the prisms k, and l,. These slides are connected by arms with a lever mounted upon a stem with a milled head, 111 the rotation of which moves the prisms equally toward or away from a central point between them. This motion is provided to adjust the distance of the prisms accurately to the length of the bubble, which, during the day's work, may vary by reason of temperature changes. Those

faces of the prisms which are directed toward the eye are ground to such curvatures as, with the aid of a lens mounted between them and the eye end, to reduce to that of distinct vision of the nonnal eye the distance from the end of the bubble to the eye, by way of the mirror w, the reflecting faces of the prisms k, l, and the lens. For thr benefit of the observer required to use glasses the eye cap of the level reading tube is arranged to hold such a lens as he may require to enable him to observe without spectacles. The distance between the level reading tube and the telescope can be changed to suit each individual observer, and provision is made for the rotary adjustment of the prisms and the ,nirror necessary in consequence of any such change, as ,can be seen in Fig. 3. The appearance of the field of view of the level reading device is also shown in Fig. 3. The prisms are put in such position by means of the milled head, m,, that the ends of the bubble and the graduation marks above them are brought into view, appearing as if the bubble were very short. The lines forming the graduation upon the level vial are marked by small dots in such manner that symmetrical lines, or lines equidistant from the center of the graduation, are readily distinguishable, thus relieving the observer of any strain in guarding against mistakes.
I. THE FINISH.

The telescope throughout its length-with the exception of the eye end of the draw tube and the two collars turned to equal diameters-the supporting cylinder, and the level tube were covered with a heavy coating of cloth dust of a bluish-gray color. This coating is put on by painting the parts with a mixture of Japan varnish, turpentine, and linseed oil, which is colored with white lead, lampblack, and ultramarine blue, to the same shade as that of the cloth dust; the latter is sifted over the freshly varnished pieces through a hair screen and pressed in with the hand. After allowing it to dry for two days and brushing off all loose cloth dust, a coating of a dilute solution of bleached shellac in alcohol is applied. This finish has the appearance cf a fine quality of cloth, and affords considerable protection against sudden and temporary changes of temperature. Other parts of the instrument, as the instrument base, mirror frame, level reading tube, etc., are finished in black enamel of the kind introduced so extensively through the bicycle industry. It is heavy, hard though elastic, and surpasses in appearance and durability any of the black lacquers heretofore used in the art of instrument making.
j.

THE WEH;HT.

The weight of the instrument is skg ·· 2. No doubt this can be considerably reduced when tubing made of nickel steel is obtainable in the market. The thickness of the cast tubing-about twice as great as would be necessary if wrought metal could be substituted-is considered as small as is safe to use in view of the loose texture of the alloy. The weight of the tripod, 7·ir·.2, is somewhat greater than that of stands formerly used for the same class of instruments. This is due to the much greater length required in order to enable the observer to stand erect, which is considered of sufficient advantage to warrant a small sacrifice in the matter of weight.

PREFACE TO PART IV

A.

A little more than two centuries ago appeared the Principia of Newton, explaining the motions of the solar system and referring the tides to their primal cause. But the question as to how, or the mechanism whereby, the tides along various shores result from the disturbing forces of the sun and moon is still open. In fact few writers of note have in recent years cared to hazard their reputations on a problem so hopeless, where observations, if not vague and uncertain, generally seemed hard to reconcile with any hypothesis. But these two centuries have cleared away much of the mystery of ocean depths. As a consequence, whoever now attempts to explain the tides has a decided advantage over his predecessors; but it must not be inferred that such information is yet adequate for his purpose. He has another great advantage in more extensive and more accurate observations. In this matter, however, there has been much inexcusable negligence. For instance, recent scientific expeditions have seldom made careful records concerning the tides when visiting distant or unknown shores. Again, although the ancient Egyptians gauged the height of their river and were the inventors of the nilometer-a simple but accurate form of tide gauge-at the present time there seems to exist no systematic record of the tide for any port, except Cape Town, on the Atlantic or Mediterranean coast of Africa. It is to be hoped that observations will soon be undertaken in all hitherto neglected parts of the world, and the results worked out and published, in order that the questions which have puzzled philosophers for the last two hundred years may be answered with tolerable certainty in the near future. In preparing these chapters entitled ''Outlines of Tidal Theory'' no attempt has been made at anything beyond rude approximations to the cases found in nature; and even the results of these efforts may upon subsequent investigation, or upon comparison with values obtained from future observations, prove to be erroneous in many respects. However this may be, it will, I think, be admitted that the ways of attack here outlined, though containing in themselves little that is really new, are more promising than those generally followed in attempts to explain the tides and tidal phenomena. In fact little or nothing is included in these chapters which does not in some manner or degree apply to tidal motions somewhere existing; and so the hypothetical problems worked out by Laplace and elaborated and extended by several able mathematicians of later date, though commonly known as " Tidal Theory,'' are not considered at this time, important as they are from certain points of view. It is assumed here that the tides are in most cases due to one of two modes of generation: the first, that implied in the corrected equilibrium theory, and which applies to small deep bodies of water; the second, and far more important, that of stationary waves or oscillating systems whose free periods are approximately the periods of the tidal
537

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

forces. For some small bodies of water, however, an explanation involving their forced oscillations should be resorted to in preference to the equilbrium theory. Whether or not the systems outlined upon the charts of the world (Figs. 23, 24) really exist and serve to explain the tides, it is certain that they, or similar systems, will assist a person in seeing and bearing in mind the cotidal hours of various parts of the world, as well as in forming some estimate of the relative amounts of the rise and fall. I am indebted to members of the Tidal Division for assistance in copying manuscript and preparing the tables included in and following the text, and especially to Mr. J. C. Hoyt for tracing the accompanying maps from various sources. The depths and contour lines of the Pacific Ocean, shown upon the charts of depths (Figs. 19, 20), are taken from an unpublished compilation made by Mr. A. Lindenkohl, of this Survey.

By. ROLLIN A. HARRIS.

CHAPTER I.
TIDAL FORCES AND EQUILIBRIUM TIDES.

Harmonic development ef the horizontal forces. Ins 39, Part I,* it has been shown that although the vertical disturbing forces are of about the same magnitude as the horizontal, the latter alone are responsible for the production of the tides. In any attempt at preseuting a tidal theory which may in a measure account for the phenomenon in a rational manner, it is therefore natural to give at the outset a ready means of ascertaining these forces in any given locality. The uncorrected equilibrium tide (the density of water being small as compared with that of the solid earth) constitutes a convenient representation of the tide-producing potential. But when the height of this hypothetical tide is used for the potential, it must be borne in mind that the unit of the forces which are obtained by differentiation is g, or the force of gravity acting upon a unit mass, say upon a pound of matter. The ratio of a, horizontal disturbing force to the furce of gravity, denotes the angle (radian measure) by which the plumb line is deviated from the vertical.

Thus the ellipse and the radiating lines denoting the forces at equal intervals of time constitute a distant view of a spoked wheel, the axis of the wheel is supposed to make an angle of 90° -A with the line of sight. In north latitudes the semidiumal force lines are numbered clockwise from the south; in south latitudes they are numbered counterclockwise from the north. See accompanying figure, which shows the magnitude and direction of the tidal forces at each ten degrees of latitude; the lettering and number.ing are for points north of the equator.

Here also the ellipse and radiating lines constitute a distant view of a spoked wheel. In north latitude below 45 °, the diurnal force arrows arc numbered counterclockwise from the north. Farther north they are numbered clockwise from the south. In south latitude less than 45 °, they are numbered clockwise from the north. Farther south they are numbered counterclockwise from the south. The value of the ratio U /a is o·ooo ooo 0842; and so the magnitude of the forces represented by the axis of the ellipses are o·ooo ooo 1684 C. cos A. sin A., o·ooo ooo 1684 C2 cos A. for semidiurnals, and o·ooo ooo 1684 C, cos 2 A, o·ooo ooo 1684 C, sin A. for diurnals; gravity acting on unit mass being the unit force. For M is 0·45426 (Table l), and for K, 0,, C, is 0·45378. In case of these components, then, o·ooo ooo 1684 C. and o·ooo ooo 1684 C, became o·ooo ooo 0765 and o·oo0 ooo 0764 respectively. Similarly for other components. In the figure a length (about ~ of an inch) representing 5 degrees of latitude denotes a force equal to 0·0·10 000 I 684 C,(/ for semidiurnals, and to o·ooo 000 1684 C, fl for diurnals; in particular it denotes o·ooo ooo 0765 {I for ::'\I 2 and o·ooo ooo 0764 ,rt for K, 0,.

Let e denote the distance (expressed in feet) of a given point east from the no-tide point, ands its distance south; then at any instant the height of the tide (Hor I-I,.+ H.) is e X eastward slope (numerically equal to the eastward component force) s X southward slope (or southward component force). As the constituent tides will generally best be considered separately, H will, for the present, generally denote a height due to but one of these terms; consequently Hr, H. each have a time factor and so may be written in the form

Suppose that we wish to find the direction of the line of high water ( cotidal line) at any given time after the transit of the fictitious body. This is converted into angle by multiplying by speed c; the tangent of this angle is then found and used in (25). It is generally best to suppose tin-.e to be reckoned in C-hours, and so the hourly speed c to be 30° for semidinrnals and 15° for diurnals. The great advantage of using C-time rather than mean solar time is that the same force diagram or cotidal diagram may be directly applied to all semidiurnal or diurnal tidal constituents, as the case may be.

The value of the azimuth shows that the cotidal lines form with one of the ellipses of equal range the perspective of a spoked wheel. By regarding the east-andwest direction of the force ellipse as being south-and· north, and increasing the numbering of the hours by three, the force diag-ram will represent an ellipse of equal range and the cotidal lines radiating from the no-tide point.

These ellipses may be obtained by regarding the east-and-west direction of the force ellipses as being south-and-north, provided we multiply the latter by If, and divide by the product of the semiaxes. The radiating lines with their numbering altered by six then represent cotidal lines. Fig. 3 shows the cotidal lines and the lines of equal rise and fall for a diurnal component in latitude 30° north. The amplitudes are given in terms of UC,. This quantity is 0'467 foot for K,, 0·332 for 0,, 0·154 for P,, 0·799 for K, 0,. It may be noted here that the time of tide at any point can be found from the force diagrams as they stand in the following manner: Connect the given point with the no-tide point by a straight line. Find where a line perpendicular to this line is tangent to the ellipse. The radiating hour line passing through this point of tangency shows the hour of high or low water. For, this hour line and the hour line passing through the same point when the diagram is turned in the manner mentioned above form a pair of conjugate axes of the ellipse. Being conjugates, they are orthographic representatives of diameters of a circle which cut each other perpendicularly, and so have numbers differing by 3 for semidiurnals and 6 for diurnals. (See§ 40, Part I.)

Cotidal lines for larger areas.

When the body of water is more than a hundred or two hundred miles in diameter, the true cotidal lines begin to differ from those just described and to depend upon the shape of the bounding shore line. It is, however, not a very difficult matter to construct' cotidal lines for any given enclosed sea. For doing this we can make use of an

552

equatorial stereographic projection of the sphere showing the outlines of the body of water. Once for all can be made upon a like projection, a drawing of the uncorrected equilibrium semidiurnal tide, also one for the diurnal as in Fig. 4. Ry noting the heights of the contour lines along ahy given parallel of latitude, we see that if the

projection rotate uniformly about its pole the rise and fall of the uncorrected or hypothetical equilibrium tide along the parallel will be a simple harmonic motion. Consequently, if an aggregate of points or elementary areas constituting the surface of the given sea be considered, the average hypothetical tide for the whole body will follow to the same simple law. If the sea happens to he symmetrical with respect to

553

the north-and-south line, then the zero hour of the tide diagram can be placed upon this central line, and the amplitude of the hypothetical rise and fall of the whole sea ascertained at once by multiplying each elementary area by its respective thickness, adding, and then dividing the resulting volume by the total area. If no such symmetry exists, then a similar process should be pursued for each twelfth or twenty-fourth part of the

Fig. 4.

rotation. The resulting heights can then be plotted or analyzed anJ the amplitude determined. The corrected height of tide for any given point on the enclosed sea, and at any given time, is found by noting the uncorrected height upon the tide diagram and taking from it the simultaneous height of the enclosed sea as a whole. The time of high water is found by ascertaining the resultant maximum of the two simple harmonic or sine curves of like period just referred to, one representing the uncorrected or hypothetical

554

equilibrium tide for the point in question, the other the same for the given sea as a whole, but with its vertical ordinates reversed. This latter curve represents what might be regarded as a correction to the uncorrected equilibrium tide. Figs. 5 and 6 show the cotidal lines and lines of equal amplitude for a diurnal tide in a circular sea of 20° radius, the latitude of the center Leing 30° north. Taking UC

Here I is zero whenever the tidal body passes the meridian of the center of the sea, and l denotes longitude west from the central meridian. The cotidal lines have reference to this meridian. The times of maximum and minimum height at any assumed point of the circular sea are evidently given by the equation G,sin'(15/-t)=o·794si1115t;

that is, given any two of the three quantities A, I, and t, the remaining one becomes known by this equation.

CHAPTER II.
HYDRODYNAMICS.

5. This chapter treats of a liquid as being sensibly perfect and incompressible. By peifect is meant that the elementary particles glide upon one another without
resistance, and so whatever stress exists between them is normal and one of compression. The densifJ' (p) of a liquid is the mass of a unit volume or per unit volume. The density of distilled water at 4 ° C. is one gram (mass) per cubic centimeter. The heaviness (y) of a liquid is the weight of a unit volume or per unit volume. Heaviness= fl X density,

g being the acceleration of gravity.
Whenever it is stated or implied that weight =(I X mass, or mass= weight -+- g, the meaning is that although a given lump of matter has a fixed mass usua:lly expressed in pounds or grams, its actual weight must be divided by .r1 in clyna1JJical equations if gravitation force units are there used. When a pound of matter is taken as the unit of mass, the uniform force acting for one second required to impart to it a velocity of 32 feet per second may be denoted by g, or 32 if the units are properly chosen. The force required to impart to a pound of matter a velocity of I foot per second is one pound (force) -+-the numerical value of g. This absolute unit force is called apoundal. Pound (force) and poundal would become identical upon a sphere where the intensity of gravity is 3"12' of its terrestrial value. The centimeter-gram-second unit of force is called a dyne. It is a force equivalent to the weight of a gram divided by r; or 981. The gram (force) and dyne would become identical upon a sphere where the intensity of gravity is v·h of its terrestrial value. · A pound force ( i. e., 32 poundals, or a force equivalent to the force required to be applied to a pound of matter to overcome gravity) acting through a distance of one foot against an equal resisting force, performs a foot-pound of work." A dyne force, acting through a distance of one centimeter against an equal resisting force, performs an erg of work. The resisting force is often the force of inertia of the body to which forces are applied. Work is thus done upon the body; it is positive when it increases the velocity of the body. When a body is capable of performing work it is said to possess energy. Energy, like the work which it represents or may create, is measured in foot-pounds, footpoundals, or in ergs. Kinetic energ_y exists by virtue of the motions of the body. All other energy which the body may have is called potential. Suppose a body to start from rest at a given height and fall in vacuo. Its potential energy before the fall is
g X mass X height.
556

APPENDIX NO. 7.

OUTLINES OF TIDAL THEORY.

557

But the velocity acquired at or very near the end of the fall, when its potential energy becomes zero, is given by the equation
v2

= 2f/ X height;
height=v2.

and so

2y

This substituted in the original expression fur energy gives for its value

tv'

X

mass.

(43)

The form of energy is now wholly kinetic. In case of liquids the height due to velocity (42) is sometimes called the velocity head. The potential of a body or bodies at a given point is such a function of the coordinates of the point that its partial derivative in any given direction is equivalent to minns the . . . the force exerted by the body or bodies upon a matenal pmnt of unit maS& situated at this point, the force at the point being taken in the same direction as the differentiation. Hence, generally, the values assigned to surfaces of equal potential increase . decrease as we go outward from an attractmg body, but . as we go outward mcrease d ecrease from a body which repels. We s~iall always assume that the bodies attract. But as to which definition of potential may seem preferable will depend upon circumstances. In Part II and in Chapter I, Part IV (A), the second definition was the one used; hereafter the first will generally be understood. The material point, if free to move, will pass lower . , . . . toward a surface of . potential. For a pomt above a spherical, attracting body 1 ng 1 1er like the earth and distant r from its center, we have, denoting by R the (essentially negative) force along r increasing,

Being defined through differentiation, the potential does not have, -like energy or like work, an absolute value. But, having assigned to one equipotential surface a definite value, the values belonging to the others become fixed. Since at any equipotential surface we can, presumably, calculate the work required to remove a unit of mass to infinity, or the energy of a particle as it reaches this surface starting from rest at infinity, we can take this as the numerical value of the potential at the given surface. To this is to be prefixed the sign =F. The gravitational potential, which is essentially

If gravitation force units are used, expression ( 48) shews that the difference in potential is numerically equal to the difference in level. In the case of liquids, the height is sometimes called the potential head. If absolute force units are used, then, numerically, Potential head =po ten ti al+ g, (50)

omitting the constant in (48). 6. When used in connection with solid bodies, or with solid bodies and a fluid, the word pressure means a force, and this, like any other force, has a fixed direction. To ascertain the nature of internal fluid pressure, imagine a very small sphere to be immersed in and float with the fluid. In other words, let a minute portion of the fluid be replaced by a solid sphere of like density. The fluid can exert only normal pressure, because otherwise a tangential stress would be called into play, and this perfect fluids do I not possess. The intensity of the pressure (or pressure per unit area) upon this very small sphere will be the same in any chosen direction; otherwise this sphere. would move relatively to the neighboring particles of the fluid, which it does not do. It is to be remarked that the hypothetical sphere or other body which we may imagine for aiding the conception of pressure, is extremely minute in comparison with one of the elements into which the fluid will be supposed to be divided in obtaining the so-called equations of motion. Hence we can speak of the pressure (or the iii tensity of pressure) at any particular. point, meaning thereby the force exerted upon a minute unit area situated at that point. Since this unit of area may face any direction, the direction of fluid pressure at a given point is indeterminate, but its magnitude or intensity is a perfectly definite quantity, depending, at a given instant, upon the coordinates of the point. In other words, we can, for a given instant, construct surfaces of equal pressure, just as we can construct equipotential surfaces with reference to the earth or other attracting body.

In a stagnant body of water the pressure increases directly with the depth below the surface, and so the surfaces of equal pressure are horizontal planes. Fluid pressure resembies potential as given by the first definition in that a particle under its influence tends from a surface of given pressure toward one of lower pressure. The force per unit area urging the fluid element to move in any direction, r, is
R or-

~/!. Jr

The value of the pressure at a given point in a liquid is often known, or

measured, by the depth of liquid above the point, together with the weight of the atmosphere. On the other hand, like gravitational potential according to the second definition, fluid pressure is regarded as essentially positive. The energy or work expended in replacing a given volume of liquid where the pressure is P-per square unit is equal top multiplied by the volume. For, suppose that we imagine the cavity containing this volume of liquid to be so partitioned with walls of no thickness that it consists of a coil or heap of slender canals or pipe whose cross section is everywhere of the same small unit area. Suppose one mouth of this canal to terminate in the liquid, while in the other mouth a pisto1; head is inserted. The work done by the pi~ton head in driving out the liquid is clearly equal top X cross section X the length of canal, or p times the volume of liquid displaced.
7. Benzoulli's theorem. . These definitions may be illustrated by an example. Suppose we have two elastic bags connected by a small pi;_Je, all being· filled with a liquid. Suppose that pressures are applied to the outer surface of each .bag such that the constant pressure at cross section F, of the pipe should be P, (as indicated by a piezometer) and at F., P.; determine the motion in the pipe, taking for granted the principle that no energy is gained or lost in this region where the motion is steady. In the flow of a liquid, energy is being continually changed from potential to kinetic, or vice versa. Through a given cross section the quantity of water passing in unit time is measured by the product of velocity and cross section. Consider two cross sections of the tube F,, F.;· the mass passing F, per unit time is p v, F,, while the equal mass passing F. is p v. F,. . ·. v, r~ = v. F ·. (51)

The work done on this region by the mass entering F, per unit of time is p, i1, F,, while the amount done 011 the region beyond F. by the mass as it leaves at is P. v. F.,; for, work = pressure X volume displaced, § 6. The former mass brings into the region considered extending from F, to F. the energy

0·757, respectively. It will be noted that as the curves approach a pennane11' relation (i. e., a relation independent of the initial conditions) they follow the outside tide by intervals of about 29° and s 1°, respectively, while the amplitudes are about o·s7 and 0·63. These agree fairly well with approximate results given below. Assuming the tide semidiurnal, (70) gives E = 0·00002314, 0·00001326. In other words, if a float box were 1 foot square and the orifice admitting the water-.were a square 0·00481, or 0·00364 foot on a side, we should obtain the delay and diminution of amplitude here shown. This, of course, makes no allowance for the resistance and the vena contracta. The construction of any such curve from a cosine curve whose equation is z = cos x is facilitated by the use of a parabola whose equation is

z' = K../ [cos x- z] = K../d.
This parabola should be drawn ttpon·cross-section paper numbered up to unity on the a-axis, also to unity on the z'-axis. From the cosine curve and the curve under construction we find d, and from the parabola K..; d, or by ( 69),

~:.

The paper should

be cut along the z'-axis, also along a line parallel to it and distant unity from the same. If a radian on the x-scale is not equal to a unit on the z-scale we transfer the Value Of the tangent (K../d) to the principal sheet, not from the extreme edge of the sheet containing the parabola, but from a line a radian distant from the z'-axis, the vertex of the parabola being placed at the point last determined on the curve being constructed. It would be an easy matter to construct a hydraulic apparatus for drawing such curves; in other words, for integrating the differential equation ( 69). The curves drawn show that as the amplitude diminishes, high and low water stands are very short for the inner body; also, that the marigram is almost a straight line from a high to a low water. Hence there must be a large M6 and we must have 3M2° - M6° = o, very nearly. Thus we see the origin of an overtide where the shallowness of the water is not responsible. The ordinates of the current curves in the strait are proportional to the slopes 01 these curves. Hence the ordinates (velocities) change rapidly at the times of high and low water within, and so slack water is of very short duration. For intermediate times the slope of. the inner marigram is nearly constant, and so the velocities of considerable value continue for a long time. (Cf. § 36, Part I.) The velocity curve being the derivative of the height curve, it follows that the ratio of the amplitude of the sixthdiumal current component to that of the semidiurnal is three times as great as the \."Orresponding tidal ratio. Hence current curves will show when wave motion b~gins to give way to motion due simply to. difference of head much clearer than will tidal marigrams. Let us assume that the height within may ultimately (i. e., when the initial conditions have disappeared) be represented by the periodic function

In § 37, Part I, it was noted that the velocity in a strait connecting two large bodies of water, one or both of which are tided, is of the form (71). In the present case both bodies have tides, but the rise and fall of the inner body is due t~ water transmitted to it from the outer. As already stated, its vertical velocity is prop<;>rtional to the horizontal velocity of the water in the strait. For an orifice or short strait so small that the rise and fall of the inner body is several or many times less than the rise and fall outside, the velocity will at each instant be very nearly proportional to the square root of the height outside reckoned from mean level (65). From this law of variation it follows that any rather small increase in the amplitude of the tide outside increases the amplitude of the velocity of the current in the strait by only one-half as large a percentage of its mean value. In other words, S)M.., N)M.., etc., in the strait will be only one-half as great as the

corresponding tidal ratios outside; also, ignoring any differences in the duration of the range, the ratios S)M 2 , N)M., etc., should be one-half as great for the inner body as for the outer.

The current epochs refer to maximum velocity. If the outer wave consists of a diurnal and semidiurnal part, the coefficients of these parts for the inner body can be determined for any given case. For a first approximation it may be assumed that if the outer wave be written
z,= A, cos 2x

the inner may be written

z =A cos (2.x +a)+ B cos (x

(80)

Then, by giving to x four arbitrary values such as x = o, - la, - {:J, - f:J,, the unknown quantities A, B, <X, /3 can be determined. Reasoning as before, we see that for an orifice or short strait so very small that the tide produced in the inner body has no considerable effect upon the current, the ratio (K,+ 6,) IM. should be one-half as great as the corresponding ratios for the tides outside. The ratio ( K, 0,) I M., if small, is about one-half as great for the inner as for the outer body. But when or where the durations of the four ranges of a day differ considerably, the diurnal inequality inside will be increased by this fact. For it is obvious tha~ the longer the duration of a range the more will the inner body be raised or lowered by the water flowing in or out, and vice ver$a for a short range. The difference in phase between the diurnal and semidiurnal waves will be about the same for the current in the strait af: for the tide outside; that is :M; - (K~ O~) should be about equal to M~ -CK~+ O~). The corresponding difference for the tide inside will be altered somewhat.

In the flow of water in a pipe of uniform cross section the velocity is the same throughout-that is, it is independent of x, y, z, but may depend upon t. To see how this can be so, imagine two large reservoirs connected with a pipe of any length. Suppose water is so supplied or withdrawn that there is, say, a periodic rising and falling of the surface of one of. them. The velocities at all points in the pipe are alike at any given instant, because it is assumed that pressure is transmitted instantaneously; but they vary with the time. For steady motion the velocity is constant for all time and at each cross section of this pipe. If we substitute for this pipe one of variable cross section, then even for steady motion the velocity will depend upon x, y, z. General expressions for acceleration in any fluid body.-If we are concerned with successive positions of the same particle it is obvious that x, y, z depend upon the initial dx dy dz coordinates and t.

An equation of motion for any particular direction is a formal expression for the dynamical proposition (which is an immediate result of D' Alembert's principle): Elementary mass X acceleration = force applied to elementary mass - resistance due to increase of pressure on opposite faces of the elementary volume. The term constituting the left-hand member of this equation denotes the effective force. The first term on the right represents an impressed force like gravity acting upon the fluid particle. The effect of pressure may be illustrated by the well-known tendency of the atmosphere to flow from a region of high pressure to one of low, thereby causing the winds. For the x-direction 'we have

In a fluid each particle is free to move anywhere independently of all others. That is, individual constraints between the neighboring particles are wanting, though in a ·collective manner certain restraints are responsible for the pressures to which the different portions of the fluid are subjected. But the rigid surfaces which bound the fluid have their equations. These are the only equations which are analogous to the ordinary constraint relations in the dynamics of a material system whose particles are definitely connected. The equation of the free surface· of a liquid involves the consideration of continuity in its determination; but if the equation of the free surface (generally involving t) were given, together with the equations of the other bounding surfaces, they would constitute all of the conditional equations. That is,. they and the three equations of motion fix or define the movement of the liquid. 15. Two-dimensional motion.

When these relations are satisfied, X i Y is a monogenic function of x ry, and conversely.

For the present we may suppose that the required solution <p is the X or Yof some monogenic function. X and Yare conjugate functions in x, y; x and y are conjugate functions in X, Y. If one plane be divided orthogonally and isothermally by a pair of curve systems, so is the other. All angles are preserved except at the critical points.

Along fixed boundaries the normal component of the velocity must be zero. This requires that¢ = constant at all points of such boundaries. If a portion of the boundary be moving uniformly along the x-direction with a velocity U, then along this portion we must have¢= - Uy+ constant. Similarly, if it move with a velocity Vin the y-direction, we must have ¢ = Vx constant. If the velocity of the liquid exceed a certain limit, there will occur, especially beyond a sharp cape or edge, a region of nearly still water separated from the moving water by a surface of discontinuity. Along this surface the pressure must be constant, otherwise there could be no still water adjacent to it. The velocity of the moving water along this surface must, therefore, be constant; this is one of the boundary conditions to be satisfied when discontinuous motion is contemplated. The problem of finding functions which satisfy prescribed boundary conditions has received the attention of Schwarz, Christoffel, Kirchoff, and others. The following references may be given here: A. B. Bassett, A Treatise on Hydrodynamics, Vol. I, Chs. V, VI; J. J. Thomson, Notes on Recent Researches in Electricity and Magnetism, Ch. III; Horace Lamb, Hydrodynamics, Ch. IV. This theory, as will be pointed out below, finds only limited applications to tides and tidal currents. For this reason only a few examples will be given. In the theory of functions it is usual to denote by z, = x £y, the independent variable; that is, the variable whose paths are assumed to be straight lines dividing the z-plane into equal elementary squares, or to be some other simple curves. In hydrodynamics it is convenient to assume that the paths of Z, = X £ Y, divide the Z-plane into equal elementary squares. Regarding z as a function of Z,· the curves in the z-plane which are images of X constant or Y = constant must conform to the prescribed boundary conditions. In practice, the line¢= constant, which coincides with a given boundary, is usually a reduced i·mage, because the bounding walls are usually straight lines or some other simple curves, while the other stream lines are curves of a higher order. It is to. be particularly noted that any functional transformation gives a solution for an indefinite number of possible hydrodynamical problems. For, along any stream line a boundary wall may be erected and the motion will go on as before. The motion of a curved stratum of uniform thickness can be obtained by conform-

The vortex theory of Descartes supposed matter carried about the axes of the.sun and earth in spherical shells or vortices; we can imagine as many plane circular orbits. This example shows that if the motion have a velocity-potential the periodic times of the planets must then be as the squares of their respective distances. Newton found the same rule in considering spherical layers of a viscous fluid between which the resistance varies directly with the relative velocities. But this rule contradicts Kepler's third law.

If, further, c, = c. = = o, then either X = o or Y = o gives a reduced image consisting of m right lines drawn through the origin radiating at uniform angles. Either set may ·be taken as straight rigid walls of a boundary. If m = o and n = I, then X =constant gives a system of circles tangent at d, to a line drawn parallel to the ; -axis, and Y = constant a system tangent at d, to a line drawn parallel to the x-axis.

Assuming the hyberbolas to be the stream lines, the transformation represents the flow through an opening two units in width in a straight partition extending to infinity in either direction. It also represents the motion between two capes or headlands whose outlines coincide with two of the hyperbolas. By observing such systems of curves drawn to scale, it will be seen that such a cape or headland must be quite slender in order th it the velocity there be several times as great as at the center of the opening. Hence it often happens that at capes and headlands tidal streams are not sufficiently increased in velocity to become especially noticeable.

For X-= constant where o constant < 90°, the images are lines, generally curved, ex.tending from the origin to the opposite corner of the square. If at one of these corners of the square a line source be located and at the other a sink, the curves X =constant will denote the stream lines.

For three-dimentional motion the coefficient of contraction must, m general, be between ! and 1. See Lamb, Hydrodynamics, pp. 27, w5. 2 1. Dijficulties in realizing two-dimensional motion. A steady motion such that the lines of motion of all water particles shall be horizontal and such that all those particles once in the same vertical line always remain in a vertical line, and so slow that the inertia of the water may be neglected, is not easily realized experimentally or in natural bodies of water. Yet such motion lends itself most readily to mathematical treatment. See §§ 16-19 for examples. Motion in a body of water of uniform depth does not generally approximate to this plane motion of mathematicians, for the motion is much retarded at the bottom and sides. Moreover, any sudden change of cross section or the presence of an angular projection into the body of water may cause the continuous stream-line motion to give way, unless the velocity be very slow, to discontinuous motion. There will be a comparatively swift stream bordered by masses of still water or countercurrents and eddies. In two extreme cases there is a realization of, or tendency toward, the simple mathematical plane motion. One of these is where very thin sheets of liquid are used. Experiments have been made by H. S. Hele-Shaw, which show the stream lines in the motion past certain obstacles by aid of a colored liquid injected into the colorless liquid at certain points, thus dividing the whole sheet into distinguishable bands. Some account of his work h; given in Nature, Vol. 57 ( 1898), p. 566; Vol. 58 ( 1898), pp. 34-36, 61, 467, 520, 535; Vol. 59 (1899), pp. 222-223. The other case is where the water is so deep that the motion is nearly alike from the top down to near the bottom, and where

APPENDIX NO. 7.

OUTLINES OF 'fIDAL THEORY.

the velocity is not sufficient to cause discontinuous motion due to sharp edges or angles. As the bottom or sides are approached the motion will be characterized by eddies, because right at such boundaries the velocity is generally assumed to be zero. In channels, straits, etc., the tid~l currents most nearly represent steady motion at the time of the greatest flood or ebb velocity. If at such times the velocity he not so great as to give rise to discontinuous motion attended with countercurrents, etc., the required motion will be partially realized. Of course, variations iu the depth prevent any natural body of water from being n good illustration. Nevertheless, obserYations show that off certain angular capes the velocity is greater than the mean, while the lines of motion bend around such capes as theory would imply; for example, Cape de la Hagne and Saint David's Head. Even in these cases eddies or countercurrents may occur behind headlands or in the smaller bays. (See Fig. 28.) Two-dimensional motion can in some cases be approximately realized by using a vertical sheet of water contained in a tank with glass front and back. This vessel can be partitioned to suit numerous problems. The region to be studied is always supposed to be sma11 in comparison with the area of the face of the tank; other-wise it would be difficult to approximately satisfy the conditions of any proposed problem. It may be well to note how a slow two-dimensional motion corresponding to a given qJ may possibly be approximately produced in the case of a very long channel or strip of very shallow water included between two given stream lines, provided that the element magnification (or the velocity) is about the same at each end of any equipotential line crossing the channel. Imagine a very shallow channel of uniform depth to lead from an inexhaustible supply of still deep water. Let the line of juncture be made to coincide with an equipotential ·Hne of the proposed motion. Let there be a slope along the given stream lines such that the velocity shall be. that required in the proposed motion, or

-~P..

'l'he velocity of a stream is constant at a given point and is under some con,

ceivable conditions proportional to

the square root of the slope.

The required

velocity would thus determine the slope of the stream lines at each point. The transverse slope is, by the above hypothesis, small in comparison to the slope along the stream lines. Having laid down the stream lines and curved the bottom to the right slope at each point, a level line can be drawn across them. Let this level line define the junction between the lower end of the channel and a deep body of water always maintained at a constant level. Now, by causing the surfaces of the two bodies of comparatively still water to be on slightly different levels, as determined above. the required steady flow may be approximately obtained. Were it in the nature of things possible for the slope of the bed to maintain at each 11oint a velocity proportional thereto (a possibility, perhaps, for very slow motions), then the restriction as to velocities at the two opposite sides would be unnecessary. Then the contour or level lines would be lines of equal velocity-potential; the lines of equal slope would be lines of equal velocity, and the lines orthogonal to these would be lines of equal direction. 22. Two-dimensional motion not applicable to the empt.ying or filling of reservoirs. Suppose that we have a large shallow reservoir of uniform depth.

horizoutal, is nearly steady for a considerable interval of time, and is too slow to cause discontinuous motion and eddies. A few illustrations will show some of the difficulties as well as some of the distinguishing features of such motion. A long rectangular tank being emptied by openings consisting of perforations suitably scattered over one end is the simplest case. Let the horizontal velocity of the water (as shown by floats extending nearly to the bottom) in the tank at this end be denoted by c, and let L denote the tank's length. At the closed end the velocity is zero. The general expression for the velocity (for discharge) is, therefore,

(151)

That is, lines of equal velocity-potential are close together at the end where the tank discharges and far apart at the closed end. The lines of motion are of course straight lines parallel to the sides of the tank. But these lines and the system <p = constant, where this constant takes equal increments, can not (save where xi L is small) form isothermal systems, although they are orthogonal. Had we taken a channel of uniform depth and having uniform velocity throughout its length, as a river, we might divide the surface into elementary squares instea4 of rectangles. Such lines would define approximately, were there no resistance at the sides, the fl.ow of a river, as shown by vertical floats extending from the surface to near the bottom. As another illustration of the present difficulty, let us assume a shallow circular tank with an opening at the center of the bottom, or having a small vertical pipe at the center, perforated in.all directions. Let the average velocity at unit's distance from the center be c. Let L denote the radius of the tank, where r = L the ve ocity is to be zero; then velocity at any distance r from the center is to the velocity at a (unit's) distance, r,, as the area of annulus outside of r is to the area of the annulus outside the r, circle directly, and inversely as r is to unity.

This formula is, of course, applicable to any sector of the circle; for, from the symmetrical character of the tank and opening, we know that all lines of motion must radiate from the center as straight lines. It has been shown in an example (§ 16) that the system of curves which would, with this system, divide the circle into squares is that obtained by omitting the second term .in the above expression for <p. For small values of r the second term of (I 52) becomes relatively insignificant. 23. Tidal streams are not generally due directly to a difference o/ level in the water's ' suiface at two localities. In wave motions, whether progressive or stationary, the water flows half of the time uphill and half of the time downhill. There are indeed verr few cases in nature

APPENDIX NO. 7.

OuTLINES OF TIDAL THEORY.

where wave motion of the tides gives way to motion whose \'elocity depends directly upon the then existing difference of level between the surfaces of two bodies of water; a few very contracted straits are the only conspicuous examples. The acceleration, however, depends directly upon the slope of the surface as was noted in § 1 I. Notwithstanding the fact that tidal streams are a part of some form of wave motion, their courses and relative velocities are mainly governed by the land, and so, in a measure, can be explained by aid of the preceding sections on continuous and discontinuous plane steady motion. See, for example, a chart of the Irish Sea, Fig. 28. In fact, the courses of tidal streams are governed by the land to a far greater extent than are those of permanent ocean currents. · Some cases where Torricelli's theorem applies will be noted in Chapter VIII.

CHAPTER III.
OSCILLATING AREAS.

24. This chapter treats of oscillations in sheets of water whose depths are small in compar:ison with their horizontal dimensions. 'fhe modes of oscillations obtained for a few simple areas havc a much wider application than is at first evident; for, if a thin, vertical wall be put in the place of any line of motion, the character of the motion of the liquid thus partitioned will remain the same as before. For instance, the period of slowest oscillation for one of the pointed strips in Fig. 9, or of several adjacent strips, is the period for a canal whose length is equal to the edge of one of the smaller squares. Hence we might combine one-half of one of these pointed strips with one-half of the canal just mentioned, and the period would remain unaltered. The problem before us is to solve the equation

harmonic in distance as well as in time. Moreover, we add any constant to the time angle of either term. Suppose the depth of the water to be such that the free period 111 the x-direction is a half lunar day, and in they-direction a half solar. Suppose that at the time of syzygy the lunar oscillation reaches elongation in the x-direction at a certain lunar hour, and the solar oscillation reaches elongation in the y-direction at a certain solar hour. The amplitude of the combined vertical oscillation will not become a maximum until a time shall have elapsed equal to the difference between the times just mentioned multiplied by 30 and divided by s m. = 1°'0159. In this way it is easy to see how the '' age'' or ''retard'' of the phase inequality under the above conditions might be several days, and be either positive or negative. It would be difficult to realize this condition in the tides of nature because ( l) of the requisite dimensions for the free oscillations and ( 2) of the fact that lunar and solar days are too nearly equal in length for having one set of forces incite oscillation in one direction only. For a partial realization of this effect see§ 78. 26. Square areas. A square area can oscillate in an infinite number of ways while the period remains constant. For, given the ·period, or the speed /K, then we may take as many terms of form ( 162) where h = h, as we please, the only conditions being

Let these be connected by, or supported upon, elastic bands running transverse to them and terminating at the edge of the square. These bands are thickest at the center and gradually get thinner toward the edges; or short unifonu bands might be used and their number might be made to so decrease as to bring about the same result. The law of the required thickness is given by ( 69), Part I. Now if a simple harmonic motion be imparted to the central slat, all others will have simple harmonic motion of like phase, but with amplitudes diminishing toward the sides of the square parallel to the slats. If the slats represent rows of water particles, their motion will truly represent the horizontal motion of an oscillation in the x-direction. Another set of grooved slats can be made to represent an oscillation in they-direction. The intersections of these two sets of grooves represent the horizontal motions of the water particles. The relative amplitude and phases of the two systems are taken at pleasure. The intersections may be marked either by pins, or by beams of light falling upon the apparatus.

By properly choosing the arbitrary constants it seems reasonable. to believe that an indefinite number of terms in the above ought to represent some of the modes of oscillation for a circle or almost .any other area. We have seen that for rectangular areas the ''s are periodic in x and y. This ought to be the case, because for the parts of a common area made up of any number of like rectangles C resumes the same values at distances in the x- and y-directions equal to twice the respective lengths of the rectangles. In a circular area, I; must either be free from the central a9gle fJ or be a periodic function of it. Hence we must have for I; one · or more terms of the form

The foregoing are some of the most simple cases of oscillating areas, the boundaries being complete and the depth uniform. As will be shown in the chapter on experiments, a stationary wave can be readily formed between two parallel walls, one or both of the ends of the area thus defined being open. In other words, the oscillation of the entire body of water need not always be taken into account, as in cases like the preceding, but only such portions as lie between the two parallel walls and a little distance beyond their extremities. It is assumed that care has been taken to so place the walls in the body of water that the oscillation between them will not be interfered.with from without. 29. Defi-nitions. As will be shown in Chapter VII, it is possible to divide the greater part of the ocean's surface into regions whose periods of free oscillation do not differ much from twelve lunar hours and in which it is possible for the tidal forces to incite a considerable tide. There are a few regions which have approximately twenty-four hours as one of their free periods. By oscillating area we shall usually mean an area, comparatively simple in form, whose free period of oscillation, were its boundaries all rigid, would not differ much from twelve (or twenty-four) lunar hours. All areas which oscillate together because of contiguity, form an oscillating system. The division of the principal part of the ocean's surface into a few systems is not arbitrary. Whether or not we shall suppose these systems divided into more simple regions styled ''areas'' is a matter of expediency to be decided by the purpose in hand. Generally areas partially inclosed by land resemble more or less an approximate rectangle, a right trapezoid, or a triangle. Areas having, or resembling, either of the first two forms, and somt:times even the third form, may be styled simple or canal-like. A.fractional oscillating area is an area having an oscillation, but which could not, because of its dimensions, oscillate in the required period were it completely surrounded by rigid walls. The axi:f of a simple area is an imaginary central line drawn parallel to the sides. A nodal line is a line within the area along which there is little or no rise and fall. A loop is a portion of an area where the rise and fall is comparatively great. In a rectangular area the distance between two nodal lines or loops is a lzaif-wave length, and is denoted by !71.. · The virtual lengtlz of an area is the length of a rectangular area of the same depth and having the same free period; both areas are supposed to oscillate according to one of their simplest modes. A boundary consisting of. shore line may be spoken of as rigid. Such a boundary may be called broken if it is pierced by one or more considerable openings or consists of a chain of islands. A boundary separating two areas that oscillate together, but along which there is generally a rise and fall, may be called latent or imaginary. A boundary vaguely marking the outer limits of an area, and along which there is generally little rise and fall, may be styled.free. The movement belonging to an oscillating area or system may be spoken of either as an oscillation or as a stationarJ' wave. The word ''oscillation'' is also used to denote the periodic movement; as, a certain body makes so many oscillations per minute. Viewer! from its assumed mode of oscillation, a simple area may be spoken of as a lzaif-roave area, a wlzole-wave area, etc.

The equation of continuity is satisfied. By hypothesis, a'· does not equal gl tanh lh; but a'·= qi' tanh l'h, say, where I' differs from I. Hence the dynamical equation, where X is put equal to zero, is no longer satisfied. If, however, we make
X = 2 A (a' - a'·) cosh lh sin lx cos (a't

(22 I)

the dynamical equation will be satisfied wherein a·= gl tanh llz. This shows that the oscillation is a forced one maintained by an external periodic force. The nearer a' approaches a the smaller may be the force X. If a > a' the phase of the horizontal component of the oscillation is the same as the phase of the force X; if a' > a the phases differ by 180°. 32. On three-dimensional standing waves.

In all cases of vertical walls as boundaries, the normal differentiation will be concerned only with x and y. Consequently the same x y-function used in the preceding chapter in expressions for t; can be transferred to the <p of the same problem in water not shallow. Given a tank of any shape having a horizontal bottom and vertical sides. Take a rectangular tank having the same depth of water and the same period of oscillation. The water in the two tanks will continue to oscillate together however the depths be altered, provided the (uniform) depth of water in the one be kept equal to the (uniform) depth in the other. See Table 52. When the depth is not uniform, the problem of determining the free oscillations or standing waves in limited bodies of water is very difficult. It has been solved in but few instances. The reader is referred to Lamb, Hydrodynamics, p. 426. 34. A canal dosed at one end and liaving a critical lengtli.

in the latter body. For canals a small fraction of A. in length, and for those whose length is i A, or very nearly ~· A., or some multiple of i A., the horizontal motion at the mouth is comparatively small, and so no restrictions as to the relative size of the two bodies are necessary. 011 the other hand, the restriction becomes very important if the length of the canal is about t A, t A, etc. To see this more clearly, imagine a rectangular sheet of water ~ A. in length and of indefinite width. It will oscillate freely in a certain period r. ~ow add ~ little to its length. It will still oscillate as before, except that its period will be lengthened somewhat. If we double or treble the original length (i. e., add i A., A., etc., to it), the original area will oscillate as before any such addition was made. If to the original length, ! A., we add l A., the oscillation in or about in the original period will be completely destroyed. If the added area or canal } A in length were sufficiently small ( i. e., shallow or narrow), the oscillation in the original area would not be destroyed, but it would be disturbed at and near the mouth of the canal. When L t 'A, or IL 90°, :x generally hecomes large, especially at the mouth, where x = o. z then generally becomes large, excepting near the mouth. At the mouth the magnitude and sign of the amplitude are indeterminate. For any length not too near a critical length, the profile of the stationary wave at any instant is a sine or cosine curve. Now, assume that as the critical length is approached, the nature of the profile is not seriously altered. Since the rise and fall realized in natural or artificial bodies is quite limited, even at the head of the canal, it follows that at the mouth the rise and fall must be almost zero. This being so, the horizontal, and not the vertical, displacement determines the phase of the oscillation of the canal relative to that of the oscillation outside. Suppose a tidal wave to be moving shoreward as if over a shoal at a rate due to depth. Its equations will be

Suppose that there is a rather shallow bay t A in length terminating i · water (generally shallow) where there is a propagation of the free wave. Let this mouth of the bay be taken as the origin of coordinates and the positive direction of x be toward the land. The requirements are, besides the dynamical equation and equatio~1 of continuity: First, where x = o, :x = kA cosh lz sin (at+ a) because we assume that the horizontal motion at the mouth is alike in both bodies of water, excepting that the oscillation is reinforced so that the displacement is k times as great in the small body. The amount of rise and fall at the mouth does not enter into these conditions. Second, where x = L,
x=o;

for at the head of the bay no horizontal motion can take place. If we write A cosh lz . x=k sh1 iL sm [l(L-x)] cos (at+ a - 90 °),

all of these conditions are fulfilled. From these we see that the phase of the rise and fall within the bay is 90°, or t r, behind the phase of the rise and fall just outside of the mouth. At the mouth

As pointed out in § 27, Part I, high water corresponds to a condensation in a sound wave, and low water to a rarefaction. If now a jar or resonator t A deep be held with its open end toward a source of sound, but not very near to it, the phase of the condensation within the jar will be t r behind the phase of the condensation around the mouth of the jar. The horizontal displacements of the particles at the mouth may be many times that in the progressive wave at the same distance from the source of sound. This will depend upon the degree of perfection of the jar for the purpose in hand. 35. A uniform canal connecting: two bodies ef water. In order to treat this question as one of wave motion, we shall assume that the maximum horizontal displacement of any one of the particles is small in comparison with the length of the canal. In other words, we are to assume that in any expression it is immaterial whether we suppose the coordinates of a point to pertain to' its mean or to its tr-ue position. In order to ascertain whether or not this is the case, we find expressions for the x-displacements satisfying the vertical displacements at the ends, as well as the equations of continuity and equal pressure. The value of any horizontal displacement as thus computed can then be compared with the length of the canal. Probably this ratio should not exceed t, or i at most. If the vertical displacements at the two ends be z 1 =A 1 sinh lz cos (at+a,), 11 =A 11 sinh lz cos (at+a 11 ), (550) then ,4, cosh lz A 11 cosh lz · x = ----Sin lL cos l (L- x) cos (at+ a1)+ fillliL ___ cos lx cos (at+ a 11 ) (251)

If the tide of the canal end of the inner body owes its existence to the wave propagated through from the outer, then if the canal is not too long, the initial phase a, is greater than the initial phase a,,. In other words, a,- a 11 is a rather small positive angle. A small angle a,- a 11 cau~es the velocity of propagation to be positive. The above expression for z gives for the amplitude of the tide

The above results are given in Airy's Tides and Wavc;:s, Arts. 311-314. For some applications to nature see §§ 102, 103, 1 13 beyond. To most straits this theory is but partially applicable if, indeed, at all. The reason for this is the fact that for some distance out from one or both ends of the strait, the shoaling causes a considerable horizontal motion to the wave propagated from deep water. This may interfere with the motion in the strait defined by the vertical movements at the two ends. In order to have this theory apply well, the two external bodies should be deep up to the ends of the strait. The particles oscillating to and fro near either end of the strait can then have their theoretical motion, because this is the only motion then involved, aud so the external waters offer no opposition.

The broken lines represent 100-foot contours; the constant time interval is one-tenth of an hour. Fig. 14 represents the progress of a wave up a broad depression or valley 40 miles wide at the bottom and 240 at the top, the depth at the center being r ooo feet. Had the valley been only a few miles in width, the rate of propagation at any point would have been ../gh' where h' is the average depth at the cross section, it being assumed that the area of the cross section, wherever taken, is constant, and that its form changes but slowly from point to point. For, the vertical and transverse accelerations being negligible, the dynamical equation [(23), Part I, or (92), Part IV]

still remains true, and the equation of continuity

is readily derived upon considering a displacement of a small volume and such that all particles oi1ce in 14 the same cross section always reFig. · main in it [ c f. ( 21), Part I].

when x = L. Thus it is seen that a long wave requires i.5 times as much time for traveling to the shore over a bottom uniformly sloping to no depth as it would for traveling over the same distance with a depth constantly equal to that where the shoaling or time of reckoning began. Compare 1·5 with 1 ·306 of the next section. Of course the results of this section and the .preceding one do not accurately apply to the tide wave, but rather to such a disturbance as an earthquake ·sea wave. We must not suppose that Figs. 13 and 14 represent cotidal lines which would in all respects harmonize with the theory of wave motion. For in this section, and in the construction of Figs. 13 and 14, no attention was paid to the possibility of such motion. 38. Long waves or oscillations in canals of variable widths and depths.

CHAPTER V.
EXPERIMENTS WITH MODERATELY LONG WAVES.

39. In order to- obtain a fair representation of a tide wave or seiche, it is necessary to have the horizontal dimensions of the body of water experimented with large in comparison with its depth. But on account of the limited size of the artificial body, we are obliged to make use of a depth considerably out of the true proportion. For bodies of uniform depth and vertical side walls, this difficulty is easily overcome in the manner outlined in § 33. Table 52, which gives the periodic times ( -r) for various values of undisturbed depth (k) and half-wave length (!A.), is of al\nost constant service in work of this kind. It is important to measure the depths as carefully as possible. This can be accomplished fairly well by means of a slender scale showing inches and tenths of inches, read by aid of a small mirror held partly immersed close by. But generally more accurate results are obtained by comparing the period of oscillation of any given body of water with a rectangular body of precisely the same depth and of nearly the same period. This can be accomplished by having movable partitions, all of which remain in the tank of water during the experiment, so that the depth does not vary. The timing can be done with the second hand of a wat.ch. An interval of observation should generally be two, three, or four minutes. The vertical amplitude of the oscillation should be kept as small as possible and still subserve the purpose in hand-it should not exceed, say, one-eighth part of the depth. Sarne experiments upon stationary waves have been made by Frederick Guthrie; the results are published in the Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 50 ( 187 5), pp. 290-302, 377-388. In these the depths are generally great, and the results agree reasonably well with those obtained theoretically. · Some references to other wave experiments may be found in Part I o~ this manual. In this chapter we shall be chiefly concerned with oscillations or stationary waves in limited masses of 'water, and which may be set up and sustained by an external periodic force acting along one direction. A tank of water placed upon a bench or table which admits a limited amount of spring or sway will, when crowded back .and forth in suitable periods, soon be found to oscillate according to some of its simpler modes. In . triangular and most other shaped bodies the direction of the motion of the water particles at any given instant varies from point to point. Consequently, if the unidirectional force w}lich sets up or sustains the oscillation acts favorably in one part of the body or area, it may act unfavorably in others. It is for this reason that a rectangular area iA. long gives, when acted upon by the external force, an oscillation whose amplitude is much· greater than that for an area, say, iA. long. In fact, no· oscillation could be set up by this force in an area of uniform depth A. long, for the force would then destroy as much motion as it would create. If the vibration of a pendulum is sustained by an impulse imparted at the· time when the velcoity of the bob is a maximum in the direction in which the force acts, the periodic time will not be altered. An oscillation in a tank is best sustained by causing
6o5

606

the slight motion of the vessel due to the periodi_c external force to be a maximum at the instant when the velocity of the water particles is a maximum in the same direction. Generally speaking, it is difficult to produce such permanent oscillations as theory would require in most bodies of water, because the direction of the line of motion at any given point does not generally agree with the direction of the external periodic force. In other words, we can not very well arrange a series of forces acting along the various lines of motion. Again, suppose that we have determined from theory, as in Chapter III, the form of the surface of the water at the time of elongation of the particles. Suppose that we construct out of some rigid material· a surface which when lowered upon the water would cause its surface to take the theoretical elevations and depressions. If now this rigid surface could be suddenly annihilated or removed without disturbance of any kind, a perfect or theoretical oscillation would be the result. 'I'herc seems to be no way '?f accomplishing this. 40. Suppose we have about 2 Fig. 15. inches of water in a rectangular tank or trough r 2 _inches wide and several feet long. Suppose this to be placed upon a stand or table. Now by periodically crowding back and forth the table upon which the vessel rests, we can, after a little, establish a fairly good oscillation across the tank; the half-wave length ( li\.) will be 12 inches. If this generating and sustaining force be discontinued, the oscillation will go on for one or two minutes, but the amplitude will gradually become smaller. Hence the free oscillation can be timed with considerable prec1s10n. In most experiments it is best to continue to sustain the oscillation by imparting a very small periodic force to the moving particles, as already explained. An experiment extending over two or three minutes will generally gi\'e the period to about the nearest fiftieth of a second, as· a comparison with results obtained from Tabl~ 52 will show. 4i. Next, suppose that we place an obstruction 4 or 5 inches long in the center of the trough (Fig. 15) and begin to generate the oscillation or stationary wave as before. For a little while the attempt will succeed fairly well at the ends of the trough; but before long, on account of the obstacle, the character of the motion will be altered almost beyond recognition. At first sight this would tend to discourage one from attempting to explain the tides in any natural body of water by the theory of nearly free oscillations generated and sustained by the periodic actions of the moon and sun; for, islands occur in almost any large body of water, and the shore line is often very uneven. The saving feature of the case lies in the fact that but few successive actions go to produce the tide; perhaps none are felt after the lapse of three days. Consequently the obstacles have not time to alter the character of the oscillations to the extent indicated in the experiment. In other words, the lines of motion which theory would give to the rather complicated body of water are set aside, and there is at first established over the body an imperfect oscillation, which would be a mode of oscillation were the body simplified to its general and not its actual form. 42. Suppose that we next try to obtain an oscillation extending lengthwise of the trough, the depth of water being about 2 inches. Great difficulty will be experienced in setting up so long an oscillation, which shall approach the simple and stationary

APPENDIX NO. 7.

OUTLINES OF TIDAL THEORY.

character required. If one end be raised or lowered, a progressive wave will be seen traveling back and forth for a short time after the disturbance subsides. But a good oscillation whose half-wave length is the length of the trough will not be thus obtained. Next, so put in a board as to form one sloping end wall. Now elevate and lower one end of the trough one or more tiini:s, and then leave the body to itself. The water will oscillate in the free period of the body, and, strange to say, the motion will continue to be sensible and well defined for two minutes or more after all indications of the progressive part have died out. For a bottom 45 ·7 inches long and a free surface 66'7 inches long, and a depth of 2 · 3 inches, three sets of observations, continued about two minutes each, gave 4 ·77 !'leconds as the length of the period of free oscillation. That is, the period is the same as that of a trough of uniform depth ( 2 · 3 inches) 71 ·o inches long, instead of 66'7 inches. · 43. Suppose that we partition off an L-shaped strip about 3 inches wide running along one end and one side of the trough. An external periodic force acting across the trough will incite motion to the end section of the L; this motion will soon cause the whole L-area to oscillate, provided the length of the longer branch be taken as some multiple of the shorter. Experiment will, however, show that distances defining wave lengths or half-wave lengths should be measured along the center line of the L-shap<:d strip partitioned off. In other words. the virtual lengths of thi: right trapezoidal strips involved are very nearly their mean geometrical lengths. The more half-wave lengths added to the longer branch, the smaller will be the amplitude of the oscillation, because the transverse branch or area is the only one upon which the external forces can act. 44. Suppose in the next place that we build a partition nearly but not quite across the trough. Let a narrow and shallow canal extend from where the partition ends along the side of the trough and terminate abruptly. This can be easily arranged by suitable part1t1oning. An oscillation set up across the main portion of the trough will cause the water in the small canal to oscillate in the same period. Nodes will occur at odd multiples of l- A. from the head of the canal. If there are two nodes, high water is simultaneous at both ends of the canal; if there is one node, it is low water at the head when it is high water outside; if the canal is less than t A in length, high water inside is simultaneous with high water outside. Should a node fall close to the mouth of the canal, the character of the motion in the main body of the trough will be considerably altt:red, and no very satisfactory results will be obtained; or rather, the motion in the canal depends on other considerations. (See § 34.) 45. By means of a movable partition it is easy to obtain a rectangular sheet of water whose depth shall be zero at one side and several inches at the other. Such a sheet 5 ·5 inches across and 3 · 3 inches deep on the deep side was found from a 3-minute observation to have a free period of

(~~~

=) 0·58 second.

A fairly good node was

observed at about 3'2 inches from the deep side. The period for a rectangular sheet 5·5 inches across and uniformly 3'3 inches deep is, by 'fable 52, 0·433 second. The ratio of these two periods is therefore 0·7 5. The period for the rectangular sheet 1 '65 inches deep is, by Table 52, 0·492 socond. Thus we see that the free period of a body of water of variable depth may be greater than the period of a body of like horizontal dimensions with a uniform depth equal. to the average depth of the first body. (Cf.§§ 38, 33, end, and 55.)

46. For the experimenti; about to be described, it is assumed that we have mounted upon a table a rectangular tank whose horizontal dimensions are about 4 by 6 feet. In connection with this, we are assumed to have some r 5 or 20 bricks, some boards, and · other materials for partitioning it off as may be desired. In the first place, suppose all partitions removed and the tank to contain 2 inches of water. Let this be gently crowded in such periods of time as will set up oscillations. The mass of water will be an odd multiple of half-wave lengths across, because the externa1 force would have no resultant effect upon a L. sheet whose width is an even multiple. The ridges and furrows will extend L. l lengthwise "the tank. The width of the tank being 48 ·4 inches, observations (covering 3 or 4 minutes in each case) gave as the periodic time when three halfH wave lengths were formed, r · 19 seconds; 16 Fig. · when five were formed, 0·76 second; and when seven, 0·57. Table 52 gives r ·19, 0·74, 0·56. An even number of half-wave lengths, say 2, can be obtained by making the area of one of the half-wave lengths much shallower than that of the other. Of course its length will be decreased in accordance with Table 52. When force is imparted to the water, the oscillation will be governed by the deeper and longer half-wave length. 47. When a few irregularities are introduced in the shore line or bottom of a broad and mop.erately shallow tank of water, it is surprising to see how almost any impulses of reasonable period imparted to the body of water by crowding or slightly swaying the tank or its supports, will set up wave motion which will be maintained for a short time. The amplitude of such oscillations, excepting in angles or bays, will not generally be as great as the amplitude of the stationary waves just described; nor will the oscillations long continue. They are often badly mixed up with progressive waves, so that the particular barriers which gave rise to them may not be easily discerned. Along th.e edges or shores the oscillation bas its greatest amplitude and regularity. This state of affairs is probably not unlike that of

the Pacific Ocean, where there is a broad expanse of water upon which the tidal forces acting in almost any direction may produce agitation, and where the motions are not as much constrained or defined hy the shore lines as in smaller bodies, nor are they as easily explained. 48. Right-triangular areas are easily formed by placing a straight partition acros5 one comer of the tank. Oscillations of certain modes can be produced by a periodic force acting in one direction. .Those of other modes \\;ill be produced with difficulty if at all by this means. Figs. r 6, r 7 illustrate this in the case of 45 ° triangles acted upon by a force parallel to one side. Suppose for the moment that a rigid wall formed the hypotenuse of the small right triangle occupying the right angle of Fig. r6. A glance at the lines of motion drawn in Fig. 9 ~ill show that a 1.arge part of ·the force acts with the motion and a very small part against it. Now suppose this wall removed and the oscillation shown in Fig. r6 to be produced. The whole area divides itself into 9 triangles (oscillating areas). The force acts with the motion in the case of 6 of these triangles and against the motion in case of the remaining 3. The excess of 6 over 3, or 3, represents the number of triangles to which the force which produces the oscillation in the 9 triangles is really applied. In other words, the force acts only l as advantageously as in the case of the single small triangle just referred to. A 45° triangle formed by partitioning off a corner of the tank, each leg being 42·4 inches, was made to oscillate as in Fig. r 6. With a depth of 2 ·07 inches, the number of oscillations from a 3-minute observation interval was found to be 79 per minute and so r = 0·76 second. Theory gives r = 0·755 second. For, the virtual length of each triangle is the distance of the right angle from the hypotenuse, or ro inches. See Table 52. Another mode of oscillation is that where the nodal lines run parallel or perpendicular to the hypotenuse. The virtual length of each triangular area is the length of one of the sides. A force parallel to one side will incite an oscillation throughout the area, but it will not act upon the water particles in the same manner as in the preceding case where the nodal lines were parallel to the sides. But in this case the nodal lines might be made parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the force by turning the tank so that its sides make angles of 45° with the edges of the table. The oscillation of a 30° triangle, shown in Figs. ro, 1 r, is readily produced by having the shorter side parallel to the direction of the external force. 49. An isosceles triangle whose base was 4 inches and altitude 8 inches, the latter lying in the direction of the impressed force, was found to make r 13 oscillations per minute and to be isochronous with a rectangular area of altitude 6·77 inches, the depth of the water being 2·:.15 inches. This comparison with a rectangle makes the virtual length of the triangle about 0·85 timef the altitude. From the preceding chapter it appears that the virtual length of an equilateral triangle is 0'866 times the altitude, and from the symmetrical mode of the circle it follows that the virtual length of a very slender . triangle is 0·82 times the altitude. Thus it would appear that for a perfect oscillation iu a triangle of the above dimensions the virtual length should be somewhat greater than 0·82·times the altitude. A nodal line was noticed running nearly parallel to the base and roughly about 3t inches' above it, which iso·4 of the altitude. In a slender triangle theory places the node o· 372 of the altitude above the base. 50. To ascertain the free periods of a circular area, it is convenient to make use S. Doc. 68--39

of a brass hoop 3 or 4 inches broad and I or 2 feet in diameter. This is to be laid upon the bottom of the broad, shallow tank. Should it not be circular it can be made so by placing bricks or other weights around the outside. With a depth of 2 or 3 inches no difficulty will be experienced in setting up the first two unsymmetrical modes of oscillation by the usual unidirectional force, and they will be fairly in accordance with theory, as to period, lines of motion, relative amplitudes, etc. Elliptical areas of various shapes can be formed out of the hoop, provided elliptical outlines, each having the same perimeter as the circle, be traced upon the bottom. By means of weights or tacks the hoop, distorted into an ellipse, can be held in place. For a circle having a diameter of 13·48 inches the period of oscillation, according to its slowest mode, the depth being 2·22 inches, was found from a 4-minute observation to be (

fi

=) 0·85 second.

The theoretical value is T=o·831 second ..

For a circle having a diameter of 26.2 inches, the period of oscillation, according to its slowest mode, the depth being 2·24 inches, was found from a 4-minute o~servation 240 to be ( =) 1·5~ seconds. The theoretical value is T=1·545. With the same .15 I hoop and depth, a 4-minute observation gave for the period of oscillation according to 240 the ~ext unsymmetrical mode, T=( =) 0·60 second. The theoretical value is . 402 0·589 second. Oscillation ac<;ording to the odd symmetrical modes can be obtained in a sector whose angle is, say, 30°. The central radius of the sector should, of course, coincide with the direction of the force. 51. Let us next consider an L~shaped flrea 3 inches broad and 2 X 14 inches in length along the outer side, and so 2 X 12t inches along the central line or axis. Let one arm lie parallel to the external force and the other lie perpendicular to it. The period of oscillation, the depth being a trifle more than 2 inches, was found from a 3-minute observation, to be (

leaving a rectangle 3 inches broad and 14 long, the period of oscillation was found to be (

Let us next consider a deep canal closed at one end and communicating with an.oscillating area. Let an opening be made in the middle one of the lateral partitions for the mouth of the canal wliich extends perpendicularly to the lines of motion of the main area. The depth of the canal is supposed to be the same as the depth outside. Suppose that we so time the periodic force that three half-wave lengths extend across . the tank. The mouth of the canal will then fall at a loop of the oscillation. If the length of the canal be some multiple oft i\., the oscillation in the main area will not be disturbed (save slightly reduced in amplitude) although an oscillation of equal amplitude in the canal or dependent area will be sustained. If the length of the canal be about t A. or a little less, great disturbance will be noted in the main area. The oscillation

in the canal will be poor and the amplitude at the mouth small. If the length of the canal lie between ·t A. and t A., and its width be a considerable fraction of t A., the oscillation in the canal will be fairly good; for we can imagine it to extend sufficiently far into the main area for approaching the length t A.. There will be a node t A. from the head of the canal, and the amplitude will there be greater than at the mouth if the length of the walls of the canal are less than t A.. 53. Near the nodes of oscillating areas the lateral boundaries (i. e., boundaries following lines of motion) may be cut out for some distance, and the oscillation will go on nearly the same as it would were all boundaries complete. That is, the period, amplitude, and character of the motion will be very nearly alike in the two cases. An

experiment upon two rectangular areas of like dimensions and placed side by side in the tank will convince one of t?e truth of this statement. The reason why'the motion is unaltered by the opening is that the level on the inside of it is practically the same as that on the outside, and all lines of motion follow and do not cross the line of the partition and opening. If the lateral boundaries are entirely removed, so that only the two ends of the rectangular area remain, the period will be a trifle but not much shorter than that for the closed rectangle. The amplitude will be considerable near the centers of the end walls, but small near their extremities; the motion will be noticeable at a considerable distance beyond the positions formerly occupied by the lateral walls. Experiments upon a square area indicate that the period is diminished somewhat when both lateral

walls are removed and by a less amount when one is removed. But the results were discordant, indicating a dependence upon boundaries exterior to. the region considered. Experiments show that unless the end walls be at least about t A. in length no considerable oscillation will be set up between them. When there is one lateral wall, the end walls need be only one-half as long as when both sides are open. Suppose, now, that we have simply two parallel end boundaries, and suppose one of them to be several times longer than the other. An experiment upon an inclosed area 8"5 inches square, the depth of water be,ng 2·3 inches, gave as its period 0·62 second. Theory makes it 0·633 second. Upon removing the lateral walls of this square the period was found to be o· 58 second. This result 1i1ay be unreliable and dependent upon boundaries exterior to the region. On the long end the rise and fall was seen to extend about t A. beyond the limits defined by the opposing short end. If in a broad tank a skeleton hexagon, like that shown in Fig. 18, be constructed, it will be possible, by crowding the tank back and forth as usual, to set up an oscillation whose loops will be supported by the rigid walls. This is so because more of the force impressed upon the water goes to sustaining the oscillation than to destroying it. With a depth of 2 · 38 inches the period of the hexagoll' shown was found, from observations extending over four minutes, to be 0·706 second. The virtual length of each area is therefore, by Table 52, 9·83 inches; which is very nearly equal to the length ( 10 inches) ?f the dotted line shown in the figure. 54. It has already been noted that the virtual length of areas tapering toward the ends is less than the extreme geometrical length. E. g., the virtual length of a slender triangular half-wave area is, by § 28, 0·820 times the extreme length; for a whole-wave area it is 0·896 times the extreme length. The virtual length of half-wave areas tapering at both ends may be much less than the extreme length. (See§ 26.) On the other hand, it is easily shown that the virtual length of a half-wave area broadening at both ends may be greater than .its extreme geometrical length. For instance, it was found from experiment th~t a rectangular l 7"3 inches long and 6 inches wide, the wate_- bemg about l ·9 inches deep, has for its period l ·32 seconds. With the same length, and with the same depth of water, an area 6 inches wide at either end and 2 ·2 in the middle gave for its period l "64 seconds. More difficulty will be experienced in the production of oscillations in an area much contracted at the center than in one whose shape is rectangular or oval. 55. Let us next consider a case of variable depth. Suppose we have a rectangular area 8 ·98 inches across. · Let the depth at each end be 2 ·63 inches; let it gradually slope up in going toward the central line where the depth is but 0·75 inch. A 3-minute observation gave as the period of

oscillation(~!~=) 0·87

second.

respectively. For a rectangle of uniform depth equal to the mean depth in each of the above three cases, we have as periods, according to Table 52, 0·742, 0·829, 0·896 second, respectively. Thus we can infer that a half-wave area has its period much increased by a ridge across the center. Observation shows that the velocity of the water particles situated over the ridge is comparatively great; also that the amplitude of the rise and

fall, even at the ends, is much less than would have been produced by forces of the same intensity acting upon the body cleared of this obstruction. 56. Progressive derived waves can be produced in the following manner: Box off in the tank a convenient half-wave area, but let one of the end walls, or a portion of one, extend not quite to the surface. Beyond this wall or opening and outside of the area let the water continue to be as shallow as on the crest of the submerged wall. A stationary wave in the area will give rise to a progressive derived wave. In the shallow region we can put weights of square, circular, or any other cross section and observe the behavior of the progressive wave as it is interrupted by them, just as if they were islands in the midst of a shallow sea. 5 7. Suppose that we have an area entirely surrounded by a rigid wall except a small opening at one of the loops of the oscillation. The water in this opening will behave as if in a strait communicating with a tideless sea. At the time of high water at the loop, the particles in the strait will be at their maximum elongation toward the oscillating area. But this will not be the case unless the narrow strait be of some considerable length in comparison with the lengths of the orbits of the particles lying in the strait. If the small strait be of practically no length, as if gap cut through a thin partition, then Torricelli's theorem applies. In order that this hydrostatic effect may be too small to be of consequence, it is probable that the length of the strait should be at least 4 times the amplitude of the horizontal oscillation in its strait. 58. There are other ways of obtaining oscillations of bodies of water. Imperfect results can be obtained by periodically agitating the water to near the bottom with a large paddle. The proper period of a body and in a given direction can thus be approximated to. Pools in brooklets form natural bodies of suitable size. Artificial reservoirs of various shapes and sizes are readily excavated along the banks of streams whence they can be supplied with water. Canals with and without end barriers can be dug at pleasure. If shallow in comparison with the pool, their motion may be regarded as dependent or derived. 59. Suppose that we construct a reservoir which represents accurately a nearly inclosed gulf or bay together with all its tidal tributaries. It is not necessary that the vertical scale be the same as the horizontal; the only requirement is that the depth shall always be a small fraction of a wave length when the period is fixed in the manner stated below. Now by any suitable artificial means, as by periodically immersing a float in a pool suitably constructed outside the miniature bay, aim to reproduce the observed tidal phenomena just outside of the real bay. The period should be found by trial-observation having shown just what fraction of a period the time of tide at one point of the bay precedes or follows that at some other. With such an arrangement carefully constructed the tide and tidal !;treams throughout the bay and its tributaries would become known, and so a ,mechanical solution of the problem obtained. We see that it must be tme here, because the portion of the tide period required for any solitary disturbance to pass between any two assumed points of the bay is the same in the model as in the original.

CHAPTER VI.
SMALL OSCILLATIONS SUSTAINED BY PERIODIC FORCES.

60. Time of elongaHon of a compound pendztlmn . If to a compound pendulum whose resistance is proportional to its velocity, a series of simple harmonic forces having periods equal to the free period of 'the pendulum be applied, and a permanent state established, then must the time of elongation be simultaneous with the time when the moment of the external periodic forces with respect to the axis of suspension becomes zero. This is also the time when the virtual work of the external periodic forces upon the system becomes zero. Denoting the elementary masses of the pendulum by m ,, m and their distances from the axis of suspension by i\. 1 , i\.2 , , we have as the effective horizontal force of the body (sometimes spoken 6f as minus the force of inertia) the expression
2 ,

The moment of this force rela tive to the axis of suspension is

which may be written

where X denotes the distance of the center of gravity from the axis of suspension, and A the distance of the center of resistance. D' Alembert's principle combined with the principle of virtual work leads, of course, to the same equation. For these principles assert that the aggregate of the forces, impressed and reversed effective, acting upon a material system, and each multiplied by the displacement of its point of application in the directions x, y, z, when an arbitrary motion takes place in accordance with the connections of the systen1, must be zero. That is,

(281)

In the present instance oy = oz = o and ox = A.oO, and so 08 comes out as a factor. At the axis of suspension A., and so A.08, becomes zero. Hence we are not ·obliged to take further account of the reactions of the supports than to note that they are finite.* Let _A' denote the amplitude of the oscillation at a point distant A.' from the axis of sfispension; let the time be reckoned from the instant when the particle is at elongation toward - x.

This equation may be written in the form Pcos at+ Q sin at= o.

(286)

Since this must be a t'lle equation for all values of t, the coefficient of cos at and that of sin at must each be zero. If we make P = o and Q = o, the a's are completely determined (for any assigned value of a), because each a differs from a given a, say a,, by a known and £xed amount.

Here we are not concerned about the determination of the a's in general, but only those corresponding to a certain value of a. Suppose the a's such that ( 285) or ( 286) shall be satisfied at the times of elongation, viz., when at= o or 180°. The only restriction necessary for bringing this about is that P = C?· P will be equal to zero if

If all Fs are zero, the latter condition alone is sufficient for making the corresponding P equal to zero. Hence we know that this must be the relation between the speed and lengths of the free compound pendulum. This gives for the complete period of the vibration

(291)

where r replaces 27t'a and A. is the length of the simple equivalent pendulum. But (290) must be also true for the sustained oscillation because, by hypothesis, the motion is alike whether free or sustained. The displacement of the point of application of F. is A.. dO; the value of the force in the same direction is at the time of elongation proportional to F. cos a.. Hence the above equation (289) expresses the fact that the virtual work of the external periodic forces is zero at the time of elongation, or that the moment of three forces with respect to the axis of suspension is then zero. Q. E. D. If v = r, that is, if there be but one external periodic force, and if a satisfies ( 290), P = o and Q =ogive a,= 270°. That is, the phase of the oscillation (at+ 180°) is 90° behind the phase of the force (at+ a,). When t = o, and the pendulum bob is at its elongation to the left, the force must be zero if it sustain the vibration without alteration.

where 0' denotes the magnitude of the angular direction of the pendulum at elongation. From (300) and (278) we see that F 1 cos (a't ai) is simply the force or restitution with its sign changed. In other words, the pendulum is, because of the long period of the force, always in a state of statical equilibrium with this force and the force of gravity. 62.

A narrow canal may be either curved or straight; x/is distance measured along the canal. In applying D' Alembert's principle in conjunction with the principle of virtual work for the purpose of obtaining an equation between all forces, both impressed and effective, it is to be remarked that any set of infinitesimal displacements throughout the system corresponding to an infinitesimal change dt in tare (because the oscillation is harmonic) severally proportional to, though inuch smaller than, &,, and these finite displacements may be substituted for the very small ones because all terms in· the equation will be affected by the same factor.

The force itself is, at a time of elongation, proportional to fvm, cos a,.

But these latter are true relations betwt:en period and wave length for the various half wave lengths considered. The 01.'her relation expresses that the virtual work of the external periodic forces upon the system is then zero.
64. Areas ef uniform deptlz. If to the particles of water in a given oscillating system, each area of uniform

depth, and wherein the resistances are proportional to the velocities of the particles, a series of simple harmonic forces having for period the free period of the body of water be applied and a permanent state established, then must the time of elongation be simultaneous with the time when the virtual work of the external periodic forces upon the system becomes zero. Let us suppose that we have drawn upon any given oscillating area of uniform depth a set of normal coordinates consisting of lines of motion and contour lines. Since we may erect vertical partitions ad libitum along the lines of motion, we may consider separately the strips formed by two such neighboring lines, distinguishing one strip from another by an additional subscript µ. Let P. denote the amplitude of the horizontal displacement at the part of the strip characterized by the subscript r; because the motion is harmonic in time the virtual displacement dr will be proportional to p, and the component virtual displacements will be proportional to ~. 17. From equations ( 281), ( 97) we have an equation resembling ( 302) with terms in 17 and in ~ and 17 added. For the moment let = - <p ( x, J') cos at, 17 = - ¢ (x, y) cos at and so

e

(313) In the first place suppose the oscillation to be free; then P= o gives an equation from which all subscripts arid summation signs can be omitted, and the resulting equation will be true. In fact, the chief use of the subscripts is to allow an arbitrary distribution of the disturbing forces over the areas. Making use of ( 91), ( 97), and ( 313), we obtain from P = o a differential eqation in f; and x, y; and this is known to be true for harmonic oscillations because it can be readily derived from ( 94) if in the latter I; is assumed to be harmonic. Now on the assumtion of sustaining forces, the corresponding P= o gives, by virtue of the differential relation just mentioned,

But this is proportional to the virtual work of the external periodic forces upon the oscillating area when at= o or 180°. Hence the theorem.

To apply the general rule given at the beginning of the last section to an oscillating system in nature, we imagine the force diagrams (Fig. 1) to be scattered along the lines of motion of the areas of the system, e.g., along the axis of a canal-like borl::,' of water. Let us begin with any Greenwich component hour. The local component hour corresponding to the numbering on the force diagram is found by subtracting the longitude in time from the assumed Greenwich hour if the longitude be west and adding the longitude if it be east. Project the force arrow belonging to the assumed time in each diagram upon the line of motion passing through it. The aggregate oi the elementary masses, each multiplied by the intensity of _the tidal force in the direction of the displacement of the element, and again by a quantity proportional to the value of the maximum displacement (since the oscillation is harmonic), must be zero at the time of high or low water. The algebraic sum of these products for any given hour should be plotted as an ordinate at that hour. Where the curve thus constructed crosses the time axis denotes the time of high or low water. ' In some simple cases the results can be seen at once. We thus have the following: 66. Semidiurnal oscillations. In an east-and-west canal half a wave length long, it is high water at the east end at the component hour o or 12, the time meridian being understood to be the meridian of the middle point of the canal. This rule also applies to any curved canal half a wave' length long lying symmetrically with respect to the central meridian. In an east-and-west canal one wav,r length long, it is high water at both ends at the component hour-3 or 9, the time mendian being understood to be the meridian of the middle point of the canal. This rule also applies to any curved canal a wave length long lying symmetrically with respect to the central meridian. In the meridional canal half a wave length long it is high water at the south or north end, according as the 1;>Teater part of the canal lies north or south of the equator, at the component hour 3. In a meridional canal one wave length long, whose center lies between 45° south and 45 ° north latitude, it is high water at both ends at the component hour 9 ; if the center lies beyond these limits, the component hour of high water at the ends is 3.

In an east-and-west canal half a wave length long situated in north latitude, it is high water at the east end at the component hour o or 24, the time meridian for diurnal, as well as semidiurnal. oscillations being understood to be the meridian of the middle point of the canal. For a similar canal situated in south latitude it is high water at the east end at the component hour 12. These rules also apply to any curved canal half a wave length long lying symmetrically with respect to the central meridian. In a meridional canal half a wave length long, whose center lies between 45° south and 45° north latitude, it is high water at the north end at the component hour 6; if the center lies outside of these limits, the component hour for high water at the north end is 18. In a meridional canal a wave length long whose center lies north of the equator, it is high water at the ends at the component hour rs; if the center lies south of the equatqr, the component hour for high water at the ends is 6. 68.

CHAPTER VII.
A PARTIAL EXPLANATION OF THE TIDES.

69. In approaching the question of the actual causes of the tides, upon which so much labor has been expended and concerning which so much has been written, one may well surmise that the subject does not admit of accurate or complete treatment. It is therefore natural to consider, in the first place, only those sources which would seem to account for the dominant tides in any given region under consideration, and to postpone, perhaps indefinitely, the consideration of those sources whose importance in the ,production of tides must be relatively small. Considering the actual distribution of land and water, a few computations upon hypothetical cases will suffice to convince one that as a rule the bcean tides, as we know them, are so great that they can ·be produced only by successive actions of the tidal forces upon osci11ating systems, each having, as free period, appoximately the period of the forces, and each perfect enough to preserve the general character of its motion during several such periods were the forces to cease their action. This greatly simplifies matters; for, having once for all constructed a set of force diagrams for the various latitudes, we have only to discover those regions which have a free period of oscillation about equal to the period of the forces, and to then ascertain at what time the particles should be at elongation in their nearly rectilinear paths. The paths of the particles being practically fixed and determined by the boundary conditions, it becomes possible to disregard the forces arising from the earth's rotation, and which vary with the component velocities of the moving particles. Since some of the natural boundaries of any oceanic region may be indefinite, imperfect, or altogether wanting, serious difficulties arise when we attempt to actually mark out areas or systems of areas which shall have the required period of free oscillation, and in which it is possible for the tidal forces to incite a considerable tide. This is believed to be the first attempt to approximate1y locate areas which seem to account for the principal ocean tides, having regard to the difficulties just referred to, and to connect the possible motions of the water with the tidal forces. The writings of Plato, Galileo, Newton, Bernoulli, Euler, Young, and Fitz Roy show that these philosophers regarded nearly free oscillations of large bodies of water, oscillations analogous to vibrations of pendulums, as important factors in causing or modifying the tides. Their ideas regarding the requirements of such motions were somewhat confused. Airy is the first writer who treats, with success, stationary waves under several conditions. Ferrel's treatment of tides in east-and-west canals, closed at both ends, is of special importance. He suggests that the large semidiurnal tides of the North Atlantic are due mainly to an east-and-west oscillation of its northern portion. In Chapters VIII and XI of his Hydrodynamics, Lamb gives an excellent

treatment of forced and free oscillations. Chapters III-V of Rayleigh's Theory of Sound; and Chapter IX, Vol. I, and Chapter VII, Vol. II, of Routh's Dynamics, ha\'e an important bearing upon the subject. 70. Chapter I, Part IV A, this manual, treats of the tidal forces, also of the equilibrium theory, which is applicable to some landlocked bodies of water. The definitions of several terms of frequent occurrence are given in Chapter III. The law connecting the forces with the oscillations of the water is given in Chapter VI. Before attempting to point out possible oscillating areas, one should establish certain lemmas pertaining to the motion in question. A number of these are given here; but it is to be remarked that several which might have been given are really contained in Chapter VIII, "On the classification of rivers, straits, bays, etc.'' ( 1) Generally, with such initial displacements as are likely to occur in nature, a landlocked body of water has one (proper) period of (free) oscillation, and perhaps several such periods. This is evidenced by the phenomenon of the seiches. ( 2) 'When all boundaries are rigid, the oscillating area may be very narrow and contain curves or bends. E. g., Lake Geneva for seiche oscillations. (3) When the two straight ends constitute the only rigid portion of the boundary, the width of the area should be at least about t A. in order to produce a sensible stationary wave. It should be still wider if the length be a multiple oft A. (§ 53). (4) If one side wall of the area be land, then the necessary width is only one-half as great as in the preceding case. (5) The virtual l.ength of a right trapezoidal area is approximately its mean geometrical length (§ 51). ( 6) A tapering or narrowing toward the end of a canal increases the frequency of oscillation; i. e., the actual or extreme length is greater than the virtual length (§§ 26-28, 47-50 ). The reverse is true for a gradual shoaling toward the shore or end of the area, provided we use the undiminished depth in making our estimates (§§ 38, 42, 45). ( 7) A broadening at both ends, or a contracting at the middle, of a half-wave area decreases the frequency of oscillation; i. e., the actual or extreme length is less than the virtual length, t A. (§ 54). The same is true for a shoaling at the middle, even if we use the mean depth in making the comparison ( § 55). (8) The axis of a simple area may be bent at a loop whenever the outer side of the loop is well supported ( § 5 3). ( 9) In a half-wave simple area having no transverse ridge dividing it into two or more physical bodies, i.e., in an area whose depths continuously decrease toward the end boundaries, the motions of the particles are simultaneous ( i. e., not progressive) even up to the shallow ends ( § 38). ( 10) If the depth of water suddenly becomes reduced as a shoal is approached to a small fraction of its general depth, the submerged shore line will act nearly the same as au ordinary shore line in producing the tides; a derived wave will, circumstances permitting, progress onward across the shoal area (§ 56). E. g., the extensive shoaliug near the meridian 180° west. ( 11) If an oscillation is caused by two opposing straight walls of different lengths, the rise and fall upon the longer will not be confined to the region lying opposite the shorter wall, but will extend some distance beyond (§ 53). S. Doc. 68--40

626

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

( 1.2) Suppose a stationary oscillation to exist in a canal communicating with a tided sea; let the length of the canal lie between o and t A, then at the time of high water outside it is high water throughout the canal (e.g., many Alaskan canals). If the length lie bet\veen t A and t A, it is low water for a distance oft A from the head at the time it is high water outside (e.g., Irish Sea, node at Courtown; English Channel, node at Christchurch). If the length be equal or nearly equal to t A., then the horizontal motion at the mouth, instead of the vertical motion, determines the time of tide within. This tide will be three hours, or t r, later than the tide outside: e. g., the Gulf of Maine (§§ 34, 44). ( 13) Consider next a canal whose depth is nearly equal to that of the sea. If the landlocked portion (i.e., the canal proper) happens to be about t A in length and narrow, the rise and fall of the adjacent sea tide will be seriously interfered with by the tendency of the stationary wave to have little rise and fall, but comparatively great current velocities, at the junction of the canal and sea. The o1?vious way out of the difficulty for a broad canal is to imagine the same extended seaward until its length becomes quite different from t A and approaches t A, then the rise and fall at this imaginary mouth does in no wise conflict with that of the sea at the same place; e. g., Bay of Bengal ( § 52). ( 14) Whenever a rise and fall apparently necessitates a discontinuity in height, as at an incomplete boundary, a wave will generally be propagated outward, with velocity due to depth, from the discontinuity; or a dependei1t (stationary) oscillation will be set up in and beyond the openings. ( 15) If we·can see that a reflected wave must travel in a d_irection nearly opposite to that of the direct wave, then there must result a more or less considerable stationary wave dependent upon the degree or amount of the reflection. 28, Part I.) ( 16) A good reflection occurs where the cross section changes much within a small fraction of a wave length. ( 17) If the region adjacent to an oscillating area consists of a bay or gulf, with numerous branching arms of different dimensions, and if it has various depths or has openings into other bodi~s of water, the wave will be almost wholly progressive, at least for a considerable distance up; for, no large regular reflected wave will return resembling the direct wave as it entered. E. g., Chesapeake Bay. ( 18) A circular or a square area may have a progressive wave due to the superposition of two stationary waves whose phases are not equal. The horizontal paths of water particles common to any two non-simultaneous areas are elliptical. (§§ 26, 28, 32.) ( 19) If one portion of an extended shore line of considerable range of tide, i. e., a shore line near the middle of a loop, recede from the portion where the range is greatest, then from this locality a derived wave will proceed along the shore. For, the reflections, caused by such shore line, of a disturbance from any assumed point or center cannot generally take a direction opposite to that of the disturbance, as a stationary wave requires. Similarly for a shore line oblique to the axis of an area, provided that the configuration is such that the range of tide is there considerable. E.g., southern Guinea, Senegambia, western Europe, southeastern Patagonia, for the semidiurnal wave; perhaps western Australia for the diurnal wave. (20) In a strait, not too short, connecting a deep ocean with a sea which has neither tides of its own nor tides induced from without, the tide wave is stationary in its character. (§§ 35, 10;~.)

rn

APPENDIX NO. 7.

OUTLINES OF TIDAL THEORY.

(2 r) In estimating the time of high water of a loop of a stationary wave having a broken boundary, we should consider the tide at points situated some distance within the boundary; that is, not too near the openings. As the openings are approached the time becomes later, supposing the wave to be freely transmitted beyond, either into an infinite sea or into one which does not reflect. The larger the opening the greater this delaying effect. E.g., Cape Horn, Iceland Channel, Baffin Bay, southwestern Africa, and off Senegambia. ( 22) For an island situated in an oscillating area, but not too near a nodal line, it may be high or low water upon the side facing the nodal line earlier than in the sea surrounding the island. Similarly for a cape extending far into the area. E. g., Kalmlui, :-.faui Island, Hawaii; Apia, Samoan Islands; Cape Farewell, Greenland. (Cf. ~ II2.) (23) If the amplitude of one wave be much, or even slightly, greater than that of a second wave of like period, the times of the resultant maxima and minima will be approximately given by those of the first. (§§ 4, 10, Part III, and Tables 15, 16.) (24) Near the nodes or near the free boundaries of an oscillating area, the times of the tides may not be governed by the times of high and low water of the oscillation of the area. · In such cases the tides are not easily explained because they arise from some other source or sources. (25) If there are two not too distant non-simultaneous high-water regions, the cotidal lines will change gradually from one value to the other; i. e., the wave will seem to progress, but not as a free wave at a rate due to depth. (Cf. §§ 26, 28.) E. g., off Liberia and in the axis of the narrowest part of the Atlantic the cotidal hour is VI while at Madeira and the Canary Islands it is I or II; therefore the cotidal lines must be numbered from VI to I or II in this distance. Similarly for the region from Ecuador to Chile, and Chile to Cape Horn; Greenland to the United States; Hawaiian Islands to the Fiji and New Hebrides Islands; also the coast line between Halifax and the Bay of Fundy. Between regions nearly separated by land the change may be rapid. E. g., through Muskeget Channel, Vineyard Sound, and Fire Island Inlet. (Cf.§§ 102-106.) Between two simultaneous regions, not too far apart, the tide is simultaneous. 7 r. In dividing the ocean's surface into oscillating systems and areas, charts of depths (Figs. 19, 20), Table 51 1 and a terrestrial globe at least 6 inches in diameter are of constant service. The directions of lines drawn upon the globe can be ascertained by a small semicircular protractor of, say, o·6 inch radius. Besides outlining areas upon a globe, a more careful drawing should be made npon a Mercator's projection of the world. Great circles on this projection are easily drawn by means of a system of curves drawn upon a transparent sheet and representing great circlt:s crossing the equator in two opposite points; these are cut orthogonally by a system representing small circles or distance lines. Generally speaking, the axis, if the area is simple, should be drawn perpendicularly to the ends. The lateral boundaries, if free, should be drawn from capes and headlands of the end boundaries where the shore line suddenly takes another trend. The values of lunar and solar wave lengths, expressed in degrees of a great circle, as well as in miles, are given in Table 5 r. For simple or canal-like areas, the depth may generally be assumed to be constant over each half-wave length; for areas less simple in form, the depth can generally be assumed to be constant throughout. After the areas have been outlined, the forces are applied in accordance with the

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

rules gi;,en in the last chapter. As a first approximation (and it is often about as satisfactory as the result o further effort) the application of the force diagrams may be limited to the localities of the nodal lines. If it is found that from hour to hour the curves representing the resultant virtual work have, for the system under considerat:ion, a very small amplitude in comparison with the amplitude belonging to other systems, it is probable that no considerable oscillation will be set up, and the tentative system should be abandoned, even if its dimensions be such that its period of free oscillation should agree fairly well with the periods of the tidal forces. (Cf. § 39.) With the foregoing considerations kept in view, two charts (Figs. 23, 24) have been constructed-one for the semidiurnal systems and one for the diurnal. The Roman numerals indicate, unless otherwise stated, the cotid::;.l hours.; i. e., the Greenwich lunar times of semidaily or of daily high water as the case may be. These charts are supposed to show the times of high water as given by the assumed cause. When a locality is covered by two systems, the time belonging to each is given, and so the time of the real tide would be inferred to be intermediate between the two. Again, when a locality is covered by no system, or is quite near a node, the possibility of a derived progressive wave or of a dependent fractional area must be considered. Many results of observation can be seen upon referring to Berghaus's cotidal chart of the world (Fig. 25); to a table given under §19 extracted from the Admiralty and the Coast Survey Tide Tables; to a table given under § 97 based upon harmonic constants; to Van der Stok's charts of the East Indian Archipelago (Figs. 29, 30); and to numerous items taken from charts, coast pilots, etc. It is to be noted that the cotidal hours given by Berghaus, or obtained from the Admiralty Tide Tables, refer to the lunitidal intervals at fi.tll and change, whereas the cotidal hours derived from harmonic constants, or extracted from the Coast Survey Tide Tables, refer to mean lunitidal intervals. Generally speaking, the numbering of the cotidal hours dependent upon the intervals at full and change must be diminished by about 20 minutes to make them comparable with cotidal hours referring to mean intervals. The theoretical cotidal hours always refer to mean intervals. The principal systems for the semidaily tide may be designated thus: 1. North Atlantic; 2. South Atlantic; 3. North Pacific; 4. South Pacific; 5. North Indian; 6. South Indian; 7. South Australian (solar). 72. The North Atlantic system is in the form of a broad band extending from the northeastern coast of Brazil northeasterly tA., thence northwesterly tA. to Greenland and Baffin Bay. This system may be regarded as a bent area A. in length or, preferably, on account of the depths, as two trapezoidal areas each t A. in length. In a free oscillation of a right trapezoid the rise and fall in the acute angle is much greater than elsewhere. Hence we should expect to find the range of tide great at Morocco, Spain, and Portugal and rather small at the Azores, especially at the most western islands of the group. The tides of northern Portugal, Spain, and France (and therefore Great Britain), are increased by the fact that this continental coast line in a general way opposes the American coast extending from Newfoundland to Cape Farewell by way of Davis Strait, the distance between the two coasts being about t i. The area thus defined really forms a part of the North Atlantic system; otherwise it would be too narrow to permit any considerable oscillation (lemma 3).

APPENDIX NO. 7.

OUTLINES OF TIDAL THEORY.

By making use of the force diagrams (Fig. 1) in the manner already stated, noting that the depth of the northern area is less than that of the southern, also that. the motion should be greater on the eastern side of the trapezoidal areas than on the western, because the acute angle lies along that side in both instances, we find that the cotidal hour at each American end should be about VIII and off Morocco and Portugal it should be about II. According to lemma 19 a derived progressive wave should move up the western coast of the British Isles, and thence into the Arctic seas. The results of observation can be seen upon consulting the data just referred to. In reality there is probably no well-defined nodal lines in the northern area because of the great progressive wave just referred to; but there is an approach to one. See Admiralty Tide Tables under "Tides around Ireland." In the southern area the nodal line is obliterated because the South Atlantic system has a loop between Cape Verde Islands and Brazil. 73. The South Atlantic system bears a fanciful resemblance to a branching tree, the trunk very broad and t i\. in length, extending from the Antarctic Continent to about latitude 27° S. One branch extends northeasterly t i\. to Baluchistan and India; another branch extends northwesterly i\. to the Atlantic co2st of the United States; a third branch extends about west-northwest t i\. to the eastern coast of Brazil. By making use of the force diagrams we find that for the Antarctic Continent, the coast of Baluchistan (save for the effect of the Indian systems), and Brazil, the cotidal hour should be VI. For the vicinity of South Africa (save for the effect of the south Indian system), and for the east coast of the United States, the hour should be XII. According to lemma 19 a derived progressive wave should move northward from off the western coast of southern Africa along the ~bores of the Gulf of Guinea, thence westward until it is masked by other tides. Because the loop west of Morocco and Portugal belongs to the North At,lantic system while the loop east and north of eastern Brazil belongs to the present system, the cotidal hours should, according to lemmas 19 and 25, change rapidly from the Cape Verde Islands to the Madeira falands. Three of the nodal lines should be capable of some verification by observation; one sets out from near Guadeloupe Island, another passes near Ascension, another we supp:lse to pass north of Bouvet Island. To compare with observation, consult the sources of information already referred to in § 7 I, and bear in mind the preceding lemmas. No observations have yet been made along the Antarctic Continent. This theory explains why it is that the observed semidiurnal tides are very small in the Caribbean Sea, thus causing the total tide to be largely diurnal. 74. The North Pacific system consists of two parts; a triangular region between North America and Asia, and a trapezoidal one extending from the southern side of the triangle to the coast of Chile, a distance about equal to i\.. The acute angles of the triangle fall at Colombia and the Philippine Islands; the obtuse angle at Alaska. If regarded as consisting of two right triangles, the right angles may be supposed to fall south of the Hawaiian Islands. According to the theory (§ 27) of the oscillation of a plane right.triangle whose 'oblique angles are 30° and 60°, the rise and fall at these angles should be three times as great as that at the right angle or at the middle point

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPOR1', 1900.

of the hypotenuse. The nodal lines divide the hypotenuse into three equal parts. The virtual length is the distance from the right angle to the hypotenuse. The theoretical cotidal hours for the entire system (triangles and trapezoid together) are not far from III and IX, as indicated on the chart (Fig. 23). Along the imaginary boundary shown by a heavy line drawn from the Aleutian Islands to Japan, the rise and fall, from what has just been said, should be small in comparison with that of the Gulf of Alaska. From this imaginary boundary a derived wave should, according to lemma 15, proceed into the Okhotsk and Bering Seas, the range of tide in the B"ering Sea should be somewhat reduced because of the proximity of a nodal line. The American end of this nodal line should be obscured by the presence of the South Pacific system. The openings in the rigid boundary between Luzon and Japan should, according to lemma 21, cause the observed tide to be somewhat delayed beyond its theoretical hour. The southern boundaries of the triangles are, of course, s9111ewhat uncertain. The heavy line is supposed to be drawn about where the range of the direct tide or oscillation becomes comparatively small. But by lemma 25 (latter part) there should be a good tide at the Galapagos Islands. The region around the right angles has an effectual or virtual boundary in the canal or trapezoidal area extending to Chile, a distance about equal to A. The nodal line extending from near Acapulco to the Society Islands uught to be observable, especially at its northern end. The nodal lines drawn southeast of Japan would probably be obscured because of the irregularity of the shore line. If the shores of California and those of Japan were more extended and more squarely opposing each other, theory would give VIII. 5 as the cotidal hour for the ends of this strip and II. 5 as that-for the middle. It is possible that the effect is slightly felt under existing conditions. If so, it would tend to obscure the nodal line just mentioned. As in th~ preceding cases, the above statements can be compared with observation. The agreement appears to be reasonably satisfactory; but more observations are needed to prove or disprove the existence of the nodal lines. This last remark has special reference to the eastern Ladrone Islands, the Caroline Islands, the (outer side of the) western A lentian Islands, and Clipperton Island. 75. The South Pacific system comprises a belt extending from southern Chile and Graham Land westerly and northwesterly a distance nearly equal to A, thence northeasterly a distance nearly equal to A to the coast of southern and Lower California. If we add to the L-shaped figure just described the space inclosed between it and the American coast, we have, roughly speaking, a sector of a circle. The free period of a circular sector is obtained by using for A about 0·90 of the radius. The center may be placed at 180° W. and 20° S. The two nodal circles have for radii 0·34 and 0·79 of the radius of the sector. The rise and fall at the center of a circle should be more than thrice that at the circumference. While it is not probable that the ,;ector _is perfect enough to be very satisfactory, there being no rigid walls along tl1e radial boundaries, it seems likely that it does modify the positions of the nodal lines of the L-shaped figure and lengthen the period of oscillation; also that it helps to explain the considerable range of tide north of New Zealand. It is probable that a sector truncated along the 18oth meridian would be a b~tter representative than the sector just described. The principal support of the western loop of this system is tl~e shoaling which

APPEXDIX NO. 7.

OUTLINES OF TIDAL THEORY.

approximately coincides with the 18oth 1~1eridian (Fig. 20). Again, there is a shoaling which extends from the Fiji Islands northwesterly. It lies at a distance of about i\. from the opposing North American coast, the latter extending from Alaska to Mexico(§ 53). The indefinite character of the supports of this loop adds to the uncertainty of the nodal lines of the system. The cotidal hour for the extremities and angle of the L should be VI. Between the nodal lines (or circles), other causes aside, the hour should be XII. Tierra de! Fuego and Graham Land form an incomplete boundary through which, according to lemma 14, a large derived wave should be propagated. Since the eastern coast of Patagonia is remote from any oscillating area of the Atlantic, and is so situated that no derived wa\'e of that ocean can be considerable, one can reasonably infer that the tides of this coast should be due to a wave propagated from the South Pacific system through the opening south of Cape Horn. The tides on either side of the opening should be somewhat belated (lemma 2 r). From the angle of the axis of the L, a wave (lemma 10) should progress toward Australia at the rate due to depth. Moreover, because eastern New Zealand is not far from a node, the wave progressing down its western coast should proceed up the easten1 coast; this wave should also govern the tides at Chatham Islands. A loop of this system being opposite the Hawaiian Islands should cause the tides to be earlier on the southeastern shore of Hilo Island than at Oahu or islands farther west. Observations are roughly in accord with the preceding statements, as can be seen upon consulting the sources of information referred to in § 71. 76. The North Indian system consists of a simple or canal-like area extending from the northwestern coast of Australia, a distance 71. to the coast of Somali and Arabia. By theory, the cotidal line at ei~her end should be III, and between the nodal lines it should be IX. Moreover, the Bay of Bengal being a dependent fractional area whose length lies between i- 71. and t 71., the cotidal hour above the nodal line should, by lemma 13, be III. On account of the extensive shoal off the northwestern coast of Australia, the range of tide should there be considerable. Moreover, a derived progressive wave should proceed toward and into the shallow Arafura Sea, and often with increased range. The great depths of the Banda Sea and the nature of its boundaries would prevent the derived wave from there occasioning any great rise and fall. Because the eastern boundary of the North Indian system is very oblique to the axis of the area, and because of the opening eastward it seems probable that the nodal line south of Sumatra would not be very well defined. But the nodal line drawn from Ceylon to Babie Island should be tolerably perfect. The gradual shoaling of the Bay of Bengal considerably increases its virtual length as estimated by its mean depth (§ 38). The presence of an area (between Hindostan and Mozambique) belonging to the South Atlantic system (and South Indian system), should probably obscure the nodal line drawn through the Laccadive Islands. For comparing these statements with observation, consult the sources of information referred to in § 7 r; especially consult Van der Stok's M, chart of the East Indian Archipelago (Fig. 29). To obtain the Greenwich cotidal hour from his M, chart, divide the values given by 30 and diminish the result by 7 · 1 h., the east longitude of Batavia. See Berghaus' cotidal chart (Fig. 25).

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

The time requirl!d for a free wave to travel from Timor Island to the Pacific Ocean at Gilolo and Molucca passages is perhaps six· hours. Conformably to theory, the M, cotidal hour is about III for the southern hody of water, and moreover the range of tide is considerable, as is shown in an exaggerated form at Port Darwin, Australia; also we should expect, what observation shows, that the semidiurnal tide should be small around Gilolo and Molucca passages. Hence the wave should progress from the southern body of water northward to the Pacific Ocean. The cotidal hour at these passages s~ould be about III+ 6, or IX. According to Van der Stok's chart, the wave progresses northward. 77. The South Indian system consists of a simple area extending from the south coast of Australia southwesterly t A. to where it is supported by the Antarctic Continent; thence northwesterly t i\. to Madagascar and South Africa. The cotidal hour, at either end, should be III. On account of the narrowness of this area and its general lack of lateral boundaries, the oscillation set up by the tidal forces should not be as great as in most other areas (lemma 3). For this reason one would expect to find the tide around Tasmania, except at its northwestern corner, governed by the comparatively large derived wave which sets out from the angle of the South Pacific systen~,.. The nodal line falling near Cape Leeuwin should prevent there being any sensible semidiurnal tide from the South Indian system on the western coast of Australia, say at Freemantle (§ 53). For a similar reason this coast should have no great tide from the North Indian syste;n. Because of the western nodal line, the range of tide at the Crozet Islands should be small. Some comparison with observation can be had from consulting Berghaus's cotidal chart of the world and tables of cotidal hours already referred to. In addition to this, see map of southeastern Australia (Fig. 34) and the chart of depths (Fig. 20). It is important that tides be observed upon the Antarctic Continent in longitude about 80° or 85° east; also at Crozet Islands. 78. The South Australian system consists of a simple area extending from the Antarctic Continent, a distance of about ! i\. (solar)', to the south coast of Australia. The solar cotidal hour for the north end should he VI and for the south end XII. If the tides of the South Indian system were wholly lunar, then at a station on the south coast of Australia the epoch of the solar wave should exceed that of the lunar by about 90°. But the tides of the South Indian system being partially solar, as is almost always the case elsewhere, this difference would be diminished somewhat. To compare observation with theory, it is necessary to know the amplitude and epoch or interval of the solar wave. The tides at Port Adelaide have been harmonically analyzed, and the results are in accord with what has been stated. But such an analysis should be made for some station on the Great Australian Bight; also for a station ou the Antarctic Continent in longitude about 130° east. 79. Observed intervals, ranges, cotidal hours, etc., for tlze semidaily tide systems. , In the following table the tidal values are taken either from the Admiralty or the Coast Survey Tide Tables. Intervals taken from the former relate to the time of full and change; those taken from the latter are mean intervals. (See § 7 I.) The table given under§ 97 should be consu1ted in connection with the one given here whenever the region in question contains stations at which harmo1,ic analyses have been made. This can be ascertained by referring to the charts of tide stations (Figs. 21, 22).

80. Tides in the Red Sea.

Most of the information now available concerning the tides in the Red Sea is found in the Tide Tables for the British and Irish Ports and in The Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot, both published by the Admiralty. In studying the causes of the tides Admiralty Chart 2523, or a less detailed form of it shown in Fig. 36, will be found serviceable. From the Tide Tables and this chart the following table is constructed. No great reliance should be placed upon the ranges or heights. It is probable that the values are excessive because of the considerable diurnal inequality which may have had its effect upon the estimation of the range of the tide.

*One high and one low water in the "4 hours.

More accurate information is available for Aden (No. 840, § 97 and Fig. 21) and for Djibouti, Gulf of Aden (No. 857, § 97 and Fig. 21). The M. cotidal hour at the former place is. IV·55 and a~ the latter IV·45. The amplitudes of M. are 1 ·57 and I ·74 feet, respectively. At these two places there are good phase and diurnal inequalities. The· above data show that for the southeastern. half of the sea, the Greenwich co tidal hour is about X ·4, while for the northwestern half it is about III ·7. They show that high water in the Gulf of Akabah and low~r portion of the Gulf of Suez occurs at about the sai,ne time as in the northwestern half of the Red Sea; also that in the portion of the Gulf of Suez lying ·above Tor Bank the cotidal hour is about vnr·s, showing that high water in the upper portion of the gulf is about simultaneous with low water at the mouth. · The following quotations give further information respecting the tides h1 question. Since they assert that high water at one end of the gulf is simultaneous with low water at the other end, it is probable that vnr·s should be replaced by a value more nearly equal to 3 ·7 6 or IX· 7 for the cotidal hour at full and change.

+

\Vhen the water is rising at Suez, the streani, throughout the whole length of the gulf, runs to the northward, and, when falling, to the southward.

APPENDIX NO. 7.

OUTLINES OF TIDAL THEORY.

In the strait of Jubal, at the southern end of the Gulf of Suez, the tidal streams run at from 1 ~ knots an hour in mid-channel . . . In the portion of the gulf northward of Tor high water occurs nearly at the same time as at Suez, t,he rise of tide increasing from l! feet at' the Ras Gharib to 7 feet at Suez. It is high w.ater in the southern portion of the gulf when it is about low water at Suez, and vice versll..* There is a tidal rise and fall of i;me foot nine inches at Ashrafi, and of 2 feet at the Brothers, more than loo miles farther south-eastward; but there is a rise of only one foot three inches at Tor and there appears to be none at Cape Zeiti . . . Along the shores of the Red sea a rise and fall of tide has been observed in some "places, and in some of the narrowest channels a tidal stream seems to flow; but at other parts, until the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb is neared, it is imperceptible. Here, however, the tides of the gulf of Aden begin to make themselves felt, so that at Jebel Zukur there is a rise of 2l feet at springs and of 7 feet at Perim.t to
2

Strait

of Bab-el-Mandeb.-

It is high.water, full and change, at Perim and in the straits generally at 8h.; springs. rise 6! to 7~

feet, neaps sl to 6l feet. The flood sets N. W., the ebb S. E. The str~ams are very irregular both in period and in velocity; sometimes in the center of the strait there is very little ebb, while at other times, particularly at night, at full and change, it runs at the rnte of 4 miles an hour, creating a strong ripple when opposed to the wind.:j:

On a small Admiralty chart of the strait (No. Se) it. ii;; stated that the tidal streams are ''very strong and irregular'' between Perim Island and Cape Bab-el-Mandeb (See Pilot, pp. 235, 236). Suez and Suez Canal.The tidal observations which we were able to make were necessarily somewhat imperfect from want of time, but they were made at that period of the moon's age when their effect would be greatest; the results show that in the southern portion of the canal, betwe~n Suez and Great Bitter Lake, the tidal influence from the Reel Sea is felt, there being a regular flow and ebb, - - the flood running in for about seven hours, and the ebb running out for five hours; at the Suez entrance the rise at springs, unless affected by strong winds, is ~etween 5 and 6 feet; about half way from Suez to the Small Bitter Lake, a distance of 6 miles, it is under 2 feet; at the south end of Small Bitter Lake, a few inches only; while at the south end of the Great Lake there is scarcely any perceptible ~idal influence.~

The tides at the head of the Gulf of Suez have some histonc interest, as has .been noted in Part I, § 63, and footnote. 8 1. Explanation of tlie #des in lite Guif of Suez. The average depth of the gul'f for various cross sections is tolerably constant. Above. Tor Bank it is about 20 fathoms. Regarding the gulf as a canal, this depth would give (Tables 50, 51) 114 sea miles for the value of l i\., which is the distance between Suez and Tor Bank. Although the narrowing toward the end decreases the virtual length of a body, it is probable that this effect is offset by the shoaling. See lemma 6. Hence the virtual length of the gulf above a line crossing Tor Bank is probably almost exactly f i\., or say 90°. From Suez, Zafarana .Light is / 1° 1 .t i\., or 39°; Ras Sherateeb is M·t i\., or 68°; Ras Gharib is tH·t i\., or 79°; the cosines of these angles are 0·777, 0·375, 0·191, respectively. These multiplied by 7 feet give as the spring ranges, computed from that at Suez, 5 ·4, 2 '6, and 1·3 feet. The Admiralty Tide Tables give, as shown in the above table, 5·5, 3, and 1·5 feet. From the nodal line across Tor Bank to deep water in the Strait of Jubal is 43 sea miles, the average depth being about 25

fathoms, and so the mouth of the gulf is l!'~ir·t A., or 30° from the nodal line. Tor is h·t ll., or 6°; Ashrafi I. is i'lir·t A, or 22°; and so their spring ranges derived from the value at Suez are 0·7 and 2·6 feet. At the strait the spring range should be 3·5 feet. The above table gives 1 ·25, r '7'5 and, perhaps, 3 feet. The last quotation given above indicates that 5 or 6 feet is a better value than 7 feet for the spring range at Suez . .Explanation ef the tides in the Gu(( ef Akabah.-This gulf is approximately canallike in form; the great depths show that its length is but a small fraction of A.. Consesequently (lemma 12) the tide should be simultaneous with the ti0.e outside, and the rise and fall everywhere should be about equal to that at the mouth. This inference is reasonably well borne out in the vah1es given above for Dahab, Akabak, and Omeider I. 82. Explanation of the tides in the main body of the Red Sea. The Gulfs of Suez and Akabah constitute fractional areas whose tides depend directly upon those of the. Red Sea proper. It remains to. try to account for the latter tides in a rational manner. Consider the body of water extending from the Straits of Jubal and Tinin southeasterly 972 sea miles to Great Hanish Island. The latitude and longitude of the middle point of the line thus defined are 20° 47' N. and 38° 35' E.::::21"56. The direction of this line is about N. 29° ·5 W. The average depth of the body of water is about .,, 350 fathoms, perhaps a little more. Table 50 shows that a half (lunar) wave length corresponding to this depth is 954 sea miles. But for a body of water as broad as is the Red Sea, it is probable that the free wave travels faster than the rate implied in this depth, because the depth along the axis is far in excess of 350 fathoms (Cf. §§ 36, 37). Hence the free period of this body is probably sensibly less than r 2 lunar hours. The force diagrams, applied as in the case of oscillating areas, give JV. 5 as the cotidal hour of the nor-th end and X. 5 as that of the south end. (Were the body less than }- A long and could friction be ignored, then the canal theory of § 68 would apply, giving as the cotidal hours I. 5 and. VII. 5, respectively). The tides in the extreme southeastern portion of the sea should be governed by those of the Gulf of Aden. Assuming the cotidal hour of the northwestern corner of this gulf to be V, the derived wave should occur at the time indicated by the depth plus about two hours, due to delay in passing the strait. (See§ I 13.) It is probable that this derived wave constitutes the greater part of whatever semidiurnal tide may exist at the nodal 1ine of the main area; and that, because less than six hours are required to pass from the southern portion of the sea to the north end, this derived wave causes the observed cotidal hour to be less than IV. 5 at the mouth of the Gulf of Suez. 83. Tides in lakes and inland seas whose periods ef free oscz'l/alion are const'derably · less than twelve !tours. Whenever the free period is several times less than twelve hours the corrected equilibrium theory can generally be applied with advantage unless the body is very n1rrow in comparison with its length. In this latter case the canal theory with the disturbing force uniform over the whole extent of the budy (§ 68) is more appropriate. Friction may be ignored in the first approximation. Either theory gives the same cotidal hours at the ends of the canal. On the chart, Fig. 23, are shown the theoretical cotidal lines for small seas. The lines of each set radiate fr01n a no-tide point whose longitude in time is written underneath, and this must be added to the numberings of the cotidal lines to reduce them to their Greenwich values. The bounding curve, drawn in a broken line, indicates a line of equal range; it shows how far one would have

to go from the no-tide point to obtain a range of 0·1 (!~; in particular, of o·os foot, or about 1 inch, for the M 2 tide. Along the equator this distance (east and west) would be 86 sea miles. (See§ 3 and Fig. 2.) By,aid of such diagrams, contructed for various latitude'. the theoretical time and range of the corrected equilibrium tide for any body to which the theory is applicable can be seen at a glance. In this way the tides of the Great Lakes, notably of Lake Superior, can be approximately inferred. (In this connt:ction see§§ 40, 42, Part I; § 49, Part II; § 3, Part IV A; also, Comstock, Annual Report of the Survey of the Northern and Northwestern Lakes, 1872, 1873; Ferrel, Tidal Researches, pp. 250-255.) Observations go to show that the times of the tides in Lake Michigan are better explained by the canal theory just referred to than by the equilibrium theory. This would probably be the case with Lakes Erie and Ontario. Where the equilibrium theory best applies, provided, of course, the body is not too small, there should careful observations be made for the purpose of determining from the tides the relative masses of sun and moon, as wdl as the eccentricity of the moon's orbit and perhaps other astronomical quantities. The Black Sea is probably the most suitable body for this purpose, and next in order would be Lake Superior. Much interesting and important work can probably be done along this line when good observations, made in suitable places, become available. For this reason the subject of tides in lakes and inland seas will be postponed to some future time. We shall, however, consider here in some detail the tides in the Mediterranean Sea and also those in the Gulf of Mexico. 84. Tides in the JJ1editerranean Sea. The chief sources of information respecting the tides in the Mediterranean Sea are the Tide Tables for the British and Irish Ports, the Mediterranean Pilots, both published by the Admiralty, and a number of harmonic analyses at places shown on the chart of tide stations (Fig. 21). Reference may here be made to the accompanying charts of the Mediterranean Sea, Gibraltar, and Messina straits (Figs. 37, 38, 39). The establishments and ranges or heights in the following table are those given by the Tide Tables of. the Admiralty. The establishme~t for Tripoli appears to be several hours in excess of what it should be, judging from near-by places. Other than tidal effects have probably been included in the ranges and heights, making them, in some instances. several times their true values.

The following quotations are taken from the sources indicat_ed in the footnotes.
The movement of the whole body of water in the strait of Gibraltar is, however, tidal, affected by surface current running into the Mediterranean from the Atlantic.

According to a tablt, which is here omitted, the east-going stream begins in the main · body of the strait at one and one·half hours on the days of full and change, the west going at seven and one-half hours; between the ioo-fathom Hne and the shore the eastgoing stream begins at ten and one-half hours. the west going at four and one-half hours.
Within a cable of Tarifa the west-going stream at spring tides has a rate of 2 to 3 miles an hour; but at neaps it is reduced to little more than one mile an hour. At springs the stream of the tide near th~ coast and in the bays runs at the rate of I~ to 2 miles an hour, but at neaps there are places where it nearly ceases. These inshore streams run faster or slower according as they continue with or set against the prevailing easterly current. When the tidal stream is setting to the eastward, the current at a cable distant from Tarifa attains a velocity of from 4 to 5 knots an hour, and from 5 to 6 knots an hour at 4 miles north of Alcazar point. \Vhen the tidal stream inshore is setting to the westward the rate of the general east· going set through the strait is considerably checked, its rate o~ the meridian of 'rarifa being only from 2 to 3 miles an hour in the middle of the strait, 2 miles on the coast of Africa, and rather more than one mile in the vecinity of Tari fa. Along the shores (at a greater or less distance, according to the time of the tide), the west-going stream is experienced, hut always at a greater distance from the Spanish than the African coast.

The bay of Cala Grande, on the African coast, between Al Boassa and Cires, has this great advantage, that near the shore the stream runs continually to the westward. This fact is of great importance to sailing vessels passing through the strait from east to west with foul winds. It is only during easterly winds and calms that a decided set to the westward (maximum rate one knot an hour)' is experienced in the middle of the strait. The nearer a ship is to the edge of the inshore zones, as indicated by pecked lines upon the chart [Fig. 38], the greater will be the chance of finding slack water or a .westerly set at the proper time outside those zones. The preceding remarks' refer only to the surface water; the bottom stratum is unaffected by the inrunning current of the Atlantic, and sets east or west for equal periods according to the tide, the change in the tidal streams corresponding with the time of high and low water at Gibraltar. · On the shallow ridge at the western entrance to the strait, the surface and bottom streams are tidal, the inrunning current from the Atlantic not being sufficiently strong to overrun the west-going stream. The tidal wave arrives simultaneously at Mogador in Africa, and Conil in Spain, and entering the strait, causes high water at the same time on all the coast between cape Plata and Europa point. It is not, however, until about 20 min-utes after it has attained its highest level on the coast of Spain, that the water reaches its highest level on the African shore opposite. · It is high water, full and change, with the rise of tide at the several places, as mentioned in the following table;

There are probably few places in which tide races are more numerous than in the strait of Gibraltar. They are generally found off all the salient points of the strait where the direction of the coast changes, and near the banks in their neighborhood. They fom1 without warning of any kind; the sea gets up like water boiling over a fire; short, irregular, and deep. ~hese races are dangerous, not only for boats, but even for small vessels; the wind, of course, contributes to form them, and always aµgments their violent character. The most turbulent races in the strait are generally where the angle of the point is most acute, and off which the water is not so deep; they are generally formed when the current is strongest. In some parts both streams produce these races; in others, the race is only produced by the eastgoing stream. The points 011 the coast of Spain where races are found are, cape Trafalgar, the Cabezos shoals, the south point of Tarifa, Frayle point, the Pearl rock, and Europa point. On the coast of Africa, cape Spartel, points Malabata, Altares, Al Boassa, Cires, Leona, and the northeast point of Ceuta have also races off them. Off cape Trafalgar a race fom1s at the strength of both streams. It extends to a considerable distance off the ca~ in Ii!- W. S. W. direction, crossing the bank of Aceytera, and over all the small banks of the Phare. This race, which is more formidable both in extent and violence than any other in the strait, most probably arises from two causes; the sudden change of direction in the coast and the number of banks off it.

COAST A.!';m GEODETIC SURVEY

~EPORT, 11)00.

A race is also formed on both streams on Cabez.os shoals, or near them, varying both in its extent ancl direction; and sometimes by following the sma11 shoals it becomes considerably extended, although not so.violent as the races generaly are off the points; it gets up with a troubled sea even in calm weather; and in bad weather, with much sea on, extends over the whole breadth of the strait, from the Cabezos to the flats between Malabata and Al Boassa points, on the African coast. The race off Tarifa point is comparatively of limited extent; with the east-going stream it extends to the S. E., but with the west-going S. W. It appears at the strength of each tide, that on the eastgoing stream being generally more considerable than that on the west-going. The races off Frayle and Europa points are much the same as those jusl! mentioned, the first resembling that of the Cabezos, and the last that of Tarifa; their only difference is, in being less extensive and less violent. On the African coast, off cape Spartel, Judios point, and Tangier point, the races are generally of small extent and of little importance, although they are found with both streams. The worst races are between the Malabata and Al Boassa points, over the Almirante, Phoenix, and Jaseur banks, and, as above mentioned, reach across the strait to the Cabezos. The races off Cires, Leona points, &c., as far as Ceuta, are of small extent; they are sometimes rather violent, like the tide which produces them: bt1t this is only during the east-going stream. In fact, in the strait, and principally to the northward of Tangier, there are occasional eddies as well as counter streams at springs, but they are of small extent and short di.iration. * · 85. The Strait or Faro of 1\lessina (the Fretum Siwlmn of the ancients), trends in from the gulf of Giorga, between the overlapping points of Calabria and Sicily, in a westerly direction for about. 4 miles, then turns to the S. S. \V. for 14 miles; in breadth it varies from 13~ miles between the Faro and the opposite coast west of Scilla to 2i miles abreast of Messina, and nearly 12 miles between cape Grosso and cape dell Armi, its southe'rn boundary. This strait, dreaded by the ancients, and invested by them with many imaginary terrors, requires some caution in its navigation, on account of the rapidity and irregularity.of the currents, k.nown to them as the Charybdis, but now locally termed Garofalo. The winds are also baffling when off the high land, and heavy gusts blow down the valleys and gorges; without a steady and commanding breeze a vessel may become quite unmanageable, and be turned round even when under steam. The strait is everywhere clear ~f danger and the water deep. The currents in the strait of Messina are variable, and at times attain a velocity of 5 knots. They are, however, to a great extent tidal, their greatest strength being on the day following the full and change of the moon. Occasionally the tidal currents are overpowered by other general movements of the water in the neighborhood, from winds or other causes, and the stream may then run in one direction for many hours. The flood stream runs to the northward.' the ebb to the southward, but near the coasts there are counter currents of which the mariner may take advantage. These counter streams, which are .felt between one and two hours after the commencement of the main stream, are termed Refoli when produced by the ebb, and Bastardi when caused by the flood. On the Sicilian side the principal counter streams of the ebb occur between Palazzo tower and cape Peloro; Pace and river Guardia; S. Salvatore dei Greci and S. Francesco di Paola. The breadth of these counter currenti; increases in proportion as the general stream has more duration, and is important during springs, when they extend a mile from the shore. On the Calabrian side the counter stream on the ebb does not occur north of Pezzo point, but thence south to Cantone (opposite Messina), is about a mile in breadth. With the flood or northerly stream, the only important counter current or Bastardi on the Sicilian side occurs in Messina Strait, between the light-house and Palazzo point; the others are insignificant. On the Calabrian side, however, after 2 hours flood, between Alta Fiumara and Pezzo point, there is an eddy setting to the south, having its greatest breadth off Canitello, where it extends about half a mile from the shore. At full and change the ebb stream begins at 9 h. a. m., at cape Peloro, Messina strait, and sets toward Alta Fiumara in Calabria, thence to Pezzo Point, and toward Pace in Sicily; afterwards to Salvatore dei Greci, arriving off the northeast light-house of Messina about 1 I h., setting thence toward Reggio in Calabria. .. At full and change the flood stream commences about 3 h. at Pezzo point, gradually enlarges,

and uniting with the counter current between Palazzo tower and Sottile point, the whole stream ·runs to the northeast in the direction of the channel. After 2 hours its direction changes toward Scilla, but at the same time a stream from the north unites with the fonuer near Scilla, and causes a current toward the offing. 1 At Messina the northerly current does not commence till about 5 h. At neaps the southerly currents follow the same direction as those of full and change, and produce the same counter current but with less velocity. It begins at capo di Faro at oh. 45 m., and off Messina at 3 h. 45 m. At capo di Faro the rise of water is scarcely perceptible; at Messina the maximum rise is from 10 to r3 inches, but it is greatly influenced by the winds. The meeting of the two opposing currents produces in several parts of the strait, whirls and great ripplings, locally termed Garofalo; they are represented on the chart by a scroll. The principal are, on the coast of Sicily between the Faro point and Sottile point with the ebb; and off Palazzo tower with the flood; the latter are very strong. , Off Secca point, the northeast extreme of the Braccio di San Ranieri, it is also very strong, and dangerons with a southeast wind. At Pezzo point on the Calabrian coast, there is a very strong Garofalo, whicli is also dangerous with a southeast wind. The other great ripplings without whirls, caused by the current over the uneven bottom, are termed Scala di Mare. The celebrated vortex of Charybdis, so much dreaded by the ancients, is described by Admiral Smyth as that outside the Braccio di San Ranieri, but in the French survey of the strait in 1858 the position of Charybdis is assigned to the Garofalo immediately southward of the Faro, and this being so much nearer Scilla, would be more in accordance. with the famous proverbial expression, "lncidit in Scyllam cupie11s vitare Clzarybdim,'' applicable to those who, to uvoid a less, run into a greater danger. To the southward of cape Pellaro, in Calabria the tidal streams are not felt, and the current generally is determined by the wind.* 86. The level of the water in the £gean sea is, as in most parts of the Mediterranean, more influenced by wind than by the tide ; but in such places as the rise and fall of the latter is appreciable it is regular, especially at springs. The effect of the tide at the Euripus bddge, at which place the spring tide rises about 2 feet, is very pronounced. Here the stream runs to the northward at half ebb, and to the southward at half flood, attaining a velocity of 6 or 7 knots an hour. At neaps the stream is irregular and its streµgth only from ~ to I knot an hour, and at times but little movement is experienced. At the entrance of Talanta channel, in the vicinity of the Lithada islets, the tides correspond with those at Euripus, but less in strength, the flood running in at from 1! to 2 knots an hour, and ebb setting out and to the northward at the same rate; there is a sensible rise and fall affected at times by the wind. At Volo, the rise and foll at full and change of the moon is about 8 inches. At Smyrna the water level rises with a southerly wind and falls with a northerly. The variation in the level is from 3 to 3~ feet, but at Khios and places adjacent it is only about 2 feet. On the coast of Candia or Crete, in fine weather at about the.full and change of the moon, the rise and fall is from 6 to 8 inches. t

87. Explanation of tize tides in tile eastern part o.f tlze Mediterranean. To apply the equilibrium theory to that part of the Mediterranean lying east of Sicily we draw upon the chart of the world (Fig. 23) a set of cotidal lines radiating from a .no-tide point whose position is the center of gravity of the surface, the elliptical outline showing how far we must go from this point to obtain an M, range of o·os foot, or about r inch. To reduce the cotidal hours of the dia~ram to the meridian of Greenwich, subtract the l · 56 hours. The cotidal hour for the coast of Syria should be about 9-1·56 or VII·5 say, and for eastern Sicily about 3·5-1·56 or II. The range of the lunar tide for the first locality should be 0·45 foot and for the latter 0·32 foot. Observations at Malta make the cotidal hour n·1 and M, = 0·20 foot or 2 M, = 0·4 foot. (See No. 935 of table given under § 97.) It is also to be noted that the age of the phase inequality is not great at Malta; this is in accordance with the equilibrium theory. In

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1900.

attempting to explain the tides of a body whose length is several times its width, it should be borne in mind that the times are largely governed by their end values, as in the canal theory. Agreeably to theory, the above quotations show that the tides in the vicinity of Candia, or Crete, are relatively sma11. The varymg depths of the Adriatic Sea and the large cross section of the Strait of Otranto would indicate that a wave progresses upward at a rate due to depth. Moreover, the shoaling and contracting toward the head of this sea would account for a considerable increase in the range of tide. These statements agree well with the results of observation. · 88. Explanati<Jn ef tlte tides in the western part ef the Mediterranean. A set of cotidal lines for the part of the Mediterranean Sea west of Sardinia is also drawn on the chart of the world. (Fig. 23.) The tides of this region are necessarily influenced by those of the remainder of the sea and of the Atlantic Oeean. In the vicinity of Marseilles and To11lon the equilibrium tide ought to be more conspicuous than in localities nearer to the no-tide point or nearer to the .)penings. The equilibrium cotidal hour should be a little more than VI for Marseilles and· a little less than VII for Toulon. The range of the lunar tide should. be about 1 '.6 inches. From harmonic analysis of observations the cotidal hours are found to be VJI·2 and VIII·o; the ranges . are 0·44 and 0·38 foot, respectively. Although these cotidal hours are not very different from those given by theory, the discrepancy in range L too great to be accounted for by the small sh9al along the southern coast of France. If there were a solid wall along the meridian of Sardinia, the tide in the portion of the sea west of it would, so far as the effect of the Atlantic is concerned, be six hours behind the tide outside the Strait of Gibraltar. This would make the cotidal hour VIII, or a little less. (See § 103; also the preceding quotations concerning the strait.) By § 103 it is possible to ascertain rougb.ly the .velocity in the strait; with the assumed wall, the resulting rise and fall of the portion of the sea west of it, due to the influx through the strait, will be found to be nearly equal to the observed ranges at Marseilles and Toulon. Hence we conclude that the tides at these two places are chiefly derived from the tides of the Atlantic, but that they are augmented by the equilibrium tide. From the quotations given above it is to be noted that the eastward current in the Strait of Gibraltar and the northward current in the Strait of Messina begin at about the times of high water at their outer ends, that is, ends where the tides are greatest. In the one case, the Atlantic Ocean is the tided body, in the other the Ionian Sea. By referring to § 103 it is easily seen that these statement~ accord well with ·he theory for a strait leading from a tided to a tideless body of water. The observed di munition of range is also in accordance with theory. 89. Tides in the Gulf ef Mexico. The semidiurnal tides in many parts of the Gulf are so small in comparison with the diurnal that they can not be observed directly. For this reason we should depend chiefly upon the results of harmonic analyses whenever we attempt to compare theory with observation. The consideration of the diurnal portion of the tide will be deferred to a later section (§ 92). The following is a list of stations, together with their cotidal hour and range of lunar tide (2 M.) in feet: Key West, II·r, l ·12; Tortugas Harbor Light, JI·8, 0·96; Cedar Keyl' v·I·3, 2·12; St. Marks Light, VII·1, 2·24; Warringtbn Navy-Yard, Pensacola Bay, IV·4, o· 12; Mobile Point Light, Mobile Bay, III·9, 0·14; Biloxi Light, VI·3, 0·22; Cat Island Light, VI·3. 0·24; Port Eads, IV·5, 0'12; Galves-

ton, X·5, 0·44; Tampico, VIII·6, 0·16; Vera Cruz, VIII·9, 0·40; and Campeche, IX·o, I '6, No great reliance can be placed on the Tampico values because they were obtained from a record in which twenty-four hours ~vere represented by 0·4 of an inch. 90. Explanation ef the semidiurnal tides in tile Gulf ef Mexico. By inspecting the cotidal diagram for the Gulf, shown upon the chart of the world (Fig. 23), we obtain the following cotidal hours and ranges (at the shore) for the equilibrium tide: Cedar Keys, n·s, 0·37; Port Eads, I·2, O'II; Galveston, x·o, 0·21; Vera Cruz, VIII·2, 0·26; and Campeche, VI·o, 0·10. On account of extensive shoaling, the range of tide at Cedar Keys, Galveston, and Campeche, especially, should be greatly increased. All intervals should have their (off-shore) equilibrium values increased by the time required for a free wave to pass from deep water to the shore. Thus modified, the cotidal hours become for Cedar Keys, V·s; for Port Eads, I·6; for Galveston, XII·4; for Vera Cruz, VIII·6; and for Campeche, IX·o . . Consider now the derived wave coming from the Atlantic through Florida Strait. · The cotidal hour for the outer coast of northern and eastern Florida is XII. Although this would to a certain extent come under§§ 103, 113, the result is probably about the same as would be obtained frolll the consideration of a free progressive wave moving at rates due to depths. Upon referring to the charts of depths we see that the cotidal hour for a point at the extreme west end of the keys might reasonably be III, or a line less, which is in agreement with observation. Starting with this value, we have as the cotidal hours of the progressive wa\'e, Cedar Keys, VII; Port Eads, V; Galveston, VIII; · Vera Cruz, VI; and Campeche, VIII. The means between these times and the modified equilibrium values agree tolerably well with the results of observation given above. It is reasonable to suppose thait: the derived wave in the deep water of the Gulf should be very small in comparison with its value at Key West. This surmise is further confirmed by the fact that at Port Eads the equilibrium tide is small; yet when combined with the derived wave, it:i phases specified by I'6 and V, the resultant tide is about the size of the equilibrium tide. Hence the derived wave here has considerably less than twice the range of that of the equilibrium theory. For Cedar Keys, Vera Cruz, and Campeche, the two theoretical waves are in approximately like phases; hence their effects are added together. At Galveston the waves meet in nearly opposite phases. Both waves are greatly increased by the effect of shoaling for Cedar Keys, Galveston; and Campeche. gr. Fractional oscillating areas. Two areas of this kind have already been described-the Bay of Bengal and the Gulf of Suez. In these the cotidal hours are the same as those of the system upon which they depend. It often happens that the wave has proceeded for some considerable distance from its source before reaching the dependent fractional areas. For instance, the cotidal hour for the mouth of the English Channel is V, while that of the source of the WestEuropean tide is II, so that three lunar hours must be allowed for wave propagation across the Bay of Biscay to the mouth of the Channel. Again, four or more hours are required for a wave to pa'iS from the region marked VI through Cape Horn Strait to west of the Falkland Islands. This consideration should be borne in mind in attempting to connect the fractional dependent areas with the areas where the tides originate. As already stated, areas t "A long are of a critical length and generally have their tide about three hours later than the tide outside. In the following list ''observed'' means values obtained or inferred from such observations at or near the given localities as are available.

·Branching off from the Dixon-Entrance area are several dependent areas, viz., Portland Canal, llehm Canal Clart:nce Strait with Western Behm Canal and Ernest Sound (Fig.3~). In all the wave is nearly stationary so that th~ cotidal hours are but little more than IX, and the range at the heads is about 13 or 14 feet. Throughout Chatham Strait and its branches the cotidal hour is but little more than IX. The range of tide ( 2 Mo) near the head of Lynn Canal is about 12 feet.

DIURNAL TIDES.

92. The principal systems for the diurnal tide may be designated thus: I. West Atlantic diurnal; 2. North Pacific diurnal; 3. Indian diurnal. The West Atlantic system (if we may so use the word ''system '') consists of a partially inclosed body of water whose tides are assumed to be roughly in accord with the corrected equilibrium theory. For the sake of definiteness, consider a circular area 40° in diameter with its center situated at 30° N. and 50° W. The equilibrium times (5oth meridian) are as shown 011 the chart for the diurnal systems (Fig. 24). At the north the cotidal hour is numbered o; at· the west, 6; at the south, 12; and at the east, 18. The Greenwich values are obtained by adding three and one-third hours to the diagram values. The theoretical amplitude for this area is shown (in stereographic projection) in Fig. 6. The unit used is U C1 , which is (§3) about o·s foot for K 1 +0 1 · There are several reasons why this hypothesis does not apply very accurately to the case f in hand: ( 1) There are two broad openings, one between Brazil and western Africa, the other between Europe and Greenland; (2) the dimensions and depths are such that a

free wave can not cross and recross a sufficient number of times in twenty-four hours to permit the formation of a very good level surface; (3) shallow regions near the shores, as usual for this theory, do not form a part of the equilibrating body of water; as a consequence wave motion should be set up which might greatly increase the range of the tide, and, in the common case of a progressive wave, cause an increase in the cotidal hours. This theory should best apply to the eastern coast of the United States, the Bermuda Islands, and the outer coast of the West Indies. There the age of the diurnal inequality (or K, 0 -0 1 °) should be small, and the amplitudes K 11 0 11 P 1 should have their theoretical ratios to one another. An inspection of the diurnal chart shows that the diurnal cotidal hour for the Windward Islands should be about 10* + 31\- or XIV. The chart of depths shows that a fractional dependent area extends from these islands to the Gulf coast of the. United States. Suppose a nodal line to be drawn from western Haiti to Nicaragua. Now imagine the portion of the area northwest of this line to be duplicated by a like area lying south of this line as a line of symmetry. Then applying lemma 7 we can see how the virtual length of the region northwest of the nodal line is increased. The distance between the nodal line and the Windward Islands is about three lunar hours, or i A. Hence the cotidal hour for the diurnal tide in the Gulf should be XIV+ 12, or II; and the range of that wave should there be somewhat greater than at the Windward Islands. The stations for which harmonic analyses have been 111ade are shown upon the chart of tide stations (Fig. 21). The value of K,+ 0, and the cotidal hour are given under § 97. Along the eastern coast of the United States the theoretical .cotidal hour should be increased by about 3 on account of the extensive shoaling, ~·hich gives rise to a progressive wave. Of course the theoretical amplitudes should be greatly increased. For Porto Rico, St. Thomas Islands, and even Lisbon, the theoretical times should be increased by l;mt a fraction of an hour, and the theoretical amplitudes should not be greatly increased. . Since the Gulf of Mexico forms part of oscillating area, the tides should be nearly simultaneous along the open coast from northern Florida to Yucatan (lemma 9); the cotidal hour should be II. 93. The North Pacific diurnal system consists at first of an east-and-west strip of water whose southern boundary approximately coincides with the parallel 20° N. The eastern' boundary consists of Lower California, California, Oregon, Washington; the western, of the Bonin Islands and shoals, eastern Japan, the Kuril Islands and shoals. The center of this area being 11 ·5 hours west of Greenwich, we should have, by § 67, XI·5 as the cotidal line for the east end, and XXIII·5 for the west end. But the principal area responsible for the diurnal tides consists of the whole of that portion of the Pacific Ocean \vhich lies northwest of a line drawn, say, from Point Arguella, southern California, to the eastern extremity of San Christoval Island. The force diagrams applied to this somewhat triangular area give XV for the cotidal hour of the American end and III for that of end extending from the Philippine to the Solomon Islands. As a matter of fact, the observed value for Alaska is about XVIII, and for the Pacific Coast of Gilolo, and perhaps New Guinea, VI. This discrepancy may possibly be explained by considering a progressive wave due to the superposition of the two oscillations just desclibed, which d,iffer in phase, taken in connection with the virtual length of t,he principal area, which probably is in excess of A. See §§ 26, 32, and 31 (end), 61.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1900.

The greatest rise and fall should occur along the coast extending from Oregon to the Gulf of Alaska. Because of the two overlapping areas the cotidal hour should be XI·s for Lower California and increase quite rapidly to Oregon; thence northwesterly the increase should be slow, the prevailing cotidal hour being, it appears from observation, XVIII. The cotidal hour for the Kuril Islands should be XXIII·s or -0·5, and this probably increases to about VI on the Philippine coast, and so VI is probably the hour for Molucca Passage, New Guinea, and the Solomon· Islands. The two overlapping areas prevent there being any nodal line in the North Pacific. The tides at Honolulu should be small in comparison with those on the coast of southeastern Alaska, and the cotidal hour should He between XI· 5 and XVIII. The tide at St. Michael should be somewhat later than that at the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka, to allow for the transmission of a free wave across the shoal portion of Bering Sea. It is, however, probable that the deeper portion of Bering Sea forms a dependent fractional area. If so, the simultaneous motion would, by lemma 9, extend well up toward St. Matthew Island before a progressive wave comes into being; cf., the Gulf of Maine and the Bay of Fundy. Possibly only a few hours would have to be added to the Kuril and Kamchatka values. By referring to the chart of semidiurnal tides, we infer, because of the proximity of a nodal line, that the tides along the northern shores of New Guinea should be largely diurnal. It is difficult to see how any considerable derived tide could set out from the Northern Pacific Ocean into the Southern. To compare with observations, see the table in § 97, where are given the cotidal hours derived from harmonic constants. See also Van der Stok's map of the East Indies for K,. His values can be converted into hours by dividing by 15, and reduced to the meridian .of Greenwich by subtracting 7 · 1 from the quotient. Of course K, hours are not quite equal to K, 0, hours, which are practically lunar hours. Observations are much wanted on the eastern coast of the Philippines and the northern coast of New Guinea. 94. The Indian diurnal system consists of a half-wave area extending from northwestern and western Australia to Somali and Arabia. As shown on the chart, the nodal line lies south of Ceylon and not very far away. Hence the diurnal tide should there be small. A reference to the chart of the semidiurnal system (Fig. 23) will show that the semidiurnal tide also is there small. Hence the tide at eastern Ceylon, both diurnal and semidiurnal, is small. By applying the force diagrams, we see that the cotidal hour for the east end of the area should be XII and for the west end XXIV. As already stated, the time required for a free wave to pass from Timor Island to Molocca and Gilolo passages is perhaps six hours. Now, the cotidal hour for the former locality is XII and for the latter, VI. The openings from the north are greater than those from the south. Hence the wave from the Pacific should progress through the passages almost to Timor Island before being met by the wave from the south. According to lemma 19, it might be inferred that a derived wave should be formed on the western coast of Australia, which might be sensible alo;ng the sbuthern and even the eastern coasts and possibly to New Zealand if not obscured by a greater wave derived from other sources. Since there appear to be no such sources which might cause the diurnal tides in these localities, this explanation seems to be plausible. To compare theory with observation, consult the sources of information referred to in the last section, especially Van der Stok's map of the K, tide (Fig. 30). Besides

consulting the charts of depths covering the world (Figs. 19, 20), one should also consult Fig. 34, which shows the depths around southeastern Australia. 9S· Tlze diurnal tides of tke Mediterranean Sea. In attempting to explain these tides, the first question is, Can this sea oscillate in a period approximating 24 hours? Were the island of Sicily, together with the neighboring shoals, removed, and a depth about equal to that of the remainder of the sea substituted in its place, the peripd of free oscillation could hardly exceed 12 or 14 hours. As already stated, the period of a half-wave area is considerably lengthened by a contraction near th~ center or nodal line. An experiment described in § SS shows that the period can be greatly lengthened by a shoaling along the nodal line. The effect of both combined (the latter being far more important) may be sufficient to cause the free period to approach 24 hours. Accordingly shall assttmt! that the Mediterranean Sea does constitute an oscillating area. The nodal line should fall not far from Malta. The force diagrams give X as the cotidal hour of the west end and XXII for that of the east. These inferences are well borne out by observations made at Malta, Toulon, and Marseilles. See values given in § 97. At present there is no information available for the eastern part of the sea. 96. rractional oscillat£ng areas for diurnal tides. One area of this kin<l has already been mentioned, viz., the Caribbean Sea anJ the Gulf of Mexico. Imagine a body like the China Sea to be connected with the real China Sea through the strait between Luzon and Formosa. The free period of such a body would probably be not far from 24 hours, if we take into consideration the contraction and shoaling at the strait (§§ s4, 5s). Hence the China Sea and the strait constitute a fractional area of critical length t A.. The tides in the sea should be t r or 6 hours later than the tides outside. Hence the cotidal hour for the China Sea should be XII, ~nd the range of tide may there be considerable. The Gulf .of St. Lawrence, with Cabot Strait and the channel outside, consti~ute a fractional area a little more than t A. in length. Hence the cotidal hour fo,· the gulf should differ by 12 from the cotidal hour at the edge of deep water in the Atlantic; , that is, it should be V 12 = XVII. Some observed values with which to compare these inferences are given in the next section. 97. Intervals, ranges, cotidal kours, etc., den"ved from /1armonic constants. In the accompanying table the arbitrary serial number refers to the charts of tide stations (Figs. 21, 2 2). The table is intended to include all stations where some form of harmonic analysis has been made and the results are available (see § 145, Part I). At a few of the places given, no analysis has yet been made, although suitable records for the purpose exist. This a'ccounts for a few blank spaces in the table. The cotidal hour of the semidiurnal tide has reference to the constituent M 2 and that of the diurnal to K 1 an'd 0 1 , as shown in the heading. We have

CHAPTER VIII.
ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF RIVERS, STRAITS, BAYS, ETC., WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR 'rIDAL MOVEMENTS.

98. In this chapter attention will be called to. certain simple or typical cases of liquid motion and to those natural bodies of water which serve to exemplify the same in a measure, or in certain respects. As usual, the depth will be assumed to be so great in comparison with the range of tide that shallow-water components due to the want of such depth need not be considered. Friction is not taken into consideration. The various cases or types which seem important are for convenience given an arbitrary numbering. Sometimes a given body of water may fall under two or more cases, and sometimes it may ~-ot closely resemble any of the types mentioned. Some of the natural bodies of water instanced below serve well as illustrations, while others lie outside the limits assigned in the cases under which they are given. The more detailed study of movements of this kind, together with comparisons with observations, will be given at some future time.*

of the river. By constant is meant constant for a given component at different points of the river. This shows that the amplitude of any partial tide varies as the range of tide varies; in other wbrds, the ratios of the amplitudes of the partial tides remain constant. (See § 33, Part I.) The ratio of the amplitudes of any two tidal components, or of any two velocity components, or of any one tidal and one velocity component, remains the same at each point of the river.

Tidal plienomena,-This case is, in a certain sense, intermediate between Cases 2 and 8. The water inside keeps upon very nearly the same level as the water outside. The times of tide are delayed a little on account of the narrowness of the opening. For cases found in nature, the want of a sufficiently good reflection causes an imperfect progressive wave and so a delay in the time of the tides. See Case 15. Delay may also result, as in the next case, when K/ A'l falls much below 10. The partial tides and the ages of the various tidal inequalities have about the same values within and without.

Consequently the ratios of the partial velocities to the corre-

sponding partial tides are proportional to the speeds of the partial tides. For example, the diurnal inequality in the velocity is comparatively but one-half as great as in the tides, whereas the quarter diurnal velocity components would be comparatively twice as great as the quarter diurnal tidal component. Flood begins at the time of low water inside.

§ 36, Part I). Tidal phenomena.-Partial tides can not be independently considered, for we here have motion not truly oscillatory. High water in the gulf occurs t T' later than high water outside. The range inside is very small. For outside ranges having like values but different durations, the inside ranges are proportional to such durations. Such amplitude ratios as S.f M2 , N)M2 , are, in the limit, but about t as great in the gulf as outside. This is found by varying the outside amplitude, A' 1 , under the radical sign. If the diurnal inequality outside be so small that the duration of ·rise or fall is not much affected thereby, then we may add to the above amplitude ratios the ratio (K, O.)/M 2 · A siinilar statement is tr~e of the velocity amplitude ratios ~uch as S/M NjM and (K,+ O,)/M2 · Flood in the strait begins nearly i T' after the time of low water outside. When the diurnal inequality is large then we must say that, in the limit, slack water occurs at the time when A', cos (m.f +a,)+ B', cos (d,t /3,) = o, the second term referring to the diurnal wave. A tidal inequality, which can be represented by a single component outside, will inside require two components for its representation, as does the corresponding velocity inequality (See§ ro6). A second approximation to the velocity in the strait is 8·02 ./(C1 -C11 ). Slack occurs when both outer and inner bodies have the same level. In the preceding expression A', cos (m,t +a,) and B 11 cos ( d,t f31 ) then refer to the difference between the outside and inside levels. See § 9 and Case 9. . Examples.-A float box with openings so small that the range within is nearly destroyed. See§9. (ForFig.7,Kor.,/(2g). e/a=1·321ando·757). NewRiverand New River Inlet, N. C. (K = 0·28); Port Phillip and Entrance, S. Australia K = 1·6); Lake Pontchartrain and Rigolets Passes (tide diurnal, K = o·6); see also Case r4. [Torricelli's theorem can be applied to steady motion where it would fail had the motion a reasonably short period; e. g., it applies to the Gulf of Mexico and Florida Strait when the Gulf Stream is to be explained, but it does not help explain the tides in the strait.

Tidal phenomena.-The heights in the strait will be a little uncertain on account of the assumption that its surface is a plane. If we regard the tides at the two ends as simply harmonic, and if they happen to differ in phase by t -r, there will be no rise and fall at a point which divides the strait into parts proportional to the end amplitudes. In this case it would be high water in one end of the strait, at the time of low water in the other end'. From the derivative of '· it is readily seen that the time ~f high water at a given point in the strait must be intermediate between the times of the high waters at the two ends. (See §4, Part III, or §9, Part I.) From the expression for the velocity of the water particles, it is evident that partial or component velocities can not be independently considered. Such velocity ratios as S)M. and N)M:. will be, in the limit, about t as great as the corresponding tidal ratios for a wave made up of the difference of the end tide·waves. If the tides are similar at both ends, these tidal ratios have the end values. The phase inequality in current velocity can not be represented by a single coi:nponent as can, very nearly, the phase it1equality in the tides; but such a combination must be used as shall much diminish the inequality in amplitude but not in time. Let fa. denote the required additional component; let these be made to conspire at about the time of the octants and interfere at the time of ,spring and neap tides [cf. tide components N., L.J. Since the inequalities in the times of slack water or of maximum velocities are the same as in the times of the tides, we must have

First, imagine the tide wave to 'progress from each direction at rate due to depth, meeting, say, in the (virtual) middle of the strait .. Tidat'plwzomena.-The tide will be in general partly stationary and partly progressive through the strait, depending upon the relative values of the amplitudes and phases in the two bodies. If the waves have equal amplitµdes and meet in like phases, the tide in the strait will be stationary and the range will be determined by rules for a stationary wave given under Cases 2 and 3, the length of the canal being one-half the l~ngth of the strait. If the waves of equal amplitude meet in opposite phases, the range at the middle of the strait may be destroyed. The wave in the strait will be stationary, having the center as its node.

Tidal p!imomena.-Strait and gulf give rise to a very imperfect progressive wave. In a measure Case r applies; but the ratios of the amplitudes of the partial tides do not remain constant as we proceed from point to point, for reasons given under Cases 3 and 8. The ages of the various inequalities do not all vary by the same amount as the wave proceeds. The amplitude of the tide in the gulf is often much reduced. The time of tide is generally considerably delayed beyond the delay of transmission at the rate due to depth. In fact, for an extreme case we should almost have Case 8, provided that only that portion of the inner body near the strait be regarded as the inner body; hence the delay in transmission. The excess of downhill over uphill flow is an index of the applicability of Torricelli's theorem. . The velocity of the water· particles is small, excepting in the strait, where it may be considerable. Its value may be found as in Case 13. Examples. -Galveston Harbor and entrance ( K = o ·6); Pamlico Sound and entrance; Great South Bay, L. I., and Fire Island Inlet ( K = 0·87); St. John River, New Brunswick; New River and New River Inlet (K = 0·28). 1r2. It is instructive to consider the simplest cases where the tide ~onsists of both a progressive and stationary wave without ai:.suming the predominance of either, for the tides in many natural bodies of water can then be explained in a satisfactory manner. Two cases will be noted here, one where the stationary portion of the wave is due to a reflection, as in Cases 2 and 3, the other where there is a strait leading from the sea to a body having no tide of its own. (See Case 6.)

first place the length of the channel or body to be less than t A. Then judging by the stationary wave it should be high water throughout the channel or body at the time of high water outside; judging by the progressive wave the tide in the channel or body should be l!lter than the tide outside by the interval required for a free wave to pass to the point in question. The real time of tide lies between that given by these two suppositions. The flood velocity in the progressive wave has its maximum value at the time of local high water. The flood velocity in the stationary wave has its maximum value 3 hours before the time of ourside high water. The real time of maximum flood at any given point lies between these two times. (For a body t A long, see Case 4.) As the shore is approached, the progressive wave which set out from the edge of the deep water is continually meeting with partially reflecting obstructions. Their effect can be seen by imagining the sloping bottom to consist of a series of steps. The whole wave as it leaves deep water is partly progressive and partly stationary, the stationary part being due to the general reflecting effect of the shoaling and shore. Now, as already stated, a good reflector must turn back the wave at nearly one locality; whereas the bottom may be regarded as a series of steps partially turning the wave back at each reflecting surface. Hence there will generally be a progressive wave. Now the shore line may be supposed to form the last of these hypothetical steps. The water adjacent to the shore, provided there are no inlets or great irregularities, constitutes a dependent wave almost entirely stationary, because, so far as this region is concerned, the returning reflected wave from any part of this strip can differ but little in phase from the returning wave from any other part. Hence the flood current near the shore turns very soon after the time of local high water. (Cf. Lamb, Hydrodynamics,§§ 173, 18r.) In so far as the stationary character of the wave is developed, the ratios of the amplitudes of the diurnal constituents of the current to those of the semidiurnal will approach onehalf the corresponding tidal ratio, while the amplitudes of the quarter and sixth diurnal current constituents will be unduly augmented. See Case 2. Examples.-For bodies of considerable length may be mentioned Long Island Sound, the Gulf of Maine. For short bodies, imaginary canals leading shoreward from deep water along nearly all coasts and many harbors; in Boston Harbor the wave is nearly all stationary; in ~ew York Lower Bay the wave is part prpgressive and part stationary. See Current Tables in United States Coast Survey Tide Tables.

The entire displacements are

The subscripts p and s refer to the progressive and stationary portions re~pectively. For the progressive motion the particles move in elliptical orbits(§ 19, Part I); for the stationary motion they evidently move in rectilinear paths (§ 35, Part IV A). But if we here eliminate the time angle between the expressions for.e and <:, we see that the resulting equation involving and I; represents an ellipse. Tidal phenomena.-Suppose the inner body to be so large that the stationary portion of the tide in the strait causes no tide in the inner body sufficiently large to influence the stationary wave in the strait. Then towards the inner end of the strait the time of high water will be governed by the progressive part of the tide wave, moving inward from the outer body at the rate due to depth. For the progressive part, the strength of flood occurs at the time of local high water of this part. Throughout the strait the flood for the stationary part begins at the time of high water outside. In straits less than i A. in length the strength of flood for the entire tide should occur between o and 3 hours after high water outside. Consequently for a large and sufficiently deep inner body it should be on the whole high water from 3 to 6 hour~ after it is high water outside. If the end of the inner sea near the strait be shallow, the tide there is generally about 3 hours later than the tide outside unless the strait is very large. (Cf. Cases 6 and 14.) Examples.-Korean Strait and the Sea of Japan (K = o'6); Strait Bab-el-Mandeb and the Red Sea (K = 0·31); Florida Strait and Gulf of Mexico (K = 1·6); Strait of Magellan and inner waters beyond Second Narrows; North Channel and Atlantic Ocean. The. tides in a land-locked harbor or other small body of water, even if the strait leading to it be quite small, are explained by Case 7. It may be here noted that a long-period wave can better reach all harbors with very contracted openings than can a wave of short period. In such a case O/K, might have approximately its outside value while S)M. would be much diminished. Port Phillip is an example of this. In a body having a still smaller opening we have Case 8. I 14- Origin of swift tidal currents or races. Tidal currents become noticeable and important in localities where their vdocity is unusually great. The causes of the swiftness are various and not always apparent. They may be supposed to be divided into two classes, although both are generally interdependent. In the first class we lose sight of the wave or oscillation as a whole and consider merely what local configuration of the shore ought to augment the velocity. So far as the cause is thus regarded, the rules of steady motion apply, and this class will therefore be referred to under that title. In the other class the oscillation is taken into consideration, and the proximity to nodal lines or whether the point considered lie on a shoal or in a strait will generally be an important item in ascertaining comparative velocities. Steady motion.-This is most nearly realized at the time of maximum velocity. The following cases may be noted .(I) Flow around sharp points or capes caused by the requirements of twodimensional motion. E. g., off Cape de la Hague; off southeastern Patagonia. (2) Partial separation of two bodies of water by walls of land or by shoals causing a difference in head so that Torricelli's theorem may, in a measure, be applied. In this

way overfalls may be produced. E. g., East River, New York; Sergius Narrows, Alaska; Seymour Narrows, British Columbia; entrance to Port Phillip, South Australia. (3) At the outer or concave side of a bend the velocity is increased because of the water's inertia. This effect is best seen in streams which usually flow in but one direction. E. g., the Mississippi River. Oscillatory motzon.-Chapters III-V show how the nodal lines may be ascertained in several forms of areas; they also show how at some contracted or shallow parts of certain areas the velocity is much increased, and the present cl:apter has treated of closed canals and straits. The following cases of increased velocity may be noted: ( 1) The proximity to a ·nodal line of a canal-like area. E. g., near Tor; Race Rocks, Strait Juan de Fuca. (2) A shoaling over which a wave is propagated. (3) In a strait the velocity may be considerable. E. g., Magellan Strait; Golden Gate; Strait of Gibraltar; Strait of Messina; Pentland Firth. All but the last have already been referred to in this chapter. The strong tidal streams in. this firth are partly

~xplained by the velocity due to

wave motion, vfa.

r;,.j j, multiplied by a factor due to

the contraction experienced by the wave in passing between Scotland and the Orkneys, and partly by Case 9. · 115. Ongin of countercurrents and eddies. Discontinuity in the motion of a perfect liquid implies that the latter is endowed with the property of inertia; also that rather sudden changes in the depth or in shore line occur: On one side of a line of discontinuity will be found the main stream; on the other, a mass of water either nearly motionless or circulating round and round, its motion being derived from its relation to, and contact with, the main stream. A double effect is produced by an island or other surrounded object, as a pier. When observed from or near the shore and when existing on a comparatively large scale, the phenomenon is spoken of as a countercurrent; whenever the circulation is tolerably complete and can be readily seen from one point the phenomenon is spoken of as an eddy or whirlpool. The greater the motion of the main stream becomes the greater, as a rule, will be the chance of finding eddies and countercurrents. Hence, in tidal streams flood or ebb may have to run for some time in order to acquire a sufficient velocity and disturbance of level to .cause them. Along the shores of some sounds and tidal rivers, the currents turn earlier than in the channel because the backward accelerating force proportioval to the instantaneous slope of the surface is there sooner effective. The following classes (generally involving, or modified by, fluid friction or viscosity) may be noted: ( 1) Countercurrents or dead water occurring in shallows which border the channel. E. g., edges of Strait of Gibraltar; shallow bights along creeks and rivers. ( 2) 'Countercurrent or eddy occurring along the inner side of a bend in a stream, provided the stream there widens. The outer side, where the main current runs, is by § 12 higher than the inner, the greatest difference of level being at the upstrea~ end of the widening. But the inertia of the water prevents the lateral pressure gradient, i. e., change in pressure on a slender vertical prism in going transverse to the stream, at the upstream end from there setting up the transverse velocity seen further downstream; hence the countercurrent. See equation ( 92).

(3) Countercurrent due to a projecting cape. - They are usually much more conspicuous on the downstream side. E. g., near Cape Peloro and Point Pezzo, Messina Strait (Fig. 39). (4) Eddy found in a rocky bight. The water may or may not be deep. E. g., almost any rock-bound brook or creek, as the upper Potomac. (5) Eddies formed just below projecting rocky capes or headlands. They often move to a considerable distance H existing on a small scale in open \Vater. E. g., eddies seen near stone bridge piers; the East River, New York; among the Lofoten Islands; off Scylla; south of Seavys Island, Portsmouth Harbor; off Stroma and Swona Islands, Pentland Firth. ( 6) Eddy formed in an inclosed pool whose inlet and outlet are near together and flow in quite different directions; the incoming water having inertia is thereby prevented from an immediate exit. The outward flow is greatest at some considerable depth because the incoming stream is supposed to be very swift at the surface. E. g., the whirlpool below Niagara Falls.* ( 7) Eddy formed in a pool at the foot of a waterfall caused by the depression of the surface of the upstream edge of the pool. It is obvious that in the same locality the effects of flood and ebb in the production of eddies may be quite different. This is well exemplified in the Strait of Messina and Pentland Firth. Again, since eddies in some localities may come into existen~e only when the velocity of the main tidal stream exceeds a certain limit, the character of the observed motion may there be qujte different at the time of spring tides from what it is at the time of neap tides. For a discussion of countercurrents which accompany ocean drift, or wind currents, the reader is referred to Krummel, Handbuch der Ozeanographie, Vol. II, pp. 352 et seq.

THE DETERMINATION OF THE MEAN VALUE OF ONE REVOLUTION OF A MICROMETER SCREW AND THE PROGRESSIVE AND PERIODIC ERRORS OF THE SCREW, FROM OBSERVATIONS ON A CIRCUMPOLAR STAR NEAR ITS ELONGATION.
By EDWIN SMITH,

Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Sttrvey.

The zenith telescope of the International Geodetic Association latitude service, used by the writer at Gaithersburg, Md., 1899-r900, is described in the "Anleitung zum Gebrauche des Zenitteleskops auf den Internationalen Breitenstationen, von Th. Albrecht," and also in Appendix No. s, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report r900. The working part of 'the micrometer screw is lin1ited to 30 revolutions, but the screw can be used between - 2 and+ 32 revolutions. When the instrument"is set telescope west, a star at western elongation will move over the field in the direction of increasing readings of the screw and at eastern elongation in the direction of decrea5ing readings of the screw, and vice versa for telescope east. For telescope west, pointing north, the level scales increase toward eye end, and vice versa for teleseope east. The observations to determine the mean value of one revolution of the micrometer screw, and its errors, were made on o Urs. Min., s1 Cephei, a Urs. Min., and A. Urs. Min., near their elongations. The instrument was set so that the star at elongation would transit over the micrometer thread set at the middle reading, or rs revolutions, as nearly as practicable. This was accomplished by computing from the approximately known value of one revolution, the time it would take the star to move over r 1 revolutions, and with the thread set at - 2 or+ 32 revolutions the star was bisected at the time of 17 revolutions before elongation. There was then time to set and clamp the levels before the star would reach the thread set at o or 30 revolutions. On a Urs. Min. and A. Urs. Min. transits of the star over the thread set at oa.o, oa.2, oa.4, oa.6, oa.8, Ia.o, to 3oa or in reverse order, were observed. The levels were read at the beginning of each revolution. The times of transit were corrected for changes of level, as follows: Correction = I= :± { n° + s., - n + s} 2 2

where n and s are the readings of the uorth and south ends of the level bubble,

n° + s a selected state of the level to which the observations are to be reduced, and

d is the value of one division of the level in seconds of arc.

The chronometer time of elongation was computed as follows:

where tc =cos

Except in notation, this is the formula given in the '' Anleitung '' above mentioned. Instead of dealing with the quantities z - z. in arc as set forth in the "Anleitnng," which would have involved a great deal of labor, the computation was arranged as stated below and the method of obtaining the progressive and periodic errors given in the "Anleitung" was practically carried out. By progressive errors is here meant the actual errors at any readings of the screw from the mean value of the screw, the word progressive referring to the progressive readings of the screw as 1", 2", etc., and not to a uniformly increasing or decreasing error for the whole screw. The progressive errors are deduced for the initial readings of each revolntion only, as 1", 2", etc., and are assumed to change uniform'ly between these readings. In the example given it will be noticed that such errors obtained from a single set of observations are largely affected by errors of observation and that a large number of sets are required to give a good determination of the progressive errors. This will be seen by comparing the results from the single set with the mean results of eighteen sets, in Table II. Both the progressive and periodic errors as deduced here are to be added to the micrometer readings, and with the micrometer readings so corrected the mean value of one revolution of the screw is to be used. The term

C is tabulated on page 7 of the '' Anleitung, ''

an~

also on page 366, Appendix No. 7 of Coast and Geodetic Survey Report 1897-<)8. This term was applied directly to the times of observation, plus before and minus after elongation, thus reducing the observed times of transits to what they would have been had the star moved in a straight line instead of a curve. (See Table I of the example given below.) The times thus reduced are affected by both the progressive and periodic errors of the screw. By taking the means of these reduced times corresponding to - 0"·4, - 0"·2, oR·o, + 0"·2, + 0"·4, for each revolution of the screw there was obtained a set of times corresponding to the micrometer readings 1", 2a, to 29", all free of periodic errors. (See Table II.) Let T be any of these times, and M the corresponding micrometer reading, and let T 0 be the mean of all the times, and M 0 or 15" the corresponding mean of all the micrometer readings and R. the mean value of one revolution of the screw in time seconds of the star, then for each of these times,

Substituting the value of R, in all the equations, and putting p for the residual or progressive errors, P= (T- TJ-(M-MJ R, or

p = ( T,, -

T) - (M - MJ R,.

The reduced times in Table I were now freed from the effect of the progressive errors by subtracting p from these times if the observations were made with increasing readings of the screw and by adding p to the times if the observations were made with decreasing readings of the screw, the values of p applied to the times corresponding to 1 1 0 "2, 0R·4, 0 "6, on·3 being interpolated. By taking the successive differences of the times, freed from progressive errors, corresponding to micrometer readings on·o - d·2, o'"2 - on·4, on·4 - oR·6, a1"6 - oa·s, o'"8 - oR·o, for the 30 revolutions, Table III was formed, from which the periodic error was computed by the method given by Prof. T. W. Wright, ill his treatise on the" Adjustment of Observations," article 194· The progressive and periodic errors in time seconds of the star were reduced to terms of R by simply dividing by the value of R,. Finally, the mean value of one revolution of the screw in arc is,

R = R, 15 cos.o - corr. for refraction-\- corr. for rate.
The values of R, and p from the times in Table II may be cmnputed by the method of least squares, as follows: Let R, be an assumed value of one revolution of the micrometer screw in time seconds of the star, and put R. = R, then,
