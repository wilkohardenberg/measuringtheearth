DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Washington, October 5, 19'26. Sm : There is submitted herewith my twelfth annual report. This report is for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1926, and is the ninetyfifth annual report of this bureau.
INTRODUCTION

The Coast and Geodetic Survey has just closed the one hundred and tenth year of its active existence. It has been a year which has seen the bureau render the public a service greater in volume and variety than ever before and in that respect it has been a successful one. To this record of service I will revert later. It has also seen the growth, to seriously disturbing proportions, of certain problem::; vital to the welfare of the service: problems which have been visioned in the distance and commented on in l?revious reports, but which now loom so large, that their serious consideration must not longer be deferred. Briefly, the Coast and Geodetic Survey as the sole manufacturer of a product indispensable to certain important aspects o:f our industrial and commercial li:fe is a sort of barometer of the Nation's prosperity. When harvests are abundant, when our factories are woFking full time, there is a noticeable increase in the foreign and domestic shipping by which those products are carried to the markets of the world, with a corresponding increase in the demand for the charts which are the sole guide of shipping through the navigable tidal waters of the United States and its possessions and dependencies. When the country is prosperous and money is plentiful many thousands o:f the people o:f our coastwise .States turn to the sea for recreation. Yachts and motor boats throng our popular coast resorts _and pl~, our exte~sive natural inland waterways, and these craft, ·hke their larger sisters of the merchant marine, must liave the charts to keep them to the security o:f the navigable <foumeb. The growth. in the demand for charts for this purpose has been most impressiYe; whereas only a few years ago that demand was negligible, it now, in a prosperous year, probably exceeds the total number of charts sold a decade or two ago.
l

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

Finally, these prosperous conditions are reflected in an accelerated development of our many ports. Increased shipping demands additional terminal facilities. Docks are remodeled to larger proportions or new ones built. Artificial channels are deepened and widened. Aids to navigatifJn multiply. Ports :formerly in:\ctive reach ont for their share of the golden flood, and through concerted action under the guidance of their port commissions undertake impressive harbor developments to _enable them to compete snccesfifnlly with their neighbors for a share of the business. All these changes must be shown on the chart before it can be trusted to guide the mariner, and in consequence a period of national prosperity brings a great increase in the volume of work required of the Coast and Geodetic SmTey, an increase resulting not only from the demand for more charts hut even more from the necessity that every chart printed shall be modern and up to date with respect to the area portrayed. This Nation is at present enjoying such a perio<l of augmented industrial activity which, with some minor fluctnations, has prevailed since 1919. These years have imposed a great and constantly increasing burden upon the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The bureau has met that burden willingly and cheerfully; has, indeed, welcomed it, for the spirit of service, of doing difficult tasks well, which has dominated the service for the century and more of its existence, was never stronger than to-day. To give its best, to make one dollar do the work of two, has become traditional and ·is accepted as a matter too commonplace to justify comment. Therefore the Coast and Geodetic Survey has no complaint to offer. On the contrary, it has welcomed the increased obligations crowding in upon it from m.any directions because, although each separately adds its q~ota to a burden already heavy, in the aggregate they are symbohc of a national well-bemg to which the survey is glad to contribute the best efl'ort of which it is capable. That contribution is not complete, however, until the bureau, having first done everything within its own power to meet the situation, thereafter 1,)0ints out any remaining deficiencies which can be r6medied only with outside assistance. Such deficiencies, and serious ones, exist .at the present time. There is a limit to the size of the gar'mem which can be cut from any given piece of cloth. In spite of its best efforts, of increased efficiency in many different directions, the survey to-day is unable adequately to perform the functions with which it is charged under the law. I regard, therefore, as the most important and constructive part of this report, the duty of pointing out the respects in which we are inadequate and of suggesting appropriate remedies to the final authorities who alone can make them available. In so doing I wish to emphasize that I am not reaching out to grasp any new functions. Every dollar requested is to enable us to <lo the things which we are now lawfully required to do.
INCHEASED CHAUT PRODUCTION IMPERATIVE

The chart is the principal product of the bureau's efforts. About
80 per cent of our expenditures are of no benefit to the public unless

form. Unless our chart production is kept on an efficient basis we fail in our most important function. Recent years have seen an outstanding increase in the demand :from shipi)ing interests tor our charts. The i~crea~e for. 1926 over H>25 was 29 per cent. l! or these reasons our situat10n with respect to chart production demands and receives constant scrutiny. Briefly that situation is as follows: At present we have more or less modern charts of all navigable waters of the United States and its dependencies. Not all of these charts are w~at we wo\lld have them. Judged by modern st~ndards some are s~nously deficient., but except for some remote port10ns of our possess10ns, or an occas10nal inlet of exceptionally rapid change, we do at present furnish the navigator with charts which will assist him in traversing any of the waters under our jurisdiction. When a new chart has been issued our problem· with reference to the locality charted has only begun. Natural and artificial changes are in constant progress 1n the area, and the mariner must be kept informed of all such changes· if we are to insure that he may sail those waters with safety. This means that the chart must be constantly corrected. To accomplish this we print small editions of the charts so that they are reprmted frequently, and before each reprinting the plate is corrected to show new information received since the date of .the last preceding print. Until recently charts of important harbors were printed as often as five to six times a year, and the average frequency of reprinting of all charts has been a little more than twice a year. When the time arrives to produce. a new chart or to make an extensive reconstruction of an existing one, we can not simply abandon the old product and start work on the new. It is a time-consui;ning job to produce a new chart, requiring on the .average about a year of elapsed time. During that period we must continue to supply the mariner with charts of the area. This means that, pending completion of· the job, the existing charts of the same locality must be kept in stock and kept corrected just as though the new product were not under way, In actual practice, therefore, the· time of our. chart force is devoted primarily to the correction of existing charts, and only such time as remains from this task can be devoted to the production of new charts or the extensive reconstruction of existing ones. The data used for the production and correction of charts originate from sources both within and without the survey. Our own field partie~ are at work i~ all parts of ~mr territory securing information for this purpose. Smee the war, m order to try to meet the public demand for charts, there has been some expansion in the field force which has increased its effectiveness. There has been a correspond~ ing increase in some facilities and equipment. Small, obsolete vessels have been replaced by larger, modern ones. These a;uamented personnel and facilities have resulted in a considerable in~ease in the amount of work turned in by the field parties. There has been an even greater increase in the amount of data received from sources o~tside the ~urvey. Such sources have long been important contrib~t?rs o~ mfor~ation. There are many agencies, Federal, State, mumcipal, and private, at work along our coasts, improving our

4

harbors and their approaches, dredging channels and basins, building docks, and establishing terminals. All these changes must be shown on the charts. To obtain the necessary information without sending its own field parties to make special surveys, this bureau has bmlt up contacts with every possible agency engaged on work of this character, and so large is the total volume of data thus obtained. t~at it is conservatiye to estima~e ~hat doubl~ our existing appropriat10n would be reqmred to obtam ·it by special surveys of our own. At the close of the war we got away to a flying start on the task of making up the existing arrears in our chart work, and in the years immediately following made very considerable progress. Gradually, however, the volume of incoming data has been increasing until at present it threatens to swamp us. The volume of data received in 1925 represented an increase of 245 per cent over the amount received in 1919. There has been no corresponding increase in personnel to enable the office to cope with this constantly growing volume of incoming material. On the contrary, there has been an aetual decrease. In 1920 the chart division had 102 authorized places; at present it has 101. The bureau has exerted every effort to cope with this situation by increasing its productive capacity, and some noteworthy achievements along this line have been accomplished in recent years. To illustrate their cumulative effect by a typical example, the average elapsed time required to produce all new charts completed in 1920 was 27 months; for 1926 it was 811:3 months. The average cost of producing the new charts completed in 1920 was $1,771; for 1926 it Wl!-S $1,395, in spite of a 40 per cent increase in salaries as the result of reclassification. In spite of these internal accomplishments, however, there has been a contmued decrease in the amount of time which can be devoted to the production of urgently needed new charts. The following tabulation shows the percentages of the total time devoted to the production of new charts and the correction of existing charts, respectively. The falling off in the time devoted to production of new charts is indicative of an equivalent reduction in the volume of other necessary constructive work which should have been maintained at the higher level of the earlier period.

The resulting situation is serious in many respects. We are compelled to make regrettable concessions in the quality of our service to the public. It means much more than simply that we are not getting out new charts as rapidly as we should. The guality of existing charts is also deteriorating. ·we are to-day printmg charts

from plates so worn from long service that in some cases the pdnts are almost illegible. 'Ye .have within the past ye~r reduced the frequency of chart repr~n!mg by about 33 per ~ent m order to cut overhead labor costs. 'Ih1s means that the mariner must use for a correspond'ingly. l<?nger period charts '~hich sh~uld be super~eded by others contammg more up-to-date mformation. Parts .of the information received can not be used at all because of the time required to apply them to the charts. In rejecting this material the greatest possible care is exercised to eliminate the _le~st. essen~ial. Nevertheless the .practice is a dangerous one because it is 11nposs1ble to foresee some unusual combination of circumstances, such as the omission of some seemingly unimp~n·taut item, ~hat migh~ result in delay and inconvenience to the marmer and possibly even m tl1e loss of lives and property. The chart is the mariner's principal safeguard. It should be at all times a true picture of the area covered, tmd to the extent that it :falls short of that ideal it places the mariner in jeopardy. The only effective solution of this situation is additional personnel. No large increase is expected or required. The increase prcposecl is three cartographic engineers an<l three lithographic draftsmen at total annual salaries of $13~320.
WHA1.' l\IODimN TNSTlffMBN'l'S l\U~AN TO 'I'HB BUREAU'S WORR

The progress of this bm·eau in the execution of its work is vitally tl:ffected by the character of its instrumental equipment. No matter how skilled the observer, his ra"lults can be no better than the instrument with which he makes his observations. We have found by long experience that our work can be done better, quicker, an~ cheaper almost in proportion as we keep abreast o:f scientific research in metallurgy, electricity, optics, etc., and appropriate to our use such advances as will be of benefit. Study is constantly being made to increase the accuracy of our instruments and to decrease their size and weight. Our present-day theodolites are only about half the size of those used only a yef.!,rs ago, and weigh only about three-fifths as much, while in accuracy they are far superior. Decreased size and weight mean lQwer transportation charges and particularly greater ease in reaching the mountain tops or other remote points where the observations must be made. It makes a very great difference whether an instru. ment weighs 60 or 100 pounds, when it must be packed on a man's back for miles over rough mountain tracts or through Philippine or Alaskan jungles. Increased precision means that fewer observations need be ma~e at each station to insure the required accuracy of the results, and m consequence that more work can be accomplished for a given expenditure. Many instances might be cited of the increased efficiency resulting - from better instruments. · One of the first eiosentials to our work is the determination of longitudes. This requires a very accurate lmowled~e of the time. By the. old method, when no telegraph line was available, time was ~etermmed by carrying several chronometers repeatedly back and foryh· b~tween the -point o:f observation and the nearest point at wluch time and longitude were accurately known. Frequently this

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

distance was hundreds 0£ miles, and as the chronometers must not be subjected to the slightest shock in transit, their transportation was a laborious and expensive undertaking, in which a seemingly minor accident might result in weeks of delay and perhaps necessitate · abandoning the work until another season. To-day, as a result of our adoption of the ra(lio,. and our development of certain automatic recording apparatus, exact time is obtainable daily in any part of the continent from the Annapolis Radio Station. Instances might be multiplied of instruments de:.igned and reconstructed in our own shop, by which we do more and· better work at less cost. Such instruments will measure the angular position of a point on the earth's surface within 1 second of arc, which means that a point 40 miles distant can be located within the space of 1 foot; will determine the difference in elevation between two points 100 miles apart within % of an inch; or will measure time to the one·millionth part of a second. Our tide-predicting machine does the work of 60 mathematicians with an infallible accuracv of which no human being is capable. ., · The work of our instrnment division falls under two heads: (1) The original procurement of qur instruments and apparatus and (2) their subsequent repair and upkeep. Whenever a standard commercial type of instrument can be used in our work it is purchased in the market. In fact, the great majority of our instruments are procured in this way. But when the highly specialized work with which we are charged demands the creation of something radically different in design and construction1 we find it very difficult and costly to find any commercial source of supply. The business of the instrument manufacturers, particularly in th!s country, is based on the idea of quantity production of standard types. The firms naturally are reluctant to undertake the manufacture of a new and radically different instrument, largely experimental in character and of which but a single one may be required. Special tools are needed; special patterns, dies, and jigs must be made. Their workmen, although doubtless skilled in the standardized production with which they are familiar, have not the versatility to enable them to proceed readily to the production of something d.i:fferent. All these factors add greatly to the overhead cost, which must be charged against one instrument instead of being distributed among many. Finally~ the inflexibility o:f Government procedure; the fact that the manufacturer must subscribe to a binding contract in which he assumes all the risk tends, particularly in a matter so essentially experimental in character, further to increase the cost. Since he is ventul'ing into imper:fectly lmown territory, when the Government is protected at his expense, it is natural that i:f he bids on the job at all he will quote a figure high enough to cover every possible contingency. Consequently it has been our experience that such special instruments and apparatus cost very much more if procured by contract than if built in our own shop. Probably 50 per cent is a reasonable estimate of the avetage excess. In many cases· it is much greater. For example, during the present fiscal year the lowest quotation re-

ceived :for certain field apparatu.s used in sonic so1:1nding wrus $4,000 and a six months' time :for delivery. As the price. as~ed and the time were considered excessive 1 the apparat~s was bml~ m our shops at one-third the cost and in less than one-third of the time; however1 other important work in this shop had to be delayed on account ot t,his work which was more urgent. . . In short, the years have taught us that almost. without exc.ept1.on the prices quoted by manufacturers :for producmg the special m-' struments indispensable to our work are in fact, although not necessarily by intention, exorbitant and in many cases prohibitive. ?.'l.1ere is not the slightest doubt that each year large sums could be utilized for more productive purposes if we were authorized to employ three or :four additional trained instrument makers. We already have the shop, fully equipped with expensive machines of the finest type, but not sufficient personnel to oper·ate them all to capacity. The question naturally arises as to why our present force can not do the work. The answer is that they are already overtaxed by the task of kee:ping existing instruments in repair. That task must be given prionty. ,Just as, in the case of the chart, we must continue to correct the old one until we a1'e ready to issue the new, so, also~ must we keep our present instruments at work until such time as theY. must be replaced. We can not afford to hold a field party idle while we are designing and building newer and better instruments :for it to work with. Our present force can not even keep existing instruments in repair. There has been a rapid increase in the bureau's activities in the last few years. We now have many more field parties than we had Hl years ago, and there has been a proportional increase in the number of instruments and other items of equipment. These instruments necessarily receive very hard usage in the field and require frequent repair and adjustment. This work, in so far as :riossible, is done by our instrument makers, and while the work required of them has !ncr~ased very greatly during the past decade there has been no mc.rease in their number during that period. In consequence, some of .these instruments are now regularly sent to the manufacturers for repair. Done in this way, the work itself not only costs more, but there is the further cost of transportation to and from the :factory. It is difficult to imagine a less economical and less businesslike procedure. I strongly urge that the provision of three additional places in the instrument division, at a total annual cost of $5,400, will be productive of, savings quite in excess of their cost.
ADDITIONAJ, COJ\11\USSIONED OFi"ICERS CONDUCIVE TO ECONOMY ·

The present authorized commissioned personnel of the bureau is 141 offi~ers. Thes~ o~cers direct the field work and perform the m<;ire d1~cult and mtncate par~s of the same,, command the survey ships, disburse the funds provided for carrymg on the work, and fill the major administrative J?Ositions in the Washington office. They are the nucleus about winch the entire structure of our field operations is built. This present complement is based on our requirements at the close of the war when we needed only 141 o:fJWers to utilize effectively the

8

HEPORT OF THE DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

facilities available to us and to get the most possible out of the funds appropriated. Since the war, however, conditions have changed radically. The demand for surveys has greatly increased. Five large modern seagoing ships have replaced an equal number of much smaller, obsolete craft. The new ships are more expensive to maintain and operate than were their predecessors, but in return, if properly utilized, are productive of so much greater accomplishments as to keep the unit cost of the work as low or lower than it was in 1917. This effectiYe utilization is not possible, however, because we lack the officers needed to provide proper complements. Ships which should be operating five or six surveying parties are actually operatin~ three or four, and in consequence the retums they giYe for the h(l'avy expenditures made are only about two-thirds of ·what they should be. In order to get the most out of our present equipment we should have a commissioned personnel of 151 officers. The most significant part of the story remains to be told. Although 141 officers are authorized, at no time since the enactment of the Budget law have sufficient funds been appropriated to pay that number. The largest number we have heretofore been able to appoint without danger of incurring a deficit has been about 130. Appropriation. of funds to pay the 10 additional required for effective operation would result in returns of value far exceeding their cost. ·
MATTERS AFFEC1'ING CIVIL-SERVICE PERSONNEL

The classification act was passed in 1923. The act provided for the allocation of employees to grades in the several services on the basis of duties performed and, in general, provided seven salary ranges to each grade, to which employees were to become entitled by promotion based on efficiency in the performance of their duties. A later enactment imposed the limitat10n that promotions should not exceed the point where the total of the salaries paid the employees of any grade exceeded the average salary of that grade multiplied by the number of persons in the grade. No time limit was formally set for the attainment of this maximum, but in the debate incident to the passage of the bill the impres,;;ion seems to have been that it would be reached in about four years. That period has now elapsed and finds that goal still beyond our reach. With a few exceptions our people were initially allocated to the minimum salaries of their several grades. Not a single one has yet been promote~ up to the average salary of his grade. Fifteen per cent of our force have attained to the third salary rate 36 per cent to the second, while 49 per cent have not received ~ny promotion during the three years that the law has been in operation. We may ihrnore but can not fail to observe the fact, which is obvious in other bureaus as well as in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, that the employees almost without exception feel that a great injustice has been done them in thus retarding the promotions to which their efficiency ratings entitle them, and that the disconraO'ement they feel has a seriously detrimental effect upon their work."' Hope constantly deferred is more demoralizing than a clisappointinO' certainty. It is therefore greatly to be desired either that the p~esent

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR COAS'.r AND GEODETIC SURVEY

act be so modified as to give the effect of law to the policy which at present determines the sums to be .made a"Y3;ilable for the payment of salaries, or else that the financial condition. o~ the Gove~'lm1ent will speedily permit o:f more generous approprrnti~ns by which the plan embodied in the present law may become '.l- rea~ity .. The seiTices O'enemlly have cause for grat1ficat10n m the recent liberalizing of the retirement law. This forward ste,P in a. matter of such import to the great body o:f Fed~ral workers is keenly appr~ ciated, and I speak for every member of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in expressing my thanks to the Members o:f Congress "·ho contended so persistently for its enactment. \<Ve must not for«et, however, that the recent enactment was frn;nkly a compromi~e, and that we. still have some distance t<~ g_o before we arrive at an equitable retirement system. The age hm1t is still too hio-h. We do not yet have the proper relation between the annuity ~nd the active-duty pay. The employee who earns S4,000 a year contributes twice as much to the retirement fund as does the one who teceives $2,000. Both,. however, assuming equal length of service, receive the same annuity; an arrangement which unduly burdens the higher salaried employee. The bureau chief, who is constantly studying the problem' of huildin« up and maintaining the most efficient J?Ossible working force, i~ brought in~o con.tact with aspects of thi~ subject whi~h deserve careful cons1derat10n. He sees the excessl\'e turnover m the Government personnel, chiefly in the highly specialized professional and technical positions, for which each new incumbent must undergo a considerable period of training. He sees the extravagance and wastefulness of a system which, by its unattractfreness, virtually forces so many of these people out o:f the service as soon as they have completed this unproductive training period. He knows o:f no valid reason why the Federal service should be a training school for certain o:f the technical private industries. He has seen many employees continued on duty after they have reached the age of i·etirement, although their capacity :for service was manifestly impaired, ana knows that one of the reasons for that retention was that administrative officers could not bring themselves to force retirement on an ~n~uity manifestly inadequate to sustain life at the present cost of hvmg. The new law has improved but by no means adequatelv remedied that condition in all cases. Seeing these things, he is convinced that tru~ economy lies in a more liberal policy with respect to matters of _this character; that what is apparently a direct savino· _of one dollar is sometimes in :fact the indirect waste o:f two. e

ings. Such conditions result in difficulty of coordinating successive processes and in delay in the orderly progress of work. Work demanding a high degree of mechanical precision, such as our drafting, engraving, or· instrument work, requii:es the best of light, yet our buildings are so crowded that some of the employees engaged on rnch work have no direct access to natural light. The buildings, with one exception, are old and in poor condition and :for years have required expensive expenditures for upkeep and repairs. Occupancy of new modern quarters, therefore, will result in more and better service to the public, as well as relieve some of our personnel from unnecessary present burdens.
HELPING TI-IE PUBLIC

The campaign .to increase the usefulness of the bureau to the public has been continue<l. To make this effective has callC'd for more than an idle declaration of policy. It has necessitated wholeFome stimulation of all members of the bureau as an organization to let no opportunity pass to increase the usefulness· of the bnreau and to render the utmost service. These efforts are bearing fruit. Its tan~ible evidence is :found in the numerous commendatory letters Teceived by the bureau, typical portions of some of which are quoted below.
Let me first of all thank you for the most civil and altogether satisfactory Jetter I have received from a governmental department in a number of years. The coast in which I am interested lies between Guys Point and Fishermans Island. 'l'he imm<'diate locality is known locally as Picketts Harbor. If this is shown on your i:mrvey and Picketts Hole is located, that point, together with a mile each way. will suffice, and I am pleased to add that the embankment during the years 1904-5 is precisely what I wish to know; from this I can, as you state. hnve Rurveys that will disclose whatever there is of encroachment since the 1905 survey. Repeating my thanks for your very courteous attention and hoping to lu~ar from you at an early date, I am,---. · I recently had occasion to obtain a copy of an old map, aH to the source of i<Upply of which I had been erroneously informed. I therefore addressed an inquiry to a certain bureau of the Government and waited 10 days for a reply. I then receiYed a form letter tell'ing me that my inquiry had been referrerl to the Coast and Geodetic Survey. And on the same day, or possibly the next, I received a letter from the Assistant Director giving me, very courteously, the information for which I had asked. 'l'his is no doubt a small matter, but having had considerable experience with Government bureaus and of the frequency with which retarded or inadequate answerR are received from them, I take this occasion to compliment yon upon thiR unimportant example of courtesy and dispatch. In inclosiug my check for $2 to cover the balance due on charts you have forwarded, please permit me to express my appreciation for a procedure which I wish to commend very heartily and which is only too rare amongst other departments of the Federal Service, to wit, prompt, bnslnPRSlike service with a minimum of red tape.
It is always a delight to receive such a hearty ~ncl 'prompt reply, and such a practical one that leaves nothing more to be smd, as was covered by your ;.;ending me forthwith a copy of the canceled map of Penobscot Bay that I had requested. · The immediate action, the abi:ience of red tape, and um1ecessary ,time-consuming. correspondence all make for much appreciation of your human and practical interpretation of my request.

REPORT O.F THE DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODE'fiC SURVEY

11

Four or five years have passed since the inception o:f the bureau's plan to cooperate with local and county surveyors :for the purpose o:f placing at their disposal data accumu~ated ~y the bure~u and encouraging more accurate surveys. In tlus per10d cooperat10n has been extended to approximately 4,000 surveyors. ~Y' means of pri?ted digests, in which cou~ties are list~d alphll;beticall.y, the descriptions of Coast and Geodetic Survey tr1angulat10n statwns, magnetic stations, and precise level bench marks ha:ve been brought to the attention of surveyors throughout the :followmg 27 States: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, .Indiana, I~linois 1 Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, l\~mnesota, Missoun, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oluo, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming. T~e illustration. opposite is a graphic representation of the work o:f this bureau in the State o:f Ohio. Digests for the other States of the Union will be prepared as soon as possible. Through the use of the standard control points established by this bureau local surveys can be connected with the most accurate control syst~m in existence; thus elimination of all gaps, offsets, and overlaps such as constantly occur where local surveys uncontrolled by standard datums are extended until joined with other local surveys likewise uncontrolled by standard datum, sometimes causing costly lawsuits.
BENEFIT OF PIWV.IDING SBAGOIXG YJ,SSJ<:LS MODERNLY EQUIPPED

The work of certain ships during the past vear has again proved the great benefit of providing these stanch yessels properly equipped. For some years the bureau had been forced to use small vessels of low power. weakened by age. Areas are nO"\Y being covered by hydrography which for many years were inaccessible for the old ships whos(J operation was necessarily restricted to working grounds favorable to them. The methods for obtaining hydrographic information on these ships are now in advance of those used by all other vessels and are made possible by the fitting of modern equipment to seagoing vessels of the size and power which have been found most efficient for this work. . Many vessels traversing the sea lanes along our coast are now equipped with apparatus for quickly determining depths similar. to those used on the surveying ships and the extension of such apparatus to others is constantly being made in the realization that such equipment is a distinct advance in the prevention of strandings in thick weather. Dependence on soundings by these vessels for the determination of their position when other navigational aids 'a~ not a"\:ailable reguir~s the location of the geographic positions of the soundmgs by this bureau with an accuracy equal to that of the. location ?£ the aids. This lrns been accomplished by the radio acoustic rangmg method used on O}Ir larger surveying ships. Althoi1gh beyond the visibility of land these ships have been '\\Tithin· control of the hydrophone stations at all times. · · Of these modern survey vessels, special mention should be made of the Guide and Pioneer, which have already made successful use of the. late~t hydrographic equipment off the coasts of Oregon and California, and which are now engaged off the mouth of the Columbia River in a section of important traffic where thick weather is a frequent occurrence; the Surveyoi·, wnich has pushed the surveys

north of Cape Spencer, Alaska, to include the well-traveled approach to the inside passage from southwestern Alaska; the Discoverer, now well started on the charting of the waters of the Hawaiian Islands. Another vessel, although not in the class of the above, is the LJ!donw, which has recently been equipped to better accomplish the offshore hydrography of the southern Atlantic coast. Efforts must now be made to supplement the work of this vessel by the acquisition of a new ship for the extension of the surveys along this coast. This vessel will not require the power of those previously mentioned, but must be equally seaworthy and thoroughly equipped with modern ~urveying apparatus. A necessary adjunct in the accomplishment of the results mentioned has been the work of the personnel manning these vessels. The new equipinent has required extensive application in the perfection of the methods used. Difficult landings for the establishment of the shore stations have been successfully carried out, although the hazards have been great, without injury to the crew or loss of property. I am firmly convinced that the officers and men of these vessels have performed these most satisfactory accomplishments in the confidence inspired by the aid of modern equipment and seaworthy material.
SURVEYS FOR WAH AND NAVY DJ<]PAH'l'MEN'l'S

The wire-drng smTey of the Vieques Sound, P. R., was completed this year. This ;;urvey was begun in the summer of 1921, at the request of the Navy Department, for the protection of war vessels which congregate m this locality for the winter maneuvers. A hydrographic survey of the sound was made soon after the island was acquired by the United States, but the Navy Department desired that this survey be supplemented by a drag survey to guarantee that none of the small coral heads, with which these waters are infested, had been overlooked in the original hydrographic survey. Work has been prosecuted intermittently since 1921 and was completed this fiscal year. The survey of Malampaya Sound, Palawan Islands, P. I., which was begun· during the latter part of last fiscal year, was completed early this year. This survey was made in accordance with a request :from the commander in chief of the Asiatic Fleet for a confidential chart of the sound. In the Hawaiian Islands one survey party was employed throughout the year on special hydrographic surveys for the War Department. Accomplishment of this survey in the great detail desired by the military authorities is especially difficult, and progress is necessarily slow' because of prevailing heavy swells along the coast .. Several times the survey boat has capsized in the surf, but there has been no serious accident. The work is still in progress. A detailed hydrographic survey was made along the south coast of Oahu, Hawaiian Islands, as the basis of special largs-scale anchorage charts for the Navy Department. This work was begun and completed during the year. A special revision survey of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Wa~h., was made at the request of the Navy Department for a maneuvermg chart of this water. The work was begun last spring and was practically completed at the close of the fiscal year.

Part !.-OTHER IMPORTANT BUREAU NEEDS
CHAPTER I
SURVEYING NECESSARY FOR AERIAL MAPPING

The time has come in this country, as it has in many others, when accurate surveying and mapping are considered as absolute essentials ~or economic progress and the elimination of waste in industry and commerce. When land was cheap it was impracticable to incur the expenses incident to very accurate surveys, also when this country was largely agricultural in its pursuits surveys of a detailed and accurate nature were not justified. All this has changed. Our people are engaged in great industrial. and commercial wprk as well as in agriculture. These industrial operations require accurate lmowledge of the configuration of the ground as well as of elevations and geographic positions. Very valuable property must be accurately located and its boundaries permanently established and recorded. This is the situation in regard to industries and commerce; but we have another problem which is due to the development of the aerial navigation during the past two decades. The pilot of an airship must have a map. He is frequently out of !'light of land above the douds or in the fog or is traveling at night. He must be guided in his flight over the land much as the navigator of a ship is guided over the sea by charts and aids to navigation. The aviator who can not see the ground must depend upon the barometer~ but the barometer is set to give elevations above the sea and not of the actual land surface. He may think he is one, two, or some other number of thousands of feet above the earth when, as a matter of fact, he may be in imminent danger of colliding with a mountain slope or peak. Therefore, any aviation map between terminal points of an aerial route must show in some wa.y the elevation of the ground. The aviator needs to know the relative positions of topographic features along his route, such as railroads, highways, rivers, cities, villages, woods, and open country. These features should be shown in their correct shapes and in their correct positions. All of this information can be obtained from an accurate topographic map such as is made by the United States Geological Survey. . · Only about 40 per cent of the area of the United States ls now covered by maps o:f that character, and many o:f the areas covered will have to be resurveyed in order .to bring the maps up to date for changes which have occurred since the survey was made. Many parts of our country liave had rapid developments since they were first surveyed 30, 40, or· more years ago. There are very few' la;rge areas of the United States having continuous topographic maps. An index map, showing the quadrangles
13

14

REPORT 01!' THE DIR.ECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

which have been covered by the topographic maps of the United States, reminds one of a cross-word puzzle. This situation should be remedied, not only for the industrial and commercial uses of our people, but in order tliat route maps for airplanes may be accurately and expeditiously constructed. The Department of Commerce was recently charged by Congress with furthering the interests of civil aviation. A part of the duties involved will be the establishment o.f' aids to aviation and the construction of route maps which will enable the aviator to sail over his course without getting lost by lack of map information. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has for years been extending accurate triangulation and leveling over the interior of the country for surveying, mapping, and other engineering uses. "'With this triangulation the highway system and the railroad system of the country can be correlated and placed in at least approximately their right positions on maps. The elevations furnished by the survey can be used for furnishing mean sea-level datum for surveying, mapping, and engineering operations. The topographic map can not be accur-ately made if the fundamental control work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the form of leveling and triangulation has not been completed for the area that is to be mapped. It would be difilcu]t to prepare route maps for aviators with the data we now have. There will be many routes for which the maps will not be as good as they should be, but pending the completion of the topographic mapping they will be all that can be furnished. It seems that the time has arrived when we should realize that.the many uses to which tl:ie geodetic work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey can be put would require, in the interests of economy and efficiency and the elimination of waste in industry, that the geodetic work be expedited. It has been estimated that $4,000,000 would complete the primary work, ·even to the publication of the results. There would be furnished for this sum an elevation on mean sea level and the geographic position on the North American Datum within 25 miles of every place in the country; that is, the maximum distance between lines of le.veling and arcs of triangulation would be about 50 miles. · With a slight increase of the engineering personnel 0£ the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the fundamental control systems of the country could be completed within 10 years. It is urged that increased appropriations may be made for the triangulation and leveling. The money spent on this class of work is of lasting benefit and would result in almost 100 per cent dividend each year. After its completion the work would never have to be done over. Its accuracy is such as to meet the needs of all time, and it would only be necessary occasionally to replace a triangulation station or levelling bench mark where the old ones had been destroyed by the works of man or nature, and to make minor extensions of the system where intensified mapping may later be required.

CHAPTER II

WEED FOR A SEAGOING SHIP ON THE ATLANTIC COAST

..

. The bureau has available on the Atlantic coast only one ship that is seaworthy and able to operate on the open coast at any distance from a harbor of refuge. Within the lifetime of that one ship, working alone, the offshore and coastwise surveys needed to bring our charts up to date can not be accomplished. As only a seaworthy vessel can undertake the work, I would urgl' favorable consideration of the acquisition of a modern survey ship· of 600 tons now needed for this duty. This service requires a ship that ":ill operate economically at different speeds and where the fuel consumption while at anchor is reduced to a minimum. Fuel consumption is a large item in operating expenses, and the power installation should permit the ship to proceed to and from the working ground at full speed ; then, while taking soundings, to cruise efficiently at re<luced speed. 'Vhile at anchor, fuel consumption should cease. A Diesel installation admirably meets these conditions because of its multiple power units and the ~act that when not actually in operation there is no fuel consumpt10n. "\Ve now have on survey work two wooden ships restricted to sheltered waters or the coasts close to shelter, because they can not be made seaworthy. They are expensive to maintain on account of mounting expenditures for repairs and costly to operate, as they are no longer efficient units. One new vessel to replace these two ships would equal their combined production and would in a very reasonable period of time save the oriµ:inal l'OSt by reducing operating expenses.
NEED FOR TENDERS

For years there has been emphasized the need on the Pacific coast for seaworthy launches or tenders of approximately 60 feet in length to work in conjunction wHh the large ships and to do that work for which the ship is too large and too expensive and for which boats carried on th.e ship's davits are too small. The need is urgent' for three such tenders. · The two ships now surveying on the coasts of Washington and Oregon are operating with hired IU.nnches which are poorly suited to the work. There are many times and places. however, where it is impossible to hire a launch. Then it becomes necessary to carry on the work with the small boats while the ship stands by. · Although the cost of leasing launches is greater than to own and operate them, the consideration of unit cost of the work demands that this expensive J?ractice of leasing launches eontinue until necessary tender!'. are provided.
15

CHAPTER III
TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM AND SEISMOLOGY

As a result of sustained efforts through 26 years the first magnetic survey of the United States covers the entire country though the frequency of stations varies with the density of the population. The original aim was to have a station at each county seat and this has been fairly well accomplished. About 100 county seats remain to be occupied, principally in remote, sparsely settled localities, or as a result of the subdivision of large counties after the completion of the work in that region. Thirteen of these were occupied during the year. As soon as a magnetic survey is completed a number of causes begin to Jessen its value unless certain steps are taken. The causes include change in the magnetic field of the earth, civic improvements which may destroy the station mark or the objects used as reference marks, and the introduction of steel structures or electric-power lines near the station. The work necessary to maintain the usefulness of the stations includes the occupation of a definite number of repeat stations at five-year intervals and the operation of several magnetic observatories for determination of the changes in the earth's magnetism; the inspection of stations and correction of minor defects; and the complete replacement of statiom;. The present field magnetic work includes the items that have been mentioned and the occupation of new stations at county seats or elsewhere. The magnetic survey of Alaska is inadequate and additional stations should be occupied. The pressing need at present is for the occupl).tion of repeat stations along the main routes of travel. These have not been occupied for eight years, a longer interval than is considered safe. The results of these magnetic surveys are of great value in various ways. They are indispensable to local surveyors who have frequently to reestablish property boundaries located many years ago by means of the compass. So great is the interest and appreciation of these surveyors that within the past few years they have reported volun. tarily on the condition of more than half of the 3,700 marked stations thus far establish.eel. About 600 of the stations reported on need replacement. Observatory results also have been used during the year to standardize magnetic instruments used in the search for oil formations. They have also proved valuable in the investigation of peculiar radio reception difficulties last winter. In addition to observations in progress several years by the observer at Sitka, Alaska, the Cheltenham records are being studied by the Bureau of Standards, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Genera] Electric Co., Dr. "\V. Greenleaf Pickard, and others. The investigation still in progress seems to indicate a definite relation between transmission difficulties and the condition of the earth's magnetic field.

There is pressing need for additional office personnel to carry on this work. :Many of the important publ~cations are badly in arrears. New methods haYc been developed ·wluch greatly decrease cost of work, but there is Iiot enough personnel to put them in effect. There lrnR been no increase for more than 12 years. There is need for an additional field party to occupy repeat stations, and for repJacement of stations in the Middle Atlantic States, Middle estern States, and \Vestern Mountain States, irtcluding new stations in the latter region.

"r

SEISMOLOGY TO DATE

The past year, which was the first after enactment of legislation ant lwrizing st>ismological inYestigation by the Coast ancl Geodetic 8urvey, has been spent in appraising the situation and developing methods to meet the outstanding needs. Up to this year activity on 1 :Iw part of the Government was represented by the operation of Reismographs by the \Veather Bnreau and by this bureau incidental to magnetic work, and by the collection by the \Veather Bureau of reports of visible and felt earthquake effects. This work was good, but insufficient effort was made to completely utilize the results and make available the infoqnation obtained. Complete information is im essential step in development of. plans of pi·evention of' earthquake damage. . As a measure of the task during the first nine months of 1925, 470 earthquakes were felt or recorded by instruments in the United . States or outlying territories, not including local earthquakes in the Hawaiian and Philippine Islands. O:f these, 98 were felt within the ·continental United States and 6 of these were severe, shaking the New England States, New York, New .Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, "\Vyoming, Montana, Idaho, and California; in all, 21 States. The securing of adequate information in regard to all ·these earthquakes was quite a task, reports being received from the \Veather Bureau, State geologists, the press, and miscellaneous observers. There is need for more intensive information in some regions. The demand for s1ich information is strong but it has not· been possible to meet it. The preparation of this information in the form. of a catalogue is being undertaken for the first time in the United States. The contribution made by the magnetic observatories of this bureau is important though a number have obsolete types o:f seismographs. That at Tucson became useless and was i·eplaced by a modern seismograph. · Prevention of earthquake dumagP is the object of a numbe1' of organizations but all feel the need for the accomplishment of that part of the work which only the Government can do. The public is much interested and the requests for information alone are a heavy burden which can scarcely be handled nt the present time. There is need :for improved instruments, increased personnel at the observatories, and more detailed study, but the pressing need is for increased personnel in the office, to assme results of the desired precision published and made available~ For this purpose six additional office positions are required, nt u totnl annual cost o:f $13,100.

AND

Extending over a number of years numerous current observations have been made at various times scattered over the area comprising the main part of Chesapeake Bay. These observations should be. tied together by simultaneous observations over the area in the same manner as done in the comprehensive current surveys being made of all the important harbors along the coast and the work extended into the tributaries, in many of which practically no current observations have been made. . To bring out detailed knowledge of the general circulation in the ha.)" a comprehensive tide and current survey is absolutely necessary, and the cost o:f such surveys is small in comparison with the financial return to shipping and engineering- operations in the waterway. Beginning in 1922, such surveys have been made in New York, San Francisco, Delaware Bay, Puget Sound, and at present Boston and Portsmouth Harbors are being covered. For the coming year it is proposed to take up a comprehensive survey of Chesapeake Bay and tributaries. While these surveys of important harbors are of prunary value for the purposes of navigation, the data obtained is also of. great value to the civil and military engineers engaged in harbor improvements and marine construction of all kinds. In the matter of sewage disposal and sanitation the data from current and tide surveys are of vital importance to the United States Public Health Service for the determination of pollution of the waters of the various harbors and waterways of the country. In these matters this bureau is furnishing data wherever available. . During the past year, in connection with a sanitary survey of the Potomac River in the vicinity of Washington, the sanitary engineer of the United States Public Health Service requested the results of current observations in the vicinity, but no comprehensive survey had vet been made on the Potomac River by this bureau. This area will be included, of course, in the proposed survey for the whole of the bay. In time it is planned to extend these current surveys to every harbor of importance, so that the information may be at hand when needed; and it may be emphasized again that the data needed in these various lines of work are all derived from a single survey made primarily for purposes of navigation.

these data. An increase of three employees (computers, subptofessional), at a total cost of '$4,500, is now needed, and this will enable most of ·these demands to be met. Furthermore, with this increase of three subprofessional computers it will be possible to so arrange matters in the division of tides and currents as to remove some of the routine work from the mathematicians who ar~ in the professional grade and have this work done by the three subprofessional computers, which will result in a lower unit cost. In addition to the above, Congress has charged this bureau with the current surveys of the important harbors of the country which has entailed a considerable amount of increase in the work of the bureau with no increase in the personnel to get out the results from these surveys. These current surveys of the harbor's of the country and of narrow passes where current velocities are considerable have naturally resulted and will further result in a decrease in insurance risks on shipping.

CHAPTER I
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE WASHINGTON OFFICE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR

The organization of the 1'T ashington office of the bureau is presented by the organization chart opposite. The accomplishments during the fiscal year by divisions and sections follow.
CHIEF CJ,Eirn:

The principal duties of this· division are the care, custody, and upkeep of the buildings occupied by the bureau; the supervision of the expenditures for office expenses, including the purchase of supplies for the office, for chart-printing work, and to some extent for the field, the care of most of the original records of the field surveys, as well as the library of printed publications; the general supervision of all matters relating to the personnel work, including reports of leaves of absence; the custody and accounting for the receipts from the sale of charts, publications, etc.; and the direction of the engineer, electrician, watch, messenger, labor forces, and other employees engaged in the care, maintenance, and protection of the buildings occupied by the bureau in the District of Columbia. The more important accomplishments during the year haYe been a . continuation of the thorough renovation of the building;s. 1Yhile this work is still in progress, and it is a lengthy program with the small force of employees and funds available and the improvements and sanitation that are necessary, the present aecomplishments in the ~ay of painted rooms and modern fixtures offer a Yerv pleasing contrast when compared with conditions and equipment i)reviously existing. During the year the installation of all-metal storage racks, in 'vhich to place the copper plates from which are printed naviga. tion charts issued by the bureau, and racks for one storage room was completed. Cooperation with the division of terrestrial magnetism and l"~is mology in stimulating interest of county surveyors and civil L'ngineers in the inspection and maintenance of tlie magnetic statiuns already established by the bureau has continued throughout the year. In the library and archives 93 hydrographie and 72 topographic sheet8, each representing new surYeys made by the bureau. wel'fl received.

the expenditures for general expenses of the bureau, including credits to the appropriation, were $62,961.43. · . The total number. of pe_rma;nent and temp.or~ry emp!oyees m the office and field forces wluch mcludes. comm1ss10ned officers and all employees appointed through civil-service certification, is .office force, 209; field force, 198; total, 407. These fig.ures do not mclude t~e persons engaged as rodme~, chainmen, hel10tropers, and others m the field parties nor any enlisted men on vessels. . The statistics in reaard to leave of absence durmg the calendar year are annual leave~ 7,588 days; sick leave, 1,776 days; without-. pay leave, 431 days; and accrue4 leave, 2,392 days. W.hile ~he number of employees naturally vaned on accou~t of res1g1:1at10ns and vacancies calculated on the number actually m the service on June 30, 1926. 'as a basis of computation, the average annual leave taken during the year by each employee was approximately 18.64 days and sick leave 4.36 days. The receipts from the sale of charts and nautical publications preI?ared by the bureau amounted to $64,2~0.52, and the funds ·realized from the sale of old property, work done, and miscellaneous sources amounted to $1,646.88. The receipts :from the sale of charts and other nautical publications are in excess of those for any other fiscal year in the history of the bureau.
DIVISION OF HYDROGRAI'IIY AND TOPOGRAPHY

This division. is charged "'.ith the supervision of all hydrographic aD;d. topo.gra1~h1c sm:veys, with the preparation of coast pilots and sailmg d1rect10ns, with the construction and maintenance of yessels a~d surveying equipment, except instruments, and with the training of surveymg personnel. For convenience in the performance of these duties, the division is subdivided into four sections. each under a section chief, and the whole under a chief and an assistant chief of division. The section of field work makes careful studies of existing surveys, of the needs for additional surveys and resurveys, and prepares detailed instructions. for such work. From monthly progress reports and inspections of field parties the division, through this section, is ke~t informed of the progress of survey workitnd, by care· £nl examina~1011 of record books and su~vey sheets, the quality of the work bemg i~erformed by these parties. Although the surveys executed by parties under the supervision of this division are primarily hydrog~aphic and topographic, yet these parties undertake such tr~angulat10n,. base measurements, and field astronomy as may be reqmred to provide C?ntrol for the hydrography a:Q.d topography. Observations in terrestrial magnetism and of tides and currents are also made in conjunction with the other survey work so that the work of these parties is designated as combined operations. Through the section ?f vessels. and equ~pment the floating equipment and hydrograph1c surveymg appliances of the bureau are procured, inspe?ted, .and maintained in .effici~nt operating condition. Plans and specificat10ns are prepared m this office for new vessels and equipment and for repairs to the same.

REPORT OF THI~ DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

The coast-pilot section compiles, writes, and supervises the publication of coast pilots and inside-route pilots of the navigable coastal waters of the United States and its possessions. These publications are based on field examinations by officers of the section and upon information supplied by surveying parties of the bureau, by mariners, and others. In 80 far as it is possible to do so, all nautical in~ormation contained in these publications is verified by hydrographers of the bureau. The training section, which is now being organized, will give instruction in hydrographic engineering, sea'J.nanship, and navigation to junior officers and special advanced courses of instruction to Renior officers. Heretofore new officers who were appointed from among the graduates of engineering schools have received their education in hydrographic engineering, seamanship, and navigation through study and experience while serving as junior officers on ::mrvey ships of the bureau. Facilities for teaching are not of the best on these ships, as the entire efforts of the party must be directed toward the rapid completion qf the surveys because of the usual urgent · demand for the data for chart construction. Development of new officers to a point where they can take an important part in survey work can be effected more quickly ·and economically by putting them first through an intensive course of instruction in the office and on a small vessel e'.mployed entirely for that purpose. Instruction of senior officers will be accomplished by study of field records, treatises on the subject, and operation of new appliances under the direction of experts. During the past fiscal year new programs have been prepared for surveying and resurveying parts of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States and for completing the surveys of the Hawaiian Archipelago and the American West Indies. A new type of hydrographic power boat for use in very shallow water was designed and is now under construction. New and improved apparatus for radio acoustic sound ranging was designed and is now under construction in the bureau instrument shop. In cooperation with the Submarine· Signal Corporation, extensive tests have been made of the echo sounding apparatus known as the fathometer which have resulted in important unproyements of this apparatus. Experiments have been made for the purpose of devising a simple and inexpensive hydrometer suitable for use on shipboard in measuring the density of sea water with sufficient precision for echo sounding and subaqueous sound ranging. One set of instruments· has been produced that gives results nearly good enough for this pnrpose, and it is believed that with slight modifications it will prove satisfactory. . During the year new editions of the Gulf Coast Pilot; of Part I, Alaska Coast Pilot; and of the Inside Route Pilot, Key West to the Rio Grande were issued. Manuscripts were prepared and sent to the printer for new editions of the California, Oregon, and Washington Coast Pilot; of the Atlantic Coast Pilot from Cape Cod to Sandy Hook; of Alaska Coast Pilot, Part II; and of the Inside Route Pilot, Coast of New Jersey. Annual supplements were published for ·all the other coast pilots. A special publication on the construction and operation of the wire drag and sweep and a new edition of the uniform regulations were also compiled and published.

DIVISION OF CHAU'l'S

The total issue and condemnation of charts at '\Vashin«ton and Manila was 232,286 as compared with 230,535 :for the !~receding year. As the Navy Department used about 24,000 less Coast and Geodetic Survey charts than in 1925, these figures represent an increase o:f nearly 30 per cent in purchases by the general public. For the first time sales exceeded free issue plns condemnation, sales beinµ- 57.1 per cent o:f the total issue. In the preceding report comment was made upon the popularity of the series o:f inside route strip charts, Norfolk to Kev Wesi. The issne :for 1925 was 4,404, which was considered excellent.' How-

ever, the issue :for 1926 was 7,888, an increase o:f over 79 per cent. This should be considered a convincing argument :for completing the series. Even i:f it is necessary to omit the Chesapeake Bay section, a strip chart should be issued showing the route :from the head o:f the bay to New York City. The division now has on hand approved schemes :for 27 new charts, including those remaining unfinished at the end o:f the year. O:f these, 11 have been taken up and 16 are awaiting available personnel. It is hoped to complete half o:f the charts on hand, as well as those carried over :from last year :for reconstruction or simplification.

Mar;netic worlc.-The accomplishment o:f this division has been measvred by the :fact that there has been no increase in permanent office personnel for more than 12 years. During the past year not even the two temporary junior mathematicians who have been attached to the division :for the past several years were available. Some of the work was practically stopped, but service to the public wai;; given first consideration. Information service to local surveyors continued to meet the urgent demand, an<l as a result 0£ such actiYity 3,000 local surveyors have benefited by obtaining information available only :from this bureau. There has been a special demand for magnetic-observatory information. Durin~ the winter there w·as a period o:f several montli:; of abnormally Dad radio reception. This appears to have been in some manner related to the conditions of the earth's magnetism, and there has been a strong demand for magnetic information from investigators in the Bureau o:f Standards, Department o:f Terrestrial Magnetism o:f the Carnegie Institution o:f Washington, the General Electric Co., the American Telephone & Telegraph Co., and :from Dr. Greenleaf '"· Pickard, o:f the ·wireless Specialty Apparatus Co. o:f Boston. The information included in some cases immediate report 0£ magnetic storms in progress, and in one case the Carnegie Institution of ashington arranged :for special solar observations at the Mount "Tilson Solar Observatory while the storm was in progress. Magnetic-observatory results were furnished to several companies and individuals endeavoring to locate oil fields in Texas by mag1wtic methods. These investigators also made use of the magnetic field stations of the bureau and reported on the condition 0£ these stationf:i. Magnetic declination tables have been prepared for the w·odd Almanac. ,. Information ·was furnished the Department of Terrestrial ::\fagnetism 0£ the Carnegie Institution 0£ Washington. Very little progress has been made in the preparation of obserrntory results on account 0£ lack of personnel. Of the volumes for Hl23 and 1924 that :for Cheltenham, Md., is partly completed, but the o_thers have not been started. This is the most unsatisfactory conclit10n for many years. It could be in a large measure remedied by the addition of two junior mathematicians to the permanent :force.

An important aclrnnce has been made in the development of the method of direct scaling of the magnetic elements at the observatories, which is being put into effect. This substitutes for the present method of sealing another method which requires scarcely more time but which gives final or nearly final values, thereby eliminating three office operations which require a large amount of tedious computing. This will become entirely effective when certain instrumental improvements have been completed. Excellent progress has been made by the instrument division during the year in improving field and observatory instruments. Members of the division have taken part in the activities of the American Geophysical Union and the International Geodetic and GeHphvsical Union, and have held seYeral offices in these organizations. · Since the work of the bureau bears a definite relation to national and international activities in the same subjects, close contact with those interested in the work is important to avoid overlapping or omissions of important functions. · Several officers of the Chinese Navy received advice and instruction in the use of the magnetic methods of this bureau. An isogonic map of the Philippine Islands for January 1, 1925, has been prepared. A~1 isogomc map of the Uni_ted States for January 1, 1925, has bern prepared by a somewhat different method than heretofore. All thl' magnetic stations in the United States and some in Canada and Mexico were plotted on a base map of the largest size that could ·be prt>pared on a si~gle _Plate .. ~~e position of each station .is shown by a 1'mal1 letter wluch is the nutrnl of the name of the stat10n. Copies <if the base map haYe been printed and used in the preparation of t.h2 isogonic map. The advantage of this method is that replotting of the. position of stations is not necessary. · The following publications were issued during the year :
Results of Observations Made by the Bureau in 1924. Magnetic Declination in Missouri, 1925. Compass Surveys. (This publication was revised.)

The following publication was m the hands of the printc>r at the drn'e of the fiscal year:
Rt>sults of Observations for 1925.

The following publications ·were in preparation :
Observatory Results for Magnetic Declination in Magnetic Declination in MagnPtic Declination in Cheltenham, Md .. 1923-24. California and Nevada. Texas. the United States for 1925.

· The chief clerk's campaign to get in touch with local surveyors was -extended to Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Colorado, and the New England States. This leaves six States which have not yet been reached, but all necessary preliminary work has been done' for these, and a new method of p'reparing descriptions of stations which results in considerable economy in time and labor has been devised. 8eiwrnology.-The transfer of seismological investigations to this bureau coincided with a: period of unusual earthquake activity. This ·c-ansed the public to dpmand service which could not be given in the

26

absence of funds. It was possible, however, to meet the demand in part, because seismological work had been carried on as an adjunct to magnetic work for many years. The Weather Bureau has adopted a form of report similar to that prepared for this bureau and has renewed its activity in reporting visible and felt effective earthquakes. About three-fourths of the State geologists are also furnishiug such reports. There is demand for a still more intensive reporting system in regions of nonearthquake activity, which will be made as soon as personnel becomes arnilable. A series of publications to continue the reports of the "\Vcather Bureau was started, to be issued quarterly instead of monthly. The reports include the instrumental records at our own and other. cooperating stations, but excludes those who publish their own results. It also includes reports of visible and felt earthquake effects throughout the country, and tables in which this information is analyzed, so as to be in readily available form, a summary being given both by date and by region, with the preliminary determination of earthquake epicenters during the period. The reports for the first two quarters of 1925 have been issued and that for the third quarter is readv for the printer: · · A considerable amount of work has been done in systematiJ1ing the methods of handling earthquake information. Preliminary determinations of the principal earthquakes are made without delay as the results of reports received from the stations of the bureau and cooperating stat10ns~· During· the yea1· there· has· been a very considerable demand for information, which has been met as far as practicable. There has been cooperation with Canada, especially the D01hinion Observatory at Ottawa, with the Seismological Society of America, the National Board of Fire Underwriters, and various individuals. It is desired to express appreciation of the fine cooperation received from all these organizations and :from individuals who have made reports of earthquake activity.
DJVIRION 01·' '!'ID.ES AND CUURENTS

The work of the division of tides and currents is comprised under the following sections: Field work, reduct.ions, datum planes, and predictions. The routine work of all sections is practically up to date. The personnel of this division should be increased by three computers of subprofessional grade in order to relieve the full mathematicians from the greater part of this routine work and to assign them to the more important duties which nre in keeping with their experience, and which should be taken up. · Tide observations were made at nine primary tide stations on the Atlantic coast,· four on the Gulf coast, six on the Pacific coast, tln'ee in Alaska, and one at Honolulu, Hawaii. In order to relieve the burden of routine work in this office every effort is now made when appointing tide observers, who are parttime employees, to obtain the services of men of such intelligence that the tabulations of the marigraph curves can be made at the .tide

station and forwarded to this office for the final i'eductions and checking. In addition to furnishing general tidal control for large areas £or hydrographic work, the tabulations from these tide stations furnish sea-level datum determinations for the use 0£ engineers locally and for initial or " tie-in " points for the net of precise levels being extended throughout the country. Tide predictions for 1928 tide tables were begun October 5, 1925, and completed May 15, 1926. Tide predictions for all current table~ for the calendar year 1928 were begun January 18 and completed June 10, 1926. The predictions and submittal to the Government Printin()" Office of all manuscl'ipts of the tide and current tables issued by thisbureau have been advanced as to date each year for the past five or six years with the intention of having all tables for any calendar year ready for issue by July 1 of the preceding calendar year. This schedule has now been reached and is being maintained. · The following table, showing the number of copies of the tide tables issued each fiscal year for the 10 years 1916-1925 is indicative of the usefulness of these publications:

REPORT OF THl<i DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

Observations of currents were made at two light vessels on the Atlantic coast and one on the Pacific coast with the cooperation of the Lighthouse Service. It has been the aim during the past year to arrange the regular routine work so as to give as much time as possible for the preparation of publications dealing with tides and currents, and to make available to the mariner, engineer, scientist, and general public tho important data accumulating in our files. In accordance with this policy several special publications were prepared. Special Publication No. 113, Portable Automatic Tide Gauge, was received from the printer early in the fiscal year. This publication gfres a description of the portable gauge recently developed by this bureau and gives detailed instructions for its installation and operation. Special Publication No. 115, Tides and Currents in San Francisco Bay, was rece.ived from the printer on August 18, 1925. This is the second of a series of special publications presenting the results of tide and current surveys made in the important waterways of the United States. It contains 125 pages and 39 illustrations. Special Publication No. 119, Tidal Bench Marks, District of Columbia, was received from the printer in December, 1925. It comprises 14 pages and 1 illustration. Special Publication No. 121, Coastal Currents Along the Pacific Coast of the United States, was received from the printer in June. 1926. This publication comprises 80 pages and 23 illustrations and discusses in detail the tidal currents, nontidal currents, and winddriven currents at each of the five light vessels on the Pacific coast. During the year the manuscript of Special Publication No. 123, Tides and Currents in Delaware Bay and River, was prepared. The page proof has been received from the printer and delivery is ex .. pected early in the next fiscal year. This w.ill be the third of the series of special publications presenting the results of tide and current surveys in the important waterways of the United States. The manuscript of Special Publication No. 124, Instructions for Tidal Current Surveys, was prepared during the year. The galley proof has been received from the printer. It is the purpose of this publication to give field engineers of the survey descriptions of the instruments used and detailed instructions for conducting current surveys. The observations obtained from the current and tide survey of southeast Alaska have been analyzed during this fiscal year. The manuscript of a publication on tides and currents in southeast Alsaka will go to the printer early in the coming fiscal year. In addition, the improvements to our present current predictions, made possible by this survey, have been incorporated in the current tables for the use of the mariner. · \Vork was done on the manuscript of a special publication entitled "Tidal Datum Planes," which will be sent to the printer during the coming fiscal year. \Vork was also begun on the manuscript of three special publications entitled:
Tidal Bench Marks, State of Rhode Island. '.l'idal Bench Marks, Stnte of Cpnnecticut. Tidal Bench Marks, State of N~w Jersey.

REPOR.T OF THE DIRECTOR COAS'.l' AND GEODE'.l'IC SUR.VEY

It is planned to complete the manuscript of these three publications during the coming fiscal year. For many years the need has been felt for a semipopular stylebook on the tides which would· serve us an introduction to the more technical publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and which would acquaint the general public with the importance and interest of tides and currents. It was felt that it must be so written and so illustrated as to preclude its issue as a Government publication. H. A. Marmer, chief tidal mathematician of the division of tides and currents, had been privately working on such 11 publication since 1919. In April, 1926, D. Appleton & Co. issued his book, cnlled The Tide. . The cooperative arrangement with the British Admiralty in the exchange of tidal predictions has been continued and extended to one more station, Bahia Blanca. 'l'his cooperation began with the exchange of predictions for six American ports for the predictions of six British ports. It hus now been extended to 17 ports each. Since this constitutes about 20 per cent of our tide prediotions, the economy effected for each country is obvious. A cooperative agreement was made during the past year with the Canadian Hydrographic Office, effective for 1928. Under this plan data for three standard poi·ts will be received: Quebec, Halifax, and St. John. Halifax and St. John have been previously predicted by this survey and Quebec will be included as an addi'tional port. This will furnish daily predictions for an importa11f; port and will furnish a better reference port for a number of subO?,'dinate stations along the St. Lawrence River. · During the year a current diagram, larger than heretofore published in the current tables and printed on heavy chart paper, was issued for Chesapeake Bay. This is the second of a proposed series covering the inland waters of the United States. One for Nantucket and Vineyard Sounds was issued last year.
DIVISION OF ACCOUNTS

From July 1, 1925, to June 30, 1926, the actual disbursements on account of appropriations for the Coast and Geodetic Survey amounted to $2,255,247.78. It must be understood, however, that this does not represent the actual expenses of the survey for the fiscal year 1926, but only the actual disbursements. In a separate report to Congress will be found an itemized statement showin<>' disbursements from each appropriation and subitems thereof with all detailed information as to the character of the expenditure. These expenditures include the accounts of all chiefs of parties in the field located throughout the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico, the Philippines, and the Virgin Islands. From 30 to 50 chiefs of parties were engaged on field duty at vurious times duri~g. t~e year, being financ~~ through advances made to them by. this d1v1s1on, and accounts ansmg under such advances were submitted to and through this division to the Treasury Department. The total appropriations for the fis('11l );eur 1926 were $2,827,650.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SUR.VEY
INSTRUMENT DIVISION

It is the duty of the instrument division to provide the equipment used by all the field parties and observatories of the survey which are engaged in geodetic surveying, precise leveling, terrestrial magnetic work, study of ocean tides and currents, hydrographic charting, and all the other activities in which this bureau engages. This involves purchase and inspection of standard and special makes of surveying and navigating instruments, numerous articles of general property, and the storage and issue of such instruments and equipment. Whenever special instruments or apparatus are needed it is the :function of the instrument division to design such instruments or apparatus, to compile specifications, make detailed drawings, etc. The repair and adjustment of the instrument stock also comes under the jurisdiction of this division, as well as the construction o:f new models of original design where such models can not be obtained through commercial channels, which is usually the case. The division also maintains the property record system by m.eans of which the transference of equipment to and between field parties is accounted £or. A number of new instruments and improvements were effected during the past year, the more tmportaRt of which are listed as . follows: Large tide gauge.-The clock mechanism used in this gauge has required the use of two timepieces, which it has been necessary to synchronize. This arrangement has never been satisfactory, nor in the original design was provision made for interchangeability, which made replacement of defective parts difficult. The entire timepiece mechanism was redesigned so that one clock now serves the purpose of the former two, and this clock is so mounted on a special plate that it can be removed from the gauge and a new one inserted without adjustment and without the use of any other tool than a small screw driver. All units are interchangeable and the work of removing a defective clock and installing a new one requires but a few minutes. Ten gauges have been remodeled after this design and are in operation. The·remainder 'vill be altered flS soon as time permits. Magnetic rec01·ding box.-This instrument was entirelv redesigned and a more accurate and rugged timepiece substituted for the delicate mechanism formerly used. The intricate linkage .which operate4 the shutter w!ls. replaced. by a single lever with a simple tripJ.?ing device. In the or1gmal box it was necessary to change the sensitized recording film in absolute darkness, which was decidedly inconvenient. A small electric lamp in a light-proof housing was built into the box, with a red window on the interior to shut out the a~tinic rays. The film can now be easily changed. First-order theodolite.-There has been a demand for a number of years for an improved. first-order theodolite. Such an instrument was designed in this division embodying all the features which our field experience with a wide variety of makes of such instruments has indicated to be desirable. This instrument will have a 9-inch graduated circle with vertical microscopes, with two micrometer boxes reading to one second. The telescope will be internal focusing and will transit through the wyes. The vertical· axis is designed to

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

3I

reduce friction to a minimum and to. eliminate the effect of temperature changes. It will be provided with a means of bringing an electric current from an outside source without the use of external wires to the bulbs which illuminate the telescope crosswires and the micrometer drums. Signal lamps.-A new and more powerful signal lamp was designed alon~ the lines of the 1924 model, which is entirely inclosed. The body ot the lamp was strengthened so as to eliminate the special packing box, which has added greatly to the expense of this instrument. A more powerful bulb was procured for this lamp. It has the same design of special filament which the survey has been using for several years. Wave-recording rtpparatus.~A request was received from the State of New Jersey to cooperate in the study of the effect of waves on the coast. The instrument division designed a machine which records on a moving sheet of paper the height, form, frequency, and speed of the ocean waves. This record will furnish information as to the number of waves, their height and speed, and the amount of water which is projected upon the beach during any given period of time at a given place. Sounding tubes.-'l'he device used for measuring the depth to which the tube has desc~nded when making soundings (indicated by the amount of water contained in the tube when brought to the surface) has never been entirely satisfactory, as it is affected by mois 7 ture. An instrument for use with these tubes was designed to indicate the depth by electric means. The instrument is expected to be more accurate and more eB;sily used than the former type. It will eliminate the loss of soundmgs by spillage of the water in the tube and will reduce the accuracy necessary in the construction of the tube itself, with a consequent reduction in the cost. Oh1'onograph.-'rhese instruments, which were originally designed for laboratory use and which were extremely heavy, have been a very cumbersome piece of apparatus to use in field work. The weight has been materially reduced by the li~htening of the parts and by the use 0£ ball bearings, cutting down friction, and thereby reducing the weight necessary to operate the mechanism. Soitnding engraving 'lliachine.-A duplicate of the machine built last yea.r for the Washington office was partially completed. When finished it will be sent to the office at Manila. In connection with this machine experiments were carried on to procure a more durable engraving point. The finest grade of hardened steel soon wears blunt. A sample point was made of stellite, an exceedingly hard nonferrous alloy, which has stood up to the work much better than steel. It is intended to carry the experiments further, testing the possibility of using jewels or a metal point plated with chromium. Ounent-meter wire.-The wire used with current meters has not been ~ntirely satisfac~01:y, as ~he insulation is readily broken. An experimental lot of similar wire protected by metal armorinO" such as is comm?nly used with ~utomobile ~ighting cable has bee~ procured and is now undergomg a test m the field. It is expected that t1?-is wire will be much more durable and consequently less e.xpensive. Radio acoustic appamtus.-A complete ship's set of radio equip.tnent, such as is used in radio acoustic ranging, was nearly completed

32,

l\EPORT 01< THB DilllWTOU COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

during the year. This work is being done at a decided saving over the commercial cost. · Tapes.-A sample lot of pocket ta:i;>es made of stainless steel was procured during the year and are bemg tested out under field conditions. These tapes are not so easily broken as the _common steel tape nor are they readily corroded. They are sufficiently stiff so that they are not readily kinked, in which characteristic they are superior to monel metal. Preliminary reports have indicated that these tapes will be satisfactory when used under severe conditions and it is thought that they will be superior to anything previously used. Sesquicentennial B"'xposition.-An elaborate exhibit has been prepared for the Sesquicentennial Bxposition at Philadelphia, consisting of a variety of the instruments used in our various kinds of work, illustrated slides showing the work in progress, an exhibit of the various steps involved in the production of charts, and a working model of the wire-drag apparatus. This model consists of a pair of small launches which tow a miniature wire drag over a distance of 5 feet in a metal-lined tank filled with water dyed sea green. Suitable islands and mainland made of concrete and properly painted are placed in _the. tank. Three sides are inclosed by a canvas screen pamted to furnish a landscape effect. To illustrate the use of the radio acoustic apparatus a ship was painted upon this screen, apparently at some distance from the shore, with a radio to1ver in the foreground. A sinuous line of miniature electric bulbs between the ship and the radio tower, lighted by a motordriven flashing apparatus, furnishes the illusion of a sound wave passing from the ship to the shore station, and 11 straight line of ~imilar lights from the shore to the ship illustrate the radio waves of the return signal. ·

DIVISION OF CHAR1'8

Because of the lack of personnel to devote to production of new <·harts or' reconstruction of old ones, it is difficult to make an accurate :forecast for the fiscal year 1927. Schemes for 27 new charts are listed for taking up, of which 11 were on hand at the close of the fiscal year 1926. It is hoped that half of the charts listed can be ~ompleted during this year.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL l\IAGNE1'ISM AND SJ<JISMOLOGY

The program for 1927 is as follows : Magnetic wodc.-Attempt to complete the observatory publication for· Cheltenham, 1923-24, for the printer.

DIVHUON UF TJirns AND Cl:UnJ<;NTS

The progrn.m for the division of tides :ind currents for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1927, is as follows: The predictions for the tidP and c·11n·ent tahles for th(' calendar year 1H29 will be made and the mannseript;; ;;ubmittt>d to the printer in time for issue on or before .Tuly 1, 1928. The sounding records received from hydrogruphic parties will be ehecked :for tidal datum planes as received, so that the chart division 'vill not be delayed by this phase of the work in the publication of charts. The bench-mark records receivecl from the field ,yjll be computed for those demanding immediate attention and the remainder kept up to elate as the force of mathematicians will allow. The manuscript of a publication on the currents and tides of southeastern Alaska will be completed an<l sent to press early in the fiscal year. The manu;;cript of a publication on the currents and tides of Boston and Portsmouth Harbors will be prepal'ed and sent to press late in the fiscal year. The observations obtained on the current and tide snrvey in Boston and Portsmouth Harbors will be analyzed as soon as possible upon their receipt from the field parties; and the improvements to our present current predictions, made possible by this survey, will be incorporated in the current tables for use of the mariner. "\Vith a view to economy in the proi:;ecntion of the current surrnys attention will be given to the correction of weaknesses which may develop this season in the Pettersson automatic current meter, which is being given a thorough test during the Bo:i;ton and Portsmouth current surveys. Plans will be developed for the use of these meters, unattended, in order to reduce the unit cost of this work. The :foregoing constitutes the outstanding features of the program for the next fiscal year in addition to the normal routine work of the division. In general, the work of the division will be so arranged as to take up immediately the work upon which the predictions of tides and currents and the publication of charts depend; after that the energies of the division will be directed toward keeping the tide and current tabulations and reductions up to date and issuing in the form of publications the large mass of material that has accumulated and which is of considerable value to the navigator, the engineer, the scientist, and the public generally.

DIVISION OF ACCOUNTS

37 .

The program for this division will be a continuance of the duties jncident to disbursing the funds appropriated for the operation of the bureau, including the financing of all chiefs of parties at the work in the field, together with the verification of all accounts arising under such advances.
INS'l'RUMEN'l' DIVISION

The program for the fiscal year 1926-27 will be to construct, repair, and purchase such instruments as are necessary to maintain a suitable stock ready for issue, so that our field parties will at all times have adequate equipment in sufficient quantity to avoid delay when unavoidable breakages occur. Constant effort will be made to improve the existing designs and to design and build such new instruments as may be needed, more particularly the completion of a new theodolite, sounding-tube measuring device, and such other instruments as the needs of the year may require.

CHAPTER I
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE FIELD DURING THE FISCAL YEAR
HYDHOGRAPHIO AND TOPOGRAPHIC WORK

The hydrographic and topographic surveys made during the fiscal year 1926 are listed with reference to their geographic location as follows: Atlantic coast.-Revision of surveys was made along the Camden shore line of the Delaware River, and work has been begun on the revision of the shore line of Raritan Bay, N .·J., and on the south side of Long Island east of Far Rockaway, X. Y. A field examination was made for the Coast Pilot from Cape Cotl to Sandy Hook,. and for the Inside Route Pilot, New York to Key ·west. Reconnaissance for later revision surveys was made ori the Gulf coast between Tampa and Key "\i\Test. Complete resurveys have been made of Tampa Bay for the construction of large-scale charts showing· the extensive developments which have been carried since the previous survey, 'vhich was made a number of years ago. Control points were established for accurate location of navigational aids in the St.·Johns River, Fla., between Jacksonville and the coast. The survey of South Carolina from shoal water inlets ont to the 100fathom curve is nearing completion. J<Jxperimental work in echosounding is being carried on in conjunction with this work. Additional soundings were made in the southern approach to Cape Henry, Va. PMific coast.-A survey of Newport Bay was completed. Soundings were obtained in San Pedro .Channel and in the large area south of Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands, Calif. A special hydro~raphic investigation was made of the water :front of San Francisco. also of the South Channel and Bonita Channel, San Francisco Bay· Entrance. These channels were swept with a wire drag, to locate a reported danger and for the least depth in the vicinity of Centissima Rocle A wire-drag survey of Greenwood Landing, Calif., is in progress. Soundings were taken off the coast of Oregon from Port Orford south. A reconnaissance was made of the inshore area near Cape Blanco. Surveys of the coasts of Oregon and "\i\T ashington in the vicinity of the Columbia River have been recently begun. Two separate surveys, in September and February, were made of the channels across Willapa Bar. A survey of the shore· line along the Strait of Juan de Fuca west of Point 'Wilson was completed. Field examination of the Pneific coast for pilot infor-· mabon was completed. Alasl~a.-In southeast Alaska surveys have been extended in the following sections: Chatham Straits, from Cape Decision to Port Malmesbury and in the vicinity of Port Alexander; in Pvbus Bay,. Frederick Sound; in Cordova Bay along the shore of Lo"ng Island and through Kaigani Strait; also into Port Refugio on Suemez ' Island. In various parts of the main ship channels supplementary examinations are being made. The outer coast is now completely surveyed from Dixon Entrance to Cross Sound, the northern part of

this work having been accomplished during this year. Surveys were completed on the southeast side of the Alaska Peninsula, in Chignik and Kujulik Bays and their al?p~oaches, in Ikotan Bay, and ~n the area between Cold and Belkofsln Bays. \i\Tork was started rn Balboa Bay .. Echo sounding lines were run in making passage to and from the field and between points in the field. An original survey was begun in May in Shuyak Strait between Afognak and Shuyak Islands to chart this newly developed region and permit steainers to enter with safety. The prelimmary reconnaissance of the Aleutian Peninsula was completed. Hawaiian I slands.-Surveys were extended on the south coasts of Oahu and Kauai Islands. This included intensive development of the reefs and of the roadsteads in which ships anchor to load and discharge. Hydrographic investigations were made on Penguin Bank and in the waters west of Niihau Island. Philippine /8lands.-In the Philippine Islands surveys were carried on in the regions north of Luzon Island, in the Sulu Sea, along the Sulu Archipelago, and in Malampaya Sound. Reconnaissance for triangulation in the Cagaynn Valley of Luzon has been made. A current survey of San Bernardino Straits was completed. Pol'to Rico.-The examination of the waters east of Porto Rico and in the Virgin Islnn<ls. wns nearing completion at the close of the year. · ·

Thfl plans made at the beginning of the fiscal year 1926 contemplated the completion of certain arcs of first-order triangulation to the westward of the ninety-eighth meridian, which would fill out in general outline the first-order triangulation net of that half of the country. It is inevitable that readjustments of triangulation over large areas must be made from time to time in order to get the best and most reliable geographic positions of the triangulation stations. When the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was first begun, 110 years ago, it was necessary to start the surveys of the coast from a number of astronomic stations. As the triangulation was extended from each of these stations and was joined, there was a failure to check. In order to eliminate this trouble, large stretches of the

REPORT OF· THE DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

coast were computed from a single astronomic station or an adopted astronomic position. Eventually the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States had a continuous .triangulation as had also the Pacific coast. Then the two coasts were joined by an arc of first-order trianrrulation which extendecl across the country along the thirtyninth0 parallel. About 25 years ago, after this transcontinental arc had been completed, it was decided to compute all of the triangulation of the two coasts and the interior from a single station. The station selected \Yas Meades Ranch in central Kansas. This station with its Jatitl!de and longitude adopted with reference to Clark's spheroid of 1."6u was termed the United States Standard Datum. This datum was fater adopted by Canada and Mexico :for computing their triangulation, and a continuous single network for the whole of North America was thus obtained. The name of the datum was then changed to North America Datum. The triangulation executed during the past 25 years has been fitted to tht> arcs or network in existence at the time the single .datum for the country was adopted. As the new work was fitted into the old, it had to take up all the closing errors of the loops of which it. was <t part. In many cases much larger corrections had to be applied than the quality of the new work justified. Two years ago it was decided that a readjustment of the firstordcr triangulation to the westward of the ninety-eighth meridi&n could be made as soon as a comparatively small amount of field work had been executed to complete the net. The resulting geographic positi~ms coul.d then be held for all time except in so far as the triangulat10n stations might be affected locally by earthquakes, or earth. movements between earthquakes. A plan for this readjustment was worked out and has been used in the office of the survey at Washington since the early part of the fiscal year 1926. It has proven to be entirely successful and it marks a long step forward in geodetic practices. The arcs of triangulation needed at the beginning of the fiscal year 1926 to complete the skeleton network of the western part of the country included the arc along the forty-ninth parallel from longitmlc 115° westward to Point Roberts, comprising the western extremity of the boundary between Canada and the United States; an arc from the vicinity of Umatilla, Oreg., northward to the Canadian boundary in the vicinity of Oroville; an arc extending from a point just to the eastward of the Black Hills in South Dakota westward through Wyoming to the vicinity of Bozeman, Mont.; an arc extending from the vicinity of Needles, Calif., to the vicinity of Salt Lake City, Utah; an arc extending from the vicinity of San Luis Obispo, Calif., across the Sierra, Nevada Mountains, Death Valley, and into Nevada. All of this triangulation was accomplished during the summer of 1925 except the last-mentioned arc and a short stretch of the arc extending along the forty-ninth parallel through the Cascade Mountains. The party working in the Cascade Mountains encountered very dense smoke resulting from the many forest fires in northern Washington and in British Columbia. The smoke was so dense that a mountain side 500 yards away could not be seen even in its barest outlines. Every effort was made to complete the work before the

42

REPORT OF THl<~ DIRECTOU COAST AND GEODETIC SUUVEY

winter set in, but this was impossible, and the party got out of the high mountains just ahead of heavy snows which would have made traveling very dangerous for the men. A party \vith five observers went into the Cascade Mountains on June 29, 1926. ·with a party as strong as this it was hoped that the observing might be completed during the month of July and the early part of ~ugust, 1926, before the smoke from forest fires became troublesome. It is important to complete the work in the early summer because of the glaciers leading up the high peaks on which the triangulation sta.tions are located. From about the middle of June to the middle of August the surfaces of the glaciers are smooth and firm, but after the middle of August the heat o:f the summer starts the movement of the glacial ice, and crevasses are formed which make travel over the ice very dangerous. Travel over the exposed surfaces o:f the mountains is very difficult and in places somewhat hazardous. This makes it desirable that the surfaces of the glaciers be used :for reaching the peaks, and this can only be done before the crevasses are :formed. H is certain that the work in California mentioned above and that in the Cascade Mountains will be completed in the early part of the fiscal year 1927, and then there will be nothing to interfere with the early completion of the readjlrntment o:f the triangulation net to the west of the ninety-eighth meridian. In order to supply astronomic data to be used in the adjustment of the triangulation net a party observed astronomic azl.muths and longitudes at a nnmber of triangulation stations in South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, 'Vashington, and Canada. This party also observed the astronomic latitude of each of these points, the latter work being accomplished with no additional expense. Other field work accomplished during the fiscal year consisted of the selection of triangulation stations along the arc from Umatilla, Oreg., to Oroville, Wash. ; the selection of stations along the arc from San Luis Obispo, Calif., to Las Vegas, Nev.; and the selection of triangulation stations along an arc extending from the vicinity of Albert Lea in southern Minnesota southward through Iowa and Missouri into Arkansas. Selection o:f triangulation stations was also made in Mississippi and Alabama. At the close of the fiscal year a party was just starting the selection of stations for triangulation from the vicinity o:f Harpers Ferry on the Potomac River northwestward toward Lake Erie. This arc of triangulation will extend past Pittsburgh, Pa., where a connection will be provided with the triangulation being executed by that city. First-order leveling was executed in South Dakota from Sioux Falls westward to Rapid City. This line o:f levels was designed to break up a large area in which no first-order bench.marks had been established. Another line of levels was run in Colorado from Colorado Springs southward through Pueblo, thence west to Salida, and thence northward to Leadville. This line was run at the request of the United States Geological Survey, which is making topographic surveys along the route followed. Field expenses were paid by that organization. . First-order leveling was executed in California from Laws southward to Mojave. This line of levels was run in connection with

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

earthquake studies. It extends across Owens Valley just to the northward of Owens Lake. The line began at an elevation of approximately 8,000 feet on the eastern slope of the Sierra N evt<da Mountains and ended at a point high up at the western slope of the Inyo Mountains. First-order leveling was executed in Los Angeles CountyA Calif., at the request of the United States Geological Survey, the held expenses bemg paid from the appropriation made to that bureau. In connection with earthquake studies, first-order triangulation was executed along the thirty-ninth parallel part way across Nevada. Stations of the old transcontinental arc were reoccupied and angles remeasured. Earthquake studies were also the main purpose for the first-order triangulation which was extended from the vicinity of San Francisco Bay north ward to Point Arena and the Ukiah latitude station. Under the plan for earthquake studie~ there was also executed certain triangulation near Santa Barbara Channel and a base line was measured to the eastward of San Luis Obispo, Calif. The Coast and Geodetic Survey continued its cooperation with Rochester, N. Y., in the extension of a first-order horizontal control system over the city and its suburbs. This work is designed to furnish the basis for cadastral and topographic surveys of the city and for its many engineering operations. Plans were made late in the fiscal year to cooperate with the Conservation Commission of the State of New Jersey in the execution of a short arc of triangulation along the coast of New Jersey southward of Barnegat Bay. It is expected that a party will take the field to begin this work in the early part of the fiscal year 1927. It is of. considerable interest that a determination of the old longitude station at Seattle, Wash., by means of radio time signals sent by the Naval Observatory at Washington through the Annapolis Radio Station, differs only 0.003 second of time from the value obtained for that station by the old method of longitude <le terminations ·where t.elegra ph lines were used to exchange the time signals between observatories. This close agreement is a source of great satisfaction and it indicates clearly that the longitudes determined by means of the radio signals have a very high degree of accuracy. · · Some work was done on the international plan to determine the national base longitude stations throughout the world. The field work will be executed between October 1 and ·November 30, 1926. 'The United States Naval Observatory will make observations in Washington and at San Diego, Calif., while observers of the Coast and Geodetic Sm:vey will occupy stations at Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, and Mamla, P. I. These. base stations will be used in connection with the charting and mapping systems of this and other countries. The longitude work contemplated will have a scientific value in that a comparison of these determinations with other determinations in the future will furnish a test of the stability of the relation of land masses to each other. In Alaska the arc of first-order triangulation extending from Dixon Entrance to Skagway was completed by the measurement of

44

REPORT O:F THE DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

the Glacier Point base and by extending the triangulation :from the head, of Lynn Canal to Skagway. The selection of trian~ulation stations for an arc which will extend from the vicinity ot Fairbanks eastward to Eagle at the international boundary between Canada and Alaska was also completed. No field work was done in the determination of the values of gravity dming the fiscal year, but some work was done in the reduction of gravity stations by the isostatic method. It has been found that the values reduced by that method filrnish valuable geological information which will make geological studies and investigations in the future more effective. There is a probability also that the values of gravity reduced by the isostatic method will have a value in disclosing subsurface structures in regions where oil investigations are made. One American oil company is now using a gravity apparatus in studying subsurface structure, and another company has been corresponding with this bureau and plans to take up gravity work in the near future. 1 In the office at 1Vashington computations were made for reducing by the isostatic method certain gravity stations which were established by an official of the Geodetic Committee of Holland in voyages on a submarine. The results obtained at sea supplement the gravity data now available on land and will aid much in geophysical and geological stndies.
l\IAGNE'rIC AND SEISMOLOGIC w01m:

The magnetic work accomplished during the year was as follows: ·work in progress in the Northwestern States at the close of the last fiscal year was continued, repeat and new stations being occupied and defective stations replaced in Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Wat.hington, North Dakota, and Minnesota. Defective stations were replaced in Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. · . Repeat stations were occupied in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts. A party engaged in reconnaissance in the Aleutian Islands occupied several stations, thereby contributing valuable information in this region. Vessels at work in southeastern and western Alaska made observations at triangulation stations. Routine obsel'vations of the magnetic elements were made at all the observatories throughout the year, except San Juan, P. R. where only a half year's observations were obtained owing to change of site. The following additional work was done: Olieltenllmn.-Work. on temperature compensation of H va;riometer was completed. Investigation of method for improving design of Z variometer was begun and was in progress at close of the fiscal year. There was cooperation with the instrument division in design of details of temperltture compensation of H and Z variometers. A number of instruments were standardized for use of tlw bureau. ·A magnetometer belonging to the U. S. S. Niagara was standardized. Officers of the Chinese Navy spent some time at Cheltenham lea ruing details of magnetic work as carried on by the bureau.

Direct scaling of magnetograms began with October records. Improvements were suggested to facilitate the work. Members of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, Carnegie Institution, of 1Vashington, spent considerable time at the observa~ tory on various investigations, using the small experimental building. Certain instrumental improvements resulting may prove of universal application. Porto Rico.-Construction was snfiiciently completed so that instruments could be installed and operation started in January. Since that date instrumental adjustments have been found necessary, but by the encl of the fiscal year all were functioning and temperature compensation was in effect. Direct scaling awaited completion of adjustments. Tucson.-Thc activity of the station was interfered with by burning of the house and office bnilcling during June. ·No records or jmportant instruments were lost. During the year reports of fires observed were made to the Forest Service. · Sitlca.-Investigation of auroras in connection with telegraph and radio disturbances was continued. This work bears a definite relation to the study of the International Research Council on this subject. H onolitl1i.-A number of possible observatory sites were examined. ~feteorological observations were made for the naval air station. Special luminosity obserrntions were made :for Lord Rayleigh at the request of the Mount 1Vilson Solar Observatory at Pasadena. Seisnwlogy.--Dosch Omori seismographs were kept in operation n,t Cheltenham, Sitka,_ San Juan (half year), and Tucson (half year), and a Milne Shaw seismograph wasoperatedatHonolulu. A WoodAnderson seismograph was installed at Tucson durino· the year and the unsatisfactory Bosch Omori put out of commissio~1. Immediate reports were made of all the important earthquakes and routine reports of others ·were recorded.

In connection with a sanitary survey of the Potomac River in the vicinity of Washington, a portable automatic tide gauge was maintained during the month of August, 1925, at the Potomac Boat Club near the Aqueduct Bridge, Washington, D. C., in cooperation with the sanitary engineer of the Public Health Service. The results of curre:µt observat10ns in the vicinity of Washington were also desired by the sanitary engineer, but no· comprehensive observations had been made by this bureau. During the past year an important current and tide survey was · made in southeast Alaska and m Puget Sound. This work, extending o;ver a period of three months, was carried on from 30 current stations, covering the important passages between Puget Sound, Wash., and Cross Sound, Alaska, where the current velocity is sufficient to be a menace to shipping. This bureau cooperated in the maintenance of tide stations at Los Angeles and Honolulu, and arrangements are being made for cooperation with the Navy Department in maintainin~ tide stations at San Diego, Calif., and Portsmouth, N.

REPORT 01' 'l'HE DIHECTOH COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

47

San Diego was established by the inspector at San :Francisco at the end of the fiscal year. Special interest is attached to tidal results obtained :from a deep well at Longport, N. J., through a cooperation with the New ,Jersey Department of Conservation and Development. In connection with an investigation of ground-water conditions by the State of New Jersey, one of the portable tide gauges recently designed in this bureau was loaned to the authorities of the State. Observation of the tidal fluctuations in the wen at Longport, which iR approximately 800 feet deep, were made for a period of a year. These observations wen; reduced in this office and compared with the simultaneous observatwns at our primary tide station on the Atlantic City steel pier. In the well the high waters occurred on an average 14 minutes later and the low waters 12 minntes later than at the steel pier. The mean range of tjftc in the well was a little more than one-half as great as at the st'eel pier. Irregular meteorological fluctuations in the open ocean were reflected by correspondiI~g fluctuations of smaller magnitude in the well. This is brought out by t~e tide reconl o~' a day i~ which a tide in the well was compared with the ocean tide at a tune when the ocean '\Yas disturbed by a strong northwest gale. · The "\Veather Bureau 1-;tation aud the commnndant of the naval submarine base at Key "\Vest, Fla., cooperated with this bureau in the establishment of a new tide station at Key "\Vest at the submarine base. During the past year the tide stations at San Diego, Calif., and Anchorage, Alaska, were discontinued. The station at Anchorage fulfilled the purpose for which it was established-the determination of a sea-level datum for the precise leveling in the vicinity. The tide station at E?an Diego was discontinued after a year of simultaneous observations with La ,Jolla, which will hereafter furnish tidal contro~ for t~1i~ region. In addition, La Jolla is a more satisfactory locat10n a.sit is an open-ocean station~ The tide-gauge statwn at Sitka, Alaska, having been operated for 18 months for the purpose of obtaining modern observations for a standard port, 'yas closed on. December 31, 1925. The tide stat10n at Waslungton, D. C., 'vas destroyed by fire on June 4, 1926. The observer was placed on furlough until the station could be reestablished. The tide station o~ the jetty at the entrance to Galveston, Tex., established to determme the relation of the outside Gulf of Mexico tides with those at the primary station at Galveston, was discontinued on Mnrrh 4, 1926. Due to the fact that the tide station at Cedar Keys had about fulfilled the purpose for which it was established, and further to the fact that the wharf on which the station was located is in bad condition,- that station was discontinued on June 30, 1926. The current and tide survey of Boston and Portsmouth Harbors was begun on June ~· At the end of the fiscal year the observing in Boston Harbor was m progress. During the month of October a: portable automatic tide gauge was maintained on the open coast at San Francisco, Calif., at the Lurline

pumping station, in order to obtain a comparison of tide conditions on the open coast with those at the primary tide station at Presidiq inside the Golden Gate. During the latter part of the fiscal year current observations were made by the steamer Fathorne1' in San Bernardino Strait, P. I. The data from these observations will be used for the predictions of the currents for this strait for the current tables. This will be the first station not on the continent of North America to be included in these tables, which have been enlarged each year since their inception. Temperature and density observations, frequently requested of this o:flice by prospective builders in connection with cold-storage plants2 by fishmg concerns, and especially by investigators in the study ot pile-boring limnoria, are being made at the primary tide stations at no increased cost to the survey. In addition, short series of temperature and clensity observations were made at 16 stations in Alaska and four in J>uget Sound and vicinity, in connection with the tide and current survey carried on last summer.

CHAPTER II
PROGRAM FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IN THE FIELD
IIYDIWGRAPHIC AND TOPOGRAPHIC WORK

Atl(Jtfl,tic a!l1ii Gulf coasts.-Offshore hydrography to a depth of 100 :fathoms will be continued on the North Carolina coast :from Cape Fear to Cape Lookout by the steamship Lydonia. The steamship Ba:clw will perform simiiar work on the Virginia coast northward o:f Cape .Charles and on the li)'irida coast after completing the survey of Tampa Bay. . Revision surveys will be made by launch parties of th~ south shore of Long Island, of parts of Ne\v York Harbor and the seaward approach to the harbor, of several parts of the Potomac River, and o:f several small harb~rs. The steamship Hydrograplte1' will be employed, after ?o!11pletmg the resurvey of Tampa Bay, on 1;'esurveys and chart revision along the southern Gulf coast of Florida from Charlotte Harboiz .to Cape Ron1ano, and then :from Cape Romano to Cape Sable, if satisfactory arrangements can be made for obtaining airplane photographs of this section of the coast. A resurvey of parts of the upper w~ters of Chesapeake Bay and tributaries will be made by the steamslup Ranger on completion of the work in Porto Rico. Wire-drag surveys will be resumed in northern New Englnnd waters and along the Florida Keys if funds are available. Wire-drag work between Porto Rico and the Virgin Islands will be completed and close surveys will be made of five or six important roadsteads around Porto Rico to enable the bureau to compile largescale charts of these places. Ocean-going vessels load sugar from these places and, a?cordingly, .there 1s a strong demand for largescale charts that will enable these vessels to anchor as close t-0 tbe shore as possible. Pacific coast atnd Alaslca.-The steamships Gwide and Pioneer will be employed on t11;e Oregon coast in the vicinity of the Columbia River entrance duru~g the summer fall, and late spring months, and on the southern California coast during the remainder of the year. This work will extend from close inshore to depths of 1,000 fathoms. The motor ship Natoma will be employed on various surveys in Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Launch parties will make resurveys in San Francisco Bay and at several landings along the California coast where lumber is taken bv large vessels. A resurvey will be made of 'Villapa Bar. · .The survey of the outer coast of southeastem Alaska will be completed as far north as Icy Point by the steamship SW1"Vey01·, after which this vessel will take up the survey of the coast between Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet. H possible. some of the tributaries of Prince 'VilJiam Sound \Yill be surveyed. ·

IlEPOHT OJ· THE DIHECTOH COAST A:ND GEODETIC SURVJ~Y

The steamship Explo1·er will survey Tebenko:f Bay an<l Keku Strait together with the intervening sectio~1 of the eastern shore of Chatham Strait. Shuyak Strait, in western Alaska, will also be surveyed during the year. Ii awavian Isla:nds.--The steamship J>iscove'l'er will continue work among the Hawaiian Islands on a project that contemplates the early survey of this entire group. The work will be centered largely around Kauai and Niihau. A small field party will ah;o <'ontinue the detailed inshore hydrography around Oahu. Philippine lsland«:.-The Federal imrvey ship Patl1fi,nr1a will \\'ork north o:f Luzon betwN·n northeast monH0011s a11d in thP deep area of the Sulu Sea at other times. The two Philippine sul'vey ships, Fathomer and i1fminduqtie, commanded by officcL'S of this bureau, will work in the southern part of the Sulu Archipelago. Triangulation for the control of a hyclrogmphic and topographicsurvey of the east coast of Luzon and to sfr<'ll!!t"·hPn ·tlH· :-11rn~v of the north coast of Lnzon, whic11 was be2;1m last spring, wiH be continued during the next fiscal year. Field work is being done largely by native surveyors under the supervision of officers of the· Coast and Geodetic Survey and is supported jointly hy the Philippine Bureau of Lands and the United States CoaRt and GP<1deticSurvey.
(;EOJ>ETIC WORK

Tl"iAngulation.-With t11e completion of the triangnlnt.ion in the Cascade Monntains in northwestern \Vashington, along the boundary between the United Stafos nml Canada, and of th(· arc of trianµ;ulation from the vicinity of San Luis Obispo, Calif., to a point in Nevada, the skeleton framework for the triangulation of llrn wnstern half of the country will be finished. This will hP a<·complishcd dnri11g the first half of the fiscaJ year 1927. The greatest necessity then remains for tlrn eomj'1letion of a sufficient amount of trinngnlhtion :rnd tntVPl'St' in tlw eastl·1·n half of the United States to make it possible to readjm:t tlw triangnlation of that area. Work will also be done on an arc of first-order triangulation which will extend north and south through Minne8ota, Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansa8, running approximately lwtwcen longitudes 93° and 94°. These arcs of horizontal control will meet a ,great need in a thickly Rettled country whel'c, at pres<'nt, there arc no accurate control data available. An arc o:f first-ordl'r triangulation will be extended from a point near Harpers Ferry, on the Potomac River, northwestward to the Yicinity of Painesville, Ohio, on the southern shore of Lnke Erie, running across the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania into northeastern Ohio. That arc will pass just. to the eastwnrd of Pittsburgh, Pa., where a connection will be made with the triangulation executed by the city of Pittsburgh. 1'rmJerse.-During the fiscal year 1927 it is planned to hnve firstorder traverse and, triangulatl.on extended from the vicinity of Green Bay, vVis., westward through La Crosse, Wis., thence westward thniugh southern Minnesota to the ninety-eighth meridian in South Dakota.

Occupation of repeat and new stations and replacement of defective t:fations are proposed to be carried out in three sections of the c01mtry-,Vestern Mountain States, Middle \Vestern States, and Middle Atlantic ~tates. The building at Tucson destroyed by fire will be rehnilt. Needed replacement of damaged structures will be made at Honolul!I· Imp~·ove)nent of observatory instruments will be carried on nnt1l conditions are such that operations will be fully eeonomical. Improwmcnt of inst:illation at Tucson will be given special attention. Improvcmcn.ts w1ll ?e made at other observatories. There will be cooperation with var10us institutions engaged in seismologic work. The seis111~graph at the University of Chicago, formerly operated by the W cath~r Bureau, will he kept in operation. Scvel'ul oflicp1·s will be tra111ed in field seismologic work so as to be available in ca;'>e of au important earthquake, as heretofore valnable information ha,.; been lost because rPgions were not visited nt once by skilled observers.
'rnm
AND CURRENT WOUK

During the mouth~ of .July, August, and part of September, i926, the bureau will contmuc the current and tide survey of Boston and Portsmouth Harbors ·which was beO"un ,June 1, l926. The data from this sm·v(\): will be used for'"' furnishing better-determined 'alues for our tule an~l current tables and for preparation of a hj)t'Cial publicntion <lealmg with the tides and currents of these two harbors. It is proposed to take up a comprehensive current and tide survey of Che:".i1peake Bay arn~ tributaries toward the end of the ~seal year !D27 and throng:h the hrst of the fiscal year 1928. At various. tunes m the past considerable current work of value has been done m the main area of the hay. It is intended to tie these observations together by simultaneous observations over the area and to extend this work into the tributaries, in practically all 0£ which no current observations have been obtained. ·

52

REPOR'l' OF THE DIRECTOR COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

Primary tide stations representative of tide conditions along the different stretches of coast will be maintained at the following places :
Portland, Me. Boston. Atlantic City. Philadelphia. Cape May. Baltimore. Old Point Comfort. Washington. Charleston. Key West. Pensacola. La Jolla. San Francisco. Daytona. Astoria. Seattle. Ketchikan. Seward. Valdez.

Stations will be operated at the following places with the cooperation of outside organizations:
Los Angeles. Honolulu. Hilo. Manila. San Diego. Portsmouth. Jamaica Bay, N. Y.

Having obtained long.series of hourly current observations on.the light vessels along the coasts of the United States, it is planned to discontinue these observations on all vessels on the Pacific coast this year, and continue on the Atlantic coast at two stations only-Diamond Shoals and Nantucket. At these two stations, however, observations will be made only twice daily for currents~ temperatures, and densities. The present appropriation does not permit of operating a preciselevel party to carry on the work of visiting locations of discontinued tide stations, for the purpose of leveling to old nonregulation bench marks as they may be recovered and ms~alling sufficient standard disks to protect the series from total loss. This work should be conrinued to perpetuate long series of observations which are now protected by few nonregulat10n bench marks, many of which have been destroyed and others in danger of being lost. It is intended to extend this work over several years and gradually bring it up to date by doing a small am01mt of work each year. The present appropriation is not sufficient to carry on this work. It is hoped that the pJans outlined for more economical prosecution of the current surv~ys will result in a saving sufficient to take up this important work again.
