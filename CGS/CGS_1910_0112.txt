REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.
WORK OF THE YEAR.
FIELD WORK.

The usual progress was made in the collection and preparation for publication in the form of Charts, Coast Pilots, Tide Tables, and Notices to Mariners of all information useful to navigators and relating to the coasts of the United States and under the jurisdiction of the United States. Very satisfactory progress was made in the Philippine Islands, where surveys were made for charting purposes along the unsurveyed portions of the coast, covering 10 per cent of the whole extent of the estimated general coast line of the archipelago. Good progress was made also in charting the unsurveyed coasts of Alaska, 톞he work being confined to the regions where the demand for charts is most urgent. Important improvements were made in the construction and use of the long wire drag, and its length was i!lcreased to 8 400 feet when used in open water. The long drags greatly increase the area possible to be covered in any given time, and consequently decrease the cost of examining harbors and channels of large extent. The improvements were described in a publication issued for the information of hydrographers. Details in regard to the work assigned to the Survey and to the Superintendent as Commissioner representing the United States in recovering and marking the international boundary between the United States and Canada and in the demarcation of the Alaska boundary are given in Appendixes 1 and 2, and form the basis of the following general statements. The establishment of refe~ence monuments in the United States along the water boundary between the United States and Canada between Point Roberts and the Pacific Ocean was completed. All these monuments were connected with the coast triangulation. The same boundary was surveyed and monumented from the summit of the Rocky Mountains eastward to the North Fork of Milk River, a distance of 50 miles, and considerable work was done to the east of this point. West of Lake Superior, the boundary was surveyed along Pigeon River to South Fowl Lake, a distance of 30 miles. On the eastern borders of Maine the survey of the boundary was completed from a point 2 miles below Van Buren, Me., to a point in the vicinity of Fort Kent, Me. On the St. Croix River the triangulation along the boundary from the mouth of the river to Butler Islands was completed. The work of all the parties east of the Rocky Mountains was in progress on June 30. In the demarcation of the Alaska boundary a survey was made and marks were established in the vicinity of the Unuk and Blue rivers in southeastern Alaska, and on

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

June 30 a party was at work in the valley of Salmon River and another party was at work in the region north of the head of Portland Canal. On the one hundred and forty-first meridian the survey of the boundary was completed between the Yukon River and the Natazhat Mountains 200 miles to the southward, and good progress was made in surveying the line to the northward of the river. This work was in progress on June 30. In this connection I wish to emphasize the importance of providing means for a triangulation down the great valley of the Yukon River from the international boundary to the mouth of the river to form the basis for the economic surveys in progress or in contemplation as a much more desirable plan than the coordination and adjustment of such surveys after they are made. Attention has been called to this work in my annual reports for 1908 and 1909, and an appropriation to begin this triangulation should not be delayed any longer. Work at the latitude observatories at Gaithersburg, Md., and Ukiah, Cal., maintained by the International Geodetic Association under my direction, was continued during the year. One officer continued on duty as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, and another was continuously employed in cooperation with the Maryland State Board of Shell Fish Commissioners in making a survey of the natural oyster bars and rocks in the State of Maryland. The work in Calvert County 톣as completed and a report covering the work was prepared and published. This officer was also authorized to supervise the survey of certain portions of the oyster beds in the State of Delaware, as requested by the governor, without expense to the National Government. Buoys were placed on the boundary between the States of Louisiana and Mississippi in Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound and referred to the marks previously established on shore, as requested by the state authorities, to aid in the enforcement of the state laws relating to oyster culture. The officer in charge of the Survey exhibit at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition remained on that duty until the close of the exposition, on October 16. In accordance with a request made by the War Department, an officer was detailed to serve as the representative of the United States on a commission of engineers created to make a survey of a portion of the Military road leading from the Aqueduct Bridge (across the Potomac River) to Fort Myer, Va. The location of a portion of the boundary of this road being in controversy between the United States and the owners of the adjoining property and the case being before the United States court for the eastern district of Virginia for settlement, a special master commissioner in chancery was named to take testimony, and he appointed the commission of engineers mentioned above. The survey was made and a final report was placed on file. In accordance with instructions issued to Civil Engineer R. E. Peary, U. S. Navy, as stated in the previous Annual Report, tide observations were made in the Arctic regions at Cape Sheridan, Cape Columbia, Cape Bryant, Fort Conger, and Cape Morris Jessup, and the records of the work have been placed on file. Valuable information in regard to the tides was obtained, and a discussion of "Arctic Tides" is being made for publication which will embody all the available information on this subject.

Astronomic observations to determine latitude, longitude, or azimuth were made in Texas and in Alaska. Observations to determine the relative force of gravity were made with a half-second pendulum at 27 stations distributed as follows: Four in Arizona, one in California, one in the District of Columbia, one in Maine, two in Michigan, two in Minnesota, two in New Mexico , three in New York, one in Nevada, one in North Dakota, one in South Dakota, two in Tennessee, five in Texas, and one in Vermont. The use of an interferometer, suitably modified, to dt!terminl! the flexure of the p<.>ndulum support was continued. A description of the instrument and the method of using it is given in Appendix 6. The Standard levels were extended in Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Topographic surveys were made in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Maryland, New Hampshire, North Carolina; Philippine Islands, Virginia, and Washington. Triangulation was done in Alaska, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Philippine Islands, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. The recovery of old triangulation stations was continued on the coasts of Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, and North Carolina. This work was completed on the west coast of Florida. Hydrographic work was done in Alaska, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Philippine Islands, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington. The examination of the navigable waters on the coast of Maine with the long wire drag was continued and a similar examination of Mayaguez Harbor and approaches in Porto Rico was made. A new edition of the Coast Pilot volume covering the coast from New York to Chesapeake Bay Entrance was prepared and published. The magnetic survey of the country was continued by making observations at 238 stations distributed over 39 States and Territories, including Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands, and numerous observations were made at sea on board the surveying vessels on their cruises to and from their fields of work in various portions of the country. A continuous record of the relative value of the magnetic elements was obtained at the magnetic observatories maintained by the Survey at Cheltenham, Md., Sitka, Alaska, Honolulu, Hawaii, and Vieques, P. R. Observations were made at Baldwin, Kans., for a portion of the year, and the instruments were then transferred to Tucson, Ariz., where observations are now in progress. Self-registering tide gauges were maintained at the following stations: Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Baltimore, Md.; Colonial Beach, Va.; Wilmington, N. C.; Fernandina, Fla.; Weeks, La.; Galveston, Tex.; San Diego, Cal.; Presidio of San Francisco, Cal., and Seattle, Wash. A similar gauge was installed at Portland, Me. The tide indicators at Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Reedy Island, Delaware Bay, Delaware; and at Alcatraz Isl.and, San Francisco, Cal., have been continued, and the electric tide indicator in the rooms of the Maritime Association, at New York, continued to give satisfaction. A similar indicator was installed in the building of the American Seamen's Friend Society's Institute, in New York City.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,
ALASKA.

1910.

Surveys were made in Portland Canal, Tongass Narrows, Cordova Bay, Controller Bay, Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet, Nushagak Bay (in 'Bristol Bay), and in the vicinity of Kodiak. The survey of Controller Bay was completed and an examination of the waters  offshore between Kayak ancf Montague Island inside of Middleton Island was made, the dangers to navigation within this area being located and their positions determined. A number of supposed dangers do not exist and have bee!! removed from the charts. On the coast of Prince of Wales Island the areas west of Mexico Point to Dewey Rocks, south to the Barrier Islands, and through Eureka Pass were carefully developed by sounding, and the hydrographic survey was extended over the area north of the Barrier Islands, including Tah and Hunter bays to the eastward and to Long Island on the west. In Cordova Bay, westward of the Barrier Islands, lines of soundings were made from a point opposite Shipwreck Point to the international boundary line to the eastward of Cape Muzon. Hydrographic and topographic' surveys were made in Tongass Narrows between Ketchikan and Rosa Reef Spindle. In Prince William Sound surveys were made along the shores of Knight and Hinchinbrook islands. The survey of Nushagak Bay, in Bristol Bay, was completed. A revised edition of the Coast Pilot Notes from Yakutat Bay to Cook Inlet was prepared and published.
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

Excellent progress was made in charting the unsurveyed coasts .of the islands, per cent of the estimated mileage of the general coast line of the islands being covered during the year. The results of the fieldwork were promptly made available at the suboffice at Manila, in the form of drawings for charts, which were forwarded to Washington for review and publication. The statistics for the year show that the triangulation covered 23 988 square miles and the hydr,ographic work 9 385 square miles. The topographic survey covered 1 708 square miles and extended along 1 637 miles of coast line. The Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Pathfimler and the insular government steamers Fathomer, Marimluque, Research, and Romblon were engaged in the work, and also parties living 6n shore. The expenses of the work were. divided between the General Government and the insular government in accordance with the agreement under which the previous work has been done. Surveys were made on the west coast of Samar, north and south coasts of Leyte, north and south coasts of Mindanao, south coast of Masbate, west and east coast of Mindoro, in Surigao and . Tanon straits, and around the Tablas Islands. Tide observations were made in connection with the hydrographic work, and a continuous record of tidal changes was obtained with self-registering gauges at Manila and Iloilo.  The organization of the work .in the Philippine Islands remains unchanged. All the work necessary for chart construction is performed at the suboffice. New editions of the sailing directions for the islands are prepared and published as often as necessary and notices to mariners are also published. Details in regard to the work are given in Appendix 1.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT. OFFICE WORK.

Progress was made in the various branches of the office work, including computation, plotting, and discussion of the results of the work in the field and the preparation of data for publication by chart or otherwise. A Supplementary Discussion of the Figure of the Earth and Isostasy was prepared, utilizing additional data to 1909. Tables of predicted tides for numerous ports on the coasts of the United States and in foreign countries fol' the year 1911 were prepared and published. Three volumes containing the results of observations at the magnetic observatories in past years were also published, and the Annual Report for 1909 was prepared for transmission to Congress. On account of the territorial expansion of the United States and the consequent extension of the sphere of the Survey's operations, there have been urgent and continually increasing demands on this Bureau for surveys and new charts. Each year adds to the number of charts published, and all of these exact time and energy to keep them up to date. The Navy Department has urgently requested that the charts of this Bureau be constructed on the mercator projection. In view of these conditions, I appointed a board to fully consider the whole subject of chart construction and publication, consisting of a chairman, Mr. G. R. Putnam, Chief of the Drawing and Engraving Division, who had given years of study to the problem, and two members, Assistants D. B. Wainwright (who succeeds Mr. Putnam as chief of division) and P. A. Welker, both experienced hydrographers, .navigators, and commanders of ships. The first charting of the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts of the United States having been practically completed and splendid progress having been made in the work in our distant territories, it was possible to consider the subject in its broadest aspect. The later charts of the Survey are examples of the best modem usage in chart construction, and they will on\y need in some cases a rearrangement of limits and the further simplification of some details to perfect them from an economical standpoint.. With respect to the charts of earlier date, the changes will have to be more radical. On these charts a great amount of detail was represented which under modem conditions is not considered necessary, and its rendering was also much more minute and elaborate than accords with present practice. Thei'r correction involves an adherence to the same timeconsuming method of representation. For twenty years all new charts have been oriented with the meridian, but there still remain a number of the earlie~ charts which were oriented diagonally with a view to include greater sea area. But for this feature they are as useful and accurate as any others. Formerly on many charts a double unit for depths was employed, fathoms for deep water and feet on dotted surfaces for the shoal areas. During the last decade the practice has been to employ a single depth unit for a chart, either feet or fathoms, depending on which unit will best suit the area represented. The difference between the mercator and polyconic projections is imperceptible on the large-scale charts, but on the small-scale charts it is very apparent, especially in northern latitudes. The board submitted a report fully covering all these points, :with recommendations which I have approved, wherein a definite program is outlined for eliminating the

12

old-style charts and for replacing them with a smaller number on the mercator projection, simpler in character, and on which the latest information can be more readily shown. The demand for charts was greater than any previous year except the preceding fiscal year, when the issue was abnormally large. A notable event of the year was the completion of a tide-predicting machine in the instrument shop of the Survey. It embraces many new features and provision has been made for 37 constituents of tidal fluctuations instead of the 19 provided for in the machine previously used. The construction of this machine has been incidental to the regular repair work of the Survey, and consequently it has been many years in progress. It was completed in February and has been tested in predicting the most complicated known tides, and the quantities obtained have been compared with the results of computation and found to be satisfactory from every point of view. The amount appropriated for the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1910, and accounted for by the bureau disbursing agent was $997 349.14 (exclusive of the appropriation for printing), of which $245 ooo was for manning and equipping the vessels of the Survey, $40 ooo for repairs and maintenance of vesseis, and $so ooo for Office expenses. The remainder of the appropriation was divided between the expenses of parties in the field ($326 400) and salaries of field and office forces ($335 890). In addition to the above sums, the appropriations to the State Department for marking the United States and Canada boundary (except a portion of the water boundary) and for locating and marking the Alaska boundary are disbursed under my direction. as Commissioner through the bureau disb!-lrsing agent, as special disbursing agent of the Department of State.

VESSELS AND THEIR WORK.
STEAMER BACH!>.

Two pairs of Welin quadrant davits were installed on the Bache at Baltimore, July 1-8, and the vessel sailed for the New England coast July 10. En route magnetic observations were made in Chesapeake Bay and at Vineyard Haven, Mass., and soundings were made in Nantucket Sound and in Pollock Rip Slue to examine certain selected areas. The vessel reached Boston on July 22 and preparations were made for repairs. Hydrographic work was done off Plymouth, Mass., July 28-31 and on August II, and off Boothbay and Portland, Me., August 19-29. During the interval between these dates details in regard to repairs were attended to, the delay in approving the contract for repairs necessitating several trips to :Boston. A hydrographic resurvey of Shank Painter Bar off Provincetown, Mass., was made September 2-4, and then the vessel went to Boston for repairs, as the condenser was in such a condition that the vessel could not be used with safety. The repairs were completed on October 7, and the vessel returned to Portland, Me. The work in this vicinity and off Portsmouh, N. H., was completed on November 6, and hydrographic work was then done in the vicinity of The Graves Light-house and at Salem, Marblehead, and Plymouth. Some minor repairs were made at Boston November 23 to December 3, and a hydrographic resurvey was then made of Pollock Rip Slue and of the shoals east of Monomoy Island. The vessel sailed for Norfolk, Va., on December 14 and was engaged on the resurvey of the approach to Hampton Roads December I 7 to February 26. On March I I the Bache sailed for Fernandina, Fla., and made off shore soundingson the coast of Florida until May 12. Hydrographic work was done off Charleston, S. C., May 15 to June 13, when the vessel returned to Boston for repairs. This work was in progress on June 30.
sTeAMl>R l>NDl>A VOR.

On July 1 the Endeavor was at work in Albemarle Sound,. N. C. This work was completed on September 27, when the vessel proceeded to Norfolk, Va., for repairs. The repairs were completed on October 20, and then chart revision work, including supplementary surveys, was done in Elizabeth and James rivers until March I2, when the work was suspended and a special survey of the Delaware Breakwater speed trial course was made as requested by the Navy Department. This survey was completedonApril 14 and the vessel went to Wilmington, Del., for repairs, but the charges were considered

excessive, and the repairs were made at Jersey City, May 1-25, the '\\'Ork being delayed by a fire which started in the engine room. On May 27 the vessel went to Buzzards Bay, Mass., and continued supplemental surveys in that bay during the remainder of the fiscal year.
SCHOONER MATCHLESS.

Repairs were made to this vessel July 1-16, and then supplemental work for chart revision was begun in Rappahannock River ~nd completed to the head of navigation above Fredericksburg on March 25. The vessel then proceeded to Annapolis, Md., and a supplementary survey was made in Severn River, March 27 to June 15. A search was made for a reported shoal in the vicinity of York Spit, Chesapeake Bay, June 20-23, and the vessel then wen.t to Newport News (June 25) for repairs to the launch. This work was in progress on June 30.
STEAMER HYDROGRAPHER.

This vessel was out of commission and laid up July 1 to April 4, when she was taken to Baltimore for repairs. The repairs were completed, and on June 20 the vessel sailed for coast-pilot work on the coast of New England via Jersey City for supplies. Some hydrographic work was done at Fishing Point, Va., en route, and the vessel was at Jersey City on June 30.
STEAMER EXPLORER.

On July 1 this vessel was at work on the survey of Nushagak Bay, in Bristol Bay, Alaska, and work was continued until September 2 1, when the vessel sailed for San Francisco, Cal., via Unalaska, Alaska, and Seattle, Wash. The Explorer reached Seattle on October 8 and San Francisco on October 17. From November to March 15 the vessel was engaged in making supplemental surveys along the California coast. Repairs were made to the ship at San Francisco, and on April 23 she sailed for Bristol Bay' via Seattle. The vessel reached Port Moller, Alaska, on May 19 and was delayed there by ic~ until June 3. During this interval a general survey was made of the port. On June 4 the vessel reached Nushagak Bay and resumed the survey of the bay. The work was in progress on June 30.
STEAMER GEDNEY.

The steamer Gedney was at work on the survey'"of Cordova Bay, Alaska; on July I and the work was continued until September 17, when the vessel proceeded to Ketchikan for work in Tongass Narrows to locate a reported reef. The steamer Cosmos, the tender of the Gedney, continued work in Cordova Bay until September 25 and then joined the vessel. The work in Tongass Narrows was suspended on October 20 and the vessel proceeded to Seattle, Wash., reaching there on the 28th. Chart revision work was begun in Puget Sound with a reduced crew on December 1 and continued until March 5, when the vesssel returned to Seattle for repairs. The repairs were completed on April 10, and on April 20 the vessel sailed for Ketchikan, Alaska. Repairs were made to the Cosmos April 28 to May 20, and the Gedney then resumed work in Tongass Narrows and the Cosmos proceeded to Portland Canal to make a topographic and hydrographic survey of the head of the canal in the vicinity of Bear River. The work of both vessels was in progress on June 30.

J. F. HAYFORD, Inspector, July I to November 23; Wn.LIAM BOWIE,* Inspector, December 10 to June 30.

The duties of the Inspector were performed at the Office in Washington, where the records of the field parties were examined as they were received and an effective supervision of the work was maintained in this way. The Survey made an important contribution to the science of geodesy by the issue of two publications entitled "The Figure of the Earth and Isostasy from Measurements made in the United States" and "Supplementary Investigation in i909 of the Figure of the Earth and Isostasy." These two publications are important, because they furnish a determination of the figure and size of the earth of a high grade of accuracy, because

the methods of computing and investigating are somewhat novel, and because this investigation has established the fact that in and around the United States the condition called "isostasy" exists. The publication giving the results of the first investigation was available for distribution in August, 1909, and copies were immediately mailed to the members of the International Geodetic Association in anticipation of the meeting of the General Conference of the association in September last. The supplemental investigation, for which a large amount of additional data had become available, confirmed and strengthened the conclusions deduced in the original discussion. It should be borne in mind that practically all of the field work upon which these investigations are based was done to furnish correct geographic positions along the coast and throughout the. interior of the country for controlling surveys and engineering works undertaken by the General Government, States, cities, private corporations, and individuals. Another noteworthy event of the year in connection with the geodetic work was the issue of a preliminary publication giving th~ results of an investigation of the effect of topography and isostatic compensation upon 톞he intensity of gravity. Additional observations have been made and the investigation is in progress. 'the Texas-California triangulation was continued and 480 kilometers (300 miles) of progress was made. The precise level net of the United States was extended by the addition of I 260 kilometers (788 miles) and the relative intensity of gravity was determined in 26 selected localities.

Supervision of the work was maintained by an examination of the records of the parties in the field as they were transmittl:'d to the Office from time to time. as the work progressed. The activity of the Survey in magnetic work may be. summarized as follows:
OBSERVATORY WORK.

The magnetic observatories at Cheltenham, Md.; Honolulu, Hawaii; Sitka, Alaska; and Vieques, P. R., were kept in continuous operation. The observations at the observatory formerly at Baldwin, Kans., were discontinued on October 22, 1909, and the instruments were. transferred to the building recently completed at 'fucson, Ariz. Observations at the Tucson Observatory began on November 16 and were continued during the remainder of the fiscal year. At Cheltenham the usual number of magnetic storn1s were recorded. The one on September 25 was exceptionally severe and caused the greatest variations in the magnetic elements ever recorded at this observatory. Special observations were made in connection with similar work abroad from May 15 to 20, the period during which the earth passed through the tail of Halley's comet, but no de.finite result was obtained which can be ascribed to the comet's proximity to the earth.

As usual, the magnetic work at sea was incidental to the regular surveying work of the vessels, and the observations were made when the vessels were en route to and from the different fields of work or when there was a suitable opportunity during the working season. OFFICE OF THE DISBURSING AGENT.
ScoTT NESBIT, Disbursing Agent.

The Disbursing Office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has charge of all of the appropriations made for that service and, in addition, the appropriations made to the State Department for the survey and marking of the United States and Canada boundary and of the boundary between Alaska and Canada. The extremely wide field of work covered by these appropriations compels payments to be made in all parts of the United States, including Alaska, Porto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippine Islftnds. The services of more than 70 bonded chiefs of parties are required to make these payments at the remote points occupied by the working parties of this Survey, both on land and sea. All of the public funds used by these officers are advanced from the central Disbursing Office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the resulting bookkeeping and auditing are done in that office. Necessarily a very extensive line of correspondence results, as, in addition to all pay and salaries, the manning, equipping, outfitting, and repairing of the vessels .of the Survey, the purchase and sale of clothing and small stores, the system of allotments made by seamen and other employees, and the entire expense of the field work of the Service, which is both extensive and varied, and the survey and marking of the two boundary lines mentioned, are financed entirely from the central Disbursing Office. The above-mentioned chiefs of parties are bonded in the sums of from $2 000 to $10,000 each, and, while acting as chiefs of parties, these officers receive from time to time such advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent as are approved by the Superintendent and are required to meet the necessary current expenses of the work in hand. A ledger account is kept in the office of the Disbursing Agent with each chief of party receiving an advance of public funds, each one being charged with all advances made

to him and, on the other hand, receiving credit for all proper expenditures made by him, when presented on regularly supported vouchers, after such accounts have been audited in the office of the Disbursing Agent, found to be correct, and app,roved by the Superintendent of the Survey. All of these accounts, after they have received the administrative examination required by law in the office of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, are, with their supporting vouchers, sent through the Department of Commerce and I,abor to the Auditor for the State and other Departments for examination and audit by him. This system has met the needs of this Survey and results, in the main, in economy and good order in its expenditures. A very large proportion of the appropriations named is now being expended in ~he survey of the most remote waters of Alaska and the Philippine Islands, and in the survey and marking of the boundary between Alaska and Canada, far in the interior of that territory.

OFFICE OF EDITOR OF PUBLICATIONS.
The Annual Report of the Superintendent (pp. 1-184), covering the progress of the work of the Survey dutjng the fiscal year 1909, was completed and sent to the Public Printer, through the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, on September 21, 1909, and the last proof was read and returned to the printer on January 4, 1910.

New jersey: Boonton and Trenton. New York: Carmel. Pennsylvania: Easton and Norristown.

The extension of the magnetic survey of the country was resumed in Iowa on July During this period the stations in Iowa named above were occupied and observations were made to determine the value of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism. Work was resumed June 13 in Pennsylvania and observations were made at the stations in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania named above. The work was in progress on June 30.
IS and the work was continued until September 13.
NORTH CAROLINA AND VIRGINIA.

[J. B. BOUTELLE. Commanding Steamer End'eavor.]
SUMMARY OF RF;SULTS.-Hydrography: 235 miles of lines sounded, 15 003 soundings made, 4 tide stations occupied. Topography: 2 square miles of area covered, 140 miles of shore line surveyed, 5 miles of road surveyed, I topographic sheet completed. Triangulation: 544 square miles of area covered, 58 stations occupied, 70 geographic positions determined.

On July 1 the party on the steamer Endeavor was engaged in revising and supplementing the survey of Albemarle Sound, North Carolina. This work was continued until September 27, and during this period a new triangulation was extended over the sound from Durant Island to the head of the sound and continued up Chowan River to a point a short distance above Montrose. The shore line on both sides of .the sound is receding, and none of the triangulation stations used in the previous work were recovered between Durant Island and Edenton. Five old, triangulation stations along Chowan River were recovered and used in the new work. A long railroad bridge is being constructed across the sound at Skinners Point, and the geographic positions of the range towers at the ends of the bridge were determined. On September 29 the yessel left Edenton, N. C., for. Norfolk, Va., for repairs. The revision of the survey of Nansemond River from its mouth to Suffolk was begun on October 20 and completed on December 10.
*Meridian stones set as requested by the county surveyors. 23

COAST AND GEODETIC_ SURVEY REPORT, 1910.

Three old triangulat~on stations at the mouth of the river were recovered and a few additional stations were established. From these stations a plane-table triangulation was extended up the river to Suffolk, the survey of the shore line was revised, and soundings were made in the channel of the river. After December 10 the party was engaged _in revising the survey of James River until March 17, when the work was suspended, as the vessel was needed for other duty. During this period a number of the old triangulation stations were recovered and supplementary work was done to complete the triangulation of the river up to the mouth of the Chickahominy River. A resurvey was made of the shore line and supplementary hydrographic work was done in order to determine the existing conditions in the channel. The information necessary for a revised edition of the charts covering the locality was secured. Supplemental surveys were begun by the party on the Endeavor on May 31 in Buzzards Bay, Mass., and the work was in progress on June 30. Seven old triangulation stations were recovered and 8 new stations we~e established for use in the hydrographic work. Serious delay was caused by the rainy and foggy weather which prevailed in June.
MARYLAND.

[J. E. BURBANK.]

The work at the magnetic observatory at Cheltenham, Md., was continued without interruption during the year. A practically continuous record of the relative force of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism was obtained and observations to determine absolute values for the three elements were made at regular intervals. There was a.n exceedingly severe magnetic storm on September 25, with a greater disturbance of the magnets than has occurred since the observatory was established, in 1901. The variations in the earth's magnetic intensity were so violent and so-sudden that it was impossible to keep the vertical intensity magnets in position for any considerable length of time, and the Eschenhagen intensity magnet was repeatedly unbalanced. The Eschenhagen declination magnet and the Adie horizontal intensity (Bifilar) and declination magnets all remained in operation during the storm, but the ranges were beyond the limits of the paper on the recording apparatus and a considerable loss of record occurred. The seismograph afforded good results, and 40 earthquakes were recorded, nearly all of which were at distant points and the resulting motion was very slight at this station.

[R. B. DBRICKSON. Commanding Steamer Gedney.]

Supplementary surveys and .the collection of information for the revision of the charts covering Puget Sound and adjacent waters were begun on December 1 and continued until March 9. The localities named below were visited and sheets were prepared to show all changes necessary to bring the charts up to date: Olympia (survey of water front, including improvements in Budd Inlet), Boston Harbor, Shelton, Pickering Pass and Hammersley Inlet, head of Cases Inlet, Vaughn Bay, lower portion of 텰ases Inlet, Hope Island and mainland adjoining Puget Sound, Puget, Tituse Bay, Von Gelderns and Mayo coves in Carrs Inlet, head of Carrs Inlet, along the shores of Colvos Passage, McNeil and Fox islands, and the mainland adjoining Puget Sound, Dupont powder works, and Anderson Island. The work was suspended on March 9 in order to make repairs to the vessel and to prepare for work in Alaska.
CALIFORNIA.

[W. C. DIBRBLL, Commanding Steamer Explorer.]
SUMMARY OF RBSULTS.-Hydrography: 358 square miles of area covered, 790 miles of lines sounded, 6<)5 soundings made, 2 tide stations occupied, 7 hydrographic sheets completed, 185 miles of lines run with submarine sentry set covering 5 square miles of area, i8 miles of lines run with wire drag set covering z square mile of area. Triangulation: 8 square miles of area covered, 9 stations occupied, 4 geographic positions determined.

The party on the steamer Explorer was engaged November 3 to March 13 in searching for reported dangers to navigation along the coast of California and in doing supplemental work for chart correction. A search was made for a reported sunken rock off Fort Ross. The locality was covered by a survey and no evidence of this danger was found. A hydrographic survey was made of an area of small extent off Montara Point to develop Colorado Reef. An examination was made off Point Surin in the vicinity of the charted position of the so-called "Alert Bank," and it was shown that this "bank" does not exist. The soundings were extended out to the 100-fathom curve. A pinnacle
*Magnetic observations were also made.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1910.

rock in the approach to Port San Luis was located and its geographic position determined. Soundings were made over the area in its immediate vicinity. A search was made off Point Arguello for a bank, reported by the U.S. S. St. Louis, but no indications of it were found and the soundings show that no bank exists in the position reported. Soundings were made out to a depth of 1 oo fathoms. A line of soundings was run parallel to the coast, between Point Piedras Blancas and Point Buchon, outside of the soundings shown on the chart, the soundings being made at intervals of 4 or 5 miles, while en route from San Francisco to Port San Luis. Supplemental triangulation was done to determine the position of hydrographic signals in the vicinity of Fort Ross and Montara Point, and the geographic position of the light-house at Port San Luis was determined. From November 26 to January 2 Assistant Paul C. Whitney was in command of the vessel, and during this period chart-revision work in San Francisco Bay was done. Field work closed on March I4 in order to prepare the ship for work in Alaska.
VIRGINIA.

[W. B. FAIRFIELD.]

March 6-18 the geographic position of the light-house on Ragged Point (Potomac River), Virginia, was determined by triangulation. Three old triangulation stations in the vicinity were recovered and observations were made from these stations to determine the position of the light-house.
MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA.

[O. W. FERGUSON, Commanding Schooner Matchless.] SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Hydrography: 179 square miles of area covered, 733 miles of lines ~nded, 30 657 soundings made, ro tide stations occupied, 3 hydrographic sheets completed. Topography: 42 square miles of area covered, 100 miles of shore line surveyed, 171 miles of shore line of creeks surveyed, 7 miles shore line of ponds surveyed, 65 miles of roads surveyed, 13 topographic sheets completed. Triangulation: 9 square miles 톙f area covered, I I stations occupied, 8 geographic positions determined.

July 23 and 24 the Matchless made a supplemental topographic survey at Point Lookout, Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, covering 3 miles of the shore line of the point, and then proceeded to the Rappahannock River, Virginia, to revise the survey of the river from the mouth to the head of tide water, a point 2~ miles above Fredericksburg, to secure the data necessary to bring the charts of the river up to date. The work included plane-table 톞riangulation, topography, and hydrography, and it was completed during the period July 26 to December 22. The chart-revision work was then extended to the creeks tributary to the Rappahannock River, and this portion of the work was completed on March 25. An examination was made in I 9 creeks and the work extended from one-half to 9 miles above the mouths. Serious delay resulted from ice in the river. On March 26 the vessel sailed for Annapolis, Md., to do supplementary work for chart revision in Annapolis Harbor and the entrance to the Severn River. This work began on April 1 and was completed June I 7. Several of the old triangulation stations were recovered and supplemental triangulation was extended from these stations to cover

the harbor and to determine the geographic positions of all prominent objects in Annapolis. The tidal bench mark at Greenbury Point Light-house was recovered and a tide staff was erected at that place. Another staff was placed near the southe:ist corner of the Naval Academy grounc;Is and the reference plane for sounding previously established at Greenbury Point Light-house was transferred to the new position by simultaneous observations at intervals of fifteen minutes for a period of twenty-four hours. All the tidal bench marks in Annapolis were searched for, but only three could be recovered. These.were connected by leveling with the Naval Academy Standard bench mark, with a bench mark on the court-house established by the United States Geological Survey and with two new bench marks which were established. A resurvey was made of the shore line with a plane table and a hydrographic resurvey qf the harbor with current observations in the entrance to Severn River. On June 17 the vessel sailed for Newport News, Va., and stopped en route at Mobjack Bay to make an examination of the shoal 4;{ miles southeast of York Spit Light-house. The work was completed on June 23, the vessel reached her destination on the 25th, and oi1 the 30th was making preparations to begin chart-revision work in James River.
NEW YORK.

[E. G. FISCHER.)

In September a tide indicator was installed in the building of the American Seamen's Friend Society's Institute at 507 West street, New York City. An electrical transmitter was placed in position on Pier 51 and connected by wire with the indicator. A steel float tube. was used, with the float resting on 6 feet of kerosene to prevent the water from freezi.ng in the tube in cold weather. An inspection 9f the tide gauge at Fort Hamilton was made and the tide staff was referred to adjacent bench marks by leveling. In the following April a mechanician was sent to New York to make some necessary repairs to the indicator and transmitter and the apparatus was again left in good order. The tide indicator in the rooms of the Maritime Association was inspected and some repairs were made to the transmitter on Pier "A." An inspection of the tide gauge at Fort Hamilton was again made, and some instruction was given to the observer who was temporarily in charge of the gauge.
MARYI,AND AND VIRGINIA.

[S. FORNEY.) SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Hydrography: 13 square miles of area covered, 136 miles of lines sounded, 3 744 soundings made, 3 tide stations occupied, :i hydi:ographic sheets completed. Topography: 44 square miles of area covered, 42 miles of shore line surveyed, 60 miles of shore line of creeks surveyed, 134 miles of roads surveyed, 4 topographic sheets completed. Triangulation: 42 stations occupied and 48 geographic positions determined. 

On July 1 the topographic resurvey of the western shore of Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries was in progress between Dividing Creek and Smith Point. The work was continued during the summer and completed on August 3 1.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1910.

A hydrographic resurvey of Great Wicomico River and Cockrills Creek was then made, the work extending to the head of steamboat navigation on Great Wicomico River and to Reedville, Va., on Cockrills Creek. On October 5 the party proceeded to Chestertown, Md., to make a topographic resurvey of the river. A number of old triangulation stations were recovered and, based on these, a supplemental triangulation was extended along the river to Crumpton. The topographic resurvey was completed on February 23. On December 25 and 26 a severe blizzard prevailed, with 16 inches of snow, and in January and February there was serious delay on account of ice in the river, which was closed to navigation on many days. On February 27 the party went to Wachapreague, Va., to recover old triangulation stations and do supplementary work from Cedar Island toward Cape Charles, along the eastern coast of Virginia, and to revise the survey of the shore line from Assawaman Inlet toward Cape Charles. A search was made for old stations between Wachapreague Inlet and the southern end of Cobbs Island, but they have all been destroyed. New stations were selected and marked and an attempt was made to secure observations, but unfavorable weather prevailed, with rain, fog, and haze, and a complete set of observations were made at only one station. At the end of May work on the triangulation was suspended and the party began the revision of the shore line along the coast south of Assawaman Inlet. This work was in progress at the end of June in the vicinity of Paramore Life Saving Station. Notable changes have occurred at several points.

SUMMARY oF RESULTS.-Hydrography: 28 miles of lines sounded, l 824 ~undings made, l tide station occupied. Reconnaissance: 105 square miles of area covered, 41 stations selected. Topography: I square mile of area covered, 2 miles of coast line surveyed, 2 miles of roads and railroads surveyed. Triangulation: 58 square miles of area covered, 29 stations occupied, n4 geographic positions determined.

Chart revision work on Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, was in progress on July l in the vicinity of Wellfleet. The work was continued until September 16, when work assigned was completi;d. The revision covered the area shown on one of the coast charts. The observer reports as follows:
It was quite surprising to me to find such accuracy in these old (topographic] sheets. Although some of them were made more than sixty years ago, the details were still true except where there was no doubt about there having been an actual change in the topography since the original sheet was constructed.

Six triangulation stations were occupied and the geographic positions of a number of prominent objects were determined. A search was made for 107 old triangulation stations; 35 of these were recovered and 69 have been destroyed. A search was also made for 20 tidal bench marks, l 3 of which were recovered and 5 have been destroyed. On December r l preparations began for a revision of the charts of the Hawaiian Islands. The records of the Hawaiian government survey, made before the annexation of the islands, were examined and some supplementary triangulation was done in the

vicinity of Honolulu. The original records of the trigonometric work on Oahu were sent to Washington and abstracts of similar records on the other islands were made where the books contained records of local 톣ork and were frequently needed in Honolulu. In February a survey was made of Nahukona Harbor, island of Hawaii, in accordance with an urgent request for the work. Mr. R. R. Elgin, manager of the Hawaiian Railway Company, transported the party between the triangulation stations in his automobile and showed the party many other courtesies. The railway company also furnished other transportation and such assistance as was required. In March preparations were made for a trigonometric connection . between the islands of Oahu and Kauai, but there was no suitable weather before the end of the fiscal year in which observations could be made over the long lines involved in this connection. Observers were readv on both of these islands after March 14, and while waiting for suitable weather the .observer on Kauai made a reconnaissance around the island and later extended a triangulation along the shore about halfway around the island, covering the east end. During the progress of this work the positions of numerous points were determined for use in the hydrographic survey which will be made later. The computations connected with the survey of Mahukona Harbor were completed and a drawing in the form of a chart was made. Copies of this drawing were furnished to the Hawaiian Railway Company as authorized. The abstracts of the observations in the old triangulation on the islands of Molokai, Maui, and Lanai, and more than half of the work on Hawaii, were completed. A reconnaissance was also made to extend a triangulation around the island of Oahu.

SUMMARY OF RUSULTS.-Hydrography: 77 square miles of area covered with wire drag, 490 miles of lines covered with wire drag, 141 soundings made, 5 tide stations occupied, 7 current stations occupied, 7 hydrographic sheets completed.

On July 1 a party was organized to examine certain waters on the coast of Maine with a wire drag. The area examined included the southern end of West Penobscot Bay, Hurricane Sound, portions of Muscle Ridge and Two Bush channels, part of East

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1910.

Penobscot Bay, the channel south of Vinalhaven Island, and a special examination in Eggemoggin Reach. Several changes in the drag and the method of using it greatly facilitated the work and increased the area possible to be covered in any given time. A drag 8 400 feet long was used, but it was found that motor power was necessary to turn the reels in taking up a drag longer than 6 ooo feet, and consequently the shorter length was regularly used in open water. By using buoys with a hoisting apparatus attached, changes of depth to allow for the state of the tide were made without stopping the drag. In order to prevent their destruction, it was necessary to have many thousands of lobster pots removed from the areas to be examined. These areas were marked by spar buoys in advanc~ and notice was given to the .lobster fishermen to remove their pots. The buoys were removed as soon as the examination was completed. The increased length of the drag and other improvements in its construction and the method of using it greatly reduced the cost of the work. On October 30 the work on the coast of Maine was discontinued and the party was divided into two sections, one of which was sent to Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, and the other to Gardiners Bay, Long Island, New York. Examinations with the drag in Buzzards Bay were made November 5-16, and the work was then discontinued for the winter on account of unfavorable weather conditions. At Gardiners Bay an examination was made of the northeastern approach and numerous bowlders were found in the channel with less water on them than the charted depths indicated. This work was also discontinued on November I6, on account of unfavorable weather, and resumed on May I6, when the examination was extended over Plum Gut and a portion of Gardiners Bay, as well as in the channel mentioned above. On June 9 the party proceeded to Rockland, Me., and the work was in progress in that locality on June 30.

On July 1 the extension of the triangulation along the coast of Washington was in progress and the work was continued until August 3 1. During this period a reconnaissance was also made from Grays Harbor toward Puget Sound to connect with previous work, and up the coast from Grays Harbor to Destruction Island for the extension of the triangulation to the points mentioned. The triangulation was done by Mr. Rekate under Mr. Hill's direction, and he also prepared 6 stations for the observing party by opening lines through th~ timber and by building observing tripods and scaffolds where necessary. On September 1 the charge of the work was transferred to Mr. Rekate and he continued to prepare stations for the observing party until November I2, when the work .was suspended for the winter. Lines were opened and other preparations were made, such as opening trails, etc., at 6 stations: At some of them there was a dense growth of timber and the work of c:ipening the lines of sight was very laborious.

times as were required to make repairs to the ship and to sail between the different localities where work was required. The following is a brief summary of the work completed, stated in chronological order: On July IO the Bache sailed from Baltimore for the coast of New England. Magnetic observations were made at sea off the mouth of the Patuxent River in Chesapeake Bay, and at a point about 9 miles WSW. from Vineyard Sound Light-vessel anp also on shore at Vineyard Haven. July 17 to 19 was spent in searching for a shoal spot reported to the southeastward of Bishop and Clerk Light-house, and soundings were also made on the east and west sides of Monomoy Island, Massachusetts. On July 22 magnetic observations were made on shore on Castle Island, Boston Harbor, and hydrographic work was done in the approacies to the harbors of Plymouth a,nd Duxbury until August 14, and on that date magnetic observations were made at a station on shore at Long Beach. On August 19 the Bache proceeded to Boothbay Harbor, Maine, and five days were spent searching for a reported ledge in Fisherman Island Passage. The vessel reached Portland, Me., on August 24 and prepared for hydrographic work in the harbor. A tide gauge was established on Little Diamond Island and supplementary triangulation was done to determine the positions of 'hy.drographic signals. On the 29th the Bache returned to Boston for repairs, but the contract for the work had not been approved and soundings were made on Shank Pointer Bar near Provincetown until September 4, when the work was completed and the Bache went to Boston for repairs. On October 8 the vess.el returned to Portland, l\fe., and completed the work in the harbor the following day. Soundings were made in the approaches, from the northward and eastward, to the harbor of Portsmouth, N. H., between October IO and November 6, and after that date the examination of a shoal spot reported in the approach t0 Salem Harbor was continued at intervals when the weather permitted until November 23, when the work was suspended and minor repairs were made to the ship. On December 5 the vessel sailed from Boston for Pollock Rip Slue. En route a few additional soundings were made off Plymouth. The examination of Pollock Rip Slue was completed on December 11 and the vessel started to Norfolk, Va. On December 7 the three-masted schooner Nat 1\feader was found at anchor near Pollock Rip Shoals Light-vessel, in distress as the result of a collision, and the schooner was towed to Hyannisport. On December 21 supplemental hydrographic work began in the approaches to Hampton Roads and was continued until March 11, when it was completed and the ves~el sa_iled for Fernandina, Fla., for offshore hydrographic work in the latitude of St. Marys Entrance. This work was continued until May 13, when the ship proceeded to Charleston, S.

The construction of a magnetic ohservatory near Tucson, Ariz., was in progress on July, I, as stated in the previous annual report. The officer in charge was fatally injured in line of duty on July 3 by falling into the well (for water) which was being dug under his direction, and ~ssistant Mueller was instructed to complete the work. He took . charge on July 1 2 and completed the work on October 29. The buildings are located on a tract of 160 acres of the public land reserved for an observatory site by Executive Order No. 1082, dated June 3, 1909, on the Aguas Calientes, or Rincon road, about 8 miles east of Tucson. Two observatory buildings were constructed, one for the relative measure of the magnetic variations with a self-registering magnetograph, and the other for making observations to determine the absolute value of the three magnetic elements. An office building, including living accommodations for the observers, was erected, a well was dug, and a stable was built. En route to Washington an inspectipn of the tide station at Galveston, Tex., was made November 3-6, and necessary repairs were made, including a new float well; a new self-registering gauge was placed in position. January 7 and 8 a location for a self-registering tide gauge was selected at Portland, Me., and preliminary arrangements were made for the construction of the gauge house.

The collection of data for the revision of the charts along the coasts of Connecticut and New York was in progress on July l, !l.nd this work was continued at intervals, when other duties of the observer permitted, during the whole year. All the principal topographic changes since the previous survey of this region was made were noted on the north shore of Long Island Sound between Georges Island and Sheffield, including Saugatuck and Norwalk rivers, and drawings were prepared showing the corrections necessary to bring chart No. 267 to date. Similar work on the adjoining chart No. 268 (extending from Sheffield Island to Westcott Cove), begun during the previous fiscal year, was completed. A topographic resurvey was made of the shore line in front of New Haven, Conn., from Oyster River Point to Five Mile Point, and the revision of topographic details for chart correction was extended from Five Mile Point to East Haven River. A topographic resurvey was also made along the south shore of Long Island between Edgemere and Rockaway Beach, and similar work between Long Beach and Edgemere was completed. In connection with the work mentioned above l l 5 old triangulation stations, in the localities covered by the topographic revision, were recovered and remarked in cases where it was considered necessary to do so.

Under the authority of a special act of Congress and in response to a request from the governor of North Carolina an officer of the Su~ey placed marks to indicate the boundaries of certain areas in the waters of the State "in which the use of any or all fishing appliances are prohibited by law." Certain areas in Pamlico, Croatan, and Albemarle sounds and in Chowan River were selected, and the limits proscribed by law were laid down on charts prepared for the purpose. This includes the proscribed areas at Hatteras, New, and Oregon inlets. The marks were then established at the proper places in the waters mentioned above to indicate the boundaries defined by law. Sixtysix marks were established at the points selected, and the positions are defined by magnetic bearings to known positions of aids to navigation and of objects on shore, and to adjacent boundary marks. . . The work began on December 14 and was completed on February 19. The launch used in the work was furnished by the North Carolina Fish Commission.

Supplementary triangulation was in progress along the coast south of Delaware Bay on July 1, and this work was continued until November 12. The triangulation was extended from Delaware Bay, Del., to Ocean City, Md., and from Chincoteague Bay to Wachapreague, Va. Very few of the old. triangulation stations were recovered on the first section of the work, and consequently new stations were 톏stablished all along the coast in the localities mentioned. The geographic positions of 톝everal life-saving stations and numerous prominent objects along the coast were determined. . On the second section more old stations were recovered, but a new station was established wherever an old station could not be found to make the triangulation continuous. Supplementary triangulation, including the determination of the geographic positions of aids to navigation and the recovery of all old triangulation stations was begun on the west coast of Florida in Apalachicola Bay on January 14. In the West Pass to the bay the positions of 5 aids to navigation were determined, and connection was made with t_he work of the Engineer Corps, U. S. Army, in this vicinity. The positions of 2 aids to navigatiOn in the vicinity of Ap~lachicola and of 4 in the vicinity of Carrabelle were also determined. Work was then begun in Apalachee Bay, and a search was made for 32 of the triangulation points previously established. Nineteen of these were recovered, and additional marks were placed in position wherever they were needed to secure future recovery of the stations. This work was completed on March 14, and the party then proceeded to St. Andrews Bay. A search was made for the old triangulation stations in this vicinity and 4 of them were recovered. From these a new triangulation was extended to cover St. Andrews Bay, including West and North bays and St. Andrews Sound to St. Andrew Point, and this work was completed on May r. The work in St. Joseph Bay was then taken up and was completed on June 15, when the party was disbanded. A few old triangulation stations were recovered and used as a base from which a tria~gulation was extended to cover the bay. The observer then returned to Apalachicola to secure some additional observations in that vicinity, and the work for the season closed on June 22.

A continuous record of the variations in the earth's magnetic condition was obtained at the magnetic observatory near Honolulu, Hawaii, during the year with self-registering instruments. Observations were made once each week to determine the absolute value of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism, and once each month to determine the scale values. The seismograph was kept in operation and a practically continuous record was obtained. Ninety-four earthquakes were registered during the year at this station. Daily meteorological observations were made and monthly reports were sent to the United States Weather Bureau observer at Honolulu.

The buildings for the magnetic observatory located near Tucson, Ariz., were completed in October and the instruments in use at the Baldwin Observatory, in Kansas, were transferred to the Tucson Observatory. They were placed in position and the final adjustments were completed on November 16. On the same date the observations began and a continuous record of the relative force of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism was obtained during the remainder of the fiscal year.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1910.

Observations to determine the absolute value of the magnetic elements were made once each week, and aftet January 1 an additional determination of the vertical intensity was made every week. Meteorological observations were made every day. A room for the installation of a seismograph was completed. The magnetograms show the effects of earthquake shocks as follows: Twice in January, once in February, once in April, three times in May, and once in June.
DELAWARE.

[P. A. WELKER, Commanding Steamer Endeavor.]
SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Hydrography: 6 square miles of area covered, 141 miles of lines sounded, x 96o soundings made, 1 hydrographic sheet completed.

In accordance with a request made by the Navy Department, a special hydrographic survey was made over the speed trial course off Delaware Breakwater in order to afford data desired in determining the effect of the depth of water upon the speed and power developed in certain cases. The depth of water on this course is 25 fathoms and more, and the strength of the current varies from 1 to 3 knots per hour. Under these conditions a lead weighing 40 pounds was used with a trolley system which made it possible to drop the lead near the bow and to read the lead line near the stern of the ship. Soundings were made at intervals of two minutes and the position.of each sounding was determined by observations made with sextants. The work began on March 22 and was completed on April 2. After completing the survey of the speed trial course a survey was made at Cape Henlopen to show the present condition of the shoal off the cape and the position of the shore line. The limit of the hydrography was within the lines of breakers under ordinary conditions, and where there are strong tide rips, so that the soundings were necessarily made when the sea was smooth and near the time of slack water. The work was completed on April 14.

[FERDINAND \VESTDAHL.)

The suboffice at San Francisco was continued and the officer in charge acted as the representative of the Superintendent in attending to numerous duties, many of them being matters of routine, in connection with the survey of the Philippine Islands and the transfer of officers assigned to that work. In addition to these duties the field work described below was done under the, direction of this officer by others who reported to him for this purpose. In July the position of the tide staff at the Presidio tidal station was verified by leveling to the bench marks in the vicinity. The revision of the topographic survey along the coast of Mendocino County between Laguna and Greenwood landings began on August 11 and was completed on November 16. In connection with this work a search was made for a sunken rock which was supposed to exist in Albion Cove, and it was shown that no such rock exists. In October repairs were made at the Presidio tidal stations and to the tide indicator on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay.

Under authority conferred by law, the Survey continued to cooperate with the Maryland Shell-Fish Commission in surveying and marking the natural oyster bed~, bars, and rocks in the State of Maryland. The field work undertaken by ihe Survey was finished during the year in Kent and Talbot counties, which completes the wor\{ in all the producing counties in the State except Dorchester, and on June 30 the party was ready to begin work in that county. Field work was done during the periods July 6 to December '24 and March 14 to June 30. The descriptions of the boundaries and landmarks in Calvert County were prepared for publication.

[F. L. ADAMS.]

The work at the Sitka Magnetic Observatory was continued during the year and a record of the variation in the relative value of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism was obtained with self-registering instruments. Observations to determine the absolute value of the magnetic elements were made at regular intervals and meteorological observations were also made. Severe magnetic storms occurred in September, October, November, and March. The magnetic storm of September 25 was very severe and was accompanied by a very fine auroral display. A seismograph was kept in operation and 47 earthquake shocks were recorded.
[H. L. BECK, Commanding Steamer McArthur.]

The steamer McArthur sailed from Seattle for Cook Inlet, Alaska, on April 19, via the inside passage. No pilot was taken and the vessel anchored at night. Good weather prevailed, and nothing unusual occurred except that the vessel grounded for a few minutes on an uncharted shoal in Wrangell Narrows. The vessel reached Seldovia on May 4 and the launch Delta, which had been hauled out for the winter at this place was prepared for the season's work. A self-registering tide gauge was installed on the wharf at Seldovia and kept in operation. North Spit Buoy No. 1, off Port Graham, was replaced in position in accordance with the request of the inspector of the Thirteenth light-house district. The preceding winter was unusually cold and the snow still extended from the hill and mountain tops down to the water's edge, but the field work began on May 12, when a party was placed in camp on shore, with the Delta and a dory as their means of transportation, to do inshore hydrographic work and to make a survey of the shore line. Hydrographic signals were erected by the ship and offshore sounding began on the 23d. On account of the strong tidal currents it was found to be impossible to run sounding lines normal to the shore in satisfactory manner, and lines parallel to the shore were substituted. Details in regard to the work and statistics of the work accomplished will be given in the next report. The work was in progress on June 30, 1910.
[H. C. DENSON, Commanding Steamer Patterson.] SuMMARY OF RESULTS.-Hydrography: 4 883 square miles of area covered, 3 643 miles of lines sounded, 44 871 soundings made, I tide station occupied, 6 hydrographic sheets completed..

The hydrography covers the area bounded by Montague and Hinchinbrook islands on the west, Copper River Sand Reefs on the north, Kanak, Wingham, and Kyak islands on the east, and Middleton Island on the south. A detailed survey was made of Controller Bay and approaches, and also of the area eastward of Kyak Island to Cape Suckling, and out to the 'Ioo-fathom depth to the southward of Cape St. Elias. 1'he position of a number of dangers to navigation in this region were accurately located and many others, marked on the charts as possible dangers, have been removed, as the investigation proved that these reported dangers do not exist. The charts of this region have been corrected, and information in regard to the more important changes has been furnished to the public in notices to mariners. In connection with the hydrographic work tide observations were made on a staff located off the north end of Kyak Island during four months. A survey was made of the shore of Controller Bay and of Wingham and Kyak islands, and along Okalee Spit as far as Cape Suckling. A running survey of the east shore of Montague Island was made from the ship by observations with sextants to determine the position of the heads of bays and of prominent headlands. The existing triangulation was supplemented and additional points were located for use in making the survey. Assistant Quillian's party and outfit was transported from Seattle to Kodiak, and the steamer Yukon was prepared for work by the crew of the Patterson. A party of 3 officers and 1 7 men was placed in camp on shore and much of the inshore work was done by this party. On October 10, while the Patterson was tied to the dock at Orea with the boilers blown down, a violent wind storm arose and cast the ship adrift. Salt water was pumped into the boilers in order to get up steam and control the ship. Fortunately the vessel was only slightly damaged. On October 26, while en route to Seattle, the vessel touched on a reef I I~ miles east of Alert Bay, Johnstone Straits, but no apparent damage resulted. Assistant Denson reports that the spring months offer the best conditions for the work of the Survey in this locality and states that after the middle of June and until the beginning of August the ship was run night and day while sounding, as the mountain peaks were distinct enough at midnight to be reflected by the sextant mirrors.

The survey of the shore line was completed from Point Nunez to Lime Point in Cordova Bay except in Nutqua and Hassa inlets, and extends into텻utqua Inlet to a point 1 mile above the entrance. The hydrographic work was done while the topographic work was in progress. A survey was made of the waters from Point Marsh south to the international bpundary 톖ine and westward to Cape Muzon, and lines were sounded in the passage back of Point Marsh and in Minnie Bay. The areas west of Mexico Point to Dewey Rocks, south to the Barrier islands, and through Eureka Pass were carefully developed by sounding, and the hydrographic survey was extended over the area north of the Barrier Islands, including Tah and Hunter bays to the eastward and to Long Island on the west. In Cordova Bay, westward of the Barrier Islands lines of soundings were made from a point opposite Shipwreck Point to the international boundary line to the eastward of Cape Muzon. The Gedney suspended work on September 17 and proceeded to Tongass Narrows .. The tender Cosmos continued at work until September 27, when she went to Ketchikan to join the Gedney. Work was done in Tongass Narrows September 17 to October 20. The rock on which the steamship Ohio struck, in June, was found and its geographic position was determined and a hydrographic survey was made in its vicinity. Hydrographic and topographic surveys were also made in Tongass Narrows from Ketchikan to ~osa Reef Spindle. _The vessel sailed for Seattle on October 2 1 and reached that port on the 28th. On April 19 the Gedney sailed from Seattle for Ketchikan, Alaska, to resume work in Tongass Narrows. Repairs were made to the tender Cosmos May 2 to 19 and on May 24 the Cosmos sailed for the head of Portland Canal to make a survey 0 the head of the canal in the vicinity of the point where the international boundary leaves Portland Canal. This work was in progress on June 30. The party on the Gedney continued the.survey of Tongass Narrows. The topographic work was completed at the north end of the 텻arrows to Point Higgins and the hydrographic work was almost completed from Bar Point to Guard Island, including Wards Cove. The survey was in progress on June 30.

and Protection. A preliminary topographic survey of the shore line was made from the entrance of the bay to the mouth of Wood River. A hydrographic survey was made of the whole of the bay except in Igushik River and the approach. Mud flats bare or partly bare at low water were not included. The main channel was surveyed up to a point just below the mouth of Wood River. Tide observations were made at Clark Point and current observations were made at a number of places in the bay where the vessel anchored. Everything possible was done by the officers and employees of the Alaska Packers' Association to advance the progress of the work and many courtesies were shown the members of the party. Mess supplies and ship stores were brought from San Francisco free of charge. The vessel sailed for Seattle, Wash., on September 21 and reached that port on October 8. On April 23 the Explorer sailed from San Francisco for Bristol Bay via Seattk and reached Port Moller, Bering Sea, on May 18. Ice was encountered near this place and it was impracticable to enter Bristol Bay at this time. The vessel was detained at Port Moller until June 3 and work was done in the vicinity while waiting for the opening of navigation in Bristol Bay. The survey of Nushagak Bay was resumed on June 4 and was in progress on the 30th.

On July r the party on the steamer McArthur was at work in the upper portion of Cook Inlet north of the Forelands. Parties were established in camp on shore, one on each side of the inlet extending the triangulation and the topographic survey of the shore line. The work during the whole season may be summarized as follows: The principal work was the triangulation, and it was extended from East and West Foreland to the head of the inlet, with stations at the entrances to 1'urnagain and Knik Arms. Twenty-eight new stations were established and carefully marked, 20 of which were occupied for the measurement of .horizontal and vertical angles, and observations were made at 5 old stations. The shore of the upper portion of Cook Inlet is, in gener~l, a bluff line heavily wooded, and heavy cutting was necessary on many of the lines, and high signals were erected at a number of stations. Directions to Mount McKinley were obtained at 3 triangulation stations and observations to determine the magnetic declination were made at 6 stations. A topographic survey was made of the east shore of the inlet from a point about s miles above Kenai to a point about 12 miles inside Knik Arm, including Fire Island and the south shore of Turnagain Arm, to a point about 4 miles above the entrance. On the west shore of the inlet the survey extends from a point about 5 miles west of West Forelands to a point about 8 miles inside of Knik Arm, except that three gaps covering a total distance of 2 r miles were left in this work. Tide observations were made at Seldovia, at a point about 2 miles above East Foreland, on the west side of Fire Island, and on the east shore of Knik Arm about 5

Hydrographic and topographic surveys along the shores of Knight Island, Prince William Sound," were resumed on July 6 and continued until September 23, when the field work closed for the winter. The work was completed along the portions of the coast described below: From the north point at the entrance to Hogan Bay to a point l mile north of the entrance to Discovery Bay and including Snug Harbor; the north end of Knight Island and the islands offshore between Knight and Naked islands; the south coast of Knight Island from Mummy Bay to Lower Herring Bay. Hydrographic work was done inshore along the east and north coasts of Knight Island to complete the work previously done along these shores, and it was extended to cover Discovery Bay, Snug Harbor, Lower Passage, Upper Passage, Foul Passage, Louis Bay, and Northwest Bay. On the south coast of Knight Island, hydrographic work was done in Mummy Bay, Long Passage, and Knight Island Passage from Mummy Bay to Lower Herring Bay, and extended to the entrances of Prince of \Vales and Bainbridge passes. In the same region a survey was made of the shore line in Mummy and Copper bays around Squire Island and through Long Passage to Drier Bay, completing the unfinished work in this locality. The survey of Prince William Sound was resumed on May 23 on the shores of Hinchinbrook Island, vicinity of Point Johnstone. The work at this point was completed on June 14 and the vessel proceeded. to Knight Island, and on June 30 the survey was in progress between Johnson Bay and Lower Passage.

PHILIPPINE: ISLANDS.

[B. F.

DICKINS,

Director.]

The survey of the coast of the Philippine Islands was continued under the immediate supervision of a Director, who represented the Superintendent in all matters requiring immediate action. He made plans for field operations and issued instructions for field work at the suboffice in Manila. The observations made in the field were computed, and drawings for charts of the regions surveyed were prepared for transmission to Washington for review and publication. Sailing Directions and Notices to Mariners were prepared and published. He was aided in this work by such advice and instructions issued from Washington as became necessary. The work was done under the same general plan of the division of expenses in force during the previous year. The National Government paid the salaries and subsistence of its technical corp~ detailed for duty in the Philippines, including several experts in the suboffice, furnished the instrumental equipment, paid the expenses of r large surveying steamer and for the supplies for 2 other surveying steamers, paid the expense of chart publication, the traveling expenses of officers to an톎 from the Philippine lslands, and the hire of launches. The Philippine government paid the operating expenses of 2 surveying steamers, paid for the crew and repairs of 2 other surveying steamers (not including pay of officers), the party expenses of several surveying parties on shore, the salaries of the office force, and for office supplies obtained in Manila, and furnished office accommodations and printing. There was a free exchange of information and good offices between the Survey and the various military and civil bureaus having common aims, and a gratifying interest was shown in responding to requests for information.

during this time extensive repairs were made. She sailed for Lion Bay on the south coast of Leyte Island on the i 2th and resumed work in that vicinity on the 16th. The survey of Sogod Bay was continued until January 4, when it was completed. The vesst:l. then proceeded to the north coast of Mindanao Island and the survey of that coast and adjacent waters was begun on January 8 and was in progress on June 30. Steamer Marinduque.-The survey of Iliana Bay on the southern coast of Mindanao Island was in progress on July 1. This work was completed and special surveys were made at Malabang and Parang as requested by the military authorities. On August 12 the vessel sailed for Manila for repairs. The repairs were made August 19 to September 12, and the vessel sailed the following day for Iligan Bay, north coast of Mindanao. The survey of the north coast of Mindanao Island was continued until June 30, when the work was still in progress. Steamer Research.-The survey of Tanon Strait was continued from July I to November 26 when the survey of the unfinished portion of this strait was completed. Minor repairs were made to the vessel at Iloilo November 27 to December 9, and on the following day she sailed for the southern coast of Masbate Island. The work on this coast began on December 11 and on June 30 the survey of the entire southern coast had been completed. Steamer Fathomer.-Surveys were made along the coasts of Mindoro and Tablas islands July 1 to December 22, when the vessel went to Manila for repairs and remained there until February 23, when she sailed for the west coast of Mindoro Island. A special survey was made of the entrance to Bugsanga River as requested by the secretary of interior of the Philippine Islands and then the survey along the shores of Mindoro was continued during the remainder of the fiscal year. In addition to the work of the parties on the ships mentioned above, surveys were made by parties living on land in San Juanico Strait and Jana,batas Channel and on the west coast of Samar Island.
PROGRESS OF THE FlELI> WORK.

At the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1910, 46.6 per cent (exclusive of Spanish and British surveys) of the general coast line of the archipelago had been surveyed for charting purposes, the progress for the fiscal year being 10.3 per cent of the whole. Expressed in distance, the total amount of general coast line now surveyed is 5 368 statute miles (8 639 kilometers) out of a total of 1 I 511 statute miles (18 525 kilometers). During the year 119 statute miles of general coast line was surveyed, an increase of 56.6 per cent as compared with the mileaie surveyed in the preceding year.
OFFICI? WORK.

The suboffice at Manila is organized to do all the work included in chart construction. The records of observations were received as the work progressed. The necessary computations were made and the results were compiled in the form of drawings for charts. Eight drawings for new charts and 13 drawings for new editions of charts were prepared during the year and sent to Washington for publication. The Director is the disbursing agent for the Philippine work, and. all expenditures, except those on account of the steamer Pathfinder, are made by him, and under his direction. He renders his accounts to the General Disbursing Agent, at Washington,

On July I the party on the steamer Mar-induque was engaged in making a survey of Iliana Bay, including hydrography in the approaches, and on August 13 the work was finished. This completed the survey of the unfinished portion of the coast of Mindanao in this locality. Special surveys were made at Malabang and Parang, as requested by the military authorities, to furnish information to aid in the establishment of docks and a sewerage system at these places. On September i 7 work began in Iligan Bay, and the survey of this bay and of Dapitan Bay were completed by the end of January, and the work was then extended westward to Point Blanco, in the vicinity of Disacan. The triangulation was extended to include points on Negros, Siquijor, Cebu, Panglao, Bohol, and Camiguin islands, to a junction with work previously completed. Many of the lines of sight were unusually long, and it was necessary to use heliotropes at the stations.

Triangulation: 6 863 square miles of area covered, 72 stations occupied, 178 geographic positions (including 9 aids to navigation) determined.

On Ju1y 1 the survey of the east coast of Mindoro Island was in progress and the work was continued until December 31, when the F athomer went to Manila for repairs. During this period the triangulation was extended to cover the east coast of Mindoro from Buyallao Point (latitude 12 17') to Dumali Point (latitude 13 13') and to include points on Maestro de Campo, Dos Hermanas, Banton, Simara, Cobrador, Romblon, and Tablas islands. 'l'he topographic survey covers the coast of "Mindoro within the limits of the triangulation and the shore line and interior of the small islands mentioned and about half of the area of Tahlas Island. The hydrographic work covers waters along the coast of Mindoro, within the limits mentioned above, and was extended offshore to Tablas Island, covering the northwestern and northern shores of that island and the waters around Samara and Banton islands. A hydrographic survey was made around Dos Hermanas Islands. Triangulation stations were selected to extend the work southward to a connection with Panay and the islands offshore. All the work mentioned is an extension southwarp of a survey previously completed. On February 23 the Fa/homer went to the west coast of Mindoro and made a !!pecial survey of the entrance to Bugsanga River as requested hy the secretary of interior of th~ Philippine Islands. The survey of the cast coast of Mindoro was then taken up and extended southward from the point reached in December. The triangulation was extended around the south end of the island to Bugsanga River and lines were observed to connect with stations on Panay, Caluya, and Panagatan islands. Positions were determined on a number of islands along the coast. The topographic work was extended from Buyallo Point on the east coast to Lumintao River on the west coast, and covers the shore line of 5 large bays and 9 small islands, and also Ilin and Ambolon islands. The hydrographic survey covers the inshore work within the limits of the topography except for a distance of 3 miles where the work was not completed. The offshore work was completed to a line 10 miles distant from the mouth of Lumintao River. It also extends to a line 3 miles off Ambolon Island and thence to Panagatan Island, covering the passage between Ilin, Panagatan, Cemerara islands and Dominga Shoal. A self-registering tide gauge was maintained in Looc Bay, Tablas Island, and observations were also made at 8 other stations, and all the stations were connected by simultaneous observations.

finished before the close of the previous season, and only four stations remained to be occupied. The survey of the bay was resumed on November i6 and completed on January 4. A topographic survey was made along the shores of the bay joining similar work previously completed on both the west and east sides of the bay near the entrance. The topographic survey was extended to cover entire west shore of Panaon Island. The hydrographic survey of the bay was also completed. The work covers the whole bay and extel}.ds along the west coast of Panaon Island for a short distance offshore to a junction with work previously completed. Tide observations were made at Tabogon during the progress of the hydrographic work. "The survey of the north coast of Mindanao Island was begun on January 8 and continued until May 4. During this period the survey of Btituan Bay was completed and the survey was extended along the eastern shore of Surigao Sea to the north point of Mindanao Island.  The triangulation and topographic work along the coast was completed and the hydrographic work was extended about 2 miles offshore. The shore line. is practically straight and there are no shoals.  Heliotropes were used at the stations of the main scheme of triangulation in order to make the observations over the longest lines with as little delay as possible. In connection with the hydrographic work, tide observations were made on a tide staff established at Bilan Bilan, near Surigao, and later a self-registering tide gauge was installed in ~asipit Harbor. These three stations were connected by simultaneous observations made on ten days.

The work of the party on the steamer Pathfinde,- was done during two periods, the first lasting from July 19 to January 15 and the second from March 29 to June 30. During the year a trigonometric connection was made between Samar, Homonhon, Leyte, Dinagat, Panaon, Limasaua, and Mindanao island~ and the triangulation was extended to cover Surigao Passage and Strait. A topographic survey was completed along the eastern coast of I,eyte from latitude 10 40' to Panaon Strait and thence along the entire eastern coast of Panaon Island, and along the western coast of Dinagat Island and the northern coast of Mindanao Island. The topographic survey covered many of the small islands in Surigao Passag_e and adjacent waters and also a considerable portion of the south end of Dinagat Island. The hydrographic survey covers Surigao Strait and Passage, including a com>iderable area north of the strait and offshore to the eastward of the north end of Dinagat Island and also along the north coast of Mindanao Island. . In connection with the triangulation the geographic positions and elevations of numerous peaks in the mountains were determined. An excellent anchorage for safety in typhoons was found in Tagbabui Bay, which lies about 5 miles to the eastward of

The work at the magnetic observatory at Vieques, P. R., was continued during the year and a practically continuous record of the relative value of the three clements of terrestrial magnetism was obtained with self-registering instruments. Observations were made twice each week to determine the absolute value of the magnetic elements. A remarkable magnetic storm was recorded on September 25 and 26, when the variations reached a wide range. The seismograph was kept in continuous operation and a record of earthquakes was obtained on July 7 and 30, August 16, October 3, November 18, January 1, May 11 and 31, and June 14 and 15.

improvised drag and accessories and the work accomplished was relatively small. As this was the first work of the kind done in this locality, the delay in organizing the party was unusually great. An examination was made of Mayaguez Bay, of the northern approach inside of Outer Manchos, of the main entrance, of the southwest channel between Rodriguez Bank and Machos Grandes, and of Guanijibo Channel. Within the area covered as stated above all dangers to navigation have been found and their positions have been det'ermined with the least depth of water on each. The weather was usually favorable for the work before noon each day, but in the afternoon the wind was generally strong enough to make the sea too rough for work with the drag. The geographic positions of a hill and a mountain peak, marking the range for entering 1\layaguez Harbor, were 'determined by triangulation during intervals when the weather conditions did not permit the use of the drag.

UNITSD STATSS AND CANADA BOUNDARY.

The work of re-marking this boundary, as prescribed in the treaty signed at Washington April 11, 1908, was in progress at several points along the line during the year, under the direction of an international commission, in which l\fr. 0. H. Tittmann represents the United States and Mr. W. F. King represents Great Britain. On July 1 Mr. Fremont Morse was at work establishing reference monuments along the United States shore of the water boundarv between Point Roberts and the Pacific Ocean, and the work was continued until Oct~ber 14, when the work was completed. Monuments built of concrete were placed at Pillar Point, Tongue Point, Angeles Point, Iceberg Point, Pile Point, and at Tum Point and on San Juan Island opposite Kelp Reef Beacon. Dungeness Light-house and Patos Island Light-house were used as reference monuments. All these reference monuments and the boundary monument at Point Roberts were connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey tri~ngulation, and a large scale topographic map was made of the region in the immediate vicinity of each monument. The recovery and survey of the United States and Canada boundary w'as in progress on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains under the direction of Mr. C. H. Sinclair, representing 'the United States Commissioner in the field, on July 1, and the work was continued until October 21, when it was suspended. The season's work began on May 7, and the statistics given below refer to the whole season. The boundary was surveyed and monumented from the summit of the Rocky Mountains eastward to the North Fork of Milk River, a distance of 50 miles. Thirty boundary monuments (bronze) were placed in position along this section. The triangulation was extended over the whole section and a topographic survey was made under the direction of E. C. Barnard, chief topographer, along the boundary on bot sides. This survey was extended to ~over a strip 2 miles wide on each side for a distance of 27 miles, and the width was then reduced to 1 mile on each side over the remaining portion of the work. A vista 20 feet wide was opened along the boundary wherever any cutting was necessary. All of the old monuments on this section were recovered. Mr. M. F. Cochrane, of Canada, was with the party during the whole season as the representative of the British Commissioner. The survey of t!ie boundarv was resumed by Mr. Sinclair on May" 19, and the work was in progress on June 30. , During this period the reconnaissance for the triangul3:tion, the erection of signals, and the placing of boundary monuments were completed from the North Fork of Milk River to a point 20 miles west of Sweet Grass. On July I a Canadian party, accompanied by Mr. F. D. Granger, as the representative of the United States Commissioner, was at work between Coutts, Alberta, and the West Fork of Milk River placing monuments on this section which had been previously surveyed. This work was completed, and the 톝urvey along the boundary Was then extended eastward to Frenchmans Creek, a distance of 205 miles from Coutts. One hundred and forty-four monuments were placed in position, and all of these were con-

nected with the triangulation before the season closed on November 6. The work was resumed on May 1 and was in progress on June 30. In July the survey of the boundary westward from the mouth of Pigeon River, at the west end of Lake Superior, was resumed by Mr. W. B. Fairfield. 'fhe survey was extended along the river from the base, 2 miles west of its mouth, furnished by the triangulation of the previous year. The river above the Great Falls is a very crooked, narrow stream with numerous rapids, cascades, and falls, and the banks are densely wooded over almost the whole length, which made it impracticable to extend a triangulation along this portion of the boundary and a survey by the stadia method was made. It extends from the base line mentioned above to the eastern end of South Fowl Lake, a distance of 30 miles. Eighty-seven stadia stations were mark~d by brass plates set in the natural rock along the dvcr and numbered, even numbers being used in the United States territory and odd numbers on the Canadian side of the boundary. Sixty-seven additional stations were marked, drill holes and cross lines cut in the rock, and 148 temporary stations were marked by wooden stubs. A topographic survey was made along the river, using a mountain plane table, and the position of the shore line of the river and of the island and some other topographic details were secured. The river is used to float logs to Lake Superior, and many of the signals were carried away by rafts of logs day after day. Fortunately, the Pigeon River Lumber Company was at work in the region and its officers permitted the use of its transportation facilities, thus greatly furthering lhe work and lessening the time and expense. Late in November the work was suspended for the season and the party was disbanded on the 28th. In J9ne a party w~s organized to resume the work and on June 30 was at the mouth of Pigeon River waiting for transportation to South Fowl Lake. The survey of the United States and Canada boundary was in progress along the St. Croix River on July 1 by two cooperating parties, under charge of Messrs. J. E. McGrath and A. ]. Brabazon, representing the United States and British Commissioners, respectively. Stations were selected and observations were made to extend the triangulation up the river from its mouth to the railroad bridge above Baring, Me. The stations in this work were generally established near the banks of the river by a subsidiary triangulation which was controlled by connecting it, in several places, with the large and well-conditioned triangulation which covers the whole river valley in this locality. The United States and Canadian parties made observations at the stations in the territory of their respective countries in accordance with a plan adopted in advance to secure the greatest amount of progress consistent with the object of the work. Work was suspended on November 28 on account of unfavorable weather conditions. Most agreeable relations existed between the parties and the cooperation was entirely successful. The survey of the boundary was resumed on June 20 under the conditions .named above, and was in progress on the 30th, on which date the triangulation had been completed from the mouth of the St. Croix River to Butler Islands. The work of recovering and re-marking the boundary between the United States and Canada along the St. John River was in progress under the charge of .l\fossrs. J. B. Baylor and G. C.

Commissioners, respectively, on July 1, and this work was continued until November 1, when it was suspended for the winter on account of unfavorable weather. The triangulation was extended as the joint work of the two parties, each occupying the stations in their respective countries, from a point 2 miles below Van Buren, Me., to a point about 3 miles above Edmundston, New Brunswick, a distance of 35 miles. Boundary reference monuments built of reenforced concrete were placed in position on the river bank and referred to the boundary by being connected with the triangulation. In connection with this work two base lines were measured with steel tapes to verify the triangulation, and a connection was made with an astronomic station established by Canada at Edmunston, New Brunswick. A topographic survey was made along the boundary covering the territory adjacent to the river and extending to a distance of 1 U to l ;.1 miles from the river bank. Five topographic sheets were completed on which the relative elevations are shown by contours at vertical intervals of 20 feet, and the artificial features are all indicated. The survey of the boundary was resumed on May 5 by a joint party under the direction of the representatives of the Commissioners named above, and the work was in progress on June 30. Good progress was made and it was practically completed to Fort Kent, Me.
ALASKA BOUNDARY.

The demarcation of the boundary between Alaska and Canada along the one hundred and forty-first meridian was continued, as provided in the convention between the United States and Great Britain (signed April 21, 1906), by l\fr. 0. H. Tittmann, the Commissioner representing the United States, and Mr. W. F. King, the Commissioner representing Great Britain. The demarcation of the Alaska boundary was in progress May 28 to June 30 in the _vicinity of the head of Portland Canal by a Canadian party with Mr. Fremont Morse as the representative of the United States Commissioner. On July l the demarcation of the boundary in southeastern Alaska was in progress under the dire~tion of l\fr. 0. M. Leland, the representative of the United States Commissioner in the field. The season began on May 8, 1909, and the work was continued until November 7. During this period the survey and marking of the boundary was extended as stated below. On the east side of the Unuk River the boundary was located and marked to Boundary Peak 7780. Peak 5800 was located and some timber was cut along the line on each side of it, and it was marked by a monument. 톂wo points on the line between peaks 5800 and 6450 were marked, one by a monument and the other by a copper bolt. Peaks 6450 and 6750 were marked by copper bolts and a "drilled" rock, and the line between 6750 and 7780 was marked in four places by two monuments and two bolts, as well as by cutting timber. Photographs with a photo-topographic camera were made to furnish information for the correction of the topographic maps. On the west side of the U nuk River the boundary was located and marked to a point beyond the east fork of Blue River. Two monuments and a copper bolt were placed in position on this section of the line. On the west fork of Blue River the boundary crossing was marked by opening a vista along the line to points one-quarter of a mile from the river on both sides and by

60

placing a monument on the west side. All of the peaks between 6500 and 7780 were located by triangulation and all of them except these two were occupied with a theodolite and with a photo-topographic camera. A self-registering tide gauge was maintained at Skagway. The survey of the boundary in southeastern Alaska Wl\S resumed on June 1 7 and the work was in progress on the 30th in the vicinity of the point where the boundary crosses the Salmon River. The demarcation of the boundary between Alaska and Canada was in progress along the one hundred and forty-first meridian north of the Yukon River on July 1 under the direction of Mr. G. C. Baldwin, representing the United States Commissioner in the field. Mr. J. D. Craig accompanied the party as the representative of the British Commissioner. The work began on June 20 and was continued until September 17. During this period the boundary line was located by extending the line northward from the monument on the south bank of the Yukon River for a distance of 40 miles. 1'he triangulation along the boundary was extended from the work previously completed south of the Yukon for a distance of 43 miles, and 12 monuments were placed in position to mark this portion of the boundary. A vista 20 feet wide on the sky line was cut through the timber along the line. The triangulation and topographic survey of the boundary between Alaska and Canada along the one hundred and forty-first m<:ridian was in progress on July 1 at a point about 100 miles south of the Yukon River by a party under the direction of Mr. Thomas Riggs, jr., the representative of the United States Commissioner in the field. The party was divided into six sections, each in a separate camp and completely equipped for the work assigned to it. In addition to its own work each section of the party supplemented the work of tbe other sections in its vicinity from time to time and all aided each other to the extent of their ability in attaining the completion of the work before winter weather ended the season. The triangulation was extended 85 mites and the topographic survey 111 miles, both reaching the end of the line projection work at the Natazhat Range of Mountains, 225 miles south of the Yukon River. The triangulation was also extended along White River for a distance of 33 miles, and the topographic survey covered a strip 2yf miles wide on both sides of the boundary. A strenuous effort was made to climb the Natazhat Range and establish the boundary crossing on the summit, but a heavy fall of snow made it necessary to give up the attempt. The rnany obstacles of transportation were overcome and the work was completed in spite of the adverse weather conditions. The movement out of the country for the wiriter began on August 25, and each section started as soon as its work was finished. The positions of 12 monuments placed on the line by the Canadian party were verified.  ' Work was resumed on the location and survey of the line north of the Yukon River on May 24, and it was in progress at the dose of the fiscal year.

The delegates of the United States presented a report covering the progress of geodetic-operations and investigations in the United States from 1906 to 1909. The recent work in this country received the formal recognition of the conference when a famous geodesist arose and stated that he felt sure that he voiced the sentiment of the conference by saying that the Americans were to be congratulated on having introduced a new epoch in geodesy. When it is remembered that the geodetic work in the United States is the incidental result of observations made primarily for other purposes, this recognition of the work by the world's leading geodesists forms a tribute to the Bureau in charge of these operations which should gratify every citizen of the Republic. The occasion of this tribute was the recent publication of a discussion by Mr. J. F. Hayford, an officer of the Survey, of the figure of the earth, under the title "The Figure of the Earth and Isostasy from Measurements in the United States." Many courtesies were extended to the delegates, both in London and Cambridge, officially and privately, and notable among the former was an entertainment at Windsor Castle by the gracious invitation of His Majesty the King.
FORT MYER MILITARY ROAD.

[P. A. WELKER.]

In accordance with a request made by the War Department, an officer was detailed to serve as the representative of the United States on a commission of engineers created to make a survey of a portion of the military road leading from the Aqueduct Bridge (across the Potomac River) to Fort Myer, Va. 'fhe location of a portion of the boundary of this road being in controversy between the United States and the owners of the adjoining property and being before the United States court for the eastern district of Virginia for settlement, a special master commissioner in chancery was named to take testimony, and he appointed the commission of engineers mentioned above. This officer reported to the Quartermaster-General, S. Army, on September 22, and was engaged on this duty until December 10 at such times as were necessary, and after that date was directed to respond to all calls for information on this subject and to give testimony when required before the master in chancery referred to above. The survey was made and a final report was filed under date of December 2, 1909.

LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI WATER BOUNDARY.
[ISAAC WINSTON.)

In accordance with the request made by the chief state engineer, an officer was detailed to complete the marking of this boundary, as described in the previous annual report, by placing buoys along the line in Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound at the intersection of the range Jines previously established and at intermediate points approximately 1 mile apart. The work began on April 5 and was completed on May 2. 'I'he men, material, and outfit, consisting of a tugboat and large barge, were furnished by the chief state engineer, and he had also obtained authority from the UghtHouse Board for the placing of the buoys. Six nun buoys and 22 spar buoys were placed in position. During April strong winds prevailed and caused serious delay in the work, as the tug was not able to handle the barge with safety in rough water. The work was inspected on May 6 by the chief state engineer, accompanied by a representative of the Louisiana Oyster Commission and the Light-House Inspector for the Eighth district. Copies of a chart showing the positions of the buoys and data fixing their positions were furnished to the chief state engineer.
DELAWARE OYSTER BEDS.

[C. C.

YATES.]

In response to a request made by the governor of Delaware and under the authority of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, an officer of the Survey was directed to communicate with the governor and arrange to supervise the survey of certain oyster beds in the State, the work to be done for the Delaware Oyster Survey Commission at such times as his other duties permit and entirely at the expense of the State of Delaware.

DETAILS OF OFFICE OPERATIONS.
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE.
ANDREW BRAID;

Assistant iii Charge.

The Assistant in Charge of the Office has direct supervision of the work of the different divisions of the Office. The Miscellaneous Section is a part of the immediate office of the Assistant in Charge.
COMPUTING DIVISlON.

The usual progress was made in the reduction of field observations and in the preparation of results for publication. It is the policy of the Survey to furnish the available information contained in its records and archives in response to all requests, and the most economical plan of doing this is to publish all data useful to geographers and engineers as rapidly as possible so that it may be distributed in printed form. A Supplemental Investigation in 1909 of the Figure of the Earth and Isostasy was finished and prepared for publication. This completes the discussion of all data obtained in the United States prior to 1909 available for the determination of the problem, and it is gratifying to state that the results of this second investigation have confirmed and greatly strengthened those deduced in the original discussion. The results of triangulation in northern California, including 1 600 geographic positions and descriptions of stations, were also prepared for publication, and progress was made in preparation of similar information in several other States and Territories. The geographic positions of the subsidiary stations along the ninety-eighth meridian were computed. The transfer of all geographic positions in Florida determined previous to 1910 to the United States Standard Datum was completed. A reduction of the base lines measured at Stanton, Tex., and Deming, N. Mex., was made and the results arc published in Appendix 4.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL :>iAGNET!SM.

A steady demand for magnetic information continued during the year and the replies to such requests were prepared in this Division. The preparation of the results of the observations on land and sea during the fiscal year 1909 for publication in the Annual Report for that year was completed. A chart showing the lines of equal magnetic declination and of equal annual change for Alaska in 1910 and the data on which it is based was also prepared for publication in the same report.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1910.

Five volumes containing the results of the observations at the five magnetic observatories for the years 1905 and 1906 were prepared for publication and progress was made in the preparation for publication of the results at these observatories for the years 1907 and 1908. Tabulations of the data pertaining to the earthquakes recorded at the Cheltenham, Sitka, Porto Rico, and Honolulu observatories during the calendar year 1909 were prepared and the office revision of the field computations was kept up to date.
TIDAL DIVISION.

Harmonic analyses were completed for 2 r stations with a combined length of 5 years and 9 months. Nonharmonic reductions were made for 195 stations with a combined length of 31 years and 6 months. Mean sea level was computed for 33 stations with a combined length of 99 years and 6 months. High and low waters and hourly height~ of the sea were tabulated for 322 stations with a combined length of 74 years and 7 months. There were received, examined, and registered in this Division records from 28 self-registering tide-gauge stations with a combined length of 15,U years and records from 93 staff-gauge stations with a combined length of 4.7{ years. The total of all tide observations made by the Survey and received during the year is 20 years at r 2 I stations and from other sources 7.7{ years at 8 stations, making a grand total of 27,U years at r 29 stations. The following is a list of the sources from which tide observations were received from outside parties during the year: 1. United States Army Engineers, tides in United States, l station, 1 year; Canal Zone, 2 stations, 2 years. 2. Hydrographic Office, U. S. Navy, Panama, 2 stations, 1 year and s months. 3. Insular Government, Philippine Islands, 2 stations, 2 years and 3 months. 4. J\laska Boundary Survey, Alaska, 1 station, l year. Tables containing the predicted tides for 191 r at Sandy Hook, N. Y., Baltimore, Md., Charleston, S. C., and San Francisco, Cal., were furnished to the Imperial Hydrographic Office at Wilhelrnshaven, Germany, in advance of publicatiOn. Similar information for Wellington and Aukland, New Zealand, for 1911 was sent to the marine department of New Zealand. The tide tables for r 9 r r were completed and the proof was read. The preparation of the tide tables for r 91 2 was nearly completed. A discussion of the tidal observations recently made in the Arctic Ocean by Civil Engineer R. E. Peary, U.S. Navy, was completed by Mr. Rollin A. Harris, and progress was made by him in the preparation of a monograph on the subject of "Arctic Tides."

INSTRUMENT DIVISION.

In this Division an account was kept of all instruments and general property owned by the Survey or purchased during the year, except articles carried on the inventory of the Office at Washington. All necessary repairs were made to instruments used by the Survey. Minor repairs were made to the Office buildings and furniture. The tide-predicting machine was completed. The construction of this machine has been incidental to the regular repair work of the Survey, and consequently it has been many years in progress. It embraces many new features, and provision has been made for 37 constituents of tidal fluctuations, instead of the 19 provided for in the machine previously used. This is at least 10 more than the number used in any other machine

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1910.

in foreign countries. It was completed in February and has been tested in predicting the most complicated known tides, and the quantities obtained have been compared with the results of computation and found to be satisfactory from every point of view. Dr. Rollin A. Harris, of the Tidal Division of this Survey, furnished the theoretical data for solving mechanically, by using 5 long-period and 32 short-period constituents, an integrating formula which yields the heights and times of any tide without resetting, and the design and working drawings were prepared by the Chief of this Division. The machine not only gives the times and heights of the tides, but also simultaneously traces the corresponding tidal curve. Attached to the machine is an electric device which automatically stops it at the instant when the zero of the time chain is in contact with the pointer which indicates the quantities to be read by the operator. The details of construction will be given when a description of the machine is prepared for publication An electric tide indicator similar to those already in use and previously described was prepared and installed at the American Seamen's Friend Society's Institute, New York City. The patterns for certain monuments to be used on the United States and Canada boundary were inspected at St. Paul, .Minn., and later an inspection was made of the monuments after completion. A duplicate of the leveling instrument, devised and adopted by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, made for the Tunisian Government by private parties subject to inspection and approval by the Superintendent, was carefully examined and recommended for approval. An improved form of tape stretcher for use in measuring base lines was constr.ucted substantially as suggested by an observer in the field engaged on that work. This is shown in one of the illustrations to Appendix 4.
LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES.

The current routine work was kept up to date. The records of observations made in the field were indexed as they were received. The revision of the subject catalogue was continued, and three-fourths Qf the work was completed.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY BETWEEN JULY l, 1909, AND JUNE 30, 1910.
By R. L.
FARIS,

Inspector of Magnetic Work; Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

INTRODUCTION.

The present publication contains the results of magnetic observations made on land and at sea by officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the prosecution of the magnetic survey of the United States and outlying territories during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1910. There are also included some results obtained in preceding years not heretofore published. Four magnetic observatories have been in continuous operation throughout the year-at Cheltenham, Md.; Sitka, Alaska; near Honolulu, Hawaii, and on Vieques Island, P. R. The observatory at Baldwin, Kans., was discontinued in October, 1909, and the instruments were transferred to Tucson, Ariz. The operation of the observatory at that place began in November, 1909. There will be found in the tables the values of the magnetic elements for each of the observatories based on the observations in December and January, except in the case of Baldwin, where the values are for October,
1909.
OBSERVATIONS ON LAND AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

The distribution of the stations on land is shown in the following table, from which it will be seen that observations were made during the year in 39 States and Territories. The greater part of the year's work was in the middle of the country-Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota-where it would be important to have the records of the Baldwin observatory to correct the results for diurnal variation. Numerous old stations were reoccupied in order to determine the secular change of the magnetic elements. In April, 1910, an observer was sent out especially to occupy repeat stations, going through the southern tier of States from Alabama to California, up the Pacific coast, and back through the center of the country. He had reached central California at the close of the fiscal year.

SECULAR CHANGE OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION.

A comparison of the declination results at "repeat " 톝tations occupied during the year with the results of earlier observations in the same localities is presented in the following table. The letters :tfter the names of stations indicate (a) that the old station was reoccupied exactly, (b) that the new station was very near the old one, and (c) that the new station was some distance (quarter of a mile or more) from the old one. A tabular value of annual change refers approximately to the middle of the period from which it is deduced. A plus sign indicates increasing east declination or decreasing west declination, and a minus sign the reverse. The resulting values of annual change show that, as compared with 1905, west declination is increasing more rapidly in New England and the Middle States and east

OBSERVATIONS AT SEA AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

Magnetic observations at sea were secured on the Bpche in connection with the hydrographic work along the Atlantic Coast, and on the Explorer, Gedney, and Patterson returning from Alaska in the fall of 1909 and going to Alaska in the spring of 1910. There are also included in this publication the results of observations in Philippine waters from 1906 to 1909 on the Fathomer, Marinduque, and Romblon.

METHODS OF OBSERVING.
LAND WORK.

The methods of observing have been the same as those followed in previous yC'ars. Observers engaged exclusively in magnetic work are supplied with a complete outfit consi9ting of theodolite magnetometer, dip circle, half-second pocket chronometer, observing tent, tape, etc. In addition to the regular magnetic observations they usually make an approximate determination of latitude and longitude at each station. Those who are expected to get magnetic results incidental to other branches of survey work are supplied with more or less complete outfits, according to circumstances. Where only declination results can be secured under the conditions involved, a compass declinometer is supplied, but to those who can attempt more, a dip circle with compass attachment is furnished, with which compact outfit, knowing the azimuth of some reference mark from triangulation or other source, the declination, dip, and total intensity (by Lloyd's method) can be obtained with a fair degree of accuracy.
SEA WORK.

The Bache, Explorer, and Patterson are C'ach provided with a Lloyd-Creak dip circle and accompanying gimhal .stand, by means of which the dip and total intensity can be determined on board ship. The Explorer and Patterson are also provided with a magnetometer, so that the "intensity constant,, of the dip circle may be determined at each place where shore observations are made. Observations for declination are made with the usual standard liquid compass and an azimuth circle of Ritchie or Negus pattern. A value of declination, dip, or intensity usually depends upon the mean of observation made on 8 or 16 equidistant headings while steaming in a circle, once with port and once with starboard helm. In some cases, however, observations are made on three headings and the results are corrected for the effect of the ship's magnetism by comparison with the observations made while swinging ship.

Bo

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1910. ACCURACY OF RESULTS.

The endeavor in general is to secure, on land, declination and dip results of which the absolute error (incl킺ing everything involved-errors of observation and reduction) does not exceed 2', and to determine the horizontal intensity within 1 part in 1 ooo. As stated in previous reports, the experience of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has been that, under the conditions involved in a campaign of field work covering a large area, ' including the standardization of instruments and the determination of reduction corrections, this accuracy can not be much increased. In observatory work with special instruments, or when special investigations are made under the best conditions by special observers, there is no difficulty in reducing these limits of error, but in a large organization, where results must be secured under all conditions, and at times under physical difficulties, the degree of accuracy stated must be regarded as satisfactory and sufficient. It happens, of course, that these limits are occasionally exceeded, for one reason or another, and there may be a few rare cases in which the errors are two or three times the amounts given.
INSTRUMENTAL CORRECTIONS.

The instrumental comparisons made at Cheltenham during the year indicate that the instrumental corrections used the previous year require only small changes, except in the case of magnetometer No. 10, which had been overhauled and provided with a new magnet house. The following are the corrections which have been applied to reduce the field results to the Cheltenham observatory standard instruments: Corrections to magnetometers.

REDUCTION OF OBSERVATIONS.

A first computation is made by the observer in the field, his instructions requiring him, before he leaves a station, to carry his computation far enough to assure himself that the desired degree of accuracy has been attained. This computation is revised in the Office, in the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, and the necessary corrections are applied to reduce the results to the standard instruments, as indicated in the foregoing section. Each value of the magnetic declination is then corrected to reduce it to the mean of the month in which the observation was made, with the aid of the continuous observations at the nearest observatory, allowance being made for the change in diurnal range with change in magnetic latitude. No attempt has been made to correct the dip and horizontal intensity results for diurnal variation.
ARRANGEMENT OF TABLES.
LAND OBSERVATIONS.

The values of declination, dip, and horizontal intensity presented in Table I are arranged by States alphabetically, the results for each State being given in the order of increasing latitudes. The latitudes and longitudes are in most cases the result of solar observations made with the small theodolite which forms a part of the magnetometer. In default of observations or a chart, the geographical coordinates were scaled from the best available map, either a topographic sheet of the United States Geological Survey, a post-route map, or some other state map. In such cases only the nearest whole minute of latitude and longitude is given. The horizontal intensity is expressed in terms of the one hundred thousandth part of a C.G.S. unit of intensity of magnetic force, termed a gamma and designated by the Greek letter r

Only the month and day of the date are given, since the observations were all made between July l, 1909, and June 30, 1910, except when a statement is made to the contrary in a footnote. The names of the months have been abbreviated as follows:
January February March April Ja Fe Mh Ap May June July August My Je Jy Au September October November December Se Oc No De

The observer is indicated by the initials of his name. are as follows :
F. L. Adams J. R. Benton J. E. Burbank W. H ..Burger R. B. Derickson 0. W. Ferguson 0. H. Gaarden G. Hartnell W. M. Hill D.R. Jewell E. C. Kinnear R. F. Luce R.R. Lukens H. E. McComb F. A. Molby E.E.Mumaw E. H. Pagcnhart S. D. Sarason
SEA OBSERVATIONS.

The names of the observers

S. H. Schapiro E. E. Smith A. M. Sobieralski S. W. Tay S. G. Townshend, jr. W. F. Wallis P. C. Whitney S. S. Winslow C. F. Woodyard

The results obtained on board ship are presented in Tables II and III. The general arrangement is indicated by the headings. Unless otherwise stated, the ship was swung both with port and starboard helms. In the column headed "Sea," sm means smooth; sw, swell; lt, light; mod, moderate. The commanding officers of the different ships were as follows:
Bache Explorer Gedney Patterson Fathomer l\1arinduquc
Roinblon

W. C. Hodgkins W. C. Dibrell R. B. Derickson H. C. Denson, W. E. Parker H. D. King, J.B. Miller H. C. Denson, D. R. Jewell H. D. King, E. H. Pagenhart

Intensity results are expressed in C.G.S. units. The horizontal intensity has been computed from the observed dip and total intensity. _ Table III contains the results of declination observations on board ship in Philippine waters from 1906 to 1909. None of the vessels there are equipped with Lloyd-Creak dip circles. Their cruises to and from the working ground are generally short and through the passages between the islands, and little would be added to our knowledge of the distribution of dip and intensity by observations on board ship under those conditions.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS. Magnetic observers are instructed to mark every station in as permanent a manner as possible, either with a stone or a post of some durable wood, so that it may be available for future occupation. They are also required to furnish a sufficiently detailed description to locate the station, even if the marking should be destroyed, and to determine the bearing of two or three prominent objects in addition to the one used as reference mark in the azimuth and declination observations. The information is given in abridged form on the following pages for each of the stations occupied during the year. Further details can usually be obtained upon application to the Superintendent

C0AST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1910.

of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The usual method of marking a station is by a stone.post about 3 feet long and 6 or 8 inches square, set so as to project an inch or two above ground and lettered on top U. S. C. & G. S., with a drill hole in the center to mark the exact point. Whenever the local authorities desired, and were willing to bear the expense, a second stone was set to denote the true meridian. The descriptions are arranged alphabetically by States and by names of stations.

By WILLIAM Bowrn,
Inspector of Geodetic Work; Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

GENERAL STATEMENT. As the nickel-steel or invar base tapes were satisfactory in the measurement of six primary bases in 1906,* it was decided to use them in measuring the two primary base lines, one at Stanton, Tex., and one at Deming, N. Mex., on the Texas-California arc of primary triangulation. The invar tapes held 톞heir lengths well during the season of 1906, and because of their small coefficients of expansion it was possible to do the measuring in the hours of daylight. The average coefficient of expansion of the invar tapes used on primary bases by this Survey is only about 0.04 that of steel, hence an error of 2. 0 5 in the temperature of an invar tape would make only the error caused by an erroneous reading of o. 0 I in the temperature of the steel tape. As it was found, during the campaign of I9o6, to be unnecessary to standardize the tapes in the field, it was decided to have the base lines on the Texas-California arc measured by the triangulation party when the triangulation had progressed to the vicinity of .the bases. There are only two base lines on the Texas-California arc. This triangulation extends about 1 200 miles from the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation in the ~icinity of Weatherford, Tex., to the Pacific coast primary triangulation near San Diego, Cal. The locations of the base lines were made to depend upon the summation of the strength of the individual figures rather than upon the number of figures or the length of the scheme between bases. The average distance between bases on the ninety-eighth meridian is about 120 miles, while the distance between the nearest base on the ninetyeighth meridian to the Stanton base is 254 miles, from the Stanton base to the Deming base is 399 miles, and from the Deming base to the Los Angeles base is 628 Iniles. The average of these three distances is 427 miles. The two base lines are shown in their relation to the scheme of triangulation in Fig. 1. It is interesting to note that no extra stations or lines were used as a base net to connect the Stanton base line with the main triangulation, as the base is one of the lines of the main scheme. Such a condition is very unusual and there is no similar case in primary triangulation in the United States.

METHODS USED ON THE STANTON AND DEMING BASE LINES. The instructions issued to Assistant J. S. Hill, who was in charge of the triangulation party working on the Texas-California arc during the season of 1908-9, provided that:
During the progress of the triangulation you will measure the Stanton base with invar tapes. Very little increase in the average accuracy of the lengths of the triangle sides in the triangulation connected with this base will result from increasing the accuracy of the base measurement beyond that represented by a probable error of 1 part in 500 ooo in the length of the base. The following limits of accuracy are selected with a view of attaining a probable error but little, if any, greater than 1 part in 500 ooo. You will strive to keep as far within these limits as is possible by the use of good judgment and skill, but you will restrict the time and money expended upon each operation substantially to that required to keep barely within them. Four in var tapes are to be standardized at the Bureau of Standards, both before and after the base tneasurement. The base is to be measured with three of these invar tapes used in daylight. The base shall be measured in sections approximately 1 kilometer in length, except that one shorter section may be used. Each section of the base shall be measured with at least two different invar tapes. Different pairs of invar tapes shall be used on different sections, so that the three tapes used on the base shall thereby be thoroughly intercomparcd. Two, and only two, measurements of each section shall be made, 11nlcss the discrepancy between these two measurements exceeds 20 millimeters ../K (in which K is the length of the section in kilometers), in which case additional measurements must be made until two are obtained which agree within this limit. .The fourth invar tape standardized 톓s to be retained for use in case of serious damage to any of the three tapes with which the measurements would otherwise be made. Such precautions should be taken to secure accurate horizontal and vertical alignment of the tapes and the determination of the tension applied to the tapes as is necessary to insure that the errors arising from thfse sources on t~e base shall each be less than 1 part in 1 ooo ooo.

STANDARDIZATION OF TAPES. The tapes were standardized at the Bureau of Standards, at Washington, D. C., both before and after the measurement of each of the two bases. The length of the 50-meter comparator was measured with iced bar B17 just before and after the comparison of the tapes with the comparator. In the determinations at the Bureau of Standards the tapes were used in practically the same manner as in the field. They were supported at the ends and at the middle point with all three supports in a straight line. Two thermometers were attached to each tape about 1 meter from the graduation mark at each end, and the fixed tension of 15 kilograms was applied. The tapes were suspended under the end microscopes of the comparator, using the cut-off cylinders for the end supports. For a full description of the standardization of base tapes, see pages II5-119 of Appendix 4, Report for 1907. STANTON BASE LINE. The Stanton base line was located by the reconnaissance party in 1907-8 about 9 miles west and a little north of the town of Stanton, on the Texas and Pacific Railway. The land is level and smooth, and partly covered by small brush, with no ravines of sufficient size to interfere in any way with the preparation or measurements. The base was measured over the prairie, except for a short distance, which was over cultivated land.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1910. SIZE OF PARTY.

The triangulation party which measured the Stanton base consisted of Assistant S. Hill, the chief of party, Signalman J. S. Bilby, and 7 other persons-9 in all. The actual measurement with the tapes was made by Mr. Hill, Mr. Bilby, and 4 other persons. Mr. Hill was in charge, making the forward contact and reading the forward thermometer, and Mr. Bilby making the rear contact and reading the rear thermometer. Two men held the forward and rear tape stretchers, one man recorded the observations, and one man stood at the center stake during the time the tape was on its supports and assisted in carrying the tape forward.* The party lived in camp pitched close to the base line, and consequently only a small amount of time was consumed in going to and from the work.

J.

DIVISIONS OF THE BASE.

There were three main divisions in the Stanton base; the first extending from south base to the end of the fourth kilometer, the second from the beginning of the fifth kilometer to the end of the eighth kilometer, while the third section extended from the. beginning of the ninth kilometer to north base, which is just beyond the thirteenth kilometer. The total length of the base is 13 193 meters. Each main division of the base was measured at least twice, with two tapes, a different pair of tapes being used on each division; hence an intercomparison of the three tapes used could be made. The following table shows the divisions of the base with the tapes used on each and the approximate length of the divisions:

The southern end of the base line is on level prairie land, 7.U miles west of Stanton and about two-thirds of a mile north of the railroad. The upper mark is a cylinder of concrete 30 inches long and 20 inches in diameter, with its top flush with the surface of the ground. In the center of the concrete was placed a 3-inch iron pipe, on the top of which is fastened a round brass cap triangulation station mark. A small hole drilled into th~ center of this station mark indicates the Stanton south base triangulation station and the southern end of the Stanton base line. The underground mark is a small drill hole in a metal disk triangulation station mark, cemented into bed rock 3 feet below the surface of the ground. The northern end of the base is situated about 11 miles northwest of Stanton, on the highest point of a small bare knoll in the pasture owned by Mr. J. E. Henson. The surface mark is similar to that at south base, except that the cylinder of concrete is 24 inches in diameter. The underground mark is a cylinder of concrete 12 inches in

height and 12 inches in diameter, with its top 36 inches below the surface of the ground. In the center of this cylinder was placed an iron pipe 12 inches long and 1U inches in diameter. The projecting point of a large wire nail, cemented into the pipe with its head down, marks the station and the northern end of the base line.
APPARATUS USED.

The invar tapes used on the Stanton and Deming bases were similar to those used in
1906, and described on pages 111-113 of Appendix 4, Report for 1907, "Six primary

bases measured with steel and invar tapes." Each tape was kept on an aluminum reel 16 inches in diameter, a reel of this size being found, by experiments in 1906, to be large enough not to injure the tape nor to cause any change in its length. During the measurement of the base the tape in use was seldom allowed to touch the ground, being held up by the several members of the party while moving forward or being supported by the stakes while the actual measurements were being -made. Care was taken to protect the tape from shocks and sharp bends. This was_eSpecially the case while passing obstructions, such as wire fences and ditches. The tape stretcher shown and described on pages 414 and 415 of Appendix 8, Report for 1 892, was used on the measurements of the nine primary base lines along the ninetyeighth meridian in 1900-1901 (Fig. 2). It weighed 46U pounds. In ~906 this stretcher was modified by taking off the platform on which the operator stood and substituting a steel point bolted to the rod. Instead of being held in position by the weight of the operator on the platform, the stretcher was held by the point, driven into the ground. Even this modified stretcher was heavier than necessary and not easily operated. An entirely new stretcher was used during the measurements of the Stanton and Deming bases. It is shown in Fig. 3 and was designed by Signalman J. S. Bilby and made under his direction. It consists of an iron tube 1.35 meters long and 34 millimeters in diameter, with a shallow longitudinal groove into the bottom of which is drilled a number of holes about 12 millimeters apart. A short collar, fitted with a frame to support the spring balance and a weight to balance it, and sliding .over the long tube, carries a pin which, pressed into one of the holes by a spring, fixes t.he position of the collar on the tube. When the spring is released by a handle this coIIar may be quickly raised or lowered and placed in any desired position on the tube. The bottorri of the tube ends in a round conical point which permits it to rotate on its axis, thus allowing the tension to put the balance into alignment with the tape. This stretcher, which weighs but 17U pounds, has a short iron rod near the bottom of the tube to give a hold for the foot in forcing the point into the ground. The general principle embodied in this tape stretcher has been retained in a new one made in the Instrument Division of this Survey for use in the future. It differs from the former stretcher only in being lighter in weight and in that its sliding coIIar can be quickly brought to a desired position at any point on the tube by means of a friction lever device. It is shown in Fig. 4. The length of the tube of the new stretcher is 1.35 meters and its diameter is 32 millimeters. Its total weight is only IIU pounds. As in previous base measurements, the rear end of the tape was held by a simple wooden staff, fitted with a metal shoe, the end of the tape being fastened to the staff by a strap. (See Fig. 5.)

COAST 텮ND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, r9ro.

On all base lines measured with tapes, previous to the Stanton base, the observer made the rear contact using his bare or gloved hand to place the mark on the tape in exact coincidence with the mark on the metal strip of the tape support after an approximate contact had been made by the holder of the rear end of the tape. An efficient method of making the exact contact was found in having the graduation on the tape

brought close to but slightly forward of the mark on the copper strip. Then the observer, by grasping and flexing the tape with his hand, brought the mark on the tape into exact coincidence with the mark on the stake. Of course it is understood that this flexure is put into the tape between its rear end and the mark. It was found that by using this method a sensitive and certain control of the tape could be maintained, but

it was also found that the hand needed some protection from the tape. For this purpose a device called a "tape-stretching hand guard" was used on the Stanton and Deming base lines, and it was found to be entirely satisfactory. It is shown in Fig. 5. It consists of a piece of metal 110 millimeters long, 25 millimeters wide, and 3 millimeters thick, made in the form of a flattened "S."
SETTING STAKES AND MEASURING.

On the Stanton base there were three supports for each tape length. The two end supports were made of sawed lumber 4 inches square and about 3 feet long. They were driven int~ the ground to a depth of about 18 inches, thus leaving an equal length above ground. It was found in most cases that it was not necessary to dig a nole for the stake. A crowbar was Ust:!d to start the hole, into which was inserted the sharpened end of the stake, which was then driven down with a sledge until it was firm. The intermediate support consisted of a piece of lumber 2 by 4 inches in cross section, set just off the line of the base. A wire nail driven into this and crossing the line, with its top in a straight line between the tops of the end stakes, serve<l to support the tape at its center. The nail usually projected about 2 inches. No point was marked on the nail to indicate the line of the base, as the tape was supposed to assume that line when the tension ~as applied. The tape was tapped on its under side, close to the nail, just before the forward observer marked the tape length. The triangulation partY. had erected srgnals over the ends of the base before any work on the base was done. Upon starting this work several points were located in the line between the base ends to assist in aligning the stakes, which was done with a 6-inch theodolite. The theodolite was moved forward frequently in order to secure a good control of the alignment. One or more of the members of the party preceded those who set the stakes, and cleared away the small brush, but this was only a small part of the preparation of the base for the measurement. Two lines of levels were run over the base, using a precise level and a self-reading rod. The rod was held only on the stakes supporting the ends of the tapes, except in the few cases where the grade between the end supports was broken at the middle support. In such cases the rod was held also on the middle support. Set-ups and set-backs were made on the copper strips nailed to the stakes supporting the ends of the tapes. These strips were made of soft copper and were 55 millimeters long, 2 millimeters thick, and i2 millimeters wide. One edge of the strip was placed abo.ut half the width of the tape from the line of the base. The thickness of the strip was exactly the thickness of the sleeves on the ends of the tapes, which made it very. easy to extend the line from the mark of the tape onto the strip. The lengths of the set-ups and set-backs were measured by means of a pair of hairspring dividers and a scale reading to tenths of millimeters.
WIND EFFECT ON TAPES:

During the measurement of the Stanton base, and especially during the day, there was usually wind of considerable force. The invar tape has a tendency not to lie perfectly flat or smooth-that is, the elements of the tape normal to its length are not horizontal when suspended with tension applied and ready for measurement. With

APPENDIX 4. PRIMARY BASE LINES.

this peculiarity, it is more sensitive to wind effects than the steel tape. The effect of wind on the latter is to cause it to vibrate or flutter. This makes it difficult to mark its forward end on the copper strip; but the length of the tape, or rather the distance between its end marks, is not materially shortened. \Vith the invar tape, however, where a portion of its length is approximately normal to the moving air, the distance between the end marks is materially lessened during strong winds, although the mark on the forward end of the tape remains fairly steady. No two single measures of a section of the Stanton base differed by as much as the allowable maximum limit. The chief of party, however, noticing that a strong wind had a decided effect on the lerigths of the tapes, decided to measure certain sections in both strong and light winds, in order to form an estimate of the amount of this effect. In each case it was found that the measurement during the strong wind gave a value for the length of the section larger than that obtained during moderate or light winds. In fact, the effect of the wind on the tapes seemed to be a function of its velocity or strength. Having found that there was a constant error in all the sections which were measured during strong winds, all of those sections were remeasured when the wind was light or moderate. A light wind was considered to be one which did not in any way interfere with the measurements of the base. A moderate wind was one which disturbed the tape, but not sufficiently to interfere seriously with the progress of the measurements. A strong wind interfered materially with the accuracy of the measurement and made necessary the remeasurement of a number of sections. In every case where the wind was moderate or strong, it was blowing at right angles to the liIJe of the base.  With a certain velocity it is probable that the effect on the tape decreases as the direction of the wind approaches the line of the base. The effect of wind blowing in the exact direction of the base is probably small, but no experiments were made to show whether that effect is positive or negative. In order to obtain favorable conditions, some of the measurements were made at night, when generally the wind was not strong. The office computation verified the conclusion reached by the chief of party in the field regarding the effect of strong wind, and in computing the final length of the base line the measurement of any section which was made in a strong wind was rejected, provided that there were at least two other measures of that section which were made in a light or moderate wind, or when there was no wind.
EQUATIONS OF TAPES.

The equations of tapes, furnished by the Bureau of Standards and resulting from standardization in January, 1909 1 are:
T 621 =50 T 616 =50 T 617 =50 T 622 =50 m+( 9.678 mm켹.018 m+( 9.48o mm .017 m+( 9.679 mm .018 m+(10.322 mm .019 mm)+(o.0205 mm켹.ooo8 mm)+( .0178 mm .0007 mm)+( .016o mm .0007 mm)+( .0614 mm .oon mm)X(t-17.7 C) mm)X(t-17.7 C) mm)X(t-17.7 C) mm)X(t-17.6 C)

The equations of these same tapes, furnished by the Bureau of Standards and resulting from the restandardization in May, 1909, are:
T 621 =50 m+ (9.907 Tm=5o m+ (9.518 T 617 =50 m+ (9.840 Tm=50 m+(10.781 mm켹.021 mm .028 mm .025 mm .024 mm) mm) mm) mm) at at at at 24.7 C 24.8 C 24.8 C 24.7 C

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1910.

The standardizations from which the preceding equations were obtained were made as far as practicable under field conditions. Each tape was supported at both ends and at the middle point and under a tension of 1 5 kilograms. Tape No. 522 was carried to the field but was not used in any of the measurements. No determination of the coefficients of expansion was made at the time of the second standardization. The adopted equations of the tapes used in the final computation of the Stanton base are:
T 621 =50 m+(9.775 mm켹.014 mm)+(o.0205 mm켹.0008 mm)X(l-21.2 C) T 616 =50 m+(9.490 mm .016 mm)+( .0178 mm .0007 mm)X(l-21.2 C) T 617 =5o m+(9.734 mm .015 mm)+( .0160 mm .0007 mm)X(t-21.2 C)

These values were obtained by taking a weighted mean of the equations of January and May, 1909. Each determination was given a weight inversely proportional to the probable error of the length of the tape. In order to compare the lengths of the tapes, as obtained by the two standardizations of January and May, 1909, just before and after the measurement of the Stanton base, the values of the lengths were reduced to the mean temperature, 21.2. The table below shows the comparison:
Jan. 22, T 610 =50 m+ 9.542 mm켹.017 mm, v=-0.044 mm May 25, =so m+ 9.454 mm .028 mm, ----Mean= + 9.498 mm Jan. 22, T 517 =50 m+ 9.735 mm .018 mm, May 2s, =so m+ 9.782 mm .025 mm, Mean= + 9.758 Jan. 22, T 521 =50 m+ 9.750 mm .018 mm, May 2s, =so m+ 2.835 mm .021 mm, ---텺ean= + 9.792 mm Jan. 22, Tm= so m+10.543 mm .019 mm, May 25, =so m+10.s66 mm .024 mm, Mean= +10.554 mm + .044 mm

+ .042 mm .043 mm + .011 mm .012 mm

In rio case was the residual for a given tape length as much as three times the probable error of its length from a single standardization, and it may therefore be inferred that the tapes underwent no permanent changes in length between the two standardizations, thus justifying the assumption that the differences were due to accidental errors of standardization. This assumption is certainly true for tape 522, which was not unreeled in the field between the two standardizations. The thermometers used during the measurements of the base line were graduated to half degrees and read to tenths of degrees. Their corrections are shown in the following table:

REDUCTION TO SEA LEVEL.

The best available elevations were those furnished by the field computation of the trigonometric leveling through the scheme of triangulation from the ninety-eighth meridian. This gave 821 meters as the elevation of Stanton south base. A line of precise leveling is being carried along the Texas and Pacific Railway within the scheme of triangulation, and it will be connected with Stanton south base. When the resulting elevation is available, the true correction to the length of the base for reduction to sea level can be applied. The formula used in reducing the base to sea level is

C= -s~+s1!?_-~ &c

where C is the reduction to sea level for a section of length Sand mean height h, r being the radius of the earth's curvature for this line. All but the first term on the righthand side of this equation are negligible. The reduction to sea level for each section of the base is given in the following table:

The probable error of the base from all sources= 5.15 mm. The probable error of the weighted mean of a tape was computed as if a direct and not a weighted mean had been taken-that is, e= Y2../e 21 +e 22 , where e is the probable error of the mean value of the length of the tape, and e1 and e2 the probable errors of the January and May values of the length of the tape. The probable error obtained in this way differs not more than 0.001 millimeter from what it would be had weights been used. In writing the expansion term of the tape equations, the coefficient determined at the January standardization was used with t 0 (the standard temperature), denoting the direct mean of the temperatures of the two standardizations. In computing the probable error of each section of the base, three causes of uncertainty in the length were considered. (a) The uncertainty of the lengths of the tapes. The probable error of the length of a section due to this cause was assumed to be the number of tape lengths in the section multiplied by one-half the square root of the sum of the ~quares of the probable errors of the lengths of the two tapes used in measuring the section. (b) The uncertainty caused by not knowing the true temperature coefficient. The probable error of the length of a section due to this cause was assumed to be n (t0 - t) multiplied by one-half the square root of the sum of the squares of the probable errors of the temperature coefficients of the two tapes used in the measurement of the section. In this expression n is the number of tape lengths in the section,

APPENDIX 4. PRIMARY BASE LINES.

t0 the temperature of standardization, and t the temperature of the tapes. (c) The accidental errors of measurement. The probable error of the measurement of a section from the accidental errors was computed from the residuals using the formula
r 0 =0.6745
v being a residual and n the number of measures of a section. -V/_[~, n(n- 1) .

The final probable error of the length of a section was obtained by taking the square root of the sums of the squares of the three probable errors obtained as indicated in the preceding paragraph, while the probable error of the length of the entire base was taken to be equal to the square root of the sums of the squares of the probable errors of all the sections.
COST OF STANTON BASE.

The triangulation party was engaged on the preparation and measurement of the Stanton base line seventeen days, from February 7 'to February 23, 1909. This was the period during which no triangulation was done. It came between the last observations of horizontal directions at south base station and the beginning of observations at station Elkins. The total field expenses of the party, including the salary of its chief, for the month of February were $1 214. These expenses included transportation of light keepers both by rail and by hired teams between the triangulation stations and to and from the base line. It is believed that a fair estimate of the cost of the field work during the measurement of the Stanton base line is $739 This estimate was obtained by multiplying the average cost per day during the month, $43.50, by .the total number of days on the base line. This made the field cost per kilometer $56 and the cost per mile $90.  ' The average cost of the field work per kilometer of measurements with steel tapes in 1900-1901 was $89. The average field cost per kilometer measured by tapes or bars during that season was $145. The average cost of the measurement of a.kilometer in 1906, using both steel and nickel-steel (invar) tapes on each section, was $99 In the 1906 cost the expense of standardizing at the Bureau of Standards was not included. During both of those seasons standardizations in the field were made at the beginning and at the end of the work. The low cost of the work on the Stanton base line was due largely to the following causes: (a) There was only the expense of local travel; (b) the party was well trained, though it had never worked together on the measurement of a base line; (c) there was no standardization of the tapes in the field; (d) the chief of party and his assistant were experienced in base line measurements; and (e) there was no unproductive period before and after the actual work on the base. To the cost of the Stanton base line should be added $400, the approximate expense to the Bureau of Standards of standardizing four tapes both before and after the measurement.* The cost of the office computation of the Stanton base line was $129. Hence the total cost of that base line, including all expenses except that involved in preparing results for publication and the printing of this appendix, was $1 268. This made a cost of $96 per kilometer and $147 per mile. The total cost per kilometer, measured with steel tapes in 1900-1901, was $98, and that of a kilometer measured with both steel and invar tapes in 1906 was $115. The chief of party who conducted the work
*The charge made by the Bureau of Standards to foreign governments or to private individuals for the standardization of base tapes is $50 per tape.

in 19o6 stated that the cost would have been $94 per kilometer if invar tapes only had been used. DEMING BASE LINE. The Deming base 'line was measured by a primary-triangulation party, which" was also under the direction of Assistant J. S. Hill, during the season of 1909-IO on the Texas-California arc. This base line is located in the valley south of Deming, Grant County, N. Mex., the northern end of the base being about 6 ~ miles due south of that town. The approximate length of the base is r 5 554 meters. From the north base to the south base the line has a general direction of south 26 west, while the land over which it runs is level and smooth and crosses no ravines or other obstructions and there is no grade of more than r per cent for any one tape length. Portions of the line had to be cleared of sagebrush, greasewood, and mesquite, but this work was not difficult.
SIZE OF PARTY.

The triangulation party which measured the Deming base consisted of Assistant J. S. Hill, the chief, Signalman J. S. Bilby, and ro other persons-12 in all. On the base line work the party was reduced to an average of 9 persons. There were r 2 persons engaged on the base the first few days, while during the latter part of the work there were only 6. Being able to reduce the size of the party, it being at the end of the season on triangulation, decreased the cost of the base. After the base had been prepared, the actual measurements with the tapes were made in three days by the 2 observers and 4 men. The leveling along the base in both directions was done by an observer and 3 men in three and one-half days. As was the case on the Stanton base, the party camped close to the base line in order to make the time of getting to and from work a minimum.
DIVISIONS OF THE BASE.

As in the Stanton base line, this line had three main divisions: The first extended from north base to the end of the fifth kilometer, the second from the beginning of the sixth kilometer to the end of the tenth kilometer, while the third was from the beginning of the eleventh kilometer to south base. Each main division of the base was measured twice, with two tapes, a different pair of tapes being used on each division; hence an intercomparison of the three tapes could be made. The following table shows the divisions of the base line, the tapes used, and the approximate length of each division :

* These tapes were also used on the Stanton base.

APPENDIX 4. PRIMARY BASE LINES.

The north end of the base is .marked by a drill hole in the center of a metal station mark (see description of Stanton south base, p. 148) embedded in a cylinder of concrete 24 inches long by 20 inches in diameter, the top of concrete being even with the surface of the ground. An underground mark consisting of a metal disk set in concrete was placed 30 inches below the surface mark. The south end of the Deming base is located about 1,U miles east of the Midland switch on the Deming branch of the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad and about 15 miles to the southward of Deming. It was marked in exactly the same manner as the north base. The instructions to the chief of party were identical with those issued to him for the measurement of the Stanton base, except that they called for 5 supports-2 for the ends and 3 intermediate-for a tape length. It was decided to adopt this number of supports owing to the difficulty with the wind on the Stanton base when using only 3 supports. Five supports used on the Deming base proved to be very effective in eliminating most of the effect of wind on the tapes. It prevented the wind causing errors in two ways-it reduced the catenary, or the distance between any two supports, and it made the tape assume more nearly a horizontal position, and consequently the wind pressed only against the edge of the tape instead of on its broad surface. The wind effect was not entirely eliminated, but it was believed to be so small as to be negligible. The measurement of the Deming base was made in a manner similar to that of the Stanton base, except as noted above. The intermediate supports of the tape were nails driven into pieces of lumber 2 inches by 4 inches in cross section, set into the ground at intervals of 12,U meters between the end supports and just off the line of the base. These nails were driven in horizontally with their tops placed approximately on the straight line joining the top of the end supports of the tape, except where it was necessary to break the grade of the tape in crossing an obstruction. In such a case the elevation of the point at which the tape length changed grade was determined during the leveling of the base. In the normal cases, where all of the supports were in the same straight line, the leveling rod was held only on the end supports.
STANDARDIZATION AND EQUATIONS OF THE TAPES.

The results obtained on the Stanton base showed that in using invar tapes it is desirable to have the interval between supports considerably less than 25 meters, and accordingly, in May, 1909, the 50-meter invar tapes were standardized, using 5 as well as 3 supports. The equations of the 4 tapes using the 5 supports, as determined by the May, 1909, standardization, are given below. The base was measured with tapes 516, 517, and 521, while tape 522 was taken to the field for use in case of accident to one of the other tapes.

The coefficients of expansion for these various tapes, for both this standardization and the one of March 10, 1910, were assumed to be unchanged from the standardization of January, 1909 (p. 155). The equations of these tapes, furnished by the Bureau of Standards and resulting from the standardization in March, 1910, using 5 supports, are:

Values were also obtained at this time with the tapes on 3 supports. These values were not used on the Deming base, but are shown in the table on page 169 for the purpose of making a comparison with other values. The adopted equations of the tapes used in the final computation of the Deming base are:
T 610 =50 m+(12.382 mm켹.016 mm)+(o.0178 mm켹.0007 mm) (t-2s.8 C) T 617 =so m+(12.772 mm .01s mm)+( .0160 mm .0007 mm) (1-2s.8 C) T 621 =50 m+(13.048 mm .013 mm)+( .02os mm .ooo8 mm) (l-25.8 C)

These values were obtained by taking the weighted means of the equations furnished by the standardizations in May, 1909,and March, 1910. Each determination was given a weight inversely proportional to the probable error of the length of the tape. See page 160, which gives a statement regarding the manner of deriving the probable errors of the mean values of the equations of the tapes used on the Stanton base. In order to compare the lengths of the tapes obtained by two standardizations, before and after the measurement of the Deming base, values of the lengths were reduced to the mean temperature of standardizations, 25.8 C. The following table shows the comparison:

As tape 522 was not used at all in the field, the length of that tape is assumed to be constant and the difference in its values to be due to the accidental errors of the two standardizations.

APPENDIX 4. PRIMARY BASE LINES.

It is seen from the above table that in no case was the residual of a tape length from the mean of the two standardizations as much as three times the probable error of a single determination of that tape length, and we may therefore conclude that no one tape underwent any permanent change in length between the standardizations before and after the measurement of the Deming base. We are justified in assuming, as in the case of the Stanton base, that the differences shown are due to the standardizations; hence in formi_ng the adopted equation of each tape a mean of the two values was taken. The thermometers used during the measurements of the Deming base were similar to those used on the Stanton base. Their corrections are given in the following table:

REDUCTION TO SEA LEVEL.

Elevations referred to mean sea level were carried by spirit leveling from the Pacific coast to Deming, N. Mex., by the United States Geological Survey, using precise methods on a greater portion of the work; the remainder of the leveling was of a grade slightly less accurate than the precise leveling. The elevation at Deming was carried to the northern end of the Deming base by trigonometric leveling, the adopted value of the elevation of the surface mark at Deming north base being 1 278.582 meters. (See page 157 for the formula used in making the reduction to sea level.) The corrections for reducing the lengths of the sections to sea level are shown in the following table: Corrections for 1톏duction to sea level.

The probable error of the length of the base from aIJ sources= 7-93 millimeters. The methods of computing the probable errors are shown on pages 160 and 161.
COST OF DEMING BASE.

The triangulation party was engaged on the measurement of the Deming base line from the time of finishing the observations for horizontal directions at the south base on January 8, to and including' January 21, when the party moved from the base line to Deming to store the outfit and disband. It is believed that a fair estimate of the cost of field work during the measurement of the Deming base line is $600. This estimate was obtained from the accounts of the party and includes the pay and subsistence of the officers and men and the feed and care of teams between January 9 and 21 and the pay and subsistence of temporary employees while on the measurement of the base line and for several days previous to January 8 while clearing the line, also the cost of the lumber for the Stakes forming the tape supports, and the expressage of tapes and cOther base apparatus from the office to the field. This made the cost per kilometer measured $39 and the cost per mile $62, which is 30 per cent lower than the cost of the Stanton base line, shown on page 161 of this publication.

APPENDIX 4. PRIMARY BASE LINES.

Some of the reasons for the small field cost of the Deming base line were: ( l) The base was measured in the vicinity of the town at which the triangulation party would have been disbanded, hence no traveling expenses of light keepers from the several triangulation stations to Deming wei;e included in the cost of the base; (2) The base was measured after the completion of the triangulation, and the party was reduced in number to only what was needed for the base measurement; (3) Five supports were used for each tape length, thus permitting accurate measurements to be made under conditions which should prevent measuring when only three supports are used. No section was measured more than twice, and all measurements were made in daylight. The total cost of the Deming base line was as follows: Field expense, $600; standardizing* 4 tapes before and after measuring the base, $400 (see cost of Stanton base line, page 161), and office computations, $92-a total of $1,092. This made a cost of f>72 per kilometer and $116 per mile, which is 25 per cent less than the total cost per kilometer of the Stanton base line, 27 per cent less than the average total cost of the measurement of a kilometer in 1900-1901 t (both bars and tapes were used in measuring nine bases during that season and the total average cost of the work was $160 per kilometer), and 38 per cent less than the average total cost of a kilometer measured in 1906.:j:

SUMMARY OF TAPE VALUES.
In the following table are shown the values for the lengths. of the base tapes resulting from the three standardizations of January 22 and May 25, 1909, and March 10, 1910, reduced to a common temperature of 2 l 0 .2 C. These values are for the lengths of the tapes when resting on three points of support, and subjected to a fixed tension of 15 kilograms. There are shown also the probable errors of the lengths from the various standardizations, and the residuals from the straight mean of the lengths for each tape. At temperature of 21.2 C.

An examination of the above table will show that no residual is as large as five times the probable error of a single standardization, while the first and last standardizations give values which for no one tape differ as much as l part in 400 ooo. For tape
*The full price of $200 for a standardization of 4 tapes has been added to the cost of both the Stanton and Deming base lines for the stanpardization of the tapes in May, 1909. t Appendix 3, 1901, "On the measurement of nine primary bases.'' t Appendix 4, 1907, "Six primary bases measured with steel and invar tapes.''

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1910.
522 this difference amounts to 0.050 millimeter, and as that tape was carried in the field as a reserve, not being unreeled at either base line, we must assume this difference.to be due to the accidental errors of standardization. From the above we may conclude that thi.~ assumption holds good for the other tapes.

SPEED.

The following table shows the speed attained in the measurements of the two base lines. The times given are from the time of the first observation to that of the last on each day. There are included the times occupied in changing from one tape to another and in placing copper strips on the end stakes. Delays of long duration, such as stopping for luncheon, are not included in the column under the heading "Time." Speed with invar tapes.

The mean kilometers per hour on the Stanton base was r.86, and on the Deming base, l .99. The average (weighted) speed on the two bases is r.91 kilometers per hour.

CONCLUSIONS. Some of the conclusions which may be drawn from the measurements of the Stanton and Deming base lines are: The cost of measuring a single base line, or several base lines widely scattered, by the triangulation party when in the vicinity of each base line., will be much less than when measured by a party organized especially for measuring base lines. Where there are a number of base lines to be measured, which are not widely separated, as was the case on the ninety-eighth meridian, the cost would not be very different whether they were measured by the triangulation party or by a party organized foi: base-line measurements only. When a base is measured by a triangulation party, what may be called the unproductive periods, before and after the measurement, are eliminated. Such periods are usually occupied by traveling to and from the base and in organizing and disbanding the base party.

APPENDIX 4. PRIMARY BASE LINES.

The 50-meter tape has been found to be both convenient and satisfactory, thus confirming the conclusions based upon previous tape work in this survey. Invar tapes, with measurements made in daylight or at night, give results which have probable errors comparable with those obtained by the duplex base bars, which were used to measure the Salt Lake base, and in 1900-1901, in connection With steel tapes, in the measurement of 9 bases along the ninety-eighth meridian. It is not necessary to standardize invar tapes in the field. Owing to their smaller coefficients of expansion, invar tapes are better than steel tapes for measuring primary base lines. With proper care during measurements in the field, the invar tape does not appreciably change in length. While not so elastic as steel, yet it is sufficiently strong to withstand the ordinary shocks due to excessive tension, and no change in its length should be caused by using a reel which has a diameter of 16 inches or more. During the measurements, the tape should not be dragged along the ground but should be carried forward by the members of the measuring party. Caution is necessary to prevent giving the invar tapes sharp bends, as they are not so elastic as steel tapes. To minimize the effect of winds, the 50-meter invar tape should be supported by s . stakes, equally spaced, 2 of these being the end supports on which the markings of the tape lengths are made and the other 3 being the intermediate supports from which the tape is suspended. By using this number of supports, measurements may be made with an invar tape during wind which would make it impracticable to secure good results were the tape on only 3 supports, 1 at each end and 1 in the center. It is believed that more than 5 supports should not be used for a 50-meter tape, for with a decrease in the distance between supports the difficulty of obtaining the grade corrections is increased. The information contained in the reports of Assistant Hill was largely used in preparing this publication. The office, or final, computations of the two bases were made under the direction of Computer H. C. Mitchell. He also assisted the writer with valuable suggestions while preparing the manuscript for publication.

TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA, PART II.
By C. R. DUVALL and A. L. BALDWIN,
Computers, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

GENERAL STATEMENT. In Appendix 9, Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1904, "Triangulation in California, Part I," there is published upon the United States Standard Datum the results of the primary triangulation along the coast from Point Arena to the Mexican boundary and along the thirty-ninth parallel from the Pacific coat to the eastern boundary of the State, together with the results of the subordinate triangulation along the shore line between Monterey Bay and the southern boundary. The aim of the present appendix is to give upon the United States Standard Datum and in a convenient form for the use of the engineer, surveyor, and cartographer, the geographic positions of all additional triangulation stations from Monterey Bay northward to Trinidad Head, for which the computations are completed. Descriptions and elevations are given for these points 'as far as available. By means of the sketches and the index to positions, descriptions, and elevations, pages 399 to 429, any information herein contained may readily be found. In addition to the results that have already been published in the appendix referred to above and those contained in the present publication, there remains for future publication upon the United States Standard Datum triangulation in three localities in California, as follows: (1) A chain of primary triangulation following the Sacramento Valley from the vicinity of the thirty-ninth parallel to the Oregon boundary and thence to Tacoma, Wash., the results of which will soon be published; (2) the tertiary triangulation along the eastern boundary of the State, which was published on the Yolo Datum as Appendix 3, Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1900, under the title, "The oblique boundary line between California and Nevada;" (3) the tertiary triangulation along the coast line from Trinidad Head to the Oregon boundary. During the field season of 1908 the observations connecting the tertiary triangulation in this third locality with the primary and secondary triaqgulation of Oregon were completed. The final computations of this triangulation can now be made with the desired check. The earliest observations of the triangulation under consideration in this appendix were made in 185 1, and the latest in 1907. The points are located principally along the tide-water shore line from Monterey Bay to Trinidad Head. The positions are given, however, of a number of far inland astronomic stations and their local connection with the triangulation, together with those of a few mountain peaks in the interior ' the eastern boundary of the State. Besides these interior points just menand near tioned, some of the primary and subprimary stations, which control the smaller triangulation, are 75 kilometers or more from the coast; but with these comparatively. few exceptions the points of this appendix are the subordinate triangulation stations used in the hydrographic and topographic surveys of the shore line.

This triangulation was done primarily to determine the effect of the earthquake of April 18, 1906, on the relative positions of points in the disturbed area and to replace that part of the old triangulation which might be found so distorted as to destroy its value. The results of this investigation are published as Appendix 3, Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1907, "The earth movements in the California earthquake of 1906." This paper is limited to a discussion of the earth movements, as is indicated by the title, so it remains for the present appendix to give the complete tables of positions, with the accompanying sketches and descriptions of the 1906-7 triangulation. In all, 61 old points were recovered and their positions redetermined. In the table of positions two or three values are given for each of these 61 points. The values in italics are for the 1906-7 position and are to be used when the present relative positions of the points are desired. The other values, for one or two positions, as the case may be, are the positions before the earthquake of 1906, the affixed date showing whether the values are for the position before or after 1868. It was found on making the computations that observations made before and after 1868, when computed separately, showed that there had been a real change in the relative positions during the interval in which the earthquake of 1868 occurred. For details of these movements, see tables 2 and 3 of Appendix 3 of 1907. PRDIARY TRIANGULATION OF 1906-7.
[Sketches>, 3, 6.]

The adjustments of this work were made in two figures. The first, sketch 2, is based on the two fixed lines, Mount Diablo to Mocho and Mocho to Santa Ana. The positions of these three points arc held as given in Appendix 9, Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1904, "Triangulation in California, Part I." The angles at Mount Toro, Gavilan, and Loma Prieta were measured with a 10-inch Gambey repeating theodolite. As a general thing, ten measures of six repetitions each were made of the separate angles, with the single condition of closing the horizon, though there was an occasional departure from this rule. The angles at Sierra Morena and Mocho were measured with a 12-inch direction theodolite in sixteen positions. In the two closed triangles the closing error is for Loma Prieta, Sierra Morena, and Mocho, 0 11 .06; and for Gavilan, Mount Toro, and Loma Prieta, 4".88. Tl:ie probable error of an observed direction, resulting from the adjustment of the seven conditions involving twenty directions, is  o" .88. The corrections to the separate direc-

The second primary figure adjustment, sketch 3, is based on the line Sierra Morena to Mount Diablo, as fixed in the preceding adjustment. The angles at Sierra :;\forcna and Red Hill were measured with a 12-inch direction theodolite in sixteen positions. At the other occupied points of the figure the angles were measured with a r 2-inch Gambey repeating theodolite. Twenty-six measures of six repetitions each were made of the primary angles at these stations, with the single condition of closing the horizon. Farallon Light-house was not observed as a primary. From Sierra ::'1-Iorena it was observed on in five of the sixteen positions of the direction instrument, while at the other five stations angles were observed on it varying in number from ten to twenty-four sets of six repetitions each. The corrections to the directions arising from the figure adjustment do not show that these lines were of an inferior grade of accuracy. There are 5 closed triangles in the figure, with an average closing error of 1 ".35 and a maximum of 1".70. The probable error of an observed direction is 켹".32. The number of conditions satisfied is 13, and the number of directions 36.

direction resulting from satisfying the two conditions is  1".20, with a maximum correction to a direction of 2 11  24. (See sketch 6.) Lick Observ"atory small dome was observed from only four points, viz: Mocho, Loma Prieta, Sierra Morena, and Red Hill. The adjustment of the two conditions gave 켌 ".40 as the probable error of an observed direction, with a maximum correction to a direction of 2 ". s 2. (See sketch 6.)

[Sketch 7.]

The occupied stations of this triangulation and one unoccupied station, Black Ridge 2, were adjusted at one time, there being 32 directions in the figure with 13 conditions to satisfy. The adjustment is based on the position of San Bruno Mountain, as fixed by the secondary triangulation of 1906-7, holding the direction of the line San Bruno Mountain to Black Ridge 2 from the 1907 observations, but using the length of this line as fixed by the triangulation of 1899. The maximum correction to a direction is 2".2, while the average closing error of l 1 triangles is 4".o, with a maximum error of closure of 10".2. TERTIARY TRIANGULATION oF ToMALES BAY, 1906.

This work is based on the line Tomales Bay to Bodega, as fixed in the second primary figure of 1906-7.

[Sketch 9.]

The principal adjustments, based on the line Ross Mountain to Bodega Head of 1906-7, were made in four figures--one of I 2 conditions, one of 10, one of 5, and one of 4. The maximum correction to a direction is 5 ".9. There are 20 closed triangles with an average closing error of 3 11 .7 and a maximum of 12".3. In the table of positions the date 189I is given to some of the old 1861 points of this vicinity for purposes of earthquake movement comparisons. The corresponding position depends on the primary work of I 891, though the point was established in 1861. In such cases the description shows when the station was established. TERTIARY TRIANGULATION IN THE VICINITY 01<' POINT ARENA, 1906.
[Sketch 10.J

This triangulation is based on the line Fisher to Cold Spring, as fixed by the triangulation of 1891 and published in Appendix 9, Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for l 904, "Triangulation in California, Part I." The connection with the other triangulation of I 906-7 is through the primary work done before the 1906 earthquake. There is a possibility that the line Fisher to Cold Spring was displaced at the time of the earthquake of 1906, though it is very improbable that it was appreciably changed in length or azimuth. Hence the present relative positions of the new points in this

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1910.

locality are very probably correctly expressed in the tables of positions. All the latitudes and longitiudes, however, of the I<}06 triangulation stations on Point Arena are in error by as much as the line Fisher to Cold Spring has been displaced. Evidence afforded by a comparison of the old and new triangulation between Monterey Bay and Ross Mountain shows that such displacement must have been very small and is most likely masked by the errors of observation of the triangulation. See Appendix 3, Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1907, "The earth movements in the California earthquake of 1906." , The principal points of this work are fixed by four figure adjustments-one of 8 conditions, one of 3, and two of 2 each. The maximum correction to a direction is 4 11 .3, and the average closing error of 7 triangles is 2 11 .9, with a maximum of 5 11 .5.
OLD TRIANGULATION AND THE EARTHQUAKE OF 1906.

In the tables of positions for the 1 906-7 work the values both before and after the earthquake of 1906 will be found, one just preceding the other. A comparison will show that many of the lines have undergone large changes in length and azimuth. The line Hans to Foster, for example, one of the Tomales. Bay lines, determined both before and after the 1906 earthquake, has been changed in length by about one part in r ooo and in azimuth by about 5'.1. The latitudes and longitudes are changed by corresponding amounts. Since 95 per cent or more of the positions given in the present appendix depend entirely on observations made before the earthquake of 1906, and since such large changes are known to have taken place in the positions of the re-determined points, it is important to determine whether similar changes have taken place in the positions of this large percentage of old points, and to derive the probable values of such changes as far as the information at hand permits. The method of deriving these changes is based on the results arrived at in Appendix 3, Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for l 907, "The earth movements in the California earthquake of 1906," summarized on pages 81, 82, 91, and 92, as follows:
First, points on opposite sides of the fault moved in opposite directions, those to the eastward of the fault in a southerly direction, and those to the westward in a northerly direction. Second, the displacements of all points were approximately parallel to the fault. Third, the displacements on each side of the fault were less the greater the distance of the displaced points from the fault. Fourth, for points on opposite sides of the fault and the same distance from it, those on the western side were displaced on an average about twice as much as those on the eastern side. * * * On the eastern side of the fault, ten points at an average distance of I.5 kilometers (0.9 mile) from the fault have an average displacement of 1.54 meters (5. I feet), three points at an average distance of 4.2 kilometers (2.6 miles) have an average displacement of o.86 meter (2.8 feet), and one point, Mount Tamalpais, at 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) from the fault, has a displacement of 0.58 meter (r.9 feet). These fourteen points arc the only ones on the eastern side of the fault for which the observed displacements were determined with reasonable certainty. For no point to the eastward of the fault at a greater distance than 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) was any displacement detected with certainty. To the westward, twelve points at an average distance of 2 kilometers (I.2 miles) from the fault have an average displacement of 2.95 meters (9.7 feet). Seven at an average distance of 5.8 kilometers (3.6 miles) have an average displacement of 2.38 meters (7 .8 feet). The only other point to the westward of the fault of which the displacement was determined with certainty was Farallon Light-house, distant 37 kilometers (23 miles) and displaced i.78 meters (5.8 feet).

For convenience of reference to serve also as a warning, this fault line of 1906 is shown on all the sketches for both the old and the new triangulation. Running

and

APPENDIX 5. TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA, PART II.

southward, it crosses the shore line just north of Point Arena and reaches a maximum inland distance in this locality of about 7 kilometers. Continuing nearly parallel to the coast line which it slowly approaches, the fault crosses out to sea again in the vicinity of Fort Ross. It is next traced where it crosses Bodega Head at a distance of about 2.5 kilometers from the extreme point. Then, following Bodega and Tamales bays southward, it crosses the land to Bolinas Bay and is again lost in the sea. The land is finally entered in the vicinity of Colma, from which locality the fault has been traced southward to San Juan in San Benito County. In the second paragraph quoted, it is stated that no displacement was discovered with certainty at a greater distance east of the fault than 6.4 kilometers. This extreme eastern displacement is for Mount Tamalpais, a primary station, determined with the highest degree of accuracy both before and after the earthquake of 1906. For Ross Mountain, another primary station, also determined with the highest grade of accuracy before and after the 1906 earthquake, the displacement of 0.53 meter is doubtful; that is, for this primary station, only 7 kilometers east of the fault, the observed displacement is not much larger than the uncertainty of position arising from errors of observation. Hence, for the 80 per cent or more of old points in the present appendix which are east of the fault and at a greater distance than 7 kilometers, it is reasonable to assume that there has been no disturbance large enough to be detected by the triangulation. These old points are, as a rule, determined with a low grade of accuracy, and the consequent uncertainty of position is much larger for them than for a primary triangulation station like Ross Mountain. It will be necessary, then, to compute corrections to be applied to the old positions, only for those points east of the fault that are within a distance of 7 kilometers. It is believed, however, that all the old points on the San Francisco peninsula and in the vicinity of Pulgas base should be used with caution, and they are so marked in the tables of positions. Practically all the old points in this appendix that lie west of the fault have been disturbed. At Farallon Light-house 37 kilometers west the displacement is certain. All the other points to the westward, for which displacements have been determined with certainty, are much nearer the fault than Farallon Light-house. The assumption that the general movement extended as far west as 37 kilometers seems to be justified, though it rests on the evidence furnished by this single point. Over against the fact that the motion near the fault is determined from the mean of a number of points, so that the effect of errors of observation is presumably eliminated, is to be placed the fact that the two determinations of Farallon Light-house, before and after the 19o6 earthquake, are much stronger than the average for points near the fault. The question of corrections for earthquake movements is to be considered, therefore, for all old points as far west of the fault as Farallon Light-house and for all old points less than 7 kilometers distant on the eastern side. This includes all old points west of the fault except a few island summits and rocks among the Farallon Islands, which arc slightly farther west than the light-house. The corrections are computed only for definitely marked points, determined with a check, for which it may reasonably be assumed that the markings are still in existence. For other points that lie in the disturbed area, such as nocheck points, points that are lost or probably lost, summits and rocks, attention is called to the fact that the positions have probably been disturbed, without attempting

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 19ro.

to give the amount of disturbance. In the case where a new point of 1906-7 has been established in the near vicinity of an old point, no corrections have been computed, even though the old point may not be Jost. Referring again to the second paragraph quoted, it is seen that the magnitude of the displacement is given for three different distances from the fault, for both the eastern and western sides. Take the case for either side and plot three points with abscissre proportional to the three distances from the fault, and ordinates proportional to the three corresponding displacements, draw a smooth curve through the three points thus plotted, and the ordinate corresponding to any abscissa, or distance from the fault, will be the displacement for that distance. Two such curves were drawn one for the eastern side of the fault and one for the western, and lhe magnitudes of the displacements for the different points were thus graphically computed. These displacements, all assumed parallel to the fault, were then transformed into changes in latitude, longitude, length, and azimuth. The 톜esults arrived at by applying these corrections are placed in a separate table and referred to by footnotes to the original tables of positions. Only those corrections are taken account of that are appreciably larger than the uncertainties in the corresponding values, arising from errors of observation. In all other cases a note of warning is given. No attempt has been made to apply these corrections so as to maintain the consistency between the two systems of coordinates; that is, after the corrections have been applied the latitudes and longitudes may not agree with the lengths and azimuths out to the last figure. The general plan, outlined above, of inferring displacements and deriving the resulting corrections was departed from in the foJlowing three cases: (1) Owing to the conflicting evidence and uncertainty of displacement at the southern end of San Francisco Bay, no displacements were computed for that locality, though a number of points on the eastern side were nearer the fault than 7 kilometers; (2) between the triangula. tion stations Pescadero and Santa Cruz Light-house the general method was modified so as gradually to conform to the actually observed displacement at Santa Cruz Lighthouse; (3) points in the vicinity of Monterey Bay were not corrected, owing to the uncertainty of displacement.
THE EARTHQUAKE OF 1868.

In a preceding paragraph it has been stated that there was an appreciable disturbance of the relative positions of many of the points given in this appendix at about the time of the earthquake of 1868. The information at hand concerning the movement indicates that a large block of the earth's crust, from the Golden Gate to some distance north of Ross Mountain, was bodily displaced in a northerly direction, without rotation or distortion. In the vicinity of the southern part of San Francisco Bay the motion was somewhat irregular and uncertain. Farther south, toward Monterey Bay, there was a large and unquestionable motion in a southerly direction. It is not thought that any of the results in the present appendix are seriously in error on account of this 1868 disturbance. The relative positions of points within the large area that moved to the northward have not been affected, and the effect of the motion on the positions of these points with respect to points outside the disturbed region has been largely compensated for by the, method of adjustment. The primary

APPENDIX 5. TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA, PART II.

triangulation which controls this whole region has all been done since 1868. The old work, done before 1868, was made to conform to the new primary triangulation done between 1868 and 1892. In the same way, it is believed that the effect of the disturbances to the southward has been largely eliminated by making the work done before 1868 fit that done between 1868 and 1892. The adjustments that fix the old points given in this appendix were made in this manner without any reference to earthquake disturbances, but with the sole object of bringing the results into accord. It was known that the old work received much larger corrections than the observations seemed to warrant, but for only one station, Mount Tamalpais, was it recognized, when the adjustments were made, that the earthquake motion must be taken into consideration. For this point two positions were used in the old adjustments that fix the old positionsone for the position before 1868, and one for ~hat after 1868. In this way, also, the effect of the earthquake of 1868 on the results in this appendix was partly eliminated.

This triangulation has a wide range of accuracy. Some of the larger controlling triangulation of l85I-1854 is of the primary grade, with an average error of closure of triangles not much in excess of one second. Much of the smaller triangulation, done for use in hydrography and topography, falls below the present standard for tertiary triangulation, which is that the average error of closure of triangles shall be from four to five seconds. A large part of the area covered by this triangulation lies within the region known to have been disturbed by the earthquake of 1906. Having this fact in view, and remembering also the large number of stations involved, some occupied ten or more times by as many different observers, and the complicated overlapping of the triangles, it is deemed impracticable to go into details concerning the procedure in adjustments and the accuracy of results.

A large part of this area is covered by the new triangulation of 1906-7, the positions of which are to be used whenever the best values of the present relative positions are desired. The old points of this whole section have, no doubt, been disturbed by the earthquake of 1906. The fault line accompanying this earthquake crosses the lines of the triangulation in many places, and is nowhere far enough away from the scheme of old points in this locality to leave them undisturbed. Corrections have been computed for all these old points and are referred to in footnotes to the tables of positions. In view of the complications arising from the proximity of all the old points of this section to the fault line of 1906, it is useless to go into details in regard to the accuracy. All that need be said is that this triangulation is well controlled by the primary, with which it is connected in several places.

POINT ARENA To SHELTER CovE, 1870-1897.
[Sketches >6 to >9.]

It is not believed that the earthquake disturbance of i906 has appreciably affected the relative positions at a greater distance than 15 to 20 kilometers north of Point Arena. Corrections have been computed accordingly, and are referred to in footnotes to the tables of positions, for all points from Point Arena to the triangulation station Cavanaugh. In addition to the starting length from the Point Arena base there is in this chain the further control of three bases, viz, Navarro Ridge base, Ten Mile River Beach base, and the Shelter Cove base. The discrepancies in length at Ten Mile River Beach base, as brought from the north and south, were 34 and 25 in the sixth decimal place of the logarithms, or one part in 13 ooo and 17 ooo, respectively. The discrepancy in length between the Point Arena base and the Navarro Ridge base was about one part in 250. The final corrections to the directions showed that this extremely large ratio was mostly due to the unfavorable shape of the triangles through the small angles of which the length had to be computed. The latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths, as brought from the south, were made to conform to the primary triangulation station, Chemise Mountain, which is at the northern extremity of this section. The discrepancies at this point in latitude, longitude, and azimuth were o".221, o".03 I, and 34"-4, respectively. The mean error of closure of 327 triang-les is 7 11 .6, with a maximum of 42".2. The scheme connecting points in Ukiah with the main body of the triangulation (sketch 36) is based on the primary line Paxton to Mount Sanhedrin, the lengths being checked by a local base. Sm;;LTER CovE To TRINIDAD HEAD, 1854-1872.
[Sketches 30 to 33.]

This section is controlled at the southern end by the length of the Shelter Cove base and the latitude, longitude, and azimuth at the primary station, Chemise Mountain. The length is further held by the base at Humboldt bay, while the latitude, longitude, and azimuth are subject to the conditions of bringing out those at the primary station, Bear Ridge. The discrepancies were as follows: In length, r 13 in the sixth decimal place of the logarithms, or one part in 4 ooo; in azimuth, 63"; in latitude, o".469; and in longitude o".230. The mean error of closure of 288 triangles is 13".9, with a maximum of 112".5. This maximum value occurs in a triangle with one side barely over 200 meters long, and the large mean error is due, in great part, to the many short lines over which observations were made. INLAND PE:AKS AND ASTRONOMIC STATIONS.
[Sketches 34 to 40.]

The positions of the mountain peaks given in this appendix are determined principally from the primary stations of which the positions were published in Appendix. 9, Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for I 904, "Triangulation in California, Part I." When the final results are published for the primary triangulation following the Sacra-

APPENDIX 5. TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA, PART II.

mento Valley northward from the thirty-ninth parallel of latitude the positions of a number of additional peaks will be given, and others still will be available when the final computations are made for the tertiary triangulation along the oblique boundary between California and Nevada. An astronomic station is always either near or identical with a triangulation station, generally a primary station. The connection with the triangulation is often made by a measurement of ,the distance and direction to the astronomic station. In several cases the connection is made by a small local triangulation. The positions are given for the points of such connecting triangulation, though these points are often not permanently marked. This small triangulation is shown, on separate sketches, for Marysville, Mount Helena, Mount Hamilton, and Mount Conness.
ADJUSTMENT OF THE SUBORDINATE TRIANGULATION.

All inconsistencies have been ehminated by least square adjustments from the results set forth in the tables of positions. That is, the sum of the three adjusted angles of each triangle is equal to 180 plus the spherical excess; from whatever line and through whatever chain of triangles the length and azimuth of a given line are computed the results will be the same as those given in the tables of positions for that line, and from whatever point and through whatever chain of lines the latitude and longitude of a given point arc computed the results will be the same as those given in the tables of positions for that point. In the preceding statements no account is taken of those small discrepancies in the last place that arise from accumulations of neglected figures in the next place to the right of the last place used. The process of adjustment is to start from the large primary work and gradually come down to the triangulation of the lower grades of accuracy. The points selected at each step, to be fixed by one figure adjustment, arc somewhat arbitrarily chosen, the general aim being to get the best results from the observations at hand, without unduly extending the amount of computation. At each stage in the process, then, those points are taken for the next adjustment that are most strongly determined, the number of points taken and the consequent amount of computation involved corresponding in a general way to the importance of the results to be attain.ed. Thus, the important points of the larger, controlling triangulation arc adjusted, several at a time, in figures involving a large number of conditions, using all the available observations. Points of less importance are adjusted one or two at a time, often not making use of every observed line. In case only a part of the observations are used, those selected are for the lines that give the least uncertainty of position for a given uncertainty of direction. The lengths and azimuths of the remaining lines, the observations of which have received no weight in the adjustment, are computed to fit the position thus fixed by the selected lines. Hence, the azimuths and lengths of all lines observed over, whether from both ends or from one end only, are to be found in the tables of positions. In the case of unoccupied points, determined by intersections, such as chimneys, smokestacks, flagstaffs, cupolas, and spires, the general rule followed has been to make the determination depend upon not more than four lines; that is to say, upon not more than two conditional ,equations. More than two conditions have occasionally been used for such points, when their positions were to be used further in fixing other points.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, z9zo.

When a chain of subordinate triangulation closes upon itself or upon previously fixed primary work, there arise discrepancies in latitude and longitude, or in latitude, longitude, azimuth, and length, according as the loop is closed on a point or on a line. This introduces either two or four conditions, in addition to the usual angle, side, and length equations, viz, a latitude equation and a longitude equation; or a latitude equation, a longitude equation, an azimuth equation, and a length equation. In subordinate triangulation, these additional circuit-closure conditions, two or four, as the case may be, are satisfied in a separate adjustment, after a preliminary adjustment has been made of a part or all the other conditions. The least laborious process used is to close up a continuous chain of the best-shaped triangles, connecting the two fixed extremities of the network, by applying one-third of the error of closure of each triangle to each separate angle of the triangle. This is a least square adjustment of the angles (not directions) of this selected chain of triangles. Through the chain of triangles thus adjusted the discrepancies of circuit closure are computed and a least square adjustment is made of the results of the preliminary adjustment, satisfying the conditions of circuit closure. This second adjustment gives the final positions for a chain of triangles fitting between the originally fixed extremities. All other observed Jines and points of the chain, in addition to those thus fixed, are now computed either by the simple solution of triangles in the case of the undetermined diagonal of a fixed quadrilateral, or by a least-square adjustment in the case of a point not in the selected chain. A plan more often followed is to satisfy all the angle and side conditions by preliminary adjustments, in several steps, as a rule, and then to satisfy the conditions of circuit closure, in the same way as just described by making a least-square adjustment of a selected chain of these closed triangles. The adjustments are then completed as described above.
THE UNITED STATES STANDARD DATUM.

All of the positions and azimuths have been computed upon the Clarke spheroid of 1866, as expressed in meters, which has been in use in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for many years. After a spheroid has been adopted and all the angles and lengths in a triangulation have been fully fixed, it is still necessary, before the computation of latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths can be made, to adopt a standard latitude and longitude for a specified station and a standard azimuth of a line from that station. For convenience the adopted standard position (latitude and longitude) of a given station, together with the adopted standard azimuth of a line from that station, is called the geodetic datum. The primary triangulation in the United States was commenced at various points, and existed at first as a number of detached portions in each of which the geodetic datum was necessarily dependent only upon the astronomic stations connected with that particular portion. As examples of such detached portions of triangulation there may be mentioned the early triangulation in New England and along the Atlantic coast, a detached portion of the transcontinental triangulation centering on St. Louis and another portion of the same triangulation in the Rocky jfountain region, and three separate portions of triangulation in California in the latitude of San Francisco, in the vicinity of Santa Barbara channel, and in the vicinity of San Diego. With the lapse of time these separate pieces have expanded until they have touched or overlapped.

APPENDIX 5. TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA, PART II.

The transcontinental triangulation, of which the office computation was completed in 1899, joins all of the detached portions mentioned and makes them one continuous triangulation. As soon as this took place the logical necessity existed of discarding the old geodetic data used in these various pieces and substituting one datum for the whole country, or at least for as much of the country as is covered by continuous triangulation. To do this is a very heavy piece of work, and involved much preliminary study to determine the best datum to be adopted. On March 13, 1901, the Superintendent adopted what is now kno.wn as the United States Standard Datum, and it was decided to reduce the positions to that datum as rapidly as possible. The datum adopted was that formerly in use in New England, and therefore its adoption did not affect the positions which had been used for geographic purposes in New England and along the Atlantic coast to North Carolina, nor those in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The adopted datum does not agree, however, with that used in "The transcontinental triangulation" and in "The eastern oblique arc of the United States," publications which deal primarily with the purely scientific problem of the determination of the figure of the earth and which were prepared for publication before the adoption of the new datum. As the adoption of such a standard datum is a matter of considerable importance, it is in order here to explain the desirability of this step more fully. The main objects to be attained by the geodetic operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are, first, the control of the charts published by the Survey; second, the furnishing of geographic positions (latitudes and longitudes), of accurately determined elevations, and of distances and azimuths, to officers connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey and to other organizations; third, the determination of the figure of the earth. The first two of these objects are purely practical; the third is purely scientific. For the first and second objects it is not necessary that the reference spheroid should be accurately that which most closely fits the geoid within the area covered, nor that the adopted geodetic datum should be absolutely the best that can be derived from the astronomic observations at hand. It is simply desirable that the reference spheroid and the geodetic datum adopted shall be, if possible, such a close approximation to the truth that any correction which may hereafter be derived from the observations which are now or may become available shall not greatly exceed the probable errors of such corrections. It is, however, very desirable that one spheroid and one geodetic datum be used for the whole country. In fact, this is absolutely necessary if a geodetic survey is to perform fully the function of accurately coordinating all surveys within the area which it covers. This is the most important function of a geodetic survey. To perform this function it is also highly desirable that when a certain spheroid and geodetic datum have been adopted for a country they should he rigidly adhered to without change for all time, unless shown to be largely in error. In striving to attain the third object, the determination of the figure of the earth, the conditions are decidedly different. This problem concerns itself primarily with' astronomic observations of latitude, longitude, and azimuth, and with the geodetic positions of the points at which the astronomic observations were made, but is not concerned with the geodetic positions of other points fixed by the triangulations. The geodetic positions (latitudes and longitudes) of comparatively few points are therefore concerned in this problem. However, in marked contrast to the statements made in

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

i910.

preceding paragraphs, it is desirable in dealing with this problem that, with each new important accession of data, a new spheroid fitting the geoid with the greatest possible accuracy, and new values of the geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths of the highest degree of accuracy, should be derived. The United States Standard Datum was adopted with reference to positions furnished for geographic purposes, but has no reference to the problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. It is adopted with reference to the engineer's problem of furnishing standard positions, and .does not affect the scientist's problem of the determination of the figure of the .earth. The principles which guided in the selection of the datum to be adopted were: First, that the adopted datum should not differ widely from the ideal datum for which the sum of the station errors in latitude, longitude, and azimuth should each be zero; second, it was desirable that the adopted datum should produce minimum changes in the publications of the Survey, including its charts; and, third, it was desirable, other things being equal, to adopt that datum which allowed the maximum number of positions already in the office registers to remain unchanged, and therefore necessitated a minimum amount of new computation. These considerations led to the adoption as the United States Standard of the datum which had been in use for many years in the northeastern group of States and along the Atlantic coast as far as North Carolina. An examination of the station errors available in 1903, on the United States Standard Datum, at 246 latitude stations, 76 longitude stations, and I 52 azimuth stations, scattered widely over the United States from Maine to touisiana and to California, indicated that this datum approaches closely the ideal with which the algebraic sum of the station errors of each class would be zero. The adopted United States Standard Datum, upon which the positions and azimuths given in this publication depend, may be defined in terms of the position of the station Meades Ranch as fotlows:

Points are then said to be upon the United States Standard Datum when they are connected with the station Meades Ranch by a continuous triangulation, through which the corresponding latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths have been computed on the Clarke spheroid of 1 866, as expressed in meters, starting from the above data. Appendix 9, Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1904, entitled "Triangulation in California, Part I," and Appendix 3, Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1907, "The earth movements in the California earthquake of 1906," are the only publications of this Office, previous to the present one, in which California positions are given upon the United States Standard Datum. Appendices 9 and 3, Reports of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1885 and 1900, respectively, and special publication No. 4 1 "The transcontinental triangulation, 1900," give positions in California which are not upon the United States Standard Datum. The principal lists of positions heretofore published upon the Standard Datum throughout the whole United States are contained in the following publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and of other organizations:

LENGTHS.

The lengths from Monterey Bay to the vicinity of Point Arena, for the triangulation both before and after the earthquake of 1906, are controlled by the Yolo base, the Pulgas base, and the Los Angeles base. From Point Arena northward the lengths of the small shore line triangulation are controlled principally by five small bases, viz, Point Arena base, Navarro Ridge base, Ten Mile River Beach base, Shelter Cove base, and Humboldt Bay base. As far north as the primary station Bear Ridge, which is north of Cape Mendocino, positions of this small shore line triangulation are controlled by the primary triangulation, and to some extent the lengths are thus indirectly controlled by the primary work. The lengths as given are all reduced to sea level. If the actual length of a line simply reduced to the horizontal is desired, it may be obtained with all the accuracy ordinarily needed by adding to the sea level length as given a correction=(length of Mean elevation of two ends of line in meters) . The maximum value line as given) ( 6370000 of this correction does not exceed 1 n\ lf of the length for any portion of the triangulation here published. The maximum error made in the use of the above approximate formula for the correction does not exceed H -o'ij lf lf of the length for any portion of this. triangulation.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,
TABLES OF POSITIONS.

1910.

In the tables of positions the latitude and longitude of each point are given and also the len'th and azimuth of each line observed over, whether one or both ways. This is, in ,I way, a duplication, as the lengths and azimuths are implicitly contained in the corresponding latitudes and longitudes, while, on the other hand, from the latitude and longitude of a single point all the remaining latitudes and longitudes may be derived by means of the given lengths and azimuths. The amount of computation involved in transforming one of these systems of coordinates into the other is so great that it is necessary to have the double system for the convenient use of tables of positions. Along with the latitude and longitude of each point the lengths and azimuths are given of all lines from that point to other points of the triangulation, except that lengths and azimuths already given are not repeated. For the convenience of the draftsman a column of "seconds in meters" is given, in which is placed the length (in meters) of each small arc of meridian or parallel corresponding to the seconds of a given latitude or longitude. To facilitate further the use of the tahles of positions, a column is given for the logarithms of the lengths. The rule followed in recent publications of this Office has been to give the latitudes and longitudes to thousandths of seconds for all points the positions of which are fixed by fully adjusted triangulation. In the present publication exceptions have been made in the following two cases: (1) Points not definitely marked or which are not in themselves well-defined objects for pointing upon, such as most of the mountain summits, rocks, and points of land; (2) astronomic stations that are not triangulation stations proper, but connected therewith by linear measurements or by small local triangulation. These exceptions are made in the present .case to save the labor of changing computations already made. The latitudes and longitudes are given to hundredths of seconds, then, in the present appendix for the two classes of points mentioned above and also for points determined without a check. In the columns giving azimuths, distances, and logarithms of distances various numbers of decimal places are given, the intention being to indicate the accuracy to a certain extent, it being understood that in each quantity two doubtful figures are given. In some cases there is very little doubt of the correctness of the second figure from the right, and in a few cases some doubt may be cast upon the third figure. These tables may be conveniently consulted by using as finders the forty sketches at the end of this appendix, and the index, on pages 399 to 429. In the third column of the index will be found for each point a reference to the page on which its description is given, in the fourth column the sketches on which it occurs, and in the fifth column the page on which its elevation above sea level may be found.

LATITUDES, LONGITUDES, AZIMUTHS, AND LENGTHS CORRECTED FOR THE 1906 EARTHQUAKE.

The following table gives the resulting values of the coordinates after corrections for the 1906 earthquake have been applied. These corrections have been computed in accordance with the method described on pages I82-4. In those cases where the corrections have appreciably exceeded the probable errors of the quantities under consideration, the corrected values are tabulated below. These corrected values are to supersede the corresponding quantities in the main body of the tables of positions. Corrections to the latitudes and longitudes have been applied to hundredths of seconds and the results are given to hundredths. All azimuth corrections of. ten seconds or more have been applied and the results are given to seconds. All length corrections as large as one part in 5 ooo have been applied and the results are given to tenths of meters.

APPENDIX 5. TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA, PART II.

29r

In combining inferred displacements with those actually observed, some contradictions have arisen. For example, lines lying entirely on one side of the fault were turned in azimuth in a counter clockwise direction, at the time of the 1906 earthquake, according to the assumed laws of displacement. It will be found on examination that clockwise corrections have been applied to such lines in cases where the observed displacement of one end of the line did not conform closely with the assumed laws of displacement as applied to the other end.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS.

This list may be conveniently consulted by reference to the illustrations at the end of this publication and to the index .. All directions in the descriptions given in the form of azimuths are reckoned continuously from south around hr, west to 360, west being 90, north 180, and east

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1910.

27oc. The azimuths are true; where magnetic bearings are given they are indicated as such. In general, the surlace and underground marks are not in contact, so that a disturbance of the surlace mark will not usually affect the underground mark. The underground mark should be resorted to only when there is evidence that the surlace mark has been disturbed. Any person who finds that one of the stations here described has been disturbed, or that the description no longer fits the facts, is requested to send such information to "Superintendent, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D. C."
GENERAL NOTES IN REGARD TO STATION MARKS. NoTE i.-The station was marked by a copper tack in the center of a redwood block buried 3 feet below the surlace of the ground. Over this was placed a stub projecting 1 foot above the ground. Four stubs were driven, each 6 feet from the center, and usually to the north, south, east, and west, and the lines joining them diagonally intersect at the center. , NOTE 2.-The station was marked by a pine stub 3 feet long with its top even with the surlace of the ground. The reference marks were four stubs, placed each 6 feet from the center, and usually to the north, south, east, and west of it. Usually there was a nail, covered with a cartridge shell, in the center stub, and a nail in each of the four reference stubs. NoTE 3.-The station was marked by a stub in the top of which was a nail with a cartridge placed over it. Four witness stubs, each with a nail in top, were placed 6 feet from the center, to the north, south, east, and west. NoTE 4.-The station was marked by a stone with a drill hole one-half to 1Yz inches deep, buried 3 feet below the surlace of the ground, and the three theodolite stubs were left. In many cases a mound of earth was made over the station, making the underground mark about 6 feet below the top of the mound. NOTE 5.-The station was marked by a nail in a large stub, and by four similar stubs, each 6 feet from the center. Diagonal lines connecting these stubs interi?ect at the center at approximately right angles. NoTE 6.-The station was marked by a stub 3 feet long, the top level with the surlace of the ground, and by four stubs, each 6 feet from the center, and to the north, south, east, and '\Vest of it. NoTE 7.-The station was marked by a stub, usually of redwood, and 3 feet long, with its top even with the surlace of the ground. NoTE 8.-The station was marked by a drill hole three-fourths inch in diameter and 3 inches deep, in a stone buried 3 feet underground; over this stone was placed a redwood stub projecting about 1 Yz feet above the ground, and having a copper nail in its top. The reference marks were four stubs, each with a nail in its top, placed 6 feet from the center and projecting 1 ~ feet above ground. Non; 9.-The station was marked by a one-half-inch drill hole in a stone buried 2 feet underground. The reference marks were drill holes in three stones placed even with the surface of the ground, 6 feet from the center in the, directions given.

APPENDIX 5. TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA, PART II.

NoTE 10.-The station was marked by three stubs, each having a copper nail in its top, 6 feet from the center of the station, two placed in line with the station, and the third at right angles to that line. NoTE 1 I.-The station was marked by a section of 5-inch earthenware pipe filled with coal cinders, its top level with the surface of the ground. NoTE 12.-The station was marked by a bottle buried 3 or more feet deep, and by three stubs each with a copper nail in its top, driven in the ground even with the surface, and 6 feet from the center. NoTE 13.-The station was marked by a stone buried feet or less below the surface of the ground, and having in its top a lead bolt marked with cross lines. Three stones similarly marked were placed at or near the surface of the ground, 6 feet from the center, usually two in line with the center and the third at right angles to that line. NoTE 14.-The station was marked by a bottle set neck up, 2V2 feet below the surface of the ground. Over it was driven a stub 2 feet long, top level with the surface, and usually having a tack in its top to mark the exact center. NoTE 15.-The station was marked by a section of 27:!-inch iron gas pipe, 2 feet long, set so that from '2 to 5 inches of its top projects above the surface of the ground. No톜n i6.-The station was marked by a bottle buried about 2 feet below the surface of the ground, and by a surface mark consisting of a one-half-inch drill hole in the upper face of an irregular shaped stone. NoTE i7.-The station was marked by a copper tack in the top of a redwood stub, 3 inches square and 27:! feet long, placed in the ground with its top level with the surface, and by three other stubs, two in line with the station, the third at right angles to that line, and each 3 feet from the center. N oTE 18.-The station was marked by a cross on a lead plug in a stone buried from 2 to 4 feet below the surface of the ground. The reference marks were copper tacks in the tops of three stubs, each 6 feet from the center, two in line with it, and the third at right angles to that line. NoTE 19.-The station was marked by a large nail driven into the center of a piece of 3 by 4 inch scantling, 1 foot long, with its top about 2 feet belov. the surface of the ground. The reference marks consist of copper tacks driven in four stakes, which are each 6 feet from the center. Lines drawn diagonally between these tacks intersect at the center of the station at approximately right angles.

PRIMARIES AND SECONDARIES,

1906-7.

Sierra Morena (San Mateo County, Cal., G. D., i883; i907).-0n the range of mountains extending northwest and southeast along the San Francisco peninsula, about 50 meters from the county road following along the ridge from Kings Mountain House, which is about 12 miles by good road from Redwood City. Station is on land belonging to the Virginia Mill Company, about 27:! miles south from Kings Mountain House, and on the highest knoll in the vicinity, near where the road forks, one road going to the south, and the other circling the hill to the north and west: The top of the hill was covered with growth of trees 20 feet or more high, all of which were cut, except five large redwood trees standing about 75 feet southwest of the station. These were left standing as a landmark for the peak in all directions. The station was marked

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1910.

by a copper bolt in a stone 2 feet below the surface. Over this was built a hexagonal pier, 26 inches in diameter, 4 feet above the ground, in the top of which a copper bolt one-half inch in diameter marks the station. In 1907 an observatory 8 feet by 10 feet was left standing over the station. Loma Prieta (Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties, Cal., R. D. C., 1851-52; 1906).0n Mount Bache, the highest peak of the range of mountains forming the boundary line between the counties of Santa Clara and Santa Cruz. It is S. ::17 W., and distant l 5~ miles from San Jose, and N. 30 E., 14 miles from the village of Santa Cruz. Mount Bache (Loma Prieta) is the highest mountain within a circuit of 50 miles; the peak itself, being some 300 or 400 feet above the surrounding ridges, presents a bold and remarkable appearance, and can easily be distinguished at first glance from the valleys of San Jose and Santa Cruz. The mountain is steep and covered on all sides with chaparral. A good mountain road runs from Wrights station on the Southern Pacific Railroad 10 miles to the base of the last rise, thence by trail up north end of the ridge to the station. The home of Doctor Jones is about 1 mile northwest of the station. The subsurface mark is a brown stone with copper bolt in the center. A rock with a drill hole filled with lead, having a cross, was lowered 24Ys inches and placed above and three-eighths inch west of the copper bolt in brown stone. A concrete foundation 3~ feet square and 9 inches deep was laid around the rock and on it was built a hexagonal pier, 30 inches ill' diameter at the base, and 26 inches at the top. In 1906 this pier was enlarged about 3 inches at the base, extending up about 1 foot. An 8 by .%-inch copper bolt in top of the pier marks the station. Mount Toro (Monterey County, Cal., G.D., 1885; 1906).-0n the smooth, untimbered range of mountains bordering the Salinas Valley on the west; on the smooth, grassy hill about 500 yards south of A. 'B. Parson's house, and on his land. It is easily reached from Salinas City and is in full view of the town. The station is marked by a copper bolt set in a flat-topped rock 2 feet beneath the surface of the ground, and by a cross in copper bolt in top of pier built of concrete and topped with brick and cement. Two other piers are standing northwest of the station. Gavilan (Monterey County, Cal., R. D. C., 1851-52; 1906).-About l mile northwest of Fremont Peak, at the northwest foot of a small summit that rises 20 feet above it and cuts off the view to the southeast. About 4 miles to the southward of the Mis-. sion of San Juan, and on the crest of the mountain separating the Pajaro Valley from the broad valley of the Salinas. The crest, composed of a line of sharp, rocky peaks, 2 800 to 3 ooo feet above the sea, forms a conspicuous object and can be seen and recognized for many miles to the northward, and from Monterey to the southward. The station is on the western extremity of the crest, on a small platform of level land, just where the land commences to fall rapidly. Approach is from the Salinas plains by following the road to the Stokes ranch, thence along one of the ridges leading to the summit. Or from the north, by starting from San Juan and following up the canada (White's) for about 3~ miles, then turning to the right and ascending one of the spurs of the summit till the crest is reached, then along the south side of the crest to the station. The station is marked by a stone block 2~ feet in the ground, with a leaden bolt one-third inch in diameter, and cross lines. For reference three other blocks, similarly marked, are placed flush with the ground, two in line and the other at right

angles, each 6 feet from the station. Also three rocks projecting above the surface a:nd firmly bedded, each with a drill hole filled with lead and bearing as follows: S. 59 W., 8-45 feet; N. 16 40' E., 5.77 feet; S. 63 40' E., 3.17 feet. The surface mark is a stone with a drill hole in it. Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz County, Cal., R. D. C., 1851-1854; 1906).-0n the heights back of the village of Santa Cruz, on a round, smooth hill about 170 yards southwest of Gordon's limekiln, on ground claimed by Medear. The station bears N. 69 30' W., 2 miles from the embarcadero, and S. 74 W., one-half mile from the Mission Church. (Note 13, p. 297.) Pajaro Mouth 2 (Monterey County, Cal., C. H. S., 1906).-0n the southern end of the ridge of sand hills on the north side of the mouth of the Pajaro River. The station is marked by four drain tiles, 3 feet long and 4 inches in diameter. The center one is filled with concrete and has a small iron rod centered in it to mark the point. The other tiles were placed two in line with the station along the ridge, and the third at right angles, all 6 feet from the station. Point Pinos Latitude Station (Monterey County, Cal., G. D., 1851; 1906).-0n the northeasterly part of Point Pinos, 680 meters east of the light-house and 200 meters from the shore. The center of a rocky knoll, with pine tree standing on the western edge, bears N. 15 E. by compass, distant 153 feet from the center of the station, and is in range with and south of another rocky knoll and a large broken rock on the beach, the first large rock east of Luces Point triangulation station. From the center of the station another rocky knoll bears N. 73 W. by compass, distant 104 feet. This knoll is in the direction of and in range with the whistling buoy off Point Pinos and White Rock stations. There are three pine trees northwest of the knoll and one south of it within a short distance. The station was marked by a stone'block, the top of which was even with the. surface and had in it a drill hole filled with lead. West of the station 6.5 feet, east 6 feet, and south 8 feet are bottles buried with necks even with the ground. Eighteen feet southwest and 18 feet southeast are stones with holes drilled in top. The center stone and each of these reference marks were covered with a pile of stones; 18.8 feet northeast was a hole drilled in a large rock. A copper nail in a double pine tree was 75.7 feet S. 55 W. of the station. Santa Cruz Magnetic Station (Santa Cruz County, Cal., C. H. S., 1906-7).-0n Point Santa Cruz, in the light-house grounds, between the old light-house foundation and the present light-house, and 84.9 meters from the latter. The station is marked by a block of marble 6 inches square, with the letters U. S. C. & G. S. cut in its top surface. Mount Tamalpais (M~rin County, Cal., G. D., 1859-60; 1909).-0n a bold ridge running east and west, about 10 miles north of the Golden Gate, on the top of the western and hi~hest of three peaks. The center of the station was marked by a stone bottle set in concrete, with the neck 20 inches below the surface of the ground. Over this was built a stone and concrete pier, about 36 inches in diameter at the base and 26 inches at the surface. Here there was placed an irregular-shaped stone, the top even with the ground, with a copper bolt to mark the center of the station. Upon this was built a hexagonal pier with. the same diameter to a height of 24 inches from the ground, where a stone bottle was placed and the pier continued 29 inches higher. In the top was put a

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1910.

two-third-inch copper bolt, with a hole marking the center of the station. The reference marks were three stones, with drill hole in the top, on the surface of the ground, each 6 feet from the center; one along the ridge to the east, one to the south, an<l the other to the west. In a rock 18 feet 9 ;1 inches distant from the center was a mass of lead. There were three other concrete piers, one bearing N. 76 47' W. (true), distant 18.36 feet; one N. 79 48' W. (true), distant 23.20 feet; and one N. 5 54' E. (true), distant 41.12 feet from the center. Red Hill (Alameda County, Cal., R. D. C., 1851; 1907).-About 3 miles a little south of east of the town of Alvarado, on what are known as the Coyote or Red Hills, a range 3;1 miles long, remarkable and readily distinguished by their isolated position, being nearly surrounded by marsh and separated from the main Contra Costa range by 7 or 8 miles of level land. The station is not on the highest part of the hill, but on a spur or shoulder running off to the southwest from the high rocky peak at the north end of the range and is about 500 meters from it. The station is on the old Briggs ranch, and is best reached from Alvarado, by way of the Brown. and Sweazey dairy in the hills and up the swale to the northwest of the cow barn to the saddle, from which the station can be seen about 300 meters to the northwest. The station was marked as follows: A surface stone with lead in the drill hole to mark the station was put in place, top level with the surface. Concrete was then filled in a hole around the stone (but not touching it) 5 feet square and 10 inches deep. 'fhe stone was then covered with a wooden box and over the station center was built a cement pier 2 1 inches square by 45 inches high; embedded in the top of the pier was a stone block 6 by 8 by 15 inches, top level with the top of the pier and with hole filled with lead to mark the station. The top of the pier bears the letters C. & G. S., 1907. Three cement blocks 5 bys by 6 inches on which to mount the theodolite were placed on the pier. There are two reference marks 6 feet from the center and' flush with the ground. They are stones with drill holes. Two rocks projecting above the surface were marked by drill holes filled with lead; one is in azimuth 38 1 distant 7.9 feet; the other 71 30', distant 7.8 feet. Azimuth to a tatl redwood tree on San Jose plain is 30, to Guano Island, called "Little Coyot~," 98 45 1, to Union Island 232. An observatory 8 by 10 feet was left standing in 1907. Rocky Mound (Contra Costa and Alameda counties, Cal., R. D. C., 1851-1854; 1906).About 6 miles northward from Oakland, a few degrees west of the high peak of the Contra Costa ridge. directly north of the principal street of Oakland. The hill slopes slightly to the westward and on the summit are a few dark clumps of small laurel trees and a quantity of loose rock. About I ,ooo meters northwest of Rocky Mound is another and lower hill, the only summit in the vicinity which at all resembles the hill on which the station is located. The station is not on the highest part of the hill but on the westward slope, 59.3 feet, S. 86 W. from the top of the highest rock on the hill and almost exactly in line from the rock to Table Mountain Peak. The station was m~rked by a lead plug in a stone block buried r X feet below the surface of the ground and resting on solid rock. Two holes were drilled in the rocks and filled with lead, as follows: 13.7 feet from the station, N. 86 30 1 W., and 15.3 feet, N. 7 45' W. Sonoma Mountain (Sonoma County, Cal., R. D. C., 1851-1854; 1907).-Upon a prominent hill about 6 miles due north from the town of Petaluma, on a knoll immediately south of Trundle's house. The station was marked by a stone 6 inches long,

APPENDIX 5. TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA, PART II.

301

buried 1 foot 4 inches below the smiace, in the top of which was a leaden plug with a small hole in the center. Over this earth was filled in and another stone, I.I feet long, was placed just below the surface and with lead plug and cross in top. Four other similar stones were placed to the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest, and exactly 6 feet from the center, each marked by a plug and cross. The distances between the stones were 8.84 feet, 8.25 feet, 8.95 feet, and 7.85 feet, beginning with the distance from the northwest to the northeast stone. In 1859 the southeast stone was found to be only 5 feet 11 inches from the center; the southwest stone was not found. Point Reyes /-Jill (Marin County, Cal., G. A. F., 1855; 1906).-0n the summit of the highest hill to the northward of the road leading from the head of Tamales Bay to the Point Reyes ranch and easily distinguished after passing about r mile over that road. This hill from its height and steepness is inaccessible to loaded vehicles, but may be conveniently ascended with pack animals on several of the ridges leading from the Point Reyes road on the southwest side. Between this hill and a hill of nearly the same height toward Bolinas is a ridge covered with pines. The station was marked by a flat stone 15 inches below the ground, the top of which was marked by a five-eighth-inch drill hole and the letters U. S. C. S. Three stones similarly marked were placed each 6 feet from the center, one a little to the eastward of the line to the east peak of Table Mountain, another exactly in line with this to the northwest, and the third toward the east point of Point Reyes.

ELEVATIONS.

In order to have for each point the final United States Standard Datum position and the final elevation published together, it has been necessary to repeat in this publication the elevations of a number of points, published in "The Transcontinental Triangulation'' and in ''Triangulation in California, Part I.'' For the same reason the positions are reproduced here, from "Triangulation in California, Part I," of the following stations: Mount Lassie, King Peak, Mad River, and Bear Ridge. The plane of reference is mean sea level. The elevations are divided into three classes, viz: (I) Those determined by spirit leveling in which the probable error varies from 0.03 meter to 0.25 meter; (2) those determined by reciprocal zenith distance measures, in which the probable error varies from  0.3 meter to  1.5 meters; (3) those determined by nonreciprocal zenith distance measures, in which the probable error may be as much, in some cases, as  10 meters.

THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FLEXURE OF PENDULUM SUPPORTS \\TITH THE INTERFEROMETER.*
By

w.

H. BURGER,

Assistant, Coast and Gaodet;c Survey.

The horizontal component of the force acting on the knife-edge through the swinging pendulum causes the support to move in unison with the pendulum, and thereby affects the period of the oscillation. This movement is the so-called flexure of the pendulum support. This movement or displacement of the pendulum support is an exceedingly minute quantity, the measurement of which has been the subject of much investigation. Its effect upon the period of the p~ndulum has been more or less satisfactorily determined by various methods, such as by using an auxiliary pendulum which is set in motion by the oscillation of the support under the influence of the standard pendulum; by Hardy's Noddy, and by the static method used in recent years by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In the static method used for measuring the flexure of the support a horizontal pull of r .5 kilograms was applied at the height of the knife-edge, and the resulting displacement was measured by means of a scale and microscope. In none of these methods was the measurement made of the actual displacement of the pendulum support due to the swinging pendulum. The correction for flexure was obtained through methods involving doubtful assumptions, as, for example, in the case of the static method heretofore used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, it was assumed that the flexure correction was always proportional to the measured displacement, whereas this is not true when the 1 .5 kilogram pull applied is sufficient to force the support beyond its limit of elasticity. In general the apparatus used in the other methods is inferior to the apparatus used in the interferometer method, for with none of them can the measurements be made with such accuracy as with the interferometer. To avoid the inaccuracies of the static method, Mr. John F. Hayford, Inspector of Geodetic Work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, proposed the plan of using the interferometer to measure the absolute displacement of the support due to the oscillating

* After the investigations were made and the interferometer actually usep. at many gravity stations in the measurement of the flexure of the pendulum support, it was learned that practically the same method had already been used by another investigator. (See "Eine optisehe Methods zur direkten Messung des Mitschwingens bei Pendelbeebachtungen" von K. R. Koch, Leipzig, 1905. As far as can be learned, however, no observer or investigator has used the interferometer method in determining the flexure of the pendulum support at field stations, where observations must be made under widely different conditions and where speed in observing and simplicity of apparatus are important factors.

pendulum and to determine the effect of the displacement upon the period of the pendulum. To the writer was assigned the investigation and experimental work and the elaboration of plans for the use of the interferometer. In this, along both the theoretical and practical lines, much assistance was received from Mr. Hayford and from Mr. E. G. Fischer, Chief of the Instrument Division, and to p them is largely due the success of the work. The preliminary investigation was made in the fall of 1907 and was only carried far enough to prove that the proposed plan was feasible . Work was then suspended till the fall of 1908, when the final investigations and experiments L were taken up. In the interval an interferomeM ter to suit the requirements of the work was de* signed and constructed.
DESCRIPTION pF THE INTERFEROMETER.

t

The principle of the interferometer is graphically shown in fig. I. The beam from the source of light,* with its rays made practically parallel by a lens L, strikes the rear or second surface of the plate S, and separates, part of it being reflected to the plane mirror P, returning exactly on its path through S and then through C to T, where it is examined by a telescope. The other part of the ray goes through the glass plate S, passes through the 톑lass plate C, and is reflected by the plane mirror M, returns on its path through C to the plate S, where it is reflected so as to unite with the first ray under conditions which produce interference. The resulting phenomenon is observed as a series of bands in the form of a grating, the dark band being produced when the two wave trains differ in phase by one-half wave length and the light bands when they meet in the same phase. The plane parallel glass C is introduced to compensate for the extra thickness of glass which the first portion of the ray has traversed in passing through the plate S. Without it the two paths would not be optically identical, because the first would contain more glass than the second. Some light is reflected from the front surface of the plate S, but its effect is rendered Fringes and scale. insignificant if the coating of silver covering the rear surface of that plate is of such thickness that nearly equal portions of incident light are reflected and transmitted.

FLEXURE OF PENDULUM SUPPORTS.

The plane-parallel plates S and C are worked originally in a single piece, which is afterwards cut in two. The two pieces are placed parallel to each other, thus insuring exact equality in the two optical paths SP and SM. The interlerometer used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in measuring the flexure of pendulum supports is a modified form of the interlerometer described in "Light Waves and their Uses," by A. A. Michelson (pp. 40--41). A detailed description will not be given here, only the modifications and changes being noted. The instrument was designed by Mr. E. G. Fischer, Chief of the Instrument Division,.and two instruments were constructed in the shops of the Survey under his direction. The optical parts were furnished by Dr. J. A. Brashear, of Pittsburg, Pa. In figs. 2 and 3 are shown the pendulum receiver and intetierometer with accessories used in observing. The separator plate and the compensator plate are not mounted in separate frames as in the form of interferometer described by Michelson, but are held together in the same metal frame (k, fig. 2), with the silvered surlace of the separator plate within, and separated from the inner surface of the compensator plate by a narrow border of tin foil. Great care is taken in the preparation and mounting of this tin foil border in order to make sure the two plates are truly parallel. It also serves to seal the space between the two plates and thus furnish protection from moisture, gases, or other agents which might injure the delicate silvering of the separator plate. The frame and plates are made considerably longer than in the Michelson form, for, both plates being in the same frame, the frame must be deeper, and as the plates are at an angle of 45 degrees to the line of sight they must be made longer in order not to lessen the area of the fringe field as viewed in the telescope. Instead of the plane mirrors being silvered on their front faces they are silvered on their back surlaces and the silvering is protected by a coating of varnish. The frame holding the separator and compensator plates is capable of being rotated on its vertical axis in such a manner that the apparatus can be used as a right or left handed instrument. The instrument is furnished with abutting stops for placing the frame quickly in either position. The carriage of the fixed mirror (M, figs. 1 and 2), which moves along the ways  {c, fig. 3) and by means of which the two paths are made equal, remains practically unchanged, although special devices have been added for insuring free but accuratt motion on the long screw controlling its motion. The other fixed mirror (P, figs. 1 and 2) is separated entirely from the metal base of the interferometer and is mounted on an arm (c, fig. 2) which is fastened by dowel pins and thumbscrew (a, b, fig. 2) to the pendulum receiver. The top of the receiver is removed before this arm can be attached. The ann when in place supports the mirror in a position directly in"front of the window in the receiver through which coincidences or slit images are observed and at the height of the knife-edge. The 3 foot-screws of the intetierometer rest on a base plate (Q, fig. 2) which is fastened to the independent support. A small circular level (p, fig. 2) is attached to the interferometer for quick adjustment.

FLEXURE OF PENDULUM SUPPORTS.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,
METHOD OF OBSERVING.

1910.

In observing flexure by means of the interferometer method, there is presented the problem of finding the shift, or displacement, of the fringes, due to the oscillation of the pendulum support, in terms of the width of one fringe. As one mirror is attached to the pendulum receiver and the remainder of the interferometer is mounted on a support entirely independent of the. pendulum receiver, it is easily seen that any movement in the pendulum case will cause a shift or displacement of the fringes in the interferometer. Owing to the two parts of fhe interferometer being mounted on separate and independent supports, and the consequent instability in relative position of its parts, vibrations from sources other than the oscillating pendulum cause shifting of fringes, but_ these are erratic and are seldom mistaken for the shift due to the pendulum. Since the pendulum makes one complete swing in 0.5 second, the shift of fringes will occur as a half-second shift across the field. It is the magnitude of this half-second movement which it is desired to measure. This movement is a measure of the amount of flexure in the pendulum case caused by the oscillating pendulum. To find the amount of the shift, in terms of the width of a fringe, two methods can be used: 1. By observing the fraction of the fringe width over which any fringe band moves, using as a pointing line any line of the scale in the eyepiece of the observing telescope, as seen projected upon the fringe field. This is the direct method. 2. By observing the width of a fringe in terms of the divisions of the scale in the. telescope, and then observing the amount of the shift or displacement of the fringe band in terms of the scale divisions. The second quantity divided by the first will give the shift of the fringes in terms of the width of a fringe. This is the indirect method. In outlining a plan of observing, the question arose as to whether the direct or the indirect method of observing should be used. After a thorough analysis and test of both methods, it was decided to use the indirect method. The direct method while very simple, may lead to large errors in the results, for any error in estimation made in the first few observations is likely to continue thoughout a series of measurements, as the observer is apt to become prejudiced in his estimation and duplicate the readings which may be in error. There is little chance of introducing varying conditions to eliminate this. Also, the smallest reading which the observer can ordinarily estimate easily while the fringes are in motion is about one-tenth of a fringe. Even this is often difficult or impossible. An error of one-tenth of a fringe width (reduced to standard arc) in the measure of the flexure causes an error of 17 in the seventh place of period, which is an error too large to be allowed. The second, or indirect method, is almost entirely free from this possibility of error. Such a variety. of conditions can be introduced as will make almost every individual measure an independent one. There is little chance of prejudice affecting the observations, unless it be in the 5 measures of any one set, and this prejudice will be counteracted by the introduction of varying widths of fringes and of varying amplitudes of swings of the pendulum. Tlie following is a specimen of record and computation in the measurement of flexure as used in the field (station, Kerrville, Tex.; date, January 24, 1910):

PROGRAMME OF OBSERVING.

The programme of observing flexure, by means of the indirect method of using the interferometer, is as follows: Having adjusted the interferometer in position, and obtained fringes of maximum brightness, the fringe-width is made rather broad, say, 3 to 4 scale divisions, the adjustment for fringe-width being made with the fine adjusting screws (d, g, j, fig. 2) attached to the mounting of each mirror. The width of fringe depends upon the angle at which the two rays meet. This angle is changed by changing the position of t:he reflecting mirrors. The arc of oscillation of the pendulum is made rather large, say, from 6 to 9 millimeters for the semiarc. The reason for making both fringe-width and arc large will be explained further on. The semiarcs are read and recorded as above. The reading scale in the eye end of the observing telescope is set so that it is approximately at right angles to the fringe bands. (See p. 434.) The shift or displacement of the fringes will thus be in the direction of the length of the scale.

440

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1910.

The fringe motion is watched for a short period to recognize the half-second shift of the fringes, due to the half-second beat of the pendulum and 'to accustom the eye to the wavering field. Similarly placed points or lines on any two adjacent black (or yellow) bands are selected for use in measuring the fringe width. The writer's experience has shown the best part of the bands to be the line or edge of the black band, for the observer can easily select this line or edge and keep it in sight. Before reading, care should be taken that the observer does not touch the flash apparatus or its support, for any motion of it will cause an apparent motion of the fringes and thus not only make observing more difficult, but cause errors in the readings. Having selected the two fringe lines, their positions are read on the scale at the instant they reach the one limit of their motion as they shift under the action of the oscillating pendulum. The difference between the scale readings of the two lines will give the fringe-width in scale divisions. With practice the positions of both of these lines can be read at the same time, provided the fringe-width is not too great. In case the observer has difficulty in reading the scale for both lines at the same instant as they reach the extreme limit of their shift, a good plan is to read for one line, and then when the next half-se.cond shift in the same direction comes read for the second line. (See A and B, column 2, p. 439.) The first line is read again, and if this reading is very close to the first reading the first and second readings are recorded as being the scale divisions r,eached by the two lines. The third reading is only a check upon the stability in position of the various parts of the interferometer for the period between the readings. It should be noted that the divisions of the scale are in sets of five, but without any figures. In reading, it is convenient to consider any fifth, or long line, as the zero line. This will usually make all readings less than ro. Immediately after the above readings have been made the reading should be made of the positions reached by one of the chosen fringe lines, in the two extreme positions of its shift under the action of the swinging pendulum. (See A and A, column 3, p. 439.). Their difference will give the amount of shift or displacement of the fringe in terms of the scale divisions. These two differences are the quantities sought and constitute one measure. Four others, or five measures in all, are made as quickly as 'possible, then the width of fringe is made narrow (about 2 divisions of scale), and five more measures are made and the semiarcs read. Each five measures constitute a set, and the mean of a set is used in computing one value for the flexure of the support. When the fringe-width 톓s small, any error in estimating tenths of scale divisions causes large errors in the flexure value, for, assuming the shift to be only two-tenths of a scale division, an error of one-tenth in estimation will cause the resulting value of flexure to be in error by 50 per cent. When the fringe-width is large, an error of one-tenth of a scale division will cause a proportionally smaller error. For this reason it was suggested to begin with a" rather broad" fringe-width. However, if the fringes are made too broad, it is difficult to observe, for their shading from dark to bright bands is so gradual that no definite points can be chosen for observing. When the observer reaches the set where the fringe-width is small, he is better fitted to read them more accurately. Having obtained two sets as described, two more sets are taken, beginning with a small arc (preferably about 5 mm. total arc) and small fringe-width, and changing the fringe-width back to the large width between the third and fourth sets. The fringe-width, when beginning the third set, may be left as it was at the end of the second set, if desired.

APPENDIX 6.

FLEXURE OF PENDULUM SUPPORTS.

The arcs are read at the beginning of the first and third sets, and at the ends of the second and fourth sets. An interpolation is made between the readings of the first and second sets, and between the third and fourth sets, in order to find the mean total arc for each set. The interpolation is made under the assumption that the observations are made with uniform speed and that the.decrease in arc is proportional to the elapsed time. In the reduction of observations. it is necessary to reduce the flexure value for each set to what it would have been had the standard arc been used in each case. With a change of arc there is a proportional change in the horizontal force applied to the knife edge, and therefore a proportional change in the flexure of the support. In the actual observations it is not advisable to use an arc of only one magnitude, hence when measures are made with various arcs they must all be reduced to the same standard arc. An arc of 5.0 millimeters was chosen as a standard when the coefficient of flexure was determined, and consequently all measures in the field should be reduced to that standard. In case the four sets do not give the required accuracy, additional sets with other arcs and fringe-widths should be obtained. Unless the conditions are very poor, there is no difficulty in obtaining the desired accuracy with four sets, the accuracy required being such that the resulting value obtained should not be in error by more than the onetwentieth of one fringe width. Throughout nearly twenty months of work by the writer, in no case was it found necessary to make more than the four sets, providing observing was possible at all. The observer is not for~ed to follow exactly the method of observing outlined above. It is the result of observations for a considerable period, and is one which combines in a minimum of operations nearly a maximum of conditions. Whatever system is employed, the endeavor should be made to introduce many conditions as to widths of fringes and amplitude of' arcs. In making the different measures of any set it is well to use fringes in different parts of the fringe field. By doing so different readings of the scale are obtained and advantage is taken of the slight variation which may exist in the several fringe-widths of a fringe field. The time necessary in making a complete measurement of the flexure value, such as is given above, will vary for different observers, different conditions of mounting the pendulum case and interferometer, and the influence of vibrations from causes outside the interferometer and pendulum case. The observer should accustom himself to make the readings of the fringe-width and fringe movement, in terms of the scale divisions, as rapidly as possible, the one to follow the other with little loss of time. If mi.tch time elaspes the fringe-width may change and the ratio of the fringe-width to the fringe motion will not indicate the true flexure existing in the support. During the observations the observer and the recorder, if there is one, should remain as quiet as possible in order not to cause any erratic movements of the fringes. Should there be any marked erratic vibrations the observer must keep close watch and make the observations in the lulls which occur. These lulls may occur for only a second or two, and therefore the observer must accustom himself to read at a glance and not to hesitate much. It is better to have an error of a tenth of a division than to lose readings, providing the error is of the accidental class. If the fringe field is fairly stable, the observations can be made with great ease and rapidity, and it is not difficult to make the observations almost as fast as one can record.

Sometimes the wind pressure on the buildings, traffic in near-by streets, or people walking in the building may cause such intense vibrations that the half-second oscillation can not be detected, and, indeed, they may sometimes be so strong as to cause the fringes to disappear entirely or cause them to shift so rapidly that no observations are possible. In order to fully comprehend the foregoing and to gain some idea of the sensitiveness of the instrument and the minuteness of the quantity to be measured, it is noted that the flexure when using a good mounting of the pendulum support varies from about 0.06 too. IO fringe, corresponding to an actual displacement of the pendulum support of from 0.017 to 0.029 microns. If it is not possible to remedy the conditions by changes in the independent support it will be necessary to delay observations to a time when the wind dies down, when traffic in the street is at a minimum, or when people are quiet or out of the building. Much annoyance can be saved if the alcohol flame is protected from drafts, for when it flares very much the fringe field may be blurred too much for observing. In changing the fringe-width between sets only the very slightest touch should be given to the adjusting screws, in order not to cause the fringes to disappear entirely, and thus cause delay in finding them again. In using the flash apparatus in pendulum observations it is placed about 2 meters from the receiver. In using the telescope of the flash apparatus for flexure measurements it may be necessary to increase the distance from the receiver in order to focus accurately upon the fringe field, for in viewing the slit image the telescope is focused upon an object which is nearly twice as distant as is the fringe field. Also, when observing coincidence of images the scale in the eye end of tne telescope is thrown out of focus in order not to interfere with distinct vision of the slit images. When observing flexure this scale is made clear and distinct by means of the sliding eyepiece tube of the telescope. It will be found necessary to lower the telescope of the flash apparatus for flexure observing. A higher mounting of the telescope in necessary in pendulum work than is necessary in interferometer work, for in observing coincidence the telescope is pointed at the image of the slit, the slit itself being below the telescope and in the face of the box of the flash apparatus, while in observing the shift of fringe the telescope is pointed horizontally at the compensator and separator glasses, at which point the fringe field is formed. As the fringes may appear at any angle with the vertical through the instrument, the scale in the eye end of the observing telescope is mounted so that it can easily and quickly be rotated about the optical axis of the telescope. To make this rotation, it is only necessary to turn, by means of a projecting pin, the movable collar which is located between the eye piece and the focusing screw of the telescope.
/

ADJUSTMENT OF FRINGES.

When hunting for fringes-that is, when manipulating the fine adjustment screws so that fringes will be formed in the interferometer-it may happel!_ that a very fine set of fringes will make its appearance. This is a secondary set of fringes, probably caused by the very thin film of air between the separator and the compensator glasses. These secondary fringes will be vel,"y straight unless distortion or optical defect exists in the two plates.

APPENDIX 6.

FLEXURE OF PENDULUM SUPPORTS.

443

The fringes which are sought will seldom be straight on first appearance, but will be found in the form of parts of concentric rings and may occur with almost any width and of varying intensity. In adjusting for observation the fringes should be made straight and have the maximum brightness. This adjustment is made by turning the long screw by means of the small wheel with handle and milled edge which is placed at the opposite end of the interferometer from the separator and compensator plates (D, Fig. 3). The delicate motion necessary to complete this adjustment should not be made with the handle, but by using the rim of the milled wheel, and after each fraction of a tum the hand should be taken from the wheel to permit the instrument to come to rest. The wheel should be turned while close watch is kept of the movement of the fringes and it should be turned so that the shift of fringes is in the direction in which lies the center of the series of concentric fringe bands. As the wheel is turned in this direction the fringes become straight, and, finally, if the motion is continued, the curvature of the fringes will be in the opposite direction, showing that the desired position of straight fringes has been passed. When this occurs the motion should be reversed until the desired position is obtained and the fringes are straight. In seeking this position it will be noted that the fringes alternately become brighter and dimmer as the wheel is turned. The position of maximum brightness occurs when the paths of the two rays providing interference are equal. This is also the position for straight fringes. This position should always be sought, for observations are more easily made with bright and straight than with dim and curved fringes.
TEMPERATURE CONTROL.

In the determination of the intensity of the force of gravity it is very desirable and essential that the observer select a location having a small range of temperature; therefore, in general, the temperature control of the various parts of the interferometer and support will be very good and few stresses, etc., will be set up which might cause undue shift of fringes. However, the wood or other material from which the interferometer independent stand is to be constructed should be placed inside the building some time before it will be needed, in order that it may attain the approximate temperature of the pendulum room. Wood which is moist should be avoided. Any changes in the independent stand due to absorption or evaporation of moisture will cause a slow but constant shift of the fringes, and generally in one direction. This makes observing very difficult, and without using special caution may cause errors in the results.
SODIUM LIGHT, WAVE LENGTH, ETC.

In the use of the interferometer it is essential that a monochromatic light be used, for it is necessary to know the wave length. In selecting a monochromatic light to use with the interferometer the sodium light was chosen, for it could very easily be obtained by the use of sodium chloride and an alcohol flame. If the fringes shift or are displaced by one fringe-width due to the motion of the pendulum, it is easily seen that the pendulum case has moved through a distance equal to one-half the wave length of the light used, for a change of distance between the thinly silvered plate and the mirror on the pendulum case causes a change in the'total path of the ray to and from that mirror by double the amount, so that if the length of

444

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1910.

the wave of light used is known we have a means of computing the movement of the case. The wave length oi the sodium light is practically 0.58 micron, and therefore a shift or displacement of the fringes by an amount equal to one fringe-width means a displacement of the pendulum case of 0.29 micron. There is furnished with each interferometer an alcohol lamp and stand with lens and glass tube, asbestos fiber (L, z, w, x, Fig. 2), and sodium. chloride to produce the sodium flame, for the value of the flexure coefficient is based upon the value of the wave length of sodium light.
INDEPENDENT SUPPORT FOR THE INTERFEROMETER.

By means of the rotating frame holding the half-silvered mirror or separator and the compensator glass the interferometer can be used as a right or left handed instrument; that is, it can be used with flame to the right or the left of the interferometer. This permits of a wide range in form of support for the interferometer, which is of great importance in fieldwork, for the pendulum receiver is mounted in various places, and were the interferometer not capable of being used in both positions its mounting would often be attended with great difficulty. As the conditions existing at each gravity station may be such as to demand a special form of interferometer support, no description can be given for a form which will suit every station. In general, however, a modification of one of the typical forms describ.ed below can be used. Fig.4 Type I .-Best fitted for flexure measures P  Pandulum cos when the pendulum pier is rather high, when r  Puition of 9/0,1 pfol, on~ '"'""Ori ol utt톜l톖"om톞., S  P01llion of 1odiunt """ the pier is at some distance from the walls of the room, and when the pier is so constructed that vibrations are not communicated to the ground close to the pier. This form of support consist~, essentially, of three legs in the form of a tripod, with a head large enqugh to hold the interferometer. The legs can be sunk into the ground near the pier or else fastened by plaster of Paris to the floor in front of the pier. In all forms avoid resting the stand on wooden flooring, if the observer is compelled to work on this same floor_ing. Type 2.-To be used when the pendulum receiver rests upon a concrete floor or low. pier and conditions are such that the vibrations may be communicated from the pendulum support to the independent support of the interferometer. This form (see fig. 4) consists of a beam supported by uprights close to the manometer window and parallel to the plane of oscillation of the pendulum. A second beam, at right angles to this, has one end supported by an upright and the other end resting on the first beam. This second beam is the one upon which the interferometer is mounted.. The interferometer should be placed far enough from the receiver so that the distance from the center of the separator and comparator frame to the mirror on the receiver will fall within the variable distance between the movable mirror and the center of the separator and compensator frame. If needed to make the stand more rigid, braces may be nailed to

APPENDIX 6.

FLEXURE OF PENDULUM SUPPORTS.

the beam and upright at each point of support. It will often be found advisable to weight the stand with bricks, pails of sand, etc., to increase its stability. Care must be taken that the supports rest far enough away from the receiver so that there is no chance of vibration being communicated to it by the pendulum. In case the receiver is near to a wall the beam may be attached to- the wall, but wind pressure against the side of the building may be great enough to make observing difficult when this is done, for the wind pressure may make the wall vibrate, but not the floor. This form of stand may be modified as shown in fig. 5. Other conditions being equal, 톒owever, that type of stand should be used which will permit the observer to have room to start the pendulum swinging and to read the arc. Whatever type of stand is constructed the top of the support at the position where the interferometer is to be mounted should be about 4}{ inches below the top of the rec~iver when the cover is off and so placed that, when the interferometer is resting upon it, the distance from the mirror on the receiver to the center of the frame holding the thinly silvered mirror and the compens sator fall within the variable distance between the movable mirror and the center of that frame.
MOUNTING AND ADJUSTMENT OF THE INTERFEROMETER.

The base plate of the interferometer can be affixed to the support by plaster of Paris, fi9S beeswax, or screws, or it may simply rest on the support. Plaster of Paris should not be used if the base plate is to be fastened to wood, for moisture should be avoided. By means of the leveling screws the instrument is adjusted to the right height, which can be quickly determined by sighting along the top of the separator frame and the top of the mirror on the receiver; these should be at the same height. The center of the separator frame should be directly in front of the center of the mirror on the receiver and the long axis of the interferometer approximately parallel to the face of the mirror on the receiver. By means of the long screw the movable mirror should be placed the same distance from the center of the separator frame as is the mirror on the receiver, in order to make the two paths from the seP,arator to the two reflecting mirrors equal, a condition essential in using the interferometer. This is easily done by placing one leg of a pair of dividers in the small hole (A, fig. 3) on top of the frame and the other leg alternately to the two small mirrors whose distances are to be made equal. The sodium flame and the lens should be adjusted for elevation and direction so that, when looking through the thinly silvered glass into the mirror on the receiver, the field is a uniform sodium flame color, or at least that part of it bounded by the circular image of the lens. Two distinct images and one faint image of this lens will be seen. By shifting the interferometer and its base and by using the leveling screws the two brighter images should be made to overlap approximately; then the leveling screws should be clamped. In the field there will be found images of the small ink spot which is on the center of the face of the thinly silvered mirror. The two images of this spot

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1910.

should be used in the final adjustment of the coincidence of the images, which adjustment should be made by means of the fine motion screws controlling the motion of the two reflecting mirrors. When the two images are made to coincide. exactly, it is well to check the distance of the two mirrors from the center of the separator glass, making corrections if necessary. Then comes the problem of causing the fringes to appear in the field, and this requires care and patience. If the above adjustments have been made accurately, the fringes may quickly be found. ~o set rules can be given for the production of the fringe field, as it is largely a matter of experiment in each individual case. With the two images overlapping, as described above, by using first one and then the other of the two fine adjustment screws on the interferometer mirror the spots are made to separate slightly in various directions from the coincident position. I,f great difficulty is had in finding the fringes, the cause may be in the lack of stability in position of the support or in the incorrect adjustment of the movable mirror. The stability of the support can often be tested by a slight tapping with the finger. If satisfactory, it should show no vibration. The adjustment of the movable mirror may be changed a trifle, but not more than a small fraction of a turn. When the fringes have been found, they should be made bright and straight and of the desired width as described on pages 439 and 443; the telescope and scale should be adjusted as described on page 442, the pendulum set to swinging, and observations made in accordance with the plan previously outlined. The lid should be on and close up to the arm of the receiver mirror, as this was the position when the flexure coefficient was determined, and it is desirable that observation for flexure be made in the field under the same conditions as when the coefficient was determined. It is to be noted that the measurements of flexure arc made with case not exhausted, while pendulum observations are made with receiver exhausted to 60 mm. pressure. However, it is believed that there is no error introduced 'into the results, for it is difficult to see how flexure could be changed by exhausting the case.
DETERMINATION OF
THI~

COEFFICIENT OF FI,EXVRE.

The method used to determine the coefficient for flexure correction to the pendulum period was the method first used by Airy and employed since by most observers. In determining the coefficient for flexure of the supports in terms of the period of the pendulum by this method, simultaneous swings of two different pendulums were observed, the periods of each being determined by using the same two chronometers to operate both flash apparatus. The pendulums were swung on separate piers, and under nearly identical conditions except for flexure. One was kept swinging as a standard with no change of conditions, while the other was swung under constant conditions except for varying flexibility of the support, suitable conditions having been determined by. a preliminary investigation with the interferometer. The work was divided into" runs," each run being independent as far as observations were concerned. The pendulums were swung in nominally eight-hour periods, with no renewal of pendulums, each run with not less than six swings and each beginning and ending with a time set. When all corrections had been applied to the period of the standard pendulum, the flexure being constant throughout the run, the variation from the mean period of the run shown by the individual swings was assumed to be due to the variation in rate of the chronometer

APPENDIX 6.

FLEXURE OF PENDULUM SUPPORTS.

447

for the periods covered by the individual swings and to whatever small observational errors might be present. As the period of the other pendulum was approximately the period of the standard pendulum; it was assumed that its individual periods had the same corrections due to rate as the corresponding period of the standard pendulum. When these corrections had been applied to the swings of the pendulum having varying flexures, it was found that the periods obtained for the various swings differed. It was assumed that this variation was caused by the variation in flexure conditions and that the change. in period was proportional to the displacement of the support and therefore proportional to the flexure as expressed in terms of the fringe width. (See table of results below.) In determining the coefficient for flexure correction the following programme of observation was used, observations being made in manner described: Run A .-Pendulum At, under standard conditions, and Bt, under standard conditions except with changes in flexure conditions, as follows: Swings 1 and 2, small fli;xure; 3 and 4, large flexure;. 5 and 6, medium flexure. Run B.-Same as Run A, except Bt under standard conditions and At under varying changes of flexure. Run C.-Like Run A, with A5 in place of At and B 5 in place of Bt. Endeavor was made to vary flexure conditions enough to obtain many points at various places on the flexure curve.

Results weighted according to the differences in flexure give톐or a final mean F= 1.73. The value 0.01 F= 1.73 for correction to period in seventh place was adopted as the flexure coefficient for the two sets of pendulums. As the range of period is small, it is sufficiently accurate to consider this coefficient a constant quantity and the correction proportional to the flexure of the support as obtained in fringes.

INTERFEROMETER AS A FIELD INSTRUMENT.

Although the interferometer was used in the measurement of the flexure of pendulum supports for about twenty months under the varying conditions found in field work, there were exceedingly few cases where measures could not be taken on account of excessive erratic vibrations. Traffic on the streets and wind pressure on the. buildings were the principal agents causing a delay. Observing for flexure was mostly done at night, immediately after the close of the pendulum observations. Usually there was little, if any, traffic to hinder work at that time, and the fringes were generally stable enough for the observations to be made without difficulty.
COMPARISON OF THE STA'l'IC WI'l'H THE INTERFEROMETER METHOD.

In regard to the relative value of the interferometer method as compared with the static method of determining flexure, which had been previously employed 톓n gravity work by the .Survey, it is believed the former has enough advantage over the latter to warrant its continued use. The following statements are based mostly on a comparative test of the two methods made at Washington and at various stations;in the field. While the static method is a little more simple, there is but little gain in time over the interferometer method. The interferometer can always be used under conditions where the static method can be used, except in cases of extreme flexibility of support; but this condition is seldom met in actual gravity work. The static method, due to the limit of power of the microscope, may easily give results which may be in error by as much as 1 micron (if not more), corresponding to an error of 6.5 in the seventh place of period. The interferometer method gives results far more accurate, the results, it is believed, rarely being in error by more than 2 in the seventh place of period. The use of the dynamic method is preferred to the static method, as the theory connecting the static measurements and the actual dynamic conditions under which gravity observations are made is not considered satisfactory. Prejudice in observing is practically eliminated by the interferometer method, for by changing arc and fringe-width many conditions are introduced, and the method of observing in terms of scale divisions and on various parts of the scale tend to protect the observer against such error. This is not the case with the static method, where the observer may easily duplicate erroneous readings.

PECULIAR FEATURES OF THE FLEXURE OF THE PENDULUM SUPPORT.

In the preliminary work, when making tests with the interferometer, some very interesting facts were discovered in regard to flexure of the pendulum supports. The details of these experiments are not given, but can be found in the archives of the Survey. Only the results are given here. (a) The flexure of the concrete pier at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office produced by the pendulum swinging through an arc of 5 mm. is less than the limit of measure by the interferometer, and therefore it can be said that 'no correction for it is necessary. (b) When mounted in the best possible manner on this pier, the center of rocking of the pendulum case was found to be 3.75 inches above the capstone of the pier for an arc of 5 mm. (c) It was found that the displacement of the pendulum support, when the pendulum was swinging through an arc of 5 mm., was one-ninety-fifth of the displacement produced by the I 500-gram weight used in the static m~thod, both measurements of displacements being made with the interferometer. The computed theoretical result obtained was I :91 as the ratio existing between the displacement caused by the two forces, showing a marked agreement with the value found by experiment. (d) The measures by the old, or static, method may be in error by as much as I micron, corresponding to an error of 6 in the seventh place of period, for 1 micron is the smallest reading possible with the apparatus. (e) In addition to the rocking or rotary motion about a horizontal axis in the support due to the swinging pendulum, there occurs also a very small rotary motion about a vertical axis, for the pendulum is supported at a point slightly eccentric to the center of the case. This movement is too small to be appreciable under working conditions.
