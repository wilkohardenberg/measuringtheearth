S1rr: I have tile hmtor to preRc11t the followi 11g report on the progress made tluriug the past year iu tlie snrvcy of the Atlantic, Uulf, and Pacific coasts of the U uited St:ttes, For conn·u ieut retereJJce, the distrilrntion of the sun·eying-parties is g-in~n in talmlar form in Appe1tdix: .No. 1, aml in conl'ormits with that;, the work <lone iu each site will he 111c11tio11ed in geographical order iu tlw botly of the report.

For tlwse inten·als, aud i11 a11Y:rne(· of Hie issue of tiual charts for geiwral pm·poses, the local triangulations whicL were first eomplt.>tcd mu;.;t ht· joinecl. It bas i11 cousequmiec followed tlmt partH of the Atlantic and Gulf coast, m1s1~tt]()ll m1 account of' tl1c low, f<wamp.1, and sickly character of the shores, are uow occupied hy parties of tlw SlllTP,Y, arni, a;; was to be expected, many impedime11ts are euconntered in vushiug tile trianguhition. Alllongst these is the necessity of depending upon diHtant points for supplies required J..-· tLe part.it's; aud iu some places the ouly fresh water to be hail is hrought many miles duriug tic workin~-l'\eaHOH. The great lines of triangnlation along cacl1 coast tire :1hsolutels necessar,r, ancl are organic parts of the original plan of the surYey. Hy such means more than fourteen thousand points in all have Leen well determined in latitude and lougitmlc for dcfi11i11;.; the ,;horc-li11cs of the adjaePnt occarn;, b:i.ys;. harbors, inlets, and river-entrauces; aml the triangulation itself Jia;.; hefln du)ckPd at iuteryals b,r elaborate ohsetTations for geographica.l position. The geneml sketch (No. 1) whicb accompauicR this report shows only the main courses of tile fit.\111-work, as no map of orclinary dimensions would admit of representing, in relation to each other, all tlrn stati011R 'rhieh Lave hcen occupied for the coast-triangulation. Formerly, the local <la.ta gathered in tho progress of the surrny of the coast, such as the topograph.)' of lta.rbor-shorei,i, the acl,iaccnt soundings, precise knowledge of the tidal variation" deduced from long series of obsernttions, and k110\\'fo<lge of the effects of the currents, were callc1l fo1· only by engineers and constructors at our sea-ports, or at points or cousel]nenee aloug the coa,;t. But, of late years, no ste11 bas been taken to modi(y naturnl corn1itions, even in r<'mote places, without reco11rse to <lata aud conclusions which at least point out what shouhl be anlidPd. The ill t·lll·ct of encroachments n1lon channel-spaces relied on for the llt·netit of the public haH been clertl'ly demonstrated in repeated instances. lf the bottom of the cLannel is an.rthing but rod~, tLe material has probably been brought by the current, and bas been deposited hy natural forces. These may be so exactly balanced that any contraction of the wate1·-way, and consequent acc(~leratiou of thA H. Ex. 133--1

current, will disturlJ the bottom, especially if the material iR soft. In other cases, the tendency of the material to remain in place may prepomlcratc. But if )u any case the material at the bottom of a conunonly-nsml channel is mon·tl, it ifl well known that lJars or shoals are formed near the outlet of the clrnunel. In a case notice1l nmlcr tl1c head of Section I, i11 tlie following report, mention will be made of the method employed for determi11i11g the limits which admit the rigl1ts of marg-inal owners, and at the same time prese1·,-c the accm;tonwd route of lla\·ig-ation for the public benefit. At several of the northern sea-ports, <]tiestious of this kintl are now pending. In fact, the conviction is general at all our ports, that, inasmuch as changes for the worse may be actually in progTess without inteution, it is uuwise to negleet a11,r mea11s that may tend to nrni11taiu the facilities tlia,t now exist for commercial imrposes. It 111:>,ed not be explained tliat, excepting determinations of tlic latitmle antl longitude of the place, all the co11joincd data of the Slll'V<'.Y enter into the consitloration of such questions as are here alluded to. Including all the metlwds ;rn<l processes, the ontlii.r for tbe surrey of the coast and harhors, antl for the determination of points in the interior St.ates, costs le.ss than 011e-twe11tieth of one per ('Cut. reckoned upon the coastwise commerce of the United States. Intimat.e relations with the Light.-Ilouse Boa.rd have been nrniutained Ml heretofort>, and in that connection my personal attention bas been given, as chairman of tho committee on lighting, to the local detail;; pertaining to aids for wivigation on the A tla.ntic and Pacific coasts and on the lakes. These need not be specifiell, nor the benriug upon them of developme11t:,; nutde in the progrnss of the survey, as tl1e routine of' interchange hy establishell usage proJlerly make8 known to others auy collateral information gathered in either branch of the public seffice. Hegal'tli11g the dcfinitiou of the eoast aml harbor lincH, and the dcvcloprnc11t of their approacbN~, as for GovPrnment use.s alo1w, lt ma11ifeRt special a<lvantage inures to tbe seaboard States in the determination of points reqnisi te for defining the trend of the shore-line. The main points are preserved by marks iu the ground, and, by reconrne to them, ultimate Rtate snn·e.rs along the si>aboard can he prmmcnted at moderate expense. Hut the geodetic conn1~ction bet.ween the suryey of' the Atlantic and the survey of' tlw 1·acitic coast is in iti..;elf' of muc11 general interest. Revera! im1wrtant qnestiorni~ outside of tbe advautap-1" wl1id1 attaelies to accurate surveys of' the interior, depend upon l'nch connection. Oongn~ss has t:Jwrefore wisely authorizell the determination of points in such of the interior Rt.ates as make provisiou for their topog1·aphical or geological Rnrn\ys. Already, the ad;";:mtag-c to them is generally~ and soon will be universally, recognized.by the interior States. Jn New IlampRhire, where the work is well advanced, part of the outlay for detcrmi11i11g geographical points is nwt by the State treasury. 'l'he sum appropriated hy Congress for the work of this season was small, as will be seen by reference to the estirmttes which follow ; but, within the year, tbe geodetic connection bas been carried 011 in the States of New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Wii..;consin, and J\Tinnesota fur the nnrtl1ern line, in Maryland, \Vest Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri, and Colorado for the middle, am] in Georgia aucl Alabama for the southern; the points following- each other in succession at elevations most available for the determination of long lines of triangulation. Jn each of tliese States, stations have been occn}lied or selected, and, when the number is increased, each State will liave ~t frame-work npon which to construct a State map. While the henefit to the State is inunecliale: all vantage to the General Government, is equally certai11 in the future, aR explained in pr.-.vions reports. 111 one oft.he old Stat.es of the Union, map-errorsin regard to prominent 1andmark8 ha Ye heen dctect('d hy t.11c work of t11is _y(~ar; the positions as marked varying by from two to eight. milt·s from the 1rue positions. Similar cases have been mentioned in my previous rnports. 'fhe pnhlic ~Hh·a11ta.ge f{ained by snch correctioas is unqaestionabl<'. The snnTeying-partieR were all in t,he fiehl when my estima.tm1 wen1 presented in September Jast for continuing work during the next fl.seal year. The detailed estimates are J1ere annexed, and with them, as illustrating the scope of the field-work, a recapitulation of the operations of the present year.

Tbe preparation of a "Coast Pilot," or Sailing Directi011s, fo1· all the liarbors aud coastwise naYigation between Eastport, l\£e., a,ud Newport, R. I., has been completed, and that work is now ready for publication. Much additional data gatlie.rc<l wit11in the y1·ar will be emlimlied in new e1litious of the Sailing Directory for the Pacific Coast. '.l'be work in tho Coast Sm'\'OY Otucc, \Ybicli iucludei; the computation of resuJt.s from the fieldobse.rvations, and the drawing, engraYi.ng, and publication of maps and charts, bas kept pace with thc1 operations in triangulation, topograp11y, and bydrography. Nineteen charts, engra\'ed 011 copper, haYe been completed within the year, aml twe11ty-uine are in hand, exclush'e of six cl1art,s issued by means of the photolithographic process, which greatly expedites the publication of new material. In the Drawing Division, six.ty"tbre·i charts have been in banrl. :Fourteen thousand copies of copper-plate charts and fifty-three hundred of lithographic cllarts have been printed, a11d nearly as mau.r issued to saJc-agents, and to departments of the Govermneut, chiefly the Na''Y and the Uevcmrn .l\Iarine. Tide-titblcs for all sea-ports of the United States for the year 187-1 have been computed and issued. The important matter of repro<luciug the original topographical maps of the coast, whicli. exist only in a single manuscript copy of each, has received constant attentiou. Satisfactory results have been obtaiued by the comparati,,cJy inexpensive process of i1hotolithography, and, iu the order of their importance, these maps will he reproduced wlien the ref1uisite force i1:1 available aud meaus can be applied to that object. In order to continue the field and office operatious of the sarvey ou a scale corresponding with Ute rate of progress now reported, a small increase in the two leading items of the estimate seems unavoidable, on account of continued increase in the cost of supplies r(l(]uired in the field-service.

PAil.T II.
The operations of tho snn-P,\ing parlie;;; ill the course of the year will now be de8cribc·d briefly in geographical order, begirming on the Atlantic side with tlle coast of J\lai11e, ::mu terminatiug witl.J the coast of Texas. Of t!Je westem const, mention will iin1t be made nf work bef.wtien Cape San Lneas and San Hiego, a111l from tl1c11cc nortlnvanl, sites will be noticed in regular order, closiug \I itl1 1L11 abstract of the operations of tlw ye[tr along the coast of Alaska. Tl1e work of triangulation has been prosecuted in each section of tlie A ti antic coast. Jn the difficulties to be uwt at some places b_y this branch of tlie scrYice, as already mentioned, the 1011g experience in the tit·ld of Assistant Hiebard II. Cutts has availed mucl1. lnstructious to the parties engaged in secondary triangnlatio11 J1;we been ha;;;ed upon uh; eareful study in each ca;;;e i11 regar1l ()the re11nireme11 ts of Uie Hervice. On these parties, besides tlrn determination or points for adviwcing along the coast, de\·ol vc minor duties, amongst wliich may be mentiouetl the supply of now points for occasional resnrveyA, maue necessary by changes in the direction and depth of cha.nnels, an<l 11ctermiuatiorrn of the positious of new light-houses, beacons, aml buoys, in order that the pnblisbe1l charts arnl sailing-directions ma;y he conformable to the other aiUs pTovided for tlie benefit of mwigation and commerce. During the summer, AssiRtant Cutts served as an honorary commis8ioner at the National ExpoHition in Vienna, awl there 11ote1l amongst observing-instruments of the various classes, cognate to tho8e used in the i-;nrvey of the coast, such as were presented as improvements or as affonling special facilities in method or precision in obsening. His Yiews in regard to the comparative mm·it of iusLrnme11ts now emplo~·ed in geodeLic determinations a,re of mucl1 interest. In rf'ga.rd to limits and details of the to11ographical surveys, of which ahstracts wiU follow, I have had the experiencetl ail vice of Assistant Henry L. Whiting. 1:-'ystematic orcler bas Leen Le1d in view in pushing work to close the intervals in marginal topography occasioneu hy tlie necessarily detacheu order of work in the earlier surrnys, for which order reasons were Rtatecl in my openi11g remarks. Int.Le course of the season, Mr. Whiting-visited the working-ground of mo8t of the plane-table parties on the coast of Maine, and personal1y conductctl special surveys at PorUanJ and near New York, as will be stated under those heads in the abstracts which follow. Ile also inspect.ed the operations of parties on the coast of New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina, South Cai·oliua, and Georgia. His detailed report makes gratifying men-

Topography and ltydrograpliyo.f .tllount Desei·t Island, lllailie.-Thc survey of J\lount Dcsrrt falmHl was rel'lumed by a pa,rty nllller the clmrge of Assistant J. "\Y. Douu eal'ly in .fuly, a.nd in the coursl' of the season the eastern end was mapped by means of the plane· table from a point west of nilr Harbor around to a point westward of Seal Uo>c. Field-work was f;wored by almost unintermptcd good weather until the close of operations in October. All the islands adjacent to the eastern c11tl of Mount Desert are included in this snn·ey. It is estimated that the details r··t ont.standi11g can he filled in by a plane.table party before the close of another working-seasm1. As heretofore, Assistant Donn used the schooner Scoresby in this section. The somHling·" made by bis party define the eastern sea-approaches to Mount Desert to tlw distance of one mik from the shore-line. Bar Harbor was sounded, Otter CoYe, Seal Cove, aml other int.lcntatious, and the rocks and reefs in the immediate Yicinit,r of the en,stern end of J\lount De8ert Tslaml, were cnrcfully developed.

Dennis resumed 1>laue-table work in tllis section on the north siue of Deer Isle early in July. In continuation of the sun·e.v, he mapprd tlie western side, including Sliip Island and the sllore of Penobscot Bay, to Northwest Harbor; traci11K also the shore-line of Deer Isle beyond, nearly to its northern extremity. Eastward, the detltilcd work of this season includes the shores of Southeast Harbor, Greenlaw's Ned;:, Stiuson's Neck, the small islands iu that Yicinit;r, and the eastern side of Deer Isle a1ljacent to Eggeruoggin Bea.ell. Many isolated low-water ledges are represented ou the plane-ta hie sltect. The shore-Hue, as wrnally found in this quarter, is very irregular; and the hills near it, as far as they were included within the topographical limits, are rocky and rough, though not of great height. Mr. S. N. Ogden served acceptably as aid in this plane-table party. Field-work was contin1wd on Deer Isle until the 28th of October, when arrangements were made for the transfer of the paTt_y to resume duty in Section V, under which head tho previous work of J\Ir.

1'opograplty '!f c,istine llarl>o1·, Mainc.-Ifaving traced the shore-line of Cape Hosier district iu the prcce1ling season, Assistant A. vV. Longfellow prosecuted the ·letailed survey during the summer, and filled in the topography of Brookville, the north end of which bounds Castine Harbor.
On the north side of the harbor, some of the surface-featnres iu the vicinity of Castine were mapped.

Subassistant ,Joseph Ilcl'gesheimer was attached to this party, and assisted in the field and office work. Jiydmgraphy of Castine Harbor and vfoinity, Jllaine.- vVith a party in the schooner Silliman, and attemlc!l b_y the steam-launch Sagadaltoc, .Assistant Horace .Anderson commenced sounding on tLc 2311 of J uue at Castine II arbor. The completed sheet of tliis quarter includes the c.ntii'c harbor and Bagaduce River. .A second sheet was nearly filled with soundings made in Penobscot Bay between Cape Rosier anu the l<'ox Islands, joining there with hydrographic work of former seasons. Some ledges within the limits of this sheet, and the approaches to several of the islands, will be specially examined in another season. All the soundings in tltis vicinity were referred to a bench-mark on Uommercial wharf, Castine, where l\Ir. Anderson hall set up a tide-gauge in June. The work of this party in Penobscot Bay was closed at the end of October, when .Assistant .Ander· son proceeded to Ifarpswcll Neck, aml made additional soundings for the development of a ledge in that vicinity. He was aided in this section by :Messrs. F. II. North, E. II. King, and Oharles Coburn.

Topography of I>Jle au Haiit, Jlfa-ine.-The plane-table survey of this island, in which some progress had been made in the preceding season, was continued during the 1mmmer by Subassistant J. N. McClintock, who worked with a party in the schooner Joseph Henry. Of three sheets returned to the Office, one contains the completed survey of Isle au Haut. Most of the surface rep· resented is rock, but the soil between outcropping ledges supports a dense growth of pine allll alder. The outlying islands, which partly fill the other two sheets, arc of the same general char· acter, haTing rock,y, precipitous shores, long reaches of exposed grauit~ and shale ledges, with a dense but stunted growth of pine. Eagle Island and Butler Island differ from others in Ute vicinity in beiug fertile and well cultivated. The group included in the operations of the party of Mr. Mc· Cliutock this season lies between Northern Fox, Deer, and Little Deer Islands, Cape Hosier, and Islesboro'. Field-work was continued on the group until the end of October, when Mr. l\fcClintock w·as assigned to special field-service in Section II.

Oue hundred and eighteen small-islands and ledges are already represented on the two partiaJly-completed sheets. Daring the preceding winter, Subassistant MeClintock was in service in Section VI. He is now making arrangements to conduct a party which has been assigned to field duty in Section IX. ·Topography of Penobseot Rive,., Jlfoiue.-A.t Stockton, to which po.int the plane-table survey had been exten.dcd last ye;tl" along the western side of Penobscot Bay, the work was resumed in the middle of July by .Assistant O. T. Iardella. After carefully tracing the shore-line, and contour· ing the peninsula known as Cape Jellison, the detailed survey of tile western hank of Penobseot River was carried upwards to a point opposite to Bucksport. The water-front of that town was traced on a second plane-table sheet, as was also the outline of Orphan's Island, that forms in that Yicinity the east~rn side of the Penobscot. Nineteen signals were set up and determined in posi· tion. Tlte .marginal topography on the western side of the bay was made uniform with that of pre\'i· ous ,rears. As shown by the contour-lines, that sl1orc is bounded by hills that range in height from 100 to 600 feet; all being thickly wooded with pine, ash, and birch. Field-work was continued by

Portla1id Harl>0r.-The harbor-commissioners of Portland having requested ad\'ice for locating pro1ler l1arbor-Iimits in Fore River, the details requisite for reaching a conclnsiu11 were commit· tell to Assi8tants H. L. Whiting and Henry Mitchell. While a topographical survey, made by Assistant Hull Adams, was iu progress, tlrn curreuts of tlfe rh·er and its special hydrographie features were developed. The results were combined ou a map, which showed also, besides the sliore-Iines, the recent structures along the sllorcs, tlle encroachments, and the obstructions affecting the channel. The current-observations, upwards of 2,GOO in a11, recorded in July, were desi:;uml to give the carves of equal velocities at maximum ebb and at maximum flood for the eutire length of Fore Hiver, as evidently the Lar!Jor-lines to be drawn ought to preserve the scouring force. For the ruost part, the bottom in Fore River is very soft mud, which by any eonsideraule eucrnachment o-u tlle water actually in motion might lJe moved down iuto the broader aml more important part1-1 of the harbor. Irr advance of determining the amount of tide-water passing through each of ten sections of the stream, Mr. Mitchell computed the capacity of the ch1umel from data afforded by the hydrograp4ic sur,·ey of 1869. Current-observations were then maue simultaneou,;Jy at four or more l}Oints in each of tbe sections, to determine the transverse curve of t't1Zucity 1 which cnnt1 ·wm; reduced ·to the mean !Jy applyiug a co-efllcient so as to make the velocities multiplic<l iuto tile depths correspond with the volume previously computed from data of the hydrographic snrn\Y· After thus reducing the ten tran:sverse curves of velocity, it was easy to ckaw upon the map liues for each tenth of a nautical mile of velocity, and such lines were drawn both for eblJ and flood. The results proved that the water in actual motion does not occupy the entire section of tlie channel at some points, and that at others the movement is evidently impeded by artificial cncroachrnc11ts.

Old Orcliai·ll Beach, Mainc.-In tbe latter part of October, As'3istant Hull Adams examined the beach abo\'e and below tbc mm1th of Little River, across which an cxtemlc(l dam.Iias been built i;ince tbe completion of' the stir,·ey of that >icinity. The new strncture has caused a considerable cliang·c in local features. In a large basin, which now exists insitle of the embankment, the water, (luring hea>y storms, stands abo>c tlte level of title, the former outflow from Little River now p:~ss. ing through Jones Creek. In that quarter, an embanked road has been made to pass from Blue Pui11i and acros::; the marshes to the oceau-Leacb. These and other cxistiug features were mapped hy Assistant Allams; to be filed with the former tletailcd sun·cy of this part of the coast of Maino· llis piirt.r is now under instructions for topographical duty in Section IV. Triangulation-Geodetic connection-New llampshirc.-The object and resulting benefits of this anti similar schemes of triangulation in other States were referred to in my last annual report. It h;, therefore, only necessary to ad<l in tlli:,; couuectio11 Uiat tlie State of New Hampshire, un<ler her law of 18i2, has again contributed to this important operation by paying t be expense of erect. iug all tlte tertiary signals which were put up during the past season. In acconfance with my instructions of April, Prof. E.T. Quimby resumed field-work on the 1st of May aml closed on the 24th of 8epteml>er. The montll of 1\lay was occupied in reconnais.sance for tlrn purpose of selecting additional stations for extending the triangulation. Thi:,; work proved more difficult than in previous years, and a louger time was employml in it, in proportion to the number of stations established. One reason for this was the fact that the re.counaissai:1cc necessarily extended over a large part of New llam psllirc and a part of Vermont. Tl.Jc number of main stations selected during this time was ten ; but mau.r otlrnr points were visited to determine wbich were the most suitable for the purpose. Towanls the close of May, the party for triangnlation was organized, and occupied a station on Mount Cardigan, in the town of Ornnge, N. FL The observations there were completed and the party was transferred to Bean Ilill during the month of Jtme. By the 15th of July, the angles iit Beau Ilill were measured, and the ucxt station in order, Prospect Mount, in the town of Holderness, was occupied. The obser>ations at this, the third, station were finished, and the moving of the party and camp to :Moosilauk Mountain was a-0complisbed by the 5th of August. This mom1 tain is al.lout i'i,000 feet above tide. In consequence of winds aml rain, the observations at the station were not concluded nntil the :14t'1 of Septemher. haring the season, rrofessor Quimby kept an aid and one hand constantly employed in the selection of tertiary stations and in the erection of signals, the expense of which was paid by the State.

Jllagnetic ouservations.-Tho three elements of' declination, dip, and inte11sity, were obscn·et1 at Eastport, Brunswick, ood Portland in Maine, and at Gorham, Littlctou, anll Ha11ovcr in Xew Hampshire, in the course of September and October, by Dr. T. C. llilgard, acting under tho immediate direction of Assistant J. E. Hilgard. The ob;;ervations were as usual taken on three days at each station, and include determinations of the true meriuian by ohsenations of tbc suu. At Eastport and Portland, the same stations baye IJecn previou:,;ly occupied and will he hereafter, for ascertaining the rate of secular change. The Brunswick station estalJiisliell at BO\nloiu Collegp. will also serve the same purpose, as observations will be made frequently hy the professors. The results of the observations here noticed, and of' others in Section If, are given in Appendix No.16. George.~ Slwal.-In tbe course of the summer the Yicinity of this shoal, off the coast of Massachusetts, was examined by the b;rdrographlc party of Commander J. A. Howell, U. S. X, Assistant Coast Survey, in the steamer Bache, with a Yicw of Lletcrmining whctlier or not RJwcial changes in form, position, or depth had occurred since the survey of 1835. 'l'he rcsnlting cliart, iu comparison with the early sheet, shows differences in the position of shoal Rpots, but not such as t-0 indicate any actual change in position; and the ]Past depth found correspoll(ls with that of' tlie previous survey. Lines of deep-sea soundings were run by the party eastward from the outer edge of G\'.orge's Bank. In reference to the assumed position of "Hope Bank," the existence of which was reported iu 1869 as in longitudeG30 20' W., Commander Howell says: "The result of our soumlings seems to demonstrate that there is no bank having forty-nine fathoms of water within twenty miles of the position given as that of Hope Bank." Somewhat to the eastward a specimen of bottom was olJtained in 1,856 fathoms. From the same vicinity lines of soundiugs were run to Cape Sable, and from thence southward to the latitude of George's Bank. A be:wy non-detaclliug lead was used, with registers for determining deptll, and thermometers for temperature. The last-named im:trnments, as between two at the same depth, >aried four degrees in tcmt1erature indic:1tion, antl the registers as much as 6 per cent. in indicating deptb. The ofi".shorc soundings were made during July and August. In Se1)tember the vessel, in furtherance of the general work of the Fish Commission, was engaged in dredging on Jeffrey's Bank, Oaslie's Ledge, .TcffreJ's Ledge, Ste1lwage11's Hank, and to the northward and eastward of Cape Cod, under the direction of Dr. Packard and rrofessor Cooke, of the Peabody Academy of' Science. Many specimens of marine fauna were procurctl. 'l'lrn defective boilers of the steamer, however, lessened the seryice intended in dredging. On the 8th of November the vessel reached Baltimore, and, after refitting with new boilers, will be assigned to bydrographic work in the Gulf of Mexico. Under the head of Section VI, mention will be made of previous duty done by the party of Commander Howell. Early in September the party an{l vessel then in service on the coast of l'llaine narrowly escaped disaster. Having repaired one of the boilers of the steamer, Commander Howell saile<l from Portland on the 2d, autl was detained at Peak's Island in consequence of' another defect. Off Manhegan Isfand a tube blew out of the forward boiler, and both being then disabled the YesHel could not move by steam. Using sail to the best advantage, in a thick fog, a position was gained judged to be within a mile of Burnt Island, when the ship was anchored, bnt with increase of the gale the hawser parted soon after midnight of the 5th. Fortunately for that emergency the IJoiler defects bad been then so far repaired as to admit of the use of steam. The vessel haviug tlriftcd into seventeen fathoms, si;{>amed slowly·through the dense fog and was safely brought to anchor to the leeward of Burnt Island. \Vhen the bluff was first seen through the fog, the steamer was very near it, having but six: fathoms of water under the bow and sixteen and a half fathoms under Ute stern. Commander Ilowell was ably assisted in liydrographic duty hy Lieutenants ·w. II. Jacqurn:;, J. W. Hagenman, E. S. Jacobs, and Richard Rush, U. S. N., and by C. A. Bradbury, Master, U. S. N.

party left Baltimore on the 3d of July, in the schooner Palinurus, and resumed inspection in Penobscot Bay. .After testing proper lines for navigating up to Bangor, a hydrographic survey was made of Weskeag River, from its mouth to South Thomaston; and the survey of Tenant's Harbor was completed to the head of J,ong Cove. Several very dangerous rocks in the l\fusele Ridge Channel were developed by soundings, and were located upon the chart. After finishing this work tl.te party proceeded to Boston and commenced on the second section of the work, which extends from that port to New York. Sailing directions, prepared for all the harbors between Boston and Point .Judith, include the results of a thorough examination of Vineyard and ~antucket Sounds and Buzzard's Bay, with its numerous interior l1arbors. Narragansett Bay was also fully examined, amt many additions and corrections were made to charts of harbors between the limits named. Views of harbors, and of the approaches to them, were taken from such points as seemed most likely to render the sketches of use to mariners. These will be embodied in the forthcoming edition of the Coast Pilot. The work of preparing for publication the notes of this and previous voyages ltas been continued by Mr. Bradford in person. Some of the buoys in Boston Harbor haying shifted, the positions of all were determined this season under my special direction by the party in the Palimtrus. ·while in the vicinity of Cape Ann, Assistant Bradford made a hydrograpbic survey of l\Iilk Island Bar. The result shows that the liar l1as seven feet of water between l\lilk Island and the main land. The party remained in service on the coast of New England until the 19th of November, when the Palinurns proceeded to Baltimore to resume work in Chesapeake Bay, where the party is now engaged. The manuscript, iu the aggregate nearly fifteen hundred pages, of the first section of the Coast Pilot, which includes the Atlantic coast, from the northeastern boundary to Boston, is now i·eady for the printer, and will be put in hand for publication at once. It includes accurated escriptions of th.e coast, and sailing directions for every harbor between Calais and Boston. Many of the harbors were never previom;ly described, and of many on the coast of :Maine, as mentioned in my report of last year, no charts as Jet exist. On the coast of New England, Assistant Bradford was efficiently aided l>y Mr. John R. Barker, draughtsman, whose sketches and views of the different harbors give evidence of the veracity and fine finish which characterized all his previous drawings. After completing the examination of harl>ors in the Chesapeake, the party of Assistant Bradford will engage in similar duty, during the winter and ensuing spring, along the sootliern coast and in the Gulf of Floritla. Astronomical observations.-For determining the longitude of a point near Port Jervis, N. Y., in the boundary-line between New York and New Jersey, where an observer was stationed for the purpose in May and June, Prof. Joseph 1Yinlock, at Cambridge Observatory, conducted the requisite exchanges of clock-signals by telegraph. Under the bead of Section II further mention will bi3 made of the operations near Port Jen-is . .Pend11lum experiments.-Tests for determining local variations in gravitation have always been considered as essential in geodetic surveys, but have been deferred in the operations of the Coast Survey, under the hope of improvement in the methods heretofore adopted for such experiments. Of late years, however, the subject has bad renewed attention; and important improvements in the apparatus haYe been brought into practice. In August last, a party under the charge of Assistant C. S. Peirce occupied a station near North .A.dams, Mass., in the immediate vicinity of the Iloosac Tunnel, and there reeorded a .series of observations. The p<>.ndulums used were single pieces of brass, swung upon steel knife-edges resting upon surfaces of agate. Inside of a glass reooiYer with two walls, the space between which was filled with water, the pendulums were swung in vacuo, and were thus protected.from changes of temperature. Assistant Peirce was aidec.l in the operations by Messrs. W. B. McClintock, H. Jt""'arquhar, and A. W. Edmunds. The ftrst-named aid made a careful topographical survey, and determined the mountain contour within a radius of two miles from the station at which the experi· ments were recorded. Chatham, Cape Ood pcninsHla.-Tbe coast of the peninsula near Chatham, Mass., bas been recently subjected to unusual abrasion by the waves of the during heavy ga.les. In the autumn of 1871 7 an inlet opened through Nanset Beaeh, exposing the town-front fo the ocean, and elevate<l land near the light-houses was undermined by the action of the waves.

Admiral Ollas. H. Davis and by Messrs. H. Mitchell, and II. L. ·whiting of the Coast Surrn;y, l personalls ins1lected the changes which bad been wrought. The mere opening of an inlet was of little moment, records showing simil:ll' instances. On onr southern coast, mm·em'er, breaks through t'ie littoral cordon occur commonly during violent storms, and there, and elsewhere, snch ureaks have hatl no 1>hysical significance. nut in this case a diminution had !men observed for years of the area of Nauset Beach, and apparently the protecting barrier of sand was soon to disapvcar. The evident wasting away at this point was considered in connection with the reported increase of obstructions at the entrance of Nantucket Sound. l\fr. :I'tlitcliell was, tlierefore, instructetl to visit the place from time to time, and to note and report the rate of alteration. Ull(ler Lis immediate direction s<weral surveys haYe been made bs Subassistant II. I,. :Mariudi11, the last in NoYeml>cr of this year, and the results Mr. 1\Iitchell has included in a review of tlic liistory of tbi~ part of the coast, from the Yisit of Champlain; in lGOG, down to the present time. That review shows that betweeu parallels 410 39' and 41° 42' the beach-area was maintained from tho time of Champlain down to the year 1847, althougll the cordon seemed to ha>e fallen back, mucll diminishing the water-way uetween tllis beach and the main sand of Chatllam. Champlaiu's map sLowl'I a wooded island of about one hundred acres, which l\Ir. 1\-Iitchell identifiecl as the one marked Bain Island on the Coast-Survey map, where it is represented as having an area of about tliirtecn acres, an eleva,tion of twe11ty feet, and with an inlet in front, which exposed the island to the wear of tlic sea. In a lapse of twenty-one years, Minot's gale and other great storms having caused ch:mgeli, the second examination by the Coast Survey showed that between the parallels named the beach had lost two hundred and tl.tirty-nine acres, and that Rmn Island had been entirely washed away, Except the loss of this island, however, the upland suffered but little, being protected uy the strip of beach, lessened to about one-half of its former area. In November, 1871, the beach began to break up. Nearly one-third of it disappearetl between 18G8 and 1872, and the town front, an irregular elevated drift formation, lost so much that at some points the crest-line of the bank receded one hundred feet. During the present year, 1873, the beach has lost twenty-eight per cent. of its area, so that now there exists between the parallels before named on1y about one-quarter of the area found by the Coast Survey in 1847. The main land bas suffered but little in the course of the year, but liability to abrasion has been considered so imminent that buildings have been mornd back. Coincident with the wasting of Nauset Bea.ch, a rapid extension of the peninsula of l\fonomoy has taken place; and the bight at its extremity, popularly known as "The Powder Hole," has declined from a valuable harbor of refuge to a nearly-closed lagoon, accessible only to boats. "Mr. Mitchell's reports show that, in a more or less fitful way, l\fonomoy bas been gaining to the soutl1ward since 1750; but the movement between 1802 and 1853 was only thirty feet per year, while that in the short interval from 1853 to 1856 was one hundred and thirty-eight feet a year. The yearly gain during twelve years, ending with 1868, was one hundred and fifty-seven feet. Mr. Mitchell's observations show also that Monomoy Point curves to the westward as it advances, apparently tending to form another and larger bight which may in time bacome a <lesir· able anchorage for the coasting-fleet. At Jlresent, there is no refuge for vessels in this dangerous neighborhood; and as the cost of an artificial structure would be enormous, special interest attaches to this gradual 'movement of the sands. The inquiries here sketched I have connected with the h.)·drograplly of the approaches to Nantucket Sound. Subassistant Granger, whose work will be referred to under the next head, was therefore directed to act under the ad\"ice of Mr. Mitchell, so that comparisons desirable for developing the physical character of this part of the coast might be made without dela~-. In the Appendix:, No. 9 1 will be found Mr. Mitchell's second report, accompanied by Mr. Mariu din's sketch, which gives the sllore-lines of Chatham and Nauset Beach as they existed in tlie years moo, 1847, 1868, 1872, and 1873. Hydrography, Monomoy and Nantucket Shoals, Jfassachusetts.-In continuation of researches commenced last sea.son, Subassistaut }', D. Granger, with his party, in the steamer Enaeai·or, started early in July from Hyannis and made an examination of the shoal near Great Point, Nan· tucket. A few lines of soundings proved conclusive1y that what was supposed to be a permanent channel with four f.'l-thoms does not exist between the shoal and the point. The depth found was

about nine feet; the pa,ssage is narrow; the tide sweeps through with grea,t velocity, and, as the locality is sul~ject to rapid changes, the passage is very hazardous for any vessel not entirely fa.mil· iar -with the currents. A careful examination this season of the broken part of Pollock IUp showed marked changes iu the narrow "rips," but the tlcpths generally correspond with tlm results of soundings made last year. As the sand ridges liardly exceed thirty feet in width where tlie depth of water is least, doubtless they shift in position in the course of one season. l\lr. Granger developed a shoal in twelve feet, and several lumps llaYing only ten feet of water, near black can-buoy No. 1. The hydrography of this season joins with the southern limits of work done last year. East and west the soundings include Great Round Shoal and the space between it and the Handkerchief' light-»essc1. The hydrogra1lhy was canied southward as far as Nantucket light, and in its course a large area of broken ground was developed. Suliassista.nt Granger found on Great Round Shoal as little as five and a half feet at meall low water, and a depth of forty feet only two hundred yards to the southward. In balancing the conflicting statements made by fishermen and others, some of' which represent that parts of the shoal have been seen dry at low water, it seems probable that the 11osition of definite soundings is subject to remarkable changes from year to year. The northern part of Stone Horse Shoa,l was covered by the soundings made last year. This season the outlines and curves of depth were dcvclopcll. Mr. Granger says: "Since the survey of 1857, this shoal seems to bave moved somewhat to the southward and westward, leaving a number of' disconnected spots of ten, eleven, and fifteen feet. There has been a gradual wearing away of the northern part, and seventeen feet of water is now found where depths were only nine and ten feet. A spot of only seven feet on the northwest part was found in 1857, but in the same approximate position eleven and fourteen feet were found this year. On the southern part there has been a decrease in depth, soundings showing only nine feet in places which are marked on the old chart as having twelve and fourteen feet. About seventy-five yards south of black can-buoy No. 3 there is now a shoal spot of eighteen feet at mean low water where the depth was four fathoms in 1857." "1Yithin the three-fatliom curve St.<:me Horse Shoal and Little Round Shoal are connected. Tbe least water (five and one-half feet) was found. near the southeast part, and, as at Great Round Shoa1, the depth was found to drop off suddenly into deep water at the southward." "As was noticed last year, c-0mparatively few vessels appeared this season in the channel between Great Point Rip and Great l~omul Shoal, although this channel is much wider an<l somewhat deeper than the northern passage. Perhaps a few miles are saved by the northern channel, but, if the southern channel were mark~d by light-vessels and buoys, it would be preferable to the northern channel, especially for deep-draught vessels." Mr. Granger carefully determined the position of lights and buoys which mark the Monomoy Shoals, bnt tllesc are of necessity moved, and are moored in general conformity with changes in the position of the shoals. The two bench·marksmade last year at Powder Ilole Wharf were destroyed hy ice in the winter. Mr.Granger repcatctl tidal observations for mean low water, anu referred the results)o two benchmarks established on the shore.

North Ila>eu on tlrn Fox Islands, off the coast of Maine, have been kept 11p lly J. G. S1aukliug, a very gooll observer. The self.registering gauge now used here is furnished with dllplic,\te cvlin· ders, and~itll conveniences for tabnlating, so that high and low waters ancl the hourly mdit;ates are read and recorded b:v the observer regularly. There is also a heating-apparatus for circ·tlating warm water through the float-box to guard against freezing. This Lias proved a safeguard, ant1 no tides are wanting iu the registers of this station. The curYe traced is Yer_> regular, and the imlications lia\·e alwa,rs been tliaL the place is remarkably well suited for a permanent tidal station.

Doubtless these clrnuges were deemed by mm1,Y residents as not like! y to harm the large interests con0erned in tlie present condition of the harbor. That Yie"-, howeYer, was questionell hr some, who doubted whether such decided encroachments cou141 lea\·e the harbor 1111impairetl. This view· is warranted by the almost general belief that too much caution cannot be exercised in regard to artificial 8tructures in our harbors, and in general none are nowadays yen tured upon without careful study of their prolJable effect upon present alHl prospective intere,;t8.

The party of Assistant Harrison is now in effoctin· onler fol' resnming work for tbe winter 011 tile Atlantic coast of Florida, near Mosquito Inlet. Suruy of 11/ew Ha1·en Harbor, Comi.-Assistaut It. .M. Bache resumed field-work early in the 8pring, and in the coLu;se of the season determined by triangulation twenty-one pi:-ints in the im· mediate ''iciuity of New llaveu. In ,June, a large part of the city-front adjoining the harbor was mapped with the plane-tahle. Sub;;equeutly, tlie western shore was 1mrveyed as low down as Oyster Poiu t and tlie eastern side of the uarbor to include Fair Haven. '.l.1bc details, on seven tQpographical sheets of large scale, embrace nearly eight miles of wharf and other shore-linf\ features. ~lost of the ontlay for this work has been defrayed b,y the city authorities; and one of the plane-table parties, directed by Assistant Bache, was maue up entirely of members from the g-rad1rnting cla.8s of the Sheffield Scientitic Scl.1001, who volunteered their set"\'ices, without cost to the city. During the preceding winter aud spring .Assistant Bache plotte1l the soundings and completed the sheets of bis sllore-liue ancl hydrographic survey of last year. That elaborate work includes the develo1m1ent of every known rock or ledge in Sew Hamn Harbor. For the use of the city and the harbo-rcommis,,;ion the results have beer1 furnished in large manuscript maps, aml a duplicate showing the topography and h,ydrograpb,y has been prepared for the archives of the legislature of Connecticnt. An extension of this survey will be prosecuted in the coming season, at the expense of the city anthorities. Field-work for tlte present season was discontinued at the en<l of October. Sew rorl.: Ral'bor.-The re.snrrny of New York Harbor, to which some time has been deYoted, u11der the direction of :'.\lr. llenry )litchell, was not., when commenced in the year l871, intended to include the entire port au1l its approaclles, but only certain channels, shoals, and water-fronts, where changes for the worse ha<l been reported by the Pilot Commissioners, and which changes had been noticed also b)· the Cliamber of Commerce. As the work advanced, hQwever, the necessity was seen fur examining all tile ground co\·ered hy t.he published chart which was based upon the very careful survey made about fifteen years ago. DoniJtless it would have been expedient to test the former soundings at au earl,y day, if kuowu changes in the condition of the harbor had uot been actually reported. The examination now in progress, like the preceding survey, includes physical studies, designed to show the effects of changes l1oth natural and artificial. l\fy report of' last year commented upon the increase of the Jersey Plats, ancl mentioned the fact that deposits by tidal action no longer take place in the middle of t}\e Flats as formerly, but rest rather on the exterior slope, thereby encroaching continually upon the deep water of the main chmrnel. ::\lucb of the shoaling, as made manifest by the survey, is artificial, and is due to the dmnpiug of material dredged from the city slips and elsewhere; but, exclusive of this, there is ('Yi· deutl_v much tleposit broug·ht to this locality by the streams. Since, therefore, the Flats serve no longer as a catch-basin for sediment, lmt merely the subor<linat8 purpose of a tidal reserrnir, there is apparently no good reason why they should not b1~ turned to accmrnt for docks nu<l commercial oecupation, due caution being observed in regard to the exterioi· limit .of structures. To this e111l it was deemed important in the survey now in progress to determine the proper outer limit of occupation. Observations were accordingly made m1 the currents to admit of comparison between the transverse curves of Telocities and the normal

Tile re:-;ul1. shows that great 11arm urn.y inure to commercial interests from l:'uch niriations in l'hon'-liue a::; tend directly to diauge the eonditions of this dynamical equilibrium. The tletaile<l hsdrography done this season, under the direction of Assi~tant :\litclwll, is tbus desc1·ibed in the report of Assistant F. F. Nes, who prosecuted soundings with :t part,\· in the steamer Arago: "After establishing a tide-gauge at Sandy Hook, erecting and dctermiuiug the positions of siguals, aud setting range-stakes, lines of soundings were run to (levclop the aproning around San.:ly Hook from Government wharf to the Hook Beacon, and also aoout a mile down ~be beach." "The hydrography of New York lower hay was then comrneucet1 aud was 1nosecntcll, as the weather favored, until the 4th of September, when observations were takeu np aud continned until the 19th, on tlie currents of East RiYer, in conjunction with parties in the scliooner& Casu·ell an1l

Bowditch."
In the early part of October, Assistant Nes made repeated attempts to resmue somHlings in the lower bay, b~1t bad weather interfered and finally on the tl th Ute steamer was di:sabled by the giving way of the crown-sheet of her boiler. ln the East RiYer, near the foot of Nineteentll street, on the ::\ew York side, aml opposite to Green Point, the British steamer Easby struck on a point of rock on tlie 1st of Aug·ust. Search was made at once, under the tlirection of the board of pilot commissioner.'>, aud hy otlu·rs, but the development prO\'ed tedious, the rock being small, though within two hundred yards of the water· line. 'Yeather and tide favoring·, in the latter part of Sept.ember, Assist:mt Nes went to tLe place and by a sweep of the dredging-line found the point on which the Easby bad struck. A bnoy, for. nisbe<l by Commodore Trenchard of the light-house sen·icc, was placed ou the rock by the party of the steamer Ara.go. Full information iu regard to the danger, and a sketch sl1owing: tht· depth of water iu its immediate vicinity, were at the same time furuishetl to the pilot commissioners. lu East River Mr. Nes occupied seYen stations at ebb antl flood for determining the current.

Cit' from Castle roint dowuward, so aR to inelmle -I.he extensive structures of the New Jersey Central Hailroad Company at Communipaw and the docks and quays at Hohoke11. A tl10rough resurn·y betwee11 these limits, made ht November, by .Assistant f[. L. "'!Jiting, shows extensin aud important cl1anges since tlie ,year 18()~). \Yithin tlie last four years, part of the western side of the harbor lrns been occupied b,\· smm· of Urn largest commercial <lepots of the country. Tl1e extension of whan·es along the water-front, between Commuuipaw and Castle Point, \ras intenuml to lie in conformity with harbor-lines established 011 the Nev· Jersey side of the channel. ::\Ir. \Yhitit1g's recent sun·ey does not show that any special encroachments have been made on the cliannel-way, althoagh the ontr faces of the piers are not as true iu alignment as it would be desirable or a<l'fantageous to haYe them. In round numbers, the area liere occupie.cl by solid :filling since 1869 amounts to about three hundred acres. Thirt,r-four wharves, many of them extensiye structures, have been bnilt w-ithin foar years, making now a linear frontage of' about five miles. Subassistant H. l\I.

H. Gerdes at the end of Jul~-, and was completed on tlie 20tl1 of September. The snrn·y is represented by two plane-table sheets, one of which shows the Raritan valley and ri,·er, between Sayersville and New Brunswick; tbe otl1er contains details of the survey of the 8onth Ri\'er and Euglish Creek, which are navigable branches of the Raritan. At iuterrnls, while the field-work was in progress, the channels of the river and its principal !Jranclws were sounded, and the data thus gathered was plotted on a hydrograpliic sheet to which the :,;bore·line had been transf'errcd. Early in October, Assistant Gtmles proceeded to the Hackensack, and revised the snrvt>y of' that river between the railroad bridges, where considerable alterationR had recently been made in imprO\·erncuts. The soundings generally were made by Snbassistant 0. P. Dillawa;r, who conducted also the plane-table work on the branches of the Uaritan, under the supervision of ARsist· ant Gerdes. ::\fr. \V. S.

Ul1eat River on the south, and Bedford and Hillsborough, Pa., to the north. Toward the close of the seasou a partial reconnaissance mis made to the ridges, and facilities f'orcarrying on the work from Ililli;;borough to the Ohio Ri\·er. The scheme so far laid out extends from Harper'i> Ferry to the vicinity of \Va;vneslJorongh, Pa., and consists mainly of quadrilaterals, the lines varying in length from fifteen to sixty-five miles. It was intended that the scheme should follow the thirty-ninth parallel, but, although the mountain-ranges on that liue are somewhat the highest, the examination of the preYious seas011 showed that the restriction waR impracticable. In consequence the scheme was laid out between the thirty-ninth and fortieth parallels, and bas been continued to the westward within those-, limits. Assistant l\Iosman spent June and Jul.Yin a thorough examination of the mountains between Cumberland, Md., and Bedford, 1·a., on the east, and of those between Morgan town, in West Virginia, and Mount Pleasant, Pa., on the west. This region is unfavorable for long lines of sight, the mountain-chains being onl.r four or five miles apart, all, moreover, running nearly parallel in a northeast and southwest direction, with no prominent peaks, and all are beayily wooded on their summit.;;, On the return of Assistant Mosman from Georgia, the country, as far south as Oakland, was examined in the hope of finding longer lines~and better-shaped triangles by bending the chain more to the southward. The tract around Oakland, and westward to the Cheat River, was found utterly impracticable for the triangulation, for although very high, Oakland being 2,700 feet above the sea, it is a glade country filled with mountains of moderate elevation, and all heavily wooded. No prominent peaks there afford a view, in any direction, of more than ten or fifteen miles. A recouuaissancc was also made of the Laurel Mountains, north of the Cheat River, the most westerly range of the Alleghanies, but with no success, except so far as to make available the gap where the Yougl1iogeny breaks through the range, for connecting Ragged l\:louutaiu with the liills iu the valley of the Monongahela. Between the western line of the scheme reported and the Ohio River t11e country is one vast plateau, in which the streams have cut deep channels, so that the range of bills are nearly of the same lJeight, and consequently are very unfavorable for loug lines, in triangulation. Assistant Mosman found the work very laborious. The only means of transportation was by wagon and horseback over a region whicli bad few roads and most of them rough, and in which many of the summits were heavily wooded, so that, to a.void the expense of cutting lines of sight, the view an<l the approximate angles could only be obtained by climuing treeA.

Latitude and magnetic element~.-At the end of March, Assistant A. T. Mosman commenced a series of observations for latitude, at a station near the north end of Knott's Islaud, Ya. Owing to the prevalt'nce of clolllly weat.11er, the series desired was not completed until the 21st of April, when the party returned to Norfolk and was transferred to the mountain region for Teconnaissance, as suit.ell under t.he head of Section III. The magnetic elements were determined at Knott's Island while observations for latitude were in progress. The records anil field computations pertaining to this work were received at the office ertrl.v in May. Teu 11ights were employed for the determination of latitu<le, an<l the usual number in ascertaining the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. Similar observations were. rooorde<l by Mr. Moisman at another station.in this section, as will be stated presently, and also at a station in Section V. Triang-ula.tion, Currituck Sound, Virginia and North Carol'ina.-In view of tbe importance of the connection lJetweeu the primary triangulation of the Chesapeake Ba,y an<l the Bodies' Island Ilase, const1tnting a part of the am of the meri<lian from Principio to Ocracoke light-house, it was deemed advisable to continue the scheme of verification commeuced by Assistant Richard D. Cutts in 1869 and described iu my report for that year. .Accordingly, instructions were issued to Assistant R. E. Halter to take up the work wbere it was left off and to obtain another comparison of distance and direction farther to the southward.

Hatteras Slwals.-On a shoal spot, the existence of which w-as generally unknown until it was de,·elopetl by Acting l\faster lfobert Platt, .Assistant Coast Survey, in bis thorough survey of tlw clangers to navigation in passing Cape Hatteras, the steamship Genernl Sedg1cick struck, iu ::\lmd1 last, while on a voyage to New Orleans. The official uotice of the accideut was accompaniell with notes of the estimated position of the Tessel, consist.en t with the supposition that the lump in question had not been traversed hy either of the many sounding.Jines run by the party of Acting Ma'!ter Platt. In c011sequ n the steaml'r E1idem,or was temporarily assigned to his commm1tl, and, with that vessel, in l\Iay, be subjected his previous somu1ing>1 to the severest test in the reported vicinity of the shoal. An obsen·er with a theodolite was sent to Cape Hatteras light-house, and flags werr- placed at the outer slough buoys, both of which, having somewhat shifted, were carefully determined in position.

Latitude.-01.>servations for determining latitude were repeated by Assistaut J\loflmau at two stations 011 Portsmouth Island, N. C., between the middle of Fel.Jrmtry and the middle of Jfarch, The stations are distant from each other rather more than half a mile, an<l both are connected with the base line of the triangulation of Pamplico Sound. Eight nights were employed b.;· the party at one station and six: uights at the other, with t,hc zenith telescope No. 2. The micrometer val11e was carefully determined in tbe usual way. Mr. Mosman had been preyiously engaged in astronomical duty, as will be stated untler the head of Section '\'. Triangulation of Pamplico Sound, Xorth Carolina.-The triaugulatiou of Pamplico Sounu has hem1 continued without intermission since the <late of my last annual report. lu pursuance of instructions, Assistant Q. A.. Fairfield organizetl his rarty early in December, 1872, aud remained in the field during the summer and fall months. He is still at work, and will prosecute the triangulation during the coming wintr an<l spring. This com·se was deemed auvisable in orde1· to a \'oid loss h,\' using, as soon as pm~siule after their construction, the high tripods and signals <'rected for obi>erYiugacross the sound. 'Vith a single exception, the party has so far escaped sickness. The progress of the work was consiuerahly delayed by the difficulty in obtaining lumbrr, a11d the coal required for the steamer Hitelicock, which is in~ service for tl1Q_ transportation arnl accommodation <Yf the party, and b,y the long clistances which it was necessary to run for coal and provisions. Foor sets of primary tripods and scaffoldR were erected, one at each of the stations of Hog

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Island, Egg Sl10al, Gulf Island, and Long Shoal Point, ranging in height from 51 to tm feet. On each of these tripods high poles were set up and secured, to be observed upon as signals. The tin conu on the top of t11e pole at Long Shoal Point was 111 feet abo,·e tlie ground. At Hog Islaml the pole was a hollow tin tube, secured by three sets of wire guys. This stood until June 17, wheu a very violent squall crm;hed the tube and the pole fell. Iron vi.pe was thereafter substituted fo1· the tin tubes, and so far with entire success. Tue structures at the statfons are believed to be now so firml;y erected as to be able to withstand tbe most violent gales to which thp, souml is subject. It will be readily understood that on tLe character and permanency of the high tripods, scaffolds ' and signals much depends in the triangulation of so wide an expanse of water as Pamplico Sound, the shores of which are rarely more than two or three feet abo,·e high-water mark. Several of tlie triangle sideR exceed twenty miles in length. . The observations at the primary stations, Swan Quartm·, Royal Shoal, and Ocracoke light-ltouse, have been com11Ieted, and those required at Egg Shoal nearly so. The seconuary triangulation as far eastward as Bluff Point has been finished. In the execution of this work tripods and scaffolds were erecteu to enable tlie observer to overlook the high grass of the marshes o·er which the lines passed. Assistant Fairfield mentions with commenclation the services 1·endered by his two aids, Messrs. B. A. Colonna and W. B. Fairfield.

Topography of the Pungo Rii·er, North Oarolina.-On the 12th of December, 1872, Assistant F. 'W. Dorr again took cllarge of the Hetzel, a worn-out steamer, w1ticl1, as a hulk, has been some time nRed for quarters in the field operations of this section. His plane-table pa,rty was organized at \Yashingtou, N. C., and started for Pungo River, in the old vessel, on the 6th of January, the excessive colll of the preceding month having frozen the Pamplico from shore to shore. Head wiuds and storms kept the Hetzel a week on her short passage, but by the middle of January the survry was resumed in the upper part of Pungo Hiver. Assistant Dorr ha<l predousl,y mapped the shores of the rh·er aK high up as the mouth of Pungo Creek and Duran':; Point. From tho8e points, i11 going uorthwanl, he traced the shore-lines of the large, branching tributaries known as Pnngo Ore!'k au<l Pantego Creek, and many smaller streams.

After joining '!ork with a sheet filled in the previous season, l\1r. Dennis surveyed the coursfl of the river to a distance of eleven miles, and mapped the topographical details betweeu the main branches and north and south of the shore-lines, including also the lower part of South Island. The main road from Charleston to Georgetown, S. U., was taken as the western boundary of the survey. Subsequently, the South Santee and its branches were inclmletl within the limits of work. All the water-courses adjacent to the completed topography were carefully sounded. It is noticed in the field-report tbat some of the numerous rice-fields, which were of necessity trarnrsed by the plane-table party, having be~m uncultivat;e1l for a fow years, are now covered by a growth of vines and canes, so as to be almost impassable. The sonndings made, in the aggregate upward of tbirtytwo thousand, were checked by nearly a thousand measured angles. )fr.

Trirmgulatirm, A tlantfo Gorrnt of Ji'[l)riila.-The triangulation along the Atlantic coast of Flol'ida was continued during the past "eason under the direction of Assistant A. M. Harrison, aud was extended from the headwaters of the ;\f;ita11za,s River southward, to inclucle Halifax Ri,·er, for a distance of sixteen miles. Tlrnt points required for the topographical smTey might be determi1w<l before the arrival of the plane-table party, Sul>assistant J. N. McOlintock was sent early in November, with directions to take up the triangulation where it was left off at the eud of the previous season, and continue it to the 8outhward. Mr. McOlintock began :fielll-work December 1st, and after a personal interview with l\Ir. Harrison, who reached Saint Augustine on the l:ith of ,fanuary, the triangulation was continued southward until the 26th of l\Iarch. During the latter half of the season Mr. McClintock assisted Mr. Harrison in the detailed work, which was prosecuted with the sloop Steadfast, the vessel built for the accommodation of the varliy operating in this section. Tile progress of the work during December and January was somewhat delayed by the difficulty of obtaining transportation for camp-fixtures and lumber, and especially by the necessity of opening most of the lines of the triangnlation observed to the north warcl of Halifax River.

Under the hea<l of Section II, mention has been made of the occupation of the party of Assist. ant Harrison during the summer. Points ha,·e been determined along· the I:lalifax Hiver for extemling the SUlT<'.Y in tllis sPctiou to include J\Ioi;;qnito l nlet·, aud :\Ir. Harrison is now preparing to resume topographical sen·il'e in that quarter. Before leaYing the section in l'llay la8t, he estalllishcd two tidal stations, and erected signals along the shores of Halifax HiYer, tlle llydrograplly of which will be taken up early in the course of the coming winter. H.ydro,qra11hy, Florida Rcef.-'l'lie bydrographic party of Co1mnamkr J. A. Howell, l:nited States Ntffy, left New York i11 tlie steamer Bache 011 tlie h;t of December, 187:?, llll(l, after a stormy passage, reached Tortugas on the 2d of January, haYing touched, in the i.uteffal, at Norfolk arnl at Key"' est. The following H!Ot1tL was employed in erecting and determining the position of signals on Bird Key, Garden Key, aml Long- Ke~-, and in the measurement of a base-line for hydrogra pbic purposes 011 Loggerhead Kt·y. "-\.s weat11er pe1 mitteu, tl!e adjacent hydrogTaphy ath-anced, and was plotted by Lieutena11t .Tae1111es, United :4!aieo; XaY,,-, to wl10se personal cnre in regard to dehli1s tllis mention is due. From tbe 20th of April m1Lil the 12th of .:Huy, :-;ouutliugs were cxtemle1l iu the .-icinit;y of the 'J'ortugas. The vess1·l sailed at the last-rnm1tiorn::><l date for Kew Yol'k, and was suuscquently in b;ydrograpbic sen·ice, as stated nnder Section 1. For soundings along the. reef, abont 1,iiOO angles were 111easured, arnl 11,IG!l ca.-.ts of the lead were recorcled. On the passage northward from this section, Commander Howell noticed a very :-;trong current in the Gulf Stream. \Vhen further means are provided, special observations will he made by the same officer in regard to that important feature of tbe Atlantic coast approaches. Triangulation, topography, mu] hydrograplty, 1Nsfern coast of Plorida.-The work of coutinning the survey, in all its hranches, from Clear \Yater Ilarbor to Tampa Bay, was placed under the charge of Assjstant Herbert G. Ogden, and, in view of the different classes of work to be executed, l\fessrs. Andrew Bmid and S. N. Ogden were assigned to him as aids, :ind tlrn sthoouers ,_"1_1eerlwell and Agassiz for the ase and accommodation of the party. The Speedwell, from Baltimore, reached Cedar Keys on tLe !!d of JanuaQ·; and the AgasJJi;:, from Mobile, after stopping at A.ppalachicola for the base-apparatus, arrived at 'l.'ampa Bay on the 29th of December. The Agassiz, soon after leaving .A.ppalachicola, encountered a succession of severe gales, during which the vessel sp1·ung a leak. At one time the water was over her cabin:fioor, and, being an old -vessel, she was found, on ller arrinll, to he in an unfit condition to leave the bay. The work of the season was commenced by the measurement of a llase on the north end of Sand Key, Clear Water Harbor, by the determination of an astronomical azimuth aml latitude at a station of the first quadrilateral from the base, situated on the east side of the harbor, and by the connection of the base with the triaugulation of 1861. The base, consisting of two lines slightly inclined, was two miles in length, and was measured with the secondary apparatus. The astronomical observations were made by 1\Ir. Edwin Smith, aid, who had joined Assistant Ogdeu at Cedar Keys. l\lr. Smith redeterminetl the direction and length of the sides of the most southern triangle of 1861, and strengthened the connection hy angular measurements on Umbrella Pine, the position of which is shown on Sketch No. 10.

When the work required to the northward of the base was complete, the triangulation was extended to the southward, down Clear vYater Harbor; through Indian Pass, where the triangles were necessarily small; thence down Boca Ceiga Bay, in wbich the scbeme was gradually enlarged; and, finally, across the entrance of Tampa Bay to Anna l\fa1·ia Key, in Sarasota Bay, terminating at a sit.e selected for a base of verification. The crossing of il1e bay was effected by two quadrilaterals, in which the longest side was fourteen miles in length, and with eastern points well up the bay. For the \erification of the work se\en lines, varying in length from two and a half to nine miles, were carried tbrou.gh the scheme, i11dependcnt of the general triangulation. The season, which was made a most successful one, notwithstanding the delay caused by the non-arrival of the Speedwell as early as expected, closed on the 16tb of May.

The mainland, on Clear 'Vater Harbor, is high, reaching 20 foot, a little back in the woods, but gradually recedes, merging into marsh, and, abreast of Indian Pass, it entirelJ· disappears. The shores of Boca Ceiga Bay are low and generally dry, with little marRh. In this quarter the coast is covered with a growth of pines, interspersed here and there with a few round-leaf and live-oak trees. The islands are all of the same general character, low and sandy, aud free from dunes. Their interior sides are bordered with mangro\e, and ma11y of the smaller islands are submerged at high tides. Good fresh water was very scarce, and neither the water taken by the party from the wells nor from the few streams which were fonnt1, would keep its quality longer than a few days.

In consequence of the condition of the schooner Agassiz, no attempt was made to bring the vessel up to the main party at Sand Key. l\Ir. Andrew Braid, who had charge of the schooner, was, therefore, directed to measure a preliminary base in the vicinity of where he then was; to erect siguals and make a plane-table triangulation, a11d upon that sheet to develop the topography snd hydrograpby. The signals were afterward determined by triangulation, and the work executed by Mr. Braid was thereby checked and found to be satisfactory. The hydrography extends from the north point of the entrance to Tampa Bay, to Big Pass, and includes the six inlets on tbe coast, and the passage from Boca Ceiga into Tampa Bay. A channel of about 5 feet water was found through Clear Water Harbor and Boca Ceiga Bay, but the narrow strait con11ecting the two was impassable for even a small boat, except at very high tides. About 7 or 7~ foet can be carried o>cr \he bars of a,U the inlets, except Indian Pass, which is almost dr~'· Extensive flats make out from the shores of t!ie inclosed hasins, stretching sometimes nearly all the way across, and rendering the channels tortuous and difficult of navigation.

Triangulation eastward of .Appalachee Bay, Florida.-The triangulation of the comparath'ely unknown coast from Saint Mark's toward Cedar Keys was assignecl to Subassistant F. \V. Perkins, with instructions to strengthen the triangulation connecting Saint George':,; Sound with A1lpalachee Bay before taking up field-work at Saint l\Iark's. Mr. Perkins le~t Appalacbicola in the Rchoouer Torrey at the end of December, 1812, aud reached Alligator Harbor, Saint James faland, on the 3d of January. After a diligent search one point only, Wells, of the former triangulation, could be identified, but as others were required, a rough triangulation was made, in which tlte line from Wells to a point assumed as one of the stations previously occupied was used as a base. By tlJis method Franklin Point was recovered, and Mr. Perkins found tl1at the granite block marking the station had not been disturbed. Search was continued in this vicinity, but pro-\ing unsuccessful, the Torrl'y 'Tas taken around iuto Ocklockony Bay, on the north side of the island, and on the day of tlie arrirnl of the party, January 16, the two stations, Chaires and Piccoline Bayou, were foum1. "-ith these as a base, the line from Gliairn to Lansing was redetermine(), and from each of tlJe two last stations a line six miles in length was ·opened through tbe woods and across the is laud to Fraukliu Station, effecting the desirecl junction by a single well-shaped triangle. 'l'o enable the observer to see o\er the ridges of high ground in the interior, tripods and scaffolds, ranging in height from 18 to :2!) feet, were erected at the tlJree principal stations. \Vbile occnp,ying Frauklin Point the angle be· tween Lansing and V\relJs Stations was measured in orcler to transfer the azimuth to the other side of the island. The improvement consisted in substituting a direct connection across the island in place of the small triangulation following around its shores.

Perkins proceeded with bi;; party to the mouth of the Ocilla River, to continue the triangulation from Saint }lark's toward Cedar Keys. Two points about midway between Saint Mark's and the Ocilla Hi\·er were recovered, an<l from this base the triangulation was extended down the coast to \Varrior River, a. distance of tifteen milel'i. The following extracts from the report of Mr. Perkins well describe the character of this part of the coast of Floricla, and the difficulties to be encountered in the prosecution of the work: " Tliir; marsh which forms the coast-line extends back to the woods, a distance of from one to two miles. The coral underlies this at a depth of from two to eight feet, occasionally cropping out and giving a foothold for the cabbage-palmetto ancl red-cedar which at those places form hummocks of a few rods in e~tent." "Numerous creeks and rivers traverse this marsh in all directions, their beds and often their banks being formed of the solid coral-rock. Some of the rivers are quite deep, but the majority of the creeks are merely the natural surface-drains wllich carry off the water left upon the marshes by each bigh tide." "Upon ascending the larger rivers four or fi.\'e miles, I found their beds ollstructed by large bowlders of coral-rock, the shores low and swampy, but with a rapid current. A little farther on, the banks were high, firm land, and the current in the contracted channels more uniform."

"'l'llere are no inhabitants near the coasi, and but very few upon the hig·h Iau(l visited in the interior." "A near approacb to the coast is r111i te difficult and atten<letl with more or less danger. The shoal water extends from one to three miles from the shore, antl ledgei-; or rl:'efs of coral-rock, ri:sing abruptly from a nw,v level bottom, make the greatest care necessary in coasting within sight of land." "The bottom is of fossil-coral generally covered with a deposit of mud from one to three feet iu-. depth." · "Shoals, im1iassable for boats, except at high water, extend from half a mile to a mile and a half from the shore, and these, together with the distance at which it is necessary to auchor the vessel, make landing with lumber and for observations Yery difl]cult, and cause much delay in the prosecution of the work.'' "As the condition of the atmosphere over the marsh was generally unfa v'orable for obser,·ations, and the difficulty of reaching the wood-line very great, signals were erected upon the offlying shoals, arnl the points along the shore-line were occupied with t4e theodolite.'' "Tllis left one.concluded angle in each triangle, but the better seeing over the water and the greater rapidity with which the work was carried forward, more th rm counterbalanced the possible error so introduced." "Tlle legs of the water-signals were sliarpene<l and <lri\-en tlowu to the bed-rock and then braced together. No difficulty was found in making them stand during the Lime required to complete the measurements, but the summer gales will probably destro;y most of them.'' ".As all the points-that it was possible to occupy were iu a nearly Rtraight line, it became neces8ary to determine such third-order points as were required by tile throe-point problem." In reference to the possible error depem1ent upon concluded augle,;, it shonl<l be mentioned that the work was checked by the tram;fer of the azimuth from the farthest visible station back to the most<lii,:tant visible poiut fonvarcl, tile line of verification paRsing- generally through four tri. angles.

Hydrogmphy near Saint Georr1e's Sound, Florida.-For developing the hydrograpby of the Gulf of Mexico in the approaches to this sound, Assistant Horace Anderson established a tide-gauge netu Saint George's light-house, in the middle of Jauuary, and during four months continued the record of high and low waters. Soundings, meanwhile, at all favorable intervals, were extended into the Gnlf, the lines run being geuera11y more than ten miles in length. These, crossed by others in a northeast direction, were properly joined with tho work oflast year. Tile space soull(led defines the approaches to New Inlet, three miles to the south of which a shoal was developed having only nine feet of water. .At all other parts of the working-ground the water was found to deepen uniformly in going broatl oft into the Gulf. .Assistant Anderson used the schooner Silliman for sen·ice in this section, amt also in Section I, where bis party was emplo;ved during the summer.

Ga., was chosen as tlle natural terminus of a chain of large triangles, some of which l1ave beeu already determinetl li.Y occupying stations in the mountain region of tlie mith1le of Virginia. Assistant C. 0. Boutelle determined the length of the base, tnwanl the end of last vea 1-, bv means of the primary base apparatus, but, in Yiew of the importance of the site, a remcas.uremei;t of the line in hot summer weather was deemed adyisable to insure accuracy, as upon tlle Yeracitv of tliis line must depend, also, the correctness of positions chosen for the geodetic connection tl!1'0~1g'h tliis entire region. Ha.Ying proyided all suitable means for comparing the standard bar with those used iu the tubes of the base apparatus, Mr. Boutelle commenced the measurement of the line at the enll of July. Assistant A.

M:any obsen-ations, recorded for this purpose, will be fully discussed hereafter. The remeasurement of the line was completed on the 21st of August, when .l\lr. l\Iosman left the irnrt.r and engaged in service to which he had been previously assigned in Section III.

The measurement of horizontal angles at that station reqniretl only nine 1lays, the fa,vorahle condition of the atmm;phel'e being almost unpreeellentecl in the experience of obsen·ers engaged in the primary triangulation. Two rnontlis w<>rP occupied in securing the same number of angular measurements at the preceding station. Triangulation, Georgia.-This work, which had been assigned to Assist.ant F. l'. \Yeuber, was commenced in FelJruar.r. During the preceding months of November and Deceruher, and part of January, he was engaged in ousen'ations for magnetic declination~ horizontal intensity, antl dip, at a station near the Atlanta base, and in assisting in the first measurement of that base under the direction of Assistant Boutelle. The latter part of January and the following month were occupied in the erection of primary signals on Sawnee Mountain_ and Kenesaw Mountain, and in making a nPw set of magnetic observations. J'llarch and April were spent in reconnaissance with Assistant Sullivan, though the country lying to the westward of Kenesaw Mountain, aml in erecting primary signals on Cm·nes, Pine Log, and Lavendm· l\Iountains, and secondary sigua]s on Cr>osa, Pine, mHl Lost Mountains, the point selected for the extension of tlie triangulation. At the end of l\lay JHr. \Yehber proceeded to Kenesaw Mountain, where liis camp had been pitched, but owiug to rainy weather the obser\·ations there were not completed until the middle of Augni:;t. 'file ob~ernitions made include a set for magnetic declination, horizontal intensity, and dip. Toward the close of August the party was transported to Sweat Mountain, to the summit of which a road had to be built for a distance of two miles. At this station tl10 measurements of -horizontal and vertical angles and the magnetic olJservatious were completed br October 10.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Reconnaissance for t!te geodetic conneetion, Georgia.-Reconnaissance in Northern Georgia for points in the geodetic connection was resumed by Assistant John A. Sullivan in March, and was continued until the middle of June, but was 8Uspended in consequence of illness. In September, Mr. Sullivan again took the field, and closed his reconnaissance in October. In the preceding winter he assisted in the measurement of the base-line near .Atlanta. .After visiting the four western stations previously adopted, and adding a station still further to the westward, Mr. Sullivan made a thorough examination of the country as far as the Sand-, Mountain range, and selected fin\ additional points, by means of which two bases will be supplied for crossing the Sand Mountain plateau and for a practicable connection with the Lookout range, as well as one for the extension of the triangulation to the northward across Tennessee to the Cumberlan(l Mountains. He also made a reconnaissance of the country northeast of the Atlanta base, and beyond its immediate counections, resulting in the selection of two points, Skitt Mountain and Currahee :Mountain, for extending the primary tria.ngulation parallel with the Atlantic coast and toward tbe Shenandoah Val!ey. The scl1eme of triangulation is so arranged as to connect with the primary series before referred to, and independent of the base, to cover the entire northern part of Georgia. (Sketch No. 11.) Assistant Sullivan reported at the Office in Decemher, and during tile present winter will be engaged in Flpecial field-duty in Section II.

Hydrogntpliyof Cliancleleu1· Sound, Jllississippi.-Thc steamer Endea1·or left Baltimore on the 7tu of December, 1872, with the party of Suhassistant F. D. Granger, but owing to bad weather did not reach the vicinity of New Orleans until tbe 18th of January. As soon as practicable the party was at work on the eastern sitle of C!Janclelcur Souud, a.ntl there continued operations until the middle of .April. Owing to natural changes of recent years, and to the wanton displacement of screw-piles which marked the stations of tile triangulation at the outset of tile war; Mr. Granger was under the necessity of determiuing such points as were needful in the bydrography. The soundings subsequently made <leYelop thA eastern part of the sound, and join with work done in previous years. Some of the lines of soumlings being fifteen miles distant from the Chandeleur Islands, were determined by observing, on signal-poles mounted on rafts, three of which Subassist. ant Granger moored at suitable positions, -varying from six to ten miles from land, from time to time moving the rafts as occasion required. The signals of his device wero visible seven miles; and the rafts being held in place merely by mushroom weights, were readily moved into other positions. The results of this survey show that eleven to twelve feet of water can be carried through the eastern part of the sound. In reference to the channels, Mr. Granger says: "'Vi th Chandeleur light-house bearing east, one mile off, by steering S. by \V. i \V., vessels of eleven feet draught can go through, and will pass between Old Barbor Keys and a shoal which lies about three miles and a half northwest of said keys. This shoal is narrow, and extends about four miles in a N. by E. and S. by W. direction, and has as little as 4! feet of water ou it." "The channels of the sound are known to few, except those who earn their Ii ving by fishing iu its waters. Many vessels drawing only seven or eight feet pass to a.nd fro eastward of the Cbandeleur Islands, not daring to venture through the sound." The report of Mr. Granger specifies many changes which have occurred in the contour of the islands, and corresponding alterations in the positions of some of the keys lying to the westward of the Chandeleurs. He was ai(led in this section by Messrs. D. C. Hanson and C . .A. Ives.

Triangulation, topogr1rphy,an11 lty<lror1raphy of Jlississippi River, Louii>imw .-Assistant Charles II. Boyd resumed work in this section on December 29, 181:.!. The progress made during the season in the triangulation, topographical sun-e.r, aml h;ydrograplty of the riYer, has beeu entirely satisfactory. The weather was unusually faYorable for field-operations. Commencing at the base, Panny-Jesuit, wl1ere the work was suspeml<~d early in 1812, tlw triangulation was extended up the river to ::S-e\Y Orleans, a distance of 2G miles, and was well checked throughout its length. The conneetion witll the point formerl.1- occupied iu Sew Orleans was partially effected; that witl1 the J,ake Borgue triangulation was arranged, and the iuterveuiug country was examined preparatory t-0 the opening of tlw lines through tlie cypress-swamps. In regard to the difficulties encountered in carrying on this work, _Assistant Doyel meutiorn;;, among others, the necessity for extrellle care in selecting lines across the llelt of fast-laud llor<lerin)!; each bank of the river. This belt is either densely wooded, or cultivated in sugar, ricP, mid fruits and hence, much lalmr was required to find tile courses most free from obstructions auu most favorable for the work, and, at the same time, unobjectionable to tlie proprietors of tLe laud. So far, no damages have beeu paid_ or asked for. Behiud the strip of fast-land are the c·ypress-swamps. Owing to the lernl character of the country, tlte theodolite, as in prcYious seasons, was clcYated on tripods, from 20 to 25 feet in height, at e\-ery station occupied by the obsen-er, except i u cases where chimneys, steeples, and buildings could be used as substitutes. Mr. C.H. Yan Orden senTetl as aid in the tl'iangnlatiou, aml :\IL J. Hergeslteimt>r in topogn1ph;:.-. Both performed their respecti\·e duties acceptably. Field-work was closed on the 24tli of .

It was f~xpected that another sheet would have been ·~ompleted, but with the hope of clmdng tl1e triangulation at New Orleans during April, the whole force of the party was given to that s1iecial work, and, after April, funds were not available for carrying out the p111u of leaviug the topographical party to bring up the survey.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDJ<JNT OF

Triangulation in 11lissouri.-The triangulation.party, under Assistant Boyd, was transferred at the end of April, from Louisiana to the vicinity of the hase, in Illinois, opposite Saint Louis, where the work of the geodetic conn~ction was resumed on the 1st of May. During that month, the four stations on the Illinois side of the l\Iississippi Hiver, including the ends of the base measured on the American Bottom, were successively occupied, anu, in June, the measurements of horizontal angles, at stations on the l\Iissouri side, were in great part completed. The progress of tlie observations at these stations was greatly delayed by the smoke banging over Saint Louis, through which some of the lines of sight nece~sarily passed. Early in July, the intense heat increased the difficulty ot' seeing the signals, and the malaria of the season and locality made all the party ill. Under these circumstances, it was impossible to obtain results at all adequate to expenditures. Field-work was consequently suspentled during that mouth and August. .Assistant Boyd and his aid devoted this interval to the large amount of office-work on hand, belonging to the survey of the Lower Mississippi. Field-work was resumed near Saint Louis early in September, and continued until the 3d of NoYemher, when the season closed. During this period the reconnaissance was extended, and the triangulation, the sides of which vary in length from eight to eighteen mileR, was completed for a distance of thirty-two miles westward of Saint Louis. The principal obstacle to rapid progress in this triangulation is found in the forests of hardwood, which cover all the ridges, and through which, without cutting lines of sight, the use of the tlieodolite ii' impossible. This natural impediment cannot well be met in ,July and August, for reasons already stated. The be8t months for carrying on the work, Assistant Boyd states, from the experience of two years, to be the season from September 15 to November 15, and during l\Iay and June. Mr. C. H. Van Orden, the aid in the party, is commended for efficiency in the reconnaissance and triangulation. The statistics for this season are :

Lapham, chief geologist, in April, applied for the benefit of the provision of Congress in regard to tbe determination of geographical points on which to base the subsequent State survQy. I'rof. .J. E. Davies, of the State University, at Madison, qualified himself for field-work in triaugulation by personally witnessing the operations of Professor Quimby, who passed tJie summer in determining points within the limits of the State of New Hampshire. Owing, however, to the limited means available for continuing work already begun in the geodetic connection, it was found inexpedient to commcnco triangulation in Wisconsin within the present fiscal year. That the request of tlie State geologist might be met in part, arrangements were made for the determination of several geographical poi!~ts by observations for latitude aud longitude. In July, Assistant G. W. Dean conferred with Dr. La1)ham, at Madison, and established an astronomical station in the grounds of the university, about a mile west of the State-house. The station was carefully marked by stone piers, and the longitude of the point was determined by exchanging clock-signals during five nigltts in the latter part of July, between Assistant F. Blake, at Madison, and Assistant Edward Goodfellow, at Omalrn; the longitude of the last-mentioned point baYing been determined in 1869. At Madison, Assistant Blake determi11ed the latitude by observing twelve pairs of stars during five nights with the zenith telescope. At La Orosse, vVis., a station was marked in Court-House Square, and clock-signals were exchanged with the observer at Omaha during four nights. Latitude was determined at the same station from the record of observations on thirteen pairs of stars during three nights. While these operations were irqnogress, request was made by Prof. William Folwell, president of the Minnesota State University, for the determination of a point at Minneapolis; some prelimi-

nary action having been taken in the State, in regard to a trigonometrical sun·ey, wl.ticll mi~·ht soon be commenced, under the direction of the officers of the university. In accordance with the application, Assistant Blake was sent to Miuneapoiis, and marked a station near tlte university building. Clock-signals for determining the longitude of tLe point were exclianged on four nights witll the ohserrnr at Omaha. lVIr. Blake ascertained the latitude of the station at :'.\linne.apolis by obsening on ten pairs of stars during five nights. Telegraphic facilities for the work in "\nsconsin and :Minnesota were furnislwd free of charge by Z. G. Simmons, esq., president of the Northwestern Telegraph Company. All the astnmomieal records of the party have been completed in duplicate, and good progress has !Jeen made irt the computation of results. At Omaha, Assistant Goo\lfe1low was cordially assisted b;y members of the Board of Etla(iation. His report mentions also his indebtedness to ltlr. Frank I1ehmer, manager of the 'Vestern Union Telegraph Office, at Omaha, for information and for many facilities in the prosecution of the work. Mr. J. B. Baylor serve11 as aid in the astronomical party at Omaha. I1eaving the obserrnrs to com· plete the details, which were planned at the outset of the season, Assistant Dean passed ou westward to arrange for the determination of points in Colorado. The operations of lli,,; party there will be stated further on in this report, under the heading "Interior."'

1'riangulation at Galveston Harbot <ind of the coast .frnm East Bay tou·atd Sabine Pass, Te.xas.The duty of determining the position of the light-houses anll lleacons erected in Gakeston Harbor since the date of the survey, and of continuing the triangulation of the coast of Texas eastward from the head of East Ba,y, where it was suspended in 1801, was assigned to Assistant S. C. ~Ic Corkle. The surveying party reached Galvest-0n on the 7th of December, 1872, in charge of the aid, Mr. D. S. Wolcott, and a week after was joined by ::\Ir. l\foCorkle. Two of the station-marks being found, viz, Doll.((r Point and Boliva>· Point, a high tripod with its accompanying scnJfolll was erected at the latter, from which to ohsen·e on the cathedral tower, as within a few yearR a large building had bee,u put up in the eity, cutting off the ·dew of the catheMal from the ground at Bolivar Point. A new station on Pelican Island was determined in position from the two stations mentioned, and was checked by observations on the cathedral. \Vith these three the positions of the light-houses and beacons were fixed. In the beginning of February the party was transferred to the head of East Bay, where, after diligent search, three of the interior points were ide11tifie1l. The line connecting two of theRe, Oyster Bayou and Northwest Bend, (Sketch No. 13,) was adopted as a hase, and from this the triangulation was extended to the eastward as far as the season would permit. "C"nusually wet and stormy weather; the difficulty of obtaining means of transportation suitable to the character of the country and the high charges for such service in that section, all conjoined to reduce the results below the s~andard usually reached by the same allotment for party expenses. ·while Assistant Mccorkle was disabled by continued illness, tl.Je field-work was carried on efficiently by Mr. D.

Oeodetic connection.-In the interest of tlle geological survey, which is now in progress in the Territories of the U11ited States under the direction of Prof. F. V. Hayden, application was made early in the present season by James T. Gardner, esq., chief of the geographical and topographical staff~ for determinations of latitude and longitude at several points in Colorado. .As already stated in this report, similar requests were made somewhat later in the year, in behalf of surveys contemplated by the States of ·wisconsin and :l\linnesota. The position of a station in Omaha, Neb., is known hy caref11l determinations made for latitude and longitude in 18G9. By proper arrangements, therefore, one obseryer at Omaha sufficed for the exchange of clock-signals by telegraph with several observers, each at a distant station. The telegraph circuit between that place and Denver, in Colorado, about six hundred and twenty miles, was the least distance through which signals were exchanged by the parties, the circuit between Omaha and Minneapolis being about nine hundred and twenty miles. .Assistant George W. Dean, having made the requisite arrangements with telegraph companies in advance of taking the :field, organized his party so as to occupy several stations at the same time. Assistant Bdward Goodfellow was stationed at Omaha, and was there engaged from the beginning of July until the close of Se1)temher in exchanging clock-signals with observers at six distant points, the exact longitude of which had not been previously known. By Mr. Goodfellow and his aid, Mr. J.B. Baylor, an aggregate of nine hundred and twenty obsen-ations on ninety-four stars were recorded, in the course of seventeen nights, for determining the clock and iustrumental corrections· .At Denver, in Colorado, .Assistant Dean selected a point favorable for connection with l\Ir. Gardner's survey of the mountain-ranges of the Territory. The longitude of the station was established by exchanging clock.signals during four nights with the observer at Omaha, local time and instrumental corrections being found in the usual way, by observing zenith and circumpolar stars. Mr. Edwin Smith, aid in the party of .Assistant Dean, determined the latitude at Denver by observing on sixteen pairs of stars during six nights. The magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were also ascertained by full series of observations at that station. The position occupied at Dem~er by the astronomical iui-;trnments was referred by geodetie measurements to the spire of the public·school building in that city. At Colorado Springs a station was occupied, at which the summit of Pike's Peak is in fu11 view. Observations for determining longitude were made as at other places, clock-signals being exchanged during four nights with Assistant Goodfellow, wbo remained at Omaha. Eight nights were employed by the party at Colorado Springs in observing fourteen pairs of stars for latitude. The magnetic elements were determined by the usual method. At a third station, Trinidad, near the southern boundary of Colorado, observations similar to

those already mentioned were recorded for the determination of latitude, Jon?:itlHl0, allll the magnetic elements. }Ir. C. H. Fitch aided in tl1e serdce at tliis station. The report of Assistant Dean mentions renewed obligations for the friendly co-operation of General Au son Stager, superintendent of the \Yestern Union telegraph lines, in additioa to the free use of the lines accorded by the company for the exchange of tinw-signals. l\Iy thank,; are due ahm to General \Y.

All the chiefs of field-parties under my general instructions, assigning tllem to dut_y iu spee.ifi<,<1 sitPs, 11aYe hacl thf' advice of Assistant George Davidson in regard to the limits and character of their work. His intimate knowledge of the requirements of tlrn 8et'\iee on this coai'.t has aYailell alc;o, as l1eretofore, in making the most judicious suudiYision of thl' means allotte<l fol' continuing the smTcy. The progress of work 011 tbe Santa Barbara Islands and their trigonometrical connection is Yery satisfactory. ~ir. Davidsou's party is uow engaged in connecting· points on them with thu main triangulation of tLe coast of California, the scheme of which ii-; 110" com1iletc by recounais· sance from Santa Barbara to J\lontcrcy. The geodetic connection acr_oss tlie continent has not lwe11 pressed from the western side for want of means. If practicable, reconnaissanee for suitable stations ·>ill be I'esumed in the coming spring. In addition to the details of estimates for the f'en·ral parties, Assistant Dadd.son has supplie<l information verbally and in writing, to such as bani applied for data needful in important local operations. By act of Congress appro-.,ed in l\larch, 1873, the President of the United States designated three commissioners to report upon the feasibility of plans for tlle irrigation of tl1e Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Tulare Valle;\·s, two of the commissioners to be officers of the Corps of United States Engineers, and the third from the Coast Surny. Assistant DaYi<lson \rns appointed on account of his long service and faruiliarit.Y with the geographical features of the western coast, and is now engaged in the joint report ou their inwstigations. The valleys just mentioned constitute, in reality, but one great vallt·;1~ hetweeu the Sierra :St'vada range and the coast mountains, and between the thirty-fifth and forty-first degrees of latitude. Tue valley is fottr hundred and twenty miles long, bas an a\'erage width of over forty miles exclusive of the foot-hills, and is a special feature of the Pacific coast geography. l'ilr. DaYidson call8 it the -Valley of California, and, in his opinion, ten millions of acres of rich land in it admit of irrigation. The entire region and the surrounding foot-hills ha n~ been repeatedly tnn-ersed b.r the commissioners. Limited means in the appropriation did not admit of detailed olJsen~ations on the soil, water-supply, and topographical features, lJut the commissioners are strongly impr<~ssed with the apparent feasibility of rendering tbe great valley the granary of the western coast.

the exact station. The mission mentioned in the old record had occupied four positions, including that of 1769, within a stretch of five miles along the river, but there were no church records to specify the years of change. Some of the foundations were found, by personal examination. The thir<l and the fourth, or present location of the building, wel'e nearly identical. Fortunately the priest now in charg-e, an uneducated Indian, .was able to point ont the foundations of the third m ission-lmHding and the traditional positfon of the "large granary" attached to it. In tbis granary tbe French astronomer bad erected the instrument, piers of masonry, &c., !Jut all traces of piers or foundations were g·one or covered up. The relati,-e position and the limits of the granary were known to have bec>n within certain circu!llscribcd limits; aud after sifting this and other evidence, and studying the pecnliar topography of the site, Assistant Davidson became satisfied that the Venus station of 17G9 was on the southeast side of the present sacristy, and between it and the wall bordering the street. Ilis conclmiion is tbat he bas recm-ered de l' A uteroclte's position within an area of twenty feet square. The station thus identified was at once connected by triangulation with tlie Geographical Reconnail'.isance station used by J\ir. Eimbeck at San Jose del Cabo ~ fortnigbt before l\Ir. Davidson's arriYal. For this purpose a base of 3,804 feet was measured; obi;;ervations were made for time hy the sextant and for azimuth upon Polaris near elongation with theodolite No. 37. The records of this work were promptly transmitted to the office. Assistant Da1idson made diligent inquiry for the location of Dou Joaquin Velasquez de Leon's Venus station at Santa .Ana, not far from San Jose del Cabo, where the transit of 1769 was also obsen-cd; but there are no available church records, no local history or even tradition; and the government archives at Madrid and contemporary reconl8 at Paris have yielded scarcely any light upon the suuject, although Assistant Hilgard, while in Europe, joined in every effort to obtain information. During the voyage from San Francisco to San Jose del Uabo, Assistant Davidson seized every opportunit,y to obtain views of the points, capes, islands, and mountains on the coast, and made forty-two vie\VS from positions in the regular track of the steamers trading between California and Mexico.

Lowry, aid, and an efficient observatory band, to accompany the steamer Hassler and make observations for determining the lMitnde, longitude 1 and magnetic declination, at points between San Diego and Cape San Lucas, Lower California. For this purposP, Mr. Davidson obtained from the NaYy Department the use of twelve chronometers; seven were furnished from liis own stock of instrumeutsNnd the observer had the use of live belonging to the Hassler. In order to obtain a preliminary traveling rate for the chronometers, Mr. Birnbcck made observations at San I·'ran. cisco, and also at San Diego, where the work really commenced. The work along the western coast of Lower California embraced the occupation of fourteen astronomical stations, at six of which the magnetic elements were determined. The following summary exhibits the .statistics of the field-work commenced January 11, aml terminated April 7: San Francisco, 49 star-transits on 4 nights; San Diego, 50 on 3 nights; Todos SantoR Bay, 15 on 1 night, and 8 pairs of latitude-stars; San Martin's Island, 29 star-transits on 2 nights, 4 pairs of latitude-stars, ancl obserrations for magnetic declination; San Geronimo Island, 24 star-transits on 2 nights, anrl 6 pairs of latitude-stars; La Playa Maria, 15 star-transits on 1 night, and 13 pairs of latitude-stars; Lagoon Head, 14 star-transits on 1 night, 13 pairs of latitude-stars, and observations for magnetic declination; Cerros Island, 43 star-transits on 3 nights, 12 pairs of latitude-stars, and the magnetic elements ; Cape San Lucas, 13 star-transits on 1 night, and 12 pairs of latitude-stars; San Jose del Cabo 15 star-transits on 1 night, 14 pairs of latitude-sta.rs, and the magnetic elements; Magdalena Bay, 16 star-transits on 1 night, 10 pairs of latitude-stars, and the magnetic elements; Pequena Bay, 16 sta.r-transits on 1 night, and 10 pairs of latitude-stars; Abreojos Point, 13 star-transits on 1 night, and 10 pairs of latitude-stars; Ascension Island, 20 star·transits on 2 nights, 8 i)airs of latitude-stars, and magnetic declination. The instruments used were the meridian instrument N o.1, which has proved itself well adapted for such work; and the theodolite magnetometer No. 3. The stars for time were taken from

the field catalogue of 1,057 starR, prepared by Assi1;tant Davidson, with mean places reduced to 1870.0. Observations for azimuth, iu connection with the observatio11s for magnetic declination were made on the Sun's limb. The stations were all permanently marked, and full descriptions and sketches have been filed with the records. Upon the return of the 1)arty tfJ ban Francisco, observations were made for the value of tile micrometer screw of the meridian instrument, arnl for the valu.e of the "finder" level divisions, as the delicate latitude-level had been lmJken hy the blowing down of tlie porta.b1e observator;y in a lligh wind on Sau ~Iartin"s Island. During the voyage Messrs. Eimbeck and Lowry computed approximate results for the latitude and longitude. After the return of the party to San Francisco the records were duplicated and complete reductions and computations were made of all tlJe obsen·ations. Tliese results were furnisl1tl for the use of the h;rdrographic party, and gi\-c special value to tlle rcconuaissauce between San Diego and San Jose del Cabu, a stretch uf the Pacific coast known to be veQ· erroneously laid down 011 tlJe most recent I,ondon charts, and a site of disaster to several steamships· .Magnetic observations at San Diego.-In Xovember, 1872, .Assistant Davidson sent lii;; aid, :.IIr. S. R. Throckmorton, to Sitn Diego, to determine the magnetic elements at the station occupie<l liy t11e former in 1871, and to connect it with the present scheme of triangulation. The results point tfJ a much larger annual increase than had been derived from previous discussions. l\Ir. Throckmorton recorded 64 obser>ations for declination on three days; 32 for dip, with two needles; 30 for deflection; 27 for vibration. Ohsenations for time were made with the sextant; and two stations were occupied with the theodolite. Commander P. U. Johnson, -i:.::-nited States Na,·y, Assistant Coast Surrny, lef'(, :::;\an Fmndsco 011 the 15th of Januar,r, with bis h~·<lrographic party in the steamer Hassler. At San Diego, examination was commenced for the deYelopruentof such dangers to navigation as might be fount1 in the vicinity of the ordinary sailing route to Cape San Lucas. To the southward and westward of San Diego, and nearly five miles off shore, a kelp-patch was struck with ele,·en and three-quarter fathoms of water about it. Subsequently this locality was sounded, and tbe position of the kelp was marked on the cb art. Farther to the s-0uthward Todos Santos Bay was sounded by the party ; and the shore-line, erroneous there as elsewhere on charts of tte coast of Lower California, was carefully retraced, as was also t11e shore-line of Uolnctt Bay, where the steamer anchored on the night of the 2Hth of January. In passing southward, errors in shore-line~ as giYen on the clJarts, were found to be larger, the most nota~le being at San Sellastian, Yiseaino Bay, the shores of wliich were traced from the northward to a point opposite to Cerros Island. At San l\fartiu Island, where Subassistant Eimbeck was lauded, with suital.Jle instrmuents for determining its geographical position, his temporary observatory was blown away b_\· a Yiolent rainsquaU on tbe night of the 1st of February. One side of tbe observatory was thr-:nvn a hundred feet across the rocks, and all the instruments were injured. "\Yhile means were taken for repairi11gthe damage as far as possilile, soundings were made in the vicinity of the isl:tnd. The dangerous rock reported to be near the route followed by vessels was found and developed. Commander ,Johnson states that it has only 9 feet of water on it, and that its position is south 3° east (mngnetic) from the eastern end of San. Martin Island, and distant 3.2 miles. \Vhile the party was searching, it was noticed that a vessel of less than 9 feet draught had passed direcUy over the rock. Before leaving the vicinity a map was carefully made of San Martin Island and of the adjacent coast, fortyfive miles of sliore-liue being tracetl in passing from the island to Point Baja, where tbe steamer anchored on the 6th of February. The p-0sition of San Geronimo Island, as determinecl hy the observations of Suhassistant Eimbeck, decidedly differs from that given on the London published chart. In fact, certain points ma.rked on them as prominent headlands, do not exist. The intention of the party in tbe Hosslur was to determiu~ in position such as were prominent, but of those so marked none were found conformable to the actual trend of the coast. Tlle points, however, which were occupied b;r the party are well distributed; and the result~, with the large amount of corrected coast-line, will avail for the speedy correction of the general sa.iling-chart of the coast of Lower California. Near l'laza Maria, the position of which was determined by the astronomical party, the shore· line was sur-

48

veyed, and was found to differ greatly from the published outline. A point lower down, where a marked change occurs in the cllaracter of the coast, was named Lagoon Head, because of the large stretches of lagoon, which it is believed were formerly places of resort for whales. The position of the bead was determined, and lines of soundiugs were run in tlle vicinity. Several da_ys were passed in examining the waters near Cerros Island, while the part_y on shore made obsen·ations for its position and for determining the magnetic declination. Soundings were made in the passage between Natividad Island and l'oint Eugenio, in which passage a rock had been reported as ha\'ing on it only 12 feet of water. During a heavy swell the channel was carefully observed, but the swell nowhere in it revealed such a· danger. One heavy breaker was located for the chart, but the spot is much out of the channel, and is surrounded by kelp. The conclusion of Commander Johnson is that no dangers to navigation exist in this passage, exce1)t such as are well marked by kelp. Leaving Cerros Island on tile 19th of February, the Hassler was kept on the usual route, going southward and eastward. In rounding Point Abreojos, soundings very suddenly shoaled from ten and a half fathoms to only four and a half, when the anchor was let go about three-quarters of a mile from shore. The reef and shoal in that vicinity were examine~, and prO\'ed to be very extensive. Ou the way southward Paymaster Stanton, of the steamer Hassler, made a panoramic sketch of the coast, speciall,y including headlands and other landmarks, as material for engraved views to accompany the final chart of the coast of Lower California. At San Jose del Cabo Subassistant Eimbeck was landed, an<l determined the geographical position by the usual series of astronomical observations. 'l'he station was carefully marked, and by the president of the district and Eugene Gillespie, esq., United States consular agent, who visited the party on board of the Hassler, assurauces were giYen to Commander Johnson that care would be taken to preserve the stationmarks for any future purpose. In turning northward from Cape San Lncas, no point on the coast was found suitable for landing tl.Je astronomer short of :Magdalena Bay. Uuder fayorable circumstances, landing was possible at Todos Santos River, but greater uncertainty attended re-embarkation; hence the first station occupied in tlte upward passage was at l\Iagdalena, where John Ricketson, esq., resident there for several years, kindly put up a durable monument to mark the astronomical station. "\Vhile the observations were in progreRs, Lieutenant Mansfield, of the hydrographic party, carefully examined the offing at Cape He<lenda, and found that a rock said to be outsiue of the ten-fathom curve has no existence, the position of rocks inside of the ten-fat.horn curve having been probably miajndged by passing vessels. Continuing northward, a station was occupied at Pequeila Bay, and from that bay to .A.breojos Point the published erroneous sl10rn-line was corrected. .A.t Cerros Island the vessel stopped to test the run of the chronometers, after whicll the steamer passed on to San Diego. About five thousand soundings were made and recorded in the course of the reconnaissance. The shore-line suneys made by the party are comprised on five sheets. Off Point Loma search was made for a rock said to be only nine feet under water, but no rock was found. Near Point Fermin, a rock reported by Captain Parker, of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, was found and determined in position by the party in the steamer Hassler. This rock has seven feet of water on it. The vessel reached San Francisco on the 6th of April, and, needing repairs, was refitted for service on the northern part of the coast of California, as will l>e mentioned under another head. Oornmamler Johnson ii; now couducting hydrographic operations in the Santa Barbara Channel, assisted by Lieut. Commander C. W. Kennedy, U.S. N., and Lieutenants H.B. Mansfield, E. \V. Remey, George vV. Tyler, and J. D. Adams, U.S. N. Lieutenant M. S. Day, who joined the steamer Hassler in 1871, was detaclled from Uoast-Survey service in May last. San Diego Bay.-In November and December Mr. S. R. Throckmorton, of Assistant Davidson's party, determined the positions of the buoys which mark the entrance and approaches to San Diego Bay. By previous understanding with the local officers of the Light-House Board, as in all similar cases, the buoys, when found in their intended positions, are at once marked on the chart.

Before leaving the fielll for the North, Assistant Chase added to his prHious phuw-tahle sheet of ""ilmington the improvements in that Yicinity; the progress of the breakwater or jetty ; d1anges in the shore-line of Uattles11ake Islaml adj;went, arn1 the chauges of the low-water line; all making a Yery interesting stnd,z. In his revort he acknowledges the effecti rn aid rrmlere<l hy )lr. C. Uhlig. In l\fay, Assistant Cbase transferred his party to a :.;ite of work alJ<ffe Crescent City, mention of whlch will l.Je made under the head of Section XI. Triangulation and topography of Catalina Harbm·.-In April, Ao;sistant Chase we11t with bis party to Catalina Island and completed tlrn topographical survey of the harbor anu its approaches from the north and sonth sitles of the isthmus. The map represents ele-zations of 1,'.200 i~t, with high, rocky, and precipitous shore-line; and embraces an area of two and a half square miles an<l four miles of coast-line. l\Ir. Chase discovered and located a dangerous sunken rock, haYiug ouly four feet of water upon it at low-water, and lying about a mile to the westward or tbe north haruor. At the request of Assistant Davidson be also examined a peak of 1:730 feet elevation west of the isthmus, with reference to the pracJ,icability of occupying it as a station to connec~ with the main scheme of coast-triangulation. Hydrograpliy of New River and Anaheim .Ri1711r, Califoruia.-The bars to these river», which empty into the 8anta Barbara channel, on the eastern side of San Pedro l3a~", are crossed hy boat,.; and lighters in the transfer of passengers and freight. They were examined by Assistant Chase in April, and the depth was found to be inconsiderable; in fact, less than two feet at low 'Yater. Thu positions of the bars are conRtantly changing, and they are only crosse<l at high water. 'f!H' approaches to the entrances were developed, and in this work sixteen miles were run in the boat, and 993 soundings were made, and adjusted b~· 36 angles, measured for poi'iition. :illr. Chase wa--; aided in this work by J'tfr. C. Uhlig. Triangulation and topography of Santa Rosa and adjacent islmuls.-Subassistant Stehmau Forney remained in the field during the autumn, winter, and spring, engaged in the topograpl1ical survey of' Sau ta Rosa island, and in completing the connection of the islands of San .:\Iiguel, Santa Uosa, and Santa Cruz by triangulation. The topography of the islands is executed upOJJ a Reale of 'lfcr8-oo· and detailed work is carried inland the usual distance; but, for the benefit of naYigators approaclJiug the coast, the interior topograpl1y of f,hc islaml, embracing all the peaks, Jias been generalized.

Assistant Greenwell mapped in the wharYes at Santa Barbara, San Buenaventura, and Goleta; and also survcJ·ed the vicinity of the new town at Point Hueneme. Subassistant Eugene Ellicott was attached to his party. The field-report of Assistant Davidson acknowledges the aid rendered to his reconnaissance party lly Mr. Green well. Reconnaissance for main triangulation below Monterey, California.-After November, 1872, Assistant Davidson's party was engaged during several months, under charge of Subassistant Eimbeck, in reconnaissance for main triangulation to join the survey of Santa Barbara channel with that of l\Ionterey Bay. The country travers~d is marked at the sonth by mountain-ranges parallel with the coast of Santa Barbara channel, aud reaching four thousand feet elevation. At the middle, just south of Sau Luis Obispo, the range is broken by irregular and interfering chains of mount. ains, nearly four thousand feet high. At the north are bold, high chains of mountains, parallel with the coast south of Monterey, and separated by the valley of the Salinas which runs to the north· west. Toward Point Pioos the western range, Sierra Santa Lucia, is bold, covered with chapparal, destitute of trails, and attains an elevation of 6,200 feet. The plan of examination had been thoroughly explained by Assistant Da\'idson, and the scheme presented by Mr. Eimbeck, after a reconsideration of detail near Santa Anna Mountain, and at Gaviota by himself and Subassistant 0. H. Tittman, and at Point Pinos by Mr. Throckmorton, aid, is very satisfactory. It embraces a full series of well-conditioned quadrilaterals, except where the mountain-chains interfere near San J_,uis Obispo. This series has been further developed by .Assistant Davidson to the line Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz west; and connected with stations on the Santa Barbara Isl1mcls by a system of good secondary triangulation. Soon after Subassistant Tittrnan reported for duty on the western coast, he took the field with the main triangulation party. At the date of Assistant Davidson's report Mr. Tittman was observing at a station on San Miguel Island, and observations for latitude and azimuth were in progress. Ile is aided by Messrs. W. S.

Assif;tant Da\'idson, determined the magnetic elements in December, 1872, at El Coxo, near Point Conception. For decliriation, 82 obsern1tio11s were recorded on 3 days; 3~ for dip, with two needles; 30 for deflections; 27 sets of V'ibrations; two sets of sextant obserrations for time, and IG obserYa: tions on Polaris for azimuth. Assistant Davidson reports that the rmmlts for yearly change con13.rm those found for the San Diego station. Triangulation and topography tiear San Luis Bay, Califoruia.-Dul'ing the winter Assistant L.A. Sengteller was engaged in inking and tracing his topographical sheets, computing the triangle sides, and dulllicating records. Ile has within the year transmitted to the Ofliee t.went.r-oup \-olumes of original records and computatious, and th~ topographical sheet of Lis surn·;- north of Point Arena. In January, Mr. Sengteller transferred his party to San Luis Ol1ispo Ilay and resumed work to the southwarrl of the predous season's limits. The triangulation l'as eulargrd and de,doped to the Arroyo Grande, and the topography was exteuded from South J>oint in San l1uis Bayt{} a point beyond the Arroyo Grande. The topographical fCatnres of tht:' country are yaried. As !'('presented by the sheet, the westeru part is high, rolling laud, witli bluff shore-lint:', cut. by nmnt:'rous gulches; thence to the eastward runs a Jong line of saml-beach bad;:ed ll;r saml-uuues, which become covered with cliapparal and scrub-oak as tht·y recede from th shorP. Before closi11g operations for the season a survey was made of tlie Yiciuit.' of B:ireliill stat iou from the i'iea-facf! to the summit of the mountain.

.Assistant Hockwell was ai<lell in this section b,y ::\Ir. George H. \Vilsou, who. is commended for zealous and efficient services in the fielll and in computation. At the close of the summer season, this party was transferred to the Columbia River, as will be mentioned under Section XI. Lmigitude obserrations, San Francisco, California.-For determining the difference of longitude between San Francisco and Kalama, on the Columbia River, Oregon, Assistant Davidson occupied the astronomical station in \Yashington Square, San Francisco. I'he station at Kalama was occupied h.Y Sub-Assistant Eimbeck, whose operations will be noticed further on in this report. Tlie instruments used in this sen-ice were the Kessel clock, 1449; Hipp chronograph, 37LJ3 ; ancl transit No. 3. 'fhe manager of the Western Union Telegraph Company gave the use of the line free of cliargc, at the request. of Mr. Davidson. Uuusuall.Y fogg_y weather delayed the requisite astronomical ob;;ervations, but they were completed by the 1st of October. Clock-signals were transmitted each way during six nights, and simultaneous time-observations were recorded. For instrumental and clock corrections Mr. Davidso11 reconlec1, during fourteen nights, 206 transits of 78 stars, over twenty-five threads, filling thirty. nine chronograph sheets. Observations for personal equation were made after Mr. Eimbeck's return from Kalama. To as8ist obserycrs in placing the transit instrument approximately in the plane of the meridian at any time, A8sistant Davidson completed a table of the azimuth and apparent altitutle of the Pole star at stations between latitude 30° and latitude 60° for each nfteen minutes of hour angle. This table has been printecl for generul tlistribution to observers. 1lfagnetic obser1,ations at San Fra.noisco.-In 1852, Assistant Davidson ueterminecl the magnetic elcmcnt:;i at tlle astronomical station, Presidio, near San Francisco. Under his direction, Mr. Tllrockmorton repeated the series of observations which had been renewed in December, 1871, an<l recorded 7l observations for <leclination on 3 days in October, 1872; 80 on 3 days in June, 1873; fi7 on 3 clays in Jnly, 1873; 86 on 5 days in August, 1873. The results of the field-computation indicate, as do those at all other stations on the western coast, that the annual increase of the magnetic declination has been about 2'.5 since 1850 ; and they are especially interesting as showing that the maximum easterly declination is nearly, if not quite, attained. Topograplty of Table Jlou.ntain, 8an Francisco entrance.-After completing his office.work of the preceding season, Assistant A. F. Rodgers resumed field-work as early as practicable in the spring, and complet<id the detailed suryey of Table Mountain, including its two principal peaks, the alti· tudc of which was found to be twenty-six hundred feet.

Tliis mountain, on the north side of the Golden Gate, is one of the notable lan11-marks for vessels approaching San Francisco Bar. As it presents from different points varied peculiarities, the flanking-spurs were represented o:i the plane-table sheet by Mr. Rodgers. The sides of the mountain are extremely rocky, vrith strongly-marker! gulches. This survey, which w-as completed in April, includes an area. of seventeen square miles. The suhsequeut operations of tlrn party of Assistant Rodgers will be mentioned under another head. Sand-dunes of San Fra.ncisoo Peninsula.-In order to secure means for noting tlte progress of the saud-dunes in their encroachment upon the peninsula of San Francisco, especially those now advancing toward the city of San Francisco, Assistant Rodgers, who had made the 01·iginal topographical survey, retraced the present outline of this great sand-drift, planted a num her of properly marked stone-blocks in advance of its outline, and determined their rclati"ve positions. .Annual or biennial examinations will henceforth be made to measure the rate of tra,·el of the sand. drift. In this work, Assistant Rodgers was aided by Mr. E. F. Dickins. The sand.dunes are represented on a plane-table sheet oftbe scale used in the Coast Survey. Hydrogra1Jk'!J of Sm~ Francisco Bay and approaches.-In the latter part of January, throughout February, and (}ur]ng parts of April and .May, Assistant Gershom Bradford was engaged iu noting the surface aml subsurface currents of the water in San Francisco Bay. The observations at eacll station .were made mght and day for a given period, and the times and stations are well connected. This work includes also a series of observations in regard to the currents on and around South ampton shoal. Of the following particulars, most have been plotted in graphical form, and the sheet exhibits ver;\· marked peculiarities in hydrograpby.

Tliis wreck had become a serious danger to navigation. After its separation into two p<irts, 011e wa:traced and was found to be harmless in deep water ; the other was found by the aid, l\fr ..Fer11inand Westdahl, on the Four-fathom bank, near where tlie vessel had been run to save her from sinking. The exact position of the part of the wrnck wliich is dangerous was lletermined aml made known, for the benefit of navigators. In the operations needful, Assistant Bradford with bis party, in the schooner JJ!arcy, had also the use of the steam-tug Sol Thmnas, which co-operated for the service without charge; and of the United States revenue-cutter Wyanaa. In June, the 11yd1·0graphic party was transforre<l to the Yiciuity of Rumboldt Bay: for off.shore work, mention of which will be made under a subsequent head. In August, the schooner Marcy being unseaworthy, Assistant Bradford was directed to charter a tug and make a detailed surrn.r of the approach('S, the bar, and the Golden Gate of San Francisco Bay. Tliis work was begun on the 7th of October, after the erection and determination of a sufficient nnmucr of signals for such service, and is well under way. Enough has b.een done to indicate that important changes ham probably taken place, alJ(l that the labor and care bestowed make this survey invaluable as a basis for future comparisons. At the date of Mr. Bradford's last report the weather continued favorable for soundings anJ. for observing currents umler apparently normal conditions.

The gauge at Fort Point, near San Francisco, has worked remarkably well in the hands of the observer, 1\Ir, E. Gray, who lrns

also continued tbe series of meteorological observations. Both sets of observations have been regularly tabulated by the observer. }i'or suggestions of special value in regard to the tidal stations on the Pacific coast I am indebted also to Assistant George Da,idson, whose recommendations have been met by the able co-operation of Colonel Mendell. Hydrogmplty of Cordell Banl.:.-In ~fay Assistant Bradford was directed to extend soundings in tbe vicinity of this bank, but, on account of bis illness, the duty devolved upon his aid, Mr.·· 'Vestdalil, who conducted the work in the schooner itl.arcy. Good weather during part of the time served for determining the position of the bank, by observing mountain signals of the main triangulation, and by subsequent sounllings the bank was developed beyond the limits of former work. Bad weather, however, set in before the completion of all the soundings deemed needful in that vicinity. The temperature of the water and the currents were incidentally noted, while the party was on the hank. Al>uut tbe middle of ,June Ia:st, the mean temperature of the water was 490 Fahrenheit. ]Falmouth Shoal.-Tbe site of a reported shoal in the Pacific, bPtwecn the parallels 37° 15 1 and 370 38' north, and between the meridians 1370 05' and 1380 10' west, has been again examined, bat without finding any spot corresponding to that reported by the ship Falmouth several years ago. Commander Johnson, with the steamer Hassler, made 109 casts of the lead in the vicinity, but without finding bottom in 2,400 fathoms. In reference to the results of his examination, that officer says : "Lookouts were constantly aloft, but no indication of shoal water could be discovered. 'Ve frequently saw discolored water, caused by the shadow of a cloud. While on- the ground we sighted, ran alongside of, and examined a saw-log of Oregon pine, squared at each end as for the saw-mill. The log, about twenty-five feet long, and more than two foet in diameter, was thickly covered with barnacles and mussels, exce11t at the surface, and tlie influence which brought the log would naturally bring kelp to that same locality." The steamer ran fourteen hundred miles during this examination, which was commenced on the 2Uh of l\Iay and occupied the bydrographic party until the middle of June. Triangulation and to1wgraplty north of JJfendocino Bay.-After quitting the field near San Luis Obispo Bay, as stated under tbe preceding lrnad, Assistant Louis A. SengteHer completed tile office details pertaining to that survey, and transferred his party to the vicinity of Mendocino Bay, to resume the topography and tria!)gulation from the northern limits of his previous work. The shores of this part of the coast of California are moderately high bluffs bordered by innumerable rock::;, From the flanks of the adjacent mountains the timber comes well down toward the shore-line, and adds to the difficnlty of pushing triangulation along the ocean front. To avoid expense in 01>enillg lines, one of the station::; occupied hy Mr. Sengteller with the theodolite was upon a. tree 103 feet abo,-e the ground. After determining a sufficient number of points tlie plane-table survey was extculle<l along tile coast from Russian Gulch to Pudding Creek, or several miles abo'e the mouth of Noyo River. Tuis survey includes the light-house site at Point Oabrillo, aml the Im1diug-places at Caspar Creek and Noyo Rh'er, at each of which, saw.mills now· cut a <la.ily average of thirty thousand feet of lumber. The landings afford tolerable shelter for vessels from the prevailing winds of summer, but are uncertaiu in winter, and in that season are unsafe. After extending the topographical survey as far as practicable, l\fr. Seugteller, aicled by Mr. Willey, pushed a tertiary triangulation to connect his work with that of Assistant Rodgers, whose party was employed to the north ward. Both parties were yet Jn the field when the last reports from the section were received.

Triccngulation and topography between Koyo RiDer mul Shelter Gore, Gal[!<iniia.-.\.s mentioned under a preceding head, .Assistant A. F. Uodgers completed his offiee-work in the course of the winter of 1872, aud early in the following spring took the field in the viciHity of Sau Francisco. In July, he transferred llis part.r to the coast of California, north of .Xoyo l~h"er entrance, and resumed work where his operations had lJeeu elosed in the prt>ceding season. The reg-ion is wild, almost uninhabited, and destitute of roads. }fountain spurs, high, broken, and abrupt, covered with iH'a\"Y timber and dense chapparal, came down boldly to the shore of the ocPa11. Ad vancc in any direction on laud was difficult, and the natural oustacles to progress were increased during the summer by prevailing fogs. ~i\s antumn approached the weather became more fwvorable. Assistant Hod;;ers pushed the 11eedful triangulation, while his aid, :\Ir. E. F. Dickins, workecl with the plane.table. The party, when the last report was reccivetl, was yet in the field, ~fr.

The three plane-table sheets no.w with the party represent twent,y-fonr miles of the coast of the Pacific, and in detail an area of 13 square miles. Off-s7wre ltydrography near Humboldt Bay.-In December, 187:?, while the schooner Jlarcy was nuder repairs, Assistm1t .Bradford dispatched his aid, J\Ir. 'Yestdahl, to watch in hca\·.Y weatlier. and determine the position of any undiscovere1l rocks off Cltpe J\Iendocino. In the conrse of a month he discovered five dangerous rock,;, and saw the great swell of the Pacific breaking in two localities over lal'ge areas of ground on which snbseq1rnnt soundings showed from !J to 10 fathoms of water. Ile made 164 observations for the positions of ten sunken rocks, whid1 had been indicated by sharp, distinct breakers. Late in June the party sailed in the Yessel for Humboldt Bay to prosecute the offshore hydrography; but after the requisite operations on shore, the schooner was found to be unseaworthy, and returned to San Francisco in the midc1le of August. Before leaving Humboldt Bay, Assistant Bradford had erected twent.y-one siguals, and occupied five stations for conducting the off-shore hydrography. The work done after the return of the party to San Francisco has already been mentioned. Hyd1·ography o:tf Creseeiit Oit;y, Cal~fornia.-The steamer Hassler, with the hydrographic party of Commander P.C.Jobnson, United St~es Navr,Assistant in the Coast Snrvey,reaeh~d Crescent City early in July. Fogs and winds much interrupted progress in the souncliugs intended to be made in the vicinity. It was found, consequently, impracticable to run lines off shore to tleep water, the needful signals being usually invisil>le when the vessel was only a mile or two from land. The reef off' Crescent City was, however, thoroughly developed, and additional soundings were rna(le in its vicinity. Tidal observations were recorded at Crescent Gity until tlle end of Septeml>el', when tlJe steamer returned to San Francisco. Under the head of Section XI, mention will be made of other surveys made by Commander Johnson. Reconnaissance and triangulation from Rocky Point to Klama.th Rfoer.-Late in the season, Assistant A. ,V, Chase transferred his party from the vieinity of Cape Sebastian, in Section Xf, to the Klamath River, and made a reconnaissance and preliminary tr·iangulation along the coast of California from the False Klamath to Rocky Point, north of Trinidad Bay, incidentallJr sketching iu the shore-line and approximately locating the rocks along the coast. The shores traversed hy his party being high, and covered with heavy timber from the mountaiu-cr~sts inland, afford ·"ca11ty means of carrying on the tertiary triangulation. l\Ir. Chase, howeYer, found that a satisfactory trigonometrical connection can be effected between the Crescent City survey aml the work on flnmboldt Bay. Iu this reconnaissance, 725 preliminary angles were measured from the selected sta-

Aids to navigation.-In the course of the year Assistant Davidson has communicated for the information of the Light-House Board hhi views upon the best sites for light-houses and other aids to navigation on the western coast. His rec_ommendations have includetl the erection of a lighthouse at Point Cabrillo, and of' others in Admiralty Inlet, Prrget Sound, and Hood's Canal, in the order of time in which the necessities of commerce may reqrrire them; a fog-whistle abreast of the son them limit of the bar of San Francisco Bay; a buoy to mark the wreck of the ship Patrician on the Four.fathom bank, near the Golden Gate; and a fog-whistle at the entrance to Humboldt Bay. Snbassistant George Farquhar has been employed, nnder the di'rection of .Assistant Davidson, in making projections for the geographical reconnaissance of the western coast of I1ower California, and pr~jections for the inshore and offshore hydrography of the coast north and sonth of Crescent City reef. On these were plotted about two hundred trigonometrical points, ttw positions of which had been determined by field observations. He has also duplicate1l the numerous coast-views obtained by Mr. Davidson, exclusive of nearly one hundred views of points on the coast of Lower California and of the eastern shores of the Gulf of California kindly lent by Capt. William Metzgar. . Of Scanunon's Lagoon and others on the coast of Lower California, of which maps, with sailing directions, have been completed by Capt. C. M. Scammon, of the United States lfovenue l\farine, copies were made by Mr. Farquhar and filed in the archives. He has furnh;hed the numerous tracings required in the operations of the field and hydrographic parties, and, under the inspection of Mr. Davidson, compiled data for the study of the great warm stream of the Pacific which passes the coast of Japan.

Tria.n9ulatinn and t-Opograplty between M<wk's Arch and Rogue River, Oregon.-After closing at San Pedro Bay in Section X, Assistant .A. W. Chase was engaged for a. month ju computations and other office-duty per$aining to his previous field-work. He took the field in July in the vicinity of Mack's Arch, and erected signals for a scheme of triangulation turning on North west rock of the Crescent City Reef; but bad weather prevented observations with the theodolite. Tbis part of the season was employed in pointing out the localities of the stations of previous years for the use of Commander Johnson, chief of the hydrograpbic party. The tertiary triangulation was subsequently extended from Crook's Point to Cape Sebastian, and from thence Mr. Chase made a reconnaissance to lwgue River. This work was conducted over one of the roughest stretches of the coast of Oregon. Tbe region is sparsely settled and without-roads. The following are statistics of the triangulation:

Hydrogrttphy of Hunter's Cove and Ohttko enfrll)we, Ore1;mi.-An anchorage, with good shelter for small coasting-·essels, under Uape Sebastian, and of which the shore-liue was traced thi!'l season, as already mentioned, was crncfnll.l" sonm1e<l out by tltc h_v!lrographic party of ClJmmamlt>r Johnson, with the steamer Hassler. This anchorage is locally known :is Hunter's Con>, Schooners can anchor safely nntler the l<'e of the island dmfog stiff southeast winds. Of Chetko CO\·e, which was also tll'Yeloperl hy sou11tlings, Oornmamler .Jolrn,;m1 reports: "This iS an excellent snmrner anchorage; eYen preferable to that at Crescent City, in caRc of a southeast win!l, as there is more room fo1· a sailing-vesP-el to work." vVhile soundings were in pmgrnss in the yicinity, sinrnltaneotts obserYations for high and low water were recorded from July 17 until An;!!·nst ~;; at Hunter',; Coye and Chetko entrance. Latitude, longitur7e, mu] 11zi111nlh at K11l111na, Ori'f/1!11.-Iu Augnst, Assii-it:rnt G(~orge Dal"idson detached Snbassistant \Yillia111 Eimbeck a!Hl l\Ir. T. ,J. I,owry from his party to occt~p.r a station at Kalama, on the Colmnbia Ith·er, for the <leterminatio11 of longitude. As alrea1ly stated, '.\fr. Davidson rcm:iined at 8an Francisco and exchanged signals by teh·graph. The triangulation of t,he Columbia RiYer includes the astronomical station of 18;">1 at Cape Disappointment, and i;;i also connected '.Vith the snrYey of Shoal water Ba~·. As heretl)fore, tlie \Yestern Union Tt>lf'grapl1 Company accorded the free use of their line-s for this sen·ice. Tlie seasrm waR favorable for work on the Columbia, bnt continuous fogs preYailed at San Franci:'!co, 80 that on Rfweral nights when clock-signals were transmitte1l, one obsen-ei· or the other was unable to make ohser.-ations for time. At Kalama, transits were obHer\'e!l upon 18 night><, an!l signals were transmitted on G uig·hts, when time obsen-ations were complete. The whole number of transits was 37t, npou 30 st:ll's, with the Daddson meridian instrument No. 1. The registry was made on the Hipp field-chronograph No. 4848, with the Frodsham break-circuit chrononwt.er No. 3479. Afrer completing these, observations were commeuce<l for latitude with zenith telescope :i:-ro. 1, and contiuue(l for 10 nights. Tlie total number of obser>at.ious was l;);:>, upon .30 pairs and triplets. The reduction of this work is now in progress. Azimntlt observations wer·' completed in 6 nights, the record showing 120 measures for angle between the mark and Polaris, near eastern elongation, with the twelve-incl1 theodolite No. 37, and 92 obseffations for time with the sextant.

Triangulation of the Oolumbia- Rirff.-ln ::\fay, Assistrwt Cle\'elan(l Hockwell transferre<l hi8 party from the sonthern coast of California to the Columbia Hin~r to continne the work of pre\·ions seasons. As it was important to aclJust the sU1T1·y of the Columbia h,Y obser\"ing at a }lOint for longitude, instead of continuing the topography of the ri Yer shores, the triangulation was 11ushed forward from 1-Vestport to Kalama a distance of 32 miles. At the last-name(l point the Northern Pacific Railroad leaves the Columbia Ri\·er and pas$es northward towrtrtl Puget Sound. The valley of the Columbia is heaYil.f wooded, and progress through it is impeded by a dense uuder· growth. The old limits of the river are steep, roeky, ba8altic banks, heaYily timbere1l, wherever trees can find room. "\Vithin the original banks lie extensiw timbered flats, and broa<l marshes everywhere cnt up by sloughs. A boat furnished the only means of transportation for the party, and the work was consequently very laborious, especially when the freshets of Jtme were rmming. In making the reconnaissance amt reaching tlie stations, the only prnctical1le route was through sloughs. Lines of sigltt had to be openell from each station, and e·ery forward line was studied under great disadvantages; bnt tbe sketch of the triangulation exliibits a satisfactory scheme, and the progress made is evidence of s1lecia,J energy in the service. On the Columbia the weather ~as favorab1e, and only a few days were lost by reason of the prolonged smoky season. The followmg are statistics of the work :

After connecting his triangulation with the point occupied by Snba&sistant Eimbeck, at Kalama, for determining longitude, Assistant Uockwell returned to San Francisco, and is again engaged on the southern coast of California. He was aided in both sections by Mr. Geo. H. Wilson. Jllagnetic obserl'f1tions at Gape D'is(/ppointment, Washington.-After closing tile serdce mentioned under a preceding bead, Subassistant Eimbeck and Mr. Lowry occupied the two magnetic stations at Cape Disappointment, where Assistaut D:widson had determined the mag·netic elements in 1851. The records of this season include 332 observations upon 9 da:rs for declination; 125 observations' for deflection; 100 for vibration; and 2!8 obscrvatiolls for <lip, with two needles. The azimuth was determined by 41 observations on the sun, and the local time by 72 double altitudes with the sex. tant. From Cape Disappointment the party returned to San Franciseo aud engaged iu the compn· tations. Triangulation and topography of Slwalwater Bay, lra.sltington.-Subassistnnt J. J. Gilbert, after inking aud tracing his topograpllical sheets and reviewing the field-computations of his triangulation of the coai.-;t of Washington Territor.r, took the field in .April, an<l prosecuted work in Sboalwater Bay southward to connect with the survey of Columbia Rh·er: Jn order to do this, it was necessary to open nine avenues for lines of sight through dense fir fore;;ts, that cover the hills and low ground. The labor was great, but is repaid by the satisfactory junction of the two surveys. Both are uow in kuown geographical relation by determinations made this season for the longitude of a station at Kalama, on the Columbia Uiver.

The excellent series of' tidal and meteorological olisen·ations made at Astoria ban~ been continued by l\fr. I1. Wilson, under the supen·ision of Major G. H. Mendell, of the Corps of Engineers, BYt. Col. U. S. A., who has ably carried out the plans furnisMd from the Office. The tabulations of high and low waters and the hourly r{'adings are now made by the observer. The self.registering gauge formerly used at San Diego has been put up at Port Townshend by Assistant Lawson, and is now working regularly. Mr. Wilsou left .Astoria for a few days to assist Mr. Lawson in this work and to instruct the observer, Mr. L. Nessel, who also tabulates the tidal registers and keeps up a series of meteorological observations. Triangulatfon and t(pography of Puget Sound, Wa.sltington.-During the winter of 1872, Assistant James S. Lawson was eugage<l in computing the results of bis field-observations of the previous year, and in iuking and tracing the topographical sheets, duplicating records of observations, and making projections for work during the present season. Early in the spring he took the field for the triangulation, topography, and bydrography of Budd's Inlet and its approaches. The work includes the town of Tumwater, at the extreme southern end of Puget Sound, the t-Own of Olympia, and the village of Swantown.

An outline of tl1e operations of the season will !Jc found in the appen<led extracts from l1is report. ""itll tbe schoouer l"ukon, which hatl been fitted out under his immf'diate snp0rdsio11, Mr. Dall left Sa.n Francisco on the 28th of April, and reached Hiuliuk on the 20th of )fa,\", making the shortest run yet knmn1 between the two poi11t8. Ou the ,-oyagc very hea\·y w<·atl1er mis encour1terecl, lasting uearly a week, and a calm which lasted three days. ·"'Ne made land when sm·cnkcn days out near the Sannakh reeft1, ancl during the calm disco,·ered a bank Ising some distance off shore ~ith thirty-eight fathoms of water au<l gr~n-ells bottom. Here we found c0l1 and lrnli\.mt of large size and good qnalitj· in great a1Jum1a11ce. \Ye ohtainell a good series of obser>ations, fixing the position, and approximately l1etermiuing the soutl1er11 and eastern limits of the Saunakh reefs. '\Yithiu the limits of the bank, arnl b<.:tween it and the shore, we found depths of 75 to 100 fathoms.'' Mr. Dall remarks that this slwal ground iu respect of distance from the nenrest laud corresponds with several other banks already known; in particular one uff the sonthern e111l of Kadiak; another disco\·ereu by Assistant Davidson in 1867 off Unimak; aud a third, known as the ''offshore ground'' of the Shumagin fishermen; and from this correspondenre at four places he infers the existence of a submarine ridge running par<:Lllel with the peninsula, from Unimak eastward. "Current observations were kept up during the voyage, the results tending to confirm the obe:en'ations of previous years." * * * * * " "The past winter in this rt>gion, as in the eastern United States, has been 011e of m1mmal se...-erit.y; and the season was fully a month later than the average. Ficlc1-icc on tho 20th of 111ay in Behring Sea reached to within 130 miles of Unalaska, and was from 10 to 40 feet in l1eigbt abo,·e the water. This has not been paralleled since 1831, according to local tradition and the church · · * · · · recordB." "' "After rating our chronometers, we 11ailed from Uualaska for the '\Vestern Islandi>, and visited in the course of the summer nearly all the harbors previously known. A new and exrellent one was discovered at the island of Ada.kb.

tober, the rukon was held by three anchors in Humboldt harbor, which had been surveyed by the party last year, butt.lie sehoo11er lrilliani Whelan was driven ashore and totally wrecked at Unga, twelYe miles to the southward. Ou recei1it of a note which Uaptaiu Holder had sent by a native, Assistant Dall promptly weut to the site of the disaster and brought the captain and crew of the wrecked vessel, on the schooner Tt1kon, to San l<'rancisco. In adyauce of sailing for Alaska the attentiou of Mr. Dall bad heeu re!1uested for the selection of a site proper for landing a telegrapli-cable intended to trarnrse the Northern Pacific. This ser»ice liis large experience in tlte operatious of the \Yestem U uion Telegraph Oompan;y in previous years enabled him to perform to me satisfaction of the agents of the enterprise. A site was chosen for a telegraph-station on the island of Kyska, and the haruor and its vicinity were carefully sun·eyed. " \Ve outahwd o\·er a tl1uusa11d astronomical ousen·atiuns duriug t11e season, and nearly as many fcJl' magnetic elements. The latter show au aYerage decrease iu the declination of more than two degrees at most of the stations, since obsernltions were last tak~n, more tbau twenty ;rears ago. Our stations are at uearly even dh;tances from the ShL11nagins to tl.te western end of tlle cllain." ''Deep-sea soundings were made wherenlf opportunity offered, and mueh g-reater depths were found than auy predousl,Y reported in Behring· Sea. \Ve found, too, the deposition of Globigerina mud, or recent chalk-formation, going on at the depth of 800 fathoms.'' Soundings made by the party in the Yukon disprove the existence of tLe Bogosloff reef, which 11as been marked on previous general chart,,; as exte11di11g for twenty miles from Vnimak. "\Ye _found 800 fathoms aud no bottom on the exact line of the, supposed reef less than t(m miles from the islaml." The re110rt of l\lr. Dall includes special meution of the energy, interest, aud competeuc,y displayed uy l\Ir, Marcus Baker, the astronomical ai(l iu the party, who lost no opportuuity for securiug 1·esults. Much of tlte season was pas;;ed amid rains and fogs, but a large store of important hydrographic particulars has been gathered, and the positions of most of the prominent yolcanic 1>eaks were determined approximatel.r, as landmarks for chart8. The schooner rukon arriYed at San Prancisco on the Gth of Nonm1her, after a passage of eighteen daye, from the Sbumagin Islauds. Assistant Dall and uis aid, l\fr. Baker, are now engaged in the computations and other office tlet.ail8 pertaining to the operations of the present year on the coast of Alaska. The report wade by Mr. D.:ill, after ltis return to San Frnncisco, is gi ,·en in the Appendix, No. 11. .. Tidal observations.-The self-registering gauge intendetl to secure a series of obserrntions at Saiut Paul's Island, in Behring Sea, arrived there in April, l 872, but unfortunately the fastenings of the clock-face ball given way in the transit, and thus some parts of tLe apparatus had been injured. Oapt. Charles Bryant, to whom the instrument was consigned, repaired the clock ae far as possible in the absence of ordinary facilities, and put tlte tide-gauge into working order at Village Cove, Oil the western side of the island, wbere it was fastened to a mill of timber filled with stone. A bench-mark was estaLlished on a rock near Hie crib. \Vitb occasional stoppages, owing to the injury which the clock bad received Oil its passage, the times arid _heights of the tide were recorded daring June, J uJ~·, antl August of 1872. After that the record was more freq nently interrupted by defect in the moving apparatus, and Captain Bryaut, who had done the utmost to preserve continuity of the record, was coustrained to remove the instmment in the middle of December. Soon afterward tlie northern drift-ice from Behring Sea, swe11t iu l>y south west winds, filled the cove, aucl in loosening with the approacL of spring carried awa.y the crib which had been constructed to sustain the tide-gauge. The reconls for six mouths, of which the last three are marked by numerous interruptions, have been received at the office. COAST SURVEY OFFICE. The operations of the Coast Sun-ey Office have been conducted, as for many years past, by Assistant J.E. Hilgard, who reimmed their immediate direction upon his return from Europe at the b:-ginuing of November, relieying Assistant 0. S. l'eirce from temporary charge of the Office.

The organization of the different dfrisions of the Office has remained urieltauged. The following statement gives a succinct account of their operations during the past ,year, wllich ha Ye fally kept pace with the ad\'ance of the field-work. Hydrograpkic d-ivision.-Tbe planning and Yerifying tl!e work of sounding-1>artin; is under the immediate direction of Capt. C. P. Patterson, inspector of hydrography, who also has charge of the construction, repairs, and disposition of the ,-essels belonging to tl!e Coast Survey sen-ice. The office-work under his. direction, consisting of plotting and drawing of hydrographic cllarts from the field-records, has been performed by Mr. E. "\Villt:nbibher, the principal h.nlrogra11hic draughtsman, who has also verified all rednced llrawings of l!yllrogrnp::.y, and has prepareu all notes relating to lights, buoys, and sailing-llireetions for the pulilished charts. In drawing the charts from original notes, he was assisted by Mr. J. Spramlal. Computing dit'ision.-The computing di,~isiou of the Office has been contiuued in charge of Assistant Charles .A. 15chott, with the same general org;mization as in preceding years. The special duties assigned to the computers may Ile stated, in general, to have IJeeu as follows: To Assistant T. "\V. "\Verner, tbe computation of current work connected with trhtnglllations; to Dr. G. Hum pf, the comparison of field and office computations of geodetic work, and charge of registers of results; to Mr. J, Main, the comparison of astronomical computations of time, azinmt h, and latitmle determinations; to .Mr. E. EI. Courtenay, the least squares adjustments of completed triangulations; to Prof. R. Keith and )fr. F. Hudson, temporary computers, the reduction of astronomical obserrn· tions; and to Mr. H. H. Gerdes, the clerical work of the computing division. 'l'he direction and examination of computations and the duty of making special discussions after, and rPporting tht· results reached, devolved upon Assistant O. A. Schott. During the temporaQ- a\Jse11ce of Assistant, Hilgard, .Assistant Schott was acting assistant in charge, lietweeu August 11 and Septem lier 8. Itespecting tl!e persomwl, the following changes have occurred during the year: Dr. F. Kftmpf gavt' up his connection with the survey March 31; Mr. M. H. Doolittle was temporarily engaged between April 21 and June ll, and took perm:iuently the position yacated by Dr. Kampf, 011 September 1; Mr. W. B. French was assigned to field-duty March G, and his polSition in the Office was filled by )fr. H. H. Gcrtles, from tlJ.at date; Mr. L. 1'. Sbidy was temporarily connected with the computing division between July 19 and August 19, when he was transferred to the tidal division; )fr. ('. L Gardner was temporarily assigned to duty on September 1. Of the specia.J 1lisc11ssions made by l\<Ir. Schott, the following may be mentioned: Heimlts 01 hypsometric measures taken at Bodega Head and Uoss Mountain, in 1860and187:!, h,\' _Assistant G. Davidson, (a joint paper with the observer;) results of tlle secular ehauge of the magnetic declination at various statiom; j adaptation of triangulations to various conditions and conftguratious of the earth's surface; results of the secular change of the magnetic declination, dip, aud intensity, at "\Vashingtou, D. C.; resnlts of differential obserrntions of the magnetic declination made by Dr. 'Valker, at Fort Steilacoom, in 1866, aud at Camp Date Creek, Arizona, in 1867. lie also made, on three days, the usual magnetic observations at \Vashington, and, in connection with these, tested the accuracy attainable with the :!fl-inch Casella theodolite, in obserrntious for astronomical latitudes and azimuth. Tidal division.-The duties of this division, consisting of the red11ction of the tidal observations ta.ken at the several established stations on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts; the prrnlictiou aml 1mblication of title-tables for the principal ports of the Unitetl States; the prep<tration of all data relative to tides required for use in oflice and field work; correspondence with ouserrnrs and in revly to inquiries; inspection of new apparatus, and the general supervision of the sen"ice, hitve been continued under the charge of Mr. R. S . .Avery, who bas been assisted in the computations by l\Iessrs. J. Downs, A. Gottheil, C. Ferguson, L. P. Shilly, and Miss l\L Thomas. The particulars relatiug to the permanent tidal-stations, and observers at the same, ha,·e Lleen mentioued under tile hemh of the respective sections in which they are situated. The amount of office-work bas been much reduced of late, by instructing the obsen'ers to talmlate the high and low water as well as the height of the orllinates for C\'ery !lour ou s11itallly-prepared blank forms. This is done Ll.Y the ol>serrnrs at North Haven, :Fort l\fonroc, Fort l'oint, (.San Francisco,) Astoria, and Port Townsend; and it would appear that the character of tl!e obser\"a~1011s has been sensibly improved by their attention being directell to tbe inconvenience of occas1011al

faillue. The tide-gauges of the new form, with cylinder re\olving once in tweut,y-fonr hour~, receiving a week';; record, have been specially providecl with all that is ref}nisite for tabulating conven · fontly and accurately. 'Vhere these tables have not 1'een ma.de by ol>servers, they have been made in the Office as soon as convenient. The primary reductions for all the obser\'ations are made soon after they are recei~·eu, and the results put in a shape convenient for use when wanted. T.he duplication of hourly readings is completed for North Ilaven, Santiago, Fort Point, and Port Townsend, and nearl_y up to elate for Boston and New York. For the latter places only selected years have been read, the earlier ones being too imperfect. The mis:Sing place8 in the Fort Point and Santiago series have been interpolated by cun~el'i. On application of l\Ir. E. Roberts, of the British Nautical Almauac office, a copy of hourly readings of tidal observations at Fernandina, Fla., for one ;year, and of those at Santiago, Cal., for two years, were sent to him, to enal>le hiLD to apply to them the new harmonic analysis of Profo8sor Thomson, wbich had 1'een used ,·ery successfully on several series of British ouse1Tations, and on some of our own, previously sent to him. The Tide·Tables annually i8sued, contaiuing prediction8 of tides for the principal ports of the United States dnring the ensuing year, have been computed for 1874, under Mr. .Axery's supervision, and published. The predictions for Boston were contril.mted by .Mr. Ferrel, based on his discussions of his observations for that port. The table of constants appetHled to these pulJlications was imprornd and extended by means of new matter received at the Office. Draifinf/ divi8ion,-Tbis division is under the special direction of the assistant in charge of the Office. Its immediate supervision, as heretofore, bas remained with Mr. vV. T. Bright, wbo, from Lis long experience in the division, has bee11 enabled efficiently to distribute the work, adapting it generally to the special fitness of the several draughtsmen. The duties of the di,·ision have been divided nearly as follows: (See also Appendix No. 4.) J\Ir. A. Lindenkohl has been engageu in rerlllcing for publication tile topograpl!y and h~·drogra phy of tbe coast and harbor charts, and in making additions to the general" coast aml sailing charts. He has brought up to date the list of progres8 sketches that accompany the annual reports; made prqjectious on copper, prqjections for field.parties, and diagrams. Mr. H. Liudeukohl was employed upon the finer topographical reductions as well as upon the hydrography of various charts of the coast. He has wade fiehl.projeciions, tracings, and a great portion of bis time lrns been given to the prollnetion of a number of plJOtolithographic maps and charts. Ile luts also eugraYed ou copper the topography of San Francisco and Tamal Pais peninsula, upo11 the 2 -0 ,,100 ,J scale, chart of part of the western coast. }Ir. L. Karcher has constructed the greater number of projections called for by the numerot1s :field-parties, made diagrams and tracings, and has been engaged upon pliotoJithograpbic chart8 and sketches. Mr. F. Smith continued tracing for photographing to the publicatfon scale of ,..,~ 00 tl1e original topographical :fi.ehl-sheets; made pr~jects and copies of fieldsketclJes. Messrs. :F. and W. Fairfax have made traced copi(·.s of original hyurogra.pliic and topographical maps and charts called for by the public service, and done miscellaneous duty. J\fr. E. J. Sommer, until llfay, when he left the Office, was engage1l upon preliminary charts and sketches . .Mr. I» Erichsen bas filled in upon photographic prints, scale 80 h001 the topographical details, and has been engaged upon various classes of miscellaneous work. Mr. II. Eicl.Jholtz has been employed upon adding corrections to cbarts already published. Mr. C. E. r.. ewis bas attended to copying for the dfrision anu for the Office. Mrs. E. Nesbitt was employed in uuplicating the volumes of geo. graphical positions used lly the division. lHr. E. M:olkow was engaged <luring N ovemher and December in measuring the shore-line, &c., of rncent topographical sheets. Mr. :F. Hartig was assigned to the division in July, and worked upon special maps, charts, and tracings. Mr. )f. Angles joined the didsion in Febraa.r.f, and bas beou employed - upon photolithogrnphic charts and miscellaneous work. Messrs. R. F. Bartle and U. We!Jrhan were temporarily attached to tile dh·ision during a portion of the yea.r, arnl made tracings, corrected published charts, &c.

Hergesl1ei111er, whoi;;e execnth·e ahilily, 110 less than his technical knowledge of s1un~ying, drawiug, and e11grayi11g, ii-1 constantly exercised in promoting the efficiency of the work. The distl'ilmtion of the work among the different cngrin-crs, the snpcr\·ision of its execution, and verificati()n of tile si1me, the preparation of all the lettering, titles, and notes, and the arrangement of the work of elrctrotn1i11g, are among the many duties performed by him. Dtiring the last year the force of this di,·ision has been emplL·.}ed as follows: J\IessrR. ,J. Euthoft'er, S. Siebert, Il. C. Evans, A. Sengteller, "\Y. A. Thompson, and A. ~I. l\Iaedel ms topo· graphical engraYers; .Messrs. J. Knight, E. A. l\faet1el, F. Courtenay and A. Peterson as letter engravers; l\Iessrs. ll. :'.\I. Knight, H. S. Barnard, and F.

Evans, and F. Conrtenay have been employed only upon contract work; l\fr. E. l\folko>1·, who for several years has rfl!luced ontlines on copper with the pantograph, resigned the early part of the year; ~Ir. I~. F. Bartle was engaged but one month during tlw year, on acconnt of failure of sight; l\Ir. G. A. 1\.forrisou, the clerk of the <1ivision, was tmnsferre1l to the field in July; the clerical tltnies have since been performed hy l\lr. L. C. Kerr. A tabnlal' statement of tlt2 clmrts worked upon, auil the work performed uy each engra\·er, l::l given in Appendix: .No. :J. Electrotyping and plwtographin9.-"11Ir. George lVfathiot conducted these operation" as heretofore until the l:ist thiy of l\fay, when his life was sudtlenly arnl unexpectedly endml IJy t!J.e rupture of a large blood-vessel. l\Ir. l\IMhiot had had charge of that important branch of the wmk for more than tweuty years; awl the great perfection of details and invaria.ule success of the operations were, iu a large measure, owing to his untiring zeal aml ingenuity in experiment. A description of the process of electrotyping, as carried on in the Coast SL1rvey Office, ~as gh·en by him in tlte Coast Survey lteport for 1851. He was sncceeded in charge of the work by ~fr. A. Zlllnbrock, who had previously assistetl Mr. Mathiot, arn.l who has since carried on the operations with entire success, Mr. F. Ober assisting, as heretofore. Daring the year tb.il·ty-three electrotypes of tlle engraved plates ha.v(> lJeen repro · duced, and the photographic rcclt1ctions required for the drawing and engraving di\ isions have been made as usual. · Division of clmrts and instruments.-The w9rk in this tlivision, which included, besides the safe. keeping of archh·es, the ma.p-printing, tlistribntion of charts and r:lports, and the mechanicilin's and carpenter shops, has been directed during the year by .Mr. John T. Hoover. The dnty of registering and filing for convenient reference tLe original maps and charts of the survey, and the records of observations made in the field, and of keeping an account of tl1e same, as they are m;ed iu the Office, was performed by M:r. A. Z11mbrnck until June; after that time uy Mr. A. Schott. By the press used for copper-plate printing 14,810 copies of charts and skctclles have been printed within the year. The copper-plate press was worked by Mr. T. V. Durbam until J tme; after that time by Mr. Frank l\Ioore.. The work of backing with muslin the sheets required for office and field use, aml the miscella· neous duties pertaining to the folding-room, were performed during the year by Mr. H. Nissen. The map-room was in care of Mr. T. l\'IcDonnell. An aggregate of 16,584 copies of charts have been issued within the year, and 4,353 copies of annual report~ of va.ri~1.1s years have been distributed.

The wood-work of instrnmentR, tlieir pa,cking for transportation, and all work of carpeutry required in the Office lrns been performe(l by l\Ir. A. Yeatman, assisted by Mr. F. E. Lackey. Clerical force.-The general correspondence and office accounts ha Ye been, as heretofore, under the charge of l\fr. V. E. King, m;sisted by Mr. P. \V. Clancy. 1\fr. 0. A. Hoover acted as writer iu the l1y11rographic di·dsion. Mr. H. L. Hawkins has continued to discharge the dnties of principal accountant and bookkeeper in the office of the general disbursing agent, s~i.m11~l Hein, esq., and the clerical work of that office has been performed by Mr. \V. A. Herbert and W. I. Flenner. The paper which follmvs ( Appen<lix No. 1) specifies tlie sites of work occupiell in the past year. It is gratifying that, widely 1listribntml as the parties have been, the survey has been advanced in each site, as far as the appropriation would permit, and without special hinderance, either from ac· Cident or by reason of unusually unfavorable weather. In many important detail;; of the service the assistant in charge of the Offi.Je, Prof. ,J. E. Hilgard, has given his able co-operntio11. To the experience and care of the dis1Jnr3ing officer, Samuel Hein, esq., bas been llue the general promptitmle in resuming work at the change of the season in places indicate<l by my instructions for the tmnsfer of iield and hydrographic parties, and in the arrangement of matter for this report; am] other office duties under my own directio11.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 8.
REPORT ON THE PHYSICAL SURVEY OF PORTLAND BARBOH.

DE.A.R SIR: It is unnecessary for me to advert to the history of our renewed counection with the harbor-interests of Portland, because you will probably embrace this in your- own comments upon the season's work. Suffice it to say that we were called upon to recommend lrnrbor-lines for :F'ore River, and money was appropriated by the city of Portland to meet the expenses incurred in the preliminary examination of the locality. My share in this examination involved a study of the mornments of the tides and their relations to the channels and banks, which greatly interested me, because the instance before us was peculiar in some respects. Unlike most of the cases referred to us, we fonu{l, in tlte portion of the Fore River we were called upon to treat, a tidal channel with alluvial bed antl banks nearly in their natural condition; and we were to suggest in wbat manner and to what degree tbis avenue could be encroaclted upon hy wharves, &c., without i>o llisturbing the regimen 1:111 to cause the mud to start from the bottom and move down into more valuable portions of the port. In other words, we were called upon, llractically, to draw the liue between use and abusef to the end that no unnecessary restraint might be placed upou tbe commercial occupation of tbe water-front, and no increase of the sconring·power of the currents induced i_n a cbaunel able to s11ppl,Y from its vast accumulations of mud enough material, if once set in motion, to do great mischief. The limit!'! finally recommended were based mainly upon the '"isodynamic li'.ne.~'', or lines of erprnl scouring· power, determined by us in a mannner that I propose to describe step by step. With l\Ir. Horace Anderson's excellent hydrographic survey, we first of all, before making a tsingle observation in the field, calculated the volume that must pass tbrong-h ditforcnt Rections of the channel during the different hours of flood and ebb, at a time when the tides were at their average. When yon consider tl1at witll every change in the lteight of the ti<1, the cubical contents of basins and creeks with which the dmnnel commnuicates alter in a very irregular was, 80 that proportions can only be used for very small elements of height, you will appreciate the amount of labor which ~hese computatious involved. l\fy skillful assistants, Mr. J.B. Weir and Mr. Ed. H. Foote, spent a busy mont.h at the office in determining tliese standarrl volwncs, as I shall hereafter call them. Tbe next step was to determine from actual observa.tiops in what manner the volumes passing through the channel distributed themselves over the cross-sedions; whether they ran over t.he fiats or confined themsekes to the channel; whether tl1ey presse<l over on one shore in one part of the river or the other shore elsewhere, &c. ; in short, to follow the water in its meandering course from point to point. This field-work was also assigned to Messrs. Weir aml Foote, who organized parties, and, with the asRistance of our friernh1 at Portland, went into the field without a day's delay. We selected ten characteristic lines, crossing the stream at right angles, and in each of them made simultaneous observations of the current on the ebb and on the flood, at four or more sta· tions, which gave us transi>erse curves of 1,elocity. Each transverse curve of velocity had then to be corrected for the mean. This was clone by applying the co-efficient that would make the velocities multiplied into the depth of water give the standard t·olume previously computed for UiiR section. Finally, all the transverse curves, having been observed and corrected for the mean, were plotted on a projection of the harbor, and Jines of equal velocities were drawn along the borders of the stream, which were designated" isot.lynamic lines", because, properly speaking, they represented the mean movements from surface to bottom, and were, in effect, lines of equal 11co1tr. Haling given the above general sketch of our prooeediug, I shall now go back over the ground and give in greater detail the actual process elllj)loyed in a type case-that of Section 4 (see tables.)

THE UNITED ST.ATES CO.AST SURVEY.

95

At Section 4, which extendR from "SLone Wharf", the whole distance a(:ross the water-way at high tide was found to be 1,586 feet, bnt the part in motion at the time of maximum ebb-current was only about l ,OOO feet. Our stations lay at distances of UO feet, 275 feet, 480 feet, and 720 feet from the wharf, and gaye respecti\'ely 0.11, 0.87, 0.61, and 0.34 nautical mile per hour. 'l'hese we pl9tted upon profile-paper, using <listances and velocities as co-ordinat,es; and we completed the curve by sweeping a smooth line through the determined points. 'l'he11 we took out the \'elocities for enm humlrcd feet, and enterPd them in the thircl column of our aunexetl ta bk. The same course was taken with flood-velocities. The next step was to correct these Yelocities for the mean, which was done by appl,Ying a co-efficient, obtained in the following manner: Over each space of 100 feet, we took from J\Ir. .Anderson's ltJ·drograpbic sheet the a\·erage depth, and, having corrected it for the elevation of tide at the moment of our obsenatious, multi. plied it into the ye]ocity aml ~lte distance (100 feet) ; then i;;mmued up the whole Yolume. This volume fell short of the stmu1nr<l for this section, because the fall of the tide for the da.y of observation fell below the mean, &c. So we didded the standard Yolnme by the volume obscn-eu, aud found tllat we must increase all tlle velocities 13 per cent. in order to have our transvene curve represent the mean movement. \Ve have spoken of the" iiolume" obtaiued by multipl~·ing obsen,cd velocities iuto distance and depth; but we would uot be mHlerstood to ilulicate that the word is here used in the same sense as in the case of standard volume for tbc Sl:'ction, because tile observed velocit,ies were those of the surface onl,Y. \VI.um corrected, as th('.f appear in the hu;t colnmn of our table, the figures given are tlte true mean velocities from surface to bottom. If om· obsen·ations l1ad extended over a semi-lunation and embraced eYery tide, we sl·o11l1l Jiaye fonml onr average co-etlicitmt below nnil:r (perLaps about 0.90); becamse the mean rate from surface to bottom is usually less than the s1fffaceYelocit,y in tidal channels. ln the case of Portlanll, we ltad an udnrntage wliich we ditl uot posse:-.s in New York. The Fore H.iver is simply an avenue between the St>a a1Hl interior basins, not so distant as to occasion urnch delay with the filling autl draining j so that, for any section we hall a mind to choose, we could compnt(~, from :!\'Ir. Amlerson:s survey, the passing volume, and correct 011r surface-velocities. But. in the Bast l~irnr at New York we were obliged to spend a great deal of time in making ohscnations from surface to bottom at the \\' i1ll-1ttrect section, in order to obtain an initial volume. In the Annual l~eport of the Coast Slll'WJ" for 1871, them will be found a general paper on the location of harbor-lines, in which I have, with the help of a simple diagram, illustrated this matter of isod;ynamic lines more fully, and spoken of the conditions under which, not the simple velocities, but tbe resultant of all the velocities, are mmd; and it, is for this reason that I employ the term isodynarnic lines instead of lines of equal velocity, the former being more comprehensive. There are conditions where, instead of using simple Yelocities, we should use their squares; but the Fore River does not seem to be one of the cases. I have thought best to furnish a sketch with this report, showing our ten sections at Portland and illustrating our tables. These were not furnished at the time the draughts containing the harbor-lines were sent to Portland, and may be of interest. In drawing the harbor-line, we gaye greater weight to the tbb, because it appeared to be the principal working agent; its tkalweg lying more nearly over the line of greatest depression. We offer an illustration of this in our sketch, where, for "Section 3 ", we have compared both transverse curves with the profile of the bottom.

At a. meeting of the city council, lwlu Oetobor 17, 1872, a couunuuication from the harbor-commissioners was receiYetl, recommending that it is necessary that proper lines should be established in Fore l~irnr, to preYcnt encroachrue11ts, and askiug co-operation to establish such lines. Head and acccptetl, and refer:red tu the barlmr-eommittee, witl1 power to carry out Um views of Urn rei>orL. A true corn~. Attest: H. I. ROBINSON, City Clerk.

The recommemlatiom,; of the hal'bor commissioners were su\Jscqnently carried out, as per report of the auvisory committee of the United States Coast Survc_y. Attest: H. I. llOBINSON, City Clerk.

To the ftoll01'<t/Jle .Mayor and Cif.IJ Council t?f I'ortlmul: The undersignc<l, llarbo1·-commissio1iers of l-.ortlanu, have tllC honor to lay before you the report aml aecompauying maps, just received from the advisory council callml together by us upou your authority to establish harbor-lines in Fore River. 'Ye obtained for this important work the services of Superintendent Peirce and Professors \Vhiting and Mitchell, of the Uuited States Coast Survey, wbo, from their scientific knowledge anu familiarity with such subjects, were best qualified to execute the work and give it a character of the highest authority. Their services were gratui· tously remlered ; and we are under special obligations to them for the interest manifested in this inquiry, and for the early completion of the survey, in spite of other pressing duties, which might reasonably have been pleaded as a cause for delay. The execution of the work bas been based upon purely scientific principles, excluding prejudice and error, and equitably adjusting public and private interests. The work will not need to be repeated, and we would respectfully recommend that the lines like those in the lower harbor be established and confirmed by suitable legislation.

The following resolution was unanimously passed : "The city go\Ternment desires to express its sense of obligation to the members of the advisory council-Superintendent Benja,min Peirce, and Professors Henry Mitcl1e1l and Henry L. "'\Vhiting, of the United States Co:tst Survey-for the serYices they have rendered us in making an elaborate. physical survey of our harbor, for the purpose of establishing limits in an important section of it, o which marginal structures may lie safely extendecl. 'Ve realize the fact that it is to the advantage of our city to secure in the development of onr witter-front all the territory that can be turned into productive and taxable propert.y, without limiting too much the capacity of tlie harllor, or affecting its perpetuity. "We are aware, also, that to do tliis witbont an accurate knowledge of the 1mbject is dangerous, am] may prove unprofitable. Qnestions of this nature belong to a branch of science of which these gentlemen are ma11ters, and to a large extent the founders, and we gratefully recognize the high character of their services, their value to the city, and the interest and generosity manifested in rendering thern gratuitously: Therefore, "Resoli,ed, That to these gentlemen individually, and to the United States Coast Survey, Portland is again laid under deep obligations, aud with its future history their name..<>, and services will be intimately associated."

APPENDIX No. H.
ADDITIONAL REPORT CONCERNING THE CHANGE8 IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF CHATHAM MONOMOY. AND

A year ago I had the honor to present a somewhat lengthy report concerning the coaRt of Chatham and the peninsula of Monomoy, since which time a few additional items of information have been collected, wbieh deserve, perhaps, to be recorded. In my previous report, I made some translations from Champlai11's notes, made during a niya.ge along our coast in moo, in which he speaks of Malle Barre (Nauset I~let, of which be not only gives a special map on large scale, but distinctly marks the location upon his coast-chart of "Nou11elle Pranse "), and of h1s coasting thence along :in "arenaceous" shore and onward round a dangerous "point of sand tflkiclt juts out three leagues to the S. 8. E.-a very dangerous place'', which he calls "Gap Batturiei·", and which we call Monomoy; and finally of bis arrival at "I'ort Fortune'', of which he gives a large-scale map, which we easily recognize as Chatham. I alluded to the popular tradition that Monomoy is a very recent creation of the sea, and cited maps aud reports to show the connecting links of evidence between the Monomoy of to-day and the " Cap Batturier" of Champlain. It is true that if Monomoy had been from the outset increasing as rapidly as it has been since our first regular Ooast Survey sheet of 1847, we might argue that in 1606 no-decided peninsula existed. Still, in tbe face of its representation upon Cbamp1ain's map of "Nouvelle .F'ranse", and upon the chart of the British Coast Pilot of 1707, and in spite of its length being stHted in the "Description of Barnstable," of 1802, I did not think I could give any considerable weight to traditians, even tbonglt my excellent friend, l\fr. Otis, of Yarmouth, bad taken never so much care in co1lecting them. The fact that I was stating was simply the rapid gain of M:onomo:r upon t.he waters of Nantucket Sound; and I looked back into the history of this to ascertain whether tltere was any probability that this strip of beach would cross the channel lying betweeu its extremity and the neighboring shoals, or even annex Nantucket to the mainland. I was satisfied that its progress bad been intermittent, and that the gain bad been at a higher rate recently than formerly; and I think any one who will go back over the charts, as I ha,'e done, selecting as authority only those which are professional in character, will come to the same conclusion. The following table gives the distances from James Head {site of present Chatham lighthouses) to the extreme point of Monomoy :

moy is represented in a manner that makes it doubtful whether he designed to make it dry sands But in the Atlas Novus (Dutch maps with Latin text), 1640, it is represented as a strip of dry land extending nearly south about six miles. Here it is called Vlacke Hoeck, i. e., Flat Point. Chatham, on the same map, bears the name Ongelitck·ige Haven, probably from Champlain, who named the place "Port Fortune, for the itnhappy circumstances 1vhfoh Juul befallen m th.ere." It is a far better map than Ohamplaiu's, showing that more cormct information bad by this time been obtained. Des Barres was the most remarkable geographer of the eighteenth century. ludeed, his maps were only superseded by the Coast Survey. He gives a view of :M:onomoy as seen from sea, in addition to his two maps, showing that be fully appreciated its importance to the mariner. It is very remarkable, then, that he should give this peninsula a length greater than it has to-day! Perhaps, as Captain Eldridge says, it was much longer before Egg Island bl'Oke off.· I am, however, inclined to take the measurement stated in the "Description of Barnstable" as the first positive testimony concerning the true exte.nt of this peninsula. It occ1irs in stating the position of a humane house, and is meant to be correct. There are, as I stated in the previous article, plenty of old maps which give different testimony from that which my investigation has reached;. but these are only popular pictures of the country, and not trustworthy, especially as regards worthless strips of beach. It was only a few weeks since that a bookseller in Boston showed me an expensive atlas, recently issued, which he regarded as the most complete set of maps in the market, but which failed to give the Monomoy Peninsula. Had this work been a coast pilot, or assumed to be a collection of marine charts, such an omission would have been fatal to its repute ; but as it was nothing of this sort, the absence of a sand-bank, however notorious among sailors, wa8 of no consequence to any one likely to purchase such an at1as. Not wishing, however, to ignore traditiops altogether, I have examined a sketch furnished me by Capt. George Eldridge, a resident of Chatham, who is well known ai:; a pra.ctical pilot, a surveyor, and a chart-publisher. This sketch, although traditional, as it assumes to be, is confirmed, in one important feature at least, in Des Barres' remarkable chart of 176'1, in this: tllat toward the close of the eighteenth century, Monomoy was joined to the upland, stopping the passage-way from the Sound, so that Pleasant Bay was only accessible from the ocean-side. At tbe time of Des Barres, 17s1; Nauset beach lay along the front of Pleasant Ba;y, and stretched half-way down to the present Chatham light-houses, and had advanced two miles in the previons thirty years. (Atlantic Neptune.) Lieut. (now Rear-Admiral) Charles H. Davis, writing in 1848, gh'es, as the rate of advance for Nauset Beach from the northward, two miles in twenty years, upon the testimony of Capt. Franklin Nickerson, of Chatham.· One may easily see bow the Nauset beach, com1losed of alluvia. swept down the outside coast by the sea from the northeast, has extende_d itself along the resultant between the oeean-waves on the one hand and the outflow of Pleasant Bay on the otlier. In this way, it has gone on till the too confined waters of Pleasant Bay have forced a more direct outlet again, and the march of the beach from above bas recommenced. The early history of these movements is in no wise peculiar; the same ma.y be obserrn<l at many other places upon our sandy coast. B11t this familiar history seems to be close(l,
or simply an exte11ding sboal.
THE REAL POINT OF INTEREST.

It nmv appears that Nauset beacli does not extend itself to reneUJ the cordon in front of Chatham, but that the glacial killtt, upoti wkicli tl1e villa[/e stands, are to be thrown r>pen to the fury of tlie sea, and the place is destined to renew its ancient reputation as the Ongeluckige Ho,:1Jen,. Since our survey of 1847, Nanset beach, which was found lying nearly across the month of Pleasant Bay by Mr. Gliick, has not advanced. If this change of regimen is really taking place, to wbat shall we attribute it T to the failure of supply from above where the clift's have lost their covering of sand and expose only hard clays to the present wear of the sea' or is the.new order

of thiugs the sign of larger operations of the ocean affecting tlle submerged co11toms arnl forei11" tllc saruls !Jack upon ti.Jc continent 'l Si.Jould the supply of new material Le really cnt off, it is 011 l~ (t question of time when the sea, grinding along the shore, sha,ll eon\cert the present co,ll'se gr~wel into dune-sand an<l deli,·er it to the wind and tide; for it is in this way that the material or 1111r Leaches is to be carried back into the interior or swept into sheltered bays allll the a{hant:e of tl1c sea coutinue<l, so that, geologically speaking, 1\lonomoy may have but a short life before it. The clay that underlies the gravel of Cape Cod does not supply beach-sand, proper!~- speaking·, whc11 sifted lly the sea, lrnt ready-made dune-sand and fine material for salt-mar:-;hes. Them h;, l think, an interesting significance in this breaking-up of the littoral cordon at Cape Cml. \Ye haYe tJo other instance like it that I am a ware of. On the contrary, tlrn sand-barriers along on r coast have generally strengthened since our earliest surveys. For instance, llattems Uanks, which is a slender strip of sand one hundred and eighty miles in length, lying at some points thirty rnile,; from the mainland, has fewer breaks in it to-day than it had at the l>eginning of this ceutur~-; and if we go back to the It,aleigh chart, bearing date of 1588, we find tliat the uumlJer of inlets has !liminishetl at least one-tlli.nl. ~Ir. Frederick Kidder, who has given much .study to the g-Pog-rnpli.\' of N ortll Carolina, thiuks that the di min utiou in the numlJer of water-ways through the 1Jead1 has !Je<.'n the indirect results of the destruction of the forests and the cultivation of the soil upou the waiulaud, which ha,·e diminished the outtiow of land-waters. Glancin:; at our geHeral eoast-cliart of :Xcw Englam1, we see that a region of 1>hallow \\'ctter exte11ds eastward from Cape Cod and Nantucket to a llistance of one hundred and eight.}- miles, m11l we might hasten to the co11clusio11 that here lies the founllation of lost lands, washed awa~- l>.Y tlw sea precisely as the present cape is being destroyed, and this has bccu frcqueut,ly suggested h.1g·eolog-ists. But since the movements of ti.le ocean arc toward the continent, where is the material to be fonu1l? There are uot sufticicnt beaches, dunes, and accumulations in sheltered 11.1ys and sounds in this part of the co11tineut to balance such an account. In fact, it takes all the tlnncs auu beaches of Pro\·incetown auu l\Ionomoy autl the shoals aud marshes of Nantucket Souud antl C:i11e Uo1l Bar to balance the loss of tlle comparati ,·ely narrow belt of lancl tllat we see, from the present elenitiou of the glacial cliffs, must be admitted to have fallen a, prey to the waYes. As the glacial cliffs tumble dowu before the attacks of the sea, there are exposed, a short llistance above the reach of storm-waves, as they now occur, rifts of oyster-shells like those of cxistiugspccies, aud the same are found also iu wells fat· back from the coast, showing that, pre\·ious to the gl:lCial deposit,, there existed a bank extending into the sea; and I suggest tllat the sllallow gromul whicll I h~we spoken nf above as stretching out oue huudred and eighty miles t.o the eastw:ml may never have been ti.Je site of p;lacial deposits. Tllere is oue little point that I must touch upon here, which is irrelevant to the special sul~jcct of this report, lmt maJ· iuterest somebody. It is this: the rate at which the coast falls back is not, on our shores, depeudeut upon elevation, as Sir Charles Lyell believes it to be in parts of Eu gland. There are, for instance, all sorts of elevations along the outer margin of Cape Coll, aral .ret the shore-Hue is remarkably smooth, haYing no indentations to mark the more rapid encroachments upon low countries. Tho rapidity of encroachment seems to depend upon the character of tlte material almost exclusively. The glacial drift has been dumped into .the sea pell-mell, and, l>ecause so badly packed, is peculiarly peris!Jable where attacked by the wan·s. Ou l\fartha;s Vineyard, fo1· instance, we llave, iu the same neighl)Orhood, two lofty bluffs, Naslrn111lista aud Gay Heacl, wllich have undergone very unequal erosion from the sea. Tile former (glacial) is f:tlliug rapidly away, while the latter (sedinrnnt.<try) has been kindly dealt with. One is treated as au intruder upon the ocean's domain; the other, as a peaceful settler.
OORREC'fIONS OF PREVIOUS PAPER.

In the sketci.J accompanying my former report, a portion of Morris Island, marked D, was stated to be "hillocks." I had not been on Lhe precise ground at the time, aud misinterpreted our topograplaical map. On Pe\·isiting Chatham, a few weeks since, I observed that what l had called" hillocks" were really hills of considerable heights clustered together. Captain Cliamplain describes the same locality as "petis costaux de 1m>nta·ignes." H. Ex. 133-14

REPOliT OF THE SUPEl~INTENDENT OI<'

Captain Eldridge objects to my uescribing the little fresh }}Ond, wl.iich appears Oil both Cltamplai11's map and our own. as "lying in the hollow of the upland.'' A careful inspection shows that this pond rests against the upland on one side, and is separated from the sea 011 the other by a natural dike of alluvium.
RESULTS OF THE LAST SURVEY.

In the month of November last, Mr. Il. L. l\Iarindin, assisted by Mr. J. B. Weir, made another plane-table sun·ey of tb-0 coast of Chatham, between the parallels 41° 39' and U 0 4~', covering the area' of waste, mul be supplies the following tables, which are those pre,·ionsly published, brought up to date.

The loss of beach between 1847 and 18G8 was at the rate of 11.4 acres per annum ; between 1868 and 1872, 20 acres; and, for the past year, 51.5 acres : so that the waste has been going on at an accelerating rate. The most salient point of the remaining beach ou the parallel of no 41' has not wa~tc!l, but gained in width during the past year; this, howernr, seems to be a mere fluctuation. The upland has been but little disturbed during the past year; but attacks from the sea are so much apprehended that buildings have been moved back from places where inroads are threatene<l. :\fr.

our abilit.y. Those points which have not been washed by the sea we supposed to ba,-e remained the same, and we have made them the base for determining the positio11s of other points that biwc undergone a "sut-change." Between the time of Champlain, lGOG, and the date of our first regular survey, 184i, Des Bar res' chart properly comes in; but the scale is smaller, and we should not feel justified in enlarging a printed sheet. (See Atlnntic Neptune.) The beach was broken in Des Barres' time in front of Chatham, and the Monomoy Peninsula hooked on to the uplaml at James Head, near the present light.houses. Subsequently, however, Nanset beach advanced from the northward, and re.pl'odncell the littoral cordon in front oftbe town, as shown by Lieutenant Davis (before referred to); and finally, hcfore 1847, another inlet opened above, since which Nauset beaclb has not advance<7. " Ram Island", which, upon the original map of Champlain, was called "Isle rempli8 <le bois rledans un grand cul de sac" (to quote the exact phra~e), obtained its recent name on Des Barres' chal't, and still appeared in the survey of 184 7, at which time it had an elevation of 20 _feet, was used as a pasture, and had a bnilcling upon it. The subsequent surveyors found no such island existing. The dwindling of the beach from date to date is well illustrated by these 1:1kctches, upon which we have carefully distinguished upland (glacial drift) from alluvi~t lJy shading the former in lineE', the latte.r in dots.

ImPOHT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX.No. 10.
NOTE CONCERNING CHANGES IN THE SUDMElWED CO.NTOuw.; OFF SANDY HOOK.

DEAR SIR: Having insufficient time in which to prepare a full report up()n the changes at Sandy Hook, lmt deeming the matter too important to be postponed altogetl1er, I submit a ft>w of our tahles showing tl1c rcsult,s of comparisons among our repeated h;plrograpl1ic snn·1\ys, witl1 :t rough sketcll illustrating our manner of computation.

Tlte survey of Captain· Gedney in 1840 fnrnished but little data, and that of] 855 by Captain Craven is incomplete (althougll goo<l); but the surveys of 18G3 by myself, and 187:1 by :Mr. NPs, were made expressly for the purpose of comparison. ·The shore-line surrn~·s, which I have never regm'decl as furnishing tile ldnt1 of data reall_y necessary to measure the advance of the Hook, I have not used. I will remark, howeYer, from rnemor.'-, that there was little superficial change for several years before 1860; that a rapid growth took place between lSGO and 1863; and that since 18G5 the Rook has apparently heen wnsl1ing away · .Next season we propose to make another shore-line survey in great detail. Regarding Sanely Hook as a great mole built out by the sea across the floor of the bay, I Imm considere<1 the submerged cont~:mrs as those most unlikely to be affected by accidental causes, and that tll('ir elrnnges of position should furnish the best measures for the progress of this remarkable work of 11atnre. Jm;pectiug the seven tables appended, with the help of the diagram which accompanies them, you will, I think, conclude that the Hook is rapidly advancing, and that we ha Ye no reason to suppose that its rate of progress has slackened. I'rofossor Bache, in his Reports of 1856 (Appemlix No. 38) and 1857 (Appendix Ko. 37), gives tl1P average rnte of i11c1·ease of the dry point of Sarn.ly Hook 27~ feet per mmum. Onr comparison of snhmergT'tl contonrs shows U1e increase recently to have been about fJO feet per annum ! l'rofessor Bache fonn<l that I<'lynn's Knoll, which lies on the other side of tlw main iship-channc1, .did not rccc>de aR the Hook allvanced, so that this channel declined in width 272 feet per annum. 'Ve tincl that the base of Flynn's Knoll begins to give way at the rate of 17 feet per annum, so tbat the main shipelmnne1 loses about 33 feet per annum. The present width of this channel between the 24-foot curves is 2,800 feet, which is about the minimum required for a heavy sailing-ship beating to windward, so that, unless Flynn's Knoll beats a more hasty retreat hereafter than heretofm·e, we shall soon find this important channel falling into disrepute. The main ship-clianncl at Sandy Hook is the direct avenue to Sandy Hook Bay, the grand outer roadstead of New York Ilarbor, ancl the route pursued by most heavy ships bound to the city. The Swash Channel is improving, so that it is more ancl more used as a direct avenue from tlrn sea to New York City, and may, before many years, become a sate and adequate channel at all times. Sti11 the loss of the Lower Bay as an outer roadsteacl would be a misfortune that can scarcely be estimated. The material forming Sandy Hook is swept up from the Long Branch coast by the diagonal wash of the sea. This was placed beyond dispute by my observations of 1857. Materials of the Ramc specific weight as the san<l were placed in the sea at many different points down the outside shore, and at different distances off shore. Those within the action of the waves breaking near the Rllore were swept along to the northward, and finally collected at the point of the Hook. Those placed far off slwre never came to lantl, so that I conclmlecl that the tidal currents took very little part in the transaction. J\fr. Whiting suggests that the giving way pf Flynn's Knoll has admitted the more rapid advance of the Hook. · I think Captain Patterson and Major-General Ilnmphreys would feel an interest in seeing this
r~port.

Very respectfully, yours,

HEPOR'l' OF GEOGliAPIIICAL AND IlYDlWGRAPHICAL EXPLORATIONS ON THE COAST OF ALASKA, BY W. H. DALL, ASSISTANT IN THE COART St:RVEY.

SAN FRANCISCO, C.AL., ~'oi·mn/JcJ' 10, 1873. SIR: I have the honor of suhmitting the following report of our occupations during the past i eason, with accompanying papers. "\Ve left San Francisco, Cal., April 28, 1873, on the United States Coast Sur,ey schooner Yukon, a.nd arrived at Uualashka, .Aleutian Islands, ~fay 20, 187.3. During the voyage; current arnl temperature observations were kept up, as on previous occasions. vYe remained at Una.Jasbka until June 11. This was for the purpose of carefully rating our chronometers. Signals were erected and preparations for continuing the survey of Captain's Ilay were made, at such times as the weather allowed, until the rating of tlie chronometers was completed.. During this period, 113 observations for time, 58 ol>ser1ations for latitude, and U6 observations for magnetic dcclina,tion were obtained. I have already reported to ·you in regard to observations made in the vicinity of Sannakh, including the discovery of a new cod-bank, and the determination of the southern auu eastern terminations of the celebrated reefs about Sanuakh. These obsen-atious were taken prior to our arrival at Unalashka, and will l>e more fully alluded to hereafter. Leaving Uualashka, June 11, we sailed directly for .Attu, the most western island of the chain, arriving June 18. Here 216 obser1ations were taken for dip and magnetic declination, and 80 for time, latitude, and_ azimuth. We sailed hence June 27, and in latitude 520 56' 41" nortll~ and longitude 1n;o 38' 20" east, sounded in 1,018 fathoms without reaching any bottom, though all our available line was used. The next day, in latitude 520 20' north and longitude i 770 17' 00" east, sounded in 900 fathoms, finding the bottom to be composed of that peculiar ooze, full of Forami1vifera belonging to the genus Globigerina, and which has been designated by the English investigators as "recent chalk." vVe arrived at the harbor of Kyska June 29, and, having determined its suitable character as a landingpoiut for a cable, proceeded to make a thorough reconnaissance-sur>ey of it. Here we obtained 51 observations for tides ; 11414 SOJindings over lines twenty-seven miles in extent ; 253 observations for horizontal angles; 631 observ-ations for shore-line, covering a.n ext.ent of :fifty-ft ve and one-lialf miles; 152 observations for azimuth, time, and latitude ; and 192 for magnetic declination ,md dip. Observations were also taken for determining the position of the group known as the Davidoff Islands, which are placed about six miles too far north on the charts now in use. We left Kyska July 24, and arrived at Constantine Harbor, Amchitka, on the following day. Here we obtained 96 observations for magnetic declination, and 90 for azimuth, time, and latitude; the weather being very unfavorable. Sailing hence .August 6 7 we arrived at Adakh on the 9th, and disco-vered a new harbor in the ;Ba.y of Islands, in which we anchored and of wbicli a sketch accompanies this report. Ilere we obtained 32 observations for magnetic declination, and 46 for latitude, time, and azimuth, in spite of the most discouraging fog and rain. 'Ve then sailed for Atka on the 13th of .August, and arrived in Nazan Bay on the 17th. En route we obtained a sound in latitude 520 19' 00" north, and longitude 1750 23' west, getting rocky bottom at 700 fathoms. At .Atka, the weather did not improve, and we were unable to obtain observations for latitude, bnt obtained 48 for azimuth and time and 64 for magnetic declination. Examinations were also made of Korovinsky Bay and the solfataras of Boiling Spring voleano. We then sailed for the jslands of tho Four Craters. Here, as there are no harbors, we were unable to eff'oot a. landing, but obtained sufficient information to show tha.t·they bear no resemblance, in position, size, or form, to the group, as represented on the charts in use. We then continued on our way, and arrived, August 29, in th~ vicinity of the Bogos1o:ffvolcano 1 where again the heavy

;;ea inernnted us from landing. \Ve obtained observations, placing the island in .53° 58' 36 11 nortlt latitude, and lougitude about 1G7° 33' 30" west, agreeiug with LUtke, but differing from all the otller bytlrogm1)he1·s by several miles. \Ve obtained soundings on the line of tlHl reported reef extending from this islaml to Umnak, and failed to obtain bottom at 800 fathoms ·within a few miles of shore, and the non-existence of the reef may be taken as demonstrated. Passing the northwest end of U nalashka, we came upon the western end of the great Bering Sea i)latean, with soundings in 60 fathoms, graYelly bottom. 'Ve arrived at Unalasbka on the 31st of August. Here we proceeded to obtain the summer-rates of our chronometers, which bad not done as well as we had Loped for. The triangulation of the bay was continued, Uknadok Island completely surveyed, aml our azimuth-observatious continued arnl augmented. 'Ve obtained liere 113 observations for azimuth and time, 128 for magnetic declination, 430 for horizontal angles, an<l 183 obserrntions for shore-line extending over fifteen and a half miles. The weather prevented our carrying on the soundings as I had hoped to do. \'Ve then sailed, September 25, for the Shumagins, but, owing to long-continued gales, did not arrive there until the 5tll of October, when we anchored in Humboldt llarbor,surveyed b;y us last J ear, and wliich has since become a fav01'ite resort for vessels in this region dnriug bad weather. Here bad weather and high winds were almost unremitting, yet we managed to ohtain 185 observations for azimuth, time, am! latitude, and 80 for magnetic declination. A genuine cyclone occurred on the 12th of' October, dri\'ir~ tile schooner Wm. Irelan ashore on tbe coast of Unga. 'Ve did what we could for the sufferers, who called on us for assistance, and brought them down to San Francisco. The weatLer offering no hopes of doing more work, we sailed from Ilnmboldt llarhor on the 18th of October for San Pranuisco. Au verse winds t1riviug us nearly to the north end of Vancouver lslm1d bdore we passed south of the parallel of 50° north, we obtained a calm day, and liaving prepared a <1uantity of fine twine for the experiment, we sounded in latitude ,190 24' 01" and longitude 13!P 47' west, and with au excellent opportunity, we ran out the whole, 1,GG4 fathoms, without obtaining any bottom. "'e reeled in over 400 fathoms; but a whale became entangled in the line, and we lost the rest jt1st when we hall a gootl opportunity of recovering tbo whole. The weight used was a ten-pouud lead, and the practicahility of usi11g even tliis fine and common nuttorial (ortliuary hemp twine) was thornughlydemonstrate<l. \Ve arrived in San Francisco November G. During the whole season, current and temperature observations were carrie!l on, and observations for the Leight of many of the prominent peaks of the islands were obtained. The accompanying appendix contains much that I judged best to omit from this portion of the report for brevity's sake, with many of the obser\'ations iu tabular· form, and especially a tab1e containing a li:st of the various determinations of latitude, time, and magnetic declinu.tion at the places where our observations were taken, arranged in chronological order. This is not witlwnt some historical, as well as comparative, value. The officers of the vessel fultilled their duties with care au<l promptitu<le. )fr. Noyes, as the records will attest, has usetl every endeavor to carry out his part of our work with neatness a.nil care; and I must especially refor to the energy and interest displayed by 1\Ir. Baker in seizing every oppor·tuuity for outaiuing results uuder disadvantageous circumstances, and to the capability he Las shown for fol filling the duties of' ltis position. I rnmaiu, with great respect, your ohcdient servant, WILLIAM H. DALL, Aetfog Assistant in the United States Coast 8u>'1Jeg. Prof. BENJA:IHN PEIJWE, Superintendent of tlic U1iited States Coast Survey.

ATTU.

This harbor, which is difficult to enter or to leave except with a perfectly fair wind, is subject to tlie effect of the hea·;y swell from northerly gales. It is very well represented on tbe chart published from the United States Naval Ilydrographic Office, and constructed by Lieutenant Gibson. The position, which bas been given rnry variously by different navigators, agrees in the egg.entials with that of Gibson. The azimuth will he found referred to under that head farther on.

THE TINITED STATES CO.AST SURVEY.

113

This harbor was examined with regard to its capabilities as a btnding-place for the cable, bat possesses no reoommendations except its geographical position. Tlte entrance is narrow, shoal, and rocky, and in tbe winter storms it breaks clear across the mouth of the harbor. Inpursuance of your instructions, I examined Sarauna Bay, on the east end of the Jsiaud, and found it shoal and rocky, with no protection. Gotzeb Harbor, mentioned by Gibson, is au open bay with deep water and rocky bottom; and Massacre Bay is reported to han~ similar characteristics. \Ve may, therefore, reasonably assume that the island of Attu possesses no facilitiPs for thP telegraphic enterprise.
IlOULDYR. ISLAND.

Boulllyr possesses no harl>ors or anchorages. Large shoals arc doubtfully reported bctw<'cn this island antl Kyslm. We were close to their reported position in hoayy weather, lnit R.lw. no breakers..
l\:YSKA ISLAND.

I reported to you last season tbat, from information derived from old naYigators in this regiou, I deemed it prolml>le tbat it was more likely than any other to l1arn tbe characteristics rrip1irPtl for a landing-place for the cable. I am gfad to be able to state tliat a tilorough examination ha;;; entirely confirmell the views I then expressed. The harbor of Kyska is a noble bay, perfectly protected from all winds, with good hohlingground and a moderate depth of water, which increases Yery gradually seaward. Tho bottom of tbe bay is an almost level :floor of sandy mud, and the western shore is an almost coi1tinuous srrnllbeacb. The position is somewhat farther east and sonth tl:mn that assigned hy Gibson. A tl1orongh reconuaissauce-survey was made of the bay and its approaches. It llas not been preyion>1ly visited by a suneying·vessel, so far as I can discover. The entrance is wide enough to enable a sailing-vessel to beat in or ont at any time. Tliere are no hicltlen da,ngers, and the depth of wat<>r is sufficient for auy vessel. From this point, observations were made fi.xiug the position of the Da1'idoff Islanus, which are very greatly in error in the charts now iu use, and, as to whick, considerable confusion of names has arisen.
il1CIIITKA.

Enveloped in fog when we approached it, °\\'e were fortunately obliged to enter Uonstantinc Harbor, instead of Kiriloff Harbor, as we intended, the reasons for which will preseutly appRar. Constautine Harbor is open to the northeast, but otherwise is an excellent anchorage, as the soutl1west winds alone are prevalent daring the summer months. The weather was almost constantly foggy, and we experienced the greatest difficulty in obtaining good astronomical observations. When obtained and repeated, these showed either that the whole island has been much misplaced on the charts, or that its eastern extremity ba.R been erroneously elongated beyond it.s true position. The latitude is abOnt the same as that given by most previous hydrographers, but the longitude i~ from 16 to 11 miuutes of arc farther west than the charts put it. Our observations were suffic"entlr numerous, and agrectl sufficiently among themselves, to place tbis beyond a don ht; and the correctness of our position is probably as great as our instrnments were capal>le of determining. When making for Kiriloff Harbor, stated in the United States Naval Directory for Bering Sc.a to be" the only place where a vessel can lay to anclior in the islantl ", we could not find it. llence I took the large boat from Constantiue Harbor, and proceeded up the coast of Amchitka in search of it. We reached the middle cape of the island, about five miles east of Constantine Harbor, without seeing any bay or harbor on our way. We stopped here to take tea and obtain some bearings, and on our return I noticed a cross on a bill. Putting in here, we fountl the old Kiriloff village, abandoned by the Russians in 1849, and now in ruins, half covered by a luxuriant growth of nettles. Our ·astonishment may be imagined when we not only did not find any.such bay as is represente<l on the charts, but on sounding found nowhere more than three fathoms of water, while our boat f00<1uently touched on hidden rocks, antl the only protection proved to be a narrow space between two broken reefs extending northwar~ from the shore, and hot room enougll for a ve88Cl to swing.

REPORT OF THE

SUPERINTB~DENT

OF

Only tlrn 1·ery smallest class of ''essels could go in here at all. "The place is un wortlty the name of a harbor, all(l the 0111y recommendation I can give is tltat vessels shonltl steadfastly a\'oid going near it. It is auout three miles west aud auont one mile north of Co11sbrnti11e lfarbor, aml Hs position conseqnently partakes of the corrections to be applied to the former.
ADAKH.

This island offering a f;fforaule position for continuing onr observations 011 tlrn dcclilrntion, "\\P proceede1l to an anchorage in Oltagakh n~y, which had been reco:nmen1leil to us by one of the Hnssian rnlYigators, but, fimling it closCll by a bar with only nine feet of "\\:tter on it, we were unable to enter. I took tho boat and proceeded to examine an opening in the land, which had struck me as likely to afford shelter when beating into the strait the day before. Ilere I discover11 an excellent mwhorage, with good holdiug-ground, and ;;helter behind what proYerl to be au island formiug uart of an archipelago, which closes the mouth of a very large and beautiful bay known as the Day of Islands. A sketch of the anchorage accompanies this report. 'l'he topography here is >cry broken, but coYered with a carpet of luxuriant greeu, while the m_yri~ul wiuding cltannels between the islands offered great tem1)tations to us to remain and attempt a sun·e;r. Ilere we obtained numerous enormous crabs, from which it is possillle that the name of tl1c main isla11!1 may lie derived; A dakh signifying a crab in tho Aleutian dialect. The Lay of' "'aterfalls near lJy is open to the south, and affords 110 .safe anchorage. It may l>c remarkell that tlte Japanese junk whose wreck in 1871 attractctl mnch attention, w;1s <a"t asho1·c llerc, and not on tbc north shore of the island, !\S has bcc11 currently i·eported. Our positions accor<led tolerably well with tbe charts, on which, ltowevN, tile sltorn-line, liay, and islarnls, are very iusufficientiy delineated.
A.'fKA.

On onr way to Atkn, we observed that tbo positions of the Yolcanic crater-islands of Kasatoch i mHl Koningi do not agree with the positions on Gibson's chart; one or the other befog out in lnti· tude a mile or two.

'l'he l1arlJor of Atka, in Nazan Day, was examined in regard to its capacity for a telegraphic Matim1, and the conclusion which I arrive.cl at was unfavorallle, as the bay is full of reefs and rocks the bottom irregular, and the harbor but second-rate. Bad weather set in here, and we could outain no ouservation~ for latitude, and, with the greatest difficulty, those for azimuth and time. I ol>tained a skin-canoe and two natives, and crossed the islaml to Korovinsky Bay for ti.le purpose of examining that locality and the deposits of coal said to exist in the vicinity. I found the harbor, nearly useless, having silted up within quite a recent period, so that not more than twelve feet can be carried oYer the bar at half tide. In the southeast corn<.'r of the ua;y, howeyer, a. good harbor existR, well sheltered, and with good holding-ground in nine fathoms. This locality is known as Martin's llarbor, haviug first been entered aud subsequently used by Capt. Martin Klinkofstrifo1 of the Hussian American Company's service. It is marked as Saml Da.y on some cl1arts. Thero arc a number of rocks bare at ordinary tides, oft' shore, in Korovinsky Bay, which are not 011 ans chart, and whicll might 11ick up a vessel attempting to enter in the night. I exmnined the so-called coal-min, an<l found it to consist of fragments of ulack silicided wood, irregnlitdy dispersed in the face of a bluff of crumbling sandstone. After a fatiguing climb and walk, I reached the celebrated solfataras, or hot springs, of the KJu. cheffskaia Volcano. They are about six miles from the coast in a ravine on the side of the volcano. 'fhe outlets of hot water are quite numerous, bnt no geyser-action was observed. Tiley have a temperature of 192° Fahrenheit, and contain lime, s1llphnr, an(l alum; the latter is abnuuantly deposited aronnd tlie spriugs, together with a limy earth of very bright red, yellow, and slaty colors. The Hnssians had a house, bath-house, &c., here for invalids; but the buildings are ·in ruins. A hrowa leathery fucoid grew abundantly in the hot water, and the neighboring vegetation seemed little ntiectcd by the steam and hot water at its very roots. Two villages exist on Atka, wlth one on the adjacent end of Amlin. These, with that at Attn, are t.hc only villages west of Umnak.

ISLANDS OF TIIE FOUR CUA'l'ERS.

On reaching this group, we hard!.)· recogni:wtl it, so entirely ditferent are the ishw<ls in po~itit)ll and form from anything delineated on the charts. A Yery liea\'Y sea was running·, though tlw weather was fiuc, amt it was impossible to effect a landing. There were no appl'ara1wm; of an_ytlting like a haruor or anchorage. - \Ve cruised about the h;lauds for so:nc time, seekiu~ a shelter or lauding-place, lJut found none. Contrary to the charts, one island, perhaps Chugoala of tl1e eadier charts, stands bul11ly to the northwan1 of tlle others, aml is separated from auotlH'r l1y a narrow rocky strait. South of tlrnse, se1mr~.teu lly a strait sever~tl miles wide, was a larger island, with an almost uubrokeu northerly shore, ending ia a Iuug 11arr0\r point to tlw 1r<;st1rn.n! \Ye saw a im111llcr of rocks abo,·o water, lmt uo edtlences of sub:ne1rgell reef!<. Tlte positwu ol' the group, as a whole, agrees with the cliarts.
AGASRAGOii.

Tllis ishiml, otherwise known as Saint John the Theologian, or Joanna Bogosh),-a in tltL' Hussian language, lias always lleen of peculiar interest. Hising from the sea on St. John's Da~-, 11!1:.!, it was sm·n\yetl in some shape uy Sar,ycheff before 1836, and on liis chart is rC'presented as a mile and three-quarters long, with several Tocks about it, and numerous soundings, iuclnding a i·eef or 1mbmerged rocks extending from it to the north end of Umnak. Very conflicti11g statements ha\e beeu matle as to its height antl position and as to the existence of the great reef. Liitkc appears to luwe been tlic only liytlrographer who has approximated to its true positio11, as will l>e seen by ref ercnce to tl10 accompan,ying table of positions. I stated the grounds for my disbelief in the existence of the reef in my report of last year, antl our olJservations this season completely sustain the position I took in regard to it. They also show the gross errors of 8arycheff's chart, a111l imggest that the conflicting sttttements referred to, are due to erroneous obsen'ations rather than to any gre~tt changes of leYel in tho island itself. The Ship Rock and ouc otlier rock near to it have al>out the same relative position and height that are assigned to them lly Saryclwff, and ;\'l·t tile alJsolute length of the island does not exceed three-quarters of a mile. Had any snbsi<lenco snilicient to produce these differences of size in the main island taken place, one at least of the rocks alJove mentioned would have been entirely submerged, and to a considerable depth. Our sonu(lings directly on the line of the submerged reef show no bottom at 800 fathoms, aml we were ouly we Yented from rnnning out all the line at our disposal lly tlie heavy sea rnnniug at the time. The islantl is a sharp, serrated ridge, forming a Yer.r .acute angle, and broken into numerous pi1mades 'towartl the top, an<l it would seem impossible to scale it. There is no low land about it, and a 1atuli11g cannot be efl'ected except in Yery calm weather. Coutrary to the received opinion, there is uo cmter, nor any appearance of a crater. The island is simply a jagged mass of rock upbean\d through some channel by volcanic ejection. At the distance from which we saw it, it nppearell ot a H.,.bt piukish-gray color, totally dcYoid of yegetation or \"rater, and covereu with myria<ls of llirus. 'l'lt~~:e are a few breakers off the south end of it, and a. talus, ou wllieli a luu<liug nuder fayornl1\c circumstances might I.le effected. A htrge portion of the shore is, liowever, precipitous. Ship Rock is a perpendicular square topped pillar, half a mile north aud west of the north 1.m1l of the island. There is a small rock, also gi,-en in Sarycheff's cliart, half a mile north and east of the island which rises only a fow feet above the water; and on all sides (except the west), and especially east.southeast of the island, scattereLl breakers were ollsened, extending less than three-qnarterf'. of a mile from tlie shore. I·'rom numerous ol>servations, tlle height of the summit appears to be 811 feet.

HEPORT OF TUE SUPERINT,ENDENT OP

The 110;.;ition is farther to tlw north aud east than any of the charts place it, while none of tlwm agree; enm two iu Tebcukoff's atlas differ nearly a mile, one having the reef inuicatcd auu the otlier not, though both bear the same uate.
UN.A.LASIIKA.

Cl'bc work do11c here chicliy relateu to the determination of the azimuth and the continuation of tile triangulation and s111·,·ey of Captain's Bay, commenced in 1871. Ulrnadok Islaml was surYeyeu entirely; its po::iitiou fix:ed by triangulation, as were tlle remarkable Keedle J~ock on the west side of A.maknak, and tlw east and west heatls of Captain's Bay. The latter pro\Tetl of more than usnal interest, showing that on chart No. 7 of the Coast Survey Atlas of Harbor Charts of Alaska, the east bead is placed fully a mile too far south and west, and the west head nearly as much too far north, while a careful examination of the chart itself show:,; that in these particulars it does not agree with the obsernttious of P1·ofossor Davidso11's party iu 18o7, tlwugli evon these fall short of our determinations, mTeu when correcteu for the latest deter. mination of the longitude from Sitka. In these respects this chart compares vt.1ry unfavora bl,r with that or Kotzelme (180!), from which it was principally taken; and that of Kotzebue still remainl:l the most accurate delineation of Captain's Bay which has yet been published.
SANNAKH REEFS.

Om ohsenations determining a new cod-bank in this vicinity were forwarde ll to you in the spring. At tlte same time, we determined the extent above water in an easterly and southerly di rec· tion of tl1c nort.lieastern and southern terminations of this formidable congeries of re efs. The positions gfre nearly the same extent respectively that is gi\'Cn for the entire reef on the old cliart of the Hussian aumiralty office, but it is probable that the submerged rocks cxtenu some distance farther, especially to the south. Our position places the group some miles farther sontll and east than tha,t of Teuenkoff; and this difference may account for part of the clifterence ascribed to current by navigators who have sailed by Tebenkoff's charts.
POPOFF STRAI'l'.

OL1r obscn·ations here were limited to those for position aud azimuth, which, on account of bad weather, we could not obtain last season. We wern also enabled to correcb an error iu t!Jc position of one of the small islands in the strait to the south of our surve;y. 'Ve have beeu informed most positively that rocks above water exist to the south and west of Simeonoff Island, as was stated on similar authority in my last report; but the bacl weather pre· nmted ns from verifying this statement. Humboltlt Harbor, since our survey, has been greatly frequented by vessels, aud I am cont.in. milly aJlplied to for tracings of our manuscript chart of the strait and the Shurnagin group, which reqnests, from obetlience to the rules of the Survey, I have been reluctantly obliged to refuse.
CURRENT·OBSERV.ATIONS.

Our current-o!Jservations were continuously carried

011

as usual. The

o\<~ercast

weather, l.tow-

onir, prm'ented mau,y observations of position on the return voyage, and heuce the observations on that trip are very limited. Our up-voyage observations confirmed those of previous ~·ea.rs; lmt t!Je rate of the currents ·was manifestly interfered with by the strong,aud constant westerly wintls. In Bering Sea, uotwitllstanding constant obsen'ations, I .find nothing to modify my remarks iu last year's report. Tb.e arctic character of the fauna in the western islands, and the cowparatiwly 10\v temperature of the sea-water, would lead to the inference that that portion of the Kuro-siwo wL.icb enters Berillg Sea is comparatively cbilleu, or else of little importance eornparecl with the Arctic or Kamdiatka current. We have definitely settled that the tide entering Bering Sea from the Pacific is invariably propagated from the east toward the west; that no effiux: of importance takes pla-ce with the fall of the tide; aml that the latter retains its compound and irregular character throughout the isla.uds.

Perhaps the most interesting feature ot our work tllis ;rear has been the determining of tht· magnetic declination at stations, at nearly equal intervals from eacl1 othei·, from the Shmuagius to the western end of tLe islands. OJ course, from the great leugtll of time wliieL La,; elapse1l since observations of this nature were taken in the islands to tLe west\..,,.anl, no clew is alfortlcd as to wltethcr the declination Las been increasing or decreasiug during that period) or any particular portion of it; or tLe rate at wllicb tLe changes liaYe occurred. From tlie ohservatious of Professor Davidson's party in 1867, Kaelin in lSG!J, and ours, this season, at Unalashka, it seems likely that at present the declination is decreasing iu its amount of easting-. This is rendered still more probable uy the detection at the Presidio station, Sau Francisco, of a similar change, Yery recently. At Unalashka, our obse1Tatio11s were repeated until we became satisfied that they contaiuetl ·only such an amount of error as might reasonably be referred to the charnctor of the instruments usetl. The main result bas been to show a decrease of tLe easterls Yariation at all stations where observations have been taken, wllcu our results were compared \Yith tLosc heretofore published. H,t>jecting such changes as are e\·ideutly due to tlieory, unsupported by observations on rcconl (and such occL1r in some of the cl!arts examined), the diminution is about as follows:

MEASl'REMENT OF A PRIMARY BASE-LINE ON PEACH-TREE RIDGE, NEAR ATLANTA, GEORGIA, 1X t8i2 AND 1873, BY C. 0. BOUTELLE, ASSISTANT.-COMPUTED A~D HEPORTED BY CHARLEB A. SCHOTT ASSISTANT. '

.A reconnaissance for the location of a primary base-line in Georgia or South Carolina, for the principal triangulation rnnning along the Blue Ridge, was made in January, 1872, by Assistant J. A. Sullivan, under the direction of Assistant C. 0. Boutelle, and resulted in the selection of a site on Peach-Tree Ridge, in De Kalb and Gwinnett Counties, Georgia, about fifteen miles northeast of .Atlanta,, Ga. The summit of the ridge is narrow and crooked; on it a line of about 5.8 miles in length was found within practicable grades and suitable terminal points for connection with tbe primary triangulation. The maximum slope for measure was fixed at abont 40, being 10 greater than bad ever been attempted before, yet. within the proper limits the apparatus wouhl bear. After inspection and approval by the Superintendent, the site was adopted, and subsequently measured three times. Ne::ir the southern end is a deep but narrow ravin<', which the line had to cross on a grade about 6 meters above ground. Everywhere else the grades were within 3 meters of the surface. The ground consists of loam and clay; about 70 per cent. of the line lay in woodland. The gulch near the south end was crossed on trestle-work, consisting of two separate strnctures, e~tch solidly braced with uprights covered by capsills, resting on which were string-pieces and sleepers for, the floors. The whole was 4! meters wide, and built on a descending slope of 30 35'; it proved aoundantly stable. The measure was secured at each point of stoppage by a transfer to firm ground, for which purpose a portable transit was set up perpendicular to the line of the base. About 7~ meters off the line, a needle-drill-bole was made in a copper tack, placed vertically under the end of the agate of the tube. Hollows were crossed with the tubes high on the trestles, crests with the tubes low, for the purpose of diminishing the slope. A station in aud near the middle of tLe base was occupied for astronomical latitude and azimuth. It is in approximate latitude 33° 54'.4, in approximate longitude 840 lW.6 west of Greenwich, an(l the azimuth of the southwest end of the base is about 520 8'. The approximate elevation above the sea-level is 330 meters. It is the seventh line measured with the primary apparatus. The southwest and the northeast ends of the base are each marked by a granite monument, with an upper and lowe1· drill.hole mark in copper bolts. Each monument is surrounded by four side-monuments'.: two in the line of the base and two at right angles to it. There are in the line of tbe base five smaller granite posts, like those surrounding the terminal monuments; they were intended to take the place of the usual (->o-called) mile-stones in the older base-lines; these are placed in suitable positions on crests of ridges; they have a copper bolt with drill-hole, and are respectively distant from the southwest terminus 273, 547, 753 (middle base), 9i8, and 1276 tubes, each ot' nea.dy 6 meters. The whole number of tubes of the measure is 1558. The first and second measures being performed in opposit.e directions, it was expected that any effect in the resulting length due to difference of slope would become apparent. Tltese measures were made in fall and winter: the first between November 8, 1872, and December 5, 1872; the second between December 5, 1872, and January 9, 1873. But the third measure was made in summ.er, hetween July 31 1 1873, and August 21, 1873, in order to test to the utmost the quality of the tubes respecting their compensation for different temperatures and during rapid changes _of temperature. Comparisons of the tubes with the standard bar were made immediately before tbe commencement of the first measure and during this measure ; again, soon after the close of the second measure. A more elaborate comparison was had with the standard immersed in glycerine, the better to ascertain its temperature before the third measure; also during it and after its close. The length of the iron standard bar, which was cut to length in Marcli, 1847, is 5m,9999407 ± om.0000009 at oo C. (for whieh see Coast Survey Report for 1862, Appendix No. 26.) Its: co-efficient

of expansion was ascertained to be 0.00000641 ±0.00000002 (vide same rE>port); both determinations having been made by Assistant J. E. Hilgard. The co-efficient answers between the li111its of 320 and 100° Fall. The baris consequently 6 meters in length at a temperature of 330,54 Fah. ± 00.025 Fab., expressed in terms of the original committee meter of the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia. Comparisons, made in 1867, at Paris, by Dr. Barnard and Mr. Tresca,* showed its length equal to 1.00000336 meter of the archives at the temperature of freezing water. Since all base-lines of the Coast Survey and all its computations have this committee meter for their unit of length, t that of the Atlanta base will also be expressed in terms of the same, in order that all reductions Lereafter desired may apply systematically to all measures. Before entering upon the detailed ac.count of the operations and results of the base, a few words respecting the condition of the base-apparatus will find a proper place here, especially since the mod(! of treatment in the reduction of the various measures in some degree bad to couferm to existing conditious, as developed IJy the comparisons themselves. Though the apparatus was descri~d and figured in Coast Surrny Heport of 1854, Appendix No. 35, the present scarcity of this report made it desirable to reproduce the plates illustrating its construction in detail. (See Plate No.18.) lVith the exception of two changes-one due to an accident, the other one of designthe apparatus has remained materially in the same condition as when constructed in 1845 and 1846 by lllr. W. "\Viirdemann (under the direction of Superintendent A. D. Bache). At Key Biscayne, during tlle measure of a base in 1855, one of the agates of Tube No. 1 was splintered, and a new one was substituted. This same tube was supplied with a new agate iu 1872, owing to a defective · knife-edge in the old agate. Tube 1, up to the accidental breakage of the agate, and Tube 2, up to this period (after the measure of the Atlanta base), when it became desirable to thoroughly examine the apparatus and repair such parts as showed signs of wear, both had evidently become shorter, partly it is supposed from wearing, partly from change of form; and it appeared also of late that there were reasous for doubting that the compensation had remained as perfect as it 'was at first. Advantage was taken at the same time to introduce some improvements, notably a Borda differential thermometer, by means of which, together with the immersion of the stan~ard in glycerine during the field-comparisons, it is confidently expected that a much greater accuracy in the measured length of a base can be attained than has been found practicable heretofore. For determining the length of the tubes at the time of the measures of the base, we ha"\"'e the following data: The value of one turn of the abutting.screw of the Saxton reflecting-comparator was found by n'1wated eomparisons (in June, 1857) of five turns of the screw with a magnitude of 0.1 of an inch derived from tLe Trough ton yard-scale; it equals 0.01912 ± 0.00004 inch, or 0.48565 ::!:: 0.00102 millimeter. During the comparisons for length, there were used six standard Casella and three Green thermometers, which were corrected for errors of graduation from special comparisons made in February and March, 1873. Another set of six Green thermometer~, with metallic scales, used in connection with the comparisons in glycerine, and for the third measure, were also tested in July, 1873, and corrected for graduation errors. In the Casella thermometers, the maximum correction at any one temperature is 0°.3; in the Green thermometers, it rises to 0.5 Fah. The value of one division of the scale of the comparator twas determined by means of the known value of one turn of the abuttiug-screw, and found from a large number of sets of comparisons of whole turns and of fractions of turns for various parts of the screw and for various temperatures. Four sets of observations in Nowmber, 1872, and January, 1873, give 1div.=1.384 ± 0.003 micron at 40° Fah. (one micron= one millionth of a meter), and 1dh'.=1.378 ::!:: 0.003 micron at
6()6

Fah.

Again, seven sets of observations in July and Septmber, 1873, girn 1 div.= 1.376 ± 0.003 micron, wllich last value was used in connection with the third measure of the base. The minute" See Coast Survey Report of 1867, Appendix No. 7. t The.substitution of the meter of tho archives would prodnoo an increase of14.6 units in the 11eventh plae& of decimals in the logarithm of the length of the Atlanta base. tA deseription of this instrument will be found in the report of the Superintendent of Weights and :Measures Senate Executive Document No. Zl, Thirty-fourth CongrEl8!1, third session, Washington, 1857, p. 16.

ness of this unit may be judgetl of by the fact that the expansion of the standard bar for 10 :Fall. equals 38.46 ::!:: 0.12 microns, or 27.956 ::!:: 0.084 scale-divisions. We have also one turn of the screw =350.9 scale-clivisions at temperatures near 400 Fah. = 352.3 scale-didsions at temperatures near 660 Fah. =353.06 ::!:: 0.18 divisions at 320.5 Fall. in connection with the last measure. A very large number of direct comparisons of the tubes and standard were made at temperatures a8 nearly stationary as was practicable, or only slowly rising or falling, aml for au absolute range between 320 and 1000 Fab. In the reduction, care was taken, by miing alternate means of ·allowing as far as possible for change of length during comparison of tu he and standard; and it may be noted that in the earlier comparisons they were made by passing-, in succession, throngh the com· parator the standard, Tube 1 and Tube 2, which process was changed in the obserrntions in con· nection with the third measure to takiug flrn successiYe readings on each before changing bar or tube. In the following synopsis of results for length of tubes, the Yalues are given arranged according to temperature of the standard for the comparisons in air, nnd of the tnbes for those iu glycerine, beginning with the lowest and ending with the highest. The column headed "n" contains the number of indfridual comparisons iu each set; the colmnn headed "Cou." indicates the condition of the temperature with respect to "rising", '' falliug~', or "stationary"; the colutllllK headed "T1 (III)n and "T2" contain the resnl~ing lengLh of the first and second tubes, expn."sscd in meters, and derived from the known length of the standard at its temperature of comparison, and from the measured difterence of length of it and the tubes in each experiment.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDE1'.TT OF

It is evident from the a born tables that the tubes expand slightly with increasing temperaturesin other words, that they are ~-nder-compensated,-a fact which was already suspected in January, 1864, when the differential co-efficient of expansion was roughly made out between 0.0000002 and
0.0000009.

The above results, when projected in a diagram, further indicated that the compensation for changes of temperature was still close,-tbat is, about 21 parts of 22 remained compensated between the range of temperature from 320 to 71 o Fah.; but, between temperatures ranging from 71° to 100° Fah., the tubes only compensated about IO parts in 11. This break of continuity about the tern.· perature 710 Fah. may be explained by the fact that when the apparatus was taken to pieces and examined in March, 1875, it was found that the two knife-edges of each lever had worn or hammered (during transportation to and from the base) grooves into the vertical ahntting-plates deep enough to he felt when running the nail across them. The results for le11gth of tubes are somewhat obscured by the effect of rising or falling temperatures during the comparisons, and the probable error of the length assigned for the whole base-line is materially increased by the fact that there are more sets with rising than with falling temperatures. For tube 1, we obtain 9 conditional equations for the co-efficient n, in the two equationsT1 with rising temperature= 6m.o000023 a, (t - 450.5} T 1 with falling temperature= 5m,9999970 + a 1 ( t - 580.7) the absolute terms arising from combination to a mean of 5 comparisons between 32° aud 71° with risiug, and of 4 with falling temperatures. Similarly, for Tube 2, we find a value for the co-efficient a 11 in the equationsT2 with rising temperature= 5rn,9996529 + a 11 (t - 45°.8) T 2 with falling temperature= 5m,9996426 + a11 (t - 58°.4J and taking the mean of the constant terms, the following expressions for the length of each tube were finally established, answering between temperatures 32° aml 71°, and conseqnently to be employed in the computation of the first and second measnres : Length of Tube 1(III)=5m,9999997 + om.000001873 (t-520.l) Length of Tube 2 = 5m,9996478,+ om.000002688 (t-520.1) with the probalile errors :±: om.0000144 and ::!:: om.0000193 respectively. For use in connection with the computation of tlie thin] measure at lligh temperatures, we ham similarly, from tlrn second part of our tableT1 with rising temperature= ()m.0001110 + b, (t - 870.4) T1 with falling temperature= 6"'.0000582 + b,(t- 750.8) with b, from 15 equations, temperature rising, and 5, temperature falling; anll b11 from an equal number of equations for Tube 2, viz:Tz with rising temperature= 5m,9U97513 + b11 (t- 880.3) Tz with falling temperature= 5m,9997094 b" (t - 750,7) Hence-Length of Tube 1 (III) = 6m.0000846 oru.00000530 (t - 81o.6) Length of Tube 2 = 5m.9997303 + 0. 01 00000445 (t- 820,0) with the probable errors T ::!:: om.0000112 and ::!:: om.0000116 respectively. The above probable errors were made out irrespective of t-emperatures rising or falling, in order to include any defect that may arise from it. The following table contains, for each of the three measures of the base separately, and for each snbclivisiou of it by the middle and line monuments, first~ the mean temperature of measure (thermometers corrected for graduation-error); secondly, the mean length of Tubes 1 {III) and 2 from the above expressions a1ul for the temperature of measure; thirdly, the number of such mean tubes or of single tubes ; fourthly, the total resulting length ; fifthly, the correction for inclination of tu bes (also rellnced to the temperature of measure); and, lastly, the resulting horizontal distance measured between, the marks near the monuments.

The minimum temperature during which any one set of tubes was laid was 18°.2 Fah. (the mean of 6 thermometers), and many tubes were laid with the temperature below the freezing-point of water. The maximum temperature during which any one set of tubes was laid was 1070.1 Fab.; and many were laid with the temperature of the air above 1000. The maximum inclination of a tube laid was 40 43'; and there were a great man.r with inclinations of 40, An impression of the ruggedness of the profile of the base may be cou veyed by the fact that the sum-total of the corrections for inclination amounts to 110 less a le,ngth than 10m.:i2123 in the first, and to 1om.03754 in the last measure. The preceding distances, as measured between the sites of the monuments, require to ue reduced to them as finally marked, according to the following statements in the record: The first measure started from assumed southwest monument, fixed sites for positions of monuments I, II, middle, V, and VI, and fell short of positiou of northeast monument 1m.45695, as measured with the 0. S. Lenoir brass meter at 560.4 Fah. Applying the correction for length and for expansion, this measured distance becomes lm.45728. The second measure started from end of Tube 1558, or from the exact spot where the first measure bad terminated; end of tube near V fell north or short of mark ()tn,01235; end of tube near IV fell north of mark om.00145; end of tube near 1\I fell south or beyond mark om.0139Ei; eud of tube near II fell south of mark ()m,()3475; end of tube near I fell south of mark om.09425 ; and near southwest monument the second measur.e fell south, or beyond the starting-point of tlle first measure, Qm.10670. The third measure stal'ted from .southwest monument, as in first; near I, forward end of tube fell &n.04455 north of mark or beyond first measure; near II, end of tube fell north of mark om.09000; near M, end of tube fell om.13705 north of mark ; near IV, end of tube fell om.21840 north; and, near V, end of tube foll om.30005 north of mark. The distance between end of tube and the northeast monument was im.05635 at !i50 Fah., or tm.05688 when corrected; also, end of Tube 1558 fell om,40010 north of end of tube in first (and second) measure.

The table sho-vs a maximmn deviation in results of about one in a million. The frequent cl1ange in sign of the aboV"e discrepancies is taken as a fayorable indication that the lengths of the tu hes have been correctly assigned; and the general accord of the three individual measures among themselves must be taken as a severe test of the accuracy of the co-efficient of expansion of the standard-bar as determined in 1860. To obtain the requisite data for the reduction of the measnred base to its length at the sealevel, the following h,nlsometi·ic operations were undertaken: The base was le>eled by spirit-level in .April, 1872, and again in July, 1873. At southwest, middle, and northeast stations, double zenith-distances were measured to the primar:y-triangulation station, Stone Mountain. At Stone Mountain, double zenith-distances were measured to each of the three points of tlie base. A line of spirit-levelings was C<'trriecl from Stone Mountain to the city of Augasta, Ga .. in Decemher, 1873, and January, 187'!. Between Augusta and Port Royal Sound, the leYelings of the railroad-engineers were made use of; lastly, the Port Royal and Beaufort, S. O., levelings were connected directly \'\'itb tidal obserYations, giYiug the following re1mlts :

The somewhat inferior accnmcs rcacbe<l iu the first and sec(md measures, when compared with the accmacy of tlle o1der basn-lines, may lie mainly attribute<l to deterioration in the apparatus from wear.

The final accuracy, tlic greatest reachctl in any of our base-lines, is of course <1ue to the fact that three measm·es wnc made, which is believed. to be unequaled in the history of geo<1esic operations. If we attempt to deduce a prnbable ermr of the b:tse from the differences of each measured part compared with its mean, which would include all errors except those arising from the trnce1·. tainty of the standard, we should find, a ftt'r allo\\"ing for tlw latter, the probaule errors ± ~m"'.()9, ± ~"'"'.9:J, awl ±-1"11" . l O, respectin~l_y, for the three measures.

The main essentials for a base-measuring apparatus are c111l1t·acC'd in tbe following general conditions: I. The extreme point's of the apparatus used :<s 11wasuri ug-limit." must, maier all circumi,;tances of operation, remain at au invariable distance from each other, or the corrections for variations in this distance must be capable of easy ::tllll accurate determi11atio11. Ir. The distance between the measuring-limits must he comp<tred witl1 the staudanl unit of length to the last degree of atfainiiblc aceuracy, and its precis<J Ieugth so determine·!. III. In t,he apparatus, the necessary parts aud constructions for its eas,Y and 'safe transportation, firm support~ accurate contacts or coincidence,.,, for slope-measurmnents, and also all re11uisite auxiliaries to the se\·eral adjustment-mauipnlations, must be so pnwidetl aud comuined as to gfre the whole a union of portability, conYenience, and delicac_r. The Coast Snrn'.Y appa.ra.tus, as it now stands, was di.wised with spechil regard to all tlw conditions for extreme accuracy au<l cou venieuce in the field. Some sligltt modifications, indicated lly experience i11 its mm during- the measnrt:'ment of three base-lines, ha\·e since been embodied: but, iu the main, the apparatus remains unaltered from toe plaus devised by Professor Baclle in 1845, and ex:ecuted, utuler his directiou, in 184-5 and 1846, by !\fr. \Yilliam \Yii.rdemann, then 111edmuicia11 of tlw Coast Snrn~y, to whom many of the details of arrangement are uue. It may here be statPd that the experience of three base-line measurements with this apparatus bas fully shown it to he ;1 highly satisfactory solution of the prol>lem proposed, aml it has been found to excel alike iu accuracy, economy, and facility of use. A base-line being dulJ' reconnoitered, opened, and graded, and monuments being fixed for the permanent presen·ation of its extremities, or the ba8e sLatio11-pni11t1', the measurement proper proceeds. The apparatus sent to the field for this purpose, when a primar_y base is to be finally measured, cousists of the following parts: 1. Two measuring-tubes, exactly alike, each being packed for tmnsportation in a wooden box. 2. Six trestles for supporting and adjusting the tubes, three being fore-tn>stles and three rear-trestles, each of which is packed for transportation in a three-sided wooden box. 3. Eight or more iron foot-plates, on which to support the trestles; and a woodeu frame i8 afterward made, to se1Te as a guide in Ja,ying uown the foot-plates. 4. Manipulatiug-handles for the adjustments; a theodolite for making the alignment, and for occasionally referring the tube-eud to stakes driven for the purpose; also some minor auxiliaries. 5. A standard six-meter bar of iron, in its wooden case, arranged for comparisons, and a Saxton's pyrometer, arraiiged for indicating minute variations in length. Tile measuring-tubes are carefully compared with the staudard bar before beginning the measurement, and again after its completion, to make i,;ure of the exact condition of the somewhat complex mechanism in the measuring-tubes. For these field-comparisons, the pyrometer is sim. plified, by causing the bar or tube undergoing comparison to abut against the spherical head of an arm, springing llorizontitlly from the vertical axle, to which is attached the mirror for reflecting tile remote arc-graduations into the telescope fixed on this arc. Variations or inequalities of the bars examined act on the arm, and thus turn the mirror, causing it to reflect the corresponding arcrcading into the telescope. A spring is so arranged as to make the arm-head press with a constant pressure against the bar-end. '\Vben the comparison with the standard is completed, the foot.plates are successively 11laced by the aid of the wooden spacing-frame, which gives au approximate distance and alignment. ]four trestles are so placed and leveled on these plates that the three foot-screws of each rest in three radial gz.·ooyes of the plates. The two tubes are then mounted on their trestles, and, the rear extremity h~wing been adjusted vertically over the station-point, the fore-tube is theu adjusted to make a contact with the rear-tube extremity by means of a level of contact. Both tubes have to be first aligned by the aid of a theodolite adYanced some distance on the line or following the measurement, in the field of which two st.anding sights, one on each tube, are made to oover.

This pri11ciple was i111lepentle11tly applied to the construction of b:tse-apparatns, 1·omposcd of two bars, one of brass all(l one of iron, counected hy a lm'er of' compensation at their cuds, first b,Y Colonel Colby, in the Ordnance Sun·ey of Irelarnl in 18'.!7 (see Captain Yolland'::; Lough Fo~-Ic B11se, p. 10); and again by J\lr. Borde11, of Fall Hiver, in the Massachusetts Surn·.v, dllring tlw winter of 1830. (See Palfre_y's T<tbles, Survey of Mass., p. 1; Am. 1~ltil. Trans., vol. ix, p. 34; and N. Am. l{eY., Oct., 1845, pp. 458-461.) 1\Ir. Borden made no proYision for causing the two bars in hi8 apparatus to cltauge their temperatures at the same rate, though his tin tnlmlar an:iugement admirably checks the fre·1ueucy autl rapidity of such changes ai,; in practice they 11111;.;t undergo. Colonel Colby attempted, by tile aid of n1rni:she:s aml lampblack coatings, as tixed by numerous. experiments in 18~7, to make both bal'S maintain the same tempernture during tbe changes of su_rroundin!r heat. He made both bars of the same cross-section, and thought, by regn latiug the surface-radiation arul absorption, to effect the required eqnalizatiou of rate for heating and cooling. His method, though giving a good approximation, is radically fault-yin uot taking tlte specific heats and conducting powers of' the bars into the account. Tbe method first iutrmlucetl and originated by Professor Bache is capable of insuring a very perfoct eqnalit::ation of temperature in the two bars. By numerous experiments in 1845 and 184G, he so arranged the cross-sec· tious of the bars as that, while the two have equal absorbing su:-face, their masses arc inver:sely as their specific heats, allowance being made for their different conducting powers. Thus, while each receives the same accession of heat in a giyen time, the temperature of the two will continue equal, because, except for the conducting rates, their masses are inversely as their specific lieats. The s:tme varnish on both surfaces gives them equal absorbent powers. The last minute adjustment of compensation was effected by making one surface slightly more absorbent tha,n the other, as required by circumstances. Thus, as both bars vary essentially together, the point of compeusation is never shifted by their diverse actions under thermal variations. A bar of brass and a bar of iron, each less than six meters long, are supported parallel to each o~her, and, at one end, are so firmly connected together by means of an end-block, iu which each bar is mortised and strongly screwed, as there to preserve au unalterable relation. The brass bar, which has the largest cross-section is sustained on rollers mounted in suspending stirrups; and

the iron bar rests on small rollers, which are fastened to the iron bar, aud n111 on the brass oue. Supporting-screws through the sides of the stirrups are mljustt>tl to sustain the lmrs in p1acc, arid also serve to rectify them. Thus, while the two lxu·s are relafrrnly fixed at one eud, they are elsewhere frep to move, aml hence the entire expansions aud contractions are manifested at the free end. The medium of couuection lletwcen the free enrls of the two bars is the le1·e1· (!l compensation, which isjoi11etl to the lower or brass bar b,v a binge-pin, arouncl which it turns llnriug changes of' temperatitre.. A steel plane 011 tlw end of the irou bar abuts against aa agate knife-edge ou the inuer side of the IC\-cr of compe11satio11. This lever terminates in a knifo-edge, tnrned outwartl at such ~t distance from the center piu and the other knifo-e<lg·e bearing, that the cud edge will remain mimo\'ed by equal changes of tempeniture iu the two b~trs. The end edge presses aga.iust a steel face in a loop matle in the sliding-rod. 'I'his roll slides in a frame fastened to the top of the iron bar, and passes through a spiral spring, which acts with a constant force to press. tbe loop against the knife-edge. The outer end of the 8liding-rotl bears the limiting agate pla1w. Tims the end agate is 110t affected i11 position us the expansions of tbe brass aud iron, acting as the)- do at proportional distances along the lcn~r of compensation, measured from its slitling end 1.Jearing.

This consists of a hol'izont.al aml a vertical plate of boiler-iron, joinc~l alo11g the rnilldle line of the horizontal sheet by two angle·iro11s, all being pennaueutly riveted. Circnla.r openings are cnt out from both plates to liglttc11 them as mllch as practie:tllle. A conti11nous iron tie-plate, turned llp in a trough-form, co1111ccts the bottoms or all the stirrups.

At its inner cud, tllis sliding-rod rests against a cylindrical surface on toe npright lC1'cr of c<mtact, i-;o mounted as at its bottom to tur11 around a. binge-pin. At top, this le\·er rests against a tongue, or drop-lever, descending from tllc middle of the lt:rcl of coutact, which is mouutl·d on tr1mnio11s.* 'I'he slidiugrnd, when forced ngainst the r;itle of the leYcr of coutact, prcsset> it:s top ngainst the tongue of the ]eve!, and thus tnrns the kYel by overcoming a preponderance of weight ginm to its farther end, to insure the cmitact being always at a constant prC'ssnre betwN~ll the flgates, the snme force being alwn,vs requin><l to bri11g the bubble to the cenkr. . Tbe sectol' is a solid mdal plate, mounted with it1o; eeuter of' motion in the line of the sli<liugrnd, and having its arc graduated from a central zero to the limit!'! of asceudiug a11d descending slopes on which-the apparatus is to lJe used. A fixed Yernier in contact with the arc gives the slope-rt>adings. A lo11g len~l and lm\Jble-scale are so attached and adjusted to the face of the sector-plat<~ that the zeros of the lm·el and of the limb correspond to the horizontal position of the whole tuhe. If, then, on slopes, the bubble be brought to the middle by raisiug or lowering the are end of the sPctor (a mon'ment maue by a tangent-screw, whose milled bead }lrojeets above the tiu case of the tube), the rnrnier will gt\'e the slo1)e at which the tube is inclined, and the sloping measure is readily 1·educe<l to the horizontal by means of a table 11repal'ed for the purpose. The lernl of contact and the Ien'r of contact, with their appendages, are all mounted on the sector and partake of its motions. A knife-etlgc end of the sliding-l'(}d presses ou the cylindrical face of the contact-lever, this cylinder being concentric with the sector, and the sector can therefore be turned without deranging the contact. In fact, the contacts are made with the sector-level horizontal, thus insuring the accuracy of the contact-pressure. The contact-lever is supported at bottom by

two braces dropping down from the sector-plate, and a s.pring, acting on a pin iu tlw h·yer, steadies A bracket from tlrn sector-plate rccei,·es the trunnions of the contact-level. A 1miall screw projects from the end of the tube to clamp or owt the lcn·r and lt>vel of contact against a pin in the sector for security in transportation. \Vhat is called the fine motion, reriufred for adjusting tlle contacts betweeu the successirn tnbPs, is prodnce<l by means of a cornpensatiug· rod or tube, one end of which is attached t0 the trussframe by a bracket over the rear trestle, aml the other recciYes a screw terminating in a pr~jecting milled beat.I. This screw tnrns freely in a collar, hearing, by a projectiug arm, against the crosi:<bar which joius the main brass and "iron bars, and its nut is in the end of the cornpe11sation-roll. Ry turni11g tlte screw in one tlirectiou~ tlte liars are pushl·d forward, and the opposite turniug pt·1·mits a spiral spring, arranged for the purpose, to push hack the s.n1tem of bars, which slides through its supports. Thus the contact is made by turniug tLe screw until the contact-Im-el is horiwntal. The com1)ensating-rotl is composed of scYcral concentric tnlws, alternately of brass aud iron, arrangell one witllin the other, and fastened at opposite cuds alternately. Thus, wll('H a coutact. has been made by the .tine-motion screw, cha11ges of temperature will not produce derang<·me11t~ as would !Je the case if this rod weTe 11ot eompcnsating. 't'he arrangement permits tlrn obsen·er conveniently to work the fine-n1Qtion screw, autl to observe its action on the contact-l('H'l. The apparatus thus described is inclosed in a double tin tubular case; diaphragms being adapted for supporting and strengthening the whole. 'l'hc air-chamber between the two cases, 11 iuches apart, is a great clleck on heat-\-ariatious. Three side-openings, with tin and gin.Rs doors in ead1 tul>e, permit observations of Hie parts and of inserted tliermometers. 'l'he mHl8 are cloxetl., 0111.r tlw sli<ling-rml cntls projecting at each extremity, exposing the agates. Brass guanl-tubes protect these, and for transportation tin conical caps are scrm'1ed on the tube ends. The fine-motion screw, the sector-tangent screw, and the contact-lever-clamp screw project lwyond the case. The tnhe is painted white, which, .with the air-cuambcr and tl10rough compensation, dfectnally olJYiates nll m·(·d of a screen from the sunshiue, which l1as usu:lll_v Ileen deemed requisite. Tlle tube rests 011 a fore ·trestle allll rear trestle, whiell are alike, l,xee.pt i11 tlie head:-;. Ead1 trestle has three legs, composed of one iron c_yli11der 111m·i11g in ::wother lJy mea11s of a rack, pi111011, and crank, so as to raise or sink tbe lrna<l-plate. The leYeling and finer adjustment are by means of a foot-screw in each leg, by working which a circuhu level on tile connecting-frame is adjuste(l. A large axis-screw, resting 011 tlte comicct.ing-frame, a11tl rising into a tulmlar nut, is turned hy beveled pinions workeu by ;t crank, and thus raises or lowers tltis tubular nnt and the c:ip,pit>cc wllich it supports at top. The axis-screw, the leg-racks, and the foot-screws gi\-e three Yertical movements in the trestle, l1y which its mtpacit;y for slope-measurements is much amplified. In the cap of the rear trestle, a lateral and ~longitudinal motio11 are proYided for, by means of two t:tblets arranged to slide, the UJlper one longitudinally on the lower one, and tlw lower laterally on the head-plate of the axis-screw tube. Long adjusting screw-handles extend to the observer's staml from these two plates and from the axis-screw, enab1ing llim to raise or lower, tn slide forward or back, to the right or tl1e left, the rear end of the tube. The fore trestle is similar, except that its head is only arranged for a lateral movement, and a second observer makes its adjustments by a simple crank. Four men can carry a tube, by leYers passed through staples in blocks strapped mHler the tubes. The principal observer and an assistant make the contacts and rectifications, the first assistant directs the forward tube, ant! another preserves the alignment with a theodolite. A citn·. ful recorder notes down the obsen·atious, and an inteJJigent aid places the trestles aud foot-plates. The labor of grading, es1>ecially in level saml-liues, is quite trifliug. The first base-line measured with the apparatus now descrilmd was the Dauphiue Island lxtsl', nea1· Mobile, and about six and two-thirds miles long, which was measured by Professor Bache in 1847. (Coast Survey Report, 1847, p.39.) TLe party was on the ground six weeks, bet\Yeen April 30 and June 12, though only 17 working-days were consumed in the final measurement. Tue greatest day's work was 183 t11oos, or near seven-tenths of a, mile. From some remeasurements the greatest supposable error for the entire base was computed to be less tlum six-tenths of an inch. The second base-measurement with this apparatus was also by Professor Bache in 1848 (Coast Survey Reports, 1848, ll· 4..'3, and 1849, p. 38), being the Bodies Island base, North Carolina,
it ·against an adjusting screw-end.

about six nud three-quarter miles long. Ten working-days were emplo;1·ec1 in tbe actual me:isnrement, between the 4th and 23d of November. The greatest, lla;y's work was 1,692 meters, or 1.06 miles, iu eight and a half hours. Several partial remeasurements give the total probable error for the entire base at less than one-tenth of an inch, and the greatest supposable error at less thau three-tenths of an inch. The only other base hitherto measured with tht:se meaus js the Edisto Island base, South Uarolina, wl.Jich opemtiou was conducted b,y Professor Bache, l>etween the 3d and 18th of Jaunary, 1850 (Coast Surve:f l~eport, 18ilO, p . .'H); thirteen clays being occupied in the aettial measurement. Its length is about six and two-thirds milers, and it wa:;; much more uneYen than the previous Lase. Tire greatest day'::; work was 1,12~ meters, or about three-fourtbs of a mile.. A partial remeiisuremeut gave one-tenth of an iuch as tlte probable accidental error of measurement for the whole base. It will be almndantly evident, on examining the results of other mode,; of measmement, tlrnt tbe Coast MUITey apparatus is a superior combination of the requisite elements for such 01ieratimrn, givi11g a g-ai11 in accur:ic,\'1 rupidity, and eeonomy of use o\·er its predticessors. The multiplication of bases is no longer a sonrce of such formidable expeu<littires of time and money; hence geodetic operations are much facilitated and benefited by tbis fundamental impro\·ement in the instrnme1rts employt>d. The more pe1·foct compensation from regulating the masses of the bars, the applieatio11 of t.he principle of contact indication by the le\·el, the stiffness of the support for the bar-system, tlw sector for slope-measurements, aIHl the trestles, combining such a variety of movement with rery great Jirmness-Uiese foaturt>S all attest the thorough stmly of the prol>lem, which was made by Professor Hacue, preparatory to calling forth tlrn peculiar skill of 1\lr. \Viinlemann. Bessel's contact-liwcl, hefore employed in the comparison of standards, bas the same rea11ily available accuracy in ihiR apparatus, and should supersede the comparing-microscope entirely for final meaA· urements. !<'or field-comparisons witll standa.rds, the pccnlitirly elegant principle of Saxto11':c1 P~'ronrcler is even better than the contact-level. 'Vlrntcn'r improniments nmy st.ill need to he made in liase·measuriug apparatus, this important point is now rca.ched: that the bases are measured at once witli au a~curnc~y far exceeding tliat of the aaguhir measures gi\'en hy atny practicable number of repetitions on port11hle angle-in8trumentl'l, and of the same or·l~r with tile compariR011s between tlw actua.l stan11a.nls and their copies nsed in the meaRuremeu ts.

SUPPI,El\IHNT. Up to 1874, the indications of the thermometers within the tubes liarn bceu t11ke11 as the u:eans for applying any residual correction for want of perfect compensation wllich might be shown to be re(1nisite. \Vhile this correction is only of very small amount, and affects the length of a base only so far as the mean temperature <luring the measurement or a uase.Jine is· lliffereut from .that at 'vl1icb the apparatus bas been compared with the standar1l bar, it is, nevertheless, subject to the uricertai11t.r arising from tJ1e fact that t,hosc thermometers do not show the actual templ.'ratnre of the compensating bars, except when the temperature has bet~n stationar.f for some time. Jn order to obviate this smuce of error, an arrangement has been designed au<l 'adapted to the apparatus by Assistant J.E. Ililganl, by which the difference in the length of the two bars may be read on a scale a.ttached to the iron bar by means of a vernier fixed to the brass bar, formi11g a" Borda th ermorueter ", as shown in Fig. 3. The scale is divided to half-millimeters, of which the vernier indicates the fiftieth p:trt, so that, by means of a long-focus microscope, the difference may be read to the hundredth part of :t millimeter without opening the case. Since the compensation c.'lu readily be ma11e correct to within its thirtieth part, it is evident tliat tbc true length of the oom1mnud liars may be inferred at any time from the indications of the scale-reading, with an uncertainty no greater than the thousandth llart of a millimeter, or a mieron; as that value is now called. In making this correction, no reference to the thermometers is necessary, as tl1e length is directly derived from the scale-readings. In the comparisons of the compensating measuring bars with the six-meter standard, the latter is immersed in glycerine, and its temperature and inferred length are very closely indicated by the thermometers distributed along its entire lengtb 1 nearly in 0011tact with it, aatl of. course equally immer$ed in the liquid.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 14.
A J,,JST 01·' STARS FOR OBSERVATIONS OF LATITUDE.
It has been the custom heretofore in the Coast Survey to select from the British Association's Catalogue the pairs of stars suitable for the rletermination of latitude, by the method of observing equal meridian zenith-distances with the zenith-telescope. The numbers of the stars so selected for observation at any station were sent to the Office, where the mean declinations for the year of observation were obtained by reference to all recent catalogues of precision, comprising the several Greenwich Catalogues, the \Vashington Observations, the Radcliffe and Armagh, and, where these failed, the Rumker Catalogue. For stars not found in at least two of these catalogues, and those which exhibited large discrepancies in position, express observations were made, li:r request, at the observatories at 'Yashington and Cambridge. This practice of deducing the declinations of stars from observations ma<le with different circles and under varied circumstances has led to a great degree of precision in the assumed declinations. The stars used iin the method of equal zenith-distances comprise those down to the sixth magnitude, most of which have not been the object of precise determiuation as standard stars. Still we :fiml that tlle probable error of the declination of a star derirnd in the manner above mentioned does not exceed ±0".3. And the probable erroc of one obscryation with the instruments nsed being between 0".3 and 0".5, the observation of sixteen pairs of stars on four nights nevC'r fails to reduce the probable error of the latitude below 0".1. The British Association's Catalogue is now very difficult to obtain, and its coustauts have uecome obsolete by lapse of time. The continued demand on the Office for copies which could not be procured led to the preparation of the catalogue given below, which is intended to replace it as a list of stars anlilaMe for the obserrntiuu of latitude by the zenith-telescope in the limits of the United States. That list, giving the right ascensions only to the nearest tenth of a minute in time, a11d the declinations to tlie nearest minute of arc, for the epoch 1880, is intended to serve merely for the selection of stars for the observation of latitude. They comprhm all the stars that are found in the "Bonner V-erzeiclmiss," or Nordliche D1trchm11sterung of Argelander, included between sso 40' north and 10 48' south declination, and to his 5.9 degree of magnitude inclusfre. The list was selectetl under the direction of Assistant C. S. Peirce, and their places computed for the epod1 of 1880 with sufficient aceura'ty for the purposes above stated. The magnitudes have been reduced to a scale of "equable distribution," according to tlie method explained in ~Ir. Peirce 7s Photometric Researches in the .Annals of the Harvard Ool1ege Observatory. It is the intention of the Coast Suney Office to reprint at an early day this list of stars, with their accurate positions in declination and right ascension as far as ascertainable. The Catalogue of Reis having been thoroughly compared in the preparation of this list, numerous enata liave been discovered in the same, which are here given as a supplement. The 1mm bers of tlwse stars which are contained in the Briti.sb Association's Catalogue are gi vcn in the second column of the list: the third column gives the usual designation by constellations. Other reforences are given in the last column; the following abbreviations being used:
