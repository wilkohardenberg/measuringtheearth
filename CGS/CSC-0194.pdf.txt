I . greSS Of the WOfk for fOUr years and 8 half, inCl\lding the filUrveying ' " seal'on of 184:4. The estimates for tl1e next. fiscal year are sub. mittf'1f at the close of the report~ The ·reports madt to 1ne by thP. assistanlR brinrr the progress of their work, generally, up to the first of Norernber, and in some Ir. cases to the close of the surveying season in the different localities 'vht·1·e they bave been employed. . · nuriug the i1ast yl.'ur the work hns been carl'iell into every State, "·1th one exception, on the Atlantic nnd gulf of Mexico, nn1l JHar· ties urc on the way and untlcr ortl1m1 for the Pacific coast. The operation!' ltave been in provcss on th'(! full scale in four sections of tbt· coast, including the reduction of the results; w~rk of yerifi· cation anal filling up, un1l the engraving of charts from the back ·work, haz.1 lic1:11 continut'll in a fifth 111:ction; the second stage of .... ..........· . progress has been reached in a sixth and seventh 1.ectio11, ar11l pre· ,., '·. limmary reconnaissance has b~tm made in an t·i~ht.b. 'l'he work l1as IH·cn equi\·alent, at least, to full activity in i;ix twctions. 'l'he cstiu.atcs for the next fiscal year will furnish work equivalent to· 1he full 1.1cale of ope1ationsin senn sections. A brtsl.' line has been mea· ""e1I in one section, and two prl!lirninary measurements of othcu1 made. Six shc1:·ts of charts have been published, and ten others are in the bands of the engravers. Thirteen sheets of maps an1\ charts l1av·J been clrnwn in whole or in part within t11e Jcar,. exclusive of assemblage maps, sketchcP, &c. · Six new Pboals huve been discovered within the season off Nan· 1uckt>t, and one in the Chesapeake bay. I hav(! often intro1luce1l in my reports the subject of the rdative eco11ou1) of the work, and bavti endeavored to show, by compari· son!I from year to year, that incrt:11i:.1~1l t·conomy is secured as tlrn optrations are exten<lcd in the progrtss of the surYey ·. It is, how~ ever, frequently assumed that a work of this kind, conJuctl'd upon the highest scientific 1>ri11ciples, must lie t·xpenliiYe, no m111t1·r wliat may be its gRin in economy in i;u1!c1:ssive years. It is generally conceded tilat the survey l)f an extended 1·oast,- like· that of the United State!!, cannot be satisfactorily rnndti except by the employment of the most refined methods of modern rnatht!matics anal ph)'S· ics; and tlu ~c metbocls, it is usually supposed, must be costly iu tllt'ir app!icatiou. When a work of this kind is con1luctetl 011 i1 sufficieutly large scale to effect a proper division of labor, it is by no means expensive as is generally 11ssume1i, notwithstan<liug its el1tboratc character; anal it will evcu ucar comparison, in regard to cost, with works ot for lower claims in reference to scientilic: mc· tboi!~ or ruultl!.

It is atl.mitted to be dei:irablc, if ~1ot too costly; 'l'he cost of one cent and ninety· four lrnndre<lths per acre, ($12 41 per squ1ue mil.c,) stated by the · Commissioner of the General. l.1and Offi~e in 1815 1 from careful a.\·· l'ra'gl!s 1 to be that of the l.\nd. surveys to that tirne, is certainly less . tlrn.n has been paid by· other gov.ernm~nts for similar work. The estimated cost of six dollars and thirteen cents per lineal mile. ($6 13) for 1816 is qu.itc low, anll even the maximum cost, in some . of the Jnn1I districts, of ten dollars and forty-nine cents, ($10 49,) IF, bt·yon1l a doubt, reasonable. The cost of the topography of the coai;t sun;ey in 1847 1 the year now rcportell· tipon, .was, exclusil"e of llra\Vings, one cent andforty·fi~e l~u.n.drcdths per ~ere) (less than the aycrage cost above stated,) including the drawmgs, two cents. ·and fifteen hundredths per acre, or two mills 1:er acre greater thau the cost above slate.I. · Con\'erting the lineal surveys of the coast survey .into area by the average proportion deduced from four years;· 1844 .to 1848, the cost per lineal mile, \Vithout drawings, was three .1lul1ars and forty cents, ($3 40;) with drawings, five dollars and ten cents, ($5 10;) both less than either the actual cost of the land survt·y~ up to 1845, or tb'ci' estimated cost for. 1846. ·. . · As the otl.er opcrntious of the survey are beyond those of ordi-. ·. nary luurl sun·eys, thcr might be expected to add greatly to its cos!; an,d ll's. it ui ~d1n1tted that the work, topography inclusive,·. cl,erl\"e~ its h1ghe~t 1mportanc~ from these 0th.er results 1 the ques· · t10~1 might .be t\lrned upon their actual ''nlue nnd not their expense. ~h~~ gcogrnphical t.le1crin~hations of the points and benring.s are i~· fo·1>t:nsable to an accuratu mnp, e\'en of a modnate exte.nt of surface~ If a map or chart is ilesirablct it should certainly be constructed on corrt!ct urntlulmat.icFil nticl physical principles.

It net only fur· nishes accurate· scientific details and practical rr11ults, but it aJforJ:J .them at a V<'ry mod<-rate cost.

J3esi1les the regular requisitions for the hydrcigraphic p111tit·s, the Secrttary of the Nn,·y has it in his power, under the ~ame !aw, to furnish .rt-pairs to the coast survey ·vessels. Tlie liber:,lity of the present ~ecr1·tary, ancl of his immediate pre1lcct·1isor, has fr<'qucntly been shown in this w1ty to the wor.k.

taken place, prov:ision has also been made to survey at once the· more impor.tant portions of the ·coast added ·. It is thus certain that any fixed anll definite extent of shore Jine may be 'surveyed within a reasonable. time, the, more important parts being put under immediate survey, arid the results of the work published. Ju tliis cxtentiion of the work, the. fosttring care of the Trcas'1ry D·epartment and .of Congress has Leen especially felt. .Tbe increused appropriations ncce~sary havti been granted, and e\·ery in· citlcutal facility which, under t11c law, the Treasury Department has been able to extend, hns brcn givcu freely. 'fhe War and Navy Departments J,a,·e also liberally ('O·operatcd in aiiling the ' survey. In the estimates for the next fiscal year, work cqu\val·mt to full attivity in seven secticms is prnYided for, with a general item for ofJicH e.-<pt·1ulitu1'cs, nn1I the cost of using four steam vessels. The total. sum asked, is $186,000, which is less than I had assumed, in . my rt'port ol' 1846, as tlic cost of: seven sections and the gentlral itt'W h·r instruments a11d materia.lis, without the use of steam vcs· sds. It is, certainly, the least sum for which the work proposed can be 1lone, anti may, possibly, owing to unfort'seen expenses in tht- new f!ections, fall below what is necessary. The estimates show, with some detail, th work proposed for the next fiscal ycar. 'l'he following is a brit:f outline, referring only in g1·r1t"ral terms to the optratio11s. l·'ull activity ii; proposed for the work in section I., (coast of l\1,ti;i;ad1usett!!1, New I-fornpsliire, nnd Maine,) with the resources which this large section, with .itN i111!ented coa8t, requires. The office work will keep up, in general, with the fi!!ld work.· The nurnl>cr of harbor charts fumislied by this i;cct;on has r~ndcre<l it ditficult to keep up in the cng.·1n·ing. It ji; hoped to finis~ the hydro~raphy of Nantucktt :shoals in another season, when the in-shore work will adnnce rapidly. This important region, however, will rccein <111 the time which it may require. The field work in St!ctionIT., (Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pen11syh·a11ia, an1i Delaware,) is chit'fl) of filling up, aqtl the pr111cipal 1tl'tnS of expense are for the engraving of the back work · .

persons necessar1 in a separate organization, which w"s successful under the ,Jirect1on of Mr. Cutts in section Ill., bas been tried this season in Mr. Whiting's pnrty. The expenditures of the sen11on having been yet returned only in part, I cannot give the result in figures; but Mr. Whiting reports a conside.rnble increase of work in proportion to the addition of expenditure. An early announcement was made of the discoveries: by Lieutenant Commanding C.H. Davis, off Nantucket, (see appendix No. 3,) in the former part of the season. The work incr(·ases in interest as it advances, and as the connexion betwetn ·the detached pa1·ts becomes apparent. 'l'he two shoal spots 1liscovere1l last y('ar, and the ridges 11iscoveret! in 18,16, are now traced as parls of l'Xtcutlctl shoals. A description of the dangerous locality of the Na11tu1:ket shoals, as developed up to the close of the season, will be giYen in · the appendix to this report, (No. 3, bis,) an1l a sketch showing this part' of our coast as now known will accompany jt, anil also be printe1l separately for distribution. The steam vessel, sailing \'cssel, and extra vessels employed this year, will h(· rl!quircil fo1· another season, at lens~, to complete this part of tlw survey. Six new slwals have been discovered during this one Kenson, th(! number showing how truly this important part ot' our coast might have bet:n da.1se1l with regions unkuown. I mcutioned in the report of last year that comparative trials had bc1 n made of the it-nith tl~h·scopc, zenith sector, and prime Vl'l'li· cal tr11ni;iit, ns 11:1:11111< of 1letermi11ing latitudes on the eoasl 1rnrYey. · Ti1c l'e!iults were very favorable to the two instruml'nts first named, ancl uufa\'orable to the method by transits over the primc vertical for fi"l1l work. The easte111 a111l we:.h·rn transits of but few stars cout.l i,.. ul.iwrn·d on the i;amc cHni11g, an1l the intervals were frequntly lost, even wh1-n the ob·erYalions were extended through the whole night. The results by the same star upon every wire · were gontl, the prohable error of the latitude from a single observa.ion 011 n single wire bt-ing hut 011 .85, (about th1· samu iu amount n~ th· 11i11gle o..bservntion with the Zl'nith St'c.tor;) the prohahle error tJl latitutl·e, as observed hy n single star, derived from a mean of four "hserv..il, beinJ! 2''.07, anti of the m1-an of the four 1''.().1, It is ,.,!ry probablt: that thl'se difficulties may be rcme1lie1l, ut least in a degree, by onothl'r incthotl of obs-erving or by comparisons at tlfffcrent places for dilferencts of latitude, but the fow results which can bi· procured In a given time, wlien the weather is 1111rticularly favorable, will always tell against it for fiel<l purposes. Mr. Davidson, who remained at Agamenticus to ad1l to the number of stars which had h·!en obsf.:rvetl on the prime \'ertical, laborC'tl assiduously for twenty·senm nights, watching the whole night when there was any proi:ipect of success, without procuring a siugle intcn·al betwet·n an eastern an<l western trnnsit of the same star. With the zenith sector, in sixteen evenings in October nncl No'\'c111bcr, before midnight, 106 observations Were matlu Oil a7 stars, the probable error of a single observation being 0 11 .88, anti the probable error of the place of nny one star as v;i\·cn by the catalogue being O'' .4 7. The error of the mean rcsul t for la ti tu<l c is

17

[1~

thus very. small, being probably chic.fly. tha~ or the part of the cata1ogue employccl, Four observations with the zenith sec~tor thus appear to gh·e a result equivalent in value to the normal place of the star given by the catalogue. By the .zenith telescope in 10 nights, to nliout midnight, 125 observations were made on 2S stars, the probable error of an observation being :l: 0'',87, of a sin. glc pair {c~talo~ue error) being :l: 111 .13, and the mcnn latitude lieing 43° 13' 25" .1. There is yet room for dtlubt wht.ther tho . z~nith sector \vil! main~ain its super!or accuracy wh~n compnrctl with the more recent forms of the zenith and eqnal altitude instru· ment, a111l with more accurate determinations of the places of the stars. The portability of this latter instl'Ument, and the facility of its use by a single obscrvc1·, makes it deservedly a favorite. The trial at Agnme.nticus was fayorable to one determination of latitude by the zenith sector, as compared' with one determiu.ation of latitude by the ~enith telescope. ThP. results for the latitu1le of the station, flt~rivP.d froin the three instrumPnts, were for the ze11itb sector 43° 13' 25" .00; zenith telc~copc 43" 15' 25".1; transits over the prime vertical 43° 13' 25".81 N.

Jloutclle, who was oc1:upied in it from the 21st of June t(I tho 6th of August. The work proved mucl1 more difficult than Mr. lloutullc's pre\'ious k11owlc1l~c of thnt part of the c:ountrr had led liim to su11pot:w; the points whiuh arc intervisablt! nn<l which form, by their con:ll!xion, triangles of the proper shape, not giving the', 'length of si1lci; whi1Jh hail been nnticipated. After a general ex· ntni11ntion of the countryl for the. nt?xt rangt? of triangles, Afr. Boutelle m1ule a triangu ation with a reconnoitring telt·scope '!ith a tlh·ide1! circle,,so ns to fix approximate.ly th~ relativ_e P.?si·· hons of promrnent points. A report, mncle with h1s usual nb1ltty, shows the condition11 which limit the selectipn of the triangl~ Jrnints in particular directions, 1njd prestlutR n scheme for the ex· tension of thl! primary triangles.

2. Primary trfongulation.-As stated i" my report of last year, the progress of this triangulation, in ad\·ance of the secondary, ad· 1 mits of the devotion of part of my time to work in other sections. Clor;ing the work of verificlltion in section UL in the latter part ef August, I occupied Unlconoonuc station in N~w Hampshire, be· tween the 28th of August and 7th of Odnher. This was not ori.i:dnally intf!nc!l;'cl RR an astronomic:nl station, but· the Secretary or the Treasury having rlireC'tc1l the oerJ.inuing of the survey of the coast of section X., the. western coa~t, I d~curn1l it tixpedient that the JH;~i11lant, who was to be in charge of t!1at work, should have an opportunit1 of gn:ug through all tho clifiercnt classes of obscr· vatio1111 made rn the 1.;.1rvey, 11n1l cleterminecl to use thia 8tation, both for astroncmical and magnetic obsen·ations.

Tl1e points observed upon from Unkonoonuc, seven in number, are anarketl in sketch A, and extend from Gunstock mountain on the north, to Blue b!ll, near Boston, on tbt~ south. It has an extencle1l l'iew of the iinmecliatc coast, including Blue hill, Thompi::on's al Cape Ann, ancl Agnmenticus in Maine, about se\'cnty·five milt:s, 'l'he shortest si1lc of the triangulation centring at this mot111tain is twenty-two miles in length, a111l tl1e louge~l fifty·fi\'e 111iles. Tl:c horizontal angles were measured by 316 observations with tl1e lhirty-inrh Troughton an1l Simms's thcotlolitc of the coast survt:y.

3 . ·lbtronomical antl magnetic ob1wrvations.-'rhe n!ltronotn ical observations were of latitude and azimuth, arid for local time; the magnt:tic, of cleclination, <lip and intensity. These were madtl by me versonally, 01· by Sub-assistant Josepll S. Ruth, under my im~ediate 1Hrection. Assistant Jumcs S. Williams also took part in the astronomical observations. A new zemth telescope, by Simms, (No. 2, of the coast surt'ey,) with such improvements as the expern:nce in its use by former observers has suggeste1I, w11s used fo1· 11.?termining the latitude by Captain Talcott's method. This instrument i!! arranged S'> as to rt!ach the zenith stars without ditficulty. It has a telescope of 3! inches aperture, a111i 40 inchl's in lcngtli, a single micro1J1ctcr, a brass arc for ~tea1lyi11 1~ its vcrtii:i~I motion, and is ~vell arranged in its minor details. A rc-computntlon of the results is· necessary before WP can compare its performance with those of the other i1111trurucnts of the same kintl 11se1l iu thl' coast survt>y. 118 observations were m:11!t! for \atiturle with this instrument on 30 pairs of stars. 124 o'oser· vations were rnaclc CJll Polaris at culmination fol' the! valtrn of tlie 111:1·1 orudt·r, 111111 25 at elongation for the value of the lc\'Pl 1livh:inns.· Eighty t ran~ils of slar:-i wuc observed for lot·al time, in co11111·xion ,\'it!. tlic ohi-1:1n1tio11s of latitude :11111 azimuth with the fotty-tivc ind1 tr:ini-:it i11~tr11mcnt. of 8i111111.~, (Ko.

Five positions of the instrument were usecl in the measurement of terrestrial horizontal angles. 35 observations were mat\e for con· necting the observed positions of the star and the elongation mark. The heliotrope, or pole nt Holt's station near Andover, (see sketch A,) wns the mark of reference in the morning elongations, and a lamp, such as is used in the smaller Jight·houses on the coast, with a single n·ficctor, kindly loaned to the coast survey by the Fifth Auditor, was the night mark at Holt's. When the atmosphere was moderately clear, the. light was readily obriervetl with tl1e wires fully illuminated; the distance to Holt's is about 34 miles. . Ninety· three readings for magnetic variation were made on three days; six sets of observations for horiv.ontal intensity on four days, and three sets for di(> on two dnys. !<"'our sets of experiments for the momo1t of inertia, and magnetic moment of the 1nagnet were made on two tlays. A decHnomcter nnd magnetometer, described by Ri1lclcll in the magnetic instructions of the British Association, and mncle for the const survey by Jonc11, (No. 2,) was used in these ohst!r\'ntion11; also, a dip circle, by Darrow of London, (No. 1.) Tac observations at Nantucket have been continued during the past year by Wi\\iam MitclH!ll, esq., who reports one hundred and thirty-two observations of the tnoon and moon culminating stars, and four occultations for longitudes, thirty· two prime vertical tran· · site, (sixteen intcrnl11,) and thirty-five series of obsenations with · · · tbe West Point repeating circle lor latitude. The chronometer comparisons for differences of longitude of Cambridge and Lh·erpool ha\'C been continued by Professor W. C. Donel, director of the Cambridge obserntory, and seventy deter· niinations made during the past year ·. Mr . .llond als~ reports, for the use of the coast survey, twenty·nane moon culminations, (re· duccd,) ten occultations of stars by the moon, ancl seventy-two re· suits for latitude by transits over the prime v~rtical. Observations for locnl time were made, also, by Mr. Bond; and Mr. George P. Bonrl, in connexion with the telegraphic op.erations, for difference of longitude ot' New York anil Cambridge, .on nineteen da~s in July, and fifteen. in August, besides others for personal eq11ations.

At New York, a new forty-five inch transit instrument of the coast survey, by Simms of LonJon, (No. 2,) was us~d for local time, and a sidereal clock, belonging to M cssrs. E. an<l G. W. Blunt, with chronometers for comparisons. The performance of the new transit i& rt·ported by the observers to be entirely sati~fac tory. At Cambridge, a similar transit, uf the .Messrs. Bon<l was used, with numerous chronomett!rs carefully cornparetl. The comparifons at the ends of the liuc were made by the method of coind<lenccs. . 'l'he mode of using. !lie telegraph has btcn explained in u:y last rt·port, and the cond1tions nccei;sary to accurncy, as also the 111e· thotl of de1lucing results from the observations. The r<!cciviul!' magnefs u~cd last year were lai<l asicle, to givl! place to others of greater J>OWcr. Signals were exchanged on seven nights in July and August between the two stations, the whole nun1bcr am<Junting to 12,000, Thl·se wue generally coincidcn.t with the bcats of th1i clock or chronometers; !Jut, iu some cases, the trausit of the same ~tars over the different wires of the instruments were also telegraphed. The personal l'quations for the clo :k corrt'ctions of <litfcrc11t ob· scn·<·1·s were obtained by a nry extensive striC's of comparisons, 894 in number, the transit of the same f·quatoreal strir over alter· 11ate wirt~s being noted by JifTcrcnt observers. The other observers rq>airl'tl to Ca1nbri<lge for comparisons with the M<~ssrs. Bond. The observations for clock corrections were ma1le by the most npprovcJ m<'thod. The small list of zenith stars wus used fo1· obscr· vations of cfock correctious at New York and Cambri1lge, eliminat· ing, nt·arly, the errors in the right ascensions as 1leiivcJ from the <·atalogue of tlie British A~soeiation. Mr. Walker proposts to re· duce these right uscensious to an ayerage value for all the obs.er,·ations of tl!e season, (575 obsen·cd tnmsits,) in11ki11g the corrcc· tions which the observed differences may indicate. In re~erence to the correctior.s of tLe teh·graphic part of the operations id('ntical results were ubtaincd with those slated in my rt·port of last year, leading to tbe i.ame conclusious lhat, when ,1ue pncautions arc taken, the "telegraph itself commits no error which. the most delicate ear can <letect."

<ln this subject, viz: whether there is any constant relation betwe.en two indh-iciua]s for a term of several weeks, or whether the eleml'nt is.not subject to fluctuations with the relati\·c sta'te of the health anti lempcrame11t oJ the observers. I think tbe experience· .of fixccl obscn·atorics· warrants the conclusion, that two observers of th.e regular corps, retaining the same instruments at the same locality, hRYc 1 for several months, and c\·cn for sc,·ernl years, the snmP relation. to each other. Su1~h was not 1he experience of the last year's work a1nong the traYelling corps of observers of the United States coast survey; clrnnge of place nnd in11truments have Sl'cmed to produce changes in the '\'nlue of this. element. Since th .. liahility to erro1· from tliis source cxceed11 that from all others, too much 11tress cannot be laid on the importance of studying the ph:losophy of it." "I beg to suggest tbc following hnothesis: There exists b('· tw1.·cn the ahso'lutl· time of the sensation of sight of a phenomenon, and of rcfcmmcc of that se11satio11 in point of time to that of the l1eari11g of a souncl in Hery intli\'idual, a \'cry small interval, which, though slightly variable with bis temperament in other r<'i1pcc:ts under l'limilar circumstnnccs, mny remain constant for months, and perhaps for years. It is the difference in this quantity of time that constitutes the personal equation of two observers. In order to arrive at it, the t"o persons must eliminate. their relatin· accidental.error of sseing anrl also of I.caring. The outstancl· ing tlill'erencc after this elimination constitutes the personal equa-· tion." · "In order to converge with rapidity to this ultimate relation be·· tween two persons, the clock beat used by both should be clenr and 1listi11ct. 'I.'hc optical cnpnr.ity and definition of the transit instrum1·nt should be the best possible. The solnr focus and the ocular focus of the transit wirci. sboulcl coincide in space for ench obiwrvcr. 'l'his can only be secured if the vision of one is shorter 1han that of the other, by one or both of them wearing thoi;e spnctncles which C\'ery day's practice lias shown to be needful. After. t11king these }lrecautions, I hn,·c reason to bclicn! thct the trial of JOO wires at a sir1gle comp1.l'iso11 ~ivcs a result nearly freed from acdtlenlal error, when both purhcs nre in good health and free from fatigue. If these couditions are not complied with, if the ch~linition of tlie telescope i11 imperfect, or if the o'·ular focus is not good for both parties, fleveral such comparisons arc necd1'd in ordt·r lo obtain the requisite prcci!'ion of the result. If the solar or ocular focus is bn1I, the eye endeavors to overcome this hnperfec· tiou by its own ach:ptnhility. 'I'hilil power of o\·ercoiuing such 11 difficulty varies with the stale of the nervous system or tempera. :anent, anti in i;uch a case different states of temperament produce different degrees of perfection of vision, and difforent clegrees of co1n·eri,Icncy towardlil the true result from a given number oi 'Wires.';· ·· "It. often happens that two persons after a ~tate of rl?st or. rel'!umpt1on of :work, con\·erge rapidly towards their normal relation. Ir afterwards one of them rests, and the other labors so as to be .

trials, find a ver'1 different result from the preceding. From the experience of this year, it seems proper to conclude that observa·.' tions for personal equations, when all the above mentioned requisites nre not complied with, are of very little use; and that the incorporation of them in the mean or general result leaves it less accurate than that of a smaller number of trials under circum~tances favorable throughout. Observations by daylight are preferable. The eyes of different focus adapt thtmselves to the same eye-piece better than by night." The collection of personal equations appended to Mr. Walker's rrport of this and of last year is, I believe, the most extt·nded on reccnl, t!mbracing forty·scven different pairs of observers. The persor1al equnti.ons be\vcen the four principal observers of the season are <letermined within a probable error of one·liurHlrt-dth of a·· sccori<l of time. As these results will be of considerable interest to practfoal astronomy g~nerally, and the necesf>ity of re<:urring to · similar ob11ervations in t.he coast survey will be constant, so as to render the results valuable for reference to the work, I have placed the gt·neral abstract in the appendix No. 4. . 'fhe formation an<l discussion of the conditional equation-; for the diifcrcnce of lon~itude will complete this report of Mr. Walker. His otlier labors m computing will be found noted under their appropriat<' hca1l of office work. We ha\'C now obtained the difference of lo11gitu1le between \Vashington and Cambridge by the telegraph, usinl,( two interme· diate stations at Jersey City and New York, which may be con· 11ected with cutninty hy the geodetic operations of the surYcy. The 11itl'ercnce of longitude between Philatl1!lphia and Washington and Jer~ey City was obtained in the course of the first.series of observations.

The party of Captain Crbm took the fir.Id in July, ~nd by the middle of August the rcconnaissunce was firii!:hc1I, nnd the additional signals (twelve in number) erected. Up to thl' 27th of Sc-ptonber, the following work l1ud been l'Omplele1l. Sl·Hn i:tations hail bc·cn occupied, and an area crnhracc<l of 453 11q1um· mih·s.

[1]
S. A. Gilbert, the number of hands of the party being doubled. Up to the close of September, sheets Nos. 31, 3.2, 33 had been completed by this party, an area had been surveyed of 73! square miles, an t-xtt·ut of shore line of 103 miles, shore lines of cretk!I and ponds 38! miles, and roa,ls .210~ miles. The topography of the shores of W elJtlett harbor, of Soutb Wellfleet or Black fish creek, and of Parm et river harbor in Tru1·0 are incl11ded in No. 3L This sheet alone coutain.~ 18! milts of roads, and the character of the 11at11ral features of tht' country included in it is ''cry complc>x. Mr. Whiting remal'ks: "'l'lte hills in 'l'ruro will average from luO to t40 ft>ct high, and in W t·llfl1:t.'l a111l Bai-tliam from 120 to SO an1l 60. 'l'liese arc all of Hu· ruost abrupt and irregular character, with alternate hollows an1l peaks." "In six consec-utfoe square miles tl1er(· arc not lt·ss than 300 tit>parate peaks of liills,an1l some 510 holes or l1ollows, all requil'ing and lun;ing separate aud distinct cur.Yes of contour and elcyation." Mr. Whiting took the field in Jur11.' 1 an1l, after preliminary recon11ais!lan1~e, comm('ncto1t hi11 plane table operations on the 8th of July. Ht· was joined by Mr. Gilbert on the 20th of July, since which time two instrurut:uts l1aYe been employed. The party t~xpectl·d to finish this part of ·Cape Cod during the present season; but I have been obliged to direct the closing of the work in October, for imr.ortant venfications in section IL of the survey, and a rc·fiu1vcy of S.1.11dy Hook, to ascertain its increase. The topography in tld:l s1·ctio11 is su{fid<·ntly in advance of the h)tlrography to permit a short seasor.'s work without cletrim<:nt to the general progress of the sec· tiou. During the last wintH, Mr. Whiti11g was eng!lged at Tioston in· tr:111si'erring the survey of the city, by the water co10rnissioners, to his topograpl1it·~I sheets of the shores of lJoston harbor. In effecting this, it was necessary to run additional lines and occupy many sta·tion11. Tiiis work employed him until the 20th of l\'larch, wlien he repaire,tl to the oflict· and put in ink the topogra11hical details of his pla11e table she.cts, as far as the time permitted, until it was ne· ce!'1wry a-gain to take the field. Mr. Gi.bert was engaged in puttii·~ in ink tht! topography surveyed during the previou!' Sl'nson, a111J also in n·ducing in pencil, for the conunissio11crs of lfoston bi1rbor, a part of tht: p!a11e table sheets of the harbor shores.

The extent inclu<led in these surveys about 9~ 11quare miles, but clo's not fairly represent the amount of work done, as it is in detached parts, which are at considerable distances from each other. The di11tance g'>ne over, in moving from plar:c to place in executing the work, is estimated at three bundrefl mile111. Mr. Gliirk mentions with thanks the prompt Assistance received · froin Cdptain Walilcn, of the revenue cutter Jackso~ 1 who wtts tliri!ctnl to afford him transportation in the surveys in .Naragansett and Duzzarcl's bays. · . In October this party was directed to take up th<' V<'rification of the ;;hores of the Patapsco. During the last w:nter Mr. Ohick was occupi1id in the ollice in putting in ink his sun·cys for the chart of Doston harbor, and. in transferring the topographical details to the Jnap for 'the coinmif'lsioners of B.oston harbor.

pelled me most ·unwillingly to report to you the necessity for· giving another season to the outer Nantucket shoals. "Five new shoals, discovered during the prc:.;cut year, have alre11dy been reported to the public, and another shoal or bank hns since been disco,·ered,eighteen miles from Nantucket, of equal irnportanre to any of the prece1lir>g. But the weatht:1· during tlic 1no11th of August has also been a cause of our not completing the r1roposeci chart this season. It proved a grcatn drawback thun urn:il. ~rbe ·fog was so continuous and den11e, that the \'essels have·111or" than once laitl at anchor on the shoals without seeing each other for forty·eight hours, though only a fr:w miles apart." In the appendix (No. 3, bis) will be found a notict! of the daugers in this Yicinity as thry were known at the close of the :.un·1·ying season! The preliminary sketch which acco111pa11iel' tliis rt·port gin:s the l1ydrography of this rt'gion as far ns compl1·lcd.

He is of opinion that this channel may be usefuJ, if properly buoyed, as vessels pussiug through Nantucket sound would have the choice of passing out by this channel 01 by the VineJaril sound, and "at certain times of the ti1lc the curr1 nt is unfavorable in one place, while it is fa\'oral>le in the othn; r.ncl, owing to the different <lirrction11 of the two channels, the i:ame wind may be fair in one that is nhen1l in the other.

Yessel suffered damage, easily repaired, in her spars and sails, but no further. Her situation at one period of the ~ale is represented to bave been perilous. Two vessels undtr similar circurri11tanccs went ashore on Scituate rocks. After the season "'as so far 11ch·anced (September) as to render further work on Nantucket shoal8 impracticable, the i:ichooncr Gallatin, was employed in observations of currents in Boston harbor, wliich, by grt>at industry, were completed before the close of the season. Tidal obscn·ations at this important port have beun Jct.pt up throughout the year. · A report by Lieutenant Commanding Da,·is, on the necessity for a landmark upon Long Island, Boston ha!'bor, is hereto appende1l, (Appen1hx No. 8;) also a notic(· by the same officer of an invcn· tioo of Captain Owen, of the British naV.), designed to be used at Jight-l1ouses and light-boats, to give warning to approaching vessels during fogs, (Appenoix No. 9.) Lieutenant Commanding Davis acknowledges his obligations to Commodore Parker and to Captain Tatnall, of the Charlestown navy yarcl. 'ft.e office work, of this party during last winter, was quite arduous. The. notes of the hydrography of the South shoals, of Uoston harhor, and of Hyannis harbor, including soundings, currents, tides, aod sailing directions, were all copied, the reductions made, and tlit· work platted. Jn addition to this, Lieutenant Commanding Davi~ coutinuetl the discussion of the ti1lal observations at l<'ort Monroe. He also made an examination of Hell Gate, whicl1 will lie reported in its place in section II.

;Long Island; for filling up portions of hydrograpby; of additional magnetic observations; of the verification of topography near Hell Gate, and of the re·surv~y of Sandy Hook to ascertain its changes; of tidal and current observations; of additioual soundings for \he "estern sheet of Long Island, and for the otf·shore. chart, and of a re·cxaminatiou of .Buttermilk channel, near New York, ancl of the hytlrography of Hell Gate. This work has been executed from t!me to time, as parties could readily be disposed of from c.ther sectto11s. The clrawinit, engraving, and publishing of charts, which have rt'quircd the chief expenditure in the section, will be particularly spoken of with the otlice work, to which tht'y bolong. In e1uploying the zenith telescope by Captain Talcott's method , to obtain latitudt>, it is necessary, frequently, to use stars of which. · the.positions, as givtn in the catalogue, depend upon a few obse~ ,·ntions. · · ; '!'he nN:es\lity of better determinations, in mnny cases. presented· itself to us early, in the uso of this instrument. In the series at Fort Morgan, the second made upon the coast survey, the mean cat· alogue error wa11 greater than the mean probable error of a i;i'ngle observation with the zenith telescope. Many of the pairs employed \Vt·re beyond the range of the v.enitb sector, C$pedally with tbe first instruments used ,which did not admit of observations near the zenith. Cnptain T. J. Ler, who h1ul taken part in tbc~e ohsl·n·ations, 1u1u hail i:1een with rc·gret the impossibility of making use of all the pairs of, stars, until better .determinations were hacl, sug· gcsh·tl observations with thfl mural c1rde of the observatory of the militnry aca1lc·1ny at W, st Point, to determine the positions ol 11.ll the stal'S used, beginning with those which gave decidedly di!!··rl"r ..'. ant results. S.u1ih work is, perhap11 1 hardly to he expected front the regular ohscrvntions of nn observatory as usually organized, bowevn important to the coast survey. <?n application to professor Dartltitt, of West Point, he acceded with great cheerfulnf·s~ to · my l'l'qucst to permit the nt-c of the mural, nod furnishe1I most. liberally to Captain Lee every facility in making the observations, al'ld gave him the benefit of his advice and knowl·edgc in directing the 1·oune of observl\tion; insurin&: thereby the best application of Cal>taiu Lee's time nn1l ability as an observer. ''he obscrvutions for longitude have .been continued at Philadel· phia by P1ofessor Kendall,

of Crow' Shoal, surveyed by Major Bache in 1836, and Lieutenant Comman·ding Davis in 184.2-'43, and again during the last season, was also malie. 7. In connexion with the soundings near SanJy Hook, I sltould · mention that Sub-assistant S. A. Gilbert is under instructions to re-· survey the shore lines of the hook, to ascertain the progre;;s·which it has made, if any, since the survey of 1845. ·

8. l!ydrogr11.pl·y ·/ Hell Gate.-My attention wa~ especiaJJy calletl to the necessity for a more minute chart of this dangerous passage than was in the archives of the coast survey, by a corres· pondcnce with Schuyler Livingston, ef>q., cht1irma11 of the commit· tee of the chamber of com1neruc, of New York. Lieutenant Commanding Davis, who had made thti current 11nJ. tidal observations in Hell Gate, ii:i 18·!5, voluuleercJ, at n season of the year when it was certain thu work woul1l be anything but plcasaat, to make the additions required to the chart to adapt it to the immediate wants of thti chamber of commerce. The report presented by Lieutenant Commanding Davis, und the accompanyi11g chart, were forwarded to the chamlwr of commerce, anu their 1"f' ·dpt acknowledgt:d, by direction of the chamber, by the S<'cretary, Prosper M. Wetmore, esq., and complin1.entary rt-solution!! passed. (Appendix, No. 10.) This report was publislietl at ti1e tiru .. , but tl1e inquiries for it recently, which I havt: Aot been able lo answer by furnishing it, and the Yalue of the nautical suggestions which it contain!:!, induce me to appc1Hl it. to the present l't'f'ort. (Appendix, No. 11.)
9. This important 'York has been re:iumed by Lieutenant Com· wa·,ding Dnid D. Porter, Unite1I States navy, assistant in the coast survey, who ll'>~istetl in the surVl!Y formerly made, and to whose party the United States schoone1' Petrel !1as heen assigned. At li1e date of St>ptl'mber .23, about one· third of the hy1lrography lw·I bt'en compll'lcil, anil if the season proves favorable, I t!X· ii·:ct ti.flt he will complete the most essential part of it. The ptdorl for working to advantage in tl1is pal\suge is so hritif, illlU the irregularitlt!S Of the bottom SO great, that the nrea to UC sounded gives but little i.<lt!a of the time required for its complc.:. Hon. 1,000 soundiugs hne been mnde at the date of Lieutenant · Comman<liut;I Porter's report, and 61·' angles taken with the sex· tant, to establish hydrograpliic points. Tidal observations at every half hour of the duy anJ night have been macle, in conru·xion with the soua1ling:;. A n:port since received from J~ie11tenunt Cnmwanding Pnrtl.'r is inserted in tht' appendix No. 12, an<l has been communicated to the chaaber of commerce.

of late years hnvin~ "tery much changed the immediate shore line,. as well BA the positions in the interior, visible from the water ·. 11. Jlydograplty of Buttermill.: cliannel.-By special instructions\ from the Secretary of the 'freasury, a re· survey was made of this. channel to ascertain what changes, if any, had taken place in it within tlw last few yeari; 1 to furnish sailjug directions for it, and· to ascertain the proper place for buoys to facilitate its use. This hydro~raphy was placell in charge of Lieutenant Commanding David D. Portt!r, Unitctl States 111\'vy, assistant in tbe coast survey, who accomplished it between the 28th of August and the 8th· Sep· teu1ber, presenting an i11tcresti11~ report, which I give in the ap· pcr11lix, (No. 13.) In the execution of this work 1,500 soundint's' have been taken, and 135 nnglt>s mt>asuretl 1 with the sextant, m establishing the hydrographic points. The least water in the chan· n~I is five .fathoms. A chart on a large scale. will be at once prepan·cl and reported to the Treasury Department. '·
12. 1 em indebted to Lieutenant Commanding Porter for an ex· amiuation of the question of the location of a buoy in the channel· we11t of the I>ea Patch islanrl in Delaware river, which was. referred to me by the 1'.,ifth Auditor. It resulted in the recom· lllendation of replacing a buoy olf "Tom's Gut/' to mark the. chii.n-. nel, and of placing an additional buoy at the lower end of Pea .· Patch spit. A change in the mode of attaching the buoy to its anchor, by a ring playing freely through an eye instead of a shackle an~ bolt, was recommended by Li~utenant Co~manding · Porter, as likely to prevent the chafing which now rapidly takes. place, separating the buoy chain from the anchor.

13 .. Profest\or .Bailey, of West Point, prepared a report on the specimens of the bottQlU taken up jn soundin~s in this seciion. I referred to iis interesting examination and its results in my last report, and have presented his paper, through Professor Agassi%, to the American Association for the advancement of science, that it Jnay be put in the way of publication. It is accompanied by careful drawings of the organisms described, the character of which is.. highly praised by Professor Agassiz.· .

1. Primary triangulation across to Washington, and work n·rificl\tion.-1'wo stations were occupied by me before procet>cling to settion No. 1; one on the Magothy rh·er, near the shorcR of the Chei:apenke, and the other in Anne .Arundel cou11ty, Webb's hill, (sketch C.) The angks on all the stations visible from the first, seven in number, wert! meii::nr(·d; the lines which had grown up were opened, and the lint: to Marriott's was opened by Mr. Tliomas McDounell, un<ler my i1umt·<liatc direction. 426 obsenations were ma<le with the twci· felt thcoclolitc of the coast sun·cy, by Troup-hton and Simms, using Sc\·cnll·cn poi;itions of the i1111trumc·nt, 1rn1I 328 mcai;uns were made of c:ight angles. I also made a rcconnais!'ance before going to this station of the line from Marriott'i; to Soaper's, an<l !!atisficr.I 1.iyself that, without the aiil of cxtraorilirsary rtfraction, tl1e two stations wea:e not, as had been supposed, intcrvisible. Our occupation of the station on the Magothy . was prolonge1l by had weather to six weeks, during whid1 ti1ne the signal at Sonpl'r's was setn but thrcP timl·s. 'fhe intermediate sta· tion at 'VebVi: was next occupie<l, and 24.0 observations made in thirty-four positions of the theodolite on four stations. While there, I requested Assis.tant James S. Williams to reconnoitre the line from Wtbb's to Hill's, which, if practicabl<>, would improve the trillngu!nlion, and which, from previous reconnaissancP, had bet·n suppn~cd impracticable. He n·ported the line to be prncticable, hut tbe obstaclt s iu the way of complctt'ly O[>t·uing it were sud1 as to induce me to postpone to the winter the question of fiually opfning it. The occupation of but one additional station is rl.'IJUir· ed to conucct the Chesapeake triangulation with the \apit.ol anu 'Vashington observatory. The area covered by the triangulation was 346 square miles. 2.

Between the 5th of August and 12th of September, when the stu1oer Vixen was required by the Navy Department to be return ell, th·! party of Lie11tena11t Com mantling Lee, completed the sounding of 230 squarP miles, from Indian river 11outh to Beach hous·· signal, (see sketch C,) and off shore to a distance of from 10 to 15 miles, as far as th'e steamer could be seen by obsernrs stationed on the tripods of the signals. Within this limit lies Fenwick's shoals, bearing ee~t 7~Q north froin ~"enwiek's island station, distant 6~ miles, 11n1t ha\'ing 2! fathoms least water upon them. Lieutenant Commanding Lee recommends that a light-boat be Flacell within. these shoals, and that artificial marks be erected at different con:renient points e.loag the_coast,\so that the coasters who run. by the

In SeplE'inbt'r, Lieutenant Commanding Lee, in the brig Washiogto~, returned to the Chesnpeake, and before the close of the sea' son, NoHmber 16th, complote1I the hydrography of the section as far ~outh as the line (skctr.h C) Point no Point, Hilly Hammock, 1he Honga river, and Hooper's :iih'aits to Bishop's bead signal, on the eastern siill·, and the Patuxcnt river to St. LP.onard's creek. · This party, after closing the work in the irulf strrnm, mentioned in my last rPport, f'X<~cutl·d a portion of off·shore work sou<h of Cape lfonlopen, r11n11ing 100 miles of soun1lings, nnil coll(lcting c}111rncterii::ti<~ specimens of the bottom.

The' observations in the gulf stream were continued t~is year. by Lieutenant Comrnantling llichard Dache, United States navy, assistant in the coast survey, in the sh·am vessel Legaru, transferred by the Treasury Depnrtmc11t from the rcvcnuc m111·ine. Two sectio11s, i1eq1cndiculnr to the uxis of the i;trcam, Wt·re mnde between the 4th and the 25th of July, temperatures uciug taken from the surface to 600 fathomi;, in thirtrcn positions on the l.rst section, an<l froin tlu~ i;urfnce to 500 fathom~, in fourl<·t·n positions in the secoud section. The positions art· mark<'d on thti cl1art D bi's, where the sections .arc designated a~ lII. nntl IV., an<l the positions are numl,ered in tht' order in which they were occupied; the letter R, affixeo to the number of the po~ition, serving to distinguish tl1e work of the piirty of Lieutc-nant Co1n1m1n1ling Riclrnril Bache from thnt of Lieutenant Commn·nding Gcorg-c M. Dnchc, in 1846, and ot' Lieutenaut Commauding S. P. J,ec, in 18-17. · Obserntions .upon the S<'Clion southeast from Cape H cnry have been made for three consceutive years, to indicate the chailges in the distribution of the temperature o'f the ocean. In consequence of. the loss of the most trustwortJ.iy instruments, by the parting of the li11c in drawing it up, after a cast of 3,300 fathoms in llcp~h, off Hat.14'.·ras, tlic further prosccutio11 of t!w soundings for tcmpci·atA1)·c 1luring the! season was postponed, null .the L<'garc was uscJ for import:\(.lt service in another part of the.

Tlll! circu1Jista11c1:s were not of the most favorable kind, but son11~ adnntar~··, 11cvcrtl1<!11:1'1s, sct~ms to have been gained. Lit·Ull'nant Bache remarks: "Section Ill. was run by the brig Washington, iu 18 16, in nine days, cl<!nn positions being occupied, a111l in 18·17, in eighteen clays, thirteen positions Lcin1~ occupied. 1t took us <-ll·nn days, occup' ing thirkcn positious, anil t11ki1lg trn1p,·ratun:s to GOO fatlwms.

She is heavily mastt!d, and yet has not sail enough to drive her moderately through .the water in good sniling brco:es." . . "On no single day while running section III. could our sails be Usi.'tl to advantage in moving from one position to another. Re· turning, the section (No. IV.) was from latitude 30° 34' north, longitude 69° 36' west to cape Hntteras 1 on which we were occu· pit!1l nine days in making fourteen positit)n~, obsening the tempe· ratures to the 1kpth of fire hundred futhorns." Ilcl'i«lcs the i11strumcnts for a~ccrtninin~ tt·mperatures used last year, there were tried two Six's thermometers, by Bunten of Paris, for whid1 I nm indt·bte1I to the kinclne~s of Professor Aga~siz of C11111bridge, two lar~er .thcrinometers on the same plan by T;.1.glia· hue and Nl'gretli o(N!!W York, 1u11l n metallic thcru.ometer hf Mr. Saxton of the office of weights and measures, specially designed for this work. ) This latter rnstrument proHd decidedly the most conveni<.'11t, r<·quiring 110 covering to guard against pressure. It is shown in ~kcteh D bis, 11i11gram No. 4. The' thermometer coil is like that of llrt·guet, only of m111'11 11to11t1·r material, and of two metals, silHr an1l platinum, soltlcred together. The plan of regis· t1·ring resemble!! that niloptet.l by Juritensen of Copenhagen, and by · Montnru!on of Wa .. hin~toa, in their ml'lallin thermorneters. The lrn11cl ntlachcd to the tl1crmomcter coil pushes bcfor<> it, by a pro· je1·tir:g pin, a hand whicl1 mo,·es with a slight friction on the cen· tral axis. In the diagram, A is the hnntl attachcJ to the coil, antl ll the hand registering the Jowc:iit temper11ture to which thl' instru· II!t·ut has buen exposed. The brass work of the instrument was gil.tc1I so 1hat the sen wnter might touch every part of it without iujlny. ! The Six thermometers were used only at moderate depths. · · · A general comparison of the results of three consecuth·e years, a~ i<lwwn by tlJ1!·1.:un·c of t~mpcrnture fro.m n meau of observ.ations from 20 fo 120 fathomi::, nnd 120 to 480 fathoms 1 is ma1le upon sketch D tiis, diagram No. 1. The positions arc laid off at the top, a111I bottom of the diagram, und the tempe1·atures at the sides. The nbsr.issrc of thl! c11ncs corre~pont.l therefore to the positions, an<l tl1P nr1linates to the tcmpuatures. The two. branches of the ~ulf stream .shown in 18·16 reappear in tlu1 oLs,·nations of 1848. From causes beyond the control of the 11nrig-ator, the new oLservations do not seem to show whether i,n this )·rar thCl'c was more than this t.lh·ision. The whole tempera· · ture of lhc ocean w1111 hisl11:r in July, 18.18, tlrnn August, 1846 or181!7, l'M(ll't~inlly thv lower portions. Although the hottest part of the Hect ion was not struck in lS-!S, the cua'\'ll from 20 to l20 fathoms rist's l.J.t!nernlly above that of the other two years,.J\nd that from 120 to. 480 fatho11111 rises very greatly above th~ others. In alJ .Uiose curvl's it is seen that the point of highest temperature passes away from tlie shore !!idc of the diagram at the greater depths. The highest temperature frou1 the. mean of 20 to 120 fathoms was in 1846, about 130 nautical miles from Cape Henry, in 1847 about

{1]

.;40.

135 miles, in 1848 about 125 measuring upon a line perpendicular to the stream, or about southeut from the cape. The fact ot the big~er ·temperatures of the ocean at corresponding deptha 1 in section III. in 1848 th.an in 1846, is well illustrate1l by comparing the curves re·sulti11g from the mean of the observations in several positions beyon1{ the first branch of the gulf stream. In these <'urves, representing the law of change of tem-. neratnre with depth, the temperatures are laid off at the top of the diagram, and the depth at the sides, the temperatures being tbe absdsi:m, and the de11ths the ordinates. The mean curve derived from observations in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 an1l 6, showing the law of decrease of temperature from the surface to five hundred fathom!!, is contained in diagram No. 2 1 shtch D, tris. Its remarkable similarity to the correi;ponding curve on the same diagram, from position·s 8, 9, 10, ·11, 12 and 13, (corre~pon1ling in the observa· tions of 1848 to the positions of 18-17, first referred to,) strikes the eye, thet e being an exact parallelism in the two curves from one hundred fathoms to nearly five hun1lred fathoms. 'fhe whole of the former curve (for 18i7) is within the latter, the di!feren1:c of temperature below one hurulrcd fathoms blling nbout 3~ 0 at the same depth. The remarkable consir.tency with which the la\Y of change of temperature is deYcloped in all tl.ese observations, is'one of the most satisfactory points relating to th<-m 1 giving confidence in ·determinations which otherwise, from the Vl!ry variable circ111nstanct-s of the ocean temperatures, might fail to be accorded to them. The same form of curYe for the law of distribution of heat, in. the cold current between the shore and the gulf str<·am fthe cold wall) is clevelooed in the observations of the thrc·e ycnrs, ;;11 shown · by diagram No. 4, sketch D, tris. 'l'he C<'inC'iclence of these cun·rs with a logarithmic rnrve (the c·H\'t' of Nluilibrium in coniluctio11 . of heat) has bern already tlie suhject of r£"mark in a form1~r repo1t. The development was made from the observations of Lieutt·uant 1 ·Commanding C. H. Dnis, in 18!5. The diagram just referred to contains also the three curvPs cor· ·responding to the highei,;t tt'mperntures ohst·n·cd in Sl'Ction III. of the gulf stream in each y1·ar, the general similarity of wliich is vrry striking. 'fhe curves are from obi;t~rvutions by diffnt·nt observt:rs, with differPnt inslrumt·nt11, a111I hnV1! bel'n 1lrawn by me. from the notl'!I of 1·ach onl:' a11 received ~·11nr hy year, 1111tl therefore from 1liscu11sio1111i indf'penth·nt of Ntch othl'r.

The effect of the introduction of a disturbing c·ause to the equilibrium of ll·mJH'ra· · ture is well shown by the form of tJ.cse curve111, as nlso tl.c .t1·n· <lency to a common anti low temperature in tbe Jeep water of the ocean.

<>f tbis subject, so interesting in both a practical and scientific point of view. . · The results of 1848 have rendered probe:ble the curious fact that the cold in-shore wall is cut cttf at Cape Hatteras, the hot water or the gulf extending quite into soundings. The peculiar circum· stances of these observations ma1'e a confirmation dtsirable, but such is the result which now ·appear11. In diagram No. 4, (sketch. D, tris,) the two· inner curves snow the tempnntures on soun11ing1 in section III., while the fou·r outer ones, rising in temperature at the surface to 79~, so~, and 81, show·that the otf-shore high temperature is carried quite into the coast. Between this and the hottest pa~t of the gulf stream, no curve resembling the inner ones of 1liagram No. 3 occurs in a position which is fairly upon the section. A remnrkable uniformity in the temperature at the same depth is shown in positions 1, 2, 3, 41 5, and 61 of section IV., the distance bctwt·en l and 6 being 228 nautical miles. The mean tt>1nperature at the surface and down to 100 fnthotns, does not vary mort! than one· half of a degree of ~~ahre.nheit's thermometer from the ·two extremes at the cofresponding depth; from 100 to 200 fathoms, the Vl\riation tloes not exceed one degree; and at 500 fathoms, where· the difference is greatest, it amounts to five degrees on each (:ide of the mean. The temperatures at the !lllme depths, in the aoore southern sec· tion, in 1848, were lower than those of the more northern sectioa. The same fact was obsencd in regard to .sections II. and III., ia ·1846', pointing distinctly to the source of the difference in the re· sults obtained in Jitrerent seasons.
SECTION No. IV.

The l'Urvt·y hns been in full activity in this section during the past y(·nr; the opcrntions including reconnaissance of tliffcrent grade", !m·parations for the mt>asuremeut of. a base, astronomical observ11tirnfl, main, secondary and tertiary triangulation, topography nnd liy1lrogrnphy. Six parties have been employed tluring the whole or part of the season, and the '\\'Ork is rather more ail· '·anced thn I gave reason iu my last report to t'xpect that It would he. The tl'inngulation of Albemarle sound, and of the rivers, exr:ept the Cushni, Roanoke anil Chowan, is completed. The geographical positions Clf certain points are approximately fixed; the to~ pography of the shores of the sound and rivers is more than two tbirds done; tlie hydrography of the Pasquotank river is completed, and that of the sound has been commenced and made good pro· greu ·.

11ite of thll baNo has been approximately determined by the laller, who placecl signals at the extremities, made a rough measurement with a chain, nntl took the levels nece11sary for a profile. A signal was put up by Mr. Boutelle at the lloanakc marshes, to rcph\Ce thu light·houst', which hatl fallen ii') ruins since its use as a station )loint in 184:4, and a line openecl across the island to the north end of the base. In tl11J course of the various examinations in this quarter, facts 'Were ai;cert;iined in reference to the communicRtions which were <1pcucd in 1846 1 bet\\'t·.en the so\lnd and ocean ncl'o!'s llo<lics' island, 'vliich appear now to have grel1ter intP.1·cst than was nt first attached . to them, from the continued ,Jeeptoning of the southern inlet. I ~ave those which were coll1~ct~·d up to the time of my lai;t report in· the appen1lix, nnfl rrcapitulate the principal particulnrs, and add such new ones as have been collected in the appendix to the present· report No. i6. At the Inst examination in Mnrch, this inlet, which I have culled in rny pre"ious rcportf>l, nnd mal'ked upon the sketch accompanying it, as the inlet of 18~, though presenting six feet of water on lhe bar upon the seaward si<le, was ulosed by a "bulkl1ead" acroi;s the so.und entra11ce, having only three or three· and a lialf feel of watel' upon it. 'l'he ~reatest care will be taken to watcl1 Ilic progress of an entrance which may become so important to the navigation of Pamlico nntl Albcmal'lc sounds, or which, as is 1uorc probable, from the geuel'al laws ncting on tl1is extensive re· gion of the coast may close unless artificially kept open. This is the inlt:t which was entered by tht! Eomall steamboat Oregon in 184:8·

.Measurement of base.-'I'lrn preliminary steps of nligning the and 11111rking it out, gr\\ding, st>lection of a camp, &.c., were satisfactorily taken by Assislnnt C.·O. lloutclle, or under his direction.

Alabama, Miaai1Sippi, and pa.rt of Louisiana.

The primary triangulation in this section has, during the past year, been extended westward, nearly to 'the Jim its of the second· a ry ancl the t>ntrnnce to Lake Borgne. Astronomical observations have bet·n made at one station. The triangulation of l\rohill' bay has bemt nearly completed. The 1opograpliy of the islanrls off the coast of Alabanrn an1I Mississippi, an1l lsl.e au Pied, off the coast of Louisiana, lias lwt-n completed. 'l'he topography of the main shore bai; been ciirrie1l from Fowl ri\'cr, l·tnptying into Mississippi soun1l, to Pascagoula dver. TIH! sou11-iings of the entrance to Mobile bay, for a harbor !lheet, have bet-11 complded, ns also the Roundings of Cat and Ship i11lan1l harbors, ar11I of their approaches. 'l'idal obser\'atious hare been ke}'t up at };'ort Morgan, Hound island, un<l Cat island. Complete obsc:rYations for the direction and velocity of currents ha\'e been made at \wo stations. Ne11r the point now reacl1e<l on thi!I part of tht.' coast by the triangulation, it lmwclu s-one branch pas~ing over the shores of Lukes Doq~ue afl'<I Ponchartrain, to New Orlcani:-tht~ othn main branch passing dowu the coast of Louisiana, by the Chandeleur islands. The 011e through tl1e lakes, as necessary to complete thti connexion betwct'n .Mobile ancl New Orlea11!1 1 will be undertakr.n first,. and can, in great part, b1i. accomplished clurin1{ the season about to commence. Materials now exist for the la111I work of nearly two · sbN·ts of tlw coast map projccte1l for tlii~ section, nnd for tlw hydrugn1pi1y of three har!Jor sheets, and nearly the whole of one cout sheet. '!'hey are in progress of co1J1putatio11 and ri:duction. fhc iirst chart will be one of the entrance to Mobile bay, the drawing of which is now cowrnenced. The autlwrities of the city of Mobile have cor1tiuue\I to rnanifest that solicitude, in regard to the .progress of tl11.· survey, to which I had occasion to refer in my last report. A correEZpt>udence of Lieutenant Commanding Patterson, the assistant charged witJi the hydrograplay of this section, \rith the mayor of Mobile, with the very cgmplunentary resolutions of the council, are given in the l\ppcrt· dix to tl1is report, No. 17.

1. Primary triangulation and secondary c.onnected with it.-This triangulation (see sketch F) has been under the charge, as heretofore, of Assistant F. H. Gerdes, who bas carried it westward to Ship islan1I, besides making a rt>connaissance in section IX., and another in i;ection VII. A .dangerous illness, resulting. from exposure in the former reconnaissaract!, had nearly deprived the sur· vey of the services of this \'aluable assistant. l'ro\·idence has spared bis life to his friends and to the work. With characteristic zeal, he bas labored successfully at a season when he ought to have claimed a respite from field work, to make up for this drawback to

his progress. The number o! primary stations occupied has been

Eakin, anti has been carried during tlic season from near the entrance to Choctaw Point; requiring only tl1e connroxion with the primary triang1Jlntion to furnish poiuts for tl1c plane table nncl hydrographic surveys of the bay, (see.sketch F.) The reconnaissance of the bay, made by Assistant F: 11. G1·rdl·s in 1846 1 was extended by Assist11nt Eakin up the delta of the l\Iobilc river to about five miles aboYe the city; and signals for the triangulation of the bay were put up between the 16th of DHcmber nn1I the 29th of March. On the .21st, the triangulation was commenced; an<{ between that period and the 9th of June, eight stations lVere occupied, at which .2,106 obsen·ations were made with a twelve inch repeating theodolite, by Patten, upon 58 objects, consisting of 38 stations, ·13 signals, 3 light·housrs, 2 spirts aud 2 academics. It was necessary, generally, to elevate tl1e instrument abo,·c the groun<l on a tripo\I, The area embraced is 188 s11uarc miles. Mr. Eakin was assisted by l\fr. Spencer McCorkh'. Duriug pnrt of the season the party had the use of the rennue cutter Wolcott, nn1l, for the greater part, of the United Stntes schooner Phronix. ,l\fr. Eakin acknowledges the cheerful aid re1ulert:tl by th1.1 ollii.:ers of the Wolcott. Inslrnctions have been issued for the resumption of this work as . soon as the season will permit. · .

4. Tapogtaplty.-Tb.e topography. in this section has. been exe·. cuted by a~sistant E. Groenwc!J, whose party took tlHl field on the 4th of J1111uary, anti closed ·their duties for the season on the 171h <Jf July. · . . · Notwitlistnn11ing the 1lclny caused by the illness of Mr. Grcen'\Hll during part of ~farch an1l April, an<l the want of suitable fa· Cilitics for transportation in the early part of the season, his work hns .made satii;factory progress. Shllets Nos. 11 5. 7, 6 and 4 1 (sketch F,) haYe been completed, the to~ograpl1y of Isle au Pied, on the Louisiana coast, having been left rncomph:te last year.

The main shore is chiefly flat and marshy, and much cul' up by bayous; it has been surveyed &ack to the pine growth on the fast la1ul. Mr. Green· wtll l1as the use of a 1:1.nall_schooner belonging to the c~ast sun·ey. 5. llydrograpliy.-The l1yclrography of this section has been ex .. cutetl by the pa1·ty under the command of Lieutenant C. P. Patterson, Unitell States navy, assistant in the coai;t survey, firi1t in the schooner Forwar<l anll tlu~n in the steamer R. J. Walker. The steamer was trnnsfcrred from the rc\·cnue marine to the coast survey by the 'l'reasury Department, the use of steam VE'ssels for the rHenue sen·ice having been abandoned. The party left New York for ·Mobile on the 20th of Noremher, and returned to New York on the 29th of July; the sounding work was done from January 6 to li'ebruary 11, in the sailing nssel, and from tl1nt date to June 24 in the steam \'esscl. The sounding11 of the <-ntrance to Mobile bny 1 and of Cat and anil Ship island harbors, anu of their approaches, have been com· plcteJ, making, together, nn 1trea of am square miles, anil 2 1208 linear miles surnyed. Three permanent title stations were occu· pie<l; at Fort Morgan, entrance to Mobile bay, the tides were obsernd hourly for fifteen hours of the twent:;r-four; at th~ west e111l of Cat island every hour; and at Round island light, Mississippi sound, erery two houu. The number of current stations occupied for observations of currents wu scnn; at two of which complete results were procured. The sketch F shows the limits of the sounll· ing sheets Nos. 2, 31 and 4 1 an1l localities of the tidal and cum:nt observations. The results of the a\·crage of January nn1l July tides at Mobile Point anll Cat island is shown upon sketch F, bis. 'l'he normal ti(le rise11 anti falls once in twenty-four hours nearly; the time of high water being displaced is bttween 6 and 9 hours from January to J\1ly. '!'he subject of these tides is un1lergoing investigation, the tidal obsen·ations bi:ing in the hands of compu· tors for reduction. A llirect comparison of the use of sails an1l fiteam, under the cir· cumstanc('s of this part of the work, was 11ad by this party. After making all necessary allowance11 in the comparison, the expense of soun1liniz out a giYen area by a sailing \'cssel an1l a steam \'cssel · was as five to three, presenting an .economy of forty per cent. in favor of steam. 'l'he absolute cost per day of the steam vessel to the survey was nearly three titl)es that of the sailing nssel; the amount of work <lone fi\'c tim<-s. Lieutenant Comman1ling Patter· son remarks: "It must be statecl 1 however, that the most tconomical use of a steam('r is in ntf-shore or sea work, or where the proportion of boat work is small, ns thu boat work r.an certainly Le done uiore cheaply from a sailing \"esst:I than from n i;tearnn, but little work being done in th<: nsi:cl; in tliis cast>, she is mcrt.·ly usl'll as a floating boariiing·house, and for transportation from place to place. ll is only, then, when the principnl part of the work is to be <lone in the ".esscl, which is the case in all off-shore or sea work

o.n<1 about one-half of tlic in-shore or bay an<l harbor work, that a stcnmcr can be economically U!1ed. In this respect our localities were ngninst the steamer, as fully one·haH of tbe work hail to be done in boats." To this should be a1hle<i the statement thl\t the steamer Walker is larger an1I more powerful tha11 is necessary for this particular part of the sun·cy. ·· The account of the changes going on at the entrance to Mobile bay, shows the very great importance of careful examinations from time to time to <levelope tlleir causes. 'fhe dellth of 201 feet in . the ch11nnel over the bar was again nrifie<l by the soundings of Lieutenant l'attcrson . . "At the entrance to Mobile bay the islands are stiH un1lergoing changes, as is tf\e -southwest side of Mobile Point. Sand island, urion which stands the outer light-house, ·has lost a strip the whole length of the eastern shore, from 66 to 100 yards in width, about 200 yards from its northeast point; and has made out on its north shore, abreast the light-house, about 233 yarrls during the last · yc·l\r. Mobile Point hi\s made out to the southwar1l and wes\\vard during the Inst few ycar11, so far as entirely to change a range by which the east bank was cleared in going up. Little Pelican island, a scnall san<l knoll which, in June, 184:71 was three feet a.hove low water, has entir~ly disnppearetl, leaving a shoal with two or three feet water upon it. This knoll constantly appears and <l i1'1appears at .in tcrva Is of several months, as it may be 'cut otf' or 'ma1le up' by strong tides and heavy gales. The north point of Pelicrm islan1I still 'makes out,' while the Ollposite shore of Dauphin 1\as 'cut out' in the same degree, leiw\ng the distance be·. tween them the ume and not affecting the deptl\ of the water." "About Grant's Pass, between Little Dauphin island and Cedar Point, the shoal and oyster beds, b.ire at·Iow water, are undergoing cbnnges.'' .

"At Ship island the so11thwei,itern shore of the west end is slowly" making out in the same manner as that of Mobile Point, and which, frolll the great similarity in the conditions of the two localities, must

Important hytlrographical information in regard to this part of the coast is gh·en in a letter from Lieutenant Com1unding Pat- · terson to Captain Scott, royal na,·y, who had referred to him in reference to anchorages suit11-ble for the British West India mail steamers.

SECTION JX.

·From Vermill\on bay to tlie boundary, including the coast of part of Louisiana a?;d 1'e:ras.. . .
During the past year the preliminary operation of reconnaissance has bel·n brought to a dose, as far as is nect>ssa.ry for commt·ncing the triangulation, the geograpl1ical position of a point in Gnl\'esf.on b11y, near tht! city, has been detcrminc1l, antl the point has bcc:n approximately connected with a coast trnrHy stnti<'n in srction VIII. at Pascar,ouln, by chrnnomett·1· difl'ereuces of longit111h-; a base line lrns bc·cn approxiurntdy nien1wred; and the triangulation of Galnston bay h11s bcc:n co10menct·1I; a rcconnai!lsance for a.hase line on· Galnston islantl hns b1·en mnde. The ·suncy has thus made dut~ progress, and the c:stimate's of the prt sent year pro\'ide for the triangulation of Gah·eston upper anil Jon·er bay, and for 1rnrt of the topography; an1l, if tl1e progress of 1he lnnd work for tlw season renders it a1hisable, of a commencem<·nt of the hy· llrography. The best metl1od of working in this section yet remains to be deYelopc1l; but the arrangt·na·nts alrt·a<ly ma1le for t:.c coming season will resolve the doubts which are now entertained. The triangulation party is under instructions to proceed to Galveston ns soon as the ail\'ancc of the working season permits. · 'fhe most cheering evidences of inter eat in the commencement of the const surHy in this section ha\'e been gh·en by the citizens of Gah·l'ston, who have manifested great kindness to thr persons com· posing the parties, and full appreciation of thdr labors.
I. Reconnai'ssonr.e.-At thr. date of my last report, Assistant F. H. Gen\es was under instru.ctions to proceecl, as early as he j111lged it safe to do so, from his\vork in Mis11it-:sippi, to make n reconnais· sance of Gal\'eston bay n111I of its Yiciuity, f'Xt1·nding it ns far

'!'bis work has bt~n ncc1rn1~ plishecl with his usual skill anti intclli~cnc·e, anil Isis excc·lll·nt re· port enabled me to give at once instructions of a dl'finiti; character to a triangulation party for this SHtion.

Mr. Gcrdl·s rccommendetl that t11e base line pre\·ionsly laid out on Boli\'ar l'oint shouhl be adopted only provisionally, 111111 pro· posed for minute exan1ination a site on Gah·eston islaud, present· ing equal facilities for measurem1>nt, and for communication with Galnston.

gle11 1 were marlc in hnportant cases. Tl;e character, position, ele·, vation, and materials of the signals necessary for the triangulatio"- . are discussed; the facilities for procuring materials and· their cost, an economical mode of procuring materials from section VIII. is proposed. The conclusion in regard to the triangulation is, that the main s·eries, with means for supporting the instrument and signals for obsen·ing upon, of a kind already approved, may hue sides of from twel\'e to fifteen miles in length. ·

.lhtronomical observationt.-The astronomical and magnetic ob· . sen·ations 1 anti the triangulation in this section, were under the charge of Assistant R. II. Fauntleroy; to whose party Assistant Julius E. Hilgard and Sub·assistant George Da\·idson were at· tached. Mr. Hilgard assisted chiefly in the astronomical observations near Gah·eston 1 and Mr. DaYidson in the observations for. difference of longitudes by chronometers, m11king the observations for time and chronometer comparisons at Pascagoula. The station . selecte1l for astronomical observatio1u1 was Dollar Point, (see sketch G.) 'fhe latiturlc was observed with a ienith telescope, by Simms of Lonilon, macle <or the coast survey, used as in Captain Talcott's, method. One hundred and for.ty-twQ determinations were made. on fifty-two pairs o( stars. 'l'hc azimuths were obtained by obser· vations of Polaris nnd o ursm minoris· at elongation, and of Polaris at.variou:1 hour-angles, forty-fi,·e· determinations being wa<le 1 and fifty· five horiion tal nn !?I es measured (telescope tli re ct and rcv~rsed) to connect the elong-atton mark with the main stations at Smith's J>oint anti lloli\'ar Point. 'fhe observati~ns \YCre made ·with the two theotlolitcs refcnc1l to in speaking of the triangulation. 11011 trnnsits were taken with the Hassler transit instrument of the coast survey; thirty of these were moon culminations for longitu(lc; six hundred nnil twenty were in connexion with observations of moon culminations~ occultations, azimuths an(! latitudes; three hundred and fifty-seven for the chronometer difforencu of longitude of J~ast l'ascagoula station and Dollar Point, and thirty-four. for investigation of the instrument itself. Two o.ccultations were observed at Dollar Point; that of Al1lebaran ori the 10th of March, and of p' Sagittarii on the .21st of May. Magnetic oQservations were made, in connexion wit.h tho fore-· going, by Assistant R. H. Fauntleroy with a portable cleclinometer and magnetomete.r by Jones, (No. 2 1 coast survey,) ancl a new dip· .circle, (No . .2, coast sun·ey 1) by B.arrow of London. Four deter· minations of the tleclination, (n1riation 1) by observing the maximum and minimu1il; were ma<le; three of horizontal intensity, and six oC: clip, the sets of each kind being made (In as many different days.· Two determinations for momen\ of inertia, and one for correction of tcmper~tllre of the magnet, were made. Triangulation.-Three main stations were occupied, and three hundrc.J and forty·two measurements of angles made with the twelve-inch .Troughton theodolite, or the ton·incb coast survey theodolite, of the old collection, ("E pluribus ~num.") At each

[l]

54

of the 'first and second stntfons, fifteen points were observecl upon, and at the third 11ix points, (11ee sketch G.) The provisional base line on Bolh·~r Point was measured by '!Ising a wire 348 metres in length. A reconnaissance "''as ma<le for a bar.e line on Galveston island, and a ~uita~le site _found for a b~sc .of about s!x mile11 in length. This site will require less labor m its prefaration for the measurement than that at Ilolh·nr Point, and wi l furnish grl'ater facili· ties of sure comruunication with Galveston. It is not exposed, according to the opinion of Mr. Fauntleroy, to inroads from the ocean. Mr. Fauntleroy was engaged in making magnetic observations in sectio,n IL until the close of the autumn. Ile reached Galveston on the 14th of February, an cl at once commenced his work, ·which was· brought to a close by the ad\'Pnce of sumnier, on the 22d of July. The party has had the use of a schooner helonging to the coast survl'y, sailed by Mr. Andrew J, Hussey, of Alexandria, "·ho has given entire satisfac~ion in the execution of the contract for sailing the Yessel and pro\·iding for the crew', Since the close .of. the season, Mr. Fauntleroy has been engaged in recomputing observations of previous years, which his constant employment in the field had hitherto prevented. In this he has been aided by Mr. Di\\'iclson. The party is under instructions to resume the triangulation in section IX. as early as practicable.

OFFICE WORK.

The organization of the office has continued during the past year as it \Us at the period of my last report. The extl!nsion of the work has required the employment of additional persons in connexion with it, rendering changes cl~sirable, whirh the exertions of Captain A.· A. Humphreys, United States topographical engineers, the assistant in charge, ha\'e prevented from becoming pressing or detrimental. The services of this oflicer to the goyernment, in this work, hue w.t:ll merited the promotion which he bas received from seniority; an1l I ,..,.ould respectfully call the'attention of the head of the Treasury Department to them, anti would ask that representations may be made to the proper au.:. thority in relation to them. As the detail of office:rs of the army is made upon the coast survey under the law, I do not doubt that meritorious services are to be noticed in this, as in any other duty require1I of them. Besides conducting the general concerns of the office, Captain Humphreys directs, personally, the details of computing and dnwing, and inspects every department of the office, including the en· graving, printing, and instrument making. As he admin:sters this branch of the worlc, there is no position of assistant of greater importance to the success of the whole. The engraving iHJd printing are under the immediate <lirec-

By monthly reports and proof sheets of the engraYings, all the Jetnils of the establishment are laid before the supcrint1mdent. The followin~ progress hi.ls been made in the several depart·· ments of the oflice during the past year. ;

Cc11np1ttations.-Captain T. J. Lee, United States topographical engineers, as~istant in the coast survtiy, has been engaged under my general clirt~clion during a portion of the past year, in putting in form the r<lsults of the work in i-ts ditfertlnt branches, during the prHious year, and in recornputations and comparisons. He has been assistE:cl by Mr. J. H. Lane, whose appointment as as· sistant examiner in the Patent Office has deprived the coast sur· vey of one of its most promising junior members. The compu· tations made by Captain Lee were of latitude observations at Taylor's and Poole's island, on the Chenpeake, (Sec. III.,) and at the Isle of Shoals and Agamenticus, (Sec I.,) in 1847; of ma(;· netic obserntions in sections I. and III., of the year 18-17 1 and Ul section IV. in 1846 and 1847; in computations to form the basis of a discussion by the superintendent of all pre,·ious magnetic. observations; the recomputation of observations for latttude at Thompson's station, section I., comparisons :with duplicate compu .. tations and making the final corrections. . · Mr. Lane had commenced, also under my immediate direction, the determinations of the equations of condition, at thti stations of the primary triangulation in. section I., by the method of least scpinrcs, and hail coinpletc<l three important stations before leaving the office. 'l'hc computations relating to longitudes, by Assistant S. C, Walker, have been continued with his usual diligence. His labors hare contributed to th1! coast surYey archives no less than fifteen reports within the past year; many are, of course, temporary in their'cliarnctcr, but some of them so elaborate that they might rather be called scientific memoirs. I subjoin their titles, witb a brief statement of their contents: · l.

The 1liscrt·pa11cy is too grrat to be nscribc1l to the 11cddc11tal t?nor pf either group of pl1c110111t·11a. It indicates a coni;taut error in one 1111.:tho1I or the other." "In searching for the source of such a constant error, I am unable to detect 'one of so great an amount in the mcthocl of moon culminations. The prculiar C'Xctllcncc of this mcthocl consists in its removing the constc.nt errors of the lunar elements anti of the

It can har1lly be ascrihecl to the resi1l11al personal error of the average of three persons in America, and of more than a dozen in Enrope, in ju1lging of the time of contact of a limb with a wire. Still less can it be ascribed to that optical itnperfec· tion of the groups of telescopes employed, called irradiatioti." "With rc·gartl to the other class of phenomena, the lunar occul· tations an1l eclipse~, a constant source of error may exist in the mean rnlue of thtl moon's l1orizontal equatorial parallax, on which llurkhardt's tables are based." · · · ."" · · ''I do not hesitate to attribute in a grt~at degree to this source alone, [this resi1lual phenomenon.J Other circumstancr:s tcncl strongly to co11firm this' hypothesis.

The questions, as they h1we arisen, ha\'e .been met in such a way as to insu1·e progress in the. l'ight direction, without being daunte<l much by the olistacles which a close study of the subject· Ly .!\Ir. Walker anti others found in the way. A superficial examination of' a subject, or the taking for grnnteJ of a prescribe1l routine,· is apt to impress oi1e with notions ef the great accuracy of. p1·o.cesscs and rcsults 1 in which are concealed constant ·errors of grave importance.' Turning up the surface, cle,·clopes these conccalctl errors, an1l leads to scientific discovery. The ac· tion of different min1ls accelerates the progress of truth, and on thir. account I hne published the report of Assistant S. C.

They present an outline o(

work which oniy a most resolute and zealous computer aould ture to trace. The chief suggestions, relating to computations, are · as follows:

'fen·

1. "To employ a greater force of computers, nnd urge forward, by every possible means, the reduction .of the American observa. tions of 1noon culminations, from 1842 to 1846, using the blank forms of the survey." 2. "'fo employ a1lditional force in forming the conditional equations for the eclipses and occultutions, with corresponding meridian observations in Europe, to the end of 18-16; also, accord.ing to the coast survey forms." 3. "From the report of Professor Airy, and from any other available sources and subsidiary computations, to find the most ·plausible theort:tical elements.for the moon's place on the nights of the American observations." 4. "'l'o apply these values to the con<litional equations in articles 3d and 4th, so as to render the residual error of theory the least pos~ible." · 5. "'l'o complete the discussion of the value 122''.37 of the coefficient of the parallactic equation, given by Professor Airy. For' thi!! purpose it will be ncct>ssary to extend the discuHion which Professor Airy has limited to the instruments of Greenwich nn<l C11mbri1lge, so as to include all those in which the transits nnd altitu1lcs of both limbs of the moon hne been observed at tbc same time in any country, so as to decide whether the theoretical co· elficicnt of 122''.3i, or a more plausible empirical one, is to be adopted in the longitude computations of the coast survey." 6. "To institute a full dis;ussion of all the obst·rvations o( occultntions of the stars in the group of the J>Jeindcs extant in any l:ountry. '!'his discussion is earnestly recomrneruled by 13cssel us · certain to afford more pt:rfect data than those from any other source for the dett·rmination of longituucs, a111l for the correction of the moon's par11llax and semi-diameter." 7. "To r<·!wlve, by the method of h·nst squnrcR or othcrwisP 1 all the conditional cc.1u4tio11s so obtainc1l, after applying ail the theo· retica) and empirical corrections to the lunar constants uud co· effi1~ien1s, so as to obtain the most plausible value of the correction · of the longitu1lc of our own carJ.inal point from the averngc of tl1e European merictians." · · For the entire report I refer to the Appendix, No. 19. 'fhe comparisons of the o~sen·ations of moon culminations for tl educing longitudes· has been continued by Lieu tenant J. l\I.

Eslimatea for flu. tae:rt fiscal y~ar.-'l'hese estimates are founJed upon preci!le d11tn, irnd the regular extension of the work in those section11 in which preliminary operations havA been carried on fot the last one or two year!!, with a ''iew, as stated in my reports, to this extension. I have presented, rf'peatf'dly, the considerations oC economy upon whid1 1rnch an extension was based, nnd have shown how that economy was produced. It is not always recollected tha.t these approprintions cover the cost of reducing, drawing, Pngraving, and publishing the work as well as of the field work. The cost of the field work, all computations included, i'l hut about he-sevenths, or seventy-two per cent. of the whole work. 'With an expenditure during the survrying year, 184:7-'48, now reporter!, of about one hundrecl 111111 fifty·fh·e thou~an1I dollars, we have kc~t thirty· seven pnrtie11 in the fiel1I in ditforent section11, not counting those employed occ11sior.nlly, which would swell the list considerably, while for 011e hundred thousand 1lollars, in 1844, but fifteen parties WPre kept up, exhibiting an increase of field work of two and a hnlf times, for an exru~r111iturc of less than one an1l six-tenths, or an economy of three-eighth!! made. The work done in connexion with the ollice has been increased in a somewhat greater ratio, being now between two and a half and three times what it was in 1844, so that the economical result is greater, on the whole, than that jutit stated. · , To this l might acid that the extension of the work has been in · the southern ~t·<:tions, where the. t'Xpenses are much grenler than · in tne northern, ancl most of the parties hr.ve r«'quired vessels, ·instruments, ancl other outfits, which, although they remain the · property of the Rurvey, must be ,pnid for from the annual appro· priations. These will Sl·rve in part as a Ret·off to the a1lditional . relief to the appropriation from tht1 war and navy departments. If the estimates for the d1tfnt·nt Sl'ctions are cnmpnr.-d with· those of last year, it will be found that the increase is in those which were com111encecl in that year, or the year before, and ln which tlic opnatious were only preliminary, 1\9 in se11tion v. the coast of South Carolina aud Georgia; ot section VII. on the coast of Florida, and of Sl'ction IX. on the co11st of 'a'exas. The expense of transporting the land pa~ties to the western coast, which bean a large proportion to the cost of their maintt>nance there, has bet'n already incurred. . ·· · This plan for developinl!' the work was brou~ht forwa.rd in my rerort of 1846, in which the following statement will be found:" tis e. sily Hen that, by this plan the survey, of the whole coast may be co'mpleted within a very limited period of time, the number of sections under survey at the nme ti~e determi11ing the period of completion of the entire work. Each section in which all .the operations are in progrus upon the present acale will cost about.. 6

or

[1]

66

twenty-five thousan<l dollars per annum, compr1S1ng the cost of :fie!d work, of reduction and publication of results. This estimate suppo!les the !lame proportional ai1I h11retofore had under the law, from th .. senit·es of officers of the army an1I navy." "Before thP clo!'e of the fiHal year of 18-17-'48, the survey 'Will he in full activity in six 11cction!I, ancl may be cnrrie1I on successfully in them for one h11n1lred anti fifty thousand dollar11 per annum, with the 111ldition of 1mch suiru1 R!I may lrn nPces1H11·y fro111 1ime to time to lDt!et the gennal it1~111s of cx1wr11liture, such as procuring instrum1~nts, the increase in numbt!r and i111provt'ment in quality oi which are absolutely n1·cessary; tht' hire or pur1:hase of the small nssels neerled for the parties in the southern sections; currt"nt t>Xpense~ of ''essel!'l; genernl oflice exp1·nst"s, anil the like. ThP 11sP of !ot1·am n·ssels upon the work wo11l1I iul'rcase the expen.c]it11r·· for l'Prtain year11, but would be t'Conomical iu re~i!11I to the amount of work which they would enable the hyrlrographic parties to do in a gi,·en time." Expericnee has confirme1I the statement thus made, the results )Hoducerl for the fiscal year 18!7-'48 just passed, and the expenditures having been in strict conformity with t.hem.· The appropria· tion for the next y«>itr provides for the continuution of publication -0f th!! back ,. ork in section II.; for lull acti,·ity in !lt"ctions I., III., IV., V., VIII. 11n1l IX., such as the progre11s of the work in these 11ections calls for, an1I the continuation of preliminary work in sections VII. and X., besides the gl'neral office work. This is equinlrnt to work in .veven sect-ions, auil intro1luces the sun·ey into C\'ery State on the Atlantic and gulf of .l\lcxico, and extencls 1t to the Wt'Stnn coast. Steam has been introduced upon the work, 2nd has bet>n used in four sectlon11 during the past year, but the expen11i:ure per 11ection· ha:: not been increased ht"yor11I the limit thl'n propo11ed. I 'have no doubt t.hat eii.:ht section!' mii,:ht be put un1ler sun· .. y for two hundred thousa111I dollars, including the JHt·paration and publication of the re!!ults as the survey a1lvanci::d. The reiative economy of work done to expenditure woul1I be still somewhat great.-r than at present. The reguln progrrss of the fiel1l work in the 1lilft"rent 11rctions, and of thP oliiee work, including computation11, drawing, engraving, J>rinting, &.c., will admit of the following opt:rations, requiring at le:ist the t!Xpt·nditures assignrd to them. They arc clnsse1I, t·xcept the usual general items, under the hea1I of the "geographical sec· tions. 'l'lre estimate11 suppoi:e the usual ai1l from the war and navy dt>par1mcnts.

Notice to Mariner1.
The following discoveries and determinations, recently mnile by the hydrographic party of the coast survoy, employed on the Nan· tucket shoals, under the command of Lieutenant C. H. Dilvis, United States navy, are of sutficient importance to be cou11nuni· cated immediately. They will be transferred, at the close of the · season, to the preliminary chart of the NantU(.!ket shoals:

75

[1]

1. A shoal 2b to 3 miles long, making off from the southern ex· tremity of Great Rip, with whi<;h it is connected by a short ridge of 3! fathoms. This shoal lies in a N. by W. and S. by E. llirec· tion, (mag.) and has only 8 feet on it in scYeral places. The distance between the eastern end of the south sboal and the new cli:termination is only 61 miles, and .the southern limit of danger on Great Rip is 15 m)les from the shore. Vessels pa.ssing to the £:outhward of Great Rip, or to the eastward of the olcl Nantucket South shoal, shoul1l be careful to govern themselves accord-

· 'l'he centre of the 11hoal bears from Sanknty Head $; E., ! E., (mag.) and S. 62° 30', (true,) 13~. miles dii::tant. 2. ·A small shoal, having only 8 fl.et of water on it in one spot, which hf'1ir~ N. ~ W. (mag.) antl N. 11° W. (true) from eastern end of olcl South shoal, 4l miles distant. · . 3.

Herc they will have a good beating channel of at least two miles, i: e., from half a mile-to two and a half miles from the "Old Man.'~ Vessels taking this course with an ebb (or wcstnly) ti1le, will -0lear the shoals in a few hours. They will also have more room, and be more· fitvored by the prevailing westerly winds than in the sound. Superintendent U. 8. Coad 8vrv·N·

APPENDIX No, 81 BH.

DosToN, 'No11ember 22, 1848. DEA~ S1:a: Yours of, .the 14th w~s received ·to~clay, and I send below, as requt>slecl, a hst of the d1scoverie11 of the season: · 1. A shoal 2~ (two and n half) mile11 long, making oil' from the southern extremity of Great Rip, with which it is 'connected by a short ridge of 3! fathoms. T.liis shoal lies in a north by west and south by east djrection, magnetic, anti has eight feet of water on it · in several places. · . · . 2. A small shoal having only tiight (8) feet of water on it, to the . horthward of the eastern end of the old South shoal. 3. Another small shoal, with 16 feet on it, a little to the northward of the fornlllr. 4. A slllall i;hoal spot to the eastward of the south end of Bass

5. A small spot to the northward of the Bass Rip, with ten (~O) fret on it. 6. A long bank to the eastward of the shoal, marked No. 1 on this list, upon which I found four (4) fathoms in two places, four miles apart. The sea was breaking on it whilst I was tlu~re, the result of a heavy swell from the southward and eastward. · I was ur1able to determine the extent of this bank, owing to the pad weather and the lateness of the dii:cov~ry. '!'he further exami· nation of thifl bank next season will be a point of great interest.

Sankaty head, Nantucl·et. ·. .
OFFICE OF THE COAST StrRVEY'

Washington, December 21, 1847,

Sui: My frequent navigation among the South Shoals. of Nantucket, on the survey of which I have been employed <luring a part of the two Jast seasons, has enableil me to perceive that a light of suitable dimensions and power upon Snnkaty head, near the point of triangulation of ~he coast sunt'y, woulil be ge11cr1tlly as well as locally useful. · The labors of the survey in this region ha,·e already resulted in the discovery of several unsuspected dangers, too im11ortant to be hereafter neglected. Other dangers probably remain to be found out. Dut the coast sun·ey is about to confer another ad\"antage equally as great, by the publication of its chart of the Nantucket shoals. Channels, known only to fisherm<·n nn1l local pilots, nre to be rendered practicable to all navigators. Full and distinct iriforrnation concerning the force and diret'lion of the tides, (withc11t wl1ich, it is felt, tl111t there is no i;ecurity,) is to be communicated. Instructions for the go\'ernment of vessels unintentionally in\'olveil amoni; the shoals are to be ginn, and 11ailing dir('ctio11s are to be prepar~d for the principal passages, by means of which the preseut routes will be shortt-ne<l, and this unknown part of our shores, that has hith.erto been regarded with dread, will Le habitually traversed with safety an<l a1lvanta~e, especially Ly the southern and New England coasters and the \Vei;t I111lia tratlers. In short, the benefit conferred by the coast survey chart of the Nantuckd f'hoals, when compl<:tecl, will be such as is dt'sirecl from all its publications, that of waking the u.nkuown known, and the known fomiliar in those placc:s wliich it txamines. It is my opin· ion, ho\Ve\·cr, that the l>enefit cannot Le fully reap<'d in this instance, unh·ss a light· house, of the first .class in i,ize and in apparatus, be erected on rnme part of the south coast of the island of Nantucket, and here I give the preference too the southeast bluff, known as Sankaty head. . The most important channel, by whiC'h to pass from the north· ward of the old South shoal iuto the deep water, along the t·astward of Nantutkt!t, is bounded by the t>a!'tern extr<'m'ity of the shoal called the" Old l\Ian" on one !'i1li·, an1l by the southwt stern point of the "na~s Rip" on the ether side. .A line north by wt·st and south by east", (magnetic,) from Sard.:aty heiul, lits over the deep water of the channel, ~n which the tith·s run at times with great '·iolence. The bearing of Sankaty head is therefore the true (;mil Twill add the only) guide, and the land h1, at a proper distance to ma!ce a di\"ergence from that bearin~, caused bv tht: currents, sulfciently sensible by the compass. This channel ~an now be resorted tv when

Sanknty head is visible, that is, in the day time; a light on that point woulcl make it practicable at night. It is probable that coasting vessels bound from New England ports to those farther south, will profit by the coa~t sur\'ey chart to make more frequent use of the excellent channel around Siasconsett, :t111l by the south side of the island bctweep the· shore anrl the "0111 Man," which cuts off a considerable distance: kt!eps a vessel n shorter time in the ,·iolent e1hlies and tide rips of the shoals, and offers the great con\'cnience of a smooth sea under a weather shore in the stormy season, of a ·mug a11chorage under Nantucket or Squipnocket, ancl of a chance to enter the sound either by the Muskeget channel, tto be hereafter sun·eye.1 1) or by the way of Gay head,. whili;t the route to the southward of the shoals carries a vessel Jj .. rei.:tly to sea, an1! exposes her to the delay causeu by getting into the influence of the Gulf stream. To the use of this channel in coming from the north there is opposer! the hazard of piissiug a shoal of limited extent, but badly situated, off the town of Siasconsett, called "Pochie Rip.,, A Jight on Sankaty head would remove this hazard. In coming from the westward, the only tlitliculty consists in doubling the western extremity of the "Old Man." The bearing of the same light will show when it is prudent to steer an east course. The pre~eding considerations regard the local utility of this light chiefly; that is, its utility for those channels near the island. They might be extend(ld; but, as the further enumeration of such details would be neither interesting nor necessary, I will pass to the notice of some of the general purposes of navigation, which the erection of the Sankaty light would sen·e, an<l which requires, as a condition of its usefulness, that it be a light of a superior order. Sea going vessels coming north from the Atlantic, and bound into N;.ntucket sound or Rrston bay, ancl farther north, depend solely upon their det<>rminatiJn of the .longitude (so far as the reckoning is concerned) for striking fairly into either of the great channels. which form the highways of this commerce. The approach to those channels (which are themselves interrupted by shoals as dan .. gerous as any single sqoal on our cQast) is restricted on the west side by the south shoals and ridges of Nantucket. The range, after the channels are entered, and when passing out of the1n, is Jiinited, first, by the ten fathoms bank, 60 miles to the eastward of Nantucket, discovered by the coast survey brig Wash .. ington, in 1840, anti afterwar1ls by Clark'$ bank, verified by the same ,·essel, and b)' George's bank, both of which are regarded as unnpproachable in bad weather. But the determination of the lon~itude, on which tbe safe navi. gation depends here, is, under fuorablc circumstances, subject to considerable error; and it i11, under ordinary circurustances, azi anxious and insecure reliance. The proposed light-house on Sankaty head will supply the cer· tainty that is needed. It woulJ be seen a sufficient distance to point the way into the channel to the eastward of "BilSS Rip." ·

[1]

86

A Tessel doubtful of her po1.1ition would ruri for it, a1vl, being guidetl by its bearing, 1''.0uld keep it in sight until another light was discovered, or a· safe departure taken for a distant port; an<l thus the Sanknty light, seen in enry direction from northt'ast to soutbwest,·30 or 40, or even uO miles in ndvanc·e of any other port .on that part (the most dangerous, and, in r;omc rt spects, l1itherto the least known) of our coast, would, with the help of the hydro· graphical details contained in the coast surny charts, pre,·ent many of those alarming accidents continually occurring, one of which (that of the packet. ship Louis Philippe) is recorded in the public prints at the moment of my writing this report. I must mention a single fact in confirmation of the prece<linir re· !Darks, and that is, that it is no uncommon thing for the West India traders to run for tlie ol1l South shoal on their return home, in order to take a fresh departure for the north. This shows the great want of a light on Nantucket. But the recent discovery of the new South shoal, and the neighboring ridges, by the coast survey, also shows that this practice of the West India traders has been attended with imminent peril. Many of those that have never been heard from have, no doubt, met their fate on these unknown shoals. . Ilut this light is also to provide an additional security to the great fleet of European ·tradeu and packet ships, whose course, both going and returning, carries them near these outer sl1oals. Such a light as I propose will be visible in clear nights beyond the new south shoal. · Vessels in this line of commerce are obliged to sail as near the shollls as possible to save distance. The consequence is, that thl'y are Hable to be in,·olved among th~m by the un.foreseen effects of currents, and by slight aud unavoidable errors in reckoning. The cases are, to my own knowledge, nume.rous; but it i11 only where there is actual loss, or such alarm that a demantl is made for a Nantucket pilot, that they attract public attention. The depths are so variable on this ground, that no degree of minuteness in the chart would rtnder the lead alone a sufficient monitor. Fixed objects are required; one of these-and it will prove n useful one, though not always decided-is the charact1n of the bottom; the other is the Sankaty light. The last bcntlit to be conferred by this light; to which I will call your attention, is th·e great con\·enience it will afford to navigators ou~ward-bound, by supplying them with a very late depart· ure, and a mtans of correcting their reckoning after an interval of one or two days from port. I should not insist on this as a matter of great mor.ut'nt, if it were not that tlit! interval will· be spent among strong currents antl tide·rip~, such as disturb the most accurate calcl!lations. The new departure will be taken not. long- before escaping frorn tht:ir in11uences altogt!tl1er, and will, I think, proYC an incidt!ntnl advantage entitled to sotne weight. Finally, I will obsern, th&t though tl1e e!'lpecial uses of a lighthouse constitute the only, satisfactory urg1.11nent for an appropria-

87

[ I ]

tion, yet there are always occasional and incidental uses, not easily takC'n into account, that appear after it is erectet'. This is well known anil d1~eply felt by the anxiou!I mariner. It could not be ma1le intelligible to others. Dut one hour of apprehension in this region of ''iolent currents, of noisy shoals, of fickle and boisterous weather, and of swelling seas, with the knowledge that !'iomething in sight upon the land that is not far distant but too low for \'ision, would convert that apprehensioR into se~urity, would be an argument which none who.' experienced it would be disposed to contest in favor of the propo· . sed light-house. Very respectfully, your oberJient sernnt,

Washington, December 21, 18.Z.7. Sm: I h·n·e recci\'ed your circular of the 16th instut, in rela- ·' tion to buoys, beacons, or other marks or lights required on that·· portion of the coast embraced in the last season's work of the party undE'r my· command 1 and I have to report·· l. That I send you herewith a separate statement, showing the i1Dportance of erecting a Fresnel light, of the first class, upon San. katy head, Nantucket, near the point of triangulation of the coast'
Sllr\'ey. .

. 2. No buoys are rccommencled in this \'icinity, on account of the extreme ''iolence of the titles, and the exposure to the ocean storms and sea. They would be very useful on se,·eral points of dangerous shoals, if they could be kept in their places; but, for the reasons mentioned above, this is doubtful, and at any rate would be attended with considerable expt?nse. The money would be more judiciously appropriated to the light on Sankaty head ·. 3. But I must irupro,·e this and every other opportunity to repre· sent the very great benefit to life and property which would result frorn placing a screw-pile bc~con upon the outer o~ new South shoal,. and, must commend this subject, as on.e of high value, to your consideration and to the investigation of engine·ers. · · ' ',

Concerning Doston llarbor, I \mve to rtport· 1. That I send you a letter hert:with, in which I reconunenll that a more permanent (though not expensive) mark bi: put up on Long Island in the place .of a tempora!y :;caffol1l now standin~ there and. :serving as part of n range, leat!rng safo through one of the most difficult reaches of the main ship channel. I am inclined to believe that this subject would receive the at· tention o!' the chamber of commerce at Boston, if presented to them. I mentione1l it, before leaving the' city, to their late presi· · dent, l\Ir. ll. B. Forbt.·s. But if you think it hail helter he submitte1l to the bureau to which such matters officially pertain, it will be sa(e to say that 2uch a beacon as will answt·r the purpose and will stanil for fifty years, with occas.ional rq1airs of paint, &.c., can be constructed for about $600. 2. Buoy!I, in addition to those already <lown, are recnmmen<led for the following places in Boston harbor, (2:) On two rocks in Nantasket roa11s, one of which is the extremity of the le1lge pro· jecting from the southern and eastern point of Hainsfonl island. This rock is only exposrd in the lowest course. of titles, an1l a channel way leads around it. The other of thctze rocks is near the Rai·nsford island shoal, and the more dangerous on this very account. The buoy on the shoal marl~s a wrong limit of danger, and. is the cause why tl1is rock is sometimes struck. 3. There is a rock similarly situated with regard to the Lower .Middle, in the channel, on which vessels occas:onally strike, which should be buoyed. 4. A buoy is needed on the ledge at the entrance of the Black· rock channel. There is a passage on each side. Vessels are con· atantly carried on this ledge by tide. A buoy on it would give sufficient warning to prevent this, either by dropping anchor, or by choosing one or the other ·of the passages. 5. A buoy should be placed on a rock to the southward and en11t· ward of George's island, at \he entrance to Nantasket roa1ls. Tbe situation of this rock is in tbe fair channel way. It has between eleven and thirteen feet of water on it at low water. A little rise of tide, therefore, covers it sufficiently for the safe passage of nssels of ordinary draught; but as nn this account it attracts but little attention, it is the rnore dangerous for ''essels of large
drau~h~.

3. These buoys are all that I hn·e to recommend at present in !oston liarbor, but I shall call your particular attention hereafter to the utility of some additional buoys or other marks in Broail Sound channel necessary to reudrr this very important passage available at all times. It will he bei;.t to tlt:fcr this part of my report until the hydrographic sheet is complete11. Concerning. Hyannis harbor, I ha\'e to report that two buoys are wanted there-orie on a small ledge near Collins's 1e1lg1:; the other on a rock a short distance i;outh by cast from Point Gammon. Neither of these rocks am generally kn0wn, 01111 both require to lie named as well as marked. There is a passage for coasters

Extracts from areport to Lieutenant Commm1ding Charles H. »avis, U. S. N., nssistant'U. S. toast survey, by Daniel .llmmen, acting· 11111ster of tlic surueyi11g steamer Bibb, forwarded to the supcri11· · tcndcnt of tile coast survey.
RocKrOaT, M'Ass., .!lugust 18, 184.8. The following information is mostly from the fishermen with whom I hnvc conversed·. The character of the bottom on "Cashe's IP.oge," is from actual obsencJ soundings by me. \Ve ·were not able to assign the bottom.very well to any particular part of the ledge, but found sanrl, white and black gravel, and dark pebbles, generally in depths of 50 to 60 fathoms; mutl, in d1:eper water, an<l. rocks, either rugged or smooth, generally in shoaler water. The :;hoalest i;oundiug taken by us was 27 fathomi-:, rough rocks. "Cashe's ledge" is said to extend about ten leagues, nearly north and south, by compass; the ends for five or six miles are repre· i;ente1l as deep and broken ground. Throughout its whole length its soundings are irregular, and the bottom varies, being in the "gullies" or "sloughs," between the ledges, blackish mud, and at other places sand, black and white gravel, dark pebbles, nd rough ancl smooth rocks. The shoalest water on the northern part is 23 fathoms, very un· e,·en rocks, with 60 fathoms close around it. The soundings between this an1l the middle ground are froa-t 70 to 40 fathoms, for about six miles, where there is said to be 18, and a \"ery small spot of eleven fathoms, \'ery rocky. The soundings to about three miles southerly cf this vary from 40 to 50 fathoms, with the same· variety of bottom to the vicinity of the main shoal, which is be· lieved to be about in the middle of the le1l~t>, north and south, and on its eastern edge. This main shoal is nine miles from the first shoal ground mentioned; and three· from the one of 11 fathoms. The main shoal is small; approaching it frorn WNW. nine fa· thorns is found at half a mile; then 12 or 13, and then decreasing to four fathoms. It is said that, to the north, there are·17 fathoms within one hundretl foet of the main shoal; tbnt towards the east, fro1n the shoal, the soundings incr,!aSe gradually, and at about .a mile are forty fa· tboms; that two miles to the southeast there ts 90 fathoms; that towards the south they <lee1>en graJually, with 40 fathoms at a dis-

L1]

90

tance of about three milts, anti that at about two miles to· the southwest there are soundings .of 70 o;r 75 fathoms, black mµ1I ·. Th~ shoal part, under ten fathonu1, 1s thought to hne an area of near an acre, which is covered with hip. 'l'he soundings on top of the shoal are reported to be irreg.ular, ''aryirrg from eight to four fathoms; ancl a reliable persl.'ln saul he had put a boat-hook on a rock in 19~ feet water. All this part is believed to be rocky. To the southward of. the main sho'al the soundings are as variable as to the north, with the same character of bottom. The ledge extends about 15 miles to the !louthward of the main shoal, having one spot on it of less than 30' fathoms. lt is said to end in hartl broken ground, nrying from 70 to 90 fathoms. The a\'erage width of the led?c is represt·ntcd to je about two miles. There being deep "sloughs' or" gullies" cutting it, having about the same depths and character of the bottom as around the letlge, urnkes it difficult, an1l sometimes impossible, to tell whether a \'essel is over a "slough" or east or west of the ledge. When nearly calm, and drifting with the tide, hauling up a lcacl·linl" with us and heaving it at once, changeJ the soundings from 27 to 34 fathoms. Jeffrey's ledge my informants did not appear to be very well ac:quainted with. They sairl it had a commen depth of 30 fathoms, generally sand and sheJly bottom, with a lump of rocks of s:nall extent on the southern part, ha,·ing 16 fathoms water on it. Tippany's ban/c.-The middle ot this bank lies in a line between Cape Ann and the shoalest part of "Cashe's," or about east by compass. It is about 15 miles inside of "Cashe's," trends north'v,est an1l southeast by compass, and is about 5 or 6 miles in length and about 4 miles broad. 'fhe southern part is clay an1I rc.cks, an1l tolerably regular, at 40 fathoms, but. having two shoal Npots of rock, one having 15 and the other 18 fathoms on it. The more northern part is less regular, and has soundings of gravel, sand and shells. This shoal lits in witter not varying mu.ch from 100 fathoms.

S1R: There is a scaffold, a temporary and insecure structure-, standing on Long island, Boston harbor, which makes I\ range with the 11orthe:.st part of Spectacle island, such, thitt a vessel observing it strictly in sailing from President roads to abreast of Bird island buoy, is carried safely by the low·cr middle, Castle island

rocks, Gorern'or's island point, the upper middle, and in the best water O\'cr tht· shoal ground 11b0Yc the uppl'r n1iddle; anrl this reach is regarded as oue of the 1lifficult parts of the main ship channel. The scatTold was erected by the pilots in the place of a barn which had answered the same purpose before being burned, and this prons the Yalue of the range. 'l'he objt'ct of this ietter is to represent the importance of put· ting up in the place of the scaffold, liable at any moment to be O\'erthrown, a suitable mark of wood, painted black, that will be secure against the violence of storms. This can be done at a i;mall expense. I han no <loubt that in order to pre~erve this nluable range, 1.ome kind of beacon will always be kl'pt there; but you will r,erceive the adnntage of haYing one that is permanent, and easily described in the sailing directions, tstablished before the cha.rt of Boston harbor, now far / adYnnccd, is published. This is a matter worthy of some serious C'Onsideration by the }l~ople of Boston. The grounding of the British packet steamers, which has occurred twice, has brought a reproach on th.e harbor, that is readily taken up and repeated by the friends of a rival city. · · · · I am informed by my excellent and intelligent pilot, that on neither occasion would this accident have occurred if the barn, on which the range formerly depended, had been standing.

\V AsmNGToN, December 21, 1847. Srn: I desire to recommend to the notice and use of thf government, through you, an in\'ention of the.honorable Captain Owen, designed to be employed on board of light-boats and at light-house stations, in the night and during fogs, to gh·e warning to approach· ing Hssels.

at the breach. The discl1arge of the musket produces the sound of a cannon. On the northeastern parts of our coast, where, at certain sen· sons, fogs are frequent, Jense, and of long continuance, this in· vention promises to be of great utHity; much more effectual than the ringing of bells, the motle of warning practised in foggy wea· ther, on board of light-boats. If it were cmployetl on certai11 light-house stations, it would prc,·cnt great losses of life !}nd property every ~·enr. At J3oston, the want of n similar m1~ans of direction bus been so often pron:i<l by tl1e terrihle loss of valuable vessels within a few hunt!red yartls of their destined port, that the inconvenience and expense of firing a cannon has been sometimes incurretl uy the underwriters. By the in\'ention of Captain 'Owen, thll nnii-ic of the cannon is pro1lucc1l with a Mnnll waste of powder, anti the little trouble of loading a piece of small arms; wl1ilst the facility of the method better insures the attention of the station keeper to his duty. The trumpet c.ould also be employed with convenience and atlvan· tage at i:ea. Very respectfully, yours,

timated that one in fifty 11ustains more or less injury. by being forced by the ''iolence "of the currents on the rocks or shoals; and the accident to the Oregon, which nearly proved fatal to her pas· sengers, shows that e\'cn steamboats, with a motive power that keeps them under perfect control, nn<l guided by most experiencc1l pilots, are not secure from peril. · Such an impro\'ement in the channels of Hell Gate as would re111lcr them na\'ignble to \'<'Sscls of all classes untler common circumstances woultl supply to the commerce of New York a new outlet to tlic sea; one in a 11ifferent 1lirection from the harbor channels, and arnilnble when those were tt>mpornrily closed hy adverse wind~, or other causes; and would, therefon~, he a permanent and \'alua· ble resourci: both for vessels outward bound and for those return· ing home. But a still more serious consideration is that of the increased fo. cilities for· naYal defence, which this improvement would afford. In the event of a rupture with a n.aval power, there can he no doubt that the attempt of the lal!t war to rau~e the shores of Long Island will be repeated. The means of rNdsting or preventing such }1ostilities must be drawn chidly from New York; and if the Hell Gate passage be made ~ecurt', not only our largest men-of-war, but our steamboats of a superior class, which, on :;uch an occasion, :woultl be armed for the purpose of defence, would be at once enabled to hasten to the scene of danger. The stcaruboats are now constnntly passing through Hell Gate, but the ditliculties of the passnge to tl11!m would be seriously in· creased, if they were pressed down by a narnl armament anti equipped for action. During the war with Great Britain, our frigates were blockadt'1l in the harbor of New York, which could not hare been the case if thE: Hell Gate passage hat! been open. Commodore Decatur \'en· tured to carry his squadron through, but with such risk that the at· tempt with a fri~ate was only made once afterwards, notwithstancl· ing the constantly recurring necessity. The remo\·al, therefore, of the obstructions to the safe na\·igation of Hell Gate, is recom1ncniled by a n·garil to the futur~ naval cll'fencc of the country. The 1h1ngers in this channel arise from the great strength of the currents and the number a111I positions (If the rocks and reefs. The strength of the· current is such that sailing vessels can only stern its force or. ei;cape from it by a comman1ling breeze; but as themain course of thejfo,,d tide keeps the middle of the t·astcrn channel, it is most secure for \'esscls which are coming from the westwar<l with the tide, to place themselves in the mi<lille of the stream anti follow its direction. '!'hey are thus carrie1l through safely. This plan, however, is inn1lmissible for any but small vessels 011 aecount of two rock~, the Pot anti the Frying Pan: which lie in or rcrr near the micl-d111nnel, are in the way both going to the eastward and westwnril, an1l have hut little watt~r on them at low ticlt'. There is also a rt!cf called Way's reef, which lies in the course fol· lowed by the stenrnboall! printipally, wlH·n coming from the cn~t ward against a strong flood. It is their custom to keep close round

95

[1]

Pot CoYe and run up under Hallet's Point, hy wh;ch they avoid the stungth of the flood. In this part they find an e<lJy current in their fayor. But on the ehb the greatest danger al'ises from the dh·ergcnce of the current at a poiut marked A. on the sketch, where the ebb tide branches off into three rlirection~, to take the course of the three chanuels; the main south channel, the mid1lle channel and the cast· cm channel. The safe naYigation 1lt>pentls here upon 1leciding sufficiently so'ln 1 at Hie point of separation, which r:lianncl shall be taken, nnd the ueglect to 110 this, OI' a loss of control oYer the \"essel for any rea· son, fn·qucntly results in being carril'd on the Gridiron. \\"hen a \"essel thnt has 11ttcmptc1l the eastern channel finds her· self carried toward the Gridiron, her only chance for safety is to run for the middle channel, which is narrow and made precarious. by the mid11le reef, the outer rock of which is the Negro Head. The Gridiron is, owing to the strong set of the tide on it, the most 1langerous reef in the passage. The reef known as the llrl'a<l and Cheese, on the eastern end of Dlackwcll's Isl1111d, is also Yery dangerous. Vessels are liable to go on it in the flood when it is coHred, by getting into the eddy near it with a light wind. The chief da·nger is on the ebb, and frorn the same cause as that which makes the Gridiron dangerou11: i. e., the strong set of the thle in that direction. These, then, are the principal 1langers, and I recommend the fol· lowing measures be adopted for their removal and correction·: J. 'l'liat Pot rock, the Frying pa1~, and \Vay's reef be blasted. and scattered. The two former are single rocks of a pointed shape,· the latter is long and has the character of a ledge, (the rocks having deep water round them could easily be remo,·e<l,) and also that ~he middle reef be blasted so as to make a clear channel, of suffi· cient depth for common \'cssels and steamboats, between Flood and Little Mill rocks. 2. 'l'hat piers be built upon the "Hog's back," "Gridiron,'' and the "Dread and Cheese,'' of stone, suflicieutly high to show above the surface of the water at high title at least four feet. That these piers be faced with wood, and be provid1:,i with the spring fenders used at the steamboat ferries, and that their forms should corre· spond to the natural shape of the reef, by which means \'essels coming in contact with them would be guided into the channel ways. 'l'o blow up and scatter the large mass of rock. comprising the. Gridiron, without destroying the middle channel, whicl1 has only twenty-two feet of water in it nt that point, woul1l hardly be pos· f:iible. But if the Gridiron were removed, the rock out of water, that is Flood rock, wouhl be equally or n<'arly as dangerous. The tide would set on that with the same ''iolencll and certainty . . The same objection will apply to an attempt to remo\'<' the "Bread .and Cbee~e," anrl, wit11. regard to this a~il the "Hog's back,'' the shoal water aro1tnd them would make it necessary to. repeat the blasting an indefinite number of times.

(1]

Something has been said of remo,·ing am] scattering all the rocks in Hell Gate, those out of water as well as those under water. Ilut it apptiirs to me that this propos!tion is best answered by asking where the materials are to go? Unle11s carrie1l otr,.they must obstruct the neighbouring channt:!s, and the process of blasting would never be completed. By the piers which I prop'>se, th1! dirHtions of the currents would be made more certain and confined, and where they pass over deep water, they may be safely trusted. Tides would rebou111) from the piers, and, in most instances, pre\·ent \'essels from striking against them. And, again, if \'essels were carried on, they would be pre,·ented from rtceiving any injury, by the spring·fenclers, and would have an opportunity, by throwing a line around a pile, either to swing the \'tssel or to lay by, as might be most con,·enient. Tliert' are several single rocks less important, and near the shore, which might be easily remon:d-one, for instance, off Negro Point, ·and one near the South ferry. Until this passage is improvetl by the remonl of the present serious impediments to its safe uavigntion, I recommend that the following buoys be placed: One 011 "Way's rtef." I have a!reacly mentioned that steamboats coming from the. eastward on tl1e flood, pass inllide of Way's reef, where ~n eddy tide is foun1l setting towards IIallet's Point. This edtly, produce<l by the whirl'! of the "pot," returns from the shore, arHl sets on to " Way's rct:f," wliue it is met by one of the direct whirls of the "pot." Dy tbi11 co11flict of tides, two straight currents are pro<luced, that run sitle by si1le onr the reef, the outer ·one soutlierly, or flood; the inner one northerly, or counter to the <lirt·ction of the ruflin body of the tide. · One on " Hog's back." V tssels intending to take the main ship channel on the ebb, (which is the best way,) arc in 1langcr, if they gin~ "Hog's b.ack" too wide a berth, of going on Mill retf, or of being forct·d to run the middle cliauucl, which 1s only safe to those who are \'ery well acqua1nt1·1l with the gro11nd. A buoy will enable a vessd to keep near" Hog's back," and avoid this danger. One on" llylandt·r'~ reef." 'l'his rt·ef is dangerously iiitunted, on account ot' the deep water around it, arul is not well known. I will also recorutnenil 11 i:mall light on. Great Mill rock, which would enable nssPls to pass through Hell Gate at night. It would be the proper guide for hauling round Nt·gro Point, c.orning from the tastwartl, and for hauling to the south\\!artl, corning frorn the westwar<I, after pa!'sing IIallet'i-: point. " · * The character of the rocks in Hell Gate is such that they could easily be re1no\'C1l by li!a,tit1g ·.

U. S.
ScuooNER Pr.TR EL,

JV'ew York, October 30, 18!8.
Sm: · · · "" "" "" The chamber of commerce meets in a short time in this city for the purpos~ of taking m< nsurcs relative to clearing away the obstructions of Hell Gate; anil, at the request of the gentlemen who seem interested in the tnattcr, I lay before you the informntion I ba\'e collected while soun1ling out the place. . 1t was my intcl)tion _to ha·;e ma1lc you a full report on the subject, but a copy of the report of Lieutenant Charles H. Da\·is, of the United States nRVy, assistant iu the coast survey, on Hell Gate, WAS sent to UH', anJ I find it so full and correct in all its details tliat I could say but little more, without incurring the charge of plagiarism; in fact the OJ>inions expressed by Lii:utenant Davis co~ iacide with those I had fo!'mecl previous to reading his report, and it only remains for me to point out the dangers I ha\·e noticed while surveying here, and which have escapcJ his attention. I · have als() had a bett1ir opportunity of"mcasuring the siZl' an·l shape of tht! rocks than he had, and herewith gh·e a description of them. The first in order, and the principal obstruction to Jhll Gate, is Pot rock, on which I found eight feet of water at the lowest tides; the 11\'eragu depth is, however, about ten feet; the lowest rlepth is only to be found in one place about six feet by six. It del'pcns to fourteen feet 011 the cast and west sides, and suddenly to four fa1homs on the north anti south. The strata. of this rock are vertical, runni11g north nntl south-which is the case with every rock in the Gate-and this would render the task of blowing them up much easier than if horizontal. At half titles the depth of water docs not increase on Pot rock 1 as there is a fall of four feet;. an1l a vessel 1lrawing over eight feet must strike upon it. A full rigged brig struck it three days since, and went down, with a. valu· ablt! cargo on board. This obstruction once remo'ved, Hell Gate .would be less llangerous by one-half, and the eddies, which are now the cause pf half the difficulties, would in a measure disap. pear. Way's reef, to the southward of Pot 'rock, is divide1l into two parts, one a conicul rock with five feet of water on it, and the other a flat bed of rocks, about tt'n feet by ten, with fourteen feet of water on it, and twenty yards to the north of the former. The fire-feet rock lies on the edge of the eddy, ancl I found by experi· ment that a buoy le~ go in .wid channel, at the depth of eight feet and abon the north entrance, drifted clirectly over Way's reef· this was with a light breeze from the northwest. I kept a .buoy o~ this place while sounding; it watched generally and almost alway1
"I.

with the flood tide. Since I removed it, one vessel has struck on the reef. I would recomrut'ncl that n buoy, ma'de in.the shnpe o( a boat be placed upon it until .it br. remov1.:d. There is & dangerous rock, c11lled ".llnld-he1uled llilly,'' fifteen yartls from Hattt'r's dock, which is dry at low water, and "brings up" a riumbc>r of vessels at high water. Three veJsels struck upon this rock while I was at Hell Gate; one we got off with some diffi· culty, another Jost bowsprit, anchors anti chains. It is a single rock, about six feet by six, and could be blown into. deep water without much rlifficulty. . Opposite Gibbs' Point, nnd within fifty yarcls of Blackwell's island, is a large rock which I have called u Blackwell's rock;" t.hc current sets directly upon it with the tloocl tide, and it is a most dangerous obstruction. It is Rix feet out of water at low tide, and could be remo\'ed at 'small expense. 1'he "Frying Pan rock" is a Jcclgc fifteen feet·long and only six inches wide at the top. It runs north ancl south, an<l is a part of a chain of rocks ,.,.hich runs from ''Hog's Back" to Hallct's Point. A buo~, let go in mid-channel at half ehb, drifted directly onr the "~ rying Pan," with a 'light northwest wind. It is at this point where the currtnts dividl.', taking the directions of the main and mid1lle channels. This rock remo\·ed, vessels would always drift through the main ship channel. The dinirulty of removing it woul1l IJe much greater thf'.n any other rock in the Gate, as it is so difficult to hit upon. · There is a small rock, though a very dangerous one, to the south· ward of Woli>ey's bath-house.· It extends about £fty yarcls into the channel, and is connected with the shore line at low water. There is three f cet of water on it at hi$h tides. On the first of the tloocl, a buoy let go opposite Gihbs' pornt, (the southHn approach to Hell Gate,) drifted around Hallett's point, between Pot rock and Way's reef, alonJ? the edge of the ecldies, a111I on the above n1cnti .. netl rock into Pot cove. This happens to a great many vessels, nncl uut for this dangerous obstruction they would drift iuto a safe harbor. This rock could be rrmo\'ed in one or two tides. I find that "Hyla11dcr's retf" extends much further into the channel than is shown by former charts. I founcl six feet of water on the outer point of it. Nothing can be done with this large hcd of rocks, sa\·e to erect a stone beacon on the slio~lest purl; this will saYe many a Yessel. Hallet's pornt, I shoulcl r·ccommencl, by all rueans, to be re· mo\'e'I; it is the most ac:rc11)!iblP. obstruction in the gate, an cl coulcl be workecl at for four or five hours each clay. At llooJ tide, it causes the <·1l1li1·11 in Pot cov<'; nncl, on the ebb tide, the c1ldies in east channel. Vei;scl!'l standing too close to this point in ebb ti1lt·, are apt to bf' caught in tlu·se ed1lies, and thrown on shore oppo·. positc Stcnns' fort; anl! n-Rsels pns!!ing at high watt·r, when tlic point is entirely hie!, are apt tF> strike upon it. It exten1ls forty yarils into the channel, anti bas eighteen feet of water at its utter· most point.

99

[1]

If any attempt is made to carry out the recommendations that hnYe Leen frequently otfercJ, relative to clearing .away obstructions in Hell Gate, I woul1! suggest n close examination of the i;hore line at low water. Many rocks will be found to exist of a

dangerous character, and they have, at different limes, done much damage to vessels of .lighter draft. One point I would recommend for remoyal is Scaly rock, and close to it is Shell rock; both dangerous at high water, from the fact that they extend far out into the channel. Two vessels have gone on shore while I have been at work here, on a point called Ravensworth reef, to the southward of Gibbs' point; both Yessels bilged, and were nearly ruined. I would recommend a buoy to be placed upon it, as it would ha diflicult to be remoYe<l. 'l'he suggestions made by Lieutenant Davis, about builtting (locks above some of the reefs, I appro\·e of in their fullest extent. I do not think, however, it' will be found easy to make a channel by blasting through the middle reef, and would suggest that it be entirnly fillc1\ in with docks nnd spring fenders. "Dread nnd Cheese," as it now stands, is one of the most trouble· some points to avoid in Hell Gate. Heretofore lt has bnd nothing on it to indicate thll danger at high water; nt low water, it shows . its entire shape and size. I plRced a large pole on the outer point. It is so firmly fixc1l, that it will remain until cut away by tho ice. I huvc been assurccl that the pole has, no doubt, pre· ventccl m11ny vessels from running on the point; and I would re· commend, strongly, thnt an iron spindle be placed firmly upon the same spot, until measures are taken to dock it in; moreover, I think it advisable to close up a smn\l eight feet channel be· twet'n Dread 1111d Cheese a.nd Ulackwcll's poiut, as it is this which causes the most dangerous eddies. After this is don·e, a beacon, to be lighted up at night, should be placed upon the outer point, , an1l would, in 'connc·xion with a light on Mill rock, be of great advantage t.o commerce. At present, there is not a single light between New York and Throg's Point, when there should be at . leiist six. In a place where the interests of so many are at stake, the want of attention to the navigation of Hell Gate appears like culpable n<'glect. No one can form an idea of the number of vessels that go on shore' ,during the course of a month. Fifty went on shore during the period I was occupied there, (two months,)'and innny of them were much injured,. I am conYinced that if proper measures were taken to protect the commercial interests or this great city, by blasting the rocks mentioned abo,·e, and <locking in, as proposed by Lieutenant DaYis, not one vess~l would he lost .. · · in five years. I believe I have mentioned all the prorornent dangerE; the minor ones will be apparent to those who make any exl\mination of Hell Gilte previous to uadertaking the work ·· I have purposely

omitted those points touched upon by Lieutenant Da,·is, ·as he bas said all that is required. I remain, very respectfully, your obeclit>nt servant, DAVID D. PORTER, Lieutenant commanding A. D. BACHE, Esq., Supt. of coast survc'}J, WasMngton city.

UNITED STAT:r.s Sc1100NER PETREY.,

.!Jstoria, Long Island, N. Y., September 23, 1848. Sm: In obecliE-nce to your instrurtions, I took command of the United States schooner "Pctrt>l" on the 24th of August, and on the 28th commenced a re-examination of lluttermilk channel, in the harbor of New York, to ascertain whether any changes had taken place in that imporlant channel. It had been represented to. the honorable the Secretary of the Treasury that it was not practicable to use Buttermilk chnnnel, owing to its being so narrow; and as the government was dt'.sirous to. make use of the Atlantic dock as a depot for the sea steamers now under contract with the Ni"Y Deparlmcnt, it was a matter Clf some irnporta11cc that the ''alue of the channel should be established without 1loubt. I was delayed in the execution of this work, owing- to the difficulty of finding proper stations, and did not get to work sounding until the 1st of Septt'lnber. 'l'he result of the surwy has been most satisfactory, and has establishe1I, without fear of fulure cavil, the prac· ticability of the channc·I, and I St!e no difficulty whatever in the de· partment being able to carry out their plans. 1 enclosed yon a sketch of the work with the lines ruri; but owing to press of time, I was not able to prc·parE' a complete chart for JOUr iuspection. I took over one thousancl five hundred soundings during the l'Xamination, and established the positions by one hundred and thirty· five angles. I 110 not think we missl'il any· shoal water during the operation. The importan<:e of this entrance seems to be so great, 1liat i't is a matter of astonishment to me tlrnt the pilots of New York have not. heretofore taken advanta!.!e of it. It is the deepest, most direct, ancl the clearest channel into the East river, and when buoyed out properly, will no doubt be generally used.' On the 22d of this month, I was requested by the honorable the Srcretary of the Treasury to aceompany him on board the re\'enue i;teamer Jefferson, to meet the pilots of New York and the owners of the sea stPamers, to pro,·e to them that the Buttermilk channel had sufficient water in it for the largest size nssel, and could be made available for the purposes I have mentioned above as an en-

trance into Atlantic dock for the sea steamers. The "Jefferson" was started from the points I selected, and run out to\vards the the Robin's Reef beacon untlcr the charge of Mr. McGinn, one of the most intelligent of the New York pilots, and we carried out on the line (marked down on the sketch I sent you as the sailing line) lh-e, six, :iievcn and eight fathoms; this was satisfactory to the ship pwners, as ucmonstrating the necessary depth of water for their largest sized steamers. I then proposed to run through the channel close to the north dock of uovernor's Island, and Mr · . McGinn cnrricd the vessel through in fh-c fathoms (.the least) water, turned the steamP.r up the East ri\'er, and ran down alon~ the docks insiue of the mitl<lle ground, carrying- six fathoms all the way. After a short excursion tlown the bay; we returned to New York, an<l it was proposed to run the steamer through the cntranc~ of Atlantic dock; nnd as the "Jelf1:rson" is one of the most difficult steamers to turn, except with plenty of room, this seemed a matter of some difficult·y. Mr. McGinn, howe,·er, took her in handsomely, (notwithstanding he hatl never been inside the dock,) with a i;tiff northwest wind blowing, an unfavorable tide, and with the disadvantage of having a slooi> lying in the middle of the passage, with her decks loa<led with. plank and projectiag out on each side of her. 'l'hough with SC<Hcely room to pass, we w«:nt through and anchored iusid\i the dock, everybody, I believe, favor· ably impressed with the result of the trip. There are many reasons why it is desirable Buttermilk channel · shouhl be well known. 'l'he most important are thdse connected with the interest of the government; antl I recommend, to avoid all difficulty, that it shoul\l be buoyed out in so perfect a manner that vessels of all classes can know exactly how far they can go. I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DEAR Sm: I ban examined the inlet, &a., at Sand Shoal island, in compliance with the follo,ving extract from your g1meral instruc· tions 1 (dated April 28 1 1848,) for the operations of the present season: . · , "If the weather should perm.it, as you come round from New York to the Chesapeake, I wish you to .ixamine Sand Island inlet, and report upon the exp~diency pf the two 1mall lights asketl for· 'in the petition of wbich I wend herewith a copy, the value ot the

inlet as a harbor of rt·fuge, the depth on its bar, the ·direction. o{ its channel, the possibility of entering with the lights asked for, the distance from Cape Charles, (Smith's Islan1I light,) and the interference or not of these local lights with that important light, the probable height of structure and kind of light required, with any other in.formation you may obtain. As this infor'mation is rcquire1I at once, I wii;h you wou.!11 send the report from the nearl!st convetii(.'nt post office. Should it be impracticable to obtain this information at this time, do so when passing from the Chesapeake to the outtiide." It was not practicable to obtain this information when the Washington came from New York, without the prospect of occasioning considerable delay; and you had told me before I left for New York that the examination might, in that event, be deferred until the brig's return from the Chesapeake for outside work. Our bay pilot had never seen the place, and he thought the wind too fresh from the eastwaril, as we passed the coast to the northwarJ of Cape Charles, to justify the examination then. The information obtained at Norfolk, and the use of this steamer, have enabled me to execute your instructions when "passing from the Chesapeake to the outside," and in good time, I hope, for the object in view. Mr. Nathan Ji'. Cobb resides with his family on Sand Shoal island. They are the only inhabitants. Mr. Cobb's nearest neighbor (Dr. Nottingham, I believe) rcsi1les on the main about ten milts off, across the marshes. We crossed the northward bar on Friday the 28th ulti{llo, (Mr. Cobb piloting, it was first of flood, he said,) drawing seven feel fi\'e incheii; thumped and clragge1l heavily over the bar, (which is of hard sand,) forcing our way by press of steno1. This is the northern channel. '!'here arc two spar buoys (about to IH~ replnct>«I by two can buoys) on it, placed by order of the· collcctn of Norfolk, and undt·r charge of Mr. Cobb. These buoys are about two hundred yards apart. \Vhen we (·roi;sed the bar the wind was moderate from the 11outhwar1l, with some swell on. 'l'hc boiler rcq11iri11g a patch, which woul1l detain us a day, I ma<le ~ome preparations for a hasty survey of the bar and inlet tl1c next da~·, (at low watt·r, the most favorable time,) but it was too rou~h on the bar to allow the boats to work at low water; and at high water the stcame1· was ready to go out, but it was i;till too rough on the bar. 'l'he same cau~e 1ll'tai11c1l her the next 1lay, (Monday;) as it was then about the time of spring tides, (the moon changed on the morning of the 30th,) with the wind at the eastward on the 29th and 30th, there was probably more water then on thnt coast than nt usual tilles. The rise 111111 fall of tides here, l\Ir. Cobb 11ays, i11, as a general thing, 1tbout v~ feet. We came out, pilotetl by !\Ir. Cobb, Monday morning, at high spring title, without touching, nnd found nearly twelve feet water on the bar. The wind was then light from the southwartl and eastward. .Mr. Cobb (who also .looks out for the buoys at Great .Matchapungo or Hog Island inlet, some five or six miles to northward) says that the µ-ale of March 211, two years since, nltcretl and shoaled the entrance there very ruuch. Tile sumc gale, he says,

a1tere1l th11 shonls ca1JP.1l Carter's shonls, \vhich are off Sand Shoal island, and d1a11get.I the pnssagcs a little. He furthl'r informed me that the shoals, bars, &c., at Mntchapungo, are the same kind of l1ard sanrl as forms the bars and shoals here. Carter's shoals,. off Sa~il Shoal island, stretch along the coast in a north and south direction, an<I extc-nd out about five miles from the land. The i:oundings appl·ar pretty regular until quite up with the shoals. From the anchorage at low water (Saturday) the sea appeared te> break from shore to 11liore onr both northern a11il southern pa~ sages. The gale of March, 18·.16, swept through Mr. Cobb's dwell· ing·house, and carried away so1ne of hb levees. He had reclaimed a pa:-t of the island arounti his house, and now has a small por· tion, where the levees are up, under pretty cultivation. .Mr. Cobb's dwelling-house, and the store· house near it, both of which are white hour.es~ are conspicuous land marks. It is by these that the place is known and the bars passed to go into the inlet. Vessels from thu nor\hward bring these houses to bear west southwest, which clears the shoals auJ leads up to the buoys on the bar. Vessels from the southward bring these houses to bear about northwest. This is the next best passage, but it is not buoyed. Our boat carried nine feet in this way at about high tide, (Fritlay morning,) and found about four feet coming out at low watGr. Mr. Cobb came in this boat anti took us in by the other pnssage. We an· chored in the inlet in twelve feet \rntcr, hard bottom. The tide ran very strong, from three to four knots per hour, (Mr. Cobb says. five knots at times,) and there is but little slack \vater. Soun1ling here will be a tedious an1l troublesome operation. There are anchorag('s connected with the main inlet which inay answer for small craft in heavy weather. I beg lt!ave to conclude with the folJowing replies to the several pointR upon which you desire me to report. 1. IJuilding 11nd keeping two lights to m11ke a range, by which to run at night,· had better only be done where there is room enough on shore lo put the lights so far apart as would make the range a sensitive one; where there is a solid and sr.fc foundation, cin<l where the channel is not chnngeRble. With these conside· rations in Yiew, I cannot rccommcnu two lights on Sand island. 2. None but centre-board vessels, or vessels of very light drnft, . should attempt to make a refuge in Snnd inlet, in blowing weather on shore (from seaward.) In very good weather, coasting YesselR would prefer to go on. llut there are \'essels which would like to come in to trade, or to anchor for the night, or to wait for a fair wind, or to avoid the threatening weather. Small coasters, of light draft, might fin1l this a useful resort. 3. We dragged <·ver the bar, <Im wing 71 feet on the first of flood; we found nearly 12 feet at high water spring tide. 4. The northern channel, which \s buoyed, runs WSW. and E. NE., nnd the other channel, which is not buoyed, makes NW. aJid SE. . With two lights a stranger could not paRS the bar and get to a . f.: an chorage without a pilot. By the day the b~oys, and the

[ 1]

104

breakers with t·.e 'vind easlwar1l, would help to show the way if there was no pilot; but a pilot would be necessary to one not well acquaintetl. The inlet is perhaps a1.H1Ut ten miles north or Smith's island. Our pilot, whose profe~sional opinions arc worthy of' consideration, tl11nks that a light there woulil conflict with that on Smith's island, anti woulc.l occasion more wrecks than it would prevent. I propose for this inlet a lantern on the keeper's dwelling-tte hou~e to be on piles. This should be.,'l fixed light, l\1111 as that on Smith's island is a revolving, they would be too different to be taken one for the othH. Light-houses along the coast are gooil guides to coasters. Many of' these, I am told, go by the land altogether. To sud1 the light-houses by tiny anrl tl1e lights by night, must be \·ery usPful hy marking t}H~ir position. A light-house . ·would also !'Hiii as a wurniug to vessels off Cnrter'11 shoals, on "·hich .Mr. Cobb says the sea 1loes not break in westerly wir11ls.

U. S. Scnooro-:n, JouN Y. MAsoN, Off Bfokiston's island, Potomac, .llpril 11, 184.S. DEAR Srn: The directions contained in your letter, dated Wash·
ington, April 5th, ha\'e been complied with, and as far as I considered necessary, I have personally inspected "the utility or otherwise of a light at Blakistou's island, in the Potomac;" and I am convinced that a light-house on this island woµl<l afford great facility to \'essels navigating the Potomac. The facts which r.onduce to this opiniun, are as follows: Firstly, Dlakiston's island is very low land with few marks or trees to clistinguish it. Secondly, the leacl is not to be trusted to approach this island from the main 1iliip. channel, as six fathoms water (soft botto10) can be carried to within two l1unclrcd yards of it, and in rnme parts of the channel t\'cn nearer. I ran sevtrnl lines of soundings to the main sliip clianncl, from different parts of the island anti in t!iffi:rent directions, ancl sounding in rapid succe~sion; the soundings on the verge of th

105

[ 1]

channt:l were as follows: two fathoms-the next cast three fathoms, then six, then l'ight fathoms. Suflidently indicative of its abrupt· ncss. This, together with the first fact pointed out, causes ves· sels to sail along the southern shore in order to noid the island, thus increasing the distance materially between the light-house, on Piney Point and Ce1lar J>,,int light boat. Thirdly, neither the 1ight-housc on Piney Point, nor the light boat at Cedar Point can be seen from Dlakiston's island, (that is to say, from the upper part of the island.) The channel here is about two miles wide. I am of the opinion, that were there a light-house on Illakiston's island, the Jistance by the courses now used and those which would then be used, would be dimini~hed more than four miles, in the ·case of large \'es~els, and.not le::ii; than six miles with vessels which can run over the Kettle Bottom shoals, without danger. Since the J>otomac river,, any where above Piney Point, may be considered a harbor, I cannot say that a light on Blakiston's island is so necessary to the safety of \'l'sscls as it is to facilitate nniga· gation; yet vessels liave been lost .in this vicinity. '!'he.course, when in the main ship channel, abreast Piney PointJ to pass clear of Hagged Point, is NW. by N., when above llagge l'oi 11 t, steer W. by N. until past .Blakist on's island-here the ilifliculty occurs, which is at night lo see Blalcist01i's-theri steer NW. by W!W. until up to a black buoy, off l3Ju[ Point. (This buo.y if twch·e miles from lllakiston's island.) The course froin the last name1l buoy to the light boat, off Cedar Point, is N. by W. All these courses are given per compass, anti are mentioned to show why I nm of the opinion that the distance may be diminished between Pint?Y J>oint au<l Cedar J>oint. A tower about forty ft:ct high, with a second class light, would, in my opinion, be sufficient. The southwest part of the island would probably be the most suitable site. I have sairl nothing of a small channel on the north side of the· island, as it is seldom, if ever, used at night. Trusting that this may contain all the information you desire on the subject, · I am, very truly and respectfully, yours,

l. Extract from letters from .!Jasiatant C. 0. Boutelle to the superintendent, dated Jarwary 10 and February 9, 1847, relating t<> the new inlets formed across Bodies' island, in 1846. "The southern and .principal inlet begins at about seven miles and one-eighth from the south end of the base of 1845. Its width, between high-water marks, measured on the Jine, is 202 yards; between low·water mark, 107 yards; deepest water on line, Decem· ber 31 1 1846, 6.5 feet below low-water mark. The northern one begins at about seven miles and a half; its width on the Jine, between high-water marks, is 162 yards; between low-water marks, 36 yards; deepest water, 2.1 feet. These inlets were formed in the gale of September 8, when the water from the sound overflowed the whole beach. A breach in the marsh had been made in the March 'gale, and a creek was formed across our line, extending nearly to the sea beach."

2. Extracts from a letter of .Assistant C. O. Boutelle, dated .llpril
' 29, 1847.
"On tlie 10th and 12th instants, I made an examination of the inlets across the presl.'nt Bodies' island base, in company with Mr. Neilson. The northern inlet is filling up, and cart! cnn drive across the bar on the ocean Fide at low water." ''The southern and principal inlet appears now Jess likely to close rapidly than it did in December last. While it has flJJed about n foot and a h.alf at the ocean entrance, it has rapidly deepened upon the sound side; and six feet of.water may now be found in the central chnnnel, at the distance of a third of a mile from the marsh. The other two channels remain very much in the same condition as when I surveyed them.'' ·

letter of .!Jssi~tant J. C. Neilson, dated November
4, 1847,

"At the inlets, the sea appears to have encroached on their south shore, cutting away the point of the island-the southern point at the marsh-leaving still the bar. The channel into the sound has, I think, deepened, and in some re11pects changed, although the loss of the stakes, to which Mr, Boutelle referred his observations, leaves me in some doubt no to the extent of the changes, but certain, how· ever, of having found no filling up." . · .

"Went t.o the south inlet, which I sounded thoroughly. It has changed in shape since last April, but retains about the same depth on the ocean side. On the sound side the principal ~lue has filled very much, and I could nowhere find more. than 3b feet water at the distance of half. a mile from the in lat. The water deepens again about three quarters of a mile west of .the inlet, and the channel inclines southerly, towards the Old House channel.

1st. Chandeleurs. Under the north point of these islands is a roadsteatl, protected in all winds from the northeast, around easterly to southwest. To this anchorage there is no bar. The best anchorage is the north point,. bearing per compass NNE., distnnt one mile, 4-~ fathoms water, sticky bottom. The only advantage of this harbor is of course as one of refuge, in case of heavy weather from seaward · .2d. Cat island. Into the harbor south of Cat island, 17 feet can be carried at orclinary low water. 'l'o the anchoragt> 1 south of the island, the channel is plain, but is exposed to southeast gales. The channel to the anchorage, {four miles above the light·house,) secure from these gales, is narrow and ditlicult, but well protected. 3d. Ship island. 1. The depth which can be carried oYer this bar is 19 feet at · or<linary low water. 2. The channel is perfectly easy 1 one course (see tracing) taking you oYer with but one or two casts on the ridge of shoalest water. 3. Continued strong northerly winds will depress the water at an extreme of two feet below ordiuary low \vater 1 and continued southeast, and south winos will raise the water from one foot to an excessive extreme of f'ight feet. . . . 4. In beavy southeast gales the sea is said to break upon the bar. This I have never seen, but judge it must be the case. 5. After crossing the bar, the channel, of from 4 to 6 fathoms, is nearly a mile in width. The distance from thl! bar to the anchor. agu is but l l miles. 6. 'l'lic bc11t anchorage for large vessels is in from 4 to 6 fathoms, sticky bottom, with west end of Ship island bearing south by west, per compass, distant from l to ~ mile.. The sound inside averaging but 2~ fathoms in depth; 110 sea of consequence could be ra:sctl from the longest reach. , 7. Four fathoms can be carried within .200 yards of the shore on ·the north side of west l'lltl of Ship island. 8. The nnchora~e, with water equal tc) depth on the bar, is five n1ilcs long, nverngi1.g three quarltrs of a mile wide, sticky and soft bottom throughout. 9. The a\'erage rise and fall of ti1le is about 16 inches. The coasters are well acquainte1l here, and good pilots could easily be procured by prtvious arrangement. 4. Mobile bay. (The foll owing extracts 11re from several reports made to Professor Bache, superinten1lent Unite<l States coast survey.) 1. "The clepth of water which can be carried over the bar at the entrance of Mobile bay, at mean low water, is 2oi feet, mean rise an<l fall of ti1le one foot." .2. "The channol is perfectly easy, one course north, i9° west, true, taking you over with but one or two casts upon the rid~e of shoalest water. 3. Continued strong northerly winds depress the water at the

.Ill
rxtreme 2 feet below mean low water, and continued southeast and south winds will ele\'ate it 2~ feet above, at an extreme 4 feet. 4. In heiwy southeast gales the sea is said to break across the . bar. This I han not seen, but judge it must be the case. 5. After crossing the bar, the channel varies from half to one mile in breadth, ~·arrying seven fathoms and pr:rfectly clear. u. The depth of the water immediately at the encl of wharf (50 yarcls long) at Fort Morgan (ort' Mobile point) is 6! feet, and 100 yards out· there arc five fathoms. In mitl channel, abreast of the wharf one-third of a mile out, there are 11! fathoms. 7. The depth of water at the anchorage of the fleet (merchant vessul:i;) in the bay is 3~ fathoms. There is perfoctly secure an· chor.1gc for large ''essels riorlhwest from J!'ort Morgan, distance one half to one mile in 8 fathoms. The anchorage is equally secure with the fort bearing Huth, per compass, in 4 fathoms; muddy and stick". 'fhe ridge of the bar, upon which is the shoalest water, appears to be very narrow, 11s we obtained but one cast, deepening gradually on the inner side and with 11;reat rapidity upon the 011ter. Upon the outer bPr, in 1822, the greatest depth which could be · taken was 17 feet, in lSU it was 19, in 18-17 it was 20!.; each at mean low wnter. In 1822, the distance from the position in which Sand Island light-house now elands lo the shoalest water in the channel over the bar was 3,150 yarJs, in 184: 1 this distance was 3,2.281 and in 1847 it was :l,402. , . Gal~s from the seaward alfect the bar and islancl more or less, but these are accidents which appear to be eliminated in long periods of time by a constantly acting cause or causes. 'fhe channel of 20~ feet O\'er the bar, is about 200 yards wide. That of l!) feet, half a mile. In approaching the oulel' bay the lead giYes no evidence of it, as in six or eight cas·s you run from 8 fathoms to 3&. 'l'he existence of the two fight-houses, however, materially lessens this difficulty. There are regula1· pilots always cruising off the "outer bar." The southeast an1l south winds deepen the water upon all the bars of this coast in a rntio clue to their several positions, being '·cry much greater in the angle of the coast at Ship island, and gradually lessening in degree as they are more tlistant from it. Heavy gales from these quarters are rclati\·ely rare, ancl prevail mostly in winter; but' occasionally in summer. 'l'hey necessarily throw in a heavy sea upon the bars, which, however, is met by the increased dl'plh from the same cause. . Northerly winds give less water, but smooth. They are the pre· vailing winds during wiuter, and, being off shore, caust: but little annoyance. . · . In summer the land and sea breezes are quite regular, and thun· der·squalls, sometimes of great danger, pre\·ail. As soon as the survey ot lower part of .Mobile bay and the har· bors of Ship and Cat island are finished, I would be happy to for·

.!Jnnuat report to the superintendent on longitude computations, by S. C. Walker, assistant Unittcl Stutes coast survey.

CA11rnnmaE, MAss., September 16, 1848. Sin.: Since my last annual report of SPptember 20, 1848, I have presented fifteen reports, numbered from X. to XXV. inclush·e, in compliance with special ini:tructions, and in furtherance of the general duty of m11king coinputations for astronomical longitudes of stations of the cnast survey. The tell'graph operations of last ycnr w~re banded, in J\·bruary Inst, to the check computor, Mr. Ruth, for final rc\·ision. 'l'hat labor was tempora-ily interrupted by his early resumption of field operations, and rt-mains to btJ completed this autumn. I enclose sections 1st, 211, ancl part of section 311 of my full re· port on the tt'lrgraph operntions bttween Cambriclgr and New York. This will cmbr::ce 41 article!!, by number, ·in the first three sections, and the remainder in section 4. Of thc·se, I sen1I you 29 articles of the work, bt!fore furnishing the remaining 12 articles of section 3rl, 11nd the whole of sec:ion 4th. I Fend, howe\'cr, the heads of the 12 articles partially complett·d for section 3d. With regard to the telegraph operntions for 18,18, I can only remark that the preliminary computations gi\'e an 11pproximate result differing only a small fraction of a second of tinw from the values alreacly reported in 1846, J1111uary 13, (Ill.,) and 1\hrch 11, 1848, (XII.,) based on tl:e observations of lunar culminations and the transportations of cliro· nomcters. It becomes my duty again to call your attention to a subject of gra\·e importance in the cletermination of the Jougitude of the cardinal point, (New York,) from those of the trigonometrical surveys of other nations aJludtd to in my 11pecial report of the 3d and 8th of May last, (XVI.)

(I)

In my first report, of Novcmh'<!r ·lG, 1SH 1 iri which I statecl the most probable lougitude of the Philadelphia obser\'atory, vii., 54., OOm., 40i.52.::eOs.35, I mail~ a reserve in respect to any consta1it errors of the methods. I there remarked, "it is to be l~oped that those of the latter kintl (coni;tant errors) clo not much exc'eed a sccoud of time." I ha\'l' only to a1l1l, after an interval of four years, that nll the additional light thrown on this subject by rt'frrring Wnsbington ;~nd Cambridge to Philadelphia by the telegraph opt'rntions, and combining the results of reports 1. 1 ll. 1 IV. 1 nnd XIV. 1 still con· firms the conclusion of my fi1st rl!port in 1SH 1 that the probable acddwtal error of t)1e method of eclipses and occultations, subject to parallax a111l semi-diameter, was at that time not greater than ± Os.35. None of the sulm·qucnt results ~y 'the same method ha\'e · nricd the longitude of the Pbilil1lclphia observatory from Grelm· . wich by more than :±~ Os.35 frorn the \'aluc of oA. Om. 40s.52, then reporteJ. This rcsullwas based on the use of Burckharilt's con· st1mt or 1nean value of tlte moon'~· senii·diamctcr ttnd horizontal equc:torial parallax. Any error in the ai-:sumplion of the correctness of the m.c1m semi-diameter of tAe nioon may be supposed to vanish in t.hc mean result of all these groups of eclipses anJ occultations. Such is not, howe\'er, the ch.se with the error of the assumc'J \'aluo of the moon's mean liori::onltll cqreatorial parallax. It does n«?t disappear in the uggregatc of these groups, but remains a constant rcsid:,al error, in the final ·result, of nearly the same order in longitude fo seconds of time ns that of the error itself in seconds of arc. Tl11s constaut source of error was more clearly anticipated in. 1845, in my report II., in "hich I rl'markecl as follows: "There is, however, a source of constant error common to classes IV. to VII., inclusiYc, viz: the uncertainty concerning the' true''alue of the moor1's horiiontal parallax. 'l'his element is not, like the other lunar clctnenls 1 SUSCl·ptiblfJ o( imtnc<Jinlc obscr\'ation in particular insta11ces, but must lie dcrh·ed theoretically from the tables. The fact that Professor Airy, in the Greenwich obsen·a· tions for 1840, hns aclopted i\Ir. Hen11erson 1!l dltcrminntion nnd iricreai;cd the value of llurckhnrdt's constant of the moon's hori?.ontal parallax by, H'ii"' shows the uncertainty of this clement. For the' sake of uniformity, I ha\'e not yet applied this correction, but have us1;:1l Burckhardt's 1;:lem1·11ts throughout as the basis for reducing both the occultatio.ns and correi:pnnding meri<li<\n obserrntions.' If I had uniformly employed Mr. Hcn1lerson's value insteacl of Burck· harJt's, I should ha Ye placed Philu1lclphia about 2s 1 in time, furth~l"' cast than at present rcp<?rted. 'l'he only instance in which the . error from this sourco lins bet·n completely climinotetl is in (class l V.) the ecli1lse of May 14, 1836. litre the full discussion of all tht! equations of contlition; computed by Rumker, gave me for the. correction of Durckhardt's con~tant a \'alue 0''.2 greater than Hcu1lcrson's. 1 hope, in the course of another yc11r, to complete the 1liscussion of all the obscnations of ·classes VI. and VII., within the limits of the survey, using Burckhardt'a elements with equa· tions of condition, by means .of which the e.ffect of any correction

of these t}\at may hereafter be in11icated on the longitude of Phil&.· delpliia may be applied at oncP.." It is useless to attempt to Jetermine the nmount aT1d conliequent correction. of this error of the moon's nwan parallax, by the ordinary' process of accumulating results of solar eclipses and of lunar occultations, compared with similar phenomena anti with meridian observations in Europe. In all the l1istory of the solar eclipses of the past, the illustrious· Besnd, in 1841, could find none that affor<letl the necessary tlata for making this computi.tion.· It is proper to remark, however, that he was probr\bly not awa,·c at that time tl1at the eclipse of May Hand 15, 1&36, hat! been so extensively obi.ervcd in America. I hE>g to c:.ill your attention to the report of the committee on tliat eclipse appointc1l by the AIHe· rican Philosophical Society,·;· which contains. my c·omputation of the error of llurckhanlt'11 mean value of the moon's horizontal parallax, from the group of conditio~ial equation~, cotnputcd by Hiimk~r, from the Europt-an a111l AmerH·an ob~crvat1ons. If ":e a1lopt tlie value of the correction oi' Burckhar1lt's mean parnllax of the 1110011, from that eclipse (vi:r.. + l''.52) anti apply it to the ~cries of eclipses and Gccult11tions that form the basis of my several reports abo\"e m1:ntione1l, it will probably be neces~ary to

diminish the longitude of all the statio11s of t/ie United States coast survey by about two seconds of' lime, or Ital/ a miuute nf ari:.
There are other grounds which 5trcngthen the presumption of the exister.ce of this trro1· in Ilurckhardt's consta11t rnluc of tlic mooll's parallax. . Olupsent has 1kducetl a similar correction of 2".22 from Lacaille's meri1lian altitu<les of the moon, obsened in the last cen· tury at the Cape of Good Hop(·, and compared with corresponding European obscrntions. He11derso11~ finds from his observations with the Cape Mural circle, as co111pared with the European, a riruilar correction of+ 1''.3. 1'.Iason, Burg, an cl JJamoif-eau, in their lunnr tables use1l a greater constant value of the moon's parallax than llurckbnr<lt's. Pla11a's theory of the moon giHs a similar correction. In my report of April last, I ga\'e the following proposed supplementary equations to he n1ldc1l to the orJinary result from the tables of :Burckhardt's, to wit: · d O. '19 x cos (2 I> - 3 0 + 2 Perigee D - 2 Perigee 0.) + 1. '1 1 x cos ( ]) - 3 0 + 2 J>erigee l> -· 2 Perigee O.) - o.

All these concurrent sources of information woultl han war· rantc1l a new C'omputation of the American longitu1les with the cor· rected semi·iliamctcr and parallax of the moon. Such a labor I had proposed to undertake, as soon as leil"ure cou\11 be found. It might be fairly inferred that the result would be a diminution of the dif· ference of longitude between the European and all the American stations of one or more seconds. · · It is proper to acid that, on consultation with Professor 'Peirce, by the instruction of the Ht?erintcn<lr.nt 1 about the first of July, it was concluded to recommend the following course, viz: to com· pute t.he correction of Ilurckhardt's i;emi·clinrncter by the formula above UH:ntioned, and compare the computed an1I obst~r'"ccl send1lia10eter in all cases of direct measurement, and U1ence deduce the . s' most plausible ,·alue for the co·el11cient -. to be used in tbe coast

'l'hcre was further inform;ition in the :irchh·es of the coast sur· \'ey, confirmntnry of the propriety of this st1!p, 1 fhc longit111!1! of the Cambri1lge observatory from Greenwich has been <letcrmineJ by Mr. lJond, from the transportation of 116 chro· nometers in 3-l \"oyages of the C:unar<l steamers from LiYerpool to Doi; ton. Thi11 result isstaterl in my rrport, XII., to be 4 !1,. 44 m. 30,492s. ±- 0.751 s. It is to be rc·grettecl that the data are yet wanting for computation of the longitude by the return Yoyages from Boston to Lin-rpool. The possession ot' them woulcl greatly increase the value of the chronometric result, by remo,·ing the constant source of error in the 11r.ccleration or ret11r1lntion ·of the sea rates. In my report XIV., 011 the longitude of Cambridge from Green· wich, as derived from lunar occultations ancl solar eclipse~, I find for the result, ·1li. 44m. 31.95s. An innease of' Burcklnmlt's parallax of about l''.5 would recoR· cilc these Jiscorila11t.res'11lts. It will appear from tny report XXIU on the American longitudes, by moon culminations, derived chiefly from the elaborate and ve1·y <Lccuratc comput·lions of Li<'utenant J. M. Gilliss, ast:ista.ut U, S. coal\t ~Ur\'ey, that this class of phe· nomena place the four st1ttions of Wasl:ington, Philatlc-lphia, Cam· bridge, and Hudson, Ohio, more tlwn two seco11ils of time nearer to Europe than the cclipsts and occultations with Burckhardt's parallax and seini·dh1mett'r of the moon. I deem it my duty therefore to· state my belief, from all the information no,\v before me in the archiYes of the coast s·un·ey, that all the cutronomical stations of

11,e U. S. coast survey, including fhB cardi?ial point, New Yer1', must be set down one or two seconds of time furtlier e'ast than tit.a placei hitherto assigned tliem by .llmerir.an and European astrono·

·bles, have fallen short of the precision that more correct tables '\Vould hne furnished, I ha\'l' the consolation to rt'flcct that other computers hne shared a 11imil11r f~te. I mi~ht m<'ntion in this con· nexion the 11nm1i!l of llittl.'nhousc, Bowtlit1~h, Paint! 1 nnd Peirce, among th'e American n11tro11omt!rs, and of l·'ricsnl'cker,. ~ach, l.alaudc, D1~ Ferrer, and Wurm, among the }:uropcau; all of whom ha.vc more or lcs!I confirmt!ll, by their ~~omputations 1 the results of my reports. De Ft:!rrer hn1l, in fact, notieed this constnut source of error in the moon~s mc1111 parallax, but bud not sullicic11t data to guard against its eff1~ct. Such was the state of our information from the archives of the coast sun·ey up to the first of July last, and such w«:re the conclusions to which I hail then arri'red. Since that timt· 1 howe\·er, a new era has occurre1l in our knowle1lgc of the lunar theory. I al· . Jude to the recent publication of the report of the astronomer royal of England, (Professor Airy,) on the reduction of tht- Greenwich <>bserrntions of the moon. An abstract of this report has just been received in this country, in the prorec1li11gs of tl11! Hoyal Astronomical Society of London for the Dth of June last. 111 it I fin1l full confirmation of the \'iew contained in my report (XVI) of 3d an<l Sth May last. The importance of the subject, and its direct bearing on the longitudeR of the U. S. coast surYey, will justify the quotation from the nrticlt.!. '' 'l'he astronomer roynl, after proposing the best hypothesis of -error which he can SUl,;'~cst, a111I bri11~in~ the Inter Camhri<lge and Greenwich observations to bt·ar on the suhj1·.:t, conclu1l<·s by saying, that probably !'Jana's mt·an value of parallax i;hould be a 'lit· tic increased and the moo11'11 mass be corrcspo111ling-ly diminished. He proposes in the future rtductions at Grce11wich, to increase . l D_urckhanlt's parallax by i~.;;; part." Again, he remarks, "The corrected co· efficient of the parnlladic equation is H?2''.37, but that i!I uncertain. An empirical l'quation woulll render the observations more accordant, but this has no probable physical foundation. The more likely cause for the obsene1l irregularities is a change in the moon's semi-di1rn11:ter, deper11li11g on changt·s in the telt·scope, or in the obserrcr. From the law of the inequality this co-eJiicient will· always be somewhat uncertain."* I will merely remark, that tl1e increase of. Durckhar<IL's mean \·alue of the moon's parallax of 3", (the i},~, part,) if adopteJ, will fully confirm tlae report of April last, an1l will justify the opinion above stated, that ult our Americun longitudes from Europe must .be diminished one or more scco11ils of tune. .As it i:; of g1eat importance t<' obtain Jcfiuite results before nnturing on a cha11gc that might have to b't! rclractl·il, I beg to suggest tile propriety of the following course of in\··.·stigation. . lst.

To employ a greater force of computers, and urge forward, by e\·cry possible means, the reduction of the American observa· tions of moon culminations, from 1842 to 184.6, using the blank forms of the coast survey. 4th. To employ additional force in forming the condiLional equa· tions for the eclipses ancl occultations, with corresponding meridian obserrntions in Europe, to the en<l of 1846; also, according to the coa!'t sun·ey blank forms. 5th. Frum the report of Professor Airy, and from any other available sources, and subsidiary computations, to find the m~st plausible theoretical elements for the moon's place on the nights the American observations. 6th.

To complete the discussion of the value 122''.37 of the co· cflicient of the parnllactic equation, ~iYen by Professor Airy. For this purpose it will be necessary to extend the discussion which Professor Airy has limited to the instruments of Greenwich and Cambridge, so as to include all those with which the transits and altitu1les of both limits of the moon have been ebserved at the same timt~ in any country, so as to clecide whether the theoretical co· efficient Of 122'1.37, or a more plausible empirical one, is to be adopted in the longitude computations of -the coast survey. 8th. To institute a full cliscussion of all the observations of occultations of tlie stars in the group of the Pleiacles· extant in any country. This discussion is t>arnestly recommended by Besselt as certain t0> afford in ore perfect data titan those from any other s~urce,_ for the determination of longitudes and for the correction of the moon's parallax and semi-diameter. 9th. 'l'o res'olve by the method of least squares, or otherwise, cenditional equations so obtained, after applying all the theMelical and empirical corrections to the lunar constants and co-efficients, so as to obtain the most plnusible ''alue of the correctiC1n of the longitudtJ of our carilinnl point from the average of tl1c European meridians. I regret that this outline is so copious that my personal efforts, after making aucl reducing the telegraph operat1ons, and after making out the numerous special reports, that ore needed in the department of longitude computations, arc hardly sutficient to malce a sensible impress1op upon the accumulating .mass of longitu1le observations in the cotst survey collection.
