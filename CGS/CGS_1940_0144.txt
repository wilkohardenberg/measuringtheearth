COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

The Coast and Geodetic Survey carries on a number of activities which are vital to the promotion of commerce and to the national defense. Its duties include the surveying and charting of all coastal waters under the jurisdiction of the United States; the production of aeronautical charts for air navigation; and the procurement of tidal, magnetic, ~eodetic, and other data required for water and air navigation as well as for a wide variety of engineering and scientific purposes. During the past year ser vices great in volume and variety have been rendered to the public and to numerous Govel'lm1ent agencies; the normal increase in the demand for the Bureau's products, which has prevailed for several years, being further augmented by the additional requirements of the Army, Navy, and other services in connection with preparations for the 11ational defense. The issue of 463,917 aeronautical charts and 407,186 nautical charts, an increase of 21.6 percent over 1939, again exceeded the distribution during any previous year in the hi tory of the Bureau.
NATIONAL DEFENSE

The work of this Bureau is as necessary for national defense as it is for other purposes. The project of original basic surveys of the Alaskan Peni11sula and Aleutian Islands, on which the Coast and G:eodetic Survey has been engaged since 1934, is of paramount importance in this respect. The magnitude of this undertaking may be visualized when one realizes the Aleutian Islands extend westward over 1,000 miles from the western end of the Alaskan Peninsula ai1d approach to within 250 miles of the islands off the Siberian coast. Geo.detic suyveys are essential for t.he control of military and other lnappmg proJeds and for the establishment of artillery fire control systems and other purposes. Tide tables, current tables, and tidal current charts are needed for navigation, ~he launching of ships, and for speed trials, and tidal datums are required in connection with h arbor fortifications and for the con truction of Army and Naval bases. Reprints of tide and CUl'rent tables are necessary during the year to meet the increased demands of our expanding Navy. A study was also begun of method!> of reproducing predictions prepared by foreign countries, to make this country independent of predictions supplied by other govem~nents under exchange agreements. Correct magnetic information is nec~ssary for both water and air navi~ation. Some Europeap co~1!1tl'ies have made more adequate magnetic surveys a part of theu· inihtary program. In naval and other communications, the new broadcasting of three-hourly intensity numbers, made possible chiefly

through observatory work, shows whether transmission difficulties at a given time are due to instrumental conditions or to the medium carrymg the message. The same know ledge of magnetic conditions is useful in the transmission, during magnetically disturbed conditions, of transoceanic messages by indirect paths. All seismologic data obtained by the Bureau have been applied to naval and other defense construction. An important addition to these data are the records of the Imperial Valley, Calif., earthquake of May 18, 1940. The experience of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in vibrating various kinds of buildings and building sites, and the development of instruments for this type of work, are proving useful. Both the Army and Navy have frequently called upon the Bureau for data or assistance in determining earth and building motions caused by earthquakes or other shocks. While it is not yet possible to apply all the information gathered, continuity in obtaining information insures continued attention to application of our latest knowledge in design of structures. Defense structures should not be menaced by earthquake at the time of possible enemy action. Buildings at Mare Island Navy Yar? were severely damaged by an earthquake during the Spanish Amencan War. Of the 407,186 nautical charts issued during the year, 154,165, or '38 percent, \Vere issued to the Navy and Coast Guard. Large quantities were also issued the Army, Maritime Commission, and other organizations engaged directly or indirectly on national defense work. Further assistance was extended to the Navy through the accumulation of reserve stocks of charts and the accomplishment of a considerable amount of special work. Of the 463,917 aeronautical charts issued during the year, 334,104, or 72 percent, were issued to the Army, Navy, Civil Aeronautics Authority, and Coast Guard. Other large quantities went to organizations such as the civil pilot training schools, engaged directly or indirectly on national defense. The' Army Air Corps and Civil Aeronautics Authority have requested that the regional and Alaska aeronautical charts be completed at the earliest practicable date. The Civil Aeronautics Authority has also requested that the program for airport charts be started as soon as possible. Numerous special investigations and experimental projects are now under way for these services. Special Publication No. 197, "Practical Air Navigation and Use of the Aeronautical Charts of the Coast and Geodetic Survey," is now one of the Government's best sellers. On June 1 the Army Air Corps and Civil Aeronautics Authority, both of whom use this publication as a manual in the training of pilots, requested a special printing of 20,bOO copies of the third edition. Eleven thousand copies of this manual on the shelves of the Superintendent of Documents were sold in a month and a half and a new printing ordered. Aside from the vital importance of nautical and aeronautical charts to the national defense, a very large percentage of so-called miscellaneous work is directly or indirectly related thereto. Under this classification are the printing of special prints and maps for the Civil Aeronautics Authority and the Maritime Commission; and the printing of geodetic control data and of planimetric maps, over 50 percent of the issue of which goes to the military services.

COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES

Four members of the Bureau were on temporary duty for two weeks or more each with the Field Artillery Observation Battalion at Fort Bragg, N. C. On special request of the 'Var Department, two of these men were detailed for marnmvers in Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. The use of survey methods such as are employed by the Coast and Geodetic Survey personnel during their routine operations was a valuable adjunct to this battalion. Other cooperation with the War Department included a gravity determination at the Aberdeen, Md., Proving Grounds, at the request of the Ordnance Department; and the following work, all at the request of the Corps of Engineers: Extension of triangulation over ~t large part of the Shasta Dam project area on the Sacramento River; extension of horizontal and vert.ical control along the Arkansas River, from above Muskogee, Okla., to its confluence with the Mississippi River southeast of Pine Bluff, Ark.; level lines to bench marks referencing river gages established along the San ,J 6aquin, Sacramento, and Mokelumne Rivers in California,; and extension of control work over small areas in the vicinities of Norfolk, Va., New York, N. Y., and Boston, Mass. Cooperation was extended the Army Air Corps in the determination of the following airplane speed trial courses: From Wright Field, Ohio, to Scott Field, Ill. ; from Wright Field to the vicinity of Eaton, Ohio; 3-kilometer courses each at Fairfield, Ohio, and Denver, Colo.; from Denver to Castle Rock, Colo.; and from Denver, Colo., to Tucumcari, N. Mex. Much of this work was done during December and January, the most severe weather of the winter. With the excellent cooperation of the Air Corps and the United States Coast Guard, which supplied pilots nnd planes, 11 sectional aeronautical charts were flight checked during the year and a considerable amount of airphotographic work was accomplished. This Bureau obtained the type of photographs needed for the most efficient prosecution of coastal topographic mapping, while personnel of the other services received valuable training and experience in airphotogra phic operations. Cooperation was extended the United States Navy by running precise spirit levels and making horizontal observations of alignment in connection with the laying of the track for model basin towing -equipment. This work wns performed in the large enclosed building at Carderock, Md., under conditions of almost constant temperature and formed an ideal laboratory for work of this character. Lines of levels in the alluvial valley of the Mississippi Hiver neces~ary to compute and adjust that region's entire network were completed for the Mississippi River Commission. · Eleven topographic quadrangle maps, and four navigational charts of the lake created by the Guntersville Dam, were reproduced for the l'ennessee Valley Authority. ~.A: large amou~t of photo~ithographic p~·intin.7 was. al~o done for the D1v1l Aeronaut1cs Authority, the Mar1tnne Comnnss1011, and other agencies and bureaus. Forty-nine cadet officers of the United States Maritime Commission Were given instruction aboard Survey ve:-;sels, to familiarize them 'With the many Bureau activities benefiting the merchant marine officer.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF COiMMERCE1

The larger ships had at various times from two to six cadets assigned during the field season on the Atlantic, Gulf, Pacific, and Alaskan coasts. Gravity observations were obtained at a number of stations in Wyoming and Idaho for the Geological Survey, as a basis for investigations to correlate various forms of geophysical and geological data in mountainous regions. Reciprocal agreements continued between the United States and England, France, Canada, India, and the Netherlands for the exchange of tide predictions. Cooperation with various projects of the "\Vork Projeds Administration included a leveling project in the Santa Clara Valley, Calif., for the examination for the eighth consecutive time of a region of large settlement in the general vicinity of San Jose. The results of the last leveling in the fall of 1939 indicate that snbsidenee, in one place more than 5 feet, has not only ceased but that. there has been a slight rise in elevation of the entire net dnring the past 2 years. Since there was a rise in the ground \Yater level at the snme time, geologists and others most capable of passing judgment on thjs matter, attribute the surface rise to the raised water level. Cooperation was also extended to vVork Projects Administration in the sponsorship of computing offices in New York, N. Y., and Philadelphia, Pa., at each of which there were employed an average of about 180 persons. Various items of equipment have continued 011 loan to Work Projects Administration projects. These include stel'l towers to the Massachusetts and Connecticut geodetic surveys and the Minneapolis city survey; theodolit<~s to the Massachusetts geodetic survey and the Cleveland city survey; precise levels to the Georgia and Arkansas geodetic surveys and the Cleveland and Mirnwapol i.s eity :,;urve_ys; and a repeating theodolite and base tapes to the M!'rc!'r Ummty, Pa., project. An administration fund was transfelT<'d to t.lrn Bm·pan to cover snch expensPS in comwction with assistance givm1 to "\Vork Projects Administration proj!'cts. This fund was also availnhle for eostsl of computing forms furnished to such projects and to defray exprPss and freight shipments. Science Service p:ti(l for the transmission of parthqnalu~ code nwssages from seismograph stations i11 the United States for the immediate determination of epicenters. These determinations are ~c'nt. to all cooperative stations. The Gulf Research and Development Corporation loaned the Bureau instnm1Pnts used in the determination of ditfer!'nees of vertical magnetic intensity at varions piers at the Chl'lknham ObsN·vatory. Data on magnetic conditions were furnished the corporation throughout the year, a.ml tests of their new type magnetometer started. The Bure.nu of Reclamation transferred $25,000 to the Bnrean for the establishment of three seismological sfattions in the vicinity of Boulcler Dam as a cooperative project of the two Bnreans aml the National Park Service. The stations are used to determine the epi· center of nearby earthquakes.

Close cooperation was maintained with the California Institute of Technology, especially the seim1ological laboratory, in seismological problems, including instrumental development. At the request of the American Standards Association, a Bureau representative is serving on sectional committee A-58, Building Code Requirements for Minimum Design Loads in Buildings. The Bureau furnishes fundamental seismological data necessary for the design of earthquake resistant structures. Seismographs were operated in cooperation witih the University o:f South Carolina, University o:f Chicago, Montana School o:f Mines, Montana State College, University of Utah, Utah State Agricultural College, Nebraska vVesleyan University, University of Hawaii, University of Ala.ska, vVoods Hole Oeeanog-raphic Institute, and the Bermuda Biological Station. The Jesuit Seismological Association operated a number of seismographs and close cooperation was maintained in the exchange of records and data. Tilt meters for determining the earth's tilt, and its relation to seismology, were continued in cooperation with the University of California. Reports on the effects of earthquakes were obtained with the assistance of the "\Veather Bureau, several universities, many commercial agencies, and individuals. The following activities were continued with the cooperation of the department of terrestrial magnetism, Carnegie Institution of vVashington: Operation of a cosmic ray meter at Cheltenham Observatory; maintenance at Cheltenham Observatory of international magnetic standards; atmospheric and earth electric currents at Tucson Observatory (the Mountain States Telephone ~~ Telegraph Co. and Bell Telephone Laboratories also cooperating) ; daily and \Yeekly radio broadcasts of magnetic conditions, in which the Navy Department and Science Service have also aided; and training personnel and furnishing instruments for the United States Antarctic :Expedition. Two scientific assemblies were held in Washington, D. C., dnring the year. The first was the Seventh Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, in Septembei· 1939. Various members of the Bureau are officers of the organization and took prominent parts in preparations for the meetings, as ·well as arranging for the entertainment, excnrsions, programs, and ,other fcatlll'es.- Others presented papers and took an active part in the seientific discussions. The second was the Eighth American Scientific Congress, in May 1940. Members of the Bureau also took an active part m presenting papers and in the discussions. While such conferences are an ideal medium for the promotion of international scientific cooperation and cordial contact. between natim.rn, recent world events have been disastrous to many such organizat10ns.
NEW AND IMPROVED METHODS AND EQUIPMENT

Two new ships of the most modern type for duty in the Aleutian Islands were added to the Bureau's survey fleet in the spring of 1940. The Explorer, a 220-foot vessel powered by a 2,000 horsepower steam turbine, with a cruising radius of 8,000 miles, is designed especially

118

REPORT OF THE SEGRE'TARY O:F 00.MJ\IE'RC'E:.

for long voyages in isolated areas. The B'. Leste1' Jones is a sturdy 88-foot wooden tender built for work in more protected waters. The thermosta6c control of the pendulum apparatus used in gravity determinations, undertaken some 2 years ago, has now been perfected. The chief difficulty in the adoption of this equipment to field work has been to eliminate any magnetic or electrical effect on the period of the pendulum. A small rotary offset press, similar to the larger presses now in use, has been installed in the Washington office, to relieve the larger presses from special work which does not require large printing plates. The Dorsey Fathometer No. 3 has now been installed on the survey ships Discove1'er, Pioneer, Explorer, and B'. Leste1' Jones, and automatic depth recorders to supplement the Fathometer have been placed on the ships Explorer, Oceanographer, Lydonia., B'. Leste1' Jones, Gilbe1't, and on several launches. Improvements continue in sono-radio buoys, now successfully used to distances of 85 miles. A mechanism was also designed to permit release in deep water of the anchor of the sono-ra<:lio buoy, so as to salvage the expensive anchor cable. Excellent results have been obtained with an experimental model of a newly designed portable tide gage. A radical departure from the older model, it is designed to eliminate nearly all lost motion and friction and is less expensive to manufacture. An improvement was also made in the standard tide gage, to reduce the weight and cost of manufacture. The support used for base measuring tapes was redesigned for construction of cast duraluminum, thereby providing a much lighter and cheaper device. Physical changes in high precision theodolites are constantly occurring during field use, by reason of handling, temperature changes~ lack o:f proper adjustment, and other causes. A program has been adopted of mstrument testing which it is believed will safeguard instruments from future serious faults of this kind. Signal lamps were improved as to rigidity of mounting and ease of focusing, and theodolites were improved by design of a positive yet simple means of adjusting the microscopes. Two dozen light tables, equipped with latest type fluorescent lamps~ were constructed for use in negative cutting. These tables provide soft even illumination, with an almost total absence of objectionable heat as the new lamps consume very little current.
CHART PRODUCTION

With demands for nautical and aeronautical charts increasing rapidly from year-to-year under normal conditions, there was suddenly added near the end of the year in connection with the national defense an unprecedented additional demand for these charts. The increasing output is shown in the following tabulation of annual issues and percentage increases for the last 4 years. Only a small portion of the demand resulting from the national defense program is reflected in these figures, since that program was not inaugurated until near the end of the fiscal year.

The total number of individual nautical charts available at the end of the year was 801, of which 163 were compiled and printed in Manila. Of the charts published in Washington there were 684 printings of 638 charts as follows: 10 new charts, 71 new editions, 534 new prints, 65 reprints, and 1 advance print. At the end of the year the Bureau was compiling 8 new original charts and recompiling 2 new charts. The 10 new charts published during the year are as follows:
825. 826. 827. 849. 937. 1050. 1051. 1263. 5020. 5118. Manasquan Inlet to Little.-Egg Harbor. Little Egg Harbor to Longport. Longport to Cape May. Elliott Key to Florida Bay. Frederiksted Road, Saint Croix, V. I. New Orleans to Calcasieu !liver (East section). New Orleans to Calcasieu River (West section). St. Joseph and St. Andrew Bays. San Diego to Monterey. San Clemente Island, northern part Wilson Cave.

Of the above, special mention should be made of charts 825, 8~6, and 827, prepared to meet the demand for large-scale charts of the mland waterway along the New Jersey coast. These three cancel chart 3243, on a smaller scale. With new chart 849, and others completed previously, there are provided a complete set of inland waterway charts. on a large scale :from northern New Jersey to Miami, Fla. The principal data received during the year consisted of 103 topographic surveys, 124 hydrographic surveys, 1,368 surveys from other organizations, and 741 chart letters. There were 5,693 changes in aids to navigation during the year. Dangers for hand corrections and data covering chart and related information were supplied the United States Coast Guard for announcement in its weekly Notice to Mariners. f\lthough charts went to the press on an average of one in 11 months, it was necessary to apply 1,603,186 hand changes to 313,419 charts to correct them to the date of issue. The issue of aeronautical charts shows a 27 percent increase over the fiscal year 1939. This is a logical trend accompanying all other statistics of the aviation industry which show comparable increases. The Bureau now publishes 106 aeronautical charts. Two new Direction Finding charts (23-DF and 26-DF), and four new Regional charts ( lM, 11M, 13M, and 17M), were added. There re.ma in seven Regional and five Alaska charts still to be published to complete the Pl'esent progrnm. To maintain their accuracy, 234 printings were necessary, of which 55 new editions were required because of extensive changes in air navigation data. The redesignation, for the Civil Aeronautics Authority, of civil airways effective in March 1940, has been an improvement over former designations and their addition to charts has progressed satisfactorHy.

Ou the Atlantic coast the sm·vey vessel Oceano,qmplwr completed her part of the offshore hydrographic project extending from the New Jersey coast to Nantncket Lightship, and began new basic surveys in the Gulf of Maine. The Lydonia continned on the former project. During the winter months both vessels were 011gaµ:ecl on offshore hydrogrnphic surveys along the coasts of North and South Carolina. '\Vire-drag investigations along the Atlantic coast in the vicinity o-f Sandy Hook were completed under the supervision of the commanding officer of the ship Ocermoqm711icr. The Gilbert continued work on surveys along the south coast of Cape Cod and cooperated with the Lydonia in the survey of Nantucket Shoals. The launch EZ8fr, II I began operations as a mobile revision unit along the Intracoastal ·waterways of the Atlantic coast. The lJrlilcawe during the summer of 1939 cont.i1nrnd surveys along the so11th coast of Cape Cod. With the close of the season the vessel proceeded to Norfolk, Va., an·iving October 23.

line, result.ing in the death of Clement A. Bennett, oiler, and the seri·ous injury of Lt. Max G. Ricketts; Anon J. Small, boatswain; 1Villiam D. Bennett, quartermaster; Elton E. Mooney, seaman A. B.; and Isaac It Jones, ship's cook. After the loss of the .11ikr1we, the personnel were assigned to the launches Ogden and Mitchell which took up combined operations in the Indian River, Fla., during the winter months. In the spring of 1940 this party began ::mrveys in Chesapeake Bay in the vicinity of ·Chester River and Eastern Bav. The scheme of seconcl-onler" coordinating triangulation along the northern shore of L011g Island from Oyster Bay to Gardiners Bay was completed. Coast Pilot revision parties were engaged in the collection of data for new editions of sections A and B of the Coast Pilot, covering the coastal a1·eas from the Canadimi boundary to New York Harbor. Compilations of line maps from air photographs taken "·ith the Bureau's 9-lens camera were made of Boston Harbor, Chester River, :and adjacent tributaries of Chesapeake Bay, and ApalacliPc Bay and :St. Marks Hiver on the Florida Gulf coast. Small air-photographic ·compilation units were in operation at Baltimore, Md., and Tampa, Fla. Air-photographic suncys in advance of inshore hydrography have proved so efficient and time saving that this procedure is being 11se<l whenever conditions permit. In the Gnlf of Mexico, the ship Ilydrographc1', "·ith the tender Fa11'is operating as a subparty, completed her assignme1it along the Texas coast and began operations in the central and eastern parts of the Gulf, with headquarters at Pensacola, Fla. A shom party completed the survey of the eastern half of Choctawatchee Bay, Fla., and of the Intracoastal 1Vaterway between Fort \Vashington and West Bay. On the Pacific coast all vessels were employed on a program of ·winter surveys. The ship G1iide operated off Cape Mendocino, Calif., in San Francisco Bay and off the Santa Barbara Islands, Calif.; the 8wveyor and 1Vestdahl completed winter assignments in the Sau .T nan Islands, Wash.; and the Discovm·er began a revision survey of Grays liarbor, Wash. The old Ewplorm· disconti1med work in Puget Sound in the fall of 1939 and was transferred to the National Youth Administration at Seattle, 1Vash., after service in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 35 years. The new Ewplo1·e·t', and the motor vessel E. Leste1· .!011cs, built under an allotment from Public vVorks Administration furids, Were commissioned in the spring of 1940 and assigned to Aleutian Island surveys. . A wire-drag party completed its assignment on suneys along the ·California coast. An arc of second-order triangulation was completed along the Washington coast from the mouth of the Columbia River to Grays Harbor, ViT ash., and a revision survey was made of vVillapa Bay. In southeastern Alaska the new motor vessel E. Lester Jones accomplished a short project in the outer southern approaches to Sitka, Alaska, before joining the fleet in the Aleutian Island:;;. The motor

vessel W estdahl continued work on original hydrographic surveys of Glacier Bay. The SU'rveyor was transferred from the Aleutian Islands where she had been engaged on surveys along the coasts of Unalaska and Umnak Islands, and began work on the eastern' end of a project of original surveys of the Alaskan coast, between Cape Fairweather and Cape St. Elias. In southwestern Alaska the new Explorer and the new E"'. Leste1'' Jones extended surveys in the Aleutian Islands westward from Umnak Island. The Pioneer, working in cooperation with the Ewplorer·, extended triangulation to Amukta Island and accomplished offshore hydrography south of the Islands of Four Mountains. The Discover·wr, assisted by the tender Wildcat, continued operations. along the south coast of the Alaskan Peninsula eastward from the Sanak Islands. The Guide continued work on the Bering Sea side of the Peninsula on the project extending northeastward from Cape Saricheff. In the Philippine Islands the Pathf;nder continued surveys on the west coast of Palawan. The Fathomer was recommissioned early in the year and began survey operations in the area between Balabae· and Cagayan Sulu. The 13 United States Coast Pilot volumes, which are kept current hy annual supplements, contain a wide variety of important informn-· tion supplemental to that shown on the chart, such as detailed <lei:cription of the coast and information concerning the waterways, as well as maritime data for the ports of the United States and possessions. New editions of Coast Pilots are published as often as wnrranted by the number of changes made nnd the amount of new information available. Three supplements to United States Const Pilots and one to the Hawaiian Coast Pilot were published during the fiscal year. New editions of the West Indies Coast Pilot and volumes I and II of the Philippine Islands Coast Pilots were published. Manuscript was prepared for a new edition of United States Coast Pilot B, covering the Atlantic coast from Cape Cod to Sandy Hook. The field stations of the Bureau in the United States, Honolulu,. and Manila, continued to render valuable service in supplying information for the correction of charts in their vicinities and in disseminnting navigational and engineering data in response to requests from local public and official sources.
GEODETIC WORK

The demnnd for goedetic data was greater than for any year in the history of the Bureau. In addition to :furnishing data in response to a large and increasing variety of requests, there has been conducted a large nmount of field work in cooperation with other~ organizations, for which the latter :furnished the necessary funds ..

Evidence of the value of control surveys continues to increase as the work advances. This natural reaction is doubtless due in large measure to the final geodetic datums for triangulation and leveling adopted in 1927 and 11)29, respectively. Strangely enough it took more than a century before the Federal control of this country, started by Hassler in 1817, had attained the scope of a nation-wide network, ready for adjustment into a rigid and final system of coordinates for geographic positions and of elevations. The importance of this work is more deeply appreciated when one realizes that the maximum value of control work can be obtained only where it is completely coordinated into a single system or datum as a means of obtaining uniformity in field and office procedure over the country. Once a poi11t on the earth has been marked by a monument and its position fixed, through the horizontal control system of the United States, or an elevation has been definitely established, it is of value to citizens for all time to come. Points not so coordinated are less useful. These data of geographic positions, azimuths, distances between stations, elevations, basic gravity values, etc., are of indispensable value in the extension of all kinds of public works projects, flood control, surveying, mapping, and other engineering and scientific; activiti~s where coordination is essential so adjoining projects may meet without gaps or overbps. Three triangulation, two leveling, one astronomical, and one gravity parties operated through most of the year in the accomplishment of control in various sections of the country. Much effort was directed to the completion of gaps in previous work, so as to consolidate the existing fundamental net, coordinate supplemental projects of other organizations, and make available the processed data as early as practicable. Variation of latitude observatories tit Ukiah, Calif., and Gaithersburg, Md., were continued in operation. This progl'am was initiated many years ago under the joint auspices of the Intemational Astronomical . Union and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. The expanded geodetic program of 11)32-35 left a large accnmnlation of field records. Since that time and particularly during the past year, this situation was relieved by the processing of material through the efforts of the Washington Office and personnel in the New York and Philadelphia processing offices. It is believed that another year will relieve the arrearage almost completely. Somo of the principal projects which have been processed during the year include: Triffingu.lation.-The adjustment of cooperative projeets of triangulation in the Sacramento Hiver Valley, Calif., along the Arkansas

and Columbia Rivers; and in Puerto Rico. Further adjustments,. smaller in scope, ·were begun in Norfolk, New York, and Boston Harbors. Adjustments of the triangulation along the Hudson River :from New York City to above Troy, N. Y., and in northern Maryland and eastern Pennsylvania, were also completed. This year witnessed the completion of the adjustment of the triangulation along the Mississippi River from the headwaters in Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico, in cooperation with the United States Engineers over a period of some 10 years, beginning in 1929. This project coordinated the field surveys in that region by the Corps of Engineers with those of the Bureau. Lm,eUng.-The adjustment of the. net in the general vicinity of Clevelarnl; a local net in Kentucky; and a special adjustment of the leveling in the Boulder Dam area.
TIDE AND CURRENT WORK

Eighty-five primary and secondary tide stations were in operation during the year: 41 011 the Atlantic coast, G 011 the Gulf coast, and 38 on the Pacific coast. Of these, 38 were conducted in cooperation with other agmwiPs, ineluding the United States Engineers, the Navy Department, Territory of Hawaii, cities of New York, Santa 1\fonica, and Los Angeles, Port of vVillapa Harbor, \Voods Hole Oc0anographic Institution, Clws:tpeake Biological Laboratory, and University of \Vashington. Shorter periods of observations at approximately 120 additional stations were obtained in connection with hydrographic surveys and other activities. A tide survey of the Sacrnmcnto-San .Joaquin Rivers was continued thronghont the fowal year with 12 standard gages in continuous operation. Also co11tinue(l througl1011t the year was a tide survey of the Connectic11t River, in cooperation with the office of the District Engineer at Providen('e. Six stations "·pre in openition between Saybrook and Hartford. No cm'l'ent surveys were cornlucte(l. Some current observations Were sel'ured however by hydrographic parties and in coopPration with other organizations. Through the cooperation of the United States Coast Guar<l, a 18-month series of hourly current observations "·as completed at Fire Island Lightship, approximately G% months of similar observations >n~re sel'nrcd at Ovcrfalls Lightship and 1 lllonth at Portland Lightship. At the end of the year observations were still in progress at Overfalls and Portland Lightships. In cooperation with the J)ppartnwnt of Highways, Suffolk County, N. Y., current observations wen~ obtained at nine stations i_n the vicinity of Shinnecock Bay, Long Island. The need fm· eomprehmisive current surveys i11 important waterways was emphasized by nnmcrous requests for cnrrent data which could not be adequately supplied bceanse of the meagerness or total lnck of observatlona I material for the localities concerned.
MAGNETIC WORK

Cont in nous 111ag1wtie information was obtai1wd at five obsprvatorics locrited at Cheltenham, Md.; Honolulu, T. H.; San J unn, P. R.; ~itka, Alaska; and T11se01i, Ariz. Mag1H~tic observations were made either to improve the magnetic sm·vey or to keep record of the

·changes i1t the earth's magnetism. The resulting information is used by the navigators of sea or air, the land surveyor, and the explorer of oil and mineral resources, and has proved exceptionally valuable in connection with radio communication. New methods have made it possible to furnish this information in convenient form by radio broadcast or otherwise. Special effort was given to making accumulated data of the past available for use. Two Work Projects Administration undertakings-one in New York City and the other in Puerto Rico-have done considerable work on the Polar Year records. Magnetic data were supplied for 180 charts. The need for a nonmagnetic ship with which to make magnetic ·observations at sea is becoming more acute. Observations cannot be made with the present steel ships, and since the destruction of the .Carnegie in 1929 none has been obtained. Therefore, the value of the magnetic declination on the charts is becoming less and less reliable. Changed magnetic conditions necessitated the construction of a new observatory at Sitka, Alaska. Many improvements were made to instruments and methods with the aim of reducing time spent in! eventual processing of records as well as increasing the accuracy. The distribution of magnetic observations during the year is shown in the following table:

SEISMOLOGICAL WORK

The Bureau's seismological work consists in recording distant and 1ocal earthquakes; obtaining data by an elaborate system of questionnaires; exchanging information with many institutions; measuring the character and magnitude of natural periods of vibrations of structures and the ground; and cooperation with other Government agencies, scientists, and educational institutions in the study of effects ·of earthquakes, with a view to improving present means of safo:guarding life and property. Seismographs were opernted at observatories in Tucson, Ariz.; Honolulu, T. H.; Sitka, Alaska; and San ,Juan, P. R. The Bmeau -cooperated in the maintenance of seismographs at nine colleges a,nd a,n equal number of independent stations scut their records to the Bureau :for study and interpretation. Sixty strong-motion seismographs for the recording of strong local shocks were maintained at 52 stations, and 24 records were obtained for 6 earthquakes. Twenty-three vibration tests were made in 5 buildings, 3 tests on 1 bridge, and 88 ground period tests at 17 locations. Approximately 100 records were obtained on shaking table tests of instrumental equipment. Recording of fault noises in two deep wells wa,s carried on intermittently. Three tilt-meter stations were maintained. Intensive questionnaire coverage was obtained for 14 earthquakes of semidestructive character and over 3,300 reports on approximately 400 earthqua,kes were received. Many institutions requested photographic copies of the original records.
PERSONNEL AND FINANCES

The Bureau had a, personnel of 1,430 on duty at the close of 30, 1940-398 (18 commissioned and 380 civilian, including 20 civilians paid from emergency allotments) on duty in the Washington office, and 1,032 ( 146 commissioned and 886 civilia,n) in the field service. The field personnel included 51 civilian employees on duty at the Manila Field Station and 50 members of the crew of the ship Fatho11wr paid by the Philippine Insular Governnient but under the jurisdiction of this Bureau.
