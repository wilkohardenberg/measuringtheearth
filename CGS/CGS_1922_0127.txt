INTRODUCTION.

In. the. past year this bureau has made notable progress in advnncmg its wprk. This has been accomplished through efforts of the personnel of the bureau operating in Vf ashington and in the field. supplemented by the help of the Secretary of. Commerce and .the Director of the Bureau of the Budget: .

HEPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST A~D GEODETIC SL'RVEY.

My report for last year emphasized the urgent need of new vessels to take the place of craft that, on account of age and unsuitability for our work, had been condemned and sold. This need has been met by the transfer of two mine sweepers from the Navy Department to this bureau. This transfer was made possible by the efforts of the Bureau of the Budget. These vessels were renamed the Pioneer_and the D/$ao-verer. They are of the seagoing tug type, of robust construction, built in 1918 for sweeping for mines. They are constructed of steel, with single screw, length of 180 ieet, beam of 35 feet 6 inches, maximum draft of 10 feet, displacement of 1,000 tons, triple-expansion reciprocating engine, 1,400 indicated horsepower, maximum speed 14 knots, cruismg spee4 11 kno'.s, two sel?arate boiler compartments, water~t~be b01lers, 011 fired, fue~ capacity 82,660 gallons, fresh-water ·capacity 25,000 gallons, and with quarters for a complement of 11 offirnrs and 54 men. Plans and specifica ~ions were prep~red to alter these vessels so as to fit them for surveying duty. The vessels as built were, in general, well ad_apted to that purpose, but they did not7 have sufficient accommodat1ons for a large surveying party, and Congress in .a deficiency item provided the necessary funds for al '.ering them. These· alterations are now iJractically completed, and both vessels will soon leave for the Pacrnc coast. Recently arrangements were made through the Bureau of the Budget for the transfer of a third mine sweeper. This vessel is the Flanungo, now laid up at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, which·will be renamed the Guide. · Congress has again 'helped by: providing the funds for similar alterations for this vessel, but no work has yet been undertak~n, as the e_ntire rnrvey persm:~nel necessary to man her is engaged m prosecutrng· field work durmg the good weather of the summer season. As soon us the weather conditions yrevent continued efficient field work, readjustment of field parties wil :furnish sufficient personnel to proceed with alterations of this vessel. . There has been great need for an addition to the bureau's fleet;,of surveying vessels, and it is an assured fact that 'these three ships will materially increase the output of hydrographic work, thereby expedi'.ing the charting of our waters. In addition to this,. the unit cost will be decreased as a result of having more up-to-date equipment. . . Another step forward has been taken in connection with the administration and maintenance of our headquarters in 'Vashington. Due to rendjus:ments in existing methods of handling- the personnel and carrying on our other work. the number o:f employees has been reduced. This has resulted in an actu!!l saving to the Government and a marked increase in the efficiency of the office. · · . Another matter worthy of including in the opening pag~s of this report is the carefully worked out organization in the manner of handling the sale of cha.rts, coast pilots, and tide _table:; ~f the bureau,· as a result of which they were put more easily withm the reach of the public and at the s"ame time kept up to their highest degree of efficiencv. . , The Coast and· Geodetic Survey is essentially a manufacturing plant, and its usefulness is therefore determined· to a considerable extent by the availability of its product. Realizing this. the greatest

pains have been taken to perfect a selling organization which, .on the one ·hand, will en!lble the navigator promptly and readily to :obtain the latest correct publications dealing with any part of om· navigable waters,·while, on the otheJi hand, it protects the public pocketbook against.undue loss re-suiting from the fact, which will be explained in a moment, that the chart is a perishable product, requiring fre.quent renewals o'f stock. · . · · · .Anyone can obtain these publications by writing to the Washington office of the bureau, but their principal distribution is effected through the hureat1's field stations and agencies located at vantage points .along the coast. Every se.aport of any importance in the country has conYenient access to ·at least one SU.ch .agency, while the maximum number at any one place is fo'Q.Iid at New York, which has.8.. In the United States on June 30, 1922, there were 112 such agencies; in Alaska, 12; in Canada, 5; in the Philippine Islands, 4; and in Hawaii, Porto Rico,· the Canal Zone, .Germany, and· Italy, 1 each. , The agencies are given to .ship chandlers, dealers, in marine hardware, makers and repairers of nautical instrnments, compass ad'justers; in other words, to those merchants with whom the navigator naturally comes in contact during his stay in p9rt. Charts are sol.d to these. agentH at 66* per cent of the retail price, and each agent is under contract to sell at neither more nor less than the price printed on the publication. . · · ' l have said that the chart is a pel·ishable product, and that state.ment1 doubtless requires explanation. In the zone lJetween land and :sea which ·it. portrays constant changes are in progress, due alike to ·natural 1forces .and, to the works· of man. Oceun w11 ves and currents are consta:13-t!Yi :taking material from .one pluce and· depositin(J' it in an~ther. .River. ·~urrents are carrying their burdens of sediment, winch they deposit on reaching the open waters of the oce.an. Ilars an~ chann~ls ure constantly shifting. Men are dred(J'ing channels, fillmg up,t~de flats and building their manufacturing plants or terminal facilities upon them,, .and establishing- or shifting lighthouses, . beacons, and buoys to conform to the changmg dl~mands of commerce. The charts must be kept corrected to show all these chanaes. This means that ench editioh of the chart of:any of our importap.~ seaports soon becomes oLsolete and must be superseded by a new edition sqowing the changes that have ,occurred since the preceding one was printed. If these changes affect important details, it may become unsafe for a mariner to use the preceding edition, and some means 1must be :found to prevent his purchasing an obsolete copy. 1 '' For this reason the survey maintains a strict control .over the stock·cof charts in the hands of its agents. They can not sell to other./~rms who are not agents. Whenever new arid important in:formnt~0n is received, n new edition of a chart is printed. Agents are notified in adrnnce, of this new print and are required to withdraw from: stock all copies of the chart to tie superseded. These c~arts are ,Iaterc destroyed .by some Federal officer and the agen~ is given credit for their value.. Agents are required to order pubhcat1ons :fr~quently :and in quantities only sufficient to meet their needs for ·a brief per10d; .

portant agencies . are inspected annuaJll· and the less important biennially. The field stations in charge o ari officer. of. the survey are located in a number of. the principal seaports, part of their. function being to exercise supervision over the agencies in their respective districts, as well as to serve as a point of contact between the survey and the public. The Notice to Mariners). a weekly publication issued jointly by the Coast and Geodetic >:;urvey and the Bureau of Lighthouses, keeps the mariner informed of all important items affecting navigation in American waters, including a notice of all new charts or any new editions published by the survey. About 4,000 copies <>f the publication are distributed free each week. · One additional item is. required to perfect this part of the service which the bureau renders the rublic. The charts are constantly being corrected in a multitude o minor details, each of which is important but not sufficiently so to justify new editions with the resulting cancellation of existing copies. These corrections reach the public from time to time in the form of. new prints of the current edition, which are made as the existing stock becomes depleted. As a rule, the information regarding these changes has been· furnished the navigator in the Notice to Mariners, so that it is to sonie .e"-1:ent possible for him to make the necessary corrections on his own charts. It would be a great convenience to him, however, if a draftsman could be assigned to each of our field stations. The mariner could then bring his charts to the station and have them corrected durin~ his stay in port. In fact, the service would be more than a convemence, for this draftsman could make corrections which the· navigator can not make because of his lack of skill to depict them, and the latter could then use the charts with assurance of their adequacy, which he must lack as long as he makes the corrections himself. The British have long maintained such a service, but the Coast and Geodetic Survey· has thus far been unable to inaugurate it because of lack oflrovision of the necessary personnel. nother important item in which marked progress has been made during the year is in making our records accessible. and at the same time protecting them, in a measure at least, from the hazard of fire and from unnecessary exposure and handling.' A fireproof vault was provided in 1918, for the field sheets of the survey, but the other records remained on wooden bookshelves, which not only endangered them through hazard of fire but also made them subject, on account of their age, to rapid deterioration through exposure to dust, etc. Another item of good administration is the installation of modern metal bookshelves. To-day these ·valuable records, although not afforded the protection which would result from their housing' in a fireproof building, are yet for the first time given the maximum protection :from destruction and deterioration which is possible ·So long as the bureau occupies its present quarters. · · The extent to whicli these records are mvolved in the bureau's need for new and modern housing will be evident when we recall that they are the results of a century of continuous activity. If destroyed, no amount of money could reproduce them, for they picture facts and conditions which no longer exist. They constitute the· only ·record of their kind in .the field of activity delegated to the surveya record which is constantly consulted by persons interested in spe-

cific problems which in many cases can be solved only by the assistance thus afforded. The physiographer studying the evolution of our changing coasts; the engineer seeking to protect valuable land from erosion or for the horizontal and vertical control of his engineering ~rojects in the ~terior; the surveyor endeavor~g, to ~e~race some lme surveyed with the compass many years ago;· the litigant who, to establish his claim, must procure an authentic map showing an area as it existed at some former period; all these are constantly turnin~ to the Coast and Geodetic Survey for assistance which can , · be renctered only by reference to. these records. . . . , Another step forward has been taken iri the handling of our charts and other nautical publications which has resulte«i in a greater income to the Government. This is an increase of 50 per cent in the prii;es at which these publications are sold .to the public. This. increase was made to m.eet the greatly increased cost .pf an .materials used in chart production in .order to conform to. the law which r~. quires. that these publications shall be sold as nearly as practicable at the .cost of paper and printing. Inasmuch as the entire, amount received is returned to the Treasury of the United States, .this means that nearly double the former return from the sale of charts, 'coa$t pilots, and tide tables goes to the credit of the Government: · · ·

' Part !.-SUMMARY OF CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE BUREAU. CHAPTER I.
IMMEDIATE INCREASE IN SALARIES THE VITAL NEED.

In my preceding reports, and especially in my report for 1921, I discussed at some length the fundamental trouble m. this bureau and, referring to the bureau ns an efficiently functioning organization, I laid stress above everything else upon the deplorable situation of the underpaid employees of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Unfortunately, this condit'on has _not been changed, and while manv other things have been 'done to benefit the burea11 it is mv. opinion that.the bureau as a business organization can not function· properly until this fundamental trouble is corrected. · · . ' · ·· · The average person does not realize that the very hl-art of the Go\iernment, speakmg of it as a whole, is being eaten awa~·, lPnving what appears from the outside viewpoint to be a working organization, but one which is steadily and certainly dewriorating from within. Instead of encouraging, or at least making certain that the able men Qf the Government are retnined -and made reasonably satisfied, there is n deplorable lack of action for this desired result which is working toward a sure and certain depletion of the Yl'l'Y backbone of the working forces of the Government. In 1886 steps were taken through the proper channels to make a readjustment, or reclassification as it is better known, of the Government salaries, but after 36 years, with much money spent on investigations of this subject, conditions are unchanged, and from the standpoint of economy and wise administration it appeals to me that it would be infin:tely better to curtail some of the existing projects if necessary and use the money to remedy this pressing evil. The institutions for higher education in the United Stntcs have plants and endowments representing· hundreds of millions of dollars. Tens of thousands of the most ambitious young men and women at great expense spend about :four years each at these institutions in taking advantage of the opportunity to acquire a higher education. Many of these young people have a vision of being able as a consequence to serve the Nat' on 'better in some intellectual pursuit. Little do they know what is before them. After graduation, often with debts incurred in order that their college work may be completed, thev are offered such meager compensation in the intPllectual field that inanv of tlwm are forced out of it into position'l in the industrial and commercial fields, where they are not only no better off for their higher education but are often actually handicapped because of it · There is no better way to illustrate the deplorable situation regarding the underpaid employees of the Government than to use as a

parallel what has recently transpired at one of our large universities. The trustees of this university have announced that hereafter no instructors who are married will be engaged. In other word!'!, jnstructors are paid such low salaries that they can not support and rear a family while connected w'th the institution. Their condition is very similar to that o:f many o:f the highest-trained men in the Government to-day and is practically what many o:f the ablest men of the Government are :facing. They are not able on the salaries paid them by the Federal Government to maintain a family in reasonable comfort and security, and this appeals to me as an inexcusable situ· ation. . Under present conditions the Government must either be deprived of securing and keeping the best men in the service, or these .men if secured must be deprived of the privilep;e of marry"ng, or, lf married, from raising a family. These are hard facts,·but nevertheless they are true and should be faced frankly, as the existing conditions are just the oppos'te of economy and good-business. . . Is it not time for the thinking people of this land to stop· and consider the danger of starving its intellectual workers? Should not the improvement start in the Federal Government~ With few exceptions the salaries offere~ to men and wome~ by the Gover1,1ment are .below those paid for skilled labor in mechanical trades outside of the Government. There is much· talk throughout the country of people flocking to the Government serv'ce. This has not b,ee~ noticed for many. years by· those officials seekin~ persons. who (lu.n r~a,IJy do the work as it should be done. After .trymg for mo~th~ '!P~.Y~aX!l to get personnel of the proper caliber, the respons1bl~ o~c,1a~. ar.e, pften compelled by circumstances to take the best mate;ria~ wll_1ch. offers. '.J'he result is that there has been a gradual deteriorat10n m the personnel of the Government service and if this is not · checked the consequences will be more d'.sastrous than many realize. The Government is to-day. in dire need of the services of well educated and trai!led men and wo'meil., but the only w11y ill wl}-.lch it can. att~act. t~ein. ~s !o. give, s1\la,ries at least as large· as those paid to tramed wo~kers in .coimne:r<le and industry.. The Gov(lrnment .is, or should be, m th~ murke~ to ;buy :the ~vices of the highe~t type,s of men a_nd wo~e1i.. It ~111 e·the~ g~ e}Jlpt~ hanqed or w11l pave ~o be satisfied with mfer10r material if it will not pay the price, and must therefore suffer the inevitable consequences. The existence of underpaid intellectual workers in the Government and in the faculties of our universities and colleges ;s a blot on our body politic. Those in whom the remedy lies should at once- take serious thought of this most serious condition. , .

CHAPTER II.
THE BUREAU'S MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS.
NEW BUILDING NEEDED FOR ECONOMY'S SAKE.

During the past seven years the necessity of a proper building for the housmg of this bureau has been reiterated in my annual reports. During this time and until the situation is remedied the output of the bureau has been and will necessarily be produced at an abnormally excessive unit cost. This is due to the fact that the buildings occ_upied by the bureau are wholly unsuited to the purposes for which they are used. . The bureau is housed' in seven different buildings, only one of which was designed to serve· its needs, and even this one is a wartime product, constructed in haste to provide for expansion that was absolutely necessary to supply the Navy with charts and navigating instruments during the war. The other six were constructed long ago and for other purposes-two for dwellings, one of which was later equipped with iron window blinds to provide fire protection when rented for the occupancy of this bureau, another for a stable for the two buildings to be occupied as dwellings, and two others to be used as hotels. Yet these buildings of different sizes, different floor elevations, separated 'in groups and connected by open and inclosed bridges, constitute the home of an organization that prepares and prints and charts of all of the navigable waters adjacent. to. the United States and its possessions. · There is a direct loss, indefinite in calculation but nevertheless very apparent, with the bureau housed in the present unsuitable quarters. While the ·bureau is an industrial or~anization, its oeeration is based on Government. appropriations and not on competition with , other industrial organizations. W ~re the existence of the bureau dependent on competition with like industrial organizations the high. unit cost of production resulting from improper housing facilities would manifest itself at once and force remedial steps. Industrial organizations that have successfully met competition have early discovered the necessity of adopting labor-saving devices and routing work, so that the maximum i.s accomplished with the minimum of effort. ·· Such ideals can not be attained· in this bureau. The reasons are readily brought to light if we trace any given output of the bureau through the line of production. Take, for example, the production of a nautical chart. The raw materials from which a nautical chart is compiled are obtained from various sources. Largely they constitute the records 0£ field sµrveys 0£ this bureau, surveys by the Corps of Engineers 0£ the Army, and of other governmental organizations. The original records from these sources are valuable and must be protected from fire. They are therefore necessarily filed in the most nearly fireproof building 0£ the bureau. This is

a considerable distance from the drafting hall (350 feet), and muchvaluable time is consumed by the draftsmen and"compilers ·in going to and from the fireproof building to search out records. that are needed. 'l'he ·archives in which these . records are kept should, therefore, be adjacent to the drafting hall, but th~s is impossible as· the bureau is housed at present. ! · · 'l'he next step in the production of a nautical chart is to either prepare from the complete drawing an engraved plate from wh1ch to print the chart or to reproduce the drawing by lithography. The: lithographers and ·the engravers should, therefore,- be adjacent to! the compilers of the chart and under the direct supervision' of the: chief or the division. To obtain J,Jrope~ li~hting :facilities for this· work, the engravers are necessa1'1ly distributed throughout three different lmik1ings, and t9 reach the lithographers the chief of the division having the work in eharge must pass through five different . buildings. Under these conditions a high degree of efficiency is im: possible. When th.e chart is prepared for the press either on· an· engraved or lithographed plate; further delays necessarily result from the fact that the printing presses are housed in one building while the paper stock 1s housed in a separate detached building, necessitating its removal and transportation by hand from the detached building to the building in which the printing presses iJ,re housed. Again, when the charts are printed they are necessarily stored on , · the shelves in a building detached. from the one in which they were· printed, which necessitates their transportation by hand to a different building and assembly on shelves provided :for their storage: This cumbersome method of production of a nautical chart is duplicated in every other output of the bureau, and year by year the prodl1Cts of the bureau are brought forth at an excessive unit cost. The remedy is a new building designed to permit production at the lowest pose r,ible unit cost.
WJRF.-DRAG WORIC JN NEW ENGLAND WATERS SHOUTJ) BE JlESU:\f'ED AND COMPLETED WITHOUT DELAY.

Last year in my report, and also before the appropriations committee, I laid emphasis on the :fact that the wire-drag work in New England waters, stopped during the war, should be resumed and completed without delay. The amount necessary to carry on the work was refused, and I renew the recommendation that ~very effort be made to secure the funds to carry on the work during the fiscal vear 1924. · Too much stress as to the importance of this work can not be a'd, vanced, as greater amount of shipping and increased draft o:f vessels· are only foi·ewarnings that sooner or later unless tbese close surveys :ire made mishaps will result, with loss of life and property. It is erroneously believed by many that on account of these· w:iters being so old in com;iection with shipping no disaster c,an happen, yet it is only a few years ago that n ~essel. struck a rock at the entrance, to Bm:zards Bay~ and :only good fortune. prevented th'c 1vC>ssi>I '. from"foupdcring . ..As it was, it was bndly damagerl. and ·whereas the water surrounding the rock indicated a depth of 5 fathoms, or 30 feet," over the bowlder itself there was only 17 :feet· of watei".

~mphasizes the old question that is asked, "'hy don't vessels hit these. submerged rocks? And the answer is, Give them time enough and they will. · . Wire dragging is an important part of the hydrographic work on the Atlantic coast, and for the ,last 15 years there have been such operations to find and locate detached rocks and bowlders which are so small that they can not be found by ordinary methods of hydrography. Hundreds of such rocks, many of which were real menaces to navigation, have been found by this method. Many of them rocks are located in areas which had been surveyed carefully by means of lead and line, of which there w.as no previous indication prior to their detection by wire drag. Some had been loeated by vessels striking them, resulting in considerable damage to the vessels. For several year8 prior to and including the summer of 1919 two drag- parties operated each summer on the X ew England coast from northern Maine to Connecticut. This work was stopped in the fall of 19Hl and has not been. resumed since then because of lack of sufficient appropriation to carry on the work. All of the drag equipment, which includes six launches, remained idle from the close of the 1919 season until last summer, when half of the equipment was sent to Porto Rico, and the other half is still idle. Approximately 3,000 square miles of water area of the New ·England coast is yet to be dragged, of which a little over-1,200 square miles are in areas where there is much shipping. This area comprises five sections of the coast, as follows: Five hundred and forty square miles between the entrance to Penobscot Bav and the mouth of the Kennebec River, 120 square miles in the entrance to Portland Harbor, 156 square miles just south of Cape Elizabeth, 51 square miles close to the shore between Cape Porp01se and Piscataqua River, and 380 square miles between Pisca~·aqua River and Cape Ann. It is through these undrag~~~d areas that all vessels bound for Bath and Portland, Me., and ..Newburyport, .Mass., must pass. Besides these cities, there are numerous small ports and summer resorts which can be reached by water only through these undragged areas, and in addition most of the coastwise navigation along the southern Main~, New. Hampshire, and nortlwrn :MassaC'husetts coa~ts is through some part of these undragged areas. On the completion of these 1,200 square miles, which should be immediately dragged, the whole northern New England coast from Penobscot Bay to Cape Cod Bay will have been thoroughly explored, with the assurance that these waters contain no uncharted clangers to navigation. This project, w~ich is bel~eved to he one of those most urgently in need of immediate attent10n. should not be deferred until the :further loss of vessels nnd the 'lives 'of their passengers and crews attracts attention to this lack of adequate surveys.

topographic, State, boundary, and city surveyin~ and mapping. Be- / sides, these stations are used in much construct10n work, notably in { drainage and irrigation projects, railroad and highway extension, and flood control. It is most unfortunate that the very small appropriations for the i geodetic work have prevented the Coast and Geodetic Survey meet- . mg the urgent demands made upon it. It is true that Congress has i increased the annual appropriat10n for the control surveys over what i it was a few years ago. This is most commendable, but the engi- l neers of the country can not understand why control surveys are not now completed. After this work was added to the bureau's activities, it was felt that :funds would be Prrovided to push the work far more rapidly than has been the case. The question has been asked, What is the practical value of the control survey~ This inquiry is as pertinent as asking the practical value of the steel framework of a large office building. · ' The surveying and mapping of a large area such as the United States or Alaska simply can not be done properly without starting and check"ng points. ff a man's activities are confined to his own city or village, he needs only a local map; but suppose he must travel into surrounding areas, then he needs additional maps. Suppose he is connecting the drainage and sewerage systems of the city and the surrounding districts, then his maps must show very accurately the distances and dift'erence in elevation between points within the combined area in question. The several maps must be coordinated. Without accurate map data extens'.ve engineering work can not be done without great waste of money. The connection of the street system of a city with the State highway system necessitates an accurat.e knowledge of the pos"tions on the earth's surface and their elevations of many points in the area involved. If an extensive drninage project is undertaken, the engineer must first know the lay of the land or its configuration before he will begin constructing canals to drain the area. Many sim" lar cases could be noted to show the dependence of engineering projects on accurate survey and map data. . . Maps showing the location of an area and its configuration can not be made to conform to maps of the adjacent areas without having a single connected system of triangulation and also of leveling over the entire area. To-day there are many large areas in the United States where detailed surveying and mapp'ng are retarded owing to the lack of control data. This involves the retardation also of the industrial and commerc:al development within those areas. There are many cities to-day waiting for control surveys to be carried close to them in order that they may adopt modern methods in city planning and development. The extension of the triangulation system over the country will furnish the only reliable and unchangeable reference stations for the boundaries of the property of a State, city, county, corporation, or individual. With proper State, city, and private cadastral surveys based upon the control surveys made by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, mueh of the expensive litigation over property boundaries would be el".niinated. Even a casual consideration will convince anyone that almost every 'important human activity is dependent upon a knowledge of

These can only be supplied by surveys and maps, and these in turn must depend upon the fundamental control sur.veys made in our country and in Alaska by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. · .. The release of our country from debt depends upon our industry and ·commerce. . In many directions these are held back by a total· lack of knowledge of local conditions which alone can be supplied by the proper surveys and maps.

The layman unfamiliar with the seacoast usually thinks of the· land and sea as unchanging in their relation to each other, or, if he realizes that changes may be occurring; he thinks of them as measurable only in terms of geologic:periods. ·This, however, 'is very, far from bemg the truth.

The erosions of NantuC'ket Island, of the south shore of Long Island, or along the New Jersey coast, are striking examples of the power of the sea to degrade the shoves, while Cape· Cod and Sandy Hook are equally conspicuous instances of the opposite result of the conflict when the land has been able to take irom the sea· niateriai, with which to build up and expand itself. :' · From New York Harbor southward to and including the Gulf· coast the terrain adjacent to the shor~s com(:sts principally of a low fl.at or p:ently sloping plain. The .beaches are of sand, easily eroded; and subject to constant changes due to the action of the winds, waves, and currents. The ocean is engaged in a constant attack upon the , land adjacent, cutting it back and carrying away the resulting debris: The resistance of the shores depends upon the degre~ of .their ~x~.. posure oo the attacking forces and upon the-characte:r of the materials composing them. A coast such as I have described is particul&rly · su$ceptible tO attacks, and the changes produced are· constant n.nil comparatively rapid.

In some localities. indeed, the time for action has arrived. In March, 1922, the Board of Commerce and N avig-ntion of the Stnte of New Jersey requested the assistance of this bureau in a study to be made of the erosive action of the sea upon the beaches of the Ne·w Jersey coast-and of engineering measures .to be taken to prevent further damages. The situation of this stretch of the coast. was generally serious and in some localities critical. These beaches constitute one of the mostimportant assets of the State. They are the site of some of the best-known and most popular summer resorts. in the United States. · The assessed value of· the property along this narrow strip of sand, ·in some places only a fow hundred yards wide, exceeds $300,000,000. Practically all the most valuable improvements are immediately adjacent to the ocean·:front. Every year th,e gales do immense damage, nnd in some localities the situation has reached a stage to jeopardize the continued existence of the local commµnity. . . This office assured the hoard of commerce an:d navigation that it would be o'lad to cooperate in every possible :way both by giv~rtg' '.t.ne· boar'a. access to all smvey records· and by .placing at its disposal the knowledge and experienre of survey engineers and cartogrn.phers expert in the interpretation of the phenomena to he'. studied. After some preliminary discussion and a conference in New York the board requested the director to designate a representative to serve on an engineering advisory bonrd which' was to take charge of this investigation, whereupon the director designated the chief, division of charts, for that duty. · The vuri0us steps in un investigatfon o:f this character may be grouped under three headings: (1) Determine as nccumtely as possible the nature of the changes which are taking place along the shores. (2) Determine the nature of the forces· and the manner in which they: act to proq,uce the changes ascertained under the Rreceding heading. (3) Ffom a consideration of the two preceding il:ezns 4etermine ~pon the types of e~gineering structure best adapted to. oppose the act~on of the destructive forces. This office has :;undertaken the production of a composite map showing the shore line as determined by each of the topographic surveys made by the survey since the first one was undertaken in 1839. The map shows th~ results of four complete surveys of the coast line of the State with double that number at many of the localities where changes are most rapid. The ·picture which it thus affords of the evolution of the coast during the past. century, supplemented by additional data resulting from other local surveys by Federal, State, and ·municipal agencies, will enable the hoard to ?etermine with considerable accuracy the nature of the changes which have taken place during that period. At the reguest of t~e ?oard. !he Sl~rve:y repre~entat~Ye has undertaken to make a prehmmary mvestigation w}nch will be the first step in finding the answer to the second question. He will spend some time on the coast interviewing local engineers, keepers of lighthouses and Const Guard stations, and other persons havin~ detailed local knowledge. These men have observed the desfructive forces in action; they know the winds, the waves, and the currents, and

their effect upon the beach. The information which they furnish will be of material assistance in answering the second question and will assist the board in determining what further investigations are necessary to find the answer. . The State of New Jersey is the pioneer in this study. In so far as this office is aware this is the first time that a large-scale, exhaustive investigation of the subject has been undertaken in this country. The plans formulated by the State board give promise of a thorou~h study of the subject which will be of immense value to all agencies which must hereafter undertake beach protection. In cooperating, therefore, this office is serving not only the State of New Jerseyibut, potentially, every seaside community from the eastern end of ong Island to the Rio Grande River.
CURRENT .AND TIDAL DATA OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO NAVIGATORS.

Of increasing importance, the subject of currents is engaging the attention of this surv:ey, and it is devoting to the securmg of observations and data such funds as are appropriated and such time to the working up of this material and discussion of the results as an understaffed and underpaid personnel can spend. In coastwise navigation it is evident that currents play a very important role. Not only may millions be saved by making use of favorable, currents, but, more important still, when thick weather makes it impossible for the navigator to secure his position either by terrestrial landmarks or astronomical observations, it is a matter o:f the utmost importance that he know the currents to which his vessel may be SUbJeCt and which may, unknown to him, be <'arrying his valuable cargo of life and property to destruction by stranding on exposed coast lines. · PACIFIC C0As1· GonnENTs.-This is especially true in the case of the Pacific coast, where in the more than 1,000 miles of coast line from the Mexican border on the south to the Strait of Juan de Fuca on the north harbors are many miles apart, sailing courses long, and periods of thick weather o:f comparatively frequent occurrence. In the past 20 years more than 100 vessels have been stranded or wrecked on the Pacific coast of the United States, taking a toll of hundreds of human lives and millions in property, in spite of tb.e :fact that the navigators of the Pacific coast rank with et.he best in the world. It is unquestionable that an adequate knowledge of the currents would have prevented a considerable part of this enormous loss. Ari accurate knowledge of the coastal currents can be secured only by systematic observations, and while these involve the expenditure of money it is to be reme.mbered that a very small fraction of the money lost because of lack of this knowledge, not taking into consideration human life, would suffice :for all observations. The survey has already made use of all avenues for securing information at moderate cost. Advantage has been taken of the five light vessels stationed along the coast, and with a small e;xpenditure of funds valuable information has been secured. Thus, it has been discovered that, contrary to the general belief-that of the mariner included-a wind creates a. current, not in its own direction, but in direction which on the Pacific coast is from 15° to 20° to the right of the wind direction. In other words, a wind blowing from the

a

REPORT OF DIR1WTOR, COAST AND GJ~ODETIC SURVEY.

south parallel to the coast will not create a current parallel to the coast, but one setting about 15° toward the coast-a fact, until brought out by these current observations, unknown to the mariner. . There is now needed a systematic study of the currents between the light vessels, for these are so far apart on that coast as to give no clue to the currents that may be running in the long stretches between them. A modest ap~ropriation that will permit the carrying into effect of plans outlined for a systematic survey of these currents will be a long step toward the ~afeguarding of life and property on vessels enl;,aged in commerce along the Pacific coast. :NEw YonK HARBOR CuRRENTs.-The waterways which lead to the principal port of the United States exhibit the most complicated current and tidal phenomena of any of the important ports of the world. Many ports nre situated in tidal rivers, others on bays or sounds connected with the sea; but in New York Harbor werhave an intercommunicating system of tidal waterways made up of three bays, four straits, a tidal river, and a sound. The resulting current and tidal phenomena are exceedingly complex, and in the case of Hell Gate the currents are of such velocity that advance ki1owledge of the times of slack current is a matter of utmost practical importance. Congress during the past year realized the fact that this port, which is one of the greatest in the world, had not vet had a systematic current survey, and this in spite of the fact that many millioHs have been expended by the Federal Government in improving those waterways. The docking of large vessels costing millions and carrying valuable cargo should without question have the advantage of the best obtainable knowledge, for here a matter of minutes is of importance. Fortunately, Congress has made this modest appropriation and with the cooperation of the U. S. Engineers Office, first district, New York, a carefully planned and efficient survey is to be made of this harbor during the fiscal year 1923, which will make :it possible to predict in advance the exact time of the turning of the c1.1rrents m the various portions of the harbor. This will be of the y:reatest importance in the handling and docking of large vessels. ln addition this current survey will at the same time bring out facts of importance in the economical solution of the pressing sewage problems involved in the location of 1t city of many millions of inhabitants. 8uch information will be secured at no additional cost. 'Vhnt is being done in J\ ew York will be necessary to do in our ' other important harbors. On the west coast there is need of a similar survey in 8an Francisco Harbor. It is important to note ~hat it will be by far the most economical procedure to do this work in a systematic mariner, taking up each year that port in greatest need of such a survey, and which can at the same time be most economically caITied out with reference to floating equipment and personnel; Such a systematic' procedure permits the best use of an expert organization for the carrying out of the highly technical work invol_ved; The importance of this work to our growing merchant marine, as. well as to our Navy, demands that it be carried out for the more important ports of our country. TmEs.-With the growth of population and the increase of indus" tries along our C'ousts, the importance of a thorough knowledge of

the tides-their characteristic», times of occurrence, effects of winds and unusual weather conditions. tbe effec~s of deepening of channels and gcneml harbor improvement-is becoming a matter of the greatest practical necessity. Originally the tidal work of this survev was that 1wcessarv in connection with the charting of the coa~tal waters; but with the increased drafts of vessels engaged in commerce the necessity for un advance lmowledge of the times and heights of high and low waters at the more important ports is apparent. The survey 011 very meager appropriations has met the needs of the mariner, developing new methods of studying the complicated J)roblem of the tides, and <leYising a machine for predict.ing the ti. es yeurs in advance, so that this important work-important both for the Navy and merchunt marine-is clone in n most economical manner. The subject of tides is now becoming of importance in coast protection and in harbor improvement. As our coai;tal lamh; are becoming more vuluable, we can· no longer allow the encroachment of the sea through the action of ·tides and waves. In this conne~·tion the effect of winds nnd unusual weather on the· height of the tide is an importan~. factor-a problem the surrny is studying,· but which the enormous increase of work in connection with its regular duties and the shortage of trained personnel prevents it from attacking. in the most efficient manner. . With the iml>ortancc of an ~meri~un merchant marine fully ~·e?og mzed, harbor improvements iilvolvmg an outlay of many millions annually are being prosecuted. In a number o~ cases a knowledge: of the action of the tides subsequent to such improvement is wanting, and when the engineer turns to this survey for information in specilic cases-for this bureau is the only agency in the United 8tates that deals with tidal matters-we can generally furnish him· valuable information, but. in some cases are unable to furnish the exact data because appropriat10ns nre so small as not to permit a study of the matter to be made; and there can be no question that because of this some part of the appropriations s1wnt on harbor improvements does not bring the maximum benefits~ while a fraction of this would permit the surn~y to secure information of n\lne for all time. ln one other direction the tides are of great practical importance. The question as to the rising and sinking of the coast-a mattPr not only of local but also of national importance-can be determined only by means of tidal observations. Fortunately, the survey has been able to so conduct the tidal work that this information is being secured without additional cost.

<I·:AHTBQFAKJ-:1 INY}::...<;TIGATIONS :\1EAN SAFETY OF :\IANY PEOPJ,E.

Durin" the last century six major earthquakes have occurred in the United States, .\laska, and the insular posessions, some causing ~reat loss of life and property. Two of these, that at Charleston m 188G and that in the upper Mississippi Valley in 1811, then scarcely iphahitecl but now densely populated, were in regions not generally , consi<fore<l to he subject to earthquakes. Minor earthquakes have oec'.lllTed recently in Utah, Nevada, 'Vashington, and New Brunswick. Canada, inc1icating that this is 11 live subject and one of wi<lesprenll interest. Earth9uakes are of special importimce in California, ancl this bureau )is now cooperating by means of precipe sur,·e,vs to determine mo\'ements of the surface, with the Carnegie Institution and other orgunizntious in an investigation which may make possible earthquake predictions and at least designate areas where special preeantions in eonstructiion shoul<l be used and regions _ ,where important construction should he. avoided. In order to study earthquakes, instruments known as seismographs must be operated nt fi,xed observatories. They should be of the highe&t type, continuously operated by the most skilled observers. in order tlrnt.Jhe earthquake re.cords may be correctly interpreted. Thi~ bureau hns operated seismogr11phs at five widely separated stat10ns for 18 years, bu~ as. the work has been supplemental to m11g1wtie work th<' stntions .htl\'e not been of high class. Se!:smolo,!tical ·inwstigution has been assigned to the 'Veather ,Bureau. \Vith the developm~i;i.t pf instruments of the highest accuraey it has be~n found that the obse~·vers of that bure11u <lo not have the type of skill r~nirecl .t? g.et the best re~11lts. S11ch skill comes !rom the op~ration of magnetic rnstrnnwnts, and t4erefore the operation of such mstruments by the Const antl. Geodetic Suryey presents no difficult problem. It is proposed to eqmp the magnetic observatories at Tucson, Ariz., nnd Sitkn Alaska, ns first-class stations with new instruments of high grude. thus making them first-class seismological stations, These are selected as being in relntiYely quiet regions near to regions of _great activitv in the present or recent past.

fornia and Japan positions and elevations are found to shift during earthquakes. This may occur elsewhere, and with an accuracy ~o 0.1 foot in determinations a ver:y small shift :would caus~ trouble m future surveys. Such observat10ns would give useful mformation about the interior of the earth and would enable us to leurn more about processes of mountain building and submergence of land. In the past the outstanding work has been done by England, Russia, and Germany, and this country has done little first-grade work.
NEED 01" CLOSER COOl'l':HATION WITH LOCAL ENGINEERS AND SURVEYORS.

This bureau has been in operation for more than 100 years. Due to the admirable geodetic control devised by Hassler and ado~ted by Congress under the administration of ,Jefferson 1 triangulat10n sta~ tions established in 1822 are, with few exrept10ns, as serviceable for points of control in making land surveys in 1922 as when fir~t determined. . Primarily, geodetic control points, including precise level bench marks, were established to form the basis for surveying projects covering large areas of the country, but the neec;ls of these large projects have necessitated the extension of the friangu~~tion ·and precise level nets to such an extent that there is now a splendid opportunity for local engineers and surveyors (county surveyors~ highway engineers, city eno'ineers, etc.) to base their local surveys on these standard data which are permanently fixed with relation to ull other standard points of control throughout the country. The advantages are obvious. and nee¢! but' little 'exposition. Land surveyors and city engineers who are culled upon to reestablish old boundary lines frequently have great difficulty in finding and identifying oid bouridary monuments, such as stones, stumps, or trees: Sometimes the surveys of adj ucent counties are each based on arbiJ;rarily selected ~ontrol poi~ts, ~nd when these surveys are carried to the lioundary hne of the counties overlaps or gaps are developed.· In many cases it is very difficult to trace out an old compass survey because the re:.'.ord does not show the declination of the compass at ·.~he time the original survey was made. These difficulties are not _met if the surveys are based on standard geodetic control and are therefore in harmony with other control points throughout the country. A lamentable fact that has been brought to light by our efforts to assist local engineers and surveyors is that so few of these ari:I aware of the existence of our triangulation stations, magnetic sta~ tions, and precise level bench marks in their locality. Time and again it has come to the notice of this bureau that municipalities originally separate and distinnt hut which have later merged into a city have based their original surveys on control points that were not in harmony, and it has cost a great deal of time and money to bring such surveys into proper adjustment. These adjustments would have been unnecessary if the original surveys had bren based on standard· data. It is this consideration that has stimulated the effort being made by this bureau to induce all land s1Jrveyors and civil engineers to adopt ·standard control points and elevations in making surveys in the future. Our country is growing rapidly, and if surveys as now made are based on erroneous or poorly selected

data· the error will be augmented as our population increases and other surveys are based on the same erroneous data, until finally it will be ne(·essary to make a costly readjustment of all these surveys. In an endeavor to correct this situation special effort has been Iirn<le to bring to the attention of eivil engineers, city engineers, and surveyors the standard data available in this bureau. Three mediums have been used: (1) Digests are being prepared, one for each State in the Union. In these digests the counties in the State are listed in alphabetical order and under each county are shown the stations established in the county with direct reference to the publications of the bureau containing the ,results. Each digest. is aceompanied by a base map of the State showing graphically .the kind of surve~·s made in the State and where made. (See illustration No. 2, opposite p. 18.) (2) A circular has been prepared pointing out the advnntages of using standard data in making land surveys. This circular contains a base map of the United States showing the extent and nature of the surveys by this bureau throughout the country. (:1) A canvass is being made of county surveyors throughout the United States calling their attention to the need of having accurate information as to the declination of the magnetic. needle for both the date when the original compass surveys were made and also for the date when the resurvey is made. · . · These efforts have brought forth gratifying results. Letter after letter has been received commending our efforts in bringing to the attention of local engineers and surveyors the data available in this bureau and in encouraging the use -of standard data on which to base surveys throughout the country. It is believed that there is a still wid.er field: of service for the bureau in this connection and an oppor~ tumty for:inuch closer cooperation bet,veen those in need of standard data and those in this bureau who have specialized in certain classes of land surveys.;, This cooperation will be undertaken in the near future.

information pertaining to areas where sites for proposed industries have been newly selected. In the past scattering surveys have been made in the strenuous effort to meet the needs of commerce, but the indtistries have far outstripped the progr<>ss of these surveys, wholly through lack of sufficient personnel and equipment with. whEch to keep pace. One of the most urgent present demands is for a further extension of the much-needed wire-drag surveys. These should be pushed with all possible haste, as in the deep, fiordlike channels of southeastern Alaska a survey by this method is the only means of insuring that all dangers have been located. The hydrographic and topographic surveys commeneed in 1917 from Dixon Entrance along the outer coast have been extended northward to Noyes Island. The largest survey vessel operated by the Coast and Geodetic Survey is now engaged in extend!~ng this work northward toward Sitka. This work not only includes a detailed survey of the shore line but depths are obtained from the beach to the 1,000-fathom curve. The locations of fishing banks in this vidinity are obtained on these sounding lines. Three vessels ha:ve recentlv been transferred t-0 the Coast and Geodetic Survey by the N aYy ·Department. These vessels were built for mine-sweeping duty by the Navy and will be altered to mnke them suitable fo11 surveying work. They will take the place of two vessels of the service already condemned and sold and one other which will be disposed of this winter. These new vessels, on ac~ count of their size, power, and seaworthiness, will help materially lin expediting the charting of the open waters of western Alaska. Surveys are much needed for the development of the oil fields in this locality. There should be a revision made of Cook Inlet north of Fire Island, where great changes have oc,curred since the last surveys were made. Jn addition there are surveys needed in Prince William Sound and of the outside coasts"from Latouche a.nd Montague Islands westward to Seward. For some time one of the most urgent needs in Alaska surveys has been a system of control which would connect and coordinate the scattered hydrographic, topographic, and cadastral surveys of the Terriitory. Such control surveys were especially needed in prepa.ringnavigating charts of coastal Alaska and in placing upon a proper datum the many scattered surveys in the interior river valleys. The report of the Governor of Alaska for 1921 mentioned the proposed extension, in cooperation with Canada, of an arc of precise triangulation from Puget Sound through British Columbia, southeast Alaska, and Yukon territory t-0 the Yukon River at Ragle. The United States will then extend the work down the Yukon to Fairbanks, where it will eventually meet another arc which is being extended northward from the head of Cook Inlet toward the upper Yukon. A speedy linking up of these two sections is to be hoped for. Had such control been available HS years ugo 1 much time and money could have been saved in surveys made c'lurmi.r that oerio<l, and the development of the interior region of Alaska would have been hastened, for many Federal surveying operations have been postponed for lack of such control. Extem.:ions of this single arc of triangulation are also needed badly. One branch should extend from Fairbanks to Valdez, along

21

the route of the stage road, with 1~ spur to connect to the AlaskaCanada boundary near the upper wnters of the Tanunn. Another should extend from Fairbanks down the Yukon to Norton Sound. It is to be hoped that these main routes C'nn be spanned by co11trol surveys ns rapidly as possible. Of only slightly less importance to interior surveys is the line of precise levels which the Const and Geodetic Survey began in the spring of 1922 and which will be extended as rapidly us possible to Fairba11ks and from there along the stn~e routes to Valdez. l . . ines from Fairbanks to Eagle and from Fairbanks to Nome are also promised as soon as the funds for such w<)rk will permit them to be run. These lernls will furnish basic elevations for a large area, which will he of great assistance to local industrial surveys. The importance of current data can not be overestimated, and the situation is not yet satisfactory. It is essential to note that while a knowled~e of the behavior of the currents is in all waters a mat~ ter of prime importance in the s11feguar<ling of navigation in Alaskan waters it is doubly so, for in Alaskan waters in many cases deep water extends to within a few feet of the shore, and soundings are therefore of comparatively little value to the navigator in apprising him of the imminence of danger. In thick weather, therefore, when the navi~ator can not determine his position by lights or other landmarks, 1t is a matter of the utmost importance that he know the velocity and direction of the currents to which.his vessel may be subject and which may, unknown to him, be carrying his valuable .car(J'o of life and property to destruction. Carried on by itself a current survey entails considerable expense. Fortunately, however, in connection with other hydrographic work, current observations may be made at comparatively ~mall cost, and the Coast and Geodetic Suryey is now working out a plan which will permit a smnll party to make current observations in connection with each of the surveying vessels operating in Alaskan waters. During the past fiscal year the magnetic declination was deter.mined at a lurge number of triangulation stations in southeastern Alaska, an<l the area of local disturbance about Port Snettisham was examined in detail. Here observations on board ship showed that even in mid-channel the effect on the compass was sufficient to endanger a vessel passing through in thick weather. A similar survey was made of the area of local disturbance near Haines in the main channel to Skagway. Though mariners have been aware of this source of danger and have made allowance for it, this is the first time that an accurate survey has been made. These observations will be extended to other areas where the presence of local disturbance is indicated. Magnetic observations are also needed along the northern and western shores of Alaska. and in the interior. During the past year observations were made along the Bering Sea coast of Alaska and Siberia and along the Arctic coast of Alaska at St. Michael, Nome, Teller City, Point Hope, Point Barrow, and Demarcation Point, in Alaska, and nt Emma Ihrbor (Providence Bay) and Whelen (East Cape) in Siberia. This work had gren.t value for two reasons: It connected the magnetic work of the Amundsen expedition with previous magnetic work jn Alaska, and it provided values of the magnet~ qeclination in Alaska at places where our previous

22

knowledge was very indefinite, and accordingly makes it possible to provide more accurate maglrntic information on the charts of Bering Seu and the Arctic. Correct magnetic values are of great importance because at best, owing to the nearness to the magnetic pole, the compass is far more uncertain than in southern regions. The results brought out, however, the great need of a real magnetic survey in the interior of Alaska. The present situation of magnetic stations, ex'stinlY only along the main lines of travel, leaves vast ureas without ob:::ervations of any kind. Observations are needed also in the Aleutian Islands to meet the needs of the commerce from the west coast to the ·orient. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has maintained an observatory at Sitka since 1902. Observations of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity have been made sin· e that time without a sinp;le break in their continuity. The disturbances known as magnetic storms which affect the direction 11nd intensity of the magnetic elements occur with great frerpiency in Alaska. These storms are apparently related to unusual difficulties in submarine cable transmission and also to operation of radio stations.

CHAPTER III.
PURCHASE OF DUTCH HARBOR, ALEUTIAN ISLANDS, AS A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FUEL AND SUPPLY BASE. .

Nine years ago I strongly recommended in a special report that the Federal Government purchase from the North American Com. mercial Co. their prope1ty at Dutch Harbor, Aleutian Islands Alaska, as a fuel un<l supply base. In subsequent reports I reiterated my recommendation, bu~ to date no action has b.een taken. There is stronger argument now than ever before for again advocating the purchase of this property for a Federal Government base. Under present conditions temporary or permanent headquarters for ·Government vessels must be. at Unalas!;.a, close to Dutch Harbor, and there is hardly an argument in favor oi the continuation of this arrungement. The harbor at Unalaska is a poor one, and the means of reaching it is through a nurrow channel which is more or less dangerous even to small vessels. 'fhe Government has already paid many thousands of dollars to private companies for coal transported from Australia, Canada, and other places, and in addition has paid for various privileges in connection with docking where private interests are involved. There is a very poor supply of :fresh water at Unalaska, and the buildings for storage are entirely inadequate. Commerce is increasing and the activities in western Alaska are marked, so that it is good business, especially from the point of view of economy, to look for a permanent Federal supply base. · Dutch Harbor, which is an abandoned village of the North American Commercial Co., seems clearly to be the outstanding and logical place for the Federal Government to acquire. The only wireless station in the section is located close to this village and affords easy means of commun·cation. The harbor is excellent, has additional room for modern wharves, and has a liberal supply of fresh water. While the buildings of the company are rather old, no doubt many of them can be restored to fairly good condition. Tl1ere are coal yards and trackage for handling coal and bins already built. The Department of Commerce would be materially helped by having such a Government station in this more or less isolated section of Alaska, as its maritime bureaus would find it of tzrent benefit. In addition to having a place to take on coal and oil fuel, as well as water and other supplies, conditions are such that without a great outlay of money certain repairs to vessels could be undertaken. The · Bureau of Fisheries, with its important interests in and almost year-round contact with the Pribilof Islands, would find snch a base of great help in expediting the moving of suppl"es to the islllnds and br'nging back sealskins and other furs. The Lighthouse Bureau and the Coast and Geodetic Survey, both of which nre t·nga,ged in important work in the Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea, and waters adjacent to the Aleutian Islands, would find this supply and fuel base
23

24

of great assistance in expedit;ng their work. But this is not all. The Navy Department, with vessels moving back and forth between the Orient and western waters, could no doubt use this OoYernment base to advantage, as could also the Coast Guard of the Treasury Department, which has vessels carrying on patrol duty in the wafors adjacent to Dutch Harbor dur:ng a number of months of each year. The Government vessels in the past have managed to get along in an uncertain and at times expensive way, but if this property wern acquired they would immediately feel the beneficial effects of the purchase. Many tons of fuel are used by Government rnssels in this section, including both coal and oil, the latter coming into more general use each year, and the prices that have beei1 charged by private-owned companies have been out of all reason. 'Vith the opening of the coal and oil fields in Alaskat.3hipments could be made frequently and at small cost to Dutch Harbor, so as to insure an adequate and cheap sup_ply to Government vessels the year round. I recommend that consideration be given to this matter, as it is a long step toward conducting the operations of the vessels of the Department of Commerce and other departments of the Government in a more economical and businesslike manner.

CHAPTEH IV.
CENTRAL BUREAU OF INFORMATION IN WASHINGTON NEEDED.

One of the best ways to sen·e the people of the country wl)o come to 'Vnshin~ton to husines$ with the Federal GoYerpment is to direct them to the department, commi1:'.'"iion, or burenu where their business calls tlwm. and the agenC'y by which this service can best be renclt·rec1 is a central burenn of {nformation. One important consideration inn1ln·cl in this suggestion is the fu<'t that when,: as too often happens, these people ure mis<lirectcd, they waste not only, their own time lmt that of oftichils and emplovees of the Govern-. nicnt. In the aggregate many working hours~ ~imounting during the year to weeks un<l months for almost any one of the Federal Lmrcam;, is unneeessnrily <lernted to ascertaining for these. Yisitors. just wlwre they can best transact their business. . It is dearly eYiclent t hut the most cffieilwt uncl economical way to obYinte this situation is to establish a bureau as suggested above, where everyone who desires <lefinite information from the Government cuu either stwure it at once or else be <lirectetl to the proper department or lnu·eau where the Jesired information cun be obtained readily nnd quickly.

Part II.-THE WASHINGTON OFFICE.

CHAPTER I.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE WASHINGTON OFFICE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR

The organization of the Washington office of the bureau is presented by the organization chart 0P'2osite. The accomplishments during the .fiscal year by divisions and sections follow. ·
CHIEF CLERK.

The principal duties o:f this division are the care., custody, and upkeep of the buildings occupied by the bureau; tl:le supervision of the expenditures from the appropriation for office expenses, including the purchase of supplies for the office, for chart printing work, and to some extent for the field; the care and custody of most of the original records of the field surveys, as well as the library of printed publications kept for the use of the bureau; the general supervision of all matters relating to the personnel work of the bureau,. including reports of leaves of absence taken; the custody and accounting for the receipts from the sale of charts and publications, etc.; and the direction of the engineer, electrician, watch, messenger, and labor forces of the bureau, and other employees whose duty has to do with the care and prote.tion of the buildings. The more important accomplishments during the year have beert a continuation of the plan to make a thorough renovation of the buildings occupied by the bureau. This work is still in progress. During the fiscal year 30 rooms, the walls of 4 stairways, and 1 hall were painted, involving a total of 39,753 square feet, and linoleum was laid on the floors of 15 rooms and 3 halls, a total of 654 square yards. · Previous to the fiscal year for which this report is made, drinking water was supplied in practically all of the building3 occupied by the bureau by the inverted bottle type of cooler. In the rPalization that a great deal of time of messengers and laborers :was consumed in cleaning, icing, and filling the water bottles of this type of cooler, an effort was made to install a more sanitary cooler and one that required less care to keep in working order. Accordingly a stack of drinking fountains supplying five different floor,~ 1n one building was installed) cold water being piped from a single large cooler. This has elimmated considerable of the work formerly performed in keeping the inverted bottle type of water cooler in operation, but has led to the conclusion that a more economical and satisfactory method is the installation of au ammonia cooling plant to supply drinking water to the seven different buildings occupied by the bureau. At the end of the fiscal )'car negotiations were un<lcr way for the procurement of a satisfactory water-cooling plant. During the year the changes necessary 'were completed whereby the bureau obtains electric current and steam necessary for heating the buildings from the Capitol power plant. In this installation many improvements and adjustments have been made that render the

heating system in the buildings much more satisfactory than in the past. During the year the front and side walls of the portion of the Richards Building adjoining New Jersey Avenue, and the side wall of the south Butler Building were painted; also, all-metal library shelving was installed in rooms 340 and 347. · The cost of care, maintenance, upkeep, and operation of the buildings occupied by the bureau has been reduced from 29 cents per square foot for the fiscal yenr Hl21 to a little less than 26 cents per square foot for the fiscal year 1922. In the office of the chief clerk the preparation of digests· of the geodetic publications of the bureau has continued. By the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1921, digests had been prepared and published for 8 States, and at the close of the fiscal year for which this report is made, such digests had been published for 21 States. That these digests fill a need is attested by numerous letters from civil engineers, surveyors, and others expressing appreciation that the information has been brought to their notice. In the library and archives 52 hydrographic and 98 topographic sheets, each representing new surveys made by the bureau, were received. Other additions to the library and archives were blue prints (mostly showing results of surveys by Army engineers), 518; maps, 2,347; eharts, 2,898; field, office, and observatory records, 5,784. During the year the expenditure from the appropriation for general expenses of the bureau was $101,585.26. · The total number of permanent and temp<>rary officers and employees in the office and field force, which mcludes the commissioned ?fficers and all employees appointed through civil-service certification, is, office force, 224; field force, 163; total, 387. These figures do not include persons engaged as rodmen, chainmen~ heliotropers, and others, in the field parties, nor any enlisted men on vessels of the bureau. The statistics in regard to leaves of absence during the calendar year are us follows: Annual leave, 8,448 days; sick leave, 1,845; without-pay leave, 1,682; an<l accrued leave, 1,888. 'Vhile the number of employees naturally varied on account of resignations and vacancies, caiculated on the number actually in the service on June 30, 1922, as a basis of computation, the average annual leave taken durin:z the ~·ear by each employee was approximately 26.7 days and sick leave 4.8 days. , The receipts from the sale of charts, publ~cations, etc., amounted to $41,689.14.
DIVISION OF HYDHOGHAPHY

TOPOGRAPHY.

This division is composed of the sections of field work, vessels and equipment, and eoast pilot, each under the immediate supervision of a section chief and all under the direction of the chief of the division. The section of field work has supervision over all hydrograph1c and topographic surveys, plans the work to be accompll.shed by the · field parties, prepares instructions for the chiefs of parties, and keeps track 0£ the progress of their field work. The principal accomplish-

28

ment of the section during the fiscal yeur has been the preparation of a f'omprchensive plan for expediting the survey of those parts of. the United States waters as yet unsurveyed and for making resurveys and supplementary surveys whe.re required. In the spring of 1921, the sec:t1on beg-an a comprehensive study of the needs for surveys of the waters of·continental 1Jnited States, Alaska, Hawaii, and the West ~ndies: and resulting from this study, a progr~m was adopted tlus year by which all hydrographic and topograpluc work will be carried on more systematlcally~ and new work will he taken up succcssiYely in the order of its importance and the need f.or new and better chnrts. This coordination of effo1;t should result in a greater annual accomplishment of field work and, therefore, a reduction in the unit cost of work. A serondarv accol!lplishment of the section was the preparation of a new Plane Table M'<l.nual which is now in the hands of the printer. The section of vessels and equipment has supervision over the floating equipment of the bureau and over the personnel employed in connection wlith the operation of that equipment. During the fiscal year the section preparetI plans and specifications for rC'conditioning two vessels transferred to the bureau from the Navy, and directed the work of com·Prting these vessPls, which were constructed for mine sweeping, to surveying vessels. The section also designed a new type of deep-sea sounding machine, three of which were in use this summer. These activities were carrieu on in addition to the usual work of maintaining in effiqient operating condition the vessels and other floating equipment of the bureau. The coast pilot section puulished the Fnite<l States Coast Pilot of the 'Vest Indies, second edition, field work for which was done during the previous fiscal vear; the fifth edition of the Inside Route Pilot, New York to Key 'West, from field work performed partl¥ in this fiscal year and partly in the last; an<l prepared the manuscript for the United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic coast, Section D, Cape Henry to Key ''Test, from field work also performed partly in this and partly in the last fiscal year.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Along the Ninety-eighth Meridian, Kansas-Oklahoma Boundary to Alice, Tex., have been sent to the printer. The manuscript for several other publications is in course of preparation, two of these being nearly ready for the printer, namely£ Instructions for Reconnaissance and 1Signal Building and Use o Geodetic Control for City Surveying. The two special problems, a study of the movements of the earth's crust in the earthquake region of California and a study of the earth's dynamics in connection with the Stokes theorem, which were carried on last year, were continnecl during the year. . The average force during the year "·as 18 persons. This number includes the field officers when engaged on office computationsr although most of the time of these men was spent on fielcl work.
DIVISION OF CHARTS.

During the year the division has worked with three objects in mind: (1) To keep the charts in print and to keep them corrected promptly for all new information received; (2) to complete the program of new chart production and of.chart reconstruction adopted at the beginning of the year; (3) to seek further improvements in the mechanical processes involved in chart production and thus effect a reduction in the labor necessary to effect that end. (1) CORRECTION OF Ex1STING CHARTS.-lt is the policy of the bureau that this task shall take precedence over all others. The charts must be kept in print; they must be printed in small editions in order that frequent reprints will enable us to apply corrections reaching the office from time to tim~, and whenever information of importance is received all charts affected must be reprinted immediately, and all existing prior copies, either in this office or in the hands of our agents, must be destroyed. This policy has been strictly adhered to. Back orders have been kept at a minimum, and the few charts that have been back ordered have been printed promptly thereafter. The program for 1922 called for the production of 24 new charts or maps, and the reconstruction of 10 existing charts to make them conform to the present standards that all charts shall be .on the Mercator projection, oriented with the meridan and with all soundings in a single unit for each chart. The program was adopted June 1, 1921, and called for the completion of the last chart listed by August, 1922. The division's accomplishments during the year exceeded in both amount and speed that contemplated in the program. . (a) By reason of a suddenly awakened interest in the North Pacific Ocean resulting from the Conference on Limitation of Armament, a map of that ocean was added to the program in September and rushed to completion. (b) The program as originally adopted was to be completed in August. The last chart on the program was delivered from the press on June 27. The following table compares this new chart production with similar work during the recent past:

The successful completion of this program confirms the conclusion reached last year that the adoption of such a program results both in expediting the completion of new chart work and in the accomplishment of a greater amount of such work in a given time. To summarize the present situation, the division of charts has temporarilv caught up with the field work to the extent that we have comp.lete or in hand all new charts for which adequate data are available or in sight. The Atlantic coast as far south as the Cape Fear River is now adequately charted except that various local areas along the New England coast require additional surveys to replace work of doubtful value done many years ago, upon which our charts are at present based. I haye said that we have temporarily caught up. As soon as the primary triangulation through southeast Alaska is completed and adjusted, the chart division must take up practically the complete reconstruction of the charts in the area reached by the adjustment. This is an exceedingly difficult task which will take years to complete. Because of the crudeness of the original work, which must ~ow be distorted to fit the new triangulation, it will take fully three t.1mes as long to complete the average Alaska chart as is required for the average chart of the United States coast. Because of the magnitude of this task, the work which we und~rtake this time should be final. Hereafter when we produce one of t~ese new ~harts we do not want that portion of it which is imrnechately adJacen_t to the new triangulation to be correct, while more remote port101;1s are still on the old erroneous datums. For that reason the pohcy will be to undertake the reconstruction of only those chart~ which are controlled by adjusted triangulation. , On the Atlant1~ ~~ast south of the Cape Fear River and on the hulf coast the d1vis10n of charts can not take up the production of further new charts until ad~itional field work has been completed. In other words, I do not thmk we should publish as new charts which are actually constructed from surveys made many years ago-in many cases prior to the Civil ,;var-and which we know are no longer correct. ~he situation in the Virgin Islands is similar to that just described. We have published one general chart of the islands, using top?graphy from our own recent surveys, and hydrography from Umte~ States Hydrographic Office and British Admiralty charts. A s:res of three topographic maps covering the islands is now in han · We have no hydrography adequate for the production of large-seal~ charts, so such additional harbor charts as are required must. await the completion of hydrographic and wire-drag surveys now m progress. On the ~a~i~c coast of the United States the remaining task for the chart divlSlon consists principally in the application to existing charts of the general hydrograph1c survey now in progress.

IMPHOYK'.l.IEXTS EFFECTFm IN METHOD OF Comn~c'l'INn ENGHAVEI> PLATES.-In the past it has been recognized that certain technical processes long inherent in the engraving method were time consuming and laborious, and that if these processes could be improved the result would be of material benefit. The permanence of the engraved plate is one of the strong points commending its nse. This very permanence has, however, also a disadvantag-e, as it renders correction difficult. A practical means of ove'rcommg, or at least greatly m)inimizing, this diffic·ulty has been devised during the year, and the required apparatus is nmY being constructed. By reverting to the alto and scraping changed areas, correctiom; ha Ye always been possible by making a nPw basso. This. however. is a time-consuming process. Also, small areas ha n·. in the past. been corrected by scraping out the work and leveling with a hammer on a special anvil. This is likewise a slow process. Our first undertaking was, therefore, to seek a readier means of making corrections on copper. , After careful study, appeal was made to the Director, Bureau of Standards. who detailed to the study of the problem a chemist, W. E. Bailey. Mr. Bailey, in his experiments, had the cooperation of the engraving and electrotype sections of this bureau. These experiments led to the adoption of an interes~ing, and it is believed novel, adaptation of the galvanoplastic method of electrotyping, by means of which it is possible to remove quickly small or large areas from the surface of the plate to the depth of the engraved work. , An electrode is inserted in the nozzle of a hose through which a solution of copper sulphate is thrown under pressure against the plate on the area where the correction fa to be made. An efectrlic circuit from a generating source is formed between the plate and the . electrode in the nozzle, through the stream of solution impinging on the plate. A current pressure of from 12 to 15 volts has been found satisfactory. This voltage is far in excess of pressure ordinarily used in depositing copper, and the action is very rapid. By making the plate the positive electrode, copper is rem"oved from 1t to any desired depth. The cut portions of the plate are not affected since they are filled with ink or any nonconducting substance. By this erasing method a depression as deep as the eng-ra ved lines tis made. By the use of a hammer on the back of the plate the d(\pressed area may be leveled with the surface and, after polishing. the plate is ready for the application of new work. Although the solution after striking the plate flows over it, the only point affected is that against which the stream is directed. Small areas of the surface are quickly removed as the engraved lines are not cut deeply. The removal of about one twenty-fifth of the thidmess of the plate usually erases all work likely to need correction. Aftrr thlis depressi?n is ~ransferred to the back of the plat.e by bumping up, it may, if desired, be filled in on the back by usmg the same process with the' direction of the current reversed. As indicated above, the electrolytic action is rapid. An area about 2 inches square can be removed from a plate to the depth of the engraving \in six minutes.

The previous activities of the division were expanded to some extent during the year and additional activities were taken up. The work js now divided under the :following heads: Computation of field and observatory results and preparation £or publication, whether in book form or as charts; distribution of information to the public on request; also systematic efforts to inform users of magnetic data that valuable information is available. Research and experiment with the special purpose of improvement of instruments. Training of observers. Seismology. Because of various special investigations, the assignment of one computer to field duty for nearly four months, and because the demand for information had gTeatly increased, the output of routine work was slightly less than last year. Demand for information in regard to magnetic stations, the values of the magnetic elements, especially declination, has increasecl steadily throughout the year, the increase being due chiefly to the use and distribution of digests of geodetic publications for a· number of States; these are issued to engineers of each State an<l usually requests begin to arrive from that State in increased numbers. · The Cheltenham Observatory results ·for 1917-18 were prepared for publication and printed. Those for 191n-20 were computed and prepared for publication. The l~orto Rico Observatory results for 1917-18 were computed, prepared for publication, and printed. The computation of the 1919 results was nearly completed and work on the 1920 results was begun. The Honolulu Observatory results for 1919..;.20 were computed, prepared for publication, and sent to the printer. The Sitka Observatory results for 1919 were computed, and those for 1920 were nearly finished. The Tucson 9bs.ervatory results for 1919 were about half computed a1;d ~ begmnmg was matle on those for 1920. Observat10ns at .field stations and comparison of field instruments at the observatories were computed as soon as the records were received and the results for the year 1921 were prepared for publi('ation and sent to the printer. · The earthquakes recorderl at the five magnetic observatories were tabulated month by month as the records were received and the results were sent to the Monthly \¥ enther Review for publication. Proof was read of the following publications: Directions for Magnetic Measurements, seeon<1 ecljtion; Porto Rico Observatorv Results, 1917-18; Clrnlte1;hmn. Observatory Results, 1917-18; ancl Results of Field Observations m 1921. The secular change data secured since 1915 were tabulated, the ~eculai; change tables were revjsed ancl brought np to 1920, and a new 1sogomc c?art of the United States, showing the lines of equal magnetic declmation and 0£ equal annual change for January 1, 1920, was prepared. A new publiration to contain this chart and the secular change tables and also directions for determinino- the true meridian, was nearly ~ompleted. This is intended primarily for the use of .surveJ:ors who have occasion to work with a compass. An 1sogomc chart of the Philippine Islands 1920 was prepared for use of the Manila suboffice.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

It is realized that the chief output of the division which has economic value is the value of the magnetic declination, which is useful to local surveyors who use magnetic instruments, especially county surveyors. This division prepared a pamphlet and several special forms, the chief purpose being to call the attention of county surveyors and others to the need of more care in making magnetic surveys, especially in obtaining compass correction at magnetic stations. The forms were prepared to aid them in finding their compass correction. an<l also to furnish the values of the magnetic declination arnl report the conditions of the magnetic stations, if they so desired. This prngram was started in June, ·and by the end of the fiscal yenr it ·was clear that this information is in great demand. The requests for information during June were double those of previous months, and only a quarter of the States had been reached. Excellent cooperation in reporting conditions of stations has resul ~ed, thereby making our information more useful to other local users and giving this bureau information on which to base a program of revision of stations. One of the many letters received is quoted, from a county superintendent of highways:

Instruction in the use o:f magnetic instruments was given three field officers prior to their departure for the field. In this connection efforts were made to find a suitable place :for a magnetic station in Potomac Park but without success, and one was finally established on the grounds of the University of Maryland at College Park. A demonstration of the instruments and methods of observing was given to some of the students of that university. The trne and magnetic meridians were established at Bolling Field at the site of the turntable to be used in determining the deviations of airplane compasses. . A paper on" Horizontal intensity variometers," written by George Hartnell, magnetic observer, was prepared for publication and sent to the printer. A new form was prepared for use in determining the magnetic declination on shipboard by means of a 3-point fix of position and azimuth. . A report on the magnetic work of the bureau was prepared for submission to the Rome meeting of the section of terrestrial magnetism of the International Geodetic and Geophysical Union and memoranda were prepared setting forth the views of the bureau regarding the subjects to be considered at that meeting. Magnetic data for special investigations were supplied to the department of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and to Father Luis Rodes, director of the Observatorio del Ebro, Tortosa, Spain. A table giving 'values of the magnetic declination and annual change for places in all parts of the United States was prepared for the 1923 edition of the World Almanac. As a result of the digests and other circulars being sent out to engineers and surveyors,. there has been a marked increase in the number of requests for information, and the greater part of the time

of one computer is now deYoted to the preparation of replies to such requests. Compass data were supplied for 112 charts. SPECIAL lNYESTIOATIONs.-In connection with the determination of the constants of the new Milne-Shaw seismograph, a study was made of the general theory of the seismograph. . A meeting of those experienced in the use of field magnetic instruments was held at which the various instruments and methods were discussed. A small electric light for illuminating the scale of the suspended magnet of the magnetometer was one of the improvements ~uggested, and this has been provided for one of our instruments. Experiments were made with a telephone receiver in place of a galvanometer for use with the earth inductor, which indicated a possibility of successful development. A'study was made of methods heretofore used in locating and determining the extent of iron-ore deposits in preparation for experimental work along this line, first at the request of J. Ross Corbin, associate State geologist of Pennsylvania, and later in connection with work along the same lines hy W. R. Crane, of the Bureau of Mines. · Careful studv was given to the problem of improving and extending the seismoiogical -work of the burenu. In this connection the chief of the di.vision visitc>d the Tucson Obesrvatory and conferred with scientists in California especially interested in the subject.
DIVISION OF TIDES AND CURRENTS.

The work of the division of tides an<l currents is comprised under the f_oll_owing heads: Tidal observations and computations; advance predictions of tides and currents and preparation of annual tide and current tables; current observations and computations; tidal and current surveys ?f our principal harbors; physical oceanography; and the preparat10n of technical publications dealing with tides, cur, rents, and related phenomena. . Tidal observatio~s and reductions were made at six principal stat10ns on the Atlantic coast, three on the Gulf coast five on the-Pacific ' coast, and one in Alaska. Observations and reductions of currents were made at nine light vessels on the Atlantic coast and five on the Pacific coast. Computations on the relation between wind and current were made for the light-vessel observations on the Pacific coast, in order to correlate wmd and current for the preparation of current diagrams for the ai~ of the navigator in estimating the current, due both to tide and Wmd effects, to which his vessel is subject. The results of this work are o:f prime importance to shipping on the Pacific coast and will npJ?ear 'RS a separate current table for the year 1923. The manuscnpts for these current tables-Current Tables. Atlantic Coast, and Currei;it Ta?les, Pacific Coast--are now in the hands of the printer and will be .1ss.ued early in the next fiscal year. The predictions of tides and currents for the 1923 tide and current tables were made and the manuscript submitted for printing in five separate .parts: Tide Tables, Atlantic Coast; Tide Tables, Pacific Coast; Tide Tables, United States and Foreign Ports; Current Tables, Atlantic Coast; and Current Tables, Pacific Coast. The first three

The above table, however, does not show to the full the value of the survey's tidal and current predictions to the public, for many thousands of privately printed tide tables, copied directly from the survey tables, are annually issued all over the country. Thesj:i appear as separate tide tables for different localities, and in almanacs and calendars. Some are sold and some given away in the form of advertiserµents, all reaching the public in useful form. In addition, the public reeeives the benefit of these predictions through the medium of the daily newspapers, a great many of which publish the tidal data in their columns, these data being furnished them by the Coast and Geodetic Survey directly or by means of the published annual tide tables. · During- the past fiscal year the field stations of this survey located at Boston, New York, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Seattle have secured for this office statements of different firms on both coasts as to the number of these privately printed tide tables issued by each firm. The result shows that a total of 33 firms make an annual distribution of 365,000 local tide tables, and these firms are located in cities around the whole coast of the United States from Boston, Mass.: to .Tuneau: Alaf"ka. Of course, there are many firms from whom information has not been received and they are not included in these statements. As previously stated, many newspapers give daily or weekly tidal predictions and these real'l1 a large number of interested people. Statistics gathered during the past fiscal year show- that 35 newspapers with an estimated combined circnlation of at lenst 4,000,000 copies published tidal data furnished by this office. These are doubtless only a few of those newspapers published which contain tidal information, being only the newspapers in Boston, New York, Philadelphia: Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, and San Francisco.
DIVISION OF ACCOUNTS.

The total disbursements from July 1, 1921, to June 30, 1922, amounted to $1,851,960.60. This sum does not represent the total expenditures for the fiscal year, but only the amount actually disbursed during the period mentioned. In a separate report to Con-

SEC'L'JON.

The instrument section is under the supervision of the Assistant Director. The function of this section is to design, devise improvements of, construct, repair, and purchase scientific instruments, such as are specifically demanded for the needs of the survey in all its branches. In addition, it must keep account of all of the inventoriable property of the bureau, both in the field and in the office. During the fiscal year 773 instruments, apparatus, tools, etc., were made; and 760 instruments, apparatus, and tools were repaired in the section.

CHAPTER II.
PROGRAM FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IN THE WASHINGTON OFFICE.
OHIEF CLERIC

The pro<~ram for this diYision will be, in addition to routine duties' of tlw division, the completion of the renovation of the buildings oecupied by the bureau, and the preparation and distribution of digest:.; of geodetic work of tlw bureau for as many States of the· Pnion as time permits.
DIVISION OF HYDROGRAPHY AND TOPOGUAPHY.

The program for office work in this division for 1923 includes( a) Further study of field work projects to include work that has been urged by ·shipping and commercial interests because of rn·"· aeti vi ties, particularlv in .\laslm. (b) Continued study of cost analysis of field work to determine wherein further economies can be effected. (c) Preparation of plans for the execution of such oceanographic investigations as cari be made by three vessels during their passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast and by one vessel bound from the Pacific to the Atlantic. The acquisition of three mine sweepers fro~ the Navy has necessitated a redistribution of vessels for economic and other reasons, the mine sweepers going to the· Pacific coast and one vessel, now on the Pacific coast but not entirely suitable for.work there, coming to the Atlantic coast. A limited amount of phys1ca~ oceanographic work can be accomplished by these four yessels .wlule going to their several stations and without materially mcreasmg the c~st of the passages. ( d) Preparation of plans for reconditioning a third mine sweeper. ( ~) Further stu~y along the lines of standardization of surveying eqmpment a~d o~ improvement of equipment. (/) Investigation of methods for fixm~ positions of vessels at sea beyond the limit of visibility of shore ob]ects. (g) Preparation and publication of United States Coast Pilot.. Section C, Sandy Hook to Cape Henry, and the United States Coast Pilot of the Hawaiian Islands. (li) Study and discussion of survey of the Mississippi River Deltru by aerophotography. Correction of charts that include the Delta from information furnished by these photographs.

DIVISION OF GEODESY.

The program of office computations for the division of geodesy for 1923, ?Y project, is as follows: (a) Tr1an~lation and traverse: Huntsville, Ala., to Memphis, Tenn.; Memphis-Little Rock-ninety-eighth meridian; El Reno, Okla.Needles, Cali~.; Pecos, Tex., to Colorado Springs, Colo.; Green BayDuluth; L.omsiana; Maryland; in North Carolina, South Carolina~ and Georgia; any special piece of work that may be requested.

HEPORT OF DTHECTOH, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

( b) Levels: Rouses Point, N. Y., to Portland, Me.; Duluth-Green Bay, ""Wis.; Centralia-Cairo, Ill.; Anchorage-Fairbanks, Alaska. ( c) Astronomic: Azimuths, latitudes, and longitudes along the arcs of triangulation and fows of traverse given under (a). ( d) Gravity: Final computation of the gra ,-ity results for the stations determined during 1921; computation of gravity results and isostatic compensation for stations determined during 1922. Pu.blications.-Triangulation in North Carolina; Triangulation in Louisiana; Triangulation in Maryland; Triangulation, MemphisNinety-eighth Meridian; Precise Leveling in ({eorgia; Instructions for Precise Leveling; Instructions for Precise Tri!rngulations; Instructions for the Compufotion and Adjustment of Triangulation.
DlVTSlllX OF ClL\H'l'S.

The program for 192:) calls for the production of 10 new eharts, 3 topographic maps of the Virgin Islands, and the reconstrnction of 13 existing charts. An ·important item of work to be undertaken by the drafting section during the year, but which has not been included in this program, is the reproduction 0£ such original topographic and hydrographic sheets as, through age and constant use, are approaching the point of illegibility. They have passed beyond the stage when it is possible to reproduce them photographically, and so must be copied by our draftsmen.
DIVISION OF TEHRESTRIAL l\fAGNJo;TISl\f.

The program for the fiscal year ending June 30, 192a, is as follows: Reduction of observa:tory work-Complete ';1-'ucson 1919-1920. Complete Vieques 1919-1920 (all five observato~·ies, 1921). Computation of field observations as received. Tabulation of earthquake records as received. Supplying information to surveyors and engineers. It is expected that the issue of additional digests of geodetic publications and the sending of the pamphlet Compass Surveys to county surveyors will result in an increasing number of requests for magnetic data, and that more time will be required to furnish the desired information than has been the case in past years. It is planned to start the issue of local isogonic charts. It is planned, in cooperation with the division of hydrography and topography, to establish a compass school for the instruction 'of the young officers of the bureau. Measured by the unit of what an average computer can do in one day the routine work on hand on July 1, 1922, was as follows:

DIVISION OF

'l'lDI~S

AND curumNTS.

. The program for this division for the year ending ;June BO, 1928, as follows: The tide tables for 1924 will be completed, scanned for the detection and removal of small errors, and submitted to the printer. The current tables for 1924 will be completed and sent to tht> printer. The sounding records received from the hydrographic parties will be checked as receiYed, rn that no delay will be occasioned to the chart divis~on in the publication of charts. . . . ,Of the tidal records received, those upon wlnch the cletermmation of planes .of Peferen~e depend will be computed immediately and t~rn comptitation of the other records kept up to elate ns the force will allow. . Th.e publication on the bench marks for the State of New York, now ll1 th.e h~nds of the printer, will be issued early in the year. A pnbhcat10n on the relation between winds and currents on the Pa~ific coast,. together with an abridged publication of the same, written especially for the mariner, the manuscripts of both of which are almost completed, will be sent to the printer early in the year. The manuscript of a publication on the harmonic analysis and prediction of tides will be completed during the year an<i sent to the printer, provided the time of the mathematician engaged on its preparation may be spared from the work absolutely necessary to the. ~roper func'tioning of .the _divisior.i. The preparation of the remamder of this manuscript will reqmre about three months of uninterrupted work by one mathematician. The observations secured on the current and tidal survey of New York Harbor will be analyzed immediately upon their receipt from th~ ~eld, the results discussed and interpreted, and a publication on t~1s important piece of work prepared for early distribution to engmeers and the interested public. In addition, the improvement to our curr~nt predictions made possible by this survey will b~ incorporated m the present current tables for the use of the mariner. In general, the work of the division will be so arranged as to take up imm2diately the work upon which the publication of charts and the prosecution of the general field work of the bureau depend.

The program for the ensuing fiscal year will be to continue to keep up the instrumental equipment, to improve the same in harmony with modern progress, to maintain the system of accounting for property belonging to the bureau, and to continue to improve the method of accounting in adjustment with necessity and convenience.

Part III.-IN THE FIELD. CHAPTER I.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE FIELD DURING THE PAST FISCAL YEAR.
HYDROGRAPIIIC WORK.

The following is a statement of vessels at the disposal of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey at the beginning of the fiscal year : Bache, Oosmos Emplorer, Fatlwmer, Hydrographer, Lydonia, llfarinduque, N atomd, Pathfinder:bRangeP, SuM;eyor, TV erwnah, and Yulcon; tota_l, 13. The steamers iscoverer and Pioneer were transferred to this service from the Navy Department on April 7, 1922, and during the remainder of the fiscal year were undergoing alterations to convert them to surveying vesseis, having been built for mine-sweeping duty by the Navy. The following is a brief statement of the assignment of vessels at the disposal of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Suney within the fiscal year: Bache.-On July 1 this vessel was engaged in the hydrographic survey at the entrance of Chesapeake Bay. The survey extende.d from close inshore to the 100-fathom curve. At the close of this work the Baclie took up work in the Gulf of Mexico, extending the offshore work accomplished during the previous year by the steamer Ra_nger westward to the Delta of the Mississippi RiYer. Completing th1_s work the Bache proceeded to Norfolk and was undergoing rel?a1rs at _the; end of the fiscal year and taking on necessary supplies for contmumg the hydrogmphy in the Yicinity of Chesapeake Bay entrance. Oosmos.-Was opera~ed by the party on the steamer Surveyor, and the work accomplished by this vessel is covered in the statement of the Surveyor. Emplorer.-On July 1 this vessel was engaged in combined operations in Stephens Passage and _Lynn Canal, Southeast Alaska. These operations include precise tnangulation, wire-drag work, magnetic work, topography, and inshore hydrography. The larger launches, Helianthus and Scandinavia, as well as the smaller launches which customarily make up the survey equipment of the vessel, were used in the execution of this work. The wire sweep which was developed during the preceding year was used for drag work and proved exceedingly efficient. Its use resulted in covering a greater ~rea than would have been possible with a wire-drag at a correspondmg reduced unit cost. The field work was closed during the first part of October and the vessel returned to Seattle on October 22. While ia Seattle the party was engaged in completing the survey records .of the season's work, making necessary repairs to vessels and eqmpment, purchasing outfit, etc., for next season's work. On March 14 the vessel left Seattle to resume this work and was en47

gaged at the end of the fiscal year in continuing it through Lynn Canal westward thr.ough Cross· Sourn1 and Icy Straits to Cape Spencer. Fatho111er.-This nssel was employed in suneys in the Philippine Islands. On .T uly 1 she was engaged in surveys in the vicinity of Cagayan Island. Later she was engaged in surveys in the southeast coast of Palawan Island and west coast of Zamboanga Peninsula, in which work s1ie was engaged at the end of the fiscal year. Ilyd1·ograplwr.-On ,July 1 this vessel 'vas engaged in hydrographic work off the passes of the Mississippi River. This work. including tlw observation of triangulation, base measurement, and azimuth oh.;errntion, in addition to hydrographic work to the 100fathom cnrve, 'vas completed the first part of ,Tune. The vessel was engaged in making an inshore hydrographic survey in the vicinity of Chandeleur Islands, Gulf of Mexico, at the end of the fiscal yenr. Lydonirt.-vVas engaged in offshore work in the vicinity of Capr Mendocino. Calif., which work was completed as far north as Redding Rock. On May 24 headquarters were changed to Marshfield, Oreg., from which place as a base the survey of the Oregon coast line in the Yicinity of Cape Blanco was accomplished during the remainder of the fiscal year. The survey in the vicinity of Cape Mendocino "'US much needed for the safe navigation of vessels on the Pacific coast. The work on which this vessel was engaged in the vicinity of Cape Blanco is also in an important area, as n? hydrographic work has been previously accomplished in this locfl;hty. M arinduque.-This vessel was employed the entire year rn surveys in the Philippine Islands. On July 1 the vessel ·was enga.~ed i11 combined operations in the vicinity o:f Lagonoy Gulf. This work was completed on October 18. After completing this work and undergoing repairs in Manila this vessel took up work in the vicinity of Basilan Island, on which work it was engaged at the end of the fiscal year. Natoma.-On July 1 the Natoma was undergoing repairs at San Francisco. A detached party made a resurvey of I ... os Angeles Harbor while these repairs were being made. On August 18 a resurvey of San Pedro Bay was commenced, and a special survey of Tomales Bay was also made by a detached party. The latter work was completed during the latter part of September. The work in San Pedro Bay, including Carquinez Strait, was completed during the latter part of May. The vessel was undergoing repairs at San Francisco during the entire month o:f June, and these repairs were in progress at the end of the fiscal year .. Pathfinder.-This vessel was engaged during the entire year in surveys in the Philippine Islands. At the beginning of the fiscal year this yessel was engaged in the continuance of offshore hydrography from Polillo Island group to Catanduanes Island. An extensive bank, with depths of 30 to 40 :fathoms, extending 30 to 50 miles offshore, was developed. Beyond this bank sournting lines were extended to the 1,000-:fathom curve. An uncharted rock in Lamit Bay was located, and offshore 'hydrography was executed between Catanduanes and Samar Islands, the approach to San Bernardino Straits. This work was completed on October 10, and the Path'fi;nder arrived at Manila October 14 for annual repairs. During the latter;

part of OctoLer a special wire~drao- survey was made in the vicinity of Corregitlor Islands.· A short :eason .\vas spent in triangulation between Basilan and Jolo Islands. During the first part of April general snney operations were taken up on the west coast of Palawan Island, and this work was in progress at the end of the fiscal year . . Hanr~er.-At the beginning of the fiscal year t)1is ~essel was en route ll'om h.ey West Fla,, to San Juan, P. R., havmg m co1n-oy the two wire-dra;, launcl1es ilf arindin and iliitchell. The Hanr1er and convoy arrived San ,Tuan July 5. During the remainder of the fiscal year the Han,r7er· was engaged in wire-drag operations in Porto Rican waters. In addition to the regular boat equipment o~ the vessel the launches ll!Ucliell and 1lfarindin were assigned to tlns party for wfre-<~rag work. In addition to wire-drag operations additional sounclmgs have been taken where nPede<l to supplement the work previously accomplished. 8ur·11e1J01'.-This ~ressel was employed ai!the beginning of the fiscal year on "general survey of the outside coast of southeast Alaska, in the vicinity o:f Noyes Ishm<l. The hydrography ~xten~led from ~he beach to the 1,000-fathom curve, the topography of the Islan<ls bemg accomplished; and the necessary triangulation for control being executed. This work continued until November 3. After completing the necessary repairs and procuring outfit the vessel left Seattle (·11 January 7, if>22, and was engaged until March 22 in making current observations along the outside coasts of Oregon and Washington. On April 22 this vessel arrived on the working grounds in southeast Alaska and was engaged from that date until the end of the fisca! yeur in continuing north the surveys o:f the outside c.oast accomplished durino- 1921. W ~onahi7This ~'essel "·as engaged at the beginning of the fiscal yea: 111 com~:nned operations in Clarence Strait, which was continued '.\nt1l the middle o:f October. On October 24 the vessel arrived in Heat~le, annual, repairs were made, and the field records of the prev10us seasons Wol'k completed and forwarded to the office. On · March 16 the v~ssel left Seattle and on March 22 arrived in Ketchikan, and oombmed operations were commenced in Clarence Strait and ~rnest Sound. . In addition to the hydrographic and topographic work a sect10n of ah arc of precise triangulation is bemg iiccomplished. , Yulaon.-W as not operated during this year. The following launrhes were operated independent of vessels <lul'ing the fiscal year: ilfiloa1oe and El8ie.-These two cruising launches, with two open power boats, were useJ by a double hydrographic party in resurvey1i;ig the coast of South Carolina from St. Helena Sound to Bull Bay. 1 he survey was carried offshore to a junction with ship hydrography rece~tly completed on this coast, generally to n depth of 3 fathoms, an~ mto the important inlets to n distance of at least 1 mile or to a pomt where the ,present depths agree with those obtained by earlier surveys. Shore-line revision surveys were made wherever changes had tn;Irnn place since the last previous survey) and a revision hydrograph1c survey was also made of Charleston Harbor. Work was suspended on November 5 and both launches were hauled out for the winter. Since .Tune 5, l922, the Mikarwe has been in use with a.

Coast Pilot party which is revising Section C, Sandy Hook to Cape Henry, o:f the United States Coast Pilot. Launch Elsie was turned over to the diYision o:f tides and currents :for use in connection with the current survey o:f New York Harbor. Wildcat.-Party on the Wildcat was engaO'ed in making a complete survey o:f Icy Bay, southwest Alaska, from ':May 22 to the end o:f the fiscal year, at which time the work was still in progress. The Wildcat le:ft Seattle on April 25, it having been thoroughly repaired during the winter. Icy Bay is a small indentation in the outside coast line between Yakutat Bay and Cape St. Elias and is of commercial importance, as oil has been reported in this vicinity. I:f a survey develops that Icy Bay is a practical harbor, it would be the logical place to load this oil. There is a great demand :for this survey. Dora.-A shore party working on the chartered launch Dora made a surYey o:f the bar ut the entrance to Willipa Bay and o:f the bay as far east as the dredged cut leading to the cities of South Bend and Raymond. This work was commenced the latter part of January and was completed on June 15. The depths of the bar at the entrance to Willipa Bay are continuously changing, and the party erected signals o:f a permanent character which will be used in the :future for making a resurvey o:f this bar at frequent intervals, so that the charts may be kept up to date. Shore party.-A detailed survey was made in the ticinity of Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, N. C., at the request o:f the Lighthouse Service. This work was accomplished during the latter part of August. A survey was made to determine the extent of the erosion of the ocean beach front and includes the shore line three-quarters of a mile above the light, as well as a detailed hydrographic examination of the water area from the shore line to the 3-fathom curve. AERIAL SuRvEYING (1922) .-The aerial survey of the Mississippi River delta was completed by the Na val Air Service in April and May, 1922, 530 square miles having been photographed in the 16 days when photography was possible, covering a marshy area that would require many months o:f arduous labor to survey by the ordinary ground methods. A preliminary study of the photographs indicates that :favorable results should be expected from the office reduction. It also indicates that this project will be a strong argument in :favor o:f an extensive program of aerial mapping along our coast line. As in past years, this bureau has been ready to cooperate to the limit in aerial surveying, but the Air Service of the Army and the Navy have been hampered by either lack of funds, equipment, or personnel, necessitating a curtailed program. It is hoped that .this new branch of applied science ·Will receive its proper support in the near future, and that its importance as an accurate, rapid, and conomical method of surveying and that its value as a traming school for the personnel of the air forces will be recognized.

In addition to the leveling listed in the above table, abont ~50 miles o:f single-line check le,rels were run in New York to locate small errors in certain precise level lines in the northern part o:f the S~ate, and about 75 miles. o:f flying levels w~re run in Kantucky. to discover a meter blunder m a precise level line between ·west Pomt and Oakland. Numerous astronomic azimuths were determined in connection with the triangulation listed above. Other astronomic work done during the fiscal year includes !) astronomic latitudes determined in Louisiana and 'l'exas, 2 in "Wisconsin, and 1 radio longitude determination in V{isconsin. The longitude mentioned is the first one to he determined by radio in the United States. It marks a great advance over all ·previous methods :for longitude work. Gravity determinations were made during the fiscal year at 10 stations m the general region o:f the Mississippi delta and at one station in Wisconsin. The new invar pendulums were used :for the first time :for this work and gave satisfactory results, although precautions had to be taken to control the magnetic effect. At several o:f the ·stations it would have been impossible to use the bronze pendulums on account o:f the lack o:f constant-temperature rooms and the impracticability o:f building them. For the gravity determination in Wisconsin, which was made in connection with the longitude work mentioned above, radio time signals were used for obtafoing the rates o:f the gravity chronometers~ GEODETIC FIELD Womr AccoMPUSHEn.-As usual, the field work consisted· o:f the extension o-f the systems for precise horizontal and vertic11:l control, the determination o:f the intensity of gravity, and geodetic ~stronomic observations. Outstanding :features o:f the work done durmg the year are: ' (1) The great arc of horizontal control which extends from Hl~ntsville, A~a., to the vicinity of Phoenix, Ariz., by way 0£ Mem· ph~s, Tenn.; Little Rock, Ark.; Albuquerque, N. Mex.; and Winiatns,. Ariz., was completed. This arc is 1 600 m~les in length. and may "d ere d as o_ne o:f the great arcs , o:f the world. It' furnishes . b e cons1 accurate geographic positions: in seven States rund· crossss an area that has been very b~dly ~rr need o:f horizontal control for surveys; maps, and other· engmeermg w:ork. This arc is ·unique, in being it combination of ·precise triangulation and precise: Lti1averse. 'Fhe latter extends from a point on the Mississippi River just west o-f ~emphis, Tenn., through a very flat a~d heavily w.ooded area, to Little Rock, Ark. Traverse was substituted for triangulation on this portion of the arc because of the great expense which would have been involved in erecting high observation towers to elevate· the lines o:f sight between stations above the high trees. It has been found that :for comparatively sho1·t distances geographic positions can .be determined by traverse with all the accuracy requisite :for , precise horizontal control. (2) The arc which will extend from Pecos, Tex., northward through eastern New Mexico into Colorado, where a. connection will be ma?e with the transcontinental triangulation, was begun in the late wmter or 1921-22. This arc will be completed before the final adjustment is made of that portion o:f the Huntsville-Phoenix arc· (mentioned above) between the ninety-eighth meridian in Oklahoma and Phoenix, Anz. A number o:f connections will be made with:

monuments of State boundaries and several pieces of detached triangulation established by the U. S. Geological Survey for the immediate control of its topographic surveys will be coordinated. This arc and the one mentioned above are parts of the general plan for the extension of horizontal control to all areas of the United States. · (q) The officials of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Geodetic Survey of Canada have informally agreed to carry on certain cooperative work along the boundaries of Canada, the · United States, and Alaska. A part of this work is the extension of an arc of precise triangulat10n along the forty-ninth parallel from the Lake of the Woods to the Pacific coast and along the international boundary from the Lake of the Woods eastward to the precise triangulation which has been extended a short distance westward from Lake Superior. A party of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey began work along the forty-ninth parallel, working westward from the one hundred and ninth meridian, during the summer of 1921 and another party from this bureau began the extension of precise triangulation northward from Pocatello, Idaho, toward the Canadian boundary in the spring of 1922. · The work which the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey will do under this cooperative plan includes the triangulation from the one hundred and ninth meridian westward to the Pacific coast; the extension of the triangulation northward from Pocatello, Idaho, to the Canadian boundary; the extension of a short arc of triangulation from northeastern Oregon through the eastern part of the State of Washington to the Canadian boundary ; and a short arc of triangulation and traverse between the Lake of the Woods and the triangulation of the Canadian Geodetic Survey, extending a short distance westward from Lake Superior. A reconnaissance for the last-mentioned arc was made in the summer of 1922. The Canadian Geodetic Survey will do the triangulation from the one hundred and ninth meridian eastward to the Lake of the 'Voods. It is evident that the United States and Canada will each benefit by this cooperative work, for the triangulation will be available to each country for all classes of work needing precise horizontal control. Another advantage of this arc of precise triangulation along the boundary is that it makes possible the coordination of the surveys and maps of the two countries which join at the boundary, and each boundary monument will then have the same geographic position on the maps and in the publications of the two countries. This is one of the most important and extensive pieces of coope~ative geodetic work in surveying and mapping between two countries of which there is record. (4) Observations were continued during the summer of 1921 and the spring of 1922 along the arc of precise triangulation which will extend from Dixon Entrance to ~ite Pass, southeast Alaska. It is expected that this arc will be completed during the fiscal year 1922-23. This arc is a part of a long arc of precise triangulation which will extend from Puget Sound, Wash., northward along the coast. of Skagway, Alaska, and then down tl.1e Ynkon River in northwestern Canada to a point where that river crosses the one hundred and forty-first meridian, the boundary between Canada and Alaska. The Canadian Geodetic Survey is cooperating with

the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey on this triangulation by doing the work between Puget Sound and Dixon Entrance and will in the near future begin work on that portion of the arc extending from White Pass to the crossing of the Yukon River and the one hundred and forty-first meridian. This is another piece of cooperative w01;k between two nations which is of great importance to each of them. It will form the basis for the coordination of surveys and maps throughout a very large area. (5) An event of great importance to Alaska was the beginning in the spring of 1922 of precise triangulation and precise leveling to the northward of Cooks Inlet, which will be carried northward toward Fairbanks. It is planned later to carry this control work eastward to join the triangulation extending from Puget Bonnel to the crossinl?' of the Yukon and the Alaslrn-Cana<la boundary. Fol' many years Government bureaus working in the interior of Alaska have been making demands on the Coast and Geodetic 8urvey for the establishment of precise triangulation and leveljng in the areas in which they are working. These bureaus are the U. S. Geologic~! Survey, the Forest Service, and the General Land Office. it is hoped that the work outlined above may be expedited to such an extent that the needs of these other Government organizations may be met in the near future. ( 6} Late in the previous fiscal year a party' of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey began work at the northern end of a line of precise levels requested by the U. S. Geological Survey, extending from Green River, Utah, southward to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, do~n that canyon to Lees Ferry, and thence southward to Flagstaff, Ariz. l'his work was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year 1.921-22, and shortly thereafter a second leveling party began operations at the southern end of the line, working northward. Many har~ships .were endured by the members of these two leveling parties wlnl~ working in the canyon, and many difficulties incident to the peculiar character of the land had to be overcome. The line was successfull;y con;ipleted late in the fall of 1921, and the results of the observat10ns, i;n the form of preliminary elevations, were furnished to the Geological Survey almost immediately. (7) Successful tests were made during the preceding fiscal year with the new nickel steel (invar) gravity pendulums. These pendulums made at this office, are practically free from errors resulting from v~riations of temperature during the observations. They were used in the determination of the intensity of gravity at 10 stations in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas in the fall of 1921 and proved to be most satisfactory. At a few of the stations the invar pendulums ~ei:e compared directly with the bronze pendulums, and the results md1cated that the invar pendulums gave as accurate results as the bronze.. It was found that, on account of their low coefficient of e;Xpa':ls1on, the invar pendulums could be used in a tent. The variation 1;n temperature mside the tent B;nd in the pendulum case itself had. little effect on the observed per10d of the pendulum. The coefficient of expansion of the nickel-steel alloy is only . about onefifteenth that of the bronze, and, therefore, a given change m temperature affects the period of the invar pendulum only one-fifteenth as much as it would that of the bronze pendulum. In addition to the determination of the intensity of gravity at the 10 stations mentionef1

above: the astronomic latitude was observed by the same party at iili but one of the stations. These latitude stations were connected with the triangulation along the coast and will be of value in i1n-estigations involving the shape and size 0£ the earth and in the determination of the distribution 0£ densities in the earth's crust. The results of the gravity determinations at the 10 stations mentioned indicated very clearly that the earth's crust is in isostatic equilibrium under the Mississippi Delta and contiguous areas. This is n very iili~ port.ant fact, for some scientists have thought that the delta material is an extra load on the earth's crust. (8) The appropriation for the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year 1922-23 contained an item of $15,000 for carrying on geodetic work in the form of triangulation and leveling in regions sub~ ject to earthquakes. Just before the encl of the fiscal year.1921-22 plans were made at the Washington office to repeat observat10ns at a number of the old triangulation stations in California to determine whether there had been any horizontal movement 0£ the ground since the earthquake 0£ 1906. 'The triangulation party planned to take the field at the beginning of the fiscal year 1922-23. Appropriations should be made £or geodetic work in active earthquake regions £or at. least several years to come in order to test thoroughly the theory that there is a creep of the upper material of the earth's crust prior to an earthquake. The Coast and Geodetic Survey is cooperating with a committee of scientists outside the Government service mak'ing an intensive study of earthquake phenomena and theories. (9) Ptior 'to the fiscal year 1921-22 the Bureau 0£ ~tandarcls constructed an apparatus £or the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey to be nsed in the determination of the differences of longitude. This apparatus was designed to l'ecord autonmtfoally time signals sent by radio from the Annapolis station. After a number of tests in vVashington .this apparatus was sent to the field in Wisconsin and at the end o:f the fiscal yenr was being used vei-y successfully. It is'hoped that later this apparatus may be used to recotd radfo time signals from distant stations, thus making it possible to use it in the deter1Ilirii1tion of differences of longitude in Alaska. A v{lry severe test will be given the apparatus during the coming fisbal yeai·. ·Other geodetic work accomplished during the fiscal year ·i!? .. as · follows: (1) The traverse line which was started at Green Bay, Wis:, dm:ihg the latter part of the previous fiscal year· was extended to Duluth by way of ~a<lys1!1ith an.cl a spur _was run from the ~atter P!ace sout~ ward to W1sconsrn Rapids. It 1s planned to contrnue this work rn the future from Wisconsin Rapids to the Mississippi River and then westward across Minnesota to a junction with the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. · (2) A line of precise levels was run along the Columbia River from Portland, Oreg., to Wallula, Wash. A line was also run from Bend, Oreg., northward to Prineville, Oreg. ( 3) A small piece of precise leveling was done in Kentucky between Louisville and Oakland to check precise leveling which had been run between those two places in the previous fiscal year. ( 4) Precise leveling was started in the spring 0£ 1922 at Rouses Pomt, N. Y., and run eastward across the northern part 0£ Vermont. Several connections were made to precise leveling of Canada. The line will be extended during the coming fiscal year to Portland, Me.

tioned m paragrapll 1. . . (5a) A party of the survey was engaged during the summer and fall .of 1921 in revising precise leveling which had previously been run lll the State of New York and in connecting certain tidal bench marks along the Hudson River with bench marks of the precise level net of the country. ( 6) Near the end of the fiscal year 1922 a party took the field in Kansas for the purpose of determining the intensity of gravity at a number of stations selected by the omcials of the U. S. Geological ~urvey. This \vork is designed to throw light on certain geological problems. (7) During the winter of 1921-22 a party was engaged on the revision of descriptions of bench marks and traverse stations in the State of Georgia and in stamping the adjusted elevations of the bench marks on the metal tablets. Similar work was done by another party in the State of Texas. 'I'he results of the precise leYeling by the U. 8. ( 'oast and Geodetic Suney will be of much greater value to those who need elevations if the adjusted elevations are stamped on the bench marks. The results will also be of increased value if there are up-to-date descriptions of the bench marks to make them more readily recoverable. . (8) A piirty was engaged dnring: the latter part of the fiscal year m re-marking: and redescribing stations of the transcontinental trinngulation in Missouri. Kansas, and Colorado. These stations were O!<tabl.ished more thnn 20 yenrs ago, anrl at that time no metal tablets wer~ inserted in the stones or blocks of concrete used in marking the stations. As a result the surface mark at some of these stations has bee~ destroyed, thu~ making it difficult to recover the station. The pa1 t) has. been settmg new sul'facc marks where necessary and has been placrng a metal tablet in each of the station marks on which is stamped the name o:f the station and the year in which it was established. New descriptions of the stations are being made wher·ever the olc~ ones are no longer.true or adequate. Observat.ipns :for the vanat10n o:f latitude were continued at the station nt Ukiah, Calif., throughout the fiscal ;vear. Ukiah is one -01 the stations of the Neutral Geodetic Association, :formerly the Intemational Geodetic Association. The work was begun at this station more than 20 years ago and was paid :for by funds provided by the International Geodetic Association until the' beginning of the World 'Var. Since then the station has been maintained with funds provided partly by Congress in appropriations made to the State Department, partly by the dues of the United States to the Reduced Geodetic Association, which were retained by the State Department, an~ partly by priYate research funds. The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey has had direct supervision over the station by authority of the geodetic associations, and the observations have been forwarded at the end of each month to Dr. H. G. van de Sande Bakhuyzen, secretary of the Neutral Geodetic Association. A. sy~posiu1!1 on isostasy was held at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America at Amherst College the last bf December, 1921.

Geodetic Survey formed the basis for most of the nine papers presented at the symposium. These papers will appear in a single number of the Proceedings of the Geological Society of America in the near future. MAGNETIC WORK. The reoccupation of repeat stations for bringing our secular change data up to date was given first consideration. From the beginning of the fiscal year to the end of September W. W. Merrymon, magnetic observer, occupied 25 stations in the northwestern part of the country. w·. N. McFarland, computer, was assigned to field duty from July 1 to October 22 and occupied 25 stations from North Carolina to Oklahoma and back to Virginia. F. P. Ulrich, magnetic observer, between February 11 and April 21 occupied a series of 23 stations extending across the southern part of the country from South Carolina to Colorado and back to Indiana. · In compliance with the request of the Florida Engineering Society, Wallace iM. Hill, magnetic observer, was assigned to the duty of establishing meridian lines and making magnetic observations in that State. Magnetic stations had previously been established at nearly every county seat, but many of them were fonnd to be no longer available for the use of ~mrveyors. Between February 11 and June 30 Mr. Hill occupied 25 stations in Florida and ·1 in Georgia, 8 of them being repeat stations and 11 of them new stations in old localities, and established 17 meridian lines. ·with the cooperation of the U. S. Coast Guard observations were secured at a number of places on the shores of Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean. ,J. T. Watkins, hydrographic and geodetic,engineer, joined the Coast Guard steamer Bear at Nome at the end of Juner 1921, and established magnetic stations at Emma Harbor and Whalen, Siberia, and at Teller, Point Hope, Point Barrow, and Demarcation Point, Alaska. He also occupied two stations at Nome and two at St. Michael. During the summer of 1921 cleclination observations were made with compass declinometer at a large number of stations in southeastern Alaska in connection with the triangulation, and the parties operating in that region in 1922 received instructions to rontinue the work. Declination observations were made on the steamer Explorer, J. H. Hawley commanding, in Chilkat Inlet, Chilkoot Inlet, and Lynn Canal. which showed the presence of local disturbance and the need of additional observations. MAGNETIC OnsERVATonrns.-The magnetic observatories at Vieques. P. R.; Cheltenham, Md.; Tucson, Ariz.; Sitka, Alaska; and near Honolulu, Hawaii, have been in operation throughout the year, and practically continuous records have been secured on the magnetographs and seismographs. The necessary absolute observations and scale-value determinations have also lieen made. The earth induct.or at Tucson got out of adjustment during June and had to be sent to the office for overhauling. Instruments used in magnetic survey work were standardized at Cheltenham, either before or after the season's work, or both. A magnetometer and dip circle to be used this summer at stations between Seattle, Wash., and Tucson, Ariz., were compared with

the Sitka Observatory instruments in June and will later be compared with the Tucson and Cheltenham instruments. Extensive repairs were made to the office building at Vieques. At Honolulu the well was cleaned and the pump repaired. thus materially improving and increasing the water suppJy. Improvements were also made to the hands' quarters. At all of the observa~ories painting and repairing were done as needed to keep the buildmgs in good condition. In addition to the routine observatory work various special investigations have been made as follows: H. E. McComb made a study of the Milne-Shaw seismograph under working conditions, remeasured the parts and redetermined the constants, and prepared a special report on the subject. In the course of his work a number of improvements to the instrument suggested themselves, and these were made so far as possible under existing conditions. He also prepared plans for a new seismograph house.··

Automatic tide gauges were kept in operation throughout the year at 6 stations on the Atlantic coast, 3 stations on the Gulf coast, 4 stations on the Pacific coast, 1 station in Alaska, ancl 1 station in the Hawaiian Islarn1s, a total of 16 years of records. In addition tidal observations in connection with hy<lrographic surveys were made at Hi stations in the United States, with a combined length of 3! years; 2 stations in Porto Rico, with an aggregate length of lf years; 19 stations in Alaska, with a combined length of 2-?J years; 2 stations in the Hawaiian Islands, with a combined length of one-half year; and 12 stations received from outside sources with a combined length of 4~ years of record, making a grand total of 281 years of ti?al records received. At the principal tidal stations the relation of tide staff to bench mark was verified with spirit levels, insuring accurate data for precise level net connections and also for the detection of emergence or subsidence of coast. Standard tide staffs and backing pieces, an improvement inaugurated during the past year in connection with the observation of tides, eliminating a great deal of trouble heretofore experienced in maintaining a fixed relation between tide curve and zero of staff, were established at 7 principal tidal stations, making a total of 10 stations so equipped. Current observations during the year were made on 9 light vessels on the Atlantic coast and on 5 light vessels on the Pacific coast. In addition short series of observations were made at 5 stations. The combined current observations total 6;'f years of record.

Another improvement worthy of mention here is the compact field automatic tide gauge, which was devised during the past year, constructed at thi8 office, and is now bein~ tested on the Potomac at Washington for minor improvements, which will make it a valuable ~urveying instrument. This new gauge, which is portable, will aid m securing better observations for use in connection with hydrographic surveys and obviate the necessity of maintaining one or more paid tide observers with each hydrographic party, thus securing increased accuracy at considerably decreased cost.

CHAPTER II.
PRESENT CONDITION OF HYDROGRAPHIC, GEODETIC, MAGNETIC, AND TIDAL AND CURRENT SURVEYS.
HYDROORAPHIC WORK.

It has been found convenient to arrange this work in the form of separate projects. These projects may be divided into two classes, as follows: (1) Unchangeable areas, (2) changeable areas which will require continuing operations for an indefinite period. In the first class there are the offshore hydrographv of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts; wire-drag work on the Atlantic, (-tulf, and Pacific coasts, including; Por~o Rico and southeast Alaska; the first complete survey of certam sections of southern a,nd western Alaska, which are of immediate commercial importance. No estimate is made of the Aleutian Islands west of Unalaska, most of the area in Bering Sea or Arctic Alaska, since their commercial development seems to belong to the distant £uture. For the offshore work we have planned. to go seaward to a depth of 100 fathoms in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico and to a depth of 1,000 fathoms in the Pacific Ocean. When these ocean surveys haYe been accomplished in accordance with present standards, there will be no nece&<;ity for additional work inside of the 100-fathom depths on the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico and the 1,000-fathom depths on the Pacific Ocean except in those places of compara~ively shallow depths, such as Georges Bank, Nantucket Shoals, Diamond Shoals, and the shallow coastal waters which are subject to constant changes. Likewise, after the surveys of the designated sections of Alaska, the Hawaiian and Philippine waters have been completed, the only additional work that will be required in these areas will be such as may result from changes in localities of shallow depth, or where greatly increased commercial importance necessitates more detailed surveys of small bodies of water, or where changes have resulted from public works undertaken subsequent to the original survey, and work in the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean. The second class of work--chart revision and the resurvey of the bays and iirnide waters of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States and, to a lesse1· extent, of Alaska and the insular possessionf"-m11st he carried on indefinitely, just as ''e are to-day resurveying waters that haw heen adequately surveyed several times in the past. This is due to the fact that the forcrs of nature are continnously eutting out and building up along the entire shore where the formation is not solid rock. and also to the fact that the industrial derelopment of the country is continuously changing both the waterways nn<l shor( line by (1redging channels, filling in, constructing piers. and other works. In order that the charts may be kept up to

da~ and be of real service to the mariner, it is neeessary that they be corrected from time to time to show these changes. The oceanographic work which the bureau should carry on can not he treated as a project on which any time limit for completion can be given. At the present time there is an urgent need for the detail of one able vessel on this work on the Atlantic coast, for the exploration of the Gnlf Stream is one of the problems that was laid down in the organic act creating the Coast Survey. We have done very little work of this kind in the hundred and more years of the existence of the survey, and no work of any consequence has been done within the last 30 years. These projects do not include all of the work that should be performe<l by the bureau in the line of hy<lrography and topography, hut it is believed that they do include all the projects that should be undertaken at this time or in the near future, the other work to he deferred until the completion of some of these projects. After the completion of any of these projects the personnel and equipment that had been employed on the project will be arnilable for other work. This other work includes hydrographic investigations beyond the ~imits of the present projects and other special investigations. It is clearly the duty of this country to perform its share of ocean investigation; and there is a large field for such investigation in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico contiguous to our coast but outside of the 100-fathom contour. There is a like need for such work in the Pacific Ocean outside of the 1,000-fathom contour, which is comparatively close to our coast. There are fishing banks seaward of the 1,000-fathom contour in the Pacific Ocean that should he investigated for the benefit of our fisheries. There is a stretch of unexplored water exten~ing hundreds of miles west of the Hawaiian group through which. our ships are required to pass. These waters are kno~vn ~o contam many,sh~als, reefs, and rocks that are a menace to nav1gat10n. The survey of these waters, together with resurveys of the. shallow changeable offshore waters, would fully employ any eqmpment an<l. persom~el that would be released on the eompletion of any of the proJects which require similar equipment. WIRE DRAG, .ATLANTIC AND GULF UoAsTs.-Area to be dragged, u,000 square 1rnles (3,000 square miles of this area is on the coast of Maine and includes much deep water).

The stretch of coast on the north side of the Alaskan Peninsula and extending from Unalaska Island. to the mouth of the Kuskokwiro River promises to be of increasing commercial importance due to the large fishing industries and the possibility of the discovery 0£ gold-bearing sands, the characteristics of the shores of the Kuskokwim being similar to those found at Nome. No work was accomplished on this project during the present fiscal year nor is any contemplated during the next year. HA w AIIAN Isr,ANDs.-The unsurveyed area is 10,280 square miles. Most of this area is deep water which could be done by a steamer of the Discoverm· and Pioneer type. The hydrography of the bays and close alongshore, as well as the topography, would be done by a detached party from the steamer living ashore and assigned a launch. This work is much needed, but owing to lack of appropriations it has been impossible to do any work on this project during the fiscal yea· nor is any contemplated during the next. In the present and previous annual reports there are printed diagrams of the condition of field operations. These diagrams are intended to show in a graphic manner where our surveys are at present adequate, or where surveys are needed. and the type of survey require~ to make our charts up to date and thoroughly reliable for safe navigation. To facilitate reference to the text and to the locality, diagrams are inserted showing the important steamer courses, the courses being numbered to correspond to the paragraphs of descriptive matter.

Using these sketches as base maps, I have endeavored to show tl~e progress that has been made jn the hydrographic and topograpluc ~ork, using the same sequence in numbering the courses and descrip-, tive matter pertaining thereto. · A detailed analysis of the conditions and the progress of the work can not he giYen in this limited space, but there are shmvn on the base maps the arens covered during the past year. 1. D1rnP-DnAFT ALoNGSHOilE CoURSJ<j J<'ROl\I THI~ CANAOTAN BoFNnAiff ·ro 'l'Irn 0Fr1m LTJ\JTT OI·' IsLE AU HAUT BAY.-The entire area that this qourse covers is a region of ledges and bowlders. The ledges rise abruptly from the deep water nnd the bowlders or<linarily lie singly or in dusters on an otherwise flat bottom, so that the navigator can not depend on the lead to nvoid them. The thoroughfares affording an exit to the Bay of Fundy from Passnmaqnodd)· Bay nnd St. Croix RiYer have been wire dragged; also an area Hi mile;; in length between Machias Seal Islands·and Petit Mamrn Island. There is still remaining a large area as yet untouched by the wire drag. There are a number of towns along this course that depend on waterborne traffic for shipping out their produce and receiving their supplies. The commerce consists of lumber, fish, fuel, and miscellaneous merchai1dise, constituting the supply of the smaller and lnrgl'l' fashionable resorts, of which the largest is Bar Harbor, Me. The exceptionally rocky coast mnkes it certain that a wire-drag snney will l'esult in the discovery of many rocks that now endanger the sn foty of commerce over this course. ( 8ee Fig. 6, opposite p. ()().) 2. FRENCHMANs BAY.-This body of water lies westward of Schoodic Peninsula and eastward of Mount Desert Island. It is the approach to the town and important summer resort of Bar Harbor, Wmter. Barbor, Southwest Harbor, Northeast Harbor, and many small villages and naval coaling stations on the north si(le of Eastern Bay. The bay _is frequented by many passenger steamPrs, yachts, small craft, fishmg "."essels, and a few cnrgo vessels. This area has bee~ dragged to a lme extending westward from Schooclic Island whistle buoy, thot~gh not to depths now considered necessary. The value of the work 1.s further impai.red by the necessity of passing over not less than 14 miles of 'f'mdragged, doubtful area in order to reach the bay from the open sea. (See U'ig. 6, opposite p. 66.) a. INLAND T1nmou<mFAHES }'HOl\J lVIouN'l' DESEU'l' ISLAND 'l'O HomcL.ANn.-There is a Sl'ries of rn lna ble inside passages along the Maine coast that are very nnr_row in plnees and '"ii:td het":een rocky ledges. Owi1w to the nature of the bottom they are m particular most likely to be ~bstrnded by pinnacle roc·ks of the extension of narrow ridges out into the chann~l. The only part of these channels which has been dragged lies between Blnehill Bav and the westPm entrance of Penobscot Bay. The rPstllts ohtaiirntl han~ been so startling that they clearly indieate dangers in the nse of l'hannels that have not been dragged. (See Fig. 6, opposite p. 66.) 4;. PENt)B.scO'r H1nm.-This riwr. Pmptying into the head of Penobscot Bay, forms tlw approach to the towm; of Bncksport. "\Vinterport, Hampden, an.d Brewer, and the city of Bnngor, the latter two at the hea<l of navicration, abont 24 miles above Fort Point Li(J"hthouse at the entran:;'e. It has considerable trade in regular ste~m ers drawing about 10 feet and many vessels trading to Bangor draw as much as 18 feet. Pr~cticnlly the entire river above Bangor is

66

SURVEY.

used in lumbering. From the mouth of the rjver to Bangor there will be no positive certainty of th~ absence of all dangers to navigation until the area has been dragged. (See Fig. 6, opposite.) 5. PENOBSCOT BAY.-In Penobscot Bay every port has benefited by the practical completeness of the wire-drag work. There are, however, some of the less important sections to be dragged and some of the approaches from the eastward are not yet compieted. The wire drag, as used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was developed in this region, and some of the area was not dragged to the depth now believed necessary. The size of vessels has increased, rapidly, and additional work is necessary to protect this increased draft. (See Fig. 6, opposite.) As it has required time to solve all the problems involved in dragging to this greater depth, it is probable that much of the deeper part of Penobscot Bay which was covered during the development of the wire-drag apparatus will later have to be dragged to a greater depth. 6. PENOBSCOT BAY TO CAsco BAY (DEEP DRAFT).-The coast of New England throughout its length presents practically one uniform problem to the hydrograph1c engineer. Surveys of varying degrees of completeness have been made of the entire area, and it is possible for navigators to select channels which are apparently safe. 'l'hey would be of ample depth if it were not fpr .the ice-worn granite rock or the large howlders deposited during, th~u~lacial period. The lead line i.s not adapted to find without assistance dangers of this character. This thoroughfare presents uneven and rocky bottom hetwt>~n Monhegan Island and the eastern entrance to Casco Bay, which should be dragged to remove all doubt of the existence of pinnacle rocks or small ledges. (1i?ee Fig. 6, opposite.) 7. P1·:NOBSCOT BAY To CASco BAY (MoDERATE DRAF'r).-From the western entrance of Penobscot Bay to Casco Bay there. has been no wire-drag work done. The inside route is constantly used by coasting steamers, but it is certain that it has within its limits many uncharted rocks, some known locally and some unknown. (See Fig. 7, opposite.) 8. BooTHBAY HAnBoR.-This forms the approach to the town of Boothbay Harbor and numerous smaller summer resorts. It is frequented ·by many vessels arnl by a large number of fishing boats nnd pleasure craft in summer. It is one of the best anchorages on the coast of Maine and is much used as a harbor of refuge by all classes of Yessels. This area iH in urgent need of a wire-drag survey. (See Fig. 7, opposite.) 9. K1<JNNEBJ~C R1v:1<m.-It is the approach to the cities of Bath and Augusta, the towns of Woolworth, Richmond, and Gardiner, and numerous smaller villages and summer resorts. The r~ver has considerable water-borne commerce, the deepest draft bemg about 21 feet to Bath and 14 to Augusta. There is urgent need for a wiredrag survey of this river. (See Fig. 7, opposi~e.) . 10. CAAco BAY.-Casco Bay and the approaches to Portland have been dragged with the result of finding numerous uncharted shoals, thereby :furnishing important evidence of t~1e n~ed of carrying the survey to the eastward and westward to a Junct10n with completed work. A resurvey of inner Casco Bay is badly needed, the glaciers ha\'ing left a series of long, narrow, and dangerous ledges, which require closer examination. (See Fig. 7, opposite p. 66.)

11. PoRTLAND HARBOR AND APPROAOHEs.-These have been dragO'ed, and all dangers to navigation are shown on the charts. (See :i}ig. 7, opposite p. 66.) 12. PORTLAND TO PORTSMOUTH (MoDERA'rE DRAFT).-Westward of Portland the succession of sand beaches, of which Old Orchard is the best known, might appear to indicate an absence of rocks in this region. The depth of sand above the underlying rock is not great however, and pinnacle rocks occur outside these beaches. Ther~ is a gap in the wire-drag surveys between Cape_ Porp~ise and Cape Elizabeth which must be completed to make this port10n safe. (See Fig. 7, opposite p. 66.) 13. PORTLAND TO CAPE ANN (DEEP DRAFT).-The region from Boon Island to Isle of Shoals is very rocky, and its importance as the approach to Portsmouth is well recognized. The area has been covered by the wire drag, which now :forms a continuously dragged area from Cape Porpoise to within 10 miles of Cape Ann. (See Fig. 7, opposite p. 66.) 14. PORTSMOUTH HAunon.-This area has been dragged, and all dangers to navigation are known. (See Fig. 72 opposite p. 66.) 15. MAssACHUSE'rTS COAST NoR'l'H oF CAPE ANN.-From the New Hampshire border to Cape Ann the shores are entirely different from those to the north or south. There are high sand bluffs in places and low sandy shores in others. As a result the depths along the shore are changeable and, though they have been recently surveyed, they will need further attention. (See Fig. 7, opposite p. 66.) 16. CAPE, ANN TO CAPE Con CANAL.-A completely dragged area extends from Cape Ann to Cape Cod Canal and from the head of Buzzards Ba_y to Sakonnet Point, R. I. With the exception of the areas near th~ shores of Buzzards Bay this important surve~ is complete. This work was made especially necessary by the openmg of the Ci;ipe Cod Canal in 1915, the original surveys having been made while the commerce of the region was relatively unimportant. A number of s~oals were found of less than the proposed canal depth. It was important not only to find those shoals of less than the proposed canal depth, !:>ut also those which might become a menace at some future date In case it should be necessary to deepen this canal to take care of the largest vessels. With this view the drag was carried at a sufficient depth to meet such requirements. Even should a depth of 40 :feet be adopted for the canal, the present surveys of the approaches will be found adequate, and where less depths have been found the information will be invaluable to the engineers making the improyement. (See Fig. 7, opposite p. 66.) 17. FnoM BosToN SoUTH OUTSIDE CAPE Con.-Mnch of the traffic bet":een eastern New England and points west and south passes outside of Cape Cod; most of it through Nantucket and Vineyard Sounds. Off Cape Cod the surveys are not complete. In Nantucket Sound the entire route is through channels bounded by shifting sand and requires frequent revision work. In one part of the channel most used-through Pollock Rip Slue-a shoal was formed in the last few years that has been steadily narrowinrr and decreasing the depth of the channel. A resurvey o:f part of this route is needed every few years to insure safety to navigation. No rocks occur eastward of Cape Cod, but in the north half of Nantncket Sound

68

TIEPORJ' OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

and the western part of Vineyard Sound large bowlders occur and wire-drag work is needed. At present vessels must pass over 10 miles of undragged area in following the best channel through Vineyard Sound. (See Fig. 8, opposite.) · 18. FROM CAPE Coo CANAL THROUGH Bm:zA1ms R>.Y.-'l'his route has been dragged out to the eastern limit of Long Island Sound. (See Fig. 8, opposite.) · 19. NAmtAGANSETT BAY.-This area has been dragged with the .exception of the thoroughfare leading through Mount Hope Bay to Fall Rirnr, and the small stretch to the north and east of Pruden<'e Island. (See Fig. 8, opposite.) 20. ENTRANCJ~ 'l'O NARRAGANBI~T·r BAY, B1..ocu:. IsJ,AND SouNn, FISHERS ISLAND SouND, AND EASTJmN PAwr OF LoNo ISLAND Sou:so._: These areas are practically completed, with the exception of the central and "·estern parts of Long Island Sound, which remain to he dragged. (See Fig. 8, opposite.) 21. Gur,J<· OF MAINE.-The portion of the Gulf of Maine of which the bureau ~aJ.res surveys may be C?nsidered as lying to the westward of meridian 67° O' and extendmg to Nantucket Shoals. This entire area has been inadequately sur~eyed, as it was accomplished at an early date when both the appliances and the methods were far inferior to those of tJ1e present day. Not only are the soundings obtained insufficient, but many of them are not located coFrectly on the charts. A good example of this is the discoycry several years ago that only one shoal rock exists on Cashe Ledge, where two were charted, and that Sigsbee and Ammen Rocks, formerly shown 4 miles apart, are really the same rock. These defects in the charts are serious for two reasons: The trans-Atlantic steamers approaching the ports of northern New England, especially Portland and Boston, are unable to depend on the charts of the gulf sufficiently to locate themselves accurately by sounding. This is particularly serious during the fog 0£ summer, which o£ten extends far out to sea and lasts for days, and the winter snowstorms. In addition to this the fisheries of the Gulf of Maine are an important national asset. Not only are many important fishing banks uncharted, but the limit and depths of known banks are not, correctly given. Besides, there is not at present enough information available as to the character of the bottom. The· knowledge of rocky bottom may lead to the discovery of.good fishing grounds. (See Fig. 9, opposite.) 22. NAN'l'UOKI~T SnoAI.s 'l'O GEoum;s BANKs.-Extending eastward from Nantucket Sound there is an immense shoal a n·a, consisting of sandy ridges which are shifted by the waves an<l ('Hrrents. Nantucket Shoals extend about 50 miles offshore; then there is a deep channel followed by ridges. It is readily seen that _it is important to keep the channel surveyed and to examine the adJacent shoals to detect changes; but it might readily be asked, _What is the use of surveying such areas as Nantucket Shoals, which vessels are most careful to avoid? First, it is necessary to be certain that the outer limits of these shoals are clearly defined in order that they may be avoided; second, the shoals are important fishing grounds; third, more careful surveys may develop safe channels for coastwise navigation, channels which are already indicated on the charts but are unsafe to use because of inadequate surveys. Due to the constant changes the existing surveys are nowhere adequate. The shoals

are so numerous and the chan!1els so intricate that a difficult problem is p;resented. in their examination by accurate methods. The _groun_d fish1~g, wln~h has in recent _years as~umed large proportim:s, is steadily movmg seaward. Dunno- the wmter ·Nantucket Island is the headquarters of this industry. :&ot only Jo the present charts lack the needed information in the search for new ground, hut the absence from the charts of existing shoals is a source of danger to the boats runninir to and from the harbor. Breakers often occur 'vhere there is ampl~ depth for boats when the water is smooth. This is an excellent example of how a region usually avoided by commerce may be of importance to an industry which furnished part of the food supply of the Nation. (See Fig. 9, op12osite p. 68.) . 23. TnANs-An..ANTIC APPROACH TO Nmv 1 omr.-There is scarcely any part of our coast where correct soundings are of more importance than in the approach to New 1York from the eastward, as all trans-Atlantic steamers bound to thnt port pass over this ·area. Many of theni have to depend 011 soundings for safety. A fairly good survey of this area is available, but additional work should be done by modern methods in the portion out of sight of land, so that the needs of the enormous trnffic will he met. (See Fig. 10, opposite p. 68.) 24. FROM PoIN'l' .Junrru To Nmv Y01m:.-It is almost unnecessary to go into particulars, except to make it clear that the central and western parts of Long Island Sound remain to be dragged. This work will be undertaken at the earliest opportunity, At present New York Harbor has but one exit to the sea for deep-draft vessels-by way of the Lower Bay and through Ambrose Channel over Sandy Hook Bar. The other exit...-through Long Island Sound and Block Isiand Sound-is obstructed by ledges at Hell Gate, in the East Rive~. The project to remove these and sel·ure a depth of 40 feet is now rn progress. Before it is completed channels of this depth in the sound should be examined with the drag to make certnin theY. are safe. This would als~ apply_ to J!ort Pound and approaches, if th.e proposed trans-Atlantic termmal is located at that place. The proJect to deepen East River to 40 feet makes it necessary to be certain where the channels wit~ such depths are located in Long Is~and Sound. The work done m Block Island Sound has defined the limit of such depths in the ell:stern approach to Long Island Sound, and it is urgent that the entire area should be completed without delay. The approaches to all the harbors on Long Island Sound should he dragged. The shoaler bays ure u~cd extensiyely by motor boats, and the number in operation for a given area is probablv o-reater than anywhere else in the United States.· (See Fig. 10, opp~site p. 68.) 25. HunsoN R1v1m.-The Hudson River is n valuable waterway between New York and Albany and is a part of the cannl systein of ~he State. A few years ago a dangerous rock was found directly m the path of steamers between New York and Albany. With such a possi?ility all the doubtful parts of the Hudson shou1d be drugged. (See Fig. 10, opposite p. 68.) 26. NEw YonK HAnnon.-New York Harbor hns had a recent survey, J;mt us it is an area subject to change it will require a survey, at least m part, every few years. (See Fig. 10, opposite p. 68.) 27. CoAS'l' OF NEw JERSEY.-Along the most of the coast of New .Je1·sey the character of the bottom is such that the exact existing

70

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

depths should be ascertained beyond all doubt, particularly as shoals dangerous to coastwise traffic have been reported from time to time. The only reliable surveys along this stretch of coast have been made in connection with searches for these reported shoals. Eastward of Cape May there are shoals that need a resurvey. A survey of this area in the vicinity of Cape Henlopen was made in 1920. The sounding lines were carried out to sea as far as the 100-fathom curve. (See Fig. 10, opposite p. 68.) . 28. DELAWARE BAY.-Delaware Bay has as its most marked characteristic a series of narrow, fairly deep channels separated by long, narrow shoals. These shoals are subject to change. A survey is needed now, and one should be made about every 10 years in the entrance and at longer intervals in the upper bay. While dredged channels are maintained for most of the distance from the entrance of the bay to Philadelphia, vessels of moderate draft use the other · channels. In view of the importance of the cities at the head of the bay and 'on the river, it is highly important that the needed survey of Delaware Bay be made so that a chart of the proper standard may be issued. (See Fig. 11, opposite.) . 29. DELAWARE BAY ENTANCE TO CHESAPEAKE BAY.-From Delaware Bay entrance to Chesapeake Bay there is a succession of shoals and banks. Many of these are buoved so that moderate-draft· vessels may pass inside of them. In cei·tain regions it is of the highest importance that the survey should be correct and kept up to date. At only one place has a comprehensive survey been made, and thi8 was the investigation of a reported shoal. Work in this section was performed durmg the fiscal year. The work extended north of Chesapeake Bay entrance. 30. CHESAPEAKE BAY AND TmnuTAmEs.-These have been extensively surveyed in recent yeurs, and a large number of tributaries will not require resurveys for many years. This is also true of "the Potomac Riyer. The parts whfoh need resurveying are parts of the bay from Cape Charles to a point opposite Annapolis, _parts of the .James River, and the Rappahannock and Susquehanna Hivers. The entrance has been recently surveyed, but another survey will probably be needed in 10 years. Owing to the shifting sandy bottom the bay is greatly in need of examination at critical localities where depths are near the draft of vessels, freguent reports indicating presence of new shoals. (See Fig. 11, opposite.) 31. CHESAPEAKE BAY ENTRANCE TO CAPE HATTIJUAs.-The diagram shows the triacks for both the light-draft and deep-draft vessels. A party is prepadng to take up work just south of the entrance to Chesapeake Bay where shoals have been reported. 32. ALnEMARi,1·: 8ouNn.-Albemarle Sound and its tributaries, with a few exceptions, have been resurveyed within the last few years and will not reguire resurveying for a long time. .The uncomplete~ port~ons, mcluding the North and Alligator Rivers,. should be fimshed m the near future, as they form part of the proJect for a through 10-foot channel of the inside waterw:iy route. The Chowan River, which is the western extension of this sound, should also be finished, and then the surveys of this r~gion would be in a most satisfactory up~to-date condition. (See Fig. 11, opposite.) 33. CRoATAN SouNn.-Croatan Sound, connecting link between Albemarle and Pamlico Sound, has recently been resurveyed, but

the depth is so near to the draft of vessels us~g-it that the surveys will have fo be revised from time to time. Changes in the roam channel have orcnrrecl within the last two years. (See Fig. 11, . . . . opposite p. 70.) 34. PAMLICO SouND.-Pamhco Sonnd has additional importance owing to its relation to the inland waterway route. The eastern half of the sound is well surveyed, but the entire western half and the Neuse River, in addition to its local use as part of the through 10foot ch~nnel, has not been completed. The survey was in progress up to October, 1920, when it had to be discontinued owing to the steamer proving unsuitable and too expensive to operate. (See Fig. 11, opposite_p. 70.) 35. DIAMOND SHOALs.-Diamond Shoals, off Hatteras, should be resurveyed chiefly to determine changes in their extent and particularly to obtain knowledge of the correct depths on the seaward side. (See Fig. 11, opposite p. 70.) 36. CAPE HATTERAS To WINYAH BAY, S. C.-Nearly the whole of this area is in need of a new survey, as those areas now charted are not in sufficient detail for modern navigation. Next to Diamond Shoals in importance to coastwise navigation are the shoals extending seaward from Cape Lookout and Cape Fear. They are subject to change and should be examined at short intervals. (See Fig. 12, opposite p. 70.) · !~7. WINYAH BAY TO FERNANDINA, F1,A.-This region has been recently surveyed. the work extending out to 100-fathom curve. The inshore limit did not include the water area inshore from the 3fatho.m curve or the entrances to the harbors and inlets. Resurveys of this shoal water area have been in progress during the fiscal year. The topography of the immediate ooast line has also been revised, the work extending from Bull Bay south to Savannah. The results show many changes of importance to small craft. 38. FERNANDINA To THE FLORIDA REE:Fs.-From Fernandina to the Flo!ida Reefs the area, of. moderate depths continually narrows, until. at Palm Beach the distance to the 100-fathom curve is very small. The completed survey referred to in paragraph 37 extends southward to a little below St. Augustine. South of St. Augustine· the bottom is probably not subject to change except as noted below, and the surveys, w~ile by no means complete, are fair . . Off Cape Canaveral and outside the southern half of the Indian River there are extensive banks and ridges in urgent need of resurvey. Known depths of 11 to 16 feet a long way offshore show the need of further surveys to make certain that all the shoals are correctly charted. From Jupiter Inlet to Fowey Rocks, where the Florida Reefs begin, the deep water approaches so close to the shore that it will be a slight task to complete inshore work in connection with the offshore surveys. (See Fig. 12, opposite p. 70.) :w. GENERAL, ATLANTIC, AND GULF CoAsTs.-An explanation of th~ method used in verifying the location of vessel by soundin~ when obJects on shore are obscured by distance or thiok weather will show why accurate charts are particularly needed from New York. to Palm Beach and from Kev West to the Mexican border. At fixed intervals the yessel t~kes soundings, which are plotted to the scale of the chart on tracmg paper, an<l this is moved over the chart,

keeping the line joining the sonn<lings para.Ile! to the course of the nssel until the soun<lings agree ·with· those shown on the chart. If the charts are correct and hased on a sufficiently modern suney the method is one of the hest known for yerifying the ship's position. If. on_t~e other.hand, the soundings are few and far apart, so that the ships soundmgs fall bet,Yeen them. and if those 011 the chart are wrongly placed. this method becomes much more diflicult. and an accidental agreement may lead the wssel into danger. From New York to Cape Hatteras the charts, whil<> fairly !.tood, are by no means good enou~h to meet the foll needs of nay)gution. but the work required to brmg thPm up to date has been postponed. as the need for resnrYeys has been morP urgent farther south. Up to a few years ago the offshore surveys from Cape HattPras to the Florida Reefs were almost unlwliPYablY deficient. This condition i~ being remedied as r:~pidl~r as possible;, and lwbn·en \Yiuyah Bay, ~- C., and St. A ugustme. Fla .. the offshore work out to the Gulf Stream is complete. It is important that this work be PXtemlNl both north an<l smith from its present limit as rapidly as possibh'. ·with adequate funds full advantage can be> taken of the season, and Irv working north in the summer· and south in the winter the cost of tl}1~ work will be greatly reduced.

CoAsT m' FLORIDA PROM PALM BEACH AnouNn TO CEDAR KEYS.For a distance along the shore of 567 miles from Palm Beach southward around to Cedar Keys on the west coast of Florida coral reefs are found, in some places more abundant than in others. Coral reefs. whether the result of disintegration or of a bui,Iding up by anim'aJ growth, are found in a ·great variety of forms ancl in vast numbers of sharp projections from the general bottom. where conditions are favorable for the> growth of coral. \Vhilc we are informed that an enormous number of uncharted rocks exist in this region, due to the fact that they are so numerous and that the region is so large, an effort has heen made to first clrng areas of the coast used by commercial and naval vessels bPcause of both the time an? cost involved. Wire-drag work is accordingly undertaken in loc~h ties where there arc commerce and naval operations. To nccomphsh even this will require years of work. vVestward-bound. vessels through the Florida Straits have to force their way. agamst the strong current of the _Gul£ Stream, which in places attams a velocity of 5 miles per hour. Along the northerly edge ?f the sfream and close to the reefs the current is very '"eak. There is a strong tempt1~ tion to keep dangerously close to thP reefs and save fuel, and this is the cause of :frequent accidents. Besides the danger of running into . the known reefs, which are in many places bare and. are of no gr~at depth throughout their length. another danger, the extent of which is not yet known, has been aiscover~d in a .second.ary ree~ parallel to the main reef and about one-half mile outside of it.

reef is found to approach the surface in places as a narrow ridae with depths as little as 25 foet. Twenty-five miles of this reef ha~e been examined, bnt 200 miles remain to be examined. It is important to nearly all the great traffic pntering the Gulf of Mexico that this examination be completed at the earliest possible moment. During 1fJ20 n vessel was employed on surveys of the Florida reefs betwem1 the :Niarquesas Keys and Fow<'y Rocks. This indmles supplementary surveys of the channels through tlw reefs from deep water into the inside route lying between the reefs and the mainland; also the close. de,·elopment of the shoal area \Yestward of Key "\Vest and south. ward of the Marquesas Keys. In connection with 'this the work has been carried out to.. the 100-fathom cnrve for a distance of 50 miles along the reefs. (See Fig. 13, opposite p. 72.) 44. VESSEL OouRsEs NoRTH Fno111 KEY "\VEsT.-Vesscls bound for ea.stern Gulf ports naturally wish to take the shortest route. If of light draft, they can cross the Florida Reefs at Key ·west. The next channel is between Rebecca Shoal and Dry Tortugas, and if this is not used vessels must pass well to the westward of Dry Tortuga;,.; to avoid a shoal bank west of it.. The Rebecca Shoal channel has been dragged and has ample depth of water. The bank west of Tortugas should be dragged, especially as vessels making land from th!' westward have to cross part of it. Northward of the keys from Key ·west to Tortugas a doubtful area should be dragged. Th(\ necessity of this is emphasized by the :fact that the U. S. 8. B'lli.~, while steaming northward of the Marquesas Keys, struck a corn I head which proved to have only 7 feet over it. This coral hood was dir~ctly out of a depth of 35 feet, with no indication of its exist~nce until struck by the naval vessel, which was severely clarnagwl. The '.~ha;nnel between the keys and the reef known as the Hawk Channel 1s importan_t for moderate-draft vessels. It will be necessary to r1ra.g the ax1s ~f the channel to insure against dangers to tlw w.sseh; making use of it. 45. CAPE R~llI~No.-This area is in need of surveys. An inspt>ction of the ex1stmg maps and charts of the State of Florida show practically a blank area for that part of the peninsuln south of Lake Okechobee. There are lmt few areas of the United States of like siie about which so little definite information can be obtained. Northward of this unknown region drainage canals are opening up the country for development. It is not nnlikely the same means will be extended southwnrd. At the present time the bureau shoulcl prepare to meet a demand in the near future for the delineation of a broader belt of country back of the sh on', ~ron: On pe Sablt> to Punta Rosa than is now shown on our charts. Iourrsts and land prospectors are now exploring this intricate syst0m o:f islnrnl and waterways. , (See Fig. 13, opposite p. 72.) , . 4(). 0HARLOT'I'E HAuBon.-No r0cent surveys have been made of tlrn; nren, ;md it shoul<l be resurrnyed.

50. INSHORE vVA'l.'ERS, Gui&' CoAS'l'.-The chief characteristics of the west coast of Florida are the distances to which shoal water ex, tends offshore between Cape Sable and Cape Romano and from Tampa Bay to Apalachicola and the existence of a large number of hays connected with the sea by deep channels, either natural or dredged. From Apalachee Bay to Cape San Blas the coast begins to assume a character more like the South Atlantic coast, and, coral bottom is no longer found. This stretch of coast is sandy, and sand shoals extend off some distance, especially in the vicinity of Cape San Blas. This region needs a resurvey and, like other sandy portions of the coast, will need resurveying from time to time. The Florida and Alabama coasts differ somewhat, as deep water approaches close to the shore in the latter. The coast of Mississippi and Louisiana has a very large proportion of chang(lable area, and resnrvevs are needed now and will be needed from time to time in the area fr~ru :Mobile Bay to the end of the offshore shoals of Vermilion Bay. The immense load of sediment carried by the Mississippi Hiver, especially in time of flood, causes constant changes in the delta. The deposit of sediment and the action of the waves on the deposits result in rapid growth in some places and of erosion in others. Sixty miles west of the Mississippi Delta there begins an extensive shoal region which is in need of survey. The inshore region along the rest of the Louisiana coast and the Texas coast, with an important exception, has deep water fairly close to the shore. .,Th.e exception is along the eastern part of the Texas coast from Sabme Pass to Oalveston. Sabine Bank and Heald Bank have shoal depths at a considerable distance from the shore, and they should have a thorough resurvey. Galveston Bay nlso needs resurveying. (See Fig. 13, opposite p. 72.) 51. ST. ,JoSEPHS BAY.-No recent surveys have been made of thi~ area, and a reexamination is needed. (See Fig. 14, opposite.) 52. Ol!'FsHoro~ WATERS, F1,orunA Rm~J<'S TO THE MEXICAN BonnER.Along the northern edge of the Florida Straits the soundings are insufficient, and they will have to be carried aut somewhat beyond the 100-fathom curve. Along the west coast of Florida the distance out to the 100-:fathom curve is ahont 100 mHes. Over much of this area the depths are moderate and the charts are based on reconnaissance surveys only. The bottom is coral rock in many places, a~d projections from coral banks may come sufficiently near the surface to be a menace to navigation. Fishermen have reported several uncharted ridges, and while the i-mmewhat incomplete surveys of the reported localities hu Ye not confirmed all the details of their reports, important differences from the charted depths have bee~ !otmd. ThP 100-fnthom curYe approaches fairly close to the ~1ss1ssippi Delta, then swings offshore again. so that it is about 60 unles south of Sabine Pass. It·then swings to the southward in a curve, which hrings it within about 80 miles offahore at the Mexican border. This whole offshore area is badly in need of a thoroug!1 resurvey. There is no other part of the work in offshore water so likely to be productive in furnishing important changes in existing ehartcd depths. (See Fig. 14, opposite.) fi)l. PENSACOLA BAY.-Surveys have recently been completed in the entrance to the bay. The .entire bay requires reexamination. (See Fig. 14, opposite.)

54. MomLE BAY.-A resurvey of this bay has been completed.

'55. M1ssrssrPPI SouNn.-A resurvey of this sound has been completed. (See Fig. 14, opposite p. 74.) . 56. LAKE PoNTCHARTRAIN.-ln connection with the surveys in Mobile Bay and Mississippi Sound, a recent survey has been made at the eastern end of the lake.· The greater part of the lake has not been examined for 20 years. (See Fig. 14, opposite p. 74.) 57. APPROACHES TO MISSISSIPPI PAssEs.-The hydrography of this area from close inshore to the 100-fathom curve has been completed during this year. The offshore work which has been in progress from Pensacola entrance westward has been extended during the pre~ent fiscal year to Mis~issippi ~~v~r Passes, leavin~ a small area of mshore hydrography, m the v1cmity of the Chandeleur ~slands yet to be accomplished. A vessel will complete this work durmg the next fiscal year. 58. VERMILION BAY AND Oo'l'E BLANCHE.-No recent surveys have been made of these areas. Surveys are needed. (See Fig. 15, opposite p. 74.) · , 59. APPROACH To SAB1NE; PM;R.-No recent surveys ha Ye been made here; revisionary surveys are needed. (See Fig. i5, opposite p. 74.) 60. PORTO Rrco.-The surveys of Porto Rico were begun when the island came under the jurisdiction of the United States as a result of the Spanish-American War. By 1910 the surveys of the bays, channels, and inshore waters were completed and a number of deepsea soundings were taken around the island. There are, however: extending to the eastward and westward of the island and along the south coast extensive areas where the bottori1 is of coral formation. There are .also reefs alona the north coast, but as they are close to sho;re and .must be avoid~d by vessels it is only important to know t~eir loca~10n and limits. The areas on the east, south, and west are different, m that there is traffic between the reef and over areas where the dep~h is little greater than the draft of the vessel, ~ncl the probable existence of uncharted projections is a source of danger. A vessel was engaged durin()' the entire year in draagina the waters of Vieques Sound and it;' approaches. This work ha~ resulted in finding many coral ~ocks, the existenc~ of which was not discovered by the hydrograpl:ic sun:ey of previous years. This party will remain in Porto Rico durmg the next fiscal year and continue the wire-drag work of this area. (See Fig. 16, opposite p. 74.) 61. VIRGIN IsLANDs.-The Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark, and the United States took possession in 1917. The surv~ys that have been made are by the Br~tish. and Danish Governments. It is certain thnt the coral formation m the waters touchin<T these· islands requires extensive w~re-drag suneys before accurat~ c·harts can be issued. Topograplnc surveys of these islands were requ~sted by the Navy D~partm!:'nt. The tria1~gulation was extended ~>astward from Porto Rico for th<' control of the topography. St. Thomas and St. John han~ be!:'n completed. and St. Croix was comP/~ted Inst fiscal year. On completion. of tlw wire-drng survey of 'ieques Sound hydrographic work wlll he taken np there.

62. PANAMA CANAL.-The Atlantic approach to the Panama Canal has been surveyed since work started on the canal construction. Limon Bay is, however, a region where pinnacle rocks occur. All the anchorages should be dragged, and the work should be carried a short distance outside. The Pacific approach to the canal has had a recent survey and has been dragged. (See Fig. 17, opposite.) 63. PACIFIC CoAsT 01'' THE UNITED S·rATEs.-The western coast of the United States is very different from the eastern. Generally mountainous, with comparatively few harbors or inside waterways and with comparatively deep water close to the shore, it presents little resemblance to the low shores and wide continental shelf of the Atlantic. The purpose of the survey is, then, to meet the needs of vessels approaching from seaward and coasting vessels which keep to a few comparatively narrow tracks, to insure up-to-date charts of the various harbors, to make soundings offshore; and to develop fishing banks that are known to exist. The weather is an important factor in increasing the importance of the charts of this coast. From Los Angeles Harbor northward fog is very common in the summer time, and in the winter gales, accompanied by thick weather, are of frequent occurrence. On the coast and in the vicinity of San Francisco thick weather is prevalent for perhaps 25 per cent of the time. Under such conditions. the navigat?r must rely entirely upon his chart. and it is essentrnl that detail surveys be made to the 100fathom cune. whieh is beyond the limit of soundings taken by merchant vessels: Along the shore of southern California much work was done up to 1895, and some of the surveys then made may be accepted as final. In the vicinity of the outer islands surveys extended only a little way from the shore, and the deep waters between and outside of them are unsurveyed. The few soundings taken show irregular bottom, and breakers have been reported in places where the chart shows 600 fathoms. These waters, therefore, should be surveyed out to the 1,000-fathom depth. The Oregon coast is practically unsurveyed. A limited amount of work was done years ago south of Cape Blanco and in the vicinity of the Columbia River, but this was not more than a reconnaissance and does not extend out far enough to be of practical value to navigators. Elsewhere no surveys have ever been undertaken until recently. Even in such an important locality as Cape Blanco, which must be rounded by all vessels plying b_etween the Columbia River and San Francisco, there are no soundmgs to serve as a guide in thick weather, and vessels have been lost wholly on account of this lack of surveys. On the coast of Oregon ther~ are eight important harbors on which the Governm~nt. and pnvate interests have expernletl approximately $40,250,000 ~n nnprovements clesiirnecl to facilitate navigation. One of these is the Columbia Riy;r the gateway to one of the most importa~t transportation c<~n ters of the Pacific coast. Yet, in spite of the immense expemlitures for improvements, there is not a single one of tlwse harbors the approaches to which have been adequately surveyed. The approaches to the Columbia River have been sounded for a short distance offshore. but eYen in this area the soundings are too far apart to more than indicate, in a general way, the depth which may b~ expected. This partial survey extends southward along the coast to mclude the approarlws to two· other harbors. The approaches to the remainin~

five, on which $3,826,000 have been expended in improvement, are entirely unsurveyed. The entire Washington coast stands in urgent need of a first survey, except in the approach to the Straits of Juan de Fuca and in the straits themselves, where the present work is adequate. (See Fig. 18, opposite p. 76.) · 64. Los ANGELES HAnnon.-A revision survey of Los Ano-eles Harbor and approach was completed during the first half of the fiscal year. 65. SAN FRANCISCO BAY.-San Francisco Bay is of varied character of bottom and needed surveys vary to correspond. The immediate approaches are complete except in the vfoinity o:f Farallones. Here additional sounding is needed, and an investigation should be made with the wire drag to verify the existence o:f other rocks than those charted. Wire-drag work has been carried through the.Golden Gate and inside, both northward and southward o:f San Francisco to the limit of the rocky area. ' The resurvey of the bar outside the Golden Gate has been completed. A resurvey of San Pablo Bay has ' been made during the fiscal year. 66. ALONGSHORE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC C0As1· STATI~s.-From the western end of the Santa Barbara Channel to Monterey Bay t?.e surveys, as a .rule, extend only to the 50-fathom curve, which hes but a short distance offshore. The surveys should be extended seaward to include the usual track of coastwise vessels, which lies ap average distance of about 10 miles from shore. From San Francisco Bay to Point Arena a widely spaced system of soundin~ lines has been carried out to the 100-fathom curve. Here an add1tional amount of work, about equal to that already accomplished, is necessary before the survey can be considered complete. Between Point Arena and Cape Mendocino the surveys extend a uniform distance of 6 miles from shore, reaching depths varying from .50 to 600 fathoms. Additional detailed sm;veys should be made in the vicinity of Point Arena and from there to the completed work south o:f Cape Mendocino. Detailed surveys are badly needed in the. vicinity of C~p~ Blanco, and ~his work should be extended to Cape Flattery, jommg the nor~hern limits of the work completed in .the vicinity of Cape Mendocino. · The offshore surveys which have been in progress for the pu.st tw<? years in the vicinity of Ca:ee Mendocino have been completed. This work extends from close mshore to the 1,000-:fathom curve. The necessity for such surveys is shown by the location of the hitherto unchai'ted submarine valley north of c'ape MendoC'ino, which was a factor in causing the wreck of the steamer Bem" At the end o:f the fiscal year a vessel was engaged in milldng a snrve3: of the water area in the vicinity of Cape Bhtnco, Oreg-. This work is to extend both north and south of Cape Blanco from close inshor~ to the 1,000-fathom curve. There are no adequate survey'.i of the msh9re area along the State of Oregon. Of the water off th~ northern }fart of the Pacific coast little is known. except that the :aureau of Fisheries, acting on the information obtained from fishermen, has. located certain banks. These banks should be surveyed to determine their depth and extent, and it is believed that a rreneral survey carried out to the l.000-iathom cune will result in the discovery 0£ other banks of great Yalue.

61. JNTEIUOU "\YATEUS 01'" THE STATt; OF \V MHHNGTON.-The interior waters of the State of \V ashington represent the point of change from a practically straight coast line to the broken formation of the coast of British Columbia and southeastern .Alaska. There are many channels of importance leading to Seattle, Tacoma, EveretL Bellingham, and Olympia and connecting with tlw inside passage to southeastern Alaska. All these should he dragged wlwrever there is the slightest doubt as to the presc1wP of dangers to na ,·igation. (See Fig. 21, opposite.) 68. STEAl\rnn UoUTEs, SoUTHEAS'rEms ALASKA.-In southeastern Alaska the first and most obvious need is to complete the wire-drag work . .Most of.these waters have been sounded, so that only dragging is necessary to complete the survey. This drag work should be taken up in the order of its importance~ beginning with the main steamer route through the region and then taking up the various tributary waters leading to areas of commercial im.portance. For some years past parties have been actively engaged in dragging the main steamer routes, and this work is now about 75 per cent complete. At the end of the fiscal year a party was engag~d in wire-drag operations in Lynn Canal, which work is to be extended as far as possi 7 h,le during the season through Cross Sound and Icy Straits to Cape Spencer. 69. THE OuTSIDE CoAS'l' W A'l'EHS OF 'l'!rn IsLANDs BonuEmso oN THE OPEN PACIFIC..:._These and their connecting channels are largely unsurveyed and should be navigated with great caution. A navigator seeing the chart on ·which the shore line is sketched-no soundings, several rocks and shoal banks, notes as to rocks and breakers reported, and a statement on the chart to the effect that the a.rea is unsurveyed-is, to say the least, unable to proceed with confidence. and this situation is by no means unusual. The same pressing need of such regions is a complete hydrographic survey :followed later in places by 'Yire-drag work. The rapidly increasing commercial importance o:f this region and the exceptionally dangerous character of the waters through which traffic must pass render surveys in the near future imperative. Work on the outer coast is now in progress northward :from Dixon Entrance. Surveys were also in progress in Clarence Strait anJ. Emest Souncl. (See Fig. 22,__,opposite.) 70. CROSS SouND TO PRINCE WILLIAM SouNn.-Jfrom Cross Sound. the northernmost channel from the inside waters to the sea, to Prince William Sound the coast has few :features of present or prospective importance. There is, however, urgent need :for surveys to insure the safety of vessels approaching and passing this coast. In this region the charts are very defective in the manner of showing soundings and prominent coastal mountain peaks and headlands that would enable the navigator to obtain his position on approaching from seaward. Additional surveys are needed in Yakutat Bay. A survey of Icy Bay was in progress during this fiscal year. As oil has been reported in this vicinity, Icy Bay may be of commercial importanoe: 71. PmNcE WILLIAM Sou:sn 'ro UNil\IAK PAss.-A very: important section of the Alaska coast extends :from the waters of Prince William Sound westward to Unimak Pass. Not only are the industries of present importance, but there are extensive mineral resources largely undeveloped through lack of cheaper transportation. The point to be emphasized is that this is not an old, settled country, with

its needs in the matter of transportation fixecl, Lut it is still capable of great future develvpment, and in considering the needed surveys its future must be taken into account. The approaches to Prince William Sound have been 8Urveyed, and no resurveys for the present are needed except iu the vicinity of Cape Ht. Elias nml Middleton Island. \Yire-drag \York will be needed in both of these localities, as reefa and pinnacle rocks .exist. Prince \Villiam Sound needs additional soundings over most of its area, and 111any of its branches need original 8t1rYeys. Corclova is the terminus of the Copper River & Northwestern Railway, which gives access to the important copper mines on the Copper River. The approaches to Cordorn have been surveyrcl, l)Xcept for wire-drag s11rvey::; ueeclecl to iusurn <"om~ plete safety. Seward. on Resurreetion 13a)·, is the terminns of the ~\laska Railroad, now' being built hy the (.;ornrnment. Tlw s11rveys of its approach are completecl exeppt for wire-drag work. ft is probable that much of the trade origiuati11g a long the line of the Oovernment railway will lw transshipped at Anehornge, at the hl·ad of Cook Inlet. ~ot only will thi8 make it nel'essary for many vessels to nu vigate these waters. hut there are now vc>ry large salmon canneries all along its shore8, as wdl as considPrabh· mining. The present surveys are inadequate, and wire-clrag work iH needed over much of its area. K0tli11k Islanc1, with a nmnlwr of l'anneries aIHl with some eattle grazing, is largely uusuneyed. From Kodiak Island westward to lTnimak Pass suneys are now in progress; only a comparatively small part has Leen surveyed at present. \Vhile the amount of present traffic is small, it is sufficient to need protection. At present the Coast Guard vessels and the freight ancl passenger ves~b run grave risks in using· the protPdPcl natural ehannel leadmg 11long the .coast inside the island. This is a particularly bad stretch of coast, with many reefs and islands. Only in the vicinity of the Shumagin Islands and from Unimak Pass to Unalaska Island have surveys been made, and they are inadequate. It is not now practil'able to drag the entire urea, hnt it is important that the immediate needs of navigation, evm1 though of limite<l amonnt, he .met by (lmgging a sl'lt>deu charnwl to insw·p the su foty of nssels from Shelikof Strait to Unimak Pass. Unimak Pass is the almost universally nsed d11rn1rnl into Bering Sen. It has been surveyed, but it is probable that part of it shoulcl be dragged or at least further soundings be taken. Surveys were in progress from Shelikof Strait westward to Metrofania Island during the season of 1920. The operations were hampered by a shortage of fuel oil, and with the expectation of a continuance of this shortage nrn1 the high price of the oil clnring the season of 1921 it was decided to postpone surveys in this section until another year. (See Fig. 23, opposite 1). 80.) · . 72. ArnuTJAN IsLANDS.-The Aleutian Islands have comparatively httle traffic and are without survey. It is necessary that this region be patrolled by Coast Guard vessels. The loss of one of the vessels of thiE! service a few years ago was wholly due to the lack of adequate surveys. (See Fig. 23, opposite p. 80.) 73. BRISTOL BAY.-A large part of the salmon shipped from AJaska comes from BristOl Bay. This is without surveys except ,~ Nushagak Bay and Kuskokwim Bay and River. Both of these have recent surveys, but, as the bottom is subject to change on account of the large river, future additional surveys will be needed.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

As an example 0£ what surveys mean in a new region, the discovery of an entrance to the Kuskokwim River suitable for moderate-draft vessels opened up an immense area for grazing and also in places for general agriculture. (iSee Fig. 23, opposite.) 74. NORTON SouNn.-The importance of Norton Sound is due to the gold mining on its northern shores and as being the outlet of the Yukon Delta on the southern shore. In all of Norton Sound additional surveys are needed. It is curious that in this sound, "·hich according to all available information is of quite level, sandy, or muddy bottom, Besboro Island rises very abruptly to a height of 1,012 :feet. 'Vith such an occurrence it is not absolutely certain that no pinnacle rocks exist. (See Fig. 23, opposite.) 75. BEmNG SEA AND ARCTIC OcEAN.-Except in the vicinity of Pribilof Islands there are no other existing surveys in Bering Sea or to the north which can be considered of Yalne. (See Fig. 23, opposite.) 76. GuAM.-The present chart of the Island of Guam is compiled :from Spanish and British charts and some harbor surveys by the United States Navy. No attempt at a comprehensive survey has been made. A complete survey should be made, not only including the harbors. but the surroundmg waters, carrying the work out to a depth that will be certain to include all dangers. In these watere shoals rise abruptly from great depths, and the absence of soundings on the charts does not imply safety, but simply absence of surveys. 77. HAWAIIAN IsLANns.-There are only two good harbors on all the Hawaiian Islands and both of these are on Oahu Island~ All of the islands exce_Pt 1Hawaii have coral reefs around at least part of them. In the vicinity of Oahu, Maui, Kahoolawe, and the south coast of Molokai the surveys are fairly complete. In the vicinity of Hawaii the surveys are very inadequate except in the only harbor, Hilo Bay. The west coast of Lania and the vicinity o{ the two westernmost islands, J auai and Niihau, are practically nnsurveyed. The various channels between the islands from Tani to Oahu are fairly well surveyed. The others are practically without surveys. (See Fig. 24, opposite.) · 78. Pnu,n·PJNE IsLANns.-The Philippine islands are composed of uot less than 3,000 islauds awl islets covering an area of approximately 150,000 square miles an<l about the same as that of the :five New England States and the State of New York combined. 'The total length of the general coast line, measured on small~scale charts nsiug 3-mile spiwPs of rlh·i<lers and omittin~ islands and bays leRS than :3 miles long. is approximately 10,850 miles, or about the same as that for the entire Atlantic coast of the United Rtates, including the islands. The nnsurvcved hydrography eovers a large area on aceount ?f the necessity of 'extending this work, in som~ localities for many nnles offshore, and on acco~mt of the very extensive area of the Sulu Sea. The unsuneyed reg10ns are as follows: The northe!lst coast of Luzon from Polillo Islnnd northward to Aparri; the reg10n off the north coast of Luzon. including the Babyan Islands, Balintang ChanneL the Na tan Islands. nnd Bashi Channel; the entire 'n~st coast of tlw island of Pala wan; the south coast of Mindanao, from. Pola Point to Malita, in Davao Gulf i the Sulu Arch~p~lago and the S11ln Sea from the Tubbataha Reets south to the limit of our possPssions off the C'oast of Rorneo. (See Fig. 25, opposite p. 82.)

79. N01~TH£AST CoM;T ol:' LuzuN.-This ~ntire unsurvey~d re~iou, f'r9m Pohllo Islanll on the south to Aparn on the north, is of little commercial importance, and, being qmte free from dangers to navigation, the execution of the work is being delayed until more important localities are ~ornpletecl. Little reliable information relating to this reaion is available, but a number of good anchorages have been reporte~. Among these are the inner harbors of Port Sau Vincente, Dilasac Ba,y, Casiguran Sound, and Dingalan Bay. The first and third mentioned are excellent typhoon harbors. The work must, however, be done during the season of freque!1t typhoons, it being impossible to approach the coast at any other time of the year on account of the heavy sea caused by the northeast monsoon. (See Fig. 25, opposite p. 82.) ' 80. 0:FJ<' NonTu CoAS'.1.' o.F LuzoN.-A suney should be made of the islands and the waters. to the northward of Luzon as far as Bashi Channel, as, in accordance with the numerous reports, there is considerable uncertainty in regard to the true location of the islands and the rocks that are dangerous tu navigation in the locality. As it is in the region Yisitecl by frequent typhoons, the work should be undertaken during the periol1 when the typhoons are less frequent. (See Fig. 25, opposite p. 82.) · 81. \VI-:S'l' AND EAST CoAs'l' 01'' PAL.AWAN.-The coast line of the island of Palawau is Yery irregular, indented with deep bays, forming some of the finest harbors in the archipelago. The whole region about the island anll extending south'\'ard to Balabac Island, to Ca~ayun Sulu, anll off the north coast of Borneo consists of coral r~efs, n\any small. islets, and innumernble hidden dangers to navigat10n. 'Io ~he westward of Palawan reefs and dangers extend to over 100 ~1les offshore. The hydrographic suney of this region inYolve.s an ~mmense amount of labor. A preliminary survey for the locat10n of channelH through the reefs nnd entrances to harbors will first be necessary. This work was in proo-ress at the end of the fiscal year. T~1ese localities must be swept ,;ith the wire drag. ( ::5ee I<'ig, 25, opposite p. 82.) 82. ""\V1,:RT COAST OJ<' MINDANAo.-This island is of little commercial importu_nee clue to the ~1bsence of harbors a1;1d l~aving a ruggecl 111011 nturnous country adJncent to the coast wlnch is not adapted to the o-rowth of any of the staple products. The usual steamer tracks do i~t approneh the shore within 4 or 5 miles, a sufficient distance to tivoid all dangers. For these .reasons the su~·v:eys now in progress have been postponed for more importa1:t localities. 83. Soun-I CoAS'l' oF M1NDANA0.-Tlus stretch of about 150 miles, from Pola Point to Malita in Da.vn? Gulf, is similar in I!1any respects to th~ West coast. In general, it is bold and steep, wi~h numerous outlymg reefs which however. do not extend a great distance from shore. The t~ianaul~tion for ·furnishing the controlling positi6rn; for the hy?rography and topography prei:>ents a ~lifficult problem, the shore line beina invisible from the peaks nn<l ndges bnt a short distance back.

progress.

It required a survey of the most careful and intricate

drag after the present hydrograph1c survey is made. The formation is coral and dangerous to navigation, as rocks are frequent! :found in localities where they are least expected to exist. The culrents in the region are very strong. The physical conditions are such that excellent control to coordinate the work with that along the coast of Mindanao can be obtained. (See Fig. 25, opposite.) 85. SULu SEA.-The northern end, as far south as the Tnbbataha Reefs, except certain small areas, has been surveyed with a fair degree of accuracy, but, owing to the coral :formations, where hidden dangers frequently exist, wire-drag sweeping will he necessary jn selected passages. A large part of the region to the south of the Tubbataha Reefs remains unsurveyed except for a rei:onnaissance wi.th approximate locations by navigational methods. A survey o:f this area is now in progress. Numerous rocks nrnl reefa clan<rcrons to navigation are scattered throughout the sea, but certaint'l welldefi~ed passages have been examined wit~1 sufficient accuracy to make nang·ntwn through them rensonnbly safe. (1,Ree Fig. 25, opposite.)
GEODETIC WORK.

An important operation of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey is the extension of precise triangulation, traverse, and leveling over the area of the United States and Alaska. A definite plan is bein" followed by the bureau which has been approved by the board of surveys and maps. This plan provides tha~ control snrveys shall be carried on to such an extent that no.place m the United States will be farther than fiO miles :from a horizontal control station nor more than 15 miles from a bench mark whose elevation above sea level is · known. The field work in .triangulation. traverse, and leveling clone in the TTnited States durmg the past year was designed to carry control into large regions that have not yet been reached with this class of work in accordance with the general plan outlined above. It has been the experience of many nations of the world that one of the best investments that can be made for their welfare is the surveying and mapping of their areas. to sh~n~· the confignra:~ion of the ground and the accurate geograplnc pos1t10ns and elevat10ns of the topoaraphic features. Accurate maps must be made wherever engineerhig and other industrial activitif's are carried on. The question has often been asked, "Why should ~JOt th.<' <'orporations or irnlivi(hrn ls needing the map make it? Tlns at first glanee would seem to b<:> a logical solution o.r t~e problem, l:nt it Innst be remembered that auy husi1wss orp:nrn:wtion n;l<ls to its capital account the eost of tlw surveys an<l maps that it may mah, and indirectly the public 11J11st pay high inter~st on :rn.v such PXpenditures for at least many years an<l perhaps mdefimtely. The sam<' nrc:t may be surveyed and mapped by half a clmip,n or more organizations. each one working irnlependently of th~· other uncl no one furnishing the data to the others. Such suryeymg and mapping a:re of but little value to the country, nnd the people, as a whole, will r<'ally pay for this work many timf':-; tffrr in the form of aclnlil('<'<l

Is it not better for the Governnwnt alone. or in cooperation with the St.ates and industrial corporations, to make the survey of anY particular area and to issue the results in tlw form of ID1;tPS and reports? Then, not only the corporations <loing business m the area will have tlw benefits of the maps, hut also otlwr ()rganizatiOns which may \Yish to do business in the partienlar area in the future. In addition the State will have the maps for the extension of highways, city devPlopment, soil suneys, etc., and om· military force>R will have the 1wcc>ssary maps sho111d it heconw necessary to carry on military operations in the area. A careful consideration of. these a<lYantageR provps most concluRively that great l'.'conomy will result if the Government performs the work. The tJ. S. Coast an<l Geodetic Snrvey has for a number of vear;; advocated the rapid extension of the horizontal and vl'11:ieal c<i:l1trol systems of the connt_ry ~n oriler ~o ~n!·nish to G~)vern!11<>nt ~>rgani zntions and to orgamzat10ns and m<hv1dualR outside of the (wvernment the necessary control clatn for the.ir detailed operations. The calls on this bnrean are so great that I must again urge increased approp1·iations for <'arrying ?" :no~P rapidly this g~odetic control work of the conntry. As nn m<lH'ahon of the condit10n of the control surveys in our countn. I wish to call attention to the situation as it c·xists in sonw of om;' States. Iowa has not a single precise or primary horizontal control station within its area. Montana hm; only a few stations along its eastern border. North and South Dakota have horizontal control stations along only their eastl'rn and western borders. Nebraslrn has only a single arc of triangulation running across it. Missonri has only one arc of triangulation ,vithin its area. There are many other States which. though somewhat better .off than those ment~oned, are seriously nnprep:ired ns regards geodPtic control f.or detailed surveyi1w :t!J(1 mappmg. .Although the United States Is badly in neecl of n';:'n('h more geodetic control than exists to-~ay, ye.t very :notable progress has been maile in the extension of this control dnnng the past lO vears. TJ1e TT. R. Coast and Geodetic Snney hns J"P{'('Jltly iss1wd n report tmtitle<1 "Geodetic opl'rations in the ljnited States 'from .Tnnna.ry l. 1!l12. to December :n, 1921." w.hich was presenterl to the conforence of the sPrtion of geodesy of the Internationnl Geodetic and Geophysiral Union. held in Rom<'. Ttaly. in May, 1922. This report slu;ws that 1111H'h mon' work "·as rlonP durinp: the 10 years eovered tl}un durinµ: any <_ith~r 10 yetu·s in the history of.the snrwy. It will b~ interesti11g to mchcntp the advance ~ade dnnng those years. The total Ieuo-th of the arc·s of precise trianp:ulation and precise traverse exC'cnt;<l <1minµ: the 10-~'Par period is 7,719 miles. The amount of this class of work done by all organizations in the United ~tates pr-for to .Tannary 1, 1912. wns.11,000 miles. An increase of 10 per c~nt was, therefore, rnafle clm·mg. tlw 10 years. During the 5!1me penod 15,475 miles of precise I~vehng were run in the United States by the U. 8. Coast and Geock·t1: Snnt>y and 500 miles by the Bnff_alo, Ro~hester & Pittsburgh Riulroad. The total amount of pre('1Se leYel~ng prior to ,January 1, 1912. was 30,000 miles.

States. Previous to that period there had been established 124 stations. The increase in the number of stations was, therefore, 31 per cent. The activities at the office of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (luring the 10-year period are in.dicated by the great number of geographic positions of triangula~ion stations and of elevations for precise leveling bench marks which were computed and adjusted; also by the large number of publicat.ions which give the results of the triangulation, traverse, and levelmg, and the results of the research work done to throw light on the many problems involved in geodetic work. · . A number of improve~ents in the geodet.ic instruments used in the field were made durmg the 10-year period. The most important of these are the electric signal lamps used in triangulation, the invar precise level which is practically free from the bad effects of changes in temperature, the invar rod for precise leveling which eliminates the detrimental effects resulting :from the use of the wooden rod, the invar pendulums which make it possible to establish gravity stations at places where there are no constant-temperature roon_is, an~ the apparatu~ fo!' recordi?g radio time signals in co~ nect10n with the determmat10n of differences 0£ lonaitude. This last-named instrument was designed and constructed the Bureau of Standards at the request of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Funds belonging to the survey were transferred to the Bureau 0£ St1mdards for paying certain portions of the expense of constructing and testing the instrument. Although observations have been continued throughout and since the war at the international latitude stations located at Ukiah, Calif.; Mizusawa, Japani and Carloforte, Italy, t~e work has been accomplished with considerable trouble, and at times it seemed as if the observations would have to be discontinued, at least at the Ukiah station. The results 0£ 20 or more years of variation of latitude work by the International Geodetic Association and, since the beginning of the war, by the Reduced (Neutral) Geodetic Assoc.iation, have proved of great value to astronomers, geodesists, and e;eophysicists. It is very .strongly hoped that there will be no break in the observations at these stations, and it is believed that valuable results will be obtained if other stations are located in other countries of the world. The status of the variation of latitude work was given very careful consideration at meetings of the joint committee on this subject ap:pointe~l by the Internatio?al Astrono~ical Union and by the geodetic sect10n of the I.nternat10nal Geodetic and Geophysical Union at Rome last May. The countries of the w~rld were m:ged to support the variation of latitude work whioh might fall within their areas, and the delegates from the United States, Japan, a_nd Italy agreed that they would mak<: such efforts as were practicable to secure funds from their respective Gov~rnments for making the ob?ervations and for the upkeep of the stations located in their countries. It is helicwcl that the Congress of the United States i;lwuld grant authoritv to the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey to <·ontinue other stations in the United Stat<'s as may 'he needed. The rnst would he very little, onti;ide of the pay of an officer who would he assigiw<l to m1ike tlw ol>senations.

Gravity observatiqns have been made at a number of places in the United States for the purpose of testing the theory that the earth's crust is. in isostatic equilibrium; that is, that at a certain depth, found by experiments to be approximately 60 miles below sea level, each large block of the earth's crust of a given unit area will exert the same pressure as a block of the same cross section or unit area anywhere else in the world. The work in· this country has been supplemented by gravity investigations made in India by the Trigonometrical Survey of that country an(l in Canada by the Dominion Astronomic Observatory. The results so far have proved that the earth's crust, under continental arR_as, is in isostatic equilibrium, and now it is proposed that further tests be made in such areas as the West Indies the vicinity of the Panama Canal, Alaska, Hawaiian Islands, and' other possessions of the United States. The estimates for the fiscal year 1924, if approved by Congress, will enable this bureau to extend its gravity surveys over such additional areas as may be needed by our investigations in geophysical subjects. It is especially desirable to have a gravimetric survey made of the Panama Canal Zone and the coasts adjacent thereto and of the islands near the Bartlett deep or tro~h whid1 runs to the southward of Cuba and eastward to Porto ~ico. It is believed that along the edges of this trough many o:f the strong earthquakes have occurred which in the past have caused so much damage to shipping in some of the harbors of the West Indies. Gravimetric work has a great practical value and importance as well as scientific interest. There is an excellent grade of triangulation, with well-marked st~ti<;>ns, along the whole course of the Mississippi River done by the M1ss1ssippi River Commission, but the results o:f this triangulation are not. availa.ble :for the public because th~ geographic positions of the stat10ns have not been computed and adJusted to the North American or final datum. Inquiry made of the officials of that commission by this lmreau has brought out the :fact that no money has been appropriated to the commission for making the computations and printing the results. The commission realizes the importance of this triangulation to the surveyors and engineers of the States bordering on the river and suggested that efforts be made by the TT. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey to secure appropriations for makincr the comJ1utations, etc. An item is contained in the estimates fo~ the fiscal Year 1924 for the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey to stn,rt this computation. It is certain that the cost of the small amount of work necessary to make tl.ie fina_l geographic positions available will be very small in comparison with the value of the results . . Some years ago the. Hawaiia!l goYemment extended triangulation <>ver a number of the islands of the group, but the final computation and a_djustment of the olisenations have never been made. It is imP.racticahle for the Hawaiian government to make these computations_. for it wonld require the employment of specialists who would !>~ difficult to obt!tin for the short time thnt the work would last. 1 he results of this trinngulation are valuable in coordinating the <'!wrts !lln<Je along the coasts of the islar~<ls hy the lJ.

Coast and GeoclHtic Suryey. Au item has heen.inclnded in the estimates :for beginning these computations. The U. S. General Land Office is cooperating with the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey by sending one of its engineers with each of two of our triangulation parties. One of these parties fa working in Idaho and Montana and the other in New Mexico and Colorado. As a result of this cooperation a number of land corners of the public-land surveys will be tied into the triangulation of the country ancJ their latitude and longitude will be determined. It is unfortunate that most of the public-land surveys of this country had to precede the establishment of the horizontal control system. bnt much can be done to rem~dy t~e result~ng condition ~y having tlw land corners connected with trrnngulat10n wherever either class of work is done in the future.

The magnetic survey of the United States has been completed to the point where it is possible to an~lyze the sitnntion for the entire country. The following magntic survey includes observations at n.e~ stations; recovery and replace~ent of old stations, including stat10n and reference marks; observat10ns at repeat statiotis · observations to determine the extent and int(lnsity of local distm~bances. These subjects will be t.aken up by States. The map brings out the aeneral conditions of maanetic surveys with reference to density and probable recovery of stations for each State. The table shows the number of stations that have LeeIJ uci:upie<l since 1880 and for reference the number of counties and the. c?unty seats now occupied are given. This is done because the ongmal plan for the magnetic survey of the United States called. for ?bservations at every county seat. The number of repeat stat10ns m each State is also given. This work is planned so that 35 to ~O of these repeat stations are occupied each year, but all o:f the stat10ns will be occupied as nearly as possible at five-year intervals. This permits the preparation of accurate isogonie maps to show the secula1· change of the magnetic declination. Local disturbances will be described with reference to each State. The meaning of the terms nsed in describing local disturbances should be clearly understood. " Slight " means that the earth's magnetic field is nearly uniformly distributed, and that th<' ~leclination varies nearly uniformly throughout the State and the ISogonic lines, therefore, are regular. "Moderate" means that for at least a part of the State the local magnetic field is dist?rte~l becaUS(' ?f local magnetic material, values of the m.agnetic dech_na~10n vary1~g by a degree or more from the values which wou!d exist if regulnr chstribution were foun<l and the isogonic lines are irregular. In the State the disturbances may be slight over most of the area arnl considerable in local localities. " Strong" means that local magnetic disturbance is :found over the entire State, or the <·onsiderabk clepartures from normal values are :found. at a number of places ~hroughout the State. In such regions the isogonic lines are highly 1rJ:"egular and are difficult to trace. MAINE.-Some local surveys are made by magnetic methods and old lines are being constantly rPtrace<l.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST. AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

FLORIDA.-The surveys by magnetic methods are considered very satis.factory in th~s State. A systematic revision of the. stations, includmg the placmg of mendian marks at the magnetic stations where desired, was started last winter and is about half finished This work will be resumed next winter and existing needs will thei~ be met. ALABAl\IA.-Land surveys by magnetic methods are frequently made. The chief need is for a revision of old stations. There is some local disturbance which should be investigated. The possibility of finding iron ore by magnetic methods is now being inves. tigated. Mrssrss1PPI.-Magnetic methods are frequently used in land surveys. The unusually high index number indicates that stations were exceptionally well marked, but many have probably been destroved and accordingly revision is necessary. · · ' TENNESSEE.-Surveys by magnetic methods are frequently made. There is considerable magnetic disturbance in the central part of the State that needs further investigation. Inspection of old stations is needed. KENTUCKY.-4- con.siderable amount of revision and the replacement of old stat10ns is n~eded .as s.urveys by magnetic methods are frequently made. The ISogomc Imes are very irregular in this State and more observations are needed. Ouro.-The stations were exceptionally well marked, but revision is needed. There is considerable local disturbance which needs further investigation. Surveys by magnetic methods consist chiefly in the rerunning of old lines. . . . . lNDIANA.-Stations were well marked, but rev1s1on IS needed. There are areas of local disturbances which should be further examined. · Ir,LINOis.-Stations were well marked, but revision is nce<kd. MrcmoAN.-Frequ~ntly new surve:)'.s are ma<lc by magnetic methods, but magnetic method~ are _chiefly used for rerunning old lines. Replacement of old stat10ns is needed. There is very little local disturbance in the southern.rart of the State, but there.is considerable in the northern part wluch should be further examined. It is apparently very di;fficult in this State ~o distinguish iron ore from other useless magnet~c rock, and accordmgly magnetic methods are of little use in searchm~ for ore deposits. . . WrscoNSIN.-The chief needs are revisional work and add1t10nal observations on account of the very widespread local clistur~>ances. In some parts of this ~tate the. conditions are unfuyorable for use of the magnetic needle m s';lrvey~ng. . . . MrNNESOTA.-The need m this State is for the rev1s1011 of old stations and further determination of the declination on account of the areat amount of local attracti<~m. Iowl°'-Old stations should be revised aml furthc>r (1Pten 11 inations made of the widespread local disturbances.

A.R'KANsAs.-Revision of stations is the chief need. The State is fairly free from local disturbances except a few localities, which need further investigation. · LoursIANA.-Land surveys are frequently made by magnetic methods. The chief need is for the revision of old stations. TExAs.-·While many more observations have been made in Texas than in any other State, the density is not great. The chief need is the establishment of magnetic stations at 19 county seats and also the revision of old stations. Conditions are favorable to the use of the magnetic needle in making surveys. 0KLAHmrA.-The chief need is the revision of the old stations. Conditions are favorable to the use of the magnetic needle. KANsAs.-Revision work is needed, also further investigations of disturbed areas at different places in the State. NEimASKA.-Revision of stations and further investigation of areas of local disturbance are needed. SoUTH DAKOTA.-Observations at several county seats, the reoccupation of old stations, also other additional stations are needed. NonTH DAKOTA.-Revision of old stations is the chief need. MoNTANA.-While the density is very much lOwer than in most of the ot_her States, it is not practic·able at the present time to ~ring the density of the mountain States up to that of the more thickly settled regions. Stations are needed at 13 county seats, and also the revision of existing stations. Conditions are not unfavorable for magnetic snn·eying methods. . . . . .

There is a wide area of local disturbance in this State ,~hich should be further investigated. l~TAH.-;-Additional stat.ions are needed, but revision of existing stat10ns is the great neecl. There are nine connty seats which are without magnetie stations. · NJ<JVADA.--:-~'he condition of the magnetic survey in this State is mos~ unsatisfactory, e':en when the lack of density of population is ('ons1dered. More station~ are needed, especially those at six county seats, !mt tlw great need is the replacement of most of the old stations. NEw ~bx1co.-The chief need in this State is inspection and replacement of stations where observations have been made. AmzoNA.-Revision of stations is the chief need. CALU'ORNIA.-The density of stations is good, but the replacement of ~tations is the chief nerd. Many s~ations were marked by methods satisfactory in the undeveloped regwns, hnt such marks have dis'.l'PPeared as the State has developc(l.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, UOAS'.1' AND GEODETIU SUll\'lff.

HElHARKs,-For ~hose stations wl~ere no n~mark is made conce;ning the use of magnetic methods full mformat10n on the subject is not aniilable. In general, it may be said that where land is cheap the expense of an accurate survey does not seem to be warranted but elsewhere more precise methods are used. However, ih practically all of the States land surveys have been made by magnetic methods some time in the past and magnetic information is neech~d for retracing old lines. This matter of actual use of magnetic survey methods while not strictly a part of the statement of present conditions, th~ needed survey is so closely connected that it can not be ignored.

PoR'ro Rico.-'fhe chief need i~ revision of stations anll the occupation of one or more repeat stations.. . ALASKA.-A considerable amount of magnetrn work ·has been done along the main lines of travel, but little ?f it is recent. The occupation of stations alonrr the outer coast from Nome to Demarcation Point emphasizes the'"' fact that we ha ye little magnetic information for the interior of Alaska. Observat10ns are needed along the line of the Government railroad. There is especial need for observations

along the Aleutian Islands owing to the fact that the g:reat circle course of the Pacific coast of the United States to the Orient passes close to these islands· also to the islands in the Bering Sea. The small value of the h~rizontal force and lack of knowledge of the values _of the declination and possible fluctna~ions makes D;avigation precarious. It will take several years of coi.1tmuous work m Alaska to obtain needed information. HAWAn.-Occupation of repeat stations and revision of stations is needed. · GuAM.-Magnetic surveys have been ma<le by this bureau, but advantage should he taken of a stop by transport nt Guam to occupy one or more repeat stations. . .. · PHILIPPINE IsLANns.-Occupation of repeat stat10ns and rev1s1on of stations is urgently needed, and this work should be taken up without delay. It is· only because we know from observations at Manila that the secular change is slight at the present time that this lack of magnetic resurvey has not re:-..ulted in placing erroneous values of the declination on the eharts of the Philippine Islands. · OnsERVATORn1s.-Each of the ohserratories is now furnishing u complete and continuous record of the value~ of the magnetic elements. As these instruments record only the variations, determinations of the absolute values are made frequently. The reEmlt of this work is that at five widely scattered places within the jurisdiction of the Uni~ed States-namely, Vieques, P. R.; Cheltenh~~' Md ..; Tucson, Ariz.; Sitka, Alaska; nnd near Honoiulu, Hawau-contm'!lo~s values of the magnetic elements are available. As a result it is possible to reduce the. values obtained in the field surveys to the st!lndard value. Need for this is indicated by the statement that without such correction .the chan<Ye in declination from year to year nould not be furnished. The observatory records sho·w magnetic storms for per10ds when the actual values differ more or less from the normal values. The observatories near the seacoast have an important function fn. t?nt they indicate the rates of change from ·year to year over a.dJ01mng sea areas. .This makes it unnecessary. to remeasure. the decimation at frequent intervals. Even w1th the old type seismog-raph in use at all except one station a great amount of. useful information in I'.egard to earthquakes has been obtained. The observatories are in a position to do a much higher grade of seismological work if made of primary importance as a function of the work. The five observatories named do · not provide all of the needed information. There is urgent need · for an additional observatory in the Canal Zone . . · SEA 0BSERVA'l'IONs.-This bureau has not made magnetic ohservut~ons at sea for a number of years, as it has been felt that the observa~ions o~ the Oarrnegie, combined with s~10re observations along the coast, giye all necessary results. There is uq~ent need, however, for observa~1ons in the shallow waters along the Atlantic coast. The (!m'1UJh{lie recently found a difference of 1 °. from the charted value in t e entranc.e o:f. the Chesapeake Bay. Thi~ occurrence in 11 reg-ion 0 ~ dense .navigation might readily be duplicated elsewhere. The difficulty is that the Carnegie has rtemonstrated the vast superiority of the ~onmagnetic vessel· for such work. It appears that a nonn;tag~etic launch or else a scow which can be helrl in a given direction is urgently needed. It should be nnclerstoo1l that in most eases

92

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

present values for most of the bays and inlets are deduced :from shore observations, and accordingly the charts do not show areas of local disturbances. PACIFIC CoAST.-There is a great need for magnetic observations from southern California to Point Barrow, especially from San Diego to Unimak Pass, Insufficient observations have been made along the coast in the path usually followed by vessels between San Diego and Puget Sound. Except for recent work· by the Lydonia off the California and Oregon coasts, comparatively few observations have been made in recent years in the waters of Puget Sound and tributaries and other inside waters in the State of Washington. There remains to be done a large amount of work in southeastern Alaska, thou~h useful results have been obtained by the Surveyor and W erwnati in the general vicinity of Ketchikan and to the westward. The Ewplorer has done a very considerable amount of ma 0 <rnetic work in the general vicinity of Juneau and Skagway. The investigations by the Emplorer in 1920-1922 indicate that it is possible to make a magnetic survey o:f a region of very marked local disturbance which includes a water area. Magnetic observations are needed along the coast o:f the Gulf o:f Alaska. Even though present navigation is slight, more observations should be made in Bering Sea. This is a region of much :fog al'ld of stronO' currents and navigation is still further handicapped by lack of comple~ magnetic information.
TIDE AND CURRENT WORK.

It is the aim of the bureau to keep in the lead among other maritime nations in the economy of securing tidal and current results as well as in the accuracy o:f the data furnished engineers, marin~rs, and scientists. This has led the members of the tides and currents division of this survey to be on the alert in the development of instruments along modern lines-to secure accurate results at a minimum of cost. The tide-predicting machine, designed and constructed at this office, which was put in operation in 1910 and used continuously since that time in the prediction of tidal and current data for the annual tide and current tables, is an example of this policy. Descripti<;>ns of this wonderful machine have appeared in many of the sc~enti~c journals of the world and, therefore, none will be made m this report, except for the statement that it will do the work of a larger number of mathematicians working continuously and even then turn out results equally accurate. . . Along these lines the survey has recently d~s1gne~ and established at its principal tidal stations staffs and back.mg pieces of standard design, which not only will permit the securmg of a more accurate zero of staff over a long period, but . also tend strongly toward economy in the manufacture of parts which are st~ndard. · With a view to economy as well . as accuracy m the securing of tidal data by the different field parties for the production of charts, the bureau has during the past year deve~oped and built a compact field automatic tide gauge which will reqmre a minimum of time for installation and maintenance and at the same time take the place on the hydrog-raphic surveys of expensive and often unreliable tide

observers. The development of such instruments has permitted the s!lrvey to l~eep abreast of other nations along tidal lines, so that the tide tabl~s issued by the United States have been brought to a standard rankmg well with those of other nations . . A~though the harmonic analysis which is made use of in the prediction of tides has not yet reached a state of perfectionh further study of the method may be made from the observations at t e representative tidal stations maintained for other purposes by the bureau at the larger ports along the coasts. The survey has been less fortunate in the study of currents, a subject very vital to the safety of shipping. This matter has not been neglected because of lack of interest nor lack of knowledge of the great importance of such work, but because of the fact that the securing of information on currents is far more expensive than that of the securing of tidal data, and the meager appropriations of past years have not been sufficiently large to obtain even preliminary observations. With the present appropriation continued from year to year, so that a systematic program of current observations may be carried out for a number of years, we may expect to build up current tables ranking with those of other nations and furnishing to mariners information on currents for all our coasts and harbors of vital importance to the safety 0£ shipping and to engineers in the development 0£ our harbors and the protection of our coasts against erosion. A beginning is bein()" made in New York Harbor through a recent appropriation by a systematic and thorough current and tidal survey of that .harbor. Such surveys should be made .of all the harbors <?f the Umt~d States, .ti:ldng them up each year m the ord~r of th~ir commercial and military importance. These surveys will furmsh necessary data to engineers charged with the development of the harbors both for commercial and military and naval purposes and to the mariner in furnishing him more accurate predictions for the berthing of large vessels where strong currents make it hazardous and at times impossible to berth large vessels except very near to the times of slack water. While little progress has been made in the study of tidal currents, even less has been made in the matter 0£ wind-driven currents along the open coasts, and these, too, are of even greater importan e to the mariner, looking to the safety o:f his vessel in thick weather when he is unable to fix his position by either terrestrial or celestial objects with his vessel beset by unknown currents. The survey has made ~se of every available means o:f se.curing obse~vations for the study of coastal currents. The cooperat10n of the Lighthouse Service and mariners has been obtained in the securing of observations on these currents. What is now needed are s~ort series of observations made by ~ survey vessel at designated vit'.11 points between 1~1.d1t vessels which will link together the ob~ervat10ns made. at these light vessels. A beginnin<Y was made durmg the past wmter between Alaskan seasons by the steamer Surveyor. T!1is should l(.e continued :from year to year until the whole coast lme has been covered. The methods used by the survey in the observation :ind reduction of currents are such that the wind currents and the tidal are decluced from the same set of observations.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Under physical oceanography, comprising miscellaneous oceanographic observations and computations for the purpose of furnishing information relative to densities, temperatures, ocean currents, and related matters to navigators, engineers, and scientists, very little has been done and much is required to bring our state of knowledgeand amount ·of information to that of other even less important maritime nations. At our door is the Gulf Stream, a study of which is one of the most important items in oceanography, which should be continued by the survey. Considerable work ~f a reconnaissance· nature was done a number of years ago by the Coast and GeodeticSurvey in this important field, but lack o.f fun~s has not permitted further work. At present the survey is makmg use of every available means for the securing of densities and temperatures. These are now being secured at 13 of the principal tidal stations maintained by the survey. Tidal bench marks are necessary to all engineers engaged in marine work in the vicinity of our coastal and harbor waters and, since the survey is the only organization of the Government service which has a strictly tidal division, it is evident that these bench marks must be furnished by this bureau. The most economical wav of establishing these bench marks is in connection with the hy,drographic su~·veys made ~y this 1.mreau for the charti~g of the coasts, connected mto long series by simultaneous observat10ns at the principal stations maintained by the survey, and it is this system that the bureau is following. . At a number of points along the co.ast~ the Coast and Geodetic Survey has for many yea~s ~een estll;bhslnng by means of tidal observations made at its prmcipal st.at10?s bench m~rks defined by a mean sea level datum. These are furmshed to engmeers throuO"hout the country and other .Goveri;ment. bureaus. Many of these bench marks are at old stat10ns, discontmued after a sufficient number· of years o~ observation~ to defi?e an accurate mean sea level, and the series of tidal.observat10ns which they _Protect and perpetuate are in danger of bemg lost. The preservat10n of these bench marks . is giving the survey great concern, for the~e stations should be .visited, old bench mar~s recovered w~e~e possible, and the new standard disk bench mark.s ll1;Stalled. Tlus is at present being done at the stations now mam~amed by t~1~ ~urve~, but lack of personnel and funds are preventmg the revisitmg of old stations of many years standing. This important work, however, should not be delayed longer, for these bencl; marks protect in many cases long se~·ies. of tidal observations costmg thousands of dollars and the duphcat10n of which would not only require many thousands more but many years. To the present time new bench marks have been established an·d old ones releveled only in connection .with othei; survey work, and while this makes for economv and will be contmued, there is still great need for a special tidaJ bench mark p~rty f?r reestablishing of bench ma,rks at stations which have been discontmued. At any one station this work will be necessary only every 10 years.

Inshore hydrography.-The steamer Natoma will upon completing the survey of San Francisco Bay take up hydrographic and topographic revision work in Puget Sound if funds are available to maintain that vessel throughout the year. SouTHEASTERN ALAsu:A.-Offsl1ore hydr·ograpliy.-The steamer 3urvcyor will continue on the offshore hydrography and the combined operations, triangulations, topography, and hydrography upon which she was engaged during this fiscal year. It is contemplated that this work be continued without interruption to Cross Sound, as much work as possible being done each year. lYire dra,q.-The steamer Explorer will continue wire-drag operations and such hydrographic and topographic work as may be needed to supplement the work a.lready accomplished along the main inside i:-hip channels from Lynn Canal through Cross Sound and Icy Strait to Cape Spencer. Upon the completion of this work the main ship channels of Southeastern Alaska will have been completely covered by the wire drag. The next work for this party will be the dragging of the more important side passages and those arms and bays to which vessels go regularly. · Inshore hydrography.-The steamer Wenonah will execute such hydrography and topography as may be necessary to supplement the work already accomplished in Clarence Straits, Ernest Sound and Zimovia Straits, so all data may be available which are neces~ I sary for the construction of a large-scale chart of this locality. Upon the" completion of this work ch~ring the fall of 1922 the 1Fenonah will be discontinued as a surveymg vessel. Precise triangulation.-During ~he ~ast tw? fiscal years precise trianrrulation has been executed by slup parties for the first time. This ~vork has been done in connection with the wire-drarr work hydrography, and topograp~y assigned t? the vessels. At the end of the present fiscal year, wit~ the ex~eptro~ of a small gap in Dry Straits, an arc of precise trrangulabon w1ll have been completed extending from Di;-;:on Entr:ince along the inside pnssage to Skagway, Alask'.L T~1s. arc w11l evel1;tually be connected at Dixon Entrance with a snmlar arc of precise triangulation now being executed by the Canadian survey, upon the complrtion of which it will be possible to compute all points in southeast Alaska on North American datum. WESTERN Ar..ASKA.-Triangulation, 111;droqr·apln;, and topo,qmphy.-One of the new vessels w:ill be einplo:ved cforing the latter part of the fiscal year 1923 in exten<lin'2" the triangulation, hydrography and toporrraphy executed in Shelikof Straits by the partv on the st;amer Sur~'eyor" in 1919 westwar? toward Chignik Bay.

now engaged. This will include general survey operations on the west coast of Palawan Island and work in the southern part of the Archipelago. GEODETIC WORK. TmANGULA'l'ION AND SrnNAL Bun,DING IN Nmv MEXICO AND CowRADo.-This is the continuation and completion of the arc of triangulation alono- the one hundred and fourth meridian from the vicinity of Pecos, Tex., nortlnvard to the junction with ~he thirty-ninth parallel triangulation just east of Colorado Sprmgs. This line crosses the unadjusted arc of triangulation extending from Oklahoma to Pheonix, Ariz., and will permit of the proper adjustment of both these major arcs. TRIANGULATION IN loAuo AND MoNTANA.-This Legins nn arc of triangulation alon~ the one hundred and eleventh meridian from Pocatello to the vanadian boundary. It is hoped to reach the boundary with this triangulation by the end of the fiscal year 1928. TmANGULATION IN WASHINGTON.-Starting from the Utah-vVashington arc of triangulation in the vicinity of Umatilla, vVash., a party in the spring of 1928 will begin triangulation northward toward the Canadian boundary. This, together with the triangulation along the one hundred and eleventh meridian, is part of the scheme of triangulation in the Northwestern States which is a necessary adjunct to the proposed triangulation to be executed in conjunction with Canada along the forty-ninth parallel.. TRIANGULATION IN ALASKA.-lt is hoped to contmue the operations along the proposed line of triangulation from Cook Inlet toward Fairbanks, Alaska. The country cto be traversed is very difficult and expen~ive :for precise triangullltion, but such control is so badly needed 1ll the interior districts that the expense is fully warranted. LEVELING IN ALAs1u.-A o-ood beginnino- was made durino- the latter mcnt1_1s of the fiscal year rn22 on ~ line of precise levels along the railroad from Cook Inlet toward Fairbanks. These levels will be continue~ l?Y one party during all the months of the fiscal year 1928 when it is possible to perform such operations. The line of levels will extend to Fairbanks, then down the mail route to Valdez. PRECISE L1~VELING, II.LTNOis AND \VISCONSIN.--This leveling has been requested by the U. ~- Geological Survey and will e_xtend from Duluth to Green Bay, \Vis., over the route of the precise traverse line executed last yenr. There will also be a line of levels from Vandalia to Cairo: in southern Illinois. It is Pxpeeted that both these projects will be finished during the first lrnlf of tlw fiscal year. Lm~LlNG, LAKE CnAl\Tl'LAlN TO Pon'l'LAND, J\,fE.-This linP was beg-nu_ 1ll tI:e fo;cal yt>:1r 102::, ancl it is expected t11~t it will be finished to a ]Unction with the tidewater bench marks m Portland by the end of field work this aHtumn. LEVELING IN CoNNECTICU'l'.-A party will be organized in Sept~n~b~r~ 1922, to .run a line of precise levels from New York ~o the v1cmity of Providence. This is part of the proposed trnnk line of precise levels to extend alono- the coast from Portland to N cw York, and it is being undertaken gut of turn at the urgent request of the

-0fficials of the highway department of the State of Connecticut who have in contemplation an elaborate system of levels on which their l1ighway system of surveys will be based. 1\1EASURLNG STANDARD BASE IN CALH'ORNIA.-During the winter months a very precise determination will be made of the distance between two mountains in southern California which will be used as a test line for standardizing an apparatus for measuring the velocity of light. This apparatus after being so standardized can then be used, it is hoped, in measuring bases of secondary accuracy. In regions where base sites are difficult to obtain, as in southeastern Alaska, this may result in p:reat savings on triangulation operations. The base measliring and triangulation used in determining the distance between two mountains will be of such character as to give an absolute error for the required distance of not more than one part in 500,000. 1VrnELJ<,Rs LoNGITUDJ~.-A party is now in the fiekL using an appaTatus which records radio time sip:nals for longitude determinations. 'The apparatus gave satisfactory results in '\Visconsin and is now being used in Colorado and New M~xico. It is hopl~d that the ap})aratus as at present constituted will record radio time sianals on the western coast and in southeastern Alaska, in which cas~ it will :be used in the latter country next spring at Laplace stations along , the aro of precise triangulation. Such stations are needed before the triangulation can be adjusted. . . GRAVITY OnRERVATIONs.-A gravity party, usmg trucks as a means of transportation and a radio recordin_g apparatus for receiving time signals, will be kept in operation dn_nng the summer and antnmn months of 1922 and, if funds permit, will take the field again in the spring of 192:3. The remainder of the appropriation for State surveys will be spent on the purchase and repair of instruments etic. The appropriat_ion for the surve:ys of the ea_rthquake regions fo~ t~e curre_nt year will be use~ exclusively o:i triangulation. A party is now m .the fielc~ reohservmp: at old stat.ions of the thirty-ninth parallel tnangulat10n, on the Nsvada-Cahfornia boundary. This triangulation will be extended over previously observeci scl\.emes to the west\vard toward the San Andreas fault of 1906. About twothirds of the appropriation will be spent during the first half 0£ ~he . fiscal year, and the remainder will be spent on similar triangulat10n ·during the spring of 1923. MAGNETIC worm:. Two magnetic observers will be continuously at work in establishing new stations, occupyin<Y repeat station's, and revising and replacing old stations. One p~rty will continue the systematic replacement of old stations and the establishment of mericlian lines where desired at all of the county seats in Florida durino- the winter. Especial attention will be o-iven to the north-central rrro~ip of States ~nd the middle western gr~np, also the west coast anclNew England, m order that accurate record can be kept of the secular change at the present time . .If practical, some work will b.e c~one i1~ Maryland.

Attention will be given to the replacement and improvement of instrumental outfits for field and observatory use.
TIDAL AND CURlIBNT WORK.

Durino- the following fiscal year it is proposed to continue, between A~askan seasons, the short series of current observations in the long stretches between light vessels begun last year by the SurfVeyor off the coasts of vVashington and Oregon. In order to utilize fully the series of systematic current observations made on the different light vessels on the Pacific coast during the past few years in the building up of satisfactory and useful current tables for the use of the coastwise mariner, these short series are necessary along the comparatively long sailino- lines between these light vessels for the purpose of linking togetl1er the current conditions along the whole coast. This addition to the regular program of tidal and current work will necessitate a curtailment of other very important normal activities, but vital information obtainable should not be longer kept from the mariner on this coast. where the current conditions are. most complicated and strnndings of frequent occurrence. . Early m the fiscal year, in cooperation with the Army engineers, it is proposed! to carry out an extensive and final current and tidal survey of the harbor of New York, for which an appropriation was made by the last Cono-ress. Principal tidal station~ representative 0£ tidal conditions alonothe different stretches of coast will he continued at the following places:

I1.1 order to carry out the field work on currents at intermediate stat10ns on the Pacific coast as previously outlined, it has been fonnd necessary to curtail somewhat the current observations on the light vessels on both coasts. On the Atlnntic coast observations will be .continued only on Nantucket Shoals and Diamond Shoals for the

full year and at Fire Island, Ambrose Channel, Scotland, and Cornfield Point Light Vessels for the period of the current and tidal survey of New York Harbor. On the Pacific coast current observations will be discontinued temporarily at all light vessels except Blunts Reef. Observations on all the vessels on the Pacific coast however, will be resumed when the survey vessel begins observation~ at intermediate points along the coasts. It is part of the program of the tidal and current work for this fiscal year to continue the installation of standard staffs and backing pieces to replace the old type staffs at all the principal stations maintained by the survey. In order to maintain a fixed zero of staff, a most essential matter in securing 91, long series of tidal observations, tide staffs of standard design with special backing piece, cap, and stop were designed in this division in 1920, and installations of these are being made as the different stations are visited, until all the principal stations are so equipped. It is planned to have a party visit the locations of as many tidal stations and discontinued tidal stations during the fiscal vear as the modest appropriation will permit for the purpose of leveling to old nonregulation bench marks as they may be recovered and installing su~cient standard disk be.nch. ~arks to comply with the present pohcy of the bureau of mamtammg five bench marks at all stations havino- a year of observations and one additional for each additional year ~f observations to a maximum of 10 disks. .This work is a?solutely necessary in order to perpetuate long. senes of observat10ns which are now protected by a few nonregu.lat10n bench ma.rks, many of which have been destroyed and others m danger of bemg lost. Datum planes for the use of the e1:1gineer and mariner based on tidal definition are the only ones which lend themselves to coordination of surveys widely distributed and subsequently brought together. The survey has for many :years by means of its principal and subsidiary tidal stations established bench marks and is :furnishing to en¢neers in all parts of the country descriptions and elevatio:n.>HJf such bench marks based on mean sea level. Since an accur~te determination of mean sra level can be obtained only from a ('-'Vnparatively long series of obsel'\'ations, the value of such bench marks and the importance of their preservation is apparent. . It is a part of the program of field work to reestablish the tidal station at Atlantic City, N . · J., which was discontinued during ext.ensive repairs to the pier on which the station was loca~ed. The importance of this station lies in its being the only stat1011 at present maintained by this survey on the open ocean. . It is proposed to maintain a tidal stati.on at Wasl;ii~gton,, D: C,, for the purpose of testing, under the immediate super".is10n ?f. tlus office, new instruments and appliances fo~ the o?serva~10n of ~ides. The hiring of an observer for this stat10n durmg tln~ :year is not contemplated, but to use the station under the sup.erv1s10n of this office only at surh times as tests of instruments are m progress.

[Lieut. Commander H. A. SERAN, Commanding Steamer Bache.] SUMMARY OF I<ESULTS.-Tt·iangulation: 3 stations in main scheme occupied for borl'ZOnta measures. '.ropography: ~6 miles of. shore li!1e surveyed. Hydrography: 1,550 miles of area. covered; 2,926.8 miles run wlule sounding; 45,655 sounrl!ngs made.

The resurvey of the approaches to Chesapeake Bay, under instructions dated February 8, 1921, was in progress on .July 1, 1021, and continue<.! until October 5, 1921. On this latter elate the command of the Bache was transferred to Eoline R. Hand. . The field work executed in this period consisted of launch hydrography, ship hydrography, topograpl)ic traverse for location of signals, an<.! intersel'tion triangulation to locate signals. The hydrography, consisting of launch inshore hyurography, ship inshore hydrography, an<.! Rhip offshore hyurography, was extc>nded from the limits mentioned in the annual report of June 30, 1921, to the latitude of Hog Island Lighthouse. 'l'his area extenils from latitude 38° 08' to la.titude 37° 20' an<.! from longitude 74° 30' to the shore line about 75° 45'. All hydrogrl'lphy has been completed and all shoals in this area have bec>n developed, giving a finished survey of this area. The launch hydrography wrts extended from shore to about the 3-fathom .curve and from the vicinity of Cape Charles Lighthouse to Hog Islanu Lighthouse. A close clPvelopment was made on the approach to Ship Shol'll Inlet and Great Machipango Inlet. The ship hydrography extended from t".be 3-fathom curve to the 100-fathom -curve. In general, the lines were spaced one-quarter mile apart to the 10-fathom curve, a half mile from the 10-fathom curve to the limits of the inshore sheets, 1 mile apart from the outer limit of the inshore sheet to the 25-fnthom curve, and 4 miles from the 25-fathom curve to the 100-fathom curve. The area covered by the ship hydrography is exceedingly irregn~ar, and a great deal of development was necessary, especially along the line of the survey buoys about 12 miles offshore. The development of the 48-foot spot, as called for in paragraph 7 of instructions of February 8 was completed. No shoaler wate_r was f?l~nu at this time than was found in 1919. In developing this area a slightly chfferent procedure was followed from that outlined in the instructions. 'l'he shoal was founu by sounding and a buoy dropped about the mirl<lle of it. 'l'he position of this buoy was determined by precise dead-reckoning methods. Lines were run from this buoy as an origin. Positions on the lines were llN.ermine>tl by a method similar to that outlinecl in Tables 33 nn<l 34 of Howc1iteh's "American Practical Navigator." An observer was stationeu in the crow's nest of the ship and observed the sextant angle between the buoy to the horizon. A table was .compiled using the height of the crow's nest from the water's edge to corresponu with Table No. 34 nwntioned previously. A launeh was maue fast to the buoy

and fill ob:sener stationed in the launch to obsene the sextant angle. between the fore truck of the ship and the water line. A table was compiled using the distance of 70 feet to correspond with Table No. 33, mentioned above. 'These angles Wl're observed simultaneously ut a signal from the ship. A mean of the distances, as found by these two methods, wns taken as the distance between the ship and the buoy at the time of observation. The direction ·of the buoy from the ship at the time of the sextant observation was observed by stan<lard compass. Using this method it was possible to control very accurately the position of the sounding lines with reference to the buoy and by plotting the soundings as the work continued and drawing in a depth curve very satisfactory development was made. . A similar procedure to this was used in developing another sl\ORl to the northward and considemhly outsi<le the limit of visibilit~· of either shore signals Qr buoys. In order to complete the hydrography to the latitude of Bog Islund Lighthouse, u tall hvdographic signal was necessary ut the southern ernl of Parramore Island. This signal was built by n detached party living ushore. This signal was about 110 feet high and was completed during the first two weeks in September. A truYerse was mu with plane table to locate the tull llydrogruphic signal built ut the southern end of Parramore Island. 'I'his traverse was started from Hog Island Lighthouse. As there were no fixed positions ayuilable for tying this tmverse in at the northern end. the traYerse was run with more than the usual care uml the position of the shmal wus checlrnd h)· sextunt cuts from offshore. 'l'his plant' table work was clo11e by an officer of the vessel. The signals hetwepn Ship Shoal Inlet und Hog Island, three in number, were locuted by triangulation cuts from Cape Charles Lighthouse, Mockhorn Island, and Hog Island Lighthouse. 'l'he launch hyclrog"raphic party, topographic truverse party, signul buil<ling party, and triungulation party were subsisted ushore 1luring the entire time they were engaged in these operations. The uutomutic tide guuge was continued at Assateague Harbor. In addition to the Assateague Harbor tide station, the title staff on Fisherman's Island was continued. 'I'he same type of survey hnoy as was 1lescrihed in spedal report of Angnst 1B, 1921, was used this season. Some difficulty was experie1wed in maintaining the buoys during tile storms. Se,·eral went adrift and were lost. It is thol!g'ht that the anchor pemlunt had parted, prohnhly through twh;ting, ns ·-One lmoy picked up toward the end of the season showed that this ha<l huppe1w1l. In all, nine survey buoys were built during the season, uud at the date of trunsfer of conuna1!d five were still in po~itiou. In accordance with vuragra_ph 9 of im;tructious of l·'ebruary 8, considerable work was dm!P in testing the radio compass bearings from Hog Isluml, Virginia Benl'l1, n11<l l'o~·nern Hill. At points where the position of the ship was known by tltrec-point fixes, bearings were obt11ined at frequent intel'vuls, while on the deud-r<·ekouing lines/oft'sliore bearings were obtitined at. each anchorage, 'The errors of these bearings were tabulated and were forwarded each week to the 1listrict co11m11111ication superintendent at the naval operating base, Norfolk. Jn the lntter purt of August. after a thorough inspection of the raclio cmupass :.:t.ntiom; by the uaval authorities, it was deciclell to rPbnilcl nil of them and no furtlwr work along this line was done. The results obtained previous to that time had heen very unsatisfactory, the errors being widely <lis1!rlbuted for no HJl]larPnt reason. Plotting these errors was tl'ied both aceor<l· mg to distunces nllfl ncC'or11ing to azimuths, hut the resulting curves were so irr?gular thnt Hw~· conlcl 11ot be stallflardizell with sufficient accuracy for the rigid requirements of tile work. l<'rom the results obtained, however, the radio compass stations mentioned herein nppear to he sufficiently nceurate for a n.angator's rrnrpose uml he could enter the Ch.esapeake Ca{les with a combination of radio direction positinns and soundings without fear.

The naval radio compass station at Folly Island was located by triangulation and a distant object was located for the calibration of the compass station. In order to provide control in the vicinity of 8tono Inlet and to locate stations along the coast between North Edisto River and Stono Inlet, the quad1ilateral Charleston Lighthouse, Bass, Key, and Ville was observed in aecordance with the requirements for tertiary triangulation. This gave a correct location for stations Kiawah and Ponds . . '.!.'he topography done during this period included the mapping of the shore hne and contiguous territory to about a mile in from the shore, including creeks, iulets, sloughs, low-water line where possible, and shoals offshore along the coast as follows: Connecting with work done during the previous season, along the coast from Kiawah Inlet to the Quarantine Station; Charleston Harbor, including both jetties; the shores of Stono Inlet and River to the junction of the Stono and Kiawah Rivers; the shores of l~olly River to the new highway bridge over the river; the shores of Lighthouse Inlet; and one day's work at Hobcan Point, Charleston Harbor. The hydrography included the area along the coast from Kiawah Inlet, connecting ·with worlr done during the previous fiscal year to the north jetty at Charleston Harbor, extending from the shore line out to a junction with the work by the steamer Isis, about 4 miles offshore, except for a small area left unfinished; inside work in the Stono, Jfolly, and Kiawah Rivers and Stono and Lighthouse Inlets; a large piece of close development work in the entrance to St. Helena Sound; completing the work in the North l<;disto River, some of which had been done in the previous fiscal year; and some work just inside the entrance. · In general, the coast hydrography was extended into all inlets of any importanee to u distance of at least a mile or to a point where the depths were unchangeable. Developments were carefully nrnde where the presence of shoals was imlil'ated, and whenever shoals bare at low water were found a special effort was made to locate the low water on them. An automatic title gauge was established nt Lighthouse Inlet and staff gauges at Peters Point, Edisto Sound, and Folly Island in order to obtain tidal corrections for the reduction of soundings. At each station the bench marks were recovered and new ones established where necessary and were connected with the tide stafl' by leveling. At Stcmo Inlet extensive changes were found to have taken place in the shore line and soundings, so that the inlet had little resemblance to the representation of it shown on the chart.

Hydrography: 110.6 square m!Jes of area surveyed; 792.4 miles of soundings run; 3.287 positions determined (double angles); 26 515 soun,dings made; 1 tide station estubllKbed; 3 pPrmnn<'nt bench marks established; 2 current stations occupied; 3 hydrogruphic sheets completed.

On .Jul~· 1 work was in progress by the party on the launch Elsie in making combined sur,·e~'S along the outer coast from Charleston entrance to the northwarll for the purpose of' obtaining the necessary data for publishing new charts of this area. The field work included. .the mapping of the entire shore line from Charleston to the east entrance pomt of Bull Bay, and the hydrography from the shore out to a junction with the offshore h~·drography executed by u;e steamer nachc in 1917. The topographic and h~'drographic work were carried up each inlet, creek, and slough until !~ .iuuction w.as made with the ol<ler surveys. All shoals were carefully examrnel~ to obtam 1hP least depth over them, and all inlets were developed to ascerta111 the depth over the bars. The work aceomplished on this project is mapped on two topographic and two hyclrogruphic sheets. Detnile<~ descriptions of all changes found, methods employed, etc., were given 01 i separate reports covering these sheets. During the month of July, while workin¥ in the v_icinity of Charleston, current observations were made by the party m the ma n entrance channel to the harbor in accordanee with special instructions f?r this work. Approximately ~O ~ours of observations were obtained at a station near the outer end of the Jettws. A detaJed report covering this work was subm'tted. 011 October 8 the launch Mikawe was also turned over to this party in accordance with instructions from the director dated October 4. \York was continued by the party on the Mika 1ce in completing the survey from Charleston

to the southward and in revision work in ChaHeston Harbor. '.l'he party on the launch Elsie, after completing the outside survey to the northern limit was combined with the party on the Mikaioe to complete work in Charlesto~ Harbor. Revision work in Charleston Harbor consisted in (1) determining the changes. which had taken place by making a careful inspection of the area and by consultation with officials in Charleston; (2) revising the shore line where changes were found to have taken place; (3) locating new prominent objects by triangulation; ( 4) running sufficient sounding lines to determine the amount of sounding required to bring the chart up to date; (5) making special investigations called for in the instructions for this work. A considerable number of changes were found in the shore line and it was found necessary to' remap. the greater portion of the area. These changes were described in detail in the report aceompanying the topographic sheet. All field worl' was completed on November 5, and. in accordance with instruetions, the launches JJlikawe and Elsie were hauled out and stored, the crews discharged, ofiicers detached, and the launches turned over to a ship keeper. . Special instructions were issued to the chief of party on August 4 to supplement the main scheme of triangulation extending from Charleston to Cape Romain with enough additional work to place a station in the viciI1ity of each of the stations lost, provided that this work did not interfere with hydrographicworlr. As the weather was -exceptionally favorable for hydrographie work subsequent to the receipt of the instructions it was not possible to replace all of the lost stations with nmv ones. However, enough new stations were established and permanently marked so that it is now possible to obtain a strong base distant not more than 5 miles from any point in the area. All new stations. were located with the same accuracy that the original stations had. Station Middle, which was reported lost in 1919, was recoyered as described. With this sl:'.ition and the new ones established there are now 10 of the 16 stations. in the main scheme permanently marked and easily reco".erable .. It was found possible in conueetion with the topograplnc work Ill the vicinit~· of Bull Bay to revise the topography of the inside route, wherever discrepancies were fonnd between the actual and the charted shore line. The majority of the discrepancies occur at the junction of the dredged cuts and the streams. which they connect. In reality the inside passage in this particular locality is more essential and of more importance to the public than the outside coast. All changes and corrections to the chart as regards the insidP route were fully described in the reports accompanying the sheets. For the reduction of soundings on the coast work, tide staffs were established at Dewees Inlet and in Bull Harbor. Both stations were close to the outside coast and the tides at the staffs and on the outside are practically simultaneous. The reference plane for the staff at Devt'ees was obtained by simultaneous observations with a gauge at Fort Sumter. This refen·nee plane was also checked to the nearest tenth of a foot by a mean of 76 low waters. The reference plane for the Bull Harbor staff was obtained by simultaneous observations with the Dewees Inlet staff. For the reduction of soundinFs in Charleston Harbor the record of the automatic gauge at the customhouse wharf was used. . . Three permanent standard disk bench marks were pstablislled at each of the new tidal stations.

Along a line extending south between South Pass and Southwest Pass the 1:ilope of the bottom from 20 to 100 fathoms is quite regular. There is a gradual widening of the distance between the 20, GO, and 70 fathom curve upon approaching the line south-southwest from Southwest Pass. Out from the 70-fathorn curve south-southwest of Southwest Pass there is an abrupt slope which apparently marks the limit of the contihental shelf. A bank of 32 fathoms, consisting of small loose coral rock, wus found near the toe of the bar between the 60 and 70 fathom curves.

During the spring of J922 a scheme of triangulation was extended along the coast o.f Louisiana with a view to tying in rigfdly all survey work in the Mississippi on the North American·tlatnm. The results of the triangulation as determined prior to the adjustment of the net pince positions on the outer end of the delta 0.1 second to the northward and 0.6 second to the westward of their positions as computed approximately on the North American dntum. The scheme starte~ from the hase Biloxi Lighthouse-Ship Island Lighthouse and >:us extended m 1921 by the party on the Hydrographer to the base triangulation Snble-Batleclore-Breton. 'L'he portion covered by this abstract was done in the spring of 1922 and extends from the above-ziientioned triangle to the base South Pass Lighthouse-Southwest Puss Lighthouse, at the outer end of the delta. A base line 3.7 miles in length was measured on the cast bani' of the Mississippi IUver just northwest of Quarantine, La. The base wns measured on two da~·s, one complete mensurernPnt being made on each day.

On .January 1,,1922, the Bache was engaged in hydrographic surveys in the Gulf of Mexico in the vicinity of the Chandeleur Islands under instructions of November 8, 1921. vVork was continued under those instructions through the winter ~enson uml until May 17, when the vessel returned to Gulfport preparatory to going north. In addition to the work accomplished in the locality mentionerl, a beginning was mucle on the hytlrography about Breton Island, and a few lines 'were run off South Pass Light, uo;ing the submarine sentry, in an ineffectual search for reported shoals in that locality. Some topography was done in the Chandeleur Islands but not of the groups inside. The mapping of Breton Island was done while the boat sounded in the vicinity, and at the same time a small amount of triangulation was done for the use of the steamer llydrographcr. The precise dead-reckoning operations were carried out so as to properly cover the area out to the work done by the previous party that had sounded down from the north, or to the 100-fathom curve beyond the limits of that finishell part. As the east and west lines approached the area off the river mouths it became difficult to estimate and allow for the current changes. Buoys of a simple design were utilized outsille the limit of visibility for shore signals. ·while the Bache was undergoing repairs at Norfolk in June a 90-foot signal was erected on the coast about 5 miles below Virginia Beach, and a preliminary location of it was made by topographic methods. An automatic tide gauge was established at Fishermans Island, Carie Charles.

The revision work of the south shore was done directly on bromide copies of the original tovographic sheets. This was fotmd to be unsatisfactory as: the original survey was so old that many changed features were shown on the charts that did not show on the original sheets. The bromides were also· much distorted. Blue prints of the industrial plants on the south shore of the bay were· obtained and were forwarded with the topographic sheets of the locality.

A complete hydrogrnphic survey was made, the inshore work and creeks on a scale o:r 1: 10,000. and the hay pro1wr on 1: 20,000. The complt'te survey was necessitated by the uncertainty :md irregularity of the change in the bottom. The lines were spaced 100 to 200 meters apart and crossed by Jines onequarter to one-half mile apart. All soundings over 4 feet were talrnn with the hand lead. Those under that were usually taken with a pole marked in half feet. A lead line with a bronze metal core was nsed for both the ship am! l:lunch work. Tliis was fonnrt to be far better than the sash-cord lines, and required no correction on nccount of shrinking or stretching. 'l'Jie ship did the work into the 5-foot cune, the inner portions of this at liigh tide. An automatic tide gauge was kept in operation at R<'fugio Lan!ling. Plain stuffs were established at McNears Landing, Black Point, Lakeville, Petaluma Creek Quarry drawbridge, Sonoma Creek, Crockett, l\Jnre Island. railroacl drawbridge across Nnpa River and Napa.

hydrograpby: 7 sea stations occupied for observa-

Instructions issued to the commanding officer of the Surveyor in November, 1D21, called for observations of surface ancl subsurface currents, water densities and temperatures, measurement of veloeity anll direction of the wind, notations regarding the condition of the sea and diredion of the swell, and samples of water at the surface, at half <le1)th, and at bottom. The ship was to be anchored at the stations mentioned below: Station A, Straits of Juan de Fuca south of Point Sheringham, near the 100-fathom curve; Station B, off Gray~ Harbor, Pacific Ocean, at or near the 100-fathom curve; Station C, off the mouth of the Columbia RiYer, near the 100-fathom curve; Station D, at or near the edge of Hecete Bank; Station liJ, south of Cape Blanco; Stations D, C, B, A, to be reoccupied in the ortler given for lengths of time correspontling to those of the first set. '.rile instructions were carrietl out except the occupation of Station E and the reoccupation of Station B, \Yhich were omitted in accortlance with telegraphic instructions. On January 12 the ship left the yard of the Winslow l\larine Railway & Ship Building Co., and proceeded to Seattle for supvlies, fuel, etc. On January 18 current work "·as started nt Station A and completed on January 19. On January 20 observations were started at Stntion B and completed on January 27. On Jnnuary 28 obsel'\"alions were starterl at Stati<·n C nn<l compl<'te<l on February 4. Operations were stopped here as the wire-anchor cable had been lost. The ship proceeded to Astoria for equipment. On l<'ebruary 18 the ship left Astoria. occupied Station D on I·'ebruary 19, and completed observations on February 2G. On :)J'ebruury 27 the ship was at Station C again. On Murch 2, owing to Hn acci(lent to till' andioring equipment and loss of gear, the vessel again went to Astoria. Operations were resumed on Marcil 4, using a 1,200-pound mushroom and rope in anchoring. 'l'his was afterwards backed by a 750-pouud kedge and additional weights, but these were not suft1cient to keev the vPssel from dragging nnd the Yessel again proceeded to Astoria on March 10. Observations were resumed at Station A on l\Iarch :W am! were cornplcteu on Murch 21. The tide gauge was removed from Port Angeles the bench marks connected by a line of levels with tide gauge, nnd the vessel proceeded to Port 'l'ownsend and thence to Seattle on March 22. The work of observing currents proceeded rapidly and there were no interruptions due to the ship's leaving the station on account of bad weather. There· wPre no vio!Pnt storms, but moderate gales were of frequent occurrence. Various tests were made during the work to determine the accuracy of the· current meters used. In the Columbia River current observations were made· with the Price and Bkmnn rneten; nnd the current pole. 'l'hese were unaffected hv rolli1w nurl pitching ns the water was calm. 'l\>sts were also made of the hyd{·ometer~ used in determining water densities. Where the shore wns visible the ship's position was determined by sextant angles to objects whose position:< were known, otherwise astronomical fixes were obtained. iVhere only one object wns vi:;;ible, or when on!~· one object could be recognized, true bearings to it were tnken.

On November 21, 1921, all work ball been completed to a junction with the previous work on this al'c near Allmquerque, N. l\lex. Due to the fact that a large number of lligb s:gnals \vere requirt~d on this part of the arc, especially on the eastern end, the building part~· was unable to keep far enough in auvance aml it became necessary fol' the obsening party to move to the western part of the scheme, where only stands were needed at most of the stations. This made it possible to complete the observations at the high mountain stations before the beg;nning of cold weather and snow. Several heavy winds during the season causell consid('rable damage to tile high signals. Two !).'J-foot signals were blown down. Observing was made possible during more moderate winds by stretching canvas on the windward side of the observing scaffold to protect the tripod. Other difficulties encountered were impassuhle roads, due to excesRive !'ainfall, which made long detours necessary, and sand storms. Good progress was made, however, anll excellent triangle closures were obtained. One base line about 8 miles in length was measured during the enl'ly purt of November, 1921, near Vega, Tex. Four automobile trucks were used for the transportation of the observing party, light keepers, and equipment.

For the remainder of the line the former hnd charge of the reconnaissance, observing, and building, and the latter had charge of the tape measurements and leveling, but helped with the observing near the end of the season. At Duluth the traverse was connected with the precise triangulation of the lake survey. Several bench marks of different types were set in 'Vest Duluth for the purpose of investigating the action of frost on concrete posts. After the work had been completed to Duluth a branch traverse line was run from Ladysmith southeastward to Wisconsin Rapids, Wis. Automobile trucks, supplemented by hand velocipede cars, were nsed in transporting the parties and equipment. In most places the highways were so convenientlv located in relation to the railroad track that it was seldom necessary to mal~e use of the velocipede cars. The season's work was completed about October 20, 1921.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The country through which the western half of the scheme extenus is heavily wooded and, therefore, would require tall signals and much cutting for triangulation. After the reconnaissance for triangulation had been completed as fal' as llainy Lake, the party was visted by the assistant chief of tlie division of geodesy, and it was decided, after consultation, to recommend the alternative of preeise traverse from. Warroad, Minn., to Namaukan, Narrows, a distance of about 165 miles, of which 100 miles is along a railroad and the remaintlel' on llainy Lake and other lakes to the eastwartl. It was thought that the traverse oYer the lakes could be made readily while they were covered with ice. Tlle reconnaissance was made for that part of the traYerse wllich extends across the lakes. From Loon Lake to the eastern en(J of the Rcheme only a preliminary reconnaissance for triangulation was made, as the ruggedness of the country and the difficulties of transvortation are so great that a larger and better equiJ)ped party is necessary to make a thorough reconnaissance. '.rransportation of the party was by automobile between the Lake of the Woods and International Falls, by motor launch between International Falls and Loon Lake, and by canoe between Loon Lake and the eastern end of the scheme. On his way bacl' to the Washington office the chief of party made an inspection trip by train along a proposed arc of precise traverse or triangulation between 'l'unnel City, Wis., nnd Spring Valley, Minn.

Signal building along the arc of precise triangulation whkh extends from Pecos, Tex., to Pueblo, Colo., was started on I1'ebrunry 1, 1922, and was completed on June 30, 1922. Seyeral tall signals were built along this arc, the tallest being 75 feet high and having a 20-foot superstructure. A ![-ton truck was use<l for the transportation of the party, but much of the heavy building tackle was sent from station to station by freight as the truck was not heavy enough to carry eYerytliing needed by the party. These freight shipments were sometimes lute in arriving aml delayed the party at a few stations as they made it necessary for the cl!ief of vurty, wliile ttwaiting the tackle, to go out of his way to other stations where only stands were required. 'l'he party made rapid progress throughout the season, however, and the aYerage cost per vertical foot for buillli11g the signals, including the salary of the chief of party, was only $3.30.

This arc is a part of the project for carrying the North ~merican datum into western Canada and Alaska in cooperation with the Geodetic Survey of Canada. All of the stations on this arc are either on islands or on the shore of Puget Sound. 'l'he party, therefore. used a launch during the entire season for moving from station to station and for transporting lumber for the signals. ,As the lines were short no light keepers were used, but lights were posted each night by the observing party. In his season's report the chief of party recommended clock-controlled electric signal lamps for worl{ of this kind.

On July 1, 1921, work was in progress near thP northern end of the line of precise levels extending from Green River, Utah, to Flagstaff, Ariz., whiCh was being done at the request of the U. S. Geological Survey. The line completed by this party extends across desert country to Hall's crossing and along the ' bottom of Glenn Canyon to the "Crossing of the Fathers," where the party working from the southern end of the line was met and the work of the season completed. This line of precise levels is probably the most difficult one in the history of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, especially the part through Glenn Canyon. ·~he work in the canyon was begun about September 1 and was completed on November 11, during which time 84 miles of levels were run. For this part of the work two 18-foot rowboats, equipped with Evinrude motors. and an 18-foot canoe were used for transportation. The canoe proved much more efficient than the boats, which were too heavy to be handled in swift current. As n matter of precaution two complete sets of instruments were carried, one set in each of the rowboats, and the original records were always carried in one boat antl the abstracts in another. No serious accidents occurred on the trip, although they ,vere avoided by narrow margins several times. Many unusual conditions and difficult situations hnd to he met by unusual methods of leveling. It was nece:<sary many times to take very long sights and often impossible to balance tile bucksights and foresights. Tapes had to he used instead of rods over some of the cliffs, and logs of driftwood were used as rod supports for turning points in quicksand. The U. S. Geo.logh'al Survey cooperated in this work by furnishing the rowboats and paymg the party expenses. The U. S. Const and Geodetic Survey furnished the two automobile trucl{S for the desert work and paid the salary of the chief of party.

The party started at Flagstaff, Ariz., and worked along the Atchi~on, 'Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad as far as Lees Ferry. From Lees l!'erry the line followed the bottom of Glenn Canyon. On November 11, 1!)21, the party workin.~ from the northern end of the line was met at the "Crossing of the Fathers," Utah in Glenn Canyon, and the work of the season completed. Th~ line through the canyon was run in accordance with special instructions "Permitting Jong sights, inequality of sights, larger closing errors, <louble-rodcled lines, the use of tapes for rods, and various other e:iq)edients made nece.~sary ?Y the character of the topography.

In spite of all difficulties. however, the work was carried through to completion with a very small. clos'ng error. The party was in the canyon from October 1 to November 11, 1921, during which time 40 miles of levels were completed. The U. S.

Between .July 8 and November 5, 1921, a line of precise levels was run from Portland, Oreg., to 'Vallula, \Vash., along the south bank of the Columbia River, and another line was run from Bend to Princeville, Oreg. On both lines connections were made with all U. S. Geological Survey bench marks that could be recm·ered. 'l'he level line along the Columbia River follows the Oregon-\Vashington Hailroad & Navigation Co.'s lines. The river flows in a gorge for practically the entire distance, and tile railroad, which follows the gorge, has many sharp curves. Although the Columbia River Highway is parallel with tlle railroad for most of the way, it is in many places several hundred feet almost vel'tically above the railroad. Two automobile trucks were used forthe transportation. If possible, it was planned to finish each day's work at a place where the highway is accessible from the railroad. Between Umatilla, Oreg., and 'Vallula, Wash., the roads are not sufliciently accessible to the railroad, and motor velocipede cars were therefore used instead of the trucks. 'J'he new invar precise level gave very satisfactor_tr seiTice on this work. It tended to reduce the amount of. rerunning necessary and to prevent an: excessive divergence between the backward and forward runnings.

In addition, several tidal bench marks. along the Hudson River were connected to the precise level net. On the hue from Rouses Point to Troy Sl miles of precise levels were run. The party used a if-ton truck for transportation. During the periods when the truck was undergoing repairs use was made of railroad trains and hired cars. The outfit and equipment were kept as small as possible. For the greater part of the work only four men, in addition to the chief of party, were used. These men were _the recorder, who also held the sunshade for the instrument; the truck driver, who also searched for old bench marks and set new ones; and two rodmen. Special precautions were taken to guard against errors in reading the rod and recording, as the purpose of the checl' levels was to find small errors. There were no large blunders in the lines.

On April 18 the ship left the yard of the Seattle Shlplmllding & Drydocl;: Co., where repairs bad been made. On April 19 the ves!>Cl was fumigated at Port Townsend, Wash., und at 9 p. m., April 22, ti~d up at the lighthouse dock ut Ketchikan, .Alaska. Repairs to the Cosmos we1"e started on April 24. After spending u week ut Ketchikan authority was requested to have the work don(· under contract. This was authorized. The contract time wus 14 days. · On May 4 the party proceeded to the working grounds. Only one la·uuch (the small steamer) was operating. The other gas launches (Including the motor saller) were not ready for field work. · It was not practicable to resume work where left off during October, rn21, as launches were necessary for that purpose. Triangulation was started in the vicinity of Warren and Coronation Islands, as the sen·ice of the entire party could be used on this class of work. The urea was unsurveyed and care had to be exercised Jn navlgntlng, causing dellly, and cons!derable time wag lost by the parties going Jn pulling boats to and from the ship. Some ve!·~· fine weather for offshore hydrograplly could not be taken ud,·untage of. On Muy 22 the S11rt'eyor returned to Ke~chlkan. On this date the Cosmo1s was received from the contractor. It was not desirable to IeaYe in an unfinished condition the work which hud been started, so this was compl,ete1l. About June 10 launch work was resumed where left oft' during 1921. At the end of June parties were Jn the field as speclfiecl below: One hydrographic party on the Cosmos working in the vicinity of Cape Addington; one hydrogruphlc party, using· steam launch No. 41, In the Anguilla, Islands; one hydrographlc party, using u gas launch, In the Anguilla Islands; one hydrographic purey on the ship. The following was accomplished during the season : Topographic survey of Warren Island completed; hydrographic survey of Warren Cove completed;· triangulation along the outer coast of Coronation Island c:qmpleted, but on account of defective reconnaissance the scheme was carried :forward through a single trlangle--it will be strengthened by another triangle;· but ·very" ta'.vbr-' able weather conditions will.be necessary before this cnn he cloi1e; trhi.ngulatioil from Fairway Island down Coronation Channel to Noyes Island completecl; triangulation in the Anguilla. group to locate signals for hydrographlc work; hydrography In the Anguilla group well under way ; hydrography along the outer coast of Noyes Island practically completed; ship hydrography in the vicinity of the Anguilla Islands in Coronation Channel and southwest from Coronation Island in progress. An automatic gauge was in operation in Ste~m boat Bay, Noyes Island. One Ude staff was read in the Angullla Islands. . Deellnometer observations were made ut the trliingulation stations. Inspection of a chart agency was made at Craig, Alaska. A few sounding llnes were run.over the area. between Coronation and Ha11y Islands. Depths varying from 85 to 50 fathoms were found, and distant from big Hazy Isle, less than one-quarter of a mile, a depth of 30 fathoms was obtained.

from North Islund to Skagway. Portions of this scheme are widely scattered and much of it does not correspond to the other classes of work. In coordinating this work with the other operation difficulty was experienced throughout the season except for the area ~n Lynn Canal, and even here the drag work had to be slowed down so as not to get too far ahead.. Magnetic ivorlc.-After July 1, 1921, l:uagnetlc observations were made at numerous ·triangulation stations. Unfortunately, the necessary ~rlangulation in. the vicinity of Bulnes was not completed until late in September, when a magnetic survey of tbe area affected by local disturbances· could not be accomplished. While the effect ls slight In comparison with that at Port Snettisham, the urea affected is considerable and apparently includes Portage Cove. Observations fol' declination were made at 25 well-distributed stations in Lynn Canal. Evidence of local attraction was obtained at only one station. Of the scheme of observations planned for Gastineau Channel only four stations eould be completed. Sweep and drag work.-During the past two seasons' work there has developed the following conception of the problems to be met in this class of surveying. All of the area on the coast of Alaska can be divided in three parts: Fll'st, deep, open area in which there ls little likelihood of the existence Of shoals ; second, deep urea inshore or In the vicinity of known shoals; third, alongshore area or shoal area where the known depth ls generally less than the maximum depth Yerlfied by the drag. The provision of an effective means of .. covering. each class of urea with the greatest speed ls the outstanding accomplishment of this seuson. Taking all the various classes in order, the sweep as now perfected, with proper apparatus, is beyond question the best for covering open areas rapidly. It was proved during this season that· the posslblllty of covering very large· arens in short time is limited only by the possibility of determining the neces. 111»'.Y control points on the shore. Without any attempt to make a record, an area of 45 square miles was covered on each of several days using. the 15,000fQQt sweep, but ·only the fact that the urea of this class to be dragged this sel$<>n. was limited prevented the use of the 25,000-foot sweep from being operated day and night. It is sufficient to say that if this method had been available at the beginning of the drag, work a full season's work could Probably ... have been saved.. and last season's drag work could have been finished in abO\lt.. 6 weeks. In this class of work the sweep can be aided by two launches or, if 'C11;t111red, the ship and two launches may tow the sweep with resulting greater speed and width. The speed of the sweep varies with the efrectlve width and with 'the currents, but with the 15,000-foot sweep an average speed of 2i statute miles Per hour can be counted on. · ··Qlbe second class of1:area·.1s that where it ls not found practicable to .tnke the'·1ong l!IWeep into places· where there ls reason to expect a: ·rock may. be found. AceorlUDgly, there wm 'ulways be sPots of deep water for various wl~Uis between the limits of the long sweep and the shore high-shoal water. This area could, Of· course, be <:overetl with the drag at a minimum depth and somethnes ·this Is done. " . Q'hlrd, the area that ·fs left when the ubo\·e-<lescrlbed operations haYe· been co~}l~ted is a long shoal ·survey. of Yarylng widths or general shoal arens surroiinded by · deeper waters. Alongshore area includes that surrounding islands or~ledges. 1'hls urea has.to be covered by the drag, but especially In A.la'*-a there·are many features to be 'considered. The· alongshore areas are geti~ly ragged ·ns In most cases the ·charts arQ lacldng in information necestiary t6>:"tgive desired depth control. Such shoals as have been found by the . inshore eweep work are usually more or less uncertain In depth as shoal development is only incidentally n part of the sweep work. Currents are often stronger and more l'egular in the Ylclnlty of shoals than in the main channels. With the methods nvallable during the season of 1920, the adequate development of the shci11.l area at u speed co1m11ensurate with that of the sweep seemed impossible. With·,the methods <.leveloped during season of 1921, this class or area, coulll be covered quite rapidly, tl10ugh. t~e ultimate possibilities with the npJ)nratus now available have not yet been reached. It ls essential, howeve1·, tha·t p1·ellrui11nry soundings be taken in most plaees in advance ·of .the ·drag work for depth control. 'l'he methods for obtnlnlng the desired depth control ha 'i·e been improved. . . · · . · A very Interesting und important dll!covery of the ·1921 season was due 'to \ the ·eUmlnatlou -of rope from the to\\·llnl! system. It was found. that· whenever a rock Which !s not COVered by t(IO much kelp is struck by the fast-moving

14th.

On April 17 the entire party left Juneau to take up combine<l surveys and wire-drag work in Lynn Cnnal :m<l adjoining inlets. This work was continued until the end of the fiscu l year. Following are the details of the work accomplished: An observing party erecte<l stands, marke<l stations, an<l completed precise observations from the line Wll-Bern, of the 1921 work, to the line Kabe-Slide. After this work was completed the party took up secondary triangulation in Lynn Canul and built signals, marked stations, an<l completed observations from a junction with previous precise trian~rulatlon at the lines Sentinal-Llttle and SentlnelBridget south to the eastern end of Icy Strait. Parties working from the ship extended secondary triangulation from the line Chil-Kabe, of the 1921 work, to the head iof nuvigttt!on In Chillmt Inlet; recovered and rebuilt signals at stations in Chilkoot Inlet north from Seduction Island; recovered the majority of the stations of the 1800 triangulation In Taiy11 Inlet, and connected this with the 1921 work. Two topographic parties operated for the greater part of the time. Control was established by plane-table triangulation in the passage west of Sullivan Island and from the limit of previous triangulation to the head of Chilkoot Inlet. The following work was completed : Shore line and form lines on the west side of Lynn Canal from the vicinity of Sullivan Rock to Pyramid Harbor; form lines on sheet 38.'53 in the vicinity of Point Sherman; shore line and form lines on the east shore of Lynn Canal from a point about east from Eldred Rock to a point opposite Flat Bay; shore line and form lines of Sullivan Island and the Chllkat Islands; topography of the peninsula between Chllkat and Chllkoot Inlets from and Including Kotchu Island In Chllkat Inlet to Battery Point in Chllkoot Inlet; 3 miles of shore line at the head of Chllkoot Inlet ; and revision of form lines In the vicinity of Point Pybus, Stephens Passage. The following wire drag and sweep work was completed : Dragging of splits in previous work in Stephens Pass11ge from Cape Fanshaw to South Island; dragging of William Henry Bay and a small split to the eastward of the bay ; completion of work from the limit of previous work in Lynn Canul north to Skagway. This last work, which was completed on June 27, included the dragging of the passage west of Sullivan Island, Chllkat Inlet, and the passages between the Chllkat Islands. Lines of soundings were run around the shores of Chllkat Inlet, at the bead. of the inlet between McClellan Flats and Pyramid Island, .otl' the north side of the spit west of the south end of Sullivan Island, and around the Katzehin River spit. · For the work .In Stephens Passage observations were obtained at old stations in Hobart Bay and Tuku Harbor. For work in Lynn Canal an automatic gauge was establlshed in Portage Cove on April 20 and operated until Jtine 28, when it was removed. During the course of hydrographic work observations were <>btalned on supplemental statl's in William Henry Bay, back of Sullivan Island, and in Pyramid Harbor. The ship was swung twice to determine the error of the compass, once In Stephens Passage, near Sail Islund, and again in Lynn Canal, west of the Chilkat Islands. Six stations in Chilkat Inlet, seven in Chilkoot Inlet and Station Sed, in Lynn Canal, were observed with the compass declinometer. This work is not yet complete. Declination was observed while cruising at 53 points in Chllkat and Chllkoot Inlets and considerable local attraction was noted in both inlets. , The chart agency at Haines, Alaska, was inspected by an officer. of the party on .June 9.

Alter coallng the necessary work on the launches was begun and the engine of the 4ud10ln was repaired. The .Audwin left Ketchikan March 27, and this party built 9 obser\·lng stands befo1·e the end of the month. As soon as the launches were ready the vessel left Ketchikan uml work was begun on the survey of Ernest Sound on March 31. The launch Audwin took up the precise triangulation of Clarence Strait. while the ship was engaged in the survey of Ernest Sound. Two topogrnphlc parties and one hydrographlc party were kept continuously In the field, and some hydrography was done by the ship. The obsen·atlons on the arc of precise triangulation connecting the work completed in 1921 In Clarence Strait with the worl;: in vicinity of Zare!llbo Island were completed. The scheme used in 1916 was followed closely, the only dmnire being the omission of two stations. 'l'he averairn trlllngle closure WllS 0.76 1:1eco11d, and the maximum a little over 2 seconds.

vlsable to go uhend with these branches of the work without waiting for conditions favorable fo1· getting a position from the peaks and doing the azimuth measurement necessary for projections. It was evident from the reconnaissance that a favorable season would be required to complete the hydrography and no time was lost In starting it. A base line of 1,700 meters was measured twice with an lnvar tape. The results were considered very satisfactory. Expansion from this base was made wltll two. goocl figures in such a way tllat the two figures cont1"ol tile entire ba~· and served to locate sufticlent Intersection stations for topographic and hy<l1·ogl'Uphic control. Plane-table topography was started on the east Rhore of the bay on a scale of 1: 10,000, where the signals located would be of Immediate use for hy1h'ography. By .Tune 30 the topography of the east side was nearly completed. Hydrography wns stu1,ted on .Tune 26. The work inside the bay ls on a scale of 1 : 10,000, while outside the scale Is 1 ·: 20,000. The sounding done during June consisted of a number of widely separated lines run to determine the character of the work and fix the s<:lieme. It ls bel!e,·cd that a good channel has been located. It Is planned to den~lop this first and then the parts of value commercially. An automatic tide gauge hns been established in Rlou· Bn~· on piling driven by the party.

The work of this season, which was one of the combined operations directed by the commanding officer of the steamer Explorer, was partly in chargEl of Lieut. Jack Senior, U. S. Const and Geodetic Suney, who was assisted b~· Ensign A. J. Hoskinson, U. S. Const and Geodetic Survey, und partly in charge of Lleiit; G. C. Jones, U. S.

In order to have the necessary positions for the control of the hydrogruphic work in Lynn Canal, it was necessary to extend secondary triangulation in advance of the precise scheme. '.rills work was in charge of Lieut. A. 0. Ratti, U. S. Const and Geodetic Survey.

REPORT OF DIRECTQR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

cnne moorings for the drag launches in the cove between Ovispo Cay and Zancundo Cay, Fajardo Harbor. , Drag work was commenced on August 9, 1921, and by the latter part of October the area to the eastward of Palominos Island, along Cordlllera·s Reef, through San Juan passage, and alOng the north coast of Porto Rico as far westward as Embarcacleros Point bad been dragged and sounding in the insl10re area ·from Snn Juan Harbor Entrance to Cape San .Tuan had been practically completed. This work had been pushed with considerable vigor o.s It was desired to complete the above area before stopping the work for periodic repairs to the equipment and before the annual stiffening of the trn<lc~. which would prevent, to some extent, effective work in that .area. This work hav.lng' been accomplished the week of October 24 to 30, 1921, was spent at San Juan, P. R., where the two drag launches and the tender were hauled out, paintecl. nnd repaired. The fleet returned to the drag tleld on October 31, 1921, and resmned work in the inside area to the westward of Palominos Island and Largo Reef. By the middle of January the work l!ad practically been completed· as far southward as Cabeza de Perro. The area draggecl is mostl~· rock and coral formntion nnd although a very close !pad stirve~' had been macle, several dangerous shoals were found. In all 84 separate shoo.ls were located and charted. The existence of two shonls previously chnrte<l was shown to have been an error In the previous sul'\'e~·. The 2'-fathom spot, 1 mile Routh of Ramos CaY. was shown to be clear to a dl'pth of 23 feet. The 3~-fnthom ..<pot, about 1~ miles north of Pineros Island, was found clear to a depth of 30 feet. It has previously bPl'll recommended thnt these two soundings be removed from the chart. A major accompl!Rhment of the senson was the 1lragglng to its maximum depth of the ship <'hannel ·around the eastern end of Portp Rico from Cape San .Juun to Cabeza de P<>rro, the results of which work led to recommendations for chnnges In the soiling directions nnrl ilids to· rta'\"lgat,ion ·in that area ln order lo tnlte 'advnntnge of the hest drnft. and avoiO previously u'nciuirted shoals the exlsti~nce of which had Ileen determined by the grounding of lnrge vesimls. · The positions of all signals used in the drug work were dPtermlned by triangulation. The n utomatlc tide station was malntulne<l continuously nt La Plu~·u cle Fajardo nud when not otherwise engaged the Ranger observed currents within the aren dragged. A secondnry accomplishment of the season was the sounding out of the blank ureas on hydrographic sheets Nos. 2874, 2876, 2877, a.nd 2883, In accordance with paragraph 3 of the director's Instructions of June 24, 1921. This area comrirlsed the inshore h~·drography from San Juan Harbor entrance to Cape Snn JQan, ·a distance of nbout 30 miles. The usual method of prosecuting a survey of this cbarncter could not be followed excepting at a considerable sacrifice of. drag work ns It wns normally launch work and the only launches -of sufficient size for this outside work which we1;e available were the drag launches. Such sncrlftce was not warranted either by the relative importance of the work or b~· the Instructions for doing It. To overcome the handicap, it wns decided that the Ranqe1· must he used for doing the larger part of the sounding and that this could be done nfte1· dl'terminlng the outer limits of the dangers to that vessel. To do this a numher of naturnJ .objects were selected for use as signals , nnd such others were !milt all proved necessary to control the work, their positions to be Inter det1'rmi11e1l ns the work progressed. The two drag launches and the tender were then directed to proceed In line formation about 150 meters distance with .the tender on the reef end of the line. In a single day these three lines of soun<llngR were extended from Cape Snn Juan entrance, nnd thus the Inner limits to which the Ra11r1e,. could with caution work were established. The drag launches· were then released for Uielr normal duties. At a later date, 'when the drng fleet was at San .Junn for hauling out, the tender was used to make additional development In the area within reach of San ,Juan.

The field work accomplished included the following: Ea.st coast of Luzon Jsland.-The offshore work between tbe Calagua Islands and Catiinduanes Island was completed. There is an immense bank here with a depth of 80 to 40 fathoms, which extends from SO to 50 miles offshore,.trp~, whence it drops off'. rapidly to deep water. The survey. wa11 carried·out to tbe·. 1,000-fathom curve. Deep:sen soundings were made between Catanduanes Islan<l ancl Samar Island, the approach to San Bernardino Straits. Revision work was executed in the vicinity of Albay Gulf and of Lagonoy Gulf. The shore line of Cacraray, Batan, and Rapurapu Islands, also the south shore of Catanduanes Island, and the southeast coast of Caramuan Penin· sula were resurveyed. A hydrographic survey was made of the water area adjacent to the above-mentioned islands. Su11i Sea.-The survey of. the region around the Cagnyanes Islnnds was completed. ·Numerous shoals lying around Palawan Island were Jocnt.e<l nn<l developed. . . . Surveying operations were in progress on the west const · of Znmboungn Peninsula until the midOle of December, when the strong northeast monsoon . made It impracticable to continue the work. Manila Dav.-At the request of the commandant of the Cavit<· Naval Stntlon, some wire-drag work was done for .the Government in the vicinity of Cochlnos Point and Corregidor Island by the steamer P<f.(hfindcr, which was enguged for 10 days on this assignment. · Gravit11 ·aeterminaticma.-A staUon was occupied at the Manila Observatory for the determination of gravity. ·

At the begiqning of the fiscal year the Pathfiindcr was engaged in field work in continuation of that of the previous season In completing to the 1,000-fothom curve off.shore hydrography from the Pollllo Island group to Catanduanes Island. · There is an extensive bank here, with a depth of 30 to 40 fathoms. extending 40 to 50 miles off.shore, from whence It drops off'. rapidly Into deep water. · Lines were run over thhi bank In a north and south dh'ectlon one-half mile apart, and all sounding was done with the new Coast Survey sounding tubes. Beyond this bank deep-sea sound'.ng lines were extended to the 1,000-fnthom curve at Intervals of from 3 to 5 miles. Two sounding machines were used, one rigged for tube soundlug and the othe!° with piano wire for deep-sea sounding. Both coulcl he used for tube work, so that the work was never held up by broken wire or repalr11 to the machine. '

All of the observations in the scheme extending from Bnsllnn Straits to the island of Jolo were finished, with an average closure of 2.8 seconds. The currents in the locality of the work were found to be very strong, and often run from 4 to 6 knots In the passages between the islands. On l!'ebruary 27 the Pathfinder returned to Manila vlu Zamboanga, arriving Murch 2. On March 9 the transfer of the vessel to the new commanding officer was effected.

Topou1·a.phy.-'rl1e following areas were Included in the topography executed hy the party: . (a.) All of Rnpul'U1m, Ba tan, nnd Cucraray Islands; also the smaller islands of Cagbulauan ai1d Gulnlnyan. ·' ( b) The southern portion of Catandunnes Isluml inland to the first highlands (the sky line as seen from along the coast except for a few distant indivldtial peaks). ( c) The southeast corner of Caramuan Peninsula from Pitogo Buy to Flat and Inland to the first highlancls (the sky line as indicated above). · Sufficient points were established by triangulation, or traverse, to tiupplement the existing triangulation and furnish control' for the topography and hydrography. The usual plane-table methods were employed in this ·topography. Over considerable areas it was impossible to see the Inland country· frol;ll the beach and the contouring had fo be-done by anchoring the ship offshore. Such was the case for the major portion of Hapurapu Island, for considerable areas between Virnc Point and Sialat Point on Cutanduaoes Island, and 'for the , western portion of the topography on Caramuan Peninsula. Several larger streams were located by magnetic traverse run In a boat. . . . . All l1ydrographic signals were located. by the topographer. Alth~ugh the hy.drogrnphy was not executed about the western· portion of the southern coast. of '(:Jatnncluanes Island rill necessary· signals were located in nntlcipat!on of .tll\fl

It wus found that the northeast corner of Rapurupu Islund can be rounded close to with 7-8 fathoms, but the only practical navigation is to clear the shoal areu· in a !llmilar xnunner as indicated on the present charts. The hydrogruphy over the unsurveyed area of the northern entrance to Cacrarny Pass developed un anchorage of ratber limited extent and difficult approach. In Rapurapu Straits several .shoaler spots were found, the most Important· being a 4-fnUiom spot off the entrance to Batan. The new Coast Survey sounding tube was used during the major portion ot the season with decidedly favorable results. 'l'ides.-A tidal record, which was practically continuous for the entire season, was secured on the automatic gauge established at Batan. '.ride stnl'l's were established In Coal Harbor and Cabugno Bay.

The most important accomplishment of the yenr was the completion of the photography of the Mississippi River Delta. This project nad been started Jn the spring of 1921, when the Naval Air Servlce photographed a portion of the area. An attempt was made ·to complete the work Jn October, 1921, but an accident to the plane caused a delay until December, when unfavorable conditions again necessitated a postponement of the project until April, 1922. During April and IIIny 530 square miles were protographl?d, completing the whole portion of the Delta contained within the llmits of Chart No. 194. At the beginning of the fiscal· year. office work was in progress on the 11.rst set of photographs of the Delta. Mosaics were constructed of various section· of the Delta and redµced pb~tographlcaUy ·to the scale of the chart. These reduced photographic mosaics were then· used to compile and up~to-date map of the Delta for the .use of t.be aviator in completing the project. At the same . time an index map wa.s plade, showing the location. of and area covered-by each photograph. The office work on the photographs and also the triangµlatlon computations were completed in September. It was believed that favorable We!ltl1er conditions woura prevail during the fall months, but for the reasons previously inentloned the project was not co.mp\eted until in May, 1922.. During April and May tllghts were made on 16 different days in order to cover the 530 square miles. A prellminury examlna- · tlon' and study of the photographs, which was made In the 11.eld, indicated that satisfactory results should be obtained iii the office reduction. It was found· that there were·a few gaps in·the work; but they w!ll·be covered in another hour's photographic flight. ' Assistance was furnished the division of charts at various times during the year In t1.1e compilation of chart data from aerial photographs and mosaics. The AJ;'IDY and. Navy Air .Ser.vices have furnished the bureau with obliques and mosaics that wm be cif use' In our work. One hundred and sixty oblique views of Important. sections. along. the coast have been received from the Naval Air .Service.. The .same service supplied mapping photographs of A,nnapolls, Md. The Army Air Sen·ice furnished mnpplng photographs of the lower end of. the Susquehanna River. Mosaics .have also been received of Boston, Mass., and Portland, Me. Considerable use has already been made ot some ot these · pbotographs. . .

Suiuu.nY OB' nmsuLTS.-TrlnnguJe.tlon: 8 elevations determined trlgonometrlcally ; 1 geographic position deterln.ined. Leveling: 1 wye level elevation determined.

At the request of the Knpxvllle (Tenn.) Board of Commerce the elevation of Mount I.eConte, a spur of the Great Smoky Mountains, nenr Knoxville, was determined. Work started on June 10 and was completed on June 25, 1922. The elevation of a tower on one of the buildings at the University of Tennessee was determined carefully by wye levels from bench marks In Knoxville and then the elevations of Mount Leconte, and of Mount Guyot, und Cllngmans Dome, which are near Mount LeConte, were determined trlgonometrically from this tower.

[Capt. WILLIAM Bowrn, U. s.

and Geodetic Survey,]

The chief of the division of geodesy attended the triennial conference of the section of geodesy of the International Geodetic and Geophysical Union and also the conference, held at the same time, of the International Astronomical Union, in May, 1922, at Rome, Italy. He attended these meetings as a representative of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and as a delegate from the United States, appointed by the president of the National Academy of Sciences on the recommendation of the National Research Council. In 1919, at Brussels, at au international scientific conference, there was organlzed the International Research Council with a number of branches, called unions. These unions were subdivided into committees or sections. The union which ts of most Interest to the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey is the Geodetic and Geophysical Union. It has a section of geodesy, which will continue the \fork of the old International Geodetic Association, which, shortly after the outbreak of the European war, bad Its designation changed to the Geodetic

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Association Reduced Among Neutrals. At the Brussels meeting Captain Bowie was elected president of the geodetic section and at Rome, in May, 1022, he presided at the meetings of the section. Captain Bowie reported that the meetings of the two unions mentioned above, and especially of the section of geodesy, were very successful. Certain parts of the organization which could not be perfected at Brussels in 1919 were completed at Rome. Provision wlis made for an executive committee o( seven for purely administrative purposes, and a permanent committee, with a representative from each country adhering to the section, which will have legislative functions between the regular conventions of the section. Instead of having a central scientific office, such as existed under the older associations, the section of geodesy adopted the pllin· of having each important branch of geodetic work assigned to some scientist who, on account of his work and the national organization of which he is a member, would be able to correlate· the activities carried on In the several countries in the subject assigned to him. Each scientist to whom work has been thus assigned is termed a reporter. The theory of lsostilsy was assigned to the chief of the diYlsion of geodesy of the U. S. Const and Geodetic Survey. A report in printed form was made by Captain Bowle to the section of geodegy at the Rome meeting which gives in some detn.ll an account of the geodetic work performed in the United States during the 10-year period from January 1, 1912, to December 31, 1921. That report was printed as Special Publication No. 81 of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.

Respectfully,

To Hon. HERBERT Hom'En, · Secretar'!J of Commerce.
