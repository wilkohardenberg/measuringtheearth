INTRODUCTION. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has had during 1922-'23 what is probably its most successful year since its creation more than a century ago. This is due to various causes, all of which have important bearing both on the welfare of the personnel of the service and on the providing of means for carrying on the work of the bureau in a bigger and more efficient mamwr. I feel that it is well to point out the reasons for these successful accomplishments, as well as to stress our more pressing needs, and I shall therefore enumerate them briefly.
RECLASSIFICATION AND SALARY INCREASES.

For many years this bureau, like many other establishments within the Government, has dragged along with a condition of dissatisfaction among its personnel, due to inadequate pay. This condition has caused a steady demoralization and general disintegration of the personnel throughout the bureau. As this situation grew steadily worse year by year, with little hope of relief in sight, the :best men were constantly being drawn away from the service, leaving vacancies that were hard to fill, while those who remained 'vere, in spite of their loyalty to the Government, unconsciously suffering in efficiency because of their constant agitation and concern over their future status and the question of whether or not there would be relief. ' During this long period of unrest repeated efforts were made to secure more adequate salaries for the Government employees-salaries commensurate with the duties which they performed and also on a scale necessitated by the increased cost of living. These efforts met with only slight success until the past year, when the seriousness

of the situa'tion seemed at last to loom up in its true magnitud~, wi~h the result that the reclassification bill, which had been pendmg m Congress for well over a year, was. brought to the fo~·e and it~ prospects t<?ward the close of fast February were very bright. "'Y1th the increasmg sy!npathy of Congress and the ~lear under~tandmg and support of tlns all-important matter by President Hardmg, Congress a~ length actually passed the bill, and the President, on March 4, 1923, signed the important measure. While it was well understood and known by many th~t the b~ll , :was not perfect nor entirely suited to everyone's needs an~ ideas, still it was such a big step in the right direction that its possible defects were more than compensated by the benefits thnt would accrue from its enactment. The whole tenor and purpose of this legislation will,, I believe, remove the /Reneral and just dissatisfaction among the underpaid employees of the Government, thereby improving their morale and raising their standards, so that the most able workers will be attracted to and retained in the service, while those who fail to show their appreciation of what has been done by meeting the new standards will be gradually eliminated through the pressure of their more loval and efficient associates. · It mu"st be understood that the first undertaking of the reclassification board to put this legislation into effect is an extremely difficult and tedious task, viewed from every angle, and with regard to the tentative recommendations of the board it is believed and hoped that the people affected by them will accept them in good part, realizing that this preliminary interpretation of the law will later be adjusted to meet in every respect the just requirements of a proper reclassification and reallocation .. The pas;:;age of this moment.ous legislation unquestionably marks an epoch m the conduct of this iphase of the Government business, as. it '~ill eventually result in a condition of uniform justice that w1l~ bn!1~ contentment to tl.rn. workers, and thereby greatly increase then· efhc1ency and productivity. But there is another outstandin<T phase of this classification legislation which to me is vitttl. Inai much as the departments are charged by Congress with the responsibility of handling their several affairs, and Congress in turn looks to them for the proper results, it is therefore in the interests of good administration that classification and salary matters which a_ffect ~he internal activity of any department, whether in connectioi:i with employees in the District of Columbia or of the field forces. wluch are next to be considered, should be adjusted by that departn;e~~' and not by some commission or board which bears no respons1 b1hty for the conduct of the business of the department-this, of co_ur~e, subject to whatever control and regulation. Congress feels it is best to provide including such advisory agencies as may be necessary to properly coordinate similar positions in different 1 departments.
VALUE OF MODERN VESSELS.

The steamers Disooverer and Pione,er, mentioned in my report of fost year as having been transferred to this bureau from the Navy Department, have been engaged in survey work during the entire

4

year. These vessels have proved economical and efficient surveying units and even better adapted for surveying purposes than was anticipated. The other vessel, the Guide (transferred in the same manner), has been altered to fit her for surveying duty and is now having her final trial before leaving for the Pacific coast. A sonic depth finder has been installed, as well as a subaqueous sound-ranging apparatus for the determination of the ship's position while sounding. These hvo devices will be subjected to thorough practical tests under actual working conditions, and if these tests meet our confident expectations combined use of the two devices will effect a tremendous reduction in the cost of our offshore hydrography. The problem of making hydrographic surveys along the Pacific coast is difficult, as in the winter when clear weather prevails, gales are severe and frequent and a very small percentage of time can be utilized for survey work. During the summer fogs are prevalent nnd the work is greatly delayed and the unit cost incre:tsed thereby. Experiments in the past have been carried on :for the determination of a ship's position from radio comr:>ass stations, but these positions, while adequate for navigation, did not meet the more exacting requirements in accuracy necessary in hydrographic surveying. An officer of this service who had experience in the Navy during the late war in the experiments carried on for the detection of submarines suggested the possibility of the determination of the ship's position by subaqueous sound rang-ing. This officer made an intensive study of the problem and, with the cooperation of the Bureau of Standards and the Army authorities at Fort Wright, devised an apparatus ·which has been constructed by the Bureau of Standards. It is believed that this equipment will serve th~ purpose of accurately determining a ship's position while engaged in sounding during foggy weather. This equipment is now completed and installed, and with it the Guide is the most complete and modern survey vessel afloat.
SPECIAL
SUHVJ<~YS

MADE AT THJ<i REQUES'I' OF THE SECRE'I'ARY OF THE NAVY.

For many years the bureau has made special hydrographic, topographic, and other kinds of land surveys, at the request of the heads of other bureaus and departments of the Government, and a special appropriation has been made annually to this bureau to cover the cost of such work where it could not be charged to any of the appropriations for the support of the usual work of the bureau. Much of such special work has been done for the Navy in recent years, including special surveys of naval bases and projected naval bases and naval rendezvous, determination of geographical positions of and azimuths from radio compass stations, and laying out and marking speed-trial courses for testing naval vessels and hydroplaries. Some of this work has .been confidential and the data suppressed from publication at the reqnest of the Navy. Some of the surveys have appeared on later charts and would have been made eventually even had they not been made the subject of a special request to be taken up immediately for the Navy, and some would never have been m!.J.de by this bureau had they not been requested for a special purposl'I not in line with the usual work of the bureau.

During the past fiscal year the bureau has been. engaged up<?n a larger amount of such work for the Navy than durmg any prev10us fiscal year, not excepting the years of the World ·war. The number of projects undertaken at the request of the Navy has not exceeded that of previous years but the size of the projects, the personnel and equipment involved, ~nd the cost of the work have exceeded those of any previous year. This work includes triangulation, topography, hydrography, both ship and launch, wire dragging, cadt~stral. surveys, and other operations, and covers ~xtensi:e areas. rn widely separated localities. Some of these proJects will reqmre :motl~er year or more for completion. Part of the work is of a confidentml nature.
CON'rINUED COOPERATION WITH CITY ENGINEims, HIGHWAY ENGINEERS, COUNTY ENGINEERS, AND LAND SURVEYO,RS.

The new 'undertaking, as set out in my 1922 annual report, of extending cooperation in making precise surveys to municipalities, an~ cooper·ating with county engineers and local civil engineers is bemg received with more favor and is attaining more results than was anticipated. The laws of a number of States of the Union require county surveyors to standardize their compasses periodically, and to enable this standardization this bureau, as a part of its function of making a magnetic survey of the country has established magnetic stations at most of the county seats of each State of the Union. In the past it has been the practice of this bureau to rely ~or information as to the. sta~e of preservati<?n of these magnetic stations on periodic exammat10ns by field officers of the bureau. Under the cooperative plan extensive ~o~resp~ndence has been carried on wi~h the county surveyors and civil engmeers of a number of States with the end in view of learning from such local surveyors and civil enrrineers the s~ate of preservation of the magnetic stations that have been established and the need of additional stations in areas where there has been considerable local disturbance of the magnetic field. This correspondence has brought to the attention of numerous county surwyors and civil engineers the existence and use of these stations and has enabled this bureau to eliminate the examination of stations that have been reported by local surveyors to be in a proper state of preservation. As a result of this canvass a new publication has bfeen prepared for the State of Arkansas which gives in condensed orm a gr·eat deal of information that is essential to county surveyor~ o~ that State in making and perpetuating surveys ?f lands ~nd e~tablishm~ boundary lines between tracts of land. Sumlar pubhcat10ns .c0Yer111g other States will be issued as rapidly as they can be compiled. ·Another means of brinrring to the attention of county surveyors and civil engineers the dnfil that are essential in making precise surveys and which are availnble from this bureau is the continuance of the preparation and distribution of the Digests of Geodetic Publications-one for each State of the Union. By the use of these digests anyone interested in making land surveys can determine at a gln!lce whether or not. this bureau has established control and elevation

6

points within the area to be surveyed. For example, see illustration No. 1, which is from the Digest of Geodetic Publications for the State of Oregon, and which shows graphically the location of the basic control and elevation points, as well as the magnetic stations that have been established by this bureau within that State. To date a digest has been ;published for each of the following States: Alabama, Arlnmsas, Colorad.?2- Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana; Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming. These digests have opened the way to hundreds of local surveyors to obtain control data for making local surveys, which data are absolutely necessary if the survey is to be standard and free from error. Every mail brings to this bureau a number of inquiries that have their origin in these digests. This cooperation with local engineers and surveyors has awakened a keen interest in city engineers in basing city surveys on standard control and elevation points. The city of Richmond, Va., is just completing an excellent survey of its area, based on points established by this bureau. The city of Greensboro, N. C., has also completed such a survey under the supervision of an officer of this bureau. The chief engineer of the department of public surveys of the city of Columbus, Ohio, is laying out a plan for a precise survey of that city. To assist these engineers and to enable this bureau to supply ·promptly information regarding city surveys, a pamphlet has been published under the title of "Use of Geodetic Controls for City Surveys." This publication contains complete information regarding the making of a city survey.

Most hai;hors consist of a tidal bay or river, but New York Harbor in this respect differs from other harbors, in that it consists not of a single waterway but of a number of communicating waterways which may be entered from the sea through two inlets many miles apart. This gives the leading port of our country a magnificent harbor; but at the same..time the interaction of the tides and currents in the system of communicating waterways constituting the harbor gives rise to a series of complicated current and tidal phenomena. Fifteen thousand square miles of territory have their drainage to the sea through three bays, four straits, one great tidal river, and the several smaller ones which comprise New York Harbor, and the fresh water from this large territory further complicates the movement of flood and ebb. To help in the solution of the problem which the mariner, the engineer, the scientist, and the public generally brought to this survey a precise and detailed knowledge of the tides and currents in these waterways was of first importance. This knowledge of the tidal and current phenomena for New York Harbor is now.available as a result of the comprehensive survey made the past fiscal year jointly by the United States Engineer Department and the Coast and Geodetic Survey. To the navigator bringin~ a giant trans-A~lantic liner .into .Port, the ?urrent t~ble? issued by this survey are an mvaluable aid, smce they mform lnm m advance 0£ the time 0£ slack water, which is 0£ such importance in the berth-

ing of the large ve9sels. The en~ineer engaged in harbor improvement, both of a civil and of a military nature, or in wharf construction can now undertake his work with a better knowledge of the phe~omena accompanying the rise and fall of the tide and the flow and ebb of the current. In the solution of the problems connected with the disposal of sewage in the metropolitan district, the data secured enable the sanitary engineer to plan with fewer uncertain factors. The data of this survey are now being computed and will be correlated with the various scattered observations made at different times in previous years, and the results will be published in a form . most useful to the engineer, the mariner, and the general public.
D1"\"ELOPMENT 01!' NEW INS'l'RUJ\IENTS AND APl'ARATUS.

. It is of striking importune~ to. note the progress made by this ~ureau The results of new mvent10~s and improvements in the bureau's broad field of endeavor tend to m;prove, simplify, and hasten the progress of our w.ork. Many of our mstruments are used by other departments of tlns Government am~ throuO'hout the world. Oul' commissioned officers, in addition to !heir regular duties, are constantly working on questions involving nnprovements in their broad sense. PnEs~unE SOUNDING Tm1E.-There has recently been deYeloped a type of pressure-soundinfl' tube for sounding in depths of 15 to 100 fath<.)lns to a degree of ac~uracy which makes it of value as a surveymg mstrument. Formerly depths obtained by means of pressure tub~s were approximate depths only, adequate for purposes of naviga~10n, but not of sufficient accuracy for charting p1;1.rp?ses. Recent tests ~f the lutes~ development of this tube, however, md1cate that the result~ng soundmgs may be accepted with only occasional vertical casts for purposes of. comparison. . . LBAD Lrn1·c.-For soundino- in depths under 15 fathoms a lead lirie is_ use~. Sash cor~, a closely woven cott?n line, has been use~ alm?st ex;clus1vel.y for thrn purpose. 'While satisfactory from the viewpomt o:f operation, variability in the lenfl'th of the line has made it necessary to a:pply a correction to each ~uuding, and these corrections do not rr;mam constant. A line of metal core is now being nscd which practically eliminates lead-line correction. Au'I'Ol\IA'1:rn SouNDING CwcK.-ln hydrographic surveying the accurate spacmg of soundinO'S between fixed positions depends upon the 0 '.lccurate recording of the time intervals between contiguous soundn~gs. Heretrifore the recorder has been compelled to watch the timepiece and call to the leadsman to make the soundings at the proper mtervals. An automatic sounding clock has been developed by this ~mreau that signals the leadsman by either bell or lio-ht the exact mstant. for the souncli1w o- now the full time of the recorder bl ullowin b t o tie I !mportant. duty of keeping a full and complete record of the surveymg operations. SLIDE-RULE SOUNDING REDUCER.-The O'eneral principles of a cir?Ular slide rule have recently been adapted' to the reduction ?f s.oundmgs from fathoms to feet and at the same time to the apphcat10n of the correction for tide and the lead line, if any. This device, a working m,odel of'which has been completed, is now being manufactured

8

in quantity for the use of hydrographic parties in the field. It is estimated that a saving of about 50 per cent in office work on the reduction of soundings will be effected by this device. WmE DRAG AND SwEEP.-The development of the wire drag and sweep has continued. This is indicated by the fact that an area of 62 square miles has been covered with the sweep in a single working day. It is estimated that the completion of the dragging of the main steamer channels of southeastern Alaska during the present season is at least two years earlier than would have been possible with the methods in use in 1917. DEVIAscoPE.-ln many parts of the hydrographic work reliance is placed on dead reckoning, and a carefully compensated compass is necessary. An improved form of deviascope for use in instructing officers in coml?ass compensation is under construction. A deviascope is a device wluch :permits iron or steel to be brought near a compass under conditions similar to those on a vessel. PORTABLE AuTOl\IATIC TIDE GAUGE.-During the past year a portable tide gauge has been developed for the use of hydrographic and tidal parties in the field. The main objects sought in the development of this instrument were minimum size commensurate with the· required accuracy, portability and ease of installation, and the minimum amount of office work in the tabulation of the records. The· gauge has for its float well a length of stock 3!-inch iron pipe, which also serves as a support or standard for the·instrument, obviating the· necessity of elaborate float well and platform. This last feature alone makes this instrument well adapted to field parties, particularly in Alaska and the Philippines where wharves are not available. STANDAHD TIDE STAFFS AND BACKING PrncEs.-During the past year standard tide staffs and backing pieces have been developed for use at our principal tidal stations in order to obviate uncertainty in the zero of staff. This standard staff as originally developed was weighted with a strip of sheet lead to keep it from floating in a high tide. This arrangement has been superseded by an ingenious automa'tic clamp for holding the staff down in place while a reading is. being made. BIFILAR SusPENSION CURRENT lNDICATOR.-The Coast and Geodetic Survey has developed within the past year a device which solves in a simple manner a problem long of concern to engineers and navi-. gators. The device is known as a bifilar suspension current indicator. This new instrument renders it possible not only for a current survey party to ascertain whether subsurface currents exist in· different direction from the surface current, but also the exact depth. at which the current changes direction and, too, the direction at the· different levels. It also permits by its triple suspensions of simultaneous observations at three depths. This information is of considerable interest and value to hydrographic and hydraulic engineers. This J?roblem has been solved by the Coast and Geodetic Survey along Imes different from any heretofore attempted. The device solves in a very simple manner a rather troublesome question. AUTOMATIC SIGNAL LAl\IP.-For the past two years efforts have been made to develop a type of signal lamp for use on precise triangulation which would do away to a great extent with the necessity for employing light keepers. Gratifying progress has been made,,. and it is believed that by next season the problem will be largely:

solved. Instead of havinO' a light keeper posted· at eacl~ triangul.ation statiop to operate an electric siO'nal lamp, an auto!llatlc lamp ~ill be posted by a truck driver and will require no attenti9n f?r a period of eight days. The mechanism consists of an electric signal lamp of the usual type, developing about 65,000 beam candlepower, ~un ~y dry batteries and actuated by an eight-day clock. The mecha~ism i~ so arran~ed that the clock will turn the light .on at a~y desired !ime each day and will turn it off after any per10~ of time, n~ng mg from three to six hours. It is believed that m many reg10ns where the topography adapts itself to the use of this type of lamp the device will result in a savinO' of several hundred dollars a month per party. A very small type !::>of lamp is also being developed for use where back packing for Ion~ distances is necessary. "With this smaller type two lamps with their packing boxes, the clock, and the · six dry batteries necessary to run the two lamps for eight days, altogether will not weigh over 40 pounds. RADIO LONGITUDE R.,;connrNo DEVICE.-The application of radio recording to the standard chronograph of this bureau by the sound laboratory of the Bureau of Standards was accomplished during 1922. Recent improvement have overcome many difficulties in field operations, and successful results are being obtamcd in southeastern Alaska from signals sent from Annapolis. FIELD MAGNETOllIETEns.-The field magnetometers of this bureau had through long service become unsatisfactory for field use. These have been remodeled, using available instruments and parts, and the scale has been placed in the telescope instead of the magnet. Accordingly, inst~uments are now available at a small cost which meec every requirement of the most i:podern type of mu~netometer. VARIOMETER TEMPERATURE CoNTROL.--:.Application of temperature correction .to magneto~raph r~cords is ~me of the most tedious parts of magnetic computut10ns. Spare var1omcters have been equipped with control magnet, and the practicability of better temperature control is being studied in the small building erected for special studies of this character at Cheltenham, Md. SouND RANGING.-,Vorking in conjunction with the Bureau of Standards and with the cooperation of the Army we are engaged in the application of sound-ranging principles developed during and since the war to the location of vessels engaged in· oifshore hydrography.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

'The lack of suitable vessels, which has prevented taking up of this work heretofore, is now overcome.. Already a much-needed detailed survey of Portage Bay at the f>OUthern end of Shelikof Straits has been completed, and a detailed survey of Kachemak Bay, situated ~m the east side of Cook !nlet, and probably the finest large harbor m Alaska, has been practically completed. Another important accomplishment of the fiscal year is the progress, to practically full completion of the project, of wire dragging the main ship channels of southeastern Alaska. This project includes the wire dragging of all the main ship channels from Dixon Entrance to Cape Spencer and will have been entirely completed before the end of August, 1923. In the beginning of the wire-drag operations in Alaska chartered launches were used. It later developed that more rapid progress could be attained by mothering the wire-drag boats with one of the Alaska ships, and that the :;hip could be used to decided advantage in towing one end and directing the drag. In 1921 a new type of drag was evolved, especially adapted to the deep Alaskan channels, which multiplied the progress and cut at least two years from the time required to complete the project. In 1914 a wire-drag survey of the main inside steamship routes of southeastern Alaska was commenced. This exceedingly impol'tant work will be completed during this summer. At the end of the fiscal year the deep-water channels have been dragged as far west as Cape Spencer. This marks the completion of one of the most important surveying projects of Alaska, as practically all vessels entering and leaving the Territory pass through these waters. In the past the stranding of many vessels in these much-traveled waters, resulting in the loss of many lives and much property, emphasizes the importance of this work. It is reasonably certain that all pinnacle rocks Jllong these routes have been found and accurately
~~~d

.

The completion during the year of general smveys in Ernest Sound and Zimovia Strait marked yet another important step and furnished the necessary data for publishing a large scale charr of another inside steamer route between Ketchikan and Wrangell. From the commencement of this bureau's operation in Alaska up to 1917 the surveys have been scattered here and there, since the equipment and personnel available were sufficient only to mPet the most urgent of the demands for surveys. Since 1917 a systematic effort has been made toward progression by completed continuous surveys, and one large combined party has been able to carry on surveys of that character for four consecutive years, working northward from the Canadian boundary along the outside coast of Prince of Wales and Baranof Islands. Uq~ent requirements for scatt.5red surveys continue heavy, however, and it has been impossible to confine the operations of the other parties to completed continuous surveys. The economy of that procedure is constantly in mind, however, and is being and will be as closely approximated as existing conditions permit. . During the early part of the fiscal year an arc of precise triangulation through Dry Strait was completed. This arc was a connecting link between the work of previous years. and effected a ~ontinuous

chain of precise triangulation from the Canadiim boundary at Di_xon Entrance to the head oi Lynn Canal, furnishing control of the highest accuracy for all completed and future surveys throughout ~outh eastern Alaska. It is expected that Canadian Government engineers will in 1924 complete triangulation of a similur degree of accuracy across western Canada with connection to United States and Alaska triangulation at Puget' Sound and Dixon Entrance. This work will coo!dinate all Aluska surveys on the same datu~ .with those of the l!mte~ States proper and of Canada. The add1t10nal arcs of precise triangulation which are now beinu executed or are contemplated by this bureau will ultimately connegt and establish control of the highest accuracy for the entire Alaskan territory. · The big outstanding feature of the bureau's Alaskan operations is the. development of an adequate fleet to meet the conditions to be encountered there. Whereas in 1915 the Alaska surveyin~ fleet consisted of :four old, weak, obsolete, wooden vessels and t11ree small steamers, the present fleet consists of four modern steel surveying vessels of approximately 1,100 tons displacement each, one wooden vessel of about 450 tons displacement, two small steam vessels of about 30 and 40 tons displacement, and four internal-combustion engine launches of 60 and 70 :feet in length, besides a :few minor launches. A 120-foot steel motor vessel, now in use elsewhere, will be added to this fleet next year if operating appropriations permit. This is by :far the largest and best equipped outfit the bureau has ever had available, and while some of the smaller cra:ft are old and must be replaced very shortly by similar-sized vessels, as indicated in another part of this report, greatly accelerated accomplishment is confidently anticipated from now on.

Offshore surveys were also made in the vicinity of Coos Bay, and a detailed . survey of Suisun Bay was also accomplished. A survey of Lake Tahoe, on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, was made during the summer of 1922. This lake is about 21 miles long and 12 miles wide, its elevation is over. 6,200 feet above sea level, and the water is quite deep, about two-tlurds of the water area being deeper than 1,200 feet. The greatest depth obtained was 1,640 :feet. In the possessions 0£ the United States a wire-drag survey of Vieques Sound, P.R. (requested by the Secretary of the Navy), has just been completed.

the Sulu Archipelago, off the west coast of Palawan Island, arid in the vicinity of Sarangani Bay. An important accomplishment was the deep-sea sounding done by the two new vessels, the Discoverer and the Pioneer, on their way from the east coast to the west coast. These soundings are of value to science and add greatly to the completeness of the navigational chnrts. They were accomplished at practically no additional cost over and above that of transferring the vessels to the Pacific coast. The L!Jdonia on the trip from the west coast to duty on the east coast also made similar deep-sea soundings. The work of these three vessels has added materially to the knowledge of the depths of waters on the usual track of vessels proceeding from coast to coast of the United States via the Panama Canal.
RECENT GEODETIC ACTIVITIES.

The precise triangulation completed, principally in New Mexico, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, California, Washington, and Alaska, had a total length through the schemes of 720 miles and covered an area of 23,840 square miles. An additional 300 miles of preliminary and secondary triangulation was completed, with an area of 1,740 square . miles. Seven precise base lines were measured, with a total length of 74.5 miles, each having a probable error of less than one part in a · million. Lines of precise leveling, totaling over 1,400 miles, were run in 15 different States and in Alaska, and elevations were determined for over a thousand permanent bench marks. Each of the parties engaged on precise triangulation determined the astronomic azimuth of a number of lines in its schemes, and in addition an astronomic party was in the field during the greater part of the year observing longitude and latitude and determining the intensity of gravitv at a number of points in the United States and Alaska. A gravity party was engaged for four months on special investigations in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas to determine the extent to which gravity observations could be used to indicate the subsurface structure of the earth in the vicinity of salt domes and oil wells.
COOPERATION \VITII OTHER GOVERNMENT BUREAUS.

It is a pleasure to call attention again to the cordial spirit of cooperation which is found among the Government departments. On the geodetic work of this bureau it is particularly noticeable. Valuable assistance has been received from the Bureau of Standards in standardizing and perfecting apparatus, such as the device for record,ing radio time signals for our longitude work .. The Navy Department through the Naval Observatory and the Bureau of Naval Operations, has also been of signal assistance in the longitude work by sending special time signals for the use of the Alaska party nnd in lending special apparatus. Many other instances of help received from other bureaus could be cited. It is the policy of this bureau to show the same spirit of helpfulness. The program of geodetic surveys for each year is made out to meet as far as possible the needs of other organizations, such ns the General Land Office 1 the Geological Survey, and the Forest Service.

If an emergency call. is mad_e upon tlus bureau. by another department for c~ntrol data m a regwn whe~·e no geodetic surveys exist, every effort is made to meet the need m so far as funds and personnel permit.

COOI'ERA'l'ION Wl'l'II THE GEOD~'l'IC AND TIDAL SURVEYS OF CANADA.

Steady progress is being made toward the completion of the t_wo great triangulation projects which are being executed in cooperat10n with the geodetic survey of Canada. The first project provides for an arc of precise triangulation extending along the international boundary from Lake Superior to the Pacific, of which the United States is to execute the western half and the Dominion of Canada the eastern. It is hope(j_ that the calendar year 1924 will see the completion of our portion of this work. The second coopemtive project is the extension of an arc of precise triangultltion from Puget Sound through British Columbia and southcnstem Alaska to the upper waters of the. Yukon, thence down the Yukon through western Alaska. This will enable the maps and charts of Alaska and western Canada to be placed upon the same datum as those of the United States. The southern Canadian section through British Columbia to Dixon Entrance will soon be finished, and the United States section from Dixon Entrance to the head of the Lynn Canul is completed, while a start has been made on the precise triangulation in western Alaska by parties working northward from Cook Inlet. This co?pcrativc arrangem~nt gives each country all the .benefits to be derived from both pro1ects at about one-half the total cost It is an illustration of the spii·it of friendly cooperation which exist~ bet~veen many of the. Federal bureaus and the corresponding organizat10ns of the Canatlrnn Government. In connection with the coast.wise commerce between our Pacific coast ports and Alaska and also with our northern neighbor the c~rrents i~1 the tidal waters connecting these ports are of v~ry cons1dcrable unportance. Because of the swift tidal currents m many ~laces along the inside passao·es used by our vessels, particularly in -f?U:our Narrows in Canadi~n territo~·y, wh~re velocities have b.een 0 served at 12 knots, vessels attemptmg tlus passage at any tnne except near slack water place themselves in jeopardy. It is evident, therefore, that advance predictions for the mariner of the times of slack water in these narrow turbulent straits must be as accurate as can possibly be made . . In obtaining the necessary observations the ?ooperntion of the tidal survey of Canada has been secured in furmshmg the observations for Canadian waters. It is planned that all predictions may finally be made jointly, which plan will not only increase the accu~ racy of the predictions but will also permit a considerable saving in the labor involved. It is hoped to extend this cooperation to cover all stations, both tidal and current, for which predictions occur in both the Canadian and United States tables.

Part !.-OUTSTANDING CONDITIONS OF THE BUREAU. CHAPTER I.
MORE ADEQUATE HOUSING QUARTERS NECESSARY.

This bureau in its present quarters is operating under a handicap that continually stifles production. I have dwelt at length on this subject in previous annual reports and would omit reference to it in this report were its relative importance not so great. vVhether or not we. are awake to the fact, we are yearly indulging ourselves in a costly extravagance. "We are complacent in the tipparent saving in appropriations in abstaining from providing funds for a modern building properly planned for the industrial operations carried on by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and yet we are yearly paying an additional overhead in salaries of extra personnel and lack 0£ production that is all out of proportion to the interest cost on money invested in a building adequate in every way for the Coast and Geodetic Survey. · I have before me an advertisement 0£ a successful commercial firm. A prominent part of the advertisement is the reproduction 0£ photographs 0£ the housing facilities 0£ the firm from the time of its inception in a small reconstructed barn to the present, when it is housed in large, commodious, sanitary buildings. While the advertisement has a sentimental appeal, it was not sentiment that prompte,d the razing, decade after decade, 0£ 'the quarters in which this commercial firm was honsed and their replacement by larger and better quarters; it was the stern necessity 0£ competition with other firms in like fields which would have been enabled to produce at less. cost than the firm issuing the advertisement had not that firm taken advantage 0£ every opportunity to modernize production and reduce unit costs. As I have stated in previous reports, this bureau is engaged in the buildings it occupies in Washington in two distinct commercial enterprises: (a) The compilation and printing 0£ charts 0£ all the navigable waters of the coasts of the United States and possessions; (b) the construction and repair of intricate surveying instruments and equipment for use in carrying on the surveys made by the bureau. The output 0£ this bureau has a world-wide distribution. The information that is on the charts that are compiled, printed, and distributed by the bureau is absolutely necessary to the pilot 0£ ev:ery vessel that enters, traverses, and leaves the waters of the Umted States and its possessions. Such an enterprise in the hands 0£ private firms competing against each other would unquestionably thrive at the expense 0£ commerce, in that the price of these navigational charts would be increased greatly and would only be limited by the extent of the competition between the firms producing them, and
14

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

15

this very competition would force modern methods of producing the charts. As it is, these charts are sold at the cost of paper and printing, but this cost is higher than is necessary, due to the fact that they are produced in a plant that is not modern and which can not be made modern in its present housing facilities. These housing facilities consist of one b.uilding constructed for a dwelling and the stables for this dwelling, another building constructed to be used as a hotel, and various smaller buildings. The bureau has been housed in these b.uildings 52 years. The extra cost of chart and instrument production under these conditions is absorbed in increased appropriations for extra personnel and in restricted production.

CHAPTER II.
NEED FOR AND ECONOMY IN ADDITIONAL FLOATING EQUIPMENT.

This year, for the first time, the Coast and Geodetic Survey has a fleet of modern ocean-surveying vessels adequate in number for the work which has been authorized by Congress. Unless it be desired that the·survey of the coasts of the United States and its possessions be taken up in a larger way and increased funds be provided therefor, it will not be necessary to provide any more of this type of vessel for some time to come. There is, however, an urgent need for additional small craft and for a small steam vessel of about 500 tons displacement for inshore work. Much of the Alaska waters along the outside coast should not be surveyed close inshore, and in some places should not be surveyed within several miles of the shore, by the valuable ocean-going vessels because of the great risk involved. These waters are particularly dangerous because of innumerable submerged rocks and are often too rough io be surveyed from small, open launehe:>. For this work the surveying vessels should be aided by steam or power t<>nders of 30 or 40 tons displacement, which can maneuver more rPadily and safely among and over the rocks than can the larger vessels. Besides, should a tender be wrecked in this work, the loss would be small compared to the loss of a full-powered surveying craft. The bureau has two such tenders in operation in Alaska this year, but both are old (25 and 36 years, respectively) and can not hist much longer. The purchase of one such tender to accompany each vessel operating on the exposed coast of Alaska would be the cheapest and most effective insurance that could be placed on these vessels and would also materially increase the amount of work accomplished by them. On the Atlantic coast a new vessel of about 500 tons displacement is needed to replace a small vessel that has outlived her usefulness. This vessel, built cheaply 22 years ago, has reached the condition where her annual cost for upkeep and repairs is out of all proportion to the value of the work which can be accomplished with her. She can still be mad~ use of for a few years, but she is an expensive vessel and is available only for work in comparatively :>mooth water. It would be a good investment to replace her now with a small steam vessel of about the same size. There is also need for a small craft for work in the inside waters of the Atlantic coast, the bays, sounds, and inside passages which extend along this coast from Massachusetts to Florida. In recent years there has been a steadily increasing demand for larger scale and more complete charts of these waters. Most of them can be surveyed effectively from launches and power boats, but there are long stretches of the coast where fuel and supplies can not be had

within a practicable distance from the work and where camping facilities are poor. For work in such localities a shallow-draft, self-propelling craft of the general type of the cruising house boat is needed to provide quarters for the surveying personnel, and fuel and means for repairing launch machinery. INCREASING DEMAND FOR HYDROGRAPIIIC WORK.
~mmediate attention are stupendous in their total magn_itude.

The hydrographic projects that confront the bureau and demand
Tl~ey

uiclude every kind o:f hydrography and range the entire coast lme of continental United States and of all her territorial possessions. The menace of the uncharted pinnacles and bowlders in undrag~ed areas along the New England coast is constantly in mind. All important channels of southeastern Alaska must be swept. The charts of the approaches to important harbors and waterways in the changeable areas must be kept up to date. The old surveys, made with inadequate equipment and before vessels of the present-day .draft were even anticiJ?ated, must be revised. The sketchily surveyed coast~ of the Pacific States must be so charted that navigation by the lead is feasible when approaching them during the prevalent fogs. The commercial needs of western Alaska must be met. Uncharted reefs and other dangers are frequently reported adjacent to our coasts but outside the surveyed areas. These must be acc11rately located and charted by extending our surveys a reasonable distance from the coast. The first surveys of our outlying possessions must be completed. The bureau is mindful of all these needs; Its plans are broad in sco:r;>e and contemplate the most efficient utilization of the available eqm~ment and personnel, and the wisest and most economical expen~1ture of .the appropriations authorized, meetinrr the publie req:inrements, m so far as is economically practicable, the order of their urgency. . WmE~DRAG Sun~Ys ALONG TUE NEw ENGLAND CoAsT, ETc.-The impera.tive necessity for completion of wire-drag surve:rs of the coastw1se steamer routes alonrr the New Enrrland coast has been peatedly stressed in my previou~ reports. Large areas were dragged m the years immediately preceding the "\Vorld War, and vast nmnhers of bowlders and pmnacles were discovered and located which had peviously menaced the immmse wrnlth in shipping which necessarily traverses those rontes. Since the war limited appropriat~ons have prevented further progress. One party will resume operations the coming fiscal year, and it is most desirable that at least one party may continue in operation until the completion of all necessary areas. There remain to be wire dragged about 3,000 square miles along the cost of Maine and an extensive area along the route around Nantucket Shoals, besides areas in Long Island Sound, Dost on Harbor, and between Key "\Vest, Fla., and the Dry Tortugas. HYDROGUAPIIY, ATI,ANTIC CoAST.-Thc important hydrography 011 the Atlantic coast includes revision surveys o:f changeable areas necessary to the protection of shipping, revision surveys of unchangeable areas the old surveys of which are inadequate to present neeas, and completion of detailed surveys from the coast to the 100-fathorn

curve. With reference to the offshore surveys to the 100-fathorn curve, the most urgent areas are from completed work at vVinyah Bay northward to Chesapeake Bay approaches and from completed. work a little south of Mantanzas Inlet southward to Jupiter Inlet. One vessel, the Lydonia, is at present available to carry on this work and is thus en~aged, extending completed work northward along the coast of the lJarolinas during the summer months and southward along the Florida coast durin~ the winter months. The Lydonia's present assignment is in the vicinity of Cape Fear, N. C. Because of frequent reports of changed depths over and adjacent to Frying Pan Shoals her present season's work will include a revision survey of those shoals. The launch Miluuwe is working in conjunction with the Lydonia and will sound out the shoaler depths where it is hazardous for the larger unit to operate. Two launches, the Elsie and Mikawe, are available for revision work in protected waters and will . be used to the full extent that appropriations permit. GuLF CoAsT.-The nature of the hydrography needed along the Gulf coast is comparable with that of the Atlantic coast and includes revision work of changeable areas and of old inadequate surveys and extension of hydrography to the 100-fathom curve. This work is being advanced by two parties on the steamers Bache and Ilydrographer. At present they are engaged in surveys of Sabine Pass, arnl on the completion of work in that vicinity will take up surveys of the approaches to Galveston. Sabine Pass is the approach to Port Arthur, Tex. Both Port Arthur and Galveston have increased enormously in commercial importance since the original surveys of the sea approaches. The shore shelf, with critical depths thereon, extends many miles to seaward in this vicinity. Reports of changed depths affecting navigation of these waters have been frequent, hence the importance of immediate revision surveys o:f these approaches. Vrnarn IsLANDs.-The hydrography of the Virgin Islands is now being started by the party on the steamer Ranger, assisted by the launches Mitchell and llfarindin. The project contemplates detailed hydrography o:f all harbors and inshore areas and all passages surrounding these islands. All important navigable passages will be wire dragged. · PACIFIC CoAST.-The Pacific coast of the United States is o:f a very different character from that of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The 1,000-fathom curve is comparatively close to the shore, and there are comparatively few harbors and inland waterways. Until recent years the existing surveys were very sketchy in character. Owing to the large amount of bad weather and fog common along this coast, the navigator is necessarily dependent upon his charts to a more ·than ordinary extent. Lack of adequate surveys has resulted in many serious wrecks. The hydrography required includes detailed surveys of the approaches to all important harbors and extension of the surveys to the 1,000-fathom curve the entire length of this coast. The bureau intends to meet the needs of this locality as rapidly as possible. The recently converted 1,100-ton naval mine sweeper, the Guide, will be sent to the Pacific station as soon as her equipment is complete and will take up and carry on the needed surveys. This vessel will be outfit.ted with the most modern hydrographic equipment known, and it is believed that nothing is being omitted to render her capable of the most rapid and efficient progress

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

19

on hydrographi~ surveys of this character. During the winter months the Guide will extend northward surveys to the 1,000fathom curve from completed work of the past year between the Mexican boundary and San Diego. During the summer months she will complete the partially surveyed area off dangerous Cape Blanco, working toward a junction with completed surveys off Qap~ Mendocino, and then proceeding northward along the almost entirely unsurveyed Oregon coast. WrnE-DRAG SURVEYS IN ALASKA.-The wire dragging of the main ship channels from Dixon Entl'ance to Cape Spencer will be completed this season. There are, however, a number of side passages, a.rms, and bays to which vessels go regularly and wJ:iich ~re of practically the same character and importance as the mam ship channels. ~t is very desirable that the wire dragging of these. proceed without mterruption. The steamer Explorer, together with the launches E! eUanthtl8 and Scandinavia, is equipped to carry on this work effic1ent~J: and rapidly, using the improve~ wire sweep .w~erevcr. local conditions permit. Only lack of sufficient appropriations will be allowed to prevent this important work from proceeding. CHARTING SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA.-The"insistent demand for rapid progress in the charting of Alaskan waterways has been indicated elsewhere, as has also the expediency from an economical standpoint of proceedin$ by completed continuous surveys. This project will be continued by the party on the 1,100-ton steamer Surveyor, assisted by at least one large launch. This party is at present making final ?omplete surveys of the west coast of ·southeastern Alaska and, workmg northward from the Canadian boundary, has reached the southwest coast of Baranof Island. CHARTING WESTERN ALASKA.-Comparatively little of the south coast of Alaska has yet been charted. The entire extent of this coast from Cape Spencer to Dutch Harbor is now of such commercial importanc~ that the most rapid progress possible is imperative. The burea'!l wa~ able to res~me surveys of this coast this season for the first time smce 1920, usmg the steamers DiBooverer and Pioneer, both recently c~nverted naval mine sweepers of about 1,100 tons displacement. It is contempl~ted tht~t these two vessels, assisted by at lea~t two large launches, will contmue surveys of this coast at least until the most urgent requirements have been met. The 120-foot motor ves~el .Nato;na wil~ a.lso probably take up urgently needed additional Wo1k 111 Prmce Wilham Sound and in Cook Inlet . . c.IIARTING THE PnILIPPINE IsLANDs.-The first surveys of the Phil1PPine Islands are approaching completion. There remains yet to be surveyed tl~e greater part of the west coast of Pala.wan and of the Sulu Arclnpelafl'o portions of the south coast of Mmdanao, the southern part of th~ Sulu Sea and the north and northeastern coast of Luzon, includinO' the chain' of small islands extending northward from Luzon. Thr~e vessels the Pathfinder, Fathmner, and Marin<j,uque, are continuously en~aged in advancing this project. It is Imperative that progress b~ uninterrupted, not only to insure the continuance of the present financial assistance received from the ~hilippine Government, but to complete the project during the useful hfe of present equipment. Such are our present plans. The bureau will be awake, however, to new conditions that may make changes expedient. Better, more

efficient methods. of hydrographic surveying, and better and timesaving instrumental appliances are constantly being developed and are utilized wherever they speed up production without loss of desirable accuracy. No fals'e idea of governmental economy should be permitted to curtail its present production or prevent a natural expansion consistent with national growth. Our country is yet comparatively new. The end of the necessity for additional surveys is nowhere in sight. The forces that produce alteration in the changeable area never cease their activity. Areas unim~ortant and unconsidered in the present scheme of surveys will in time become of first importance. The vast field of oceanographic surveying will some day demand attention in the interest of our transoceanic commerce.
MAPPING OF THE INTEIUOU OF THE UNITED STATES AND ITS POSSESSIONS SHOULD BE EXPEDITED.

The extension of the precise triangulation and precise leveling for the control of mapping and engineering projects is discouragingly slow because of insufficient funds. Engineering organizations throughout the country are asking for the rapid completion of the fundamental topographic map; yet the preliminary :framework of geographic positions which is necessary to furnish starting and checking points for such a map is woefully inadequate. There are three areas in the United States proper; each exceeding 200,000 square miles, without a precise triangulation point in them, and there is one area of 265,000 square miles without a precise elevation established in it. There is impending a 'videspread recognition of the economic necessity for speedily completing the topographic map of the country, and there will follow the determination to have it done. It is estimated that $4,000,000 will complete the control work required for continental United States, and that control work should be done as far in advance of the topography as possible. Where such large areas exifOt it would be at le11st a year before control positions could be furnished for territory near the center of the area. It is not economical to have the ·mapping follow immediately behind the triangulation, for it requires several months to compute and adjust the geographic positions :for the control points ready for the topog.ra~her to plot them on his plane table sheets, to serve as starting pomts for his survey. During this period, when construction materials are so expensive and competition for them so keen, it might well be asked if this is not the proper time to spend an increased amount of money in makinO" surveys and so prepare the way for a more intelligent, because ~etter informed, development of the resources of the Nation later. Judged by the demands which are being made upon the Coast and Geodetic Survey for data in unsurveyed regions, the appropriation made to this bureau for geodetic work is far short of that needed. Any mention of requests for geodetic data brings up the vital question of cooperation between different departments and bureaus of the Government. Unless there is to be endless and costly duplication of work and effort, any bureau specially fitted to perform a certain function must be reasonably prepared to exercise such

special duty for the benefit of another bureau where r?quested ~o do so. Because the Coast and Geodetic Survey needs precise.geode.tic positions for its charts and precise elevations in com~ect10n with tidal observations it 'has been charrred by Congress with the duty of determining s~ch georrraphic po~itions and elevations over the entire country. Such :'n arrnngement undoubtedly makes for economy, yet, because of lack of funds, this bureau is compelled to deny, year after year, repeated requests from the Genen~l Land Office, the U. S. Geolorrical Survey, the U. S. Forest Service, and others for control dat~ which are urrrently needed in connection with the special work of those bureat~. Such a condition should not l~nger endure; the Coast and Geodetic Survey should be supplied with sufficient funds reasonably to nicet the urgent demands of other Government organizations. This work done by any other Government bureau would mean unnecessary duplication of personnel and special instrumental equipment. ·what has been said regarding the need for basic geographic positions in the United States applies with even greater foFce to All\ska. Precise levels will be completed this season from Seward via Anchorage to Fairbanks and thence to Chitina and Valdez, and will be extended as rapidly as permanent wagon roads are completed in the Territory; but much more triangulation is needed at on e in western Alaska. The ~perations of the General Land Office and of the. U. S. Geological Survey are greatly retarded by the lack of triangulation, and this decidedly hinders the development of that region. Funds spent for such a purpose during the next five years would give rich returns on the investment in the form of increased fac~lities afforded the operations of other Federal organizations upon wluch the development and prosperity of Alaska so largely depencl.
BETTER CHARTS FOR THE MOTOR BOATMAN.

~he numerous minor entrances, inlets, and anchorages of the coast reg10n, a~ .well as many of thei~· tributary waters, have attained a degree of unportance far exceedm<r that which attached to them in the comparatively recent past. TI1is is due in a larrre measure to the phenomenal development of motor-boat traffic, ~hich is now made up of large fleets operated by the various fishing interests, numberless local and coastwise light-draft commercial craft of all kinds, and the myriads of pleasure boats in universal use. T~1ese craft sustain much the same relation to the community on navigable waters as the automobile does to the millions in the interior o.f the country who are dependent upon it for loca~ land tran~~orta t~o11:· In fact, the services rendered the commumty are stnkmgly sumla~· in all respects. Like th? automobile, mo~or boats are used extensively for pleasure and pnv~te transportation of every so~t.

of lives and property exposed to its hazards and the total of mvestments involved are so enormous that this highly productive enterprise surely deserves our thoughtful and sympathetic attention. It merits and demands no less than the National Government's fostering care. Its military value alone as an effective naval auxiliary should guarantee such care, in the same measure, at least, that aid is extended to many other interests whose claim can not be urged so well. These waters have, as a rule, fared rather badly in the matter of surveys arid improvements, as provision made for such work usually has been so limited that its application is of necessity restricted to harbors and waterways of the first importance. As the waters llt,Vailable for motor-boat use are so extensive, it is evident that any general project for their early im.Provement and the maintenance of such improvements would reqmre an expenditure far in excess of any available funds and out of proportion to the interests involved. It therefore appears that for the present no one practicable meap.s can contribute more to the safety, efficiency, and normal developm~mt of the traffic than the publication of the best and most up-to-date charts. and supple~entary pilot notes and sailing directions covering all of our territorial waters adapted to the operation of motor boats. The Coast and Geodetic Survey is charged by law with the :production of such charts and other nautical information, includ1p.g the· execution of the surveys necessary to that end, yet the funds heretofore furnished for that purpose have been so' limited that the charts at present issued for the guidance of these motor-boat men are based in many localities on surveys made many years ago. The evolution which this changeable area has undergone during that period has been so extensive that the navigator can no longer use thP charts with reasonable assurance that they will guide him safely through the waters he must traverse. There should be no further delay in undertaking the correction of this unfortunate situation. The need is at present urgent, and the constantly augmented traffic is rendering it increasingly so. The culpability of further delay is augmented by the :fact that the .operations necessary to furnish authentic and up-to-date charts would be on a very modest ·scale. Their ·cost would be so inconsiderable in view of the benefits to be derived that I feel no hesitancy in advocating the project even at this time when the Federal policy has quite properly come to be one of rigid economy in governmental expenditure.
COAST EROSION AND PROTECTION.

These surveys which we have just seen to be so necessary to the security of motor-boat traffic will serve another important purpose. In my last annual report I called attention to the effect of unceasing attack by winds, waves, and currents upon the easily eroded sand beaches of our Atlantic and Gulf coasts. That attack is slowly but inexorably driving the beaches landward. Particularly in time o:f storm the zone of shallow water adjacent to the shore is like some huge mill in which the materials subjected to wave action are torn from their restin~ places, seized upon by the whirling waters, and borne away to find an eventual resting place in the sheltered bays and lagoons, or in ·offshore depths so great that wave attack can have no appreciable effect upon the bot.tom.

Rl~PORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST. AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Until comparatively recent years these beaches were, as a rule1 desolate uninhabited stretches o:f sand dunes and undergrowth, ot no appi;rent economic importanCl'.·. ;Recently, ho\":ever, the development of better transportation fac1ht1es, as exemplified by ~he motor boat, the automobile, and the trolley, has made the~ accessible to the gre>at centers o:f population adjacent to the coast, with the re~ult that millions of people now visit them annually in s~arch ?f re~1~f from the more rigorous climatic conditions of the ne1ghbormg c1ti~s. The rule has been that within a short time after these seaside resorts have. come into existence they have been confronted with the necessity of finding some means of checking this encroachment of the sea upon their improved properties. To this struggle they have devoted themselves with an earnestness born of the realization that their continued existence depends upon a succei;;sful outcome of the fight. Yet in ~hese fights the sea, in a deplorable number of cases, has been the victor. Some communities have succeeded in at least temporarily protecting themselves. Others however, have fought a losing fight. One ca_n scarcely visit any long-improved section of this coast without hcarmg stories of beautiful properties undermined and swept away, along .with the structures that have been erected in their ?.efense; or of communities that have almost bankrupted themselves m the fight only to see the result of their efforts destroyed in some gale of unusual severity. One of the outstanding reasons :for the indifferent success of these efforts at protection .has been our lack of knowledge o:f the precise ~ature and methods of the attacking forces or of the degree of resistance t? attack offered by the various physiographic forms which characterize tl.1e shores. The decisive part of nature's battle between ~ea .a!1d land 1s fought beneath the surface of the water where it is mv1s1b~e to the observer. ·Only the final result can be directly seen an~ th~s ~esnlt does not indicate the vicissitudes of the struggle of which it 1s the outcome. Yet there is no reason to suppose that this evolution of the shores is not controlled by natural laws, which can be ascertained by the accumulation and study of adequate data. We know that nature acts according to rule, and that these rules can be determined and applied to promote the welfare of. humanity. Already we know enough of the laws governing shore evolution to perceive clearly the character of the additional studies which must be made before we can ut!lize our knowledge with confidence in the result. In other words, this particular problem, while in process of solution, has not yet passed from the field of the physiographer, "'.ho determines the fundamental principles underlying shore evolution, to that of the engineer, who makes practical application of the principles estµ,blished by hi~p~edece~sor. . . . . . Certam port1011s of the ~urveys "'.luch I have J~st described as so vital to the motor boatman are precisely those: wluch are. most necessary to the determination of the laws governmg shore-line changes. For example more than any other part of the waters he traverses the motor boatiu'an needs :frequent surveys of. the various inlets. w~1ich connect the successive bays a~d sounds with the ocean, for it is ~t these inlets that the changes m channels and shoals are most rapid

and extensive., an<l c(mseqnently that he is most apt to get into difficulty. · . Similarly, this very fact of most rapid and extensive changes means that at the inlets the natural forces are working in their greatest variety and effectiveness, and therefore that the inlets afford the ideal sites for the study of these forces. The hydrographic surveys designed primarily to protect the motorboat traffic will incidentally and without additional cost furnish a recorcl of successive stages in the hidden evolution of the shoal-water forms, and in consequence result in a contribution of first importance toward the solution of this important problem. This fact furnishes an additional and potent reason for undertaking such surveys at nn early date.
MAGNETIC WOHK IMPOHTANT ON 1',ARTH, AIR, AND
Sl~A.

The results of the magnetic work of the bureau are used on earth, air, and sea. It is necessary to have on hand data which will m'ake it possible to meet the needs of the land surveyor, the aviator, and the mariner. Formerly declination, sometimes called the variation of the compass, was the only magnetic element in constant practical use. Now the aviator requires .simihtr know ledge of the dip of the needle or its inclination to the plane of the horizontal. The accumulation of the needed information is made 'at five fixed observatories and by observations at numerous points or stations throughout. the United States. Maintenance of these observatories is necessary, because the earth's magnetism is constantly changing in small amounts in a complicated manner. Records of these changes are made by continuous photographing of the position of the delicately suspended needles. These observations have to be made in isolilted places, as there must be no electric railway, electric power, telegraph or telephone lines, nor iron or steel in any structure in this vicinity. Accordingly the observer must live in seclusion and suffer many inconveniences. . There is special need for improving the rondition at the observatory at Cheltenham, Md., by the construction of a building to serve .fi.lS an oflice building and a house .for the observer, so that the observatory will not longer be withont a guard at night within reasonable distance, as it has been heretofore. There is also special need for the transfer of the Porto Rico observatory from Vieques Island, a small island east of Porto Rico, to the main island. Conditions, in so far as the observer is concerned, have been steadily growing worse, and it is becoming more and more difficult to replace observers ns the term of duty at this observatory expires. Scientists consider that the continuance of an observatory in this region is of the greatest importance. A suitab'fe site on the main island can be found which will meet all the requirements both of the observer and of the work. It 'is most desirable that the atmospheric electricity work which was formerly carried on at Cheltenham magnetic observatory be taken up again ns soon as practicable. This is an essential pnrt of terrestrial ma~prntism, and more knowledge is necessary in regard to it before tlrn problem of terrestrial magnetism can be solved.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURYEY.

This work has a most important bearing on the discovery of the causes of certain difficulties in radio transmission. . Observations at the field magnetic stations are needed for two purposes: First, to furnish the information for making magnetic maps which are so much in demand; especial maps are often called for between the customar;r five-year publication (the information for each station is also furnished in printed form) ; second, the stations established are utilized by surveyors who use magnetic instruments in testing the correctness of their instruments. The conditions resulting from the growth of towns hnd cities frequently eliminate or destroy the marks at these stations, so that the points of previous observations can not be found. In so far as it is found practicable these stations are being replaced with others so located as to be secure from future disturbance wherever possible. One party in addition to those that it has been possible to operate in the past is urgently needed. There is great need for a magnetic survey of Alaska, especially in the interior and along the Aleutian Islands. Magnetic maps of Alaska are based on insufficient data, and the results at the Sitka Observatory, while invaluable, do not give the change for the entire region. The completion of the Government railroad, availability of power boats on the rivers, and other forms of transportation make the interior of Alaska more accessible. The Coast Guard patrol of the Aleutian Islands makes magnetic work practicable in hitherto inaccessible islands. The undertaking 0£ this work should not be longer delayeil. Magnetic data for Alaska are nowhere more than barely sufficient, and in many cases entirely insufficient for placing correct magnetic information on the mariner's charts. There is immediate need for the reoccupation of magnetic stations in the Philippine Islands. It is only because the magnetic elements have been at a point of little change for some years in this reo'ion that it has been possible to delay this survey. Ten years l~ave elapsed since the last survey, while the interval should not normally exceed five.
WHY SYSTEMATIC SEISMOLOGICAL WORK IS NEEDED.

"Within the last two years earthquakes have been felt in Canada, near Maine and New York; in Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, and Missouri; in Montana, Utah, Arizona, Washington, and California; bef1:eath the sea off the coast of Oregon; and in the outlying territones. Some of these caused more or less local damage. Earthquake study is therefore important to the country as a whole. An important seismological investigation has been started in California-w~1ich has suffered most from earthquakes. An earthquake map of California has just been issued as the result of cooperation in several Government departments and private institutions. This bureau is making measurements to determine earthquake displacements resulting from previous earthquakes. The purpose of this California work is not only a scientific study 0£ earthquakes 1.Jut also a very practical one of useful information to architects and engineers in regard to places where they must use special precautions in order to avoid the danger of catastrophe. Thi'

26

REPORT OF DIRECTOTI, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

outstanding purpose is to make it possible to reduce loss of life and property in great earthquakes and eliminate it entirely in minor ones. The wo1;k in California, standing alone, is handicapped by the lack of investigation of a similar character for the country as a whole. In spite of the seismological work by the Government and by institutions elsewhere than in California the amount of high-grade cooperative work is small. In such a vast region it is not possible to make a study of each locality affected by earthquakes nor to place instruments near each place where an earthquake may occur. Accordingly, a few stations should be completely equipped with instruments which can record both near and distant earthquakes. It is the consensus of opinion of scientific men that this work should be taken up by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and that seismolo<Tical stations should be established at the magnetic observatories of the bureau. The Coast and Geodetic Survey already has the personnel which is capable of making and interpreting records of the accuracy necessary for high-grade work. Some of the results to be expected include better knowledge of the places where earthquakes have occurred and are likely to occur, a study of the western mountain region to determine whether earthquakes are likely to occur in the vicinity of the sites of great dams constructed in reclamation work, to learn in advance whether there is danger of recurrence of such great earthquakes as those at Charleston and New Madrid, to render a service to the country as a whole similar to that which is being given to California by the special investigations there, and to get more knowledge of the whole subject of earthquakes, so that more will be known about the internal structure of the earth and what is going on beneath the surface that may affect the conditions of life on the surface.
SAN FRANCISCO CURRENT AND TIDAL SUUVEY.

vVhat has been done in New York Harbor in the past year is now planned for San Francisco Harbor. Here, too, a knowledge of the behavior of the currents and tides is of great importance to shipping, to harbor improvement in its civil and military phases, to the solution of the question of the proper disposal of sewage, and to other activities that center in the modern harbor. Beginning in September, 1923, a comprehensive current and tidal survey is to be made in San Francisco Bay and tributaries and, as soon as possible, the results will be made 'available. ·
DEMAND FOR SURVEYS IN AJ,ASKA.

This bureau is constantly in receipt of a large volume of insistent and urgent requests for detailed surveys of particular areas in all parts of Alaska. This is a natural result of the thousands of miles of coast line and the vast and varied amount of ·natural resources which are known to exist adjacent to water transportation in that Territory, resources which include such much-needed products a'3 crude oil, coal, timber for paper pulp, copper and chrome deposit'3, marble, lumber, and enormous quantities of food fishes. In spite

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

of the bureau's activity in Alaska throughout past years, extending to the limit the appropriations of Congress available for such work, the greater part of Alaskan waters are still unsurveyed and uncharted. The development of industry there is directly dependent on the progress of the charting of these waters. The much-needed natural resources mentioned can not be reached until the adjacent waterways have been made safe for shipping. The sources of these requests are, in general, threefold: (a) From other Government departments; ( b) from steamship companies operating vessels in Alaskan waters; and ( c) from private citizens or corporations interested in the development of various commercial projects in Alaska. (a) The Navy Department, in furtherance of naval interests in Alaska, has requested extensive surveys which will require a large proportion of the whole Alaska surveying fleet several seasons to com,Plete. The Department of the Interior is interested in establishmg and, assisting in the development of several industries in Alaska, particularly the paper-pulp industry. Their recent request that the entrance to Thomas Bay in Frederick Sound near PetersburO' be wire dragged is to safeguard shipping in entering that bay and make it possible to interest capital in the project to establish a pulp mill at that place. (b) The steamship companies operating in Alaskan waters are constantly under pressure to call at numerous new points adjacent to their regular runs, but outside the surveyed areas, in order to make deliveries and col1ections of cargo. This they dare not do until the surveys of those places have been made and charted. Conse· quently, they are continually urging the immediate survey of such places. A~ c:-ises in point, the bureau has received the following requests w1thm the last few months: From the Alaska Steamship Co. a request for a resurvey of Tuxedni Harbor in Cook Inlet, and from the Standard Oil Co. a request for a detailed survey of Port Alexander, Prince of Wales Island. (c) The requests for surveys from private citizens and corporations are very numerous, cover all parts of Alaska, and come from people interested financially in the development of all the varied natural resources of that vast Territory. Recent insistent requests include detailed surveys of Portage Bay, Wide Bay, Chi~nik Bay, El Capitan Pass, Evans Bay, Unakwit Inlet, Icy Bay, bea Otter Sound, Kelm Strait, Dry Bay, Lost Harbor (Akun Bay), Kamishak Bay, False Pass, and Saint Catherine Cove, and wire-drag work in parts of Prince ·William Sound and Cook Inlet. A ~rnmber of these surveys have recently been made, others are now m progress, but the volume of work necessary to comply with reasonable requests already received will require years to complete, working to the full capacity of the appropriations, equipment, and personnel authorized. Meanwhile, the urgent requests :for additional surveys will continue in great volume as additional resources are discovered and as old and new industries continue to develop.

CHAPTER III.
DUTCH HARBOR, ALASKA, SHOULD BE FEDERAL BASE.

I have recommended for many years that the Federal Government purchase from the North American Commercial Co. property at Dutch Harbor, Aleutian Islands, Alaska, to be used as a fuel and supply base. Up to the present time nothing has been done toward acquiring this property. With the development of Alaska and the increasing demands in the western territorial waters, the need for a Government-owned base is more emphasized than ever. At the present time the fuel and other supplies must be purchased through 'private concerns, and not only is this expensive, but the lack of ready supply often leads to unnecessary delays. In the case of the Coast and Geodetic Survey more and more work is being done in the waters of western Alaska, and the necessity for steaming great distances to find a fuel base leads to delays and is very costly. This bureau is not alone concerned, as the Department of Commerce has many activities in Alaska and is much involved in matters looking to the interest of Government-owned vessels. The Bureau of Lighthouses has very important work the year round all through Alaskan waters, and outside of this department the Navy Department and the Coast Guard of the Treasury Department would benefit very much from such an investment. It can not be disputed that the establishment of a modern fuel and supply base at this point would not only pay the interest on the investment but also, in a very short time, pay for the original cost.
28

CHAPTER IV.
DELEGATES SHOULD REPRESENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT CONFERENCES.

For a number of years the United States Government has made appropriations to send delegates to conferences of several international scientific organizations, notably to the International Hydrographic Bureau, the International Geodetic Association, the International Navigation Congress, and the International Seismological Association. It is believed that this action on the part of our Government has been more than justified in the great saving in money and increase in accuracy in the several classes of scientific work represented by the international groups which have resulted from participation in these deliberations. To-day millions of dollars are being spent each year in geophysical work and investigations by the National Government, private institutions, and individuals. The results of all of this work are given largely free of charge to the public and are looked on as an aid in the commercial and industrial development of our Nation. There are now more than 20 countries adhering to t\rn International Hydrographic Bureau and the International Geodetic and Geoplwsical Union, or which have expressed their desire to adhere within a short time. 'l'he expense of the delegates from countries other than the United States are paid by their Governments, and it is strono·ly recommended that a similar practice be adopted by the United States. H onr Government furnishes the funds, and is thus able to designate qualified men as official delegates, the position of these representtitives in the conferences will be much stronger than if they attend merely as private individuals. "That is here said in reference to international meetings also applies with equal force to such meetings as are held within the United States.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE WASHINGTON OFFICE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR.

The organization of the Washington office of the bureau is presented by the organization chart opposite. The accomplishments during the fiscal year by divisions and sections follow.
CHrnF CLERIC

The principal duties of this division are the care, custody, and upkeep of the buildings occupied by the bureau; the supervision of the expenditures from the appropriation for office expenses, including the purchase of supplies for the office, for chart printing work, and to some extent for the field; the care and custody of most . of the original records of the field surveys, as well as the library of printed publications kept for the use of the bureau; the general supervision of all matters relating to the personnel work of the bureau, including reports of leaves of absence taken; the custody and accounting for the receipts from the sale of charts and publications, etc.; and the direction of the engineer, electrician, watch, messenger, and labor forces of the bureau, and other employees whose duty has to do with the care and protection of the buildings. The more important accomplishments during the year have been a continuation of the plan to make a thorough renovation of the buildings occupied by the bureau. This work is still in progress. As mentioned in the 1922 annual report, negotiations were under way for the installation in the buildings occupied by the bureau of an ammonia water-cooling plant to supply cool drinkin~ water throughout the buildings. By the end of the fiscal year tlus plant was in place, and the pipes for the circulating of the cool water throughout the buildings were pa1tially installed. The cost of care, maintenance, upkeep, and operation of the buildings occupied by the bureau has been reduced from somewhat less than 26 cents per square foot for the fiscal year 1922 to a little more than 22 cents per square foot for the fiscal year 1923. In the office of the chief clerk the preparation of digests of geodetic publications of the bureau was cqntinued. During the year digests were prepared for five different States. In the library and archives 75 hydrographic and 117. topographic sheets, each representing new surveys made by the bureau, were received. Other additions to the library and archives were blue prints (mostly showing surveys made by Army engineers), 815; maps, 1,856; charts, 2,599; field, office, and observatory records, 4,073.

During the year the expenditure from the appropriation for general expenses of the· bureau was $100,500.74. . The total number of permanent and temporary employees in the office and field forces, which includes commissioned officers and all employees appointed through civil-service certification, is: Office force, .229; field force, 176; total, 405. These figures do not include the persons engaged as rodmen, ch.ainmen, heliotropers, and others· in the field parties nor any enlisted men on vessels of the bureau. The statistics in regard to leaves of absence during the calendar year are: Annual leave, 7,797 days; sick leave, 1,926 days; withoutpay leave, 1,682 days; and accrued leave, 1,587 days. "While the number of employees naturally varied on account of resignations and vacancies, calculated on the number actually in the service on June 30, 1923, as· a basis of comp:utatiori, the average annual leave taken dur.ing the yea1·. by each employee was approximately 19.3 days, and sick leave :4.8 days. ; . The receipts from the sale of charts, publications, etc., a.mounted to $()1,600.84.
DIVISION OF HYDROGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY ·

.· The organization of the division remained the same as during the previous fiscal !ear, namely, three sections-field work, vessels and equipment, an coast pilot-each under a section chief; but in addition to these officers there were from time to time other officers detailed to the division for special work, As a result of such additional ·personnel it has been possible for the first time during many years .to carry on· a considerable amount of· original research tmd investigation which will be of ·benefit to the .buTeau in improving its methods of surveying and to th~ public in expediting the survqs of the country and in making readily available the data obtained by field parties. These investigations include the subjects of improved methods for coastal and offshore hydrographic surveys, of oceanogra'{>hy, and of aero photography. Due to the acqmsition of three able sea-goin~ vessels during the previous fiscal year, t'vo of which were reconditioned and ~lace<1. in service this year and the third nearly completed but not qmte ready for service at the clos~ of .the year, it was necessary to revise the plans for survey work which had been drawn up and adopted last fiscaJ. year .. These plans, as stated in my last annual report, provided for!·a systematic and complete survey of the coasts of the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and the West Indies, based upon the surveying equipment· then available. The addition of three more vessels permitted modification of these plans so as to proceed immediately with parts of the work which had been planned for execution several . . years hence. In .cooperation with members of the Bureau of Standards of the Departme:at of Commerce and of the subaqueous sound-ranging section of the Coast Artillery Corps of the War Department, the division studied the subject ol subaqueous sound ranging as applied to fixing the position of a vessel at sea. Considerable progress had been made at the close of the fiscal year; available apparatus had been acquired and new appnratus designed for this work was under

32

construction and nearing completion. Tests will be made within a few weeks from one of the survey's new vessels. It ·is, of course, too early to state positively what can be expected of this apparatus, but should it operate nearly as satisfactorily afloat as it has on shore there is every reason to believe that the problem of fixing the position of a surveying vessel during fog and haze, and even when beyond vis-. ability of land objects, has been solved. This would easily double the output of a surveying vessel on, say, the Pacific coast of the United States, where much time is lost each year on account of thick weather. During the fiscal years 1919 and 1920 three of the surveying vessels en route to the Pacific coast took sottndings along their tracks and accomplished so much at such insignificant additional cost of their passages that it was decided to require such work hereafter of all suitable vessels while. en route through unexplored waters. Accordingly, plans were made this fiscal year for similar work in connection with the passage of the three new vessels to the .Pacific coast and the return to the Atlantic coast of one of the vessels which went around in the fiscal year 1920. In order that these several surveys might be properly coordinated, that each sounding might be so placed as to reveal the greatest possible amount of information, nnd that as large an area as possible of the oceans might be adequately surveyed, a careful study was made of all available information concerning the waters through which these vessels must pass, and in the light of this information minute instructions were preparE>Al for the commanding officer of .each vessel. During the year three of the vessels accomplished the passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific. The data furnished by these vessels, together with the data. supplied by the earlier passages, was made the subject of study and a report :which went to press just prior to the close of the fiscal year. During the latter half of the fiscal year an officer was engaged continuously upon study, interpretation, and discussion of the photographs of the Mississipfi River Delta, taken by naval aviators in the latter part of lust fisca year. This is perhaps the largest area ever surveyed by aerophototopography based upon adequate ground control (high-grade triangulation), and the results of this survey will go far toward clearing up any doubts that exist as to the practicability of this method of land surveying with present equipment. A full report upon the field and office methods pursued, the degree of accuracy secured, and cost of field and office operations will be published within a few weeks. The section of vessels and equipment maintained supervision over the vessels and other flouting equipment, passed upon repairs and purclrnse of equipment, preparing plans and specifications when required. In addition to its usual routine duties in connection with the above-named work, it supervised the completion of the two vessels .which were undergoing alterations last fiscal year and got out plans and specifications for reconditioning a third similar vessel and super1,ised the ·work on that vessel. The last vessel was nearly ready for service at the close of the year. Preliminary plans were prepared for the construction of two steam tenders for duty in Alaskan waters.

Plans were prepared and arrangements made for the construction of two surveymg power launches to be equiP,ped with a new type of control which promises to eliminate the difficulties that have been experienced in getting dee:p soundings from a craft propelled by an internal-combustion engme. So much trouble has been encountered in getting soundings in depths too great for the hand lead from craft propelled by gas engines or other engines of the internalcombustion type that there is a strong sentiment in the service in favo1~ of returniniS' to steam launches for this kind of hydrography. Accordingly, considerable study has been given to the subject of con, trolling of launches propelled by internal-combustion engines in the hope of finding some means to a void returning to the inefficient small steam engine for hydrographic launches. The coast pilot section published the United States Coast Pilot of the Hawaiian Islands and the Coast Pilot, Section D, Cape Henry to Key West. · Field revision 'vas carried on for a new edition of Section C, Sandy Hook to Cape Hcmi.·y, and Coast Pilot Alaska, Part I. Supplements of the following volumes were compiled and printed as the needs reqnired: Coast Pilot, Section A; Coast Pilot, Section B; Coast Pilot, California, Oregon, and Washington; Alaska, Part 2; Philippine Islands: Part 1 ; Coast Pilot, Section E; and Inside Route Pilot, New York to Key ·west.

· One of the best evidences of the bureau's service to the public is through the issue of its cha.rts. Although the demand has fallen off somewhat since the war peak, it is still much above that of pre-war times. · An examination of the total issue of charts since the 1920 peak shows an· appreciable decrease in sales until last year, then a very slight increase7 and a moderate decrease in· free issues and condemned:·· · · The pronounced inactivity of our merchant marine is a matter of more than passi~g interest. . The. shipping news in the daily n~ws p·ap~rs and ~rt1cles appearm~ m financial and other niagazmes detail the var10us phases of this problem. · The division's policy of giving /recedence to the correction of existing charts has been continue , and new prints and editions have been sent to the presses whenever important information warranted. The printing of limited editions minimizes hand-correction work and prevents a needless waste of paper. The £ew back orders r~sulting £~om this practice have been ta.lien up promptly by immediate prmtmg. · · ' An added ,:feature to the weekly Notice to Marinei:s 1 instituted in May, 1923, in cooperation with the Bureau of Lighthouses and the Hydrographic Office, consist$ in publishing in bold-face type the numbers of charts to which hand corrections will be made of the information contained in each notice. · STATUS OF 1923 CHART PnoonAM.-The chart program :for 1928 contemplated the completion of 10 new charts, the reconstruction of 13 charts, and the construction of 3 new :maps. At the close of the fiscal year there remained unfinished 3 new and 2 reconstructed charts. However, the program was expanded to in.elude 2 new and 3 reconstructed charts and 1 new map, all 0£ which were accom· plished. ' This program was materially modified and seriously i~terrupted J:>1 important miscellaneous work which necessi~ate~ its reconstruction to some extent. · The precedence of special items natural!y caused considerable delay, and properly so, because a program of this nature should be flexible. The actual accomplishment was highly Satisfactory, and the total 'Chart construction work finished, including that outlined on th~ program7 special assignments, and additional construction, exceeded that originally contemplated. . The construction of new charts is not always the best measure of work accomplished, for tw'o principal reasons: The amount of compilation and sm.ooth 'dra~i~g work vary ~rea~ly for ~ifferent ch.arts, and the correct10n of ex1stmg charts, wluch is a decidedly variable quantity, is always given precedence over all other classes of work.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAS'.C AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The compilation o:f new charts on the 1923 program occupied lOt per cent of the total working time· of the drafting section, while the allotted time for the program for 1924 contemplates 13! per cent. CHART CoNSTRUCTION.-Atlantia Ooa,st.-The reconstruction chart program for the Atlantic coast is partially accomplished and now awaits completion of additional surveys. The charts covering this coast from Maine to Cape Hatteras conform to the latest specifications; from Cape Hatteras to the Gulf, the old and new series intermingle, new where recent surveys warrant, elsewhere old, diagonal; double-unit, polycouic charts. Recharting of this section will progress as rapidly as new surveys are made. On the Gulf coast the new series is completed from Pensacola to but not including the Delta of the Mississippi River and :from Atchafalaya Bay to the Rio Grande, the more important areas being based on recent surveys. From the Brazos River to the Rio Grande the new charts are based on old surve;Ys, which is justified by the minor importance of this area, which it is thought does not require new surveys at this time. This same :policy of reconstructing charts without waiting for modern surveys will be extended during the coming fiscal year to the west coast of Florida, and it is hoped to complete the new series from Cape Sable to Tampa Bay. The modification of existing charts of the ·west Indian Islands is dependent on the surveys now in progress, aft~r the completion of which certain harbor charts of the Virgin Islands will be required. . Pacific coast.-On the Pacific coast the existing charts conform to the 1atest specifications, the work on the charts bemg limited to the correction of the present charts from new surveys by this and other organizations. Alaska.-A series of new charts of the waters along the west coast of Prince of Wales Island is being expedited· as rapidly as the surveys are received. General reconstruction of Alaska charts is still postponed pending completion and adjustment o:f the precise triangulation and of various subordinate loops radiating therefrom. For western Alaska the problem consists in the application of new surveys to existing charts. A large scale chart may be necessary to 'meet the requirements of the surveys now being made by the Navy by airplane and sonic device methods. Hawaiian lslari.ds.-There is no new work in sight. . Philipp~ne Islands.-The first charts printed in Manila after the establishment of the printing plant were made in February, 1922. During the fiscal year 1923 no less than 22,200 charts were printed from this plant in addition to the reproduction of one of the Philippine Islands topographic maps. Since the establishment of thi~ plant new charts and new editions of charts are transferred to aluminum and reproduced long before the smooth drawings could reach Washington for the same process. Thus the charts are placed in the hands or the public at a much earlier date. For the convenience of yachtsmen and owners of small craft a new series of charts is in project and will be finished during the year covering the inside water route f;rom Norfolk to Key West.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

37

This series will consist of 10 charts, 22 by 30 inches, printed 6n bond paper, each containing a number of strips from 6 to 8 inches wide. The strips are assembled la1·gely from the published series of 1: 80,000 charts. · The route as described in the· Inside Route Pilots will be shown by a heavy red line and the soundings will be .charted in feet. Certain outside areas on the coast where the route passes through open waters will also be included. This series will further meet the demands of the yachtsmen and small craft owners in that the charts may be cut into strips and carried in folders which will readily adapt themselves to limited spaces. To meet demands from Government organizations and commercial interests permission was obtained thro~h the department to issue a navigational chart of Lake Tahoe, valif. and Nev. The shore line is a compilation :from Government sources and the· hydrography from. a special survey by this bureau. At the close of the fiscal year this chart was on the presses. Upon urgent requests of companies interested in the development of new oil fields a special survey and chart was completed of Icy Bay, southern Alaska. On the recommendation of the board of surveys and maps, a new general map of the United States, scale 1: 2,500,000, on Albers Conical Equal-Area projection with two standard parallels, is in preparation jointly by various member organizations of that board. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has been allotted the task of constructing and inking the projection and adding the shore lines and international boundaries, other bureaus undertaking thereafter to fill in the interior topography and complete the map. The dimensions of the completed map will· be approximately 48 by 77 inches between neat lines. For convenience in handling, the drawing is to be made on a scale of 1 : 2,000,000 in nine sections, each 19.8 by 31.!) inches between neat lines. The Albers Equal-Area projection, like the Lambert Conformal Conic projection, is especially suited for a map having a predominating east-and-west dimension, but while the maximum scale errors of the two are prnctically equal when the same standards are used (about 1! per cent) the Albers projection is equal area while the Lambert is not. Other projections now in use for maps of the United .States have scale errors as great as 7 per cent. The projection has been completed in the chart division and the mapping of the shore line is now in hand. A special drawing table and a beam compass arm 15 feet in length were necessary for constrncting this projection. The bureau also has in hand, for issue during the coming fiscal year, a new outline base maf of Alaska on the Lambert Conformal Conic projection on a scale o 1 : 2,500,000, which is double the scale of the one published a year ago. The size of this outline map is 33~ by 4.4 inches. Delineation of the coast line is from the latest surveys, and only important place names are given, thus permitting ample space for the plotting of any special information that may be desired. The

map extends from the Arctic Ocean on the north to Dixon Entrance on the south and includes the Aleutian Islands and a part 0£ eastern Siberia. It presents the coast line as a whole in one map in a more nearly true shape than heretofore. This map will be available :for general dish·ibution as a companion map to the one showing the same territory on a scale of 1: 5,000,000. On account of the predominating east-and-west extent of Alaska,. the Lambert Conformal Conic projection adds to the general accuracy and offers advantages over other projections generally used in mapping this region. A new series of three topographic maps of the Virgin Islands compiled from surveys by this bureau on a s~'ale of 1 : 40,000 were printed and issued to meet urgent demands from official and commercial sources. Special outline or base maps of Alaska on the Lambert Conformal Conic projection on a scale of 1: 2,500,000 were prepared £or the use of the presidential and other Government parties in connection with their visits to that Territory. The progress of hydrographic surveys in Alaska. and data showing various other Federal Government activities in the Territory, such as forest and fisheries reservations and locations of coal and other mineral mines, important canneries, pulp mills, and reported oil fields, were indicated by overprinting in colors).. the condition of water surveys being shown on one map and the uovernment activities grouped· on another. In addition the latter ;nap showed the steamer tracks and distances between various points along the coast. · · .. A special steamer-route chart, ·with distances, of British Columbia · waters was also prepared for the same parties. This series of maps and charts received the warm commendation of the numerous individuals to whom it W\l.S furnished. A series of charts in strips showing the inside route from Fernandina to Key 1Vest, Fla., with additional special information, was prepared :for use of the President and party on a trip through those waters. This series was received with appreciation and much :favorable comment was made on the convenient method of showing this inside water route.

There has been a larger increase in the number of requests for in~ formation, due largely to the digests and circular letters sent out by the chief clerk's oftice, cnlling uttention to the results of the work of the bureau available for the use of engineers and surveyors. Over 900 such requests were received during the year. In addition, over 600 letters were prepared .concerning reports on the present con, dition of magnetic stations. As a result practically the entire time of one computer was occupied with th.is work, and it was only with the assistance of clerks in other di visions (chiefly cha1ts) that this mass of correspondence could be handled in addition to the other clerical work of the division. 'Vith a considerable portion of the time of another computer taken up with special investigations, training of observers, and testing of instruments, it was only with the assistance of two temporary computers loaned by the division of geodesy that it was possible to keep up with the routine reduction of field and observatory work. Additwnal computers and an additional clerk are ur~ently needed to permit the proper development of the work of the division. Progress was made in the plans for the establishment of a compass school for_ junior officers in cooperation with the division of hydrography and topography, the most important item being the Qrepara.tion of Instructions for the Compensation of the Magnetic Compass, a publication intended primarily for the use of officers of the bureau, but one which it is expected will be found very useful by the merchant marine. It was sent to the printer in June. Special publication No. 90, Magnetic Declination .in the United States for January 1, 1920, was completed and published and met with ~mcl:>. a large demand that a reprint had to be ordered before the end ,of the year. This ·contains the information regarding the earth's magnetism most likely to be .needed by the surveyor using a compnss, together with directions for determining the true meridian. Magnetic Declination in Arkansas was prepared and sent to the print<'r in June. This is the first of a series of publications giving for the States separately more dett1iled information regarding the magnetic declination and its change with the lapse of time. The recent field work in Florida has rendered the data for that State very nearly complete, and it will be the next publication to be issued. An intensive cumpaign bas been made to secure information re· garding the .!?resent condition of our magnetic stations in California; Missouri, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, with a view to replacing missing stations where necessary and then getting out publications similar to the one for Arknnsas. The Sitka and Porto Rico Observatory results £or 1919 and 1920 were completed, prepared for publication, and sent to the printer. The Tucson Observatory results for 1919 and 1920 were computed, and their preparation for printing was ·nearly completed. ·· Modifications in the method of publication were adopted which i" is estimated will reduce ~e cost of publication about 55 per cent. The most important change 1s the photographic reproduction of the principal tables, thuis eliminating the cost of typesetting and proof re~.d_ing. In the reprodu?tion of the principal. magnetic storm~ .~he or1gihal magnetograms win be photographed directly, and the mak. ' ' . ' ; '· .·· 1;

ing of vellum tracings will thus be avoided. In the case of the above results this change involved considerable additional labor, as all of the tables had to be copied on to. new forms. Progress was made in the computation of the observatory results for 1921 and 1922 to the extent that those for 1921 are about half completed and those for 1922 about one-fifth. The computation of the field results was kept up to date, and the , results were sent to ·the local surveyors interested as soon as they were ready. The results of the work done in 1922 were submitted for publication in Ma;v. · Proof was read of the Honolulu and Cheltenham Observatory results for 1919 and 1920, Magnetic Declination in the United States for 1920, and Horizontal Intensity Variometers, by George Hartnell, magnetic observer. The earthquake recorded at the five magnetic observatories were tabulated monthly, and the results were transmitted to the Weather Bureau for publication in the Monthly Weather Review and to va.rious persons engaged in the study of earthquake data. Special investigations were made of the theory of the propagation of earthquake waves and of the operation of seismographs. Additional lantern slides were prepared illustrative of the work in seismology. The results of special observations made at the five magnetic observatories at the time of the solar eclipse of Septembe1:, 1922, were tabulated and sent to the Journal of Terrestrial Magnetism for publication. Special observations made in the vicinity of Birmingham, Ala~, to investigate the possibility of locating nonmagnetic iron ore by means of magnetic instruments were discussed, and a copy of th:e results was sent to W. R. Crane, of the Bureau of Mines, at whose request the work had been undertaken. A table giving the values of the magnetic declination and annual change for places in all parts of the United States was prepared for the 1924 edition of the World Almanac. The division performed its alloted share of the marking of the examination papers of candidates for the position of deck officer and junior engineer. The chief and the assistant chief of the division attended the meetings of the Geophysical Union in April and presented reports and papers before the sections of terrestrial magnetism, seismology, and oceanography. At the meeting of the section of terrestrial magnetism a resolution was adopted designating the Cheltenham magnetic observatory, in conjunct10n with the standardizing observatory of the department of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, as the observatory in the United States at which international comparisons of instruments are to be made. A considerable portion of the time of the chief of the division was devoted to the study of problems relating to the application of new methods to secure the accurate determination of position in offshore hydrography. Compass data were supplied for 80 charts.
DIVISION OF TIDES AND OURRENTS.

The division of tides and currents has charge of. the tidal and current work of all the coasts of the United States and Alaska and is

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AN~ GEODETIC SURVEY.

41

the only organization ·under· the Federal Government having to do with the :predictions of tides and currents. The work of the division is comprised under the following heads: Tidal .observations and computations; cunent observations u.nd computations; advance predictions of tides and currents, and preparation in advance of annual tables of tide and current predictions; tidal and current surveys of o~r prin?ipal har~or~; physic8:1 ocea_nogr!Lphy; and the preparation of techmcal pubhcat10ns dealmg with tides, cU:nents, and related · phenomena. Tidal observations were made at six principal stations on the Atlantic coast, three on the Gulf coast, five on the Pacific coast, one in Alaska, and one at Honolulu, Hawaii. Observations of currents were· made at six light vessels on the Atlantic coast and one on. the ·Pacific coast. · Computations on the relation between wind and current :were made for the light vessel observations on both coasts, in order: to -correlate wind and current for the preparation of current diagrams for the aid of the'navigator in estimating the current, due both to tide and wind effects. The results of this work appeared as a separate current table for the calendar year 1923. These current observations made along our Pacific and Atlantic coasts have hr.ought out the important fact that, contrary to the belief of the marmer, a local wind creates a current not in its own direction but in a direction about 15° to the right of the wind and. a velocity in knots per hour of about 2 per cent of the velocity of the wind in miles per hour on the Pacific coast and about 11 per cent on the Atlantic. For example, a local south wind of 40 miles per hour on the Pacific coast creates a current setting about N. 15° E., arid its velocity would ·be 40 by 0.02=0.8 knots per hour. These figures are not exact as taken from the observations but are sufficiently close for practical purposes and have therefore been furnished the m~riner as formmg a good working rule. The importance of the discovery that the set of the current is to the right of the wind direction lies in the fact that a wind blowing parallel with the coast may produce a current which tends to set a vessel on shore, a fact which until now has been unsuspected by the navigator. For a number of years, by process of evolution as data became. available, a considerable amount of information of interest and value to the mariner has been incorporated into Table 4 in the back of the Tide Tables published 'annually in advance by this bureau. Within the past few years the importance to the marine!' of accurate current data along the coasts has been brou~ht .to the attention of Congress, and the interest of Congress in this important matter is reflected in the increase of appropriations for obtaining the necessary series of observations to permit the survey to obtain data on which to base conclusions and to make predictions of. coastal currents. This increase in data and knowledge of our coastal currents has. now warranted the separation of this material in Table 4 from the Tide Tables and the publication of separate volumes dealing with ~urrents .only. T~is .was done f.or the calendar year 1923, when the current mformatlon appeared m two forms: Current. Tables, .Atlantic 0oast1 North America, and Current Tables, Pacific Coast, North America.

42

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY~

The Atlantic Coast Current Tables for 1924 are ready for issue; those for the Pacific coast are in the hands of the printer and will be issued early in the next fiscal year, The predictions of tides and currents for the 1924 tide and current tables were made and the manuscript submitted for printing in five i;ieparate parts: Tide Tables, Atlantic Coast; Tide Tables, Pacific Coast; Tide Tables, United States and Foreign Ports; Current Tables, Atlantic Coast; and Current Tables, Pacific Coast. All except the Pacific Coast Current Tables are ready for issue. During the past few years a policy has been adopted by the bureau of advancing each year by one month the time of submitting to the printer the ditferent tide and current tables with the end in view of hawing all tables ready for issue six months before the beginning of the year for which predicted. This end has now been accomplish~d with all the tables except the .Pacific Coast Current Tables, which will be issued this year five months ahead instead of six months. The following table, showing the number of copies of the tide tables issued for each year since 1915, is indicative of the usefulness of these publications:

In addition, the public receives the benefit of these predictions through the medium of the daily newspapers, a great many of which publish the tidal data in their colunms, these data being :furnished them by the Coast and Geodetic Survey directly or by means of the published annual tide 1 tables. ·
DIVISION OF

As usual, the field work consisted of the extension of the control systems for geographic positions and elevations, the determination of latitude; longitude, an'd ·azimuth by astronomic observations, the measurement of base lines and the determination of the intensity of gravity.' The several projects, either completed or on which progress was made during the year, are as follows: :r 1. The triangulation which is to run from the vicinity of Pocatello, Idaho~ northward to the Canadian boundary2 was about half completed during the fiscal year by a party working. during the season of 1922 and in the spring of 1923. In the spring of 1923 a base line was measured in the vicmity of Bozeman, Mont. 2. In ,Tune, 1923, a base line was measured in the vicinity of Havre, Mont., near the intersection of the forty-ninth parallel and the one hundred an:d ·ninth meridian, and after this measurement the· P8:rlY' beg~~ preci~ triangulation workin~ ·westward from the base.il1ne. · Th1.s ·work is a part of a cooperative plan between the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Geodetic Survey of Canada, by which precise triangulation will be executed from the Pacific coast, along the international boundary, to Lake Superior. The Coast and Geodetic Survey will complete the work to the westward of the one hundred and ninth meridian and between the Lake of the Woods and a point on the boundary a short distance to the westward of Lake Superior. The Geodetic Survey of Canada will undertake the work from the Lake of the Woods westward to the one hundred and ninth meridian. This great arc of precise triangulation will adequately meet the needs of the two countries for surveys and maps along their eo~?n:~o;r~~r~ If thi.s cooperative arrangem~nt liad not been enterOO. intoi"eac!lr~Q:'Y woUJ.d!· ha'V'e· peen··reqmred to execute an arc in its ?wn: t-erritory -ci~~~.tli'e· boundary to meet its surveying and mappmg needs. '· 3.. k·primary traverse was run from the vicinity of Cape Henry Va., southward along the coast to Currituck Sound N. C. This work was done to furnish horizontal control stations 'for hydrographic and topographic surveys of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. . 4. A traverse was· extended to the southwest from the mouth of the Cape Fear River. Its southern end is in the vicinity of My1·tle Beach, S. C. It is ex.Pected that this traverse will be completed to Charleston, S. C., durmg the fiscal year 1924. · 'd5~ ·The ·ha.verse party which executedfrojects 3 and 4, mentit>ned a;bov~ ~lso: executed a small amount o triangulation in the Cape Fear R1v~r, '. N. C., ~n order to coordinate previous surveys and to leave stations on which to base new surveys. · 6. A precise base line was measured in Puget Sound just to the north of Tacoma, Wash. Some observations were also made to strenW-hen the tr1angU.lation done a number of years ago in the Vicinity of Tacoma, Wash. ' 7. Upon request ·of the commissioners of the Supreme Court for .the boundary· between Texas and Oklahoma two parties were or~anized by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, which made a recon-· na.ISSance, erected signals, and made observations for the precise tria.~gulation which will extend along the boundary westward from the' triangulation of the ninety-eighth to the one hundredth meridian. From there the triangulation will turn northward, and a connection

will· be made with the existing arc of triangulation running westward from the vicinity of El Reno, Okla. By the end of the fiscal
, year the reconnaissance and signal building had been completed. The observing for the triangulation will be completed early in the fiscal yeur 1923. By the agreement made between the commissioners and the Coast and Geodetic Survey all of the field expenses except the pay and allowances of tlw commissio1wd officers detailed for the work were paid from funds 1tvailable to the boundary commissioners. 8. 'l'he l'f'conrntissance arnl triangu lnt:ion which had been started late in the fiscal year 1922 to the northward of Cook Inlet were continued during the summer of 1922 and in the spring of ·1923. The triangulation follows very closely the railroad which runs from Anchorage northward to Fairbanks. 9. Shortly after the beginning of the fiscal year a party was organized in California which reoccupied a number of old precise triangulation stations in order to .detect, if possible, what movements of the ground had taken place since the first establishment of the stations from 25 to 40 years ago. This party started its work from the stations Round Top and Mount. Lola, near the eastern.boundary of California, and extended its work westward to the coast and thence to the south a short distance beyond Mount Hamilton. It will be necessary to establish astronomic longitude stations at some of the triangulation stations occupied before final results of this testing of the stability of the ground will be available. This work was resumed by a trian.gulation party in the spring of 1923, and this party was m operation at the close of the fiscal year. · · 10. At the request of Prof. A. A. Michelson, of the University of Chicago, observations were made in the vicinity of .Mount Wilson and San Antonio Peak, Calif., from which to determine with extreme accuracy ·the distance between Hvo points established on those peaks which will be used by him in the determination of the velocity of light. In order that the work might be done with sufficient accuracy for the 1purpose a base line was measured over the plain. to the southward of the range on which Mount 'Wilson and San Antonio Peak are situated. Many difficulties had to be ovel'Come in the measurement of this base, which was nearly 22 miles long, because of the ruggedness of the country and the presence of many orange groves. In spite of the handicaps the party successfully measured the base. In order to refer the length of the base line to the line between the two peaks in question, observations for horizontal and vertical angles were made at a number of points and the astronomic latitude and azimuth were determined at a number of the triangulation stations involvec1 in the determination of the distance between the two peaks. 11. The important arc of precise triangulation extending from the vicinity o:f Pecos, Tex., northward thl'ougn eastern New Mexico and then mto Colorado to the thirty-ninth parallel was completed during the summer of 1922. "\Vork on this arc had been started during the ver:r ear~y spring of that year.. A number of monuments along the boundaries between New Mexico and Texas and New Mexico and Colorado were connected to the precise triangulation, thus enabling map makers to place these boundaries, or at least 11 part of them, jn their true geographical positions. ~any of th~ houndaries betwern States of the Union were established astronomienlly, ancl. owing to the deflections of the vertical at the astro-

nomic stations ocCUJ?ied in connection with the boundary surve;vs, th~ boundaries.in·quest10n are found not to be along u geographic parallel or meridian when eonnections are made between the boundaries and the J?recise triangulation systems _of the ~ountry. . 12.,:Pr1or to about 1909 triangulat10n stat10ns were marked m n 1·ather inconspicuous way, and as a result the surface marks at u number of the old triangulation stations were destroyed either thoughtlessly or maliciously. There was nothing on the marks, which usually consisted of blocks of concrete or stone, to show what they represented. Since 1909 properly inscribed metal tablets have been set into concrete or stone to mark triangulation and other surveying: stations of this bureau. All of the. trian~ulation along the th1rtyninth parallel· was completed prior to the adoption of the metat tablets, and many of the surface marks of the stations have beell' removed. A party of the Const and Geodet.ic Survey was assigned the· duty of recovering and i·e-marking and also redescribing triangulat10n stations along that portion of the thirty-ninth parallel; which runs through Missouri, Kansas, and into eastern Colorado:.. This work was completed during the season of 1922, and the part_y doing that work also recovered, re-marked, and redescribed some of the stations along the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation: in Kansas. 13. The line of levels extending from Rouses Point, at the Canadian boundary, in northeastern New York, to Portland, Me., was com_pleted .during the season of 192~. 'Vork on this line. ha~ be~un durmg the last month of the p1:e~1<?us fiscal year.. This lme is ·a pairt;ofthe.general plan for the Jommg of the p1·ec1se level systems of the United ·states. and ..Cana.do. iri order to avoid discrepancies in elevation in· surveying,· mapping, ··and other engineering work along the boundary between the two countries. . 14. During the season of 1922 a line of precise leveling was extended froii:i Yonkers, N. Y., along the i:ailroad, _puralle~ing the coast of Connecticut, to the Rhode Island lme. Tlus levelmg wa.s connected with bench murks established at a number of places along the coast a~ reference points for tidal observutio~s. made in the p~st, and also with the bench marks of a number of cities through which the line ran. This line was run at the request of the Director o:f the U. S. Geoloaical Survey, !Uld thn.t orgumzation cooperated to the extent: of £urni~1ing an n.utomobile truck for the transportation of the.party. 15. During the spring and early summer of 1923 precise leveling was executed in Connecticut from New Haven northward through Hartford, Conn., to Springfield, Mass., eastward from Hartford· to the Rhode Island line, and west'furd from the vicinity of Hartford. to East Morris, Conn. This leveling .in Connecticut during the spring of 1923 was done at the request of the U. S. Geological Survey, and a transfer of funds from the appropriation made for the work of that bureau was made to the Coast and Geodetic Survey to. pay about half the expenses of the field work. ·· 16. The precise leveling which was done in Wisconsin during the· latter. fart of the fiscal year 1922 was continued during the early part' ;9 . the fiscal year .1923. The levelin~ in quest~on extends ove1the lme. of traverse which had been estnblished durmg the previous calendar year. The line starts at Duluth, Minn., and runs. through

Ladysmith an~ La01~a Ju~ction to Green Bay, Wis. When the work was complete m Wisconsm the party was transferred to southern Illinois, where a short line of levels was run in response to a request of the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey. '.','.c 17. Precise leveling was started in Montana, just to the northward of Yellowstone Park,·late in the fiscal year 1923. This work will be continued during the fiscal year 1924 and will provide elevations along a number of roads through the National Park. , There will also be leveling done to the southwest and the southeast of the park for furnishing elevations for topographic surveys by the U.S. Geological Survey. This work was done at the request of the Dir~tor of the U. S. Geological· Survey, and most of the expenses of the work are being paid by money transferred from that 1bureau to the Coast and Geodetic Survey. · ·:.·.. · 18. A short line of precise leveling was run in the State of Washington between Burlington and Anacortes for the purpose of connecting a tidal station at the latter place with the line of precise levels which runs northward from Seattle into Canada. . 19. A small amount of precise leveling was done in the District of Columbia in order to determine the elevations of· o. ·number 'of.,tidaJ bench marks. · 20. Precise leveling was done during the summer of 1922 and the spring of 1923 in Alaska along the railroad which runs from Anchorage northward to Fairbanks and along the highway from the latter place so:utheastward to Valdez. This leveling has been requested by the U. S. Geological Survey for a nU.mber'of years!t!itnd1the·l~k of elevations 11;long the:routes has retarded or greatly handicapped the topogra_ph1c survey'IDg by that bureau. · ·., 21. The dIStrict engmeer of the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army stationed at Duluth, Minn., has been cooperating with the Coast and Geodetic Survey by testing the stability of a ·number of bench marks established in the vicinity of that place. It is well known. that the action of frost will lift blocks of stone and concrete unless .special precautions are taken in the design of the blocks. ~h.e bench marks in question were of yario~s sizes an.d sh!l'peBi·and 1t is hoped that, from the results obtamed m the teatmg,' it will be learned which is the best type of mark to use in high latitudes where there is much frost action. 22. About 50 miles of precise leveling were run in southern Caliiornie. in the vicinity of the base line which was measured in con-' nection with the determination of the distance between Mount Wilson .and San Antonio Peak, mentioned above. · .· ·. 23. During the summer of 1923 the astronomic latitud& and ldngi~ tude and the intensity ·of gravity were determined at a number··of traverse stations in Wisconsin and at a number of triangulation 'stations in New Mexico and Colorado. The longitude work depended -0n the receipt of time signals from the Annapolis radio station·which were recorded automatically on a chrono~apli. It was '.:found that the differences in longitude determined m this way were at least equal in accuracy to the deter~inations which had .~een m~de for a number of years by means of- signals sent over telegraph wires. 24. A party determined the value of gravitY. at a number of p~~~ jn Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas to determme whether there is"a relation between the value of gravity and the 1densities of material

below the earth's .surface. At the Pt?int selected for the observations the densities of material were well k:Ilown from borings for oil. · This work was done at the request of the U. S. Geological Survey, and if it is found that there is a decided change in the value of gravity with a change iii.subsurface density, it is possible that the pendulum may be ·1U~ 1 for the discovery of extra light or extra heavy material which will be of val~ in oil investigations. A discussion of the data collected will be made by the staff M the U. S. Geological Survey.

Automatic tide gauges were kept in operation throughout·the year at 6 stations on the Atlantic coast, 3 stations on the Gulf coast, 6 stations on the Pacific coast, 1 station in Alaska, .and 1 station·in the Hawaiian Islun<ls, a total o:f 16 years o:f records. In addition, tidal observations in connection with hydrographic surveys were made at 19 stations in the United States, with a combined length of ·6 years 5.o months; 1 station in Porto Rico, with a length of 9.8 months; 12 stations in Alaska, with a combined len~h of 2 years 10.7 months; 2 stations in the Hawaiian Islands, wiff1 a combined length of 5.7 months; 4 stations in the Philippine Islands, with a combined length of 4.1 months; 2 stations in the Canal Zone, 2 years in combined length; 17 stations received from outside sources, with a combined len~h of 12 years 5.2 months of record; and 17 small series stations, witn an aggregate len~h of 6.6 months; mak,ing a grand total of 41 vears 11.4 months of tidal records received. · · TAPE GAUGE.-An automatic tide gauge was installed at Atlantic City, on the steel pier, and as the roughness of the water in this locality made the use of a plain tide staff impracticable the ..tape gauge was designed ns n substitute.

This station, located at the :foot 0£ South Baylen Street and fitted with the usual equipment, is in charge of E.W. Holcomb, meteorologist of the U. S. Weather ;Bureau.. Temperature and density observations, in addition to tidal observat10ns will be made. · The new fleld automatic tide gauge, which was devised during the year 1922 and constructed at this office, has been thoroughly tested on the Potomac River at Washington for minor improvements and has proven to be a very satisfactory surveying instrument. This. new gau~e, which is portable, will aid in securing better observations for use m ~qn~e~tion with h;rdrograpp.ic ~ur.vey~ and. obvi!lte the necessity of· mlinitammg one ·or more pa1d tide observers with each hydrographic party, thus securing increased accuracy at considerably decreased cost.

RYDROGRAPHIO WORK.

It has been found convenient to arrange. this work in the form of separate projects. These· projects may be divided into two cl~s, ~ follows: (1) Unchangeable areas, (2)' chan~eable areas which will reqµire cobtinuing·operation.S ·for an mdefimte period. ;;IJ;l't}l~:'.fi~t ·class t:iiere· are offshore hydrogra~hy of the Atla~tio 'and Pacific coasts; 'Wire-drag work on the.Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, including Porto Rico and southeast Alaska; the first complete survey of certain sections of southern and western Alaska, which are of immediate commercial importance. No estimate is made of the Aleutian Islands west of Unalaska, most .of the area in Bering Se~ or Arctic Alaska, since their commercial development seems to belong tO' the ·distant future. For the offshore wol'k we have planned to go seaward to a depth of 100 fathoms in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico and to a depth of 1,000 fathoms ·in the· Pacific Ocean. When .these.ocean surveys ~ave been accon_iplished in !1<?cordance m.th pres~nt· standards; there will be no necessity for additional work m·sfde'?ofithe '1-00~fathom .depths on the· Atlantic Ocean':and' Gulf of M:(ixfoo·ana·tM 1 1';-ooo:..iratho~. depths' on -the: Pacific. Ocean; except in those places of conip'f!-'tli.tively shallow depths; such as Georges Bank, ·Nantucket Shoals, Diamond· Shoals, and the shallow coastal waters which are: subject to· ~onstant changes. Likewise, after the surveys of the designated sect10ns of Alaska, the Hawaiian, and Philippine ·waters have been completed, the only additional work that will be· re~ quired in these areas will be such· as may result :from changes in localities of shallow depth, or where greatly increased commercia1 importance necessitates more detailed surveys. of small bodies. of 1Vater,,-or where changes have resulted from public works undertaken ~ub$equent to the original survey, and work in the Bering Sea· and Arctic 0cean. · . . · 1'he second class of work__:...chart revision and the resurvey of. the bays a'nd· .inside waters of· the Atlantic and Pacific coa$ts of the United StateeFand; to a lesser extent, of Alaska. and the insular possess~on~m.ust be.'cattied on indefinitely, just ·as we ·are to:day ::esurveymg waters that· have been adequately surveyed several times lli the past. This is·dUIHo'the fact that the forces of nature are continuo~~ly c~tti';lg out a~d building up along the entire shore ~here t.he formation is not solid rock, and also to the .fact that the industrial development of the country is continuously- ohan~ing both' the water;ways and shore line by dredging 'Channelsh· filling in, conskucting ;:>i~l'S, and other works.

HEPORT OF DIRECTOH, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The oceanographic work which tlae bureau should carry on can not be treated as a project on which any time limit for completion can be given. At the present time there is an urgent need for the detail of one able vessel on this work on the Atlantic coast, for the exploration of the Gulf Stream is one of the problems that was laid down in the organic act creating the Coast Survey. We have done very little work of this kind in the hundred and more years of the existence of the survey, and no work of any consequence has been done within the last 30 years. These projects do not include all of the work that should be performed by the bureau in the line of hydrography and topography, but it is believed that they do include all the projects that sho'1ld be undertaken at this time or in the near future, the other work to ,be deferred until the completion of some of these projects. After the completion of any of these projects the personnel and equipment that had been employed on the project will be available for other work. This other work includes hydrographic investigations beyond the limits of the present projects and other special investigations. It is clearly the duty of this country to perform its share of ocean investigation, and there is a large field for such investigation in the Atlantic ·Ocean and Gulf of Mexico contiguous to our coast but outside of. the .100-fathom contour. There is a like need for such work in the Pacific Ocean outside of the 1,000-fathom contour, which is comparatively close to our coast. There are fishing banks seaward of the 1,000-fathom contonr in the Pacific Ocean that should be investigated for the benefit of our fisheries. There is a stretch of unexplored wiiter extending hundreds· of miles west of :the Hawaiian group through ·which our ships are required to pass. These waters are known to contain many shoals, reefs, and rocks that are a menace to navigation . .The survey of these waters, together with resurveys of the shallow, changeable offshore waters, would fully employ any equipment and personnel that would be released ,on t11e completion of any of the projects which require similar equipment. ·WIRE DRAG, ATI..ANTIC AND GuLF CoAsTs.-Area to be dragged, 5,000 square miles (3,000 square miles of this area are on the coast of Maine .and includes much deep water). Owing to lack of appropriations, it has been impossible to do any work on this project during the last fiscal year, but a party was in the field at the close of the fiscal year and work was to commence early in July. ATI.ANTIC AND Gu.LI? CoAsTs.-Area 0£ offshore work required, 162,000 square miles. PoRTO Rwo AND Vrno1N IsLANDs.-Area wire-drag work required, approximately 200 square miles, mostly in Vieques Sound. All harbors should be surveyed and coastal water should be dragged. P acIFic CQABT, CALIF., W ASH.-Area wire-drag work required, 1_,360 square miles. No work has been done on this project, owing to lack of equipment and money. CALIFORNIA, WASHINGTON, OREGoN.-Area offshore surveys, 63,300 square miles. This project is divided into the following three sections, !>Wing to the different conditions existing in each : San Diego to Point Conception: Area, 17,000 square miles: Two vessels worked on this project from November to February, and work in this locality will be resumed during the next fiscal year. Point Conception to Cape Blanco: The area required to be covered is 18,300 square miles.

For admin~ istrative purposes it should be considered in the s~me class as the changeable areas on the continental coasts of the Umted States. Ad~ ditional surveys will ·be made in. response to the demand, and the idea 1 ai:rangement would be ·to· assib>'Il one or more parties ea.ch year t.Oithis dass:of work. Two vessels .commenced work on this project during the latter part of the fiscal year, which work will be continued during the next fiscal year. . .. · · Exploratory or unsurveyed area, 120,465 square miles. Oi this area there are 40,000 square miles of immediate importance to navigation. This includes the stretch of coast from Prince William Sound to Unalaska Island. The party should be prepared to undertake all dasses of surveys. The type of organization would be that of the Surveyor in 1920. ALAsKA, BERING SEA, AND ARCTIC OcEAN.-Area unsurveyed, 427,345 square miles. Most of this area is of such a distance from land that .its survey is of no present .navigational importance.. The stretch.of coast, on the north side of the Alaskan ·Peninsula and extending from Unalaska,Island to,i;he,mouth of.the Kuskokwim River promises to be of increasing commercial importance due to the large -!ishing industries and t~e .possibility of the discov~ry of gold-bearmg sands, the character1st1cs of the shores of the l\.uskokwim being si~ilar ~o those. found at Nome. No work was accomplished on this. pro)ect durmg the present fiscal year nor is any contemplated durmg the next year. HAWAIIAN lsLANDs.-The unsurveyed area is 10,280 square miles. Most of this area is deep water, which could be done by a steamer of the Disooverer and Pioneer type. The hydrography of the bays and close alongshore, as well as the topography, would be done by a detached party from .the steamer living ashore and assigned a launch. This work is much needed, but owing to lack of approp~·iations it has been impo.ssible to do any work on this project during the fiscal year, nor is any contemplated during the next. In the present and previous annual reports there are printed diagrams of the condition of field operations. These diagrams are intended to show in a graphic manner where our sun-eys are at present adequate, or where surveys are needed, and the type of survey required t? m!11re our charts up to date and thoroughly reliable for safe ·navigation. ; .

The thoroughfares affording an ~xit ~o the Bay of F~ndy from·.,,Passamaquoddy Bay and St. Croix: River have been wire dragged;1a}eo an area i5 miles in length between Machias Seal Islands and Petit Manan Island. There is still remaining a large area as yet un~ touched by the wire drag. There are a number of towns along this course that depend on water-borne traffic for shipping out their produce and receiving their supplies. The commerce· consists of lumber, fish, fuel, and miscellaneous merchandise, constituting the supply of the smal1er and larger fashionable resorts, of which the largest is Bar Harbor, Me. The exceptionally rocky !c'o'ast .m4'.kes it certain that a wire-drag survey will result in the discovery ol many rocks that now endanger the safety of commerce over this course.

until the area has been dragged. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 70.) 5. PENOBSCOT BAY.-ln Penobscot Bay every port has benefited by the practical completeness of the wire-drag work. There are, however, some of the less important sections to be dragged, and some of the approaches from the eastward are not yet completed. The wire drag, as used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was developed in this region, and some of the area was not dragged to the depth now believed necessary. The size of vessels has mcreased rapidly, and additional work is necessary to protect this increased draft. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 70.) As it has required time to solve all the problems involved in dragging to this greater depth, it is probable that much of the deeper part of Penobscot Bay which was covered during the development of the wire-drag apparatus will later have to be dragged to a greater depth. 6. PENOBSCOT BAY TO CAsco BAY (DEEP DRAFT).-The coast of New England throughout its length presents practically one uniform problem to the hydrographic engineer. Surveys of varying degrees of completeness have been made of the entire area, and it is possible for navigators to select channels which are apparently safe. They would be of ample depth if it were not for the ice-worn granite rock or the large bowlders deposited during the glacial period. The lead line is not adapted to find without assistance dangers of this character. This thoroughfare presents uneven and rocky bottom between Monhegan Island and the eastern entrance to Casco Bay1 which should be dragged to remove all doubt of the existence ot .pinnacle ·rocks .or smu.11 led.ges. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 70.) 7~ PENoBsoOT BAY Tci C.1tsoo BAY (MODERATE DuAFT).-From the western entrance of Penobscot Bay to Casco Bay there has been no ~ire-drag work d?n~. The. inside ~oute is ?on.stantly used by coastmg steamers, but it is certam that it has withm its limits many uncharted rocks, some known locally and some unknown. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 72.) · 8. BooTHBAY HARBOu.-This forms the approach to the town of Boothbay Harbor and numerous smaller summer resorts. It is frequented by many vessels and by a large number of fishing boats and pleasure craft in summer. It is one of the best anchorages on the c()ast of Maine, and is much used as a harbor of refuge by all classes of vessels. This area is in urgent need of a wire-drag survey. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 72.) . . 9. KENNEBEC RrVER.-lt is the approach to the cities of Bath and Augusta, the towns of "'Woolworth, Richmond, and Gardiner, and numerous smaller villages and summer resorts. The river has considerable water-borne commerce, the deepest draft being about 21 feet to Bath and 14 to Augp.sta. There is urgent need for a wire· drag survey of the river. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 72.) . 10. CASCO BAY.-Casco Bay and the approaches to Portland have been dragged, with the result of finding numerous uncharted shoals, thereby furnishing important evidence of the need of carrying the survey to the eastward and westward to a junction with completed work. A resurvey of inner Casco Bay is badly needed, the glaciers havi~g left a serie~ of. long, narrow, and dangerous ledges, which reqmr0~closer exa1!1mat1on. (See fig. 6, opposite. p. 72;)

11. Po:RTLAND HARBOR AND ArrnoAcnJ<:s.-These have been dragged·, and all dangers to navigation are shown on the charts. (See fig.,,6, opposite.) 12. PonTI,AND TO PoRTS:l\IOUTI:I (MonERATE DnAF'.r).-'\Vestward of Portland the succession of sand beaches, of which Old Orchard is the best known, might appear to indicate an absence of rocks in this region. The depth of sand above the underlying rock is not great, however, and pinnacle rocks occur outside these beaches. There is a gap in the wire-drag surveys between Cape Porpoise and Cape Elizabeth which must be completed to make this portiori·.safe. A party was in the field at the end of the fiscal year, and work on this project was started early in June. (See fig. 6, opposite.) : .,. 13. PonTLA::-<D TO CAPE ANN (Dirnr Du.AFT) .-The region from Boon Island to Isle of Shoals is very rocky, and its importance as the approach to Portsmouth is well recognized. The area has been covered by the wire drug, which miw forms a continuously dragged ::rea from Cape Porpoise to within 10 miles of Cape Ann. (See fig. 6, opposite.) · · 14. Poin'SMOU'l'II HAnBoR.-This area hus been dragged, and all dangers to navigation are known. (See fig. 6~ opposite;) , ·: ., 15. MASSACHUSETTS CoAST NoRTH oF CAI'E ANN.-From the New Hampshire border to Cape Ann the shor<'S arc entirely different from those to the north or ~outh. There are high sand bluffs in places and low sandy shores i11 others. As a result the depths along the shore are changeable and thouglr they have been ·recently_ surveyed they will need further attention. (See fig. G, opposite.) · · · 16. c,~l'I·~ ANN TO CAI'E Con CANAL.-A completely dragged area extends from Cape Ann to Cape Cod Canal and from the head of Buzzards Bay to Sakonnet Point, R. I. With the exception of the areas near the shores of Buzzards Bay this important survey is complete. This work was made especially necessary by the opening of the Cape Cod Canal in 1915, the original surveys having been made while the commerce of the region was relatively unimportant. A number of shoals were found of less than the proposed canal depth. It was important not only to find those shoals of less than the proposed canal depth but also those which might become a menace at some future date in case it should be necessary to deepen this canal to take care of the largest vessels. With this view the drag was carried at a sufficient depth to meet such requirements. Even should a depth of 40 feet be adopted for the canal the present surveys of the approaches will be found adequate, and where less depths have been found the information will be invaluable to the engineers making the improvement. (See fig. 6, opposite.) : ·17. FROM BosTON SoUTH OUTSIDE CAPE Coo.-Much of the traffic between eastern New England and points west and south passes outside of Cape Cod; most of it through Nantucket and Vineyard Sounds. Off Cape Cod the surveys are not complete. In Nantucket Sound the entire.route is through channels bounded by shifting san~ and requires frequent revision work. In one part of the channel most use.d-through Pollock Rip Slue-a shoal· was formed in the last few years that has been steadily narrowing and decreasing the depth of the channel. A resurvey of part of this route is needed everv few years to insure safety to navigation. No roqks occur east,vard

At present vessels must pass over 10 miles of undragged area in f?llowing the best channel through Vineyard Sound. (See D.g. 7, opposite p. 74.) · :il8·.: FuoM CAPE CoD CANALTmwuaH BuzzAUDS BAY.-This rpute has been dragged to the eastern limit of Long Island Sound. (See fig. 7, opposite p. 74.) 19. NAURAGANSETI' BAY.-This area has been drugged, with the exception of the thoroughfare leading through Mount Hope Bay to Fall River and the small stretch to the north and east of Prudence Island. (See fig. 7, opposite p. 74.) 20. ENTRANCE 1'0 NARRAGANSETT BAY, BLOCR ISLAND SOUND, FISHERS lsr..AND SouND, AND ·THE EASTEUN PART OF LoNa Isl.AND SouNo.-These !treus ~re practically completed, with the exception of the central and western parts of Long Island Sound, which remain to be dragged. (See fig. 7, Qpposite p. 74.) 21. GULF m· l\1ArnE.-The portion of the Gulf of Maine of which the bureau makes surveys may be considered as lying to the westward of meridian 67° O' and extending to Nantucket Shoals. This entire area. has been inadequately surveyed, as it wus accomplished at an early date when both the appliances and the methods were far inforior to those of the present day. Not only are the soundings obtained. insufficient, but many of them are not located correctly on the . charts. A good example of this is the discovery several years ago that only one shoal rock exists on Cashe Ledge, where two were ()hfWteq, ll;nd. that Sigsbee and Ammen Rocks, formerly shown 4 miles a:pa'rt,.,fl.re·: realJ.y,.t}i~. -aa;me --rock; .. These, de:fects in ·the charts are serious for two, reasons: ·The .trans~Atlantic steamers approaching the ports of northern New England, especially Portland and Boston are unable to depend on the charts of the gulf sufficiently to loca~ themselves accurately by sounding. This is particularly serious ciuring the fogs of summer, which often extend far out to sea an<t' . last for days, and the winter snowstorms. In addition to this the fisheries of the .Gulf of Maine are an important national asset. Not only are many 1mportant fishing banks uncharted, but the limit and depths of known bunks are not correctly given. Besides, there is not at present enough information availuble as to the chai:acter of the bottom. The knowledge of rocky bottom may lead to the discovery Of, good fishing·grounds. (See fig. 8, opposite p. 74.) . 22.· NANTUCKET SnoALS TO GEOitaES BANRs.-Extending eastward from N ~ntucket Sound there is an immense shoal area, consisting of ' sandy ridges which are shifted by the waves and currents. Nantucket Shoals extend about 50 miles offshore; then there is a deep channel followed by ridges. It is readily seen that it is important to keep the channel 1mrveyed and to examine the adjacent shoals to detect changes; but it might readily be asked, What is the use of surveying sucl.1 areas as Nantucket Shoals, which vessels are most careful to avoid 1 First, it is necessary to be certain that the outer l4nits of these shoals are clearly defined in order that they may be avoided; second, the shoals are important fishing grounds; third, mo~e careful surveys may develop safe channels for coastwise navigat10n,.· channels which are already indicated on the charts but are

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SUB.VEY;

un:safe to use because of inadequate surveys. Due to the constant changes the existing surveys are nowhere adequate. The shoals are so numerous and the channels so intricate that a difficult problem is presented in their examination by accurate methods. . The gromid fishing, which has in recent yea.rs assumed large proportions/is steadily moving· seaward. During the winter N a.ntucket Island is the headquarters of this industry. Not only do the present charts la.ck the needed information in the search for new ground, but the absence from the charts of existing shoals is a source of danger to the boa.ts running to and from the harbor. Breakers often· occur where there is ample depth for boats when the water is smooth. This is an excellent example of how a. region usually avoided by commerce may be of importance to an industry which furnishes part· iof the food' supply of the Nation. (See fig. 8, opposite.) ·' f',! · 23. TRANS-ATLANTIC APPROACH To NEW YoRK.__;.There is scarcely any part of our coast where correct soundings are of more importance than i'.!1 the approach to New York from the eastward, as all trans-Atlantic ·steamers bound to that port pass over this a!ea. Many of them ha':e to dei;>end <?n sound~ngs f?r: safety. A fairly good survey -0f this area is available, but additional· work should be done by modern methods in the portion out of sight· of land, so that the needs of the enormous traffic will be met. (See fig. 9, opposite.) . . . 24. FnoM PoINT JuniTH TO NEw YoRK.-It is almost unnecessarv to go into particulai;s, except to make. it 'Cl~lllr'''tha.t.ithe ,central and western parts o·f Long "Island,'Sound· rema:m to be' dra.:gged~"· 'l'his · work will be undertaken: at· ·'the earliest opportunity. At present New York Harbor has but one exit to the sea for deep-draft vessel&-1-by way of the Lower Bay and through Ambrose Channel over Sandy. Hook Bar. The other exit-through Long Island Sound and· Block Island Sound-is obstructed by ledges at Hell Gate, in the East River. The'project to remove these and secure a depth 0£ 40 feet .-js now in progress. Before it is completed channels of this depth in the Sound should be examined with the drag to inake certain they are safe. This would aiso apply to Jf ort Pond and approaches,d.f·the proposed trans-Atlantic termmal 1s located at·;that«tpla:ce.::· The proJect to deepen East River to· 40 feet makes: ittnecessnry to be certain where the channels with such depths a.re located in Long Island Sound. The work done in Block Island Sound has defined the limit of such depths in the eastern approach to Long Island Sound, and it is urgent that the entire area should be completed without delay.. The approaches to all the harbors on Long Island Sound should M dragged. The shoaler bays are used extensively by motor boats;iand the number in operation for a given area is probably greater:. than anywhere else in the United States. (See fi~. 9, opposite.) ' i .. 25. HunsoN RIVER.-The Hudson River 1s a valuable,!:Waterway between New York and Albany and is a part of the canal system of the State. A few years a.go a dangerous rock was. found direct'l.y on the path of steamers between New York and Albany. With 'such a possibility all t~e doubtful parts of the Hudson·, should be dragged.

REPORT OF DIBEOTOR, OOAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

27. CoABT oF NEW JERSEY.-Along the most of the coast of New Jersey the character of the bottom is such that the exact existing depths should be ascertained beyond all doubt, particularly as shoals dangerous to coastwise traffic have been reported from time to time. The only i;eliabl.e surveys along this stretch of coast have been made in connection with searches for these reported shoals. Eastwarcl of Cape ·May there are shoals that need a resurvey. A survey of this area in the vicinity of Cape Henlopen was made in 1920. The sounding lines were carried out to sea as far as the 100-fathom curve. (See fig. 9, opposite p. 74.) 28. DELAWARE BAY.-Delaware Bay has as its most marked characteristic a series of narrow, fairly deep channels separated by long, narrow shoals. These shoals are subJect to change. A survey is needed now, and one should be made about every 10 years in the entranbe and ·11.t 'longer intervals iri the up;per bay. While dredged channels are maintained for most of the distance from.the entrance of the bay to Philadelphia, vessels of moderate draft use the other channels. In view of the importance of the cities at the head of the bay and on the river, it is highly important that the needed survey of Delaware Bay be made so that a chart of the proper standard may be issued. (See fig. 10, opposite_p. 76.) 29. DELAWARE BAY ENTRANCE TO CHESAPEAKE BAY.-From Delaware Bay entrance to Chesapeake Bay there is a succession of shoals and banks. Many of these are buoyed so that moderate-draft vessels may pass inside of them. In certain regions it is of the highest importance that the survey should be correct r..nd kept up to da~. At onlY. o~e ~l~ ha.a a c9mprehensive survey been made, and this was the mvestigatidn 'of ·a; repe!>:efi:Eld'.shoal. . '.', " · ·· · 30. CHESAPEAKE' BAY A'm> Tru:nt7TA.RJEs.-These have been extensively surveyed in recent years, and a large number of tributaries will not require resurveys for many years. This is also true of the Potomac River. The parts which need resurveying are parts of the bay :fro~ Cape Charles to a point opposite Annapolis, parts of the Jam~s River, and the Rappahannock and Susquehanna Rivers. The entrance has been recently surveyed, but another survey will probably- be needed in 10 years. Owing to the shifting sandy bottom the bay is greatly in need of examination at critical localities where depths are near the draft of vessels, frequent reports indicating the'presence of new shoals. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 76.) 31. CHESAPEAKE BAY ENTRANCE TO CAPE HATTERAs.-The diagram shows the tracks :for both the light-draft and deep-draft vessels. A party worked just south of the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, where shoals had been reported, during the first part o:f the fiscal year. 32. ALBEM~RLE SouNn.-Albemarle Sound and its tributaries, with a f~w exceptions, have been resurveyed within the last few years and will not reguire resurveying for a long time. The uncompleted portions, including the North and Alligator Rivers, should be finished in the near future, as they form part of the projoot for a. through 12-foot channel of the inside waterway route .. The Chowan Rfiiyer; which is the western extension of this sound, should also be mshed, and then the surveys of this region would be in a most satisfactory up-to-date condition. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 76.)

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

33. CROATAN SouNn.-Croatan Sound, connecting link between Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds, has recently been resurv:eyed, but the depth is so near to the draft of the vessels using it that the surveys will have to be revised from time to time. Changes in the roam c?-annel have occurred within the last two years. (See fig. 10, oppoSite.) 34. PAMLICO SouNn.-Pamlico Sound has· additional, importanco owing to its relation to the inland waterway route. The eastern half of· the sound is well surveyed, but the entire western half and the Neuse River, in addition to its local use as part of the through 12foot channel, has not been completed. The survey was in progress up to October, 1920, when it had to be discontinued owing to .the steamer proving unsuitable and too expensive to operate. (See fig. 10, oprosite.) 35. DIAMOND SHOALs.-Diamond Shoals, off Hatteras, should be resurveyed chiefly to to determine changes in their extent and particularg to obtain a knowledge of the correct depths on the seaward side. See fio-. 10, opposite.) 36. APE ffiTTERAs TO WINY.AH BAY, S. C.-Nearly the whole of this area is in need of a new survey, as those areas now charted .are . not in sufficient detail for modern navigation. Next to Diamond Shoals in importance to coastwise navigation arc the shoals extending seaward from Cape Lookout and Cape Fear. They are subject to change and should be examined at short intervals. (See fig. 11, opposite.) . . , .. . . 37. WrNYAH BAY TO FEHNANDINA, FLA.-This region has been· recently surveyed, the work extending out to the 100-fathom cmve. The topography of the immediate coast line has also been revised, the work extending from Bull Bay south "to Savannah. The results show many changes of importance to small craft. 38. FERNANDINA· TO THE FLOIUDA REEFs.-From Fernandina to the Florida Reefs the area of moderate depths continually narrows, until at Palm Beach the distance to the 100-fathom curve is very small. The completed survey referred to in paragraph 37 extends southward to a little below St. Augustine. ·South of St. Augustine· the bottom is proba~ly not subject to change except .as noted below~ and the surveys, wlule by no means complete, are fair. O!f Cape \Jana·· veral and outside the southern half of the Indian River there are extensive banks and ridges in urgent need of resurvey. Known depths of 11 to 16 feet a long way offshore show the need of further surveys to make certain that all the shoals are correctly charted. From Jupiter Inlet to Fowey Rocks, where the Florida Reefs begin, the deep water approaches so close to the shore that it will be a s~ight task to complete mshore work in connection with the offshore surveys. (See fig. 11, opposite.) . · 39. GENERAi,, ATLANTIC, AND Gurx CoAsTs.-An explanatrnn. of the method used in verifying the location of a vessel by soundmg when objects on shore are obscured by distance or thick weather will show why accurate charts are particularly needed from New York to Palm Beach and from Key West to the Mexican border~ At fixed intervals the vessel takes soundings, which are plotted to the scale of the chart on tracing paper, and this is moyed over the chart, keeping the line joining the soundings parallel to the course of the vessel until the soundings agree with those shown on the chart.

the charts are correct and based on a sufficiently modern survey, the method is one of the best known for verifying the ship's positio~. If on the other band, the soundings are few and far apart, so that th~ ship's soundings fall between them, and if those on the chart are wrongly placed, this method becomes much more difficult, and an accidenta;J.: agreement may lead the vessel into danger: . !-:From New York to Cape Hatteras the charts, while fairly good, are by no means good enough to meet the full needs of navigation, but the work required to bring them up to date has been postponed, as the need for resurveys has been more urgent farther south. Up to a few years ago the offshore ~urveys fron:i Cape H;atteras. ~o tl~e FJorida Reefs were almost unbelievably deficient. This condition is being remedied as rapidly as possible, and between Winyah Bay, S. C. and St. Augustine, Fla.; the offshore work out to the Gulf StreJm is<complete. It is important that this work be extended both north and south from its present limit as rapidly as possible. With adequate funds full advantage can be tak.en of th~ season, and by working north in the summer and south m the wmter the cost of the work will be greatly rerluced. (See fig. 11, opposite.) 40. INDIAN RrvER.-There have been no recent surveys of these waters. Revisionary work is needed. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 78.) · 41. BISCAYNE BAY.-Hecent surveys have been made of this area out to the 100-fathom curve in the vicinity o~ Miami and as :far south as Fowey Rocks. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 78.) 42. VICINITY OF FowEY RocKs LIGHT.-No recent surveys have been made. The present surveys are not sufficient in detail. .. 43. ,COAST OF FLomoA 1''ROM PALM BEACH AuouND TO CEDAU KEYs.-For· a:distance along .the shore of· 567nniles from Palm· Beach rnuthward around to Cedar Kcws on the west coast of Florida coral reefs.are found, in some places 1i1orc abundant than in others. Coral reefs, whether the result of disintegration or of a building up by 1mimal growth, are found in a great variety of forms and in vast numbers of shar,p.projeotions from· the general bottom, where conditions :a;rei favorable for the growth of coral. While we are informed that an enormous number of uncharted rocks exist in this region, due to the fact that they are so numerous and that the region is so large, an effort has been made to first drag areas of the coast used by commercial and naval vessels because of both the time and cost mvolved. Wire-drag work jg accordingly undertaken in localities wJ:iere ~here are commerce and naval operations. 1'o accomplish even tlus wil~ require years of work. '\Vestward-bound vessels through the Florida Straits have to force their way against the strong current of the Gulf. Stream, which in places attains a velocity of 5 miles an hour. Alo~g the northerly edge of the stream and close to the reefs the current JS very weak. There is a strong temptation to keep dangerously close to the reefs and save fuel, and this is the cause of frequent ~ccidents: Besides the danger of running into the known reefs, wluch a1:e m many places bare and are of no great depth throughout thell" length, another danger, the extent of which is not yet;known, has been discovered in a secondary reef parallel to the ~am reef and about one-half mile outside of it. This secondary reef IS found.to.approach the surface in places as a narrow ridge with dept~s as little as 25 .feet. Twenty-five miles of this reef have been exanuned, but 200· miles remain to be examined. It is important to

REPORT O:F DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.-

nearly al.I the great traffic entering .the Gul~ of Mexico that this exammatwn be completed at the earliest possible moment. During 1920 a vessel was employed on surveys of the Florida reefs between the Marquesas Keys and Fowey Rocks. This includes supplemeii· tary. su.rveys of th~ channels through the reefs from deep water into the mside route lymg between the reefs and the mainland; also the close development of the shoal area westward of· Key West and southward of the Marquesas Keys. In connection with this the work has been carried out to the 100-fathom curve for a distance of 50 m:Ies along the reefs. (See fig. 12, opposite.) · 44. VESSEL CounsI<;s NoRTH FROM KEY WEsT.-Vessels bound for eastern Gulf ports naturally wish to take the shortest route. If ·of light draft, they can cross the Florida Reefs at Key West. The next channel is between Rebecca Shoal and Dry Tortugas, and if this is not used vessels must pass well to the westward of Dry Tortugas to avoid a shoal bank west of it. The Rebecca Shoal channel has been dragged and has ample 'depth of water. The bank west of Tortugas should be dragged, especially as vessels making land from the westward have to cross part of it. Northward of the keys from Key West to Tortugas a doubtful area should be 'dragged. . The necessity of this is emphasized by the fact that the U. S. S. ElUs, while steaming northward of the Marquesas Keys, struck a coral head which proved to have only 7 feet over it. This coral head was directly out of a depth of 35 feet, with no indication of its existence until struck by the naval vessel, which was severely do.maged. The channel between the keys and the reef, known.as the Hawk Channel§ is important for moderate-draft vessels. It will be necessary to drag the axis of the channel to insure against dangers to the vessels making use of it. 45. CAPE RoMANo.-This area is in need of surveys. An inspection o:f the existing maps and charts of the State of Florida shows practically a blank area for that part of the peninsula south of Lake Okechobee. There are but few areas of the United States of like size about which so little definite information can be obtained. Northward of this unknown region drainage canals are opening up the country for development. It is not unlikely the same means: will be extended southward. At the present time the burea? sho.uld prepare to meet a demand in the near future for the delmeat10n of a. broader belt of country back of the shore from qape Sable to Punta Rosa than is now shown on our charts. Tounsts and land prospectors are now exploring this intricate system of islands and water· ways. (See fig. 12 opposite.) .1 46. CHARLOTTE H'ARBon.-No recent surveys have been made of tbiS area, and it should be resurveyed. (See fig. 12, opp-0site.) 47. TAHPA BAY AND APPROACH.-The existing surveys at present meet the needs of navigation of these waters.· (See fig .. 12~ opposite.) . 48. CEDAR KEYs.-No recent surveys have been made of this region. Wire-drag surveys are badly needed. (See fig. 12 opposite.) . 49. AJ,'ALACHEE BAY.-No recent surveys have been ~ade of this region and revision work is needed. (See fig. 12, opposite.). . 50. INSHORE WATERS, GuLF CoAsT.-The chief characteristics of the west coast of Florida are the distances to which shoal water extends offshore between . Cape Sable and Cape Romano and from

Tampa Bay to Appalachicola and the existence of a large number of bays connected.with the sea by deep channels, either natural or dredged. From Apalachee Bay to Cupe San Blas the coast begins to assume a character more like the South Atlantic coast, and cor~l bottom is noJonger found. This stretch of coast is sandy, and sand, 'shoals extend off some distance, especially in the vicinity of Cape San Blas..o:This region needs a resurvey and, like other sandy portions of ~he coast, will need l"esurveying from time to time. The li'lorida and Alabama coasts differ somewhat, as deep water approaches close ta the shore in the latter. 'l'he coast of Miss1ssippi and Louisiana has a very large proportion of changeable area and resurveys are need~ now and will be needed from time to time in the area from Mobile Bay to the end of the offshore shoals of Vennilion Bay. The immense load of sediment carried by the Mississippi River, especially in time of flood, ca.uses constant changes in the delta. The deposit of·. sediment and the action of the waves on the deposits re.suit in rapid growth in some places and of erosion in others. Sixty miles. west of the Mississippi Delta the!e begins a~ extensive shoal region which:is·in need of· survey. The mshore region along the rest of the· Louisiana coast and the Texas coast, with an important exception,. has deep water fairly close to the shore. The exception is along the· eastern part of the Texas coast from Sabine Pass to Galveston .. Sabine Bank and Heald Bank have shoal depths at a considerable distance from the shore, and they should have a thorough resurvey. Galveston Bay also needs resurveying. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 78.)

Along the north:ern<edge,·of·:the<F.lorida.'StraitS the soundingB are insufficient, and they will have to be carried out somewhat beyond the 100-fathom curve. Along the west coast of Florida the distance out to the 100-fathom curve is about 100 miles. Over much of this 11.rea the depths arc moderate, and the charts arc based on reconnaissance surveys only. The bottom is coral rock in many places, and projections from coral banks may come sufficiently near the surface to be a me!1ace to navi~ation. Fishermen have reported !eYeral uncharted r1d~es, and while the somewhat incomplete surveys of the reported localities huYe not confirmed all the details of their reports,. ~portant differences from the chart~d depths have bee!! !o1:1nd~ !!f'lie 100-fathom curve approaches fairly close to the M1ss1ss1ppi Delta, then swings offshore again, so that it is about 60 miles south of. Sab~ne ~a~s. It then swings to the southward. in a curve, which brmgs it w1thm about 80 miles offshore ut the l\.fox1can border. This whole offshore area is badly in nood of a thorough resurvey. There· is no other part of the work in offshore wnters so likely to be productive in furnishing important changes in existing charted depths .. (See fig. 13, oppoente p. 78.) 53.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND QEODETIC SURVEY.

56. LAKE PoNTCHARTRAIN.-In connection with the surveys in Mobile Bay and Mississippi Sound a recent survey ha,s been· made at the eastern end of the lake. The greater part of the lake has ·'llOt been examined for 20 years. (See fig. 13, opposite p. 78.) .. 57. APPROACHES To Miss1ss1rrr PAssEs.-The hydrography of this area from close inshore to the 100-fathom curve has been completed. The offshore work· which has been in progress from Pensacola entrance westward has been extended to Mississippi River Passes. 58. VEnMrLION BAY AND CoTE BLANCHE.-No recent surveys have heen made of these areas. Surveys are needed. (See fig. 14, opposite.) 59. ArrnoAcH TO SABINE PAss.-A resurvey of this area .was completed during the fiscal year. (See fig. 15, opposite.) ., 60. PonTo Rrco.-The surveys of Porto Rico were begun when,the island came under the jurisdiction of the United States as a result of the Spanish-American War. By 1910 the surveys of the bays, chann~ls, and inshore were completed, and a number of deep-sea soundmgs were taken around the island. There are, however, extending to the eastward and westward of the island and along the south coast extensive areas where the bottom is of coral formation. There are also reefs along the north coast, but as they are close to shore and must be avoided by vessels it is only important to know their location and limits. The areas on the east, south, and west are different, in that there is traffic between the reef and over areas where the depth is little greater than the draft of the vessel, Q.Ad the probable existence of uncharted projections is .a.source 0£ danger. A vessel was engt\ged during .the entire irear in completing the draggmg of the waters of Vieques Sound and its approaches. This work has resulted in finding many coral rocks, the existence of which was not discovered by the hydrographic survey of previous years. (See fig. 15, opposite.) 61. VrnGIN IsLANDs.-The Virgin Islands were purchased :from Denmark, and the United States took possession in 1917. The sur~ veys that have been made are by the British and Danish Governments. It is certain that t.he coral formation in the waters touching these islands requires extensive wire-drag surveys before accurate charts can be issued. Topographic surveys of these islands were requested by the Navy Department. The triangulation we.s., ell-: tended eastward from Porto Rico for the control of the topography. St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix ha,ve been completed. Hydro~ graphic w9rk will be taken up there durmg the next fiscal year. All harbors will be thoroughly sounded out, and the shallow coastal waters. will be dragged. G2. PANAMA CA:.S-,\L.-The Atlantic approach to the Panama Canal hns hel'n s11rvcvcd since work started on the canal construction. Limon Bay is, 'however, a region where pinnacle rocks occur. ·~11 the anchorages should be drngged, and the work should be clirried a short dista.nce outi,;ide. The Pacific approach to the canal )las had ·1 :recent survev and has been dragged. (See fig. 16, opposite·) · 63. PACil'IC° CoAf!l'r OF ·ruE UNITED STATEs.-The western coast 0£ the United States is very different from the eastern. Generally mountainous, with comparatively few harbors or inside .waterways and with comparntivcly dec>p water close to the shore, lt pres~nts littlP resemblance to the low shores and wide continental shelf of the

Atlantic. The purpose 0£ the survey is, then, to meet the needs 0£ vessels approachin&" from seaward and coasting vessels, which keep to a few comparatively nar1;ow tracks, to insure up-to-date charts of the various harbors, to make soundings offshore, and to develop fishing banks th~t are k!lown to exist. The weather i~ an important £actor in increasmg the importance 0£ the charts 0£ this coast. From Los Angeles Harbor northward fog is very common in the summer time, and in the winter gales, accompanied by thick weather, are 0£ frequent occurrence. On the coast and in the vicinity of San Francisco thick weather is prevalent for perhaps 25 per cent of the time. Under such conditions the navigator must rely entirely upon his chart, and it is essential that detail surveys be made to the 100fathom curve, which is beyond the limit 0£ soundii:igs t:iken by merchant vessels. · Along the shore of southern Cahforma much work was done up to 1895, and some of the surveys then made may be accepted as ~inal. In the vicinity of the outer islands surveys extended only a httle way from the shore, and the deep waters between and outside of them are unsurveyed. The few soundings taken show irregular. bottom, and breakers have been reported in places where the chart shows 600 fathoms. These waters, therefore, should be 8Urveyed out to the 1,000-fathom depth. The Oregon coast is practically unsurveycd. A limited amount of work was done. years ago south of Cape Blanco and in the vicinity of the Columbia River, but this was not more than a reconnaissanc'e and does not extend out far enough to be of practical value to navigators. Elsewhere no surveys have ever been undertaken until recently. Even in such an important locality as C!!:pe ~~a~c?.,;.,. zvh,ich _m~s~ be round.ed by all vessels plying ~etween the· Columbia· .uiver and· -San Francisco, there are no soundrngs to scn·e as a guide "i_n thick weather, and vessels have b~en lost wholly on account of tlns lack of surveys. On the coast of Oregon there are eight important harbors on which the Government and private interests have expended approximate!Y $40,250,000 in improvements designed . to £acUitate navigation. One of these is the Columbia .~iver., 'the"gate;va;v to one of th~ rno~t importa~t transportation centers o~ the I ac1fic coast. ):'"ct, rn s_p1te of the immense expenditures for improvements, there is not a srngle one of these harbors the approaches to which have been adequately surveyed. The approaches to the Columbin. River have been sounded for n short distance offshore, but even in this area the· soundings nre too far apart to more than indicate in a general way the depth which may be ~xpected. This partial survey extends southward along the coast to mclud~ ~he approaches to two other harbors. The approaches to the remaming· five, on which $3,826,000 have been expended in improvem~nts, are. entirely unsurveyed. The entire "\Vashington coast stands 11.1 urgent need of a first .survey, <1xcept in the approach to the Straits of Juan de Fuca and m the straits themselves where the present work is adequate. (See fig. 17, opposite p. 80.) ' 64:. Los ANGELEs H.Annon.-A revision survey of Los Angeles Harbor and approach was recently completed. '. 65. SAN FRANCISCO BAY.-San Francisco Bay is of varied charucte~ of bottom and needed surveys vary to corresi;>ond. The immediate appronches are complete except in the vicmity of Farullones. Here additional sounding is needed, and an investigation

there should be made with the wire. drag to verify the existe:q.~. of other rocks than those cha.rted. Wire-drag work has been carried through the Golden Gate and inside, both northw.ard and southward of San Francisco to the limit of the rocky area. The resurvey .of the bar outside the Golden Gate has been completed. A resurvey of San Pablo Bay has been made. 66. ALONGSHORE WATERS OF ?-'HE PACIFIC CoAs;r STATEs.-From the western end of the Santa Barbara Channel to Monterey Bay the surveys, as a rule, extend only to the 50-fathom curve, which lies but a short distance offshore. The surveys should be extended seaward t<? include the usual track of coastwise vessels, which lietqm average distan:ce of about 19 miles from shore. From S:in F_rari~isco Bay to ~omt Arena a widely spaced system of soundmg. l~nes h~,)?een carried out to the 100-fathom curve. Here an additional amoQ.D.t of work, about equal to that already accomplished, is necessary before the survey can be considered complete. Between Point Arena and Cape Mendocino the surveys extend a uniform distance of 6 miles from shore, reaching depths varying from 50 to 600 :fathoms. Additional detailed surveys should be made in the vicinity or Point .Arena and from there to. the completed work south of Cape Mendocino. Detaile4 surveys are badly needed in ,the ;vicinity .of Cape Blanco, nind this work should be extended to Cape Flil.ttecy~ joining the northern limits of the work completed in the vicinity of Cape Mendocino. The offshore surveys which have been· in p,rogress durina recent years in the vicinity o~ C~pe Me~docinC?:have.l:>e~n,~o:i:n,,P}e~e:f. ,This work extends from close mshore to the 1,000-£athom curve. ·.. . . The necessity for such surveys is shown by the location of the hitherto uncharted submarine valley north of Cape Mendocino, which was a factor in causing the wreck of the steamer Bear. A vessel was engaged during the fiscal year in making a survey of the 'Yater area in the vicinity of Cape Blanco, Oreg. This work is to extend both north and south of Cape Blanco from close inshore to the 1,000-fathom curve. There are no adequate surveys of ~h~ inshore area along the State of Oregon. Of the water off the northern part of the Pacific coast little is known, except that. the Bureau of Fisheries, acting on the information obtained fropl: ~h,.~rµi.~1 has located certain banks. These banks should be s~eyeCf tp aetermine th~ir depth and extent, and it is beli~ved that. a gene~al survey carried out to the 1,000-fathom curve will result rn the discovery of other banks of great value. (See fig. 17, opposite p. 80.) 67. INTERIOR w ATERS OF THE STATE OF w ASHINGTON.-The interior waters of th~ State of Washington represent the point of chan~e · from .a practically strait coast line to the broken formation of t?-e coast of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. There . are many channels of importance leading ~o Se11:ttle, Ta?o~a, Ev;~rett, Bellingham, and Olympia and connectmg with the ms1de pa,ssage to southeastern Alaska. All these should be dragged wherev~r tl~ere . is the slightest doubt as to the presence of dangers to n1;1-,v1gat10n. ,. (See fig. 20, opposite.) 68. STEAMER RouTEs, SouTIIEASTERN ALA.sn:A.-!n sout~1eastern Alaska the first and most obvious need is to complete the wire-drag work. Most of these waters have been sounded, so that only dragging is necessary to complete the survey. This drag work should be

taken up in the order of its importance, beginning with the main steamer route throug~ the region and then t~kin~ up the various tributary ·waters ·leadmg to areas of commercial importance. For some years past parties have been actively engaged in dragging the main steamer routes, and this work is now about 95 per cent complete. "' At ·the end o:f the fiscal year a party was engaged in wire-drag operations in Cross Sound and Icy Straits. 69. THE OUTSIDE CoAST w ATERS OF THE ISLANDS BORDERING ON THE OPEN i>.Ac1F1c.-These and their connecting channels are largely uneurveyed and should be navigated with great caution. A navigator seeing the chart on which the shore line is sketched-no soundings, several rocks and shoal banks, notes as to rocks and breakers reported, and a statement on the chart to the effect that the area is unsurveyedi~, to. say the least, unable to proceed with co?fidence, and this si~ua'ti9n ;tB'~:r.-:.no-:niell.J;lS unusual. The same pressmg need of such regions is a conip1ete·'hydrogriiplrle"EillirVey followed later in places by wiredrag work. The rapidly increasing commercial importance of this .regio~. and ..the exceptionally dangerous charac~r of the waters through which traffic must pass render surveys m the near futUre imperative. ·work on the outer coast is now in progress northward from Dixon Entrance. (See fig. 21, opposite p. 84.) · "'70. CRoss SouND TO PRINCE WILLIAM SouND.-From Cross Sound, the northernmost channel from the inside waters to the sea, to Prince William Sound the coast has few features of present or prospective importance; There is, however, urgent need for surveys tcHnsurethe safety of vessels approachi_ng ~nd passing the coast.·- ~n this re~ion ·the: oha1"s·are· very~defeQti"Ve··m the .manner of showmg soundmgs and prominent coastal mountain peaks and headlands that would enable the navigator to obtain his position on approaching from seaward. 'Additional surveys are needed in Yakutat Bay. A survey of Icy ·Bay was completed during this £seal year. 71. PRINCE WILLIA'¥ S<'>UND TO UNIMAK PAss.-A very·importa.nt ~t8oo'Of the Alaska coast extends from the waters of Prince William Sound westward to Unimak Pass. Not only are the industries of present importance, but there are extensive mineral resources largely ~ndevelop~d t~rough la~k. of cheaper transportation. 1:he point to b,e emphasized is that this is not an old, settled country, with its needs ·i~·.the matter of transportation fixed, but it is still capable ·of great future ~evelopment, and in considering the needed surveys its future must be· to.ken into account. The approaches to Prince William Sound ho.vi! ·been surveyed, and no resurveys for the present are needed except' in the vicinity of Cape St. Elias and Middleton Island. Wire-drag work will be needed· in both of these localities, as reefs .and pinnacle rocks exist. Prince William Sound needs additional :ioundings over niost of its area, and many of its branches need origmalsurveys. Cordova is the terminus of the Copper River & ·Northwestern Railway, .which gives access to the important copper mines on the Copper Riv.er. The approaches to Cordova have been sur1veyed, except for wir~-drag surveys needed to insure complete safety. Seward, on Resurrection Bay, is the terminus of the Alaska Railroad. The surveys of its approach are completed except for wire-drag work.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

It is probable that much of the trade originating along the lint\ ,0 f the Government railway will be transshipped at Anchorage, at the head of Cook Inlet. Not only will this make it necessary for many vessels.to navigate these waters, but there are now very large salmon canneries all along its shores, as well as considerable minmg. The present surveys are inadequate, and wire-drag work is needed over much of its area. Kodiak Island with a nU.mber of canneries and with some cattle grazing, is largely unsurveyed. From Kodiak Island westward to Unimak Pass surveys are now in progress; only a comparatively small part has been surveyed at present. While the amount of present traffic is small, it is sufficient to need, protection. At present the Coast Guard vessels and the freight and Passenger vessels run grave risks in using the protected natural channel:Ie~ding along the coast inside the island. This is a particularly bad stret~h of coast, with many reefs and islands. Only in the vicinity of the Shumagin Islands and from Unimak Pass to Unalaska Island have surveys been made, and they are inadequate. It is not now practicable to drag the entire area, but it is important that the immediate needs of navigation, even though of limited amount, be met by dragging a selected channel to insure the safety of vessels from Shelikof Strait ~o Unimak Pass. Unimak Pass is the almost universally used.channel into BerinO' Sea. It has been surveyed, put it is probable that part of it shou?d be dragged or at least further soundings be taken. (See fig; 22, opposite.) 72. ALEUTIAN IsLANDs.-The Aleutian Islands have comparativelv little traffic and are without· su,r:vey. .It .is.necessary.itha~ this. i:egion be patrolled by Coast Guard vessels. The loss of one of the vesseis of this service a :few years ago wns wholly due to the lac~ of adequate surveys. (See fig. 22, 01)posite.) 73. Brusm1, BAY.-A large part of the salmon shipped from Alaslm comes from Bristol Bay. This is without surveys except in Nushagak Bay and Kuskokwim Bay a?d Riyer. Both 0£ these have had recent surveys, but, as the bottom is subJeCt to change on account of the large river, future additional surveys will be needed; As an example of what surveys mean in a new re 0 'ion, the discovery of an entrance to the Kuskokwim River suitabie for moderate-draft vessels opened up an immense area for grazing and also in places fqr_gene:i;ll.l agriculture. (See fig. 22, op:i;>os1t~.) · . . , , , : .. . · 74. NORTON SouNn.-The importance of Nprt.on Sound is due to the gold mining on its northern shores and as bemg the outlet of tl~e Yukon Delta on the southern shore. In all of Norton Sound additional surveys are needed. It is curiou~ that i~ this sound, which according to all available information is 0£ qmte level, sandy, or muddy bottom, Besboro Island rises. v~ry abruptly to a hei_ght of 1,012 feet. With such an occurrence it is n.ot absolutely certain .that no pinnacle rocks exist. (See fig. 22, opposite.) 75. BERING SEA AND AncTic OcEAN.-Except in the vicinity of Pribilof Islands t~ere are no ot~er existing sm-ve;:s in Bering Sea or to the north which can be considered of value. (See fig.;22, opposite.) · ·. . 76. GuAM.-The present chart of the island of Guam is co111pi1t>d from Spanish and British charts 11nd some hnrhor s11rveys by the United Stutes Navy.

made. .A. complete survey should be made, .not only including the harbors, but the sui·rounding waters, carrymg the. work out to a depth that will be certain to include all dangers. In these waters shoals rise abruptly from great depths, and the absence of soundings on the charts does not imply saJety, but simply absence of 8UrVeJS. . , .77. -HAWAIIAN IsLANDs.-There are only two good harbors on all the Hawaiian Islands, and both of these are on Oahu Island. .A.II of the islands except Hawaii have coral reefs around at least part of them. In the vicinity of Oahu, Maui, Kahoolawe, and the south coast of Molokai the surveys are fairly complett;. In the vicinity of Hawaii the surveys are very ina4equate exc~p.t ~n the only harbor, Hilo Bay. The we~t coast <?~ Lanai and the. v1c1111ty of the western-· most islands, Jaua1 and N11h~u, are practically unsul'.veyed. rpie various channels between the islands from Taui to Oahu are fairly ·well surveyed. The others are practically without surveys. (See fig.'23, opposite p. 84.) __ ,,; , · 78. PHILIPPINE Isu:Nilfl.-The Philippine.Islands are composed of . -not le~ than 3,000 islands and islets covering an area of approximately 150,000 square miles and about the same as that of the five New England States and the State of New York combined. The total length of the general coast line, measured on small-scale charts using 3-mile spaces of dividers and omitting islands and bays.less than 3 miles long, is approximately 10,850 miles, or about the same as that for the entire Atlantic coast of the United States, including the islands. The unsurveyed hydrogr~he; covers a large. area on .acc.ount of ,the necessity of extendi,ng·. · ... work, .in sonie ·1ocalities for 'manyl,milesroffahore,. and on account of the very extensive area of the Sulu· Sea. The unsurveyed regions are as follows: The northeast coast of Luzon from Polillo Island. north:ward to Aparri; tho region. ?ff the north coast of Luzon, mcludmg the Bubyan Islands, Balmtang Channel, the Na tun Islands, and Bashi Channel; the west coast of, the island of Pala.wan; the south coast of Mindanao, from Pola Point to Malita, in Davao Gulf; the Sulu ArchiP~.N?.d,,.,thefiSulu Sea from the Tubbataha Reefs south to the limit of our possessions off the coast of Borneo. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 84.) 79. NORTHEAST COAST OF LuzoN.-This entire unsurveyed region, .from Polillo Island on the south to Aparri on the )10rth, is of little oommercial importance, and being quite free from dangers to navigation the execution of the work is being delayed until more impprtant localities are completed. Little reliable information relating to· t~ region is available, but a number of good anchorages have been rep?rted. .Among these are the inner harbors of Port San Vincente, p1lasac ~3ay, Casiguran Sound, and Dingalan Bay. The first and tlurd me:nti.oned are excellent typhoon harbors. The work must, ~owev~r, be done during the season of frequent typhoons, it being impossible to approach the coast at any other time of the year on account of the he8tvy sea caused by the northeast monsoon. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 84.) · . 80. OFF NonTH COAST OF LuzoN.-A survell should be made of the islands and the waters to the northward of Luzon as far as Bashi

Channel, as, in accordance with the numerous reports there is considerable uncertainty in regard to the true location of tl1e islands and the rocks that are dangerous to navigation in the locality. AS·it is in the region visited by frequent typhoons, the work should ·be undertaken during the period when the typhoons are less frequent. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 84.) 81. WEST AND EAST CoAST OF PALAWAN.-The coast line of the ~sland of Palawan is very irregular, indei:ited with deep bays, formmg some of the finest harbors m the arclupelago. The whole region about the island and extending southward to Balabac Island, to Cagayan Sulu, and off the north coast of Borneo consists of coral r~efs, 1!1-any small islets, and innumerable hidden dangers to navigat10n. f o the westward of Palawan reefs dangers e'Xltend tb . over 100 miles off shore. The hydrographic survey of this region.involves an immense amount of labor. A preliminary survey'for the lbcation of channels through the reefs and entrances to harbors will first be necessary. This work was in progress during the fiscal year. These l?calities mu~t be swept with the wire drag. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 84.) · 82. WEST CoAST OF.MINDANAO.-This island is of little commercial i~portance due to t~e absence of harbors a~d h'.lving a ru~ged n~oun tamous country adJacent to ·the coast·wluch 'IB'.not' adapte<t11to··th~ growth of any of the staple products. The usual steamer tracks do not approach the shore within 4 or 5 miles, a sufficient··distahce;<to avoid all dangers. For these .reasons 'the' ·stn:v~Y<fil·-dlow il;l progress have been postponed for more important localities. · · · !''' "··· 83. SouTir CoAsT OF MIND4NAo.-This stretch of about 150 miles, from Pola Point to Mali ta in Davao Gulf, is similar in many respects to the west coast. In general it is bold and steep, with numerous outlying reefs, which, however, do not extend a great distance from shore. The triangulation for furnishing the controlling positions for the hydro~raphy and topography presents a difficult problem, the shore line being invisible from the peaks and ridges but a short distance back. 84. Sm.u AnoHIPELAGo.-This region, about 75 miles wide, extending in a southwes~rly direction from Zamboanga on the southern coast of Mindanao to the coast of Borneo, a distance of about 180 miles, has scattered over it about 300 islands and islets and . nuincrons hidden dangers to navigation. Surveys in this area are now in prog" ress. It required a survey of the most careful and intricate character, and much of the locality must be swept with the wire drag after1 the present hydrographic survey is made. The formation is coral and dangerous to nangation, as rocks are frequently found in localities where they are least expected to exist. The currents in the region are very strong. The physical conditions are such that excellent control to coordinate the work with that along the coast of Mindanao ··can be obtained. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 84.) 85. Sur,u SEA.-The northern end as far south as the Tubbataha Reefs, except certain small areas, has been surveyed with ·a· fair d~ gree of accuracy, but owing to the coral formatibns, w.h:ere hidden dange1·s freqecntly exi.st, wire-drag sweeping will be necessary in selected passages.

GEODETIC WORK.

Th~ c,ontrol surveys carried on in the interi9r of the United St~tes and in Alaska by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey ar~ very important functions: of the Government, for they are essential to th,e efficient development of our industries, transportation, and commerce; There is SCll~cely a human activity of any magnitude that is not dependent on exact knowledge of the configuration of the ground within the 1n·ea in which the activity is carried on, and also on !l. knowledge o:f geographic positions and elevations of topographic fea.tures., All .of. this information is fu~nished by topogr__ayhic surveys such as are made by the topograpluc branch of the U. S. Geo-. logical Survey. .· . For many years the Coast and Geodetic Survey has been endeavoring to meet the .needs of the surveyor and map maker by extending long arcs of triangulation and lines of leveling through tlw count~y, but the· great expansion of our industries, commerce, and especially the development of our highway systems and the construction .of power plants have made the progress of the control stfrveys totally · l.ll8dequate to the demands made for control data. ..The Coa~t and Geode.ti<?-. SuJ:'.::ey ),s the only national organization chii;rged. with,: the extension of the fundamental control surveyi=i through the country and in Alaska, and the peoJ?le of !his country look to the Coast and Geodetic Survey to meet their requirements £or ge.ographic positions and elevations on which to base their surveys, ' . .. maps, and other engineering operations. ,':Theraarre.. aev.en aneas in,tJ\e; U:r,rited States to-day, .each greater than 100,000 square miles, in which there are no fundamental geographic positions, and there are seven ureas, each larger than 90,000 square miles, in which there are no precise elevations. This seems 1:9 be a most anomalous condition for a country like the United States1 which is- .so highly developed and which is spending so many millions of dollars annually in engineering works which require an accurate knowledge of position and elevation. Many millions of dollars are spent annually on highways alone, and yet it has been stated that if the country were completely surveyed tofographically and these surveys were based on precise fundamenta control systems the saving in a few years in the construction and maintenance of the highway system alone·would pay for completing the topographic map. It is strongly urged that funds be made available for the rapid construction and completion of the fundamental control work of the United States. It is.also urged that larger appropriations be mad~ available for the extension of control systems of Alaska which is now begin, ning Iii ·great industrial development. , · · · It is almost as unrea!!onable to expect surveys and maps to be made of a, large area without a proper framework in the fol'Jll of precise

triangulation and leveling as it would be to erect the walls, floors, and other parts of a large building without first having erected the steel framework. The appropriation made to the Coast and Geodetic Survey for carrying on gravity observations in the United States l?roper are adequa~e £.or t1:1a~ purpose, but it is believ~d to be very rmportant, and this view is mdorsed by many geologists, that the gravimetric survey of the United States should be extended to ofilymg islands and contiguous coasts with a view to studying. the condition of the earth's cr~st i~ regions beyond our own ~rea. It is also important that gravimetric surveys should be made m Alaska, Porto Rico, the Hawaiian Islands, the Philippines, and in other island possessions of the United States in order to extend the earth crust studies of the bureau. For this purpose additional appropriation and authority should be granted by Con~ress. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has cooperated with the U. S. Geological Survey in the extension of precise level lines in the States ·of Connecticut, Montana, and Wyoming. That part of the work to be done in Wyomin~ is largely in the Yellowstone Park. The chiefs of party and the mstrumental. equipment are furnished by the Coast and Geodetic Survey while the other equipment- e.nd· party expenses are provided by the U. S. Geological Survey. These two pieces of work are special in their nature and do not come withini the plans for genera,l control surveys._of:the °'Coai:;t. and Geodetic Survey which are fo be made in the near future. · ",, · ..-. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has cooperated to a limited exent during the past fiscal year with officials of Greensboro and Durham, N. C.; Richmond, Va.; and Columbus, Ohio. The cooperation consisted largely in giving advice and making suggestions as to the accuracy with which control surveys should be made over the areas of the cities in question. · · Excellent 12rogresi:; was made during the fiscal year on the earthquake investigation in California. The work consisted of precise triangulation; designed to detect any horizontal movements which have occurred within the area covered by the triangulation since . the stations were established from 25 to 40 years ago. Preliminary results of the work done during the season of 1922 have been furnished a number of seismologists, but final results will riot be avail-· able untillongitude determinations have been made at a number of the triangulation stations at which were also observed the astronomic azimuths. By means of the astronomic data; both the old and the new triangulation can be made more accurate, and differences in th~ geographic positions by the two systems will then most nearly reEresent earth movements. Several members of the Coast and Geodetic Survey have taken part during the past fiscal year in the activities of ·the Board of Surveys nnd Maps, created b:y Executive order to encourage; coopera:tion of the various map makmg and map using bureausr of the Government. The board has done excellent work in standardizing surveying and mapping practices and has been the means of enabling officials of the various bureaus to get in personal contact, with the results that each bureau having representation on the board is doing its utmost to be of service to any other bureau needing its help.

The board has also been the means of disseminating information to the public _in regard to the survey~ng .and mapping data which exist in the various Government orgamzatlons. The cooperative plan arranged during the previous fiscal year by officials of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and of the General Land Office, whereby an engineer of the latter organization was to be assigned to each of the triangulation parties of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was continued in effect during the fiscal year 1923. It was found that by this plan it was possible to identify positively General Land Office marks and tie them into the triangulation system of the country. This resulted in furnishing horizontal coordmates for the ]and system in the regions covered by the trian~lation which will make it possible for the land lines to be J?laced m their proper geographic positions on maps made by orgamzations of the Government and by private map makers.
PRESENT CONDITION OF THE MAGNETIC SURVEY.

The magnetic survey of the United States as planned in 1899 included the establishment of a magnetic station at every county seat in the United States. This plan is so near completion that there remain only 136 county seats to be occupied out of a total of 3,064. Of this number 34 are new counties established since the survey in their region, and 102 are, in most cases, in counties that were not readily reached at the time of the survey. The magnetic survey as being carried on at the present time. includes observations at the hitherto unoccupied county seats, observations at new stations not at: county 8eats,· additional observations in places of local magnetic disturbances, the occupation of repeat stations, and the recovery and replacement of old stations, including the station and reference mark. The two last-named parts of the work are chief in magnitude and importance. A program has been adopted which includes the occupation of a.bout·40 ·statibns a year 'for the' purpose. of supplementing the observatory observations in recor<ling the changes m the earth's magnetism. These stations nre scattered throughout the United States, and the work is so planned that, in so far as possible, each one will:be occcupied at five-year intervals. Durin~ the fhical yenr a very successful effort was made to learn the condition of magnetic stations from county and other local surveyors in order that the stations might be kept in such condition ns to be available for local use in standardizing surveyinO' instruments. As the result of information from these surveyors and the field operations of the bureau, the condition of 767 out of 3,719 stations, or 20.6 per cent of the total numl)(>r, is now known; :.325 of tlws(> need replacement in part or entirely, in addition to 24 which have been inspected and replaced during the year. The replacement program is now of greater importance than the occupation of new stations. As the result of correspondence with more than 1,000 local surveyors the conditions are better known than formerlyin regard to the use of magnetic survey methods throughout the United States. The States will be discussed in detail.

NORTH CAROLINA.-A complete magnetic survey 0£ the State>was made by cooperation of the State Geological Survey with the .Coast and Geodetic Survey. Through the cooperation of the State geolo· gist and various local surveyors the present condition of 82 of the stations is known; 40 need replacement in various degrees, and this work will be started during the next fiscal year. Improvement in magnetic methods .used in making land surveys is an ur~ent need of this State according to the various reports. The magnetic conditions generally favor the use of the compass, nnd much· early work was done with inferior instruments and methods at a time when land was cheap; consequently difficulty has arisen in retracing old lines. The information :furnished by this bureau is in constant demand and is considerably used. . · · . · . SOUTH CAROLINA.-The magnetic, compass is much nsed, but the failure of early surveyors to understand secular change in the declination has caused much trouble. Much needed replacement of sta· tions is planned for the near future. Many surveyors find the information :furnished by this bureau to be very useful. · GEORGIA.-Frequent land surveys are made by magnetic methods. Errors made in the early surveys are the source 0£ much trouble, and the lack of know ledge of the secular change has introduced many errors. The State is subdivided into comparatively small counties, and it is therefore a greater .task to keep the stations at county seats in available condition. The work, however, has been systematiCally undertaken and should be completed within a few years. ' FLORIDA.-Surveys by magnetic methods are considered 'very satisfactory; With the ·recent completion of an extensive program there are now stations at all county seats, all of which have been occupied since 1914, the great majority of them within the last two years. Little additional work in Florida is contemplated at the present time. . AL;\BAMA.-Land surveys by magnetic methods are frequently made. S~~~ discrepan.cies _in the old surveys ~rnve been r~port;ed. The poss1b1hty o:f findmg iron ore by magnetic methods is bemg investigated. . M1ss1ssJI·pr.-The early surveys in .Mississippi were made from 1826 to 1834, and in many cases there is considerable difficulty in _ rerunning these old lines. There is considerable interest in the use of m~netic methods. · .TENNESSEE.-'rhe early surveys cover the period from 1796 to 1837. Discrepai1cies in regard to these old lines are frequent. The information ftirnished by this buren u is stated to be extremely valuable and is frequently requested for ·use in court. Considerable replacement work is n~ded in addition to that which was in progress at the end of· the fiscal year. · KENTUCKY.-There is considerable demand for magnetic information, and the replacement· of defective stations is important. · The isogonic lines are very i.rregulnr in this State, and more observations are needed. 0Hrn.-Smveys arc mndc from time to time by magnetic metliods, 'but, as a' rul~, more accurate methods are in general use.

lNDIANA.-The early lines were all ·run with the magnetic compass, but .the :compass is not used in rerunning such lines; More accurate methods are used in the vicinity of cities. ' '·· lLLINOis.-There is a moderate. amount of interest in magneti~ stations, especially in points where the true meridian has been estab:.. lished. In most of the early surveys the General Land Office used the magnetic compass, and inform~tion in regard to changes in the declination is of considerable importance. In some parts of the State land surveys are now being made by compass, in others it is considerably used for retracing old lines. Correspondence ·vith surveyors mdicates interest, and the discussion is exceptionally intelligent. There is but little local disturbance in the southern part of the State but considerable in the northern. · WIBOONSIN.-Much of the early surveying was done with the magnetic compass, and it is still used in retracing old lines. In Home parts of the State the loss of monuments is becoming a serious matter. There is considerable interest in magnet~c stations and in current values of the declination, apparently fdr comparison with valuM in use for retracing old lines. :MINNESOTA:-There is .. moderate use for the magnetic needle to retrace su.rvey~ :made .60. y. ears· a. go .. There is considerable -local dis. .. . . :·· · ,. ' turbance m this State. . . . IowA.-Areas of local.disturbance ate· widespread· and ·handicap the local: sur.v~or who desires to use magnetic methods. · · Missounr.-The early surveys were made from about 1815 to 1820 by use of. the magnetic needle. There is considerable interest in present and past values of the magnetic declination. The mag11etic needle is much· used ·for farm and woodland surveying. The condition of·50 per.cent of stations is known, and about half· of these require. replacement. . In some parts of the State there is consideranle local attraction. .. . . . AruuNsAs.-The ·early surveys were made from 1825 to 1830, and many of the old corners have disappeared. Early and present values of the declination are in constant demand. The condition of about 50 per cent of the stations i~ known, and of these about half need revision. · LomsIANA.-Some of the surveys known as Spanish grants were made prior to the purchase of the territory in 1803 and are hard .to trace. Many of the surveys were made between 1812 and 1835, but there.. is considerable difficulty in retracing these, even with the best available magnetic information. There is considerable need· fo1· in~ s_pection and replacement of magnetic stations which have beco:ro.e.· defective. · . :· TExAs.-Various methods were used in the early surveys of Texas ; many of them defective because made in the presence of hostile Indians. In some parts of Texas the vara is used and the determination of bea,rings by rough magnetic methods. 'A strong appreciation is expressed of the usefulness of the magnetic data· of the station. The loss of ·stations has been exceptionally high for variouEi reasons, and from Jmown information a year's work of one, observer would be required for re:Qlacements. Twenty-one county seats l1aye not yet been occupied. Conditions are favorable to the use 9f the magnetic needle in making surveys. .

The information· in regard to the conditiOn of stations is fairly complete for North Carolina, Florida, Arkansas, Missouri, TeX:as, New Mexio, Arizona,· and California. The amount· of revisi'on work required in the other States is not always indicated, as the facts· are not accurately known. In general, the correspondence indicates that magnetic methods were .and are used where land is cheap, and the expense of a· more accurate survey has not appeared to be warranted. Further, in l?ractically all of the States land surveys have been made by magnetic methods some time in t.he. past, and magnetic information is needed for refracing old lines. There are many parts of the country where the use of instruments prop·erJy standardized at the Coast and Geodetic Survey stations would greatly improve the records and prevent future disputes.

the ·present condition of the magnetic survey,, is so closely related that i~ can not be ignored. . . · · Ponro Rroo.-It is expected that all necessary work will be done . during. the next fiscal year. . ALASKA.-A considerable amount of magnetic work has been done along the main lines of travel, but little of it is recent. Observations of the declination made recently in southeastern Alaska are especially valuable in defining areas of local disturbances. · Little magnetic information is available for the interior of Alaska. Observations are needed along the lines of the Government railroad There is especial need for observations on the Aleutian Islands, owing to the fact that the Great Circle course from the Pacific coast of the United States to the Orient passes close to these islands. Observations should be made on some of the islands in Bering Sea. 'J;he small v.alue of the horizontal force and lack of knowledge of the values:of the decµnation and possible flu. ctua.tions make ~avigation precarious. It will take several years of contmuous work m Alaska to obtain needed information. IIA w An.-Occupation of repeat stations and revision of stations is needed. Gu,AM.-Magnetic surveys have been made by this bureau, but advantage should be taken of a stop by transport at Guam to occupy one or more repeat stations. : PnILIPPINE.ls1..ANDS.-The occupation of repeat stations and revision of stations :is, urgently needed, and this work· should be taken up without .delay. · It;.is :only :because we know· frQm observations at Manila. .that the, secular ,change is slight ·at the present time that this lack of a magnetic resurvey has not resulted in placin~ erroneous values of the declination on the charts of the Philippme Islands. It. is probable that the rate of secular change. will increase in the near future. . ·· . OssERVATORIF.S.-Each of the observatories is now furnishing a complete and continuous record of the values of the magnetic elements.·. As these instruments record only the variations, determinatioris of the absolute values are frequently made. The result of this work is that at five widely scattered places within the jurisdiction of the United States-namely, Vieques, P. R.; Cheltenham, Md.; Tucson, Ariz.; Sitka, Alaska; and near Honolulu, Hawaii-continuous values of the magnetic elements are ·available. As a result it is possible to reduce the values obtained in the.field surveys to the standard values. Need for this is indicated by the statement that without such correction the change in declination from year to year could not be furnished. The observatory records show magnetic storms for periods when the actual values differ more or less from the normal values. The observatories near the seacoast have an important function in that they indicate the rates of change from yea:r to year over adjoining sea areas. This makes it unnecessary to remeasure the declination at frequent intervals. Even with the old-type seismograph in use at all stations except one a great amount of useful information in regard to earthquakes has been obtained. The observatories are in a position to do a much higher grade of seismological work if made of primary importance as a function of the work. The five observatories named do not pro-

There·is urgent need, however, for obser>ations in the shallow waters along the Atlantic coast, and these could be made by means of a: nonmagnetic launch or $cow which ·could be held in a given direction. It should be understood that in most cases present values for most of the bays and· inlets are deduced from shore observations, and accordingly the charts do not show· areas of local disturbances. · · ' · ·" 'TIDE AJ>o."'1) CURRENT wonK.

The current observations carried on for a number of years on tR.e liaS'ht vessels along both_ coast~ of the United States. in connec~ion with a study. of coastal wmd-driven currents have furmshed sufficient data to warrant giving the mariner considerable information relative to the general law of coastal currents. Since the current data obtained from the observations on the light vessels limit our knowl'edge of the coastal currents to the ·vicinities of these vessels only, it is necessary finally to make short ·series of observations from a survey vessel anchored at critical points between and simultaneous· with ob~ servations at the light vessels. A correlation of the two series can then be made looking toward obtaining average conditions at these midway critical points. Such a survey is designed to bring out the effects of both the tidal currents and the wind-driven currents along the entire coast. · 'l'his work was begun in the early·part of the calendar year 1922 on the Eacific coast. The -Suri·eyor between Alaska seasons occupied four stations along the coasts of 'Vashington and Oregon between light vessels. It has been found impossible, however, to continue this important work because of lack of sufficient experienced mathematicians in the office to work up the results ·and at the same time pre~ pare the tide and current tables for the mariner and carry on the other normal activities of the tide and current division of the bureau. This emphasizes again the need of about six additional- computers of a subprofessional. grade to permit the division .to carry on the work n~c~s~ary to the proper and economical functioning of this important d1vis10n. .' · · ·:; · : : .· · 'l'he ·officers charged ·with the worU of this division are m~king every effort to reduce to a minimum the amount of work .of a routine nature. This result is gradually being accomplished by the devising of new instrnments, methods, and forms for lessening this class of work. During the p11;st year a por~a?l.e tide gauge for the fie~d wo~·k of the survey was devised by this d1v1s1on, the record :from which will l'equire no tabulations by the office force but constitutes a com.Plete record in itself. It is proposed to devise a larger instrument havmg a somewhat similar record to replace the instruments now maintained at :the principal tidal stations of the survey. ·It is also proposed during the next year to devise a form for tabulating :for mean sea level directly· from the record to an adding machine· carrying this form; · · -.;

The current and tidal· conditions in our principal harbors are not well known; but with the recent· survey in New .York Harbor;·followed during the next fiscal year by such a survey in San Francisco Harbor, the following year in Delawaire Bay, etc.-, will bring this phase :of the work fairly well in hand. All ·this field work is done in cooperation with the :Army eno'ineers charged· with the development of the harbors;· who have.stoo~ half the expense of the:field operations, the Coast and Geodetic Survey making all office computation and discussing and interpreting the resulting dat~ · · . · . Another matter of considerable importance in the tidal and current survey of our principal harbors is the encircling of the harbor with a line of precise levels, with br~nch lines where necessary, to c?nnect all bench marks over the area mto a common datum plan~. This was not necessary at the time the survey was made in New York Harbor, owing tO the :fact that such a precise level net was already in existence over·:thn.t:ferritory. The appropriation for tidal and current work should be increased ·for the next fiscal year by $1,500 to do this essen~ tial work. · . The cooperation of the Canadian Tidal and Current Survey has been obtained in securing observations in Seymour Narrows, Alaska, with a view to improving the predictions of slack waters for this strait, which is of considerable importance to United Stat~s vessels plying between our ports and southeastern Alaska. The observations made by Canadian officials during the present summer will be :furnished th'is bureau for analysis and predictions on the Coast Survey predicting machine. ' The currents in Seymour·Narrows are of the hydraulic type, found in straits connecting two independently tided bodies of water, and are due to a temporary difference in head between the two bodies of water brought about ?Y tidal a~tion. Whil~ it is a comparatively simJ?le matter to predict from tidal observations at each end of the strait the times the heads will be equalized and that slack water should occur, account must be taken of the momentum of this mass of water and of the continuance of the flow due to this inertia after equalization of heads. No satisfactory series of tidal observations are at present available for each end of Seymour Narrows, and the Canadian Tidal and Current Survey has expressed a willingness to obtain these observations during the summer of 1923. These tidal observations, together with slacks observed several years ago, will make possible the accurate predicting of future slack waters for this important waterway in which at times the current velocity reaches 8 to 10 knots. This is but one example of the cooperation <1f Canada and England in this important work. For many years the United States and En~land each made tidal predictions for a considerable number of the same ports published m their respective tide tables. A cooperative arrang~~ent was made wher~by the Coast Survey furnished England pred1ct10ns for five ports m exchange for five. This has since been increased to nine ports, and recently the British Admiragy has requested that the number be increased to 15.

ing_ information relative to densities, temperatures, ocean currents, and related matters to navigators, engineers, and scientists, very little has been done and much is required to bring our state of knowledge and amount of information to that of other even less important maritime nations. We have the Gulf Stream parallel· ing our entire Atlantic seaboard. A study of this oceanic river is one of the.most important items in oceanography, which should be continued systematically by the survey. Considerable wotk of a reconnaissance nature was done a number of years ago by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in this important field, but lack of funds has not permitted further work. ' At !?resent the survey is making use of every available means for obtainmg densities and temperatures. These are now being secured at 14 of the princjpal tidal stations maintained by the survey, and during the past year an attempt has been made to have densities and temperatures of the sea water made by observers on the light vessels in connection with the current observations being made ·on those vessels through the cooperation of the Lighthouse Service.

HYDROGRAPHIC AND TOPOGRAPIDO WORK.

ATJ,ANTIC CoAsT.-Offslwre hydrography.-The steamer Lydonia will continue the offshore hydrography in the vicinity of the Cape Fear Rivl!r, which work is now m progress, until the latter part of November, when work will be taken up in the continuation of the offshore h;ydrography in the vicinity of St. Augustine, Fla. This latter work will continue until near the end o; the fiscal year, when work will again be resumed by this vessel in the vicinity of the Cape Fear River. The steamers Bache and Ilyd1·ographer 1"ill continue the work in the Gnlf of Mexico in the vicinity of Sabine Pass, extending the work westward toward Galveston. . Wire-drag work~-The work is now in progress off the coast of Maine, will be continued until· the latter part of September; and if appropriations are sufficient will be taken up again next spring. Inshore h:yd1·ogmphy and topography.-If. funds are available the latter part of. the fiscal .year, inshore. hydrography and topography .from Bull Bay to Wmyah Bay. will be completed, and tlns class of work will be continued from Savannah south. In addition to the inshore hydrography a topographic revision of the shore line will be accomplished by the parties working on the Milcawe and Elsie. If funds and equipment are available, a survey of Lake Okeechobee will be made during the fiscal year. Virgin1slands.-The steamer Ranger with wire-drag launches will make a hydrographic survey of the Virgin Islands, supplementing the hydrography by wire-drag work. This survey will include a survey of all harbors and passages in these islands. PACIFIC CoAST.-Offshore hydrography.-Vpon arrival of the steamer Guide on the west coast she will continue the offshore hydrogmphy in the vicinity of southern California executed by the steamers Discove1·e·r and Pwnee1' during the last fiscal year. This work will extend from the completed work close in shore to the 1,000-fathom curve and will be continued until March. From April until the end of the fiscal year the Guide will continue the offshore hydrogrnphy in the vicinity of Cape Blanco commenced by the party on the steamer Lydonia during the fiscal year 1922. Revision wo1·k.-Durin'g the winter the parties which worked in ' Alaska during the summer will make revision surveys of different harbors of Puget Sound.

Wire-drag surveys.-The steamer Explorer will continue wiredrag operations during the summer of 1923, which will complete the wire-drag work along the main inside ship channels from Dixon Entrance to Cape Spencer. Dependent upon the appropriations, it is uncertain whether or not that vessel will be engaged !luring the next fiscal season in the dragging of the more important side passages and of those arms and bays to which vessels go regularly. ' Inshore hydrrnraphy.-As stated in the above paragraph, it is upcertain whether or not the party on the steamer Explorer will be engaged in wire-drag work during the next fiscal year. If the party is not so employed, a much-desired survey of Keku Strait and Tuxekan Passage by the partr on the steamer Explorer will be executed. WESTERN ALAsn:A ...;_1 riangulatwn, hydrography, and topography.-The partY. on the steamer Dwaoverer will continue work in the vicinity of Shehkof Straits upon which she is now engaged during the fiscal year. The Yukon will be used by this/arty. ThePioneerwill continue the survey of Morzhovoi and Col Bays and the offshore work in the vicinity of Cape Pankof, upon which she is now engaged during the fiscal year. The launch W ildaat will be used in connection with this party. If funds are available, the Natoma will be used in making a survey of the northern part of Prince William Sound and of bays and inlets in this vicinity used regularly by commercial steamers. .HAWAIIAN IsLANDS.-/nshore hydrography.-The work will be executed by a detached party in the Hawaiian Islands during the fiscal year 1924 in the vicinity of Lahaina .Roads. PHILIPPINE IsLANos.-Triangulation and hydrograpliy.-Three vessels, the Pathfinder, Fatlwmer, and Marindluque, will operate· dur" ing the fiscal year in continuation of the projects on which they are now engaged. This will include general survey operations on the west coast of Palawan Island and work in the southern part of the Archipelago. OCEANOGRAPHY. The steamer ·ouide on the trip from the east to the west coast: of the United States will make deep-sea soundings and accumulate specimens of the oottom and water samples taken at the bottom. A sonic sounding apparatus has been installed and will be used in connectio~ with the deer.-sea sounding machine in the determination o~ .depths. This work will be so planned as to supplement the work of this nature done during the last few years, so upon its completion there be an excellent deep-sea survey on the route followed by vessels from the east coast to the west coast of the United States via the Panama Canal.

TIDAL AND CURRENT WORK.
.:.

. ..
~,

Early in the fiscal year, in cooperation with the Army engineers, it is proposed to carry out an extensive and final current and tidal survej' of San Francisco Harbor, for which an appropriation was made by the last Congress. Principal tidal stations representative of tidal conditions along the different stretches of coast will be continued at the following places:
Portland, Me. Boston, Mass. Atlantic City, N. J. Philadelphia, Pa. Baltimore, Md. Charleston, S. 0. Fernandina, Fla. Key West, Fla. Cedar Keys, Fla. Pensacola, Fla. Galveston, Tex. San Diego, Calif. San Francisco, Calif. Seattle, Wash. Anacortes, Wash.

The t~dal station at Anacortes, Wash., establ.ished for the :purpose of definmg a mean sea-level datum for connectm~ the Canadian and · American precise leveling, will be continued durmg the fiscal year; also the tidal station estabHshed at Anchorage, Alaska, for· the purpose of defining a mean sea-level datum for controlling the precise leveling in that section of Alaska. , In cooperation with the Scripps Institute, a principal tidal station will be installed on the lonB' ocean pier at La Jolla, Calif. The importance of this station hes in its being the only station maintained by this survey on the open ocean on the Pacific coast. It will correspond to the ocean station maintained at Atlantic City for the Atlantic coast. The tide gauge loaned to the Gandy Bridge Co. and installed at St. PetersburB', Fla., will be continued durin~ the year for the purpose of definmg tidal datum planes for use m connection with the construction of the bridge across Old Tampa Bay. The record from this gauge becomes the property of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at no cost except for the loan o:f a self-registering gauge. One of the new portable automate· tide gauges devised during th~ past year by this bureau will be installed at Los Angeles, at the

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

103

request of that city. This gauge will be maintained by the city anJ the record become the property of the survey. . It is proposed to maintain a tidal station at Washington, D. C., for the purpose of testing, under the immediate supervision of this office, new instrumentc:i and appliances for the observation of tides. It is a part of the program of the tidal and curren.t work for the fiscal year to continue the iristalliition of standard staffs and backing pieces to replace the old type staffs at all the principal stations maintained by the survey. In order to maintain a fixed zero of staff, a most essential matter in obtaining a long series of tidal observations, tide staffs of standard design with special backing piece, caf, ana stop were desi!ined in the division in 1920, a.pd installation o these are being ma~e' as the different stations are visited i.mtil all the . . . · . principal. stations. are so ~uiJ?I?ed. A precise-leyel party will visit the locations of d1scontmued tidal stations in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey for the I>urpose of le.veling to old nonregulation bench marks as they may be reco':ered and installing sufficient standard disk. ben.c~ marks to comply with the present policy of the survey of mamtammg five standard bench marks at all stations having a year of observations and one additional for each additional year of observations to a maximum of 10 disk bench marks. This work is absolutely necessary in order to perpetuate long series of observations which are now protected by a few nonregulati<m bench marks, many of which have been destroyed and others in danger of being lost. · Datum l>lanes for· the use' of the engineer and marinei·, based on tidal definition, are the only ones which lend themselves to ~oordina tion of surveys widely distributed and subsequently brought together. The survey has for many years by means of its principal and Sl,\bsidiary tidal stations established bench marks, and is furnishing to engineers in all parts of the country descriptions an<l elevations of such bench marks based on mean sea level. Since an accurate determination of mean sea level can be obtained only from a comparatively long series of observations, the value of such bench marks and the importance of their preservation is apparent. In order to carry on this essential work, it has been found necessary to curtail somewhat the c~rrent observatio~s on t.he light v~ssels on both coasts. On the Atlantic coast observations w1ll be contmued only on Nantucket Shoals· and Diamond Shoals Light Vessels. On the Pacific coast current observations will be continued for the full year at Blunts Reef Light Vessel, and for the period of the current and tidal survey of San Francisco Harbor observations will be made on Sun Francisco Light Vessel.

working grounds outside the Virginia capes, stopping. on. the wa,y to ·visit the tide gauge at Flshermans Island. On July 21 the hydrographlc work· began and was continued throughout the season. By November B all of the hydrographlc work planned for the party, excepting one dead-reckoning line, had been completed and sounding operations were concluded. The vessel then returned to Norfolk, picking up the tide gauge from Flshermans Island on the way in. The following week the vessel went out again to obtain log factors and afterwards returned to port, thus closing the season's operations in this. locality. Further repairs to the vessel were then undertaken and were In progress until December 12. After further Inspection of the boller some additional repairs were found necessary, and these were not completed until December 28. No further field work was done during the first half of the fiscal year. During the season a number of tall hydrographic signals were erected along the coast south of Virginia Beach, the last being at Coast Guard Station No. 166 (new stati6n), or.4 miles .north of Currituck Light. It was impracticable to locate them by trlangulatlon, and so the prellmlnary location of these signals was by topographic methods. An accurate taped t,raverse was made later by a separate. party. The southern limit of fixed position hydrography is· the 36° 80'" p,ilrallel,.of latitude, a~d the southernmost dead-reckoning llne ls in apprQxh;Iiately latitude 86° 82'. Wor)i was begun at the lower end· and curried to the northward, and the whole area north to the junction of the old :work was completed. The work extended to the 100-futhom curve, except where extension to the 1,000-futhom curve was required by supplem.entul instructions of June 6. Fixed position work was carried out ubou~ 16 miles, and· beyond that all lines were located by dead reckoning. Sounding was done by the launch in -the inshore area from the 2-futhom 'to the 5-fathom curve. The survey buoys were of the same type as those prevlousl' used. The ·st>acing of lines conforms to the requirements of the instructions. .· . . · Comparison was made of existing soundings and no new shoal spots ·were found within the area controlled by fixed positions.

With the exception of the chief of party, the officer personnel remained unchanged. The work was a continuation of that in progress in the immediately preGedlng months under the direction of Lieut. Commander R. F. Luce. The usual methods for executing this class of work were employed. An automatic tide gauge was established at St. Augustine on March 18, and readings continued tm April 30. The gauge was placed in the sume position occupied in 1016, a'nd the staff refeued to the same bench marks. · II.11drography.-In the area coYereci by Captain Luce a number of splits nnd cross lines were run, and the work was extended out to the 100-fathom curve.

While the primary object of this work wns to locate signals for launch hydrogruphy, considerable detail was shown around Matanzas Inlet. In accordance with Instructions dated January 10, 1923, a spe.cial examination was made of the spring off the coast of Florida below St. Augustine. In general, the examination consisted of a hydrographlc development, collection of water specimens at various depths, and a record of temperatures at various depths.

The survey of ,the coast of Florida has been followed with interest by mariners' using these waters; the accurate location of the 107fathom curve interests them particularly. The current and temperature observations on the dead-reckoning lines give valuable information which can be compared with previous investigations of the Gulf Stream, and an accurate determination. of the inshore limits of the Gulf stream, a subject which is of great interest to marinere. ·

Olson, deck. officer, from August 5. . ;:t'hls· abstract covers the operations of the steamer H y(lrographer from. the date of taking up combined work in the viclnlty of. Chandeleur and .Breton .Sound to the date of its completion. The party began t;his project on June 12, 1922, most of the time to the beginning of the fiscal year being occupied with the necesssary preparatory work. .As no part of this proje<:t had previously been reported, the summary of results includes a very small amount: of hydrography accomplished prior to July 1. During this period the area east of Chandeleur and Breton Island extending from latitude 29° 41' southward to Pass a Loutre entrance and between the 2 and 15 fathom curves was sur· veyed. In addltlon to this, an ai.'ea of approximately 170 square miles was sur: veyed in Chandeleur Sound In the vicinity of North, Freemason, and. Barbor Islands and the topography ,of. these islands completed. . . . , ';l'he ,se":f!IO.i:l.'a work ,c,cimpleted .th~ bydrogr'!-J;lhlc worl!; which Wf!.S started eai;it of Pllnsacola in 1919, and es;tend,ed. westward to Southwest Pass, Mississippi Delta. The portion completed during -the present season by the party on the 'steamer Hydrographer joins the fixed position work of the steamer Bache to the northward, the dead-reckoning work of the steamer Bache to the eastward, and a previous survey of the steamer Hydrographer to the southward. · Control for all of the work done during the season was obtained from re:covered triangulation stations established by the party OD the Hydrographer during a prevl9us season. Many of the signals were still standing. It was necessary, however, to build several tall hydrographlc signals· and supplement these ·with additional smaller ones. A 100-foot signal was built on Breton Island and an 80-foot signal on Errol Island. Special attention was paid to the signal bu:lt on Errol Island, ns two signals built here by previous parties had been destroyed by the shifting of the sand within the course of a few months. To protect this signal fro~ the action of the seas which wash around its bilse, n wooden bulkhead was constructed entirely around its base and the space inside the bulkhead filled with sand. · ·· · Shore signals furnished control for approximately one-half the distance to the 15·fnthom curve, which in this locnllty fs 17 miles om.more. For the outer part of the work control was furnished by a line of buoys about 3 miles apart and as far out' as it was possible to locate them with cuts :l'rom shore fixes. With the exception of a small area at the north end of the work where lt was necessary to plant three nddltlolial markers, this single line of buoys made It possible to carry fixed positions to the 15-fathom curve." A new tYPe of buoy was designed for this work and excellent results obtained with it. The only topography done during the season was that of the' islands known as North, Freemason, and Old Harbor, which form a chain extending for 15 miles in a southwesterly direction from Chandeleur Island. These islands have undergone extensive changes since the last survey. In general, the. islands have shifted to the southeastward, while large portions of them have been washed away entirely. These changes have been brought about by northwest storms, which occur frequently during the winter months. . . . · . ·. 64261-28--8

".'" "" .. ;;1. · .. : . : .. ,. :. .. · . To control the survey· the triangulation stations Pat Glennon Buyou 1874 and Sabine Pass Lighthouse 1874 were recovered. As a checlt on the recovery of.these stations the station Johmmn Buyou 1909 was recoYered. Inverse com· putntlons were ·made for the bllses between the latter !iltation and each of· the other two. Using the three sides of this fixed ·triangle us bases, a five-pointed central point· figure. was expanded oYer the entrance .to Sabine Pass and the sides of this figure used as buses ·to. locate all the hydrographlc signals thus tar: used in the survey.. The tall hydrogrephlc signals are each 100 feet high and are spaced '! nautical miles apart. This gives control for a· distance of approximately 12 miles· offshore. As it is necessary to carry the fixed position hydrogmphy from 19 to 23 miles.offshore, the tall signals have been supplemented with two rows of buoys, the outer row being close to the outer lhnlt of the fixed-posttlon work:and the inner row approximately 6 miles lnsh6re·from the oute1· 1·m.v. The buoys are planted and located in conjunction with the party on the steamer Bache, which vessel uses the outer row for determining the Inner ends of her dead-reckoning lines. The topography has consisted simply in a revision of the shore line. In general the shore line has changed very little. From· work accomplished thus far it appears that the coast is building out somewhat to the eastward of Sabine Pass and. is eroding somewhat west of the pass. On account of. the high marsh grass which fringes the shore for severnl miles east and west of Snhine ·Pass. it was impracticable to use the plane table for all of this worlc, and the greater part of the coast line. was located wlth the sextant. The topography was carried up Sabine Puss until ·II. connection was made ·With the present chart.

As the area being charted by tbe party ls of comparatively shallow deptb and ls used by deep-draft vessels, extreme care ls taken to obtnln accurnte soundings as well as to obtain correct tidal· reducers. In certain areas very strong currents and in others a very soft bottom make It difficult to obtain accurate soundings, and it has been necessary tQ rerun a few lines under better conditions in order to obtain satisfactory crossings. All soundings have been taken. with lead line made of waterproofe.d, bronzecentered, tiller rope No. 8. These lines have been marked to the nearest foot up to 8 fathoms. which Is tlte maximum depth of water within .the entire area. When engaged on hydrographlc work the officers and crew are divided Into two watches. The first watch ls on duty from the time signals are Vil'Jlble in the morning until 8 a. m. and from 12 noon until 4 p. m. The second watch ls on duty from 8 a. m. until noon and from 4 p. m. untU signals are shut out by darkness. · When work wns first started in this locality u tidal stntlon wni;i established at Sabine· P11ss Lighthouse and .an observer employed. However, it wns found that this observer was not very reliable, and as no other observer could be obtained a second tldnl station was estubllshed on the opposite side of the pass, n.t the U. S. Coast Guard station. The staff at the second station was set at the same level as the first, and by simultaneous observations on the two staff's it was found, as supposed, that the ranges were the same. The reference plane for the reduction of soundings was obtained by making simultaneous observations for four consecutive days with the automatic gauge at Galveston, Tex. In order to obtain the difference In rnnge between the tide at the Coast Guard stntlon nnd the Gulf, observations were made at East· Jetty Lighthouse and the range at this station found to be 50 per cel)t larger ·than· the ,range In the pass. Since the range In the pass is 40 per cent greater than the range at Galveston, the range ln the Gulf ls 2.1 times the range at Galveston. The currents are very strong in this locality, particularly In the areq west of Sabine Pass between Sabine Bank and the coast. The .prevailing set, which ls southwestward, ls increased greatly by winds from the northeast, east, and southeast. Winds from the south and southwest tend to counter· balance the prevulUng set, and it blowing hard enough cause the current to set In an easterly direction. While running north and south sounding lines west of Sabine Pass with light easterly breezes, it has been found necessary to uUow as much as 25° for the current setting to the westward. This would correspond to a current of 2.2 knots setting to the westward, and lt is probable that with the southerly component the actual current would approach 3 knots. With easterly gales this current Is Wldoubtedly Increased to 4 or 5 knots. Thus far the only change of Importance from previous surveys found ls tbe building out of the shoal west of Sabine Pass. It was found that the shoal ls encroaching on the much used lane between Galveston and Sabine Pass. This undoubtedly ls due to the effect the jetties have on the· deposit of sediment which ls brought down the pass or dropped by the dredges. The prevalllng westerly set carries the sediment to the westward, where It ls deposited when coming In contact with the eddy caused by the jetties protruding into the Gulf. The report that the passage throughout Sabine Bank, locnlly known as the "Hole in the Wall," has shoaled to 30 feet ls Incorrect. It ls possible that the master of the vessel making thl~ report obtained a 30-foot sounding in the passage, but ns this occurred on a minus tide during a "Norther" the water level was perhaps at that time as much as S feet below the reference plane. The present survey shows 33 feet as the least depth in the locallty of the reported shoaling. All tall signals used on the present survey are of the standard Coast Survey type and are 100 feet in height. These are spaced approximately 4 nautical miles apart and are visible from the bridge of the Hydrographer for 15 mlles. The buoys used are of the single steel drum type.

On July 15 a tidal and 'current survey ·o~ ·New York Harbor wns begun lri cowith the Un\ted $.tiitef! ~ripy:.!l)ngln~rs; PrellmlllJlry arrangements for. this work had been dlscuBBed by representatives .of,the United States Army engineers and the chr~· of division of tides and currents of the Const itnu Geodetic Survey, and an agreement had been arrived nt as to the extent of the cooperation, such as the equipment to be f:lupplled and the number of units each bureau was to furnish, and also the assignment of the stations to be occupied by the dilrerent units. The Qoast and Geodetic Survey launches Ogden, Rogcws, and Elaie III were used· in this work and Inter on tile Mikawe. · The launch Gannett' belonging to the United· States Engineers was also equipped for the work' 'of observations, 'but proved \msultable lliid ll barge was substituted. The plan finally adopted w·as that ortglnally decided upon that the Coast and Geodetic Survey units should occupy the principal or controlling station, while the engineer units were· assigned to stations that required to be occupied for only 13 or 26 hours. .Severnl additional barges were afterwards furnished by the United States Engineers to take the place of the Const and Geodetic Survey launches. The cooperative assistance of the engineers was.di!3contlnued August 17, after the completion of the observations In the Hudson Rlve1· and Lower Bay. The original program provided that each p:urenu should operate three units, but after the completion of the. wox:k on the Hudson ,Rh:er the Const and Geodetic f;lurvey operated not less than four units, and after August 17; ~ot less than five nnd sometimes six .l,lllits.

'£hlrteen hours' observations were made from the bridge spanning Newton Creek. While the work was In progress most fuvorn\)le weather conditions were experienced. . · · · The observations were continuous from the beginning of the season on July 15 until the close of the work on September 7, except when minor repairs were being made to the current met;ers and on five occasions when the observing barges were struck by passing tows. Rov.gh weather was encountered while the work was ln progress off Sandy Hook, and the observations.In that locality were not as satisfactory as could be desired. These unsatisfactory results are partly due to the floating equipment which was found not adaptable to offshore work. After completing the orlglno.l program nine additional stations were occupied in the Hudson River for the purpose of m,aklng a study of the directions of the subsurface currents. Seventy-eight stations were occupied for obtaining data In connection with circulation nod 30 stations for obtaining data for local conditions. The locutions of the current stations were plotted on appropriate charts which were sent to the office with the records of the work. All tidal data to be used in connection with the reduction and tabulo.tlon of observations, with one exception, were furnished by the records of automatic tide gauges located throughout the harbor and maintained by the engineers. While the work was in pro~ress the Coast and Geodetic Survey maintained an automatic tide gauge at Port Newark in Newark Bay. At only one station nenr tbe barge office were daylight observations made on tide staffs. The United States Army Engineers, besides eft'ectlvel..v cooperating in the work, incidentally rendered valuable assistance in !llany ways.

The officers were engaged in work upon the records of the past season. On July 17, repairs being finished and supplles taken on board, the vessel ran to Martinez at the entrance to Suisun Bay. The work was then continued in Carqulnez Scralts and Suisun Bay in compliance with Instructions. The triangulation was continued eastward from where it had been dropped before going to San Francisco. It was t'ed to two recovered stations on the west side of Suisun Bay, namely, Goodyear and Army Point 2. The dis· crepancy of the connection was seven-tenths meter, or 1 in 4,500 In distance .and 30 seconds In, azimuth. The office value of the llne Army Point to Goodyear was used to carry the scheme east and north across Suisun Bay. This scheme was tied onto two old stations on the eastern end of the bay.

'A new method of referencing subsurface marks was used wl;lere surface marks· could not be established with assurance of their. not being disturbed. Two 8.-foot sections of 2 or ~· foot galvanized pipes were filled with. cement and buried at the same depth as the subsurface mark, one on each side, to form a straight llne. The general direction of this pipe was given in the description. Hence, in recovering the statigr;i a tren~. of the required depth can be dug at right angles to the line of pipe and extended until the pipe, or core of cement, if the pipe has corroded away, ls encountered. Then, by following along the pipe the station mark can be found. . The bromide copy of the original plane-:table sheet :was used to revise the topographic features of Carquinez Straits, but this method proved unsatisfactory, llnd consequently.a projection was made for each of the-remaining sheets and used in the field. ·All of the work was done on the scale of 1: 10,000.

This abstract covers field worlc accomplished along the coast of California during the period November 1, 1922, to February 20, 1928. Two days at the beginning, of this period were ut!Uzed In running two lines of reconnaissance hydrography between the port of San Pedro, Calif., and Catalina Island to obtain the desired information requested by the Paciflc Telegraph & Telephone Co.. to enable them to lay a submarine cable. Upon the completion of this work the Pioneer returned to San Diego and made the necessary preparations to take up hydrographic surveys along the southern California coast from the Mexican boundary northward in conjunction with the party on the steamer Disooverer. ·. The commanding officer Q.,f the Discoverer, Lieut. Commander H. A. Seran, had general charge of the field operations of both vessels. In dividing the work between the two ships the Pioneer was assigned the greater part of the inshore areas, including portions of Slln Diego Bay. Tbe survey of Cortez Bank, 100 miles offshore, was executed jointly by the two vessels. Only a very small amount of new control was needed, as there were in the vicinity of the work numerous artificial and natural objects which had already been located by triangulation. During the months of November and December :avorable weather was encountered and excellent progress made. Decidedly unfavorable conditions, however, were experienced while making the survey . of Cortez Bank, which permitted very llttle wire-drag work. A thorough hydrographic survey of the bank by means of the lead was accompllshed.

Lake Tahoe Is a large, deep lake covering an area ~f about 200 squ~re tniii~~· and situated at an elevation of about 6,225 feet .above mean sea level on the eastern slope of the Slei:ra Nevada Mountains at about the tlllrty-ninth.parallel of latitude. · The locallty is famed as a su'mmer resort. . A launch belongll}g to the U. S. Reclamation Service, the Mount. [lose, was obtained for the use of the. party. Actual field work was begun.

Four' s.upplementar~, tr~.ai;igulatlon stations or the, " triapgulatlon .·11-~ong tlu~ thirty-ninth parallel " were recovered, -namely, Deadman 1893, F.olsom Peak 1893; · Rublcojl. · ~olbt' 189~, . ai;id .9bliil,lrya~ory ,l'oJpt .l-~93; The :first_ three were held. a:s a fixed base triangle from which ·a secondary scheme: of l l stations was extended north and south embracing the whole area the· lake; Frou1 these 11 stations about. 90 intersection statlons ..were cut· [n ·with the theodolite by single cuts from 3 or more stations for use as hydrographlc signals. All secondary stations were well marked and described by this party, as were also. 7 of the intersection stations. Upwards of 30 of the remaining intersection' stations are permanent. nrtlficlai objects, such ·as flagpoles, gables, cupolas, und towers·of, bulldlngs, aids to navigation, etc., and were also described. Particular· care 'Was exercised In· making the· targets of the ·secondary stations small and distinct and in centering and plumbing them carefully. The results snowed plainly that this effort. was wen, expended. The average closing error of 14 triangles in main scheme· was 2.3 seconds and the maximum 6.2 seconds; 101 geodetic positions located; 1 State Une monument ..located; area, 200 square statute mlles.

A :system of· east and west pnrallel llnes was used, although this was varied in the close· Inshore development. Outside of depths of 175 fathoms lines were spaced about three tfl ench statute mile, with soundings. spaced about 600 meters apart along 'the line. From 175 fathoms to 50 fathoms· the spacing is three· lines ·per''statute mile,. with n correspondh;1g. shortening .of the ·sounding interval.

The southern half of this stretch was a .sand beach, and therefore easy of execution; the northern half,. however, was a very rocky and steep-to coast, frequently with high bluffs and overhanging clltfs, which made this part of the work difficult The hydrographlc work was extended alon~ the coast, so that when operations were closed on September 16 hydrography had. been completed from a point about 4 miles north of the entrance to Coos Bay to the entrance to the Coquille River, and included the area from the 1,000-fathom curve to as close to the shore as safety would permit, which, In general, was about the 17-fathom curve. . . Immediately otf Coos Bay entrance the bottom was found. to be very, eveii, and it is believed that the charted results of this suryey will be of assistance to vessels ·making Coos Bay in foggy weather. , From just ·below Cape Arago to the south the bottom was found to be very uneven as far out as the 75-fathom curve, and considerable development work was done In this area in addition to the regular system of sounding lines. Inside the 75-fathom curve soundings were taken with a trolley apparatus with the vessel underway. Outside the 75-fathom curve vertical soundings were taken with the vessel stopped for each sounding.

The Seattle field station, quartered on the second floor of the Burke Building, on the corner of Second and Marion Streets, Seattle, Wash., hns been main· tained in operation throughout the fiscal' year. Among the functions of this field station are the supervision of the standard tide station at Seattle, the maintenance of a chart sales agency, and the gathering and submission to the Washington office of data pertaining to harbor improvements affecting the charts of that district and supplying to the local public such Information as Is requested and proper. In addition this station serves as a connecting link between the Wash· ington office and the surveying parties operating In Alaskan waters.. The station is in a position to assist these parties and to facilitate their work in many ways, among which may be mentioned the purchase nnd forwurding of mess supplies, the forwarding of equipment required by emergency, the recruit· Ing and transportation of men needed for replacements during the field season, assistance in arranging for the necessary repairs to vessels and launches, and the forwarding of mall matter. During the latter part of the fiscal year 10 dory skiffs for the use of surveying parties in Alaska were built in Seattle under the supervision of the Inspector of the Seattle field station.

On September 25 the Discoverer sailed from Norfolk, Va., and after adjusting eompasses In Hampton Roads put to sen on the following day. A stop was made at Kingston, Jamaica, for fresh water October 4, and on October 8 the vessel arrived at Cristobal and on the following day passed through the canal Certain necessary minor repairs were effected at Balboa, and the vessel again proceeded on October 12 and arrived at San Diego, Callf., on October 27. This completed the oceanographic cruise. Certain desirable soundings had been assigned to this vessel along the entire route of the cruise, and although considerable bad weather and unfavorable conditions were encountered the greater part of these soundings were obtained, furnishing much valuable oceanographic data with respect to the route traversed.

The following officers were attnched to this party and assisted in the oceanographic work: Lieut. K. T. Adams, executive officer, Lieut. 0. S. Reading, navigating officer, Lieut. (Junior Grade) J. A. Bond, Ensign A. H. Wagener, D. E. Morris, chief engineer, D. W. Taylor and C. F. Meyer, deck omcers, and Dr. I. B. Hunt, surgeon (temporary). Incident to the cruise of the steamer Pioneer from the Atlantic coast to ·1lbe Pacific coast station, via the Panama Canal, a program of oceanographic work was assigned, supplementing that accompllshed by various other Coast Sutivey vessels on similar cruises. This program was carl"ied out in so far as weather conditions permitted. The conditions met with were unusually favorable, anl] the results obtained are valuable additions to the oceanographic knowledge of the route traversed. The Pioneer sailed from Norfolk, Va., on September· 28, passed through the canal on October 6, salled from Balboa on October 12, and arrived at San Diego, Calif., October 30. One of the features of the work was a search for the bank reported 20 miles north of ¥anzanillo Point. The Pidnee1· ran three llnes of soundings over the reported position of the bank, but no indication of the same was found. The soundings showed n smooth, gently sloping bottom of about 1,100 fathoms depth. In general but little current was experienced on the voyage, but on two occasions narrow belts of strong current were encountered, the first case being off the coast of Costa Rica, where the ship was set to the northeast about 20 miles in 12 hours. Tide rips were observed all around, and it is probable that this current reached 2.5 knots at its maximum. Once out of this belt little or no current was noticed until south of the Gulf qf California, where In longitude 105° W. n strong set to the south was observed. During this voyage the steamer Discoverer was about one day's steaming ahead of the Ptoneer, and the former vessel encountered continuous fnvornble current which the Pioneer did not experience. The llnes of soundings laid out for the Pioneer· passed directly over a 70fathom sounding o1f the coast of Costa Rica, but no signs of any such a feature were found. The soundings ·showed smooth mud bottom at about 1,780 fathoms, and one .sounding, which plotted directly on thll supposed 70-fnthom spot, gave 1,765 fathoms. The Pioneer also determined the position of the Allljos rocks o1f the coast of Lower Callfornln. When the highest rock was first picked up, It appeared as a square rigger under full sail. When approached two more slender pinnacles and one flat-topped ledge became visible.

The oceanographic work covere~ by this abstr'ilct was incidept to the transfer of the steamer Lyaonia froµl .the Pacific coast station to work on the Atlantic.coast and was In progress between October 11 and November 30, 1922. On October 11 the steamer Lydonia sailed from San Francisco after swinging ship in the harbor. After a smooth trip, on which no soundings were tll.ken, the Lydonia arrived in San Diego in the morning of October 18. · At San Diego coal sacks were purchased, the crew put up, about 25 tons of coal· In sacks, and this amount of coal lu sacks was stowed op. .!leek. In addition, the coal bunkers were filled by taking aboard about 64 toqs In the bunkers, so that when the Lydonia left San Diego she had ab9ard IfPProxlmately 137 tons of coal. . At 7.43 n. m. on October 18 the Lydonia sailed from San .Diego, and at.p.22 that afternoon stopped for the first sounding. Practically perfect weather was experienced, and all soundings were taken as specified In the instructions until In the evening of October 23 bad weather from the southeastward wns experienced, which, with rnpldly Increasing wind and sea, made It neceesnry to dis· continue soundlng, and In the morning of the 24th It was advisable to enter Manzanillo, Mexico, for shelter In order to conserve coal. On the 25th, the weather having moderated, the J,ydonia soiled from Manzanlllo and resumed the sounding line. All along this const exceedingly hot weatlier was experienced from off Mazatlan, Mexico, and on the stretch· from ManzanlJlo to Salina Cruz It was most uncomfortable aboard the vessel, as what little .breeze· there was was directly nstern. In the afternoon. of October 28. the· 'Lydonia arrlved»at ·Salina Cruz,. Mexico, In excellent condition, nnd found that the coal which ha'd·,b~n;·shlpped.i:froui San Francisco· had 1arrived only a few days previously. : ·After' maklrig11the necessary arrangements the coaling of the vessel commenced at noon on the SOth and was .finished on November l, the ship having taken aboard at that time 87 tons of coal, 30 tons of which was in sucks on deck; this made 109 tons .aboard altogether. · · 0n November 2 the Lydonia left the inner harbor ·of. Snllna Cruz, but on account of n norther blowing anchored In the outer harbor until the next morning, when, the weather apparently having abated, she sailed from cSallna ·Cruz. Soon after leaving the wind again Increased, and with the.llnrge amount of coal. on deck and with the long run ahead,· with coal which burned more rapidly than other. coal which had been used, it was considered beijt:to:hug the shore and not resume the .sounding line, which wns well offshore;:ootit it was ·found that coalenough to make the trip to .Balboa was assured.. , · i.,.,, ·, During the night of the 6th sounding was again resumed and continued untll Balboa was reached on the evening of November 9. With· the exception of the first 24 hours out of Salina Cruz very good weathei: conditions were experienced. At Balboa supplles were received, various small repairs· were made, , :and on November 13 the ship passed through the Panama Canal, arriving at ·Cristo· bal that evening. On the 14th the ship took aboard coal, and on the morning· .of the lGth, after swinging ship lri the harbor, su11ed from the. Canal Zone and commenced sounding on the line specified. Sounding was·contlnued until on the morning of the 16th very heavy weather, with rain and northeast to east gales, wus met with, which continued with slight Interruption until the morning of the 18th, when sounding wos again resumed nod continued unt11 Kingston·was reached late in th.e evening of the 18th. · Coal was taken aboard at Kingston, 47 tons altogether, 15 tons of which were in sacks on deck on ,November 21, and on the morning of the 22d the Lydonia sailed from Kingston and immediately resumed the line of soundings. Excellent weather was experienced all through the Windward Passage, up to abreast· Rum Cay, .when a westerly gale made it desirable to anchor in the lee of Rum Cay. for shelter at about noon of the 25th. · Soundings were taken on all this run from the time the vessel left Kingston until Hum Cny 'vas reached.

Base line, precise: 1 base measured 1l miles In length. .

After the arc of precise triangulation In Puget Sound from Tacoma, Wash., to the Canadian boundary was completed a preliminary computation of the field observations was made. This showed that the length discrepancy between the old triangulation at Tacoma and the next measured base above was too great for precise work. Immediately south of Des Moines, Wash., a base line about 2,400 meters in length was measured between stations Zenith and Launch 2 of the 1921 triangulation. The staking, taping, and leveling of the base were done under v.ery adverse conditions and took from April 11 to April 26. ' After the completion of the base measurement signals were built and observations made at six of the stations of the 1905 and 1921 triangulations and at two new stations Introduced on account of changed conditions and to avoid excessively high signals. These ·observations were made to check up the connection of the new triangulation with the old around Tacoma. The observing was completed May 22. The chief of party was assisted by Dan W. Taylor, signalman, and four , foremen. Ensign A. H. Wagener assisted only during the measurement of the base.

house, nnd at Currituck Sound was connected by a quadrilateral with Currl~ tuck Beach Lighthouse, Grny, and Woodhouse. This work was completed on November 25, and the party moved to Southport, N. C. On November 27 reconnaissance was started for triangulation along the Cape Fear River. This triangulation extended from the line Snow Marsh-Federal Point to the mouth of the river, connecting with several old stations en route; and at the mouth of the river was directly connected In both length nnd azimuth with the trnverse which was run along the coast to the south. The observing for this triangulation was completed on January 13, Hl23. Lieut. (Junior Grade) Herman Odessey was chief of party from December 14 1922 until January 16, 1923, during which time most of this triungulatio'n wa~ completed. Starting from station R ( U. S. E.) of this triangulation, traverse was run along the coast to the southward. On April 19, the date of closing work, this traverse had been completed to Myrtle Bench, S. C. An observed azimµth at the end of the line is the only check on this work, as no connection was made with old stations. 1t is planned to extend this work by traverse and triangulation through Charleston to Beaufort, S. C., thus giving control points along the entire coast of South Carolina. The primary object of this work was to furnish control for the topographic and hydrographic surveys being made along this coast. It was the first attempt to run traverse by modern methods along the coast. From Cupe Henry Lighthouse to Virginia Beach the traverse was run over the electric line of the Norfolk & Southern Hailroad, but all the rest of the traverse was run directly along the beach. , In general, the usual traverse methods were used; stakes were driven for the support of the tape and the ends of the tape marked by pins. It was found that small tripods about 18 inches high were very useful ·in crossing inlets where there was a wide tide flat and also along the beach 'where the truck could be driven at low tide. However, tripods could be used only under ideal conditions, and stakes are better for general use. Considerable time was saved in leveling over the stakes and ,tripods by using a rod graduated in meters on one side und feet on the other. Readings were taken In both feet and meters instead of running a double line of levels. All observations at main scheme stations were made at night with an 8-lnch direction instrument. '.rwo automatic ]amps were used on part of the work and found to be very satisfactory. Inlets too wide to traverse across at low tide \Vere crossed by triangulation. Transportation was furnished by motor truck, supplemented by a hired launch. At some places the beach at low tide formed an almost perfect driveway, but at other places there was quicksand In which the truck would stick. Great difficulty was experienced in getting the trucks across the inlets, and at some places they could not be U!iled at all. Their depreciation was very high, as driving them through salt water and soft sand was very bad on tires, gears, etc. The party lived In tents and abandoned houses. The chief of party was assisted by Lieut. (Junior Grade) W. H. Overshiner, Ensigns E. B. Roberts and E. P. Morton; G. H. Dell, junior engineer; W. J. J3ilby, signalman ; and J.

SUMMA.ltY OF REBULTS.-Elghteen gravity stations occupied.

On July 1, 1922, Lieutenant Joekel was making observations at the first station of his season's work at Wilkins Well, Kans. After completing three more statl9ns in Kansas he moved his party by truck to southern Oklahoma, where he occupied six stations. The remaining eight stations of the season are located In Texas. All of the 18 stations were selected by the U. S. Geological Survey to test the effect of certain geological formations on the intensity of gravity. Invar pendulums were used throughout the season and were tested by duplicate determinations with the bronze pendulums at several of the stations. Excellent results were obtained. At many of the stations a tent formed the only protection against temperature variations and it would have been Impossible to use the bronze pendulums without constructing constant temperature rooms. At most of the stations the receiver was mounted on an aluminum tripod partly embedded In the ground. This resulted in large flexure corrections, and It is probable that this method of mounting the receiver will be discontinued. ·wireless time signals were used throughout the season. Static conditions interfered seriously with the automatic wireless recording device, especially during the hot summer months. Several changes were made in the receiving set in an attempt to overcome this trouble. . Lieutenant Joekel was assisted by K P. Morton after November 1. The field work was completed early in Jnnuury, 1923. ·

[Ueut. GEORGE D. COWIE.] SUMMARY OF REBULTS.-Latltude and lon~tude: 10 precise latitude stations established; 6 dllferences of longitude (radio) determined. Gravity: 8 gravity stations occupied.

On July 1, 1922, a combined astronomic and gravity party under Lieutenant Cowie was at work In Wisconsin. Near the end of July the party moved by truck to New Mexico and hegnn work there about the middle of August. The main work of the party was the determination of longitudes on the arc of precise triangulation along the one hundred and fourth meridian. Lieutenant Cowie was assisted by E. P. Morton, extra observer, who made the gravity observations. Wireless time signals were used for both the longitude and gravity work and gave very satisfactory results. 'l'he probable errors of the longitude determinations varied from +o.003 to +0.011 seconds, which are smaller than those usually obtained by the telegraphic method. Stntlc conditions were especially bnd in New Mexico during August, and electrical storms caused numerous delays throughout the season. Static Interference was most severe about sundown each day and was the smallest in the early morning hours. Considerable experlmentnl work was done with the receiving set during the season and several improvements made. Much Information on the best methods of operation was also obtained. The new lnvar pendulums were used again this season for gravity determinations and proved entirely satisfactory. At many of the stations a tent was the only protection against temperature changes. At several stations where constant temperature rooms were available, the bronze pendulums also were swung to test the lnvar pendulums. · \Vhen the pendulums were standardized at the end of the season the periods obtained differed considerably from the preseason standardization periods. The final results for the gravity stations occupied during the seaij!on, therefore, have not been computed. Field work was completed oa 1 ~ober 31, 1922. rt9rfw

The season's worlc was designed to determine whether or not deposits of nonmagnetic Iron ore could be located by menns of obser\'atlons with mngnetle Instruments. The work was undertaken at the request of Dr. 'V. n. Crane, of the Bureau of Mines. After two weeks spent In preliminary stucTy and standnrdizntion of Instruments at Cheltenham the observer reached Birmingham on July 17; he closed work for the senson on September 30. The work included dip and dip with loaded needle at 34 stations in the brown iron ore district nbout 30 miles southwest of Birmingham; at 10 stations over a deposit of red Iron ore near Red l\lountnln Gap, near Birmingham;· detailed observations of the same kind near a lnrge specimen of red Iron ore and a large specimen of brown Iron ore on the grounds of the .University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. Complete magnetic observatlons were also made ut the old stations at Tuscaloosa and Birmingham and at a 'new station at Birmingham, where further observations were made to determine the constants of the dip circle. ·' The results Indicate that Iron ores of the charncter under Investigation do 1 not produce an effect on the earth's mu '' '!!m large enough to be detected by ordinary magnetic instruments, eYen ·· ,., · the observations are mnde with great care under favorable conditions. ·· · ·

At Folkston declination observations were made. Observations had not been made before at Bushnell, Milton, or Bnrnesvme. The old stations were reoccupied at Mayo and Talln.hassee, but the results at the latter place ind!ca'te that there has been a change In the immediate surroundings since the former observations in 1914.

A small truck was purchased at the beginning of the season and used to transport the observer and his outfit. 'Vhere the stations are not far apart this arrangement res'ults in a material saving of time and money, as the observer is not dependent upon train schedules In getting from place to place nor upon draymen in getting his outfit from express office to observ'ing station. · .A· further saving resulted from the use of n glazed sewer pipe filled with concrete, with one of the regular bronze disks set fiush with the top ·as a station marker.

The routine work of the observatory was continued throughout the year. The magnetograph has been in continuous operation and ve1·y few changes of adjustment have been required. Absolute observations were made once a week (except for three weeks in October, when the observer was 111), scalevalue determinations once a month, and meteorological observations dally. The chronometers were kept rated by means of weekly comparison in Tucl'!on with telegraphic time signals from Mare Island. The seismograph was in continuous operation and 22 earthquakes were. recorded. Some trouble was experienced with lost motion on .the east-west component during the first part of the year, but this was largely ov,ercome.

Satisfactory dip observations could not be made for several weeks in· the first half year because of failure of the ·substitute earth inductor to work properly. After the regular earth· inductor was returned from the office a dip circle was added to the observatory equipment and observations were made with it once a month so that it would be available for use in an emergency. The clock of the. magnetograph recording apparatus is not entirely satisfactory and the instrument will be sent to the office for overhauling as soon as another one ls available. ·The deflection observations for determining the scale values of the variometers have been materially facilitated by placing collars on the .deflection bars to act as stops in setting the deflector at ·the proper distances. · · During the illness of the observer in October the mngnetograph and seismograph were kept In satisfactory operation by his young son.

Zimovia Strait 'vas surveyed from Menefee Inlet to Anita Bay, Including Thoms Place, Olive Cove, and Anita Bay. The narrow part of the strait was surveyed· on· a scale of 1 : 10,000. Nothing new was developed by this survey, as the channel had been shown by the survey of 1916. The least water at the critical part of the channel ts 2 fathoms at mean low low water. There Is a considerable demand for 11 chart of this strait, and it would probably be used by vessels of the type of the· Jefferson, as it shortens the distance between Wrangell and Ketchikan, besides being much better protected than the usual route. The Wenonah used the passage, but only on a flood tide. It would be advisable to drag the 10 ' miles: between .Menefee Inlet and Olive Cove, as there are bowlders on the J>ottom, and something might be discovered which the lead has failed to reveal. 'Tides.-The automatic .tide gauge at Menefee Inlet was continued in operation until the close of the season. In addition, observations were made at one or more auxiliary tide stations whenever hydrography was in progress. . Revision work.-The topography of the water front of Ketchikan and adjacent territory was extensively revised. Many new docks and other improvements were located. . In addition to such work as has been.previously mentioned, the party compiled and submitted desirable coast pilot Information with respe<:t to the locality .of the working grounds ..

Hydrography.-Wlre-drag work .,was completed north to Skagway during the latter part of June .and the party then returned to Juneau and· from the· 1st to the 8th of :ruly was engaged In dragging splits in previous work south of Douglas Island to Stephens Passage. Tlils work was done with the Jaunches while the ship cleaned boiler at Juneau. · Upon the completion of the work mentioned above drag work was started in the southern part of Lynn Canal. From a junction with previous work· off Point Whldbey the drag work was extended south through Lynn Canal to Point Marsden, overlapping previous work at the west end of Saginaw Channel. After being extended as far south as Point Marsden dragging was continued to the westward through Icy Strait and at the end of the season had been extended approximately to a line from Point Sophia to Noon Point, ·Pleasant Island. Several changes in charted depths and three rocks dangerous to navl·gatlon were found in Icy Strait. The decrease of deep-water areas In Icy Strait afforded fewer opportunities to use the sweep, and the progress of the work was slower than In other localities. During the latter part of the season the party covered three splits In :pr~ vlous work near Sall Island in Stephens Passage, and located a rock in Hood Bay reported by the steamer Spokane. A comprehensive attempt to test the depths of the sweep was made during the latter part of the season and considerable valuable information was obtained. · Tidal work.-During the first part of July old bench marks at Juneau were recovered, two new marks established, and all murks connected by spirit levels. An automatic gauge was established at Funter Bay, Lynn Canul, on July 25 and .continued until the end of the season. The old bench mark in this bay was recovered and three new mq.r)!:s .esta.blished, During the latter part of the seaso~ a sfuff gauge was installed. at HoOnlah and connected wl.fQ.'. th,e ol(i .b!!QC!ll mark there. Two new marks were established. · ·· Magnetic ioork.-Twenty-nine shore stations were occupfecl with the compass declinometer after July l, as well distributed as possible in Talya and Chilkoot Inlets, Lynn Canal, and Icy Strait. The ship was swung in Icy Strait just outside Port Frederick on September 29 and the compass decllnometer was tested by observations at Seward Park, Seattle, after the close of the season. Miscellaneous.-The chart agency at Hooniah was inspected by an officer of the party during September. Field work was closed for the season on September 30. After the end of the season the launches Helianthus and Scandinavia were hauled out at the Ketchikan boathouse, the tender being left in the water for use by the station keepers. Piles were purchased and the use of a pile driver obtained to drive eight piles, two for a dolphin off the end of the ways for tying up launches and three on each side of the ways to aid in centering the launches on their cradles when about to be hauled out.

Follow.Ing are the details of the work accomplished:· ~Adolphus 2, the western limit, of the work done hi 1922, triangulation was extended westward to a junction with work done- in 1901, connecting with the old work at stations Damp, Bad, Dash, and False. From this junction practically all the old stations were recover'ed and re-marked '~est to Cape Spencer. Slgrials were built over these_ stat!~_ns and a few 'additional points were located in Cross Sound. -A ·base about·s.1 statute miles long was prepared and measured along the sand and mud flats at Point Gustavus and was connected with the tringulatlon. "·' , After the completion of the above work triangulation was extended Into Port Frederick, starting from the line Scrnggy-Qulll 2 of the 1922 work and continuing through six figures to a point about two-thirds of the distance to the head of the port. · ' ' Wire-drag work ...-From · the western limit of completed work In Icy ·Strait drag work was completed to Lemesurler Island with the exception· of Icy Passage and Gedney Channel.

measured and the observing in the triangulation scheme .was nearly comp~~ted. The topography on the east .side of tlfe bay was nearly done. A hydrograWilc J.·econnaissance had been made and· a ,scheme decided upon for. developing tpe bay and approaches. Ari automatic tide gauge. had been in operation sin~ .lune 22. ; The latitude and longitude of station South Base, which was selected as tl)e ·initial point in the triangulation, was determined by a computation of the three-point problem from angles measured between Mount' St. Elias, Mount Cook, and Mount Seattle, which are from 30 to. 70 miles distant. The distance from South Buse to Mount Elius, 30 miles, was checked by Independent observfl,· tlons. : The azimuth of the base line was determined by eight sets of. observations. Expansion from the base line was made with two good figures in such a way as to include the whole bay. · · ,. . . · . . Topography was done on a scale of 1 : 10,000. Sheets were laid out so. that there was one sheet for each side of the bay and one sheet for the head of the bay. These sheets were completed. The entire shore line of. the '91JY wafl located. very carefully, and .the face of the glacier w.as located by cuts. and tangents. Traverses were run· east and west of the bay to or beyond the limits of the sheets, and the connection. of· the new shore line with that shown on the chart is, excellent. But little contouring is shown on the sheets. .The instructions for the hydrography called for a scale of 1 : 10,000. Prac-. tically nothing was known even of the general depths. . Four well-separated sounding lines curried straight offshore gave ·a .. good idea of the .bar and. channel, and three lines across the bay and one down the center showed what -might be expected there. The water in the parts that would be most:needed.-var;ed:from about 6· to 50 fathoms.

Sounding lines Inside the bay were run straight across. The offshore lines. were run perpendicular to the beach an<l around the spits and the direction of the lines was varied to give the best development. Sounding was done with the hand lead to about 13 fathoms and beyond that with the sounding machine. For hnnd lead work the lines were spaced about 100 ·meters apart; The work on the bar was made as close as practicable under the conditions. In the anchorages the distance between the lines was reduced to GO meters. The inachine sounding lines were spaced 200 meters apart and ·the soundings taken about. 150 meters apart, In general the. bay· ls deep and clear; the bottom l"ising gradually from the· center to 1;he south until the bat· is reacheu and then apparently.· .sloping , . .. ..,. < slowly downward to the greater depths of the sea.

Hydrography.-The inshore .hydrographic sheets were laid out to correspond with the topographic sheets. On the first of these sheets the inshore hydrog· raphy of Portage Bay north of a line extending southwest from Cupe Kanatak has been completed. . ' · · An e2mmination of tl1e vicinity off Anchor Point was made on June 30. Tllls examination. was made on account of a rock or shoal having been reported by Capt. A. 0. Johansen. No depths less than the charted depths were OQ~ tained. This vicinity ls full of tide rips on a flood tide, due undoubtedly to the uneven bottom, and It is possible that these rips gave rise to the suspicion that a shoal existed there. During the period from May 3 to 21 the ship was at Uyak and the personnel was engaged in putting the launch Yukon In commission. TJ\ls. launch had been hauled out on the ways of the Northwestern Fisheries Co. since the fall of 1920. A g.reat deal of work was necessary in putting her in working condition. The entire hull below the water line had to be recalked, considerable ship's carpenter work was necessary about and below decks, and· there was ·a large amount of work In the engine room. , While the Discoverer was at Uyak an automatic tide gauge was establl.s!l_ed on the cannery wharf. A search was made for the bench marks establlsne·d In 1908 in Uyak and on Harvester Island. The two benc~ marks iu Uyak have been destroyed and of the four established on Harvester Island only one could be recovered. Two new bench marks were established on Harvester Island and three marks were established on the Uyak .side in the vicinity of the gauge. The elevations of these new bench marks and the zero of the tide staff ·in connection with the automatic gauge were determined by reference to the; recovered bench mnrk on Hnn·ester Island. In addition to this tidal work, a topographic revision of the wharves at Uyak was made and a sheet showing the new w·harves forwarded to the office ; two bench marks at the Kodiak. ~ining . eo. near the. head of the bay. were recovered and standard disk bench marks installed." ...., ., .... , :! · .. :-~ ..11<';·"·,,

This arc will eventually be extended to the .point where the one hundred and forty-first meridian boundary between Canada ·and Alaska crosses the Yqkon River. There lt will connect with the arc of precise triangulation, now in progress, whlcl1 extends northward from Puget Sound and which Is being done by cooperation between the Geodetic· Survey of Ctmada and U. S. Coast and Geodetic ·Survey. · · The work of the party was very. much delayed by excessive rains, but on an average one station per week wus completed. The observing was' finished on October 4, at station Witna, ut about latitude 02°. Five days were then spent In travel by puck tmin to the rullroud, which was reached on October 10. The party made Its headquarters nt Eklutua, a station on the Alaska Railroad, und cleared the line of brush and tall grass for the measurement of the .base.: 'l'he. clearing of the line took 10 days and the measurement of the base 4 days, the lust taping being done on October 30. The base site is located on the south shore of Knlk Arm on a long grassy fiat at about the elevation of extreme high water. The obse1·vlng was done with an .8-lnch Wanschaff. (No. 2) w:th vertical circle attached. Vertical measures were taken both in the afternoon and night, and it was found that there wae practically nu difference between these verticals.

The routine work of the observatory was cont:nued throughout the year. The magnetograph was kept in cont:nuous and satisfactory overatlon;·no. change of adjustment being made until June 80 and then only to the vertical lnterilltty var:ometer. Absolute obser\·atlons were made once a week,- scale· value determinations once n month, and meteorological observations daily. The scale values remained very nearly constant throughout the year. The chronometers were kept rated by means of time signals received by cable at the local office of the Signal Corps of the Army. The seismograph was in continuous operation except for a short break in March, when it was being cleaned, and 31 earthquakes were recorded. · Late In the ·year arrangements were made for a systematic record of auroras. and of difficulties experienced by rad!O and cable stations In Alaska, but no a,_uroras were obser-ved because of the short nights at that time of year.

The steamer Ranger' and drag fleet consisting of wire-drag launches Marindint. and Mitchell and tender No. 4, continued wire-drag operations In Porto Rican waters during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1923. The wire-drag work accomplished during the period of this report coyers the waters off Culehra Island and Islands to the westward, Gmmpu1;1 Shoals, eas~ and central parts of Vleques Sound, waters along the north coast of Yleques Island and along the southeast coast of Porto Rico, the latter from Cabras Island to Point Quayanes, and ineffective drag areas previously covered; a total of 215 square miles. This, together with the former year's work completely covers Vieques Sound and the passages along the east and southeast coasts of Porto Rico. The shoals found were mostly of small area and of coml formation. A large number of these were discovered along the· southeast coast of Porto Rico and along the north shore of Vleques ISiand west of Port l\lulus. The greater part of Vleques Sound, especially the eastern half of the sound, was found clear of obstructions with a drag set to 60 feet. · The automatic tide gauge at Fajardo. was kept in operation. A subsidiary staft' was established at Port Yabucoa, and the staffs at Ports Arenas, Ensenada Honda, and Culeblta Island were read during the progress of worlc in the respective localities.

[MnfncUc Observer RALPII: R. Boor.Fl.]

The routine work of the observatory was continued. The magnetograph was kept l.Ii continuous operation except for a period of 18 days when the driving clocks of both recording apparatus broke down. As soon as· another rl!-'. cording box was received from the office, these two were sent in for repalrs. There were also minor losses of record Incident to adjustments of the varlometers. The vertical Intensity variometer continued to show a tendency to drift, necessitating periodic changes in adjustment. A new fixed mirror was Installed 'in the horizontal Intensity ·vnrlometer. Absolute observations were made once a week, scale value determinations once a month, and meteorological observations dally. Time was determined once a week by the method of equal altitudes of the sun up t<i the end of May. In that month a radio receiving set was installed and during June the time signals sent out from Arlington were received daily under varying m.eteorologlcal conditions. . The seismograph was In continuous· operation and 15 earthquakes were recorded. Grading was done about the seismograph house to turn away the surface water and the space around the piers was filled with sand. Masts .were· erected to support the radio aerial. One of them was attached to the office building and It was necessary to put additional braces under the east end of the building to insure proper support. · · Necessary repairs were made to the various buildings including new roofing for the three buildings ·housing the instruments. ·A new pier for the galvanometer added to Its efficiency. The cistern was repaired and cleaned out.

The routine work of the observatory was carried on throughout the year. The magnetogruph wus kept In continuous operation, absolute observations were made once a week, scale-value determinations once a month, and meteorological obser.vatlons dally. The chronometers were kept dated by means of time signals sent· out dally by radio from the naval. station· .at .Pearl Barbor. The seismograph was kept in ·continuous operation but portions of the record of the east-west component were lost because of the crowding together of the lines on the seismogram. This trouble was ascribed to the et'l'ect of changes Qf temperature on the instrument or pier and after various experiments it was ellmlnated to a large extent by placing sawdust In the loft· of the seismograph house. During the year 103 earthquakes were recorded. · The magnetograph driving clock was overhauled, repaired, and cleaned, but its rate is not yet entirely satisfactory. The deflection observations for determining the scale values of the varlometers were facilitated by placing collars ~n the Q.eflection bars to act as stops in setting the: deflector nt the proper dls'tailces. A change in the wave length used In sending out tl)ne signals from Pearl Barbor made it necessary to remodel the recelvl.Iig set af'the observatory. After some experiments this was done by Mr. McComb with very satisfactory results.

SPECIAL DUTY.'
S!:COND ANNUA.L MA.BINK EXPOSITION, ,GRAND CENTRAL PALACE, NEW YOBK,. N. Y.

[Commander J.

T.

WATKINS.]

At the second annual Marine Exposition held in the Grand Central Palure, .New York, N. Y., from November 4 to 11, 1922, an exhibit wns made tllustrntive of the field .and office work of the U. s; Coast and Geodetic Survey. As the fund allotted to defray the usual expense of an exhibit of this character was inadequate, the cost of the display was reduced to a minimum. The relatively few items provided were as follows : . · A.complete set of charts bound In 15 bundles of about 45 charts each. Two portable stands, or racks, provided storage for eight bundl~s each and were so arranged that any chart of the en.tire .series could be displayed readily in a.:vertlcal posiUon wlth the. center of the chart a little below the height of t1Je
100 large broinlde prints, illustrating operations and , ment, grouped round small subject signs In the following order; Trla~guln tion, . topography, hydrography, terrest.rlal magnetism, wire drag, tides and currents, and publication. . Dlagram11 and. sketches illustrating methods and results. ., :· A. co,mplete ·me of coast pilots, inside routes, tide and current tables, 11ntl magnetic publications. Special publications and others of recent issue and general interest, including the ephemeri.s, n11utical almanac, Bowditch, and. line of position tables. , . Miscellaneous 'typical charts, progress sketches, lsomagnetic chart.s and dit1grams. . . . Decorations consisting of national ensigns, departmental and bureau flags 11.n.d pennants, and one set of c0de signal flags. . These items, packed for shipment weighed .a little over 1,000 pounds, They left· the office in the afternoon of October 30 and were delivered .by the for· warding express company at the booth in the Grand Central ·palace .o~ 'the forenoon of November 1, 1922. · · ,. · About 100. feet of wall space was provi<led for the ex)llbit. .r' 1 The officer in charge us the representative of the director ga,v:~ ,attention to various matters affecting the other bureaus of the department and rendered assistance when possible.

The exhibit received considerable attention and was the object of intelligent interest and appreciation on the part of many visitors. The New York field station rendered valuable nssistance in installing the materinl in its care nnd attendance nt the booth in packing and shipping the exhibit after the close of the exhibition. 1 The management of the exposition responded readily to numerous requests for labor and material. All business at New York in connection with the exhibit was cloged on November 14, and the officer In charge reported at the office in Washington on the morning of November 15.

SUMMARY OF !tF.SULTS.-I.evPling, mnrks established.
precl~e:

0 miles of

levels

run; 24 permnncnt bench

This work wns done for the purpose of connecting old bench marks, which had been used as tidal reference marks some ·years ago, with the standard bench marks of the precise level net. A number of new bench murks, consisting of a stundnrd tablet, were set in advantageous locutions for the reference of future titlal worlc The work was in the vicinity of the Capitol, nnvy yard, Nntionnl .Museum, Engineers' wharf, Washington l\Ionument, and Key Bridge, and was done at odd times between February 14 and Murch 24, 1923.
·[Lieut. L. 0.
STl:WAllT.)

During the month of DecemlJer, 1022, a plan suney of the grounds of the U. S. Bureau of Standards was malle for the use of that bureau, the survey consisted of detailed topogrnphy locating all buildings, ronds, fences, and the boundary line on u scale of 1 inch to 80 feet. No contouring was done. Control was -obtained In the following manner: A point on top of one of the large bulldings was locuted by trinngulution methods an(l connected to u measured base line. on the grounds. From this lmse line plane table triapgulation was curried over the t>ntire nren suneyell.
AERIAL SURVEYING.
LOUISIANA.

[Lieut. G. C. ;.\lATT1soN.]

Practically the entire time of. tl}e above-named officer throughout the fiscal year has been devoted to currying 011 toward completion the mapping of the l\llsslsslppi River Deltn from the data secured with the aerial surveys of the previous fiscal year. One of the first necessary steps wns the making of over 3,000 prints. 'l'hese were made In the photogrnphic lul.Jorntory of the Navy Department under the direct supervision of Lieutenant Mattison. During the perioll, September 26 to November 12, Lieutenant Mattison was In the field executing n scheme of triungulntion for control of the aerial photographs across the northern portion of the delta. This scheme made triple connection with previous triangulation und completed all control necessary. Whlle stlll In the field, Lieutenant Mattison identified nil the new control points In the photographs. Upon his return to Washington the completion of control computations wus effected. The work of constructing mosaics, transferring the data to topographic sheets and inking the same, and assembling dntu for publication of the results of the survey was then taken up and wus In progress at the end of the fiscal year.
