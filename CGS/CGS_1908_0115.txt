THE REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.
THE WORK OF THE YEAR.
FIELD WORK.

An important feature of the work of the year is the completion of the reconnaissance for the extension of the primary triangulation from the ninety-eighth meridian in central Texas across New Mexico, Arizona, and California to the triangulation of the same class which extends along the Pacific coast across California, Oregon, and Washington. This reconnaissance extends along an arc of the parallel for a distance of nearly 2 ooo kilometers (1 200 miles), and the work was begun and completed during the year. The triangulation when completed will connect with the international boundary between the United States aryd Mexico in many places and will make it possible to replace this boundary exactly in position even if the monuments which now mark the boundary were removed or destroyed. Several detached schemes of triangulation done by the United States Geological Survey will be connected and numerous geographic positions will be determined in the States and Territories through which the triangulation passes. In addition to the importance of the work as a contribution to geographical knowledge it will also furnish important data for a better determination of the figure of the earth. The completion of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian is an interesting feature of the work of the year.. This triangulation now extends across the country from Canada to Mexico and furnishes numerous geographic positions in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The work also forms an important meridional arc which this country has contributed to the International Geodetic Association for the study of the figure of the earth. The extension of this arc in Mexico has made good progress under the patronage of the Mexican Government, and the Dominion of Canada has begun a geodetic survey as a permanent basis for all future geographic and economic s~rveys in which great accuracy is desirable. The principal governments of the world have joined in advancing the work of the International Geode.tic Association for the study of the figure of the earth and other interesting physical problems which concern all mankind more or less directly, and it is most gratifying to know that the Dominion of Canada is following the home country and her other colonies in extending geodetic work gradually over their territory as demanded by their economic development. In this connection it is hoped that the

triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian will be extended northward in the Dominion as rapidly as the economic conditions will admit. It gives me great satisfaction to report this substantial progress in the work of covering the country with fundamental geographic positions which form the base of all geographic maps and may be used in all geographic investigations for the material development and improvement of the country. The work of opening and remonumenting the boundary line between the United States and Canada west of the Rocky Mountains was continued and the monuments were finally inspected and numbered from the summit of the Rocky Mountains to the east side of Lake Osoyoos, a distance of 387 kilometers (242 miles). ·This work is now in progress and will probably be completed during the present year. The work of surveying and remarking the boundary east of the Rocky Mountains was begun north of the State of Montana and similar work was continued and completed north of the State of Vermont. Work on the Maine-New Brunswick boundary was begun and was in progress on June 30. The surveys along the boundary include triangulation and a topographic survey of the region adjacent to the boundary on both sides. The demarcation of the Alaska-Canada boundary in southeastern Alaska has made steady progress whenever the climatic conditions were.suitable, and gratifying progress was made along the one hundred and forty-first meridian. South of the Yukon River, sites for 19 monuments were selected and the line was opened for a distance of 86 kilometers (54 miles). . In this work a representative of the British Commissioner accompanies the United States parties and a representative of the United States Commissioner accompanies the Canadian parties. In connection with the survey of the Alaska boundary along the one hundred and forty-first meridian special attention is called to the fact that the triangulation which is being extended along this meridian, as a fundamental part of the proper demarcation of the line, will furnish geographic positions from ~fount St. Elias to the Arctic Ocean that can be used for all future surveys which the economic development of the region may demand. This boundary is intersected near its center by the Yukon River, one of the great rivers of the world, and its extensive valley has never been surveyed. It is important that provision should be made for the extension of a triangulation from the initial point of the boundary on the one hundred and forty-first meridian near where it crosses the Yukon to its mouth near St. Michaels. Congress has already authorized various economic investigations and surveys in this region and the work is in progress by the United States Geological Survey. A connected line of geographic positions is needed along the Yukon to correlate detached portions of the work mentioned and to form a basis for all future surveys. Work at the latitude observatories at Gaithersburg, Md., and at Ukiah, Cal., maintained by the International Geodetic Association under my direction, was continued during the year. One officer continued on duty as a member of the :VIississippi River Commission and another was continuously employed in cooperation with the Maryland State Board of Shell Fish Commissioners in making a survey of the natural oyster bars and rocks in

the State of Maryland. The work in Somerset County was completed and a report covering the county was prepared. The charts necessary to accompany this report were prepared and published. The triangulation of the city of New York by the corporation under the direction of an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was continued during the year. Astronomic observations to determine latitude, longitude, or azimuth were made in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. The standard levels were extended in Montana, Nevada, and Utah. A careful search was made for a shoal reported by the steamship ;.VJ ongolia as existing 17 miles southwesterly from the Farallon Light-house, and it was shown that no shoal exists in the position indicated. Topographic surveys were made along the shores of Chesapeake Bay and adjacent waters, along the shore of Juan de Fuca Strait from New Dungeness to Crescent Bay, and in Puget Sound from Skagit River to Deception Pass. Two additional connections were made between the primary triangulation along the Coast Range of mountains in Oregon with the tertiary triangulation along the coast, and this work was in progress on June 30. Incidentally the geographic positions of all recent aids to navigation in the region covered by ·work were determined. The recovery of old triangulation stations witn supplementary triangulation, including the determination of the geographic positions of aids to navigation, was continued on the coast of Connecticut, North Carolina, and Florida. Hydrogi:aphic examinations with a long wire drag were continued on the coast of Maine and in the vicinity of Key West, Fla. A supplemental survey was made of Georges Bank and Shoal, in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Massachusetts, and hydrographic work was continued in Chesapeake Bay. The offshore hydrography along the north coast of the island of Porto Rico was practically completed. The collection of information necessary for a revision of the Coast Pilot volume covering the coast of the Gulf of Mexico from Key \Vest to the Rio Grande was completed in the field and a revised edition was published. Similar information was collected for a revised edition of the Coast Pilot volume covering the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington. The magnetic survey of the country was continued by making observations in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, :\faryland, :!\fichigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Porto Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. A continuous record of the changes in the earth's magnetic condition was obtained with self-registering instruments at magnetic obserYatories iocated at Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Sitka, Alaska; Honolulu, Hawaii, and Vieques, P. R.

IO

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1908.

Continuous records with seismographs were also obtained at these observatories, except at Baldwin, Kans., where there is no seismograph. Meteorological observations were made in connection with the regular wo~k. Magnetic observations were made at sea, in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, on board the vessels of the Survey on their voyages to and from their field of work. Self-registering tide gauges were maintained at the following stations: Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Baltimore, Md.; Fernandina, Fla.; Weeks, La.; Galveston, Tex.; San ,Diego, Cal.; Presidio of San Francisco, Cal.; Seattle, Wash., and Honolulu, Hawaii. In January a gauge was established at Wilmington, N. C. The tide indicators at Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Reedy Island, Delaware River, Delaware, and Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Bay, California, have been continued and the electric tide indicator in the rooms of the Maritime Association of New York continued to give satisfaction. A similar apparatus in the Bourse Building, at Philadelphia, was discontinued, as it was found to be impracticable to operate it after the overhead wires, which had been used, were removed by the city authorities.
AI.,ASKA.

The survey of Iliamna Bay, Cooks Inlet, was completed and surveys were made of Chiniak and Marmot bays, and Kupreanof Strait, Kodiak Island. Topographic work was done in the Barren Islands, off the entrance to Cooks Inlet, and the triangulation in this vi~inity was continued. In Prince William Sound a survey was made along the west shore of Knight Island. Triangulation was extended along the west side of Prince of Wales Island, connecting the work in Summer Strait and in Cordova Bay. A topographic reconnaissance was made along the channels used in extending the triangulation. A reconnaissance of Dixon Entrance for triangulation was completed and observations were made at several stations. The work on the Alaska-Canada boundary and at the magnetic observatory at Sitka was continued and is referred to elsewhere in this report. The information necessary for a revision of the Coast Pilot volume covering the coast from Dixon Entrance to Yakutat Bay and for the preparation of sailing directions covering the coast from Yakutat Bay to Cooks Inlet was collected in the field.
PHILIPPINg ISLANDS.

Gratifying progress was made in the important work of charting the waters of the archipelago, and the results of the field work were promptly made available in the form of drawings for charts, which were forwarded to Washington for review and publication. The statistics of the work done during the year show that the triangulation covered 13 800 square miles and the hydrography 9 600 square miles. A topographic survey was made along 1 573 miles of general coast line. The Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Pathfinder and insular government steamers Fathom.er, Romblon, Marinduque, and Research were engaged in the work, and in addition to the parties afloat several parties living on land were also at work. The expenses of the work were divided between the United States Government and the insular government in accordance with the agreement under which the work was done in previous years.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

Survey work was done in the following localities during the year: East coast of Luzon.-On the east and west coast of Polillo Island and on the main land opposite the island; in Lamon Bay; along the coast between St. Miguel Bay and Maqueda channel, and along the whole coast of Cantanduanes Island. North and east coasts of Samar.-Between San Bernardino Strait and Laguan and from Napia Bay to and around Point Sungi, the southeast point of the island. West coast of Leyte.-On the west coast of Biliran Island and along the west coast of Leyte to the Camotes Islands. . East and west coasts of Cebu.-From the north point of the island along the east coast to the vicinity of Borbon and along the west coast to the vicinity of Tuburan; also on the west coast from the south point of the island to Point Gorda. North coast of Mindanao.-Along the west shore of Iligan Bay. North, east, and west coasts of Negros.-Along the north coast of the island; in the Strait of Tanon from the south end to the vicinity of Guijulugan, and along a portion of the west shore of Guini.aras Strait. North, east,_ and west coasts of Panay.-From Capiz around to the vicinity of Concepcion and along the whole of the west coast. The connection of the islands of Panay, Masbati, Negros, Cebu, and Leyte by triangulation was completed. Tide observations were made in connection with the hydrographic work, and a continuous tide record was obtained with self-registedng gauges at Manila and Iloilo. The. organization of the work in the Philippine Islands remains unchanged, except that the personnel is increasing in respon~e to the demands upon the suboffice for infor- . mation and for the prompt issue of charts. The suboffice performs all the work necessary for chart construction, and drawings for new charts and new editions are prepared and sent to Washington for completion and publication. New editions of the sailing directions for the islands are prepared as tpey become necessary, and a monthly Notice to Mariners was issued.
OFFICE WORK.

In the Office the current work was kept up to date and progress was made in the various branches of the work, including computation, plotting, and discussion of results of field work, and the preparation of the data for publication by chart or otherwise. Gratifying evidence of the continued usefuless of the work of the Bureau is afforded by the numerous requests received for information from its archives. A great deal of information has been published and is distributed in printed form, and it is the policy of the Survey to print data as rapidly as it can be prepared for publication. The computation of the results of the investigation of the earth movements in the California earthquake of 1906, as shown by triangulation, was completed and an exhaustive report was prepared and published in the Annual Report,. The computation of the main scheme of triangulation. along the ninety-eighth meridian was completed fr::;m northern Nebraska to the Mexican boundary. The United States standard datum was extended through the main scheme of triangulation southward from Port Royal, S. C., along the coast and around Florida to Mobile, thus making numerous geographic positions in this region available for use in this final form.

COAST A!'ID GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1908.

A volume was prepared for publication under the title "United States Magnetic Tables and Magnetic Charts," which gives the results of magnetic observations previous to January 1, 1908, reduced to the epoch January 1 , 1905. The tables and charts contain better values than heretofore published for the three elements of terrestrial magnetism in the United States at numerous stations covering the country. . Tide tables containing the predicted tides for numerous ports on the coasts of the United States and in foreign countries were prepared and published. Tables of the predicted tides for Wellington and Auckland, New Zealand, were furnished to the New Zealand authorities, upon reqµest, in advance of publication. The Manual of Tides, an exhaustive treatise on the subject, was completed during the year, and the concluding part was published in the Annual Report. The Annual Report of the Survey for 1907 was prepared. for transmission to Congress. Several interesting appendices were published as a part of the report. These include an account of the earth movements in the California earthquake of 1906, as measured by the trigonometrical work of the Survey, an account of the successful use of nickel steel or invar tapes in the measurement of primary base lines, and a detailed account of a long wire drag which has been constructed and successfully used by the Sunrey in definitely determining whether dangers to navigation escaped detection when hydrographic surveys have been made by the usual method of sounding. The amount appropriated for the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1908, was $991 290, of which $245 ooo was for manning and equipping the vessels of the Survey, $40 ooo for repairs and maintenance of vessels, and $50 ooo for office expenses. The remainder of the appropriation was divided between expenses of parties in the field ($320 400) and salaries of field and office forces ($335 890). In addition to the above sums, the appropriations for marking the United States and Canada boundary and for locating and marking the Alaska boundary, made to be expended by the Secretary of State, are disbursed under my direction, as Commissioner, by the Disbursing Agent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey as special disbursing officer of the Department of State.

J. J. Gn.. BER'r, Inspector.
The routine work in connection with the enlistments of crews for the vessels and the administrative examination of the accounts of the vessels was kept up to date. Numerous short trips were made by the Inspector in connection with the repair and maintenance of the surveying vessels.
COAST PILOT.

1;he work in the Office included the preparation of the following publications: Supplements to United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Co~st, Parts IV and VII; United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VIII; United States Coast Pilot, Pacific Coast, Alaska, Part I, and Coast Pilot Notes, Yakutat Bay to Cook Inlet. Proof of these publications was read, except the last two, which were not completed at the close of the year.
THE VESSELS AND THEIR WORK.
'!'HE S'I'EAMER BACHE.

At the beginning of the year this vessel was at Baltimore completing repairs and outfitting for the next season's work. She left Baltimore on July 8 for Georges Bank, off the coast of Massachusetts. She reached Boston on July 12 and began work on the 16th. The work assigned included a resurvey of Georges Shoal and .a system of lines to be sounded extending approximately southward from the general crest of the bank to the 50-fathom curve. The soundings covered that portion of the bank east of longitude 68° 30'. Tide observations were made by using a manometer. The work closed September 28, and examinations were then made for reported dangers to navigation in Buzzards and Narragansett bays and off New London, Conn. The vessel reached Baltimore in November, and necessary repairs were made. On January 6 the vessel sailed for Porto Rico, and on the next day, in a sudden and violent squall, she dragged her anchor in Hampton Roads, Va., and collided with the hospital ship Jamestown, resulting in serious damage to the Bache, which necessitated repairs at Norfolk. She sailed for Porto Rico on March 16 and reached San Juan on April 3. The hydrographic work off the north and west coasts of the island of Porto Rico was practically completed, and the vessel sailed for Baltimore on May 30. Repairs were being made to the vessel on June 30.
'l'HE S'r:SAlllER HYDROGRAPHER.

This vessel was engaged in coast pilot work in the Gulf of Mexico at the beginning of the fiscal year. · The work was completeti and the vessel returned to Baltimore early in September. In June repairs were made, and the vessel sailed for New London, Conn., on June 21, and was on coast pilot work at the close of the year.

HAYFORD,

Inspector.

The duties of the Inspector were performed at the Office in Washington, except as noted below, where the records of the field parties were examined as they were received from the field, and an effective supervision of the work was maintained in this way. A visit was made to a party engaged in making astronomic observation and the work was found to be making rapid progress. The triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian was completed. The most important event of the year in the field work was the completion of a reconnaissance for primary triangulation from northern Texas to California, a distance of more than 1 200 miles. This involved the selection of 92 primary and 38 secondary stations. The work conformed admirably to the specified requirements for primary triangulation and is a very remarkable accomplishment, even when the very favorable conditions encountered are taken into consideration.

Observations were made on the Atlantic Ocean along the north Atlantic coast of the United States, on Georges Bank, and on special courses to and from Porto Rico. Observations were also made at sea along the coast of Alaska. OFFICE OF DISBURSING AGENT.
ScoTT NESBIT, Disbursing Agent.

The Disbursing Agent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has charge of all of the appropriations made for the service, and the appropriations made to the State Department for the survey and marking of the boundary between the United States and Canada and of the boundary between Alaska and Canada. The extremely wide field of work covered by these appropriations compel payments to be made in all parts of the United States proper and in the most remote regions of the possessions under the jurisdiction of the United States, especially in Alaska, Porto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippine Islands. The services of more than 70 bonded chiefs of party are required to make these payments at the remote points occupied by the working parties of this Survey, both on land and sea. All of the public funds used by these officers are advanced from the central Disbursing Office of the Survey, and the resulting bookkeeping and auditing are done in that office. Necessarily a very extensive line of correspondence results, as, in addition to all pay and salary accounts, the manning, equipping, outfitting, and repairing of the vessels of the Survey, the purchase and sale of clothing and small stores, the system of allotments made by seamen and other employees, and the entire expense of the field work of the service, which is both extensive and varied, and the survey and marking of the two boundary lines mentioned, are financed entirely from the central Disbursing Office. The above-mentioned chiefs of party are bonded in the sums of from $2,ooo to $10,000 each, and while acting as chiefs of party these officers receive from time to time such advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent as are approved by the Superintendent and are required to meet the necessary current expenses of the work in hand. A ledger account is kept in the office of the Disbursing Agent, with each chief of party receiving an advance made to him, and in which such sums are charged and in which he is given credit for all proper expenditures made by him, when presented on regularly supported vouchers, after such accounts have been audited in the office of the Disbursing Agent, found to be correct, and approved by the Superintendent of the Survey. All of these accounts, after they have received the administrative examination required by law in the Office of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, are, with their supporting vouchers, sent through the Department of Commerce and Labor to the Auditor for the State and other Departments for examination and audit by him. This system has met the needs of this Survey and results, in the main, in economy and good order in its expenditures. A very large proportion of the appropriations named is now being expended in the survey of the most remote waters of Alaska and the Philippine Islands, and, in the survey and

The selection of a more suitable location for the self-registering tide gauge at Galveston was assigned to Assistant Beck. He made a careful inspection of the water front and located the gauge on the wharf at the foot of Twentieth street, on the property of the Galveston Wharf Company. The officials of the company facilitated the work by extending all the aid in their power, and the Survey acknowledges their kindness in permitting the use of their wharf free of charge. A small house was erected to protect the gauge, and the tide staff was connected by leveling with three old bench marks and two new ones which were established in the vicinity. In connection with the work mentioned above, topographic details were collected and revised by personal inspection for the purpose of bringing the chart of the harbor up lo date by adding the improvements made since the last survey was made. The work of this party began on April 10 and was completed on April 23.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1908.

The completion of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian in Minnesota from the vicinity of Stephen to the United States and Canada boundary was assigned to Assistant Bowie. The work began on July 1, and was completed on the 31st. Observations were made at 9 triangulation stations in 19 days (July 5 to 23). Two of the stations in this triangulation ai:e on the United States and Canada boundary, and each of these is near a boundary monument which was connected with the station. After completion of the work in Minnesota, Assistant Bowie made preparations for a reconnaissance from the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian in the vicinity of Weatherford, Tex., across Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California, to a junction with the Pacific coast triangulation. The work in Texas began on August 25, under Mr. Bowie's direction, and he took personal charge of the party on September 24. The selection of stations began on September 17, 1907, and continued without interruption until February 8, when the last station was located. The party consisted of one man and a driver, besides the chief. The route follows the Texas Pacific Railway to El Paso, and thence along the Southern Pacific to California. The officials of these twt> companies greatly facilitated the work by their courtesy in authorizing the party to obtain water at the railway water tanks. The actual time occupied by the field work was 4 months and 21 days. During this period the locations of 92 primary and 38 secondary stations were selected, covering ·a distance of 1 224 miles along the axis of the main triangulation. Arrangements were made for 5 connections with the monuments or triangulation stations along the United States and Mexican boundary and one connection with the triangulation along the California-Nevada boundary, and these subsidiary schemes amounted to a total distance of 79 miles. Two base lines were selected and connections with the main scheme were provided for. A number of triangulation stations established by the United States Geological Survey were used in the main scheme. The average length of the lines east of Sierra Blanco, Tex., is 17 miles and west of that place 62 miles, and the longest line is 151 miles long, while many of the stations have elevations from 3 ooo to 11 ooo feet above sea level. Many of the conditions under. which the work was done were favorable, but the work is remarkable for the rapid progress made and for its small cost. The report on the work is unusua~ly complete and interesting. After the completion of the reconnaissance a signal building party was organized in Texas under Mr. Bowie's direction with a signalman in charge, and signals were erected at the triangulation stations (36 in number) in the region between the vicinity of Gordon, Tex., and Midland, Tex. This work began on February 17 and was completed on May 31. In May Mr. Bowie selected a station for use in determining the telegraphic longitude of Detroit, and then made observations to deter~ine the latitude and an azimuth at 4 stations in the triangulation of the Great Lakes by the United States Lake Survey. Two of these stations were in Michigan, 1 in Indiana, and 1 in Illinois. This astronomic work was in progress on June 30. Magnetic observations were made at the 4 stations mentioned above.

The work of the magnetic observatory at Cheltenham, Md., was continued without interruption during the year. A continuous record of the relative force of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism was obtained and observations to determine absolute values for the three elements were made at regular intervals. A special building was constructed for seismograph observations, and the instrument was transferred to this building on October 5. It is now possible to maintain a high degree of sensitiveness in both components of the seismograph, and excellent results have been obtained. Twenty·four earthquakes were recorded during the year, and an investigation of the micro-seismic tremors recorded by the seismograph in connection with barometric pressure shows that a relation exists between the occurrence of these tremors and the passage of low barometric areas over the coast line. ·During the year observations were made to determine the value of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism at the stations named above by observers detailed to work under Mr. Burbank's direction. Various instruments were compared with the observatory standards for use in the field work and for the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution, of Washington.

Several of the stations occupied for observations were old triangulation stations, and delay occurred in transporting the instrumental outfit to these stations. Unfavorable weather also caused considerable delay. In connection with the work, a search was made for 34 old triangulation stations, and 25 were recovered. In California work was done on Catalina, San Clemente, and San Nicolas islands. Local triangulation was done at several stations to make a connection with the old work in cases where a triangulation was not occupied. This work covered an aggregate area of 400 square miles, with 24 stations occupied and 39 geographic positions determined.

The topographic survey of the unsurveyed portion of the south shore of Juan de Fuca Strait was assigned to Assistant Dibrell. The Explorer sailed from Seattle on November 19 and returned on February 20. During this period several old triangulation points were recovered and some new ones . were established. A topographic survey was m~de of Dungeness Spit, and the survey was extended to Port Angeles and westward to include Crescent Bay. Between Freshwater and Crescent bays the coast is rocky and abrupt and landing is impracticable, except when there is very little swell. This portion of the coast was surveyed by using a sextant instead of a plane table. The magnetic work includes one swing of the ship on 16 headings, with both helms off New Dungeness and observations on shore at Dungeness, Port Angeles, and Striped Peak. Assistant Dibrell was absent on leave from November 24 to January 3, and during this period Assistant Quillian was in command.

The completion of the connection of the Weather Bureau station at Mount Weather, Va., with the primary triangulation in the vicinity was assigned to Assistant Fairfield. He began work on July 17 and completed the observations on September 27. During this period observations of horizontal angles were made at. 3 triangulation stations, and observations to determine an azimuth were made at Mount Weather and the triangulation and astronomic stations were connected. The weather was very unfavorable and caused great delay in the work. On November 23 the work of recovering old stations on the west coast of Florida in Tampa Bay and vicinity was begun and continued until June 23, when the work was closed for the summer. During this period a search was made for So old stations and only 6 recovered. These old stations were used, and a new triangulation was extended over Tampa, Hillsboro, Boca Ceiga, and Sarasota bays. The positions of prominent objects in Tampa, Port Tampa, St. Petersbu;g, Palmetto, Braidentown, and on Mullet and Egmont keys were determined; also the positions of 16 aids to navigation (lighted beacons) and of 23 triangulation stations established under the direction of the Corps of Engineers, United States Army, in their work for the improvement of Tampa Bay. Observations were made at 49 stations during the season, 6 of these being old stations, 1 I° United States Engineer stations, and 32 new stations.

An examination was made of the triangulation along the Cape Fear River in North Carolina between Wilmington and the mouth of the river, the work of the Corps of Engineers, United States Army, in connection with the improvement of navigation in the river. The river triangulation was in two sections. Observations were made at stations in order to join the sections and to connect the triangulation with the geographic positions already established at Wilmington by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. A similar connection exists near the mouth of the river. The work was done while Assistant Granger was in charge of the tide station at Wilmington (January 25 to May 15).

[N. H. HECK.]

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Fifty-three square miles of area covered with drag, 846 miles run while dragging, 413 soundings made, 163 shoals located, 12 tide stations occupied, and 8 hydrographic sheets completed.·

Hydrographic examinations were made in various localities during the year with long wire drags under the direction of Assistant Heck. On July 8 work began on the coast of Maine and was continued in Jericho Bay between Spirit Ledge and Eggemoggin Reach until October 29. Seventeen square miles were covered with the drag and 28 shoals were located at depths ranging from 15 to 36 feet. In the region covered there is very little open water, and it was impracticable to use a drag longer than 600 feet. The strong tidal currents and numerous "lobster pots" used by the fishermen engaged in this industry, in this locality, increased the difficulty of operating the drag and the cost of the work by the delays resulting from the necessity of having these "pots" temporarily removed by their owners. In August (26-30) an examination was made of Sugar Reef Passage, Fishers Island Sound, Conn., by a section of the party, and 2 shoals were located. Pulpit Harbor, Maine, was examined in September, and l shoal was located. The work also shows that a reported shoal in this harbor does not exist. In October (1-31) the examination was extended through Merchants Row to Isle au Haut Bay, covering 6 square miles of area and locating 14 shoals. After the close of the season in Maine the parfy was divided into two sections. One of these made an examination in the vicinity of City Island, N. Y., where l square mile of area was covered and 14 shoals were located. The other examined an area of one-fourth of a square mile in the vicinity of Coal Mines Buoy No. l 6, in Narragansett Bay, R. I., and located 2 rocks, on one of which a vessel had struck. . The work closed for the season in the north on November 16, and similar work was taken up at Key West, Fla., on December 18 and continued until May 26. The area examined, 19 square miles, extends from the Southeast Channel to a line joining red buoy No. 8 and West Crawfish Key, and more than 100 shoals were located within these limits. Two shoals supposed to exist could not be found with the drag, and consequently they have been removed from the number of dangers to navigation.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1908.

A few geographic positions were determined for hydrographic purposes and an effort was made to recover a number of old triangulation stations on the keys to the east of Key West. Topographic details were secured in the vicinity of Key West for the purpose of revising the chart covering this locality. Wire-drag work on the coast of Maine was resumed on June 26 and was in progress on June 30.

(J. S.

HILL.]

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Reconnaissance: 2 6oo square miles of area covered and 53 triangulation stations selected. Triangulation: 2 300 square miles of area covered, 57 stations occupied, and 79 geographic positions determined.

On July 1 a party was in the field under Mr. Hill's direction, with a foreman in charge, opening lines and preparing the stations so that the observations could be made without delay by an observing party, and this work was continued during the month of July. During the period August 1 to September 22, 18 triangulation stations were occupied and SS geographic positions were determined in the interior. The primary triangulation along the mountains of the Coast Range was connected with the triangulation along the seacoast in two places, at Port Orford and at Cape Sebastian, and the geographic position of Cape Blanco light-house was determined. The triangulation work was completed on September 22 and preparations were made for reconnaissance work along the coast from the vicinity of Umpqua River northward. The work began at Myrtle Point, so miles south of Umpqua River, and was extended to Tillamook Bay, a distance of about 130 miles. Stations were selected for the purpose of determining the geographic positions of the light-houses at Umpqua River, Heceta Head, Yaquina Head, Cape Meares, and Coquille. River. The work closed for the season on November 23. The work of recovering old triangulation stations and doing supplementary work on the coast of North Carolina was begun on January IO and was continued until April l S· During this period 71 old stations along Beaufort Inlet and Core and Bogue sounds were searched for, 21 of which were recovered and 32 determined as destroyed. A search was also made for IO tidal bench marks, and s of these were recovered. Additional reference bench marks were established in 4 of these localities. Twenty-four new stations were established and occupied, in addition to several old ones, and the geographic position of Harbor Island Bar light-house was determined. Triangulation stations now exist along practically the whole distance examined. Work was resumed on the triangulation along the coast of Oregon on May lS, when a party began preparing the stations, opening lines, etc. On May 26 an additional party was organized to make observations, and in June 7 stations were occupied. The work of both parties was in progress on June 30.

The work began at Las Vegas, Nev., and was completed to the vicinity of Sahara, Utah, over the route of the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. The party lived in an "outfit box car," which was hired for the purpose, as the country traversed afforded nothing but the railroad to facilitate the work. This car was hauled forward by the railroad company as the work progressed and left on convenient side tracks.

The survey of the coast of the Philippine Islands was continued under the immediate supervision of a Director, who represented the Superintendent in all matters requiring immediate action. He made plans for field operations and issued instructions for field work at the suboffice in Manila. The observations made in the field were computed, and drawings for charts of the regions surveyed were prepared for transmission to Washington for review and publication. Sailing- Directions and No!ices to Mariners were prepared and published. He was aided in this work by such advice and instructions issued from Washington as became necessary. The work was done under the same general plan of the division of expenses in force during the previous year. The National Government paid the salaries and subsistence of its technical corps detailed for duty in the Philippines, including several experts in the suboffice, furnished the instrumental equipment, paid the expenses of one large surveying steamer and for the supplies for two other surveying steamers, paid the expense of chart publication, the traveling expenses of officers to and from the Philippine Islands, and the hire of launches. The Philippine government paid the operating expenses of two surveying steamers, paid for the crew and repairs of two other surveying steamers (not including pay of officers), the party expenses of several surveying parties on shore, the salaries of the office force, and for office supplies obtained in Manila, and furnished office accommodations and printing. There was a free exchange of information and good offices between the Survey and the various military and civil bureaus having common aims, and a gratifying interest was shown in responding to requests for information. Special mention is made of the courtesies extended to the Survey by the chief engineer of the Philippines division, the chief of the military information division, quartermaster's department, the bureau of navigation and its light-h6use and port works divisions, the bureau of public works, the bureau of customs, and the supervising railroad expert.
FIELD WORK.

Steamer Pathfinder.-This vessel was in Manila repairing and outfitting from July 1 to 20 , when she proceeded to the east coast of Samar, and first filled in a gap in the triangulation in the vicinity of Sulat Bay and Hilabon Island, after which the work was taken up at the lower end of the operations of 1906' and continued southward. The triangulation was carried across the low peninsula which separates Matarinao and Quinapundan bays, and then extended from Gigoso Point in a southeasterly direction to include Malbon and Suluan islands.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1908.

The topography and hydrography were carried along the outside coast, around Sungi Point, including Suluan and Malhon islands, and connecting with the work of 1903. Four triangulation stations in Sulat Bay were occupied and one uncharted rock off Guiuan and another in Panoan Strait were located. The vessel returned to Manila on October 31, and remained, repairing and outfitting, until December 14, when she sailed for the Gulf of Davao, Mindanao, to continue the general surveys in that section. Work was carried on in that locality until the night of June 13, when the vessel sailed for Zamboanga for coal, and arrived there _on the evening 9f the 14th, coaled ship, and sailed again on the 18th, arriving in the vicinity of Dominga Shoal on the morning of the 20th. During the day this shoal was located and developed, and late in the afternoon the vessel continued on to Manila, where she arrived in the afternoon of the 21st, and during the balance of the month the party was engaged on office work and having minor repairs made on the vessel. The portion of the Gulf of Davao south of Samal Island is about 29 nautical miles in width in its narrowest part and about 42 miles in its widest part, necessitating long triangle sides, the stations of which had to be elevated in order to see across. All the shores and foothills are densely wooded, and required a large amount of cutting to open lines. Due to almost constant hazy weather, making it impossible to see poles or banners, heliotropes had to be used very extensively. The triangulation was extended from Samal Island to Cape San Augustin, the southeastern point of entrance to the gulf, and station "Banos" on the western side of the gulf, and most of the mountain peaks on both sides of the gulf were located and their elevations determined. The topography was completed along the eastern side of the gulf from Mapanga Bay to Cape San Augustin, along the western side from Malalag Bay north to Santa Cruz, and south to Port Tubalan. The hydrography was extended along the eastern side, and as far out as the middle of the gulf, from Sama! Island to Cape San Augustin, and on the western side the whole area between Sama! Island, Santa Cruz, and Port Tubalan was completed. Three tide stations were established and used in connection with this work. Steamer Fathomer.-At the beginning of the fiscal year this vessel was at Catanduanes Island, off the east coast of Luzon, engaged· in combined operations, and the work was extended along the east coast of the island from Yog Point to Nagumbuaya Point, developing the important harbors and typhoon anchorages of Port Bagamanoc and Jimota and Kalapadan bays. By carrying this work to Nagumbuaya Point and connecting there with the work of 1903 the survey of all the shore line and adjacent waters of Catanduanes Island was completed. This is the first survey of this coast, and the results show a startling difference from the old Spanish charts. After the completion of the above-named work the Fathomer proceeded to Rapurapu Strait, where she located and developed a reported shoal, then went to Batag Island and determined· the position of the new light-house, and also developed Wright and Fisher banks and two small shoals in the vicinity of Palijon Island, and carried the work westward from Catarman to a junction with the work of 1902 in San Bernardino Strait. The heavy weather which makes this vicinity very unfavorable for field work in the fall of the year brought matters to a close on October 26, and the vessel reached Manila on October 31. She was repairing and outfitting until December 21, when she

sailed for Zamboanga to examine a rock reported off that town; also to locate and develop the reported dangers in Basilan Strait, and then to take up the general survey in Sibuguey Bay and extend it to the eastward. The vessel arrived at Zamboanga on December 25 and was detained there by unfavorable weather until January 1, when she proceeded to the upper part of Sibuguey Bay and began field work at the limits of the former work in the vicinity of Buluan Island, and extended the triangulation, topography, and hydrography around the upper end of the bay and down the eastern side, which is very foul with dangerous reefs extending well offshore, then round the southern end of Olutanga Island and up into Dumanquilas Bay, connecting with a survey made by the U. S. S. Yorktown in 1903. Six uncharted reefs and 1 bank (over 5 miles across, surmounted by a rocky patch) were found south of Sibugucy Bay, all surrounded by deep water. A reported 9-fathom bank due south of the entrance to Dumanquilas Bay in about the latitude of Lutagan Point was searched for, but no indication of it could be found. Five tide stations were used at various times dui;ing the survey of Sibuguey Bay. The extension of the triangulation to the eastward of Sibuguey Bay involved a great deal of hard work. During the season, while the vessel was at Zamboanga for coal, a plane-table survey of the shore-line front of the town was made, and a hydrographic survey along the water front from the eastern side of the military reservation to a point as far west of the town as any vessels arc likely to approach the shore. This work was carried into the straits until depths of from 10 to io fathoms were reached, and a special examination was ·made for a shoal reported about 350 meters southeast of the long wharf, but no indications of it were found. While this work was going on the vessel searched for two reported shoals in Basilan Strait to the southward of the eastern end of Little Santa Cruz Island. No indications of the northern shoal could be found, but the other shoal was found as reported and enough discrepancies discovered in this section of the chart to indicate that a resurvey of Basilan Strait, especially near the Basilan coast, should be made. On June 27 the season's work in vicinity of Dumanquilas Bay was closed with the usual swinging of ship for magnetic variation, and the vessel started for Zamboanga for coal. While en route a shoal was sighted well to the southward of the work in Sibugucy Bay and a thorough examination of it was made and several soundings of 3 fathoms were obtained. At the close of the fiscal year the vessel was at sea en route from Zamboanga to Manila. Steamer Romblon.-At the beginning of the fiscal year the Romblon was on the eastern coast of Luzon, engaged in the surveys of San Miguel Bay, and on July 15, having completed that bay, the work in the vicinity of the Calagua Islands was taken up with a view of connecting it with the work' in Lamon Bay. · The topography -of the islands was completed on August 15. The work was making good progress when, on August 20, while sounding in the vicinity of Roses reef, the vessel struck on a pinnacle rock. Temporary repairs were made at Mercedes, but this- serious accident put an end to ·the season's operations, and the work had to be left in an unfinished condition.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1908.

On September 1 the vessel started for Manila, but owing to her damaged condition and bad weather did not reach there until September 8. She remained in Manila undergoing repairs and outfitting until October 24. While repairs were going on a boat party was engaged on special development work and the location of buoys in the harbor. On October 25 she sailed from Manila for Lucena, and the survey of the west coast of Luzon, Marinduque, and adjoining islands eastward from the termination of the work of 1906 was continued, and extended to the eastward between Marinduque and Luzon as far as Point Salomague and Lipata Point. The topography was extended southwest along the Luzon coast from Pitogo to the Matataha River, and from Port Banalacan to Point Salomague on the Marinduque coast, and also included the Anibayas Islands. The inshore hydrography developed the coast of Luzon from Mabio Point. to the Matataha River and the Marinduque coast from Point Santa Cruz to Point Salomague, and in addition special development was made at Pitogo and Mulanay anchorages, Catanauan Bay, Santa Cruz Harbor, and Port Banalacan. The offshore hydrography, with the ship, filled in the area in the vicinity of the inshore work above referred to, and in addition extended it south of Salomague Point to a point east of Mount Marlanga, and also filled in the space left between the hydrography executed previous to January 1 and the northwest coast of Marinduque. Current observations were made in Mompog Pass, tidal observations at Pitogo, Catanauan Bay, and Santa Cruz Harbor, and magnetic observations at Romblon. Th.e vessel closed field work in the vicinity of Marinduque Island on April 10, and arrived in Manila on the 12th, where she was overhauled and outfitted, and on May 18 sailed for Coal Harbor, Batan Island, to develop the inner harbor at request of the military authorities. The vessel arrived there on the 21st and reran the shore line, measured a solar azimuth, and did enough hydrography to develop the inner harbor, and also observed tides. This work was completed on the 25th, and on the following day the vessel sailed for Mercedes, where she arrived on the 27th, coaled ship, and located three new buoys recently placed in the mouth of Daet River. On May 29 the vessel l)roceeded to Capalonga and established a self-registering tide gauge in the estuary of the river. On the following day she proceeded to Atimonan, where the triangulation was taken up to connect the main scheme, which was brought across the divide from the west side of Luzon, connecting with the triangulation of Lamon Bay and of Calagua Islands. Much rainy and cloudy weather interfered with the use of the heliotropes, which were required on all the lines, a:nd a great deal of steaming was demanded of the ship to · keep all parties moving. Steamer 111arinduque.-The Afarinduque was in Manila repairing and outfitting from July 1 to 9, and on the 10th she sailed for the east coast of Luzon, where she arrived on the 14th and took up the general surveys of Lamon Bay and vicinity, in continuation of the work of the preceding year, beginning the triangulation in the vicinity of Alabat and Atimonan, and carrying it round the south end of Lamon Bay and out Calauag Bay to Pangao Point. ·The topographic work was extended along the shore of Luzon frcim Atimonan to Dagdap, and also along the shore of Alabat Island around the south end and along the eastern shore to Gerado Point, where it connects with the work of the preceding year. A survey was also made of Balesin Island. The hydrographic work includes the south end of Lamon and Calauag bays and was extended out to Dagdap

Point, Balesin, and Cabaleto Islands. The season was closed and the vessel started for Manila October 13 and arrived ~n the 15th. From the 16th to the 21st she was engaged in repairing and outfitting, and on the 22d sailed from Manila for Palompon, Leyte, where she arrived on the 24th, and on the following day resumed the general surveys between Cebu and Leyte and continued ~t northward from the previous work in this vicinity. The triangulation was around the northern extremity of Cebu Island and into the northern entrance of Tanon Strait, and also around the north end of Leyte Island and through Biliran Strait into Carigara Bay. The topography was completed along the east coast of Cebu from Bantulin Point to Campatoc Point, along the west coast of Leyte from Villaba around Rabin Point and through Biliran Strait into Carigara Bay, and around the. south and west shore of Biliran Island from Matuntun Point to Tincausan. The hydrography included the area between Cebu .and Leyte from Bantulin and Duljugan points on the south to the northwest end of Biliran Island and through Biliran Strait into Carigara Bay. Field work in this vicinity was closed on April 2 and the vessel returned to Manila to make repairs preparatory to taking up the summer's work on the east coast of Luzon. On May 18 the vessel sailed for the east coast of Luzon and arrived at Atimonan on the 22d. Field work was immediately commenced, but stormy weather prevailed during the remainder of the month and the completion of one topographic sheet and some signal building was all that could be accomplished. The month of June was much more favorable for field work and the triangulation between Polillo and Luzon and four topographic sheets were completed. At the close of the year the work was in progress. Steamer Research.-This vessel was at Iloilo from July 1 to 6 having repairs made; on the 7th she resumed work on the north coast of Negros Island, and the triangulation, topography, and hydrography were extended until October 19, when a junction was made with the work at Danao River. The topography includes the shore of Negros Island from Bito Point to Danao River and the outlying islands. At the Guimugahan River the topography was extended 7 miles inland to the head of navigation. The hydrography was extended 10 to 15 miles offshore, ending on a line from Baliguian Island to the southwestern extremity of .the Don Islands and thence southward to Danao River. At the close of this work the vessel returned to Iloilo and remained until October 1, when work was resumed on the northeast coast of Panay, extending the hydrography and topography from the limits of the work of last year. The hydrography was taken. up on a line from Malangaban Island to Baliguian Island and thence to Macajolum shoals and extended northward to latitude 11° 27' and eastward to longitude 123° 27'. This was all outside work extending about 15 miles offshore, in depths ranging from 3 to 30 fathoms. All the shoals indicated on the Spanish chart within this area were located and developed, and in addition four others previously uncharted were located. A very thorough search was made for "Molena Shoal P. D.," but no trace of it was found. The passage south of. Sicogon Island is entirely clear, having not less than 17 fathoms, and the native fishermen do not know of any such shoal as that indicated on the old charts. Field work was closed on January 11 and the vessd returned to Manila on the 2oth. Assistant Miller assumed command on February 1, and remained in Manila outfitting

and repairing until March 5. While repairs were in progress, three days, February 3 to 5, inclusive, were devoted to a hydrographic examination of portions of Manila Harbor in order to locate two sunken wrecks which had been causing trouble to vessels. After repairing and outfitting at Manila, the vessel sailed on ~farch 5 to resume the work off the northeast coast of Panay, and by June 20 the hydrography had been extended aboµt r 5 miles to the northward and eastward. She then moved to Batangas Island arid spent the remainder of the month in extending the topography. During the season about 25 sandy and rocky shoals were carefully developed, some b~ing shown on previous charts. The inside passage from Tagil Pass to Bulacaue Point which 'has been used only by small coasters, was shown to have 10 feet at low water. To aid in the offshore work, two large bamboo buoys 25 feet square and 25 feet high were made and anchored, and they were seen with ease at a distance of 8 miles. Launch 1'1orven.~This party was organized to take up the survey of the southern end of Tanon Strait. She left Manila on July 2, arrived at Dumaguete, Negros Island, on the 3d, and work began on the 5th. A base line was located and measured just 'north of Dumaguete and the triangulation was extended from this base to the northward through Tanon Strait as far as Guijulugano on the Negros side and Tanguil Point on the Cebu side. An azimuth was observed from the stone tower of the church at Dumaguete and connected with the triangulation. The topography on the Cebu J.sland shore of the strait was completed from Tanon Point, at the southeast extremity of Cebu Island, to Tanguil Point and on the Negros Island shore from Dumaguete to the barrio of Calagcalag. The hydrography was completed from ~he southern entrance of Tanon Strait up the strait to Tanguil Point on the eastern side and to Calagcalag on the· western side. A topographic and hydrographic survey was also made of Port Canoan, Siquijor Island, at the request of a member of the Philippine Commission. The field work closed on December 19 and the party returned the launch to her owner at Iloilo and arrived at Manila on December 27, where it was disbanded. At the request of the insul!J.r government for a survey of the north and west coasts of Bohol Island, Assistant C. V. Hodgson was directed to organize a party for that purpose and the launch Morven was again chartered for his use. The party sailed from Manila on February 12 by regular steamer for Cebu, where the launch had be~n ordered to meet them, and. on their arrival there the instruments, outfit, and supplies were transferred to the launch and she sailed for Ubay, Bohol, on the 16th. A base line was measured and a self-registering tide gauge was established. Hydrographic work commenced on March 1, using plane-table triangulation as a base until the triangulation could be extended from the work of the previous season. The inshore hydrography in that vicinity was extended from 10 to 14 miles offshore. Ubay was used as headquarters until May 4, on which date the party moved to Jetafe, at the northwest corner of Bohol Island. The triangulation was extended from the previous work across to Cebu Island and connected with the triangulation of 1902 in the vicinity of Cebu Harbor. The inshore- hydrography, extending out to the Danajon Bank, and the topography down the west coast of Bohol Island was in progress at the close of the year.

Launch Erica.-The work assigned to this party was to close the gap between the northeast point of Panay and the former work in the vicinity of Capiz. The line Manigonigo light-house to Jintotolo light-house was used as a .base, and in three figures a connection was made with a line in the triangulation of 1903 in the vicinity of Capiz. The outlying islands Zapatos and Olutaya made the laying out of a strong scheme comparatively easy, although some difficulty was experienced in locating stations in the low flat country south of Pirara Point and west of Tinagongdaget Inlet. The topography presented no difficult features, except that it was impracticable to make a plane-table survey of Tinagongdaget Inlet on account 1of. the fact that it was bordered on all sides by mangrove swamps and the water was too deep for setting up an instrument; therefore a sextant survey of the inlet was made, it being controlled by triangulation. The greater part of the work was the hydrography, which extended from Manigonigo light-house to Colasi Point and out to and including Cucaracha Shoal and the Zapato Islands. Field work was closed on November 2, and on the 14th the party started for ~fanila on the launch Erica, arriving there on the 16th, when the party was disbanded.
OFFICJo; WORK.

The suboffice at Manila is organized to do all the work involved in chart construction. The records of observations made in the field were received as the work progressed. The necessary computations were made and the resulting data compiled in the form of drawings for charts. Eight drawings for new charts and 7 drawings for new ~ditions of charts were prepared during the year and sent to Washington for publication. A new edition of the Philippine Islands Sailing Directions, Section IV, was prepared and published. A supplement to Section V was published and also Philippine Island Notices to Mariners Nos. 6 to 1 2 of 1 907 and Nos. 1 to 4 of 1 908. The Director is the disbursing agent for the Philippine work, and all expenditures, except expenditures on account of the steamer Pathfinder, are made by him. and under his direction. He renders his accounts to the general Disbursing Agent, at Washington, for all expenses paid on the part of the General Government. This work involves a great deal of clerical labor and is increased by the accounts kept to show the disbursement·of the funds furnished by the insular government, for which vouchers are rendered to the proper accounting officer's of that government. A division of map archives was formed during the year for the purpose ot collecting and indexing all maps, sketches, descriptive reports, field notes, and general information fr~m all available sources, in order to compile a new map of the archipelago and to keep such a map up to date by preparing and publishing new editions whenever new information makes this desirable. It is believed that this collection will be of great public utility, as it will be a combination of all the authoritative geographical information relating to the islands.

Work along the north coast of Panay to complete the unsurveyed portion of the coast between the northeast point of the island and the vicinity of Capiz was assigned to Assistant Beck. He landed at Libas on July 25, and the work was continued until November 14, when the party started on the return trip to Manila. The survey of the coast, including triangulation, topography, and hydrography, was extended from Manigonigo light-house to Colasi Point light-house and connects with work already completed in these localities. A self-registering tide gauge was installed at Libas, and observations were made during the progress of the work. Provision was made in the vicinity of Capiz for the extension of the triangulation with long lines across the old work to Calibo. The area covered by the hydrographic work is comparatively shoal, the 20-fathom curve being about 8 miles offshore. The work was extended over the area between Zapatos Islands and Pilar Bay and over the Cucuracha Shoal. The northeast monsoon began to blow steadily on November l and work was closed soon afterwards, as stated.

On July l the steamer Research was at Iloilo having minor repairs made. The survey of the north coast of Negros, including triangulation, topography, and hydrography, was resumed on the 7th and continued without interruption until October 19, when a junction was made with the work previously done on Danao River, thus completing the survey of the north coast of the island. The coast is low and nearly all covered with a growth of mangrove. The topographic work extends along the shore of Negros Island and l mile inland and includes the outlying islanqs. At the Guimugahan River the topographic survey was extended 7 miles inland to the head of navigation. The hydrographic work was extended from IO to rs miles offshore, ending on a line from Baliguian Island to the southwestern extremity of Don Islands and thence south to Danao River. In November work on the northeast coast of Panay began and was continued until January IO, when operations were suspended and the party returned to Manila. The hydrographic work was extended 15 miles offshore, the depths varying from 3 to 30 fathoms. All of the shoals indicated on the Spanish charts of this locality were located and developed and 4 not shown were discovered. A thorough search was made for the so-called "Moleno Shoal," but rio trace of it was found. The passage south of Sicogo11 Island was found to be cleat with 17 fathoms of water. The native fishermen were asked about the location of this shoal, but they knew nothing about it. While the vessel was engaged on the hydrographic work, a topographic party 6n shore completed the survey of the Sicogon and Gigantes islands and the shore from the vicinity of Magalumbi Isl~nd to Gogo Point, including the islands to the east and northeast.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1908·.

The topographic survey of the islands was completed on August 1 5 by a party living on shore, but the work from the vessel was greatly delayed on account of there being no harbor in the islands. A hydrographic party was placed on shore at Borocboc, and work was continued in this way until the completion of the topographic survey. Tide observatfons were made by using a self-registering gauge at Mercedes, supplemented by a tide staff in the islands. The triangulation work was continued until August 20, on which date the vessel struck a pinnacle rock on Roses Reef, and this accident made immediate repairs necessary. Temporary repairs were made at Mercedes and the work on Roses Reef was completed before the vessel sailed for Manila. Unfavorable weather delayed the arrival of the vessel until September 9. The repairs were completed and the vessel sailed for Lucena, southwest coast of Luzon, on October 25. While at Manila some hydrographic work was done in the harbor and some buoys were located. A reconnaissance was made and triangulation stations were selected to connect the work on the east and west coasts of Luzon and the islands of Marinduque, St. Cruz, Maninagan, and Mompog, on the west coast, and Alabat and Balesin, on the east coast. The triangulation was extended from the vicinity of Lucena to a point opposite Marinduque Island. A topographic survey was made along the north and east coasts of Marinduque Island to Point Salomague and along the opposite shore of Luzon. The hydrographic survey was extended along the coast of Tayabas Province, Luzon, as far south as Matataha River, and to cover the area out to Marinduque Island. The hydrographic features of Pitogo and Mulanay anchorages, Catanauan Bay, Santa Cruz Harbor, and Port Banalacan were specially developed. Current observations were made in Mompog Pass, magnetic observations at Romblon, and tide observations at Pitogo, Catanauan, and Santa Cruz. The work closed on April 10, and the vessel sailed next day for Manila. The Romhlon sailed from Manila for Daet on the coast ·of Luzon on May 18. En route a topographic resurvey of the shore line of Coal Harbor, Batan Island, was made, and some supplemental hydrographic work was done. The positions of three new buoys at the entrance to Daet River were deterrpined after the work at Coal Harbor was completed. After June 1 the triangulation was extended eastward from Lamon Bay to the Calagua Islands, connecting Polillo, Balesin, Alabat, and Jomalig islands with each other and with the Calagua Islands and Luzon. The work was in progress on June 30.

The triangulation was extended from the old work on the islands, off the west coast of Catanduanes Island, across the north end of the island and down the east coast to the vici~ity of Agutayan Point. From this point to the south end of the island the country bordering the coast is mountainous and heavily wooded nearly to the shore line, and there are no rocks or islands offshore available for use in triangulation; consequently a . plane-table triangulation was extended along this portion of the coast and connected with a triangulation station on Lagonoy Gulf. The topographic and hydrographic

COAST AND GEODETIC S URVEY REPORT, 1908,

surveys along the east coast of Catanduanes Island were completed on September 24, and on the 25th magnetic observations were made off Port Anajao, and the vessel sailed the next day for Legaspi. In passing through Rapurapu Strait a reported shoal was located, and developed by making soundings. Coal and supplies were obtained at Legaspi, and the vessel reached the north coast of Samar on September 29. Four shoals, Wright and Fisher banks, and 2 smaller shoals in the vicinity of Pelijon Island, were located and developed by soundings. The triangulation on the north coast of Samar was completed by filling in between the work already finished along this portion of the coast. A tid~ staff was established in the mouth of the river below Catarman and connected with a bench m~rk in that place by leveling, and the inshore hydrographic work was completed along the north and east coast of Cabaun Island. All the work was completed on October 26, including magnetic observations offshore in Biri Channel, and on the 27th the vessel sailed for Manila via LegaspL' The Fathomer sailed from Manila in December and reached Zamboanga, Mindanao, on December 25. On January 1 topographic and hydrographic work began in Sibuguey Bay. The topographic survey was extended from a point on the west shore of the bay opposite Buluan Island around the head of the bay and down the east shore to the entrance, including a survey of Olutanga Island and the shores of Port Sibulan to a junction with the pr~vious work at the entrance of Dumanquilas Bay. The hydrographic survey covers the whole bay above Bagolibud Point (on the west shore) and the eastern half of the bay to a point about 30 miles outside Olutanga Island, including also Port Sibulan and its entrance. Five tide stations were established in this work. A triangulation was also carried across Sibuguey Bay, and extended to cover Port Sibulan. The work closed in Port Sibulan on June 27.
[J. F. PRATT, Commanding, Steamer Pathfinder.]
SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Hydrography: 1 954 square miles of area covered, 2 403 miles of lines sounded, 27 044 soundings made, 3 tide stations occupied, and 8 hydrographic sheets completed. Topography: 115 square miles of area covered, 108 miles of general coast line surveyed, 16 miles of shore line of rivers and creeks surveyed, 5 miles of roads surveyed, and 5 topographic sheets completed. Triangulation: 2 729 square miles of area covered, 16 stations occupied, and 89 geographic positions determined.

The Pathfin4er sailed from Manila on December 14, and reached Davao on the 19th, making magnetic observations at sea at four stations en route. A self-registering tide gauge and two tide staffs were established and a reconnaissance for the triangulation of tl)e Gulf of Davao was made. · The gulf is very -wide (29 nautical miles in the narrowest place) and the foothills near the shores are densely wooded. Field work in this locality was continued until June 13, when the vessel sailed for Manila. The long lines over which the observations were made necessitated the use of heliotropes, and the heliotropers were stationed in pairs and armed on account of the hostility of the natives. The triangulation was extended to cover the gulf from Samal Island to Point San Agustin, at the entrance. Heliotropes were used on lines more than 8 miles in length, and several of these were constructed in the field to meet the increased demand.

The lines in the main scheme of triangulation ranged from 25 to 43 miles in 'length, and many of the lines had to be cleared by cutting avenues through a dense tropical growth. The weather was very unfavorable until the middle of April, with heavy clouds and rainfall, and the sun was totally obscured over half the time. A topographic survey of the shore line was made along the eastern shore from Mapanga Bay, opposite Samal Island, to Cape San Agustin and along the western shore north of Malalag Bay and of Tubalan Bay. The hydrographic work was extended over the gulf as far south as Port Tubalan and over the eastern half of the gulf to Cape San Agustin. The work shows the existence of several ridges in the gulf, the most prominent one having 65 fathoms of water on top and over 500 fathoms on both sides. Strong currents were found off the southern ends of Talicud and Samal islands and off Cape San Agustin. The mountain peaks were nearly always in the clouds, and could not be used in the hydrographic work. Field work in the gulf closed on June 13, when the vessel sailed for Manila. En route Dominga Shoal was located and developed by sounding.
[D. B. WAINW~IGH'f, Commanding, Steamer Pathfinder.) SUMMARY OF RSSULTS.-Hydrography. 334 square miles of area covered, 1 450 miles of lines sounded, 12 059 soundings made, and 3 tide stations occupied. ·Topography: 34 square miles of area covered, 77 miles of general coast line surveyed, 1 mile of shore line of creeks surveyed, and 5 hydrographic sheets completed. Triangulation: 400 .square miles of area covered, 22 station<> occupied, and 34 geogi:aphic positions determined.

The work of surveying the east coast of Samar was in progress on July 1. The party on the Pathfinder continued this under the direction of Assistant Wainwright until October 27, when the work closed and the vessel'proceeded to Manila. The principal work of the party may be summarized as follows: The completion of the unfinished portion of the survey of the coast above and also below Matarinao Bay, the extension of the surveys southward and westward from Sungi Point to and including Suluan and Malbon islands, and the connection of the triangulation work of 1903 with that of 1905-6. Four triangulation stations were occupied in Sulat Bay and uncharted rocks were located off Guian and in Panoan Strait. ':fhe triangulation extends from Matarinao Bay across the low peninsula, which separates the bay from Quinapundan Bay and from Gigoso Point southeastward to Malbon and Suluan islands. The hydrographic work began at the north end of Iniyao Island and was extended along the coast to a point south and west of Malbon Island. Soundings were made over an area extending offshore to a distance of from 2 to 5 miles to depths varying from 140 to 680 fathoms. The topographic work included the survey of the shoi:e line and a narrow band extending inland along the mainland of Samar and the whole of the islands of Malbon and Suluan . . A small portion of the shore line and interior topography was also surveyed on Calicoan Island.
PORTO RICO.

[W. B. KEELING.)

The work of the magnetic observatory at Vieques, P. R., was continued during the fiscal year without interruption, and a record of the relative value of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism was obtained. The seismograph was in continuous operation and a record with this instrument was also obtained. An additional building was constructed for use as an office.

[P. A. WELKER, Commanding, Steamer Bache.]

SUMMARY o~· RESULTS.-Hydrography: 422 square miles of area covered, 1 11 r miles of lines sounded, r r 514 soundings made, 2 tide stations occupied, and 6 hydrographic sheets completed. Magnetic work: 3 stations occupied on land and ro stations occupied at sea.

The steamer Bache left Baltimore on January 6 for Porto Rico to complete the offshore hydrography along the north coast of. the island. On the next day in a severe storm the vessel dragged her anchor in Hampton Roads and was driven intq the U. S. hospital ship ] amestown, at anchor in Hampton Roads, causing considerable damage and making immediate repairs necessary. While waiting for the work to be done, supplemental topographic work was completed (January 17 to February 8) along the water front in the vicinity of Norfolk to show all changes since the last survey was made. Magnetic observations were made on board ship in Hampton Roads on February 28, and on March 16 the voyage to Porto Rico began. Rough weather interfered with the magnetic work en route, but a few observations were made. Magnetic observations were made on board in the harbor of Mayaguez and at a number of stations at sea on the retum·voyage to Norfolk, and a special route was followed in order to obtain observations at points off the direct route. Hydrographic signals were erected at triangulation points along the north and west coast of the island from Boca Juan Point to Point Cadena, covering about 80 miles of the coast. It was necessary to place a party on shore to do this work, as the almost continuous heavy surf made regular boat landings impracticable. The work on shore was done under great disadvantage on account of the absence of facilities for proper transportation of men and material. The hydrographic work was completed along the coast from Boca Juan Point on the north coast to Point Jiguero on the west coast, except a narrow strip of inshore work from Boca Juan Point to Point Borenquen, and the soundings were extend.ed offshore to the 300-fathom cun·e without finding any indications of dangers to navigation. The field work closed on May 23, and the vessel sailed from San Juan for Baltimore on May 30 and reached her destination on June 7.

SPECIAL DUTY.
·NEW YORK.

[A. T.

MOSMAN.]

The trigonometric survey of Greater New York was continued by the city authorities under the direction of Assistant Mosm.an, and the field work was almost completed at the close of the fiscal year. Observations were made at 5 r stations in the Borough of Queens during the year, and this work was completed except at 4. stations. The observations at these 4 stations will complete the field work of tri;mgulation over the whole area of Greater New York.
·INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARIES.

[O. H.

TxTTMANN.]

UNITED STATES AND CANADA BOUNDARY.

The work of re-marking this boundary west of the Rocky Mountains was continued during the year, under the direction of the joint commission, in which Messrs. 0. H. Tittmann and C. D. Walcott represent the United States and Mr. W. F. King, Great Britain. During the summer of 1907 the Commissioners made a joint personal 'inspection of the boundary at various points. The representatives of the Commissioners, Messrs. C. H. Sinclair and N. J. Ogilvie, inspected the monuments from the top of the Rocky Mountains to the east side of Lake Osoyoos, a distance along the boundary of 242 miles. In this section r 55 boundary monuments were inspected and a plate bearing the proper number was attached to each. This work was very laborious, as it involved r 400 miles of travel, 800 miles of which was by pack train. The work closed for the winter on Octobet 22, 1907. It was resumed in June, and w~s in progress at the close of the year. In the spring a party began the work of recovering and re-marking the boundary east of the Rocky Mountains, and on June 30 the work was in progress along the Montana boundary east of Coutts, Province of Alberta. Messrs. F. D. Granger and J. J. McArthur represented the Commissioners on this work. On July r the work of recovering and re-marking the Vermont-Canada boundary was in progress under the direction of Mr. 0. H. Tittmann and Mr. W. F. King, Commissioners of the United States and Great Britain, respectively. The r~presentatives of the Commissioners, Messrs. J. B. Baylor and G. C. Rainboth, had charge of the work in the field. Field operations continued until November 9, when the work closed for the winter. During this period 55 miles of the boundary was surveyed and a vista was cut through the forest. Ninety cast-iron monuments were reset in concrete bases and 86 new granite monuments were placed in position, set in concrete bases. Four large
55

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, x908.

concrete monuments were built, 2 on the shores of Missisquoi Bay and 2 on the shores of Richelieu River. A topographic survey was made along the boundary covering a strip half a mile wide on each side, on a scale of 4 inches to l mile. Large scale maps (1 inch= 250 feet) were made of the immediate vicinity of the boundary, covering a strip 500 feet wide on both sides. On the date mentioned, November 9, the field work along the Vermont-Canada boundary was completed. In the spring the monuments along the Vermont-Canada boundary were inspected to ascertain the effect of frost during the winter, and were found in good condition. · In June the recovery of the Maine-New Brunswick boundary was begun and at the end of the month 8 miles of the line had been recovered and remonumented, and the work of opening a vista along the line and of making a topographic survey in its vicinity on both sides was in progress by the joint party· of surveyors representing the United States and Great Britain, on June 30.
ALASKA BOUNDARY.

The demarcation of the boundary between Alaska and Canada along the one hundred and forty-first meridian was continued as provided in J:he convention between the United States and Great Britain (signed April 21, 1906) by Mr. 0. H. Tittmann, the Commissioner representing the United States, and Mr. W. F. King, the Commissioner representing Great Britain. Messrs. G. C. Baldwin and A. J. Brabazon, representing the Commissioners in the field, extended the line southward from the point reached on June 30, and at the close of work for the winter established a point 125 miles south of the Yukon River. Marks were left on the summits and at numerous intermediate places for the use of the surveying and monumenting party which was following. Mr. Thomas Riggs, jr., had charge of the party engaged in making a survey along the boundary line. Triangulation along the line with points on each side was extended south from the Yukon River for a distance of 62 miles, and in this work observations were made at 43 stations. A vista 20 feet wide on the sky line was opened for a distance of 54 miles. A topographic survey was made in the vicinity of the boundary, and it was extended to cover a strip 21 miles wide on each side. Boundary monuments were established on the banks of the Yukon River, one on each bank, and sites for monuments were selected and marked at short intervals along the line. Eighteen sites were established south of the river in a total distance of 54 miles. On June 30 Messrs. Ba)dwin and Riggs were in the field with their parties continuing their work of the previous season. In southeastern Alaska several parties were at work on the demarcation of the boundary. Mr. 0. M. Leland was at work in the vicinity of Lynn Canal. The triangulation was extended up the Katzehin River, and 20 stations were occupied. Nine of these were stations from which observations were made .directly on boundary peaks and one was on a boundary peak. Incidentally the geographic positions of the light-houses at Eldred Rock and Point Sherman were determined. The portion of the boundary located extends from "6800," north of Katzehin River, southeastward to "8000," just north of Taku River. Boundary peak 6600 was occupied as a triangulation station, and the directions to several other boundary peaks were observed. Eight stations were occupied with topographic cameras and n'.umerous

phototopographic negatives were obtained. This work furnishes much new i'nformation, especially concerning the Meade Glacier district. Mr. Fremont Morse continued the triangulation in the vicinity of Glacier Bay and extended the work from the stations in the coast triangulation of Icy Strait to the head of Glacier Bay. Thirty-nine stations were occupied and 57 geographic positions were determined. A base line was measured to verify the work, and observations were made to determine the latitude of a point and an azimuth. The positions of all the boundary peaks were determined from "7450" to Mount Fairweather and thence eastward to
"5300."

A party under Mr. Leland's direction resumed work in June on the survey of the boundary in the vicinity of the Unuk River, and the work was in progress on June 30. Mr. Morse began similar work in the vicinity of the Alsek River in May, and the work was in progress on June 30.

OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE.
ANDREW BRAID,

Assistant i'n Charge.

The Assistant in Charge of the Office has direct supervision of the work of the different divisions of the Office. , The Miscellaneous Section is a part of the immediate office of the Assistant in Charge.
COMPUTING DIVISION.

The reduction of. the triangulation in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina to the United States standard datum was continued. Geographic positions on this datum are now available for all points in the main scheme of triangulation from Port Royal, S. C., to Mobile, Ala., and around the coast of Florida, and for many points not in the main scheme in South Carolina and Georgia. The triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian in southern Texas and also the triangulation in California north of Monterey Bay has also been reduced to the standard datum. The computation of the triangulation in California done since the earthquake of April i 8, I9o6, to fix the new positions of the disturbed points was completed, and the results showing the earth movements have been published. A third adjustment of the precise net in the United States was made and the results were partly prepared for publication. About two-thirds of the energy of the Division was used in preparing data for publication, and a good deal of material is in an advanced state of preparation.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

The preparation of the results obtained by making magnetic observations on land and at sea during the fiscal year ended June 30, I907, was completed, and they were published as an. appendix to the Annual Report of the Survey for that Y.ear. The computation of the results of the observations made on land and at sea by the party on the steamer Explorer while en route from Norfolk, Va., to Seattle, Wash., via the Straits of Magellan, was completed, and these results were furnished to the United States Hydrographic Office, Navy Department, at the request of that Office. The reduction of the work at the magnetic observatories previous to 1905 is nearly completed, and the results are almost ready for publication.

COAST AND GEODETIC Sl:RVEY REPORT, 1908.

The compilation of earthquake data from the seismographs at the magnetic observatories of the Survey to the end of l 907 was completed. These results and seismograms showing the principal earthquakes were transmitted to Prof. H. F. Reid, the United States representative of the ·Internafional Seismological Association. The reduction of magnetic observation made in the field during the year, as well as the usual routine work of the Division, was kept up to date.
TIDAL DIVISION.

An harmonic analysis was computed for I station for I year. Nonharmonic reductions were made for I l 1 stations, with a combined length of 32 years 7 months and 14 days. Mean sea level has been computed for 14 stations, with a combined length of IO years and 8 months. High and low waters and hourly heights of the sea have been tabulated for 146 stations, with a combined length of 33 years 9 months and 14 days. There were received, examined, and registered in this division the records from l 9 automatic tide gauge stations of this Survey, with a combined length of 12 years 2 months and 4 days, together with staff gauge records from 63 stations, with a combined length of 5 years IO months and 22 days. The total of all tide observations made by this Survey and received during the year is l 8 years and 26 days at 82 stations, and from other sources about 14 years 4 months and 26 days at 28 stations, making a total of nearly 32! years of tide observations at l IO stations. The following is a list of the sources from which tide obsel'Vations were received from outside parties during the year: l. United States Army Engineers, tides for l station in Washington, with a length of l month and 24 days; tides for Colon and Panama, Canal Zone, with combined length of 3 months and 12 days. 2. United States Navy Engineers, tides for 3 stations in California, with a combined length of l year and 6 months. 3. The American embassy at Mexico, Mexico, tides for 10 Mexican ports, with a combined length of 7 years IO months and 5 days. 4. The sewerage department of Boston, Mass., tides for l station in Massachusetts for l year. 5. The Hawaiian Territorial government, tides at Honolulu for 6 months. 6. The Philippine government, tides at Manila and Iloilo, with a combi.ned length of I year and l l months. 7. The Norwegian hydrographic office, tides at 8 Korwegian ports, with a combined length of l year and 2 months. The concluding portion, Part V, of the Manual of Tides, "Currents, shallow-water tides, meteorological tides, and miscellaneous matters," was completed, printed, and the proof was read. The Tide Tables for 1909, containing the predicted tides for that year, were also completed, printed, and the proof was read. At the request of the German ambassador in Washington, D. C., manuscript copies of the predicted tides for the year l 909 for Sandy Hook, Baltimore, Charleston, and San Francisco were sent to the hydrographic office at Williamshaven, .Germany. At the request of the secretary of the marine department of New Zealand manuscript copies of the predicted tides for Wellington and Auckland for the year 1909 were sent to him. ·

DRAWING AND ENGRAVDIG DIVISION.

The Division is divided into five sections-the Drawing, the.Engraving, the Printing, the Photographing, and the Electrotyping s(!ctions. Each section does the. work indicated by, its title, and the combined result is shown on the charts published and issued by the Survey. On November 20, 1907, the Hydrographic Section of the Chart Division was transferred to this division and after that date all the work of chart construction was done in the division. On January 1, 1908, the publication of a monthly Notice to Mariners was discontinued by the Coast and Geodetic Sun1ey, and since that date all information obtained by the Survey has been published by the Light-House Board in the weekly Notice to Mariners, issued by that Bureau. All desired information is prepared and furnished weekly to the Light-House Board by this division.

All the work in connection with the sale of charts is done in this Division. The corrections necessary to keep the charts up to date were indicated and the monthly Notice to Mariners was prepared in the Division previous to November 20, 1907, the date on which all the work of chart construction was brought together under the Drawing and Engraving Division by the transfer to that Division of the work previously done in the Hydrographic Section of the Chart Division and the employees engaged on the work.
INSTRUMENT DIVISION.

In this Division an account was kept of all instruments and general property owned by the Survey or purchased during the year, except articles on the inventory of the Office at Washington. All necessary repairs were made to instruments used by the Survey. l\Enor repairs were made to the Office buildings and furniture. Considerable progress was made in constructing a new tide-predicting machine. The superstructure was received and the machine was assembled. The gearing connecting the two main parts of the machine was made and mounted. The main driving gear was constructed and put in place. A test was made for flexure with a satisfactory result. A design based upon the ordinary interferometer was made for an apparatus to measure the movement of pendulum cases such as used by the Survey, caused by the

swinging of the pendulum, when gravity observations are being made. The construction of duplicate sets of this apparatus was well advanced during the year. A number of monuments to be used in marking the Alaska boundary were inspected. Four duplicates of the leveling instrument devised and adopted by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, made for the East Indian government by private parties subject to inspection and approval by the Superintendent, were carefully examined and recommended for approval. The machine for engraving soundings was modified so that it can be operated by one man instead of two when the soundings are placed on a plate in their proper position by a photographic-transfer process.
LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES.

The current routine work was kept up to date. The records of observations made in the field were indexed as they were received. Progress was made in the preparation of a complete author and subject catalogue. The following tables show the accessions and issues during the year:

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY BETWEEN JULY I, 1907, AND JUNE 30, 1908.
By R. L.
FARIS,

Inspector of Magnetic 1¥ork, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

INTRODUCTION.

The present publication contains the results of magnetic observations made on land and at sea by officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the prosecution of the magnetic survey of the United States and outlying territories during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1908. There are also included the results obtained by the party on the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Explorer during the cruise from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast in the spring of 1 907. * Five magnetic observatories t have been in continuous operation throughout the year-at Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Sitka, Alaska; near Honolulu, Hawaii, and on Vieques Island, Porto Rico. In April, 1907, the instruments at Vieques were moved from old Fort Isabel, where they had been in operation since February, 1903, and installed in a building especially constructed for use as a magnetic observatory, about half a mile west of the fort. There will be found in the tables the values of the magnetic elements at each of the observatories, as based on the observations of December ·and January.
OBSERVATIONS ON LAND AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

The distribution of the stations on land is shown in the following table, from which it will be seen that observations were made during the year in 35 States and Territories. Especial attention was directed to increasing the density of distribution of stations in the northern part of the country from New York to the Dakotas and to securing secular change data in the South Atlantic and Gulf States.

SECULAR CHANGE OF THE MAGNETIC DECtINATION.

In Appendix 3, Report for 1905, attention was called to the fact that since about 1898 the change in the direction of the compass needle from year to year has been

different from what would be expected from a study of the observations made prior to 1898. In 1906. a ,new discussion was made of all the available data, and the results were published in Appendix 4, Report for 1906, in the form of tables showing the secular change of the magnetic declination in different parts of the country from 1750 to 1905. Since that time a large number of old magnetic stations have been reoccupied in order to follow as closely as possible the secular change in the magnetic elements. A comparison of the results for declination is presented in the following table. It will be seen that the resulting values of annual change do not in general differ materially from those given in Appendix 4 for 1906. The letters after the_ names of stations indicate (a) that the old station was reoccupied exactly, (b) that the two stations were

APPENDIX· 3,

very near together, and (c) that the new station was some distance (quarter of a mile or more) from the old one. A tabulated value of annual change refers approximately to the middle of the period from which it is deduced. A plus sign indicates increasing east declination or decreasing west declination and a minus sign the reverse.

OBSERVATIONS AT SEA AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

Magnetic observations have been made at sea as often as the regular surveying work of the ships of the Bureau would permit. Observations were made on the Bache during her cruises from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Georges Bank and return, and to Porto Rico and return; on the ExNorer on her cruise from Seattle, ·wash., to Ketchikan, Alaska, and return in 1907, and irom Seattle to Kodiak, Alaska, in 1908, and on the Patterson between Seattle and Kodiak in 1907. In the progress of the survey of Georges Bank, course observations were made on the Bache at 19 places, but the results showed such a wide range that they have been combined to a single mean value. The results of observations at sea, including those made by the party on the Explorer during her cruise from the Atlantic to the Pacific, are distributed as follows:

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1908. METHODS OF OBSERVING.
LAND WORK.

The methods of observing have been the same as those followed in previous years. Observers engaged exclusively in magnetic work are supplied with a complete outfit, consisting of theodolite magnetometer, dip circle, half-second pocket chronometer, observing tent, and small accessories, while those who are expected to get magnetic results incidental to other work are supplied with more or less complete outfits, according to circumstances. Where only declination results can be secured under the conditions involved, a compass declinometer is supplied, but to those who can attempt more a dip circle with compass attachment is furnished, with which compact outfit:knowing the azimuth of some reference mark from triangulation or other source, the declination, dip, and total intensity (by Lloyd's method) can be obtained with a fair degree of accuracy.
SEA WORK.

The Bache, Explorer, and Patterson are each provided with a Lloyd-Creak dip circle and accompanying gimbal stand, by means of which dip and total intensity can be determined on board ship. The Explorer ~nd Patterson are also provided with a magnetometer, so that the "intensity constant" of the dip circle may be determined at each place where shore observations are made. Observations for declination are made with the usual standard liquid compass and an azimuth circle of Ritchie or Negus pattern. A value of declination, dip, or intensity usually depends upon the mean of observations made on 8 or 16 equidistant headings while steaming in a circle, once with port and once with starboard helm. In some cases, however, observations are made on three headings and the results are corrected for the effect of the ship's magnetism by comparison with the observations made while swinging ship.
ACCURACY OF RESULTS.

The endeavor in general is to secure, on land, declination and dip observations whose absolute error (including everything involved--error of observation and reduction) shall not exceed ·2', and to determine the horizontal intensity within 1 part in 1 ooo. As stated in previous reports, the experience of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has been that, under all of the conditions involved in a campaign of field work covering a large area, including the standardization of instruments and the determination of reduction errors, this accuracy can not be much increased. In observatory work with special instruments, or when special investigations are made under the best conditions by special observers, there is no difficulty of reducing these limits of error, but in a large organization, where results must be secured from all kinds of observers, under all conditions, and at times under great physical difficulties, and when all sources of error are considered, the degree of accuracy stated must be regarded as satisfactory and sufficient. It happens, of course, that these limits, for one reason or another, are occasionally exceeded, and there may be a few isolated cases in which the errors are two or three times the amounts given.

COMPARISON OF INSTRUMENTS.

At the beginning of the systematic magnetic survey of the United States, in 1899, the importance was recognized of an intercomparison of the various absolute instruments used in the prosecution of the work. The results of some of the earlier comparisons were presented in a paper published in the journal "Terrestrial Magnetism" for May,
l90I.

These results emphasized the fact that the differences between different dip circles are sometimes too great to be neglected, especially where the observations may involve the determination of the secular change. The most reliable dip circle was selected as a provisional standard, and the results with other instruments were corrected to reduce to that standard. Since that time numerous comparisons of dip circles have been made, and with each publication of results there has been given a table showing the corrections applied to the different dip circles to reduce to the standard instrument, which, since November, 1903, has been the large Wild-Edelmann earth inductor at the Cheltenham Magnetic Observatory. These repeated comparisons have led to the conclusion that the correction required by a particular needle of a particular dip circle can not be considered constant even for the same magnetic latitude, and the practice has been adopted of revising the table of corrections each year to correspond to the latest comparisons. It has been recognized for some time that the correction required by a dip needle changes with a change in the magnetic latitude, and in the case of two circles requiring large corrections, which were used through a large range in dip, this fact has been taken into account and the corrections have been derived by means of a formula of the form F .J I= x + y sin I + z cos I. For the other instruments a constant correction has been used for each season's work, since the range in dip involved has usually been small. The differences in declination and horizontal intensity indicated by the results referred to in the article in "Terrestrial :Magnetism" were not greater than might be ascribed to errors of observation in magnetometers having wooden deflection bars and horizontal circles reading only to minutes. In 1901 the wooden deflection bars were replaced by bars of brass, and beginning with l 904, as fast as circumstances would permit, the older magnetometers have been supplied with new theodolites having horizontal circles reading directly to 20 11 and by estimation to 10", and the errors of observation have been much reduced. As the instrumental comparisons were continued from year to year with an increasing degree of accuracy, it soon became apparent that some of the magnetometers required corrections in horizontal intensity too great to be neglected. Beginning with April, l 901, an effort has been made to reduce horizontal intensity results to the same standard, at first taking account only of corrections which amounted to as much as l/500 of the horizontal intensity. Up to June, 1907, the same practice was adopted as for the dip circles, namely, to modify more or less, from year to year, the corrections used, to make them conform to the latest comparisons. The large Wild-Edelmann magnetometer at Cheltenham has been adopted as the standard instrument, and the corrections adopted for other magnetometers have depended largely upon direct comparisons with it.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1908.

The first occasion for applying a correction to declination with a magnetometer was in 1904, when a tabulation of numerous comparisons of magnetometer No. 19 with other magnetometers brought out the fact that results by it differed systematically from others by about 1'.5. An examination of the instrument revealed the presence of a piece of impure brass, and after the substitution of a new piece no correction was required. In 1907 the reduction of the work of the various magnetic observatories of the Coast and Geodetic Survey had progressed so far that it became important to determine definitely the relation between the various absolute instruments, in order that the published observatory results might be all referred to the same standard. This need was emphasized by the not infrequent standardization of magnetic instruments at the observatories of this Bureau by other organizations of this and other countries. With the exception of Baldwin, each observatory is now supplied with an earth inductor, which has been compared either directly or indirectly with the standard earth inductor at Cheltenham, the correction in no case exceeding 1'.o. The magnetometers at present in use at the other observatories (except Honolulu) have all been compared directly with the standard instrument at Cheltenham, and there have been numerous indirect comparisons by means of different field magnetometers. The results of the comparisons of various magnetometers at the observatories and in \Vashington (including also the results of some comparisons by means of simultaneous observations at other places) have been adjusted by the method of least squares. Weights have been assigned equal to the number of sets of observations, except that a set of observations away from an observatory is given half as much weight as one at an observatory. The observations at the two stations in Washington have been utilized by assuming constant differences between the two stations and Cheltenham. The results of declination comparisons with magnetometer No. 10 showed such a large range that they were not included in the general adjustment. Subsequent observations at Cheltenham failed to reveal any cause for such variation and the correction given helow was adopted, being the mean of 35 sets in 1908. A few other observations were thrown out for one reason or another. The results for some magnetometers were divided into two groups on account of change to the instrument or to the instrumental constants. The resulting corrections to reduce to magnetometer No. 26, the standard instrument at Cheltenham, are given in the following table. The declination correction is given the proper sign for east declination. The horizontal intensity correction is expressed in parts of H. It is the practice of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to determine the instrumental constants for each magnetometer: The deflection distances by direct measurement; the moment of inertia by means of oscillations alternately with and without an auxiliary inertia bar or ring of known dimensions and mass; the temperature coefficient from observations at high and low temperatures; the distribution coefficients from deflection observations at two or three distances; the induction coefficient according to Lamont's deflection method. Hence the observed difference in horizontal intensity between two magnetometers, aside from the errors of observation, may be due to error in the determination of the instrumental constants or impurity in the metal entering into the

The quantities inclosed in brackets were derived independently and not from the general adjustment. The corrections applied to the results of declination and horizontal intensity observations made during the fiscal year 1908 are the ones given in the above table, but no correction to declination has been applied if less than 0 1 .5, nor to horizontal intensity if less than 0.001 H. It will be seen that the horizontal intensity corrections arc nearly all positive, the average value, excluding magnetometer No. 21, being + 0.0012 1-/. This would indicate that the adopted standard is a little too high. The same conclusion was reached by Dr. L. A. Bauer, Director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution, as a result of the comparisons of the instruments of the Galilee at the observatories of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and at various foreign observatories during her cruises in the Pacific. It has been decided, however, to continue to use the Cheltenham Observatory magnetometer as the standard of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. A comparison between the observed and adjusted differences of declination and horizontal intensity is presented in the following table. In general, the agreement is very good-much better, in fact, than was anticipated. The tabulated differences in horizontal intensity are in parts of H multiplied by 10 ooo.

REDUCTION OF OBSERVATIONS.

A first computation is made by the observer in the field, and he is instructed to carry it far enough before he leaves a station to assure himself that the desired degree of accuracy has been attained. This computation is carefully revised in the Office, in the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, and the necessary corrections are applied to reduce the results to the standard instruments, as indicated in the foregoing section. Each value of the magnetic declination is then corrected to reduce it to the mean of the particular month in which the observation was made, with the aid of the continuous observations at the nearest magnetic observatory, allowance being made for the change in diurnal variation with change in magnetic latitude. No attempt has been made to correct the dip and horizontal intensity for diurnal variation.
ARRANGEMEN1' OF 1'ABLES.
LAND OBSERVATIONS.

The values of declination, dip, and horizontal intensity presented in Table I are' arranged by States alphabetically, the results for each State being given in the order of increasing latitudes. The latitudes and longitudes are in most cases the result of solar observations made with the small theodolite which forms a part of the magnetometer. In default of observations the geographic coordinates were scaled from the best available map, either the United States Geological Survey topographic sheets, a postroute map, or some other State map. In such cases only the nearest whole minute of latitude and longitude is given. The horizontal intensity is expressed as heretofore in terms of the one hundred thousandth part of a C. G. S. unit of intensity of magnetic force, termed a gamma, and designated by the letter y. In order to include the desired amount of information in the available space the following abbreviations were adopted. Only the month and day of the date are given, since the observations were all made between July 1, 1907, and June 30, 1908, except when otherwise stated in footnote. The names of the months have been abbreviated as follows:
January February March April Ja Fe Mh Ap May June July August My Je Jy Au September October November December

declination was determined with a compass declinometer of the numbel' given. When the declination was determined with the compass attachment of the dip circle the letter C is.placed in the magnetometer column. The dip circles have been given the designations indicated on page 83, the figures after the decimal point denoting the needles used. Values of horizontal intensity printed in italics were obtained by combining the observed dip with the total intensity determined by Lloyd's method. The observer is indicated by the initials of his name. The names of the observers are as follows:

a Observations in May nnd June, 1907, not heretofore published.

56687-08--7

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1908. RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS MADE IlY THE EXPLORER ON HER CRUISE FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE PACIFIC.

Mention was made in last year's Appendix of the magnetic observations made by the Explorer on her cruise from the Atlantic to the Pacific, but the records were not available in time to include the results in that publication. In view of the large number of observations and the wide range of latitude covered by the cruise, it will be of interest, in connection with a summary of the results, to give some account of the methods adopted to determine the instrumental constants of the ship dip circle and to allow for the effect of the ship's magnetism. The Explorer, in command of Assistant W. C. Dibrell, left Baltimore, Md., on February 20, 1907, and arrived at Seattle, Wash., on July 15, 1907. In addition to the usual equipment of compasses and azimuth circles, she was provided with a magnetometer and an L. C. dip circle and accompanying gimbal stand. Just before the beginning of the cruise the dip circle was remodeled in the manner explained on page 1 1 2, Appendix 3 for 1906, so as to permit using a greater distance for the deflection observations in equatorial regions, where the intensity of the earth's magnetic force is small. It was also provided with a new set of needles and .was restandardized at the Cheltenham Magnetic Observatory. The instructions for magnetic work during the cruise provided for ( 1) shore observations at each port where a stop was made for coal; (2) observations on board ship near these ports while swinging ship on 8 or 16 equidistant headings; C1) observations at sea while swinging ship on 8 equidistant headings, once a day, weather and coal supply permitting; (4) observations on the course and 2 points to port and starboard of the course as often as possible between swings. These instructions were executed in a very satisfactory manner, as will be seen by the following summary:

In addition to the determination of declination and horizontal intensity with the magnetometer and dip with the dip circle, the work at each shore station included observations with the dip circle to determine the relative total intensity by Lloyd's method. For the loaded dip observations, the same weight was used throughout the cruise, but it was changed from the south end of the needle to the north end at Rio de Janeiro and back to the south end at Chatham Island on the way north. At each of these places care was taken to make observations with the weight in each of the two positions, in order to determine the effect of the change. The deflection observations were made at two distances whenever it was possible. The observations on shipboard while swinging ship comprised standard compass bearings of the sun for declination and compass deviations, during both port and star-

board swings, deflection observations with dip circle while swinging to port and loaded dip observations while swinging to starboard. The arrangement of the observations is explained in greater detail in Appendix No. 3 for 1904. The course observations usually involved the same number of readings as a swing on 8 points, beginning with observations on the course, then 2 points to port, 2 points to starboard, and finally on the course again. The compass observations were made by Assistant Dibrell, the dip circle and shore observations by C. G. Quillian, assistant, and A. L. Giacomini, first watch officer. The results of the shore observations are presented in the following table. Descriptions of the stations occupied will be found at the end of this Appendix. Old stations were reoccupied whenever it was possible to do so.

The first difficulty encountered in the reduction of the observations was the determination of the correction to be applied to the dip results. The observations at Cheltenham showed that needles 5 and 6 of dip circle No. 34 required corrections at that place amounting to - 7'.9 and - r 1 '.6, respectively. Now, it is well known that the correction to a dip needle varies with change of dip, and this becomes an important consideration where the range is so great, as in the cruise of the Explorer, from 71° north to 50° south. Theoretically, the correction may be represented by an analytical expression of the form FLll=x+y sin l+z cos 1. For the evaluation of the three unknowns in this equation, observations are required at not less than three places where the correct value of the dip is known from observations with some other instrument, and, moreover, these places should cover approximately the range of dip for which the formula is to be used. Although magnetic observations had been made a number of times by other parties at most of the ports where the Explorer stopped for coal, it was impossible to get the data required for the solution of the above formula except at a fev. places. Either it was not possible to reoccupy the old station or the means were

100

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1908

lacking for correcting the earlier results for secular change or the results were not sufficiently accurate. In the United States the dip at San Diego and Seattle· is well determined as the result of observations with several other dip circles. At Rio de Janeiro the observations were made in the magnetic observatory connected with the meteorological department of the Brazilian Hydrographic Office, where magnetic observations are made regularly (dip about once a week) by naval officers, and their results were used for determining the correction to the Explorer dip circle. At Port Castries the observations "were made at the station established by the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution in July, 1905, and the Explorer station at Callao was also occupied by the officers of the Carnegie Institution yacht Galilee in March, 1908. It was thus possible to obtain the corrections required by the needles of the Explorer dip circle at six places, and therefrom to compute the unknown coefficients in the above equation by the method of le~st squares. As there appeared to be no systematic difference between the results wit~ the two needles, a single expression was derived from which to determine the mean of the corrections required by the two needles, namely, FLll= -8'.o -1'.r sinl+8'.6cosJ This gave corrections ranging from +z'.4 at Rio de Janeiro to - 10'.5 at Seattle. No regular dip observations were made on board ship, but the dip was derived from the deflection observations involved in the determination of total intensity, needle No. 7 being deflected by No. 8. The corrections required by needle !\ o. 7 were determined by means of comparisons with the regular dip needles·on shore, as follows:

It will be seen that, in general, a different correction is required according as the deflection observations are made at the long or the short distance. In the observations on board ship the short distance was used between Baltimore and Port Castries and between San Diego and Seattle. For the remainder of the cruise the deflection observations were made at the longer distance. An inspection of the tabular quantities shows little evidence of a systematic variation in the correction to needle No. 7. Instead, the indications are that it remained nearly constant for a considerable period and then changed abruptly, and this has been adopted as a basis for deriving the corrections for the dip results on board ship. For the determination of the intensity constant to be used in computing the total intensity from observations by J,loyd's method special observations were made at

There appears to have been some change in the consta;1ts after the observations at Cheltenham. The subsequent results show considerable range, but in general not more than is to be expected, when the large number of possible sources of error is considered. The change of the weight from one end of the loaded needle to the other had no welldefined effect. It was therefore decided to use a mean value of log C for each distance for the whole cruise, omitting the Cheltenham results but including the values obtained during the season's work in Alaska, which followed immediately after the completion of this cruise. Up to this point attention has been directed to the determination of what may be called the "instrumental constants" of the L. C. dip circle. There remains the more difficult problem of finding what corrections must be applied to the results of observations made on board ship in order to eliminate the effect of the ship's magnetism. A complete analysis of the magnetic efiect of the iron entering into the composition of the Explorer has not been attempted, as the observations while swinging ship and the shore observations are so well distributed throughout the cruise that a simpler treatment of the subject serves to obtain the required corrections with sufficient accuracy. The general theory of the analysis of the deviations due to the ship's magnetism has been treated so often that only a few points need be mentioned here. The deviation in declination, dip, or total intensity on any heading-that is, the effect of the ship's magnetism-may be represented approximately by an equation of the form

L1=A +B sin C +c cos C:+D sin

2

·t;+E cos

2

t;

in which C is the magnetic heading of the ship, counted from north around by east. The second member of this equation may be divided into three parts: A, which is constant for all headings; (B sin t; + C cos C), called the semicircular deviation, the values on two headings 180° apart being equal, but of opposite sign; (D sin 2 t; + E cos 2 C), called the quadrantal deviation, the values on two headings 90° apart being equal, but of opposite sign. It is apparent that when observations arc made on 8 or 16 equidistant headings the mean result is affected only by A, the constant part of the deviation . .For incomplete swings or course observations, the values of the coefficients B, C, D, E,

!02

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1908.

must be known in order to compute the deviation. Wherever observations during a complete swing are made near land in connection with shore observations, a value of A is obtained, which, in addition to errors of observation, is subject to the error which may arise from a difference in the earth's magnetism at the two points of observation. Observations during a complete swing, whether near land or at sea, furnish data for computing B, C, D, E. In the following table will be found the values of these approximate deviation coefficients for each of the three series of observations, declination, dip, and total intensity, together with the probable error of an observation on a single heading, as deduced from a comparison of the observed and computed deviations. The declination and dip coefficients are expressed in minutes, those for total intensity in units of the fourth decimal place of the C. G. S. system.

than to change in the magnetic condition of the ship, so that for computing the deviations for the course observations it is desirable to have suitable interpolation formulre, which will eliminate, at least partially, this irregular variation.

swing near a port furnishes the data for computing a value of i\. and µ,and from the different values ofµ the values of Kand R can be computed.

In the case of the other dip coefficients, B shows no systematic variation. The average value for the first part of the cruise is + 3 1 and for the last part + 18'. ·The variation in C appears to be quite systematic, though not according to theory. Graphical interpolation was resorted to, plotting the values of C as a function of the dip and drawing a smooth curve through the plotted points. D appears to be constant for the whole series, the average value being + 10'. E = 5 1 + 501 sin 2/. For total intensity the mean values, B = - 201 and D = - 4', were used for the whole cruise. Graphical interpolation was used for C and E, treating them as functions ·Of the dip. By the methods indicated above, the A coefficient was computed for each result for declination, dip, and total intensity, and the B, C, D, E coefficients for each course observation, after which the proper deviation correction was computed by the formula · LI= A+ B sin C+ C cos C+ D sin 2C + E cos 2C.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS. Magnetic observers are instructed to mark every station in as permanent a manner as possible, either with a stone or a post of some durable wood, so that it may be available for future occupation. They are also required to furnish a sufficiently detailed description to locate the station, even if the marking should be destroyed, and to deter-. mine the bearing of two or three prominent objects in addition to the one used as reference mark in the azimuth and declination observations. The information is given in abridged form 011 the following pages for each of the stations occupied during the year. Further detaib can usually be obtained upon application to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The usual method of marking a station is by a stone post about 3 feet long and 6 or 8 inches square, set so as to project an inch or two above ground, and lettered on top U. S. C. & G. S., with a drill hole in the center to mark the exact point. Whenever the local authorities desired, and were willing to bear the expense, a second stone was set to denote the true meridian. The descriptions are arranged alphabetically by States and by names of stations.
ALAilA'.\IA.
Li1:ingston, Sumter Cou11Jy.-The station of 1903 was reoccupied. To reach the station proceed 1 block southeast from the court-house square and then turn one-half block northeast; the station is in the street. It is 27.6 feet from the fence on the northwest, 54.2 feet from the fence on the southeast, and is about midway between the nearest intersecting streets. The station is marked by a limestone post 11 by 11 by 34 inches, set flush with the ground and roughly lettered on top U.S. C. S. The following true bearings were determined in 1903:

Mobile, Mobile County.-The station of 1905 was reoccupied. It is on the grounds of the Spring Hill College (Jesuit), 7 miles west of the Mobile court-house. It is near the southwest corner of the athletic grounds of the college and is 59.0 and 53.6 feet, respectively, fro111 the picket fences on the south and west lines of the grounds. It is also 230.2 feet from the lower left-hand corner of the west steps of the west wing of the main building. The station is marked by a limestone post 6 by 6 by 30 inches, set flush with the ground and lettered U.S. C. & G. S., 1905. The following true bearings were determined in 1905:
Cross on north end of college chapel (mark) _____________ . ____ 5 7 51. 1 east of north Rod on south gable of east wing of main hall____ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 54 41.3 east of north Base of cross on main hall_ __________________________________ 44 37.9 east of north

Selnw, Dallas County.-The station of 1903 was reoccupied. It is on the ground adjoining the colored Presbyterian Church and near the intersection of Robinson and Sylvan streets. It is 70.8 feet from the southwest corner and 82.3 feet from the northwest corner of the church building. As the station of 1903 would not be suitable for future magnetic observations, a new station was established in the northeast corner of the county fair grounds, about 1 }-;;' miles north of the center of the town and about three-fourths of a mile northwest of the old station. It is 84.5 feet west and 86. 3 feet south of the fence around the grounds, and 140 feet northeast of the fence around the inside of the race track. It is marked by a limestone post 6 by 8 by 33 inches, projecting about 1 2 inches above ground and lettered U. S. C. & G. S., 1903. The following true bearings were determined:
Cupola on court-house (mark) _____________________________ _ 9 38.2 west of south Baptist Church spire_ - - - - ________________________________ _ 11 48.4 west of south Spire of Methodist Episcopal Church _______________________ _ 13 29.3 west of south East edge at top.of town water tank _______________________ _ 2 47.0 east of south

Circle.-The station is on the west bank of the Yukon River, about one-half mile north of the town of Circle, just beyond the Indian village. It is 56 feet from the bank of the river, 67.5 feet from the northeast corner and 67.0 feet from the northwest corner of an unused log cabin. The following true bearings were determined:

Fort Egbert (Eagle).-The station of 1905 was reoccupied as nearly as could be determined. It is 57 feet north of the astronomic station and in the meridian line marked by the astronomic station and a post on the mountain north of the town. The mark used was the north monument of the meridian line, which is due north of the magnetic station. The astronomic station is marked by a 1-inch copper pipe set in the center of a cement block, which is set almost flush with the surface of the ground. The following true bearing was determined:
0

Fort Yukon.-The station is on the grounds of the Episcopal Mission, just in front and a little to the left of the new log church. It is 60 feet from the front left-hand corner of the church and about 150 feet from the river bank. The station is marked by a spruce post 4 inches in diameter, lettered U. S. and having a Winchester rifle shell as a center mark; the post projects 4 inches <>.hove the ground. The following true bearings were determined:

Iliamna Ray.-The station is about 1 650 feet south of Drift Point, about so feet back from highwater mark and about 5 feet above it. A post 10 inches in diameter and 8 feet long was set 4 feet in the ground as an observing stand for the astronomic observations. Islatzd, Yukon River.---;The station is located on the north shore of an island, about one-fourth of a mile from its upstream or eastern end. About 1 mile upstream from this point there is a bluff some 3<X> feet high on the left bank of the river. On the right bank of the river opposite the island there is a line of bluffs. As the banks of. the island change rapidly the station was not marked. The reference mark used in the observations was a point on the bluff across the river to the northward. This point has an inverted V-shaped apex, and bears 21° 25'.6 east of true north from the magnetic station. A little to the right of this point is a somewhat larger projecting point having a fiat top, the true bearing of which is 2 1° 34'.4 east of true north. The apex of an angular-shaped wall of rock threequarters of a mile downstream and just to the right of a small depression bears 55° 13'.8 west of true north. Ketchikan.-The station is on the northeastern end of Pennock Island, in front of and a little north of the northern Indian burial ground. It is about 60 yards from the encl of the island and about 5 yards from high-water mark. It is marked by a cement block about 1 foot square, projecting about 3 inches above the surface and lettered U. S. C. & G. S. 1907. The following true bearings were determined:
