UNITED STATES UOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 0FJ<'lCE,

Washingt.on., Decembm· 16, 1882. Srn: In accordance with law, and with the regulations of the Treasury Department, I ha·e the honor to submit herewith my report on the progress of the work of the Coast aml Geodetic Survey during the fiscal year ending witl1 Jnne, 1882.

PART I.
It will be seen from Appendix No. 1, in which is given an abstract of the localities of work and of the various operations in the field and afloat, that while the leading aims of the Survey, the security of navigation and thereby the promotion of commerce, have been kept steadily in view, other objects of the utmost value to the proper development of the work as related to its national importance and to its scientific accuracy have not been lost sight of. Hydrographic surveys have beeq prosecuted in the waters and off the coasts of fifteen States and two Territories; in the course of these surveys, dattgers to navigation have been discovered and mariners wa.rn(lll by notices widely disseminated; topographic surveys for the exact definition and delineation of shore line have been carried on in ten States and one Territory; a special topographic survey has been in progress in the District of Columbia; the triangulations, primary, secondary, or tertiary, wbich precede and form the basis of the two classes of work first named, have been advanced along the coasts and within the boundaries of twenty-one States and one Territory; included in this work has been the measurement of a primary base line. in California and the extension of the transcontinental triangulation along or near the thirty-ninth parallel, for connecting the survey of the Atlantic coast with tha.t of the Pacific, and incidentally for the measurement of au arc of the parallel; observations for latitude and azimuth have been made at important stations of the primary triangulation; longitude!!! of important cities in the interior St;a,t.es ;have been established by exchanges of telegraphic signals; lines of lel"eling of precision have boon ca.rried from a point on the Atlantic s·ea-boarcl towards a station on the Mississippi River; the valnes of the magnetic elements have been ascertained at many points previously nnoocnpied, and for purposes of comparison, and study of tbe secular change, at others before occupied; determinations of the force of gravity by pendulum experiments h~we been made; tidal observa.tioM a.t self-registering tidal stations on both the Atlantic a.nd Pacific ooa.sts have been recorded; the study of ocean currents has been L'Ontinued and lines of deep-sea soundings run with tempera~ ob86rva.tions for the further investigation of the phenomena. of the Gulf Stream.

UNITED ST.ATES COAST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY. GENER.AL STATEMENT OF PROGRESS.

The synopsis which is here presented of the operations in progress in the several localities of work during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1882, as stated in detail in the report~ is followed by a statement. of work proposed during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1884, with estimates of the amounts needed to accomplish it.
!.-FIELD-WORK.

ATLANTIC CoAsT.-During the year ending with .Tune, 1882, the work of the Survey has jnclnded the following operations upon the coasts and within the borders of the New England States: Topograpl1y and supplementary triangulation of Pleasant Bay and River, Me.; ropograpby of t11e shores of Harrington River, Flat Bay, Back Bay, and adjacent islands, Me.; topography of the shores of Narraguagus River, Pigeon Hill, and :N"arragnagus Ba~s, and the neighboring islapds, Me.; hydrographic survey of Goldsborough Bay and of Dyer's Bay, Me.; tidal obsenations with self-registering tide-gauge continued at Pulpit Cove, North Haven Island, Me.; examination of dangers in the vicinity of the harbors of' Gloucester and Salem, Mass.; changes off Pollock I~ip, coast of Massachusetts, and shoal in that vicinity examined for the Coast Pilot; absolute determinations of gravity by pendulum experiments at Cambridge, Mass.; occupation of stations at Mount Washington and Trask Hill for determining points in the triangulation of New Hampshire; stations occupied for the determination of points in the triangulation of Vermont; primary triangulation for the connection of Lake Champlain wit.b the survey of the coast; observations with self-registering tide-gauge continued at Providence, R. I.; determinations of buoys and location of oyster-beds for the Shell-Fish Commissioners of the State of Connecticut, and examim1tion of dangerous rock in the eastern entrance to Long Island Sound. Work on tile coasts and within the limits of the States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylyania, and Delaware bas included a hydrographic resurvey of part of the lower bay of New York; topography of the wc1:1t shore of the Hudson River from Haverstraw northward, and determination of points by triauguhttion for the topographical survey; re-marking of stations of the old triangulation of the Hudson River; reconnaissance and primary triangulation across the northern part of the State of .Xew York for connecting the triangulation of the Hudson River and Lake Champlain with that of Lake Ontario; line of geodesic leveling carried from Sandy Hook, N. J., to Hagerstown, Md.; reconnaissance and triangulation in the northern part of the State of New Jersey; topograpl1y of the coast of New .lersey continued from Hereford Inlet northward; examination of changes in Delaware andCbesapeake Bays, and verification of data for the Coast Pilot; hydrographic resurvey of Delaware Bay and River; ii;ivestigatfon of changes in that bay and river since earlier surveys continued; continuation of the triangulation of Delaware Bay and River, and of the topography of both shores of the river; determination of the position of the new City Hall, Philadelphia; and occupation of stations for determining points in the triangulation of Pennsylvania. Within the District of Columbia and the State of West Virginia, and upon the coasts and within the boundaries of the States of Maryland, Virginia, and North and South Carolina, the operations of the work have included a hydrographic resurvey of Chincoteague Shoals, coast of Virginia; special triangulation for the determination of points in the vicinity of Hampton Roads, Norfolk Harbor, and Elizabeth River, Va.; continuation of topographic survey, vicinity of Norfolk; hydrograpbic resurve;y of Norfolk Harbor; determination of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity at the station on Ca1)itol Hill, Washington, D.

magnetic declination, dip, and intensity at stations in Idaho; and verification of the northern boundary of Wyoming Territory. Special investigations relative to tidal action and the tidal theory, with other mathematical and physical researches, were prosecuted in England and in Europe; determinations of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were made at a number of stations on the northeastern coast of America.
II.-OF FIC E· WORK.

In the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office the progress made bas been commensurate with that of the field-work. All records of field-work pass into the office for reduction, discussion, and preparation for publication; these records may relate to reconnaissance for triangulation; to astronomical and magnetic observations; to base measurements, to the several classes of triangulation, to tidal observations, and to topographic and hydrographic surveys in the form of field sheets. In the office operations are included the drawing and engraving of charts from reduced copies of the original topographic and hydrographic maps; the electrotyping of engraved plates, the printing and issue of charts, and the maintenance of the instruments used in the Survey. Tide-tables of the principal ports of the United States for the year 1883 have been published; the drawings of fifty-one charts have been in progress, and of this number fourteen have been finished, including eleven charts for publication by photolithography. Four copper-plate engravings of charts, and twenty-one of sketches and illustrations have been begun; one hundred and thirty-two plates of charts have received corrections; the engraving of twenty-four plates of charts bas been con tinned; the plates of twenty-eight· charts and twenty.three sketches and illustrations have been completed. An aggregate of twenty-nine thousand and forty-nine charts has been issued; in this number were included fifteen thousand seven hundred and three sent to sale-agents, and seven thousand seven hundred and eighty-three supplied for the use of the several Departments of the Government. Twelve hundred and fifty copies of the Annual Report of the Superintendent, and eight hundred and fifty-five divisions of the Atlantic Coast Pilot, including sub-divisions, ha\·e been distributed. A second edition of Division B of this work, "Boston to New York," a third edition of Sub-division 3, "Penobscot Bay and Tributaries," and the first edition of Sub-division 14, "New York to Delaware Entrance," have been published.

FIGURE OF THE EARTH.

In a geodetic survey, extending over au area so large as that of the United States, the question of the size and figure of the earth becomes one of great importance. The results already reached in the regular progress of the survey, a.nd brought out by the comparisons of astronomical and geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths are of sufficient interest to stimulate further research. These determinations give the direction of the force of gravity; on the other hand and supplementary to tllese, pendulum experiments will -0.etermine the intensity of this force. With regard to the utility of pendulum work in its bearing upon the figure an1l density of the earth, no question can now arise. It is fully shown by the resumption of this work in recent years in the leacling Government surveys conduoted in India, Europe, and America.. And although different opinions have hitherto boon held, and are still held, as to the best and most economical modes of prosecuting gravity experiments, all geodesists agree that widely distributed pendulum stations, made strictly comparable by comparison of instruments and by adherence to uniform methods, will give results of the utmost value to geodesy and geology. The views on this subject submitted by Assistants Charles A. Schott and C. S. Peirce at a meeting held at this office in May, 1882, for an informal conference on gravity observations, will be found stated at length in Appendix No. 22, together with the .propositions formulated as the results of the conference and unanimously adopted by the participants. In another paper Assistant Peirce communicaties results obtained by him for foree of gravity. [Appendix No. 2$.]

ASTRONOMY.

In Appendix No. :.n is gi>eu a new reduction made by the late Dr. Powalky, at the charge of the Bache Fund of the National Academy of Sciences, of the places of one hundred and fifty stars observed by La Caille at the Cape of Good Hope and at Paris between the years 1749 and 1757. These determinations by La Caille-next to Bradley the most skillful observer of his day-bear to the southern portion of the starry heavens the same relation that those of Bradley do to the northern, and form the starting-point for researches on the proper motion of the sm1thern stars. But to make them wholly a>ailable for this purposP, a new reduction with the employment of modern constants was needed. This Dr. Powalk~-, with great labor, has successfully accomplished, and has completed a new catalogue for the epochs 1750 and 1830 of the stars between the South Pole and thirty degrees south declination that were ob~mrved by La Caille repeatedly wit.h two different instruments, a six-feet sector and a six-feet sextant. Since all of these stars have been re-observed in i·ecent years at Melbourne, and at the Cape of Good Hope, comparisons of La Caille's places with these determinations, and with those of Dr. B. A. Gould at Cordoba, will be of great scientific value.
MEASUREMENT OF PRIMARY BASE-LINE.

An account of the successful measurement of a primary base-line in Yolo County, California, with the new compensation ba!4e apparatus is given in Appendix No. 8 by Assistant George Davidson, under whose direction the measurement was made. Upon this base-line the practical working of the new apparatus was tested for the first time. It had been constructed at the office from plans designed by Assistant C. A. Schott, and is described by him in Appendix No. 7. A dit'lcussion of the results of the measurement will appear iu my next annual report.
GEODESIC LEVELING.

An investigation of the mean ocean level at Sandy Hook for the transcontinental line of geodf'sic leveling which starts from the Atlantic coast at that point will be found in Appendix No.11. This double line of levels, eleven hundred and twenty-five miles in length, passing through the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, is marked by permanent bench-marks referred to the level of the sea at all important points on the route, and at dist.ances apart ranging from two to forty miles. The value of the8e for local surveys is obvious. When this line of levels is complete from New York to San Francisco the benchmarks thus established will serve as base stations for determining heights of points in the interior along the line of transcontinental triangulation, for the relative elevations of which observations by barometer and of reciprocal zenith distances have already been made.
'l'ERRESTRI.AL MAGNE'l'ISM.

In pursuance of the plaus for a :,;ystematic investigation of the distribution of terrestrial magnetism in North America, involving the determination of the magnetic elements at stations widely 1:1eparated upon the northeastern coasts of the continent for comparison with observations made in similar latitudes upon the north western coasts, and also the derermination of these elements at stations properly distributed throughout the United States for the construction of a magnetic chart, special methods of research have from time t-0 time been organized since 1871. A collection of the results thus obtained was published a.s Appendix No. 9 to my last annual report. It has been deemed desirable, however, to give in detail in the present report (Appendix No. U) the records and results of magnetic observations made atr the charge of the Bache Fund of' the National Academy of Scienoes between 1871 and 1876, by observers trained under my direction, and supplied with instruments loaned by the Ooast and Geodetic .Survey Office at the request. of the National Academy. At the opening of the fiscal year 1881-'82 Lieut. S. W. Very, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sarvey, was at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on his way to Labrador and Newfoundland, in

6

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

accordance with instructions directing him to determine the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity at stations on the northeastern coast of America. Observations for these elements had been made in 1860 at Eclipse Harbor, near the northeastern extremity of the Labrador coast in connection with observations of the solar eclipse: this station was to be the northern limit of Lieutenant Very's expedition. The impossibility of obtaining transportation thither prevented the occupation of Eclipse Harbor, but by great perseverance and by the kindness of the captain of the mail steamer which makes an occasional trip to the outposts of civilization on that remote coast Lieutenant Very succeeded in reaching Nain, a Moravian settlement in Labrador. in latitude 560 33', longitude 61 o 41', a.nd obtained satisfactory observations. ~ Three other stations were occupied ou the Labrador coast; two in Newfoundland; one at Saint Pierre de Miquelon, at the entrance of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and seven in Nova Scotia. The results of these observations will add much to our knowledge of the distribution of terrestrial magnetism on the NorthAmericau Continent, and those made at stations prevfously occupied will be of value in the discussion of thwsecular change of the magnetic declination. The practical importance of a knowledge of the laws governing this change is shown by the fact that four editions of Assistant Schott's paper, discussing the secular variation of the magnetic declination in the United States and at some foreign stations, have been published, and to meet the public demand a fifth one has been prepared, which appears as Appendix No. 12 of this report. In the next Appendix is given an important paper by Mr. Schott upon the distribution of the magnetic declination in the United States at the epoch 1885.0.
EXPLORATION OF THE GULF STREAM.

The fa.cts brought out by the deep-sea soundings of Commander J. R. Bartlett, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, carried on in the steamer Blake during the summer of 1881 across the course of the Gulf Stream, will serve to increase the interest in further investigations of the area swept by that ocean current, and of the laws which control its action. With the aid of the Siemens electrical deep-sea thermometer, the surface and bottom temperatures taken with the soundings during the cruise of the Blake will be supplemented in another season by frequent series of temperatures at various depths, and the question of the bifurcation of the Stream into warm and cold bands, over which. some doubt has already been thrown, may be definitely settled. In Appendix No. 18 will be found a report by <Jommander Bartlett of tests which were made hy him of the actual working of this apparatus, in which the effect of changes of temperature in varying the resistance of metals to the passage of an electrical current is so ingeniously applied. A description of the apparatus with illustrations precedes Commander Bartlett's paper.
DEEP-SEA SOUNDINGS.

An account of the deep-sea soundings taken off the Atlantic coast of the United States between 1879and1883, in connection with the exploration of the Gulf Stream, is given in Appendix ~o. 19, which is accompanied by a chart showing the depth and temperatures actually observed.
STUDY OF BEND·EFFECTS IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI.

In connection with his duties as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, Assistant Henry Mitchell has made a study of the eftects of bends in the river upon its mean depth, and upon the channel depth and mean depth of cross-section, selecting for this purpose, as presenting the least anomalies and the most permanent characteristics, a portion of the Lower Mississippi extending from the forts (about seventy-five miles below New Orleans) to Point Houmas near Donaldsonville, a total dist.a.nee measured along the channel of a.bout one hundred and fifty-one miles. The conclusions reached by Mr. Mitchell are stated in Appendix No. 16.
INVESTIGATION OF FLUID MOTION.

The elucidation of certain problems pertaining to hydrodynamics, and more espooia.lly to the subject of the motion of vessels and of bodies such as pendulums moving totally immersed in fiuid,

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

has become desirable in relation to researches upon the tidal theory and to other questions arising in the progress of the survey, and demanding mathematical treatment of a high order. For the study of these problems with special reference to the best method of investigating them, and for the purpose of obtaining information that would be of service in the preparation of a comprehensive treatise on fluid motion, Dr. Thomas Craig, of the Uoast and Geodetic Survey, was directed to proceed to Europe, and to confer with some of the eminent physicists then in attendance upon the meeting of the British .Association for the Advancement of Science, at York. After an absence of five mouths in England and on the Continent, Dr. Oraig returned to this country in October, having accomplished the chief objects of his journey.
TIDES OF THE PACIFIC COAST.

An elaborate discussion of the tides of tlte Pacific coast by Professor "\Villiam Ferrel is given in Appendix No. 17. Tt iR bal'!ed upon observations recorded for a number of years past at San Diego, Cal., Astoria, Oreg., and Port Townsend, W. T., ul'!ing as data the hourly co-ordinates measured from the curves of' the self-registering tide-gauges at the above-named stations, and treating these by the method of harmonic analysis. Either for investigations of the tidal theory or for use in predicting the tide Professor Ferrel's results have great v~tlue.
SANDWICH ISLAND TIDES.

Tidal records from the self-registering tide-gauge, loaned by the Coast and Geodetic Snrve,y to the Superintendent of the Survey of the Sandwich Islands, have been received to the close of t.he year 1881, and the series is doubtless still in progress. This series of observations was begun in June, 1877, the gauge being established at Honolulu. The results obtained from them arnl their comparison with the Pacific coast tides will be of great interest in the general investigation of tbe .tides of the Pacific Ocean.
ESTIMATES.

The detailed estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1884, transmitted to the Department in November last, were accompanied by the following statement: "It will be observed that these estimates conform in the aggregate to the amount appropriated for the current fiscal year, and that they have been prepared in conformity with a requirement attached to that appropriation which provides that the pa;y of persons continuously employed in the field and office shall be specifically estimated for, and that the estimates for the work proposed to be done in the several localities shall be submitted in much greater detail than before. Hence the principal items of the estimates are not the same as before in form, although they are substantially the same in effect. "In making this change of form, an earnest endeavor has been made to meet the requirements of the law, while preserving a necessar~· degree of pliancy in the detail of work proposed to be done, and in the expenditure therefor. "The two principal items of the appropriation, as heretofore made, have been aggregate amounts for the survey of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and for the Pacific coast. They embraced the pay of all persons employed in making surveys in the :field, and in the work of the office, as well as all 'party expenses,' which comprise the pay of those temporarily employed as recorders, signal men, hands, cooks, drivers, or boatmen, as the case may be; the subsistence and transportation of the pa.rties, and all requisite materials, tents, boats, and all other necessary expenses incident to the work . ."In the new form of estimates herewith submitted, the expenditures are divided as follows: "1. General e:upenses for the survey of the coast, being party expenses as above defined. In the 'details of estimates' given below, each locality proposed to be surveyed, or class of work to be done, is specified, and the amount to be spent upon each is estimated. It is, of course, impmctica.ble to make such estimates with great accuracy far in advance, and some discretion must be left to the Superintendent to vary the a.mounts according to the character of the sea.son, or unforeseen requirements elsewhere; but this estimate will form the project for the year's work, to be adhered -

to as nearly as consistent with the best interests of the service, and of course the total amount appropriated under this head will not be exceeded. "2. Transcontinental geodetic work.-The estimate for the continuation of the transcontinental geodetic work, or triangulation to connect the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, conforms to the amount granted for the current year, hut an amount of $3,450 for the line of accurate levelinlg between the two oceans has been added to this item, and deducted from ihe preceding one. This line of extremely accurate levels will have reached half-way between New York aud San Francisco when this appropriation goes into effect. "3. Aid to State surveys.-For fnruis!ting points in aid of State surveys, same as heretofore. "4. Pay in .field.-This item provides for the pay of officers regularly employed in the work in conformity with paragraph 4 of the Regulations for the Government of the Coast and Geodetic Survey adopted by the Treasury Department. The actuaJ organization of the work is represented by the classification here given of assistants, subassistants, and aids, who constitute its normal surveying force, the development of which is the natural outgrowth of the needs of the conn try. "The six assistants who receive salaries between $3,000 and $4,000 have been in its service for an average time of forty years; the average term of service of the nineteen assistants who receive salaries between $2,000 and $2,90-0 is thirty years; that of the twenty-one assistants whose pay is between $1,500 and $1,900 is twenty years; the average length of service of the subassistants and aids is ten and five years, respectively. "5. Pay in office.-The e11tima.tes for this service are given in great detail as to the several branches of the office work, ~md require no further explanation. "6. Office e.xpenses.-For purchllise of materials, instruments, books, and all other expenditures necessary for the work of the office, not otherwise provided for, as recited in the details of estimates. "7. Rent of offices.-Same as heretofore. "8. Publication of records.-Same as heretofore. Tbe principal ohject in retaining this as a separate item is the direction that the work of publication shall be done a.t the Government Printing Office. "9. Repairs and maintenance of 1Jessel8.-Sa.me as heretofore. "The total of these estimates is $573,000, against $573,900 appropriated for the mureut fiscal year. "Jn addition to the above, I beg leave to submit and ask the sanction of the Department for an estimate of $100,000 for the construction of a steamship specially adapted for surveying the coast and sounds of Alaska Territory. The considerations whfoh have been presented in favor of this ap1wopriation are given with the details of estimates."

TREASURY DEPARTMENT, July 1, 1882. Sm: I have had the honor heretofore of transmitting you a communication to me relative to an appropriation for the building of a vessel for the purposes of" the Coast Survey" along the coast of Ala.ska. I also, in reply to a letter from you, informed you that in my opinion there was no vessel of the Revenue Marine service that could be used for the purpose above mentioned. I now have the further honor of handing to you another letter from Professor Hilganl, of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, on the same subject, and of saying that I am convinced that this effort on the part of that office is not mere pertinacity, but is mwe from a hearty belief in the needs of that branch of the public service and of the commercial marine interests of the country. From conversation with gentJemen connected with that branch of the service, and from some observation of facts, I am prepared to say that the Territory of Ala.ska is worthy of the attention and fostering care of Congress, and that no means consistent with a wise economy should be spared to bring it withiu the range of commercial enterprise and open its resources to the public reach and use. Doul>tless a survey and charting of the coast, straits, inlets, bays, and harbors, as perfect as may be, is an efficient means to that end, and vessels of suitable build and capacity are needful So much I am able to say unhesitatingly and of my own observation. The specific thing sought at the present is an appropriation of il00,000 for the building of a vessel. As to the need now for this I must rely upon the statements of those having the general matter in charge; and those stat.ements are well set forth in the accompanying letter of Professor Hilgard. They seem to me to be more than plausible as to the need of a vessel. I commend them to the attention of the committee, which is finally to judge whether the sum asked for can be afforded from the public moneys without inconvenience to other urgent demands upon the imblic moneys.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, Washing ton, Felm1ary 3, 1882. Sm : 'l'he rapillly growing commerce and navigation on the coast of Alaska warns ns of the importauce of making as early as possible more complete surveys of that coast than have hitherto been practicable with the means at the command of the Department. A co11sideration of what bas been done will show that great diligence has been used by this oflice since the acquisition of that Territory. A general map of the coast from previous Russian and British explorations and local surveys, a general chart of the coast, and an atlas of harbors in Alaska were published as early as 1869. A volume of sailing directions was compiled and published in 186!). More exact surrnys of important localities have since been made by this office, and thirty.eight charts from original surveys have been published. Two of these are from surveys made by United States uayal vessels on duty on that coast. A new and much enlarged edition of the Alaska Coast Pilot is in hand and over one hundred pages stereotyped, and fifteen charts illustrative of the same arc engraved and nearly ready for printing. Seven additional charts of hitherto unsurveyed localities are in hand for engraving from observations by tbe officers of the Survey, and the number of astronomical positions fixed and magnetic observa.tions preparing for publication is very large. In the mean time the i)eople on the Pacific coast are calling for a more rapid progress of the smTey on the northwestern coast, as is evidenced by memorials presented to Congress, copies of which are appended to this letter. In order to carry on the work to good advantage a new vessel especially adapted for the purpose is absolutely necessary. The required qualities of such a vessel are-size for carrying a comparatirnly large staff of officers and crew; capacity for a farge quantity of provisions and coal, which cannot be easily replaced during a long season's work; strength to resist damages liable on a dangerous and unknown coast, water-tight compartments being a necessary adjunct; speed to overcome the strong currents of the narrow channels; economy of fuel and proper sail-power, assisting in the saving of fuel when practicable, making it possible to maintain the field for the full length of the working season, and keeping the expenses within· tbe limits of the appropriation made by Congress. The plans for such a vessel have been prepared under the direction of my predecessor, Capt. U. P. Patterson, and tliis office is ready to make contracts, if authorized by Congress. 111 view of the foregoing conoiderations, I have the honor to request the Department to recom. mend to Congress a special appropriation for the construction of a vessel for these surveys, at a cost not exceeding the sum of $100,000. It is very desirable that the appropriation, if approved, be available at an early day, in order that, advantage may be taken of the surveying season of 1883. Ver~' respectfully, J. E. HILGARD,

Superintendent.

AND

GEODETIC SURVEY 0FF1CE, . Washington, June 29, 1882. Sm: On the 3d ef February I !iad the honor to address you a letter, asking that you would recommend to Congress an appropriation of $100,000 for the building and equipping of a vessel for the surYey of the coast of Alaska. · The matter was also urged by memorials from tl1e Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco, from the Geographical Society of tbe Pacific, and from the California Academy of Sciences. These memorials accompanied my letter. These documents were transmitted by you to Oongress, and no appropriation for the purpose proposed appearing in the sundry civil bill, I beg to recall the subject to your attention, because the commerc.ia1 necessities of the Pacific coast particularly demand a survey of the great interior passages

of Alaska, notorious for tlteir hidden and unknown dangers; and because the Coast 8urniy bas no vessel properly adapted and fitted for such duty. The Hassler is now there, I.mt is especially needed for the hydrography of the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington Territory. Urgent applications were made upon the Superintendent last year by the Chamber of Commerce and other commercial bodies for special surveys of such dangerous passages as Wmngell Strait, whereby several hundred miles are saved on each trip of tbe mail and coasting vessels. Since the date of my letter, I have alRo hatl the personal sta.temeuts of officers of the 8un-ey who hav~ been through tlwse waters, and who have given attentive oit11dy to the resources, requirements, and development of that country. The resources of Alaska are much greater than are generally known; for example, the area of her cod-fishing banks is estimated to be four times greater thau that. of the Banks of Newfoundland, and the coasts of the Archipelago Alexander embrace between eight thousand and nine thousand miles -clothed with timber of great size and excellent quality, which will be a source of supply wlwn all other sources are exhausted. Of the mineral wealth of the Territory the favorable reports ham been confirmed. The existing charts of this region are in a great measure founded upon those of Vancournr of 1792, and but recently the revenue cutter Corwin, when returning with the Rodgers expedition, struck upon unknown dangers. Added to the unreliable and misleading details of these charts, the dangers to navigation are increased by the heavy seas of these high n<n:them latitudes and the unusual amount of rain~~, thick, and foggy weather, together with the short daylight of winter. The number of vessels trading to these waters and the number of fishing a11d whaling ,·essels have yearly increased. · There are no trustworthy pilots for the interior straits of the Archipelago Alexander, for the Shumagin and Aleutian Islands, or for the approaches to the great rivers Yukon, Kriskorin, etc. The few English pifots for t1ie regular route from Fuca Strait to Sitka demand extraordinary remuneration (as high as five hundred dollars per month for Admiral C. P.R. Rodgers). For want of Government charts, companies trading to these waters are using private charts compiled from information obtained by their captains. In conRideration of these difficulties which beset the commercial community of the Pacific coast, the cost of insurance is unusually large and oppressive, and in winter it is Ilracticall,r prohibitory. We haveendeavore-d, with the very limited means at our disposal for Alaska, to meet some ot the most urgent wants of commerce by the examination of dangerous focalities, by the publication of sailing directions, the compilation of charts, observations of tides, etc. It must be evident, nevertheless, that little systematic work can be done without a vessel constructed aud equipped expressly for this duty, and whose whole time shall be de,·oted thereto. The Hassler, now tempo_ rarily in Alaska, is a single-shell iron vessel, not suited to these waters, as I have more explicitly detailed in my previous letter, and should she strike upon an unknown danger would doubtless be a total loss, just as the Suwanee was lost in Shadwell passage. The practical acquaintance of the officers of the Coast Survey with the waters of Alaska; their knowledge of the resources of the Territory, and their familiarity with the commercial demands of the Pacific coast for charts to aid navigation, conspire to give force to my request for this Yessel. Very respectfully, J. E. HILGARD, Superintendent. The Honorable SECRETA.RY oF THE TREASURY.

OBITUARY.

CARLILE P. PATTERSON, Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, died at Brent· wood, his home near Washington, D. C., on the 15th of August, 1881. Mr. Patterson was born at Shieldsborough, in the State of Mississippi, August 24, 1816. Entering the service of the United States as a midshipman in the Navy at t.he age of fourteen, npon reaching the grade of passed midshipman he was ordered to duty on the Ooast Survey during the superintendency of Mr. Hassler, and as lieutenant in 1846 he took charge of a hydrographic party in the Gulf of Mexico, under the direction of Superintendent Bache. · The earnestness and vigor with which the hydrographic work Wi Mobile Bay and Harbor was prosecuted by Lieutenant Patterson so impressed the citizens, that the corporate authorities, through the mayor of the city, ad1lressed a communication to him in December, 1847, as "commanding the party of the Coast Survey," expressing their gratification at the attention to the interests of the city manifested by the Superintendent and the officers 1mder his direction. While promptly acknowledging this communication in behalf of the Superintendent, Lieutenant Patterson was equally prompt in correcting an erroneous impression, and in stating that his own party was but one of several, naming the officers upon the accuracy of whose observations the value of his own results depended. At this time, war between the United States and Mexico was in progress, and the impulse to serve his country more immediately in the line of duty in his profession was one that Lieutenant Patterson could not resist. He asked permission from the Superintendent to retire temporarily from the Survey, in order to conduct an explosive flotilla, powerful enough to disable the great fortress which defended the Gulf approaches to Vera Cruz. He knew that the enterprise might be hazardous to himself personally, hut in his own view the results would be speedy and sure. His proposal the Superintendent thought it best to decline. Upon being relieved from duty on the Survey, l\Ir. Patterson's preference for pursuits that would fully enlist his constitutional activities led in 1850 to his retirement from the Navy, and his taking command of a Pacific mail steamship. In this and in other private business he continued till 1861, when the needs of' the country again demanded his services, and he accepted the position of Hydrographic Inspector in the Coast Survey, oftered him by Superintendent Ba<:he. In this capacity, the demands made upon his energies were arduous, the conrse of public ernnts calling for unusual efforts to meet calls from the Government for charts and information indispensable to operations afloat. The special fitness he manifested in devising plans in a time of great public emergency, and his close attention to every detail of their execution, won for Mr. Patterson the unrestricted confidence of his distinguished chief. This feeling wai,i shared by Professor Bache's successor, who took occasion n<>t infrequently to express his high apprecia· tion of the labors of the hydrographie inspector, referring particularly to his faithful a:qd comprehensive r,mggestions in the stimulatiag and developing of individual thought, and to his wise recommendations concerning commercial and maritime interests. Upon the resignation of Professor Peirce in February, 1874, Mr. Patterson was appointed. Superintendent. He brought to the performance of his duties au intimate acquaintance with the requirements of the work gained by his long training and wide experience in its service, and au earnest devotion to its interests as viewed by a man of strong will, sound judgment, and unre· mitting executive energy, determined to uphold a high standard of efficiency, and to spare no personal labor iu behalf of the needs of the Government. His tenure of the office· marked strongly an epoch in the history of the Survey. His predecessor, Bache, held in thought the plan of a triangulation along the Blue Ridge as essential to the completion of the work, but in his day restricted views prevailed in regard to public expenditure. Other impressions succeeded in time. Nations far inferior to our own had maps of their territory. The eminent mathematician, Peirce, had expanded the scope of the work, and a geodetic survey to span the continent, and to lay the foundation of a general map of the country had charms for a. mind like that of Patterson. He believed that results might be proportioned to thought preyiously given, and hence it was that in schemes for triangulation his patient study in advance ceased only when improvement in the plan was found to be impossible. He succeeded in

carrying out the policy of his predecessor and in preserving unbroken the organization of the Survey throughout a period of great commercial depression and of close retrenchment in every Government expenditure. His death is to be deplored as that of one who was great in spirit, gentle in his dealings, forbearing towards subordinates, magnanimous in the presence of equals, and himself the peer of _any in exalted character. All elements of tmthfulness, the height of manly courage, the most tender susceptibilities of human sympathy, were bis in large measure."'

OBITUARY.

THOMAS McDONNELL died at Washington, D. C., May 29, 1882, in the seventy-ninth year of his age. Mr. McDonnell's connection with the Coast Survey began in 1833, under the superintendency of.Mr. Hassler. He entered its service as artificer in the party of the Superintendent, acting also ·in the capacities of paymaster and quartermaster. Tbe unvarying fidelity and good judgment with which he discharged these duties oommended him to the respoot and confidence of his official superiors and won for him their friendship and esteem. For thirty-three years he served actively in the field, and was then placed in charge of the map and chart room of the office, a position which he held till his death. Having served under five successive Superintendents, and for a period of almost fifty years, Mr. :McDonnell's memory, which retained its powers unimpaired to the last, was well stored with recollections of persons and events of earlier days, and he was consulted in regard to them almoet as an oracle. Few of his ootemporaries on the Survey now survive him. His friends, while deeply lamenting his loss, are partly consoled for it by the reflection that he was spared to them long enough to reap the rewards which attend upon honorable old age.

PART II.
In the detailed recitals of field-work which follow, under the several heads of sections, are stated the localities in which work has been in progress, the names of the officers conducting it, and the kind of work executed, with brief notices of the results attained, following the same geographical order as that observed in Appendix No. 1. The report of the Assistant in charge of office and topography follows. In this is given a summary of the operations of the office during the fiscal year, with references to the appendix containing the detailed reports of the several office divisions. These papers will be found in Part III of this report, which includes, in a<lclition to them, other appendices of a scientific character, wherein are tliscussed certain methods and results of the Survey. References to some of the more important of these appendices have already been made in Part I. As my immediate adviser in matters pertaining to the details of the hydrographic branch of the service, and as Chief of the Hydrographic Division in the office, Commander C. M. Chester, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, remained on duty during the year. His report (Appendix No. 6) gives a list of naval officers on Coast-Survey duty; the number and names of the vessels belonging to the Survey, their commanders, and localities where occupied at the beginning of the fiscal year, and a summary of the work done by the hydrographic draughtsmen under his direction in the office. Commander Chester refers to the large number of charts corrected during the year, nearly four hundred, and calls attention to the hearty interest shown by the inspectors of the Light-Bouse Board in keeping the office supplied with the latest information on the subject of aids to navigation. Changes in the system of buoyage on some parts of the coast made necessary a large share of the corrections to charts, and involved much labor on the part of the assistant hydrographic inspector, Lieut. Richardson Clover, U. S. N., who succeeded Lieut. C. T. Hutchins, U. S. N., upon his detachment in July, 1881. The intelligent and zealous efforts of Lieutenant Clover were successfully directed t.owards keeping the cbfl.rt-room editions as closely up to date as practicable. SECTION I.

Topography of Pleasant Bay and River, Me.-The topographical survey of the shores of Pleasant Hay and River, coast of Maine, was assigned t.o Assistant 0. H. Boyd in June, 1881. He reached the field early in July, and finding that many of the stations of the triangulation of 1861 could not be recovered, made a supplementary triangulation to determine the points needed in plane-table work. The topography was 1'egun on the 23d of July, and prosecuted until the end of October, when the field-work closed. )fr. Boyd reports the seas()ll as au unfavorable one, there being an exceptional amount of fog and rain. His plane-table sheet extends from Cape Split, at the western entrance of Moos·a·bec Reach, Maine, to Addison's Point on Pleasant River, including the shores of Cape Split Harbor, and the islands at the entrance to Pleasant Bay. Mr. B. Bradbury, jr., served as Aid in the party during a portion of the season.

Hydrograpkic survey of Dyer's Bay and of Gouldsb<>rougk Bay; soundings in Skilli11r!'s Rfoer, Jfe..A.t the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, Lieut. H. G. 0. Colby, U.S. N., Assistaut iu the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was engaged with his party in the schooner Ea,gre in hyllrographic work upon the coast of Maine. Ha~ing completed the surveys of Rockland Harbor, and Muscle Ridge Uhannel, as mentioned in my last annual report, Lieutenant Colby finished in one dtiy the running of the additional lines of soundings required in Skilling's River. These lines were run at high water over flab:i that are bare at low water, .the tides l>eing reduced from a level found l>y comparison with the bench-mark at Salisbury Cove, Maine. Soundings were also taken around all wharves in the vicinity as nea.r high water as possible.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

On the 7tlJ of .July the surrey of Goulds borough Bay was begun. All ledges were carefully examined; fiats or places bare at low water were sonucled as near the times of high water as practicable. The work in Joy's Bay and in \Yest Bay or Gouldsborough Harbor was also done in this way. Lieutenant Colby rrmarks iu his report that there is a small boat channel through Joy's Ba~· to Steabeu at low water, aud also one to Gouldsborough through West Bay. The principal anchorag(· for yessels of medium size is just below Garden Point, where there is plenty of water and good holding ground, bnt vessels must lie inside of the chauncl clear of the tide. Large y. ssels would do well to anchor on the eastern edge of the channel below Rodgers Point. Tlrn tHle-gaug-e was 1->et up below Garden Point; tides were observed through one lu11ar month, and a benelHnark was established. Some a<l<litional soundings being necessary off Schoodic Head, on the eastern side of the entrauee to Freuchmau's Bay, to complde thP chart of that bay, this work was taken up August 10 aud t111isht'<l August 15. Th<· tidal ohserrn,t,ious were made at Prospect Harbor, and afterwards referred to the hench-mark at Gonhbborough Day. Lieutenant Colby then began, August 18, a L,ydrograpbic survey of Dyer's Bay, and completed it Octolwr 1, with the exeeption of so1ne work at hi~h water on the western shore of Petit Manan Poiut. For this the s«a was not smooth enoagh at any time during the season to obtain accurate results. All ledges and fiats bare at low water were carefully sounded as near high water as possible. E.ramination of dan[fCrs to nai1 igation -in the t·icinity of the harbors of Gloucester and Salem, .Ma.~.~.-Under instructions receiwd early in October, 1881., Lieutenant Colby proceeded with his party in the schoonn Eagre to Gloucester Harbor, Mass., and made a careful bydrographic examination of Dog nar, Hound Hock Shoal, and "Tehber's Rock. He then examined certain dangers to naYigation reported by l\Ir. G. ·r. Dexter of Boston as existing in Salem·Harbor, and fon1Hl iu some case::; leHs water than laid down upon the charts. Having completed this work, Lieut<>nant Colby elosed operatious for the season. B'1mninotion of <lan{/ers to rumigotion at the entranees of Ke:inebee River and Booth Bay, Me., and in Jfu.~dt Rid.17c Clurnncl and Ro('kland Harbor.-At the opening of the season in 1882, Lieutenant Colby was instrncte<l to make crrtain h,vdrogra11hic examinations upon the coast of Maine. He reached Fort Popliam, at tl1e entrance of the Kennehec Hiver, on the 26th of May, and at once began a search for a rock reported to be iu the channel to the northward of Pond Island Light. This rock was found, its position estalllislrnll, and the least water upou it ascertained to be 18.1 feet at mean low water. Search was also made, but without success, for a reported 12-foot spot 011 Stain~ Islau<l Ground, on the east side of Kennebec ltiver eutrauce. A bench-mark was established at I<'ort Popham, and obs(erYatious of tides were made during two weeks. A shoal spot wi:h hut 12 feet of water having been reported to the westward of Damiscove Island, off Bootll Bay entrance, it was found after due search, established in position, and the least depth at meau low water determined to be 11.3 feet. A spot was also found to the westward of Darnisco\·e Island called by the fishermen Damiscorn Rock; it was located, but not developed, as the shoa,lest spot found had 31.l feet at mean low water, with plent,y of water all around it. A JO-foot spot, reported between Squirrel and Fisherman's Islands, Booth Ba;y, was searched for at low water. The bottom eoultl be distinctly i:;eeu, ftll(l the least depth foun<l was 15.4 feet. Heron Ledge was next visited and a careful 1march made for the shoalest spot, upon which 5.2 foet of water were found. Observations for tides were taken at Booth Bay. where a bench-mark was established, and at Squirrel Island. A careful examination was made to determine the existence or non-existence of a rock marked on the chart of Saint George's River and Muscle Hidge Channel as ''Northwest Ledge," and referred to in the Atlantic Local Coast Pilot, subdivision 3 (third edition), pagf\ 253. This rock: could not be found. At the close of the fiscal year the party nuder the direction of Lieutenant Colby was engaged in Rockland Harbor, Me., in searching for several reported dangers. Additional lines of soundin&s were run for this pW"pose and for the verification of former work.

Examina,tion for the Coast Pilot of changes in sailfog linc.s, and of rPJ)()rtnl .~Jwal at the eastern entrance of Nantucket Sound.-Xear tile close of the fi8cal year, 188L-'8:!, it was decided hy the Light-House Board to change the position of the light-vessel off Pollock Rip, on account of changes in the shoals in Mouornoy Passage, aud as this would invol\·e alterations of considerable magnitude in the sailing-lines as laid down ou the charts and i11 t.lw Atlantic Coast Pilot, Assistant J. S. Bradford was instructed to make such hydrographic examinations of the proposed sailing· lines in the vicinity as were needful, and also to vcrifr the reported formation of au eighteen-foot shoal close to the position of the light vessel as then existing before removal. A.s8i8tant Bradford, having performed this duty, returned to the onice, and reRnmed his work upon the Coast Pilot. Earlier in the year he had made examinations of channeli> iu New York entrance, and in Delaware and Chesapeake Bays; these are referred to under the heads of Sections II and III. Mea.surement of the force of gravity.-Absolute determinatious of gnn-ity were made during the year by Assistant Charles S. Peirce at Cambridge, l\lass., at Baltimore, l\id., aud at \Y ashiugton, D.

Geodetic oporatwns fo, New Hampshire.-In continuation of the triangulation of the State of New Hampshire, Prof. E.T. Quimby, Acting Assistant, took the field at the beginning of the fiscal year, establishing his party upon Mount Washington. At this station measurements of horizontal and vertical angles were made nntil the close of September. The season at this station was remarkable for an almost uuinterrupted continuance of rain an<l. fog-, with severe thtrnder storms, during one of which the vertical circle, wb.icll was protected by a thin rubber eoYering, was struck by lightning. It was not seriously damaged, h11wever, the most marked dfect of the electricity being to cover the instrument with melted rubber, completel,y blackeniug it. Trask Hill, in \Volfeborough, Carroll C.>nnty, was next occupied, observations being begun October 12. A.t this station the weather was quite favorable, and early in NoYember, the observations hav:ing been completed, field-work was closed for the season.

year, and after establishing a station, "Chesterfield/' in the town of Ohesterfielrl, N. H., for counection with points in the scheme of triangulation of tlie southeastern part of Vermont, he established his observing· camp on Styles Peak 011 the 16th of ,JuJy, 1881. The observations at this station were completed on the 11th of Augnst, and on the 13th of August the occupation of (Hebe }\fountain was begun. This mountain is broad and heavily timbered, and lines of considerable length had to be cnt to open view8 of conneeting sfations. Much hazy and ,;moky weather delayed progress. Work at thi8 station was finished on the 21st of Se11tember, and on the 23d of the mouth the party was moved to White's Hill.

Prinwry triangulation for tltc connection of Lake Champlain with the surve.IJ oj the const.-At
the openiug of the fiscal .rear, Jnlr l, 1881, Assistant Richard D. Cutts was occupying a station ou Bigelow l\fountain, near KeeseYille, Essex County, NPw York, for the purpose of continuing the primary triangulation to the Canada line in order to complete the connect.ion of the survey of Lake Cliamplaiu with that of the coast. Heliotropers had been established at two stations in Vermont, Belle,·ue and Highgate, distant respectiYely from Bigelow 30.5 and 39.6 miles, and a tripod sig11al erected on Dannemora Mountain, Clinton Count.\·, New York, the positioll of which bad been approximately determined by reconnaissance. 'l'llis station, the last northern one in New York .· is au important point, ash was necessary that it should command Montreal and other points in Canada, the Green Mountains in Vermont, a.ml tihe northern Adirondack region. The weather having been favorable for observing, the work at Bigelow Station was finished by July 3, and on the 5th preparations were ma,de for moving the camp to Dannemora Mountain. On the same day, accompanied by an Aid, Assistant; Cutts started for Canada for the purpose of selecting the best available stations beyond the boundary line, with a view to a connection with the Saint Lawrence Hi\'er, and the extension of the arc of the meridian to Montreal. Reaching Montreal on the Gtlt instant, a careful examination was m:;,de of the mountain north and adjoining the city, known as :.\lonnt Hoyal, and the summit of the easterly knob was selected. At this point the professor of meteorology at McGill College had erecteu a stout pole, securely braced, and findrng that this could he utilized for the support of the heliotrope, an additional platform was ad<le(l for that im·trmuent, with the cordial assent f the presiilent and professor of meteorology of that iustitntiou. The height thus obtained being sufficientls great to oYerlook the 8Urrounding trees, Assistant Ontts found it unnece;,sary to avail himself of the permission kindly giyeu by the mayor of Montreal arnl the commissioners of the park to cut down or trim such trees as might interfere witl1 li11es of i:;ig-lit. Atb·r the lwliotrope had been placed in position, and actually observed upou from Dannemora, tlie center of tlw axis of the in>1tnunent was transforre<l to a copper bolt sunk in the rock, which was rPaelw<l about orw ancl a half feet helow the surface of the ground. Having erected a large tript>fl signal ou ?!fount .Tohnston, or Saint Gregoire, in the Province of Quebec, a solitary bill rising ahrnpt.ly from the plain to a height of eight hundred and forty.nine feet above tide, Assistant Cutts retnrru~d to Dannemora Station, and began observations on Jul~ 13. Heliotropes were found 1wcessar~" on Mount Royal, Canada, and at Highgate and Bellevue, Vt. The work at Dannemora was completed July 31, and the party and equipage were then tram;ferrecl to Bellevue Station, near St.. Albans, Vt. Heliotropes were established on Mount Ro~'al, and on Bigelow and Dannemora l\fountains. Observations were hegun August 8, and the station was completed August 31. The next, station occupied was Highgate, Vt. Heliotropers were founcl necessar.v at Bigelow and Dannem()ra Stations, New York, Work .at Highgate Station was finislied September 22, and field operations were .then closed for the season, four stations haYing been oecnpie(l aml completed, and the connection made be5ween Montreal and Fire Island Base through nearly five degrees of latitude.

Speciai hydro,qraphy.-In compliance with a request from the Commissioners of Shell Fisheries of the State of Connecticut for the tletail of im officer to co-operate with them in locating buoys defining the limits of oyster-beds, an<l in other work hearing upon the oystf'r interests, Assistant Gershom Bradford was int:itructed to proceed to New Ha,ren with his party in the schooner Palinurus soon after the beginning of the fiscal year. Upon his arrival, July 28, and after consultation with the Commissioners, Mr. Bradford found that the work immediately needed was the determination in position of a numher of buo,ys off New Haven ancl Milford, marking the corners of lots used for oyster-planting, which had been occupied previous to the organization of the Commission in June, 1881. From the month of New Haven Harbor these lots extended about two miles oft' shore, and from Southwest J,edge light-house about two miles to the eastward and three miles t-0 Lhe westward; also three miles off Pond Point between New Ha.-en aud Milford, Conn. The pecuniary value of these oyster-grounds being already large, and steadily on the increase, it was desirable that their limits should be marked with great precision. For shore-stations permanent objects, such as ·houses, beacons, light-houses, etc., were in all cases selected, and their positions were referrell by triangulation to points already known, the buoys being then located b;y the threepoint problem. Soundings were taken at each bnos, and specimens of the bottom secured when needful. The work was plotted upon a scale of 1-20,000. During its progress determinations were made of the positions of Branford beacon, and of the new light-house at Stratford Point. Assistant Bradford's report is accompanied by a copy of a map published by the Commissioners of Shell Fisheries to illustrate their report to the legislature of Connecticut, January, 1882. In this report and in the letters of Mr. J. P. Bogart, engineer to the Commissioners, ample acknowledgment is made of the value of Mr. Bradford's work. One extract will suffice: ''The aid thus rendered to the Commission is opportune, giving us a successful start in our work. The vigorous showing which the Commission is able to make, is in great measure due to the assistance derived from the Coast and Geodetic Surye;y." The season, beginning August 10, lasted till No\'ember 26, not including in that time an interval of nearly three weeks in October which was occupied iu other duty.

After the close of operations afloat, and until the end of March, 1882, Assistant Bradford was engaged in office-work. Early in April he was instruct,ed to resume his labors in co-operation with the Commissioners of Shell Fisheries, and taking charge of the scllooner Palin urns proc1eeded in her with his party to New Haven, Conn. The location of oyster-lots assigned io individuals upon new ground designated by the Commissioners, and extending well off shore from the Connecticut River westward to Stratford Point, was the work first required, and as a preliminary to this it became necessary to locate shore stations by triangulation. For points in the vicinity of Bridgeport, inclucling Bridgeport light-house, Stra,ford Shoal light-house, and Penfield Reef lighthouse, the base used was Black Rock light-house-Stratford Point light house. Shore-r1oints were also established by triangulation between Southwest Ledge light-house and Falkner's Island lighthouse. In June the establishment of buoys at the corrn·rs of oyster-lots was begun, and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. For this work the party had tlle use of a steamer furnished by the Commission. Two surveyors in their employ were detailed for several days for instruction in setting buoys. The method of setting them was substantially as follows: On application of persons owning contiguous lots, a day was set apart for them, and they were required to be ready with buoys and sinkers. The engineer of the Commission having plotted upon the Coast Survey project.ion the lots to be surveyed, the angles for the corners were carefully taken from the projec· tion with a protractor of the best make. On arrfring at the ground the vessel (steamer or boat) was placed upon the requirecl spot by angles with the sextant upon shore stations and the sinker dropped with buoy attached. 1'he buoys are slender spars of rough or sawed lumber, proportioned in length to the depth. They are usually suitably markecl, and are not of sufficient bulk to obstruct rntYigation. f{anges for position were taken by the party and by the owners themselves, so that the latter may replace them at least approximately in case of removal by accident or wear and tear. From the beginning of work in May to the close of the fiscal year the statistics of the work are as follows : Triangulation stations, number occupied ........................ - . - . .. . . . . . . . 17 Triangulation station:;, number determined. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 Angles measured, number of .......................... _. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 85 Buoys set, number of. ................. _...................... _. . . . . . . . . . . . . 196 Angles measured at bnoy:; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 428 As already mentioned, Mr. Bradford's work with the Fisueries Commissioners was for a time interrupted in October, 1881. He was instructed to locate and develop a rocky shoal off Shagwong Point, near the eastern end of Long Island. This shoal was found to be a daugeruus obstruction to navigation, several fishing steamers having already struck upon it. Owing to strong tidal currents which sweep over the shoal and to the heavy surf at Shagwong Point, making it difficult to land with a boat, tlle work was attended with some delays, but on the 22d October it was completed. l\Ir. Bradford found but seven and a half feet at mean low water upon one of the rocky points, and recommends in his report the placing of a danger-buoy on tlle southern edge of the shoal. With reference to the growth and culture of the oyster in the Long Island Sound beds which came under Mr. Bradford's immediate notice, he remarks upon the great dissimilarity of conditions governing their development from those which obtain in Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay beds are mostly natural; those off the shores of Connecticut are planted. The Chesapeake oyster is subject to tlte attack8 of different and probably less destructive enemies, while in the Sound the enemies of the oyster, notably the star-fish, would in time exterminate it were not the beds carefully watched. The natural beds in the Sound are worked almost entirely to furnish seed for planting. Many of the most intelligent o.vstermen advocate a "close time" on the natural beds, not during the spawning season, as in the Chesapeake, but just after that season is ended. And while it is thought that the Chesapeake oyster seldom recovers from "sanding,'' Mr. Bradford was repeatedly informed that on the Bridgeport natural beds the oysters are covered with sand in the storms of autumn and winter and work their way out in the spring.

8, 1S81, Lieutenant-Commander E. B. Thomas, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, in command of the steamer Bache, proceeded with his party in that vessel to make a resurvey of that portion of the entrance to New York Bay lying between Sandy Hook and Coney Island, including also an area of the lower Bay from a depth of four fathoms at low water outside to the eastern edge of the main ship channel, leading from Coney Island to the Narrows. Having established a bos: tide,-gauge on the wharf at Locust Grove, Gravesend Bay, for day observations for.comparison with the standard self-registering gauge at Sandy Hook and for use of its readings in temporar,y reductions of the soundings to check ea~h da~·'s work, LieutenantCommander Thomas determined the position of a sufficient number of o~jects for use as signals and began to run lines of soundings one hundred meters apart, crossing them b~· other lines at the same distance apart at right angles. Where a closer development of depths was required, as upon the ed{!;es of channels, special lines were run. With the aid of a steam launch loaned b~· the Na'\"y Department, the survey was vigorously prosem1ted to completion, and on October 24 the Bache returned to New York. Three hydrographic sheets embody the results of the work, two of New York Entmuce ou scales of l-Z0,000 and 1-10,000 and one of Rockaway Inlet on a scale of 1-5,00(), Lieutenaut-Oommander Thomas had the aid of the following named officers: Lieut.

Examination for the Coast Pilot of the buoys in the channels of New York Entrance.-In April, 1882, Assistant J. S. Bradford was directed to proceed to New York and examine the buoys in the Main. Gedney, South, Swa.Sh, and :East Channels in the lower Bay, with a view to the verification of their positions for the use of the Coast Pilot. Having performed this duty and made due report of the result of this examination, Mr. Bradford resumed the work of preparing for publication the third volume of the Atlantic Coast Pilot. Tidal observations.-The self-registering tide-gauge at Sandy Hook, established in 1875 upon the wharf of the New Jersey Southern Railroad Company, has been kept in successful operation during the year by Mr. J. W. Banford. Some tides are unavoidably lost. during very severe winters. A scale of one-tenth has been adopted for this gauge, so as to obtain a record of extreme high and low waters. Determination of the position of ligM-ships a.t tke entrance to New York Bay.-By instructions dated .February 17, 1882, Assistaat Charles Hosmer was directed to proceed to Saudy Hook, and, with the aid of Suhassistant D. B. Wainwright, determine the µositiou of the two light-ships aud the whistling buoy near the entran·ce to the Bay of New York. This duty was satisfactorily pe.rformed, and on February 28 Assistant Hosmer reported the return of himself and assistant to office duty. Topography and supplementary triangulation of tke shores of tke Hudson Ri1'er.-Early in July, 1881, Assistant H. L. Whiting took the field for the continuation of the resurvey of the shores of the Hudson River. His work began with the determination of a series of points hy triangulation, interpollltell with point.ii of the old triangulation, and extending along the western shore of the river from High Tor near the town of Haverstr.tw to the mountains 1Jack of West Point. These points, with those determined in 1880, cover the ground and range of the Highlands of the Hudson, including some of the hig\1est peaks, such as Dunderberg, Bear Mountain, Crow's Nest, and Storm King, and complete the triangulation needed on the west side of the river between the limits named. Assistant Whiting makes special mention in his report of the services rendered by Mr. Van Orden, Aid in bis party, in whose charge the details of the triangulation were pla.ced, and by whom it was executed with accuracy, economy, and despatch.

A topographical re-survey of the town of Haverstraw being demanded, and the change8 in its vicinity caused by the excavation of a large number of clay pits for the use of the extensive brick manufacoories making it desirable to overlap the former work, Mr. Whiting wok up the topography from the limits of his work of 1864, between Waldberg I.anding and Haverstraw, and extended it northward on the west side of the river tn and including the shore settlement aud landing of Tompkins Cove. Mr. Whitiug remarks that there is less character in the natural topography in this part of the survey than perhaps that of any locality of similar extent within the range of the Highlands, and that tll~ artificial <letail;;, while seemingly of minor importance, were yet of such a kind as to prevent any system of genemli£ation, and required tedioufl and perplexing labor in their determination and representation. Mr. Whiting had the aid of Subassistant W. I. Vinal during the season in topographical work nutil his detachment Novem!Jer J 7. 'fhe completion of an unfinished topographical sheet of the previous season in the vicinity of West Point had been assigned to Mr. Van Orden about the middle of October. He filled in the spaces back of West Point, and continued the topography northward along the slope of the Crow's Nest until November 23. At this 1late field operations were closed for the season.

In accordance with the provisions of an arrangement made with the governor of Massachusetts, and sanctione.d by the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Whiting takes service during a part of each year as a member of the BQard of Harbor and Laud Commissioners of the State of Massachusetts. He was occupied in the duties p~rtaining to this special assignment from December 1 till the close of the fiscal year. Special operations.-In view of the continuation of the topograpllical resurvey of the shores of the Hudson, it was deemed desirable to recover and re-mark as many of the stations of the former triangulation as practicable. Assisb111t F. H. Gerdes was assigned to this duty at the opening of the fiscal year, and visited the following name1l stations: Prospect Hill (1), north of Newburgh, and thence proceeding northward on the western o;twre of the river, Bingham, Golden Ridge, Deyo, Woolley, Stewart, Adams, Prospect Hill (~),and Terry; and on the eastern shore, beginning at SouU1 Beacou alHl proceeding northward, B;tld Hill, Underhill, Vervatin, Dennis, Lloyd, and Travers. Eutire changes of' topographical features amiouuted iu not a few cases for t.he difficulty of recovering old station-marks, some of the hills upon which the poiHts had been established having been cut down or covered by lmildiugs since 1862. Of the stations just enumerated, the following could not be found: Bingham, Golden Ridge, Deyo, Woolley, Adams, on the western side of the river, and on the eastern side, Bald Hill, Underhill, Dennis, and Travers. At stations Prospect Hill (1), Stewart, Prospect Hill (2), and 'ferry th~ stone cones originally put down as station marks were found in good order. Reference marks were est!l!blished wherever necessary, and at Prospect (1) and Terry granite monuments were erected. The cones at stations Lloyd and V ervatin were recovered in goo<l order; and at station Vervatin a granite monument was placed. For stations Bald Hill, ·woolley, and Dennis, which were not found, South Beacon, Stewart, and Lloyd can be readily substituted. Assistant Gerdel:! clo!'led his work towards the end of October. Primary triangulation for the oonneotion of Lake Champlain with the survey of the coast.-As already stated under the head of Section I, Assistant Richard D. Cutts, at the opening of the fiscal year, was about completing the occupation of Bigelow Station, Essex County, New York, one of the stations in the scheme of triangulation for the connection of the survey of Lake Champlain with that of tile .Atlantic coast.

previous to the occupation of "Bigelow," aud the opening of lines of sight, though attended b~" ma.ny difficulties arising from the nuusual height, steepness, a.nd inaccessibilit.r of the mountain sulllmits, had been satisfactorily accomplished by Prof. V. G. Barbour, of the University of Vermont, Acting Assistant. In tbeerectiou ofsignals, posting of beliotmpers, aud in other routine duties, Assistant Cutts acknowledges the able assistanee rendered by .l\lessrs. .McNicol, "Weston, . and Barber, students from the scientific schools of Dartmouth, N. H., and of the Dniversitr of Vermont. Mr.·T. A. l\foNicolservecl as foreman, and observed the vertical angles. EarJ.r in July the party was tm.nsferred to Dannemora Sration, Clinton County, :N"ew York. The details of the occupation of tbii:; station, and the subsequent movements of the party, with the statistics of field-work, have already been given under the head of Section I. Recminai,gsance and primary trimigul.atwn a,<ff()BS tlte northern part of tlte State of New rork.In continuation of the primary triangulatiou across the State of New York for the connection of the survey of Lake Champlain with that of Lake Ontario, Assistant C. 0. Boutelle, at the opening of the tiscal year, was occupying Otsego Station, near Cherry Valley, Otsego Uouut~-, New York. Starting from the base line, Prospect-Helderberg, which had been determined by Assistant Gutts, the scheme of triangulation as developed by the reconnaissance of pre\.ious seasons hall failed to make a thoroughly satisfootory connection with tile high i1eaks of thtsouthern Adirondooks. It was not till the latter part of July that a clear, sha.rply defined horizon gave Mr. Boutelle the opportunity he desired, enabling him to detocmine positiYely the intervisibility" of the line Pro:Spect-Otsego, and to discover a wooded summit near l\Iouut S1leculator, hut still higher, the arl()ption of which would greatly improve and simplify the plan of work. Mr. J. B. Boutelle, extra observer, was at onee dispatched to the locality of thi,,; summit, and found it to be one unknown to guides, tourists, or surveyors, and about five miles in a southel'ly direction from Speculator Mountain, about two huoored teet higher, and near a small lake called Lake Hamilton. A signal having been erected, observations were at once begun upon Hamilton, which was found to be well placed for a. point intermediate between Prospect a.ud Pen }fount. Progress at Otsego Station was much delayed by extensive forest fires to the north and west, so that at times the sun appeared as when seen through smoked glass. Observations having been completed on the 8th of September, Assistant Boutelle left Otsego on the 9th instant to join his party, who were preparing Hamilt;on for occupation. This station is near the town of '''ells, Hamilton County, New York. It preoonted some difficulties of access, being six: miles frolll any tra\·eled road and in a dense forest. Camp was established at La.ke Hamilton, one thousaml eight hundred and twenty feet above the sea, and one thousand four hundred and thirty feet below the station, three miles distant. The instruments and accessories ~eeded at the summit were sent up in mountain. carts over a'' narrow-gauge" road cut through the woods. By the 21st of September Mr. Boutelle was in reatliuess to observe, but it was not till early in October that clear weather enabled him t;o make fair progress with the work. During the oooupa.tion of this station there occurred a remarkable ease of detlectiou of a line of sight due to dlll'erence of temperature and density of the air oocasioned by an intervening obstacle. To q11ote from Mr. Boutelle's report: "The line Hamilton-Pen Mount is 72.5 kilometers long, and nearly due west in direction. Ge.nerally it runs from one hundred to seven hundred meters above the int.ervening country, the ht-ights ofthe termini being nine hundred and ninety-four and five hundred an<l fifty-seven meters above the sea. About twenty kilometers westerly from Hamiloon, the line grazes the tops of half a dozen tall trees upon the southerly edge of the summit of an isolated mountain near and weRt of Pisooo Lake. I was ·obliged to set the heliotrope at Pen Mount a.tan exoontrie position i11 order to observe it in series until I ooald find and eut the trees, and refer the exoontric point to the station by micrometric measures. The observations were made upon the heliotrope, on three afternooDS, and upon the magnesiwn light, oocupying the place of the heliotrope, upon three evenings. The holll'8 of observation were between two and five _p. m. upon the heliotrope and between seven and ten p. m. of the same days upon the ma.gneaium light." .The resulting angles with the reference mark were by ebaervations ~n the heliotrope 30".68, 32".2~ and 3111 .00, and ou the magnesium light 28" .JS, 21u.u, and 27".75, these being t.be means of flv:e awl six ~ries observed each aft6rnoon or ~vening, and presenting a me.an difference of direction of 3''.49.

Remarking that there is no possibility of' a difference in the observations on the reference mark by day or night, since the above observations upon Pen Mount were made both by day and night in series with other stations which show no such discrepancies, and with every other source of difference eliminated, Mr. Boutelle attributes this marked difference in direction to a bending of the line of sight from Hamilton around the isolated summit, and states that a similar anomaly was encountered in a line which he ohserved from Maryland Heights upon Peach Grove, Md. The obserrntions made at Hamilton from sunset tu midnight upon stations showing the magnesium light. signal were found to take the precedence in point of precision, the same degree of steadiness prevailing during that time upon all the lines as is found usually in day time only near sunset. Toward the close of October, hea''Y rains set iu, delaying the progress of the work. Obse1·vations were eompleted upon the 2d of November. Upwards of a week was occupied iu getting the instruments and camp equipage off the mountain and out of the forest, owing to the injury done to the forest roads by the incessant rains. On the 12th of' November, the party of Assistant Boutelle wa.s disbanded, Messrs. J. B. Boutelle and T. P. Borden, Aids, being directed to report for duty at the Coast and Geodetic Survey office. Geodesic leveUng.-For the purpose of referring t-0 the sea-level, the primary bench-mark of the line of transcontinental leveling which bad been started westward from Hagerstown, Md., in 1877, Assistant Andrew Braid took the field early in July, 1881, and ran a line of leveling of precision from the bench-mark at Sandy Hook to Hagerstown. The point of departure at Sand~· Hook was the bench.mark inside of the self-registering tide-gauge house, and the route followed thence washy way of the New Jersey Southern Railroad to Long Branch, and to Perth Amboy; thence, by way of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, to Bound Brook, N. J.; thence, by way of the New Jersey Central Railroad, to Easton and to Allentown, Pa.; thence to Reading and to Harrisburg, Pa., by way of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad; thence, by way of the Cumberland Valley Railroad, to Carlisle and Chambersburg, Pa., and to Hagerstown, Md. From Sandy Hook to Hagerstown, b~' the route followed, the distance is four hundred and fifty-five kilometers, or two hundred and eighty-three miles. For the purpose of compensating cumulative errors, and obtaining a final result between these two stations freed from error as far as practicable, the method of leveling pursued was that of double simultaneous lines with alternate i.;ecti_ons run in opposite directions. Testl4 were also made of the relative merits of this system as compared with single lines run iu opposite directions, a distance of thirty-four miles being run in a forward direction, and re-run in an opposite direction over the same ground. Three classes of bench·marks were establishe<l-primary, secondary, aud tertiary. The primary benches, designated by letters of the alphabet, and the secondaries by Roman numerals, are intended for permanent marks, and are for the most 1>art cut on public buildings or on piers of bridges. Occasionally, where this mode of marking was not practiuable, resort was had to stone blocks or posts set in the ground, at a depth sufficient to be secure from the action of frost. The tertiary bench-marks designated by Arabic numerals were but temporary marks established as ehecks during the measurement. Field operations were closed at Hagerstown on the 13th of December. During the winter and until April, 1882, Assistant Braid was engaged in bringing up to date the records and computations of his season's work. On the 11th of June he took the field again, with instructions which will be referre<l to under the head of Section XIV. In Appendix No. 11 is given an investigation lly Assistant Schott of the mean ocean level at Sandy Hook, t-0 which the primary bench-mark of this line of transcontinental leveling is referred. Geodetic operatwna in New Jersey.-Having arniled himself of an early opportunity of beginning field operations, Prof. E. A. Bowser, Acting Assistant, had made a recoqnaissance in Northern New Jersey before the opening of the fiscal year, with a view of extending the triangulation from the line Hambnrgh-Bald Hill northeastwardly toward the boundary line between ~ew Jersey and New York. The reconnaissance waB rendered difficult by the number of moantain ridges of nearly the same height and all thickly wooded, but was satisfactorily accomplished, and

on the fi1·st of Jtlly Professor Bowser had beeu for a month occupyiug Montana t:jtation, in \Ya.rre11 County, the signals at .;\fount Olive, Pickles, Big Rock, and Smith's Gap having been readjusted and signals erected at Haycook and Culver's Gap. Heliotropes were subsequently found necessary at Culver's Gap and Big Rock. The observations at Montana were completed August l.j, ~md the party wai,; transterre<l to . Culver's Gap, Sussex County. Heliotropes were placed at Mount Olive and .Montana, and a signal erected at High Point. This i;tation, in the ext,reme northwestern corner of the State, was ne:xt occupied, the observations at Culver's Gap having been completed September 10. Signals were put up at Bear Fort ~fountain, and on the 21st of October, the necessary obsernttions at High Point having been obtained, field work was closed for the season.

Topograpliy nnd triangulation.-For the continuation of the topography of the eoai:;t of Xew Jersey northward from the limits of his work of the preYious season, Assistant C. l\I. Bache had taken the field before the opening of the fi8cal ~·ear, and in the earlie1· part of the season wall occupied in establishing the trigonometrical points needed before the plane-table work could be taken up. The triangulation, which was completed August 2, extended from Two-l\Jile neach Station (2) to a point north of Townsend's Irilet.

Sub-assistant Joseph Hergesbeimer serrn<l in the party from July 1 to the close of the season. During the winter, Assistant Bache was ordered to take charge of a topographical party in the vicinity of Norfolk, Va. His services there will be referred to under the head of Section Ill. Hgdrvgrapkic e.xaminatiort.'1 for the Coast Pilot.-From July till October, 1881, Assistant J. S. Bradford was engaged in an examination of the inland waters between Delaware and Ohesapeake Bays, with a view to collect data for the third volume of the Atlantic Coast Pilot, which includes these bays and the coast between them. Such iucidenta.l re-examinations of the waters of t.hese bays were also made as were needful. Upon the completion of this work, Mr. Braclfor<l retumed to tbe office and resumed duty iu connection with the publication of the Ooast Pilot. Subdivision 15, Atlantic J;ocal Coiu;t Pilot, which incllldes Delaware Bay, is now nearly ready for publication. H11drographic re&urvej of Del.a1.c<ire Bay and River.-Liout. H. B. Mau~fiehl, lJ. 15. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, with his party, in the steamer Endeavor, was engage<l at the openinJ{ of the ft8cal year in a careful hydro graphic resurvey of Dela ware Biiy and Ri,er. The working sea.son of 1881 closed November 22, at which time two hydrographic sheets had been completed, the first one on a scale of 1-5,000, including that portion of the river from Cherry Island Flats to the range-lights on Doop-Water Point; the second on a scale of l-10,000, extending from N{~W Castle t;o a. point below Fort Delaware on Pea Palich Island. A third shoot, scale 1-107000, incJqding the river from Reedy Is1aud to a point near Thoroughfare Neck, was begun in A11gust and partly finished by the close of the season; work upon it was resumed, and the sheet comp1ete1l

The execution of tl1is scheme was intmsted to Assistant H. L. Marindin, in clmrgt\ of the sclJO()Uer Ready. His series of slmets hegau at a point on tlte river just below League Island, and ended at Bomhay Hook Umuls. 'l'he working 1'.\elliSon of 1881 closed witll the month of September, wheu the vessel was laid up for the winter, and Assistaut Marindin reported for duty to Assistant Henry Mitchell, availing himRclf of tlte data collected in his hydrographic work to prepare, under Assistant Mitchell's direction, a comparison of the surveys of the Delaware River. In this work and in finisliing tl1e hydrographic sheets of the previous season, Assistant :\farimlin was occupied until early in May, 1882, when he 111a1le preparations to resume work m1 the Delaware River. Leaving Philadelphia on tl1e Uth of ~fay in the Rea<ly, Mr. Ma.rin<lin began his survey off Bomlmy Hook on the last sheet of the series, and was so engaged at the close of the fiscal year. The rl·snlts of this survey are shown upon six finished ltydrogra.phic sheets, four of them upon a. iwale of 1-5,000, and two upon a scale of 1-10,000. Firn tide gauges were set up for the determination of the plane of reference for the soundings; permanent bench-marks were established at all the tide-gauge stations, and described in the records; the planes of reference were carried from one gauge to another by simultaneous observations of the range of tides. Assistant 1t!arimliu had the aid of Engineer C. II. Amsden, and E. 11. Katz, U. S. N., duriug the season of 1881. Sub-assistant \V. I. Vinal joined the party at the opening of tlte sea.sOn of Jl\8~, and with Ensign Katz rendered very effective sen·ice. The statistics of the work are:

A snn·ey of the .Delaware River made in 1819 hy order of the councils of the city of Philadelphia has bee11 compared with more recent surveys in a paper prepan~1l by Mr. Marindin, and 1mblished as Appendix: No. 15 to this report. Triangulation of Delaware 'Bay an<l Rii·er.-In order to determine the positions of stations needed in the topographic aml hydrographie resurvey of Delaware Bay and River, which was in progress at the opening of the fiscal year, Assistant S. U. McCorkle was instructed to take the field for the completion of the triangulation from New Castle to Cape May. With the aid of the old stations, it was thongl1t that but few consecutive new stations would be required. Finding that a number of large signals had been erected by the Uip.ted States Engineer Oorps for the purposes of their works of local improvement, and at or near the old Coast Survey points, Mr. MeCorkle availed himself of these signals as far as pmcticabkl. Starting from the bMe Masonic Hall-Kelly's Point near New Castle, he continued down the river to the line Nerny'sStony Point below Reedy Island light. On making search for the points of Assistant Sullivan's triangulation of 1875, between Finn't:i Point and Port Penn, but five of them eonld be identified. The gale 'Of 1878 had done great damage on t.be shores of the river, washing a.way i11 one ~lace as much as twenty feet of solid ground. Mr. Mccorkle remarks that above Bombay Hook the points located on sandy shores are a.pt to be lost by the action of the "sand-diggers." He bad obaen'ed upon "!Jiston's" a very large signal in Jnly, and in October it had disappeared and the sand bill

with it. A vessel was moon:d along shore, (,a.king in sa.nd. La.ter in the season, "}Ir. Mccorkle moved to Collins Beach Station, and subsequently proceeded to Fortescue Be.a.ch, whence he continued the triangulation down the Jersey shore as far as Cape May light-house, measuring an angle at this point also for the determination of azimuth. Following are the statistics of the work: Number of stations occupied ...................................... ~. .. . . . . . . .. . . . . 22 Number of angles measured.. . . . . . . . . .......................... - . . . . . . . . 150 Number of observation8 ......... __ . . . . . . . . . . _. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1, 800
As early in the sea11011 of 1882 as the appropriation woulll permit, Assistant A. T. l\fosman took up this triauguhition with instructions to 1m~l1 it to completion. Mr. W. B. Fairfielrl was ordered to report to him for duty a.s extra observer. :I'opo,qrapMc resurvey o/ lite shores (~( tlte /Jelaware iUtJer.-In continna.tion of the topographic i·estirvey of the Xew ,Jersey shore of tl1e Delaware Hiver, Assistant R. :M:. Bache took up the work from the limits of th:tt of the preceding 8eason, beginning j11st before the opening of tlie fhwal year at Raccoon Creek, opposite Chester, Pa., and carrying it to Kelly's Point, opposite New Castle, Del. The survey is comprised in five sheets, upon a scale of 1-5,000, four of which were completed when the season closed; upoa the fifth the shore-line was finished and part of the interior. At the beginning of' the season of 1882, Assistant Bache, having sent to the office his four completed sheets, resumed work upon the nnfinishe(l sheet of last sea8on.

Topographic resurrey of the skores of tke Delaware River.-Assistant C. T. Iardella, at the beginning of the fiscal rear, was engaged in continuing the topographic resun·ey of the Penns~·}. va.nia and Delaware shores of the Delaware River, from the limits of his work of the previous season. His snrrn.r is cornprise<l in th·e sheets, sc;ile 1-5,000, extending from Chester, Pa., to New Castle, Del. \Vith refereuce to the cllaracter of the country, Mr. Iardella remarks that it ii; quite flat from Yarnall's Point in the vicinity of Chester for some distance in t11e interior, and np to the boundary line separating Pennsylvania from Delaware. After leaving this line the country in tl1e vicinity of Claymont, Del., gradually increases in height from about sixty feet to one hundred and forty feet, and at Bellevue rises to three hundred aml sixt.r feet, declining thence to Edgemoo1·, about three miles northeast of Wilmington. where it is perfectly fiat, and remains so to the Christiana River. Between Christiana and New Castle there are, in some places, ele\·ations of sixty feet.

Assistant Iardella, towards the close of the fiscal year, made prepal".i.tions for resuming this topographic survey. ~ ~ngulation..-In oomplianoo with a. reqaest from the authorities of the city of Philadelphia, Assistant Spencer C. McCorkle was directed ia January, 1881, to determine the position of the center of the new city hall, in th.at eity. Tbl'I center being in the court-ya.rd, and the building not yet ootnphlted, Mr. McCorkle ~ta.blisbed an obli!erving station upon the sixth fioor of the south center pavilion, referri'ng it t.o the eenter by t.~ plans of the al'Ohitoot. Detiennining the position of his station from the lines Girard College-Commissioners Hall {Kensington), a.nd Girard College-

Assistant l\lcCorkle expresses his obligations for facilities otlerell and aiu supplied b~- Mr. Samuel L. Smedley, chief engineer and surrnyor of the city, and by Mr. John McArthur, jr., the arcbirect of the new city hall. Goodetic opemtions iti Peruisylt,ania.-Prof. l\fanstield Merriman, Acting Assistant, having been directed to take charge of the triangulation of the State of Pennsylvania, completed the preparations necessary for taking the field early in J ul.r. He occupied in succession the stations Smith's Gap to the eastward of the Lehigh \Yater Gap and Beartown in Lancaster County, clo1'ing field operations on the 6th of September. The occupation of these two stations suffic&l to correct errors in triangles depending upon them ; which in measurements n;ade in a former season had been found to exceed the limit of error adrnisiible in work of this class. Having found that Blackspot Station was in clanger of being lost, Professor Merriman established reference points, and made measurements needful to preserve its location. The records and computations of his work hlwe been transmitted to the office.

Hydroyraphic rex1m:ey of Chineoteaf11te Slwals.-At the beginning of the fiscal year, Assistant Gershom Bradford, with the party under his charge in tl1e schooner Palinnrns, was engaged in making a resurvey of Chincoteague Shoals, off the co<Lst of Virginia, in order to develop the changes that had taken place smce the surve~- of 1851, and to obtain data for a chart of these shoals showing their present condition. }fr. Bradford found several marked changes. From a point about a mile and a quarter to the southeastward of ARsateague light house, Fisl1ing Point bad extended nearly a mile and three11 uarters inn sonth-sonthwest direction towards Ship Sho:tl, forming a cove or anchorage to the west. It seems probable that this extension is still going on, sinee a narrow ridge upon which are eon1<tant hreaker·s makes out about fifty yards south-southwest from the end of the point. Tlte enrrns of least depth 011 Ship Shoal have moved southwestwardly, and from the comparison of the sur\'eys and the testimony of the pilot8 there can be little doubt that minor changes are in inogress in and near it. The nine.foot spot, bearing south a little west;erly from the light-house, and known as Tumer's Lump, has disappeared, and the shoal of which it formed a part has moved ·~bout half a mile westerly. The South Shoal, lying four and a quarter miles south of the lighthouse, has the same general form aml direction as in the old survey, but has moved its whole length three-fourths of a mile to the westward, and a slight increase of depth was observed, there heing nine and a half foet inste.'td of nine as formerly. Changes of a minor character have takeu place in Southeast Ridge, a shoal 1;\'ing three and one-quarter miles south-southeast of the light-house. Mr. Bradford determined the 11osition of a black can-buoy, which was placed in 1msition just before the resurvey to mark the South Sltoal, the most dangerous of all. While the risk to vessels bound into Chincoteague Inlet, or under Fishing Point for shelter, is leRsened, it is not wholly removed by the placing of this buoy, and Mr. Bradford recommends, therefore, that a danger buoy be placed one-fourth of a mile southwestward of the western end of the South Shoal. Practi· cable channels exist at present inside of the South Shoal and inside the Southeast Ridge, but in view of the changes that have occurred and are likely to occur in the stormy season, it is recommended in Mr. Bradford's report that vesse18 without a pilot be warned to avoid the inside passage, aml that Ship Shoal buoy be changetl from a red to a danger bnoy as a further warning. Tidal observations were macle near the mouth of Chincoteague Inlet, and the plane of reference deduced was referred to that of the gauge at ChinMtea.gue lslan<l, established in 1880.

Colouna proceeded to Norfolk, \ra., and made the necessary preparationl'I for ex:tending the tri.rngnlatiou in tl..tat '"icinity in order to furnish points for the topography to be executed in the \"icinity of Craney Island and Tanner's Creek, and for the bydrographic snn·ey of~orfolk Harbor and Elizabeth Rh·er. Having searched in vain for stations of tl1e former triangulation of that river, but two of which, e:iwlnsive of lighthouses, could be found, 1\Ir. Colonna erected sigrmls prepara.tory to makiug a new triangulatio11. which he finalJy based upon the line of 1869, Newport News-Craney Island, east base. In connection with this work, he determined the geographical position of the new light-houses at the mouth of t11e Nansemond River and at Cape Henry, and furnished to the office a topographical sketch of the improvements at Fortress Monroe and at Newport News.

Upon leaving Norfolk, Assistant Colonna was direct~d to return to the office and resume dut.r which will be referred to under the head of 8ection XVII. Continuation of topographical .~urvey, -ni..cinity of Norfolk.-Assistant C. M. Bache reachetl Norfolk, Va., February 14, 188:?, with instructions to continue the topography of the \·foinity of Norfolk from Fort Xorfolk northward to Tanner's Creek. This portion of his work was finishe<l April 12, and, in compliance with additional iwstructions, Mr. Bache filled in an unsurveyed spot near Ocean View; sun·eyed the right bank of Tanner's Creek below Indiau Pole Bridge, aud filled in the topography of the conutrs on the western side of the Elizabeth River.

The results are shown upon two hydrographic sheets, inclmling Xorfolk Harbor and Elizabeth River, on scales of 1-51000 and 1-101000 respectively. Lieutenant-Commander Thomas had the aid of the following-named officers: Lieut. C. C· Cornwell, U.S. N.; Master F. A. Wilner, U.S. N.; Master H.F. Reich, U.S. N.; Ensign E. M. Katz, U.S. N.; Ensign H. 1\1. Witzel, U. S. ~.; and Ensign J . .M. Orchard, U.S. N. Later in the season Lieutenant-Commander Thomas took up duty which will be referred to under the head of Section VI. Hydrographic examinations for tlie Coast Pilot.-As already stated under the head of Section Il, the inland waters between Delaware and Chesapeake Bays and the bays themselves were examined during that part of the fiscal ;rear preceding October, 1881, by Assistant J. S. Bradford, with a view of collecting data. for the third volume of the Atlantic Coast Pilot.. Mr. Bradford's examinations were directed to ail localities where he had reason to expect changes of importance either in t<>pographical features, sailing directions, or positions of dangers, so as to bring the manuscript of the volum(J up w the latest date practicable previous to publication. In this connection the office labors of the party under his charge may be referred to. Iu addition to the work on the third volume of t,be Coast Pilot, subdivision ;J of that work, including Penobscot Bay and tributaries, was revised, printed, and published in a uew edition; subdivision 14, embracing the coast between New York and Delaware Entrance, was completed and published; twenty-six views of the coast were drawn and etchetl <luring· the vear by Mr. John R. Barker. This skillful. draughtsman ha.<1 completed in all one hundred and ten ;iews for the Coast Pilot iu a most satisfa-0tory mauner sinee bis employment in this branch of the service. During the year he finished fonr Yiewr; for the Topographical l\fannal under the direction of Assistant E. Hergesheimer. Much time was devoted in the office by Mr.Bradfor(l and his chief assistant, Mr. J. W. Parsons, to the revision and preparation for publication of the Table of Depth8 in tbe Harbors on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, a work i11vold11g great care and labor. 'l'he party was engaged, also, in the preparation of an elaborate article for the J,ight-Housc Board, showing the differences in names and geographical positions of points on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts between the publica· tionli of the Board and those of the Coast and Geodetic Surrny. rnder the direction of Mr. Bradford, '.\tr. G. A. l\lorrisou was engaged upon clerical dut;y during the year, chiefly in collating from Yolnrnes I and II and arranging in convenient form the index for the forthcoming North Atlantic Coa8t Pilot (Eastport to Baltimore), which embraces within its limits Volumes I, H, and III of the first series. "lfagrietic obsCT1Jations.-The usual annual determinations of tlrn magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were made at the W ashingtou magnetfo observatory in charge of Assistant 0. A. Schott. These observatious were taken Juue 15, 16, and 17, 1881, by Assistant William Eimbeck, and the results indicate a conformity with the laws of secular change heretofore recognized. The observ. atory was also used by Lieut. S. ,V. Very, t'". S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, to establish the constants of ir1tenf!ity for hii:; magnetic work on the northeastern coast of .America.. Subassi11tant J. B. Baylor also made use of the observatory for testing instrumental constants. Force of grai.-ity.-Absolute determinations of gravity were made during the year at Cambridge l\lass. (see Section I), at Baltimore, Md., and at Washington, D. C. At Baltimore a series of experiments was made to determine the influence of the walls of the Geneva receiver upon the period of oscillation of a pendulum swinging within it. Four invariable reversible pendulums were made in the office upon a new pattern. The distance between the knife-edges of three of these is oue meter, and for the fourth one yard. Mr. Peirce had the aid during parts of the year 6f Ai;i8istaut Eclwiu Smith, and of Messrs. E. D. Preston and H. Farquhar. In April, 1882, l\Iajor J. Herschel, U. K, of the India Snrvey, came w this country under the dirootion of his Government, to oscillate the Kater invariable pendulums at Hoboken, N. J., a.nd at Washington, D. O., t.hus connecting the American pendulum work with the English. Advantage was taken of the presence of 1\Iajor Herschel to hold an informal eonferenoo on the subject of pendulum work with special referenet.~ to its future prosecution in the Coast and Geodetie Survey by the most desirable methods, and by plans involving the greatest eoonomy 'oottsiatent with scientific ooeura~y. At this Mnferenee there wet'e present, together with Major Hersahel, the

Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and Assistants George David:son, t;, A. Schott, and C. S. Peirce, on the part of geodesy; and Professor Simon Newcomb, Superintendent of tlw Nauti cal .Almanac, on the part of astronomy. Major J. W. Powen, Director of the l:' nited States Geological Survey (invited to attend on the part of geology), was unable to cume. After an extended discussion, the conclusions arrived at haviug been formulated in se\·eral pro11ositiom; and unanimously adopted, the conference adjourned. For a statement of these conclusions see Appendix No. 22. Tewgraphic longitudes.-At the opening· of the fiscal year the longitude partie.s iu charge respectively of Assistants G. W. De~m and Edwin Smith were established atCharlestowu, ·w. Va., and Washington, D. C. .At the instanc<i of Assista11t Dean, special inst.ruction:,; had been giYen by Mr. C. W. Smith, general mam1ger of the Chesapeake aud Ohio Railway, au<l hy Mess1·s. J. \Y. Kates and·Davi<l Flannery, superintendent and assistant $uperintendent of the ·westeru U uion Telegraph Company, to all operators on the line to afford every facility for the exchange of longitude signals, and notwithstanding the bad condition of a portion of the line, an excliange was effected on one night, but a severe storm followetl, and immellia'.ely after that the continued occnpatiou of all lines centering at Washington by the event of the 2d of .T uly rendered it adYisab1e to postpone the determination Wasbington-Charlestown to a more fa,·orable opportunity. Arrangements were at once made for determining tbe difference of longitude, "'ashingtonOincinnati, Assistant Smith conducting the operations at the Xaval Observatory, \Vashington, and Assistant Dean those at Mount Lookout, Uiucinnati. Between JnlJ· 18 and 25 four nights were obtained tor exchange of longitude signals; the obserYers then exchanged p11we::;, and completed the determination on five more nights between Angust 2 and 8. In the longitude triangle, Cinciunati-Nash>ille--Saint Loui&, the determination of which w~·s next taken up, the longitude exchanges began on the line Oincinnati-Nash\·ille, and will be referred to under Sections XIII, XIV, and XV. · Te'legrapkic wngitudes.-In conformity with instructions dated near the close of the fiscal year, Subassistant C. H. Sinclair and Mr. l!'. H. Parsons began the preliminary arrangements for tbe determination of the longitude of a station at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, by exchange of telegraphic signals from Washington. The details of the progress and completion of this work will be given in my ne~t annual report. Topography.-The detailed topographical survey of the District of Columbia, begun during the last fiscal year, at the request of the Commissioners of the District, was continued by Assistant J, W. Donn, with the a'id during part of the year of Mr. W. C. Hodgkins, and of Subassistant D. B. Wainwright after the detachment of l\Ir. Hodgkins in June, 1882. At the close of' the fiscal year ending with June, 1881, the work had been completed along Boundary Avenue from Lincoln Avenue to Sixteenth street, and as far north as the park of the Soldiers' Home, including the northwestern portion of those grounds. Much marginal work in the vicinity of Mount Pleasant Village, Seventh street road, and along the line of the Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, between Terra Cotta Station and the Riggs road, was also shown upon the planetable sheet. During July, Augu:st and September, the efforts of the party were directed towards the completion of sheet (No. 1) scale 1-4,800 between the north boundary of the Soldiers' Home and the northeast boundary of the District, and a.ltbough progress was somewhat retardecl b;r the difficulty of running contour lines in a coun\ry much covered by woods, orchards, and bushes, the whole area was completed with the exception of the portion lying to the north and southeast of Fort Totten, and that to the southeast of Fort Bunker Hill, these portions consistiug mostly of woods. In order to ad\"aIJce without cutting through wooded areas, it was decided to postpone this part of the work till winter or early spring, when the trees were not in leaf. During the period between the beginning of October and the middle of February the survey was advan4::ed southward from the Bunker Hill and Harewood roads, and was completed as to Sheet No. 1, the final work having been done in the complica.t, (l wooded areas of the Soldiers1 Home and Glenwood Cemetery. The Engineer Commissioner of the District then requested that, in view of the proposed extension of the Washington .Aqueduct from it,s present terminus at the '' Twin Reservoirs" to Meridian Hill, the survey of the route be a.t once taken up. A belt of topography, covering the line of the proposed extension, was fl.Dished between the beginning of March and the end of June ·

This belt, half a mile wide, and limited by Sixteenth street on the east and the Teunallytowu road on the west, included the most complicated and difficult work to bEI found in the District, a great part of the belt being covered by woods more or less dense. The lowest curve, at the creek running along the wall at the lowest part of Oak Hill Cemeter,y was ten feet; the highest was two hundred and thirty-five feet. The further progress of this elaborate survey will be st:tted in my next annual report, and at ;t more advanced stage of the work statistic8 will be girnn. Photolithographs of the more important portions of the topography have been ma<le from drawingR in this office and furnished to the Commissioners of the District. 1'apography.-The special topographical survey of the site for the uew Naval Observatory in the District of Columbia, made at the request of' Rear-Admiral .John Ifodgers, U. S. N., bad advanced so uearly to completion at the beginning of the fiscal year, and its progress was so fully <lPtailed iu my last annual report, tliat an~' extended uotice of it here may be omitted. The site selected is about three-tenths of a mile to the east of t11e Tenallytown road and upwards of half a mile north of the intersection of High and Road streets, Georgetown. Mr. Charles Junken eondncted the survey with the aid of Mr. F. C. Donn. Triangitlation.-Having organized his party for the extension of the primary triangulation in West Virginia from the Blue Ridge towards the Ohio River, .Assistant ..A.. T. Mosman had completed the occupatiou of lvy Station, iu Raleigh County, at tlie opening of the fiscal year, and was directing the preparations ueedful for the occupation of Table Rock Station. .Advantage was taken of delay in transportation, owing t-0 nufrworable weather and bad roads, to make a reconnaissance for connecting the astronomical station at Charleston, \V. Va., with the primary triangulation ; one signal was erected at Creed, and a secondary station was established at Big Rocks, intermediate between the two primary stations, Holmes and Pigeon. The instruments were mounted at Table Rock on the 13th of July, but progress being much dela~'ed by rain and haze, it was not till August 15 that the requisite number of observations could be obtained. :For horizontal direction five hundred and seventy-eight observations were made upon primary, and twenty-eight upon tertiary stations; one hundred and forty observations for difference of heights with the micrometer, and two hundred and ten measures of zenith distance with the vertical circle. At the next station occupied in the primary scheme, Holmes, the needful preparations were completed on the 24th of August. During the interval between this date and the 29th of September every effort was made to overcome the unfavorable conditions of the atmosphere arising from heat and drought. Meanwhile station Creed was occupied by Mr. W. B. Fairfield, Aid in the party, and the work :at Holmes having been finished at the date just named, the connection of the astronomical station at Charleston, W. Va., with the primary triangulation was taken up and completed early in October. At station Holmes seven hundred and thirty-seven observations of horizontal direction were obtained; seventy-seven observations for difference of heights with the micrometer, and one hundred and eleven measures of zenith distance with the vertical circle. At station Creed one hundred and fifty-two observations of horizontal direction and at four other stations of the tertiary order in the vicinity of Charleston four hundred and se~en observations of horizontal direction. Hence the field-work of the party while engaged in the primary triangulation and the operations immediately incidental to it and including the work at Ivy Station may be summarized as follows : Primary stations occupied ....... _. _... _... _. _.. .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 Tertiary stations occupied, ......·.·...·...·. _..... __ .......... _. __ ·.... _. 5 Observations of horizontal directions, number of..... . . _.. __ .......... _. .. · · 2, 356 Micrometric differences of height, number of ............. _. . . . ... _.. _. . . . . 300 Measures of zenith distance with the vertical circle, number of. ...... _.... _.. 417

Eig~t public buildings in the town <?f Charleston, W. Va., were determined in position. ~unng the rest of the ~eason ~ reconn~ssance west of the line Piney-Pigeon was begun for
carrymg the scheme of primary tnangulation towards the Ohio River. Mr. Mosman found the country very much broken, being intersected by three considerable streams, the Mud River,

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

35

GuJ'audotte River, and Twelve Pole Creek. The ranges of hills bounding these streams are nearly all of the same height, all densely wooded, and the courses of the streams themselves very crooked. Upon reaching the Ohio River early in November the party was disbanded and field operations closed. Assistant Mosman makes special mention of the faithful and efficient service rendered by Mr. W. B. Fairfield, attached to the party as extra observer during the season. The records, field computations, etc., were all completed and forwarded to the office during the winter. Before the close of the fiscal year Assistant Mosman received instructions for field-work, which has already been noticed under the heading of Section II. Special reconnai.~sance and triangulation.-In continuation of the explorations aud surveys of the region between Washington, D. C., and Martinsburg, W. Va., for the purposes of a general map, Mr. H. F. Walling took the field t-0wards the close of July, 1881. Obtaining the most trustworthy maps of Montgomery, Frederick, and Washington Counties, Maryland; of Loudoun County, Virginia, and of Jefferson and Berkeley Counties, West Virginia, Mr. Walliug connected elevated points in that region by triangulation with stations already established in position, determined the heights of these points by a series of barometric observations referred to a fixed barornetrica1 station, ran traverse surveys upon the roads for the purpose of comparing their actual lengths and directions with the configurations upon the maps, and verified the representations of railroad alignments by obtaining wherever practicable copies of the original notes or plans, giving the lengths and directi011s of tbe tangents, the lengths of the radii, and the lengths aud directions of the curves. Where deficiencies existe1l in these notes special traverse surrn,ys were made to supply them. Along and near the mountain ridges and important hills different methods were pursued according to circumstances. In many cases lines were run by traverse along the summit of ridges, with accompanying barometer readings. Similar lines were also run np some of the valleys between the spurs. In other places less accessible, points were located and their heights determined by horizontal and vertical angles from known points along the roads in the valleys below. With the data and material thus obtained such portions of the county maps as were deemed sufficiently accurate for reduction to the projection were thus transfered to the general map. The area of its completed portion is as follows: Washington County, Maryland (east of longitude 770 58'), area in square miles. 369 Frederick County, Maryland (entire), area in square miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 618 Jefferson Count:.r, West Virginia (entire), area in square miles . . . · . . . . . . . . . 217 Total area of finished part in square miles. . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . · . . . . . 1, 204 The area partly finished comprises portions of Berkeley County, West Virginia, and of Frederick, Clarke, and Loudoun Counties, Virginia, with an area of eight hundred and twenty-one square miles. It is estimated that between one-half and two-thirds of the work upon this area is completed. Magnetic obsen1ations.-Subassistant James B. Baylor at the beginning of the fiscal year was engaged at Marion, Va., in completing the last station of a series for the determination of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity in the States of Virginia and West Yirginia. This magnetic tour was planned to include the occupation of a number of stations in Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky, and its further progress will be noticed under the heads of Sections XIII and

VIII.
Geodesic leveling.-As already noticed, under the head of Section II, the primary bench-mark established at Hagerstown, Md., in the line of transcontinental leveling started westward from that point in 1877 was referred to the level of the sea by Assistant Andrew Braid, who took the field for that purpose early in July, 1881. His line of levels of precision began at the bench-mark of the self-registering tide-gauge at Sandy Hook, N. J., and ended at the bench-mark on the foundation of the court house in Hagerstown. Reference will be made under the head of Section XIV to the extension of the line oflevels of precision westward from Mitchell, J nd.

Deep-sea sounding.~ and tempBratures.-In furtherance of the investigations relating to the physical features of the Gulf Stream, Commander J. R. Bartlett, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was engaged at the opening of the fiscal year in running lines of deep-sea soundings, with serial temperatures normal to the coast, between Currituck light-house, North Carolina, and Ju1>iter Inlet, Florida. With his party, in the steamer Blake, he had at the time just named completed nine lines of soundings, and on July 3 had anchored off the town of Smithville, N. C. Here he was detained by bad weather until July 8, and ou getting to the northward of Cape Fear was compelled to make a harbor at Fortress Monroe, whence he sailed .Tuly 16, and next day ran a line of soundings normal to the coast in length about seventy miles, beginning off Currituck Beach light-house with a depth of ten fathoms and reaching eleven hundred and sixty-five fathoms in latitude 360 13', longitude 740 18'. Upon this line, as upon those subsequently ruu, the record of depth sounded was accompanied by observations of the position of the steamer at each sounding, by observations of bottom and surface temperatures of water and strength and direction of currents, and hy records of the character of the bottom from the specimens brought up, densit,y of water, and meteorological phenomena. All soundings were taken with piano wire, using Commander Sigsbee's improved sounding machine. It always worked well, and his sounding cylinder never failed to bring up a specimen of the bottom. The temperatures below the surface were taken with the Miller-Casella deep-sea thermometers. Additional lines were run off Cape Hatteras until July 20, and on July 22 a line from Cape Lookout to a depth of two thousand fathoms. On ,T uly 24 a line was run normal to the coast from a point about twenty miles to the eastward of Cape Fear and a return line to Charleston, where the Blake arri ~·ed ,July 28. After a detention of some days by bad weather at Charleston, Captain Bartlett left tha.t port early in August, and occupied the remainder of the season in running lines of soundings to test the working of the Siemens electrical deep-sea thermometer. This apparatus is described and figured in Appendix No. 18. Its principle depends upon the effect of changes of temperature in varying the resistance of metals to the passage of an electric current, and it consists essentially of two resistance-coils, one of which is lowered into the sea by means of a cable connecting it with the other resistance.coil on board ship. The end of the cable, which is in electrical connection with this resistauce-coil, is attached to a "Wheatstone's bridge" with a battery and galvanometer. '\Then the two coils are at the same temperature the galvanometer scale reads zero; any change in the temperature produced in the coil lowered into the sea causes a deflection to the right or left of zero; hence to ascertain the temperature of the coil at the bottom of the sea or of the water in its vicinity the coil on uoard ship must be heated or cooled till the zero indication is shown on the galvanometer scale. The temperature of the water in which this coil is immersed is then that of the water at the depth sounded. Captain Bartlett has made a special report (Appendix No. 18) of the tests obtained with this apparatus, comparing the temperatures given by it with those of the Miller-Casella deep-sea thermometers. Serial temperatures, taken at intervals of five and ten fathoms from surface 1:o bottom, showed a very gratifying accordance between the two methods, and led to increased confidence in the results obtained from the l\Iiller-Casella thermometers. With reference to the physical features of the area over which the Gulf Stream sweeps, the work of Captain Bartlett has developed some interestin'g results. His soundings show, not a deep channel, but, to quote from his report, "an extensive and nearly level plateau, extending from a point t-0 the eastward of the Bahama Banks to Cape Hatteras. Off Cape Canaveral, nearly two hundred miles wide, and gradually diminishing in width to the northward until reaching Hatt.eras, when the depth is more than one thousand fathoms within thirty miles of the shore. This plateau has a general depth of four h uudred fathoms, suddenly dropping on its eastern edge to two thousand fathoms."

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Captain Bartlett remarks further: "It will be observed from the bottom specimens that the course of the Gulf Stream can almost be traced by the character of the bottom. Ou each side of the stream the sounding cylinder brought up ooze. In the strength of the current the bottom was washed nearly bare, the specimens being small broken pieces and particles of disintegrated coral rock. This bare portion was very hard~ and the sharp edge of the brass sounding cylinder came up very much dented and defaced. From Jupiter Inlet, with the exception of the bare part mentioned, the specimens were a light-colored ooze composed of Pteropod shells, with a mixture of coral sand. Off Charleston, where the plateau has less depth than to the southward, the bare section extended the whole width of the stream. The Pteropod ooze extended only to Charleston. To the northward of that point the bott-0m specimens were Globigerina. To the northward of Cape Lookout and off Hatteras the bottom was Globigerina ooze of a dark greenish tint. (The specimens have changed color very much since first obtained.) These specimeus of the bottom seem to me to throw very important light on the circulation. The Pteropods are brougllt along b.Y the Gulf Stream. In the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico the bottom below three hundred fath-0ms is always Pteropod ooze. To the northward of Ilatteras, and as far as the Georges Bank, we have found in the Blake only Globigerina ooze. The fact of finding Globigerina ooze off Hatteras, and its gradual diminution to the southward, would tend to show the limit of the Arctic current. The Globigerina were not found to the Ronthward of tlie high part of the plateau off Charleston. It would appear from this fact alone, although the temperatures, I think, confirm it, that the Arctic current does not extend below Hatteras, but at this point goes under the Gulf Stream and to the eastward, being defiected that way by the form of the platt-au. A numuer of lines were run off Hatteras to develop more fully this point. J?rom Hatteras the one-lmndred-fatliom line gradua.lly draws away from the shore as we go to the northward." Allusion is again made in the report to the belt of rippling water off Charleston, near the center of the Gulf Stream, and the strong son th western current found there. This "rip," Captain Bartlett states, is unlike any that lie ltas ever seen, except the race at the entrance of Long Island Sound. He attributes it "to the sudden rise of the plateau off Olrnrlestou, together, probably, with tlie meeting of the Arctic current."

Hydrograpky.-For the purpose of locating a shoal reported b~· Captain l<'oster of the steamer Appold as about six miles east-southeast from Frying Pan light-Rhip, North Carolina, Lieut.Commander W. H. Brownson, U.S. N.,Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, proceeded to Smithville, N. <.J., in May, 1882, with his party in the steamer Geduey, and, having determined accurat-ely the position of the light-ship, placed a lmoy on the slioal in six fathoms water, the least depth found. This shoal is well known to the pilots and fishermen about Smithville; it has a general direction of north-northwest and south·southeast, and is nine miles in length, with a depth of from

seven to eight fathoms. The location of the buoy is nine and one-fourth miles from the light-ship, from which it bears east 120 south (magnetic). Lieutenant-Commander Brownson remarks that since New Inlet was closed, the water on the bar of Seward Channel leading into Cape Fear River bas deepened, and eighteen feet can now be carried over at high water.

Hydrograpky.-A shoal having been reported ten miles northeast by east from Georgetown light, coast of South Carolina, by the master of a coasting schooner, Lieut.-Commander W. H. Brownson, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was directed to make careful search for it. This duty was performed April 27, 1882, under conditions very favorable for showing the existence of shoal water, but Captain Brownson could find no indications of it, and reports that, according to his judgment, no such shoal exists. He suggests that the master of the schooner was out in his position, and that what he actually saw was the shoal spot (seventeen feet of water) off Georgetown light, with Cape Romain bearing southwest distant about ten miles. Upon the completion of a hyclrographic survey on the J1'lorida coast, which will be referred to under the heading of Section VI, foent.-Commander ,V, H. Brownson, U. s. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survf\y, was directed to proceed to Port Royal, S. C., for the purpose of makiug such examinations of the Beaufort Rinr as would determine what portions needed resurvey. The !Jed of the river is of phmiphate rock, and is constantly being dredged, the rock having valuable properties as a fertilizer. Upon conference with Capt. J.E. Jouett, U. S. N., commanding the naval station, Lieutenant-Commander Brownson found it advisable to make an immediate survey of a small portion of the river opposite to Battery Creek. This work was accomplished between the 14th and the 22d of April. Tidal observations.-Application having been made by Lieut. B. D. Greene, United States Engineers, through General Q. A. Gillmore, U. S. A., for the loan of a self-registering tide-gauge to be established at Fort Sumter, Charleston Ha1·i>or, South Carolina, in connection with the works of construction in progress there, the gauge was forwarded to him soou after the beginning of the fiscal year. The tidal cm·yes will be sent for ta!Julation and discussion to this office.

Deep-sea stmndings.-As previously stated under the head of Section IV, Commander J. R. Bartlett, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, at the opening of the fiscal year had completed nine lines of deep-sea so1111dings with surface and bottom temperatures. His first line was run from l\lemory Rock, Little Bahama Bank, to Jupiter Inlet light, Florida, and was followetl by a series of lines norm~l to the coast, of the character and with the results already fully stated. These investigations, so valuable as a contribution to our knowledge of the phenomena of the Gulf Stream, will be resumed at the earliest date practicable. Tri.angulation, topography, and kydrography of Indian Riner, E. Fla.-With instructions for the extension of tlie survey of Indian River sou th ward from the limits of the work of the preceding season, Assistant C. H. Boyd arrived at Turke~· Creek on the 24th of January, 1882, and taking charge of the sloop Steadfast, brought her southward about forty-five miles, reaching a locality which served as a base of operations early in February. The three classes of work were then taken up from the limits of 1881, and carried forward continuously till the last of April, the triangulation beginning at the line " Eggs" to " May" in latitude 270 401 north; the topography

at station " Guest," a mile and a quarter north of that line, and the hydrography at station "Narrows" nearly a mile above "Guest." Progress was less rapid than bacl been auticipateu on account of the witle antl dense fringe of wooded swamp on the east side of the lagoon, entirely cutting off all 'iew of signals on the ocean beach sand-d uues from those ou the shores of the lagoon. At the " Narrows" the mangroves became large trees. Tripod signals and scaffolds were found necessary, ele>ating the theodolite twenty-two feet. To bring the shore-hue within view the plane-table, the instrument had to be placed far out in the water, and the telemeters were carried by boat, so dense was the belt of mangroves fringing the ea8tern shore of the lagoon. The work was pushed forward energetically, however, until about eighteen miles of tl1e lagoon and ocean beach had been covered b.r the triangulation; one topographic sheet scale 1-30,000, emli ng at Indian River Inlet, completed, ancl the topography on the upper eml of the next sheet well advanced. From the ocean beach the entire island forming the eastern side of the river is covered by the topography, and enough of the western shore to delineate its characteristics fully. The hydrography covers the lagoon from a point about two miles north of the triangulation to Indian River Inlet. The waters are shoal, with many islands, oyster and sancl bars obstructing its navigation. Four tide-gauges were established for the reduction of the soundings, the most permanent of which is upon the wharf at Saint Lucie post-office, referred to a bench-mark on Mr. Paine's house. Towards the close of April, and in aeeortlancc with instructions, Assistant .Bo~·d furnished a tracing of the shore-line and the geographical positions determined as far as the inlet, to the officer charged with the execution of the off-shore hydrography, and for the purpose of establishing additional points sonthwi1rd, began on the 3d of May a beach measurement with twenty-five meter steel tapes. On the 20th of Ma;y a point had been reached on the ocean beach upwards of thirty-one miles from Indian mver Inlet, and in sight of Jupiter Inlet light. The season's work was then closed, the Steadfast being laid up iu a sheltered position in the fresh water of Manatee Creek at the mouth of the Saint Lucie River. Assistant Boyd makes acknowledgment of the efficient service rendered by the officers of the partJ, viz: Subassistant J.B. Weir, and Messrs. Carlisle Terr;y, Geo. F. Bird and E. S. Taney, Aids.

B. Thomas, U. S. N., Assistant Coast ancl Geodetic Survey, with his party iu the steamer A. D. Bache aITived off that coast in the vicinity of Indian River Inlet early in May, 1882. The two projections furnished to him included the coast between the limits of latitude 270 45' and 260 55' north. Work was at once begun upon the upper pr~jection, itnd completed upon both of t11em towards the end of June. During the progress of the survey a dangerous shoal, the existence of which was knowu, but not its exact locality, was developed by Lieutenant-Commander Thomas. He describes it as follows: "This shoa.I (Saint Lucie) is three and one-half miles from the land, and is in latitude 27018' 30" north; fongitude soo 08' 4:5" west. It is a narrow ridge extending north and south for about one

mile, the least water on it being fifteen feet. From the center of the shoal, Mount Elizabeth bears south 53° 08' west (true) and Honse of l~efnge No. 2 on Saint Lucie Rocks bears south 70 48' west (true). Mount Elizabeth is a round-topped hill sixt.r feet high, on the west side of Indian River in latitude 27° 1.Y 10" north; longitude 800 13' 50" west. It is the hig·hest laud in the vicinity, aml is easily recognized if seen from a point to seaward of tile shoal. But from a less distance from the shore the hill is not visible, as it disappears behind the trees 011 the beach. ''Deep water (ten fathoms) is found from six hundred to seven hundred ;yards to seaward of the shoal. As the numerous steamers, passing to the southward, rn11 in quite near this shoal in endeavoring to avoid the current of the Gi1lf Stream, I think a whiRtliug buo,v should lie placed in the vicinit;y." A correction was made by Lieutenant-Commander Thomas in the position heretofore given for ,Jupiter Inlet light. Acknowledging the zeal and efficieucy of the officers of his party, viz, l\Iaster Fmuk A. Wilner, U. S. N., and Ensigns H. M. Witzel, J, M. Orchard, C. S.

Hydrograpky (!f Key West Harbor and .Nortlwest Channel Bar.-For the purpose of ascertaining the exact locality of ehanges which had taken place in Key West Harbor and vicinity, Lieut. Commander "\V. H. Brownson, in the steamer Gedney, made an examination of that harbor aml of a portion of Northwest Channel in April, 1882. Ile reports but little change in the harbor since the last survey, but a decided change in the bar of Northwest Channel, owing to a gradual extension of the east bank to the westward, which mitkes a change in the location of buoys necessary. No indication was found of a shoal within the limits of" The Triangles." One finished hydrographic sheet, showing the results of the work, has been forwarded to the office.

Mr. Hergesheimer arrived in New Orleans early in January, and having made the necessary repairs to the schooner Quick, he anchored in Tampa Bay towards the close of February, after a very long passage, due to calms and adverse winds. Thence he proceeded to Little Sarasota Inlet, from which locality as a base of operations he completed the beach measurement and triangulation southward for a distance of fifteen miles. Changing his anchorage first to Stump Pass and then to Charlotte Harbor, the work was completed to the line of the old triangulation " GasparillaTrepador," at both of which stations the granite monuments marking them were found to be :in good condition. Thirty-five miles of coast line were covered by the triangulaiiou aud beach measurement. \Vi th regard to this portion of the coa.st, Mr. Hergesheimer remarks : "There is but one anchorage (for the vessel) between Litt.le Sarasota and Gasparilla, a distance of thirty-five miles. This is Stump Pass, a small inlet which can be ent:ered by a sailing-vessel under the most favorable circumstances only, as the bar and channel are constantly changing. There is about six feet of water on the bar. It is not safe to attempt to enter any of the small inlets 011 this coast with a vessel drawing OYer fi,-e feet of water without first going ashore and making an examination of the bar, as every heavy westerly wind seems to change the bar and channel. At 'Little Sarasota' the channel is not over twenty.five meters wide, bounded on one. side by ledges. Three years ago, when I took the Quick into this inlet, the channel passed to the

Hydrof/raphic .mr·nev of the innn· and outer ba.rs of Ea.st Pass, Saint George's Sound.-During the winter of 1881-'83, Lieut.-Uomurnuder W. H. Brownl'ion, B". S. :N"., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was engaged in a number of localities ou tile west coast of Flori(la for the purpose of filling gaps i.n tbe hydrography and of 1mtking new surveys where demanded by changes of importance. Referring to his work in geogrnphi.cal order, the hydrography of the inner and outer bars of East Pass, Saiut George's Souud, was execukd uetweeu the Gtu and 14th of February, 1882. Upon his arrival off East, Pass, Lientenant-Uommantle'r Brownson fou11d a large Norwegian barque aground on the bar, and immediately auswered a call from her for help, succeeding in hauling lier off inside the bar. 'l'hiH harqne waH drawing eighteen feet of water, and weut to sea the same night with nineteen feet on the bar. Upon the outer bar the smTey showed seventeen and one-half feet at mean low watRr, and there wa8 noted a marked extension of Dog Islaud Point and of the east end of Saint George's Island. The statistics of the work are as follows:

Hydrograplty in tlte vicinity of Saint .Toseph'.~ Bay a.1ul Gape ~an Blas, Fla.-For the development of the hydrography of( the coast of Florida, between Cape Saint George and Cape Sau Blas, and thence northwestward in the vicinity of Saint Joseph's Ba.y, Lieutenant-Commander Brownson, with his part.r in the steamer Gedney, left Pensacola on the 2'.!d of November, 1881 1 and having established a tidal station at Saint Joseph's Poi11t, beg-au work upou his projections December 5, and prosecuted it at every interval of favorable weather till the 1st of Februar,y, when the 1'nrv<1y was completed. The weather was very unfavorable dnriug the wbole of the month of January, fogs and haze being prevalent most of the time. With reference to the configuration of that portion of tbe Gulf of Mexico plateau off Cave San Blas, Lientenant-Commander Brownson remarks that to the northward of the cape it is very regular; to the southward very irregular, the somulings indicating an extremely undulating bottom. Six miles to the Muthwestwa.rd of San mas lie fonnd a shoal spot not girnn ou auy chart with a least depth at mean low watei· of twenty-two feet. And totbe ROnthward of this (st.ff en anli one half miles south by west~ west of th.e cape) another shoal with a least depth of twenty-four and oneha.Jf feet, botb shoals being of but small extent. Some facts of interest observed during the survey are stated as follows in. Lieutenant-Commander Brownson's report: "The current between Capes Saint George and San Blas sets to the nort,hward and westward with a velocity of from oue-quarter to one-third of a knot per hour. At oue time, while at anchor eight miles south of San Blas, with the surface current setting to the northward and westward thirty-five hundredths of a knot per hour, a fishing line over the side showed a strong current setting to the eastward, a hea\'Y sinker being repeatedly citrried in that direction. The observa· tion for surface current at the time was made with a loaded staff nine foot in length. The coast

Hydrography of the bar of Pensacola. Rnrbor.-Lient.-Commander W. H. Brownson, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Snrn'y, took command of the steamer Gedney on the list of October, 1881, and after t>ome dc>lay ou account of bad weather began on the 10th of that month the hydrography of the !Jar of Pem;acola Harbor, with special exarniuations of the chaugcs that bad taken place since tbe earlier snn·ers. On the 21st of November the work was reported ai; complete, and the finished hytlrographic shePt, with recorcls accompanying, wa8 forwarded to the office. The following extracts from the report of Lie11tenant-Comurnnder Brow11su11 embody statements of some of tl.te more noteworth~- results of the sun-ey. "The shoals and bars at the t·utrance of the harbor are of sand. In running the 1ines of soundings, mu<i was repOl'ted by the leadsmen iu se,·eral places. but on taking specimens of the hottorn, it was found to be soft sand. There is now a least depth of twent,r-two and one· half feet on the outer bar, while on the inner bal' (extenrling betweell the lo1Ver end of Middle Gron11d and Cancus Bank) the least depth in the channel i8 twenty feet, with twenty and one-half feet on either side of it. 'l'his l'lhoal with tweut.r feet is probably what bas been known among· the iiilots and tug-men as the '21-foot lnmp.' I also note the gradual extension of the western eud of Sauta Rosa Island, and the washing awa~· of the coast in the vicinity of Fort M:cHae, the new shore-line being over one hundred meters inside of old line. ''In order to pre,-ent the further washing away of tltis shore, and to restore it, if possible, ancl also to increase the depth of water on tbe inner har, a series of jetties are in course of coustruction, extending normal to the shore-line above and below Fort .;\fcRae, about five hundred feet out in the channel.

"Since the last survey a new cha.mwl hn8 been opened, with eighteen and one-half feet of water between the Eastern Bank aud Santa Rosa Island, about three lmndred meters from the la.tlier. It is narrow, bowtwer, awl of no importance at present. I experienced much difficulty in getting the observations for currents, twenty-th-e hours being necessary for a complete series at each station. The tidal currents a.re n·.ry irregular and deperul in a great measure, both for velocity and direction, on tlte wiucl. With moderate weather from the Routhward, the sea breaks on Cancus Bank and the Middle Ground."

Trfongulation, topography, and hydro.r1raphy bet1Pl'en Gall·e8ton Ba,y and Sabine Pa8s.-Under ·instructions dated December 26, 1881, Assistant F. W. Perkins organized a partr for the survey of the coast of Texas between G-.il rnston and Sabine Pass, the principal o1~jects of the season's work being the determination of points along the shore for the 0~1tsi(le hydrography, together wi~h a topographical survey of the shores and a hydrographie surYey of the entrance to Sabine Pass. All preparations ha,ing been complPted towar<ls the eu<l of ,Jauuar,y, including repairs to the schooner Research, the work was beguu at Bolirnr Point while awaiting the arrfral of the vessel and camp-equipage, Colonel .Mansfield, of the Engineer Corps, h:wing kindly placed his quarters at the disposal of the party. A measurement lJy wire was made of the beach of Bolivar Peninsula, aoout eigllte~u miles iu length, for the detenniuatiou of l1ydrographic points, ancl a recounaissance was made in the vicinity of High Island. Upon the arrirnl of tile Research iu Feuruary, the triangulation was begun, usiug a>< a uase the line Peirce-Nortbwest Bend, these being the only two points of the old triangt1latiou that could be identified. Points in tile back country were determined from the shore triangulation by concluded angles, care being taken to obtain as many separa.te determinations as possible, and to supply long lines for carrying· azimuths . .As soon as enough points had been fixed by tlie tria.ugulation, which was steadily pushed eastward towards Sabine Pass, tlie topography was uegtrn, a sep:irate party with a light camp hanng been organized for this purpose. Upon the completion of the triangulation and topography, the inner portion of the Sabiue Pass, not liable to radical ehauges from the works of constrnetion in progress on Urn har, was sounded, and a reconnaissance was made to the eastward of tlle Pass. The many difficulties encountered iu the work owing to the marshy cllaracter of the couutry, the limited means of transportation available, and the hazy state of' the atmm;phere were successfully surmounte1l by the skill and energy of Mr. Perkins and his Aids, Messrs. C.H. Vau Ordeu and Isaac Winston. The topography and a large part of the triangulation were executed by .M.r. Yan Orclen. He had also a share iu tile beacl1 measurement. Special mention is made by Mr. Perkins in his report of Mr. Wi11;.;ton's exertions in determining, with the aid of .\'Ir. R. E. Duvall, foreman in the part,r, the shore-line of a very dangerous stretch of coast west of the entrance to Sabine Paiss, and known as the "Oil Pond." It had been considered impassable and unapproachable either frow tbe water or Janel sides, being in great part a bed of mud so soft that in many places even the beach birds and cranes sink in it to their breasts.

Selection of .~ite for permanent 1nagnetic 8tation.-In co-operation with the work of the Signa.J Office, and with that of the International Polar Commission, it became desirable to establish a magnetic obsen·atory at some point near the southern coast of ()alifornia; and in order to select a site that would most completely fulfill the conditions demanded, Assistant J. S. Lawson was directed in l\Jay, 1882, to examine localities at and near San Diego and Los Angeles. In pnr1mance of this dntJ· he left San Francisco June 7, and having carefully investigated the several sites in tlie vicinity of the towns jnst named, decided in favor of the grounds of the Branch State Normal School in Los Angeles as meeting folly the essential reqt1irements of the observatory, viz, a location that would secure permanency for several .vears ; freedom from local disturbing influences such as any moviug masses of iron or metal iind any large fixed masses of iron; freedom from vibrations or jarrings of passing vehicles; a free supply of pure water; certainty that no buildings were to be erected or iron pipes laid near the ob;.;ervatory; convenience of living for the observer, and economy in construction of the building. Permission to occnp~- the grounds for the purpose in view having been given by Governor Geo. E. Perkins, of California, represe11ting the Board of Trustees of the State Normal School as its 11resident ex officio, Mr. Lawson began the work of construction at once in accordance with the plans furnished by the office, with some needful modifications suggested bJ' himself. The instruments to be set up WPre the Adie magnetogTaphs, which register by phot.ograpby, and for their more effocti rn 1Vorking require the maintenance of as uniform a temperature as practicable and freedom from currents of air ; two buildings, one inner, one outer, were therefore constructed with a. space of about two anll a half foet lJetween the walls, th11 piers for the self-registering magnetie apparatus being placed in the inner builcling. Thn details of construction <tre fully stat.ed in Mr. Lawson's report, which is acc1m1p<tnied by a plan of the observatory and maps showing its location in Los Angeles. For the usual absolute determinations of the direction and intensity of the magnetic force made on tJiree days of each month, l\lr. Lawson established a station at a sufficient distance from the differential instruments, and upon the arrival of Mr. Werner Suess, who was charged with the fitting up of the observatory and apparatus, he left J;os Angeles under instructions to take charge of the primary triangulation northward of Point Concepcion. Reconnaissance and prirna.ry triangulation between Point Ooncepcion and Monterey.-For the extension of the primary triangn lation of the coast of California from Poiu t Concepcion north ward Assistant Stehman Forney organized. his party at the beginning of the fiscal year. Having readjusted the signals at stations" Gaviota" 1rnd "Lospe," and erected signals at stations A.rgnello and San Luis, at heights ranging from fifteen hundred to three thousand feet, Mr. Forney started

on a reconnaissance to the northward and eastward, with a view of determining the intervisibility of a station intended to connect directly in the scheme with "Lospe" and "Tepusquete." A careful examination having shown the imprnctical1ility of the scheme as originally proposed, it was modified ioo as to adopt the figure Lospe, Tepusquete, San Jose, Castle Mountain, and Rocky Butte, with San Luis as a central point, the intervisibility of the line Roeky Butte-Lospe, fifty e.ight, . miles in length, having been established. From Castle ]\fountain and the stations which connect immediately with it, ';Castor'' and "Santa Lucia," prominent peaks of the Sierra Nevada, are visible. After erecting and adjusting the signals neede(l, Mr. :F'orney occupied Tepusquete Station towards the end of August, remaining there till early in October. The observations made for horizontal and vert,ical angles were, however, not sa.tisfactory, owing to the hazy and smoky state of the atmosphere. Hence the principal re,.ult of the se>tson's work was the advancement of the triangulation b.v establishing a prncticable scheme for the connection of the primary triangulation of the coast northward of Point Concepcion with that of the Sierra Nevada. With reg:trd to the best season for prosecuting this work, l\:Ir. Forney expresses au opinion in fayor of the period from the first of NoYernber to the fir.st of June~ and states that heliotropes will be uecessar,Y on all but the shortest lines. Topography froni San Luis Obispo northward.-A topographical surve~· of the coast of California, from Point Oaballo to Point Buchon, nuder Ute directio11 of Assistant W. E. Greenwell, was in progress at the date of the opening of this report. Earl,,- in July, 1881, oue plane-table sheet was completed, aml work was beg'nn upon a second. exteading from Point Bnchon to Moro Rock. The character of the topography was partly monntainous, partly sand.dunes, covered with low brushwoo1l or chaparral. In connection with the plane-table survey, arnl for its proper elaboration, a triangulation wa~ carrie(l forward from the line 8dnuna.cher-Pecho northward. Field operations were closed early in Octoher, and during the wint.cr the two topographic sheets and the records and computations of the triangulation were forwarded to the office.

Tidal observations.-U.nder the direction of Assistant Georg·e DaYhlsou, the reconls of the self-registering tidP-gauge at Saucelito, near t.lie entrance to the Bay of San Francisco, have been continued b~- Mr. E. Gray. The reconl has been maintained without interruption, and the station is one of much importance, bein~ now the only one of the kind ou the Pacific coast. A series of meteorological observatillus is kept up in connection with the tidal record. Topography between Baleiias and Table ,lfountain.-At as early a date iu 1882 as the season would permit, the topography needed to fill the gap between Balenas and Table Mountain was completed by Subassiiitant E. F. Dickins, under the direction of Assistant Davidson, the two former surveys being joined in the best practical manner. The topographic sheet has been forwarded to the office. · Supplementary topography of San Franci.~co Ba!f and approaches.-Important changes havi:lg taken place in the shores of San Francisco Bay entrance, in the wharf-lines of the city, and in the topography of the surrounding country since the earlier surveys, it, became desirabl~ to obtain data and material for additions and corrections to the published charts, by the execution of supplementary topography, with such triangulation as became necessary in the progress of the plane-table work. This duty was intruto1ted to A.8sistant L. A. Seugteller, who organized his party at the beginning of the fiscal year. Having made four pr~jections, covering the Tamalpais Peninsula, he repaired to Saucelito July 121 and begrtn field operations, continuing the topographic survey until October 14, at which date the entire Tamalpais Peninsula had been eompleted, and a fifth sheet projected, including the towns of San Rafael and San Quentin. At Point Bouita, where by the courtesy of Oolonel R. S. Williamson, United States Engineers, and Oaptain G. W.

Coffin, U. S. N., the party occupied temporary quarters at the light-house, a complete resurvey of the Point wa:,; made, it having been reduced and much changed as c,)mpared with former surveys. Tracings of the firn sheets were put in hand jnst before the completion of the work, and also a Rketch for reduction by pautagmph to the scale of publication of the chart (1-40,000). These were all forwarded t.o the office before the close of the field-work. The party was next transferred to the eastern shore of San Fraucisco Bay. But three stations of the ol(l triangulatiou could be recovered; hence aJJ auxiliary triangulation was begun, covering the shores of Contra Costa and Alarne<la Counties, aud determining all points needed in the city of San :Francisco, and ou the islands in the harbor. By the 10th of November a sufficient number of poi11LR had been obtained to reo;ume the topography; both triangulation and topography were then pusht>d to completio11, and the work on the eastern shore of the ba,y brought to a close January 25. At thi:,; time thr<'e more topographic sheets had been finiRhed, and to complete the work of the Rupplernentar,r surn·y there rcmaiuell to be executetl a thorough examination of the entire water front of the city, aud of the shores of the San Francisco peuinsula to Point Lobos and southward towards }forced Lake. This work was taken up in the spring, the party being engaged during the winter in office work upou the topographic sheets an!l recordo;. On the 15th of April, the party having been reorganized, ~1 projection (two sheets joined) was prepared, inclndi11g the shore-line from Point San ,Jost; (or Black Point) to Poiut Avisadera, and the topograpli~- of the city front begun. At the sarne time all authentic data that coulll be obtained from local sources bearing· upon the work of the smTey was collected. Assistant Sengteller acknowledges his obligations for vahrnble maps and documents to Capt. U. F. Humphreys, U. S. A., to the cit:.· awl county surveyor, W. P. ITumphre,rs, esq.; to F. A. Bishop, esq., chief eugineer of the State Harbor Commissioners; awl to the engineer of the Golden Gate Park. Such of the maps ohtained from these sou reps as wPre of sn!lieieut accuracy were reduced to a scale of 1-10,000, so as to be made morP availa.ble for the field-work. Two additional projections, extending from Point Sau Jose to Pnint Lobos, aml thence as far south as the Ocean Side Housf', being soon in readinrss, work was begnn upon the111 without dela,\·. IJpon the sheet first named, all needed topography wao; finishe(1 :\fay 31, and npon the other sheets June :l2. Instructions having in the mean time been received for a hydrographic examination of the city front, and of Oakland Creek and its approaches, this was begun June 25, and had nearly reached completion at the close of the fiscal year. During that part of the Reason previous to April 151 Messrs. Fremont Morse and P.A. Welker served as Ajds in the party, the former during the entire seaRon, the latter from November 1. Assistant Sengteller expresses his high appreciation of the good judgment and ability displayed by :\Ir. l\1or,o;e in the t'xecution of the triaugnlation, which was rapi1lly accomplished. M:r. Morse was a~signed to other dnty at the reorganization of the party in April, Subassistant E. F. Dickins reporting for dttt,\· at the same time, and taking charge of oue of the plane.tables. To Messrs. 1Jicki11s and \Velk er Assistant Seugteller t>xpresses his thanks for hearty and constant co-operation and support.

After the completion of the survey to Point Arena the McArthur was laid up at the Mare Island navy-yard. 1lfea.mrement of Yolo Prirrwry base-line.-Prelimiuar_y examiuatio111S, made by Assistant George Davidson, for the selection of a site for a primary lrnse-1iue in California date back to the year 1876. The general location liaYing been fixed, npou the plains of Yolo County between Cache and Putah Creeks, in that part of the Saerameuto Yalley lying irmnediatcl,y cast of the Vaca or Berryessa Mountains (a spur of the Coa:st Rtmge ), Al'rnistant Davidson directed his special examination towards tiuding a Rite for the line which should form tlrn best and most practicable connecti-on with the scheme of primal',\ triaug·nlation extending eaRtwar<l across the continent, and northward and southwanl along the Pacific coast. After a careful recnmHtisRa11c1~, occupying hut a few (lays, the line was in t,hat year proYisionally located, and a quadrilateral established, the eastern }JOiut8 of which were Northwest Base and Southeast Base. and the west~rn station,; Monticello and Vaca, peaks of the Berryessa Mountains. A.s finally established in 1880, the line lies uearJ~~ paraUel with that part of the California, Pacific Uailroad joining the towns of Davisdlle and 'Voodland, in Yolo County, and is between three and four miles to the west therefrom, it,; ge111·ral 1lirection being north 16° 5::V west. It crosses the streams and sloughs running ef1stward across the Sf1cramento Valley. (See illustration 28.) These streams and sloughs, which are dry iu summer, caIT.)' large >olumes of water and are Ruhject to overflows in the rainy season; the efft·ct of these overflows has heen to raise their bauks gradually from some distance 1m either side, so that the, stream may be :said to run on a ridge. Cache Creek (Rio Jesus Maria), ha\'ing the grPat equalizing reservoir of Clear Lake as its source, does 11nt presei1t this feature in a marked degree, but Putah Cl'eek (Hio de las l'ntas), Anderson, Dry and 'Villow Sloughs do. On the south side of Cache Creek bottom tlH·re is a ridge of favorable elevation, thirty-five feet. Upon this ridge Northwest Base was located, four and one-third miles west of the railroad, and immediately on the north side of the county road running west towards Madison aml Copay Valley. Southwest Base, distant 10.9 miles by tlie line, is three and one-eighth miles west and one a,mt one-eighth miles south of the town of DaYisville. Levelings between the two ends of the base, with a reference·fo the bench-mark of the California Paeitic Railroad at Woodland, ga,'e for the elevation of Southeast base 71.26 feet above low-water of the Pacific, and for Northwest Base 153.28 feet; hence Northwest Base is higher than Southeast Base 82.02 feet. It is intended to check this provisional determination by a line of leYels of precision to be carried from Southeast Base to the Coast and Geodetic Survey beuch-mark at Benicia. At the opening of the fiscal yea1· in J nly, 1881, preparations for the m1·asurement were aetiYely begun; bridges or high trestles were constructed for crossing the sloughs: the grading of the line was pnsbed forward; a comparing beam and a steel rod for fractional measure were constructed; a movable cover or tent was made to shelter the base apparatus during the meaRurements and comparisons; the alignment wa~ made, and signals were set up to be tested from the two ends of the base. The line lies through a farming district noted for its rich soil, mid therefore every acre ba·I been under cultivation. Where the crop had been harvested during the season the big·h stubble was cut down close to the ground, which then presented all the irregularities left by the farmer. Twothirds of the line, howe':'er, passed over fallow la.nd where the ground had been plowed in the spring

and in some places had been roughly harrowed. In the work of grading, a roller with cutting-dish was passed over this land to break up the rough clods and in part make it more compact. Many difficulties were presented, howe,·e1, by the dry, baked soil, permeated in not a few places by deep and extensive crackR found to exist below the plowed stratum. Upon the arrival of the baRe apparatus, near the end of July, brick-cemented piers were built at camp, near the midflle of the line and also near each end, upon which to make the comparisons of the hars with the field standard. It had been decided in .January, 1880, that the construction of an additional primary base apparatus was advisable, in view of the necessity of measuring several primary base-lines upon the Pacific coast and within the Rocky Mountain region. In order to secure for the survey au apparatus which should combine accuracy, rapidity of measure, ease of handling, facility of trausportation with least ri:,;k of derangement, and especially one that should require the least amount of grading or other preparation of the ground for measure, Assistant C. A. Schott was directed to submit plans which should fulfill as many of these conditions as practicable; and on l\farcli 1 of that year he proposed the construction of a compensating base apparatus composer! of two measuring-bars, each five meters in length, and submitted his design for the apparatur;, with a description and complete working drawings prepared under his direction by M:r. \Verner Suess, meehanician. Though it presents no novelty in principle, yet in the arrangement and combinatiou of the parts it is novel, as will be :;een by the full description and drawings which l\Ir. Schott has-given in Appendix 7 and illustrations Nos. 26 and 27. Each measuring- bar consists of two overlapping steel bars, firmly fixed to a zinc bar, making a return connection betwl'eu the two former, the forward end of the zinc har being riYeted to the forward end of the rear :;tee] bar, and it8 rear eud to the rear end of the forward steel bar. The three bars thus form but a single one, composed of two metals so proportioned in length that the g-reater expanRion or contraction of the zinc har in one direction is exactly met by the smaller expansion bnt greater length of the 8teel bars moving in the oppo8ite direction. In the construction of the apparatus the specific 11eat of the two metals and their s1uface exposure was studied, all(l a 8eeondary compensation for holding the apparatus firmly on the rear trestl...is, aud thus keeping the rear end at an i1H"ariable distance from the trestle support during the measure, is applied in a simple way, using the T rail and steel bars as one metal and the two zinc bars as the other. Some minor impnn'ements which niay be here referred to are: The manner in which the aligning telescope is adjusted to the bar; the use of a knife-edge turning about a vertical axis on the rear trestle, with a corresponding comb of teeth below the bar for holding it firmly; the use of portable bed-plates for the feet of the trestle~ etc. There is also a ring covering the contact-slide which allows it to be fixed during compar·isons for length. Although thermometer>! are supplied to the apparatus, each end of the compound rigid bar is provided with a Borda or differential scale. Belonging to the apparatus are two standard five· meter bars to be used in comparisons, one for the field, tlrn other for the office. These standards consist of a central steel bar with two zinc bars of half the length of the steel bar, one 011 each side of it, and fastened near tl1e abutting ends. Two Borda scales are secured at the middle of each bar. This arrangement is supposed to be a novel feature. The plan also involved the constrnctiuu of two screw-level comparators after the pattern of Repsold. The design of the a11paratus was submitted h,Y direction of tbe Superintendent to Assistant Davidson for criticism, and his suggestions in some minor details of construction were adopted. U11rivoidable delays took place in the actual work of construction in 1880, and it was not till near the close of June, 1881, that the two measuring bars, the two standards, and trestles were complete(!. During the winter and spring, observations were made for co-efficient of expansion of the various standal'll meters needed for the a1ljnstment of the length of the five-meter standard bars; tbese meters were of cast-steel, and their ends were armed with platinum iridium plugs. It had been iutended to make a practical test of the apparatus in the field before sending it to the Pacific coast, lmt for this there was no time after its completion. The base-bars were first practically used t-0 lay off a line of one hundred meters for a wire-measurement of the line. At the end of each one hundred meters a stub was fi.rml,y driven into the ground, and properly marked, these measures serving as checks against the possible error of omitting to count any bar, or of counting it twice. The result of this wire-measurement came within six-tenths of a meter of that

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

by the appa.ratms. After a test of the working of the bars upon a preliminar_y line of five hundred meters in length, the actual measurement of the base was begun September 19. " Fence stoneli 11 had been placed in line at all the east and west section lines, and at one or two other points, in order to give checks on the work, and to afford checks hereafter, as being likely to be less disturbed at tbe fences. Kilometer stones were carried forward tind planted <luring tbe first measurement, whenever the bar indicated one thousand meters, without regard to any reductions for inclination, etc. The ends of the base had been secured and marked in the most permanent manner in 1880. For a description and sketch of the granite monuments at the ends, and of the precautions observed in marking, see Appendix No. 8 aml accompanying illustrations. As organized for the measurement, the chief of the party, ~Ir. Davidson, had the aid of Assistant J. J. Gilbert, of Subassistauts H. "'\Y. Blair, E. F. Dickins, J. F. Pratt, of Werner Suess as mechanician and of C. B. Hill as recorder. Fourteen men were employed on the line while the work wa.S in progress. Every officer and man had a specific duty assigned to him. The measurement went forward with comparative slowness at first, increasing in rapidity as practi~- made easier the manipulation of the apparatus. Mr. Davidson plumbed end of bars, aligned and lev1 ·led after end of bar, made and broke contact, read the after-Borda scale, and started the general forward movement by giving the word ''Break" when the contact-slide of the forward bar was drawn back, aml the after-bar was drawn back, lifted out, and moved forward. )fr. Gilbert assisted in adjusting sectors, then directed the laying of the plates and setting tile trestles. Mr. Blair alignetl the bars, read forward Borda scale, and checked reading for inclination. Mr. Dickins moved after-end of bar into line, read after-thermometer and the inclination; then guarded the bar left in position. Mr. Pratt prepared the bars for comparisou with the standard, assisted in the comparisons, made fractional bar measurements, and examined sectors. Mr. Suess made such mechanical changes as were necessary, and had charge of moving the portable cover. The records of measurement and of comparison were kept b:y Mr. Hill. Assistant C. A. Schott was p1·esent before the beginning of the first measurement, and remained until its successful progress was assured. His intimate knowledge of the peculiarities of the apparatus and his arlviee and suggestions as to its proper handling were of great value at the outset. His aid was given in the preliminary comparisons, and in the preparations for measurement generally.. Assistant B. A. Colonna had rendered efficient service in the grading and preparation of the line up to the 8th of September, when he was ordered east for special duty which will be referred to under the headings of Sections III aml XVII. The trestle bridges and platforms for crossing strean~s and sloughs were from his plansi and were eonstructed under his direction. Each day, before the measurement began, the bars were compared with the standard bar in the condition in which they had remained overnight. Then the sectors were examined by the leveling instrument, for the determination of the zero of the inclination are. The after-bar was then plumbed over the night-mark, and at its satisfactory measurement the command "Break" announced the forward movement of the bars. The first measurement, starting from Northwest Base, was made in twenty days; the total hours at work were one hundred and eighty-two and one-half, and during the measurements alone one hundred and seventeen hours. The highest number of bars iu one day was two hundred and seventy-one; the average number one hundred and seventy-five. The average time for each bar was two and one-eighth minutes ; the arnrage number of bars per hour t.wenty·eight, and the highest number thirty.nine. After the close of the first measurement the bars were oompare<l with the standard hourly for oue day, and some changes were made in the details of the aligning folescopes; these were subsequently much improved by Mr. Pratt. The second measurement was carried forward in the same direction as the first, and was com1>Jeted in eighteen dayi,i. 'l'he total working hours were one hundred and seventy-one and one fourth, and the actual time occupied in measuring was ninet~·-three and one-half hours, a gain of very nearly a day o\·er the actual working time of the first measure. The highest number of bars in one day was two hundred and seventy-six; the average number one hundred and ninety-four. The average number of bars per hour was tbirt,y-seven, and the highest number forty-nine. -8. Ex. 77-7

Eight 1la;y8 were occupied in a third partial measurement, dming which the higlH·st rnte of spee1l was attained, an ayerage of forty-three bars per honr being measured, aud during 011e of tlw days fift,Y-fonr per honr. In one of the hours of tltis day fifty-se\·eu bars were measnrn1l, a111l 1\11ring· the whole day tlm·e hundred and tweur~·-fonr bars or UH 111iles. epou the completion of the mea:o;nrements the apparatus was brought to camp, and adjusk1l 1m the compariug-bearn for comparisons with t,}ie standar1l.

Hnring liis stay in \Vasliiugton, Mr. Daddson was appointed by the 'J'ra111'iit. of Venus CommiHsion to take charge of oue of the parties for the obsern1tio11 of the 'I'ransit of lKS:!, at a station in tlte United States. l'l'imar.11 trianpulation and reconna.issa.nce of the north coast of Oalijornfo.-Towards the close of Aug'nst, 1881, Assistant A. F. Ho1lgers had completed the occupation of King·'s Peak, ouc of the stati011s of tlie primary triangulation of the north coast of California. He had obsernid the tiual directions needed to connect Hreat Uaspar Station with Sanhedrim, Cahto, aud Lassac, and hail received instrncUons to revise the reconnaissance northward from the line King Peak-I..assac, and to determine a practicable scheme as far north as Point Saint George, near Crescent City. In the scheme, as originally laid out, Elk Ridge had been included, but it was found subsequently that an interYeniug range of hills made the line King Peak-Elk Ridge inYisiblc, and the line Elk Ridge-Lassac 1lonbtful. Reducing his camp equipment aml instrumental outfit to the smallest com1mss, Mr. l{odgers Yisited the l{ainhow Mountains, North and South Taylor's Peak, Wild Oat Ridge, Bear River Hidge, Humboldt II ill, Mad Rh'er, Ki- wett., and other 11eaks and ridges of the Coast Ifange. Many of these summits were heavily timbered, and north of Humbohlt Bay mountain trails afforded the 0111~- means of communication. The statem('nt girnn by Mr. Uodgers of the distances and elevations (by barometer) on the journey from Humboldt Bay in a northeasterly _direction to Ki-wett will illustrate some of the difficulties of the reconnaissance, and explain the delays unavoidably met with before the scheme was finally developed: "Distance from Humboldt Bay to Ki-wett hy trail, sixty miles.

Triangulation, topography, and hydrography of the Columbia Rfrer.-Assistant Clen'h1·1tl Hockwell was in the field at the opening of the fiscal year, acting under instn11~tious whid1 directed him to continue the sun"ey of the Columbia River from the limits of former work uear Kalama and Saint Helen's towards Vancouver and Portland. Having organized his part)" upon the sloop Kincheloe, and parpy completed the hydrography of the river above Kalama., t.he fnrtht·r prosecution of this part of the work was postponed on account of the high stage of water, and the triitngulation taken up from the line Table Cliff-Lewis RiYer Hills, abo,·e Saint Helen's. At Scappoose Station, one of the first occupied during the season, a great deal of cutting and burning of heavy timber had to be done to open lines of sight. This was the ca~w also at station \Yillanwt. ou the west side of the vVillamet Rirnr. By the 12th of October the seheme of secoudary trianµ:ulation was completed to tlie line Balch-Trecon Rocky Butte in the vicinity of Portland. The hydrography was then resumed, and by November 24 soundings were completed from the Yicinity of Kalama to Columbia City. Bench-marks for reference of the soundings had been established at Martin's Island and Saint Helen's, in connection with the tide-staff.'! set UIJ al thoise stations, and after the close of the season Mr. Rockwell fixed bench-marks at Kalama am~ Rainier of a more permanent charactcl'. This done, the Kincheloe was laid up for the winter at, Albina, near Portland. Statistics of the season's work are as follows:

and arrangements were nearly complete for beginning the topography of the n1lley of the Columbia from the line Reed-Scappoose, above Saint Helen's. llfagnetic observations.-In order to obtain additional data required for the construction and publication of a new edition of the Magnetic Chart of the United States, and for the discussion of the secular change of the magnetic declination, Assistant J. S. Lawson was detailed, at the opening of the fiscal year, to occupy a number of stations in Oregon, Washington Territory, and Idaho, including in their number stations at which the magnetic elements had been determined from ten to twenty years before. His instrumental outfit consisted of a theodolite magnetometer, a dip circle, and a three-inch alt-azimuth instrument (Casella) for determinations of azimuth and geographical position. Having made a complete set of observations at the base station, San Francisco, Mr. Lawson began his journey thence oil the 13th of July. On his return in December, he had occupied twelve stations in Oregon, twelve in Washington Territory, and three stations in Idaho. Included in this number were the following named principal or secular change stations: Portland, Astoria, and The Dalles, in Oregon; Walla Walla, W allula, Seattle, and Port Townshend, in Washington Territory; and Siniaquotem, in Idaho. Upon the completion of this work Assistant Lawson was directed to report for duty at the sub-office in San Francisco. . His field-work in Section X before the close Of the fiscal year has already been referred to. Magnetic observations.-The magnetic cruise of the steamer Hassler, under the command of Lieut.-Commander H. E. Xichols, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sllrvey, has been referred to already under the heading of Section X. Two stations in Washington Territory, Nee-ah Bay and Cape Disappointment, were occupied in the course of the cruise lit dates respectively of October 10 and October 13. Other magnetic determinations at stations in Alaska and British Columbia will be mentioned under the head of Section XII. Triangulation and topography in Puget Sound.-Assistant Eugene Ellicott, to whom had been assignt>d the topographic survey of the shores of Port Orchard, one of the inlets of Puget Sound, prosecuted that work until its completion towards the close of September, 1881, and then took up the triangulation of Hood's Canal. The weather during the remainder of the field season proved exceptiollally unfavorable for observation. The close proximity of the Olympic Mountains to the locality of work, l\fr. Ellicott thinks, had a tendency to emphasize the bad weather which prevailed so constantly. Early in December field operations were closed, and, in accordance with subsequent instructions, Mr. Ellicott reported for duty upon the Atlantic coast. Hydro,q-raphy of Port Discovery and Washington Harbor.-At the opening of the fiscal year, 1881-'82, Lieut. Perry Garst, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, in command of the schooner Eamest, was engaged in a hydrographic survey of Port Discovery, one of the inlets of Puget Sound, Washington Territor_r. His instructions involved a limit of work, including 'Vashingr.on Harbor, and extending out to and around Protection Island and Dallas Bank, thence ea,;twardly towards Point 'Vilson, and westwardly to Kulo Kala Point. The hydrography within these limits was completed on the 10th of October, and the vessel was then laid up for the winter at Olympia.

straits and anchorages in Alaskan waters. Between July 29 and October 5, determinations of the magnetic elements were made at nine stations in British Columbia and at. the fol!Qwing named four stations in Alaska: Sh.akeeu, i~ort W ran gel, How can, and Sitka. In Ward's Cove, at tl1e wpr.;tt·rn end of Tongas Straits, a dangerous ledge was developed with a least depth on it of th;ee feet at low wat~r. A hydrographic reconnaissance of W rangel Straits for the benefit of the mail ste.amerR was completed on the 30th of August. At the request of the Rev. Sheldon .Jackson, and with official approval, a survey and reconnaissance was made from Cape l\Iuzon through Kaigahnee Straits to Tlerak Narrows. The records of these surveys have been forwarded to the office, antl will be available for the new edition of the Coast Pilot of Alaska, now in preparation. In October the Hassler arrived at San Francisco and completed her magnetic cruise, Lieutenant-Oommandn Nichols having reoccupied the base-station" Presidio'1 October 31. Duriug the winter all of the magnetic records and results were finished and sent to the office, and at the date at which this report closes Lieutenant-Commander Nichols is again in the waters of Southern Alaska with the Hassler, engaged in hydrographic surveys, having left San Fra11cisco under instructions for that work in May, 1882. Tidal observations--'fidal records and tabulations from the self-registering tid<i-gauge established at Saint Paul, on Kadiak Island, Alaska, have been regularly received at the office. This gauge, put up in July, 1880, upon the wharf of the Alaska Commercial Company, was placed in charge of Mr. W. J. Fisher. A series of meteorological observation!'! is kept, np at the tidal station. SECTION XIII.

Determination of the umgitude of N asliville, Tenn.-Tlle organization of the telegraphic longitude parties and their work in Section III has already been referred to. Upon the completion of the determination of the longitude of Cincinnati by telegraphic exchanges from Washington, D. C., as stat.e<l under the heading of that section, the party of Assistant Dean was transferred to Nash\·ille, Tenn., while Assistant Smith remain.ed at Cincinnati. The instruments were in position at Nashville on the 18th of August, and all arrangements made for exchange of signals, but a week of unfavorable weather followed and before an exchange could be effected, Assistant Dean was taken severely ill, and was obliged to give np the charge of his party temporarily to Subassistant C. H. Sinclair. Between August 25 and f9 four good nights were obtained; the observers then changed places, and four nights were obtained between September 1 and Sept,ember 6. For the determination of the latitude of the station at Cincinnati, observations were made by Snbassistant Sinclair with the transit-iustmment N'o. 4, which had beeu 1itted with a micrometer amt delicate level for use as a zenith tdescope. The occupation of Saint Louis, the third station in the lougitndt> triangle, Cincinnati-Nashville-Saint Louis, will be reforrecl to under tlae heads of Se~tions XIY and XV. Triangulatfon of the State of Kentuoky.-In continuation of the triangulation of the State of Kentucky, Mr. Carl Schenk, Acting Assistant, took the field early in July, 1881. The first station occupied was "Williams," a station in Indiana, which connected directly with the ends of the baiill' measured in Kentucky, and was common also to four quadrilaterals, extending from the Ohio River in the vici!!Jty of New Albany and Louisville to a point south of Salt River, a tributary or the Ohio which empties into it at West Point. Owing to the hazy cornlition of the atmosphert> during July and August, and also to the smoke from the factories of Louisville, New Albany, and Jeffersonville, it was found necessary to establish heliotropes at the principal stations observed upon from Williams, namely, Bangs and Potts, in Indiana, and Cox, Riley, }fountain Top, antl Blind .Asylum, in Kentucky. Measurements of horizontal angles at Williams were completed September 221 and at Potts-the ne~t station occupied-on November 1. Preparations for the occupation of Bangs Statioa, located on the rh·er hills north of New Albany, Ind., were in progress when orders were received to close work for the seagon. The records and abstracts of the work have been forwarded to the office.

Telegropltic longit11de.~.-The determination of the long·itude of two of the stations in 'the longitude triangle, Cincinnati-Nashville-Saint Louis, has already been referred to nuder the headings of 8ections III and XIII. Upon the completion of the longitude exchanges between Cincinnati and Nashville, the party at the latter l'ltatiou moved to Saint Louis, and Assistant Dean, h:n-ing recovered from his illneRs, resumed the charge of the work at Cincinnati. T1ongitude signals were exchanged on fonr uights betwee11 Septemher 12 and September 21; the observers then changed places, all(l four more nights were had between September 23 and October·>.

Geodetic operations in Ohio.-In continuation of the triangulation of the 8tate of Ohio, Prof, R S. De,"ol, Acting Assistant in tlte Coast aud Geodetic 8nrvey, re8mned field-work about the middle of .Jnly, 18:-11. A scheme of triangulation Laving been de\'eloped during the previous seal'lon, with stations locatrnl in ti.HJ conuties of Athem;, Vinton, and lloeking, Professor Deni} put up ohseni11g tripotls and scaffolds at Se Yen stations, and 011 the J 7tl1 of August oecupied ]\fount Nebo Station, ill Athens UOLmty. Owing to an excessive and long-continued drought, and the pre\"aleuce of extensive forest fires, a hazy condition of the atmosphere was produced very. unfavorable to rap ill progress, and it was not till the 30th of September that the .observations at Mount Neho were completed. The part~· was then transferred to Brooks Station, iu Hocking County, where obserrntions were in progress, a111l 1>artly finished when the field operations were closed October 22. Special care was given during the season to the marking of the stations-underground, surface, and reference marks being placed at the principal points. Elevations were determined hy barometer; hourly harometric observations were taken on several days at Mount Nebo, and curves were plotte(l to show the daily \'ariatious of pressure. 'l'he records of observation have been forwarded to tlte office. The total number of measurements was six hundred and sixty-four. fteodetic operations in In1limui.-A.s the result of a recmmaissance made by Prof. J. L.

starting as a base from the li11e Hangs-13liud Asylum, aud stretching northward for about tweutyProfessor Campbell has presented a full report of his reconnaissance, speci(ying tile stations at, which high tripods and observing scaffolds must be erected, and thm;e between which lines of sight must he opened. Barometric observations for the approximate determination of heights were taken at all farnr<tble opportunities dnri11g the progresri of the reconnaissance, thr, ir.iteutiou being to cumpare the rei'lnlts obtained by barometer with thoile given by le\-eling. 'rhe season closed with the month of Septemher. In fixing the location of high points for ob:Ser\-ing stations, Professor Campbell was led to notice the fact of tbe general elevation of the swamp lands of the State above the <iha1111el:-; of the main water-coursei;, and deemed it of sufficient impornrnce to be communica,tetl to the State legislature through the governor, Hon. Albert G. Porter. Action looking to the reclamation of these lautls was subsequently taken by tile State authorities, and during tlte s11ri11g and sttmmer of 1882 Professor Campbell, with my aNiroval, was in charge of works undertaken for this purpose. Upon tlte completion of that 1l11t,,-, he will resume the clmrge of geodetic operations iu tile State. Reconnais8anr:e for the e.vtension of the primary triangul<ition e<l8tward in I llinoi8 and Indiana.In pursuance of instructions.to resume the reconnaissance for the extension of the primar~' tria11gn_ fa.tion from the eastern boundary of lllinoi1-1 eastwarcl through Indiana and Ohio along the thirty-uintl1 parallel, Ast>istaut F. \V. Perkins took the field at the opelliug of the fi:'lcal year, and starting from the line, Hunt City-Claremont, uear the eastern boundary of Illinois, as a Lase of operations, he pushed the reconnaissance until tile seheml' was exte11de1l a,, far as a line running north through Mitchell, Ind. The season prm-ed exceptionally nntavorable owing to the extreme drought and tlte resulting smokr llOndition of the atmosphere. Early in December the work was hronght to a close, and the records and sketches were transmitted to the office. The subsequent work of Assistant Perkin8 on the coast of Texas has heen referre1l to nuder the l1eadiug of Section IX. GeodeMc leueliny.-~arly in .Jane, 1882, Assi!'ltant Andrew Braid began the work of connecting the terminal point of the li1w of geodesic levels of 1879 at l\fitchell, Ind., with a permanent bench-mark of the l\fississippi Ri\rer Commission at or near Saint Louis, Mo. Beginning at Vincennes, Iml., aud working ea,stwiml, fifty miles ha<l been nm at the close of the fiscal year, leaving a distance of sixteci1 miles to finish the line of levels of pi·ecisiou between Vincennes and Mitchell. Contiriiw,tion of tlw primary t1·imig1tlation across the State of lllinois.-TIJ.e -pri mar~- trhn1gulatio11 across the State of Illinois, forming part of the geodetic connection of the Atlantic autl Pacific coast triangulations, was a<lvanced in 1881 by the occupation of three primary stations. Assistant George A.. Fairfiehl, in charge of this work, was at Berger Station, in the vicinity of Lebanon, Saint Clair County, Illinois, at the opening of the fiscal year. Obsernttions were begun Jnly l;') and continued till August 10, when they were completed. Parkinson Station, near Highland, Madison Connty, was next o·~eupied. Between Augui;;t. 21 and September 28, all observations needed :tt this station had been obtained, aml preparations were immediately made for moving camp to Geoffrey Station, about nineteen miles southeast of Parkinson. During a ver~· viulent ga,Ie which prevailed upon the night of the arrival of the party, the signal at Geoffre;r was blown down. It was at onue rebuilt, and obse!'vations were begtm October 19. Field operations were closed November 6, wlten the wm·k at Geoffrey was finished. Assistant Fairfieltl 'reports that the weather throughout the season wa,._ the most nnfa,-orable that he had ever experiencell. It w.is marketl by intense beat and an almost nnprecedlmted drought. In the observing tent at midnight the thermometer wa.s :tt, times 102° Fabr. The air was constantly tilled with fine <1111,;t taken ap from the roads and plowed fields where it was at least six inches deep. Thick ])Jack smoke from the soft coal used as fuel ou the numerous Iiues of railroall and in factories and flour-mills, combined with the dmst to make an at,mosphere through which signals were -seldom Yisible during the day. It was only by the use of student-lamps, fitted with reflectors RO as to be effective for night signals, as suggested by Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle (Appendix No. 8, Report for 1880), that good progress was made in the work. On elear nights, these lamps, showing a bright point of light, were readily seen wit4 the naked eye at stations twenty-six mHes distant, thongh at times when the atmosphere was thick with dust and smoke

they were not visible through the tele8cope at a distance of eighteen miles. All of the obsen·ations, except those upon secondary points, such as church spires, etc., were made at night upon the student-lamp reflectors. For future occnpation, two tripod and scaffold signals, each seventy-five feet in height, were erected, one at Hoile and the other at Sturgis Station, and au ordinary tripod signal at Bording Station. Subassistant John R ·weir was attad1ed to the party, and rendered valuable aid throughout the season. At Geoffrey Rtation he made all of the observations with good results. He ran also a line of levels from Berger Station t-0 the town of Summerfield, Ill., on the Ohio and Mississippi Hailroad, establishing there a bench-mark which will ultimately be connected with the transcontinental line of leveling of precision.

Davies took the field at the beginning of the fiscal year. His work involved a thorough reconnaissance of tlie country between Gratiot's Grove and Beloit, near the southern boundary of Wisconsin, with a view to fill up the gap in triangulation mainly to the wmit and partly to the east of Rock River, au<l also the occupation of as many of the stations as the length of the working season would permit. The reconnaissance made by Professor Da\ics developed two schemes of triangulation, one i·esting upon the line Fayette-Blue lfounds as a base; the other proceeding towards Beloit from. the line Oakland-Union, both of which last-named stations are to the southeastward of Madison . .A re-occupation of Gratiot\; Grm·e had become necessary in order to establish with the requisite accuracy the 11osition of the signal at Sherrill's Mound in Iowa. The location of this signal, on a low hill jnst across the Mississippi River, and its frequent obscuration by the river fogs, induced Professor Davies to resort to the use of night-signals in the form of student-lamp reflectors as proposed by Assistant C. 0. Bontelle. With the observations upon Sherrill's Mound were combined observations upon Platte Mound and Fayette. Full sets of angles were obtained upon the night· signals established at these stations with very satisfactory results. These measurements occupied the month of July. Three more stations, Mount Pleasant, Union, and Magnolia, were oceupiell during the season which closed with the month of September. Records and computations of the work have been sent to the office.

JJagrtetia obser,vations.-It was decided in October, 1881, to bring to a close the magnetic observations at the magnetic observatoi-y in the grounds of the University of Wisconsin. The Brooke differential magnet-0graphs had furnished records of magnetic phenomena since March, 1877, but owing to the dit'ffoulty of obtaining longer the necessary photographic, mechanical, and scientific skill in the mana~·ement of the apparatus without a greatly increased expenditure, the observer temporaril~- in charge was directed to take down the apparatus and forward it with the portable magnetometer and dip-circle to the office as soon as the usual annual determination could he made of the 1ibsolute values of the declination, dip, and intensity. Mr. Werner Suess was instructed to make the observations for these values, and did so in No,·ember, 1881, on his return from the Pacific coast.

Telegraphi<' lmigitudes.-The determination of the lougitude of Saiut J,ouis, )lo., by telegraphic exchanges from Nashville, Tenn., occupied the longitude pa,rties during the month of October, 1881. Their work in Sections III, XIII, and XIV has alrea41.Y lwen stated n11tler tl1e heads of those secti.ous. For the first series of exchanges, with Assistant G. W. Dean <lt Saint Louis, a11d Assistaut Edwin Smith at NashYille, obsenations were made on four nights between .Octol.ler lU aml Oct.ouer 22, and after the change of places of the observers, four more night" were ohtai11ed between Octobee 2.3 and November 1. Tue latitude of the 8t<ttiou at Saint Louis was determined by Mr. F. H. Parsons, aid in Assista,nt Dean's party, with Transit Xu. (i. Preparations had been made before the completion of the last seriel:! of excliauges for the occupation of a station at Vincennes, Ind., and the determination of its loug·itmle from Nash\·ille and from Saint Louis. The Saint Louis party mo\·ed to Vincennes. Exchanges were had on the nightti of Novembe.l· 12, 13, and 1!, between Na,,;hville aml Vincennes, and again on the nights of .November 16, 19, and 24, in the changed position of the Oh8ern'l'S. A;:sistant Dean having been then relieved from duty at his own recp1e:'!t, Subassistant 0. H. Sinclair ·was left in charge of the Vincennes Statiou. The Xash ville party 1111ffed to Saint Louis, and the determination of' the longitude of Vincennes from ::faint Louis was made on the nights of November 28, December 7, 8, and 9 with Mr. Smith at Saint Lnui:; and 1\Ir. Sinclair at Vincennel:!. Similar determinations were made on the nights of December 14, rn, and 23, t.he observers having changed places, as usual, to eliminate the effect of personal equation. This completed the determination of the longitude triangle ~ash ville-Saint Lonis-Vincenne<-<, and work for the seanon was theu clm1ed. The latitude of the statwn at Vincennes had been e11tablished by Suba::ssistant Sinclair with Transit No. 4. During the past two years, special attention has been gh'en to the study of impr<wed forms of i11sti·un11.rnttl ~md apparatus for the use of the longitude parties. To do awa.\' wit!J the necessity of nsiug 11eparate instruments for observing time and latitude, tlH' forty-six aud forty .eig-ht iucl1 trausits, heretofore used solely fordet(WUlinatious of tinw, were fitted for lutitutlP observations, a1,; already we11tio11ed. 'rwo new chronographs, hy Fauth & Co., with t,Yliudcrs eleren iuche:s i11 diaml:'ter a111.l about fourteen inches in lengt.l1, were used. These chronographs were so arranged that the speed of the cyliuder coul<l he doubled ~hen required. 'l'heir working was in ge11t'ral quite satisfaetor,Y, but some excess of friction made itself apparcut in vm·,v cold weather. 'rhi~, with ot!Jer Rlight defect,,, detected on a tirst trial in the field, will doul>tle.-is l>e remedied without difficulty. Experiments made during the. previous season had led to the construction of lHW signa,\ i·ehtni, made after the plan of the Farmer relays, with slight modifications, the helices being oue and a half iuche.s iu length, aud the resistance three hundred and fifty ohms. Measurements of th1> arm}lt.nre ancl t.r1u1smission times obtained with these relays, were less than heretofore fouml in circuits of equal lengtlJ, and the Yariation of the separate results from the mean Yalne was so small tl.iat the errors in the longitudes due to armature and transmission time are quite insignificant. For the determination of' time, tbe same stars, seleete1l from the Amerimm Ephemeris aml tlte Berli11 Catalogue, were observed a.t the stations between which exchanges were in progress, the stars being al'rauged in groups, two of which were observed he fore the excha.nge of signals and two or more after. The insulation of the wire and the resi:'!tance of the line and batteries were tested on ea.ch longitude night as soon as the lines became available; signals from the break-circuit chronometers were then recorded upon the chronographs at the t"espectiYe stations, in order to i<leutit'y the time of exchange, and to obtain a careful adjustment of tbe relays ; then followe(l the exchange of a.bout thirty arbitrary signals for longitude. Bight or ten minutes on each night sufficed for the actual oocupa.tfon of the telegraph line, when it could be hail absolutely free from interruption. Original and duplicate records of the season's work hase been completed and forwarded ro the oftiee; a.lso abstracts of the preliminary reductions.

D. Granger organized his party at Sedalia, Mo., at the beginning of the fiscal year. The triangulation bad been advanced during previous seasons up to the liue Heard-Schnackenberg, which formed also the western limit of the reconnaissance. Heard Station, near Sedalia, in Petti:,; County, bad been occupied, and Schnackenberg, near the town of Cole Camp, Benton County, about fifteen miles in a southeastwardly direction, bad been observed upon. Making this line bi:,; base of operations, Mr. Hrauger made a general examiuation of the country to the westward as far as the Kansas and Missouri State line. The whole country gone oYer was in its general character rolling, interspersed with broken ground-about rme-fifth of its entire area woodedand the open portion principally farm lands divided often by high hedges of Osage orange, and veined with the beds of small streams which were mostly dry, except during.the raiuy season.

Ptimary tria1igulatio11 in Neva<la.-The extension to the eastward of the transcontinental primary triangulation, by the occupation of stations in Nevada, was placed in charge of Assistant William Eimbeck. At the beginning of the fiscal year his party was established in camp upon Mount Callahan, one of the peaks of the Sierra Nevada, haying an elevation of upwards of ten thousand two hundred feet. Between June 28 and August 3, 1881, observations of horizontal directions and vertical angles were obt.ained upon five primary station107 and a number of secondary points. Observations were all;o made for time, latitude, azimuth, and the magnetic elements. A bench-wark was established on the Nevada Uentral Railroad, at a distance of about ten IDiles from the station. This bench-mark wa.i,; connected with the triangulation, and the difference of elevation between it and the station was cletennined by observatious of vertical angles. This bench-mark and others similarly fixed in position will be available as stations in lines of level of precision, and their reference in ele\'atiou to the mountain peaks will greatly facilitate the e.¥:act determination of heights. High winds were an obstacle to prog-rc1>s, uot unfrequentJy, at Mount Uallahan, one of the severest gales lasting five da,vs anti nights. Upon the completion of thi8 station, early in August, preparations were begun for the occupation of Eureka, a peak nearly ten thousand seven hundred feet in height. By the 25th of August the instruments were mounted and in readiness for beginning observations. These were made at every favorable opportunity, but not without much interruption from the unusually cold a.nd boisterous weather. Horizontal directions were observ"41 upon ft ve primary stations, and upon many secondary

objects in twenty positions of r,he theodolite; double zenith distances were obsen·ed upon all primary and many secondary points; obsen·ations for azimuth npon Polaris were made with the theodolite in twenty-five positions; for latitude twent.v-two pairs of stars were obsened for five nights. The magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were determined by observations on four days. On the 23d of Septemht>r ocClllT(~d th('. first ~mow-storm of the sea,son, and the ternp1wature fell to mo Fahr. The occupation of Enn'ka was completed on the 5th of Oct-0ber. Teams with freight and pack animalR were at once stttrted for the hase of the 'Yhitc Pine Range, the 11ext. station being White Pine, a peak over elenm thon1Sand three hundrt>d feet in height, and wr;v ahrnpt. ragged, and rocky. A three dayis' ;;now·Rtorm, whidt prevailed while preparationio; for the occupation were in progress, caused ROtne dela~-, bt1t b,Y the first of ~ovember e\'erything was m readinesg for work. Obserrn.tions of horizontal directions, double zenith distances, and for magnetic dt>clinatiou. dip, and intensity were made until the middle of December. when the gtation wa,s finished, and field operations closed. Mr. R. A. Marr sened as Aid in the part,\·. Earl~- in the winter Aio;siRtant Eimbeck waR direct.ed to report for offke duty, and before returning to the field ha.rl completed the record,; aJHl results of his ;;easou 's work. Primary triangnlatfon fo Colorado.-At the opl'lling of the fo;cal year the primary triangulation in Colorado had heen Pxhmded eastward along or near t.he thirt;\·-ninth parallel to the line HugoAdobe.

Firn :stations were observed upon, and the azimuth of the lines of direction determined. For latitude, obsen·ations were made with zeuit h telescope ~o. 4. Work at this station waR complPted on Aug·nst 17. Owing to detentio11 by rains, wl1ieh rendered the prairies impassable for wa,:,:-ous, se\·eral cla,ys were occupied in transferring the party to a suitahle camping grountl at the next station, Arro;\·a, near a railway station of t.hat name, on the Kanisas Pacific Railroad. Four miles southwest of this, the trigonometric point wa1S established on a high sand~· ridge, dh·iding the waters of H.nsh Creek from those of the Big 8amly. Before beginning observations at Arroya, it war; necessary to construct aml erect signals at the two primary stations, Kit Carson and Eureka, the locations of which had been determined in a previouR reconnaissance. Horizontal angles were observed upon five stations, and on the completion of the work, September 5, station Ornrlantl., abont Rixteeu miles north of Arroya, was occupied. Here, in addition to the observationR of horizontal angles, an azimuth was determined which g·arn a very satisfactory agreement with the azimuth observed at Kist Base, as carried forward by computation. On September 26 the party mm·ed to Eureka Station. in San .hrnn County. From this station the reconnaissance was extended eastward for the selection of two primar,v stations. These were named Landsman and :First View, and were included in t,he obsen·ations ma.de from Hureka. The work at this station, and at the next oue, Kit Carson, in Bent, County, occnpied the party till the last of October, when field operations closed. Measurements of vert.ical angles were made at. all of the Rtations during the season, and secondar~· points determined wbeneYer practicable. By the kind permission of T1iente11ant Reed, U. S. A., commanding offi.ce.r at Fort Wa11ace, the. instruments and camp eqnipn.ge were ston~d at that post. MesRr8 .·T. E. McGra.t.b and <~. F.

COAST AND GEODETIC SU'BVEY OFFICE.
During: the ye<u then· were se\·eral changes in the personnel of the office. At the opening of the year I was, a;; for m<W.Y years 1n·c\·ious, Assistant in charge of Office and Topography. Upon the dertth of the late Supt.·rillkudent, to which event full reference has been made, I was appointed h,\- the Secretar.r of the 'I'reatlur,\· a:-; Ar;&iistant iu charge of the Coast and Geodetic Stuvey, pending the appoiutment of a succes1>or to Mr. Patterson. For several months I filled the double position of .AHHiHtant in charge of the SmTey anrl Assistant in charge of Office and Topography, being aided in the duties of the latll~r positio11 by Assistant Edward Goodfellow, who for several years past bad bt>en rn.v irnmelliatc as:sistant in the exec11tio11 of office details, and to whot1e experience and· judgment I am much irnlel1ted for the light~uing of the labors of the double duty devolving upon me. Upon the return of A81:ii8ta11t Richard D. Cutts from duty in the field, he was assigned temporarily, on Nornmber 4, to the position of Assistant in charge of Office and Topography, and upon my own appoiutment, December ~3, as Superintendent, Assistant Cutts assumed the permanent charge of the dntiet1 appertaining to that position. Assistant Edward Goodfellow continued to a.id in the exee11tive details and the official corr&· Rpondeuce of the office from .J nly 1 to April 4, 1882, at which date he was relieved by Subassistant

H. W. Blair, who discharged dnring the remainder of the fiscal year the duties of the position to the entire satisfaction of tile Assistant in charge and with credit to himself. The clerical duties were, as heret-0fore, ably performed by Mr. Wm. B. ·French. During the year Prof. \Vm. -Ferrel continued his inYestigatiorn; of metPorological and tidal phenomena, and prepared the third part of hh; "Meteorological n.esearches," thr. paJJer being d£\'Oted to barometric hypsometry and re<lnction of the barometer to sea-len~l. This paper has been puhfo1hed as Appendix No. 10 to my [{eport for 1881. Mr. Ferrel also dCYised a tidepredicting machine, which has heen com;tructed under hi;; general :snpen·ision by Fauth & Co., of \Vashington, D. C. The working drawings were prepared and mechanical details arranged hy Mr. Saegmnller, the chief mechanician, to whose mechanical ingenuity the successful completion of the work is very largely dne. Further improvements have heen ma.1le in the circular di,-i<1ing machine. ;'fr. i::iacgmuller has made an elaborate redetermination of it::; errors of gra<lnatio11. A ne>\· automatic cleaner and stop ha.ve been added; also a new turbine wheel to replaee the old one, which had become much worn. By the use of the reservoir ml·ntioned i11 the last annual Rf'port, a constant head ~md consequent uniform power is maintained for dridng the machine. The Drawing and BngraYing ni,·isions haYe been pushed t-0 their utmost capacity in the endea\-or to supply the increased demand for tl1e results of th!:' 1-mne,YS. This demand bas also prompterl the iss11ing of a relath-ely large numher of charts hy the photolithograpbic methrnl.

Mr. J.B. Boutelle, extra observer, reported at the office in November, and was:assignecl to duty in the Drawing Division, where he served until ordered to field-work in January. Computing Division.-As heretofore, this division was under the charge of Assistant Schott, In August Mr. Schott went to California to take part in the measurement of the Yolo Base witu the fi\'e-meter compensating base bars that had been constructed during the previous year under his direction and according to his plans. During bis absence, Mr. E. H. Courtenay was i11 ·temporary charge of the Computing Division. :Mr. Schott returned to \Vashington in Oct,ober. ln addition to the labor of supervising the office computation of all geodetic, magnetic, and astronomical work done ou the Survey, Mr. Schott made the eomparisous and computations for a redetermination of the length of the five-meter standard No. 2, and determiuecl the length aml coefficient of expansion of a meter-bar belonging to the U11ited States Signal Sen·ice. He also prepared a revised and enlarged edition (the third) of his pamphlet ou thr fl.etermination of time, latitude, and a,zimuth. This is printed as Appendix No. 14 to the Ueport of 1880. A tliird edition of his paper on the measurement of terrestrial magnetism was aliso prepared, aud is printed a8 Appendix No. 8 t-0 the Report of 1881. In addition t-0 these papers he has made a "collection of magnetic results," comprising aH results obtained by the <Joa,st aud Geodetil' 8nrYey from 1833 to ,July, 1882, at more thau six hundred stations, giving the magnetic ele111e11ts, and, where possible the descriptious of stations.

During the remainder of the year he was on duty iu the office of tile Hydrographic Inspector. He protractoo, }llotted, or drew nineteen hydrographic sheets, of which five were off the coast of Maine, two off the coast of l\fassaclmsetts, three of the Delaware River, one in Long Islaud Sound, one of Chincoteague Shoals, Va., two of the Eliza.beth River, Va., and five oft' the Florida coast. He made, also, eleven tracings of hydrographic sheets, corrected Aids to Navigation of numerous charts, ma<le reductions of atlditioual hydrography on former sheets, verified several coast and harbor charts, and brought up progress sketches and attended to various minor details of office work. Mr. F. C. Donn, hydrographic draughtsman, was temporarily d.etacued at the beginning of the fiscal year for duty on the topographical survey of the site for the uew Naval Observatory. He was reassigned on the 1st of August, and during that month was in the field on hydrographie duty. For the remainder of the fil!C~ year he was on office duty. He protracted, plotted, inked, or drew, fourt.een hydrograpbic sheets, of which one was of a. portion of the Delaware River, five

ott' the Florida coast, six off the Pacific coast of the United States, and two off the coast of

Alaska. In addition to these he made tracings from, reduced, or made projections for, twenty-four other original sheets. The full revort of the hydrographic inspector appears in Appendix No. 6. lJrnwing .Dfrision.-This division has continued under the charge of l\lr. ,V. T. Bright. Iu it all original topographic sbeet.s are examined ; reductions made from them for the preparation of plates for engraved charts; drawings made for such charts as are to he published hy photolithographic process; progresA sketches for the aunual reports prepared or brought up to date; drawing:;, wade for engrasiug or photolitlwgraphiug illustrations to special papers in the annnal report:;; µrojections furnished to field parties for topographic or hydrographie work; tracings made frow origiual sheets, and information furnished iu res11onse to special calls. Duriug tile year there lw.s been a marke1l iucrease in the number of first-class charts pro<lncetl by the photolitbographic process. Ill this way the office has been enabled to prepare for publication, and to issue to tlie public, the information obtained from combined original fiel<l-notes and isheets, without the delay attendant upon the preparation of engraved plates. Charts prepared by this method, while embodying the correct results of the latest sun-eys, are but transient iu nature, and intended only to supply the urgent uemand for information relating to the particular localit,y. Au edition of these, Hufficient to meet all probable call;;, is printed for uRe duriug the time that the engraved plates are in course of preparation. 'l'he report from the Drawing Division, which appears in Appendix No. G, shows the force employed alHl the special character of work done by Pach member of the division. Appendix No. 4 gfre8 a list of the charts, sketches, aml illustrations that were comvleted or in progress during the year, and al1-10 a detailed statement of tile work executed b~- eaeb draughtsman. A ::;tat.ement of the iuformation furuh;hed from the division tu meet special requests during the year is embodied iu Appendix :So. 3. E119rari11y Dit·iNion.-During the past year this divbion wa.s under the charge of Assistant ll. U. Ogden. In a<lditiou to the work dont- upon plates of charts, there were made a uumber of plates of illustratious for the Coast. Pilot, a1Jd for sketches and illustrations for the Annual B.eport of the ~uperi11te11de11t. 'l'he report 8lwws a total of two hundred aud forty-fom· plates upon wilich work was doue. 1'lateH of twenty-eight charts and tweuty-three sketches and illustmtio11.s wm·e eowpleted. Pour charts and t.we11ty-m1e sketches and illustratious were commenced. Uue hundred :mu thirty-two chart;;; :tlHl twehTe sketches received additions and correctiuns. At the close, of the fis1:al year there were on hand thirty. uiue plates of charts, and nineteen of :sketclie,.; and illnstrationti, upou which work was iirogressing. Mud1 a<lditio11al work il1 correctiug plates, has beeu eutailed by the many changes in the pol'.li. tions of lmoys autl light ships in tlie Vir:-;t and Third Light-Homse Districts. By au al'I'angemeut between Ute H.n1mgraphic lllspector a11<l the Liglit-Hou::;e Board, the Aids to NaYigatiou are correctetl hy tile i11.spPctors of thl· light-house tlistricts, whereby all clianges are promptly reported, and the accuracy aIHl value of the charts gl'eatly inc1·eased. A detailed statement of the force employed in the division will be found in Appendix No. 6, aud in Appendix ~ o. 5 is giveu it statement of the work executed b,y the engravers. At the beginning of the fiscal year the control of the printing-office was transferred to the Bngnwing Dh-ision. ·rwo presses are constantly in t1se, one in charge of Mr. F. Moore, the foreman of the room, the other in charge of Mr. D. N. Hoover. The report shows a total of forty-two thousand one hundred and nine impressious ta.ken during the year. Dfrisiort of Topogt·aphy.-This di,Tii;ion was organize1l at the heginuing of the fiscal year aud placed iu charge of Assistant E. Hergesheimer. The special object of its organization wa8 to secure greater uniformity in inking the topographica.l sheets, by having the work doue uuder one person of judgment and experience, than is possible whet·e ea.ch sheet is inked by the topographer executing the survey. The report of the di\'ision (Appendix No. 6) shows thirteen original sheets inked and the reproduction of two sheets nearly worn out. Also the preparation for phorolitbographing of t1eveu re1luctions from topographic or hydrographic sheets. Tidal Division.-Mr. R. S. Avery has continued in cba.rge of this division.

June 30, 1882. DEAR Srn: Iu conformity with regulations, I herewith respectfully submit the usual annual rt'port. of work do11e by the several computers during the fiscal year ending .Tune ;:m, 188~. Tlte charge of the Computing Diviidon !Jas heen continue1l witb me and 110 important alteration in its management was made. The computations in connection with the l\1ississippi mver triangulations and the lines of spirit-levels still pressed hea,·ily on the available computing force, which was further weakened uy the death of Dr. Gottlieb l~umpf who ba<l been uninterruptedly connected with the Computing Division since 1849. Ile was born at Baisle, Switzerland, May 5, 1812, and joined the Computing· Division April 1, 1849, since which time he discharged his official duties most faitlifnlly and conscientiousl,v. Ou January 19 he w~s seized with a fatal illnesl'I, to which he sucf~Ulllbed February 20, 1882. In consequence of his iutimate acquaintance with the triangulation work, and his loug serdce and experience in the divii,;ion, his loss will long be felt. Mr. H. Farc1uhar was temporarily tletached and assigned to field duty from FebrnaQ· 28 to l\Jay 8, 188:.:l. Temporary assistance to the Uomputing Division was given by C. B. Turul.mll, copyist, to December 15, 1881; b.Y F. Gilman, hetween August 1 a11d October 31, 1881; b~, T. P. Borden, Aid, between Xove1uher 17 and December 12, 1881, and again between January 23 and May 1, 1882; by I. Winston, Aid, between December 3 and Deceml>er 29, 1881, and again from May 11 to the close of the ti8cal year; by D. B. ·wainwright, Suhassistant, between January 9 and February 20, and agaiu between March:.! and .June IJ, 1882; by ,J, E. McGrath, Aid, between January 20 and March s, 18.~2; by W. B. Fairfiehl, uetween .January 25 and June 6, 1882. The observations which had been made for <letcrminiug t·he length of the two fh-e·meter standards: and the length of t.he new base-uars, as mentionc·l in my last year'8 report, were computed and discussed by me before starting for California. Ju accordance witll instructions from the late guperintendent, dated July 8 7 1881, I left Washington August 19, and aRsisted in the measru·e of the Yolo base, Cal., and after atteudiug to some other matter required by the· instructions, returned to the office October rn, 1881. During my absence ~fr. E. H. Courtena~ took charge of the Computing Division. Two more sets of comparisons for the length of the new five-meter standarcl were made alJ(l compute.d. 'Vith the assistance of Mr. Suess and .Mr. Porter I determined the coefficitmt of expansion and lengtl! of a meter rod belonging to the Signal Corps serYice. 'rhe supply of the pamphlet ou the 1letermination of time, latitude, and azimuth having been exhausted I brought out a new (the third) edition, revised aml eularged, including the subject of telegraphic longitude8; the plates illustrating the same are for the greater part new. I also prepared the manuscript for a new (the third) edition of my paper on measurement of terrestrial magnetism. In this edition the stfuject-matter is differently arranged from what it was; it has also beeu enlarged. I have also colfocted, revised, and arranged, by States and Territories, aud each in chronological order, all tbe magnetic results from observations made

by the Coast awl Geodetic S1irrny hetwee11 1833 awl July, 188.!, comprising declinations, dips, and intensities at more than UOO difforeut :statiom', gi\'ing also the individual results when occupied more than once; the intensitie8 are given in British units as well as in Coast and Geodetic Survey units; descriptions of stations accompau,y the paper. Early in Mar, 1882, two obseryers were instructed in the use of the sextant and of magnetic instruments for absoluttmea.sure. In this work I had the assi8tance of Mr. Jlrf. Baker. One of tlrn observers was destined for the United States Signal Corps station at La4ly Fnmklin Bay, :~forth Greenland; the other for a similar station at Point Barrow, Alaska. The Brooke magnetographs, which had been at work for some years at Madison, Wis., were dismounted an!l brought t.o vVashington in December 1881, the Superintendent having thought it expedient to terminate the magnetic observations at that place. These instruments were altered and newly titted for difterential obseiTations to be made at the Signal Corps station at Point Barrow, and b,\" .June 14, 18K2, they had been completed and packed, and the observPr was instructed, with the aid of Assistant Eimbeck, to use them at the Alaska station in conformity and in co-operation with the International l'olar Conference. A general collection of re.-;nlts for magm·tic declinations within the r nited States and close to its borders bas been made by me, comprisiug over 2,200 stations; these results will be utilized hereafter for the constrnction of a new magnetic chart. 'l'he usual annual magnetic observations were made on t.bree days flt the magnetic observatory in thh; cit~- in .June, 18:-\2, this timr by Assistant Eimbeck. The usual office corre:,:pondence, the demawls from the EngTadug Division for information, geodetic, astronomical, and magnetic, for charts, and from the Drawing Division for geographical positions, and the H,vdrographic Division for drscriptious of geodetic stations, were all prompt!~· attended to. l~rom the following· statements, giving the work done, in detail, of e\'ery compnter during the fiscal year, it will he seen that. the general cfoitrihntion of tlw nuious classes of work was about the same as last ~·ear. Dr. Gottlieb Rnmpf comirnte1l the followi11g secondary and tertiary triaugnlations: Columbia River, sorith and east of Kalama, \V. T., 187~; In(lian River, Fla., 1880-'81; Cape May, N. J., 1881 ; reYiscd and computed geographical positions on Clarke\; spheroid of the triangulations of Columbia Ri\'er, Oreg. and \Y. T., 1852-'77, of Shoal water Bay, ,V. T., 1871-'72-'73, of the triau· gulation south of entrance of Columbia Hiver, Oregon, and of the triangulation between Fire Island and ~ew York Bay, N. Y. He also computed positions of i:;ome stations in New Jerse~·, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, a1ul Great South Bay, Long l8land, N. Y. Mr. Edward H. Courtenay attended to the insertion of the resulting geographical positions in the ollice register~ for u8e of the computers and daughtsmen; revised the magnetic constants for Rtfferal magnetometers, redsed the compntation8 for magnetic intensity determined by these 1nagnet-01neters; assisted in the prepamt.ion of the annual statistics; a<\justed the triangulation of Cape Fear Rirnr, N. U., adjusted the old antl new triangulations on Delaware River and Bay, 1840-1 41-'4~, and 1875-'7H-'81; int-<tructe<l aud supervised the WOl'k done by several of the temporary computers, aml had charge of the Computing Hivision during my absence on the \Ves tern coast. ~fr. Myrick H. Doolittle computed and atUnsted the triangulation 011 the Mississippi River from I,ake Pro\·i·lence, La., to 'Valnut Point, Miss., 1880-'81, and thence to Greenville, Miss., 1880-'81; assiswd in tbe preparation of the annual geodetic statistics and computed the supplemen~try triangulation of the District of Columbia, 1880-'81; prepared abstracts of directions of primary triangulation in New York and Vermont, 1880, and co1111ected the new and the old Lake Ohamplain triangulations; reYise<l and based on Clarke's spheroid the coast triangulation (main series} from Charleston, S. C., to the North Carolina boundary line 1853 to 1873, and from Ossabaw, Ga., s0t1thwar<l as far as Saint John's River, Fla. Dr. Jermain G.

"CNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

OFFICE OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR,

Septembet· 23, 1882. Srn: I han~ the honor to submit the following report of the Hydrograph,y under my charge for the fiscal year ending June 30, 188~: The commencement of the year found the following vessels iu the fiehl for bydrographic surveying: The steamer Blake, Commander J. K. Bartlett, U.S. N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic SurYe,r, commanding, on deep-sea sounding in the Gulf Stream; the steamer A. D. Bache, Lieutenant-Commander E. Il. Thomas, U.S. X., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, preparing for a survey of the entrance to New York Harbor; the steamer Gedney, Lieut. U. Sebree, U. S. :X., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, just concluding the hydrography off the coast of Texas and on her way to J>em;acola, Fla., where she was preparing for the winter season; the steamer Endeavor, Lieut. Henry B. Mansfield, U. S. X., Assistant, Coast and (J-eodetic 8urn·y, commanding, on the survey of the Delaware River; schooner Eagre, Lieut. H. G. 0. Colby, "L. S. :N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, on the coast of Maine; schooner Ready, Assistant H. L. l\farindin, commanding, on tl1e survey of Delaware Hiver. These vessels, working in the localities mei1tionecl as 1011g' as tlie weather would permit, or to about :Xovember 1, .1881, were in most cases-owing to the exhausted condition of the appropriations-h;y your orders withdrawn from active operations; but, in anticipation of the action of Cong-rer:;s in appropriating money in a deficiency bill for the continuation of the work, were, with pa.rtiul crews, kept ready to commence operations at short notice. During the winter season the llarty on board the steamer Bache, however, was occupied in making an inexpensive hydrograpbic survey by means of a steam-launch borrowed from the Na\·y, of the harbor of Norfolk, and in the spring a survey off the east coast of Florida; the steamer Gedney also, at the same time, surveying Pensacola Ba,;y and the liarbor of Key West, Fla.; and in making examination of reported changes near B1~aufort, S. 0., near Georgetown, S. O., and another off Cape Fear, :N. C. In addition to these two parties working during the wiuter, tlie schooner Research, in charge of Assistant F. W. Perkins; the Steadfast, in charge of Assistant 0. H. Boyd, and the Quick, in charge of Subassistant .Joseph llergesl1eimer, were fitted out about .Jannar.r 1, 1882, to complete necessary trfrtngulation for future hydrograpl1ic work on the coast of Texas, east coast of Florida, a111l west coast of :Florida respectiYely. The other vessels belonging to the senice were laid up at the places mentioned in my last annual report. The cliarge of the 1mrty on hoard the steamer Endeavor, owing to the detachment of Lieut. U. Sebree, U.S. X., from the t'Urvey by tlie :Nav;\· Department, he having completed most ably the usual term of three years, wa15 placed under Lieutenant-Commander W. II. Bronson, U. S. N., who 11ad been assigned to the Surrny by the :Navy Department in September, 1881. With this exception, the chiefs of li;ydrographic parties lrnvc remained as at the commencement of the year. On the Pacific coa"t the steamer Hassler, Ueutenant-Commander H. E. Nichols, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Surve~T' eommanding, with the party on board until December 1, 1881, was occupiedin addition to magnetic work-in making preliminar,y surveys and examinations in the waters of Alaska; while the steamer McArthur, Lieut. \Y. T. Swinburne, U. S. N., Assistant, Coast and Geocletic Sun·ey, commanding·, and the schooner Bamest, Lieut. Perry Garst, U. is. N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, cornmam1ing, were surve~·iug respectively the coast of California and Puget Souud, Oreg. These \'essels were then prepared for the continuation of the hydrography on the Pacific coast, as mentioned for those on the Atlantic coast, for which they were, with the exception of the Hassler, not required. This last vessel was, under instructions of the Superintendent, dispatehet:l to the coast of Alaska., coutiuuing a rapid survey of portions of its coast. A list of officers of the Xavy on duty in the Coast and Geodetic Survey during tlle fiscal year endiqg June 30, 1882, is appended to this report..

Repairs of vessels.-In addition to the many incidental items required in keeping Jn commission a portion, and, from rapid deterioration, the remainder laid up, of a fleet of twenty-two vessels, together with steam-launches, the steamer Blake at ProYidence was re-sheathed with copper, bilge keels re-secured after an injury iu grounding, and fitted with electric lights for the more rapid prosecution of the work for which she is equipped. A new steam-launch was purehased to replace one condenrned as unfit for use in Puget Sound. It is believed that this new boat, which by your or<lers has heen named the ·· Fuca," will he a valuable acquisition to the part~- at work 011 the topography. The steamers Bache, Gedney, Endeayor, Hassler, arnl McArthur, and schooners Eagre, Drift, Brisk, Earnest, Research, Silliman, and Quick, and sloop Steadfast baYe bad more or less extensive repairs made upon them. Hydrographic IHvision.-The usual routine duties of the office have continued. Of the large num!Jer of charts corrected during the year-uearl.)' 400-some of them, owing t;o a complete change in the system of hno~·age inaugurated b,> the Light-House Board on the coast of l\faine, have made this a duty of considerable magnitmle to the Assistant to the Hydrographic lnflpcctor. Lieut. C. T. Hutchins, tl~e incumbent at the date of last report, was detaclied by the Department in July, 1881, ::tnd his place taken by Lient. R. Clornr, G. S. ~-,who brought to the office au extensive experience in handling charts, together witll a previous three years' tour a:,; h,Ydrographer in the Coast Snney. Hi;;; zealous iutere:,;t in the :,;n~ject has it is thought famished the office with data that makes the prei;eut editions of our clmrts as nearly up to date as the coustaut changes in the buoys under the direction of the Light-Hon,se Board will permit. In this connection I de~ire to eall j·onr attention t<> the heart~- accord with which the different light-house inspectori,; tl1rough the Board haYe furthered the eudeaYori,; of thiis di\-ision to keep the office supplied with the latest information on the suhject of aids to navigation. The plotting and preparation of tlte bydrographic sheets from the data i;ent by the field parties haYe been carried on as usual in the efficient manner alreadj· known to yon, by Messrs. Eugene 'nllenbucher, \Y. C. Willenbucher, and F. C. Donn. 'fhe plotting and draJtiug of original hydrographic sheets are talmlatetl as follows:

REPORT OF THE DRA WIKG DIVISION.

Drawing Division.-Mr. W. T. Bright has, as heretofore, had charge of this division, the organization of which, together with the force of regular draughtsmen employed, remained the same as in preceding years. Appendix No. 4 shows a list of the charts and sketches which were completed or were in progress during the year, and also givtis a detailed statement of the work executed by each draughtsman for the same period. The number and names of the employee attached t.o the division, with a synopsis of the work performed by each, are as follows : Mr. A. Lindenkohl continued tl1e reduction of the additions, &e., which are macle annually t.o the small scale sailing charts, the off-shore series, and the so-;h0 sea.le coast charts. He has also

reduced to a uniform scale and combined the field-work necessary for the proper execution of the smooth drawings intended for photolithographJ-. .A number of special charts for scientific study were compiled during the year by Mr. Hndenkohl; and at intervals his attention was given to a proper arrangement of the data required to keep the progress sketches (which accompany the Annual Report of the Superintendent) up to date. l\1r. H. Lindenkohl has been engaged iu the preparation of the final drawings for those charts which it was decided to issue by the aid of the photolithographic process; various sketches and diagrams, to accompany the appendices of the annual reports, were also engraved by him on stone; and in addition he execut-0d a number of reduced drawings of topographical and hydrographical work for the difforeut scale cbarts. Mr. L. Karcher lms, ai,: usual, constructed the greater number of the projections required for the use of the topograpl1ical and b:ydrographical field parties; made l)rojects for new charts ; drawn various diagrams, and been engaged on other work of a miscellaneous character. Mr. P. Eriehsen has been eugaged principally in preparing drawings of instruments of precision to accomvauy various papers appertaiuing to tlte annual reports. Of these drawings the most important, and the oue showing the greatest detail, illustrates the construction of the new Compensation Base Apparatus. Mr. E. J, Sommer has prepared Yarious drawiugs of coast aml harbor charts; constructed projections for field use; made a number of tracings and projects, and given much time aud study to the preparation of drawings for issue by photolithography. Mr. C. Jun ken has applied himself to tbe construction of hy1lrographic drawings for the use of the Engraving Division ; to tbe preparation of prqjections for field parties, and has indicated, as occasion demanded, tlie new longitudes ou tlle eugrayed copper-plates of early date. lie was detailed from office dut.y in the latter part of June, to make a snryey of a tract of land in \Vythe County, Virginia, for the use of the united States Fish Commission. Mr. T. J. O'Sullivan was engaged, principally, in making fiue drawingis for issue by the photolithographic process, and compiling sketches t.o illustrate the annual reports. A number of projects, diagrams, and tracings were also constructed during tlle year by :\Ir. O'Sulli\'an. Mr. A. B. Graham has, during the year, given much attention to the more technic:il branches of the work of the division, and lias applied a vast number of additions and corrections, by hand, to the chart-room editions, })l'ior to their issne to the public. He has reduced and tra11sferre1l the shore-line to the new hydrographic and topographic projections for field use, and has made various tracings, &c. Messrs. J.B. Boutelle and E. L. Taney, Aids, were assigned to the dhision for duty in November, and up to the time of their departure for field sen-ice, in the month of January following, were engaged in coloring _buoys and other aids to navigation upon the printed charts. :M:r. H. Eichholtz was emnloyed in keeping up to date the latest edition of the printed charts b~· the insertion of such additional aids to navigation, changes in position, &c., of which information had been received subsequent to the latest date of issue and printing of the charts. In April he was assigned the general care of the chart rooms, owing to the illness of Mr. Thomas McDonnell, who had for many years been in charge of this important branch of the office. Since Mr. McDonnell's demise, which occurred on the 29th of May, and up to the date of this report, Mr. Eichboltz has continued to discharge the duties required in the management of the chart room. Miss F. Oadel, who wa.s assigned to the division in June, has been engaged in.ooloring light- · houses and buoys upon the printed charts, prior to their issue for public use. Appendix: No. 3 gives a statement of the information furnished by this antl other divisions, during the year, in reply to special calls.

Of the 28 completed chart plates, 10 are new cliarts, 12 new e·litiorrn, and G reissues. Iu .Appendix Xo. 5 I give a list :-;howing in detail the plates on which work Las been executed. It should be noted relati,·e to the completed plates that those indicated as "first edition" are now published for the first time from eugra\·ingH on copper. Thmw indicate·! as "edition of 1881," or 18S!!, ha.-e heretofbrt> been pubfo;hed in their present form, or when they had been sufficiently advanced to affor<l wmful iuformation, hut lta.-e now received extensi\·e additions or corrections from recent snrrn_ys. 'J'hose indicatl'd as" reissued" are old charts that han>, been thoroughly overhauled and brought up to <latP. l\fany of the "printing- plates'' that receirnd corr·mtion werp, 011 h anrl four or fiye times. 111 addition to the engra\·iug we have hail the usual amount of cleaning electrotypes, erasures from altos, drawiug and arranging titles, g·eueral lettering and noteH, markiug instruments, &c., that invariabl,y accumulates during the year. The work of correcting plates of published charts has been greatl.r augmented during the year by the new arrangement between the Hydrograpbie Inspect<>r and the Light-Ilouse Board for the verification of the Aids to Xaxigation by the irn;;pectors of the light-house districts, and by the change in the first light-house 1listrict in the Hystem of b110ying the channels; but as we now receiYe early not.ice of any ehange in the Aids to .Na\'igation, it is probable this cla8s of corrections will not involve so much W{)rk another year. Information has heen recefred correcting nearly all the principal charts to a recent date, and a large majority of them have been printed from the corrected 11Iates. But in view of the frequency of the notices received, especially relative to the shifting bl~rs of the Southern coasts, I have fourul it expedient to print as small a number of impressions at a time as will rca.imnably supply the lle1mtnd. As all corrections on file are applied to the plates before printing, it supplies the chart room with more perfect copies for distribution and greatly lessens the number of corrections that have heretofore been made by hand. The force of the di\-ision remains as at the beginning of the ;year, and has been employed as follows: Messrs. J. Enthofier, A. Sengteller, and R. :F. Bartle on topography . .Messrs. E. A. l\Iaedel, A. Petersen, J. J. Thompson, W. H. Davis, and F. Courtenay on lettering. Messrs. W. A. Thompson and H. 0. Evans on topography and sounding. Messrs. E. H. Sipe, I. vVasserliach, aud A. 0.

TIDAL DIVISION,

July 1, 1882.

DEAR SIR: I respectfully submit this report on the work of the Tidal Division, of which I

ave been in charge during the year. ObserMtfons.-Self-registering tide-gauges have been used at the following stations: North Ilaven, Me. ; P1·ovideuce, R. I. ; Sandy Hook, N . · r. ; Saneelito, Cal.; Kadiak, Alaska; and Honolulu, Sandwich Islands. The observations at Mazatlan, Mexico, were stopped on account of wharf changes being made there, but it is expected that they will be resumed soon under better conditions. A box-gauge and outfit was furnished last February to the Alaska Commercial Company, to be used by them at Copper Island, off the Asiatic coast of Bering Sea, in obtaining a set of tidal observations for comparison with those made at other points by the Coast Sun'ey. Observations are wanting on the American coast of that sea. I renew my recommendations relative to obtaining tidal observations at Bermuda, and simultaneously on the southern coast of the Unitecl States, and completing the sets on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, interrupted in 1861. These will be necessary for as complete an investigation of the Gulf tides as was intended by Professor Ba-0he when they were commenced. As full information bas been given, in the tidal notices under the different sections of the survey, of the observations made with self-registering gauges during the year, it will not be necessary to go into details here . .!.n the following table I give a list of the observations made with self·registering gauges, received during the year, and therefore not mentioned in my previous annual reports :

There are self·registering gauges now in the office, which need some repairs and new driving clocks to fit them for efficient working. The tidal observations made by the Hydrographic parties of the sur\·ey are inspected by me when received at the office, and most of them are reduced in the Tidal Division. Notices of them will be found in the accounts of work done in the different sections of the survey. Such parties generally use a plain staff divided into feet and tenths, or a box gauge with a float-rod divided in like manner. Sometimes the observations of high and low waters are kept up by them day and night, and frequent obsenations while sounding; but oftener the obsen·ations are kept up only while sounding. Thi:s of course results in less perfect work, especially where there is large diurnal inequality or siugle-da;y tides. It would he a great improvement to haYe these obserrntions made more continuous. O.tfice work.-The observers i11 clJarge of the self-registering gauges are uow generally required to make tables of the high and low waters and hourly ordinates from the curves before sending them to the office, and these tables are not sent liy the same mail as the curves. This is a safeguard against losses, tends to make the observers more skillful and careful, aud reduces considerably the work in the office. The observations receirnd from the self registering gauges and hydrographic parties are reduced as soon as they can be conveniently, and the results used in making tide tables for charts, in improving the data for predicting, and for other purposes. A great deal remains to he done, but the reductions and discussions already made have been :so extensive that the Division is able to furnish a large amount of information relating to tides to officers of the Survey, United States engineers, ci>il engineers, and others, and the demand for it is constantly increasing. "Tide tables," containing the predictions for the Atlantic and Paci tic coasts of the United. States for the year 1883, have been computed by the Tidal Division, and have been published. The compnters employed in this division in the course of the ~·ear were R S. A,-ery, L. P. Shi1ly, M. Thomas, and C. B. Turulmll in the office, and J. Downes and J. G. Spaulding out of it. Mr. Avery, being in charge of the division, inspected all tidal observation!-\ when received and prepared them for reduction, attended to the correspondence with observers and others relating to tides, planned and super,·ised the work on tides and tide-gange.s, prepared copy aml read proofs, and computed when not otherwise engaged. Mr. Shidy reduced many obsern1tio11s receked from hydrographic parties, predicted for places having large diurnal inequality, aud aided iu a cousiderable amount of miscellaneous work. Miss Thomas worked on the simpler reductions, continued the work on the hourly ordinates for permanent stations, and aided in miscellaneous work and copying. Miss Turnbull returned to the division on the 23d of January, after a year's employment in the other divisions, and since then has been mostly engaged copying and tracing on a variet~' of work, and when not thus emplo~·ed tabulated Honolulu tides. Mr. Downes, by a special contract, made the predictions for certain specified places on the Atlantic coast. Mr. Spaulding computed the predictions for Boston, as he has done hitherto, iu addition to his services as a tidal observer at North Ha.ven. Yours, respectfully, RS. AYERY,

In charge of Tidal Division.

with the "tide predicting machine," in·ented by Professor Ferrel, for which I arranged the details of construction and prepared the working drawings. I ha,·e also superintended its construction at Fauth & Co.'s, and the machine is now so far advanced that its working can be tested. The numerous difficulties encountered in the construction of this intricate piece of mechanism have been successfully overcome. During the last year I re.determined the errors of the dividing engine; this was rendered necessary by the fact that the normal temperature of 98° F. had not been kept np dnring the comparisons of the new five-meter bars in the adjoining room. The machine was further improved hy adding an automatic " cleaner" and stop; the old turbine wheel had become Yery much worn and was replaced uy a new one of my own design, which works with less water and only six pounds pressure. In order to ha>e this pressure uniform, a reservoir has been erected from which this turbine is fed. The speed is now Yery regular, and the beauty of the lines leaves nothing to be desired. The machine would be nearly perfect if a new axis were proYidcd. Of other special work done in the instrument shop, I mention the construction of the "vertical comparator," b~· Mr .·T. Clark. Re also reconstructed the four 45-inch transits hy adding large circles, latitude le\"els, new e,>epieces and diaphragms, and changing the illumination. Re also experimented in "dark field" illumination for theodolite telescopes, in order to better observe night signals. He assisted me in comparing the base bars, and for this purpose constructed an apparatus which greatly facilitatt>s the work of comparison. The demands for scales in meters aud feet necessitated the overhauling of our length dividing engine; Mr. Clark made an efficient machine out of it. Nearly all the magnetic instruments were repaired and adjusted by Mr. Clark. Mr. E. Bshleman has been kept bnsy in getting instruments ready for the field. In addition to this ltt· 1·econstrneted the ruling machines in use in the EngraYing Division, and made five rm·ersion JH'tHinlnmH, with their supports, for Assistant C. S. Peirce. Re replaced a great many brass alillade rulers by nickel-plated steel ones. l\Ir. P. Vierbnchen mounted ten geodesic night signal lamps; reconstrncted-almost entirely new-45-inch transit No. II, and made tweh-e pairs of heam com1Y1sses of different length for use in the Drawing Division and the field. The 2om chains used with plane tables were examined and adjusted by Mr. Vierbuchen. Louis Fischer assisted me a great part of the time when engaged in reading the engine circle; he made the new turbine wheel anti reconstructed the large Ripp chronograph by substituting the "conical pendulum" regulator for the Yibrating spring. The new compensation pendulum for the main office clock was made by him. Re assisted Mr. Eshleman in the construction of the reversion pendulum. S. Kearney made the ueecled brass work for tripods and telemeters. Re is now engaged in making a number of heliotropes. Respectfully submitted, G. N. SAEGlflTLLER, Chief Mechanician.

DESCRIPTION AND CON.STRUCTION OF A NEW COMPEXSATIOX PRDlARY BASE APPARATUS, INCLUDING THE IH~TERMlNATION OF THE LENGTH OF THE CORRESPO:\'DTXG flYE-METRE STANDARD BARS.
By CHARLES A. SC:lI:OTT', Aflsi,..taut.
~LARCH

10, 1883.

In the Uoast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1880, page 40, mention is made by the late Superintendent of a new base apparatus intended for immediate use in Califoruia. It was not only desirable to obtain a check or verification of the old secondary base li11e, measured thirty years ago with plain iron rods, south of San Francisco Bay, but there was an urgent necessity for the supply of' a primary base to the great triangulation now spreading along the thirty-ninth parallel from Oalifornia through Nevada to Utah. In conRequeuce of the complicated aud delicate structure of the Bache-Wiirdemann primary base apparatus hitherto used on the eastern coast, it was thought unsafe to transport it to the western coast for that purpose; besides, its great length rendered the apparatus awkward in handling, and it also required very careful grading of the ground along the line of measure. These considerations determined the Superintendent to call for a design of an apparatus which should combine the aoouracy of the old apparatus with facility of transportation, least liability to injury or derangement, ease and economy of measure, rapidity of measure, and minimum preparation of the ground. Of course cheapness of coustmctiou was also a leading consideration. Under date of Janhar.r 28, 1880, I was charged by the Superintendent with elaborating a design and submitting a report explanatory of the principles for constructing such an apparatus. This report was submitted February 9, when I was further directed to work out the plan in detail and, with the assistance of Mr. W. Suess, mecl1anicia11, prepare working drawings. This plan WflS submitted March 1, and was MCOmpanied by two large sheets of drawings. Before adopting the design it was sent t.o Assistant G. Davidson for his criticism, and his suggestions, contained in two reports and bearing on matters of detail, were carefully considered and in part adopt{'.,c}. Uespecting the important questions of the best length to be given to the measuring bars, and whether they should be compensating for temperature or plain bars, I decided for a length of five metres and for compensation. Supposing the bars well standarded, the greater their leugth the greater the accuracy of the line measured, and the greater the rapidity of measure; the maximum length, therefore, had t-0 be taken. The four-metre bars were known to be too short, but the si.Xmetre bars of the Bache-Wiirdemann primary apparatus were judged to be too long, especially when a less cumbersome apparatus had t.o be secured against deformation; five metres (or 16.4 feet) seemed to be practically the best length. Considering the large range of the diurnal variation of temperature in the region w.here the apparatus was to be used, and the greater accuracy which a compensation.bar would insure, that principle was adopted; yet it was deemed sufficient to conform to it approximately. Principal features of the new design.-Although the apparatus involves no new mMhanical principle, it is nevertheless unlike any other yet constructed. It may be briefly described in its general outlines a.s follows: The measuring bar is composed of two metals so proportioned as to be compensatiu&' for cha.urea of temperat11re, and riJridly connected without any points, levers, 01·

moyable parts; thus in fact, forming a rigid system five metres in lei1gtb. Referring to tbe annexed diagriim, the middle {or heavy) bar is of zinc, <' (.. and riveted to it at c and d are two steel bars --~========;;;;;;:;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;:;;;;,;;;;;:;:;;;--- terminating at a and b, which points remain a.. 4 at an invariable distance from each other and constitute the length of the measuring bar. The expansion or contraction of the zinc bar is exactly counteracted by the expansion or contraction of the two steel bars, provided the proper relativ.e length be given to the bars. The coefficient of expansion of zinc being nearly 2~ times that of steel, the zinc bar is the shorter one. To control the length of the apparatus with respect to any outfltauding flmall differential expansion, the zinc bar is allowed to project beyond the points c and d toward a and b, where Borda scales ate and f are applied, as indicated in the accom_ i f.. panying diagram by throe cross-lines. The readings of the scales mutually check each ~ d. other, and the part c to d of the zinc bar enters in both. There are also mercurial thermometers inserted for additional security. The length of the measuring bar is ascertained by frequent direct comparisons with a standard five-metre bar in the comparing room, as well as in the field. Two such standards were constructed, one to remain at the office at "' ashington, the other to accompany the ap1laratus into the field; th\'y consist of a steel bar five metres in length, with zinc bars of ahout half that ML length riveted t-0 it at m and n of the diagram, one on each side, so as to form two Borda scales, as indicated by the three cross-lines. This disposition of the bars was adopted to secure correctness of indication of length of steel bar under any unequal exposure to heat or cold with respect to the two sides of thi; bar. Mercurial thermometers were also provided. The "Mudge" contact slide, so effective in our secondary apparatus, was also adopted for the present apparatus in the place of the complex spirit-level contact of the six-metre bars. That feature of the B.-W. apparatus which secures during measure, by mechanical compensation, an invariable distance between the rear trestle support and the rear end of the bar, is retained in the new apparatus in a somewhat different way, as shown by diagram, where the distance c b is invari· _ _ _ _ _ _ __:.._ _2......!~~=~~~~;,t'l.I -& able by the action of the zinc bar z z in a direc- ci:. ~("2 : : : : ....: tion contrary to that of the two irou bars, viz, that terminating at h, and but little longer than fi ~ ·~~ ~ the zinc bar, and the other, that part of the T-shaped iron rail a a' which is contained between c and a'. This rail actually forms the support of the measuring bar, and carries the rollers upon which the latter resti:;. It. is important to notice that the end b forms the abutting surface for the action of the 1:1crew head, by the turning of which the rigid-bar system can be moved on its rollers longitudinally, and by means of which conta,et is made. The diagram shows this compensation in a vertical plane merely for greater distinctness; actually, the arrangement is in a horizontal plane, and there are two zinc and two steel bars, as will be more fully explained hereafter. The trestles are of wood, modeled after those of the secondary apparatus, but lower and very much heavier and stronger, with the following additions or changes: A prism on the rear trestle which fits into any one of a series of notches on the under side of the measuring' bar (at c of the preceding diagram) ; this prism can turn about a vertical axis passing through the middle of its ength and thus admits of a slight azimuth motion; attached to the top of each trestle is a horizontal screw (added in California), by means of which the bar when resting on the trestles can be aligned rapidly. During measure each leg of the tre.stles rests on an iron foot-plate, triangular in shape, with a prong at e..ach angle to hold it firmly on the ground. The aligning telescope is the sawe as used with the secondary apparatus, but it is mounted and adjusted differently, the place assigned to it being at the forward end of each bar. A sector for measuring the inclination of the bar is provided as usual. It is intended that the apparatus shall be protected from the rays of the snn during measure, and it is supposed that the temperature will then rarely much exceed the limit'B of 0° and 40° C. For transferring the end of a bar to the ground, a theodolite \so-called seet.ot') is

provided; it is mounted a few metres off the line of the base aud approximately at right angles thereto and opposite the end to be sighted; a finel,y divided ivory scale is placed Jernl and over the line mark on the ground, and read off by means of the telescope which is adjusted to move in a vertical plane. In height the telescope is midway between the ground and the base bar, thus requiring no attention in the focal length. Respecting the employment of zinc in the construction of the apparatus I felt no hesitation, considering that it was successfully employed by Bessel in his apparatus as his temperature indicator, yet to some extent I conceive it to be an experiment, for want of complete knowledge of the behavior of this metal under variations of temperature; daily comparisons with the standard bar during the measurement of a base were therefore deemed essential and a portable comparator or a fixed one of easy access had to be provided. In consequence of the condition of the Survey at the time not admitting of any additional expenditures, nothing further could be done during the fall of 1880 than to select a suitable comparing room in the basement of the office and to erect therein several brick piers to serve for the comparisons needed in the construction of the five-metre standards. It was, however, difficult to control the temperature of this room, and the space was very much confined and barely sufficient, yet nothing better could be had. Several weeks were lost during the winter in the attempt to obtain suitable steel and zinc bars, and it was not until the mid<lle of February, 1881, that they were procured; from that time the work proceeded rapidly, and the apparatus was completed June 25, 1881, and inspected on that day by the late Superintendent. It was then ordered to be sent immediately to California. It is to be regretted that there was no time to test the performance of the apparatus here, and in consequence, some minor imperfections were noticed during the field work. The construction of the apparatus was entrusted to me at a period when the discharge of my ordinary official dutie.s required almost the whole of my time, and I found myself so seriously embarrassed in consequence, that in the spring I had to request the aid of Sub-Assistant Blair to supervise the mechanical execution of the apparatus, the work not being done at the office, but scattered among various mechanics. I have also t-0 acknowledge the effective help of Mr. W. Suess, for general assistance aud especially for work required in the comparing room, such as the construction of the movable platform, the adjustment of the bars and comparators, and the observa. tions themselves. All computations in connection with the comparisons of length and determinatiou of coefficients of expansion were made by myself and checked by Mr. J. G. Porter of the Computing Division, who also made the computations of the additional work of li'83, which was checked by another computer. Description of some details of tke base apparatus.-In order to avoid the necessity of a tedious description two plates of illustratiOns have been prepared, see Plates Nos. 26 and 2i. These plates contain detail drawings of the apparatus as a whole and of all such parts as appear to require further elucidation; the figures are draw.n to scale, hence auy desired dimensions may readily be measured off, besides a title or description sufficient to make further remarks unnecessar~· accompanies each figure, and it is believed that these, taken in connection with the above exposition of the principles of the construction, will render it practicable to obtain a complete knowledge of the apparatus. Tke standard bars.-The office and field standards are of precisely the same construction. These steel bars are of rectangular section 5mm thick by 21.5mm high; the attached zinc bars are 6mm l>y 25mm and 249cm in length. The united bars rest on sixteen equidistant rollers placed on the t-0p of an iron T -rail. At each end of the steel bar and projecting beyond the wooden case are steel plugs 2.5mm in diameter and lmm long, the end surfaces of which define the length of the standard. Sunk in the box and read through glass windows are two mercurial thermometers. The two Bol'da scales on each standard a.re 20mm in length, divided into quarter millimetres with vernier; their least reading is O.Olmm, corresponding to an expansion of abou ° C. Tke base bars.-The two ha.rs are of the same construction. The cross·section of the steel is 5.5mm thick and 23mm high, and that of the zinc bars 6.2mm by 25mm. Lets= length of each of the two steel bars and z that of the zinc bar between them, and considering that there is a.bout 0.16 of brass forming the oonta.ct pieces at eaeh end, we have the expression 2 8 + .16- Z= 5 ~a 8 + .16 y - /i z = 0

In consequence of the im1nacticability of obtain} o { ing a bar of zinc of this length, two pieces had ----------------~--------' to be joined; they are scarfed, spliced and riveted as shown by the diagram. The e:ftectiYe length for differential expansion is, for base bar No. I, 3.802m, and for llase liar No. 2, 3.808m. In order that the compountl measuring bar should at all times retain its length whether the temperature be rising or fa1ling, it was desirable that the cross-sections of the steel and zinc bars should be in>ersely proportional to the speciiic heat of these metals; also that the thickness of the bar should take into account the difference in the conductivity of heat, and that the bars should haYe equal surface exposure so that radiation (or absorption) might be the same. These conditions can only be approximately satisfied; llesides the dimensions desired differ from the actual ones in consequence of the inability to have the manufacturer conform to a given exact form. These remarks apply to the standard bars as well. The length of the measuring bar is defined by steel plugs, that at the rear end being ground into a horizontal knife-edge, while that at the forward end is flat aucl perpendicular to the length of the bar. ~o attempt was made to compensate the bar for increased exparn;ion at high temperatures. The Mudge contact slide has added to it a collar or ring, by the turning of which contact can be made and the sliding piece kept in position ; this contriYauce was necessary in order that· the sliding piece may not press against the comparator during comparisous for length, the Bessel-Repsold as well as the Fauth comparator being }eyer and spirit-le\·el comparators. In the pla1·e of the usual single line there are tliree equidistant lines for coincidence, one set ruled slightly closer as sugge8ted by Assistant Davidson; contact is made with the aid of a magnifying glass. In consequence of dust pcuetratiug into the slicle it was necessary to cut it through, so that it could be removed for cleaning without disturbing the small index piece. TLe strength of the interior contact spring is a pressur.e of but a small fraction of an ounce. The aligning telescope is copieu from the secondary apparatus, for which see Appendix No. 17, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1880, hut the mounting and means of adjustment are different"; the whole slides on an arc coll· centric with the axis of the oar, and is set vertical by means of a small spirit level; in this position it can be clamped. It was originally adjusted lJy hand in azimuth and kept in alignment by a clamp, but Sub-Assistant Pratt suggested the a<ldition of an abutting stud with two adjusting screws working against it, as shown on the accompanying diagram.

He also independently suggested the use of a suspended piu at the rear end of the measuring bar, as had been thought of by me for adjusting the telescope in direction, but the latter operation was easily effected by means of sighting on a plumb-line suspended over the middle of the knife-edge. The hook as suggested is shown by accompanying cut. The compensation arrangement at the rear end of the bars, in consequence of which the abutting surface of the contact screw, which moves the whole measuring bar, remains at an invariable distance from the position of the rear trestle at the time, is effected by zinc bars 0.50m in lengtb. =2.887 metres apart, and equidistant from the 3 ends. The number of grooves under the rear end of the bar was about two· to the centimetre, cut afterwards so as to have four per centimetre; and there might, with advantage, be five grooves per centimetre. In general plan the trestles do not differ from thoi;e used with the secondary apparatus, but they are very much stouter and hea\·ier awl have the following additions: A hori· zontal knife-edge or prism, which can turn about a vertical axis so as to accommodate any one of the above grooves in case the.trestle should be somewhat turned with respect to the direction of the line. By letting the bar down on any selected groove the distance between the front bar and the rear bar could be so regulated that hut a small motion in the direction of its length is required to effect the contact. The roller on the front trestle is of metal iustead of wood, in consequence of the larger weight it has to bear. To facilitate adjustment of the bar in direction, the pulling or pushing of it iuto line being found too clumsy and time-consuming, Assistant Gill>ert fitted an endless screw to each trei;tle, the thread1; working against a pin or pro,iection underneath the bar; by these means, which were applied dnring the measure of the Yolo bas!:', the alignment of' the bar could be made with great case aud precision. In heigt1t the bar is regulated by the usual wedges of the secondary apparatus; the legs of the trestks are shorter than usual, and the split parts are connected in the middle by a cross-bar. The remaining pages contain au account in detail of the method adopted for the determination of the length of the two five-metre standards and of the results reached; also a direct comparison of these standards with a four and a ~ix-metre standard, as heretofore used on the survey.

Tiley are of steel, end measure;; with steel plugs, and ha\'e attached two zinc bars with Borda 8.-ales in the middle, as described iu the a-0c01mt of the construction of the new five-metr1> base apparatus.

The steel ua1·s were made nlwut twelve years ago, and were takeu from a umuher of similar bars which served for the coustruction of the steel staudard State-metres. They aw rectangular in sectiou, Icm in width aud 3cm in height, nearl.1 that of tht· Committee metre which is 9mm b~· ~8nnu; originally they had at oue end a rectangular perforatiou 4mm. b~· Hmm. This was filled up with lead. At the end snrfnct·s t.lrnre are projecting c~·Unders lcm long and lmu in diameter. aud 1'lightly pn~jectillg beyond t11c t>nd;.; of thest> c~·liudcrs, and concentric therewith, are the deti11ing· platinum-iridium surfaces, ~mm iu dianwter and im~ject ing about 0.5mm be~·oud the cylinder. Tht> alloy proved rather soft and would wear nrnler rough or constant use. The platinum-iridium cylindf\rs \l'Pt'1· inserted lis .J. J. Clark, wlio gwnnd and polislwtl them at rig·ht an~le;; to the axes of the bars, and st:1udarded tltem as near a,.; priwticahlP to the length of one metre; wheu 11ot ill use the ends are protected hr br:tl'ls eaps aml the liars art'. JH'P~en·ed in woodeu bo.x.e::;. l·'or the determiuatiou of their lt>ugtli thes wert\ placed side by side in a trougl1 tilled with g·Jyeerine, and compared betweeu the middle brick pierR ill the comparing-room b~· means of the HeKl'lelUepsold 1:1crew-level comparators, and at the natural temperature of the room. Tlie tluid wa" poured iu the trough t.Le e\·euiug before observations eommeuced, and after the close of each 1l:J,~·'s work the metres were newly arranged in relatirn position. There are two thermometers in the tank, suspended horizontally and on a le,·d with tlte axf's of the metres and on eacl1 side of tl1e hox. To read them withont taking oft' the lid there arc two 1.dass windows vertically O\'t·r the scalps; the therruometcw;; are faste11ell t-0 iron bars of the same section as the mt'treR; the11e ha rs can he raised by means of wires, in orde1· to bring the stems of the thermometers to or above the surface of the glycerine for the purpose of reading the scales. The readings are takeu Ly the light of a hull's eye lantern; a small plane mirror fastened on the outside o\·er the lens and inclined to the horizon about 450 throws the light vertically downward. Before reading the thermometers the glycerine is agitated and made to circulate freel,y between, below, and above the mettir bars. The five subsidiary metres, the Committee metre, itnd the two Lars supporting the thermometers, are placed horizontal and paralle1, and tbe metres are supported independently on rollers at 0.2llm from their ends towards the southern pier and on a cross-bar 0.2llm from their ends towards the northern pier. Expansion aud contraction of the b1irs will thus be measured mainly by the southern comparator. The trough is water tight, uncl tl1e packing of the small c,rlindrfo ends of the bars projecting through the ends of the box is effected by a sheet of India rubber which is secured by a perforated brass plate. The trough rests on a carriage, which can readily be wheeled in on iron rails and brought to rest between the comparators for the successi,-e measure of each metre. The tank is provided with a hot or cold supply pipe, emptying at the bottom of the trough, and with a waste or overflow pipe at the top; these pipes are of gutta-per,:ha, and lead outside the comparing room, and are used in -0bservations for determining the ooefficient of e::i..-pansion. It is desirable to describe once for all the process· of mounting and the adjustment of the oompara.tors on any of the piers. A tine copper wire is stretched over the middle of the two piers and at right angles to the direction of the rails supporting the carriage with the bars. The comparators are placed on the piers, roughly, with their screws level and in the vertical plane of the wire, a.nd at the proper height with respect to the end surfaces of the metre bars. The rails and bars are Placed horizont.al by spirit level; the brass bed plates of the oompmators are leveled by means of four foot screws, and adjosted in heig'ht by 1neans of a leveling instrument, so that the points of

118

the contact pieces shall be precisely in a horizontal plane with the axis of the bar under comparison The comparators are made to read about the middle of their scales for average measure. Finally, after the screws of the comparators, the axes of their abutting pieces, and the centers of the small disks of the ends of the bar or bars under comparisou, were all found in tke same stra.ight and hori· zontal line, the comparators were fastened down to the piers by means of plaster of Paris. No.1 waR always mounted on the northern, No. 2 on the southern pier, and increasing readings of screw11 corresponcl to decreasing distance between the central surfaces. To obtain a measure of the stability of the piers, au additional metre was mounted on a wooden frame, supported at one·fonrth of its length from the ends, and wrapped up in a woolen cloth and paper coYer to protect it from sudden changes of temperature; it waK alwa,vs kept at the tempera· taro of the room, and its thermometer scale could be read b,y opening a tlap in the cover. For thiR purpose steel metre No. 19 was used, the same which serve for stamlardin~ tht> State metreR; it is of. the same section as the subsidiary metres and its length is given

ARRANGEMENT OF THE METRES IN THE GLYOERINE TROUGH.

The accompanying diagram shows the arrangement of the metres in their first position. M. is the Committee-metre and I I the iron bars to which the thermometers are attached; pp indicates the sides of the paper cage inside of which the comparisons were made. In position II the Committee-metre was inverted; in position III all the metres were in~erted ; and in position IV all the metres except M were inverted. Each position is used once with contact piece I, as in diagram; next the contact pieces of the comparators are exchanged. We thus obtain eight distinct result& Each set oonaiats of the following operations: Rea.ding of thermometers of metre No.19; reading of pier thermometers; three compa.ra.t.or contacts taken in rapid succession; reading

For heating the glycerine a boiler was provided in the yartl adjoining the comparing room, and for cooling the same a large tub was kept filled with ice; in this were placed tin vessels filled with glycerine and the whole was covered with iiieces of i<>..e. It was found that the flow of glycerine through the tubing leading to the comparing trough was too slow; it was therefore brought into the room in buckets and poured in the trough. The lowest temperature which could steadily be maintained during the time of making a set of comparisons was near 4JO F., and the highest to which it was desirable to expose tl1e bars was near 1000 F. Special experiment was made December 18, 1880, to test the rapidity with which the steel bars immersed in g·Iycerine would take up its temperature when markedly different from that of the room. It was found that with a sudden change of temperature of 220 F., the time elapsed before the micrometer readings became steady was twenty-two minutes; it was therefore concluded that observations conld commence ha.If an hour after the change of temperature had been made, by which time the axes of the bars had fully ta.ken up the temperature of the fluid. The method of observing was the same as explained before. The distance of the micrometers (or piers) was measured before and after each set of observations for coefficient of expansion by means of M 19; this metre-bar indicated the temperature of the room, and it was necessary in the first instance to assume a close value for it.s coefficient of expansion, in order to express the distance between the comparators. The coefficient usually taken before the present observations for M, was the vaJue e=.00000642; from previous observations L1e of Mand M 19 was fonnd-.00000021, hence

in the first computation e of )119 was assumed .00000621. The observers were H. W. Blair and W. Suess; the observations commenced December 23, 1880, and were concluded Januar_y 8, 1881, during which time fifteen sets of comparisons were made, each consisting of tiYe difforent mean temperatures and yielding each au independent Yalue of e.

The distance between the comparators or rather between the piers is plainly ·ariable and a function of the temperature. The values d being directly used in the computation for the various rnlues of e, the latter are independent of auy change in tlie distance d. During these obsenatiorns extraordiuarily severe cold weather set in. On flle morning (before da.Ybreak) of December ill, 18HO, the thermometer exposed to the night air indicated _140 F., tbe lowest temperature cYer recorded at ·washington (since Jauuar.r, 1820). The minimum thermometer in the comparing room showed 40° F.; the distance between the piers was shortened thereby nearly 100 microns. This same distance between the comparators is also measured by the contact observations of each of the six metre bars, the latter being at various temperatures, and the differences of distanee compared with the difference of temperatures gives the measure for expansiou coefficient e; thi1-1 for metre bar A we have, after putting the measured micrometer distance =D, the following table of results:

These bars are also designated Office standard and :Field standard, respectively; they are of soft steel, and terminate in small bard steel cyli!Hlers of the same size as those of the steel metres (diameter 21 millimetres, projection 1 millimetre). Permanently attached to them, at their ends, are two zinc bars, each of half the length of the steel bars, one on each side, with two Borda scales at the middle of each 8tandard bar. These staudardR were mounted in a water-tight wooden box, painted with a8phultum, aml further 8ecurell against the leakage of hot glycerine by a layer o plaster of Paris. The bars rested on 16 equidistant rollers, and the zinc bars on 8 independen rollers fitting over the same axes as those for the steel bars. The ends protrude through smal holes in a thiu brass plate, am! are secured by rubber diaphragms. Fotu thermometers were placed between the bars, immersed in glycerine to the depth of the axes of the bars, and, beginning with that near the north e111l, their Hall nnmberR were 966, 970, 968, arnl !:171. The thermometers and Borda scales were reail through glmi:,; windows in the lid of the box. \\rheu on the movable platform the box was smTonnded by a thick layer of sawdust, in order to secure, as near as may be, a constant temperature of tlw glycerine during comparisons. The fluid was allowed slowly to run out through two orifice~ at opposite cud8 of the box, thu8 8eeuriug a slow hut constant circulation of the glycerine. Iu all cases an interval of uot less than :!O minutes was allowed to elapse after the temperaturt> of the g-lycerine had become stead~· before commencing comparisons. Mounted on the same movable platform was a secoud woode11 box containing the fh·e metrel'4, A, B, C, D, E, joined so as to form a length of :i millimetreR. The space between the boxes was filled with sawdust. Un ring the work tlle system of the joiued metres exposed to air only, was kept iu a closed space, the temperature of which was ascertained by rneaus of thermometers 479, 481, and 484, OH the side towards the wall, aud 480, 482, and 483 on the side towards the entrance; in both cases in the order from north end to south end. 'fhese instruments were read through glass windows iu the lid. These 6 thermometers were received at the office in December, 1880; they were graduated by J. Green, of New York, in April, 1878, and had been filled six: months. Careful comparisons were made by H. W. Blair of these instruments with Casella thermometers Nos. 18411 and 35792 (restandarded at the Johns Hopkins University, as mentioned above), and with Casella thermome_ ters Nos. 21467 (the certificate of which was lost) and 35790, which two instruments bad been sent to the Yale College Observatory for restandarding; for these Mr. L.

Each of the five joined metres rests on two rollers, at one-fourth of its length from the ends, and these are adjustable in height. Contact of the metre bars is assured by two spiral brass springs attached by clamps, one on each side, and on a leYel with the axes, to any two adjacent bars, as shown in the figure.

(The spiral springs were afterwards replaced by India-rubber bands.) The tension of the springs was regulated to be just sufficient to hold the system of hars together, without breaking contact when a gentle pull was applied to one of the end metres. The pivots of the end metres protrude through the closed ends of the box, and the whole system is carefully adjusted so that the axes of the comparators and of the five metres pull in the same horizontal right line. By means of the reflecting light of a candle held at one end, the eye at the opposite end could very nccurately judge of the straightness of the polished upper surfaces. The ad,justment between the comparators (No. I at the north and No. Il at the south pier) of the system ::8 and Standards I and II being satisfactorily made, thirty-five sets of comparisons were secured between March 17 and March 26, 1881, ;yielding seven independent results for the coefficient of expansion of each of the standards. These obsen·ations were made by H. W. Blair and W. Suess. Each set consists of reading of all thermometers and Borda scales making contact with ::E, I, and II, and again with II, I, and ::E, and reading of all scales. To effect the reading of the Borda scales two plates of glass were laid OYer them, with the upper surface of the plates just above the le'vel of the glycerine. A hand magnifying glass was used in reading off, the proper lenses not being ready. The method of computation being the same as for the single metres, the results are given in a condensed form as follows:

For this purpose the isix bars which had previously been supplied for temporary use with steel abutting plugs, were placed side by side and parallel to oue another, in the same box or trough in which the two standards had rested duriug similar work. The bars were supported on eight rollers and were immersed in glycerine, the temperature of which was ascertai1rnd by six thermometers, viz: Nos. 966, s, 970 ou the east side, and No8. 968, 91 971 on the west side of the bars. The absolute distance between thl' comparators was obtained by the combined five metres of the s~·stem ::E, which alwa,ys remained at tlle natural temperature of the room. After the glycerine was either heated or cooled, the comparisons did not c·,ommence until the glyeeriue had remained for half an hour at a statfonary temperature. The bars were arranged in the order S1 Z11 Sm for Base Bar I, and S 1v Zv Sn for Base Bar II, tlte first system of bars being_ nearest to the wall. The observations were made by Messrs.

g-First determination of the length of the five-metre Standard Bars I and II.
Before commencing the comparisons each standard was deposited in its own box for permanent keeping. The five joined metres or the !'\\'Stem :E was directl_y compared with the standards; the three tight boxes containing the respective bars. being mounted on the movable platform, and each carefully adjusted. Their order wm;, beginning with that nearest to the east wall 2', I, IL All comparisons were made in air, the natural tempprature of the comparing room was as little interfered with as pos8ible; with ::E there were six thermometers (479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484); with I, there were three (96G, 8, 968); and with II, there were three thermometers (970, 9, 971) all horizontal or nearly so, and read through glass windows in the lids of the boxes. It was aimed at to secure one-half of all observations with rising, and the other half with falling temperature. The firn single metres were variously combined hy the following arrangement: No two faces of metres and comparators came iu contact more than once; NICh face came in contact with eight others, and the faces were prese11ted in different positions, i. e., with respect to up and down. If we number the faces of the metres from north to south, begi11niug with A at Comparator I and ending with 2 at Comparator II in their order of position with I, 2, 3, etc., so that for instance 7-8 refers to the ends of metre D, the following arrangements were made:

We note for fntnre comparison mean reading of Borda scales of Standard I or n. (A+Il)= 1a.466, and of Standard II or rr (U+D)=7d.516, corresponding to 68°.75 and 680.90 F. of temperature as indicated by the mercurial thermometers; these readings correspond also to the respective length of I and II as given above. Increasing scale readings signify increasing length of bars.

h-Determination of the corrections to the thermometers permanently attached to the standard bars and to the base bars.
One dozen centigrade mercurial thermometers were ordered from J. Green, of New York, and received in April, 1881. They are divided to half degrees; the divisions etched on the glass tube; they range from about -200 U. to +50° C. They were tilled in 1878 and graduated six months after filling. The comparisons were made in water by Mr. Blair, and the results depend on the four Casella staudardH Nos. 18411 and 35792 in vertical position, and Nos. 21467 and 35790 in horizontal position, all others iu horizontal positiou. The new Green tlieruwmeters are numbered 4516, 4517, 4518, 4519, 4520, 4522; these with the four standards were first compared May 5 and 6; the other six Green thermometers are numbered 4528, 4524, 4525, 4526, 4527, 4528, were next compared May 9 9nd 10 with the same standard, and in addition 451!) of the first set was again used but in vertical position; of these thermometers 4516 and 4517 were attached to Standard I, 4518 and 4520 to Standard II, 4522 and 4523 to Base Bar I, and 4524 and 4525 to Base Bar II; the corrections are as follows:

i-Second determination of the length of jive-metre Standard .No. I. First series.-These observations were made between February 13 and March 18, 1882, by W. Suess and E. B. Lefavour; there wne the same sixteen difforent arrangementi; of the single metres A to E as in April and May, 1881, but after half of them had been made the system ~and Standard I were exchanged in position, the latter being now east of ~, also Standard I was turned end for end. Thermometers 479 to 484 were in the box of s.vstem 2: as before, 479, 481, 484 being on the east side of the metres. Thermometers 4516 and 4517 were with Standard No. I. The bars were brought between the comparators in the order No. I, 2·, 2', No. I, and after eight. sets were completed, in the order~' No. 1, No. 1, 2·.

returned .from Ca-lifornia November 1, 1882.

Before makiug these observations the lower ventilator of the comparing room was more effect· ively closed, the narrow spaces between the floor and the seveml piers were covered with pieces of ca.rpet, and the whole of the north wall of the room was bung with blankets. During the measure of the Yolo base the five-metre Field standard was wrapped in felt; hence the Office standard was likewise covered with blanketing and canvas. The comparisons were made ea.eh

At the close of the eighth day of observations both bars were turned end for e11d; positiou I, Office standard, back, thermometer 4516 north; Field standard, front, thermometer 4320 north. After exchange the comparisons were continued eight days more, with the usual renrsals. Observers, Messrs. Chapman and Porter.

k-Recomparis01i of Nos. I and II with the five metres A, B, C, D, E joined.
In this series of comparisons each standard was treated independently, and after each set of comparisous the i:;taudard and the joined system A to D, or ;s, were exchanged in position, as in the preceding work. It was noticed that the variations made in the position of the single metres had but little influence upon the resulting length; the metres forming ;s were therefore placed in position 5, which they occupied April 27, 1881, and which corresponded most nearly with the average length from all the combinations made. This combination is: Comparator I to the left, B, :E, C, A, D; Comparator 11 to the right. After four days of comparisons, made at the hours 9, 12, au<l 3 of Standard I with ;s, Standard II was substituted for the former, and four days of comparii:;ous were made. System ~· was then turne!l end for end, and its metres E and A were innrted.· Standard II was likewit1e turued encl for end and four days of compari80DS made; II was then removed, aud I put in its place, turned end for end, and compared four days, thus completing eighL days for each bar.

DETERMINATION OF LENGTH OF THE FOUR·METRE 8TANDARD, IRON ROD NO.

BY MEANS OF

THE FIVE-METRE OFFICE STANDARD AND A SINGLE METRE.

Ju connection with the standarding of the new five-metre hars I 1n·opose to make a new and entirely irnlepemle11t determiuation of the length of the old iron four-metre standard, which has been used for many p~ars, and is :-;till so used for the staudardiug of our four-metre base apparatus. This was also desirablP in order to secure perfect accord in the triangulations depending on different base lines and forms of apparatus. (For the same reaRon some comparisons with the six.metre standard were made.) Rod No. 1 ancl steel metre .E were abutted together and adjusted level and in a straight line with the axes of the comparator1:1. Metre bar E was in a box by itself, a,nd its ends protruded through paper screens forming the ends of the hox. It was supported on two rollers, as in preceding work. 'l'wo thermometcrn~ J. Green, 479 and 480, were put in the box and read through glass-eon~red windows in top of it. The tliermorneters were horizontal, and their corrections have already been given. Contact between E and the four-metre rod was secured by two spiral springs just pressiug hard enough to securn surface contact. The four-metre rod was in its own box, and its temperature was determined b,v the thermometer accompanying it. Special comparisons made by Mr. Blair, May 18-19, 1881, with stanclards 18411 and 35790, used heretofore, gave the following corrections: At 3io F.-00.23; at 740 F.-00.10 50 -0 .26; 86 -0 .10 62 -o .16; loo -o .ta

Pamllel to this system, and on the same platform, was mounted five-meter standard No.1, sup· plied with thermometers 966.8 and 968, used heretofore; it was adjusted as usual. The observations for difference of leugth were made hy H. W. Blair and J.B. Weir on May 4 and on June 21 1881, with E. B. Lefavour in place of Mr. Weir. The latter observations were made at night, and thermometers 4516 and 4517 were then used with standard No.1. The order of comparisons

Porter observers, 12 sets; and August 9, 11, and 12, D. C. Chapman and J. G. Porter observers, 12 sets. The single ruetre B was used in the place of E.

DETERMINATION OF LENGTH OF THE SIX-METRE OFFICE STA.ND.A.RD BY ME.A.NS OF THE FIVE· METRE OFFICE ST.A.ND.A.RD AND A SINGLE METRE.

Four sets of comparisons were made of the six-metre standard No. l with the five-metre standard No. 1 +metre B. The circumstances under which these observations were made were unfavorable, in consequence of the confined space, which required the bars to be placed diagonally in the comparing room. This produced a difference of temperature near the two ends of the bars, one end, in the northeast corner, being exposed fo the effect of the outer tem1)erature., the other end, in the southwest corner, being exposed to the interior temperature of the building. Nevertheless, the mean result for length agreed well with former determinations, although the coefficient of expansion which may incidentally be derived comes out smaller than found by direct observa· tions in 1860. The results reached in 1882 are as follows:

REPORT OF THE MEASUREMENT OF THE YOLO BASE, YOLO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.
By GEORGE DAVIDSON, Assistant.

The llevelopment of the ''Davidson quadrilaterals'' looked to obtaining a base-line in that part of the Sacramento Valley lying immediately east of the Vaca or Berryessa .Mountains; and after the selection of the stations "Vaca Mountain'' and ".Monticello" an examination was made for the location. Vaca Mountain station commands the whole flat country to the east of it, but Monticello does not overlook the whole of these plains on account of a peak of nearly the same ele>ation sianding a short distance to the southeast of the station. The streams and sloughs running eastward from the Berryessa Mountains, which form the western boundary of the Sacramento Valley, are usually short and not very large. But in the rainy season they carry large volume8 of water, with swift currents, and are subject to overflows. These OYer11ows have gradually raised their banks from some distance on either side, so that the stream may be said to run on it ridge. C::whe Creek (Rio .Jesus Maria), having the great equalizing reservoir of Clear La.ke as its source, does not present this last feature in a marked degree, but Putah Creek (Rio de las Putas), Anderson, Dry, and Willow Sloughs do. The sloug-hs which are dry and grassy in summer and fall are bank-full in winter, and emu overflow. The banks of Dry Slough are very markedly higher than the adjacent land. These stream ridges lie nearly east and west, and therefore cross the line of any base chosen parallel to the Berryessa Mountains. Under instructions of the Superintendent, I commenced the examination of the plains of Yolo County between Cache and Putah Creeks for a suitable base-line, in April, 187G, having with me Assistants Rockwell and Eimbeck. After familiarizing myself with the country for a few days, and locating special objects, I easily located a 6-mile base-line lying east and west midway between Cache and Putah Creeks, and then obtained a proper quadrilateral, with its longest diagonal paralle1 to the line Vaca ~fountain-Monticello. Further examination proved that not only this longer diagonal of the quadrilateral was avail. able for a base-line, but also that another of the sides of the quadrilateral could be had. Upon representing the facts to the Superintendent, and showing that the long line would obviate the occupation of two extra statious on the plains, which would be required if either short base was adopted, he accepted the long base by telegraph. Fortunately, there is a ridge of 35 feet elevation lying on the south side of Uache Creek bottom. This gave favorable elevation to the north end. At the southern end of the base on Putah Creek the land is low, and, fortunately, llfontioello comes out f'.rom behind an outlying peak. Half a mile northward of the Putah the station Monticello is invisible. Within eight days the whole question had been settled. Assistant Eimbeck was then detailed to erect signals at Vaca Mountain and Monticello stations, both somewhat difficult of access. Assistant Rockwell was detailed to make a plane table survey with telemeter from Northwest to Southeast base station, so as t:o determine the relative positions of houses, fences, improvements,

sloughs, etc. In this work he made the length of the base 17 5731 metres by telemeter rod. The wheat was then 4 foet lligh and the measurements not easily made. ·when this was about finished I received instructfons to occupy stations Mount Diablo and Mount Helena on the scheme of work to extend eastward, and north and south, and to connect with the primary work along the coast. In 1878 I was ordered to Europe to examine the instruments of precision at the Paris Exhibition. Iu 1879 I occupied the stations Mount Lola and Round Top, in the Sierra Nevada. In 1880 I occupied the stations S1.mtheast Yolo base, Northwest Yolo base, Monticello, and Vaca Mountain. In .June of that year I instructed Sub-Assistant Dickins to make a new topographical survey of the line of the base to ascertain what improvements bad been made upon it. His length differed 10 metres from .Mr. Ifockwell's. Eotb lengths were obtained by telemeter. I studied tlie wearing of the banks of the Putah Creek, which had been cutting the left bank badly to the east of tLe 8outheast base, and the right bank badly above the Southeast base. For various reasons I moved the Southeast base station about 300 yards weRtward of the provisional station of 1876. The location of tht> Northwest base was not changed, The line appears to avoid all the probable improvements for some years at least, but as it passes through a very ricl1 tract of wheM country, it muRt eventually be occupied. As the high ridge of \:Yillow Slough lies directly across the line, I decided to build a brick shaft 30 to 3,-, feet above the ground at Southeast base, and one of 15 feet elevation at Northwest base. These pieri; arr elsewhere 1leRcribed. The Southeast base station is about 25 metres from the left bank of the Putah Creek, and the ground is 23 feet above low water therein. There is a slight l{~rne between the bank and the station, with a post and board fence thereon.
GENERAL LOCATION OF THE YOLO BASE-LINE.

The line is in Yolo County, in the Sacramento Valley, and nearly midway between the Sacrament.a Uiver and the Vaca or Berryessa .Mountains. (See sketch No. 28.) It lies nearly parallel with the Ualifornia. Pacific Hailroad, joining the towns of Davisville and Woorlland (county seat), and between 3 aml 4 miles west therefrom. Its general direction is N. m0 53' W., and S. mo 53 1 E. The south end lies in the northwest quarter of sectiou 19, township 8 north, range 2 east, Diablo meridian, being 3-k miles west and 1-k miles south of Davisville. It is reached by taking the county road west from DavisYille and turning southward on the unopened road which is a south continuation of the Plainfield road. The land is owned by W. H. Soule, post-office Davisville, Yolo County, California. The north end lies in the extreme southeast corner of the southeast quarter of section 28, township 10 north, range 1 east, Diablo meridian, being 4! miles west of the railroad passing through Woodland, a.ml immediately on the north side of the county road running west towar<ls Madison and Uopa;r Valley. The land is owned hy Mr. Jefferson Wilcockson, of Sacramento, but now rented by Mr. "William Gibson, living one mile south of ·woodland; there is no fence around the land. On the opposite side of tho road is Mr. James Oliver's ranch. Ile is familiar with all the operations here and was heliotroper in 1880. His post-office is Woodland. The lall(l immediately west of the base-line is a little higher, but between that higher ground and the foot-hills there is a general depression parallel with the line of the mountains and tihe base. Just west of tLe northern part of the line the land is rolling, whilst on the east it is quite thickl~' filled np with farrn-l!ouses and the large groves around them. From Willow Slough sonth· ward the soil is very good, and this part is largely occupied by farm-houses and large surrounding groves. In a very fow years improvements will doubtless cover the line.
MARKING THE llA.SE STATIONS.

In Ju11e, 1880, upon the final location of the two ends of the base, they were marked before the occupation of the stations with the 20-inch theodolite, as shown in sketch No. 29. The soil at Southeast base is a very fine sand, with an admixture of clay, but not sutBeient to

cause it to be de.signate,d other than a fine sandy soil, formed from the material deposited by overflows of the Putah Creek. It is easily worked with the spade and does not require the pick. The elevation of the pier was such that it required a large foundation, and this was pr~jected at 70 inches square and 50 inches below the surface, to be built of well-burned brick, with cement. The sketch shows the general proportions of this pier and base. Below this base, however, there was placed a granite block 12 inches, squared on top, and 2 feet 11 inches deep, with a somewhat irregular base of 20 inches. This was a truncated pyramid, irregularly square. The top of this stone reached within 4 inches of the base of the main work, and wa.8- wholly separated from it. The base of it was in cement, placed in the lower excavation. On the the top was deeply cut the legend as shown in sketch. The marking for station point was on a fiat-headed round copper bolt, 5 inches long and five-eighths inch diameter. The head was turued wi\h a fiat spherical surface, 1~ inches diameter, and into the top was inserted a German-silver wire. In the polished end of this wire was punctured, with a needle, a fine hole about one-twent,y-fourth inch in depth (by estimation). This mark was transferred to the surface by means of a finely turned 42--pound plummet, hung carefully over it, and examined by a magnifier. Then meridian instrument No. 1 was placed on its brick stand at the transit ar.d latitude observatory, at right angles to the base line, and a Ginch Gambey theodolite on the liue to the northward, nearly on line of base. The foot-screws of the meridian instrument were removed and the base cemented to the pier and adjusted, and the fine plummet thread bronght between the middle thread and the micrometer thread, which had been moved close thereto. Mr. Gilbert adjusted the theodolite aud brought the X-threads on the plummet thread. Then Mr. Colonna placed four stubs around the station, two east and west, two north and south. In each pair of copper nails fine pointl:i were pricked, in line with the plummet thread and the meridian instrument and the theodolite. These marks were for tests and checks, lest the instruments should be disturbed. Over the copper bolt in the subsurface block, a nearly hemispherical glass about 3 inches in diameter was placed, and the earth then tamped around it to the level of the grouud upon which the base of the brickwork was to rest. The work for the brick foundation then commenced by wetting the soil at the bottom of the excavation, spreading a good layer of cement thereon, and working it well to establish its connection with the soil. Brick courses were carried up 14 iuches solid and 70 inches square; then the pier was battered and brought to receive the surface block of granite 26 inches square b,y 25 inches deep; upon this being properly placed, the brickwork carried to the surface with sides of 54 inches. This work was then allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, when the surface-mark for the station was made. This marking is on the· upper surface of a copper bolt, which was set i11 lead and then driven until the head was batte"red out nearly even with the surface of the stone, polished and burnished. Then a minute hole was made in the copper at the intersection of the lines from: the instruments; after which cross-lines were made with a penknifo merely as guides to find the hole. Into this mark was stuck a fine needle, placed Yertical, and all was then covered with a glass tumbler, and the work on the hollow pier was commenced. The pier is here 54 inch1>s square, with a hollow shaft 16~ inches square (to the t-0p). To see the mark, two sight channels were left in the pier, one from the hollow center towards the meridian iastrument1 and one from the hollow center towards the theodolite. A wooden box with trap-door on top protected the glass and mark from falling mortar, etc. In filling in earth around the subsurface part of the structure four barrels of charooal and charcoal dust, which had been burnt for the purpose, were mixed with the earth in tamping. The pier was carried 33! feet above the surface~ and upon its top was laid a granite slab 40 !JY 40 by 8 inches, with a hole ll inches diameter in the center. Upon this granite slab, after the pier had set, the position cirole and t.heodolite were centered by means of the instruments already referred to. Subsequently, to provide against the possibility of the pier getting a cant during wet weather, etc., four reference marks were established to recover the station. These are especially referred to on page 142. This precaution was proven to have been necessary after the rainy season of 1880-'81. The making of the Northwest base station was almost identical with that of the South-

east base. The same chara.cter of granite blocks, masonry, etc., was used; and the same methods of marking and reference. The soil at this station is a moderately stiff clay below the surface, and had to be picked out. When it was replaced around the brickwork two barrels of charcoal were mixed with tlie earth iu tampiug. It should be mentioned that when the base-line was measured the extremity of a bar projected 1.96 metres beyond the base station. To mark the end of thi11 bar, one of the" fence stones" was placed in the ground, with its surface even with the top of the soil. Into the top of this stone block was leaded a copper bolt, with a small mark in it, to denote the point from which the fraction of a bar was measured. The top of this stone is marked:

REFEI{ENCE MAUK8 FOR SOUTHEAST RASE STATION.

(Sketch No. 6.) 'l'o proYide means for restoring the station in case of the tower taking a lean during the time it was allowed to staud after the llorizontal directions and azimut.hs had been meaimred, Assistant Colonna was detailed in December, 1880, after leaving Vaca Mountain station, to place sub-surface 1mirks, below the reach of the lilow, on the line of the uase northward, aml at right angles thereto eastwardl_y, which he did, a:s per :sketch. To place the ~rnhsurfaee structure of brick iu cement, a hole for each was dug 3 by 3 by 3 feet; theu two eoun;es of bricki,; were laid in cement; then a cube of granite, one foot. each side, wall set on this. hi the upper surface a copper bolt wais set, leaded, aml driven in solid. The brickwork was then carried up awl arouutl the stone tliree bri~ks square on the outMido. Each block is lf foet high and the tops are 18 inchei; below the surface. To mark the bolt iu the granite cnbc, meridian instrument No. 1 was placed over No. 2 block, and its center marked b,y a drill-hole in the top of the copper bolt. Then the instrument was directed to the 1>tatio11, and a drill-!.t0Ie mad<" in bolt No. J on the line. The meridian instrument was then viaced over :So. ~l block. The copJJer bolt was marked in the same manner as No. 2 bolt had beell, and tlien tile instrument was directed to the station, alld the l\ o. 4 bolt was marked b.Y <lrill-1.tole in tlie line. All were tested repeatedly. The bolts Nos. l and:; were protected by drinkiug-gfasses turned OYer them; arouud each glass, cement was placed to form a hard setting for them, but was prevented from adhering to the stone by placing a sheet of paper under the cement. No:s. ~and 4 had not this protection. Tl.te granite block of No. 2 cracked when tl.te bolt was driven home solidly. 'l'he zenith telescope and tmnsit piers, being on the line No. 1-No. 2, were removed to the lowest two courses, which are 18 iucl1es below the surface, its rough references only.

position a hole was scraped in the soil to a depth of 3 or 4 inches, and the block placed in it. The knife-erlge was placed iu the line of the bar, and the fine line approximately located under the end of the bar. .An ivory scale divided to 0.50mm was then placed in line with the bar, and a given division of the scale-for instance, 20.00mm-was made coincident with the fine line by means of a magnifier. The scale was made level. Then, with the sector, the end of the bar was transferred to the scale. After some progress, the method adopted with the sector was to level the transit axis, point on bar, and read the scale once; theu reverse the transit axis level, adjust ancl point on end of bar, and read the sector again; then reverse the telPscope in the Y's, lpvel transit axis, point on end of bar, and read scale; reverse transit axis leYel, adjust and point on encl of bar, and read scale. At each reading the ivory scale was reset. The sector was placed a distance of uearly 20 feet from the end of the bar and at right angles thereto. The magnifying· power of the telescope was measured 20 diameters. The legs of the tripod of the sector were cut short, so that the height of the telescope was about 3 feet above the ground. This enabled the end of the bar and the metre scale to be seen with the same focus of the telescope. Three of these granite marking-blocks were in use, so that no block was removed until another, or a kilometre block ahead, bad been established. After some progress of the work, I adopted the rule of using the sector always on one side of the bars.
THE MOVABLE COVER FOR '!'HE BA.SE .A.PP.A.R.A.TUS.

Having determined to measure the base-line with the beams and trestles carrying the basebars protected from the direct action of the sun, I gave to Assistant Gilbert a general idea of what I wished, and the cover was constructed under bis direction at Sacramento. To protect the bars from the direct action of the 1mn, to secure them from injury at night, or during any temporary suspension of the measuremeut, and to allow ample room for movement during work on both sides of the trestles and bani, it was necessary to hitve a cover 50 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 9 feet high, one that should possess great strength and yet be light enough to be easily moved by two or three men. The foundation was a parallelogram of the length and width just named; the material WM Puget Sound fir, and the size of the timbers 2~ by 6 inches; the angles were strengthened by heavy three-eighths-ineh angle-irons and stout bolts. The canvas cover was stretched over wagon hows of ash, spliced so as to obtain the necessary width and heig·ht. Four wheels were used, each having a diameter of 3~ feet, and eacl1 pair secured 10! feet from the en<l, in such a way that they could be readily detached and the frame-work allowed to rest on the ground. This was always done during any temporary suspension of the meaimrement, and at night the cover was completely closed by cauvas curtaius and secured so as to aJford entire protection to the apparatus against wind and rain. The whole cover complete weighed about 1 1200 pounds, and on hard, leYel ground could be moved by one man. ·when at work, the standard bar No. 2 was carried secured to the rail on the shady side of the cover. Suitable shelves and bags served to hold such tools, instruments, etr., as were needed from time to time during the progress of the work; thus loaded the wheels doubtless sustained a weight of J 500 pounds. The entire frame-work is fastened together with ordinary carriage bolts, and can be readily taken apart for shipment. The movable cover became known throughout the region as the" Yolo buggy."
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PARTY.

The readiest way of understanding the movement of the party at work is by an examination of the annexed plan (Sketch No. 30), exhibiting the bars and tripods or trestles in position, and the traces of the men's forward movements. As we actually reached an average of fifty-seven bars per hour, and frequently several consecutive bars in forty-five seconds each, it will be readily understood that the whole of the movements must have been almost as regular as machinery. Every officer and man bad a specilic duty assigned to him, and no deviation was allowed therefrom. The general forward movement may be said to commence at the command "Break," when the contact slide of the forward bar wMJ tlni.wn

back, and the after bar was drawn back, lifted out, and moved forward. The tripod men relieved the tightening of the legs, pickecl up the tripods, and IDO\'ed forward, where the tripodi> were imt in line and in position by au ofiicer; the plates followed and were placed outside the position of the legs; then the tripods were placed on the plates, accuratel,y distanced, le\'eleu, and clamped. The "buggy" moved forward as soon ai> the plates were raised. One officer, near the sector, guarded the bar which remained in position. An officer then received in his own hands the after end of the forward bar, and was then responsihle for it until the next "break" of contact. The details of aligning the bar, raisiug or depresi:;ing the after end, making approximate contact, reading the Borda aml mercurial thermometers, reading the sector, and making final contact under a magnifier, fe.il into their regular and necessary sequence. It was the duty of each officer to guard against errors of reading scales and thermometer; of the recJrder, to announce any seeming de\'iatiou from regularity of change; and of the chiet; to call for any re-examination if he suspected mistakes. The sector readiugs for inclination were checked by a re-reading; aud in the second measurement one officer read the sector and left it witlwut annouucing hii:; reading m1til' the second officer bad given the degrees aud minutes. It will be noticed that the bars were carried forward ou one side of the line of tripods, officers arnl plate and tripod men remainiug on the other, and no one was permitted tu pass under the bars. When no actual measurement was being made, and wlleu tlle night or bench-mark or any other mark was being referred to, all hauds left the inside of thl' "huggy" until, recalled. At the close of the day the bars and stanuard were put in 1108ition on the comparing lieam, resting 011 two trestles for the morning curnparisou, aml lightly coYeretl with canYas against rain beating through the light cover. At night the watchman had a llamrnock swung under the ''horse'' or trestle over the wheels. · Before the measurement commenced the bars were compared with the standard bar, in the condition in whfoh they h11ll remained over night; then the sectors were examined by the leveling instrument for the <letermination of the zero of the inclination arc. The after bar was then plumbed over the night mark, and at its satisfactory measurement the command "Break'' announced the forward movelllent of the bars. The night mark was covered by a box and left intact until another mark had been secured. It will be seen hy the plan that tlw following perisonnel of the party was requisite on the ground: Chief of Party Davillson, Assistant Gilbert, Sub-ai>sistauts Dickins, Pratt, Blair, Recorder Hill, Mechauiciau Suess . . . . - . - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 Men, 11; watchman, 1; driver (au<l extra, who also attended to bridges, etc.), 2. 14 In camp: cook, ofifoers' steward, men's steward . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 Total, officers and men . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ............

FOOT PLATES OF THE TRESTLES.

These plates were devised as a substitute for ,those with circular grooviugs, the latter being too limited in their range. The plate herewith exhibited in section and plau was found to answer all the purposes demanded. (See Sketch No. 29.) The plates were laid independently of each other, and with very little practice tile men became familiar with the best m0<le of stamping them down. They were used on every character of ground, and bad t,heir severest test on that part of the line torn open b,r innumerable "drying cracks," as mentioned in this report. Each Illate weighed 9! pounds, aml the points were tumed st.eel riveted on top. There were none of them broken or injured in the work.
COMPARISONS OF THE BASE BARS WITH THE FIELD STANDARD BAR.

I had brick piers built at Southeast ba.ae, Middle base, Northwest base, and Camp Schott, upon which to place the frame made by Mr. Suess, in ca.mp, for carrying the two base bars alJ(l standard bar during comparison. Independent piers carried the comparators. All the earlier comparisons were made on this frame and piers at camp and at Southeast base.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Haviug determined to mak<> compariso11s of the base bars and standard every morning before comme11cing measures, J directpd ::\Ir. l'ratt to make a portable. wooden beam, which should rest on two ordinary trestles. Upou each end of this beam a comparator was to be secured, and the comparisom; were to he made upon the assumption that tlie beam llid not change in length during the period of each comparison, or if change took place it might be measured b.r knowing the temperature of the beam and its coefficient of expansion. As soon as the beam wa;;; constructed these daily comparisons were tnadc. At northwest bMie thi,-i beam restflfl on the brick piers, but their comparators were in their places 011 the beam. At Camp Schott, at the close of the mettsnrernents, the beam also rested on brick piers; comparators on the beam. The beam is described as follows, in l\Ir. Pratt's own words. Of course it would have been better rnalle and wit,L special adjustments if time and means had been available. It was made by l\fr. Pratt in camp, and its working was satisfactory: "The i<l<'a of using iu tl1e field a sing·Je beam so arranged that one base bar could he laid on it at a tinw and its rnf'asure or comparison taken, tlien rernoYed entire)~· and replaced by another bar, and 8Q on) was suggested to you, I lwlieve, by Assistant Schott. "Tlw hcarn was proportion!'d and made to earr~· out Assistant Schott's suggestions, which accounts for its hei11g so Harrow. After it reached the field it was decided that it would be best to }lilt all the ban; 011 at one time, and I deYised and executed all the present attachments. The cru<le11ess of construction and arra11genwnt was due to the limited means at hantl. The plank.<! tliat compose tlw hP1rn1 are of tlwrougbly seasoned two-inch white cedar, and are securely bolted together i11 such a rnauuer that they ean be retightened at any time in case of shrinkage. In order to make it as portable as possible, the usual carriage for carrying the bars was diseardNI, t11(· bars tliemHchcs actiug for that pnrpose by simply resting m1 tbe two hard wood pieces, which are at riglit auglPI", aml l1ave round metallic rails fixed t-0 their under sides. Each one of tlwse rails resto; 011 two groond metallic rollers, one on eitlier side of the beam; the two rollen; on the hack of t1H· apparatus, HS "1Cell in the drawing (sketch No. ao), are com1ected with cacli otlwr h~- a ;;:haft, and id>lo with the wheds at either end, which are used by the observers to mon> the baris haekward and forwar<l. 'l'here is a little lost motion in that portion of the shaft which is liPtwe!'n tlw two metallic rollerR, which enables the obsen·ers to give either end of the ban; a :slight i111lepem1Pnt rnoYement. "l'JH!Pr tlw poi11ts of :-;upport to ea eh bar are placecl dfagmrnl metallic plates~ with an adjusting scr<>w in c·ad1 end~ h;1· wliid1 means the bars are raiRed or depressed to the exact beight of the alm tting- pieces 011 tlie cornparators. By referri11g to the sketch the handles of the8e adjusting screws will he see11 to pr<(ject abo\'e the tops of the base bars."
MOVING TIIE BASE BARS INTO LINE.

b~·

Yarions plans were suggested to move the bar sidewa;ys b;y mecbanical means, but tbat, proposed l\tr. <~ilbert "·as accepted as the simplest, and was capable of being made by a blacksmith. (See sketch No. :!!.I.) An iron ro<l OJH'-lrn If inch diameter nnd about 14 i11el1es long had a coarse thread cut upon it for abont four i11d1t.·s umh'r tlH· l1Pa111. One eml of tliis rod was loosely fixed to tlie tri11od just below the leHl of tht> under si<k or tlie liar heam and ht> hind the uprights on the tripod. The free eud of t}1(· ;.;crew h·1r 1 with a cross for tnrui11g by was liftecl h~· the operator up mid against the under side of the hearn upou which was far;teued an iro11 plate with a 3-iuch longitudinal knife-edge placed at au augle with tlic bar equal to the thread of the screw. 'l'his knife edge therefore entered one of the threads, and as the screw was turned that end of the bar was necessarily moved sideways. Had tlH·re heeu time aud proper meanf' for executing a fair pii:ce of workm11nsbi11, it would have worked with sufficient smoothness; even as it wa{!, we owe the quickness of our measures, in great part at least to this simple and coarselJ· made contrivance.
MEASURE FOR FRACTIONAL BARS.

It was almost certaiu that a fractional bar would need to be measured at the north west end of the base-line, and also at each "fonce stone."

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

147

To make such measures with accuracy I made known to l\Ir. Pratt what I wislied done, and left the details to him. So I transcribe his description of tlie measure for the fractional bars as shown in sketch No. 30. "The wooden portion of the bar is of thorouglily seaso11ed wliite cellar 0.05m tllick, 0.113m deep, and 3.225m long; in order to prevent warpage it was split in two equal pieces and one of them t~uned 180°, and theu they were secure!;-;· fastened together. Oue ot' the lower e(lges wa:-; rabbeted out sufficiently to let in a steel bar 0.012m square; this steel bar w:u; griHlnated to three rnetres, and each one of these irnfrridual metres was compare(l with a standard metre b~· meaus of a micrometer beam compass, wllicll I deYised especially for this purpose. Sliding oil this steel rod is a vernier, witll clamps and slow motion. Ou the side of the bar is an or<linary lmse- bar :-;ector for measuring the iuclination. "In measuring a fraction of fiye metres, which occurred at all of tlle fence stones and at :Xort lt · west base, the zero of the bar was vlaced over, and usually in contact with, tlle fine point i11 the copper bolt, then the ,-ernier was moved until it came vertically under, as determine1l u_y a transit St\Ctor, the end of one of the base bars; tlie wlwk metres were tlicu read off snbjPet to the corrcc tions obtained by comparison, aud the fractional portiou of a metre Wtts trnusferred, with a knife· edged beam compass, to a metre scale to be read."
ALIG:KING TELESCOPES.

The aligning telescopes, one at the forward end of each bar, were upon my recommendation somewhat improved in their practical working, at the close of the first measuremeut, and subsequently Mr. Pratt fitted set screws to abut against a stud in the metallic end of the wooden beam, by which means they could be corrected in azimuth. SeYeral impro\'ements are yet desirable, and will be introduced. In the second measurement the bars were aligned between adjacent kilometre stones.
COMP ARATO RS.

The observations for comparison of the base bars with the standard were made with the two mierometer Fauth lever of contact comparators which accompanied the aJlparatus. These comparators are described and illustrated in Assistant Schott's paper on the construction of the apparatus (Appendix No. 7). (NOTE.-Assistalit Davidson has studied carefully the working of the apparatus in the field, and has made plans for certain improvements suggested by the seYere tests applied during the progress of the several measurements.]
RATE OF MEASUREMENT.

The following tabulation gives in detail the time occupied with each operatio11 in the measurement in the field. It indicates how well the party increased in efficiency in the successive measurements. The summary very clearly exhibits the results attained.

FlELD-\YORK OF THE TRIAXG!JLATION.
Hy H,ICI-IARD D. CUTTS, Assistant.

[Reprinte(l, with additions, from t.lrn Coa,st Snney Rt·port of lRGI'.]

Geodesy, in practice, may he deRcribed as a syi;;;trrn of tlw mot-it exact land-measurements, extended, iu the form of a tria11gnlati011, on:·r a Jarµ;e area; co11trulled, in its relation to the meridian, by astrOUO!llical azimutlJs; computed by formuhl' based Oil the dimem;iOlll< of the spheroid; aml placed in its true poflition 011 the surfact> of the earth b.v ai,;trouomical latitudes and differences of longitude from au estahfo;he<l meridian. Jn inver,;e order the i;;ame 1,;ystem of 01wrntionl'l, wheu comlucte<l in the general direction of the meridian or of tlle parallt>I, determiues tlrn length, iu standn1 d measures, of the astronomical degrees comprised within thP measured arc, and hence redetermines a value for the dimeusious and figure of tbe eartb. Three orders of triangulation are recognized in tbe geodetic operations carried on for the sun-ey of the coast: I. The primary series, with sides Yaryiug in length from about 20 to 100 miles or more, such as those which are com1ileted or in progreRs from the riYt·r Saint Croix to Cape Heury; lletween the Kent Islaud and Atlanta bases; on the liue of the geodetic connection betweeu the Atlantic and Pacific coasts; a11d from Oregou to San Dit·go. JI. The secoud series, with sides from about 5 to 40 miles in length, either conuecting the tertiar.v with the primary, or which, starting from iudrpendeut basl:'s, ii'> being gradual!~- extended over the coasts, sounds, and bays from the mouth of the Chesapeake to the Hio Grande; and, on the Pacific, from British Columbia to the southern bouudary of California. III. The tertiary triangulation, with 8ides Jps.-; than a hont (i miles in Ieugth, which follows the immediate line of the coast for the use of the topographical aud sounding parties, and includes the short serifls which branch off from the secondary and are carried up the smaller rivers and inlets of the sea. The primary aud })art of the secondary series, composed principally of quadrilaterals, and verified, at intervals, by the measurement of additional bases aud new determinations of the astronomical azimuth, latitude and longitude, constitute the standard geodesy of the sune)-. From this special cla.ss of the geodetic work, su~ject to the least probable error, the dimensions and figure of the earth are deduced, as in the me.asnre.mellts, made an<l in progress, of the arcs of the meridian in the Eastern, M:iddle, aud Southern States, and of the arc of the thirty-ninth parallel across the continent.
RECONNAISSANCE.

A ssstem of simple triangles entails the least labor; one of hexagons covers tlrn largest area; while a series of quadrilateral!~ seenrN' tl1e greatest degree of accuracy. The last system is the rule in tlle survey, although the other two are occasionally ernplo:.·cd aceordiug to the necessities of the case or to the particular object to be accomplished.· A careful reconnaissance invariably precedes the selectiou of new points for the continuation of the geodetic work of the survey. The first step v;·ill be to decide npon the proportions of the --·------·----------- --~--------

scheme best adapted to tlie character of the country and for the success and progress of the work, and the next the reconnaissance in detail. In the case of high elevations and au open country, little difficulty will be encountered; but if the hills are densely wooded and tolerably uniform in height, the greatest care and Akill are needed to select such intervisible points as are the most favorably situated, not merely for the extension of the triangulation, but to satisfy other condi· tions imposed by the survey. Should the land be uniformly low aud clear, the triangulation may be laid ·oft; as on paper, restricted onl.r in its proportions hy the cnn·ature of the earth and the height to which the sig11al and instrument should be elevated; but if covered with forest or heavily. timbered Hwamp, the length of the lines will be governed by the labOI' and expense of opening them, taking- into view the possibility of carrying on a smaller series of trianglel'\ immediately on the coast, or of a direct measurement of the beach, to be continued until such difficult section has been passed. If the reconnaissance co,·ers any extended portion of the coast, aud a scheme be adopted for the geodetic work, tbo question will arise whether the proposed triangulation, from its proportions, as determined by the chara<Jter of the countr,v, will need verification before joining on with the principal bases as measured in each section; and if so, at what intermediate points could such subsidiary lines and azimuths be measured and observed for the correction of the distances and (lirections. In the performance of the above duty, the asRistant will keep stea<lil.Y in view the requirements alik(i of the triangulation and of the survey; and it will be his aim so to modi(y and adjust them, each iu the ratio of its value, to the special features of the country under examination, as to produce a plan of triangulation which, while it 1:mtisfies the conditions prescribed, will be the most effective in its results aud economical in its execution. The most important of these requirements, beyond the paramount condition of the certain iutervisibility of the statiions intended to be connected, are1. The adoption of the highest elevations. II. The maximum length of line consistent "ith the limit of 30° prescribed for the least size or an augle. A smaller angle is admissible in quadrilaterals, and also at one end of a base of known line, but not at any uew point to be determined. III. The forming of quadrilaterals wheneve.r possible. IV. The modifications or changes which <1an be efiected in the position of the proposed stations, so as to avoid, as much as possible, the labor and expt->nse of opening lines through the forest or swamp. V. The sweep of the horizon, or of the an·a tu be surveyed, with a view to the easy determination of intermediate stations, and of light-houses, spires, chimneys, or other prominent ol~jeets not more than two or three miles apart, for the special use of the plane-table and hydrographical parties. VI. The capacit~- of the station ground to be protected from the destructive effects of stonns and waves and from the ordinary pursuits of man, with a view to the preservation of the station for future use. VII. The consideration of the altitude to which the theodolite must he raised to escape the variable refraction incident to the visual ray passing close to the surface of the ground. In caim a base of verification is required within the area covered by the reconnaissance, the examinat.iou will be more in detail. For the primary work, its length should be not less than 6 miles, and for the secondary between 2 and 3 miles. The site selected should be a level piece of land, the slope of the ground not t<> exceed four degrees; it should be as free as possible of aooi· dents, such as rivulets, ravines, or irregularities in the surface, in order that the preparation of the liue may not be too expensive; and its termini should be in such positions that they can be con· necte<l by well-shaped quadrilat~rals, either directly or through a short series, with the main triangulation in its vicinity. The reconnaissance requires the following outfit: A telescope and tripod, the latter with a small circle read by a vernier to 20 minutes; a declination-needle, to be clamped, at will, on the telescope, so that the zero.mark and the visual axis of the telescope will be in the same line; and, if in a hilly or mountainous country, a pocket aneroid barometer and detached thermoinet.er. The index and scale errors, if any, of the aneroid should be determined and entered in the record. If of small value they can be overlooked, as differences and not absolute height.II are measnred.

from the name of the owner or fonant of the land; or where neither owner 110r distincth·e traits are to be found, by !'melt designation as, in tl1e opinion of the assistant, will best serYe to attract attention to the special loca1ity. Tl1e same name should not occur twice witllin the same section of country. If it should be necessary to re-occupy tile station, am! the center cannot lie positin·ly identified, the fact should be stated, aud the approximate pusitiuu be designated as ~o. 2, or b,y the year of the re-oecupatio11, as, for iusta11ce, ''.Pd llill 1 or Hell Ilillrn""· If the new position is merely in the vicinity of the old ;;tatiou, an entirely new mune should be given to it.
SIGNALS.

The following signals are employed in the triangulation, according to circumstances: I. The heliotrope carefully adju>ited, 011 a >;tand or tripod, to the ceutn of station, and the pointing wntched and attended to b,;- an emplo:1e trained for tlie duty. Thi;; sigual is 11;,;ed when long lines are to be obsen-ed, or those rendered difficult !Jy haze, im10kc, or other impurities in the atmosphere. II. A reflector, such as 1lte frustum of a tin cone, monnkd on a ;;tout 11ole, supported and retained in position by a tripod, aml u,v wirt> gurs, is ad visa ule. III. And iu short lines, the simple pole supported b,y a tripod. IY. Night signal, such :ts tlH· ordinary coal-oil lamp with a reflector, or, for long lines, ribbon;; of maguesium bumed and regulated by s11ecial apparatus. The height of the pule awl di111em>ions of the tripod; t11e ho:mliug of tl1e upper and lower part, or the color of t,he pole, whether bhtck or whit(·, or with altnnate bands of e<wh, to insure prompt recognition; and the character of the mark, if an~-, centered on the top, to be used for identification, will ntQ· with and depend upon the length of the line, the altitude of the stati011, the backgronud of the Rigual as seen from the points of observation, and the atmospheric ditliculties to be overcome. 111 regard to the tliameter of the pole to be ousen-ed upon, it is eddent that, iu short lines, it should not tlxceed tlie ;;;ize ju;;t imftlcie11t to admit of it;;; hf~ing <listinetlJ· seen, as all beyond that is a source of error, arising· from tlte additional range given to the lJh;ecting thread. The diameter which subtends an angle of one second at one milt> is 0.307 of an inch, alHl hence, at 20 miles it is 6.1 inches. 60 miles it is 18.4 inches. 40 miles it is 12.3 inches. 80 miles it is 24.6 inches. These proportions show that, for lines exceeding 15 miles in length, tlie diameter of the signal should not exceed one second in value; while, 011 the otlrnr hand, as the pole, when. t11;;t.i11d, should be obserYed upon in preference to the heliotrope, aml can be he;;;t seen 1lnring cloudy periods, it would lie arhisal.lle, i11 long lines, to gfre to tht· pole uearly its full size; a11d it may be added that the lieight iu ;;ignal adds to its visihi lity and distinctness. A sketch of a tripod-signal is presented, tho height of which varie;; from 15 to 65 feet. 'l'he solid part of the pole above the -~ .....--~~. apex of thP tripod shonl(l not exceed 8 or 10 iuehes in diameter, · otherwise it would be too hea\'Y to raiNe. When once i11 position, the upper part can he increased to the de8ired diameter by nailing 011 slats of light seasoued wood, or this addition mlly be partially made before raisiug. In the erection or use of any kind of' signal no cllance for an error in the determination of the angle should be allowed by a want of care and precision in centering the inark to be observed npou exactly over the center of the station. And should this source of error be at any time sus11ected, an examination should he promptly made, and if fouud to exist, the distance arnl direction of tlte point, or center of the ohject a";tually observed upon from the center of the true station, should be measured and recorded for the correction of the angles. (See formula for eccentricity of signal.)

atmosphere usually lying immediatt>l~· OYer the low flat lands bordering the coasts and shores, vary in height from 10 to HO feet, and are madt> of scantling purchased for the purpose, or of materials obtained from the forest, and are built in general accordance with the plans and specifications given in the annual reports. \~lhile a strict adherence to nnif(mnity in the details of the construction is i1ot possible, so much uepe11d111g- npon the means and facilities at the disposal of the assistant, and upon a proper regard to economy, the general principles of strength and solidity, in both tripod and scaffold, are strictly obRerve<l by a proper spread awl anchoring of the feet, a thorough bracing of thP legs, :rnd a compact fitting of the cap to the top of the tripod. A careful atteution to these points will si·cure perfect. immobility while tlw obst'rvat.ions are being made and sufficient firmne1<s to keep the scaffold entirely and always free from contact with the tripod, and to enable both structure8 to resist the most ,-iolent storms. A ura wiug of such a tripod and scaftold is here gtven. It will be noticed that the diagona braceH of the tripod are spiked to the legs, 011e on the outside and the other on the inside, and that a space is left between the two braces where they cross. By (lra.wing together these diagonals on each face of tlte tripod, the_ structure can be screwed up or stiffened, in case it becomes loose from shrinkage or other cause. The following deseription and plan of a small portable tripod and scaffold may be of service, the height being well adapted for short lines on the southern coast: Tripod.-This is made of three legs, J 8 feet long and 6 inches in diarne.ter, bolted together, 3 inches from the top, witl1 an inch !Jolt, lU inches long. After they are fitted together at the head the spread being 13 feet, and before t'aising, one of the braces, e e, is screwed to the two outside legs, so as to keep them iu plact~ while raising the tripod by the third leg. It is then settled 2 feet in the ground, care being taken to level it by the IJraces e e, which are to be screwed on with wooden screws. Sw.ffold.-Four posts, lG~ fed long and 5 inches square; 8 cross-pieces, 7 feet long and 6 inches by l!, a a; :3 cro8s-piecPR, 7 foet long ana 6 inches by 1, b b; 4 braces, 10 feet long and 5 inches by 11, cc; .S fiooriug pieceR, 7 feet 3 inches long and 9f by 1, with holes for the tripod-legs.

The eud posts are those on which the braces and cross-pieces screw on the outside, and which are to be fast.ened together iu pairs, when on the ground, so that it may be raised after the manner of a bed~tead or house frame. The braces cc are to be bolted to the upper ends to steady the posts when raising them. All the holes in the posts, cross-pieces, and hraces are to be identical a.s to plan and size, as also the pieces themselves, so as to have no mistakes, and when raised the sea.f-

fold fits to the tripod, as shown in the drawing. The scaffold is leveled by the cross-pieces and adjusted, and in firm position after the floor is on, so as to be free from the tripod. The floor is to be 2 feet 10 inches below the top of the tripod. Three iron lrnem; are screwed to tl1e tripod-leg-s near the top, so that the tria11gnlar piece for the theodolite cau be bolted to tliem. This piece is maile of two pieces of one-inch plank, screwed together across the graiu, and tlrnu painted. Holei,; are made iu the floor for the tent-posts, and wire gu~-s are sometimes required for the sca1fold. The above takes about two hon rs to put up. One large and two small wrenches are necessary; also a bag to contain the serews, 11uts, &c. Should more than oue be needed, they should be painted different colors, but be, in all other respects, exactly alike, in order that one can be used to repair the other.
THE UNDERGROUND STATION-MARKS.

The station-marks include the underground anJ 1mrface marks; the former to be buried, and the latter to be thrown up for the presern{tion of the center and of the positio11 of the station. The requisites for an undergron11d mark or one buried below the frost aud plow line, aurl hcyond the reach of ordiuary accident or interfere1iee, ~my thn'f'. feL~t, in the clear, below the surface, are: indestructibility, peculiarity, capacity to resist displacement in ca~<' it shouhl be a.ccidentall.Y strnek, cheapnes8, and, finall~-. want of Yaluc for any of tlie ordiuary purposes of life, as a protection against cupidity. The following marks, partaking more or less of these essential qualities, have been rHlopte!l iu the surn~.v: 1. The frustum of a hollow stoneware cone, called the Hassler cone. 'fhe di111em1io11s for primary stations are for the upper and lower diameters and tho heig·ht 8, 12, aud 15 inches, respectiYel.v. 2. One similar in shape to the preceding, but made of iron, and oecasionally w-ith a rim like that of a hat, encircling the larger diamt>ter, upon which are inscribed in the castiug the words "U. S. C. and G. SnrYey," or au abhreYiation thereof. 3. A hollow stoneware pyramid. 4-. A slwrt column of marble, grauite, or san<lstone, manufactured for the purpose, and iu some cases placed above tlle cone, the top reachir~g within :six inches of the surface. 5. A block composed of brick or stones and h;ydraulic cement. 6. A bottle with three others just below tlte surface pointing to the lower one. The ceuter of the station iu the coric is either the center of the periphery or the iutersection of two lines drawn 011 the bea<l of a copper tack driven in a stub. plact>d and packed inside of cone , an<l sometimes extending within a foot of the surface; or, when a block is used, h~ the intersection of cross-lines on the head of a copper bolt inserted for the purpose. 'rhe initials lJ. S. C. & G. S. are occasionally cut upon tbe block. Of these and other ''arieties of underground marks which ha\·e heen adopted at times from choice aud again from necessity, tbe stoneware or iron coues are clearly to be preferred.
THE SURFACE STATION-MARKS.

The surface marks are so varied in their character, and depend so much upon the nature of the ground, that no special rules can be established for th~ir selection. What would be highly appropriate in one case would be eqnal1y inappropriate in another; and at many localities, such as those affected by the winds and waves, and unavoidable as stations from the necessities of the work, no marks whatever can lle arranged or erected with any hope of perman'lm;y, exeept at considerable expense. As the object of the surface marks is to secure the position and recognition of the station at any time hereafter, it is evident that the general principles which should govern in each case, to the full extent to which tlte locality will admit of their application, are, permanency or durability, facility with which they can be recoguized, and the absence of value. for any domestic or farm pur· pose. The following methods of marking have been employed in the surve~-: 1. A. ho1e an inch or two in diameter, drilletl in the rock on whieh the signal stands, and filled with lead, sulphur, or a copper bolt. 2. In the oai>e of earth, a stone block, pillar, or post, marking the center of the station, a.nd three others, two iu line and one at right angles, equidistu.nt from the center.

'l'HR OBSERVATIONS AND RECORDS.

Two classes of theodolites are emplo,yed in the triangulation: I. Direction instruments, with circles from 8 to 20 iuches in diameter, aud armed with either two or three micrometer microscopes for close reading. These are devoted almost exclusi\'ely to the pr~mary work. II. Repeating instruments, with circles from 8 to 12 inches in diameter, and supplied with either two or three verniers. The record books, octa.Yo for both the originals and duplicates, are prepared with printed headings for the different columns, showing the order in which the details are to be entered.

Uniformity in the method of observing and of recording the observations should be strictly observed. 1. The number of the theodolite, the diameter of its circle, and the order of its graduation, whether from left to right or from rigllt to left, should be entered at the commencement of each volume. 2. The angles should he mea~mred in the direction of the increasing numbers on the circle, so that, with tdescope direct, the first reading may be subtracted from t,he second. The station first pointed at should be the first named. After obsf'rving- a series of directions, say from A to F, the pointings, telescope reversed, should be from F to A, or over the same arcs, bnt in reverse order. 3. lf the tele8cope cannot be reversed except by being lifted from its supports, the microscopes or vernierR should be reread afhw reversal. 4. If a rPpeating inRtrnment is employed, the pointings should be so arranged as to fall upon as man.\' different part8 of the circle as the size of the augle and the proposed number of measurements will tilwmit, in order to eliminate any possible error of graduation or eccentricity. Jn the case of a dirention instrument, the same ol~ject is accomplished by changing the position of the eirele. This i8 done hy m('ans of the rPvolving stand, or by turning the circle in it.s collar. The number of these chang-es or positions will depend upou the size and character of the graduation of the circle, but it must always be a prime number, such as either 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23. The circle, or aHo0 , is th~ divided by the prime number adopted, and the resulting number of degrees and minutes will be the quantity to be moved forward for each new position. 5. The closing· of the circle, or the measurement of the angle between the last station and the first, should be made with the Rame care and number of repetitions with which the regular angles were determined. 6. Should the theodolite, or the object. observed upon, be eccentric, the fact or facts should be mentioned on the proper page of the record, and a plan and the necessary data for correcting the directions or angles should be clearly presented on one of the blank pages at the commencement of the volume.

7. When a correction for phase becomes necessary tlte angle between the signal and the sun and the time should be recorded opposite to the observation to which it belongs. The form anu dimensions of the tin cone or other reflector should be included. 8. The obsen·ations should alwa~'S follow iu the record iu the order in which they were taken; and each book should be filled up, one station following the other, iu the order of time, witil the cJose of the season. 9. 'While order and clearness in t.lie record should not he endangered for the sake of economy in pages, unnecessary space between the ohservatio1ns should he equally a\'Oided iu order not to iucrease the number of volumes. It would add to the completeness of the records if a rough plan of the triangulation executed during the season should he drawn in or attached to the first volume; and, also, if at the com. mencement of each station, the telescope fixed at zero should be pointed at the tirnt station, and then, following the graduation, t-0 the next, and so on to the starting· poiut, completing the horizon and recording the reading in each case, so as to obtain the approxinrnte angles and the relative direction of each station. The following abbreviationfi denoting the kind of signal observed upon, its appearance, &c., are those generally adopted in the surve,y. Too great detail in this matter is not considered necessary, having no weight in the computations; in cast's where tlw, angle is really believed to he affectkld by the condition of the atmosphere in either magnifying, distorting, or giving too grPat motion to the signal, the observer will say so, and, after giving his reasons, will reject the ohserYations; and if he does not, the computer is rarely, if ever, authorized to do so .

CORRECTION FOR ERROR OF RUNS.

No special form is required for the observations to determine the errors of run of the reading microscopes. Such observations are entered in the record as they are made, generally on first occupying a station, and principally for the purpose of verifying tlle imposed condition that the adjustment of the microscopes to the graduation of the instrumei1t should be so far perfected that five revolutions of the micrometer screw do not o\·errun or nnderrun a five.minute space on the circle by a greater error than two seconds. The regular observations or readings on all parts of the circle taken during the occupation of the station will supply the data for determining the mean error of runs to be used in the correc· tion of those observations. a.

NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS.

The number of oh8ervations required for thP drtermination of a11y onP direction or angle must deprml 011011 tlie desired closeness of result and tl1t~ character of tlJe iustrumeut. Each obsernttion consists of two 1)ointmg-s, one in the direct and the other in the reversed position of the telescope. If tlie uumher of positions adopted for the instrument be seve11-equi\-ale11t. Lo an advance of fiJO 2G' for ellch clmng-e-there should he not less than five observations in eacli poi;itiou, or thirt.yfin· determiuations for eaeh direction.

If the triangles belong to the terti<uy series, the sides being 5 miles and under in length, the numher of sets will Yary from three to six, accordiug to the dist!tnce along the coa-~t en-er which the chain will extend before a verification can be effected by connection with a line of thP i;econdar~- triangulation, or by the nwai;urement of a sulisidiary base. In this claiss of angles, each i;;et is made np of three repetitions iu t lie D and three in the l{, in order to increase the mun her of separate n·sults with a view to comparison and the elimiuation of error. While a minimum nurnhn of mea;mrements ma,v be prescribed for each angle belonging to the orders of triaugulation referred to, the maximum must be left entirely to the judgment of the observer. In f'ormiug this judgment, the known or supr><ist>d character of the iustrument in regard to accuracy of graduation or the reverse; the elevation of the instrument; the differently refracting media through which the line of 8ight passe8, as oYer alternate sections of land, marsh, and water; the lateral refraction incident to long lanes opened throngh the forest or swamp; t-he appearance of the signal, and the condition of the atmosphere, will.. be taken into consideration, and the observer, from 011e cause or another, may deem it advisable to multiply hi:s observatfom1 until be becomes

LIMIT OF ERROR.

Assuming 3 11 to be the limit of errol' of closing· in triangles of tl1e primary order, 611 in those of the secondary, and abont l'..!" in those of th·~ tt~rtiary series, it is certain tllat to secure the desired degree of accurac.r the observer should give his careful attention, seriatiw, to the following
})Oints: 1. To the diameter and centering of each of the signals to lie obserrnd upon. " To the stability of the sta11d or tripod 011 1Yhich the theodolite rests.

3. To the centering of the instrument, arnl to its acljm~tme11t for parallax, coUimatiou, aud le,-el. 4. To his personal comfort when oh:-;erYiug, hy h:wiIJg the eye and telescope at the ~mme height when standing in a natural position. u11d by avoiding the nceessity for any strain on the body or twist in the neck to look at an;v particular ~ignal. 5. To the, preservation of the lHds while ob:'.(·rving, aml to a certain degree of rapidity in the pointing eomiistent with a clear and decided bisPction of the sig11al. 6. To taking the different sets rpquired for tlw determination of the angle, part on one day and part. on another, or dividing them bPtweeu the a. m. and p. m. perioch1 for obsen·ing. 7. To deelining to observe nuder au.r mauifestly improper or doubtful comlitiou of tlie atmosphere, as shown principally hy the siguals. The observations taken on a day when the sky is entirely o·ercast from sunrise to sunset are the most reliable, and next in xalue are those taken during <1 calm afternoon when the sky is whollJ' clear. The a. m. olisenations, made before the sun hafl dissipated the n1pors of the night or has quieted '1ow11 the irregularities ill the lower stratum of the at11108phere by au equalization of the temperature, are !Jclieverl to he the most uucertain. The~m irrt'gularities may be recognized by an unusual refraction or elevation of the signals :tlion' the horizon, beside the jmuping duplieation, or distortion of the image, ~wd tht> greater the wrtical refraction the greater will be the probabilit~ of a slight lateral devia.tion in the ray. After the prece<li:ig precautions have been strictly obserYed, and the prescribed number of measurements taken, the next step will be to examiue the separate values of each angle with a view to ascertain th~ probable accuracy of the 11oiutings. The probable error of an augle in the primar.r triangulation shoul<l not exceed 0".3, and in the Hecondary 0".7. It is not improbable that afte.r the prescribed 11umber of sctl'.l has been taken, a critical examination of the values, and of the circumstances under- which they were obtained, will show that additional measurements are necessar.v or advisable. There are other errors beside those of poiutiug, which, notwithstanding ever.}- precaution, mas Jargel,r increase the probable error of the resulting angle. The fact of an agreement among separnte measurements is not a proof of haviug obtained the correct value of the :mgle, unless those mea!'!nretneuts were made under different conditions of the atmosphere, and during a. m. and p. m., to guard against an altogether one-sided refraction and illumination of the signal.

The number of measurements required for each angle having been taken, the next 1Step will be to apply to each, or to their arithmetical mean, as the case may l.Je, the corrections for phase, or ecce11tricity of the object observed upon, or those due to the occupation of au eccentric station. The angles in the abstract being corrected accordingly, if any :such correction should be necessary, the final computation of the triangle sides will he commenced by computing the spherical excess, and hy the lliRtribntion among the angles of the error found in the triangle. The example gi\'en in illustration of the following formulm for reduction to center of station, phase in tin cone, eccentricity of signal, and spherical excess, are believed to cover every possible case.
RED'GCTION TO CENTER OF STATION.

Wheu the center of the station cannot be occupied, the theodolite is adjusted at a point as

close as possible to the center, which new point is called the eccentric station. To be able to reduce the angles measured at the eccentric to the center of the true station, it is necessary that

The bright phase belongs exclusfrely to the curyecl cones usuall.r employed as signals iu the primary and secondary triangulation. Tlte line of reflection, or the illumiuation, is always on the same side with the sun. If, therefore, the direction to the second signal is on the same side of the reflecting cone as the 1mn, the correction is additive to tbe obsened augle; if on the opposite side, subtractire. If both signals are retlectiug, or illnminateu cones, the difference between the two additive or subtractive corrections, as the case may be, is the correction to be applied :± to the angle. The angle between the sun and the signal should be measured immediately after completing the set of repetitions to which the correction must be applied. ShouM the angle be omitted, but the time be recorded, the azimuth of the sun maJ· be corn1mted. It should also be matter of record whether the cone reflects or merely shows white.

DISTRIBUTION OF ERROR.

In the primary series the errors are adjusted hy the application of the method of least squares, as explaiued and exemplified in appendices Nos. 33 and 14, Annual I~eports for 1854 and 1864; or distributed iu proportion to the probable error of each angle as determined directly from the measures of the angles. In the secondary triangulatiou the error is distributed as above, or in inverse proportion to the number of measures taken of each angle, or, in les:s important ca8es, equally among the three angles. Iu triangles of the third order th~ error, as a rule, i:s equally tli8tributed among· the three angles.

*For phase.

The preceding form sho'Vl·s the application of the corrections for phase or eccentricity, and the one which follows, the spherical excess and distribution of error. It will be noticed that the station of Mount Equinox has not been occupied, and, hence, the angle is marked c for "conclude<l." In the arrangement of the triangles for computation, whether belongin~ to a quadrilateral or not, the station to be determined from the base being the first named, is termed the apex; and from this apex, the other two stations must be invariably entered in their azimuthal order, that is, from left to right.

The angles used in the above compntatious arf'. the spherical angles taken from the computation of triangle sides. In the computations for L, 1\1, z, the first computation should be made ou the left-hand page of the form, and the second, or check computation, on the opposite page. Previous to February 4, 1880, the above computatious were ba:;;ed upon the elements of Bessel';; spheroid. Hereafter, they will be invariably made in accordance with Clarke's spheroid. The corrections, required by this change, to the values_ of the coefficients A, B, C, D, and E, as published in appendix 19, 1875, are readily obtained from the subsidiary table given in the same appendix.. ·
SPIRIT· LEVELING.

The spirit-le,rel is employed to determine the height, abO\'e meau tide, of the principal triaIJgnlation stations on the coast, to senre as bases for the trigonometrical leveling, and, indirect.I.)', the coefficient of refraction; aud, also, the ditforencc in height of the mean tide at different localit,ies for use in the discussion of the tides. · . To obtain the required degree of accuracy and confidence in the results, the following system has been adopted: L The line starts from a bench·mark .011 the coast, the height of which abo,·e the meau tide has been determined by observatious tluring not less than a semi-lunation. IL The line is re· leveled in an opposite direction; or, in other words, the route is divided into short sections, and each section is leveled, forwa,rd and back, before proceeding t,o the next. The intermediate bench-marks supply intermediate checks. III. The instrument and the method of observing and recording are so arranged as to secure the adjustment of the instrument or its equivalent, checks upon the leveling, and precisiou in the results. The details of the above operations are given in the "general directions for running a line of levels." It is proposed here simply to refer to III. The spirit. leYel, whether of the pivot or ortlinary construction, has the diaphragm of its telescope provided with a reticule of two vertical and three horizoutal wires . The leveling·rod is carefully divided at the office into metres, decimetres, centimetres, and halfceutimetres, and is provided with two small levels inserted in the rod, with which to preserYe its vertical,ity when held upon the foot·plate.

The foot plate is of iron, triangular in shape, with a circular cavity in which the rounded extnm1ity of tue rod rests, aucl ·with three short legs, by means of which the plate can be firmly vlautPd iu the g-rouu<l by a Htamp of the foot. A light chain and ring is attached to the plate by which the rodman mm pull it up aud carry it on to the next statiou. Thrt>e leveliug-rods aud three foot-plates belong to the party, one set being held in reserve in ease of accident t.o either of those in use.

'J'RIGONOMETRICAL LEVELING.

Differences of height are determined hJ the measurement at one station, by means of a vertical circle, of the double zenith distance of the signal at each of the other stations.· .A.not her method is to measure, by means of a micrometer inserted in the eye-piece of the telescope of the tllel,)dolite employed for horizontal angles, the tlifference8 in altitude between the difterent stations, expressed in minutes and seconds of are, in connection with one or more of the statio111:1, or a refercncf' mark, the absolnte height of which, or its zenith distance, has been obtained. A similar serks of observations beiu~ taken at each successive station, and ai;suming that we start from one the exact height of which a born mean tide has been determined by the Bpirit-level, we outain ehccks, or different va.Jnes for the elevations, rarely exceeding 3 11 to iY' iu arc, aud these errors are finall.Y assigned. to their probable true place by' the method of least squares. Tlw state of the level at the commencement and end of the observation, and the hour and minute at which it was made, are entered. in the record, and also the observations made to .determine the value, in seconds of arc, of one turn of the micrometer screw. The !wight of the telescope above the ground at each station occupied, and of all tile signals or objects obserYed upou, should be carefully measured and made part of the record. The following example of the abstract ior vertical augles will show the data which· are indispensable, and, incidentally, the fact that by reducing·, at the outset, the observed zenith distance to the gronnd at each station, 1Some labor and possible complication are saved in the final computations. The correction for error of level and. of inclination, taken out from a table constructed for the purpose, i1S applied in the record, and this corrected zenith distance is called in the abstract the observed zenith distance.

Reciprocal zenith distances measured at any two stations at the same moment of time, or under the same supposed condition of the atmosphere., give the l1est resultP.. \Vhen reciprocal, but not simultaneous, the ohsern.itions should be made on different dayi<, as in the case of horizoutal angles, in order to obtain, as far as possible, a mean ,-alue of tbe rlifference between the respective angles and an average value of the refraction. Tile same care should be takPn wbeu the zenith distance is measured at oue station only. Experience hHs proved that the refraction is greater and more variaule at sunrise than at any other hour of the day; that it gradually diminishes, in both respects, until 9 or 10 a. m.; that between those hours and 3~ p. m. it is comparatively st.ationary, and from 31- p. rn. to sunset it increases in amount and va,riation, being the greatest during the night. The best period for obserdng, therefore, is between 9 a. m. and 3g p. m., and the worst at 1:murise and sunset. The condition of the atmosphere and the relative refraction may be so different at stations situated more than twenty miles apart, that, as a general rule, the difference of level determined even by reciprocal observations cannot be relied upon for the desired degree of accuracy at distances greater than about twenty miles, unless a ,·ery large number of measnrNnents have been marle under tLe most favorable circumstances. The higher the elevations the more reliable the results. When a station is occupied for vertical observations, the zenith distance of every signal in sight should be measure1l, so a.s to have more than one check for each altitude. A number of such measures and differences of level should be RO combined, b.v the method of lea!->t squares, as to give the most probable values for the respective altitudes, as well as for the coefficient of refraction for the period of observation.

'.l'HE CO·EFFICIEN'.l' OF REFRACTION.

The co-efficient of refraction, or proportion of the intercepted arc, is determined from the obscn·ed zenith distan<><>s of two stations, the relative altitudes of which have been determined by the spirit-level; or, from reciproeitl zenitll distances siniultaneous or not, under the assumption that the mean of a number of obsen-ations taken under favorable conditions will eliminate the difference of refraction which is found to exist, even at the same moment, at two stations a few miles apart. Such a co-efficient may bt~ establishe1l for the level of the sea, or for high elevations, or for lines over water or over land. As, however, tile difference of height, deduced from trigonometrical leveling, depends upon the co-efficient multiplied b.r the square of the distance, it is evident that the longer the line the gwater would be the error caused by any uncertainty in the co-efficient or actual refraction, aml that, consequentl.r, there is a limit to the distance for which any assunied mean valne of the refraction can be depended on for accurate results.

THE '.l'HREE-POIN'£ PROBLEM.

If three points, forming a. triangle of which the side,; and augles are known, or can be computed, be visible from a fourth point, P, it is required to determine the position of P. Set up the theodolite at P, and measure the two angles snbttude(l by any two of the given sides. 'l'his problem is of use iu cases wliere the regular triangulation having been completed, additional points are required for tile topographical surn\y, or are needed for special service. The angles should be carefully measnred, and in the computations the logarithms should be carried to seven places of decimals. Three cases of its application are gfren, as in others, such as when P falls npon one or the other of the sides of the known triangh,, or on the prolongation of either, the case resolves itself into the solution of a simple triangle with one side aml the angles given; or the problem is indete1·minate, as when P is situated ou the ci rcu1nfm·euce of the circle passing through the three known points-a contingency which rarely occurs.

Example for each of the three cases.

The results are verified when both triangles give the same value for the line P A. For tlw, problem and an example by C. A. Schott, of determining a position by augles observed upon a number of gi,-en stations, see page 116, Coast Survey Report, 1864.
R1W1'.A.NGUL.A.R <JO·ORDIN.A.TES ON .A PLANE PROJECTION.

The method of plotting the position of trigonometrical points by rectangular co-ordinatcR is occasionally _adopted in the field, aml consists in referring the points of the triangulation to two straight lines, intersecting each other at right angles, called the co-ordinate axes. If 0 be the point of interRection, or origin of the axes, then y will be the axis of ordinate~, x the axis of abscissm, and Aa, Oa, or y, x, the rectangular co-ordinates of a given point A. Should the true meridian be known, let that be the axis of ortlinates, and the point of intersection a trigonometrical point; if not known, adopt as the axis of abscissm, a side of oue of the triangles, which, if extended in one or both directions, would pass through the ceuter of the triangulation, or as near thereto as possible. The triangulation point at one or the other end of this line, as may be preferred, will be, therefore, the origin of ordinates. \Vhatever may he the direction of the line, assume it for the present purpose to be a meridian, and count the azimuths from south to west as in the L, M, Z computations. The values of the rectangular co-ordinates y and x, are obtained by multiplying the triangle side b.v the sine and cosine of its azimuth. The abscissa, x, will he additive when the azimuth is in the first and fourth quadrants, and subtractive when in the second and third. The cornputed ordinate y will be subtractive frolifor additive to the fast onlinate, according as the azimuth converges to or diverges from the axis of abscissm. If the ordinates on one side of 1he axis of abscissre be regarded as positive, those on the other side will be negative. Should the line adopted pass through the chain of triangles, as in the following example, having trigonometrical points on both sides, compute the rectangular co-ordinates for the points on one side, and then for those on the other, and the computation will he verified when the sum of the ahscissre, on reaching the terminal point~ shall be the same by both series.

MEASUREMENT o:F SUBSIDIARY BASE-LINES.

The Coast Survey annual report for 1854 contains a full description of tl:te compensating base ap. paratus employed in the measurement of the primary bases on the Atlantic Coast, and the report for 1857, a general deseription of the sliding-conta-0t apparatus for subsidiary or intermediate bases.·
·In 1880-'ill, a. new primary five-metre <JOmpeusatiou ba.se apparatus was ooustructe<l on the plans and under the direction of ~ist&nt C. A. Schott, and wit.h it the Yola Base, California, 11 miles in length, has been lately measured.

UNI'rED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The intermediate fines are required either as checks upon t.he series of small triangles extending along the low coasts south of the Delaware, or for the determination of the distance aml direction between two places which cannot be connected by triaugulation except at very great expeuse and probable risk of accnracy. In the latter case, a succession of line:,; and their deviation in direction are measured, and, if the operation is carefully conducted, and the lines on the beach are not less than two miles in length, the results, when compared with distancPs from the primary bases, will uot fail to he satisfactory. To explain fully tlie different successive operations couuected w·ith the measurement of a subsidiary line, it may be, perhaps, the \Jest plan to present an abstract of the report of tlrn measurements made h.r the compiler on the Virginia Coast, south of Cape Ilenry, in 1867. Bit,w apparatus.-The assistant is referred to the description of the apparatm· and the mode ot using it as gh·en in the Coast Survey annual report for 1857, with the remark that the defects in the original, as first employed in the third measurement of the English base on Hounslow Heath in 1784, have been snccessfolIJ· remedied. In addition to those important improvements, the rod~ employed in 18U7 were six metres in length inRtead of four; the level of the sector was made more delicate, and on each of the forward trestles a roller was placed to facilitate the m(wement of the bar, forward and back, during its final adjustment. Length of rods.-A comparison of the two rods with the standard six-metre bar should be made at the office in Washington, both before and after they are used in the field, aud, if no accident has occurred to either during tlle interval, the mean of the two cowparisons should be adopted a8 their respecti \·e values. 1n deducing th<> leng7h of rod from comparisons with the standard six-metre bar No. 2, tlle following data ma,y be e:n11!oyed: Lengtll of Rtand:rnl bar No. 2 at 320 F _ ___ .. _. _.. _ - . . . _.. ___ . 5m,9999gz33 One di\·isio11 of tlte scale of comparator, T<iao of an inch._ .... _.. _. om_OOOOOl 74 Co-efficie11t of ex;mnsion for F. scale .. -.. - .. - . - .. _. -- . ___ .. __ .. om.00000641 'fherrnometer atrached to standard-too high _.. _. . . . . _... ··- ____ -00_7 ThennometerR attached t-0 rods ± (in this case correct).

PrY:paration of tlte line.-The locality of the propose<l base ha\'ing been sekcttid, eitlier on the heacli, adjoiuing· i;a1J1l plain, 01· hanl laud i11 tlie interior, tbe Jiue is traced and its 1lirt!ction aftjnsted to the h·ast u1wn·11 gronml aml to a\'Oid the tide, dunes, or hillocks, and then cleared of all minor obstnH;tio11:-i. Jfonu.mcnts.-After tlH' line has Leen finally laid out, the monuments are erected. Tbe1:1e ma.v he lnerdv the uwlergrou11<l perm:u1ent marks, brought up level with tbe surface of the grouud, and the t<;r111in11s of th·~ liue marked thereon, the cap or ttpper blo<1k beiug reserved until tl1e horizontal

'l'he operation of ending- the measurement at a given point is leSll liahlt.1 tu enor an<l uwre <>conomieal of labm· than the process of putting in a temporary mark, and t.he11 :-i11perse(l i 11)! it 1l,V' a final one at some ti me after the measnrement has been completed. Ali!fmnent.-Tlw lla:-v is alig-ued by setting up straight poles, prepared fol· the purpose, at about en~ry lialf mile. This may be done by adjusting the transit over the mark at one ernl, fixing the crosis-liains 011 the signal at the otl1er terminus, and by a system of siguals to the aid, who is urovided with a telescope, pnttin1::· the poles in line, working in the direction of tlie iustrurnnt. Durillg the memmrement, an aitl1 with his transit is statfoned in the rear, ne\"er more than about one-fourth of a mil(' from the apparatus, and directs the alig·nment of the bars b)' move'llents of his arm. A small wau<l al10nt the size of a lead-pencil, and painted black, is firmly fixed in a nll'tical positio11 at Urn forward end of each bar, directly over the rod, and when the bar has been approximately brought into position by the men who ba\'e it in charge, a signal is made and the aid perfect.s tlle aligomellt. Adj11,~t11wnt of the rtpparrttus.-Bef'ore commencing the measurement, each bar iR ~1ppropriately arranged upon trestks, and the knife-edge at one end and the center of the plane at the othflr are brought to the 1<ame level, hy means of a leveling iustrument placed about 20 metres from each end. The roll beiug leYel, th<' level and zero of the sector are adjmsted to this condition of the rod. 'fhe ,;ame operation i" gone through with after the measurement is completed, to ascertain if the rt~lation lw.tween th(' 8edor and the rorl has changed, or, in other words, if the readings of the sector linrn truly expressed the inclination of the rod; and if not, the error. Half of this iadexerror is the conPctiou to he appliell to t,he recorlled incliuatious, thougli, if it is small, as ju the following case, arnl the angles of elevation and depression are about equal in number and value, the error is not appreciable:

The i.;ector of rod No. 2 ha,d remained unchanged. Preliminary measurement. -The preliminar.r measurement is made with :ir1 iron wire, about oueeighth of au ineh in diameter, and 60 metres in length. 'rhis distance .(10 bars) is measured off with the hase appamtu;.;, start.iug from the initial point, should the gronud be favorable, aml extemli11g i11 the direction of tlie base-liuc. The terminiw is marked by cros::dine8 drawn on the lrnad of a copp<'.r tank driven in a >1tnh sunk level with the surface of the ground. The inclinations and temperatures are reeorded, in order that the exact distance may be computed. '.l'be wire1 which has been previously uncoiled, straightened, and otherwise prepared, and also provided with a loop at each extremi(y, is ti.Jen stretched between the two marks by a chain staff at the after 'end, and a weight of forty ponnfls applied to the other by means of a i,ipriug balance. In this condition, and aftN· repeated trials, tbe measured distance is transferred to and marked ou the wire by a fine line cut mmr ead1 loop. The wire is then drawn forward, stretched in line, the uniform weight of forty pounds applied, and nt a giveu signal from the ai(l in charge of the after end, indicating the adjustment of the wire tnark to the stub mark, the forwar(l mark is transferred, by a pencil, to the planed surface of a small wooden bench, sunk nearly level with the ground. The penciled line i$ then numbered, the wire carried forward, aliguetl and istretchetl as before, the after mark adjust,ed to line on bench, the forward mark trnnsforred to another ancl similar bench, and so on to the terminus. The. bench, which is about one foot square, and provided with four short legs, is firmly planted in the ground by tile pressure of the foot after the wire ha.s been approximately ad.iu.sted for di·

rection and distance. Four or five of these benches will be required, one being always left a wire behind as a precaution against accident. Stubs are driven at every second wire~ or 120 metres apart, to serve as fa~sts of correctness in counting the bars dnriug· the final measurement. Each page of the record will COIJ)llence and end at one of these stubs. The end of the last wire, before reaching the forminns, should he mark<·<l by cross-lines 011 the 11suJ1,l COfJ}Jer tack and stub, so that when tlie final measni:·emeut reaches tlie mark a dose compariHon ma,\- he institntA>d, if desired, between the two rneai·mrements. AR the last wire will either fall short of or go beyond the monument, the difference should be mea1mred with the 20-mPtre chain, a tape-line, or metre scale, according to the distance, :md duly rpcor<lP<l with its appropriate sign. The above operation requires very little more time than thP or1linary chain-measurement, and is much more satisfactor.v. In order to show the accuracy with \vhich such rapi11 mea~mrmnmits may be made on Im-el ground, the two following comparisom; are presented:

The temperature of rods.-The thermometers attached to the apparatus are compare11 with the standard at the ofiice, and the corn·ction to be a,pplied, if an;r, is rnarke1l OH the scale. Tlie temJleratnre as a rule, is read at every teu bars! aud without withdrawil1,g t.he tlwrmoruetcr from its position next to the rod. E\'ery possible ca.re should be taken to pre;;erYe an even or'1i!lowl.' changiug temperature, and that the thermomeu~r o;l10uld express the temperature of the rocl. The hox in which the bars are deposited at the close of the day's work shonld be left in au e:u;t and west direction, SQ that one rod or one thermometer may not he found the next morning· irnduJ~ heated hy ha,Ting been exposed tu the morning sun; and shonM auy great llifforenoe he noted between the two thermometers, a delay of half au hour is achisa!Jle t.o permit them to settle down to about the same degree. 'l'he measurement should stop when the tempera.t ure is lffer 1000. Inclination of t11c rodx.-The bars, for obyious reaRorns, sl1onld not lie a II owed to rest for an:y length of time on the trestles; and as rapidity in the measurement is iu some degree essential to ito; success, 110 time 8houlcl be lost during the operation in a.11 attempt to keep the bars exactly level. The inclination should be observed while the assistant is perfecting the colltaet, awl the e11._rrection therefor will answer iwery purpose. 1Vheu the inclination exceeds :p or 40, or is beyond th0 range of the sector, a vertical offset becomes necessary. The transit is set np directly opposite. to the eud last adjusted, and very carefully Ie,·eled. The after-bar is then carried forw;ird, placed on itR trestles, leveled, and aligned, and t.ben moved backward or forward, as tlw case may require, approximately by baud and finally by the slow-motion screw, until the knife-c1ige, adjnstPd for coincidence of line, is brought in the vertical of the plane of the fixed rod, under tile direction of the aid in charge of the transit. When the col'ltour of the ground shows that a Yertical offset is una\'oidahle, the last bar shall be made as level as possible. Care should be taken, however, when approacl1ing an elevation or depression in the grourid, so to manage the inclination of' tlrn bars as t-0 avoid or to have as few as possible of such offi::;ets. 4 table containing the correctio.11 for eacl1 minute of inclination may be computed by the following formula:

For verification, change the position of P, and from the new point observe the same angles, and with these recompute x. In the above the unmeasured distance determined from two positions was found to be identical. Verification of measurmnent.-Care must be taken, while making the contact, to bring the knife. edge to the center of plane; to hold the magnifying glass parallel with the rod when bringing tlie line.on the index plate and slide to coincide; to make no mistake in reading the thermometer or angle of inclination, and especially in the adjusti.nent of the transit for vertical offsets, or when the end of the rod is to be transferred to a stub. To test the accuracy of the measurement, a part of' the line should be always remeasured, and if there is any doubt, the entire line. The following comparison is copied from the record of the measurement on the Virginia Coast: August 301 1867, from bar 148 to bar 286, inclusive, Ill Mean of rods=6m.00164579 x 138 bars .. -·...... 828.22711902 Correction for temperature above 750 . . . . . . . . . . +0.00227743 m Correction for inclination of rods . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0.02329017 - - - - - 828.20GlOG28 September 2, same distance remeasured, · Mean of rods=6m.00164579 x 138 bars.......... 828.22711902 Correction for temperature 75°.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +0.02084498 Correction for inclination of rods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0.02279271 Correction for error in alignment of 19 bars..... +0.00007717 Measured excess, at 286th bar. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . - 0.01970000 - - - - - 828.2055484G Difference about two-hundredths 01' an inch.... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.00055600 Length of line.-The mean temperature of the ro<ls during the measurement 1s obtained

At each station the horizon was closed by observing the supplemental angle, and while occupying the initial point, the azimuth of the triangulation was transferred to the terminus of each of .the me:tsnred lines, as well as to the most distant visible station, to serve as checks and conditions.

ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF OBSERVING TRIPODS AND SCAFFOLDS.
By C. O. BOUTELLE, Assistant.

UNI1'ED ST.A.TES Co.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

· Washington, D. C., June 2, 188l. submit, with this letter, a men.10ir on the subject of observiag tripOlhl :w<l scaffolds, as devised and constructed by me between 185! and 1879. I have endeM·ored to make the paper a practical manual, stating all details which a beginner should know, with tables of all dimensions to which material is to be cut, its size aml exact length, et.c. The proportions given start from the :fioor of the scaffold, at a height of 96 foet, or about 101 feet for the telescope, and apply for any lesser height by simply stopping at the height wanted, i. e., the zero of the tables is the floor at top, and not the gronlHf. The sketches are of the simplest outline character, to show methods of construction. No elaborate drawing of the structure as a whole is girnn as it could not be used in construction. I bope this contribution to an important element of sncceRs in our triangulations, may be of service in enabling others to profit by my experience. I desire to call your special attention t-0 the statement in the memoir of tlie first use by the Coast Survey, in 1868, of position·instruments of large dimensions upon wooden tripods, with the legs of the tripod exposed to the action of the sun while screened from the wind. So far as I ha,·e been able to ascertain there is no record of any similar experiment in any part of the world. Repeating theodolites had been so mountt>d for many years, but these require only a momentary stability, rarely equaling a minute of time, while turning the telescope from one signal to another. Position-instruments require, on the contrary, either absolute stability for a consider· able period or a method of obserYation which shall eliminate from the resulting directions any error caused by the motion of the tripod. This I ham devised and applied in practical obserrn· tions tor thirteen years. Yours, respectfully, CHAS. 0. BOUTELLE. 0. P. PATTERSON, Superintendent United States Coast and Geodetic fJurvey.
DE.A.R SIR: I

Observing tripods and scaffolds were first used upon the Coast Survey by Assistant Edmund Blunt, upon Chesapeake Bay, in 1849. They were also used by Assistant R. D. Cutts, in Texas, in 1850. These last were similar in form t-0 those now used. Those of Assistant Blunt were Qf an entirely different construction, having a cent.er post and tripod supports, with the legs spread like a signal. Similar ones were used by me in South Carolina in 1850 and 1851, but I found them subject to a vibratory motion, which interfered greatly with precision of observation. To remedy this defect, while engaged iu the primary triangulation of the sea-coast of South Carolina and Goorgia, in 1854:, I devised a form of observing trip0tl and scaffold which bas been largely adopted, with various modifiea.tions, by the parties of the Coast Survey in different parts of the United

St.ates. I ham used tripods and sca,ffolds of tllis form at prim'l>ry triangulation stations in Maine, New York, Maryland, Virginia, :North awl South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, monnting both twenty and thirty-inch theodolites upon them at eleyatious ranging from thirty-five to scwenty-one feet, with the legs of the obse1Tiug tripod always exposed to the action of the sun while shielded from the wirnl by light cotton screens spread upon the windwanl faces of the scaffold. A description and sketch of this form was puhlishecl in the Coast S11rvey Report for 1855, Appendix No. 57. In all cases of obser1·ation in series with large theodolites mounted on these tripods the resulting directions have equaled in precision those observed with the same instrument upon the ground. The :iccor<lanee of results by the two methochi is well shown in the obsen·ations at Hill Station, in Prince George County, Maryland, near \Yas11ington. 'rhis station was originaUy occupied by rrof. A. D. Bache, Superintendent, in 18JG, with the thirt.Y-ineh theodolite, the instrument being upon the gron11d. In 1868 I reoccupied the station with the same instrument while exten<ling the primary triaiigulatiou from the Kent Island base to the Blue Ridge., To see Sugar Loaf Mountain from Hill it became necessary to elevate the instrument 55 feet. There was no known instance in the history of geodesy where a large and heavy position-instrument had been used at this elevation with tlle legs of the obserYing· tripod exposed to the action of the sun. At my request Profel'sor Peirce, then Superintendent, permitted me to trj' the experiment. To nm.kc it a thorough one, I reohserved with the same iustrumeut, at an ele\·ation of 51) feet, the directions observed from the ground b.r Professor Bache t1venty-two years before. The two sets of resulting directious agreed within the probable errors of observation. The test hc>re applied was as severe as possible, an<l the result, especially in the general symmetry of the obsenation, 'rns all that could be desired. Hill was 011e of three statio11s forming the triangle, Hill, Stabler, Peach Gro\·e, at each of which the same iw;trnment was used, i11 the same manner, upon similar tripo<ls. The triangle closed witl1in less than a q1rnrtcr of a ::;ceoud to au angle, affording another proof of the possibilitj- of maki11g· g·1Jo<l and reliable ol>serrnti011H with position in.qtJ·11mpJJt,-; thm; mounted. Proportions 11f 'Tripod 11nd 8cajfold.-A proportion fomid to he perfecUy safe is that of one foot rn<li1ts 1or l'Yers tire fret of wrtical elentii011, 1<0 that for a tripo<l f>O feet high tlie radius of the circumscribing circle wo11l<l be 10 foet plus the thiclrne..,s of the lPg of the tripod. A somewhat narrower base is 811tlkiP11tly safe an<l mon' co11Ye11iPnt, so that a proportion of one in eight ma;v be used. Very heaYy timbers liani lJeen used, usually 8 bs 10 inches, for the tripod legs,· but it has been found that lighter ones may he used witlt safety, especially where the structure is built in sections, as hereafter illustrated, tripo<l legs () by 8 inches being sufficieut.Iy solid. Their length should be sufficient to allow their tops to meet at a point 4 feet abm·e the floor of the scaffold, while their bottoms are 3 feet below the station llOint. For a tripod where the vertical lteight of the floor of scaffold is ()6 feet above the statiou point tlte nrtical height of each leg woul!l be 103 feet, the rMlius at bottom =

~~3 + 0.667 = 13.542 feet,

and the slant or actual length of each leg would he v1032::Fl2.8752=103.80 feet. The slo}le of each upright would be s20 52' 30". 'For the scaffold the square at the tloor should be 12 feet. Thi1:1 gives room for setting up either a "platform" or a" hoop" observing tent, each of 4.5 feet radius, with room to walk around the ftoor outside the tent, and to secure the tent to the rails, bolte<l to tops of corner posts, 3 feet above the iloor. The half-diagonal of the s<{lmre at the floor is 8.5 feet from the centre to the outside corner of each upright, Tliesc should be six inches square. The proportion of" batter" given each corner post is 2 incl1e8 increase of the distance from the centre for each vertical foot below tue iloor, orom.i foot in six. Tbe distance from the station to each corner at bottom (3 feet below ground or 99 feet below the floor), would therefore be 198 inches+ 8.5 feet= 25 feet, and the side of the square 35.36 foot. The length of each corner post= 103.50 feet, and the slope= goo 32 1· These proportions would remain the same for any elevation chosen. It is convenient for pur-

poses ·of construction to make the vertical height of each tier of the scaffold 16 feet, and the height of th6 floor above ground a multiple of that number as 32, 48, 64, 80, or 96 feet. Outjit.-For the erection of an observing tripod and scaffold with floor 96 feet above ground, built in three sections, there is required : A leveling instrument and rod. This may be a gradienter, sector, theodolite, or any instrument capable of being used as a level. For lack of a better I have bored out a piece of sugar-cane plllgged the ends, bored holes in the top at each end, and inserte(l a couple of apothecaries' phials; with the bottoms uppermost. This, filled with a colored fluid and mounted upon an improvised Jacob-staff, made a very good leveling instrument. A ten-foot pole graduated to feet and decimals answered for a rod. A couple of portable sectors, or any instrument by which a point in the axis of the station may be found at any elevation, are also needed. No other instruments are wanted. A 10-foot pole, grad!la.ted from the leveling rod to feet and tenths, to be used in laying off all lengths of timber used and distances upon the ground. A carpenter's chest containing the usual tools. Those specially wanted are two axes, one broadaxe, one adze, three hatchets, two claw-hammers, three small sledge hammers, two combination saws, one rip saw, two iron bars, one level and one "Davis" adjustable level, which may be set to any required slope, and two braces with full sets of auger bits. The sizes t, {'6 , ~' 176 , and t inch should be in duplicate. They are in constant use in bolting the bracing of both tripod and scaffold, and are liable to be lost, injured, or broken. Three long augers, i, ~' and ~ inch, are needed for boring the holes for bolts used in splicing the large timbers. It is well to have all the tools in duplicate when working far from any source of supply. For hoisting gear there is required one large pair threefold iron blocks, with strong swivel hooks. The pulleys should be capable of running freely a fall of 'k-inch diameter, and the hooks of sustaining a weight of two tous. Also four double aud six single blocks, iron strapped. Four of the single blocks should be fitted with sister hooks. Of ropes there are wanted: one fall, 2~-inch manila, 420 feet long; two double guys for derrick, 2,\-inch manila, each 200 feet; three double guys for tripod legs, 2!-inch manila, each 180 feet; three single guys for tripod legs, 2!-inch manila, each 90 feet; three single guys. extra lines, 2!-inch manila, each 60 feet; four watch-tackle falls, 1~-inch manila, each 60 foet; one coil manila, usual Rize of tent lines; five pounds tarred marline; eight straps of 2;!-inch manila, varying in double length from 3 to 6 feet each. Thes~ should be very carefully spliced, as the "drnwiug'' of a splice might cost a life. These ropes shonlcl be carefully examined at each time of using, and any stranded or chafed part removed, since upon their capacity to bear the strain put upon them depends the lives of the persons moving beneath and around them. Laying out the ground.-If the ground around the station is wooded, a circle of about 100 feet radius should be cleared of trees and nmlergrowth, to allow room for framing the sides or the scaffold and sec_uring guys. Such trees a.s stand in good positions may be cut off about two feet above the ground, holes bored in them, and strong pins driven through them to serve as belaying pins for gu,Ys. If there is a tree within 10 or 12 feet of the station it may be used for hoisting the derrick, and then cut down and removed. For a derrick a single stick, not less than 30 feet long and 0.5 foot in diameter at top, can be used. This is supported by two double guys, secured at convenient distances, at right angles to each other. If there are no natural objects, as stumps of trees or rocks; use strong stubs driven down and backed by a split log or board hnried i.n front to help resist pressure, as shown in sketch A, Plate No. 33. The strap for holding the upper block of the fall is secured to the bead of the derrick above the guys, and the free end of the fall iR passed through a leading block Recured to the foot of the derrick. The station point is selected and marked by a nail in a stub. The top of the stub is a benchmark for soouring a uniform depth of 3 feet in all the holes, and the nail is the center from which all distances a.re laid oft' by the 10-f'oot pole. . S. Ex. 77-26

These distances depend upon the proposed height, according to the proportions already given The plan, Fig. 1, page 13, is drawn for a vertical height of 99 feet to the floor of scaffold from bottom of boles, with a middle post for the scaffold up to the top of the second tier, or 32 feet high. The distances to be laid off from the station point areFor tripods: Radius of circle to middle of back of tripod legs = ~ +0.667 =13.542 feet= distance station point to a, b, and c. Side of equilateral triangle=13.542xl.732=23.46 feet=a to b, b to c, c to a. For scaffold~ Distance station point to outside edge of each corner post (page 6)=25 feet. Side of square = ¥2(:!52)=35.36 feet, half of which on each side of the square, or 17.68 feet, will be the distance from the station point and from each corner of the square to the middle of the back of the middle post. All these points should be laid off upon the ground, roughly, with a tape-line, and stubs driven to mark them. It is convenient to dig only the holes at a, b, and c until the lower tier of the tripod is erected and completed. The holes are dug each 3.17 feet below the station point. Three shoes are made of the form shown in Fig. 2, page 13. They are 15 by 12 inches, and may be made of two or more pieces of board 1 inch thick, with the grain crossed. On these are nailed three cleats 3 inches wide and 1 inch thick, as in the figure. They are placed at the bottom of each hole, with the point (a) exactly 13.54 feet from the station point and 23.46 feet from (b) and (c), with the surface of the shoe exactly 3 feet below the station and the 8ides parallel to the radius. Earth is then filled in to keep them in place. It is evident that if the shoes are carefully set and each tripod leg cut to the same length and bevel, that the three must meet at the top in the vertical of the station point. It is best to nail three narrow strips together, two of them of the exact length, station point a, etc., and the other= a, b, and c, and bring the triangle thus formed successively over the points a, b, c, at the bottoms of the holes, finding the exact positions by plumb:lines dropped from the surface. Similar shoes are placed in the same manner in the holes at the corners and middle posts of the scaffold, except that the corner shoes are made one foot square and cleats nailed, as in Fig. 3. The point ( x) is set in the bottom of each hole exactly 25 feet from the station point, with the distance from corner to corner =35.36 feet, and the inner sides of the cleats in the line of the sides of the square. Framing and hoisting the tripod.-It is not easy to procure timber over 40 feet long. It is better therefore to make each leg out of three pieces and splice them. together. It is most convenient in building to get out three pieces 40 feet, and six pieces of 36 feet each, all 6 by 8 square. I have found a three-foot splice of the form shown in Fig. 4 to be of sufficient strength. Each is held by six bolts of %-inch round iron, with square heads, nuts, and washers. Two 5-inch "boat spikes" are driven into the thin end of each splice, when it is finally bolted after hoisting. · After fitting the scarf together the holes for the bolts should be bored "drawing" in order to bring the euds of the scarfs very tightly together, and the three pieces bolted so as to form one stick 106 feet long. If any of the legs are winding or irregularly cut from hewn timber, a line should be drawn down the middle of the back of each leg through its wbolo:i length, and the chamfers for bearings for the braces should be laid off from this line. The longest of the three pieces should be at the bottom of ea.ch leg. The tops of each leg should then he cut to a bevel of s20 52~', as in Fig. 5, (This angle is ll inch off:3et in 10 inches and may be taken from any square by setting the bevel li inches in, at 10 inches from the corner of the square.) The lengths to be laid off and the size and dimensions of the braces are as in the following table:

The distances in the first column should be laid off, measuring with the graduated pole from the top of each leg, along the middle of the leg, and drawing a strong line not easily defaced across each stick at the distances 5, 8, 13, etc., from the top to the bottom at 103.80 where each stick should be sawed parallel to the top, as in Fig. 6. The inner edge of the top should be cut to an angle of 1200 in the middle, so that the three legs when in position will meet at the top, as in Fig. 7. To give _a bearing for the braces a chamfer must be made fl inches above, and as much below, each line drawn across the back, as in Fig. 8. The chamfer must be 1 inch on t.he back and l! on the side. The natural cot. 30° is 1.73 which is sufficiently near to l! to render the chamfered surfaces parallel, when the tripod legs are in position. If the longest (40 feet) stick ltas been made the bottom one, it will be found that no chamfer comes at a splice. As little should be cut from the bottom as possible, and whatever amount the leg is too long should be cut from the top, in order that the two lower tiers of braces ma.r come upon the lower section, with the first splice abo>e the second tier of braces. (See Fig. 11.) The system of bracing for tripod and scaffold is shown in the skeleton sketch, Fig. 11. It is of the simplest character, but has developed imfficient strength to withstand very severe gales. I can vouch for the entire stability of the observing tripod up to a height of 70 feet, and feel sure of it at 100 feet if braced as here drawn. The bolts being taken ont of the splices, a block is temporarily nailed to the upper edge of each splice of the lower sections, as in Fig. 10, to be used in bringing the tops into position after hoisting. The three lower sections of tripod legs are hoisted to their places in turn. Each has secured to it, about 6 foot below the top, one double and one single guy. With the foot of each leg m its proper shoe the top is hauled out by the guys until its slope is near the angle of 820 522-'· This may be found by sawing a pattern from a piece of board with the two sides adjacent to the right angle, respectively 10 and 1! inches. The hypothenuse will be at the proper slope, which may be set by the cross-level of any, carpenter's level. It may be found more readily by setting a "Davis adjustable level" to the required slope. After securing the guys, cleats are nailed on and the tackle is cast off. When all the three are in position, cleats are nailed all the way up, and with one man at the top of each stick, a pattern, Fig. fl, previously prepared, is hoisted and nailed to the temporary block at the top of each leg. If the lower section of each leg is exactly 4fffeet from the bottom, then the distance from the top ~ill be 103.80 - 40 = 63.80 and the radius will be 63: 0

+ 0.667 = 8.642 feet

and the equilateral

~ide = 14.96 feet. The pattern is

made of light strips, with these dimensions, with a strip crossing the centre where a hole is bored for a plnmb line. The tops, secured together by the three pieces, are moved by the guys until the plumb is over the station point, when the holes a.re filled up to the surface, and the lower tier of braces bolted

on with 6-inch boat spikes, boring through the braces and being careful in driving that the lip of the spike cuts across the grain of the tripod leg. After bolting the lower tier of braces the guys may be removed and the upper tier bolted in the same manner. Planks are laid across the horizontal braces of the upper tier to form a secure foot for the der_ rick, which is now raised by a tackle leading from the top of a tripod leg to tlw foot of the derrick very much as a royal mm;t is raised on board a ship, a hand at each guj· paying out, and keeping the top of the derrick in position as it rises. When secure, the mtddle sectio11 of each tripod leg is i·aised and fittpd to its splice, '' hich is solidly bolted. Three guys are also attached to each leg, and the same process of adjustment ornr the centre is gone through with, until the tops are in position, when the third and fourth tiers of braces are bolted. The upper section of each leg is then raised and allowed to rest upon tbe ground, against the tripod, where it is secured until the scaffold can be framed aml the lower sections erected. Framing and ho·isting the scaffold.-The corner posts of the scaffold should be not less than 6 inches square. The lengths of each section are the same as in the tripod, viz, four lower posts 40 feet, eight upper posts 36 feet each. These are spliced in the same manner as the tri1iod legs, except that I use half-inch bolts 7 inches long, with nuts and washers as before. After splicing, these are framed in J>airs, working from the outside corner edge of each post, and lasing the cut edges of the splices yertical, as in Fig. 12. The distances from top of post and length aud size of braces are given in the following table; the proportion is, as before stated, one in six. The slope of each corner post toward the centre is soo 3~'; toward each other it is 83° 19', which is the angle at which the bevel should be set:

No line is cut. square, but all arc cut to the bevel, from the outside corner.

The posts after splicing being laid near each other in pairs, the distances in the second column of the table must be laid off carefully along the outside edges, a line being drawn with the bevel upon the upper surface at each mark, and others 4 and 8 inches below it., on the exterior sides, A mortise three-fourths of an inch deep is cut between the lines, to r·eceive the horizontal braces, each 3 by 4 inches in size. The mortises upon the sides are 4 inches below those upon the top, as in Fig. 13. The bottom of each post is cut parallel to the top. It will be level when the scaffold is in position. The length of horizontal braces given in the table, page 22, is for the upper side. They are to be laid in pairs and sawed to the bevel of the scaffold and marked as in Fig. 14. The upper braces will fit the upper mortises (a) Fig. 13, and the lower, marked "sides," will fit the lower mortises ( b) Fig. 13. After all the~e are got out, a side of the scaffold is framed a.ml bolted upon the ground, as in Fig. 12, except that the diagonal braces are not bolte<l at the splices. The horizontal and diagonal braces of the two lower tiers may be either bolted or mortised into the middle upright, which may be cut and roughly hewed upon the ground.

For bolting, 6-inch pressed "boat spikes" should be used, boring through the braces and bolting into the posts. With care, any twist or wind in the three long parts of each upright may be taken out in framing. The frame should be laid with the top of each side near the tripod and on opposite sides of it. After framing the scaffold, the bolts at the splices are withdrawn, leaV"ing each side of the scaffold in three sections. The upper and middle sections are successively hoisted and allowed to rest against the tripod with their lower ends upon the ground close to the tripod and inside the square the scaffold is intended to cover. The holes for the scaffold are now dug, and the shoes at the corners carefully secured in position and level as described on page 13. Each lower section of the scaffold is now hoisted and placed in position, with every post in its proper shoe, and is secured temporarily to the tripod with the middle of each tliagonal in the vertical of the station point after which tbe holes of the corner posts are filled. The side centre posts are next raised, secured tnnporarily to the tripod, and the sides are braced. To secure the four centre posts from sagging inward, four horizontal braces or girders are added after all parts of the scaffold have been hoisted, as shown in Fig. 15. They may be made from 4 by 4 inch scantling 20 feet long. After the lower section of the scaffold is in position and braced, the middle section is hoisted into position and tlle splices fitterl and bolted. Care should be taken to insure that the centre of the square of the scaffold is identical with the centre of the interior tripod, to whicll it is temporarily secured until the sides are braced. The scaffold being now of the same beig·ht as the tripod, a temporary platform of boards is laid upon the horizontal braces of the scaffold and tripod, and the derrick is again hoisted as before, when the upper section of the tripod is raised, one leg at a time, spliced and braced in the same manner as before. Very long guys are needed to both derrick and tripod legs while erecting this section, and it is for this purpose that the longer ropes described on page 9 are required. If due care has been taken in framing and hoisting the tripod, it will be found that the three upper sections when fitted to their splices will meet at the top very near the >ertical of the station point; so near that a person ascending upon cleats may easily spring them together if it cannot be tlone by the guys. The horizontal and diagonal braces are bolted, the tripod is completed, and the derrick may be removed. The tripod is now used as a derrick to hoist the upper section of the scaffold, which is raised, spliced, and secured temporarily to the tripod while the sides are braced. While framing the scaffold upon the ground, and before taking it apart for hoisting, cleats should be strongly nailed to each upright, parallel to the horizontal braces and fifteen inches apart, from the floor to the ground. They may be made from "strips" 3 by 1 inches, and should be each 14 inches long, so as to give a secure foothold extending four inches outside of each edge of the upright. They are constantly used when the station is occupied, in extending or taking in the light cotton screens used to spread upon the windward sides of the scaffold to keep the wind from disturbing the interior observing tripod, which supports the instrument when observing. It is also convenient to duplicate each set of diagonals of the scaffold-braces after the set upon the ground aie bolted, by laying another set over them for use upon the sides of the scaffold, cutting them to the same size, boring the holes for spiking, and, especially, clinching them by a spike at their intersections. Much time will be saved by this precaution. · The side horizontal braces of the scaffol<l are 4 inches below the others at each tier. Sleepers of 3 by 4 inches laid upon these support platforms at each tier, and stairways are laid from each tier to the next around the sides of the scaffold. A convenient and quickly made form of stairwa.y is formed by two planks, with grooves cut in them for the admission of steps (Fig. 16.) It is best to so arrange the stairways that the last one shall be parallel to the sleepers on which the floor is laid. Thi:I following table gives the dimensions of stairways for each tier. The rise or vertical height is 16 feet or 192 inches in each. The horizontal distance is least at the first or uppermost tier. Ea.ch side of a stairway is a single plank 2 inches thick and 12 inches wide, grooved as. in Fig.16.

The steps may be cut from boards 8 to 6 inches wide, each 24 inches long. As the stairways may be made under cover they furnish occupation for the workmen on rainy days, when outside work is interrupted. The distribution of the sleepers for support of the floor is seen in Fig. 17. The figure represents the centres of the obserring tripod and scaffold as coincident. In practice they are like to vary from 1 to 2 inches. Allowance must be made for this, if it occurs. A small frame laid in the centre, as in the figure, will be convenient to give much support to the floor boards at the points where they are cut. A free space of an inch should be allowed all around the tripod legs, and before laying the floor all connections between tripod and scaffold used iu building should be carefully severed, that each may take its own position independent of the other. Diagonal supports under the outside horizontal braces supporting the floor should be bolted, as shown in Figs. 11and12. The scaffold rail around the top of the uprights is of 3 by 2 inch scantling, planed and rounded at the corners. A similar rail is also bolted to blocks 2 inches thick around the scaffold at the floor. It is used to hold the top of the light cotton screens spread upon the windward faces of the scaffold during observations. A light rail around the inside of the stairways will also be found convenient. The tables, of dimensions and proportions given in this paper, will apply for any elevation below 96 feet, since all count from the top. For a height of 48 feet to the floor the tripod legs and scaffold sides may be hoisted whole without difficulty. For a height of 64 feet it will be best to build in two sections, taking the splices apart after framing. No middle post is necessary for the lower tiers of the scaffold at either of these elevations. I insert here a table of lengths of tripod and scaffold posts for different elevations.

With workmen trained to their di.ties, and accustomed, like seamen, to work at considerable elevatiom1, held in position at first by ropes only, a week of clear weather will suffice to build one of these structures of not more than 64 feet elevation. For one of a height of 96 feet, twelve work· ing days will suffice. I have put up one 45 feet high in two days with a force of sailors, and using sawed yellow pine lumber. It is best to avoid the use of cut nails when possible. They are largely made from iron of a very poor quality. Square pressed boat spikes, 4, 5 1 and 6 inches in length, a.re preferable. All kiqds of woods ma.y be used. In the Southern States the yellow pine is best, as being strongest (and also heaviest) and the cypress is to be avoided. It warps and cracks badly in seasoning. I

have used oak and chestnut and also spruce, fir, and white pine, with success in the Middle and Northern States.· In places where sawed material cannot be had, and forest timber abounds, it will be found best to hew the tripod at.1d scaffold legs into shape before splicing and framing them. Round sticks, chamfered at the ends and notched at intersections, make good diagonal braces. Whether round or sawed lumber is used, great care should be taken to see that the longer braces are- free from knots and shakes, weakening them where strength is most needed. The following "bills" or lists of sawed lumber required for structures 48 and 96 feet of ele·rntion will be found sufficient. The prices range from $8 to $25 per 1,000 feet, depending on locality and material. For 48 feet eletiation of floor. Tripod legs: Three pieces, 6 by 8 inches, 35 feet long; three pieces, 6 by 8 inches, 25 feet long. Scaffold legs: Four pieces, 6 by 6 inches, 35 feet long; four pieces, 6 by 6 inches, 25 feet long. Horizontal bracing: Eight pieces, 3 by 4 inches, 14 feet long. Horizontal bracing: Ten pieces, 3'by 4 inches, 18 feet long. Horizontal bracing: Five pieces, 3 by 4 inches, 22 feet long.· Diagonal bracing: Thirty pieces, 3 by 2 inches, 25 feet long. Diagonal bracing: Ten pieces, 3 by 3 inches, 22 feet long. Diagonal bracing: Ten pieces, 3 lJy 3 inches, 28 feet long. Stairways: Six 2-inch planks, 25 feet long, 1 foot wide; four hundred feet boards, 12 to 14 feet lengths; 200 feet (r11nning measure) of 3 by 1 inch strips. Also for splicing: Forty-two bolts with square heads 7 inches long, of g-inch round iron, with 42 nuts and 84 washers. For bolting braces: Two huudrt>.d and fifty pressed boat spikes 6 inches long, and one hundred and fifty spikes of 5 inches long. For nailing cleats, stairways, platforms and floor, there are wanted 60 pounds of lOd. and 20 pounds of Sd. nails. A. dozen bolts of !-inch round iron, with nuts and washers, will be useful. In framing a tripod and scaffold of this elevation, the shorter or 25 feet lengths of the posts sho11ld be made the lower ones. It may be raised whole, but it will be found more convenient to raise any greater height in sections.
For 96 feet elevation of jfoor.

Three pieces, 6 by 8 inches, 35 feet long; six pieces, 6 by 8 inches, 40 feet long. Four pieces, 6 by 6 inches, 35 feet long; eight pieces, 6 by 6 inches, 40 feet long. Eight pieces, 4 by 4 inches, 14: feet; eight pieces, 4: by 4 inches, 1G feet; twelve pieces, 4 .by 4 inches, 18 feet. Sixteen 'llieces, 3 by 4 inches, 14 feet; twelve pieces, 3 by 4 inches, 16 feet. Six pieces, 3 by 4 inches, 18 feet; six pieces, 3 by 4 inches, 22 feet. Twenty-seven pieces, 3 by 3 inches, 21 feet; 24 pieces, 3 by 3 inches, 23 feet. Thirty-two pieces, 3 by 3 inches, 25 feet; sixteen pieces, 3 by 3 inches, 27 feet. Twenty-four pieces, 3 by 2 inches, 10 feet; twelve pieces, 3 by 2 inches, 12 feet; ten pieces, 3 by 2 inches, 16 feet. Ten pieces, 3 by 2 inches, 20 feet ; six pieces, 3 by 2 inches, 25 feet. Four hundred feet (running measure) 3 by 1 inch. Twelve planks, 12 by 2 inches, 25 feet long. Four hundred feet boards 8 by 1 inches lengths, 10 to 15 feet. Three hundred feet boards 12 by 1 inches lengths, 12 to 16 feet. In all a.bout S,500 feet of material. Also for splicing, eighty-four bolts with square heads, 7 inches long, of §-inch round iron, with eighty-four nuts and one hundred and sixty-eight washers. Twenty bolts like above, 6 inches long, of !·inch round iron, with nuts and washers. Two casks, of 100 pounds each, of 6-inch and

" Hemlock for bracing is to be avoided if possible, but where no other wood i11 procura.bltJ, the size of tl&ch brace should be increased to :render them equal in strength to the sizes given for yellow pine as in the tables. The SQ.Jlle remark applies to others of the &Ofter kinds of wood.

For wire guys, 300 yards of wire rope !-inch in diameter, and twelve turnbuckles. This "bill" does not include the four middle posts for the two lower tiers of scaffold, which may be cut and hewed. If ordered at saw-mill, order eight pieces, 6 by 6 inches, 35 feet long, instead of four pieces, as in the "bill." The chief of party should give his pei:sonal attention to the following points: 1. That his material is sound and free from knots or shakes. 2. That his tackle, straps, and guys are sound, strong, and nowhere rotted, chafed, or stranded. 3. That every knot where guys are secured, or pieces of rope knotted together, is securely made in a proper manner, and that no slipknots or "grannies" are put in by inexperienced men. The Ii ves of himself and men depend on care in these respects. 4. That every measurement is carefully made by a common standard, which should never be a tape-line. 5. That every stick is cut to its proper bevel and length, so that each part may fit when hoisted to its place. Too much care can hardly be bestowed .upon these matters, on which the final strength and solidity of the whole structure depends. It has been found by experience that the twist of the legs of the tripod, consequent upon the sun's action, has, at times, been very great, amounting in some extreme cases to a difference of three minutes in readings upon the same signal a. m. and p. m. But the torsion did not commence a. m. until the morning observations were over, and usually the full effect of the sun's action had taken place before the p. m. observations began. The afternoon readings upon the same signal were usually less than in the morning, showing that the twist was in the direction of the sun's apparent motion. In order to correct for any uniform motion while making observations, it has been my practice to begin observing a series from left to right, with the reference-point observed in the middle of the series; tllen reversing tlle telescope, observing from right to left in the same order. If the times of observation are about equal and the tripod carrying the instrument is steadily moving in either direction, then the mean differences of reading between the reference-mark and signal observed will be unaffected by the tripod's motion. The principle of construction aimed at has been to obtain a maximum of strength and solidity with a minimum of surface exposed to the action of the winds. C. 0.

ON THE SECULAR VARIATION OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN THE CKI'l'ED STATES AKD AT SOME }'OREIGK STATIONS.
Hy CHARLES A. SCHOT'.I', ARsistant Coast and Geodetic Survey.

[F,µ"tb. editiou, November, 1882. "]

The present investigation incorporates many additional observations made and results collected since Ju11e, 1881 (date of the last edition), and contains the extended and improved results of old stations as well as those for a m1mber of new localities, several of which are in Alaska; comprising altogether 82 stations with about 837 results. The geographical range of the discussion includes stations irregularly distributed over the whole of the United States, a station in Europe, a station in Brazil, two on the Sandwich Islands, and one in Asiatic Russia. The demand for the cont.ents of this article bas been constantly on the increase, not only by scientists and surveyors, but also by lawyers, the latter demands arising chiefiy from cases of disputed laud boundaries, which originally had been run by compass and are now required t-0 be retraced. To render this i1ffestigation more useful to practical men, I have thought it desirable to preface it b;y a brief account of the various and principal motions, s,ystematic and irregular, to which the direction of the magnetic needle is subject, and thus clearly to separate and distinguish these changes from the secular variation, which alone is here the special object of treatment. Theoreticall;y, a knowledge of the secular variation is of great importance, and practically, is indispensable iu order that the coast charts published by this office may be supplied with the variation . of t.J.ie compass for the date of issue. The magnetic declination (or rnriation of the compass, as it was formerly called by surveyors and still is by 11avigators), at an,y place, is the angle contained between two vertical planes, one being the astronomical or true meridiai1, and the other a plane in which the horizontal axis of a freely suspended magnet, lies at the time. The former plane is fixed and th!'l latter variable, since it is found that the needle is in a state of a small continual motion. The magnetic declination varies with respect to space ancl time; it is, therefore, necessary to give with the statement of its measure the exact time (.year, day and hour) when an observation was made, as well as the geographical position of the place (the latitude aud longitude to the nearest minute of arc will suffice). The declination is called ''west" when the north end of the magnet points to the west of true north; algebraicall;y this fact is indicated by a -f sig-n, and if "ea~t" by a - sign. It is a matter of observation that the magnet, when light and delicatel;y suspended (by a singfe fiber of raw silk) is seldom or never at rest, but is always shifting its direction, or is in a state of oscillation or of tremor, or it may be of sudden changes. These angular .motions have been classified as regular
·This article originally appeared iu Coast Survey Report for 1859, Appendix No. 24, pp. 296-305. In the second edition, in Coast SurverReport for 18741 Appendix No. 8, 11p. 7'..l-108, the investigation appears greatly extended; the substitution of a sine for a cosine function was made and the epoch was chanl{ed from 1830to1850; also some use was ma.de of C1mchy's method of interpolation for the establlshment of some seeond periodic terms. The third edition· issued in June, 1879, appeared in pamphlet form, and is not.contained in any annual report of the Co'&st and Geodetic Survey. .The geographical range oft.he investigati-On was much enlarged, and the paper was illustrated by two plates. The next or fourth edition wrui bro1lght out in June, 1881, and fonns Appendix No. 9, Coast and Geodetic Survey R6 port for 1879, then p-iug through the press; it was illnstnted with three plates. ·

UNITED STATES OOAST AND GEO:PETIC SURVEY.

(periodic) and irregular rariations, and of' these we pro1>0se t-0 notice briefly the J>rincipal ones, such as may generally be exhibited within the limits of the United States. The solm·-diurnal ·ariation consists in a systematic movement of the magnet, having for its period the solar day. Its character is the same for the greater part of .the northern liemisphere, viz, about the time of sunrise the north end of the needle is generally found approaching to or near its most easterly deflection from the aYerage magnetic meridian. This phase happens, for instance, at Philadelphia, on the yearly arnrage, about 7.p a. m.; at Key West, Fla., about 8lh a. m.; and the same at Madison, Wis. lt is subject to an annual variation, being about ~ of an hour later in the months when the sun is south of the equator, and about ~of au hour earlier in the summer mouths than its yearly average epoch. The north end of the needle then begins its principal daily motion, and reaches the opposite extreme position, or its western elongation, about llalf past 1 o'clock p. m. · It is reached a few minutes earlier in summer and a few minutes later in winter, and hardly 'raries half an llour for different localities. After tllis epocll the needle takes up an easterly moYementand gradually returns nearly to the direction from which it set out in the morning. Frequently an interru1Jtiou, or small reversed motion, is exhibited during the night. At Philadelphia the average daily (lirection h; reached in summer about lOih a. m. and in winter about lO~h a. m., and generally within half au hour of these times at other places. ·Tlle mag110tic meridian is crossed a second time, generally between 7 and 9 p. m. Tlle angular range between· the morning and afternoon elongations, or tlle diurnal range, is about 8' on tlle aYerage at Philadelphia and about 5Jt' at Key West; in higher magnetic latitudes more, ill lower less. This range is subject to an annual ill'equalitr, being much more conspicuous in summer than in wiuter (lOrr' at Philadelpbia in AuguRt and 6' in November). It is further subject to a Jleriodic inequality related to the eleven-year cycle of the sun-spots. It is least in years of minimum sun-spots (as in 1878, for iustance) and greatest in years of maximum sun spots (as in 1870) the factors being 0.7 and 1.3, about, of the average amou11t of tli.ese years respective]_}'. This daily variation Hppears at times intensified, at other times enfeebled, and during the winter months there are occasionally days on which it cannot be recognized. Obsenations must be corrected for time"of day in order to reduce the result to the a\·erage direction of the twenty-four hours; a table girnn for this pur1)0se is found in Coast and Geodetic Survey Heport for 1881, Appe.ndix No. 8, Art. 6. The nnnual vari<ttion of the declination is so small that a mere me.ntion of its existence sutlices; its amplitude is at most lt minutes of are. The lunar inequalities: These we likewise pass oYer ou account of their small ampiitmle. The priucipal inequality is tbe h.JJtar diurnal variatiou exhihiting the peculiarity of tlrn maxima and two minima on each lunar da~'· The range of this inequality at I'hilauelphia is about 27", aud at Toronto, Cauada, abont 38". Other lunar inequalities are of Jet smaller order. 'l'hc secular i'arfotion of the magnetic declination, our subject proper, is most probably al~o of a periodic character, but 8ince it requires centuries for its full development, and since, as yet, no one cycle has actually been completed within the rauge of obserYatiou, we are obliged, iu the absence of any reliable theory, to follow up the phenomena by continuous obserYatious. Thus from time to time our previous deductions or supposed laws need changing or amending in order t-0 }lreserve the required harmonious relations wit.h facts. The secular motion may be compared with a waYe motion or with au oscillation of a pendulum which comes to rest momeutarily at its extreme 1>0sitious O! elongations and mo\'CS fastest midway between these extremes. Smaller variations within this periorl have also beeu detected, but the general angular movement (say of the north end) of the magnet may be described as followR: About the times of maximum deflection the magnet appears almost stationary or only slowly oscillating about the same average directiou (to ordinary or rough instruments) for several years; soon, however, the effect of the secular change becomes perceptible, increasing gradually, year by year; the progressive angular motion soou reaches an annual maximum value, after which, still moving in the same direction, itslowlydiminishes, beeomiug staponary at the opposite extreme digression and possibly retuming again to its :first positio,u. Within tµe area of the United States and south of latitude 490 a complete oscillation of this kind may require between two and a half and three aud a half centuries, during which time the magnet would swing twice, once forward and once backward, through au are of several degrees, generally keeping within tlJ,e limits of 3° an~ 70 of total range for our geographieal

boumlaries; in other localities tbe period and range are Yery much greater. 'l'he remarkable regularity of the motion is well shown on the accompanying diagram for Paris, France, for which })lace we probably possess the longest series of obserrntions; the p~iod is about four aud two-thirds centuries, and the range uearly ~-iso. To illustrate further tJ;ie eJl'ect of tlie secular change, we may take the case of New York Cit,r. In this localit,y.the needle was observed to be iu nearly a stationary condition about 1685, its north end pointing then 90 to the west of north; it then mornd easterly and reached jts easternmost digression about 1797, showing at that time only 4° west declination. Ever since this epoch the motion has been westerly, its present Yalue being rn~arl~- so W.; the greatest annual change (nearly 5') has apparently been passed. Tim times of tliese stationary epochs are diflerent at different localities; the last epoch was noted earliest in l\faine, later ~n Florida and Texas, and bas not yet been reached in California. At present, all along our Atlantic and Gulf coasts and over the middle and eastern parts of the United States, the efiect of the secular change is to increase west declination, or (wbat is the same) to decrease east declination; but on tbe Pacific coast aud for some distance interior the effect is opposite, viz, au increa1>e of east tleclination. Alaska, howeYer, is t-0 be excepted; there easterlj- declination seems to decrease slowlj-. There must, consequently, be a region of no present change, which will be reforred to in detail further on. It is this regular motion, known as the secular Ytir.iation, which renders it ncceo;sary to reconstrnct from time to time our isogouic cliarts. Although this secular variation is perfectly systematic it may not always appear so, especially wheu deduced from few obserYations made at different stations in the same general locality, either on account of small observing errors and possible local deflections, or for tlte reason that ordinary periotlic variations and disturbances have not been fully eliminatei:l . .Among the latter must he classed theMagnetic dist1trbances.-These may occur at any time, and are, when taken individually, lJeyond the power of prediction; but attacked by the statistical mctliod, i. when classified and av\'ragPs are taken of many tLons·1mls, they are found to be sul~je.ct to Yarious htw-s. Their pre.;;ence is generall~- indicated by sudden deftectio11s, arnl hj- rapid aml great fluctuations in the direction of the needle as compared with its i101-mal position, which otherwise might have been expected. They often take place simultaneously at distant regions of the globe, and in duration may be confined to a few hours, or they may last ~ d<ty or even for several days. They are frequentl;y accompanied by auroral lights and b~· strong electric eartll-currents. When .analyzed in large numbers tlrny exhibit a so~ar-diurnal variation, the westerly and easterly disturbances, however, following different laws. They also ha,-e an annual Yariation and seem to depend largely on the sun-spot period or an eleven-year cycle. Irrespect.ive of direction of the disturbing forces the most disturbed hours of the day are genera,lly those between 7" and 10" a. m., and t.he least disturbed those between 2 and 6· p. m. Westerly disturbances occur most frequently abouts· a. m. and least about 8" p. m; they exhibit a single daily progression. Easterly disturbances reach a maximum about 8" p. m, and a minimum about 2" p. m.; they exhibit a double daily progression. Wester}~- and easterly disturbances appear to agree their annual variation, in their· times of maxima, i. in August, September, and Oct-0ber, and in their times of minima, i. e., in Januar~- and June. The disturbances are most frequent and considerable in years of maximum suu·spot act.ivit.y and the reverse in years of minimum sun-spots. The following table of the obsen·ed dist nrbances, in a bi-hourly series at Philadelphia in the years 1840 to 1845, will give au idea of their relatiYe frequency and magnitude:

HISTORICAL NOTE.

The following brief historical remarks on the magnetic declination and its secular variation have been prepared from extracts f1'om Humboldt's Cosmos (Otte's translation, Lot1don, 1849-1858), vols. II and V; frt>m the Enc;rclopIBdia Britannica, 9th edition, Art. Compass, vol. VI (Boston, 1877), and from E. Walker's tr.eatise "Terrestrial and Cosmical Magnetism," Cambridge (England), 1866, in which works fuller references will be found. The Enc~·clopoodia of Experimental Philosophy, London, 18i8, Art. Magnetism, as well as Gehler's Ph,ysikalishes Wi5rterbuch, Leipz.ig, 1825, Art. Compass, were also consulted. The first notice of the magnetic needle as applied to nayigation we meet with among western (European) nations does not date further back than the elerenth or twelfth century of our era, but in China the directive property of the magnetic needle was made use of on land as early as the twelfth century B. 0., and, according to tradition, e\re11 at a very much earlier time (2634 B. C.) In the third and fourth centuries of our era Chinese vessels were guided by the magnetic needle, and through them a knowledge of the polarity of the needle was conveyed to India and thence westward. In the ninth century Ohiuese merchants traded in ships to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Probably through the influence of Arabian nadgators, or through the agency of the Crusaders, the use of the mariners' compass was introduced into Eastern Europe. Among the first. European writers of the middle ages who refer to the loadstone br to the compas8 is the Icelandic historian, Are Frode, who lived about the end of the elew·nth century. He states that the directive property of the loadstone was then known to seamen in northern countries. Next are mentioned, Alexander Neckam, in two treatises, "De Uteusilibus" and "De Naturis Rerum," of the twelfth century, Guyot, of Provins, iu 1190, and Jaques de Vitry, between 1204and1215. Raymond Lully, in 1272 and 1286, remarks that the seamen of his time emplo~·ed the magnetic needle, and from To1~freus we learn that the comJ)aBS was in use among the Norwegians about the middle of the thirteenth century. Among western nations the construction of the instrument underwent great impro,·ements, particular!~· by the hands of Flavio Gioja, of Amalphi, Italy, in 1302. The declfoation.-From a Chinese work, written between 1111 and 1117 A. D., we learn that the needle was then suspended by a thread and that the mode of measuring the amount of the decli· nation, it being then west (or, as there expressed, east of south), had long been underst-OO(l. It can hardly be supposed. that the fact of the needle, in general, not pointing to the true north and south coultl have been overlooked in the twelfth century, on the Mediterra)lean, in places where the declinatiou reached (io to 100. A pai;sage interpolated iu a Paris MS., a copy of "Epistola Petri Peregrini,'' &c., of 1209, states the declination to have been determined by him in Italy at 50 E. Columbus probably was the first who records the change in the sigfl of declination with change of position. On starting from the west coast of Spain he had east declination. In September, 1492, in the Atlantic, in latitude 2so longitude 280 (about) he observed 11 o W. He has also the merit of heing the first to discover a part of an agonic line, or line of no declination. The first scientific work in Europe in which the declination is treated at any length aud dedutied from actual observations is that by Boroughs, published in 1581, entitled "A Discourse on the Variation of the Cumpas or 1\Iagneticall Needle," and is dedicated to the "travaillers and mariners of England." In 1599, Prince Maurice, of Nassau, the lord high admiral of the Low Countries, recom· mended seamen to keep a register of the declination in every part of the world they might visit. Isogonic charts. -The declination was marked on the chart of Andrea Bianco, drawn up in the year 14:36, and Alonso de Santa Cruz, in 1530, constructed the .first general declination chart, though basc{l upon yery imperfect material. Upon the chart by Father Christopher Burrus (died in 1632), published at Lisbon, the lines are called "tractus chalyboeliticos." About 170 years after Alonso de Santa Cruz, Edm. Halley published his celebrated isogonic cLart for the year 1700, based entirely upon observations. [Tabula Nautica, Variationum Magneticarum Index, juxta observationes anno 1700.J His voyages of the years 1698, 1699 and 1702 were undertaken at the expense of the British Government. This chart comprises the areas of the North and South Atlantic, the Indian, and the extreme western part of the Pacific Ocean. Isogonic charts became quite numerous after Halley's time. Those by Hansteen (Magnetismus der Erde, 1819) deserve special mention; his earliest one is for the year 1600. In 1838 Gauss published his ''General theory

of Terrestrial Magnetism" (in Resultate, etc., des .Magnetischen Vereins) ancl, the resulting isomagnetic curves were afterwards charted. A translation of the theory and the charts are given in Taylor's Scientific Memoirs, Vol. II, London, 1841. In the work of A. Erman arnl H. Petersen, "The Foundation of the Gaussian theory and the phenomena of Terrestrial ::\fagnetism in the year 1829," Berlin, 1874, the general distribution of magnetism over the globe is shown on six cbart8 for the-epoch 1829. For the most complete magnetic chart8 depending directly on observations, the reader is referred to General Sir Edwarcl Sabine's Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism, Nos. XI, XIII, XIV and XV, Phil. Trans. no;v. Soc., for the years 1868, 1872, 1875 ancl 1877, respectively. These charts refer to the epoch 1840 to 1845. Isogonic charts for the Unit-0cl States of North America, in three sheets, Nos. 37, 38, 3fl aud rl·ducecl to the e1>och 188li.O, will ·lie found in this report (see Appendix No. 13.) The secular variation of the ileclinatioii.-The discovery of tlte gradual clmng·e of the declination, which for any one place had predously been suppm;ed constant by philosophers, is due to Gellibrand, of Gresham College, England. In 1635 lte published his work, entitlell '"A discourse mathemati· call on the Variation of the Magneticall Needle, together with its allmirable diminution lately discovered." Ile based his conclusions upon the recorded obserrntious of Boroughs (1580), of Gunter (1622), and his own obserrntions (1633-34), showing that in the vicinity of Lonclon the direction of the needle. had changed in the interval fully 7° to the westwar(l. From this time the fact of the secular variatfon was completely established, and it remained to later times to determine its extent arHl develop the law governing this change, and to endearnr to find its cause. That the velocity was not uniform was soon perceivecl, and the appareut periotlic character of the variation was 11romi11ently forced upon the attention of observers when the needle reached a stationary condition, as, for instance, in the eastern part of the United States towards tile encl of the eighteenth century, and then recommenced its motion in a direction opposite to tl·at it ba<l before. Similarly at Paris, France, the secular change was westward between the stationary epochs of 1580 (about) and 1814 (about), sinee which time the needle has been retracing its cour8e eastwardl.r. Nearly mid way between such stationary epochs the annual change is obseffed to be a maximum. See Plate No. 36, upper diagram.
ANALYTICAL EXPRESSION OF 'fHE SECULAR VARIATION OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION.

The secular variation can be represented with co11jliderable accuracy by means of a circular or ha;rmouic function, as might be expected from the almost unlimite1l adaptation of such functions to all forms of periodically recurring phenomena, provided a sufficient number of terms are introduced. The formula employed for our purpose may be writtenD = o + r sin (am+c) + r, sin (a,m + c,) + r 11 sin (a 11 m + c11 ) + ....... . ~Where D =magnetic declination at any time t, positive when west, ·negative when east. m = number of years and fractions of a year from an epoch to for which 1850 ha.s been atloptfld ; hence m = t- 1850.00 a a, a 11 · · · · · are factors ·depemling ou the adopted periods p p, p 11 · of the severa terms ; so that a = - P

In these cases the conditional equations were 111nltipliet1 by the square root of their re.'lpcctive weight. Of observations evidently grossly in error no notice whatever was taken.

The greater part of this apparent probable error is due to the fact that the observations collected at any one place were not generally made at precisely the same spot, thus admitting the effect of possible local irregularities in the distribution of magnetism in addition to the ordinary obsen'ing errors. In other cast's the observations evidently were not corrected for diurnal variation, and the hour of the day of observation not being known, the received imperfect value had to be accepted. · · · Thet:e arc some stations where from want of a sufficient number of observations, or from short· ness of inten·al between the first and last observation, no periQd of the secular va.ria.tion could be 111acle out.

In case the change of declination can be represented by a straight line, we have n =do+ a, (t-t0 ) and the conditional equation 0 = d0 - D +a (t- t0 ) where d0 =mean of all observed declinations and to= mean of corresponding times. The principal uncertainty in the investigation thus arit>es partly from large ohserviug or instrumental errors iu the older obseryatious macle with orclinary compasses or with rude instruments generally, and partly, in modern observations, since tlie introduction of more refined instruments (the magnetometer with collimator magnet and theodolite) from change of local position and imperfect eliminatiou of irregular variations from the normal direction of the magnet. From the extended use of iron and the rapid growth of cities, it is difficult to select and preserve at such places a suitable locality for use at fotnre times. Accurate investigations of the secular variation t\an onls be made at permanent magnetic obsen'atories or in localities not liithle to disturbing influences. In applying at present a periodic functi011 for representing the secnlar niriatiou, it should be understood that this does not necessar'ily imply that the phenomenon is a periodic one, or has a period of the length assigned, or that it must exhibit a second or more periods of like character to the first, or even that a first period will be completed without change of law.· The aim is simply to repre8ent b;v a suitable and comprehensiveiormula the changes which are observed in the direction of the resultant horizontal magnetic force from year to year and during centuries, and to provide the means for the further study of the phenomenon as well as for predicting, at least for a few years in advance, the probable direction of the needle as required for use on our hydrographic charts. The procesH is thus one of a tentative character and the forrnulm are empirical. Employing a formula of interpolation capable of represimtiug the phenomenon as far as observed, it would manifestly be unsafe to extend the numerical results much beyond the limits of observation. They are here given within proper and safe limits and should not be transcernled unless it should be found that, the results are sustained by additional observations.
COLLECTION OF MAGNETIC DECLINATIONS FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE SECULA.lt VARIATION.

The collection of the material is presented first, the stations being arrau~ed in approximately geograpl1ical order, beginning in the northeast, passing to the south and west and ending in the northwest. This approximates to an arrangement proceeding from the greatest westeru to the greatest eastern declination. For each locality the obsen·ed declinations are giYen in chronological order, together witb such notes and references respecting observer, place, publication, &c., as could be supplied. The stations here given are the only oues, as far as known, at present suitable for a discust>iou of the secular variation, but it is expected that future accumulation a.nd collection of data will render the character of the work more comprehensive and reliable thau it can now be made.
*If we suppose for the moment that the secula.r variation consists simply uf a swing about a ruean position, the deflecting force being a maximum at the timeH of lllongn.tion and zero for the epoch midway between, we may obtain some rough evaluation of the magnitude of the horizontal deflecting force when greatest. Thus, at Philauelphia the half-amplitude or the secular deflection either way from the normal equals nearly 3°.3 and the last extreme 33 1 de1lsc.rnn .- happened about 1807. At that time, . then, the detlect.iug force conesponclecl to 57·. 3 = 17 nearly of t h e norms1 horizontal force acting in the plane of the meridian. This deflecting force is vi>ry much greater t.han the detlecting force which produces the daily solar variation, the latter bsing at most, at Philailelphia, for an average amplitude of . 81·0 eqn al to 4.0· = 1 nearly of ths llllille normal hm-J.SOntal force. 3437 7

·For the collection and communication of the observed values, Nos. 2 to xo, a.t Halifax, Nova Scotia, the Coast and Geodetic Survey is indebted to Staff-Commander Fred. John Evans, R. :N. (Hydrographer to the Admiralty). Letters dated January 5, 1866, and April 26, 1867. According to Champlain's observations in this region, the declination at Halifax would appear to have been about 16f 0 west for l6o4 to 161a. Our formula gives 19° west. Champlain's observations are not certain within ± 4 or s0 ·

The declinations between 1717 and r843 inclusive are given by M. B. Lockwood, civil engineer, and are not stated to be from actual obsen·ations or from recorded bearings of a number of permanent objects. Sill. Jour., vol. xlhr, 18.13. There can be no doubt that this table, like the \Vinthrop table for Boston and that of Hatboro'~ Pa., depends in part on interpolation. It is well graduated and unquestionably r<sts on reliable observations. The values marked 11 not used'' are those which I suppose : to be ioterpolations.-Sw.

COLLECTION OF RESULTS AT SECONDARY STATIONS.

The following collection of declinations comprises all stations at which the results of observation could not be as 11atisfactorily discussed as for the preceding stations. The defect arising either from actual paucity of available material or from shortnet1s of elapsed time between the extreme epochs covered by the observations. The declinations at the greater number of these stations, however, have been discussed by application of an exponential function iu the place of the former circular function. For a few stations a collection of data. only is given, but they will _be worked up whenever they become sufficiently complete to warrant the attempt.

ANALY'l'ICAL EXPRESSIONS OF THE OBSERVED DECLINATIONS.

The resulting empirical expressions for the secula1· variation of the magnetic declination, given in Table I, were derived from the preceding results of observation at the principal stations by applying to them the harmonic analysis, as explained in the preface. 'l'he stations are arranged geographically as far as.practicable, and their positions are gi\·en by latitu<le and longitude (west of Greenwich). Total number of stations 641 aml of obserrntions about 750. The epoch to which the formuloo refer is 18501 January 1, or m = t-1850.0 Table I (b) contains the results for subordinate stations, which necessarily cover a more restricted area, they depend upon an exponential function. Number of stations discussed 181 with an aggregate nnmber of observations equal to 87. S. EL 77--33

· Ha\·ing come into possession of two recent values of the declination at Paris and rediscussingthc series 1 which now extends over 338 years, two new features in the secular motion of the magnet were noticed, which possibly may be of Importance in the ultimate explanation of the phenomenon, and which demanded a more complicated formula for its representation than that given in the general table above. After computing the principal periodtc term, viz, the residuals between the computed and observed valnes showed the existence of a secondary wave, superposed upon the primary, llaving one if not two characteristics, 'Viz, a variability in the paratneter, that is, the seconda.ry wave becoming smaller in height since a.bout 15+0, and apparently a rnriability in the lengtli of its period; that is, the period of the superpo!ICd secondary wave was nearly constant in the second half of the sixteenth and throughout the seventeenth centnries, but afterwards diminished rapidly. Both variations are undoubtedly periodic, though from want of sufficient data tor the pre.,,nt I preferred a limited diminution of the period. These features are shown on the accompanying diagram, Plate No. 36, lower figure, which exhibits the observed o.nd computed values; but it will be noticed that there may be a doubt whether one or two waves lie between 11-10 and 1870,_ o.nd since the supposed diminution of the period hinges upon th!·, I prefer to give two expTessions for the declination, \·iz, that given in the table above, giving one crest, and the other giving two crests during that period; they are: D, == 6°.479 + 16'.oo. sin (o.765m n8° 46' .5) (0.7 + 0.4 sin (o.69m 276' .6)) sin (3.93"' + ·47') ,.

The results of the second furmula are sbown on tM diagnam, and the differences observed-computed values; are given la Table II tor Paris, headed 0-C, and O-C,,. I sll&lf lellveit to future observations to decide which or the hypotheses is the better one. t Approximate e.xpreulon.

UNITED ST.ATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

To facilit.at.e the comR&rison of the resolta at widely different localities there bas been added to this paper a plate, No. 33, headed "Secular variation of the magnetic declinatfon." It exhibits the observed and oompoted ·declinations for New York, Baltimore, San Francisco and Sitka. On plate No. 36, Paris, France and on plate No. 33, New York and Baltimore have been introcluced for the special purpose of showing in a OOnRpicuons manner the great regularity of the secular motion, and tbm; impressing the mind with the fact that the txplanation of the secular change must ultimately be referred to forces of a periodic character acting, for centuries, with great regularity and over vast areas. 8o fa.r no approach has yet been made towards the discovery of the cause of this variation. The diagrams also assist in connecting the phases of the secular variation as exhibited for pla.oos in the Unitetl States with the corresponding phases of the motion in Western Europe and Eastern Asia. The following Ta.hie III shows for each station: (l) the number of observations used in the di8Cnssion of the secular variation; (2) the apparent probable error, in minutes of arc, of one observation (including all sources of error, namtlly, those caused by imperfect value of the average declination due to diurnal variation and clisturbanees of the needle, those caused by difference of location of station, those arising from purely instrumental defects and those due to imperfectio11 of formula.); (3) the computed epoch of greatest easterly deflection reached in the secular mot.ion, i.e., the date when last reached or the date (in parentheses) when it is next expected to be in that position; (4) the amount, in degrees and fractions, and direction (+west, -east) at this the nearest stationary epoch; (5) (6) and (7) the computed annual changes for the epochs 1870, 1880 and 1885, expressed in minutes of arc, a+ sign indicating north end of needle moving west· ward, a - sign uorth end moving eastward. Table III (b) contains similar information for the secondary stations.

The actual ~umber of observations at Hatborough, Pa., is unknown and probably is less than one-third of the values used in the discussion. The probable errors given will serve to convey some idea of the .relative value of each series of observations. The imperfections in the instrumental means and methods of the older observations in many cases react unfavorably on the modern observations, which are made with more precise instruments and by more refined methods. If we take, for instance, the observations of Hudson, made iu 1609, in the vicinity of New York, we find each fairly chargeable with a probable error of about ± 40. While these observations are very imperfect, those of Champlain of about the same period (1604 to 1612) are still crud6r. Theee two navigators differ nearly 9° at the mouth of the Penobscot, Maine and double this amount at Cape Cod. The observations made by Vancouver on our western coast, between 179~ aod 1794, are subject to a probable uncertainty of ± 10 (each), and even now it requires favorable cirowastances to determine the variation of the compass at sea with a probable error of half a. degree or to make sure of the nearest whole deg1·ee. Increased precision was attained with the improvement of the azimuth compass and by allowance for disturbing effect of the ship's iron, and, with respect to shore stations, greater accuracy was obtained by the introduction of the thoodolite for determining the astronomical meridian. With a portable magnetometer and a collimator magnet, the instrumental means need not introduce a greater uncertainty than about one minute; bat the actual probable error of any determination is dependent also on the accidental variations in the mean direction of the magnetic force from day to day, thus ma.king it desirable and indispensable for precise work to continue the observations for three or more days and to correct the results for diurnal Va.nation. The amount of the probable error of the observed lleclination dePends also on the intensity of the· horizontal component of the magnetic force at the place, i. in general tile smaller the horizontal force the larger the apparent probable error. To facilitate the use of the deduced annual change for the purpose of bringing reault.1 up to date, and in order that a more comprehensive general view of its distribution in sip and amount ma)' be had, the valnea of the Jast column of Tables III and III (b) were laid down on .the~· panyiDg chart (Plate No. 34:) ~g the title "Annual cba.nge of the ma.gnetic deeliaatian." °U

will be seen that the annual change has the positive sign for by far the greater part of the United States, but in a region about Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, in the extreme northeast, and in a region including parts of Washington Territory, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona and Mexico, and passing into the Pacific south of Lower California in the extreme southwest, we meet with two smaller areas of negative sign. The boundaries between these two areas of negative annual change with the intermediate area of positive annual change form two broad belts where the needle is at present in a stationary condition. The outlines of these belts cannot now be exactly defined, nor has it been found, as yet, practicable to construct a system of curves of equal ann1tal change (such as was attempted for a limited area in Coast Survey Repo1·t for 1865, plat.e No. 28). The maximum amount of annual change, as charted and within the United States, appears to be in Vermont and Michigan; it is, however, surpassed in the Territ-Ory of Alaska, where the annual change is ·likewise positive. The present motion of the fsogonic curves is southward along our Atlantic and Pacific seaboards, but slowly north-easlierly in the greater part of Ala.ska; an intermediate region of no annual change passing through the Strait of Fuca. On the chart thtire are also presented two agonic lines (or line11 of zero declination, the magnetic needle pointing due north), one for the epoch of 1790, when it and the corresponding syl'ltem of isogonic lines in its neighborhood had reached nearly their extreme positions t-0 the northeast; the other for the epooh 1885; the space between them showing tbe shifting to the southwest of the first-named agonic line during the last 95 years. The agonic · line is now in rapid motion to the sout.h and west, carrying with it the correspomlin~ system of other isogonic lines in it8 vicinity. A cursory examination of column 4 of Table III and column 3 of Table III (b) containing the epoch of the greatest easterly digression, at which time the deflecting force producing tlie secular change had an easterly maximum, shows that in Western Europe (Paris) this phase of the secular motion occurred about 1581; but near the coast of the New En~land States the needle became stationary .in direction and then reversed its previous angular motion at a very much later epoch, viz, about 1760 to 1780. Going westward. or southward, this epooh was observed later, about 1800, iu Illinois and Missouri, and about 1810 in Florida. It occurred as late as 1830 (about) in Mi&sissippi, and in 1839 (about) in the city of Mexico, and at San Blas, Mex., about 1868. The needle has not yet reached this state in Lower California and along our western coast as far north as the Strait of .Fuca. This stationary condition may be expected in our weistern coast States south of the Columbia River toward the close of the present or early in the next century. At Sitka the maximum east dooliua.tion occurred in 1865, and fa.rther to the westward and northward, in the vicinity of the Kenay Peninsula, about 20 years earlier. We are thus directed t-0 look to the extreme northeastern limit of the United States for probable indications of the magnetic change, which may be expected to follow and spread &om the ea.st.ern boundary of Maine ;westward and southward, and we may also expect that the area of western coast Stat.es and Territories now having still slowly increasing easterly declination will a.ft.er the lapse of about a quarter of a century, change into an area of slow decrease; in othe;. words, the belt of present stationary needle will have moved westward a~d reached the Paci.fie. Respecting this secular variation the phases of the phenomenon to the northeast of Maine and in the region including Arizona, Nevada, and Idaho, a.re almost in oppQSition. At the time when the needle t-Ook up its westerly motion in our Northeastern States in the last quai·ter of the past· Century, it bad probably not for a very long time acquired its easterly motion in the States of the western coast. At present, in Nova ScOtia, the motion appears to be approaching its westerly extreme whereas in Oa.lifornia it is t.ending toward it.s easterly extreme. If we fix now for a moment our attention to the western extreme of stationary condition, which happened at PariB about 1814, or 68 years a.go, we find that at Saint John's, Newfoundland, the needle had arrived at this phase about 18671 and at Halifax, Nova Scotia, we are led to expect it to ooonr shortly (about 1891). In the State Of Maine, and farther on to the west and south, this Phase is expected to ooour aome time·eariy in the next century. We thus trace the progressive motion of the secular change from eastern ro western countries, and if we were ro compare it with a. wave Dletion, the present atationary conditions in the north.ea.st and in the we.st, or Rooky

270

UNITED ST.ATES COAST AND G:BODETIC sunVEY.

Mountain region, would correspond to opposite phases, one a crest, the other a trough, with the
space between representing half a wave Jength. Supposing the needle deflected by the horizontal component of an electric current traversing

the earth's crm1t, the secular variation could be explained by a swaying motion in the direction of the current, the needle always tending to place itself at right angles thereto. The deflecting force8 are maxima over the two regions where the annual change in the direction of the needle has vanished. Looking over the numerical values of a in Table I, they would imply for srations in t11e United Stat.es a secular variation cycle varying between the limits of about 220 and 360 years; numben which are neces..imrily yet very uncertain. On plate No. 35 appended to this paper I have delineated the secularchange of the agonic line of the North Atlantic; to illustrate the effect of the corresponding change in the declination !n a manner quite dift'erent from that referring to tabular numbers. It shows the posit.ions of this a.gonic line for the epochs 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, also for .1880 and 1900. The earliest position is more or less conjectural and rests on the authority of Col nm bus for its place near the Middle Atlantic; we also know that it must have passed over a region near Paris, France, and not far from a sJ)ace including t.he Antilles. The-position for 1600 is taken from Hansteen's work (1819), and may be considered as a. rough approximation; it has been corrected by me near its western end. The positiorr for 1700 is more reliable, &inee it depends on numerouR obsen·ations collected by Halley; it is directly taken from his chart. The positions for 1800 and 1880 require no further explanation. The position for 1900~ though prospective, is quite certain. Upon the whole, the azimuthal motion of the isogonic system in the vicinity of the agonic line of the N ortb A tJantic, and as represented by this line, has boon, since 1600, in the direction of the liands of' a watch.
TABLES OF DECENNIAL VALUES OF THE MAGNETIP DECJLINA'l'ION COMPUTED FROM PRECEDING EQUATIONS.

Tables IV and IV (b) have been constructed for the purpose of facilitating the reduction of observed declinations from one epoch to another, a.nd for supplying the charts of the Coast and Geodetic Survey \Vith the latest computed tlecliuations. These values will be fouud especially useful when old lines, oi·iginaUy run by compass needle, have to be retraced· at a later date; besides they are useful, when put in a more extended form, in the construction of isogonic charts for given epochs. For the declination two places of decimals a.re given for all localities and dates for which the observations were considered reliable; one place of decimals indicates a less satisfactory result, and blanks indicate that no trustworthy results, or no results at all, could be had. The tabfo. should not be e.rte7uled either by inter1){)Iation or by extrapolation beyond its given limits, except when supported by further evidence or new observations. The declinations are given in degrees and dwima.ls, a + sign indicating west and a - sign east declination. The epoch is the ftl'lt day of the given year.

DI8TRIHUTION OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN THE UNITED STATES AT THE EPOCH JANUARY, 1885, WITH TIIHEE ISOGONlC CHARTS.
By CHARLES A. SCHO'L''l', A'"'·dstant.
[One plate.)

COMPUTING DIVISION, December 30, 188'...!. Of late years the magnetic work of the Sun·ey, both iu the field and iu the office, haviug been pushed forward very actively, as may be seen by the receut pnblicatiou of results, it appeared equally desirable to bring thiH new material in lo use at tl1e earliest practicable momeut. Of tl1e new resultH those of the declinatiou are the most important, Riuce l1y 111ea11s of tltt>m the eompasi,; cards are supplied for our sailing, coast, arn1 harbor charts, arnl it had latel;y become necessary to construct, provisionally, an isogollic cliart for the, epoch of 1880 iu onler t.hat the tll·sired accurac~' could be gh-en to t.he uantical data tlius furniBhed. By taking a short retrospect of what bas beeu done by the Surn'.Y iu this clirectioll, the progress made in our knowledge of tliis branch of terrestrial physics will become apparent. In consequence of the slow changes in the earth's magnetic conuition, and the gradnal accnnrnlatiou of uata, tlrn reconstruction from time to time of t;1hles of magnetic <lecliuatiou or of charts of equal magnetic declination (isogonic cliarts) becomes a necessity, autl co11seq1wlltl,Y publications will lm found iu several of our annual reports. The first table of results with an i~ogonic cltart was published by A. D. Bache aud .J.E. Hilgard ill the Re11ort for 1855, see Appendix N"o. 47 and Plate No. 56. 'l'he declinations were reduced to a common epoch, viz: 1850 by means of assumed va,lues of the annual change al](i for con renience of dilwussion the declinations were arranged in geographieal groups, which were separately treated hy application of Dr. Uoyd's interpolation formula.· The table comprises 15;3 stations, aml the curves computed for ead.1 whole degree coYer but a mt1Tow strip aloug the rnmst line. lu the following year the same authors producell a new chart, retaining, ho\H·\·e1·; the epocl1 1850; it, is the result of a more extended discmision, inclu<liug all recent observations (see Heport for 1851i, Appendix No. 28), and on the chart (Plate No. Gl) the isogonic CJlf\"CS fairl;y coyer the area of the Eastern States, as well as the area bordering 011 our Pacific 1.:oast, and the~· appear couuected uloug the line of the Mexican boundary. 'l'he curvt·s are compared with those re1mltiug from Gauss' general theory of terrestrial magnetism, published in 183l:l. The average epoch of the data used by Gauss is a.bout 1829, and the a11thors notice the accord in the form of the curves with those o\·er the same area and resting on obsen·ati.ous made up to 1850. lt is well known that in the, general theory Gauss used 2.t coefficients, depending on obsen·ations distributed over the greater part of the accessible surface of the globe, and including cleclinations, dips and intensities.

late attempt made by Erman and PeterRen (Berlin, 1874) to introduce into t.his theory additional material, and to reduce the same to the epoch 1829 by a strict account of the secular variation, has not resulted, to any marked degree, in a change in the curves as originally given by Gauss. Comparisons were also made with Barlow's chart, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., 1833 (Part II, p. 667, and following), and with Prof. E. Loomis' chart for 1840, Silliman's Journal Sc. and Arts, Vol. XL; the latter is the first detail chart extending some distance into the interior of the country. Lieut. Col. E. Sabine's chart for 1840, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., 1849 (Part II, p. 173, and following) shows the distribution of the declination over the Atlantic Ocean, and was of assistance in giving direc_ tion beyond the coast line to our currns, which depend exclusively on observations made on land. The Report for 1861, Appendices Nos. 23 and 24, contains two small isogonic charts (Plate No. 30); they were designed as aids to navigation, and refer to our Southern Atlantic and to our Gulf coast; epoch, 1860. . The Report for 1862, .Appendix No. 19, gives an account of a magnetic survey of the State of Pennsylvania, and on Plate No. 4 7 isomagnetic lines are laid down for the two epochs, 1842 and 1862. The next isogonic chart accompanies Appendix No. 19, Plate No. 27, of the Report for 1865; it is on a larger scale and covers about the same area as the chart of 1856, but embodies the results accumulated since that time and later data respecting the secular variation. The epoch is 1870, and it was constructed by the present writer. The latest chart, prior to the present, issued by the Survey is that of Plate No. 24, Report for 1876, .Appendix No. 21, hy J.E. Hilgard. This· chart, wllich refers to the epoch 1875, not; only embodies the results of the Snr,·ey up to 1877, but uses about 200 recent observations obtained under the auspices of the ~ational Academy of Sciences, and made under his immediate direction. Besides, a number of re.suits from Government surveys and from private sources were utilized, and for the reduction to tile epoch 1875 the researches containe·I in the third edition of my paper on the 11ecular change (187!1), the second edition of which appeared in the Report for 1874, .Appendix No. 8, were made use of. The isogonic curves are given for each degree of declination and they cover the whole area of the United States [excepting Alaska]. The size of the chart is very mnch larger than that of its precursor, and was demanded by the necessit~' of representing all the facts then known. The former curves were brought forward by the known seenlar change; and reconstructed hy a graphical process wllere new <lata had been obtained; thus giving the latest information at the date of publication. The chart exhibits, especially in the eastern and middle parts, certain slight irregularities in the form of the cun·es, which are due to local deflection or disturbed regions. For some years past, but particularly since July, 1878~ when the designation "Coast Survey' was changed to "Coast antl Geodetic Survey," I have incidentally collected and put on record all magnetic results eoming under my notice, comprising declinations, dips and intensities, no matter when takeu, but referring to the area of the United States or to the vicinity of its borders, tlrns in. eluding parts of Canada, British North America, the West Indies, Mexico and the region about Alaska. This collection, made UJI from all accessible sourC'es, comprises several thousand entries, and I propos~d to use a11 its declinatious suitable for the purpose, a.swell as the complete material from ob:;ervations by the Coast and Geodetic Survey,· for the Ilroduction of a new isogonic chart. The chart now presented and answering to the epoch 1885, January 1, difl:ers from the preceding charts b~' taking distinct notice of all local disturbances in the direction of the magnetic needle, and, so far as such regions could be recognized, by showing the extent and amount of the local deflections. Heretofore it had been customary to present through the familiar geometrical lines the distribution of magnetism as if it were regular, but the increased material at our command renuers it now possible and imperative to attempt the delineation of the actual distribntion. Such geometrical representation had even been regarded by some as the true representation of facts, whereas the curves are affected not only by irregularities quite local, but also by such as extend O\"'er many square degrees of surface. The former are difficult to distinguish from errors of observation, hut the latter can he recognized by the greater or less regularity of the curves when b·aversing the region, and by the concordant results of several observers, whose observations, made a.t different epochs, were reduced to 1885. There are also marked on the chart, by dots, a.11 p1aoos

of observation, and by refore11ce to the table, presently to be explained, it can at ouee be al'lcertained by whom and when any particular observation was umde. Preparatory to the production of the new clmrt, it became desirable to have reference t-0 three papers intimately connected with the subject, viz: First, a new e1lition (the third) of "Directions for measurement of terrestrial magnetism," in the Report for 11'81, Appendix No. 8; secondly, a new edition (the fifth) of "Secular variation of the magnetic declination in the United States," in the Report for 188~, Appendix No. 13; and thirdly, a papt·r eutitled "Collection of results for declination, dip, and intensity from observations made by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, between 1833 :rnd ,July, 1882, given in the Report for 11381, Appendix No. 9. The first of thef.le papers explains the method aml describes the instruments as used ou the Survey; the second paper contains the data aud results which enabled me to refer all observations to the common epoch of the chart; for this purpose Tables IV (a,) aud (b) of tliat paper were extended so as to give the decliuatious for every year. Each annual value was tl1en substracted from its corresponding value for 1885.0, and the new set of se.cular variat\on-tables thus formed possessed the gr<·at advantage of giving at once the 1eduction to epoch, and of permitting comparisons of this quantity for adjacent stations hy mere inspection; also of affording the mrnns of eas~' hiterpolation for geographical position relative to stations represented in the table. The third paper furnishes part of the material for the basis of the new chart.
'fABLES OF OBSERVED MAGNETIC DECLINATIONS AND CORRESPONDING VALUES REFERRED TO
EPOCH, .TANl'ARY,

1885.

Its contents are arranged according to States and Territories, aml there am generally two parts for each of these political subdivisions, ,-iz, the first composed entirely of Coast and Giiodetic Survey declinations and the second of declinations derived from all other sources. Only the latest observation is given at all places where there is more than one result, in order that the reduction to epoch may lie giYen with the greatest accuracy possible for the localit~'· The columns contain, in the m·dcr given, the foilowing information: The 11ame of the station; its latitude; its long·itude; the ~ime of observation; the declina· ion; tlie reduction to epoch; the result referred to 1885.0; the observer's name, and reference where record is found. The table was prepared by myself, with the exception of the columns headed t:::. D and D 1e85 · 01 which were filled up by Dr. J. G. Porter, of the Computing Division. The geographical positions are generally given 011 the authority of th.e observer, but they were corrected in all cases where means exifited for their improvement. In a number of instances the geographical positious had to be supplied, and there remain many results in the general collection wliich could not be transfer::eu to the table for want of this information, The date is ~xpressed in years and fractions of a ,Year; the declination is given in degrees and fractions of a degree, with the signs + when west and - when east. For Parts I (Coast and Geodetic Survey results) the columns for observer and reference are omitted, foll information being given in the third paper referred to above. The total number of stations co.1tained in the table is 2359, and with the exception of some stations for which proper reduction to epoch could not be had, and of others lying too far off the boundaries of the charts, their results were laid down on the base chart of the Survey, in two sheets, scale one ft ve-millionth, and those for Alaska were laid down on a chart of smaller scale suitable t-0 the comparatively sparse number of results in that Territory. For the plotting of the stations and the insertion of the numbers of column headed D 1885 I am indebted to Mr. A. Ziwet, of the Computing Division. The data being thus prepared, I constructed by a graphical 11rocess the isogouic curves for the eaBtern and western part of the United States-at first following up all irregularities, next reviewing the curves and straightening them out so far as seemed allowable iu consideration that the irregularity may have been the re ·ult of observing error, and was thus.only an apparent one, but there were also caseg where the deviations were of such evident local character o.nd circumscribed (say a few square miuutes) area that they could find no place on the chart. Whenever concurrent testimony clearly pointed out magnetically disturbed regions of considerable area (say a number of square degrees) I have traced th~m out and defined them by cllrves. Among the irregularities presented some may be due, at present, t;o undetected. 8ystematic errors of obser-

,·ation, or to imperfect k11owlet1gt· of tile secular variation; these, howevn, may easily lie recognized b,r menus of new obsen·ationR. In hrn localities in particular, where the hiogonic curves, its first !lrawn, appeared unusuall,r deflected, the results by other observers in the vicinity of these regions pointed to defects which were traced, iu one case, to an instrumental error in the nature of an index error affecting a series of stations of that season, and ·in th!\ other case to a defective reduction to epoch applied in a regfon whern data was ver.r imperfect; afrer correction, the curves assnme!l quite regular shapes. l\-Iuch difficulty was experienced in tracing out the lines on the Pacific coast ancl generally west of the 105th meridian; in this part of the country observations require to be greatly multiplie<1, and isome time mmit uecessarily elapse llefore the law of the annual changf\ can become better known. The minor irrei:ularities in the distribution of magnetism, as shown on tbe chart for the New England Stat,es, and for the State of Missouri, may be taken as fairly made out. Of the latter State an admirable special magnetic survey has been prosecnte(l through private enterprise· for some years, and is now nearly complete. Prominent among those who liave made local magnetic disturbances a special Btudy were Dr. ,Jolm Locke, in this eonntrj', and the late Dr. Lamont, iu Germany. Iu the spring and summer of 1844, Dr. Locke examined experimentally into the local distribution of magnetism about the Palisade!', N. J ., and presented his results by diagrams of isoclini.c and isodynami.c curves.t Dr. Lamont, in a work entitled "l{esearches of the direction aud iutewiity of terrestrial magnetism in Northern Germany, Belgium, Hollaud, aud Denmark, executed by Dr. J. Lamont, in the summer of the year 1858 (Munich, 18;39), gfres expressions of the effect of a given disturbance on the direction and intcusits experienced by a magnetic needle, and gives diagrams of the consequent deformation prodnced in the isogonic, the isocliuie, and the isodynamic curves over the perturbed region. Since the8e formnlre do not appear to be so well known as their importance deserves, and on account of their instructi ,.e application to the iso magnetic curves, I give here a free translation of part of contents of page 21 of the preface: · Sn1Jrwse a magnetic south pole of intensity P vertically below the point A on the earth's surface, and at a depth equal to unity, and it be required to determine its effect upon the magnetism at a second point, B, on the surface clistant, from A equal tor and in azimuth ¢reckoned from magnetic north round b~' west., then the effect of the pole P at the point B will l>e in declination

Dr. Lamont shows that the curves of horizontal intensity to the mt1gneti.c north and south of the center of disturbance are bent inwards or toward it, and that the curves of equal decliuatiou to the east and west of the disturbance are bent outwards or away from it, whereas the curves of equal dip are bent southward, dir01.itly over the point of diRtnrbance,

as well as to the north of it, also up to a certain distance to the south of it. Supposing the isomagnetic cun·es over a distur})ed region ginm })y obserrntiou, the position of the point on the surface vertically aborn the poiut of disturba,nce, that is it,; latitude and longitude, may be found from the distnrl>ed declination and intenbity curves, and the dp,J)th of the point of disturlmuce from the dip currns, the iuteusity of the disturbance being determined b,Y the amount of hending of.the curves. After commenting ou the highly instrnctive nature of the application of the forllluhe when throwu into curves, he remarks: "It is, however, not to be imagined that the irregularities in the magnetic curves are produced by a 11iugle pole of disturbance, such as has been supposc<l ab1we, but rather b_:1· a series of such poles forming peaks or ridges of disturbance." In fact the distribution in spaqe of disturbing polei,; and their intensities must lJe taken as ilHlcfiuitcly YarialJle and their joiut effect ma.r girn rise to a great \·arietr of deforumtioni,;. "To follow them up to their source in any special case would necessarily require obserYatious at a great numlJer of points closels packed over the regiou nuder im·estigation." To illustrate the use of these formulIB, I ha,·e applied them to a disturbed region, and · assuming the position, depth, and intensits of a magnetic pole, hiwe computed the deforrnatiom; of the isogonic, isoclinic, aud isodyuamic curves for the purpose of com1iariug tllcm with their corresponding cun·es as deduced from obserYatious. 1'he region selected is iu Southern Yermont,. and the computation is made for <p=431o, ;\=722°, at which place the declination D=+112°, the dip tl=74~o, and the horizoutal inteusi(y in British units H=3.5ll. The 1.fo;tauccs apart of the isomaguetic li11es nuder the supposition of equable distribution of magnetism were taken from charts, as well as their azirnuthR, as preseutrnl on the diagrams of the accompanying plate No. 37, where these respectfrc systems of lines are shown by dashes. 'l'he distm·l>ing pole is supposed to he GO kilometres below tlle surface (a little oYer 37 statute mileR), its magnetism is assumed to be of sotith polarit_y, the same as that of the northeru magnetic hemisphere, and its intensit;y is suppo::ied equal to oue-fortietll of that of the horizontal force. \Vith these assumptions the formula.; giYe the theoretical deformed curyes as shown in full lines on plate N:1. :n, and it ·will be seen th<tt these disturbed systems of isomagnetic curves conform, with respect to curYature, to what has been stated to hold for Central Europe; also tbat the deJ:lections of the dip cmTcS are less in amount than those of the horizontal intensity and of the declination. The maximum deflection uearl~· approaches ha.If a degree for the declination, 0.030 for the horizontal inteusit~· and se\·en rninntes for the dip. 'l'his would indicate that the abo,·e assumption as to depth and int-0nsity of disturbing pole is quite a moderate oue. The diagrams are drawn to scale and the disturbing effect upon the direction of the horizontal needle is still perceptible })eyond the region included within the area of a circle of radius 160 kilometrt·s (about 100 statute miles), and a comparison ill this region of the eurYature of the theoretical or disturbed isogonics with the actual cun·atnre of the isogoni~s as derfred from ohservat1011 an<l gh·en on the chart, indicates a general conformity, which by suitable changes in the assumptions might be more closely approximated. \Vith respt'ct to Alaskl, a different treatment for the construction of the isogonic curves had to be itdopted from that emplo;ye<l for the eastern and westeru parts of the U uited States. The graphical process fails for Alaska, for the reason that the obsen·ations arc not sufficiently munerous and do not cover the region with regularitj·; further, in mauy parts the reduction to epoch is so uucertain that the results would be of iittle value. We are therefore coru1ielled to have resort to an analytical process in which the di£iicultie8 and uncertainties of the gr:tphical process arc replaced only by greatm· laboriousness. To make use of all olJsernttious woultl neither ue practicable nor a<kisaule; we therefore cxclullc from analytical treatment all the older ollscn·atious, retaiuiug only quite m()(lcru onc8, iu order thr1t the effect of imperfoct knowledge of the secalar yariation may lle a minimum; we further group the obseiTations so as to distribute them, as near as may be, eYe11ly over the surface nuder iuvestigatiou. In order that these groups may ham the reguired ntngc iu latitude aud lougitutle, and for the purpose of introdnciug 1m£iicieut data into our i1ro1Jlem, it was necessary to bring in some obser\·ations faken at sea. These observations are further exceptional, inasmuch as they include re:mlts of 1850 (about), wherea.:'! all other results har<lly go back ten ;years from the present time. S. Ex:. 77-36

The position of these groups is sl10wu by dots on the accompanying magnetic chart of the Alal'lkan region. To reach by a single interpolation formula the isogonics for so extended an area as Alaska, the Bering Sea, and adjacent 'vaters of the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans, we need to introduce additional terms in Lloyd's formula, as usually employed, and have

D=Do+r.J<p+s.J;\ cos cp+t.Jqr+u.JipJ.\ cos ip+v.:1.:\.2 cos2 cp+w.Jq?+x.dq.hlA cos <p +y.Jcp.J~\2 cos2 cp+z.J.:\.3cos3 <p

Put~ <p-<po=dcp=<pi

and assume cpo= 60° Ao= 160°

Do=D1 +q then the conditional equations take the form

29-10 a value which, in consideration of the higlt latitudes, the volcanic character of the Aleutian Islands1 the sonrceR from which many observations are drawn, and the uncertainty in the· value of the secular variation, may be accepted as satisfactory. The aboYe equation contains the wbole distribution of the magnetic declination in Alaska, as :shown by tbe currn8 on the third of the a-0companying magnetic charts, but the limits of applicahility there presented should not be transgressed. It is easy to find roots of the equation by tbe method of trial an<l flrror; thus, for any giYe11 value or dPsire<l isogonic line of D'\ we either assume qJ and find the corre:;;pomlrng A. to it, or assume A. and find <p, tbe former when the isogonic makes a large angle with the iiarallel of latitude, the latter when it makes a small angle therewith. For instance, for the curYe of -250 we have the intersections

Under the direction o:f'J. E. HILGARD, M. N. A. S.

In 1871, the income of the fnurl left in trno;t by Professor Alexander Dallas Bache to the National Academy of Sciences, for tl!e prosecution of :-icieutific research, became available for its objects. In view of the great interest always manifested hy Professor Baclie in the furtl!erance of investigations relatiug to tenestrial magnetism, aud of the ue,ed of a S,\·stematic determiuatfon of the magnetic elements at mau.r 1'!tatious in the interior of the United t3tatell, 1 sulimitted to tlie Board of Direction of the Fuutl, iu April of tliat ~·car, a proposition for a mag1wtic sur\·ey, which~ after due consideration, was formally approved b~- the Board. The details of the plan are giYen iu the following
PRO,JECT OF A MAGXE'l'IC SuRVEY LY THE IXTER]()JI OF THE CYI'J'EIJ STATES, TO JJE .'\JADE UNDER THE DlllE<'TJOX OF J. E. HILOARD, M. X. A. S.

1. The magnetic lleclinahon, dip, and horizontal intensitr will be ollsen·etl at as many statious as practical)le, so distributed as to furuh;h, together with tlie obi:;ervatious made in the Coa:,;t Smn·y, and other reliable data, the means of constructing a geuernl magnetic chart of the couutl·y easr of the Mississippi. i. The stations will he selected nearly with reference to -he want of reliable determinations. Some of tlie places, at which good observations huve heretofore been made, will be reoccupied in order to obtain the rate of secular variation. 3. The instruments will be supplied from the Coast Survey Office. 4. The expenditure for the field-work is authorize.d on th<'. following basis: The ohserYer will rect·ive an allowance of $3 per da~y for bis service1>, a IHI of $2 tor subsistence. The necessary expenses of transportation for himself and ini;truments, and the occasional hire of assistance, will constitute the other items of account. 5.

an amount not exceeding $1,500 in the aggregate, to .Mr. J. E. Hilgard, who will render accounts nnder the heads comprised in the estimate, and who will also require monthly reports of progress to be ma.de by the obserwr, wl1icl1 he will lay before the Board. 7. When the field-work has sufficiently progressed, special provision will be niade for the
discussion of the material and the oonstruction of a map. Approved.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Observers haviug been trained under my special direction, and fumislied with detailed instructions for tlw work, it was beg-mi by the occupation of niue stations in 1871-'72, and continued by direction of the Board duriug parts of successirn ;years, ending in August, 1876. In all, oue hundred and forty stations were occupied; at oue hundred and thirty-four of these, detPTminations of the magnetic declination wrrc> made, and at uiuety-two of them re1<u1ts were afao obtained for the dip and horizontal intensity. Tlw data lrnve been collated, field computations rm·ised, and full ahstrncts prevared nH<ler my direction hy H. \V. Blair· .Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey. The abstracts are presl:'uted with thP rednrtions, in tabular form for com·e11ie11ce of reference, omitting all details 11ot essential to the comprehension of the records. Careful verification has been made of tlle results by independent computations. 'l'he table of final rmmlts, giYing- the names of the Rtations occupied) with their geographical positions, will indicate tlw large area onr wl1ich the work externled. B.v comhini11g tlle resuHs for declination at these stations with the similar data available in the Coast Sun·ey archives, and from other sources, I was ellahled to constrnct a chart of isogonic lines in tlrn United Statel-l for the year 1875, and thus to rneet in some memmre tlw great and constantly inereasing demand for information relative to the variation of the compat1R. This chart was puh1ished as an illustration to Appendix No. 21, Coast Surve.r Report for 187H.

O'oserver, T. C. IlILGARD. In the reduction of the observatious for intensity in 1871-'72 the absolute horizontal force is obtained by comparison with Washington in the following manner: By observations at Washington, August 11, 1871, the magnet made 120 vibrations in 4HU·.59 at a. temperature of ooo F. Further obS6rvations on !\:larch 25, 1873, give the time of 120 vihrations equal to 470".37 for the same magnet, temperature, and locality. From observations made by C. A. Schott, Assistant, Ooast Survey, the absolute horizontal force at Washington was found to be 4.356 for the former date and 4.352 for the latter. By interpolation we form the table given on page 5. The horizontal intensity, or a.bsolute horizontal force, H, is fouu<l for any station by the formula T'H

B1=T!°
The table gi.'"'8 the logarith1D8 of 'l"H for the several dates.

Hcduction for temperature to be applied to the observed time of 120 vibrations of the eolli· mat-0r magnet. In Schott's garden, Washington, D. C., the. followiI1g observations were made: I. March !!5, 1873.-Mean of two observations, T=468.6155; t=370,35 F. II. March 30, 1873.-1\fean of two observations, T=471.4685; t=740.50 F. At that time the horizontal intensity was decreasing, consequently the time of 120 vibrations was increasing, the rate of increase being 0·.00646 per day. Referring I to the date of II .we ol>tain the following data for March 30:
0

T=468.6478; t=37.35. T=471.4685; t=7l.5f), AT= 2.8207; At=37.15.

COMPARISON OF THE SURVEY OF DELAWARE RIV.Im OF 1819, BETWEEN PETTYS AND TINICUM ISLANDS, WITH MORE RECENT SURVEYS.
By HENRY L. 1\iARINDIN, Assistant.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Bost.on, Mass., March 2, 1882.

I have the honor to send you the following report on a comparison of a survey of the Delaware River of 1819 with the more recent surveys of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In a report dated November 15, 1880,· I had already given a comparison of a number of cross. sections from the surveys of 1843 and 1878; some of these I have compared also with the plan of 1819, and add a number of sections covering the space from the upper eud of Pettys Island (named Pettits Island on ihe plan of 1819) to the head of Tinicum faland. The survey of 1819, made by David McClure ·'by order of the Councils" of the city of Philadelphia, appears to be as good a survey as can be found of that date. The distances along shore, and the widths of stream in reaches, agree well, but the absence of meridian lines and parallels of latitude, and of unmistakable points on the shore line, makes the comparison a difficult one, and necessarily limits the points of comparison where a certainty of position can be established. The first section examined (see sketch 41, section .A.) lies at the upper limit of the plan of 1819 in the north cbanne.l of Pettys Island and over" Richmond Bar," so called in my report of November 15, 1881. Maximum depth on Richmond Bar in 1819 = l!J feet at low water; in 1843 the same maximum depth Wa.8 fouud, and in 1878 it wa:s 17 feet. The area of cross-section was 39,020 square foot in 1819. In 1843 the area had been reduced to 32,390 square feet, which gives a loss of about 17 per cent. in twenty-four years. This bar, as such, is not apparent on the plau of 1819; the en<iroachment up to 1843 seems to have beeu due to the building of wharves; after that date, although the wharves were not extended, the decrease of area continued in a lesser degree, from 32,390 to 29,980 square feet, or only 7 per cent. in thirty-five years. This decrease of area appears to have been due to other causes than obtained between 18.19 and 1843. The wharves remained unaltered and the shore line of the island dicl not change, so that it is along the bed of the channel that the change must be looked for and where it is found. This shoaling, to my mind, is the in· direct effect of dumping dredged material in the vicinity. The next section examined (sketch 41, section B) is in the south channel of Pettys Island, near its western end. This section is also over a bar lying between the island and Cooper's Point. The area. of cross-section was 29,900 square feet in 18191 and in 1843 it had been reduced to 21,390 square feet, a loss of 28 per cent. In 1878 the area showed a deQided increase to 24,330 square feet, or about 13 per cent., and the change for the better, shown as having taken place between 1843 and 1878, appears .to have been general throughout this channel. The width of this section, which in 1819 was about 2,600 feet, increased to 2,850 feet in 1843, and decreased slightly between 1843 and 1878. The maximum depth on west-end ba.r, Pettys Island, south channel, was 20 feet at low water in 1819 ; in 1843 it had shoaloo to 15* feet, and in 1878 it deepened again to 16 feet.

Our next cross-section (sketch 41, section C) was taken in the main stream between a bu1khe&d at the foot of Callowhill street, Phi1adelphia, and a wharf at Cooper's Point, the same as section 16 of 1878. The area of cross-section was 54,950 s11tmre feet in 1819, with a width of 3,20Q feet. In 1843 the area had not changed materially, being 53,600 square feet, with a width of 3,100 feet, the decrease being only 2 per cent.; but between 1843 and 1878 the whan·es were extended on both sides of the river, the greatest encroachment taking place at Cooper's Point. The maximum depth (on section 16 of Physical Hydrography, 1878) was 44 feet in 1819; in 1843 it had deepened to 45 feet, and in 1878 to 47 feet in the chaunel near the Philadelphia shore. The area, which in 1843 was 53,600 square feet, was reduced to 48,368 square feet in 1878, a reduction of 10 per cent. ; but the width decreased in a larger ratio, from 3,100 to 2,320 feet, in 1878, or about 25 per cent. The next cross-section examined (sketch 41, section D) is one"'across both channels of Windmill Island, from the foot of Almond. street, across the jetty at the south end of the island., to th@ Oau1den shore. Ila>ing been able to locate accurately the position of origin of this cross-section on the plan of 1819, I give a sketch of it (sketch 42). This section, which in 1819 passed across Windmill lslaml 700 feet above its southern extremity, giving 430 feet as the width of the islaml-f:rom low water on the west channel to low water on the east channel-and a width of about 125 feet above high water, shows the island to have been reduced to a width of 180 feet at low water in 1843, and to ltave disappeared entirely in 1878. In 1819 the bulkhead at tlle foot of what is now Almond st.reet, Philadelphia, was about 120 feet shoreward of the wharf existing there in 1878.· The area of cross-section of the west channel was then 33,150 square feet at low-water stage, with the greatest depths about midway between the wl1arf and Windmill Island. The width of channelway was then 1,260 feet. In 1843 the survey shows that a wharf had been bnilt on the Philadelphia side, extending 120 feet from the bulkhead of 1819, while the low-water line of the island had not changed; this reduced the channel width to 1,140 feet. The channel-way proper had, however, shifted towards the I)ennsylvania shore, making deeper water along the c1ity front. The ar~a of section decreased slightly, from 331150 to 33,034 SfJnare feet. Between 1843 aud 1878 the area of cross-section increased to 34,904 square feet, or 5 per cent. During this interval the southern 'end of Wind.mill Island disappeared, and the width of the west channel increased to 1,320 feet by the erosion of the island, while the wharf on the Philadelphia side remained nearly in the same condition. The increase of area is mainly due to the increase of channel depths, which is, to my mind, a consequence of restricting the widths of channel by the extension of the wharves on the city front, and securinir the permanency of the water line of the island by bulkheading. With fixed. shores, the restoration of area of cross-section can only be effected by the bottom giving way. On the continuation of this cross-section across the east channel we find the greatest changes. In 1819 the low-water line of the island lay 240 feet east of the present jetty. The navigable channel was then near the Camden shore, with a gradual slope of bottom from the island to the greatest depth (18 feet), 1,500 feet distant, and a width of water-way of 1 1900 feet, and a sectional area of 22,200 square feet. In 1843 that part of Windmill Island ea.st of the present jetty had disappeared, and the water-way had become more uniform in depth, with a shoaling on the slope of the Camden shore and a corresponding deepening near the island. The width increased from 1,900 feet in 1819, to 2,010 feet in 1843, and the area also in nearly the same proportion, from 22,200 to 23,400 square feet, or 5 per cent., by the wearing away of the island slope and the more general distribution of navigable depths. During the thirty-five years between 1843 and 1878 the changes in this channel were more marked; the movement of oscillation about a common point continued, by tilting the bottom up on the Camden shore and depressing it towards the island. The last vestige of solid ground across the island had vanished, and comparatively deep water had obtained close to the now existing jetty off the south point of the island, and where the low-water line existed in 1819 we
·The maximum depth in west channel of Windmill Island was 42 feet in 1819; in 1843 the depth increased io 45 feet, and in l871:l a further inoreWle is found to a depth of 48 feet. In the east channel the maximum depth waa 18 feet in 1819, and it had shoaled to 16 feet in 1843; in 1878 the maximum depth was 161 feet.

now have 15 feet of water. The decrease in the depth on the Camden side is very marked, for at the place where the greatest depth of chanuel (18 feet) was found in 1819, the gronud is now dry at low water and is 200feet:outside of the then low-water line, giving an approximate Rhoalingof 18 to 20 feet. The area also decreased from 23,400 to 20,140 square feet, or 18 per cent., b~- tlrn pusl1iug out of the bank on the Camden shore, notwithstanding the large and general increase of naYigahle depths. '.the width of stream diminished from 2,010 to 1,430 feet at low water, which is nearly 28 per cent These changes in the east channel must have been induced by the extension of the Camden wharrns, both above and below this section, thus creating a lee under which shoaling took plaC(\ hoth during the flow of the flood and the ebb, and also crowding the streams against the island shore. The next cross-section examined (sket-0h 41, section E) lies at Kaighn's Point, beginning at the Philadelphia shore, about 2,500 feet below the site of the old navy-yard, and running to the upper corner of the Ice-boat Uornpauy's lower wharf. The best location of this cross-section on the plan of 1819 gives the apex of the shoal-the prolongation of t11e tail of "\Vindmill Islaml-about 400 feet nearer the Jersey shore than in 1843. Thirty-five years later, in 1878, no change had taken place in the position of this shoal, which brings us to the conclusion that the entire shift took place from 1819 to 184:3, during a period when the regime of the stream was not disturbed by the occupation of the shores. This does not appear probable, and I must attribute this difference of position in the body of the shoal to errors in the location of the soundings of 1819. This may not affect seriously the area of cross-section for comparison.· In 1819 the area was approximately 57,970 square feet, with a width of 3,700 feet at low-water stage. There wcri' then no wharves on either shore for some distance from the section line. In 1843 a wharfllad been built on the Philadelphia side, with a long bulkhead running diagonally across the end of the section line, and a shoaling had begun on the Jersey shore, thus reducing the low-water width to 2,980 feet, or nearly 20 per cent., the area decreased about 4 per cent., to 55, 700 square feet, by the extension of the wharf and the shoaling, both of which took place in shoal ground, over flats, which did not reduce the area in proportion to the decrease of width. ln 1878 a large exteusion of the bank had taken place on the Jersey side by the erection of wharves at Kaighn's roint, some of which were pushed out to 19 feet depth, whereas the Philadelphia shore was not occupie<l 30 feet beyond the low-water line of 1843. These changes reducetl the width of water-way to 2,430 feet, or nearly 18 per cent.; but the area of cross-section changed inversely to the width hy increasing to 60,745 square feet, or about 8 per cent. in a general increase of depths throughout the section 7 and a maxi· mum increase of 43 per cent. on the apex of the middle shoal-from 14 feet in 184.3 to 20 feet in 1878. The next cross-section (sk~tch 41, section F} was chosen over the Gr~enwich Point middleground. The same maximum depth is found in these channels in 1878 ;is in 1819, namely, about !t9 feet in that near the Greenwioh Point wharves, and 34 feet in the chauuel near the Jersey shore.. The minimum depth on the middle-ground was about 18 feet in 1819, 18 feet in 1843, au<l 17 feet in 1878. The survey of 1819 shows this middle-ground-taking the 18 feet curve as the limiting line-as the southern end of the shoal then extending from the south end of Windmill Island, with very nearly the same minimum depth over it as was found in 1843 and in 1878. The width of stream was then 2,430 feet low water, and the approximate area 55,600 square feet, with natural banks on each shore. In 1843 the width was 21560 feet, an cl the area had also increased about 2 per cent. to 57,200 square feet; up to that date the shores remained unoccupied. In 1878 the Greenwich Point coal wharves ltad been built, reducing the width of stream to 2,200 foot and the area of cross-section to 54,300 square feet, or about 5 per cent.; the bank of the Jersey shore seems to have retreated with the advance of the wharves on the opposite shore, and the bottom does not show any s~eial changes aside from a slight tendency to give way, which ma.yin time give better water on the middle-ground. · The next comparison is that of cross-section No. 37, of the Physical Hydrograpl1y of 1878 (sketch 41, section G) lying below Gloucester, at the upper end of the Horse-shoe Shoal. The high water lines do not appear to have shifted sinoo 1819, but the low-water line seems to have pushed.

out towards the center of the stream on the Pennsylvania side, and to hav~ remained very nearly stationary on the Gloucester shore. The bed of the stream also shows a shift towards the Pennsylvania shore, the largest change being noted hetween 1819 and 1843. Iu 1819 the area of crosssection was 47,545 square feet, with a width of 2,650 feet at low water. In 1843 the width bad been reduced from 2,650 feet in 1819 to 2,330 feet, or 12 per cent., and the area had changed inversely from 47,545 square feet to 53,915, or nearly 13 per cent. The channel depth had increased about 9 per cent., with a shift of bed as explained above. In section G the maximum depth in 1819 was 40 feet, in 1843 it was 43 feet, and in 1878 also 43 feet. In 1878 the width was 2,260 feet, and the area remained nearly the immc as in 1843, or 5a,M)0 squrtre feet, atHl the shift of bed of stream had continued to the westward with a corresponding advance of the eastern bank towardB the center of the river. It would appear that the shift of bed found here aml elsewhflre is th(1 effect of the unequal occupation of tl1e shores. The next section (sketch 41, section H) wa8 chosen over the middle of the Horse-shoe Shoal, on the site of section No. 40 of the l'hysical Hydrography of 1878. The high-wat~r lines do uot show any change since 1819. The low-water line at the mouth of the Back Channel, oft' the eastern end of League Island, rernaim; about in the same position in 184,3 as in 1819. Here the section begins. The area in 1819 was approximately 70,380 square feet, with a low-water width of f>,450 feet. In 1843 the area of cross-section had increased t6 74,570 square feet, or about 5 per cent., the width remaining nearly the same. The channel-way proper had shifted towards the Penm.yl vania shore, with a notable increase of maximum depth, but if. we com.pare the width of channel for 30 feet draught, we find a decrease of 140 feet, and if tlrn sectional area of channelway for 18 feet draught is observed, it is found that this area bad decreased from 42,500 square teet in 1819 to 37,100 square feet in 184:1, or l:l per cent., and that the width for this depth had t!Pcreased 300 feet, the max·imum depth showing a large increase notwithstauding. Section H, maximum depth in channel-way was 34 feet in 1819; in 1843 the maximum depth bad increased to 44 feet, aml in 1878 the maximum depth was reduced to 40~ feet. In 1878 the area of cross-section had diminished to 72,450 sqnare feet, or about 3 per cent., and the width had increased from 5,550 feet in 1843 to 5,700 feet in 1878. The channel-way remained essentially in the same position, with a decrease of depth in it.s deepest portion, and also over the shoalest part of the Horse-shoe Shoal. The navigable channel for a draught of 18 feet decreased both in width and iu area-in width from 1,200 to 1,080 feet and in area from 37,100 to 33,080 square feet, or nearly 24 per cent. lu the next section (sketch 41, section I) chosen in the reaeh off the front of League Island, near its western end _(where in 1819 the island was as yet a piece of marsh bordering on the Schuylkill Ri\·er, and covered at high tide), I find a great change between 1819 and 1843. The arPa o( cros8-section was 58,0f>O square feet at the time of the first survey, wit.h a low-water width of 3,820 feet. In 1843 the area had increased to 77,900 square feet, or M per cent.; this cbauge appears large, but might be accounted for by the artificial extension of that part of League Island, west of its limits of 1819, thus restricting the current of the river to narrower limits. The blind channel near the Jersey shore was then very shallow, and the width of the 6-fqot shoal, separating it from the main ship channel, was 77 5 feet against 200 feet in 1843. The water frontage of the island became much bolder between 1819 and 1843, and continued to deepen up to 1878. The lowwater witlth also increased to 4,080 feet. In section I, the maximum depth in the main ship channel was 30 feet m 1819; in 1843 it was 30 feet, and in 1878 28~ feet. In the blind channel on the Jersey shore the maximum depth was 13 feet in 1819, 23 feet in 1843, and 21 feet in 1878. In 1878 the area was 72,704 square feet, with a low-water width of 3,930 feet. The area hfM}. diminished 6 per cent. by a gradual shoaling along the bott-0m of the channel-way. The same .. watt1r remained 0.1 the shoal dividing the blind channel on the Jersey shore from the ma.in ship channel. The next section for comparison (sketch 41, section J) was placed at tbe southern limit of the survey of 1878, beginning at the low.water line near the wharf at 'Fort Miffi.in, ~nd crossing the pier on which Fort Miffi.in light-house stands, thence continuing to the Jersey shore. These points were identiiied on the plan of 1819. The outline of the fort remained unchanged in 1843.

The pier known as Davis' pier in 1819 does not seem to coincide with the light-house pier, but is close to the position of a similar pier which is shown on the survey of 1843. Whether the accurate position of Davis' pier was obtained in 1819 or not, I am unable to say; but the size of this pier as well as its shape tends to confirm its identity. In 1819 the area, of cross-section was 80,230 square feet, and the low-wawr width 5,060 feet. The section was diYided into two channels by the sl1oal on which Fort Miffiin light-house stamls. In 1843 the low-water line had advanced some 70 feet at the base of' the fort. The main channel between the fort and the light-house had deepened somewhat. The same clepth of water obtained on the shoal south of the light-house an cl in tlic blind channel near the Jersey shore. The area of cross-section had changed but little, to 81,710 square feet, an increase of only 1 per cent. in twenty-four years, and the low-water width remained nearly the same with a slight increase. In 1878 the maximum depth in the main channel off the fort was the same as in 1843.· The low-water limits had not altered aml the only change to note ooourred in the blind channel, whiell shows a shoaling of 5 feet where the maximum depth was located in 1843, and a tendency to impinge on the Jersey bank. The same depth was found on the light-house shoal as in 1819 and 1843, which is remarkable in view of the well-attested changes on shoals located in or near midstream anywhere in the Delaware River. Some changes may be noted in the immediate vicinity of the light-house pier. Already in 1843 the water had become very bold on all sides of the pier, but in 1878 still greater undermining is detected by finding 36 feet of water close to the foot of the pier on its southerly side, and 26 feet, close on to the opposite side. This shows the position of the light-house pier to be in a precarious condition, and that it is only a question of time when · the pier will ha:ve to giYe way. The area of cross-section increased to 851010 square feet, or about 4 per cent., in thirty-five years, and the width increased to 5,300 feet. The above section concludes the comparison with the surveys of 1843 and l 878; the next comparisons will be made with the surveys of 181!), 1842, and 1881. Not having at hand the original hydrograpby of that section of the Delaware lying between Fort Miftlin and the upµer end of Tinicum Islancl, the space between the last cross-section compared and the next will he longer than that observed uetween any two of the previous crosssections. The next section (sketch 41, section K) was drawn across the middle of Maiclen Island off the upper encl of Tinicum Island. (See al.so sketch 43.) In 1819 this cross-section, beginning at the low-water line on the Pennsylvania shore, pre. seuted three distinct channels; the first channel was the one back of what was then called Martin's Bar, lying below Hog Island; then came the c1haonel between Martin's Bar ancl Maiden Island, and last, the main ship channel between Maiden Island and the Jersey shore. The aggregate area of cross-section of the three water-ways was 81 1550 square feet, with a combined width of 4,200 feet. Maiclen Island was then 1 1380 feet wide on the section line. In 1842-twenty-three years later-the channel back of Martin's Bar had closed; the channel between the Pennsylvania shore and Maiden Island had widened and deepened; :Maiden Islaml was then 1,oso feet wide as against 1,380 in 1819, and the main ship channel to the Jersey shore had widened and decreased in area, although maintaining the same maximum channel depth. The area of cross-section was 75,560 square feet, showing a decrease of 7 per cent., and the width remained nearly the same at about 4,270 feet. From 1842 to 1881, the channeh1orth of Maiden Island continued to shoal up, retaining, however, the maximum depth of 1842 in a restricted channel-way near the Pennsylvania shore. Maiden Island had shifted down stream so that the section line gave 13 feet depth of water where the mid· dle of the island was situated in 1842. In the main ship channel the maximum depth was maintained as in 1819 and 1842, and the · area of cross-section remained nearly the same as in 1842. t The noticeable change shown by this comparison is the washing away of that part of Maiden lsland lying to the eastward of the section
·In aection J the ma.ximum depth in ma.in channel wae 32 feet in 1819, 35 feet in 18431 and 35 feet again in 1878.

line, and the continued shift to the westward, i: e., down stream. The area of cross-section was 83,9!!0 squ:ire feet against 75,560 square feet in 1842--an increase of 11 per cent., almost entirely due to the erosion of Maiden Island and the substitution of comparatively deep water in its stead. In view of the present occupation of Maiden Island, and of the works being erected thereon in 1881, I give below a comparison of the changes, both in surface area and in position, since 1819. The direction of the river at this point is, in a general way, east and west, east being the direction up stream. The cross-section liuc as given above, ran south-southeast across the widest part of the island of 1819. In 1819 the surface area of :M:aiden Island exposed at low water, was 410,491 square yards, and the area of marsh land was 281,634 square yards. The length of the island-up and down stream-was 4,000 foet, and the greatf'st width 1,900 feet. Taking the line of cross-section as the axis of ordinates, we find tbe upper end of this island 1,800 feet to the eastward of that line. In 1842 the surface area had decreased to 159,721 square yards at tbe low-water stage, or 61 per cent. in twenty-three years; and the area of marsh bad fallen off to 125,000 square yards, or 55 per cent. in the same period. The greatest length of the island was 2,900 feet, as against 4,000 feet ill 1819, and the upper point was 850 feet to the eastward of the section line, showing a movement down stream of 950 feet in twenty-three years, or 41! feet per annum. In 1881 the 1wsition of the island shows the continued motion down stream. It had passed across the section-line so that its upper extremity was 800 feet to the westward of that line, giving a rate of motion of 1,650 feet in thirty-nine years, or 42! feet per annum, which does not differ materially from the prm'iously not.eel rate between 18HJ and 1842. The surface area also continued to decrease largely, from 159,721 square yards in 1842 to 4:2,052 square yards in 1881, a loss of 74 per cent. in thirty.nine years, at which rate, all things being equal, the island would disappear before 1895; but the works of revetment and protection begun in 1881, will doubtless effect the proposed reclamation aud secure it from further encroachment by the stream. The area of marsh land also decreased to 28,935 square yards, i. 76 per cent. during the same period. The entire loss of surface area of Maiden Island during the sixty-two years from 1819 to 1881, has been 368,439 square yards, which is 90 per cent. of its area in 1819. Ju the ahove report I have endeavored to give simply the results of comparisons of cross-sectious, as obtained from the different surveys of the Delaware Hiver, and I have stated an opinion as to the probable causes of these changes only in cases where these seemed to me apparent. A.11 of wbich is respectfully submitted. HENRY L. MARINDIN,

It, had been snpposrnl by many-my,;elf amon;.\" them-that, becituse a deeper channel was ueal'iy always found in the beml, navig-ation g-aiued some advautag-e in this one respect; but it will be obsern~<l from the table that l'caches in which the great hends occur have 110 greater average depth than others. For i.nstance, between sections 124 aud 161 of Table No. 1, the mean depth is 110 greater than for Home 1wal'l~· straight rer1ches, although in this case the river distance is nearly three times t.lrn Ieng-th of the air-line. The thalweg (channel) depth has in this case an average differing but one foot from the grand mean. I hatl presumed that mean depth for bends and reversiom; wodld balance, but I had not expected compensation in thalweg depths. 2. The ·mean depth. of crn1111-11ection and the thnlweg depth vary with inverse radius of euruatu-re, or, practic(l.lly, w·ith angles o/ tl~flect-ion. (See Tahle No. 2.)

The variatiou of thalweg-depth with cmTature is limited. The gaiu of dt>pth nltimahis essentially at 230 or 2i:JO deflection for half.mile elio!'dl', an<l withia this limit is 11earl_y proportional. Similarly, the mean-depth increases with cmTatnm, lmt at first, mlly at. ahont half the r:ttt> fou11d for thalweg.depth, and, within tLe scope of our data, there is 110 limit to this increasP.* (Hee sketch No. 44.)
INFEJtENCE8.

There appears to be a decrease (comparatin~l~· small) of river widtlrn with curnttnre, a1ul also a decrease with distance up river; both inegular. 'fhese have been ign01·e1l i11 pre,·ious statements, as if entirely elimi11ate11. There is a tendency at reversions, where one centrifug·al force oYerlaps the other (for oppo;:;ite sides of the stream), for the riv1w to <li\'ide and erode the bed near both banks. This tcndc11ey was represe11te<l by the third term in my formula for the cross-sectiou ill the Delaware (Appendix: No. 9, Anuual Heport Coast and Geodetic 8urny, 1871:'1). Then: appear to lie distinctive characteristics of ren·rsions au<! straight reaches; i.e., wher(' a decided curve is followed immediately by another similar cm·,·e i11 rewrse direction the c:barac· teristics of the straight reach do not appear. In my notes for tlie Commission some practical deductions are made whicl1 may here be left to implication.

·For the sharpest turns-those falling between 53° ancl 60°-the instances are so fow that the still more rapid increase of mean depth that they indicate must be regarded as douhtfu I.

The waters adjacent, even close to the shore, are mostly over seven fathoms in depth, and these connect with the Prwific Ocean by mea.ns 9f the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which has a considerable depth. The t,ides of Port Townsend partake of the genera.I character of those of the northern part. of the Pacific Ocean, wl1ich

The agreement between the theoretical and observed values here is not very close, but it is seen tllat both decrease from year to year somewhat after the same law, and the agreemt'nt is sufficient to show that this inequality deduced from the obse.rvations arises i11 the m auner just explained, for it must ue borne iu mind that the relations above, from which the preceding theoretical values are deduced, are those of deep-water tideis,in which the perturuing eft'ects of the shallowwater componentis do not enter. It is seen above that the value of A, and cortsequently of A", depends upon the amplitude of the principal diurnal component, 2.4698, which is unusually large in these tides. A very small inequality of the same kind was obtaiued in the analysis of the observations of Penobscot Bay, where tile dinri!al tide is Yery small. It is interesting to observe that this inequalit,y at Port Tow11. send is larger than in Penobscot Ba;y, about in the ratio of the principal diumal tide; which is further evidence that this inequality arises in the way explai11ed theoretically above. 5. 'l'he ter-diurnal component of the M-tide, it is seen, is very small, and not clear)~- brought ont by the analyisis, a;s is seen from the scattering values of the epochs E3, and it is probable there is no real sensible tide of tltis sort, and that the very small values obtained are due to unelimiuatcd abnormal disturbances. The term iu ·the tidal forces giving rise to such a tide, is iso extremely small that a sensible title could scarcely be expected. The quarter-diurnal component of the M-tirle, though small, is Yery clearly brought out in the analysiis, as is seen from the regularity, from year to year, of both the amplitudes A 4 and the epochs E4· This is purely a shallow-water tide, being the tide designated by M2 M2 in Schedule IV. A small part. of it may arise from the component M2 M6 of Schedule VI, since the latter has the same period. · The one-sixth diurnal shallow-water component, of the M-tirle, though Yery small, is clearly brought out in the analysis, as is shown by th.e nearly equal values of the amplitudes A6 and the epochs E6 for the several years. This is the shallow-water component, designated by Mz (M2 1\12 ) in Schedule VI. In the 8-tide there is also asma.U diurnal component, with amplitudes and epochs for the several years nearly the same. There should be a theoretical component of this sort, just as in the case of the moon, arising from the solar elliptic and dcclinational components; but, as the solar force is less than half the lunar, and the ellipticity of the solar orbit only about one-third of that of the lunar, this inequality would have t-0 be very small in comparison with the hrnar one. This inequality, as brought out in the a.nalysis, seems to be too large for this theoretical ti.de, and it must be due, in part at leas~, to some other cause. The amplitude of the whole tide is only about au inch. 6. The amplitudes and epochs of the L-tide, ·as usual, are irregular, since they are affected by a shallow-wat.er component of very nearly the same period, the etfect of which is not eliminated in the analysis. This is the fourth component of the second group in Schedule V, not written out, but the designation of it would be Mz (S.J N 2 ), and the value of u would be 2i2+2is-2i1 =29.455626, which is very nearly the value of 2i4 in Schedule I, belonging to the semidiurnal component of the L-tide. Hence this component is always irregular, as brought out by the an'alysii,i, where there are sensible shallow-water tides. The amplitndes and epoohs of the N-tide are very regular, which shows that it is but little aft'oot.ed. by any shallow-water components having nearly the same period. The µ-tide is a.ft'ected by a shallow-water component ha.ving precisely the same period. This component is designated by: ~(Ms, Ma) in Schedule V. Having exactly the same period, it should S.-Ex.77-56

not derange the values of the amplitudes and epochs from year to year, but it destroys the theoretical relation between the forces and the corresponding com}J'Oncuts deduced from the theory of deep-water tides. The. amplitudes and epochs in this case, as brought out in the analysis, are as regular as is to be expected. The U- and T-tides at Port Townsend should be very small theoretically, especially the former, and from tlie irregularities of liotlt the amplitudes and epochs obtained from the analysis, the results are probably the nnelimiuated effects of shallow-water com1>onents and abnormal irregularities. The diurnal J compouent is too small to be brought out clearly in the analysis, ancl the irregular results obtained are, 110 doubt, due to nuelimiuated disturbances. This tide should be only about one-fifth of the Q-tidc. The regularity of the amplitudes au<l epochs of the diurnal Q-tiUe, 110m1 of them differing much from the mean of the tlu>tie years, rn<licntes that tliis is the true theoretical tide with all the other inequalities and the abnormal clistnrbancl's almo»t completely eliminated. 7. The quarter-diurna.1 component of the S-tide, as shown by the nearly Pl]nal values of the epochs <4, in this very S'nall compoueut, is fwicle.utly a real component. This is the component designated in Schedule lY by Si S2. The rehttiou between this aud th~1 quarter-diurnal M-tide, designated by M 2 S2 , is given by the values of U iu the second column of the Schedule, if we suppose the quarter-diurnal component of the lower order in Schedule VI, lla\·ing the same period, to be insensible. Tllis relation make"; the amplitude8 of tile 11uarter-diurnal components lll'Oportional to the seconcl powers of the amplitudes of the semi-diurnal components, and hence-

in which the amplitudes ill tlie first member, distinguished by an accent, are thrn;e of the luuar and solar quarter-diurnal components, and t!Jose in the second member belong to the lunar and solar Remi-diurual components. Now, the valtrns of A.1, A 2, and A'i, as obtained from the analysis of tlle observations, are, respecth·ely, 2.Hi84, 0.5522, and 0.1220. Hence we have-

This value, given by theory, 11iffers only one forty-fourth ofan inch from the value .0099 ueduc@d from the analysis of the observations. In the same manner all the other amplitudes of the quarterdiurnal componentR of Schedule IV can be theoretically deduced from those of the semi-diurnal coruponeuts. In the Port Townsend tides, however, these are all very small and of no importance. With regard to t,he theoretical relation of tile epochs, if we put t~e expression of these shallowwater quarter-diurnal components (e. fJ., 7, p. 8) into the form of each one of the components ~f the second memlJer of (2), which is the form under which the analysiR of the observations has been made, we shall haV(\-in which, after reduction by Table II,

This value of ·' 2 , deduced from the theoretical relations of the epochs, differs onl,\- 12° from .the value 3:fi 0 , obtaiuecl from the anal~·si.'! 1 which is a very sittisfactor,Y agreement of the values, considering the smallness of the component, ttie amplitude of which is only about one-eigl1th of an inch. The quarter-diurnal, shallow water, component of the MS-ticfe, designated by M 2 S2 in Schedule IV, is a, real component, as indicateLl by the regularity from ye<tr to year of the amplitudes and epochs, A4 and ·4· These can be deduced theoretically in the same manner as those of the S2 8 2 component in the preceding case.

This theoretical value of e 1 rliffers onls '.!0,4 from tlrnt of 3150.5 given by the analysis of the observations, although tlrn amplitude of the component is only about three-fourths of an inch. 'l'he shallow-water semi-diurnal component of the 2 SM. tide, designated by M2 (S 2 S2 ) in Schednle V, although very small, is clearly brought ont by the analysis, as indicated hy the regularity from year t-0 year of the amplitudeR and epochs. We liave uo relations for determining the amplitmle arnl epoch of this component theoretically. 8. The observations were analyzed fbr each of the four principal long period components, but no sensible incqnalit;y was obtained, as shown by the scattering values of the amplitudes and epochs for the several years, except tha.t corrcspondivg to the solar elliptic declination component. This, however, arises from meteorological causes, the part depending upon tlie tidal fonws, as in the other cast's, bciug cntirdy insensible. The theoretical expression of these long-period inequalit,ies makes the amplitudes very small for any part of the globe, and entirely vanish in the case of an earth entirely covered by water, at the parallel of 350 16'. Hence we could scarcely expect a sensible effect, even at the latitude of Port Townsend, and none was found in the tides of Penobscot Bay. 1ror the solar elliptic declination inequality, due to meteorological causes, there has been obtained

The fluctuations in the zero of the tide-gauge for the year 1874 rendered it impossible to get any satisfactory results for that year, and the results for the othtir two years are perhaps slightly affected from this cause. The combined annual aud semi-annual components give an inequality with a maximum of nearly 4 inches above mean level, occurring in December. The analysis gave no sensible value for the shallow-water long period component M2S, of Schedule IV. The height& of mean level above the zero of the tide- gauge as obtained from the analysis, are

II.-TIDES OF ASTORIA.

9. Astoria is situated on t.he Columbia River, Oregon, about ten miles from its mouth, latitude 4GO 11' 11ortl1, and longitude 1230 50' west from Greenwich. The river here is wide, but obstructed by bars and sand-banks, and has two principal channels, the southern one of which is the wider and deeper one, having a depth of about 30 feet at the entrance to the river, and extending up to Asto1ia, with an average depth of 40 to 50 feet. · The hourly co-ordinates of about two years and ten months bav-e been m;ed iu the aual,ysis of these tides, commencing with January, 1874, and f\Xtending to the last of October, 1876. The type of the tide differs considerably from Urnt of Port

Townsend, the diurnal tide here being less than half as large, while the semi-diurnal is about one· tbird greater. Still, it partakes of the general character of the Pacific tides, and is very difierent from those of tho Atlantic, in which the diurnal tide is very small in comparison with the semi·
diurnal. 10. The analysis of the observed co-ordinates, and all the reductions of the results, having been matle in preciselJ' the same manner as in the case of Port Towmmnd, the following results ha,·e

been obtained:

The year 1876 not heiug complete, it wa;; inc011\·euient to obtain correct re;;nlt;; for some of the components for that year, and so they have hee11 ornittecl. It was tl1onght m1m·,eersrsar~· t~) gin\ in detail here tl1e whole procesrs of the reductions which lrnn., l1t\e11 givPn in 11eetion 3 in tlw ca11e of the Port Townsend tideP, but the amplitn11es and epochs, as eorn·eted in that, way, are giw11 ahoYe. Where the amplitudes of the comporwuts are 80 Ht11all and the rnlue8 of tlie evoclls so scattering in a fow cases as to indicate that the results obtaiueil am 110L tliosp of a real ti1le, llie rnea11s, al' i11 the case of the Port, 'l'ownseml tides, are not giYcu. 11. It is seeu that in both the M· arnl the S-tide there is cout'liderable diurual compouent, as in the tide;; at Port Town;;eud, and ex11Iaiuable in the same way, and that the:s11 tide;; are less, somewhat in proportion to the diurnal tide;; generally at the two ports, a;; they i,;houhl he according to theory. The amplitudes a11d epochs of the semi-1liurnal compoucnt, of the M-tide, whe11 conected for _the position of the moon's 11otle, are very safo;factor;r, since 11one of them differ nmch from the mean of the three years. The ter-diurnal component of this tide, as usual, is \'ery small, and tlle epoclu,; somewhat irregular, but they indicate a real compone,nt. The quarter-!liumal, sllallowwater compouent of this tide is somewhat less tlran at Port Townsend, although the semi-diurna1 component is considerably grt-ater. The sixth-diurnal compo11e11t, also a :shallow-watt"r component, fa only about one-third of that of the quarter·1liurnal, but the regularity of thl:' amplitudes a1ul epoch;;, as brought out in the analysis, indicates that it is a true compo1wnt. The regularity in tlie aniplitudes and epochs of the S-tide, from yPar to ~'ear, is Wl'Y satisfactory, and, although the ter-diurnal ahd quarter-diurnal components of thi;; tide are very small, the regularity is such as t-0 indicate that tliey are real components. The tlieorctical nine of A 4 for thiR tirle is given hy the expreRsion of A' 2 , in section 7 in the Cl:lse of tl1e POl't 'l'owmiernl tideR, hy using the quantities in that expre8sion in this case deduced from tlie A i,;toria tides. Hence we get A',= .., · 3('S x .1013 = .0070 9 .. 9 ) This differs but litt.le from the value .01)91 obtained from the analysis, for Hie whofo amplitndti is only one-ninth of an inch.

The value given by the analysis is -:t'6o. The difference is not large, considering the small~ ness of the component and the uncertainty iu the epochs of such components. The amplitudes of the L-tide, which, for reasons given in section 6 preceding, are usually somewhat irregular,. happen to he in this quite regular, bnt the rnmal irregularity is seen in the values of the epochs. The wtide at Astoria is much smaller than at Port Towrnmu«l, thot1gh the semi-diurnal components of the former are in general greater than those of the Jat.ter place. But t,his compoueut is affected by a sba.llow-water component of the same period, independt>nt directly of the tidal forces, and this seems to affect the part depending directly upon the forces ·lifforently at tlie two places. The shallow-water MS-tide, as brought out by the analysis, seems to be a true fole, the amplitudes and epochs being quite regular for so small a component. The theoretical value of the ampl:tade of this component is given by the expression in section 7 preceding, which, with the values of ,the quantities in the expression belonging to the Astoria tides, gives for the amplitude

For Astoria being still nearer the latitude where these inequalities should vanish than Port Townsend, where the inequalities depending upon the tidal forces were insensible, they shoul!l likewise be so at Astoria.

firn rnile:s in length, and almut 50 feet in depth on the average, and having its entrance at Point !Joma. The hourly co-ordinates, measured from the curves of a self-registering tide-gauge for three years, commencing with .fauuary 1, 186!J, have been analyzed in order to obtain the constants of the principal components of the tide for this station.

In the same manner the epochs in brackets have bee.n obtained for the J-tide. If the values of L and G bad been obtained from all the equations hy the method of lt>ast squares, they would ha,·e been slightly d1fierent aml would have satisfied all the equations with ,·ery small residuals. If to the values of G we add the difference of time between Washington and the seYrral Rtations, we get the time by which the ma.x:imum of the diurnal tide follows that of the forces, that is, the time that the maximum of the tide depc11ding upon declination follows the greatest declination, or that depending upon parallax follows the time of the greatest parallax. If in reducing the epochs by means of 'l'able II the values taken from this table had been reduced to the time of the several stations, the value of G would have been the amount of this retard, without being reduced for the difference of time between Washington and the several stations. 18.

7·4-:-4 74.6 The values for the moon's mass given by these equations, as is usual, for reasons already given, are considerably too large. The valve of F for San Diego is greater than unity, which is the only case I know of in ans part of the world. For very deep-water tides F should equal unity and E should be equal 0. Tbis peculiar value of F must be caused by shallow-water components falling upon each of the several components, and thus increasing their values above what they should be with deep water. From section 34 of tbc report referred to above, we get for the two principal compoueuLs the following three sets of equations for determining L and G.

A<llliug to these values of G, for reasons giYen iu the case of the diurnal tides, the difi't·reuce of time between Washington and the seYeral stations, we get the times by which the maximum of the tide follows the maximum of the forces. Adding the difference of time between Washington and San Diego, 0. 112'\ to the preceding valne of G for San Diego, we get-0. 086d, that is, the maximum of the tide occurs a little before the maximum of the forces. This is anot11er peculiarity of the Sau Diego tides, am!, although extremely rare, is a possible case in the theory of the titles.

REPORT ON THE SIEMENS ELECTRICAL DEEP-SEA THERMOMETER.
Hy Comn1ander J, R. BARTLETT, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodeti<' Sn1·,'PJ'.
<AOOOMPANIED Br A DESCRIPTION OF THE APPARATUS, Br WERNER ST:ESS.)

COAS'l' AND GEODETIC SURVEY STEAMER BLAKE.

Providence, R. I., October 27, 1881. SIR: In obedience to instructions received from C. P. Patterson, Superintendent, to experiment and report on the working of the Siemeus deep-sea electrical apparatus furnislw<l to this yessel, I have to report as follows : The apparatus was set up on board the Blake, at ProYidence, in April, and several tests were made to see that all was in proper working order; the lower resistance coil was placed in a large tub of watrr at a temperature of 58° F. Water at 76° was plact>d in the copper vessel intended to hold the <leek resistance coil. \Vhen the pencil of light was brought to zero 011 the Reale by adding cold water to that ah·ead,y in the copper n'ssel, tlle attached thermometer read the same as the thermometer in the tub 011 1fock containi11g the resistance coil, 11amel~·, 5~0. Similar expl~rimenti,; were made with the same result. The arrangement of cable and con11ectio11s h:1s alre:1d;r been explained. My instructions for the season's work intended the use of the electrical apparatus for temperatures on the different lines, but owing to the non-arrival of a Carre ice machine, ordered from France, the apparatus was not used. My instructions were aftenrnrdR modified to limit the work of the season to soundings and bottom temperatures witli the l\filler-Casella. thermometers. Having completed the lines of soundings as laid out in instructions, I receired orders to call at Fortress Monroe for the ice machine, and make experiments on my way to Providence. I considered it very important to test the working of the apparatus in the strength of the cmrent of the Gulf Stream off Ohar:leston. I laid in a supply of ice at this port, and sailed on Augnst 41 running a line over known depths. One of the 60-pound sinkers usell in sounding was made fast to a becket, the latter seized to the insulated cable just above the lower resist.a.nee coil, and allowed to hang a short distance below. ·when well in the strength of the current, a series of temperatures were taken by the Miller-Casella thermometers on the sounding wire, and imme· !liately after the insulated cable was lowered to the surface. vVater from the surface having been placed around the deck resistance coil, the temperature of the attached thermometer read the same as that determinetl for the surface by the thermometer attached to the hydrometer ca.se. Under these conditions the pencil of light from mirror was on the zero of the scale. During the experiments the vessel was rolling from 10° to 150, and there was a moderate breeze from soutlleast. The lower resistance coil was lowered to 5 fathoms below tile surface, and was allowed to remain five miu utes. The circuit being closed, the pencil of light remained at zero. 1'owerings were made to 10, 20, and 30 fathoms. The deflection of the light was 150 at 10 fathoms. Temperature of attached thermometer when light was brought to zero, 76to; that by the Miller011seUa thermometer the same. The deflection of light at 20 fathoms (reckoning from 76zO) was 12° on scale. Tem1terature reduced to 70lo; by Miller-Casella, 69!0. The deflection at 30 fathoms was 2° from 7010 temperature. Temperature by electric apparatus, 69io; by Miller-Casella thermom· eter, 690.

Five minutes were allowe<l at any depth for the resistance coil to assume the temperature of the water, and after reducing· the water around the deck coil this was also allowed to remain ffre minutes before the final reading was takeu. A. common ice-cream freezer was used to reduce water below the freezing poiut, or to frappe it, and this was used for reducing the temperature of water around the deck coil. The following table will girn the results of the seyeral lowerings:

The deflection of light to the left of zero is represented by the sign deflection to the right b~- the :,;ign -. We could not see to work the cable after dark and were obliged to give up further obseryations. The~several lowerings were taken 5 miles apart on a line across the stream. The rolling of the vessel, which was considerable, affected the mirror so as to throw the light l'tbont 50 each side of the zero point when at rest, and nearly the same when the current was closed, but as the deflection was the same each side, it was easy to determine the middle point. ·while at work in the cunent it was necessary to work the engine in order to keep the wire np a:ad down. The jar of the engine affected the mirror to such a degree that readings could only be taken when the engine was stopped. 'i'he Carre ice machine having been receirnd on board at Fortress Monroe, we sailed from Hampton Roads August 10, steaming to the eastward until rea6hing the meridian of 74° 30' W., when a sound was taken giving a depth of 1,024 fathoms. A serial was taken to a depth of 400 fathoms with the 1\Iiller-OaHella thermometers. The thermometers on hand were very carefully compared with the standard, and ouly two were found that would record accurately at different temperatures. Only these two thermometers were used in taking the serial. Immediately after the serial with the thermometers, the insulated cable was lowered into the sea and the temperature by the galvanometer and upper resistance coil recorded. for the same depths as taken in the fin1t serial. Five minutes was allowed at 5 and 10 fathoms, but there was no (\eflection of the pencil of light. The temperature of the surface was 76ko. Having lowered to 15 fa.thorns, at the end of one minute the pencil of light was 9° to the left of 0 on the scale. At the end of 5 minutes it was 22°, and a.t the end of 10 minutes stm 220. .A. number of experiments were made

with regard to the time necessary for the resistance coil to as:sume the temperature of the water at the point to wl1ich lowered. Fiye minutes was decided on as the time necessary, and this time was adopted for all future depths. The deflection of light cannot be used as a measure for the· difference in temperature, as the temperature of the deck resistance coil does not remain a coustant during the loweriug of the cable, hut the temperature rises according to the elapsed time . . The fir8t lowering was to 400 fathoms, the temperature being at that depth 4ffJ. 'l'he cal!h· "·as then reeled in to 200 fathoms, when the circuit was made. The pencil of light was at zPro, tli(' water in the copper vessel having risen from 400 to 43£0. This temperature agreed with that at 200 fathoms when lowering to the same depth. We were from 7.18 p. m. until 1.30 a. m. taking the temperatures to 400 fathoms and return. This wa8 a Yery long time, hut every reading was taken "\\ith the greatest possible care. l<'or a serial with tlie electric apparatus, fifteen minutes for each depth would he a fair awragt·.

Tlie following am the temperatures obtained in lowering aud reeling ill:

TLe deflection of liglit was 6° from mo at 10 fathoms. TLe deflection at 15 fathoms was 21° from 73~0. At 20fathoms,110 from 610. At 30fathoms,100 from 560. At 50 fatlwms, the <leek resistance being 51°, tlle deflection was to the right 11 o, and thi.l temperature of the water was found to be 53.~o, nearly 30 higher thau at 30 fathoms. At 75 fathoms the deflection was 3° froi11 540. At 100 fathoms it was so from 53°. From 100 fathoms the cable was lowered without stopping to 800 futhoms; tlle circuit being made the deflection of light was 1000, the deck resistance being in a temperature of 75°. At 700 fatlwms tLe tleflection was 7°, the temperature of deck resistauce lrnving risen to 42~0. At 500 fathoms the deflection was mo from 54°. At 400 fathoms the deflection ·was o, the deck resistance temperature haviug risen to 400. At 100 fathoms the detlection 'ms 5° to the right from 490, In reeling back the cable the temperature at 50 fathoms was 542° and foll to 51 p at 30 fathoms. Immediately after the experiments with the Siemens a11paratns, nnother serial was taken with the Miller.Casella tl1ermometers. In this serial the l\filler-Oasella thermometers indicated tLe same chauge in the wat,er from 30 to 50 fathoms. 'The Miller-Casell:t thermometers were lowered to 30 and 50 fathoms continually, and alwa,,ys gave thb temperature at ilO fathoms higher than at .'30 fathoms. T11c cable was lowered three separate times to 50 fatl1oms, the readings being takPn both when lmrnriug and reeling in, with the following results:

·while the above experiments were l.Jeing conducted the 8ea was perfectl.r smooth, with no wind. The ship's engine was not used at all, the \'essel IJ·ing almost motionless in the water. The temperature of the deck resistance coil was redncetl by water from a carafr, the water contained therein having been frozen by the Uarre ice machine. Two carafes were prepared at a time, a111l there was plenty of time to keep one constantly at hand. The pencil of' light used cornred one degree of space on the scale.

The Yarions methods of determining the dectrical conductiYity of a metallic wire cousist essentially in ascertaining what le11gth of a gfren section -0f the wire will offer the same resistance as that length of a rnctailic wire of a gi\'en section taken as a sta11dard of comparison. .A description of the principle of one of those methods, known as ·w11eatstone's balance or bridge, will giYc a general idea of them.

On a base of hard wood, four stand wires are fixed, in the manner represented in the aboYe figure. They are provided with binding screws, .A, B, C, and D, and there are breaks at a, b, c, and d, also provided wi&h binding screws, so that any resistances may be introduced there. The

points A aud C are connected with the battery, while B and D are connected with a delicate galvanometer. Now it can be shown that, if tlie resistances introduced at a, b, c, d, and which we will designate by these letters, hear a certain relation, no current will pass in the galvanometer. Suppose, first of all, that the resistances are all equal in every resµect; the current arriving at A w·ould 1li\'i(le, one part would tra,·er~e the galn111ometer in the direction A, c, B, G, D, and the other in the directiou A, b, D, G, B, and as both of them are equal and opposite in direction, no effect wouM be prod need on tlie gah·;mometer; hut if the resistances a and b are different, the tensions of ll and D will he different, and· MCOrdingly a current will tnwerse tile galvanometer either from D to B or from B to D, and the nccule will be deflected a~oordingly. The principle of the deep-sea thermometer is based upon the variation which changes of temperature produce iu the resistance of metals to the passage of an electrical current. The aJlllamtns consists of a resistance coil which is lowered into tho sea by means of a cable to the depth at which the temperature is to be measured. 'l'he other end of the cable is attached · to a \Yheatstone bridge, specially arranged for tliis purpose. Another coil, of the same material alHl resistance at1 that lowered into the sea, is likewise attachefl t{l the bridge, with a battery and g-alnmometer. By sending a current int-0 the bridge a deflection of the gah"anometer needle will be noticed, showing that the temperature of the comparison coil is either too high or too low, according· to the direction of the deflection. By altering the temperature of the coil, a point must be reaehed when 110 deflection can be observed on the gah'auometer. The temperature then indicated hy the mercurial thermometer at~ached to the coil is the same as that of the coil lowered into the sea,,

The galrnnomet~r userl is Thomson's reflecting marine ga.Jvanometer. It consists of a perforate1l coil of fine insulated wire resting in a lar~e horseshoe magnet, c, one-half of which is slwwn in the :wcompanying figure (Fig. 2). Into this coil is inserted a holder, D, for the frame carrying the reflector. This frame is shown in the other figure. It is made of brass and has a, broad 81it iu which the small concave mirror, or reflector, is suspended by means of a silk: :fibre; the spring c keeps the fibre in a stat;e of tension. The mirror has a focus of about 2 feet, so that the image of an illuminateu 1Slit can be thrown on a graduated scale mounted at that distance in front of the coil. A small magnet attached to the back of the mirror is deflected when the tem· pemtnre of the two re8istancc coils is unequal, and the direction and amount of the deflection is indicated on the graduated scale by the concave mirror.

The special Wheatstone bridge apparatus is connected as shown in illustratioll So. 4!1. The zinc pole of the battery mnst be connected to the terminal marked Z, and the carbon pole to the terminal C. To the terminal E is connected an iusulatiug wire leading from the testingroom to the deck; to the otl1er end of this wire will lie attached a copper-wire rope, which mul't ue dropped over the ship's side into the sea. The two terminal pillars of the galvanometer, marked (} and C, are to be connected with the corresponding terminals of the \Vheatstorn\ bri1lgc. To the terminals 'f and T connect the ends of the comparison coil, which will be immersed in a copper Yessel containing water. The two wires of the cable, marked L C and E C, must be joined to the terminals similarly marked on the apparatus; the other ends are attached to the sinker. On lowering the sinker ornr the side an alteration in its temperature will take place, an<l if the key mrtrked K on the \?\7 heastoue bridge apparatus be depressed, a deflection of the spot of light along the galvanometer scale will announce the fact, the direction of the deflection showing the direction of the alteration, aud the amount of deflection its extent. The key should be held uowJJ a few seconds, and the permanent deflection only taken into account, a1-5 on first depressing the key a sudden throw of tbe galYanometer needle will al ways be produced by the electro-static charge of the mtble. The permanent deflection remaining after the cable is charged is that due to the difference between the resistances of the comparison coil and the sinker. If the temperature of the comparison coil in the testing-room is too high, the deflection will be to the left, i. e., the 01wrator's left as he faces the scale, and in the same manner a deflection to the right will denote that the temperature of the coil is too low. Illustration No. 48 shows the connect.ion of the sillker anrl its resista11ce coil witl1 the two insulated wires of the callle. 'rhe wire L C is connected with the upper Plld of the resistance coil i nclosed in an iron tu be with flanges and caps, 'While the otlrnr eud of the coil is soldered into a slot in the bottom cap. The other end of the cable, which will be of course E C, is soldered ag-ainst the holly of the sinker, thus connecting the end of the core E C to the earth. S. ·Ex. 77--58

RECENT DEEP-SEA SOUNDINGS OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST OF THE UNITED STA.TES.
By Lieutenant J.E.
PILLSBUR~-,

U.S. N., ARsistant Coast and Geodetic Survey.

DEAR Sm: In accordance with your request, I have to submit a general summary of the operations of the Coast Survey steamer Blake in the examimition of the Western Atlantic basin during the years 1880, 1881, 1882, and 1883. The cruise of the Blake, nnder Commander J. R. Bartlett, duriug tlie winter of 1879-'80, in the Caribbean Sea, was really the commencement of the s;ysternntic examination of the W est~rn Atlantic basin; for, in the development of the dividing ridge between the Atlantic and the Carib· hean, the soundings were carried outside sufficiently far to show the contours up t-0 2,000 fathoms from Barbadoes to Sau Doming·o, and, continuing, the passage between the Greater AntUles and the Bahamas was developed. The following year (1880) Commamler Bartlett sailed, May 27, under instructions dated May 12, indicating the points at which lines of souuding-R, dredging, and tern· Jleratures were to be ohtaineu. The lines were to be run about normal to the coast and extending from the vi1Ji11ity of Charleston, S. C., to George's Bank. The special object of the cruise was dredging, hut serial tempenitures and soundings were, of course, to be included in this work. A commencement was made with the line off Charleston, and this line re\'ealed at once the remarkable and unexpected character of the bottom. The first sounding and liaul was made in 142 fathoms, about southeast of Cape Jwmain. Aftet4'Mtis they steamed to tl1e eastward, taking frequent casts to find the depth at which it was desired to dredge, but, to their astonislrn1eut, the water would not deepen as they expected, and they had crossed the imaginary axis of tlie Gulf Stream before getting 300 fathoms at any sounding. In his report Commamler Bartlett says: ,"The bottom was hard coral rock, but the c,ylinder always brought up small fragments of coral. "'e found but very few traces of animal life on this bottom, but made good hauls on its edge. For 15 miles or more from the 100-fathom line we found a very strong current setting to the southwest. When the trawl was down we tailed in that direction and dragged at the rate of two knots without steam. ·when in the Gulf Stream we found the current to the northwatd and eastward 2.6 knots per hour. The water deepened east of the ~xis of the stream to 382 fathoms, but shoaled again to 337 fathoms. As the instructions received from the Superintendent were to confine ourselves to dredging, these soundings were not continued, but the stream was followed along its axis to the northwar<;l, soundings beiug taken every five miles," with the result that no depth was obtained over 500 fathoms until the vessel hatl reached a point off Cape Lookout. The following year it was determined to develop the bed of the Gulf Stream from the poiut of its de11arture from Florida Straits to the northward of Cape Hatteras, and {letailed instructions were issued, dated April 12, 1881, to Commander Bartlett. The lines were intended to be at inter· vals of about 60 miles, run normal to the general trend of the coast, and to extend completel,r across the area. swept by the Gulf Stream. It was originally the intention to obtain serial temperatures a.t certain intervals, but it was found that, in order to make perlect lines of soundiugs,
~

it was necessary to have the best of weather and to remain under the influence of the Gulf Stream current as short a time as })Ossible, and therefore it was unadvisable to do more than obtain the depth, the bottom-soil speeimen, and the temperature at the bottom and surface, and to leave the study of the intermediate temperatures to a future date. The lines run during tliis season developed a plateau extending fron1 Cape Hatteras to the B.ahama Banks, the depths increasing but slowly until al>out 500 fatlwms, after which the.r iucrease rapidly to the Great Atlantic basin, at a depth of between 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms. Commander Bartlett in his report of this season, after its completion, says: "The eighteen lines of soundings run normal to the coast from Jupiter Inlet, Florida, to Currituck, N. C., by the steamer Blake, and the observations taken by the hydrographic party under my command, give very interesting· data in regard to the physical features of the bottom of the ocean over which the Gulf Stream flows. Instead of a deep cbarmd, which has previously been reported, our soundings show an extensive ana nearly level plateau extending from a point to tlte eastward of the Bahama Banks to Cape Hatteras. Off Cape Canaveral it is nearly 200 miles wide, and gradually decreases in width to the northward until reaching H:i_ttems, where the depth is more than 1,000 fathoms within 30 miles of the shore. This plateau has a general depth of 400 fathoms, suddenly dropping on its eastern edge to 2,000 fathoms. The· soundings in the .strength of the current were all taken with the 60-pound 8hot sinkers, the time allowed for the sinker to reaeh the bottom being· less than one miuute to each 100 fathoms in depth. Most of the soundings taken each side of the steamer when not in strong current were taken with a 36-pound lead on the sounding wire, the lead being reeled back. * * * It will be observed from the bottom specimens that the course of the current can almost be traced hy the character of the bottom soil. On each side of the stl·eam the sounding cylinder brought up ooze. In the strength of the current t,he bottom was washed nearly bare, the specimens being small broken pieces and particles of disiutegrated coral rock. Tliis l>are portion was very 11ard and the sharp edge of the l>mss sounding cylinder came up very much dented and defaced. From ,Jupiter Inlet, witl.t the exception of the bare p:ut mentioneu, the specimens were a lig·htcolored ooze, composed of Pteropod shells with a mixture of coral sand. Off Charleston, where the plateau has a less depth than to the southward, the bare section extended the whole width of the stream. The Pteropod ooze extended onl;r to Charleston. To the northward of that point the specimens were of Globigerina ooze of a dark greenish tint." It would seem probable that the gef!eral cil·culation of the Arctic aud Equatorial currents might he ascertained by the character of the bottom specimens. In the Gulf Stream, the current was found to aYerage about 3 knots, but at times it was as high as 5.4 knots per hour. Temperatures were taken at the surface (the water being drawn over the stern) every mile, and at the bottom at nearly .every sounding. The surface temperature varied considerably with the weather; one day, which was calm, it Hen rose to g90, but the average was found to be not far from 330 between .Jupiter and Hatteras. The general a'"erage temperature of the hottom of the stream is 45°, and a little less on each, side. On the Charleston section it rose as high as 50° in 350 fathom~, but in a 500-fatbom bole on tliis section it fell as low as 38°. The thermometers were the :Miller-Casella self.registering pattern. The Negrette-Zambra, which depends upon th.e buoyancy of its wooden case to register, became so water-logged and crushed by tbe pressure, that it gained 10 ounces in weight; its specific gravity, therefore, being greater than the water, it failed to register correctly. During the early part Qf the following summer (1882), Commander Bartlett ran a line of soundings and temperatures from Block Island to Bermuda Islands and a line of serial temperatures from thence to Cape Hatteras. In the deep water near the cape the temperature when in the Gulf Stream was about the same as at equal depths on the Chaerlston plateau or in the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea, but farther to the north ward, where the stream is deflected to the eastward, and has room to spread out, the depths of equal temperatures approached nearer the surface. Lieut. Command~r W. H. Brownson succeeded Commander Bartlett in, July, and after l'lUllling

one or two lmes from Nantucket and from the Georges Bank across the Gulf Stream, engaged ill the work of developing the approaches to :N"cw York. The orders issued contemplated a surwy of the broad plateau of the Kew York entrance, from Block Island to Cape :'.\iay, and extcndiug seaward as far as deep water. One of the interesting features of the examination made during this season was the discovery that the spot hitherto known and shown 011 the Coast Surn~y charts as the 145-fatllom hole, was in reaJit,v a very much deeper spot, 474 fathoms haYing been fournl i11 it. At this date (June, 1883) the vesRP.l is engaged in complPting tile RurVe;\-, bnt the data will not be ready for final examination until next month. This is one of the many so-called boles which are found at irregular iutervals, extending from Sandy Hook. There seems to be another hole about !:.!00 miles farther ti) the southwest; its depth j,.. m·er 3,000 fathoms, the surrounding depth being ver;y mucll shoaler. During the past winter the Blake bas been engaged in developing the limit aud general character of the Great Atlantic Basin between Bermuda and the Tialiarnas, and along the outside of the West ~ndia Islands as far to the eastward a8 Saint Thomas. This cruise has been of great iuterest. The hed of the Westcm Atlantic is sl1own to have a general depth of about 2,iOO or 2,800 fathoms, aud so abrnpt is the slope that at some places depths of over 2,000 fathoms are fon11d almost, if not quite, in sight of the ii.;lmids along the outside of the Bahamas, and evt'n iu tl1e uarrow pai,;sages betwee11 them. In one instance the 2,000-fathom curve was found to approach the shore to within 21 miles, giving an inclination of the bottom for this distance of ahont 380, and for a part of the distanee it was found to be 450, Not the least gratifying point of i11terest in this crnise was the suceessfnl sounding taken at the depth of 4,561 fathoms, which, it is belim-ed, is the greatest cleptll from '\\]1ich bottom soil specimen and temperature have been obtained. The temperature was 36!c. Soil specimen, brown ooz Very respectfully, your8, J. E. PILLSffUI~Y, Prof.

G. S. COAST AND GEODETIC St:RVE'.', San Francisco, Cal., Ja1111ar:11 Hl, 1880. DEAR Sm: After computing the r~entral line of totality of the solar eclipse of .January 11, J decided to occupy the triangulation station of the Coast and Geodetic Surrny, .Jlonnt Santa J,ueia, about 5,700 feet elevation, in latitmle 3G 0 08' 20 11 uol'th arnl 1011gitude 121° '.!4' ilO" Wl'8t of (.}reeuwich, and l;ring 35 miles southeast from Point Piuos. This station iis only 1:.? or lti mih·s from the coast line, but. is separated from the mountains immediately overlooking the Rhore by the dce11, narrow valley of the San Antm1io, which ftows southward to join the Sali1ms Rin~r tlowing to the northward. There is another mountain on the Coast Haug(~, lying near the path of central totality, about 10 miles farther to the wr>;twaril an<I i'i,ooo ft'et P1evatio11, lint it is Wt'll-11igh i11acce;;sili1e. 011 the triangulation reeounaissauce it i;; kuow11·as Cone Peak. Although the ascent of Santa Lucia Mountain is somewhat !litlieult, I was ver,Y well satisfied with the selection and the advantages whicl1 it afforded. In this work the party com1isted of Assistants Gilbert and Colonna, 8ubassistant Die kins, myselt', my son, and fmu hands. Otu outfit was of the Rim11lest e1mmeter, although we expecte1l Hnow and heavy weather at that elevation and season. The instruments were: Equatorial, 6i1-6 inches (with star i;pectroscope), portable observatory, cannts dome (Ueorgc Davidson). Hassler equatorial, 3 inches, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Zenith telescope No. 1, 2i inches, United States Coast antl <leodetic Surn~y. Meridian instrument No. 1, 2t inches, canvas observatory, United States Coast au<l Geodetic Survey. Reconnoitering telescope No. 24, 2~ inches, United States Coast awl Geodetic Sun·ey. With chronometers, sextant, barometers, thermometers, solar-radiation thermometers, binoculars, &c. Professor Frisby, from the United States Naval Observat-0ry, asketl my tt<lYice in San l~ran cisco about the best location, facilities, &c. I freely gave him all the information I had, and as bis funds were very low, and he II.ad no camp outfit whatever, I invited llim to occupy the ~ame station, and promised that we woul<l carry his instruments, &c., with otlrS, he bearing a proportion of the general expense. He aooepted the proposition. The Southern Pacific Railroad, through Mr. Bassett, ordererl C\'Cl'J' facilit;y to be granted my party in the transportation of the instruments, &c. Through the active kindness of H. M. Newhall, esq., of San l!'raneisco, I was enabletl to obtain transportation by t-Oams and animals aml the services of his ma,jordomo, Mr ..Fancher, to moYe from Jolon to the base of Santa Lucia. · Mr. Colonna, with Professor Frisby, examined the approaches to the mountain, and after a

second examination by Mr. Colonna the best available trail was chosen. It is very steep and rough, and the total rise is about 4,000 feet in threi> or four miles. ·when station is occupied for the triangulation the trail can hfl zigzagged in some of the steepest rocky places. At Camp Milpitas (latitude by sextant 36° 0;)' 54") which the wagons reached, we kept the pack animals, on account of the senrity of the weather and the necessity of getting fodder from .Jolon. The summit of Santa Lucia is in two peaks, about 200 yards apart, with a saddle or depression of :!O fret between them. The eastern one will doubtless be chosen for the triangulation; we chose the western one for the eclipse work as affording ns pl'Otection for the tents and a near supply of fire-woocl. Mr. Gilbert secured the ba8e for the large eq natorial, and assiste<l in mounting it. Mr. Colonna. with Mr. Dickins prepared the block arnl ohsening tent for the meridian instrument which was used for transit ohservations and for latitmle. 'Yith the !'mxtai1t I obsen-ed for latitude, but the heavy weather came upon us before the iustrnmeuts were fairly 111ountt·tl; fierce winds, rain, sleet, and snow making everything very uncomfortable. The temperature 1rns mostly below freezing, and upon one night, wheu Mr. Colonna was ollsen-ing, thetbennometer reconlell lq 0 , with a bitter north wind blowing. vVhen we first reached the nwnntain tbe ea.rth was frozen to a depth of 6 inches, which increased before we left. But the weather cleared up ou the aft,eraoon of the 10th, and Stmtla;v (the l ltb) opened clear and cold, with the temperature at 15° and a stiff north wind. To this time Mr. Colonna had determined tlle errors of th·' chronometpr.s by transit observations, ancl also the latitude hy two nights' oh8ervations upon s(·n-11 pairs of Rtars. "'hen opportnnity afforde.d, I ha<l ohRrrve!l for time arnl latitude with the

Of course I dett'rrnim·(l to look fol' intra.mercurial planets, and had five star charts preparecl for the purpose, one for each obserYer \Tho studied the relath-e position of the probably visible .-.tars. The equatorial zenith telescope and meridian instrument would have given absolute 'posi· tions, had such ol~jects beeu detected. Diagrams were prepared upon which to sketch the corona, rose-colored flames, &c. As the computed tiuw of totality was onl;y 332 seconds, the chances for our doing much in either of the last two scheme8 were infinitely small; nevertheless I felt sure of doing something trm;tworthy.

I had taken with me two chronometers; obtained tb.e use of a third from Professor Frisby; used pocket chronometer Widenham 900, and a watch. All were compared by Mr. Colonna before, during, and after the eclipse. Mr. Colonna had good transit observations, and a good determination of the latitude which I had, by sextant observations, placed in 36° 08' 20", and from the reconnaissance sheet in 121o 24/ 3011 · Sunday, January 11.-The morning was remarkably clear and the atmosphere very stearlr, with a cold and moderately strong wind from the north. Temperature 1:)0 · No clouds were YisilJle except a low bank about half a degree higher on the western horizon. The instruments were all in position on the western side of the summit, and protected from the wind to prernnt vibration. As the time of first contact approached I gave warnings at 5, 4, 3, and 2 minutes before the computed time. Each observer watched to see if he could percefre the moon's disk before it touched the sun; but it was not seen. The limb of the sun was not_ absolutely steady, but nearly so, and sharply defined. The three clusters of spots were well made out in all the telescopes, although some of the indiddnal spots were very minute; the penumbrm were well marked and defined; the mottled appeamnce as of rice grains was visible over the whole disk, and the faculre readily traced in all their irregularities. There was no spurious disk such as arises from great atmospheric disturbance, but there was just enough atmospheric tremor to give au occasional shivering to the border. There was no disturbance of the limb at the point of first contact. I was using a Herschel prism solar eye-piece that permitted most of the heat and light rays to -pass directly through the eye-tube, whilst the eye-piece was at right angles to the optical axis. The position circle was not constructed to fit this solar eye-piece, and therefore I had to estimate tl'e position on the sun's limb where the moon would first appear. I saw the first indentation when it was about the apparent thickness of a coarse spider thread in the eye-piece, and noted the time, which was, I think, before that of anybody else. As the moon :\.dvanced I noticed the time of disappearance of the umbrm in each of tlie groups of spots. These were also observed by the others. As the m()on's disk advanceLl with a well-defined outline apparently broken by lunar mountains, the sun's cusps were very sharp and clear, but wlieuever a tremor occurrerl on account of any·slight atmospheric disturbance these cusps were apparently doubled. This phenomenon was also observed and recorded by Mr. Colonna. It was not owing to want of parallelism of the colored glasses, for when the atmosphere steadied the cusps were single, sharp points. llad the atmosphere been much more disturbed the points of the cusps would have appeared coufosecl aud bluuterl, as Assistant Rodgers observed them at Oakland. This duplication of the cusp is shown on an exaggerated scale in Fig. 1. During the progress towai-ds totality I called the observer's attention to the fact that there was a perceptible difforenoo in the darkness of the sky adjacent to the sun's disk yet unobscnred, at A, compared with that immediately adjacent and still coverell by the moon's adrnncing disk, which projected beyond the sun's disk at B. And yet none of us had been able to detect the moon's disk before it touched the border of the sun. At 50 minutes after commencement I noted the "sun much steadier, cusps sharp as knife point, limb of moon sharp." At one hour after wmmencement "the limb of the moon steady enough to see the lunar mountains near apparent right cusp" (CJ, which I was then examining (Fig. 2). The irregularities of the lunar outline could be detected wherever an examination was made, the mom clearly when no shiverings or tremors affected the disk. Towa.rds totality a few cirrus clouds formed on the line to the sun and the atmospheric disturb. S. Ex. 17-59

ances were at times increased. As totality rapidly approached the crescent of sunlight was remarkitbly long and narrow on account of the slight difierence of the apparent diamt>ters of the two disks. To illustrate this I lmYe made the accompanying sketch (Fig. 3) to reduced scale, exhibiting the shape of the crescent at 3 minutes 30 seconds before totality, and at 12 or 13 seconds before the total phase commenced. At the bottom I have exhibited the moon's disk when projected upon the sun about ten seconds after the commencement of the eclipse. The last line of sunlight was from 300 to 400 in length before it broke. But this long, .narrow crescent exhibited no distortion from atmospheric disturbances, and no wavy movement, except, occasionally, that slight tremor which I have designated as "shh·ering," and which is seen at times in geodetic observations. The cusps, before the crescent wa8 reduced to a line, were remarkably sharp and curved points, as if cut by the finest grayer. The breaking of this last line of sunlight was occasioned by the intrusion of tlrn lunar mountains and inequalities; and it presented the appearance of a line of dots, dashes, and spaces. There was no wayy motion to interfere with this exhibition; whenever a bright spot or dash disappeared it was gone for good. As in my observations upon similar phenomena in the eclipse of August 7, 1869, the atmospheric conditions were so favorable for steadiness of image that the "Bailey's beads" were totally and wholly wanting. I did not remove thi> colored glass in observing this contact, as I had done in 1869, because I wishe(l to preserve my e;res for any possible intra-mercurial planet. But immediately upon leaving ·the telesco11e I saw that, on account of the small diameter of the cone of shade, the brightness of the corona, and probably the effect of the light cirrus cloud, the illumined atmosphere rendered the sky too bright to see any stars or small planets, and I fixed in my mind the position and size of the rose-colored flames and especially the first circle of bright light around the sun, whilst others sketched the outline of the corona (Fig. 4). There was a brilliant rose-colored flame just at the left of the sun's vertex; aud the lower part of the moon's disk-say, one-third of the circumference-was apparently bordered by a remarkably brilliant and continuous line of rose-colored flames. The upper flame was between the one-tenth and one-twelfth of the sun's diameter in height; and the lower border of flame was about the oneeighth or one-twentieth of the sun's diameter in height. The first concentric ring of white light around tlie sun was strikingly bright and extended one-tenth of the diameter beyond the disk. Mr. Dickins noted this and also a second but fainter concentric ring. The corona had the general form of a parallelogram with the angles prolonged in the directiou of the longer sides, and stretched at an angle of about 350 with the vertical, from the upper left to the lower right. The accompanying sketch is a near copy of the sketch which Mr. Colonna and. m;yself made immediately after totality; the parts drawn by Mr. Colonna marked with a 0; those by myself with a D. The parts marked (a) were much lighter than the other parts of the corona. The outline and general features of the corona are quite consistent among the observers, wh!lst that of Dr. Gustav Eisen, near Fresno, is equally consistent. In addition to the originals I shall endeavor to have prepared a specially colored sketch. Two of the observers, Messrs. Colonna and Dickins, distinctly saw the changing appearance of the corona at its most extended points, which seemed to contract and lengthen rapidly; a phenomenon·similar to what I observed in the comet of August, 185.3. Messrs. Gilbert and Colonna observed the time of the third contact, although not with con· fidence. Before totality we all saw the shadow of the total phase coming over the ocean as a brown area on the surface. After totality I saw the shade of the retreating cone against the eastern sky, but could not see the shadow upon the distant mountains, which were too dark. This shadow had not the density and impressiveness of the shadow coming down the valley of the Chilkaht, Alaska, where it was visible on the flanks of the mountains and against the snow gorges. After totality the sun was for some time behind a cirro-stratus cloud, and the steadiness of the atmosphere was disturbed. The disk of the sun only came from under this cloud a few minutes before the fourth contact, whilst below the sun lay the cloud bank, which had hung on the horizon all day. This cloud was 35' above the horizon. Here the atmosphere was in a remarkable sta.te of undulation, and the limbs of the sun and moon moving in great rapid waves, so that it was next to impossible to note in the smaller telescopes precisely when the moon left the sun.

The following preliminary tabulation will give an idea of the times obHerrnd by the different observers.

Jupiter and Mars were seen by the observers several minutes before totality. No stars were seen by any observer. At Soledad and at Oak Grove the sun was visible at the greatest obscuration; but Senor Villegas informed me that where he was, about l~ or 2 miles south of Soledad, there was a point of the sun about as bright as Venus, visible about 300 or 400 to the right of the vertex. At Oak Grove, about 1! miles sonth of Soledad, there was a slight line of the sun visible. 011 the southern limit, at Lowe's stage station, the sun was visible, and at Jolon a very thin line of the sun was visible. I have written to get nearer limits for the southern line of totality. At Fresno, I interested Dr. Gustav Eisen to go to the line of totality where it crosses the Southern I>acifi.c Railroad; and Dr. W. H. Harkness, of the California Academy of Sciences, reports that he went with the party to Sycamore and witnessed the phenomena. ·The phase of totality was not visible at Fresno on the southern side. I extract the following description from Dr. Eisen's letter to me: "The totality was not seen at Fresno; but following your ad vice I had gone to Borden, a station on the Southern Pacific Railroad about 10 miles north of Fresno. The totality here lasted exactly 31 seconds, and I suppose I was pretty near the central path of the shadow. "Shortly before totality I suddenly saw the western edge of the moon's surface lighted up by a reddish light, displaying the convex and mountainous surface in a most extraordinary manner. This vanished,however, at tot.ality. The atmosphere seemed perfectly quiet, 'and no disturbance or tremor of the limbs was visible. At totality the sky around the sun was entirely free from clouds, but so lig}J.ted up by the corona, or by somet.hing else, that there seemecl little prospect of seeing any intr.a.-mercurial planet. The appearance of t.otality was, to use the faintest language, grand. "I had my paper prepared according to ~·our instructions, and ma.de a rapid sketch which I inclose herewith. The second aooompa.nying drawing was made after my return home. The

red, rosy, and purple flames around the. lower left border of the moon, covered, at the beginning of totality, about one-fourth or one-fifth of the borcler, but increased rapidly, and at the end of totality they cove.red about one-third of the moon's circumference. Just at the apex I saw an immense p;yramidal flame of yellow, very brilliant light, and also a much smaller one at the right horizontal edge, also of brilliant white or yellow light. (Fig. 5, without color.) "The corona of radiated white, pale light extended from the upper left side to the lower right. · · · The extremities of the corona I could follow to about one diameter distance from the sun. Judging from the shadow of the moon, which we saw passing over the Sierra, the diameter of cone could not have been much more than ten miles." Dr. Harkness informed me that the shadow was very distinct because the Sierra was covered with snow, and that it passed like the shadow of a cloud. I. P. Moore, esq. (vice-president of the California Academy of Sciences), observing the eclipse at San Rafael, reports that at commencement he saw iridescent colors at the part of the sun first touched by the moon, but that they immediately disappeared. As a spectacle, this eclipse in some respects exceeded, and in others was inferior to, that which I observed August 7, 1869, in Alaska. Here the rose-colored flames and inner circle of white light were perfectly glorious, and the corona was more brilliant, but the disk of the moon did not stand out with that blackness and perspecti\re effect which I saw on the Chilkaht. This might be in part the resnlt of interference by the cirrus clouds. The sky here was much brighter on account of the closeness of the apparent diameters of the sun and moon. The shadow on the ocean was a poorly defined brown area; in the valley of the Chilkaht the coming of the shadow on the mountain flanks and over the snow gorges was more distinct. Near Freimo and at Millerton the shadow was seen coming over the San Joaquin plains, and after totality the shadow was very beautifully distinct on the snow-covered flanks of the Sierra Nevada. This eclipse affords another confirmation of the theory which I have before reported, that the exhibition of'' Baily's Beads," the "ligament" and "black drop" in transits of Mercury and Venus, the projection of a colored star on the moon's bright limb at occultation, and similar phenomena, are the conse"l_uences of atmospheric disturbances occasioned by irregularities of refraction, etc., which create spurious disks of the sun, moon, and planets. This view, when first insisted upon, was strongly controverted, but we have analogous phenomena exhibited almost every day in the geodetic obserrntions of the Survey. At high isolated elevations, and during a remarkably steady atmosphere, whether dry or moist, at any elevation, all these abnormal conditions vanish. I may mention here, that whilst at this station the zodiacal light was observed every evening when tlle weather was clear. It was distinctly marked, and stretched up to an elevation from 4° to 6° higher than Jupiter, and from 40 to 50 to the right. The base, at 6~ or 7 p. m., was about 120 broad, and the inclination 100 from the vertfoal to the left. I inclose special reports of Assistants Gilbert and Colonna and Subassistant Dickins, with their sketches; also second sketch of Dr. Eisen (Fig. 5). The origin.al records for time, latitude, and the epochs of commencement, etc., together with the original sketches, will be duly transmitted. Yours respectfully, GEORGE DAVIDSON,

This gives for the lo~itude 121° 23' 40", to which must be added 1' 02" for determination by telegraph longitudes, so that we may provisionally place , Station Santa Lucia in latitude 360 08' 40"; longitude 1210 24/ 40''. A closer approximation to the longitude could doubtless be made by computing the tria.nglea of the reconnaissance from Mr. Eimbook's measures. · G .. D.

PREFACE.

In order to determine the proper motion of stars, a comparison of modern places with older ones is necessary. Bradley's observations, reduced by Bessel to the mean epoch 1755.0, have principally been used up to this time for the proper motions of northern stars. At the instance of the director of the observatory at Pulkowa, and with the approval of the Russian Go\Termnent, Hr. Anwers has now undertaken a new reduction of these observations, and the publication of the results may shortly be expected. ,Jolrnson's Catalogue for1830 of St. Helena has heretofore served for southern stars south of declination-.,-30°, excepting for a few stars obserYed by I'iazzi up to -45 o and reduced in bis catalogue for 1800.0; there are also available the few but excellent observations made at tht~ Cape iu 1833 by Henderson, and the observations made (about 1840) at Madras by Taylor, which reach to declination - 70°; finally, we ha\Te La Caille's obserYations at the Cape, as reduced by himself to 1750.0. Up to the preRent time no thorough revision has appeared, although the inaccuracy of La Caille's reduction and the utter unreliability of :the observations have been pointed out in the "Viertel-Jahrschrift" of the Astronomical Association, and by Stone in the latest observations at the Cape. In 1845 the British Association published a catalogue of La Caille's observations of nearlJT 10,000 stars; the reduction was undertaken by Henderson, but was never C<?mpleted by him; besides, there was no account taken, in the fundamental de1:erminations, of the errors introduced by La Oaille, and there was added a not inconsiderable number of new ones, as shown by Argelander in " Investigation of the proper motion of 250 stars," vol. 7 of the Observations at Bonn, pp. 6, 7. In judging of the value of La Caille's observations, we have to distinguish carefully between his '' Astronomire Fundamenta," and his "l\Iicrometrical Observations." The former are almost of equal accuracy with those of Bradley, as shown in my comparison of the newly reduced northern stars (in Table I for the right ascension, and in Table II for the declinations). On the other band, the micrometric observations are certainly of very much less value, since each star place depends only on two transits over threads, recorded to the nearest whole second, and in these observations many errors occur, especially in cases when many stars follow one another at short in1:ervals. Neverthell;lss, a new discussion of the whole material might not be without value, although we cannot place implicit confidence in his micrometric observations. The observations of the "Astronomire Fnndamenta," upon the whole, have reference only to 400 stars, and in my opinion the declinations of the northeni stars can no longer be disregarded, but deserve to be placed side by side with those of Bradley. For their combination, however, to form a most probable result, I need more accurate information than is now in my possession. For the southern stars, south of declination-30°, we have no better material for the determination of the proper motions, or of a possible variability during the long interval of 125 years intervening between La Oa.ille and Gould (for 1875). 469

INTRODUCTION.

My object in undertaking this work was to bring to a clearer understanding the value of La Caille's observations as a supplement to the Bradley-Bessel results. I am fully aware that an intended revision of Bradley's observations will establish a newer and probably a better basis for the reduction of astronomical observations; it will, nevertheless, be an easy task to apply afterwards the necessary small corrections to my results, since thMe changes, not being very large, will certainly not act in opposition to the purpose I have in view. La Caille's determinations of right ascension at Paris by the method of equal altitudes I have entirely omitted, they having but little value in comparison with Bradley~s numerous transits, on account of the lesser inclinatio}> of the horizon to the equator. But this does not apply to southern stars at the Cape, whose right ascensions were determined by the same method by La Caille, of which only a few were observed by Bradley, with his transit, at Greenwich (see "Table I, A. R. app:-Culm."). The small number of observed zenith distances at Klipfonteyn and Isle de France, I have likewise at first omitted. That the determinations of right ascensions and declinations of stars resulting from my revision, may have lost part of their former absoluteness by being now founded on the total number of Bradley synchronous observations, could hardly be considered a disadvantage of the revision, as the polar point deduced from La Caille's observations of upper and lower culminations of Polaris agrees very nearly with Bradley's, while the equinoctial point (the initial point of longitude and latitude), from observations of La Oaille (the sun's southern limb was observed at the Cape only near both equinoxes), could not be determined with sufficient accuracy. In consequence of the large number of comparisons of declinations with Bessel's results. of Bradlc;r's ohser\·ations, the liitherto undetermined errors of division of Bradley's mural quadrant aud La Caille's sector and sPxtant have been nearly eliminated. La Caille used at the Cape, for the observations of equal altitudes, an iron 3-foot quadrant in com1ection with a 3z-foot telescope and a clock of Le Roy. The comparison of clock corrections in Table I proves clearly the superiority of the instruments as well as La Caille's ability in using them. Each of La Caille's observed altitudes was taken on two parallel threads. The column in Table I, headed "Culm. Clock-time," contains the mean of La Caille's obsen·ed clock times, cor· rected for the influence of the changes of temperature, and in case of the sun for the equation of equal altitudes. The differences of temperature were taken from a table (Dove) of the mean daily temperature for the Cape. La Caille gave the times only to half seconds, and, although the mean error in the mean of the culmination times generally amounts to more than 0".1, I have retained the hundredths in the reduction, so that this error should not be increased by the neglect of the second decimal. Column Z contains the number of sets of observed equal altitudes. Under the heading "A. R. app.-Culm.," followed by a column containing capital letters (the initial of the authority), is shown the difference of apparent right ascension and the observed culmimt;tion time, computed according to the respective authors. "H. 0." indicates Hansen-Olafsen'il solar tables; "A.," Auwers; "F.," Bessel's Fundamenta; and "T. R.," Bessel's TabulIB Regiomontanrn. From this column were deduced the clock correction and its hourly rate, also the corrections for apparent right ascensions of stars where no authority is found. The last column, headed "La Caille-N," shows the difference between the old and my new reduction of the observed right ascensions. The zenith distances given in La Caille's Fundamenta (pp. 161-209) for Paris (place of observation: College Mazarin) and at the Cape, "Distantia observata," are the results of direct measurements with a 6-foot sector and a 6-foot sextant, corrected for zenith point and errors of division of the arc. The least recorded errors of division amount to 3".3; for the sextant they were found worthy of mention only on three points: by Canopus (3".3) and by~ Doradus and oo Argus (511 .0). The sector, which comprised 51°, read, according to La Caille, in the zenith at College Mazarin (Paris), 26~ 23' 7".6; at Cape Town (Cape), 260 23' 10".0; at Klipfonteyn, 200 23' 1".0. .

east, a.nda out as many times with circle west (hence direct and reversed), and every observation is given in this manner. At _Paris the sector was connected on the left etlge with another 5-f'oot telescope, provided with a micrometer. ·with this telescope zenith distances could be observed. from oo to 500. The sextant of similar contrivance, comprising tao, and provided at the Cape with a smaller telescope (5-fo()t), perpendicular to the principal t.el'"scope (6-foot), was put in such a position that all zenith distances could be observed, either with one or the other telescope. Small weight is given by La Caille to those made with the smaller telescope, on account of the lesser power. For stars at low altitudes the refraction without special notice of temperature becomes somewhat uncertain; for southern stars, however, zenith distances are observed with the smaller telescope down to 67° 23' (/1 HJ·dri S. P.), and in general only for a few stars. The zenith point of the sextant, the divisions of which extended scYcral degrees lle;vond the zenith, was determined by reversing the instrument in the same wa~· as with the sector at the ()ape, as well as at Paris, u:· stars near the zenith. In Tables II, II,., and IV the names of these stars are underlined. To the zenith distances given b;r La Caille for the different dates under "Distautia obgervata," I have applied the reduction to the mean place of 1750.0* and the refraction corrected for mean temperature (from Dove's tables) and barometer.t For the observation with the principal telescopes of the sector aml of the sectant, near the zenith in two directions of the circle, I have taken the mean of the means of the zenith distances for every star, observed east and west, correctell for refraction and reduced to the mean place of 1750.0, and _for the remainder only the single means were retained. The probable errors of the single means are generally less than 1"; the differences, however, resulting from the means of the readings on the sector towards both sides, according to r,a Caille's statements (to the immediate readings La Caille applied the zenith point correction), are generally greater, an<l amount in some cases from 6" to 8"; these I have marked with(:) i for two 110rthern stars, where they amount to 10" with(::) i and isolated corrections with (r). Tb.e column in La Caille's Fundamenta, following that of "Distantia observata,'' contains his zenith distances corrected only for tb.e reduction to mean place and not for refraction, and a comparison with my compntati()n enabled me to find discrepancies of from 1 11 to 2", besides some greater ones, as in case of ' Lupi and a Doradus. This comparison, therefore, protected me from greater errors. More considerable, however, are the differences arising from refraction and assumed latitude. The I'ulkowa tables,'agreeing best with the more recent determinations,, give for the refraction, at 450 zenith distance, 57".9 ± i \i=correction for barometer and temperature), whilst La Caille, without regard to change of barometer and temperature, assumed for Paris 66".5, and for the Cape 64".9 (compare the table of refraction in La Caille's Fundameuta, p. 214). La Caille assumed his latitude at Paris to be +480 51' 29".2, and tb.at of the Cape - 33" 55' 1311 .3. For the place of La Oaille's observations at Paris, I used that given to me by the late Admiral Davis, +'18D Sl' 25".6. For the latitude of the Cape, I used -33° 55' 15".8, which value is derived from La Caille's newly reduced observations of upper and lower culminations with the sextant, from 4 stars with the principal and from 2 stars with the smaller telescope, giving the former double weight of the latter. Maclear, in 1839, found for La Caille's place of observation - 33° 55 1 1611 .1, a difference of only 0".3, which is of small importance. In Tables II to IVb, inclusive, are grouped the declinations (arranging them from north to south and with regard to instrument and place of observation) resulting from zenith distances, corrected for refraction and my assumed latitude, and reduced to the mean place of 1750.0. The heading gives the name of the instrument, place of observation, and a formula for the sum of the corrections.
.. The constants of the day for 1749 were taken from the "Tafeln znr Reduction von Fixsternbeobachtungen ftir 1726-1750. Zweites Snpplementheft der astrom.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The first column contains tlie name of the star, the following, the mean of the times of ob::1ervations, the third the mean deelinations for li50.0, without proper motion; then follows the comparison with Bessel's declinations, given in his Fundamenta (=Bessel±), and finally the correction (derived from the above formula) to the mean declinations as given in the main column. I have uot given the number of observations, but have marked isolated observations ( f1 before the result). Those so designated show but inferior discordances from other results of La Caille or Bessel. Two northern stars, a and s Cygni, are ohseryed but twice, the remainder, however, with few exceptions, five and more times (the unknown errors of division are decidedly larger than the probable errors of observation). As La Caille discovered a change in the reading of the zenith point in 1756, April 21, and in consequence thereof I assumed a change in the eccentricity, those mean declinations resulting from the zenith distances observed with the sextant at Paris are given separately in Tables II and II., retaining in this case also the number of observations; Table Y contains the united results of those observations with regard to the number of observations. During observations at the Cape La Oaille records also a change in the index correction of the sextant (using the· smaller telescope), for which he found it sufficient to apply a constant correction, which I have retained unaltered. With these two exceptions the positions of the instruments at one and the same place were assumed to have remained the same during the entire time of observation. A comparison of the old and new declinations in Tables II to IV", inclusive, shows by the sum of the declinations, obtained from upper and lower culminations of Polaris, that each result requires a correction nearly equal in magnitude and 1'ign to the difterenee of La Oame's and Bradley's determinations. According to a comparison of '1 ables II and II,. with Bradley-Bessel, all declination observed with the sextant at I>aris require for stars north of the zenith a positive, and south a negative correction, generally increasing from north towanls south. The sextant observations at the Cape show that the declinations in Table 1V require in general positive corrections from 27° to -10° of declination and negative corrections for stars observed ii\ both culminations. According to the comparison with Bessel in Tables III and Illa for the sector at Paris, the declinations require nearly equal correct.ions, as obtained from the sextant, only somewhat larger for greater zenith distances both north and south. At the Cape the observations with the sector and sextant placed the stars north of the zenith Jess north, and stars south of the zenith less south. Thoi"e discrepancies just mentioned are in general far greater than can be attributed solely to errors of observation and errors of division, but they may be assumed to arise from the uncertainty in the correction for eccentricity, aml perhaps ahio from flexure of the circle, and of the telescope. ~'111, however, become eliminated by the determination of x and y in x siu o+'IJ cos ci from the observations, so that they agree among themselves almost within the unavoidable errors of observation. Assuming that Bessel in his reduction of Braule;y's observations obtained these final results very approximately, I have determined by the method of least squares (introducing weights, according to the number of comparisons) the coefficients x and y from all the comparisons (Bradley. Bessel) in Tables II to IVb separately for the different sets of observations at Paris and at the Cape; at the place last mentioned, I have also introduced 4 circumpolar stars observed in both culminations with the principal telescope of the sextant, for a more accurate determination of the sine coefficient. La Caille's observations at the Cape with the smaller telescope of the sextant comprise an arc of 154°; the comparisons with Bessel I could unite into two groups, and a third I obtained from the stars near the south })Ole, by the comparisons given in Table IV,. under "P" with the corrected results obtained from the sextant (using the principal telescope). After the solution of the normal equations the results of the three groups agreed very well. The observations with~the sector at the Cape comprise an arc of only 460, and compariaons with Bessel can only be made for stars observed north of the zenith at the Cape ; south of the zenith I had only two comparisons with the corrected results of the sextant at the Oape, which are those of Canopus and 'Arre. The observations of Canopus, made with both instruments, a.re quite numerous; for the sector, the .reduced zenith distances, taken east and west, agree; and

those for the sextant are corrected for a division error by La Caille. After the application of the corrections the declinations of these two stars with both instruments agree very well, and lie near the southern limit of the arc of the sector. In fact both limits seem to be well determined. The more frequent and greater discordances between La Caille and Bradley, near the zenith at the Cape and near the horizon at Greenwich, are probably dne to the uncertaiut~· of Bessei· Bradley's position. Table V is a recapitulation of declinations of stars finally reduced from Tables II to IV b' inclusive. In the heading are found the name of the instrument and the place of obsen·ation by the following designations: Cri CP,, and C0 for the result of the sector observation8 at Paris and at the Cape, respectively (accented letters refer to the small telescope of the sector, and unaccentt:',d to the principal), and by X similarly for the sextant. The declination is only giYen complete in the first column following the name of the star, and in following columns only the seconds of arc are retained. Under the heading (a) are found the right ascensions in arc, to the nearest minute, for an easy identification. Then follows under" Bradley" Bessel's declinations for 1750.0 of Bradley's observations, taken from the catalogue of Bessel's Fundamenta; next, under "La Caille,'' the mean value of the declination as deduced with the difterent instruments at Paris and at the Cape. (Results obtained from an average number of observations with the principal telescope have the weight 2, and isolated observations with the principal telescope, or any number with the smaller telescope, the weight 1; I have taken this as a general rule, altl10ugh I would ham decided differently in some instances.) The next column gfres the magnitude of the stars, taken from La Caille's catalogue; then the mean yea.r of observations with regard to weights; and the last column contains the sum of the weights according to the above rule. Table VI, the catalogue of southern stars from -300 of declination to tbe south pole, is arranged according to right ascension, and giYen for 1750.0 as well as for 1830.0, rnsiug Bessel's constants of precession, without regard to proper motion. For the catalogue referred to 1750.0 I ha,·e given the corrections to be applied to La Caille's catalogue, and for 1830.0 the difference ,Johnson La. Caille. The catalogue for 1830.0 ma~· also sen·e for a comparison with the catalogues of Henderson (few but accurate positions, and near that epoch), Brisbane, Hm11 ker (these n·duc. tions, I regret, are not now at my disposal), and also with Taylor and l\fa.clear. Even a new reduction of Bradley's observations would not materially alter the present fun. damental catalogue for 1750, and therefore this catalogue may sene for a has is of a new reduc· tion of La Caille's micrometric measurements of numerous stars contained in "Crelum australe stelliferum." For illustration I ba_vc added a few examples of m;v reduction of sextant, and sector obserYations, together with La Caille's computation. I have to remark, according to my reduction, the uncommonly large errors of observation a.ad the difference between the results derived from morning and evening observations with the sextant at the Ca.pe, by the series of a V irginis, given here in the examples. However, the sector observations of this star agree satisfactorily. S. Ex. 77-60

REl'ORT ON THE PRECEDING REDl'CTJON OP LA CAILLE'S OBSERVATIONS. By Prof. C. II. F. PETERS.

From the middle of the last ecutur.r dates the modern art of observing, which requires us to analyze theoreticall,Y the instruments userl, considering them as a complex of lines and circles, whose positions hs aa rqit arrangement of tbe observations t.11emseh·es are then referred to the fundamental points and planes of the heavem;. Bradley and La Caille mark this epoch. 'l'he star place;; ohser,·e<l b~· Bradley have thus become the foundation, the terminu8 a quo, for comparison with the moderu observations, which the,y still to-day almost equal in rank as to accnrac,y. Next to Bratlle~· was La Uaille, the most skillful observer of the age. But, while the former disprnwd of tlre royal lllea!ls of the Greenwich Obse1Tatorr, the latter, less favored by circumstances, had to content l1imself with a small ohserrn.tory erected at the Collt\ge l\Iazarin. Nevertheless, with the immense imlustry be is said to ha Ye possessed, he succeeded in making star determinations comparable in accuracy with Bradley's, though of conrse much fewer in number. In the mean time he obtained the adYantage (>Yer Bradley in one point, rntmely, wl1en the occasion was offered to him to examine the Southern hemisphere. Here, at the Cape of Good Hope, besides the measurement of an arc of the meridian, the determination of the parallax of the 2\Ioon (in conjullctiou with Lalaude at Berlin), the first application of a proper method for obtaining the sohtr parallax (hy ohservations of l\Iars in conjunction with Wargentiu's at Stockholm), the obseffation in zmies of 10,000 stars between the south pole and the tropic of Capricorn, La Caille determined, with particular care, a m1mhPr of principal stars, which to Brad le~-, on acconnt of lriio; northern position, were im·isihlc. These (leterminations starnl to tl1e sonthPr11 portion of the starr~· heavens in the same relation as llradley's to the northern, allll form tlw starti11g point for resear('hes on 11ro1wr motion of tile southern stars. But, t<J he \I-holly tl\'ailal1le for this 1rnrpose, a rn.redrwtion with the mnployment of modern constants was 11eede1l. \Yhile Bradley's ol1servations Jiave had the goorl fortune of being discirnsed and elaborated b~- the master-lmml of Bessel, now precisely sixty years ago (Bessel's :Fundameuta were ptthlished in 1818), fot Caillc's han· hitherto remained in the same shape to which tlie author liimsclf reduced them. The cabtlogue pnblished by Baily, in the fifth Yolume of the l\Iemoirs of the Royal Astronomical Societ.r, is nothing lint a rt,print of tlre catalogue in La Oaille's 11 Fundamenta Astronomim." The long-deo;ircd work of a new reduction, accomplished hy Dr. Powalky, lies now before us iu manuscript, together with the lahorion;; computations appertaining thereto, which allow of au examination of Dr. Powalky'i:; work in detail. ·From the remark8 that precede, defining La Caille's situation, it will l>e perceived that the principal result (though by no means the only one) of J>owalky's work is the new catalogue for the epoch 1750 of the stars, 150 in number, between the south pole and - 30° <lecliuation that were observed by La Caille repeatedly with two different iustr1uuents, a ().foot sector and a 6-foot sextant. For investigating the errors of these i11strumcnts, for finding the pole or zenith points, for as~crtainiug the clock rate, the influence of refraction, &c., it was not sufticicut nor feasible to treat those southern stars separately; it was necessary, 011 the contrary, to take up together all the stars obsen·ed in the same night. Dr. Powalky lias extended his enmpntation still further, upon the ohscnations made, b,v the use of the same instruments at tlre Uolleg(· Mazarin, so that the reduction now comprises all of La Caille's fundamental determinations (excepting only the few made at Klyp Fonte,yn, the northern terminus of l1is arc, and at the lsle de Frauce). The uew reduction of the northern stars, which admit of comparison, gives a favorable idea of La Caille's obserYations; the declinations especially appear uot inferior to Bradle_y's. U ufortuuately La Uaille's solw- observations are imperfect, so that the equinoctial point, when derh·ed therefrom, remains lH1certain, and Dr. Powalky consequently has a8sumed it, in congruity with Bradley'8 ob;,;enatious. This seems, under the circumstances, the best way to proceed, though La Caille's right ai,;ceusions thereby cease to be absolute, and may in no wise be used in a researcl1 :ibont the precession coustant. The declinations, likewise, in their final form, had to umlergo a correction in a manner empirical. For, after the obsen,ed zenith distances had been corrected and reduced to mean

declinations for the epoch (beginning of 1750), the latter, when compared with thm;e of lle::;sel\; Bradle~-, showed systematic deviations, which, perhaps, nmr be attributed to defeets of l,a Caille's instruments that cannot now be ascertained. But whate>er be the canse, whether an eccentricity, as Powalky inclines to think, or an irregular shape of the pi,·ots, a fiexnre of the telescope, a faulty length of the graduated arc::; (the errors of diYision strictly 81) called were exami11e<l by La Caille himself, and we find them noted in the '' J<'uml. Ast."), tlle first terms of a periodical serit·1-1 seem to represent well the deYiations. I>r. Powalky, therefore, assnmiug the form .i: siu o+11 cos o, ddermined for each instrnmen t and for each series Heparatel~·, tlle coefticients ,,. and y by the method of least squares. For the Cape, for this purpose, tlle compariso11s witlt J:rmlley were nsed i11 combination either with some stars observwl both iu upper antl lower culmination, or with certain zenith stars ol1sen·ed in both po>iitious (face east and west) of tlie sector. The nltimatP instrumental col'I'ections, computed hy these formulas, iudeed bring La Cailk's tlecliuations i11 elosp harmony both among themselves aml with Bradley's. Another proof in favor of the new reduction is the value found by l'owalky for tlw latitudt> of La Caille's station at Cape Town. \\' e owe to the exertions of Sir Thomas ::\laclear thP discO\·ery of the exact spot where La Oaille's instrument had been situated, and Maclear not ouly connectPtl it b,y a triangulation with the Hoyal Obser>atory, but made upon the same spot (or qL1ite near it, so that any influence of the mass of Table Mountain upon the plumb-line was the E<ame ), two series of ob. sen·ations with the 12~-foot Bradley zenith sector, sent out from Greenwicli for the nritieation and extension of La Uaille's arc of meridian. For the latitude of La Caille's observatory thus follows: By geodetical connection with the Uoyal Observator,Y ................ -33 55 li.;)fr· By the amplitude from the Royal Obserrntory measured witli Bradley's sector, :m stars ............................................... -::;; 55 15.iW By I)oWltlky's new reduction from La, Caillc's observations ......... -3:: :;;; 1;;.s La Caille himself used for the catalogue in the "Fund. Ast.'' . . . . . . . . _;;3 5'1 13.;) The agreement between the second arnl third valnei,; is surprising, arnl. thongh, in part certainly accidental, speaks well for La Caille's accuracy in obserYing, as at the same time it gi,·es testirnon.'· in fayor of the new reduction by the improvement in representing th(\ oh:<t'n·ations. In the reductions of the Paris obserYatiom; Powalk.v hmi used the latitude 48'.J 51 1 25".H, as com. rnnnicated to him by the late Admiral DaYis. The obsen·atory of the Collt'·ge .'.\lazarin is stated (Conn. de Tem1is · ·) to be 17 toises em;;t. aml 118!1.5 toises north of tht· "CH1serYatoin' Imperial." \Vith Bessel's dimensions of the ellipsoid the lcttter number equals l 1 15 11 .0H. and tht> latitude of tlw then Imperial Obsen·atory is 430 50' 11".3::1::lV'.05 (Ast. ~:ich., No. lO!t;)J. The more correct Yalne for the College Mazarin, therefore, seems to be 48° ,il' 26".4. The difference, howeYer, is of little consequence; it is included, besides, in the ultimate empirical correction to the declinations that has been already referred to. Through the present reduction, La Caille's observations have received a treatment that they long deserved. The care that has been bestowed upon the work by Dr. Powalky makes it a final one· For it is not probable that it will ever need to be repeated for any reasons simil:u to those that have ]eel to a re-reduction of Bradley's observations, now nearly finished by Dr. Auwers. For a discussion of that character La Uaille's are not fundamentally sufficient. The catalogue of the 150 southern stars Powalk.r has gi,'en for two epocbs-1750 and 1830the places brought down to the latter epoch with Bessel's constants of precession, without reganl to proper motion. The difference from Jolluson's Catalogue, tllerefore, may be taken as the amount of proper motion in 80 years, considering- that Bessel's precession is nearly true.t As all the stars in question have now been reobserved at itfolbourne (Catalogue for 1870) arnl at the Cape of Good
·I have here substituted for tho latitude of the Hoyal Obserrntory the value adopted as the lateHt, and motit prob. able by Mr. Stone (" Result8 of Ast. Obs. llla1le at the Cape of Good Hope, 1R74, page XIX), which iH ahont. one-quarter of a second greater than that used by Maclear. Also, 1 have taken for the amplitude the mean resnltin~ from all the at.ars observed with Bradley's sector, while Maclear BtJlects 16 of them, viz, those the propllr motion of which ho could derive from La Caille's (older) positions (see l'ln.cfoar's work on the Arc of Meridian, Vol. I, p. 3C, and Vol. II, l'· 438).

t Tho extra.ordinary proper motion Powalky fimls for a Fornacis (or 12 Eridaui, as the Htar now isusnally calle<l)
arises from a mistake of tm malle in writing the R. A. for 1830.

Ilope (Catalogue for lSflO, and "Observations," 1872-'7H), it would ltayc been as well, perhaps, to take the year 1870 for the later epoch, whereby the iuterval would ha Ye beeu increased to one hm1dred and twent~- yearn. The column of diffonmces between La Cailles Catalogue in thP "J1'nnd. Ast." and th11 new reduction shows that the COITPctions are cm1,;;iderable, not only those of the declinations, but also of the right ascensions. That tile sign of the correctiorrn in right m;cension for nearly all tlle stars is the same (negative, or La Caille's right ascem:ions too laq1;e) is a significant fact that has a hearing upon man~- reReareli!:'s. For example, tlie re:-;ult of .Mr. Gallowa,y's attempt to determine the motion of the solar :-;ystem in space from soutl1ern :-;tar:-; (Phil. Tran:-;., 1847) will need a Uiorongh modification. Furthermore, tlH' catalogue of La Uaille's principal t:1tart-:, as now prepared by Powalky, was a work necessary to pn·eede a ne'i> reduetiou of La Caille's zones, if this ever should be undertaken· Tlw zone catalogue of !l,7j)(i :-;tan;, e1lited hy or under the auspices of the British Asl-iociation, iH, as .Argela11der has already remarked, looi,;el;v prepared, and dop:-; injustice to La Uaille'8 skill as au observer. Since all these star8 (or rather all of them lying south of - ;);i 0 ) have h!:'ell determined with great accurac.r in the last six years lty the }leridian ( 'ircle at the Ca11e of Good Hope umlei· .Mr. Stoue's direction, these recent detcrmiuatiom;, toge! her with l'owalky's Catalogue, would furnish the elmuent:-; to l'igoro11sl~· inve.'ltigate aml to eliminate the errors of the micrometer employed h,r La Caille in the zones, and hence to produce an improYed catalogue of the zone stars for 1750. The foregoing exposition lias made it clear, I hope, that the work of Dr. l'owalky is a \'cry valuable contribution to science. The cmuputations inYolve a great amount of labor. An examination of them, as far as it could bo doue, has shown that the~, are made with the author's custo· maQ- care and uircnmspection, and j 11;;;tifies the n1Hlersigned in recommending a remuneration from the National Academy.

IhmscnEL, RE., Bre1·om·t House, ~Yew l'ork: l\fy DE.AR Sm: In ptmmance of my letter of yesforday's date, I will uow submit t-0 you tlw proposition that, as Superintendent, &c., I im·ite a.t once, or at ,rour earliest con\·enience, a eoTJfereTJce ou graYity observations, the participants in which would bt\ beside yourself and Peirce, Newcomb, on the part of astronomy; King· an<l Powell, on the part of geology; and DaYidson aml Schott, on tlie part of geodesy. During such co11terence the greatest rm1ge of discuHsion would of course be in pl:we, but, its outcome, I conceive, mnst necessarily be formulated in a few proposi· tions, some of which would be mainly mtended to recite the scientific objects arnl usefulness of such work, and commend it to public patrouage, others, t() 1lefine the degree of accuracy to be attaint>d in the observations, in order to entitle them to be rauke<l as contrilrntions to science. All neither ;mu nor ourselves are charged with any special powers in the premises, it appears to me that no other useful results can be reached by a couference than some such public declamtiorn:i, the Yalue of which rests upon the standing of the party makiug them. If this proposition meets your viewH, I shall be happy to make suclt arrangements for t.he earliest lfaJ" you may fin<l counnient. I regret that it will be necessar~· to tax you with coming to " a~ltington, as all other parties are lwre, arnl being officially engaged it won Ill he out of our power to meet you elsewhere. It will be well if you 1vill formulate in advance such expressions of opinion tts appear t,o )'OU desirable in the premises, in order that after comparing notes we may be alJle to submit propm;i. tions that will readily meet the a,ssent of the conference.

E. lllLGAIW: )ly DEAH Sm: I am Yery gfad to learn that yon are well inclined towards the idea of a coufereuce, aud that now, in fact, it rests with me to indicate when I can be in \'\ashington for the purpose. As it is uot a matter which presses until yon have is~med i11Yitations, when of course it should not be delayed, and as it will be "·ell to giYe a few days' notice in any case, I will not consider myself in any way required to hasten my departure from New York, l!ut only to giYc you as early an indication as I can when I can undertake to be in \Yashington. At this moment I am not in a position to say iireciNely, lmt it will almost certainly be within a week from this date. I shall most likely be able to lean this city about ·w ednesday next. \Yith regard to the lines of discussion, it must depend to some extent on the degree of publicity which tlie proccefliug·s would h:we. It is not to be denied or concealed that there is coming into existence a certain rivalry betweeu what may be called the German and the English schools. I am anxious that the former shall not wrongly claim American adhesion on the one band, and on the ot!Jcr that American opinion shall not be wrongfully interpreted as favoring the German system. "\Vi th reference to this last, for instance, I have just recei\~ed the following from l\I. C. \Volf, in the course of a reply to my Washington letter: " J e vous felicite vh·emeut cle vos travaux sur le pendule, et surtou:; d'avoir pris une autre voie q ue celle dans laquelle les Americains se sont lances, {t la suite de:; Allemamls et des Suisses, .J'ai en ici de vives discussions avec l\I. Uh. Peirce au ;;11jet de se:s experieBces <ffec le pendule renrsible de Rcpsold, instrume1Jt qui me parait construit dans de deplorahles conditions de stabilite." Now there is .inst enough truth in this to make Olle regret the misapprehen8ion as hi the American position. But so long as ;your survey uses a re,·ersible pew1ulum 7 without some very distinct statements a8 to the principles, such misapprehensions will continue, and the Germans will <le11y that the Americans stand b~· the differential method. I hold it to he a ,·er.)' lamentable thing that men of zeal, eager to a<lYance science, should eontirnw to be mi1;led by the old school of physics into launching upon the difficult a11d precarious enterprise of absolute determinations of gra,·ity, generally in iguora1we of the real difficulties of the rm;earch, aud alway.~ indifferent to the ntilit,Y of such determination. The German school is responsible for this. 'l'liis brings before us prominently the question of utility, a question which has a.lways been i:;hirked or disposed of by common-places, devoid of any real force. I know this through ha Ying urged (for nearly tweut~· j·ears), very much in \'ain, the views which I hold at this day, and which I now see gaining ground so slowly. I sum it up in the broad statement that 1l'e do actually know the mean figure of the earth as well as ice can know it so long as the irregularities which deform it remain unknown. It is not the force of gravity which we seek, but the irregularities of the surface. Now this is one of the points on which, at a conference, I should wish to find unanimity, if it is tn~e, or if not, theJ.t a better and more indisputable dogma to take its place. \Vith this as a foundation, the quei:;tion bPcomes one of ways and means to study the irregularities with all \"autagc. IIere there i8 great room for difference of opinion. What can he done depends on the cost, in its most general sense, of doing it. Absolute measurements arc indefiuikl;r c()stl,Y, and may he put aside. Differential measurements, also, are frightfolly costly, if conducted :u; I ha\·e lwen conducting these; but I have bad in view to pro,·e incontestably that results of practical n1lue can be obtained with a tenth, perhaps a twentieth, the labor that I deYotcll to them. All depends on the method. Another point involved in the question of utility is, as yon say, as to the <hlgrne of precision demanded. All stations of obseryation should be recognized from the first as belo11ging to one of two categories-either they are point.Y d'appui or they ai·e not. Iu the latter C<tse the precision demanded is governed by the degree of irregularity which experience teaches as governing the quantity measured, the distances which separate the points being taken into account.

degree of llredsion is iilainly needless (for points of the second order) if tlley are widel_y scattered, whereas if a nnmher of snch 11oi11ts are crowded in a small area, their precision ought to be higher llecau8e of the information to be gainetl hy iutor<comparison. Points of the secoud order witlely scattered llan uo pre1>eut Yalue otlwr tlJau as indicatiug tentatiwly tile <h·gree of disturbance. From this point of vi<>w there would seem to be an adnrntage in placing the stations always in pairs so as to imlicate the Yariahility as wt·ll as tl1e nriation. I mmit now go further. Scientific obseffatiou 11as two distinct aspects. Viewed in one wa.r, it is seen as a means of Ji velihood, as an intellectual eujosment, as an employment, as a pursuit worthy of recognition and encouragemeut, for ernry reason except tllat of its ultimate utility. Viewed in the other way, it is a source of expenditure and a drain upon the arnilable power of the time and country, which can only be justified if it attains useful ends in a reasonably expeditious way. For myself, I doubt if I could couscientionsly recommend the expenditure of public money on pendulum observations on the ground of their utility; although 1 could and would recommend it for pendulum experiment~, having for their object to iucreai:;e the facility of obs~·rrntion; for I imagine, as things now stand, the prospect of ohtaiuiug re.snits in Rnflicient. number and frequency to enable us to study the irregularities snccessfnll~- j,., nry remote. You will doubtless recognize in this the ground of my inability to offer m>- senices, hacked b.r hopes of support from the British Go>ernment, for the prosecution of differential work on this continent. But I ba,-e no business to press such considerations on other people, nor to bring them forwaru at a conference~ except incidentally in discussing the propPr distribution of stations and the degree of precision demanded. The same arguments and motfres liad a successful campaign in dictating my latitude work in India; and there is room for their application in the present C<tse. They point out the urgent need for t·conomy in every detail of installation and observation-in tile choice of stations and the bnihling8 to be occupied, in the diBtrilmtion of time to be taken up b,y the observations, aud hy the calcula. tious respectively, RO as to get, in short, as many results of a sufficient degree of accuracy, and no more, as possible within the year. All this, and much more, seems to me to be im'oh·e<l in the uroa<l question whether or not pendulum research can lie satisfactorily carried on with a view to stnd_yiug- the ea rt h's irregularities. Another phase of this question should deal with the distinction between a study of tlrn large a1Hl of the small irregnlarit,ies. 'l'here is a \·ast difference between such work as that of l\Ialaspiua, of Preycinet, of Sabi11e, of Foster, of J,iitke, arnl of all Lhe other explorers; a!lll tllat of Kater in England, and of Base vi in India. 'l'he work before you here has or may have the charac1,ers of both; for the vastness of your disposa.ble area Jemands a large plan, while the numerous opportunities for prosecuting minuter internal exploration require more special consideration. The degree of precision to be aimed at must be gonwned partly by what we kuow of possible variiitiou aud partly by what the instrnments are capable of. Here, as iu other branches of reRearch, we should bear in mind that there is almost always a point in the Reale of precision where it becomes questionabfo wlietber it wonld not be wiser to change the whole system if higher precision is wanted. Below that point there is no difficulty. Aborn it the pric(·, to be paitl becomes onerous. You will readily perceive that I fully recog-nize, as one of the chief subjects upon which discussion should turn, this of requisite precision. At the same time 1 doubt if it c:tn be discussed to much ad\'antage by those who are not intimate with the figures actually to hand. I would therefore avoid the ve.vata qumstio of probable errors and keep to principles. It is lly the latter alone that plans of operation can be goYerned reasonably. "Frequency to be preferred to acmiracy ," for example, is a principle eass to limit or extend aR may be detiirell, and far more widely intelligible ·to the uninitiated than any specification in figares suited to certa,in categories of C<tses. Above all we should aim at being intelligible. Without that tlrere will be no outside interest a.nd no support,

UNITED STA'rEs UOAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

SIX REASONS FOR THE PROSECUTION OF PENDULUM EXPERIMENTS. By C. S.
PEIRCE.

1. The first :scientific object of a geodetical survey is unquestionably the determination of the earth's fig11re. Now, it appears probable that pendulum experiments afford the best method of determining the amonut of oblateness of the spheroid of the earth; for the calculated probable error in the determination of the [Jnantity iu questiou from the pendulum work already executed does not exceed that of the hest <letermination from triangulation and latitude observations, ancl the former determination will shortl,Y he co11siderabl~' improved. Besides, the measurements of astronomical arcs upon the smfarn\ of tlw <'arth ('over ouly limited districts, and the oblateness deduced from them is necessarily largely affectc(l, so tl1at we cannot really hold it probable that the error of this method. is so small as it is calculated hy least squares to be. On the other hand, the pendulum determinations are subject to 110 great errors of a kiud which least squares cannot ascertain; they are widely scat.tere(l over the surface of tl1e earth; they are very numerous; they are combined to obtain the ellipticit.y by a simple arithmetical process; and, all things considered, the calculated probable error of the oblateness derluced from them is worthy of unusual confidence. In this connection it is very significant, as pointed out by Uolonel Clarke (Geodesy, p. ·vi), that while the value derfred from pendulum work has for a long time remained nearly constant, that derived from measurements of arcs has altered as more (Iata have been accumulated, and the change has continually heen in the direetion of accord with the otlwr method. It is needless to say that the eomparison of the expense of the two methods of obtaining this important quantity is immensel;y in favor of pendulum work. :!. Uecent investigatious also lead us to attach increased importance to experiments with the pendulum in their connection with metro logy. The plan of preserYing and transmitting to posteritJ· an exact knpwledge of the leugth of the yard after the metallic bar itself ::;hould lrnve nuder· gone t>nch changes as the vicissitudes of time bring· to all material objects, was at one time adopted by the British Gonrument. lt was afterwards abandoned because pendulum operations had fallen into desuetude, and because doubts had been thrown upon the acc11racy of Kater's original measure of the length of the secoud'H pendulum. Yet I do not hesitate to say that this plan should now be revived, for the following reasons: · First, because measurements of the length of the second's pendulum, although formerly subject to grave uncertainties, are now secure against all but \Tery small errors. Indeed, we now know that the determinations by Kater and his contemporaries, after receiving certain necessary corrections, are by no means so inaccurate as tlley were formerly suspected to be. Secondly, metallic bars ha,·e now heen prornu, by the investigations of Professor Hilgard and others, to undergo unexpected spontaneous alterations of their length, so that some check upon these must be resorted to. To this end the late Henri Ste. Claire Deville and Mascart constructed for the International Gcodetical AHRociation a metre ruled upon a sort of bottle of platin-iridium, with the idea that the cubie contents of this bottle should be determined from time to time, so as to ascertain whether its dimensions had undergone any change. I am myself charged with, and have nearly complet~d, a very exact comparison of the length of a metre bar with that of a wave of light, for the same purpose. X either of these two methods is infallible, however, for the platin-iridium bottle may change its three dimensions 1111eqnally, and the solar system may mo\Te into a region of space in which the luminiferons ether may have a. slightly different density (or elasticity), so that the wave length of the ray of light used would be different. These two methods should therefore be supplemented hJ· the comparatively simple and easy one of accurately comparing the length of the second's pendulum with the metre or yard bar. Thirdly, I do not think it can be gainsaid by any one who examine::; the facts that the measurements of the length of the second's pendulum by Borda a.ud by Biot in Paris and b;r Bessel in Berlin do, as a matter of fact, afford us a better and more secure knowledge of the length of their standard bars than we can attain in any other way. So also I have more confidence in the value of the ratio of the yard to the metre obtained by the comparison of the measurements of the length of the second's pendulum at the Kew observatory by Hea\isicle in terms of the ~'ard and by myself in ~erms of the metre than I have in all the

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

507

elaborate aud laborious comparisous of bars whieh have been directed to the same end. I will even go so far as to say that a physicist in any remote station could ascertain the length of the metre accurately to a one hundred thousandth part more safely and easily by experiments with an ·invariable reversible pendulum than by the transportation of an ordinary metallic bar. A new application of the pendulum to metrology is now being put into practice by me. Namely, I am to oscillate simultaneously a yard reversil>le pendulum and a metre reversible pell· dulum. I shall thus ascertain with great precision the ratio of their lengths without. auy of thos1' multiform comparisons which would be necessary if this were done by tlie usual method. These two pendulums will be swung, the yard one iu the office of the Suryey, at a temperature ahon; 60° F., wllich is the standard temperature of the yard, the other nearly at oo O., which is thr standard temperature of the metre; and thus we shall have two l>ars compared at widely different temperatures, which, according to ordinary processes, ifl a matter of great difficulty. The knife-edges of the pendulums will be interchanged and the experiments repeated. Finally, the yard pendulum will be compared with a yard bar and the metre pendulum with a metre bar, and last of all the yard pendulum with its yard bar will be sent to Euglaud, the metre pendulum with its metre bar to France, for comparison with the primary standards; and thus it is believed the ratio of yard to metre will be ascertained with the highest present attainable exactitude. 3. Geologists affirm that from the values of gravity at different points useful inferences can be i;Jrawn in regard to the geological constitution of the underl;ving strata. For instance, it has been found that when the gravity upon high lands and mountains is corrected for difference of centrifugal force and distance from the earth's centre, it is very little greater than at the sea-le"Vel. Cousesequently it cannot be that there is an amount of extra matter under these elern.ted stations equal to the amount of rock which projects above the sea.level; and the inference is that tbll eleYations have been maiuly produced by vertieal aml not by horizontal displacements of material. On the other hand, Mendenhall has found that gTa,·ity 011 Fujisa11, the well-kuown volcanic cone of .Japan, whicl1 is about 12,000 feet high, and which i1; saiu to have been uphean~d in a single night, about 300 B. 0., iR as much greater than that in Tokio as if it had been wl.tolly produced by horizontal transfer. This conclusion, if correct, must plainly have a decisive bearing upon certain theories of volcanic action. Again, it has long been known that gravity is in excess upon islands, and I have shown that this excess is fully equal to the attraction of the sea-water. This shows that the interior of the earth is not so liquid and incompressible that the weight of the sea has pressed away to the sides the underlying matter. But in certain seas gra\'ity is even more in excess than can be due to the attraction of the ocean, a8 if they had been the re1~eptacle of additional matter washed down from the land. It is evident that only the paucity of existing data preventR infer. ences like these being carried much further. On the two sides of the great fault iu the Rocky Mountains gravity must be very difforent, and if we knew how great this dift'ere11ce was we should learn something more about the geology of this region ; and many such examples might be cited. 4. Gradty is extensively employed as a unit in the meaaurement of forces. Thus, the pres· sure of the atmosphere is, in the barometer, balanced against the weight of a measured column of mercury; the mechanical equi rn:ient of heat is measured in foot pounds, etc. All such measurements refer to a standard which is different in different localities, and it becomes more and more important to determine the amounts of these difterences as the exactitude of measurement is improved. 5. It may be hoped that as our knowledge of the constitution of the earth's crust becomes, by the aid of the pendulum investigations, more perfected, we shall be able to estahlish methods by which we can securely infer from the vertical attractions of mountains, etc., what their horizontal attractions and the resulting deflections of the plumb· line must be. 6. Although in laying out the plan of a geodetical survey the relative utility of the knowl· edge of different quantities ought to be taken into account, and such account must be favorable to pendulum work, :vet it is also true that nothing appertaining to such a survey ought to be neglected, and that too great stress ought uot to be put upon the demands of the practically uiseful. The knowledge of the force of gravity is not a mere matter of utility alone, it is also one of the fundameµtal kinds of quantity which it is the business of a geodetical survey to measure.

'l'he force of gra,·ity is related in the same way to the latitude and longitude as the intensit~- or magnetic force is related to magnetical declination and inclination; and as a magnetical survey wouhl be held to be imperfect in which measurements of intensity were omitted, to the same extent must a geodetical survey he held to be imperfect in which the determinations of griwity had heen omitted; and such would lie t,Jrn universal judgment of the scientific world.

The conference was inYited by the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the purpose of eliciting au interch:mge of views respecting the utility and best means of prosecuting pendulum research in the inten~,.;t of science in general, and with especial regard to the future work of' the Coast and Geodetic Suryey. Major Herschel, R. E .. ha Ying e:x:presse<l his willingness to favor tlte meeting with his presence and give it the benefit of his gTeat experience in pendulum work, the time of meeting must be considered extremel,y faniralile. The following rough notes are offered with a view of i1tYiti11g- ditlcnstlion on :some poiuts considered of importance antl interest. Resrwcting- the questiou of' tlte utility to geodesy and geology of pendulum work as bearing on the figure and density of the earth, it is fmfficieutly answered hy the resumption of this work in recent years in the lea<liug go\rernment surn'.rn cnrnlucted in EuropP, Asia, and America; but in carr,ying on these operations ditlerent opinions continue to be helcl as to 1lir hest aml most ec0110111ical means both with regard to form of inf<trnnwnt and metliod of ohscn·atiou. It may be added that the results alrea<ly reached are in themsel\·es snflicit,nt to ;.;timulate the further prosecutiun of the work, since they nmder it almost certain that still more Yaluahle deductions may be reached. The pendulum work executed for some years past under the direction of the late Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey had for its immediate o~ject the study, theoretical and practical, of the best methods available, and to gather the results at nuions important pendulum stations in Europe, to bring them into strict eomparability, and to form a connected system which may be used for combination with similar operations commenced in the United States. l\fr. C. S. Peirce, _Assista11t, Coast and Geodetic Survey, haYing brought this work to a close in Europe,· its future prosecution at borne now claims renewed attention, both with re1-1pect to the economy and efficiency of the plans which it may be desirable _to adopt. The Yalue of the pendulum results depending largely upon their direct comparabilit;y and the geogwphieal extent, it would in the first place appear most desirable, in order to form a second and independent connection of the pendulum work executed on the other side of the Atlantic, to swing the American pendulums at the two stations, \-Vashingtou and Hoboken, just occupied by :Major Herschel with the ohl pendulums belonging to the Royal Society, and to add thereto at least one more American station in order to secure three stations of satisfactory accord between these instmments. It is, perhaps, the general opinion that differential measures are at present more desirable than absolute measures, since undoubtedl.r greater accuracy can be reached in the former and a greater number ma~- he secured with the same expenditure; indeed, the determination of the length of a second's pendulum is, in geodesy, of less importance than a knowledge of ratios of times of oscillation of an inrnriahle pendnlnm swung at stations ou a line selected for investigation. The determination of the kugth of a second's peudulurn is quite a special operation, to be undertaken only at a base station. 'Vhile the mean figure of the earth may he considered as tolerably well known from the fact of the close approach of the rnlue of the compression as deducted from purely geodetic optJrations and

from pendulum work, yet this may he taken only as an encouragement for the joint prosecution of both operations."' On the other hand, our knowle<ige of the magnitude of the mean figure of the earth is, in the opinion of some, not qui!.e as satisfactors, aud in support of this it mas be stated that the recent abandonment, in the Coast and Geodetic Surn"y, of the llesselian spheroid of reYolntion for that of Clarke, involving iu our latitude an increase of the radii Yectores between one-third and one-half of a statute mile, was no inconsiderable change; and though we cannot look forward to any future change of such a magnitude, the difference was sufficiently large to make itself felt in our ol>lique. arc lying along the Atlantic coast between )faine and Georgia. The combination of tlrn PernYian arc, the onl_y one in America as _yet worked in with the meridional arcs measured in the eastern hemi8phere, with the two arcs measured by the Coast and Geodetic Snnrey, Yiz, tlw Nantucket arc and the Pamplico-Chesapeake arc, showed a satisfactory accord (that is, within limits that may lJe explained by local deflections). This seems to 1n·oye that tht:>. curvature of North America does not sensibly differ from the curvature in the same latitudes of the eastern hemisphere; yet the conclusion is weakened by the fact that the Peruvian arc is extremely short, and, wlrnt is worse, is supported by but two astronomical latitudes, and that in a region where local deflection probably exists of an excessi>e magnitude. It is true the computed corrections to the two latitudes are small, and this might lead to too great a confidence in the assigned Yalue of tll<" magnitude of the eartll's axis. A remeasure and extemiou of this arc to bP supplied with a considerable nnm her of astronomical latitudes would seem to be a great desideratum, espe.cia1ly when '\Ye consider the important }lOSition of the arc, giYing it, so to say, undue leYerage in comparison with the position of other ares. It is not at all unlikely that the results of its remeasme and extension may lrnYe au important eftect on our knowledge of tlie probable uucertainty in the assigned value for the resulting· .mean figure of the earth. t This mean figure might he defined as that of a geometrical solid whose surface most nearly appreaches the equipotential surface of the mean sea lcYel, intersecting it so tbat the aggregate of the volumes above and below it ma,Y be equal ~1nd a minimum. It would he the o~jeet of geodes~' to trace out on this geometrical surface tlie boundaries of these areas, and to detRrmine their elenttions aboYe or depression helow it; iu fact, work out the actual irregularities with reference to this ideal mean figure. For pendulum research tlie region of the 1\iississippi Yalle.r would seem to he yery fayorable, both in f{~gard to its geological structure, as presenting broad features, and with respect to gradual changes in eleYation of surface between New Orkaus arnl our uortlteru bmmnar_y, near the fortynintl.J. parallel, the land rising; but, little a.hove 1,000 foet. Here a study of the Jaw of change of gravity with the latitude seems inviting. Supplementary t-0 the above line, the thirt,y-ninth parallel might be chosen for the study of the law of change of gravity with altitude, starting from the sea level and passing oYer the inconsiderable elevations of about 2,500 feet on the Appalachian range and the descent. t-0 the Missis. sippi Valley, we haYe tlie gradual rise of the great plains up to 8,000 feet, and next the lower Rocky Mountain plateau, with a final return to tlrn sea leYel. While on the first named line about ti or 8 stations might suffice, on the second from 1:2 to 15 ought·to be contemplated. Respecting the kind of peudulum mm1t suitable for difterential measures of gravity, there may be little difference in practice between the use of two invariable pendulums, the one to check the
·Major H1mscHEL. I do uot regard the agreement of geodetic ancl gravity figures an argument for tlw latter. I can never regar1l the geodetic fignr<', deriv(l(l from tlrn compariRou.; of the cnrvatnrAA of cert.a.in l1111d i1ortions only, as a true indication of a tigure which is two-thirds sea. There is every reason to regard the land curvatures as too great. t Major IIEHSCHEL. I should hartlly acl voe ate a remeasurement of the Peruvian arc as a 8tep towards a better determina.tion of tlie *arth's figure. It has the fatal disadvantage of position in a valley between vast mountainous tracts. Mr. PEIRCE. Major Herschel's objection to the important scheme of remeastiring the Peruvian arc would apply 1 il fortiori, against allowing tbat arc to enter into the determination of the figure. In my humble ,judgment an American figure of the earth, wholly from geodetic measurements on these continents, is so great.ly wantetl that it is the di1ty of this Survey to undertake it. Although tlte Peruvian arc is at present bad, I shonlu think that if ~ufficiently extended and provided with an adequate numher of latitude dot.erminations, tbe objection11 to it woul<l nearly dis-

other, and an unchang·eable pendulum of' a plain rod (of lenticular cross-section) having two :fixed knife-edges symmetrically disposed; the means for correcting for difference of temperature and for difference of pressure from respectfre mean quantities to be determined at a base station. Observations to be made in 4 positions (upper knife-edge, lower knife-edge, face front, and face back). The accord of the 4 results will fnmish a criterion for the unaltered condition of the pendulum. A reversible pendulum of outer symmetrical form may also be made to answer the purpose, pro>ided it be swung only with heavy end down (face front and back) and no change whatever is made in the supporting knife-edge or in any other part of the instrument. Two such pendulums would seem tlesirahle i11 or(ler to detect any change due to accident. "\Yith such a pendulum the correction for difference of i1res1:mre can be applied with gwater certainty than in one of the otlier forms. Respecting· the stand of the Repsold apparatus, experience has shown it to be unfit for the work, and stiffer support shoulcl be provided. If pendulums could be swung t11rough 24 hours the result could be made independent of variations in the clock rate due to the daily variation of temperature and presRure. The same standard time stars should be obsen-ed each night. For shorter durations of swing, sa,y for G hours on!~, this advantage might in a measure be secured either by making four fresh st.arts and thus continue the work during twenty-four 110urs, or if that he too laborious, to observe on the first day, say from 6 to 12 a. m. and p. m., and on the following day from 0 to G p. m. and a. m., and unite the results into one, or in general, for any station by a symmetrical distributio1f, of the swings on~r the tweut~' four hours. Time furnished telegraphically by an observatory whose clock is protected from changes of temperature and pressure will be preferable t-0 any local determination at a field station. Should the duration of swing be too limited for this scheme, night work may be recommended, with a set of transit observations just before and another immediately after the close of a swing, the same two sets of stars to be used each night and for several stations as long as practicable. Three days successful work at any one station may suffice, and about two weeks might be estimated for the time required for occupation duriug the best season. The observatory to be prepared by an advance party. The metl1od of coincidences furnishes all needful accuracy, but if, in the absence of a clock or otherwise, a chronometer be used (as more portable and less liable to injury), coincidences of the chronometer beat with the transit of the pendulum over a vertical line might be tried. The question whether or not it is advisable to swing in a vacuum chamber (say at a densit;y just below any that might naturally be expected at a place which it is proposed to visit) would seem to depend largely npon the time a pendulum can be made to swing advantageously. [f its sectional dimensions are such as to displace much air and require it to do much work against friction, the duration of swing may be so short as to demand the use of an exhausted receiver.

GENERAL REMARKS CPON GRAVITY DETERMINATIONS. By Major (now Lieut. Col.)
JOHN HRRSCllJ<:r.,

R. E.

The following propositions are from my point of 'IJiew, but seem likely to bey assented to in the main by other members of the conferenee. 1. Figure of the earth.- By this we imply the actual (or conceivable) continuous water surface as exemplified by the mean sea level; which surface may be everywhere nearly, though nowhere fully, represented by some assumed simple geometrical figure, such as an elliptic spheroid, to be known ad hoc as the mmn figure. · 2. Object of pmidulum reaearcli.-If we regard the mean figure as known, then the object of pen-

dulum research is, in the first place, to trace out the degree of separation eYerywhere subsisting between the actual and the mean figures; or, if it slrnuld appear that by a change of the mean figure there wouhl result a less degree of separation, then to ascertain, first, wlrnt should be the amount of this alteration, and thfn to trace out the residual separation. Bearing in mind the large body of past work, which has undoubtedly sufficed to indicate >ery closely what the mean figure is, it should now he reG"Ognized as more particularly the object of pendulum research to enlarge our knowl· edge of the irregularities of.figure rather than to aim at imprm·ing the mean figure; which after all can never be anything more than one of refaence, by which to describe the actual figure. :3. Exten.~ion of re8ertrch among the irregularities.-This is prima. frwie desirable, especially when geodetic Slll'\'eys are iu progress, or are certain to be instituted as ci\·ilization adnnces. But gra>irnetrical exploration in reg-ions which can neyer be reaclied by surYeying operations is of scarcely less importance. 4. As regards di.~tribution of stations of observation, there seems t-0 be nearl~· equal advantage in laying them out in a linenr serie11 at sufficientl,r close intervals~ or superficially scattered over a limited selectc'l area, with a dew to tracing ont the seetfonal or .~olid forms of the existing frregularities. 5. The absol1tte forCf~ of r1radty.-lf this also be admitted as an ultimate object of pendulum research, it must be remembered that it, can on!~· be determined for the wliole earth when the exact relation of the place of observation to tile whole snrfaee is correctly known. Jt follows that a precise knowledge of the absolute force of graYity for the earth as a whole is not at present attainable. There are, 1ieYertheless, reasons for uow determining, with all tlie prt>cision at present possible, the length of the seconrl'.~ pendulum at 1liffcrcnt places on the eartll's surface. 6. Reasons for proseeuti.n,q al1solntc deterininations.-Uegarding the local force of gravity as a constant, the length of a pendulum is a fm1ction of its rate of oscillation; or, in other words, its rate is a measure of its length. From tltis it fo1Iow8 that lengths, otherwise incommensurable, cttll be compared through their corresponding times of oscillation, becaut:ic wc ban; meaus (in the pendulum itself, for instance) of comparing together, with any desired degree of precision, these times. Tlrns, for example, the metre and the yarrl cau be compared by this means (as I understand) with greater precision than by the complicated sys~em of linear comparisons requisite to measure their difference in terms of each. 7. Gomtancy of gravity tnted against constanC!f of length.-This is another reason for determiuing with the utmost precision the length of the second's pendulum in terms of this or that standard. For if, in the far distant future, there should appear a concurrence of testim011y indicating change, it might he brought home to either of the bars, or eren to gr::wity itself; according to the eTidence. The absence of the requisite evidence in the past would be a grave reproach hereafter. 8. 'L'he inrariable pendulnm.-The impossibility of ascertaining the exact relation of any station to the whole surface, short of a ge.nr.ral knowledge of the latter, calls necessarily for such explorations as are set forth in Article 2. It is generally acknowledged that the differential pendulumof which the "in variable" may be regarded as the type-is best adapted for such work. The pattern known as Kater's has hitherto been without a rival; but any pattern will answer the purpose in which the principle of invariability-i. e., fixity of knife.edge and absence of all mornble partsis embodied. 9. Tke rei·ersible penditlum is recognized as ha Ying many excellent qualities; and is capable of being used temporarily as an invarittble pendulum. But its proper field is the absolute measure. ment for which it was designed; for if its knife-edges are interchangeable it is liable at any time to have its invariable character destroyed, either intentionally or accidentally. 10. With regard to the degree of precision to he aimed at, nothing very definit.e can be laid down, since it de1lends largely on the circumstances. A gross error in a solitar.Y arctic station, for instance, might be of little consequence, while an error of even a small fraction of a second in the difference between two central points would entail far-reaching consequences. V\Then the object is tentative exploration only, accuracy may well be sacrificed to expedition and frequency. And in general it should be remembered that the local disturbance 'laries with the change of site. What the rate of this change may be can only be guessed until data are obtained. A group of contiguous determinations of a low order of accuracy would always be more valuable than a single one of the

\"ery highest or(ler. A solitary station can contribute only to the gmieral problem of mean figure ancl will of necessity be ·itiated by the amonnt of the local disturbance, as to which there is no evidence. lf the range of such llistnrbanee on the whole of that pamllel were knowu, it would not be unreasonable to take one-fourth part of that, as the ra11ge of prolmhle error pennissiulc in the determination itself. Eniry eousitleratiou \Yhieh takes iuto account the existence of local disturbance points to the preference to lie gi\~en to frequency of distribution rather than accuracy of result. MoreoYer, it is uifficult, if not impossible, to estimate the probable error in any ease whatever. The histor,y of pendulum ouservation abounds with inexplicable contradictions and anomalies indicative of unknown causes of error; and hardly a single observer has ventured to estimate the probable error of his result. Practically, the question of precision is cut by a Yariety of circumsta,ntial exigencies; and it would seem best to le:ffe it at t11e discretion of the obserYer, or director of the work. 11. Other mode8 <!l re,~earch. -The foregoing indicates so plainly the need of tentati\"e exploration of a low order of accuracy that it is very much to be desired that some simpler means should be found of obtaining at least a rulle measure of the local deflection. Yarious statical modes have been proposeu, but none has yet shown a satisfactory test. That a "stathmomctm·"-a term (lesig-ned to leave nu touched the present use of'' graYimeter ''-will some day be invented is highly prolmllle. It might be, perhaps, the sooner if the very great need for it were more widely known, and if, at the same time, it were understood that its object would be served enm though it should fail to rival the pendulum in accuracy. .J. HERRCHEL.
}fr. PEIRCE. The conception which .Major Herschel has presented for the purpose of gravity determinations requires thorough study. Considered from a purely mathematical point of Yicw, it is certain that if we know the distribution of gravity ornr the whole earth, or enm o\·er :t large region, we can deduce corrections of the earth's radius vector. \Vithin !!0 8 of the station whose radius ·ector was to lie corrected an accurate knowledge of the residuals of gravity would be necessary, while beyond that point a rougher determination would suffice. Bnt whether thiR conception of the nature of pendulum work could be uRefully adopted at the present time, or until two or three tinws the existing num her of Rtations have been occupied, is a practical question in regard to which there is something to be said on both sides. The Yiews of Major Herscl1el, thougL. founded on known vropositions of mathematics, are so novel aud so far-reaching in their consequences that we cannot commit ourselves to an immediate decision in regard to them. But they offer much food for reflection and study, and I am quite sure that apart from the important service that :Major Herschel has done us in connecting the .American (and through that the contimmtal European) system of stations directly with the great reseau of the English work by means of the Kater invaxfable pcuduhuus, .American geodetical science is under great obligation to him for the suggestions contained in the paper he has presented to the conference.

II. 111 determining the compression of the earth's spheroid from the variation of gravity, it is bt~st, for the present, to reject all experiments not made with Kater's invariable pendulums. But the completion of .Major Herschel's history of pendulum determinations is greatly to be desired. l\Iajor Herschel thought tlrn limitation to Kater's invarial>le pendulum too narrow; and pointed out that it would exclude the work of Freyciuet and of Duperrey as well as a great part of that of Poster. Ill. The ordinary correction for continental attraction is vastly too great. It should be omitted. Major Herschel remarked: "Admitting this as a conclusion <lrawn from the facts, it must not be forgott-0n that this is nothing hut an il. posteriori dogma. I do not see how it can be lawfully acted upon, unless the assumption that it has a true it priori cause is kept continually in view as

X. Four classes of errors affect tbe ob::;erved period of oscillation, <ts follows: 1st. Those which are nearly constant throughout the work at any oue station. Such arise 1 for example, from the flexure of the support, from an error in tbc adoptHd coefficient of expansion at a tropical or arctic station, aml from other causes. 2d. Those which remain nearly constant for a considerable time, say an hour or a day, but which vary from day to day. Such arise, for example, from the knife resting differently on the supports on different days, from erroneous determinations of temperature, or from similar causes. 3d. Those which are continually varying throughout the observations. 4th. Those which arise from errors in the comparison of the iiemlulum with the time·piece. The first class of errors demand the most solicitous scrutiny. The other three classes may be distinguished by the study of the residuals of the observations. The third class i8 the most important of the last three. XI·. Further insight the nature of the errors is obtained by comparing the residu~ with

IN MEMORIAM..

OFFICIAL ANNOVNCEJlENT OF THE DEATH OF THE SUJ'ERISTESDEST OF THE
COAST AND GEODETIC sn:T'EY.

The Department mourns, iu the sudden death of Carlile P. Patterson, Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the loss of one of its most emineut and valuable ofliccrn. Mr. Patterson's death took place at his re.sidence, near ·washington, on l\Iouda;v, the 15th of .August. His efforts have been so earnest in the performance of the various dutiei; which have devolved upon him, that to his uutiriug prosecution of them the immediate loss of his life is to he attributed. With unbounded zeal and ceaseless energy, he pressed on without taking the relaxation which nature demanded. Carlile P. Patterson was born at Shieldsboro, Bay of Saint Louis, Miss., August 24, 1816. Ile was appointed a midshipman in the United States ~avy in 1830; served in the l\Iediterraneau Squadron, and in 1836 returned home, and graduated from Georgetown College, Kentucky, iu 1838. Having served as passed midshipman on the Coast Survey until 1841, he was again on naval sea service until 1844, and subsequently, as lieutenant, United States Nayy, bad cliarge of a bydrographic party on the Coast Survey for four years. In 1850 he took command of a Pacific mail steamship, and continued in that and other private business until 1861. He then returned to the Coast Survey as Inspector of Hydrography, and so remained until he was appointed Super. intendent of that work in February, 1874. Combining wide experience with great judgment, be was eminently successful in the conduct of the great national work under bis charge, and in bis hands its scope was greatly enlarged, anti its character as a general geodetic survey became fully recognized. That the iuterests of scieucc, which had been so carefully fostered by his predecessor, so far as compatiule with the objects of the work, were not neglected by Mr. Patterson, is attested by the fact that be received the honorary ,degree of LL.D., and was elected to membership in several leading scientific societies. Of the Light-House Board he was an honored and useful member, bringing into its discussions not only ripe experience, but particular and intimate knowledge of the points to be decided. Mr. Patterson was chairman of a commission appointed by Secretary Boutwell, in 1869, to examine into the condition of the Revenue Cutter SerYice, the report of which commission, made after some two years of patient investigation, was adopted, aud resulted iu a large saving of expense, and in a fourfold increase of efficiency. He was also a member of the commission, created in 1872, to examine and test life-saving apparatus. The report made by this commission was carried into effect with excellent results t-0 the Life-Saving Service. The personal character of ilte late Superintendent was such as to attract friendship and command esteem. Frank and truthful, full of g~nerous impulse, ardent in the cause he represented,

strict in the administration of his trusts, he secured the entire confidence of this Department and of the represeutatiYes of tlle Nation iu Congress. As a tribute to his memory, the office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey will be draped in black, and will be closed on the day of the funeral. WILLIAM WINDOM, Secretary.

ACTION TAKEN Al' THE OFFICE OF THE COAST ANJJ GEODETIC .SUJU'EY.

At a meeting of the Assistants and other persons employed in the Coast and Geodetie Survey, held at the Office of the Survey, on the 17th of August, upon the oecasion of the death of the Superintendent of the Survey, remarks were made by Assistants Hilgard, Cutts, Boutelle, l\Iitchell, Whiting, and Goodfellow, by Commander C. l\L Chester, United States Navy, Hydrographic Inspector, and by Samuel Hein, esq. The following preamble and resolutions were then unanimously adopted: ''The officers and members of the Coast and Geodetic Surve;y, assembled here to-day, desire to express their sense of the loss the work has met with in the death of Carlile Pollock Patterson, its Superintendent for the pltst seven years. "Mr. Patterson's appointment to the work as Superintendent was in recognition of his eminent ability and efficienc,y as Hydrograpl1ic Inspector, his deep and almost life-long interest in all that pertained to the service, his readiness and fertility of resource both in council and in action, and bis constant effort to uphold a high standard of honorable ambition among his associates. "These qualities were at once manifested when he assumed the great responsibilities of his position as the successor of Benjamin Peirce in the superintendency. It was a time of general commercial depression, when all appropriations were cut down close to, and often below, the point of efficiency. This was the case with the appropriations for the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the full powers of the new Superintendent were put forth to keep unbroken the organization of the work, knowing well that once seriot!Sly impaired it could with 'difficulty be restored. "This struggle the late Superintendent successfully maintained, despite every obstacle, to the

close of his adrni11iKtrat,ion, and his !leath took place at a time whm1 a brightt·r lll'o8ped appeared in view. "To put upou record their sense of his public snvieeK, the officers anrl mern hers of tlw Sun-py have adopted the following resolutions: "I. That in the death of Mr. C. P. Patt'lrson, Superintendent of the Coast aud Geodetic Survey, they deplore the loss of an upright man: an able aud energetic officer, and a sincere friernl. ':Ir. That they extend to the family of the latP Snpcrintendcnt their profomul f;yrnpath,\· iu the great calamity that has overtaken them.'' Mr. Hn,GARD said: We meet to gfre expression to our deep 1Semie of the great loss which we our1Selves ha\·e Ku::;tained, no less than Urn public service, by the sudden death of our late chief, Carlile P. Patten·on, Superintendent of the Coast an<l Geodetic Survey. There are few among us who can feel rnort' deeply than myself this unexpected severance of official and penmnal relation::'. My a1uiociatio11 with Mr. Patterson on this Survey began thirty-five yt·ars ago, wben I sailed with him from :Kew York to Mobile in a small schooner of which he was lieutenant commanding-both about to colllmence work in the Gulf of Mexico. That Yoyage aud subsequeut co-operation in the work of tlw Coast Survey eRtahlisl1ed intimate relations of personal friend shill, which werP sm;peruletl 011]~- u,v wide <livergence in the field of our operations. In the days of peace, when no opportunity of distinction appeared open to a lientPn:rnt in the Navy, the ardent enterprise of Patterson led him to cast his lot, during the great material den·lopment of our country consequent upon the addition of California to tl1e national domain, a,t; a commander of stearnship8 carrying that great tide of emigration; and subseqneutl,v, while i>en·ing· on the North Pacific line, in extending tbe new civilization to the shores of Columbia River a111l Puget Sound. After taking a prominent part in the great moYemeut of our population to the Golden State, be was recalled to his home by family ties, and, on the outbreak of the ci\"il war, found a worthy field for his varied professional acquirements in the direction of the h~·rlrograpldc work of the Uoast 8urvey unrler our former lamented chief, Professor Bache. Those wlw kuew Patterson well cannot doubt that, bad be remained in the service, opportunities for distinction then offered would have found him at the close of the war among the foremoHt officers of the Nav~-. Of Mr. Patterson's services to the Coast Survey, the occasion permits only the briefe:o;t recitalhis biographer must do him the full justice which his great merits demaIHl. While acting as Chief of H,vdrography he entirely remodeled that service by adapting the charader of the \·esscls and tl1e organization of parties to their special euds, thereby largely reducing expenditure. Ualled to the superintendency on the retirement of Professor Peirce in 1874, be was met b~· the ver5· difficult situation of having to maintain an organization which had gradually grown up out of the requirements of the. country against a g1·eat contraction of public expenditures. 'l'his condiliou of affairs has, however, happily proved to be only temporary. His success in rnaintai11i11g the scale of the Coast 8urvey under these adverse circmnstances, and in expanding the scope of the work according to the policy laid down by his predecesl!mr, so as to embrace a general geodetic survey of the country, will ever mark his administrative ability. During the }last eighteen years I have. been in almost daily association with our late chief, either as co-adviser with him of the Superintendent, or during the past seven years, siuce be himself 'b.eld that office, as his immediate executive officer. Ilis death, by none dreamed of as HO 11ear at hand, is a great shock to me, and in my estimation, is a loss to the Coast 8uryey and pnblic Rervice, which can be realized only upon a review of the influence which h(· has Pxercised 011 all public matters with which he was connected. But his death is too recent-my emotiou too deep-to permit me to say. more in appreciation of his career. His penmnal character always lixcited my admiration. Full of ardor and generous impulses, frank and truthful, rigorous iu t.lie pert'or111mme of duty, ~trict iu the administration of i1is trusts, wise in council, combiuing good judgment with wide experience, he was, truly, a great man.

other aunounciug his death. No previous warning of danger had reached the field-officers of the Sun-ey. Hasteuing on, with others who received the sad news in time, we have now each to express our personal and profound grief at the loss we have sustained. His previous experience in the working of the Survey, especially of one of its most important branches; hi;,; ability as an executive officer, and his sound judgment in all matters pertaining to the interest and progress of the great work under his charge, have been tested and proved hy i;e\ren years of successful administration. Those, however, more intimate!~' connected with his Qfficial life, can rel! of the neYer-e111ling interest and oversight which he gave to every detail, and with an intensity wllich, no douht, laid tlte foundation of the malady of which he so suddenly died. He was a faithful friend, a mau of the kiudest and most generous impuhms, gTeat decisinn of character, and full of energy aml lifo. 1'1.s such I have known him from early manhood, under tQ-ing circumstances in tl1e- early <lays of California, and as Superintf'ndent of the Survey. I deeply deplore his death. l{emarks of :\Ir. B01;TELLE: To all th~tt haR been said hen·, and to all that is stated in the resolutions offered, I most heartily subscrilJe. 1n addition, I desire to say a word on tlic personal qualities of the friend so suddenly taken from us. I sa.\· friend in the full meaning of the term. During my service of nearly forty ;years in the Uoast and Ueodetic Survey, we have had three most eminent, noble, and generous men to preside over its destinies. In every noble quf>lity, in his knightly scorn of subterfuge and meauuess, opeu or implied, in his kindly appreciation of every good thought or actio11, :Ylr. Patterson was ti.le full peer of hi:; great predecessors, Bache and Peirce. For his devotion to the best interests of the great work we all have at heart, we owe him a debt of gratituue, and we cherish his memory a8 we lament his loss. Mr. MITCHELL said: Seventeen year8 ago, wlteu Professor Bache was suddenly seize<l with the disease which caused his death, he cried, in his au~uish of mind, "Sentl for Captain l>atterson, that I may lean upon a strong man!'' .This call echoed along· our ranks most heartily, and we all felt that the man who could be depended np011 to support our great chief's failiug footsteps was l\Ir. Patterson. And wheu, ten years later, our much-loYed Peirce, wearied of the burden that had crushed his predcecssor, proposed to throw up his commission, Presicleut Grant sent for that same strong man that Bache l1a1l designated. The retirement of Professor Peirce was a serious disappointment to us all, for he ha<l filled us with the euthusiasm of his own genius am! widened all our paths. But we soon discovered that umler the changed conditions consequent upon the undiscriminating SJlirit of retrenchment that appeared in Congress, we were entering upon a troubled sea, where the peculiar strength of our new chief was required at the helm. . Mr. Patterson was strong in intellectual resource, aud strong in will; but, most of all, he was .vtrong in honest.I/. He believed that we should lirn and work in the light of day, and he felt confident that Congrei;s would support the Coast au<l Geodetic Sufrey, if it could see entirely through all it11 aims and all its purposes, and recognize that these were all genuiue and practically useful. He wa.s strotig in honesty, aud that strength had its base iu religious faith. He believed in God, and, therefore, in the ultimate triumph of good effort. More than this, he love<l his God, and was ready to abide His will. In any doubtful case, he used to say, "We must use no specious argument; we must never fight/or vict-Ory." To say that he was pure in life and pure in speech, repelling indelicacy by his own attitude, and prompting good thought and good action hy instinctive sympatl1y, is onl.v to repeat that Ji,e ioM strong in lwne.sty. But he, too, bas been crushed at the wheel, and some of us, who knew him best and loved him most, are full of remorse t()·day, remembering that even we, thougl1Uessly, suffered him to carry our burdens.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY. Mr. l'EIRCE said: lt is difficult to add to the words which han~ already hee11 spoken, or to charaet1·rizc rno1·e justly the administration of the chief whom we are all so smltlenly ''allP<l to 1110111·11. 011L· thi11g· 1 feel most keenly: It is that American science loses a great support arnl friend. l'erhaps this is hardly known to thmie who were not near him. His supninte11ue11e~· wa~ marked hy such great practical achieYetuen ts as the production of the Coast Pilot, aml by imp rm ements i!J innumerable details of the organization and running of the Survey. Yet, although he was not professedly a scientific man, under none of the eminent geodesists who had preceded hi111, was more stress laid upon the scientific branches of the work-to their extension, all(] to the pre cision of their execution. No one was 80 earnest as he to secure to the Survey the labors of me11 of purely scientific, and especially mathematical, attainments and abilities. It was not very loug ago that, in speaking to me of a nrnthPmatical discover~, by a ~·mrng- 111a11 whom he bad appointed to a position on the Snryey, he exprPssed his conviction of the importauee of having such minds ready at hand in the Survey to solve any problem which might arise. He had often said that; lint on this occasion he added, that nothing about the office which he held gave him such real gratification as the opportunity it afforded him to aid iu the development ot that kind of genius. For such rea8ons I feel t.hat in Pa.tt.erson's death the sci~nce of the "Otmtry has lost a staunch ally. I will not trouble you with my personal atllietion at the loss of him-a() et prwsidium et dulce deCY.s mewn." Never can I hope to find again so true a friend and so just a chief! Mr. GOODFELLOW said: Those of us uow present who knew Mr. Patterson as Hsdrographic luspector of the Coast Survey, and then as its Superintendent, can bear fnll witness to his zeal for the work, to his uuflaggiug energy, and to his persistent and untiring efforts for its advancement. Trained early iu the l1abit of command, a strict disciplinarian according tu naval methods, an advocate rather of the "fortiter in re" than of tlle "suaviter ·in modo" in his ideas of government, he strove to impress 11is strong personality upon every hranch of the service; and whereYer he saw his way clearly he hesitated not to take the responsibilit;y of action. The successive steps of his career are known to nearly all of us, aud we all kuow the high and exacting standard of personal service and devotion t-0 duty which hf' upheld, and to which be himself became at last a martyr. Be did not live, as doubtlesr; he would have desired to live, to see that da;y, 11ow, a8 we trust., not far distant in the progress of the Survey, when the gradual extension of its work ovel' the whole of the territor~' of the United Stater;, and itR stead~· advance to completion, shall be fostered by a hearty executive support, and sustaine<l by a, wise and liberal legislative policy. But he died, as perhaps he might have wished to die, hs a swift and sudden stroke, in the ver~· midst of his labors. Licutenant·Uomman<ler C. M. CIIES'l'ER, U. 8. N., aud Geodetic Survey, said:

Professor Rilgard bas spoken of our lamented chief' in his connection with the Uoaflt and Geo· detic Survey. I, as a representative of a large number of tl1e service who are necessaril;y ahsent, desire to express their full sympathy with the members of this meeting in their Aorrow at thi:s great loss. While only temporarily attached to the Survey, ~·et we of the NaYy, being impressed with Mr. Patterson's uniform kindness, consideration, and great assistance rendered n8, feel his loss in his double capacity of Superintendent and brother officer. Originally belonging to us, always con. nected with us by ties of loYe and friendship, he has ever tak~u the deepest interest in our welfare, and, as I have lon.g maintained, done more for our naval service than almost any man in it. We have lost a friend indeed.
