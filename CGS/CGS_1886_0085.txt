REPORT.

U. S.

COAST Al\"D GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, December 14, 1886.
l:::!IR: In submitting herewith, in accordance with law and with the regulations of the Treasury

Department, the report of progress made in tlie work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1886, I would ask the attention of the Department to a, few considerations bearrng upon the development wliich tlle work has received, and t!Je scale upou w Lich it sboul<l be carried to completion. (l) I<'rom 1844, when Professor Bache cuteretl actively upon his t1utit'f' as Superillten1lent of the Survey, till his death, in 1867, the work was confinetl entire!:> to the seaboard States. Voluntarj· testimony to its high scientific character, valnahle practici1l ]'e8ults, autl the· remarkable ecouom~· with which it was conducted was repeatedly given during this period b;y the best authoriti~ ut home and abroad. . (2) When the eminent geometer, Peirce, succeeded Bache in the Suverinten<lency, the need of a system of checks for the extended triangulations along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts l1y a transcontinental triangulation became more fully recognized. It was percei'fed also that this necessary connection between geodetic operations on opposite sides of the continent would iurnl\·e the <letermination of geographical positions in a number of States of the interior, and the desire that these States as well as those of the seaboard should share in the ad'\'"antages derh-ed from the Survey Jed to the adoption of the proviso contained in the act of .!\'larch 3, 1871, that the triangulation for this geodetic connection sboul<l determine points in each State of tlie Uuion which should make the requisite provision for its own topographical and geological sur,·eys. (:3) 'rhat this development of the work of the Survey was regarded as of great atlYautage in giving to the States interested a means of making trustworthy State maps, is shown by tlte fact that within eight years from the passa,ge of the act the Go,rernors of fourteen States had applied for aid in making State surveys in accordance with its provisions. (4) It is submitted therefore that the form which the work of the Coast and Geodetic Surrey · has of late years assumed is one that is the natural outgrowth of the needs of the country, aml of the increased and increasing demands, not only for accurate charts of the seaboanl, but also for data upon which the several States can base accurate iqaps of their entire territory. (5) Aml that as the Snr\"ey has a corps of officers trained by long experience to execute its work in the most tllorough and economical manner, it would be in acconlance with tlie dictates o( a sound economy that appropriations should be granted by Congress sufficient in amount to push forward the work to completion at an early date, and to employ to the best adrnntage the . t>rofessional skill now at the service of the Government. It was in pursuance of these views that au increase in the amount appropriated for foe fieldwork of the Survey was asked for the service of the present fiscal yPar. '.rhe estimates prepared on this basis met the approval of the Department. A similar increase is asked for the fiscal .)Par 1887-1888. The reasons for this increase which ha\~e been heretofore urged, and which are again stated in the Explanation of E~timates, will be found to be fully in accord with the desire of H.Ex. 40-1 1

UXITED ST.ATES COAST .A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Congress as expressed in its resolution for the appointment of a .Toiut Commission to consider the organizations of the scientific bureaus with the view to secure greater efficiency and economy of administration in the public service. Part; I of this Heport includes general summaries of progress in fiel<l and office work, and presents brief statements' of discoveries and developments made, and of special scientific work accomplished, during the past fiscal year. It couclndes with an explanation of tl1e estimates for tbc fiscal year 1887-1888 and a detailed statement of those estimates. Part II contains accounts of work done afloat .and ashore, compiled from the reports of the chiefs of field parties, and closes wit~ a summary of the operations of the Office during the fiscal year. Part III comprises the appellllices which relate to the distribution of the field parties, to the stafr;;tics of the work, and to information furnished from the Office; these are followed by the annual reports of the Assistant in charge of tlte Office and the Hydrographic Inspector, and by i;,apers which present some of the more noteworthy methods and results of the Survey. The two maps of general progress (sketches Nos. 1 and 2), one for the eastern part of the United States, the other for the western, show by symbols the ad>ance made in the several operations of the Survey up to the close of the fiscal year. Ou a separate map is shown the prog-ress of the work in Alaska.

PART I.
It will appear from an examination of this Report, and of the tabular statement given in Appendix No. 1, which shows the distribution of the field I)arties and the nature of their operations afloat and ashore, that every branch of the Surrny was in active prosecution during the fiscal year. ·while the geodetic work in the interior was well advanced, due attention was paid to immediate and pressing demands for resurveys of impo1·tant harbors and high wa~·s of commerce, and special care was taken to give wide publicity to disetweries of dangers to navigation IJy the publication of Notices to Mariners. Fifteen of these notices were issued during the year, four of which related to rocks or shoals found in the East I~iver in the course of the detailed resurve)~ of New York Bay and Harbor; one to important changes in Mouomoy Shoals, l\Ias1mcbusctts, aud one to the disco\""ery of a dangerous wreck on Charleston Bar. A list of the notices published is given under the head of Discoveries and Developmeuts in this part of the Rep0rt, and statemeuts more in detail iu Part II, arrang'ed with regard to localities and in a geographical order. Surve3·s involving triangulation and topography-, astronomical and magnetic work, and gtm:ity research were carried on within the limits or on the coasts of thirty'.one State,;, three Territories, aml in the District of Columbia. Hydrographic surveys were prosecuted in the waters or· off the coasts of fifteen States an(l two Territories. In the general statements of progress which follow, reference is made to important investigations in terrestrial magnetism, physical hydrography, and geographical history, the results of which appear as appendices to thi~ volume.

II.-OFl''ICE

wonn::.

Soon after the beginning of the fiscal year, e-rnnts occurred which led to marked changes in the organization of the Office aml in its personnel. The natnre of these changes is stated in the Annual Report of the Assistant in chat'ge of Office anrl Topography, published as .Appendix No. 4 to this volume. No loss of efficiency was suffere(l as a result of the changes made; the tendency has been, in fact, towards in creased efficiency in the se,·eral office divisions. The practical value of the investigations in Terrestrial .Magnetism, which ham been carried on by the Office for many j'ears past, is shown in part by the constant demands from local s1uYeyor1:> and c0untj· authorities for information in regard to the Yariation of the magnetic needle and its annual changes, an unusual uumber of queries relating to this subject having been answered during the fiscal year. Au article on the magnetic declination iu the United States was prepared for tlle use of the General Land Office. , A sugg·estion of importance, made hy the .Assistant in charge of the Office in his annual report, is thM it would be well to have means provided for supplying to each couutj· snrYeyor aud clerk of court tllroLighout the country ct>pies of papers published by this Office on the secular variation of tlle magnetic declination and its values at upwards of two thousand three hundred i;talious in the lJ nited States for the year 1885. Disputes as to the actual courses of old boundary liues could often be settler! were authentic information available in regard to the magnetic variation at different aud remote periods, or in regard to its rate of annual change for gh·en localities. The papers referred to were published as Appendices Nos. 12 and 13 to the Report for
188~.

Progress was made upon the drawings of eleven general charts of the coast, twenty-six coast charts, and sixteen harbor charts. Finished drawings were made of twelve charts for publicaticin by photolithography; of these eight were published during the year. Forty-three topographic sheetl!I were. inked, either wholl,Y or in part; one hundred and four projections were made for the nse of field parties, and forty-sernn tracings of original sur\'eys, topographic or hydrographic, were prepared to meet spedal requests from other branches of the Government or from individuals. FiYe new charts were published from engraved copper plates and one from stone; seven new editions of engrarnd charts were pµblished, and nine new charts and five new ~ditions from engrand i1late8 begnn. Additions and corrections were made to bring up to date the plates of four hundred and ·sixty charts. Forty thousand two hundred .and twent;y-six impressions from engraved plates of charts were taken in the press-rooms. Improved processes were introduced, leading to greater accuracy in the reductions from original sheets hy photography and the mounting of photographs to scale. There were distributed during the year thirty thousand five hundred and twenty-one eopie~ of charts, an increase of one thousand six hundred and sixteen over the number i8sued during the preceding fiscal year. Of this number, seYen thousand eight hundretl and seventy-nine were fox the Executive Departments, one tLousallll and fifty for Congress, and nineteen thousand nine hundred an<l twenty.four for sa le·agent8. The increasing demand for charts of the Survey by ship-masters and others is shown by the large increase in the number required dnring the yea1 to supply sale-a~ents, this number being five thousancl eight hundred and eighty-nine more than during the fiscal ~-ear preceding. Of the Annual Reports,.two thousand four hundred and one <~opies were distributed. Tide Taules, gi\·ing iu advance for the year 1887 the times anti heights of high and low water at all of the principal ports of the United States were published. A third edition of subdivision No. 13 of the Atlantic Lo<'al Coast Pilot, south coast of Long Islaud,, New York Bay, and Hudson RiYer was prepared for pul>licatiou, and the first edition of subdivision No. 20, Winyab Bay to Savanuah Ri-.·cr, was pnblii:;hed. Free distdbution was made of all Notices to Mariners printed <luriug the year, and the appeudici;s to the Annual Reports containing scientific papers of value were upon application supJ>lied gratuitously.

As a fnrtl1er contribution to our knowledge of the physical characteristics of Delaware HiYPr and Bay, there is girnn in Appendix No. IO a paper by Assistant MitclJell on the formation :rnd denlopment of thr Joe Flogger Shoal, which forms the central prong in the submerged delta of tlie DelawarP. :Mr. :Mitcllell's treatment of' the characteristics of this shoal; aifords a good example of his method of comparing tlJe results of old and new surYeys, the dimensions of the ~boal for tlie !\eYeral d-atei- of survey heiug compared precisely as if it were an artificial structure, such as a long mole, neediug rt>pair. By these comparisons he finds that between the years 1842-"43 and 1882-'83 t!Je Joe Flogger lost more than a mile (nearly 1,800 meters) from its upper end, and that for this mile tune was an average deepening of 10 feet on the crest of the shoal, arnl that · the rnlnable channels on either side of it have not suffered; on the contrary, the tfi.a.lu:eg depths · have been increased-they, too, Lave been scoured down.

C. S.

UOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Wasltington, IJ. C., October 27, 188G. Sm: Herewith I have the honor of submitting for your approval the estimates of the appropriations requfred for the United States Coast and Geodetic 8urvt.>y for the fiscal ~·ear ending June 30, 1888. 'l'he aggregate of the estimates ($560,765) is considerably larger than the antouut appropriated for the current year ($483,903.82), but only slightly in excess of the amount appropriated for the last fiscal year ($553,496); is leRs than the arnrage amount or appropriations for many years past. and is not in excess of the amount indispensable to the economical prosecution and reasonallly early completion of the work. The increase, as compared with the appropriation for the current year, relates only to fiel<l expenses, and is accompanied by a proposed decrease of $7 ,093.82 in salaries, thus contemplating the accomplishment of more work for less pay than is possible under the appropriation for the current year. The amount estimated for field-work is substantially equal to the amount estinmt1Cd for the current year. In theAe estimates, all items-of field-work are included nuder the classificatiou of "Party Expenses," of which they properly form a part. 'l'hey include onl~' tbe kim1 of operations for which Congress bas made annual appropriations for sernral years past, and identical in kind with those l.Jeing prosecuted by the government of nearly ewry civilized country. Those items referriug to operation!'! directly along the coast ai:e inteuded to leiwe no gToilnd for further suggestion of the idea that completion of the primary survey of the coast ii; unduly delaye<l or tllat sprcific "hydrography" is subordinated to other operations of tlie bureau. To that end estimates for 1rnsl1ing the work as rapidly as practicable are made for operations upon uncompl(·ted portions of the coast work, and for as mnch of needed hydrography as was asked for hy the H~·drographic lm:pcctor, and as can be supplied with the indispensable points, or rnosecuted witll tbe wssels, outfit, and naval officers at the command of the bureau. No one with anyexperienceiu or responsibility for ti.Jc administration of the Surn_y will enr dis· pute the propositiou that the rapid and economical accomplishment ot' its work depends upon tlrn ability to place its working-parties iu the field-on Ian<! or at sea-so that they may work to the best advantage and as long as climatic or other conditions will permit. To transport a party an<l its outfit and equipage to tbe field in vol ms tbe expenditure of an ine,·it.able and fixed sum, whether the appropriation for its work be large or small. After defraying that fixed sum the remainder of the appropriated item is a··ailable for the accomplishment ot' net results, and upon the iiroportion of such net results to gross expenditures turns tbe question of real economy and efficiency. Appropriations which compel the withdrawal of parties from the fiel<l in the midst instead of at the end of a season, or after only two or four illstead of four or eight months' work, ellhance the ultimate cost. and indefinitely delay the completion of all features of the work, and however restricted in annual amount cannot be justly characterized as economical or judicious. The estimate for "Party Expenses" covers ibe pay of those temporarily employed as recorders, signal-men, hands, cooks, drivers, or boatmen, or in any other capacity in connection with fieldwork except as field officers or members of the permanent force; the commutation (or subsistence) of tile chiefs and employes of parties; tra,·eling expenses to aud from the field and local transportation in the vicinity of field-work or in connection with it; the transportation of instruments, teuts, stationery, materials, outfit, and equipage to the field aucl in the field, and the purchase of all requisite materials, supplies, tents, boats, stationery, and camp equipage, for use in connection with field-work, an(l all other necessary expenses properly ilmident to tbe prosecution of fieldwork. The estimates contemplate thereductionQJthe numberoffie.ld officers by the retirement of'se1ei1

members whose services can be best dispensed wit!J, to be followed by the promotion of the junior members and a suspension of the grade of Aid until Congress shall provide for recruiting the force by appropriating for Aids, \"l'ho should be required to enter the force under the exacting physical and mental tests now prescribed by the regulations. The estimates for the curreut year, as PxplaineJ to the appropriations committees, contemplated a similar retirement, with, howeYer, tbe 11nnwrical maintenance of the force by the appointment of a corresponding number of aids at small salaries. The contemplated reduction will prolong the annn<ll period of field-work and shorten the annual period of office-work of those retained, without nry greatly impairiug the progress of the geueral work. 'l'hP. estimate for ''Pay of .Office Force," while providing for an apprentice to the electrot.ypist arnl photographer iu addition to the preseut force, and iu two or three instances modifying the desig-natious of eniplo~-es, contemplates· a rl:'duction of $773.82 from the amount appropriated for th~ current year, tlie reductions occurring mainly in four or five positious occupied at less tha~ the salaries appropriated for the current year. Iu Yiewof the 011i11ion cf the Solicitor of the Treasury that pel' diem employ es are not entitled to lean· of al>se11cc with pay, in justice to the lowest paid employes I have changed the estimates from per diem to anuual salaries. The est~maLes contemplate no superfluous positions. Ou the contrars, ti1e proper tlispo~al of accmnnlated data, aucHl.Ie prompt and satisfactory publication of current work, urgently require a marked increase of force in the computing, drawiug, and engraviug divisious of the Office. :No ;tern of work has been estimated for, in t!Je immediate aml Jiressing importance of which thos11 most competeut to judge have uot coucurred.

PART II.
Followiug the geographical order of the se0tions of the coast and interior as given in Apvendix No. 1, this part of the report presents detailed statements of progress in the se,·eral branches of the Surve;y, derived from the reports of chief8 of field parties, and concludes with a summary of the work of the office. Among the report8 which treat of matters of more than local interest are those relating to the special examinations made for the most a\·ailable site for a light on George's Shoal; to the inve::;tigations of tbe changes in l\fonornoy aml its shoals; to the advance tflwards completion of the resurvey of Kew York Bay and Harbor; to the studies of the fornrntiou and movement of ice in Delaware Ri\·er and B<ty; to the observations of currents iu the Gulf Stream; to the progress made iu the bydrographic examinations ilitemled to furnish data for a new issue of the l'acific Coast Pilot, and to the near approach of a juuction of the transcontinentaltriaugulations which will form a geodetic connection between the work on the Atlantic and that on the Pacific. Soon after the beginning· of the fiscal year Assistant Charles 0. Boutelle was succeeded.in the charge of the Office by Assistant n. A. Colonna. The annual report of this officer, accompanied by the annual reports of the chiefs of the Office divisions, appears as Appendix No. 4. Statistics of the field and office work of the Survey for the fiscal year 1885-1886 are given in Appendix No. 2, aud in Appmidix No. 3 is published a tabular statement of information furnished to DPpa1tments of the GoYernment in rep]~· to special requests and to individuals upon application during the same period. Appropriat.e reference was made iu the last annual report to the anticipated retirement of Commander C . .M. Chester, U.S. :!II., from the position of Ilyllrographic Inspector of t11e Survey. HaYing been ordered to a command afloat, after five years' service in that position, Commander Chester was relit>rnd October rn, 1885, by Lieut. Commander W. H. Brownson, U. S. N., who was detailed at that date by the Secretary of the Na,·~· as E~·clrographic Inspector. Lieutenant-Commander llrownson lias submitte<i'his annual report of hydrographic operations both in field and office. It is published as Appendix No. 5 to this volume. Ile observes at the outset that the methods of bis predecessor in the conduct of the duties of his office bad been so successful that bis chief endeavor had been to carry ont the system which that officer had inaugurated. J.,ieut. J. F. :\loser, U. S. N., A.ssiistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, hall charge of the work of the Hydrographic Division of the Office. J,ieutenant-Commander Brownson acknowledges the great care and untiring assiduit~- of Lieutenant l\loser in having the charts of the Survey made correct to the date of issue. As one means of effecting this, the Survey bas been fortunate in securing the thorough co-operation of the Light-House Board through its uaval secrc>tary, Commander H. I·'. Picking, U. S. N., and it is hoped that by recent arrangement with the Chief of Engineers, results of value will be communicated from the hydrographic survess carried on by tbe Engineer Bnrnau in connection with harbor impro\·ements. · In order that the changes ox corrections on t.be charts relating to buoys, new lights, dangers, &c., may be made a matter of record by puhlication at stated intervals, so as to be available fOJ

the use of ship-masters, sale-agents, and others, Licuteriant-Comman<lcr Brownson recommended a quarterly issue of a Notice to :Mariners which should contain a li~t of such changes in accordance with a scheme prepared by Lieutenant Moser. TLt; fhst number of this series was issued ?.larch 31, 1886, and eventually a monthly series may be determined upon. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the general su11enisiou of tLe work ou the Atlantic Coast Pilot Laving· been assigned to tlle Ilydl'ogrnpliic Inspector, the immediate charge of this work was giYen to Lieut. George H. Peter;;, U.S. N., As:,;io;tant Coa;;t aml Geodetic SUIT('Y· Byclrogmphic examinations made by him iu the executiou of this duty are n~ferred to under tbeir app1opriate headings in this pai-t of tile report, aud the 1nogH'!;S rn:aic in tl1e dlice-wmk is stat~d in the amrna report of the Hydrogra1lhic lrn;pector. A method im-olving uew features for the general treatment of the Atlantic coast bas been devised b~- Lieutenant Peters, sample pages of which haYe been printed for distribution an<l criticism. Tabulated statements of the names of officers of the 5aYy detailed for duty on the Sun·ey during the fiscal year, tlie names of Yessels and their tonnage, and of work done in the field and office accompa,ny the report of the Bydrograpbic Inspector. .Ackuowledgmeut is made of tile satisfactory services of Messrs. E. "\Yillenbucher, ,V. C. 'Yillenbucber, and F. C. Donn, h~·dro. graphic draughtsmen ; of Mr. }J. H. "\Yyvill, who sen·ed as clerk until promoted as draughtsman, and of .Mr. George J.

Topographical survey of the west bank of the Saint Croix Rirer betu:cen Calais and Eastport.In continuation of the topographical surn\Y of the coast of .Maine, it became tlesirable to fill a gap in the topography of the west bank of the Saint Croix Iliwr between the towns of Calais and Eastport. -Assistant A. \V. Longfellow was directed to orgauize a party for this work under iustrnctions dated July Hi, 188.'3. Events, at that time unforeseen, led to d('!ay in llis obtaining 1lata from the office, hut on tbe 5th of August he was able to begin a search for stations of t!Je former triangulation, and by the end of October, when field operations closed, had filled in topographical details on the upper sheet of bis surwy from the limits of former work at Calais to within a mile of Itobbinston. The loss of many of the old triaugulation points iuvolYcd many determinations of new points for the plane-table wo1'k, , Mr. Longfellow remarks that as the "\"\"est shore of the Saint Croix lfr,-er forms the eastern frontier of the State of Maine and of the United States opposite the proYiuce of ::'ew Brunswick, in the Dominion of Canada, it ma;y be deemed important in a military autl strategic point of view to have the topograpb;y of the American shore extended farther westward and made to include in greater detail all commanding summits on tlle ri wr.

His plan of operations involn'd the filling in of details upon the sheet, including the shores of Little Keunebec Bay, the determination by triangulation of points neP<kd for completing the topograpl1y of the Machias sheet, and the completion of the J\lachiasport sheet by the addition of a smrtll piece of forest topography near its junction in the town of Cntler with the sheet of Little }fachias Ba~-. Cpon the )lachias sheet, the topographical surny of the west branch of the :Machias Rinr, <'Olltiuuetl from the sheet below, was carried np to the second darn above the town; the sun·ey of tht~ rnidt1le branch was fiuished to :\farshfield, where it becomes a mere creek, although sea-going """"l~ls are lmilt upon its banks, aml tl!e survey of the vil:age of l\lachias and its immediate surroundings was complete<l. The roads nearest to the waters of Machias Bay, Machias River, and Little Keuuebec Bay were mapped, showing the communications between the towns of Jonesboro\ :;\Iachiasport, l\Cachias, :Marshfield, ·whiting, East Machias, aud Cutler. Two additional positions for topographic and h;vdrographic pur11oses were determined upon the sea.. face of Cross Island. Points aud shore-line were furnished to Lieut. E. D. F. Heald, U. S.

E. D. F. Heald, U.S. K., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sur·rny, commanding the steamer Bache. At tlie beginning of July, lSSli, in imrsnancc of instructions, Licntcntant Heald had re·organizcd his party on tile Bache, am1 upon reaching Pleasant Bay, .July 6, took up the bydrograpily of Pleasant RiYer, from the line joining tile ri>er and bay, which was the limit of his work of the pre.-ions season. After finishing this sheet, tLe following-named li}llrugraphic sheets were taken up in suceession and work on all of them completed with the exception of the one last named: Englislunan's Bay, western and eastern parts; Little Kennebec Ri\er, Machias Ri·er. and Machias Bay. It '\>as not found practicable to fiuish thp, hydrography of :\Iachias Bay, owing to the acl\ance of the season. All of the projections were upon a scale of 1-10000. "\Yi th reference to the plan adopted and executed for his work, Lieutenant Heald olJser'"es that it was to run double sets of lines of soundings intersecting at right angles, two hundred meters apart, -:me of the sets being as nearl:y as possible normal to the ::;bore. Before beginning work upon a projection, all of the main lines to be rnn were drawn upon the rough sheet, so as to insure a correct spacing of the lines, and to enable the boats to be worked 011 any projected line in "'hatm·er locality tile tide sen·eu best. Eacli day's work was plotted upon the smootll slieet the following day by the exrcnti\e officn of the ship, and the soumlings were reduced arnl ·erifieil by the surgeon and engineer. 1.:'pon the completion ofeaeb sheet a duplicate was prepared b.r the commanding officer, npou which he personally spaced iu tlie soundings and traced the 6, 12, and 18 feet cun~es of llepth.

Tlle work of Lieutenant Pillsbury iu examiniug for reported <laugers to naYigation, aml his experience in tlte special line of <luty assigned to Lieutenant Peters, were of great serYice and afforded peculiarl,'I· fa\·orable conditions for noting changes in depths and the collection of other data for the red:,;iou of the Uoast Pilot. Upon ueing detached from the Blake, Septemuer 4, at Bar Harbor, l\fe., Lieutenant Peters proceeded to l\lachiasport, and reported, September 6, to Lieutenant Heald, commamling the Bache. Much information of value was communicated uy this officer. Lieutt-uant Peters was <letache<l from the Bache Se1itembcr 9. On hiti way to \Yashingtou he stoppe1l al J>urtlaml, Me., to consult with Commander A. S. Urowniushiel<l, U. S.

Advantage was taken of every fwrnrable opportunit;y to obtain from local pilots, fisbermen, aud otlll'rs, information tearing ou the Coast Pilot work. Data derived from the practical experience of captains of coasting steamers were also noted. Iu accor<lauce with instructions, Lieutenant Peters returned to 'Vashington September 15, and resumed office-work in connection with the preparation of the Coast Pilot for publication. In April, 188G, he was or<lered to duty in Chesapeake Bay. Reference to tbi'S will be found under the hea1liug of Section III.

The nee<l of a light on George's Shoal is concisely stated and strongly urged in Assistant .l\[itchell's Jlaper, imhlished as Appendix No. 11 to the last annual report. Lieutenant Pillsbury's examination developed facts of much interest, which are given in the following extracts from his report: "I soon ascertained that the tide-rips (on George's Banks) in<licated the shoalest water, and 1 went oYcr cnry tide-rip I could find the whole length of the shoal.

"On the northernmost slloal I fonrnl ahont sen~nteeu feet, but other tlrnn this I made no special examination of the spot, as I considered the middle of tLe bank a better locality for a ligl1tl1onse, and that was soon seen to possess better natural features. Xearer the middie I fouml wlrnt I snppo;;;e to he the two and one-llalf fathom spots of the \\-ilkes snrn·y, rn,Y geographical position agreeing wr~- closely with his pnblislicd chart.

The cllange in (h·pth between the ridges and tLe portions of tlle shoal immediately adjacent 011 either side \Yas uot Yery great (from six to tweh-e feet) and the ridges were quite narrow, hut still I think tiley iu themselYes would assiRt materially in breaking the force of a sea cro;isillg them again:,;t a liglit house situated between, and if the ele\·ations were raised artifieiall)- the rost 1Yonld Le lessened. Between the ridges the deptil yarieu somewhat, as will be seen lly t1!1· somHlings. "I endea,·ored to obtain some surface-soil specimens, lint the current was ;;o strong that m,r boriug apparatus was brokeu.

But I dretlgrd on hotlt ridgef', between them, and outside hoth, and in each instance brought up coarse sand witll a few small 1ielil.Jh·s. "The description of the set of the current iu tile Atlantic Coast Pilot sePmed to lip correct, but I saw no eYiclence of the rise a11cl fall of tide as therein men tionell.

"lu running the lines of soundings iu the examination, I tried, ou rnme of thew, to keep exactl;r on the ridges, but I found it impossible to do so with so ::;tro11g a curre11t, a11\l PYeu in crossing them sometimes failecl to get the lead exactl,r ou tlieir narrow tops. I am incliued to be1ieYe from the degree of disturbance in the edges of the rips tllat the depths ou tlw rill!;l'S are ahont the same, and that the,r are nearly eoutinuuus. At the point examiued, prohalily in a length of one thousand feet, a three and oue-balt' fathom curn~ woultl not cross thPm. On lioth thles, the dark and rongll eclges of the rips were at tlw ridges; with a set paralll'l to them there was no rip, and tilis stage lasted about an honr each tide. The shoalest spots art> easily locate(! b,r tllest' rips, the former being situated near· the northern eml of the la.tter. Of the two rips, the easternmost is much tl1e longest, hut their northern extremities are nearly in the same line.

Mr. l\Iitchell's reports on the physical history of l\lonornoy and its Shoals and of the Delta. of the Delaware appear iu full in Appendices Xos. 8 aml 10 to this Yolume. .A.n abstract of the results which lie arrives at respecting the chauges at )fonomoy is here gi n:n: "The peninsula of l\lonomoy arnl the group of shoals about it present dangers that affect tlie eomrnerce between the States to a greater degree, perhaps, than any other obstructions; for here, at the eastern entrance to ~antucket Souu<l, JHlSS about thirty tbousand vessels annuall~-, and occa sionally three hnndred ,-essuls in a single 1lay. These vessels average two hundred tons buruen, arnl those imssing in a siugl<' day may represent, with their cargoes, three millions of dollars. Tliese Yessds not only run the gauntlet among the natural (}angers of this neighborhood, but they endanger each otlier in narrow channels for which the charts are inadequate; for thus far it has been almost impracticable to keep accurate chart<> in the market because the peninsula of 1\10110moy iH extending itself into the ocean continually, and the shoals about it are nearly all of them in motion aud augmenti11g· as the~- travel OH. ~,Ir. l\litchell has made a study of tile 11hysical history of these chaugPs, which he has based upon five strictly professional surveys extendmg back to that of Uapt. O. 0. Boutelle, in 1840, aml he llas gone beltirnl c\·en these, with consistent testimony to the rrnney of Capt. Panl Pinkham, in 178±. Never lias any remarkable physical change been the suQjcct of closer scrutin~-, and against his figures, that might otherwise seem improbable, l\Ir.

Tlie earliest Coast Pilots of tbis century mentioned that this peninsula hall cxtl'1Hled a mile in the previous half century, but the Coast Survey testimony giYes a rate exceeding <wen this. '·hi the early part of this century the extremity of l\Ionomoy made a mm·ement to the westward and formed a uook which in time l>ecame a Yalnable harbor and was christened the Pou:der Hole. It was capable of lwlding as many wssels as were likely to be caught in that neighborhood by a wiHter·:s gale, a1J1] :'\Ir. J.Iitcbell counted forty nssels there in 1855. But it was sllort lfred. The excl'llt>nt chart of it, execnted by thf' Coafit Sun'ey, was l!arllly in the market before tt decliue set iu, the protecting lw:wh lieg-au to fall back, and by 1875 this harbor of refuge was gone.

A mile and a half north of the J,igltt-Honse t!Jere was found an accnrnulatiou of sarnl somP two hundred and fifry meters to seaward upon the shore-line, and gradually diminishing in 'l'.-idth till near the Light-House, where the shore-line is nearly the same as ei~bteeu ~-ears ago. At the extreme end of the Point. the sands haYe built out one hundred aml tweuty-ti rn meter;;. But the most marked change is the total destruction of the Powder Hole as a harbor of refuge.

Contin11ation of geodetfo operations ·in tlic State of "li.'eu· Hampskirc.-"Gnder instructions to take up fiPl1J.work as soon as practicable after tile beginning of the fiscal year, Prof. E.T. Quimhy, Acti11g Assistant, hall eompleted by July 1 the needed preparations for occupying a station in SontlH·astern :Xew Hampshire. His party was established in camp on Patuccawa Mountain, in tbe tO\Yll of :Xotting-ham, }{ockingharn County. This station is one of tbosf\ in the primary series along the :Xew Engbml coast; it has au elerntion of about eight hundred feet almrn the sea, and was iirst occupied h.r Superintendent Bache in 1849. {" nfavorahle weather del.ayed the beginning of obserrntions until July 7. On August 2, work at Patncca'l'l"a \\"as finished am] the camp was moYcd to Garrison Hill, in the town of Dover, Straf. ford Comity. This was accomplished, notwithstanding a heavy storm, b~y August 4. Garrison Hill is a place of resort during the summer, and a tower for the use of visitors bas been built on its snmrnit. This tower with its tiag-pole rising from the center was used as a signal to he obsen·ed upon from other stations, hut as it could uot be occupied it was necessary to build a tripo(l aml scaffoltl so as to eleYate the theouolite about twenty feet and overlook the small grm-i'tb of tr{'es with 'l'l"hich the hill was coYered. The point occupied was tllerefore an eccentric one. After completing the observations at Garrison IIill, September 11, and packing and storing his camp equipage, Professor Quimby visited stations Blue Joh aml Catamount, points in the secomlar;·· serie;.;, to measure a fe'l'I" angles.

l'royre,<;s made in geodetic operation.~ in the State of Fermont.-Field-work in continuation of tlie triangulation of the State of Vermont was begun July 2 by Prof. V. G. Barbour, Aeting Assistant. Between that date and August 31, when obsenations were closed, under instructions, three stations were occnpierl. The first of tlmse was on Hoehe:;ter .Mountain, near tbe town of that name, in \Virnlsor County, the Sl'COJHl on Goshen ::\fountain, in Addison Cuuuty, a station quite difficult of access, and the tbin1 nt Landon, ahont e !even miles to the west,rard of Gos.hen and near the western li111its of the State.

State Sur\·e~·. It was held by the Commissioners that the points of triangulation determined in connection with the boundary lines would also form a part of the system of points needed as a basis for the topographical sur>ey, these respectiYe branclles of the surwy being cognate in their nature. It was borne in mi11d tlrnt tlle topographical sur\·ey did not uudertake to determine lines of' political and municipal diYision except in cartographic form, and it was thought that the addition of' data from which the Yalucs in fig-m·cs of the lines in the Yarious town boundaries could lie taken would.enhance the Yalne of the whole work. a.Iler conference with ~fr. ·whiting, ;\lr, Yan Onlen took ti.Jc field in June, 1885. His first \rork was a reconnaissance of the priwary sitle of Blue Hill-Prospect W'altham, and its connectiou with the corners of the town of Hylle Park, Norfolk County. Theuce he worked easterly, includ· ing awl completing the town l>ouudaries of Milton, Quincy, Braintree, Randolph, Holbrook, and W eyrnouth, in Norfolk County, and of Ilingharn, Cohasset, Scituate, aml South Scituate, iu Plym. onth County. In Xorfolk Uouut~· he partially completed the boundaries of the towns of Dedham, Canton, awl Stonghtou, and in Plymouth Count~- those of Brocton, Abington, Hockland, and Hanon·r. To do this it became necessar.r to use two additional points in the primary triangulation, Scituate, and I>rospect Bingham. From the line joining these points as a ba8e, the triangnlation was carried southward to the old line, Ahlen-l\lonk"s Hill. In comi11g down frow the primar_y sides to the town corners, the work done establishes points that will be Yery mseful in future surTeys. All of such poiuts haYe been perniauently marked and descriptions of them made. l·'ield operations were clmied, owiug· to the mhance of the season, in Dt'cem Ler. The results are summarized in the followiug statement of statistics:

"'ith regan.1 to this work the Commissioners in their annual report express their belief that its completion in a manner commensurate with the scientific an1l accnrate standard of' the trigonometrical snn·eys already made by the State and tlie United States will form the best basis for a cadastral or propcrt;r line surwy of a State yet proYide<l in this country.

The Ready left N cw York J nly 2 and anchored next day near Charles Island, l\Iilford Roads. The area included in the sun'ey was covered by four hydrographic projections, each on a scale of 1-10000. Lieutenant Paine's general plan fol' tile work was to run six lines of 1:ionndiugs to the mile, normal to tl.Jc coast, crossed lly four lines in an east and west tlirectiou; to traverse the coa:st-linc and islands, and develop especi~tlly the slioals and rock>;. This scheme was generally carried out; on tile fourth projoctiou, llowe,·er, wllich includes th·J Norwalk J:.ilaudi-, the olJi:;tructions to rnffi- gation wPre fouml to be so numerous that it was deemed ad\·isabl(' to double 1 he general liuPs in each direction. To obtain a plane of reference for tlie soundings, tide-gauges were set up on Uw l"ish House 'Ylrnl'f, Welch's Point; on Lewh;'s \\·hurf, East Bridgeport; 011 the wharf at George's Ilotel, lllack Hock IlarlJor, and on the sot1th bank of the Saugatuck Rin~r where it makes its first lJe)J(l to tlie westward. Bench-marks were established for each of these gauges, and the mean low water at <lifferent points was obtained by comparison with the record of the automatic tide-gauge 011 tLe Xew Havel! Breakwater. Tliis gauge, which Lad been located tliere iu 1884, was re-established in l\Iay, 1885, and the record kept np till October of that year, wLeu it was ca ni('ll a\1 a~- liy a gale liieutenant Paiue remarks that be found no great changes in the soundings as gi\·eu ou the existing charts. Off Stratfortl Point, howevt>r, about two miles south aml from one and a quarter it) one and a half miles west of Stratford Light-house, there are several spots with from twenty to t\Venty-three feet of water on them, surrounded by depths of from twenty.fise to thirty feet. Unfavorable weather prevented as thorough a de\·eloprnent of this locality as it was desired to make. I<rom 'Velcli's Point to Norwalk the entire coast abounds in oyster-beds planted in from fh-e to six fathoms of water; there are also extensive beds in protected places inside the IIousatonic Hiwr and between the :Norwalk Islands and the mainland. The rivers included iu the surrny lrnve nearly all had tlrnir channel lines dredgel1 ouL 1lnriug the past few ~-ears, and during last summer a great deal of work was doue about, the shoals at the mouth of the Housatonic River. The entrance to this river has been deepened two feet, and there is a fair anchorage for small Yessels inside. ln the vVepawaug Hi\·er at l\lilfonl tlw channel has been dredged but a short distance to a small wharf near the mouth where the o~·ster steanmrs moor, and there is practically 110 anchorage inside the bar, the channel being narrow and shallow aud surrounded by mud flats. In the Pcquonnock River at Bridgeport the channel has uot only been dredged out, but a great deal of dredging has been done abo\·e the upper beacon 011 the west edge of the cbanuel. Here, tliere is a fair anchorage for small Yessels in about twelve feet of water; a short scope of chain must, however, be used as there are mud flats dil'ectly astern aml close aboard in an easterlr wind. The )lill RiYcr at Soutliport is a mere ti1le-water creek; there is 110 ancborage insi1le for Yefisels drawing over two feet.

E.vten.~ion of the triangnlation for the resurvey of Lonr; Island Sonn1l, and of }{eu:i York Harb01·, from Eaton's Point eastwardly on the 1w1·th shore of Long Island, aml from the Hudson River to bey(mll Tltrog's Neel.:.-Dnring the summer anu autumn of 1885 the triangulation for the resurrny of Long Island Sound antl of New York Harbor was alkanced by Assistant Gershorn Bradford, whose party took the field for that purpose nuder instructions dated July 20. ::\Ir. Bradforu's first work was to fill a gap of about twenty miles in the triangulation on the nortll side of Long Islaml, between Eaton's Point arnl 3Iiller's place. He found enough voiuts of the olrl triangulation to determine all of the subordinate points needed and to establish the position of Stratford Shoal Light-llouse from two bases. By September 12 the work was finished. Its statistics are as follows:

Bradford transferred his part,\· to Uollege Point, Long Island, and bega11 search for such points of the triangulation executed in 1.S34 and 1855 as would enable liim to furnish positions to the topographic and hydrograpbic parties engaged in the resurveys of the Eat<t Hiwr and Long Islaud Soum1. The principal stations recoYered were Cypress Hill and Clarke on Long Island, and HighwootF between \Yest Hoboken and 'Veehawken, X. J. These istatious are located stweral miles inland from that part of Long Island Sound which was to be 1<urveyed, and the chief difficulty was to fintl a new point or voints intervisible with these three station,,, ancl also with points to be established on the t:.hores of tile Sound. The smoke which usually on~rbangs ~ew York City and >icinity seldom clParR enough to admit of good seeing on loug lines, and tbe trees which ba>e grown up since the former triangulation was executed could not be remo\·.ed except at great expense, as they stand on "al ua ble estates. After some delay )lr. Bradfor<l succeeded in finding a station (Ferber's cupola) in College Point and a tower (:.\lemorial Uhurch) in New York Cit,i·, which ga,·e the connection desired, and the work was then pm;hed forward with but little interruption till the 10th of Sonmber, when field operations were closed.

maintained in operation till its close. The mea.u low water for tllis gauge was foitnd to correspond to that determined by the long series of observations which bad in timner j·ears ueeu kept up at this point. Cmnparison gauges were established during the progress of the work at .the N:.iYYYard, at Bellevue Hospital, and at Astoria, Long Island. Before remo,·ing these tempora;y gauges, sketches were made of the locality where each one was placed, and bench-marks were left. The work of sounding in so crowded a harbor was attended, as might he supposed, with mauy difficulties. Two small steam launches, a whale boat, and a dingh~- v.·ere used. The dinghy ''"as employed in taking soundings in all the slips and around the wharves ; this work lJeing assigned to one officer. As a result of this work, many of the slips l1arn since beeu dredged, the owners finding out from the survey that there was urncli less water in them than they had snpposetl . .At times tlrn strengt,b of tlie tidal current in the river was so great tliat tlw lannclies could not overcome it, and work would Lave to be suspended until the tide slacked; this was particularly the case in the Blackwell falaud Channels. Ju the month of Augast many of the crew were prostrated by illness arising from the heat and the unwholesome 01Iors along tlte East Hiver wharr-es; hence for about three weeks it was found advisal1le by tile Hytlrogrnpl1ic fospector to sencl the vessel down to the lower bay to engage in observations of m1neuts. This plan re.,,loretl all on board to good health. Between Eighth street, New York, aud Blackwell's Island, seven m1charted rocks and sl10als were developed, all of which were immediately reported to the office, from which Notices to ::\Iariners were issue<l, describing their location. The most important of tlwse rocks was oue found of about ten feet in diameter, nearly in mid-cl.Jannel in tbe East Hi\·er. It is now marked l1y a danger buoy.

B. Wainwright, was briefly recountetl in the last aunual report. In order that the bydrographic survey of the North River, which had beeu hegun towards the end May, 1885, might suffer no delay for want of JlOSitions, l\'Ir. Wainwright's first work was to determine, by Illane-table triangulation, points on both sides of the river which wonlll he serviceable for hydrograpbic and topographic surveys. These points having beeu fm·uh;iled to Lieutenant Cutler, who bad charge of the hydrography of the rh·er, tht'details of the dock and shore line were completed from the Battery to the New York Central Hailroa<l piers en the Kew York side7 and from Cast.Je Point to the West Shore Railroad JJroperty 011 the New Jersey side. This done, Mr. Wainwright took up and completed a topographic sheet iuclntling the shorc·liue:i of North River and Upper New York Bay from the docks of the New Jer1Sey Central Hailroad Company .to Oaven's Point, New Jersey, and Ellis and Bedloe's Islands. The three projections which included this work and that first uamed were upon a scale of 1-5000. The shore.line of Long Island was then delineated from Rell Hook to Cllionville on Grnyesend Bay, and that of Staten Island from the new slip of the l<apid Transit Company to a poiut southwest of Fort Tqmpkins.

Tracings of shore-line and positions of points were furnisbed to the h;ydrograpbic parties at WOl'k in the vicinity. l\lr. vVainwright calls attention to important changes in topographical details that have takPn place since previous sm·n:·ys. Among those are the new pi~rs, warehouses, ferr;y-slips, aud the large area of reclaimed Janel bPlonging to the West Shore Hailroad on the New Jersey side of the North Hiver just below the old Weehawken Ferry Landing. Across the river the New York Central Hailroatl has built five very large new ]liers, wit~1 warehouses and grain elevators. The hulkhead line a.ml tlrn reclamation of the area back of it from Twenty-llixth to Thirtieth streets is 1-1till incomplete, owing to legal difficulties. At tlrn Battery, Pier" New No. 1" has been completed, and pier A neml,\· so. Both of these pit·rs are constructed of masonry. -The area of reclaimed land, ,inst abo,·e Caven's Point, owned by the Xatio11al Storage Com-' pauy, aml now kuown as Black Tom's faland, is shown on AsRistant 'Ybiting's survey of 1875. Since theu it has been connected with the main land b,Y a railway ou 1restle work, and a large, irregularly-shaped warehouse built upon it. At the time of ::\Ir. \Vainwrigbt':-; l'HlrYey, additions to tl1e islaml were in progress; part of these are shown on the plane-table 8heet. The company was c11gaged al;;o in dredging a cliannel to deep water. On Bedloe's Islaml tlie pedestal of Bartllohli's Statue of Liberty was accurately determined in position. On Staten Island the Itapid Transit Company ha1-1 built a new slip, and connected it by a new viece of railway, mostly along t11e water front, with the former terminus'of the road at Stapleton. This road will be continued along tbe north shore, and it is oYer this route that the Baltimore and O!Jio Ifailroatl Company expects to get an entrance to New York. Assistant Wainwright expresses his obligations to Assistant E.

As far as practicable he was to reoccu1i.y stations at which these elements or one or two of them had lwen i1nwionsly determined. At New York City the station of 1846 at the Manhattan\·ille A,;:ylnm eonld not be re-occupied~ aud a new one was selected iu Hiverside Park near the ex.tension of One hundred and twentysixth street. At this station, as at all ot11ers oecupied by .:'.\Ir. Baylor on this tom·, with the exception of Washington, D. O., obserrntions were made for Ynlnes of the magnetic decliuation, di11, and intensity. At Buffalo, ~. Y., a station was selected in the grounds of l~ort Porter, one hundred and se,·enty-nine foet from the Lake Suney Station of 1873. 'l'he formation is pure limestone. At Oxford, N. Y., the Bache Fund Station of 1874 was re-occupi<'d. At Sand;1· Hook, X. J., the point oceupied was within a fow inches of the stations of 1873 and 187\l. The st;ttion at Cape Henlopen, Delaware, was seven hundred and nine feet in a northwe;;terly dircctio11 from tlic Light. House and on the same side of it as the station of 1856, thouglJ not i<lentical with it on account of the shifting sand formation . .At, Baltimore, Md., the same station, withill" the limits of Fort l\IclieurJ, was occt1pietl as in 1877. At W asbington, at Assistant 8chott's observatory on Capitol Bill, ouservatious were made with the dip circle, before and after the season's work, to determine the intensity by the Lloyd method at the several stations occupied. At Harrisburg, Pa., tbe statiOll occupied was the same as that at which mn.gnetic ohsernttion8 were made in 1877 in the grounds of the State capitol. A station near Pittsburgh, Pa., was selected in a large open lot north of the Allegheny observatory, and at a distance of one hundred and seYenty-oµe feet se\"'en inches due north from the Ct'nter of the transit instrument.

In closing bis report, l\Ir. Baylor expresses his belief that the establishment at State capitah~ aIHl principal county seats, of standard meridian lines and the determination of the magnetic variation from time to time, would be an undertaking of great practical utility, and that its results would be higllly appreciated by property owners, b.Y surveyors, aud by all persons interested in the accurate la_yiug' out of land bonudaries. After devoting some time to the completion of t.he records and computations of his work for the archives Mr. Baylor received orders for duty on the Southern coast, reference to which will be made under the heading of Sections V and VIII. Ph_ijsical ltydrography-Nem York Ha.rbor survey-An epitome of results for tidal jiowage through l'leu: York Harbor-Progress of other inve.Ytigatio1is noticed.-Assistant Henry Mitchell has submitted a project for continuing the physical hydrography of New York Harbor, based upon tlie results of his work of 1885. This work was suspended, under instructions, in September of that year. It had, however, made sufficient progress to enable .Mr. Mitchell to discuss the following subjects: (1) The flood and ebb discharges of the Hudson Biver, East River, Kills, and Narrows, reduced to the same mean range of title; (2) bow far np the Hu<l:-;on River does the effective tide -0f the river extend; (3) what new observations are necessary to determine the laws of movement of the tides and currents in East River; (4) the Kill Yan Knll and its relation to New York liarhor; (5) the formation of New York Bar. Upon these several points the suggestions outlined in )lr. Mitchell's report will lle of value in the further prosecution of the work. ·vvith regard to the tidal flowage through New York Barbor, the following results are submitted:

After tlle abo-\·e epitome of results hall been prepared, it occurred to l\Ir. Mitchell to compare. them with the gauging of East River at Wall street as ginn in his report entitled "TLe Harbor of New York .. Its condition l\fay, 1873" (Appendix No. s, Annual Report of Superinternlent, 1871 ). Table 15 of that report givesCnhic foet.

With regard to New York Bar, l\fr. :Mitchell obserws that owr jt ·passes uearl,Y all Ute dischargP gauged at the Narrows 3.tlded to the tidal prisw of the Lower Bay. Quoting hii;; own won.ls f'ollowiug: "I say nearly all, because there are indications that Raritan nay is in 1;ome drgree filled aml drained by way of the Narrows,-in what degree we must compute from obsenations grcnped by lunar hours, as it is impracticable to make so large a series of simultaneous g-augiug as sllonlll absolutely determine the matter dircctl,y. "Of course it is not the identical water passing OHr the bar that we ob8e1Tc to be in motion elsewhere, but its equivalent. A single particle makes an el:iptical journey, au orbit of a few miles major axis. "One may easily see that if tlie depth were a direct function oft he Ye loci ty of tlie current it would vary from spring tides to neaps, which it is not oh:;;en·ed to 'lo. It is belie,~ett theu that the resultant for the tidal day represents the net scouring J'oree irrespe<'tirn of tidal range or volume. "By working up the resultwits we determine to what extent tlte motion of a grain of sand is tending towards some vortex, and this is the way in which we propose h.r multiplication of stations to sbow the method of bar-building, and why it is arrested at a certain stage of develo[11ne11t.'~ Mr. Mitchell will present the results of the work of hiil party in New York Harbor arnl its approaches in a more complete form at a later date. 'fhe obse.ations were made, under his supervision, by .Assistant H. J_.. Marinuin, with the aid of Assi:stant Marcus Baker and Lieut. F. S. Carter, U. S. N. Physical hydrography, New York Bay a.nrl Ha.rlmr.-1{,eforence was rna<le in the last annual report to instructions issuell to .Assistant H. L. l\larimlin at tlrn opening of the season iu 1885, directing him to organize a party with such subdivisions as might be advise<l by .Assistant .'.\1itcht·11 for the d<'Velopment of the physical bydrography of New York .Ba;r aud Harbor. Mr. Marindin has suhmitted a detailed report of the operations uuder his own immediate directioll, an alistrnct of which is here ginu. Two parties were provided for, one on hoard the schooner Scoresby, in cliarg·e of Mr. l\Iariudin, the other on boarll the schooner Drift., under command of Lieut. F. S. C<trter, G. S. N., working in co-operation with the Score&h~'· From July 1 to 13 the two Yessels with the steam buuclies attached remained at the New York navy-yard to complete their fitting up, a new arra11gemrut of reels and connections being required to obtain the velocity of currents at all depths b,\· meai1s of electric current meters and registers. · On July 13 the steamer Dais~-, with Commander 0. M. Chester, U. S. X., II,v(h·o.gmphic Inspector, on board, towed the vessels to their first station in Kill Yan Kull. In ord.er to rate the electric met(·rs before beginning obserYations of currents, oue of the Scoresby's boats was transported inland into a still-water poud. \Vith tlie different meters attached, the boat was then run over an accurately-measured base-line, and this operation '"as repeated at a different speed. In this way a good rating was obtained for the four electric meters. The vessels were then brought on to a cross-section of the Kill van Kull, and ol,serrntions were begun by erecting the range signals, sounding the oi·os;;-sections, and obser\·ing the veloei ties of the stream during several ebbs and floods with tl:ie Price electric-current meters. Tidal observations were iu progresi at the same time at Elbow Beacon, at tl:ie head of Xewark Bay, at Elm Park, at the foot of the bay~ and at both of the cross-section:,; in the Kills.

At Willet's Point Oaptaiu Knight, of the United States Engineers, kindly offered to detail an orderly to keep the gauge going. This offer was accepted, aud the records were forwarded to \V ashing-ton. H.r the 5th of August. the observatious in the Kills wen~ completed, aud the parties wem trausferred to the Hudson Wver, otf Tllirty-11inth street, where a discharge section was obsen·ed in connection with simultaneous obser\'atious in the East Hiver, where the .Drift had been sent. It had also been arranged that the 11aval parties on the steamers Endeavor and Daisy and schooners Eagre and Palinurns were to uutlertake some current observations ou Sandy Hook Bar simultitueously witl! the Scoresby and Drift in ti.Hi Hudson antl East River rei;pectivt>ly. · This was done, ::tml the records were forwitrue<l to the office. August 14 l\lr. Mariudiu moved his party to Dobb's Ferry, on the Hudson, and was joiued b~· the Drift. Observations were then begun for obtaining the discharge of the Hudson River. Tidal observations were kept up at Dobb'.:; I<'erry \Vlmrf, ·near one end of the cross-section; tide-stations were estahlislrnd al:,m at Iona Island, at Sing Sing, at Forty-second street, Hudson Riler, at Pot Cove, in the I~m:;t l{h·er, and at Old Ferry Point. On the 10th of September the Jlarty mon>d from DoblJ';i Ferry to tl1e New York Narrowi;, where a cross.section for discharge of ebb aud flood was observed. This done, and the electric· current meters again ratecl at tlie Kill \"au Knll, field 01)erat.ions were closed for tbe season, and early in October Mr. l\Iarindiu took up at the office in \Vashington t!Je computations of his work urnler the direction of Assistant Mitchell, who had Yisited the parties seYeral times during the progress of the observations. Mr. Marindin had the efficient ai<l of Assistant l\Iarcus Baker, and also that of .l\fr. Homer P. Hitter, of the Mississippi Rh·er Commission, an expert in current observations and river gauging.

Topographical resurvey of the shore-lines of Bergen Keck, Neu:ark Bay, Sanely IIuok, <f'c., .Kew York Bay and Harbor.-A resurvey of tue snore-line of Sandy Hook was completed 1;0011 after the beginning of the fiscal year by Mr. E. L. Taney, Aid· in the Surn~y. Hderence to this work aud to the considerations which leLl to it as an l'ssential part of the New York Ilarbor resuney was made in the last anuual report. After finishing the re1mrvey of the Hook, }lr. Tarwr proceede(l, under instructions dated .Tnly 30, to Bergen "Neck, New Jersey, and began a :shore-line smTey of tlie Xeck at Can·n's Point, carrying it from tilat point to and through the Kill ·an Kull into Newark Bay to a I)Oillt about half a mile nort,L of the bridge of the New ,Jersey Central Hailroad. Also along the northern :::hore of Staten Island th1 ough Kill >an Kull to Arthur Kill, a11d along the west shore of Newark Bay from Elizabeth port to about lialf a milB 11orth of the railroad brhlge. The work at S:mdy Book was mostly simple slwre-Jine, lmt on Bergen :Keck and tLc Kill Yan Kull it was principally wharf-line, nu<l ill tliis there was considerable detail, a margin beiug mapped of f··om a quarter to a half a mile in width. J?ield operations were closed October 2-1. The number of miles of sl10re am1 wharf Jin<' run was about sixty. In furtherance of instructions issued for tile closing of the snboffice at New York, )fr. Taney was directed towards Llte eud of October to make an im·e11torr of all prop('rty of the Surn;~ stored at that office, autl to receipt for it to Capt. F. J. Palmer.

The self-registering tide-gttuge at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, which ha<l been in charge, successively, of Messrs. J. W. Corbett and A. J. Brenwtn, under the direction of the hydrographic officers of the Rnrvey, was situated on the wharf of the Sontht>rn lfailroad of New Je1·se.r. This loca,tion ha>ing been found to be unfavorable, the station was discoutinue11 earl.)' in Norember, 1885. Iu June, 188G, Assistant Gershom Bradford was directed to proceed to Sandy Hook and make ex.aminations to determine a suitable place for the erection of a perma11e11t automatic tidegange. He selected a locality comparatiYel;r free from the effect!! of drifting ice and hea\'y seas. Here a substanthil i.ndepeedent structure was llegun, upon 'rhieh, as soon as possible, a selt~regis tering gauge will be established.

Other duty assigned to Mr. Bache during the fiscal ;year is reported nuder a later heading ir. this section. Hydrographic resurvey of 'Seu: York Lou:er Bay and Entrance.-Lieut. G. C. Hanus, U.S. N., AsHistaut Coast and Geodetic Buffey, commanding the steamer Endeavor, lias submitted a full report of the hydrographic resurvey of New York Lower Bay and Entrance executed by the part~' under his charge during the sea.sou of 1885. The area covered by this surrny included the lower bay from tlrn Narrows to Sandy Hook, and the work was lai<1 ont on four hydrographic sheets, each on a scale of 1-10000. · Soundings were begun June 2, at which date the necessary signals had been established, and continued till early in :K ovem ber, when the work, in its most essential parts, was completed. Throughout the season Lieutenant Hanus ha<l the aid of a steam launch, and on July 13 the steamer Dais_y was added to the party equipment, and was found to be exceedingly useful, though not so economical as the Endeavor, owing to her small coal capacity. To do successful work on the scale of the hydrography, in a strong and constantly varying tidal current, was attended with many difficulties in a harbor so foll of passing vessels, some of which were often getting in the way. 'Vhen the rate of speed was changed, the drift due to tide varied, and tlle lines of soundings heiug so cloise, a slight drift would carry the steamer from one line to the other. In developing the work many lines were run to the northward aud westward of Romer Beacon, so as to make snre of the amount of water that can be carried across the shoal, since much time ean be HavPd to all the smaller vessels b~· cutting across this shoal instead of following the Swash Channel. Special care was taken to develop thoroughly all the channels, notably that of Couey Island, since it is the shortest route to the sea. To obtain a plane of reference for the soundings, a tide-gauge was established on the steam boat wharf at Bath, Gravesend Bay, Long Island. This gauge, as well as all the work in comwction with tidal data, was placed under the personal supervision of Ensign G. R. French, U . .t5. N., whose extensirn experience with tide-gauges on various parts of the coast gave I,ieutenant Hanus great confidence in his gooll judgment aud the accuracy of his results. It was deemed desirable to han~ the reference gauge directly under the control of the party, arnJ it was found by comparison that hi~h water occurs at Bath about ten minutes later Uian at Sandy Hook, and that the mean rise and fall at both place~ is about equal, uamely 4.8 feet. The usual bench-marks were establishe<l 1 aud descriptions of them placed in the record books. On S<ttnrday, August 8, preparations were made for current observations, and ou the 11th the steamer Enuea\·or towed the schooner Palinurus, and the steamer Dais;r the schooner Eagre int<~ positiuu, forming a circle from Rockaway Inlet to the Navesink Liglits. A party was al·o sent from the EudeaYor to the wreck of Scotland Light Ship, and a series of simultaneous observations was taken. On August 18 observations with cturent chips were taken by both the steamers Enclearnr and Daisy. The chips were followed during one whole flood an<l part of the succeeding ebb title. On August 27 the I~ndeavor and Daisy, as well as the schooners Palinurus and Eagre, proceeded to stations previously designated in the lower ha.v. Two sets o.f simnltaneous observations of currents on different stations wern taken, and on the 30th the vessels retui·ned to Bath. All of the results obtained in current work were transmitted to Assistant Henry Mitchell, chief of the party engagecl in the study of the physical hydrography of New York Bay and Harbor. Lieutenant Hanus's device for hydrographic signals, known as pump-signals, and described on page 34 of the annaal report for 1883, was foand to be rnry effective. Long and slim trees were used, from sixty to seventy-five feet in lengtll; these were planted with ease in from two to three ancl a half fathoms of water.· Some of these signals were at least thirty-five feet out of water, and out of twelve planted but one was carried awa_ir during the season · .Hox tide-gauges, which would otherwise be difficult to secure in exposeu places, can be readil) fixed in the same way, or can be at once attached to one of these signals.

Peirce in Jul;y, 1885. He was directed to make a reconnaissance for an east and west line of statious along or in the vieinit,Y of the fort,Y-tl1ird parallel of north latitude as far west as the l\foisis!!ippi Rinr, examining certain specified localities witli reference to their facilities for ~TaYita tion stations, and then occup;ying such Rtations, three or four in number, as should best fulfill the conditions required. After careful examinations tl.1e stations finally selected were Ann Arbor, .Mich., .Madison, 'Vis., and Ithaca, N. Y. At these stations, and at the Smithsonian Institution, '\Vashington, the invariable re·ersible pendnlums Peirce No. 2 (a meter in lengtli) and No. 3 (a ;yard ill length) were remeasured and were oscillated. The rule was to oscillate each pendulum eight times in each position on each stand. Two new pendulum stands had lleen constructed of improved design, so that two pernlnlnms could he oscillated simultaneously on two supports. Each swinging· consisted of five thousand oseillations with heavy end up and fifteen thousand with heavy end down, except that one-fourth of the swingings in the latter position were of double length. There were thus about six hnrnlrecl thoui:mml oscillations with heavy end down and one hundred and sixty thousand with heav.r end up at each station. Af, ltllaca one of the stands was set up in a cohl room, so that the m·erage temperature \Yas about oo Cf'ntigrade, while that of the other was about 150 Centigrade. The three Kater in'\"'ariable pendulums usetl by Colonel Herschel, and later by Assistant Edwin Smith, were, at the request of Professor Stokes, the president of the Royal Society, oscillated in Iloboken preparatory to being returned. Special experiments were made in Ithaca on the rnriation of the absolute personal equation in observatious of pendulum transits with the amplitude of the vibration. These experiments wPre fully reducE.'<l. The reductions of the observations at Ann Arbor an<l Ithaca were carried toward complctiou, and those of observations made at Madison and Washington were begun. A reduction was nlso begun of observations made at Key "West in a. former year. , .

Continua,ti<m of tlie_primary triangulation in t/1.e eastern part of the State of Pennsyfrania.Prof. Mansfield Merriman, Actiug Assistant, under instructions dated ,June '.?'.?, 188f>, began immediately the erection of signals and preparations for the occnpation of stations for the exten8ion of the primary triangulation in tbe eastern part of the State of Pennsylvania. The plan of his work involved the occupation of a number of stations to the eust and we~t of a line between Allentown, Lehigh County, and Wilkes Barre, Luzerne County. Knob Station, near Mauch Chunk, Carbon County, was first occupied. Signals were erected at two stations and hcliotropers posted at five. Horizontal angles were measured betwceu t!Jcse stations and direction~ to eight secondary 1mints were obsen·ed. The work at Knob was finished July 18, and two days later Profei:sor Mnriman bt>gan-the occupation of station Ben's Head, II. Ex. 40--6

Heconnais.rnnce for the cxteri.~ion <!f the triangulation in the eadern and nortlicastern parts of the State<>/ l'ennsyltania fou:ards the boundary between Pennsylrnnia and X cw Yo1·7.:.-Au acconut of tlie g'eueral plan of the reconnaissance in Eastern Pennsylvania, iutruste<l tu the charge of At;isistant 0. H. Tittmauu, was gfren in the last annual report. After consultatiou with Prof. l\Iausficld 1\forriman, Actiug Assiistant, who liad direction of the primury triaugulation in Umt part of tl.rn State, Mr. Tittmann accompanied him in the latter part of June to stations Pimple Hill and Penobscot, wliieh he had before selected, in order to determine the intenisibilit,y of tl.Jese arid other points. Through l'rofessor J\Ierriman's hearty co-operation he was enabled to start from these two points as a base and to carry the reconnaissance northwardly towards t!Je bonndary. Mr. John E. McGrath served as Aid in the party, and to him was assigned tlie duty of measuring angles at the stations selected by Mr. Tittmanu along the edge of the northern coal-field, in pursuance of a request rna<le by tlm State Geological SurYey. Field work was closed October 5, the reconnaisrnnce Laving been carried to the State boundary, a1Hl a connection outlined with the New York State SurTey on the line Windsor-Warren. During the winter Mr. Tittmaun was assigned to duty which will be referred to uu<l<>r the heading of Section VIII. Reconnaissance for triangulation in the soutltern and irestern part of the 8tate of Pennsylvania.The plan of work which had been committed to tlie charge of Prof. L. II. Barnard, A.ctiug Assist. aut, about the b(>giuuiug of the fiscal year, involved the occupation of a number of stations in the southern auJ southwestern part of the State of Pennsylvania as soon as the reconnaissance should fowe been suflicicntlJ' developed. Bvents which occurred in July, 1885,aftecting the management of the Survey, led to dela~' iu forwarding instruments to Professor :Barnard, so that he was unable to do any efiective work before August 1. Uufaworable weather th,en set in and prevented the measurement of auy augles except those at station Dauphin, a bout seven miles north (nearly) from Hanislmrg. Observatious were matle at statiou Dauphiu on three stations, Mexico, Doubling Gap, and Piney l\1ouutaiu (South Mountain) at distances respectively of twenty-seven, twenty-four, and thirty-nine miles to tLe northwestward, westward, and south westward. A tripod was set up at station Clark's Knob, about twenty miles to the northwest of Chambersburg, l<'ranklin County, ,and a rapi<l recon· .ouissance was made to the uorth and west of this station. J>rofessor Barnard was engagctl in prosecuting his reconnaissance in A.dams County, between Gettysburg and Chambersburg, when he receiYcd orders to close field operations on or about Octol>er 1. Mr. John Nelson served very eflectively as Aid in the work. fo May, 1886, instructions were given to Professor Barnard to resume bis reconnaissance at as

Completion of the survey uf the parallel boundary betzceen !lie Slate11 of Pcnnsylrnn-iu. and H'cst Yirginfo.-In the aunual report for the fiscal year euding Juue 30, 1884, an account was giwn of the beginning of a survey of the bouudary line uetween Pcnnsylrnnia and West Yirginia, wliich follows uearly the parallel of 39° 43'.3 for a distance of about fift;y-fh-c miles from tLe sontLwe1<tern conie1· of Pemmyh·auia to the l\lar:rland corner. This work was undertakeu at the i·equest of the Joiut Commission of the two States, and was placed iu charge of Assi:staut (), H. Sinclair, who \Vas aided in 1883 hy Assistant U. II. Van Orden. 'l'hree sectiom; of the boundary had been traced out for a total distance of thirty-ft Ye miles and eight-tenths, "when it became necessar,y to suspend field operations. In Septtimber, 1885, 1\'Ir. Siuclair wa::i instructed to resume this sun-ey and push it to completion. Having met the Commissioners at Point Marion, Pa., be begau operations near that place by determining an azimuth so as to start a tangent in tbe prime vertical of the initial point as a reference line for the old marks on the parallel of latitude laid down by Mason and Dixon in the years 1763-1767. By September 24 all needed computations bad been made and the party ba\"iug been fully organized, the work of ranging out the tangent beg·au. 'l'be conutr;\' was wooded aud the line had to be opened ; there was also much rain;y weather, but despite all delays tlie raugiug out was completed for the entire tangent, a distance of more than uiueteeu miles, by tbe 8th of October. For the rueasurement of the line a small triangulation was laid out. In addition to this about fifteen miles of the second and third tangents which had been rang;ed out in 1883 were reYiewcd to see that the pegs set in that ;year to mark the places for the new monuments were still in place. All of the pegs ueeded for the new stones on the fourth or last tangent Wl're set hy the 2Gth of Octohcr. On this last tangent were found eighteen of the rnarkR or mounds left b~- l\Iason and Dixon, antl no changes were made in the boundar;r, as it had been <lecided by the Uommissioners that the old line was to he reproduced ancl marked. '£he mounds recovered WPre as a rule 011 the ridges, and most of them were in a fair state of preserrntion. .!\Iauy had been destroyed or lost, particular]_}~ those mile-marks that happened to fall on the hill-sides m: in rasiues. No attempt was made to restore the old mile-marks, but the new stone monumeuts were set in most ca:<.es so as to be iutervisible. Four maps were made, two for each State, on a scale of 1-40000, slluwing bow the surve:y wa:s conducted and the position of the monuments, which are of cut sandstone. The:se maps and a report of the surYey in duplicate have been sent to the chairman of the ,Joint Commission. Tracings of the maps and a copy of the report have been de1JOsited in the archin~s of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In April, 1886, Mr. Sinclair proceeded, under instructious, accompanied by members oft]Jc Commission, to set a large stoue monument to mark the point of juuction of the three States, I>euus~-1vania, West Virginia, and l\laryland. This duty accomplished, he returned to the office. In closing his report Mr. Sinclair suggests that in view of the number of State IJouudarics to be resurve~·ed, remarked, and in mauy ca,ises corrected, it might he addsable to obtain from Congress a special act authorizing the Superintendent to undertake the rectitlcatiou of these honntlaries when applied to by the Commissioners of the States iuterested. Other duty assigned to Mr. Sinclair during the fiscal .}·ear in Sections III, XV, nml XVI will be referred to under the headings of those sections. Plt,1Jsical liydrograplly of the Del,au:are River abot'e Pejfy's Island.-Having been authorized to continue his relations to the Harbor Commissioners of the port of Philadelphia as Secretary of the Unitetl States .Advisory Board, Assistant H. L. Mariudiu attended a meeting of tlrn Board iu Philadelphia, October 20 to 22, where he prepared a description of the location of turning points in the Port Warden lines of the city as recommended by the Ad ,-isor,y Board. Heturniug to 'Va sh· ington, he resumed his office-work, and remained there on duty till the middle of April, 1886, when he was instructed to proceed to Philadelphia and organize a party to continue the physical hydrograpby of the Delaware River above Petty's Island.

Plmwicffl h.11dro[1raphy-Obscri,ations of the formation and nwTement of ice in the Delau:are Rfrer.-Duriug tlie winters of 1878-1870 and 1881-1885, studies of the formation and mo>ement of ice in the JJelawarn Hi,·er wt're made part of tbc duty of Assistant S. 0. l\foUurkl~. In January, 188fi, M'r. l\Ic()ork]p. was directell to resume these studies. Iu addition to his own personal obser-. vations he rnalle arrangemeuts for obse1Tations of temperature, the weather, and the movement of ice h~· the l;eepers of eln'en ligllts bet'\\eeu the Horseshoe and the Breakwater during- the months of Januar,\~~ February, nnd Marcl1. Capt. George B. White, U.S. N., Light-House Inspeetor of the Fomth District, kindl~' exerted himM'if to obtain the necessary orders from the Light-House Board. Thermometers were sent to the light-keepers, arnl reports were received from all of them except from the Fourtecu-fm~t. Bank Light-ship, which was removed from her station 011 account of the ice soon after observations were begun. The co-operation oft he captains of the Winsor liue of steamers, of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad steam colliers and of the trustees of the city ice-boats was also obtained. The se-.erest cold of the winter occurred between January 10 and March 2. On the night of January 10 the river \¥as frozen over from Philadelphia to Dillingsµort, about ten miles below the city, and the ice eontinued solid or nearly so in. the coves and on the shoals till February 14, the channels being opened hy the ice- boats. Mr. l\lcCorkle remarks that steam-power is the solvent of the ice problem, and will continue to be so till the improvements now projected or in progress shall bave been completed. Beginuing with the 11ead of Pctt;y)s .18land, hil'l observations went to show that the dike built last autumn from Fisher's Point towards that island had the effect of causing a greater volume of water to flow through the western or Philadelphia channPl, and that b_y reason of this the river from Five-Mile Point dow11 bas lieen ]pss obi>tructed by ice than at an;y· time within bis knowledge. Owing partly to this, and partly to the constant trips of the four lines of powerful ferr,Y·boats which ply to and from the ,Jersey· shore, the river in front of the city has uecu less oU.structed b;y· ice th.au usual. Extremely low tides were noticed as prevalent during the \viuter; these were partly caused by· the prevailing northerly and westerlJ· winds, but in Mr. McUorkle's opinion tllere was another cause. In ma11y parts of the river the ice was solid during the whole period from ,January JO to February 14. l\Iucli of the floating ice would lodge under this, and a contraction of the tidal area would be the result, the \·olume of the flood tide being much lessened. He believes, therefore, tbat duriug a partial blockade of the 1-h'er by ice a much less quantity of water was drawn by the tide from the sea than ordin.uily, and he suggests the importance of tidal observations during a season of ic('. l\lr. McCorkle's elaborate report of his observations and conclusions is accompanied by a number of appt~ndices embodying the reports of the observers whom lie employed to co·o1)erate with him, and forms a contribution of valne to our knowledge of what is still at times, although but for brief periods, au obstruction to navigation in an important highway of commerce. Speoial survey of tl1e Schuylkill River betu:een Gray's Ferry and Rambo Point.-In compliance w.ith a request from .Mr. \V. H.. Tucker, cliairman of the rort Warden's Committee of Philadelphia, Mr. Charles J nnken was directed early iu July, 1885, to organize a party to make a detailed surwy of that part of the Schuylkill River between Gray's Ferry and Rambo Point. From the geodetic statious "Schuylkill .Arsenal" autl "Eastwick '.l'ower" a.s·a base, he determined by triaugnlatiou the new stations required for bis survey. Ou the 11th of July he began a plane-table sur-.e.y of the shore-line, and a fow days later commeuce1l to take soundings. For ti.Iese a plaue of rttference was obtained from a tide-gauge fixed on llnlkley's Wharf, COIUJ)9.fi80n8

Geodetic opm·aNons-Contirmation of tlic triangulcttfon mid reconnai.~8ancc of the southern part of the State of Neu- Jersey.-At the beginning of the fiscal year Prof. E. A. Bow1<er, Acting Assit>tnnt, had resumed field-work, in accordance with instructions, for the extension of the triangulatiou aml reconnaissauce in Southern New ,Jersey from the limitR of his work of the preyions seasou. 'l'lrn country being flat and thickly wooded with pine and cedar, the first work of the party -wai,; to build observiug tripods and scaffolds at Stations Hammonton, Blangie, and Martha, so as to rt-'lldrr these points intervisible. Tbe two stations first named are in Atlantic County, aud requirt-'d tripods forty-three and oue-balf feet high. At Station .Martha, about nine miles uortliwest of Tuck·

erton, Burlington County, the tripod was fourteen fectin height. Observations at this point were begun July 8, signals ha\'ing been erected at Apple Pie Hill and Ridgway in addition to tl.lo::;e · at Blangie and Hammonton. A number of tertiary points were also obserYed upon. · Care was taken by Professor Bowser to mark his station points securely. Granite posts, fonr and one-half feet long and dressed to six inches square for six inches from the top, were set iu hydraulic cement at each of the observing stations. The letters" U. S." were cut into each of the four faces of the po-sts, and upon top an equilateral triangle having sides three and oue-1.rnlf inches in leugth. Station Martha was marked in this way Julr 2!J, and on the 31st the party moved to Station Blangie, in Atlantic County, about two and one-half miles northea'5t of .Mas's Landing, on Great Egg Harbor River. At this station observations were completed September 22, a11d the party was transferred to Station Hammonton in the vicinity of the town of the same name in Atlantic Uonut,r. At this point observations for the season were closed November 5, though all of the measurements dt'sire<l had not been obtained, the weather becoming unfavorable, and experience ha\'ing sl10wn the inutility of attempti11g to continue horizontal angle obsen-atious later than November timt in New Jersey. On the !)th of November Professor Bowser resumed the reconnaissance from the line KelloggRm;sia where he had left it in November, 1884, and carried it westward and southward towardt< Bridgeton aud Mauricetown. The reconnaissance was attended with difficulties on account of a high ridge, covered with tall pines which ran northwesterly and southeasterly along MauricP River, and intercepted the view of signals as much as from seYenty to ninet,y feet in heigi1t. Search was made, but without success. for two stations of the primary triangulation of 18±5, Joscelyne and Pine. Finally, however, three additional points were selected, aid the recoumtissance was closed on the line Bridgeton-Fairton. During the season one hundred thirty-nine sets of observations were taken upon primary stations and fifty-four sets upon secondary or tertiary points. Towards the 1st of June, 1886, Professor Bowser was instruct.ed to resume the reconnaissance, as recommended in his report, westerly from the line Kellogg-Newfielu.

Owing to the limited balance of appropriation aYailable to the close of tbe fiscal year- 1884-1885, it became necessary to emplo;\· at first but two men in placing signals, repairing boat, &e., and then to work a sl10rt-ha11ded part.r in the field from June !) to June 30. Beginning at Fortescue Creek, the survey of tbe shore-line and a hi:'lt of topogmphical detail inland, averaging two miles in width was carried to Jacob's Creek, uearly opposite Bombay Hook, Oil tlle Delaware shore of the Ray. Scale of survey 1-20000. l\Ir. Bache remarks that the season was remarkably goo<l for field-work, almost tlle only time Jost in itii> direct execution being two days, when, through malicious mischief, :-;ome persons unknown rt>rn<ffe1l the signals for several miles along the bay shore. Some four or fin~ days also were occupied in supplying a deliciency iu tlJe triangulation, at one end of which a signal had been destroyed and its subsoil mark remoYP1l by some eYil-disposed persou, and at the other end au important signal and its underground mark destroyed b;\· a storm. But despite these disadvantages and the annoyance from the clouos of mosquitoes, remarkable even in tl1at localitt~, the almost uniform excellenee of tlie weather was snch that the season was a prochwt·h-e oue, and tlte work was prosecuted to co111pletio11 within an area difilcnlt to reach either by wagon or h_y boat, the general character of the ground being marsh, intersected by a meshwork of riYers arnl creeks, arnl with long tongues of fast land protrmli ng into it from tlic npland towards the shore of Del~are Bay.

is based upon two excellent surveys made forty years apart, the first hy Lieut. George S. Blake, U. S. N .· Assistant Coast Survey, in 1841-1843, and the second by Assistant H. L. l\larimliu and
by Ueuts. H.B. :Mamfield and Francis Winslow, U. S. N., Assistants, in 18~~-181'3. He discusses the location, crest, width, meau depth, and H'ctional :uea of the ;;l10al ~is dniYed from the sur...-ess, and accornpanic>s his report (AJJIJCndix No. 10) by corn11aratiw; talJl('S of dimensions and of channel depths in 1841-'42 anll 1883. He slJows that this remarkable shoal lJas lost over a ruile of its length, and that in this mile the bottom has dropped thirteen .feet. Other shoals l1aYc he(·n less affected, but a vast cllange is in progress, which extends to the month of the bay. Mr. Mitchell acknowledges his indebtedness to Assistant C. B. Bosd, :\Ir.""· Il.

Completion oftliehydrograpltic resurvey of Lou:er ])elau:are Bay awl Entrance.-U[l(kr i11structio1ts bearing date of June 17, 1885, Lieut. F. H. Crosby, U. S. N., Assista11t Coast antl. Geodetic Snrw,v organized his party on board the steamer Gedney aml proceeded to Delaware Entrance, where lie took up the bydrographic survey from the limits of the work of tLe prece<ling seasOIJ. A portiou of it was in the vicinity of Cape l\fay, New Jersey, and coverell the channels leading to that cape and the shoals adjacent to them. The remai))(ler was in Maurice RiYer Con·, bounded by a line from near Town Bank, New Jerse,y, to Cros8 Ledge Light, and theucc to Egg Ishrnd Light. Also. in Maurice River, the bydrograph;y of "·hich was completed to Wiggins' Landing. Besides the abo·e, an obstruction in Delaware Ri·er near 'Yilmingtou, Del., and a lump behind Delaware Breakwater were examined and located. Tides were observed at Cape :May Point during the work in tbat Yicinity, and the plane of reference used was that esta.blished by Lieutenant Hanus iu 1884. Other tide i;;tations were at Egg Island Light, New Jersey, .Maurice Riwr Light, Sew Jerser, at Port ~orris, N. J., and at a point off Fishing Creek, about one-third of the distance from :\Iauriee Hirer to Cape May Point, This last named was for purposes of comparison only. Two attempts were made to get a comparison between l\laurice HiYer ancl Cape May Point, with the infention of using t11e same plane of reference throughout the season's work, but there was such an e·ident dissimilarity of tides that Lieutenant Crosby felt obliged to place 110 reliance upon tile comparison, mid to establish a plane of reference at Maurice l{i,·er by conti11nom; obserYations for one lunation. Between the three gauges at Maurice River, Egg Island, and off Fishing Creek the agreement was very close .. Lieutenant Crosby remarks that a comparison of all of the tide stations as to times of high and low water, together with a perceptible increase of rise ancl fall obserwd in the bottom of ~Ianrice UiYer Cove, seems indicate that the tide fiows direct]~· into tlie bay, followiug the chanuels, and turns hack into the cove from the viciuity of Brandywine Shoal.

Bpecial swTcy for tlie Harbor Board C!f tlie Cif!f of Ba.ltimore.-'Reqaest having been made b,\· Mr. ~.II. llntton, :Engineer of the II arbor Board of the City of Baltimore, in behalf of that Board for the detail of an officer of the Coast allll Goedetic Survey to mark out the Port \Varden lines ot the city, and connect them with -the triangulation of the Survey, A1<sistant 0. H. Tittmann was instrnctetl early in June, 1-:)SG, to coufor with Mr. Hutton and execute the work desired . .Mr. Tittmann began the necessary examinations June 15, and at the close of that month was engaged in making trigonometric observations, asshsted by )fr. J. Henrs Turner, Aid in the Sunc;y. },Jagnetic ob.~errations at Balt-imore and Wa.shington.-Determinations of the magnetic declinatiou, dip, and intensity were made by Subassi8tant J.B. Baylor in the fall of 1885 at Fort :McHenry, Baltimore Harbor, in order to obtain results which would afford additional material for ascertain· iug tl1e secular change of the magnetic elements. The station of 1885 was the same as that occu]lietl hy l\Ir. Baylor in 18i7, and near the station at whi<·h similar obser,·~tions were made by Assi8ta11t Schott in 1856. Before and after his season's work (which is referred to under the heacliug of Section II) Mr. Ba~ lor obsen·ed at the station on Capitol Hill, Washington, with the dip circle, to determine the intensity by the Llo.Yd method at the several places of ohsen·ation <luring his magnetic tour. .1lnnual determination of the magnetic dip, decl-inat-ion, antl fatensity at the station on Capitol Hill, ffashing/on, D. C.-Determinations of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity ha,·e lteen made annual!J· at a station on Capitol Hill, \Vashington, by Assistant Charles A. Schott <luri.ng a period of nineteen years and at less regular intervals for thirty years. The results of the obsen·ations made June 14, 15, and 16, 1886, proved to be in accord with the amount of annual change heretofore determined for the magnetic elements. Assistant Schott remarks that the old maguet used for tl1e measure of the earth's magnetic intensity was found not to ha\'e lost mag1wti8m appreciably for teu years, a fact, which he supposes due the position iu which the magnet is kept, north ernl down, so tlrat it is always under the influence of tlie earth's induction. These determiuation:s, made witlr care arnl skill, and under practic~lly unchanging cou<litious duriug so many years, have an exceptional ,·alue as a contribution to our kuowle1lge of the 8ecular change of the magnetio-elements on the Atlantic seaboard. Determination of the geograph·ical JJOsition of tlte Wa.~hington Jfonument.-I n order to determine trigonometricall;.,- the geographical position of the \Vasliingron Mo1rnrnent, At<sistant U. ll. Sinclair was directed to connect it with the triangulation of the District of Columbia. He began this work April 7, 188u, erected the necessary signals and made all the observatious required in four days. Stations Ueform School, Du Pont, Stanton, antl Immue Asylum were occupied, with enough observations from the latter point to bring the station 'l'heologfoal Seminary of the main series into the scheme. On account of the known angles and distances in the adjusted triangulation of the District of Columbia it was only necessary to measure a few angles at the four sta1 ions above mentioned to b1fog in the Washington Monument. Niue migles were measured by two lrnmlred and fifty-four observations with a ten-inch Gambey theodolite. 'l'he records and computations were deposited in the office. Other duty assigue<l to Mr. Sinclair is referred to under the headings of Sections lI: XV, an1l XVI. Continuation of the detailed topographical suney of the Di,strict of Oolumbia.-At the beginning of the fi:scal year the topographical survey of the Di:strict of Columbia, under the direction of A:s:sistant .T. 'V. Donn, had l>eeu advanced westward to an irregular line drawn from a·poiut on the Potomac I:.iver, son th west of tlle junction of the Uondnit and New Out roads, northeasterly to Hatters Parrott on the Hidge road, thence to the angle of Tunlaw road at the crossing of ,Foundry

Brauch, and along that road to the Teunallytown an<l RockYille turnpike, and uortheastwar<ll_v from that point to 'Voodley lane, along that road to the Klingle Fortl road, down that road to Kliugle's Iine1 and thencP> in an irregular line to Rock Creek Ford road and the Daniel road, and from thence to the crossing of the Dis.trict line by the l:;eventh street road. During the summer and fall months of 1885 the operatious of 1\:Ir. Donn's party were priuci1>ally cnntined to the open country adjacent to the Tennallytown and Pierce's l\lill roads, \Yootlley lane anti the Graut Military road, and the Loughborough and Tnnlaw roads. Tlrnre were m:rn~ small areas of woods that could not be entered until the trees became bare of lea,·es, lmt these were completed early in the winter. Klingle Ford road was opened in September, and to make the original sheets upon whicll it fell perfect, its line was run and its grades connected with contour;; formerly run, as soon as it was possible to work to advantage through that he~wily-woodeil reg-iou. During the period of the most intense cold, wlJilc the snow co.-ered the·ground, work wa:,; entered upon in the valley of Soapstone Creek, an area \'ery difficult to pass through wilh au iustmmental survey, being thickly covered with woods and entirely shut in from facilities for the determination of positions by means of triangulatiou points. The only resource was the running of numerous traverse lines intersecting and checking each other. Excepting the area lying within the angle of the Grant l\Iilitary and the Broad Branch roads the work was satisfactorily completed by the time the opening leaves again compelled a return to open grounds. In Ma;y, 1886, the survey was resumed on the western side of Foundr~· Branch auu pushetl across the Ridge road and over the country bounded by that road and the Conduit and Chain Bridge roads. Mr. Donn's report is accompanied. by a map showing the area O\'er wllich tlle surrny lJad been completed at the beginning of the fiscal year and the additional area surveyed up to June 30, 1886. After a full consideration of the amount of work accomplished, he comes to the conclusion that the work will be completed in the time originally estimated, namely, ten yea1·s from the beginning iu February, 1881. . The office-work, which involves the preparation of original sheets for the archiYes of the Survey and the preparation of tracings, drawings, and level records for the immediate use of the Engineer Commissioner of the District, keeps Mr. Donn and his party closely occupied upon all occasions when acth·e field-work is impossible. Gravity research.-Pendulum oscillations at Wa.skington.-Reference has already been made under the heading of Section II to the occupation of a series of gravit.r stations by Assistant Charles S. Peirce with the inYariable reversible pendulums, Peirce No. 2 (a meter in length) and No. 3 ~a yanl in length). For comparison with the results at these stations, the same pend11lums were oscilhtted i11 .April, 18SG, at the permanent gravity station which had been established iu the SmitbsoniaH Institution. For this work time signals were furnished by- the Superintendent of the NaYal Observatory. Approximate results have been obtained and the final reductions are iu progress. Hydrographic examinations for the Ooast Pilot in Chesapeake Bay and its tributarics.-lu pursuance of instructions dated April 6, 1886, Lieut. G. H. Peters; U. S N., Assistant Coast :rnd Geodetic Survey, took command of the steamer Arago, and, ha\·ing organized his party on board of be1·1 took up such bydrographic examinations in Chesapeake Bay and its trilmtaries as were needed to complete for publication the manuscripts of Subdivisions 17 au!l 18 of the Atlau; ic Local Coast Pilot. These examinations included the Potomac lliver and the streams tributary to it, Tangier aud Pocomoke Sounds and their tributaries and the more southerly waters on the eastern shore of the bay, the waters of the lower bay and the rivers of its western shore, including the Patuxeut aud the Patapsco, and extended thence to the northward for work in the upper bay and its tributaries. Lieutenant Peters reports that much delay and serious inconvenience "·as caused by frequent rains antl fogs. With regard to the charts of the Survey which he had occasion to consult and study iu co:1nection with the Coast Pilot work, he observes that while the field-work for some of them was done mall;\' years· ago, yet in these cases the changes that have taken place do not materi<1ll,r affect their value for such waters as a stranger would be apt to attempt to mn-igate by a chart.

On June 16, llai;ing completed the work assigned to him: Lieutenant Peters was detached fl'Om the .Arago an<l ordered to \Vashington to resume his duties in the office. Search for (t shoal reported o:ff .Assa.teague Light.-A shoal having been reported off Assa· teagne Light, an<l uot laid down on the charts, in a letter from the Hydrographer of the Navy 1Jepartrneut, under date of October 1, Lieut. J. E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Ue()(letic Surn>y, comman<ling the steamer Blake, was <lirected to make search iu the vicinity. Lieutenant PiNsbnry reports that neither the soundings be took, nor auy of the e\·idence Le ou1aiuell from the captains of coast-line steamers who pass over or Yery near the ·locality t'\"('I'.\~ trip, gave indications of shoal water as reported. He thinks it probable, therefore, that the ~d1ooner -which strnek was out of her reckoning. Examination of line of precise lei-els from Hagerstozcn, Md., to Fortress Monroe, Fa.-A11 error of apparently a meter having been discovered in the line of precise levels from Hagerstown, Md., to Fortress l\lonroe, Va., .Assistant .T. E. "' eir, was instruetell to organize a party for the purpose of m uking a close examination of t be liue in order to ascertain where the error in it bad occurred: The party was organized at Richmond, Va., and the work begun May 28. In making the examination, the method adopted was to connect the line of levels with tide-water at Washington, Fredericksburg, and Richmond, thus dividing the whole line into four sections from fifty to ninety miles each. As the line had uecu referred to tide-water at \Vashington in 1884, the work of examination was begun at Richmond. Reference to the tide-gauge used by the Army Engineers in the imprO\'ement of James Hirnr gave mean half-tide as observed at Richmond 0.1258 meter a\Jm·e mean sea-level at Fortress Monroe. The connection that was made with tide-water at Washington gave mean half-tide as there observed 0.30 llleter abo\~e meau sea-level at Sandy Huok. :Meau half-tide at Washington and Richmond should be approximately the same above Sandy Hook and Fortress Monroe, but the line of levels gives a difference of O.li4 meter, or 6.85 inches. This led to the supposition that the error was probably a cumulative one; Lenee it was <lecided to nm a single line of check levels as far as Ashland, Va. 7 sixteen miles from Rich· mon<l, and the tendency to cumulative er~or being sufficiently marke<l in this distance, it was thought best to continue the line of check le> els to Milford, forty miles from Richmond. From Richmond to Milford there was a cumulative error of 0.198 meter, or about 7.8 inches. The old line was then con11ected with tide-water at Fredericksburg. This garn mean half. tide as observed at Fredericksburg 0.4968 meter above Sandy Hook, indicating a cumulative enor of U.l!lG8 meters between \Vashingtou and Fredericksburg. l{.esults obtained by continuing the line of check levels from Milford to Frederick1;burg left little reason to doubt this tendency to cumulative error in the line of geodesic le\·eling betweeu Hagerstown aud Fortress :Monroe, and Allow the necessity of adopting such checks as will reduce it to a minimum. Field operations were closed and the party disbanded June 2.3, Mr. Weir reporting for duty at the Office. He ackowlcdges the efficient service rendered by Mr. John Nelson, Aid.

Coast and Geoderic Survey, commau<ling the schooner Scoresby, was iustrueted to undertake this work in March, 1886. The preYious experience of this officer in iuvestigations aud surveys of a similar character in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries had s1u0 dall~- qualified him for the proposed surYeys in tile sounds of Nortll Carolina.. LC'aving Norfolk A1n·il 2 and p:H~s-ing tlJrong-h tlic Alllemarle and Olie:;apeake Canal, the Scoresby rea-ched Beaufort, N. O., April 11. The passage through the ~orth Carolina s0uml8 was utilized by a rough examiuatiou of the ground to be gone onr, by observations of water densities, and the co1lectiou of information expected to be of use in the future. Ou the l~th of Ap1·i! aetive work in the field was beguu, its general scheme contemplating the establishment with reference to Coast Survey triangulation points of all the oyster-beds of the State; that is, to define tliem as accurately as possible on regular projections, and then to exaruinfl more general!~- the areas supposed to be suitable for the planting of oyster-lwds arnl as far as possible to indicate 011 the cliarts the extent. of such areas and their location. The determiuation of the. positions and areas of existiug oyster-beds is accomplished by the method8 usuall~' employed in hydrograpltic surve;ys, modified or cxpamled as circumstances may require. They are detailed at loogtl1 in Lieutenant 'Vinslow's elaborate paper ou tlie Chesapeake beds, pnulished as Appendix No. 11 to the report of the Superintendent for 1881. In the examinatiou of areas presumed to be suitable for tlie maintenance of oysters is iuclnded the study of the depth aud density of the water, character of the bottom, streugt,lt of currents, actiou of wirnl and tide, and effoct of ice, freshets, and other abnormal inftnences. A stutly of the fauua is also· required. A.ll of these various branches of work were. kt>pt in aeti\·e prosecution from thC' time of beginning the surveys, and by June 30 had included the Newport and North Ri'l'ers, the inld of Back Sound, and the greater portion of Core Sound. Up to the close of the fiscal :year Lieutenant \Vinslow reports that about tif:ty t.l10mmnd acre8 of gronnd had been gone over and about two thousand beds had been locatea, and that although it was not then possible to fix their exact areas, the total area wms inconsiderable when compare<l with the large acreage which is suitable for oyster culture. It is expected that the data collected by the part.y and the information which will lJe arnila bleby the close of tlie season will enable the legislature of the State to adopt some scheme by 'lfhich the enormous area now unproductive may be turned to account. Oonnectionoftlietriangulations of 1853 and 18i3 on the coast of North Oamli11a.-Bcach meas· urement near the boundm·y line between North and South Oarolina.-In order to make a conuection between the triangnlations of 1853 and 1873 in th<~ vicinity of Beaufort, N. C., aud to Hecute other work reqnired on tha.t coast, Subassistant W. C. Hodgkins was instructed to organize a. party in December, B85. Upon reacliing Beaufort in January. 1886, he began without delay the work of searcliing for the old triangulation poinb:; in Core Sound, Beaufort Harbor, and Bogue Sound. The extremely cold weather and the hard frozen ground was nnfavorable for field opera .. tions; the sounds and creeks were for the. most part closed by ice. Until tlie middle of February the search for the old points was continued without much success, but three being found out of fourteen. l\fnch time was necessaril,v consumed in digging for the underground m!lrks. At this stage of operations, and before taking up the triangulatiou, the work was temporaril~· suspended in order to transfer the party to Smithville for the purpose of co-operating with the party of Assistant D. B. vVa.inwright in the beach measurement intended to connect the triangn. lation of Cape Fear River with that near Little River, whero the boundary line between .XorfL and South Carolina touches the coast. . For the double purpose «Jf ooonomy in transportation and to reconnoitr6 the coast between Beaufort and Cape J<'ear, Mr. Hodgkins obtained a sharpie drawing about ten inches of water and in it left 'Beaufort, February 18, with his tents, instruments, and two men, making the trip mostl;y through the narrow creeks and shallow sounds Jyiug uetween the beach and the mainland. He fonnd but little difficulty in proceeding except· on the divides between the inlets at low tide. Arriving at Fort Caswell, Cape Fear River .Entrance, February 23, and joining Mr. \Vain. wright's part.y there, a wire measurement abng the beach was begnr. by the two parties conjointly,

the augular measurements uee<led being ma<le in part by Mr. Wainwright and in part by Mr. Hodgkins. Upon the completion of this work early in niay, and the reference of the beach measurement to the meri<liau by the measurement of au astronqmical azimuth at Fort Caswell, Mr. Ho<lgkins returned. to his first fieltl of labor, aud took up the triangulation between Beaufort and Core Sound. [u the measurement of the angles at the several stations it was generally found necessary to elenite the instrument about fifteen feet above the ground. The stations recovered, four in number, were cor.uecte<l by the triangulation with one of the sides of the old work, Davis Shore and Bell's Point, aud fartl1er towards Beaufort a uotller cormcctiou was made at the Station Lynch. Unfor. tunatel.r no point directly conuccte<l witb Lynch in tbe old triangulation couhl be recovered, but, the court-house at Beaufort was redetermined and afford8 an indirect clleck. The old point at Da,·is Island, connected with Davis Sbore and Bell's Point, was also redetermined. Cape Lookout Ligltt-hou8e was connected with the triangulation of Core Sound, and a topographical survey was made of the shore of the important harbor of refuge in Lookout Bight. l\Ir.

Under the heading of Section U reference is made to duty a.ssigned to l\lr. Hodgkins earlier iu tl1e fiscal :year. Junction of the tt·ia.ngulation at the mouth of Cape Fear River with that at Little Rfrer Inlet.Ju order to connect the triangulation of Cape Fear River, executed by Assistant O. P. Boll~s, in 1853-'59, with tbat of .Assistant 0. H. Tittmann, carried up from the southward along the South Carolina coast us far as Little River Inlet, in 1873, Assistant D. B. ·wainwright was instructetl to orgauize a party early in December, 1885. Th~ work was begun by a search for thft old points which had been established on the coastliue, the party being either in camp on the beach or making trips of several days' length in an open sail-boat. Much hanl:sllip was endured, owing to tlie unusual severity of the winter. No stations could be fom1d south of SmithYille, the changes that ha\'e occurred along the coast from the action of wind and tide being Yery great. It became necessary, therefore, to start the triangulation from three points in the vicinity of Smithville. The greate~ part of the distance was measureLl by wire; and from an azimuth observe<l at Fort Caswell, and carriccl southwarcl by stations about four miles apart, the measurement was cllecked in direction. Iu this work, which was finished May 4, Assistant W. C. Hodgkins cooperated most effecti\-ely, I.tis own parts and that of Mr. Wainwright working in conjuuction. Soon after }fr. Wainwright's return to ·washington he received instructions to prepare for the resumption of topographical work near New York, as mentione1l under the heading of Section II. Hydrographic e;1.:a.111inations in the 'vicinity of Frying Pan Shoal"8.-0n the voyage northwald of tbe :steamer Blake, in command of Lieut. J. K Pillsbury, U.S. N., Assistant CoastandGeodeticSurvey, examinations were made in .June, 188(i, in the vicinity of Frying Pan Shoals, North Carolina, to fix the locality of certain shoal spots recently reported as not shown on the charts. Search to tlJe eastward of ti.re light-vessel led to tuc discovery of a rocky patch of perhaps oue,fourth of a mile iu diameter, situated near the fh·c and three-quarter.fathom spot shown on the chart. The shoalest water on' this patch of rock was found, by steamiug and drifting over it with six leads goi11;;, to be four and three-quarter fathoms . ..\11 (~xu,mination made to the westwar<l of the light-vessel to ascertain the correctuess of tbe souudings shown on the chart' developed the fact tbat Captain March, of the steamer Johns Ilopkius, was probably correct in his statement that he had found thirteen and one-half fathoms uear the position of ele\.·en awl one-half fathoms on the geue.ral coast chart, Cape Hatteras to Cape Uomaiu.

Hydrographia examinations in llortlt and South Santee Biuris, Bull's Bay1 l'rfrl".~, Capers, and Dewees Inlets, and Charle.~ton Harbor, South Carolina.-In conformity with instructions i~sued i11 December, 188:i, Lieut. G. U. Hanus, U. S. N., A~sistant Coast autl Geodetic Survey, !Jayiug organized his party on board the steamer Endeavor, left New York for Charleston towards the end of that month, anrl early in January, 1886, began hydrographic work in Bull's Bay. To obtain a plane of reference for the soundings, a staff-gauge was put up at .Tack's Creek. · bomparisons of this gauge, made from time to time during the progress of the work with tl1e self. registering gauge ut Fort Sumter, showed that the tides at the two places hatl the same rise and fall and that tLte high and low waters occured simultaneously. All of the soundings taken in Bull's Bay were reduced to the mean low water of the gauge at Jack's Creek. The bench-mark for this gauge is a brass bolt driven into the wall of an old fort in the point of woorls about one hundrt.~d and fifty meters to the sontl1ward of the mouth of Jack's Creek. During the months of February, March, and part of April the in-shore antl offshore li_ydrography of Bull's Bay, Prices, Capers, and Dewees Inlets, and North and South Santee ltirers was completed as 1aid out on the projections. Staff-gauges were established at Capers Inlet aud at South Santee River, and compared with the Fort Sumter gauge. For the work atthe inlet I', lmt one point of the old triangulation could be found; it became necesEary therefore to measure a base on the coast and connect one of the encts of the base with the triangulation by obserrntions for azimuth. The sounding was afterwards done either by campiug parties from tho inside or from the vessel anchored outside. Upon the completion of this work Lieutenant IIanus procee<le<l in the Endeavor to Charleston, S.

in the main ship channel near the southern bar. Mariners were immediately warned of thi:s danger by a Notice (No. 73) iF.sued from the office of the Survey, May 12, 188G. .Another result of Lieutenant Hanus's survey was the preparation of full sailing directions for crossing the bar and entering the harbor, with recommendations for such changes in the aids to navigation as would make the entrance easy for the deepest vessels that enter the port. The tidal observations used in the reduction of soundi11gs on the bar were all obtained from the staff-gauge at Fort Sumter wharf. .A great number of observations were obtained also from the self-registering gauge at Fort Sumter. The Charleston Harbor work was finished the middle of Ma;y, and the Endtavor was taken north. Ou the way up the coast, Lieutenant Hanus made examinations for the location of a shoal reported off False Cape, Virginia. He states that a number of shoals were found~ but that none of them ought to be dangerous, for the simple reason that no naYigator ordinarily cautious could be caught so uear the shore in the vicinity of a shoal already charted.

J. E. Pillsbury, U. S.

En'ry opportunity was taken dnring the season to obtain the obst'lrvatious for currents, tlle ouly break of any length of time heing about ten days, when it became necessary to go to New Orl<·aus for bituminous coal, that at Key \Vest having been destroyed in the great fire tlie1·e in the earls part of April. \Vhen at anchor in the Stream, the Blake needed to have at all times a grca t prc1>sure of steam on her boilers, so that the anchor could lie weighed and the engines started :it a moment's notice, and for this reason harcl coal could uot be used. The weather iu l\larch awl .April was abnormally bad, strong northerly winds anti heavy seas prm~ailing most of the time, and in its general character the season was totally unlike that of the sear !1efore. At the Bahamas and at Key \Vest the winter of 1885-'86 was said to ham been more sHere than e,·er before know11 1 fish in Yast numbers having been killed or benumbed on the shoal,;. In 1885 during April nnd }fay there was seldom.a day on which rain did not fall, while in 1886 there was scarcely one shower during either month. From local evidence Lieutenant Pill~ huQ· concludes that 1885 was nearly a normal year while 1886 was abnormal. Current meters of the isamc pattern as those of last year were used in taking the observations. These meters were described and figme<l by Lieutenant Pillsbcry in his paper published as .Appendix No. H to the report for 1885. This season, one meter was used for the surface and another for the subsurface currents, and the two were frequently interchanged. This increased the rapidity with \Tliich thP <lata for an~· depth were obtained. Some changes to secure .,, "Teater efficiencv were also made iu the anchoring gear.

Iu his elaborate report, which appears as Appendix No. 11 to this volume, Lieutenmit J>illsbury submits a discussion of the most salient features presented by the observations of the season of 1886, including those also of the year before, in order to show the agreement between tlie two. He considers : I.-:-The g·eueral cl.iaracteristics of the Gulf Strearu as de,·eloped by tl1e ohserrntious. JI.-Tbe dail.r variation of the Stream. III.-lts monthly yariation. IV.-Axis of the Stream. V.-Efi:'ect of wind on its velocity and. the position of its axi::;. VI.-Depth of tile Stream aHd velocity at different depths, VII.-General summary, witll rules for the guidance of navigators. Referring to his report of last year's observations in the same waters, be concludes from the observatiomi of this year also that there is a daily variation of the Stream, that there is a montbly variation, and that the axis of the Stream is not situated at the poiut at which it was geuerally supposed to be. These were his conclusions of last year, aml lw finds 110 occasion to reverne or modify them. · vVith regard to the velocity of the current, he remarks, towards tile close of his paper, that tile examinations ha,'ing been made in .March, April, l\1ay, and June, the conclusions may be iucorrect for otller seasons of the year, altllough there are no good reasons for supposing such to be the case, except possibly in the amount of the variations. He finds that between Fowe;r Rocks, Florida. and Gun Cay, Bahamas, the current varies daily in velocity, at times as mucll as twound a half knots, the greatest velocity being generally about nine hours before the upper transit of tile moon; that the variations are most excessive 011 the west side of the straits anu least 011 the east side; that the axerage daily currents vary 1lnring the month, the strouge;.;t coming a day or two after the greatest declinatiou of the moon; and that the axis of the Gulf Stream at this point (tlic position of the strongest surface flow) is eleven and one-half miles east of the Fowcy Hocks Light-house. The strongest surface current found here was five and one-quarter knots per hour, the least one and tllree-quarters knots, and the aYerage three and six-tenths knots. Lieutenant Pillsbur_y's report is accompanied by complete records of his obsen-atious, arn.l by diagrams representing graphieallJ- the daily anrl monthly variations in the strength of the current, the \'elocities at different depths, &c. He acknowledges the hearty and int.t_·lligent cooperation of the officers attached to the party (Ensigns T. D. Griffin, R. l\I. Hughes, A. G. Rogers, J. H. Hetherington, and F. J{. Brainard, U. S. N.), and makes special mention of the master-atarms, Jens fetersen, to whose care and vigilance aud knowledge of the mechanical portion of the working gear m~tch of the success of the season was <lue.

Before proceeding northward Lieuteuant Pillsbury ran a line of deep-sea soundings from the Florida l{eefa to Salt Key Bank, and thence to the Bahama Bauks, and directed the examination of a seventeen-feet spot found in Southwest Channel, Key "'est Harbor. Other hydrographic dut,r executed by him is reported under. the headings of Sections I io l V, inclusive. Beaclt measurement and triangulat-ion, with observa.tions fur _la.titude and azimuth, un the 1cest coast of Flori.du between Gape Sable and Cape Romano.-In order to fill the gap in the sm·Hy of the west coast of Florida between Cape Sable and Cape Homauo, and specially with a riew to obtain the shore outlines for the coast charts, Assistant Joseph Hergesheimer "IV<lS instrncted to organize a party in the schponer Quick. After repairing the vessel and completing his preparations for the season's work on that comparative!~· isolatecl coast, l\fr. Hergesheimer made an anchorage at Sanibel Light-house, January 3 1 18S6. This Light.house, which stands ou the east eml of Sanibel Island, near the entrance to San Carlos Bay and the port of Pnnta Rasa, was determined

in geographical po.sitiou, three statio11s being occupied for this purpose, and also an eccentric station at the Light-house. ·The uext work executed was the beach measurement from Cape Romano to Oaximbas Pass, in onlm· to determine the position of Cape Romano, and obtain a base from which to carry the triangulation towards Cape Sable. For this work the party was established in camp at Qaximbas anrl at Cape Homano, tlle scllooner ha;>ing been left in charge of one man hi a safe anchorage imdlle of Coon Key. The line measure was made with lJeach-tapes over trestles wliicll were aligned and leveled. This work, with the erection of signals at Caximbas Pass and Cape Romano, and those needed on the liIJe, wus finishcll February 3, and in order to determine the-azimuth of the line, Subassistaut E. D. l'rcston with Aid J. H. Gray were left in the camp already established at Cape Romano, while ~Ir. Hergesheirner arniled himself of a trip of the sch.ooucr to Punta Rasa for wat~r and provisions to make a reconnaissance of the coast from Cape Romano to Coral towards Pavilion Key, and erected signals at Uoon Key, ,Johnson, Horse Key, and Coral, and a water signal at Flossy. , Upon the completion of the observations for azimuth at Cape Romano the party was transferred to tlte schooner, and proceeding to Cape Sable, an astronomical station was estaNished there for the tletermination of the latitude, and the azimuth of the line, Cape Sable to Palm Point. ·while this work was in progress signals were erecte(l for the triangulation between Cape Sable and Capt~ Romauo. The nenessar.v reconnaissance, erection of signals, aud the observations of horizontal angles occupied the time between April 7 and l\lay 2. At that date, the astronomical work having been completed, Mr, Preston proceeded north under instructions, and Mr. Bergesbeimer took up the work- of recovering tbe primary base-line at Cape Sable, which had been meastued by Superrntemlent Bache in 1855. TLle difficulties incident to this work, arising from changes in shore-line and the growth of trees during thirty-one years, were successfully ~vercome. Heavy cutting was required to O!)en the line from the astronomical station to Wet Base. The marks at this .end of the Base were found in good condition. The direction to East Base was then carefully laid off, the distance measured with a chain, and the station mark at East Base together with the intermediate mile-posts fountl in good condition. The azimuth aml latitude station at East Cape was then connected with the Uase, and on the completion of this work June 2, field operations were closed for the season.

In passing tlrn Cape, vessels of any draught shonl(l kc<:>p in Ho less than 'five fathoms. ::'\Iany other details of iuterest to im\·ig·ators arc given by .:\lr. Hcrgesheimer iu hi.:; report. In making a reconuaissance for the connection of the triangulation between Cape Sable aud Cape Romano he found the coast a mass of islands, covered "ith a growth of high 111aug1wrn trees. A beach measure would be impracticable, owing to tlte IJrokeu sl10re-li11e, an<l a triangulation, with all of the signals on shor<·, would iuvolve the erection of Yery high tripods, much cuttiug, and hea,·y expense. He recommends, therefore, that the triangulation be carried along tile coast by a s,ystem of signals, part on shore and part in the water, at an aYerage distauce from shore of four miles. By this.method the triangulation from Cape Romauo to Pa\·iiiou Key was completed with satisfactory results. These water signals, which would be in an an~rage dept Ii of about ten feet of water, will also be of much ad\'antage to the hydrographic parties along the coast.

Topographical surrey of the irest coast of Florida, north of Anclote ][e!fs.-For the completion of the topographical surrny of the west coast of Florida, north of Anclote Keys to the southern limit of the surve;y of 1869 at 'Yall Creek, Snbassistant \V. frying Vinal was instructed to organize a party in No,·ember, 1885. ::'\Ir. Vinal located his first camp at Point Riche;r, at the mouth of the Pitil Iocliasscootie Rin~r, and began his surve,y early in Jan nary, 1886. By going back to t!Je work of 1884 be was enabled to start a plane-table triangulation aloug the coast, and thus to recover many of the points cstabished in the surveys made between 1857 and 1861. The location of the camp was chaug-ed to Hudson, Harnack Ureek, and finally to Br.yport during the season. More than usual difficulties were encountered in making the surrny on account oft lw extrt>mt>ly shoal water tlie Gulf of 1\iexico near the coast line, the entire lack of beach, the freque11c~· (1f small creeks, and the absence of roads. Facilities for transportation were extremely limited, involving delays and much expense. During part of January the weather was so severe that tlel\l. work had to be suspended, the party snffering great inconvenience antl hanlilhip on act:ouut or the frequent northers ancl the extreme cold. ' The various features of the cotmtry, as shown on tlie plane-table sheets, are tlte shore-line, ri\'ers and creeks, islands I~·ing adjacent to the coast; oyster reefs and exposed rocks; exteusirn salt marshes containing islands, ponds, and out-cropping limestone rock; woods, including maugron\ palmetto, scrub, cedar, pine, oak, and mixed hummock. Tracings of the shore.line, showing location of positions tletermined by the planc-ta.hle, were furnishell to the bydrographic party on board the steamer Bache, Lieut. J. M. Hawley, F. S.

The shore-line and geographical positions, as far as determined, were ohtainecl from Subassistant "'·I. Vinal, who had charge of a topogTaphical party on that coast. .A. tide-gauge wns estab. lislietl at Bayport, autl observations ke1Jt up throughout the 8eason, night an<l day, b;rtwo observers detailed for the purpose. Soundings were begun March 11, and from that date were continued whernwer the weather would permit till May 24. During 1\Iarch and the greater part of April tl1 e \Yeatlier was 'rt·ry uufa\·orahle for sounding, lmt l\lay provell to be a most fa>orable month for the work, and full ad\antage was takf'll of it; two parties working llaily, leaYing the ship at ·G.30 a. m. and returning not earlier 1ba11 ij p. rn., and sometimes much later. During a short time in April it became necessary for the steamer to he away, having· to go to l\folJile for coal, and in order that the work might go on without interrnp. tion, Lienlenant Hawlt>y established a party of four officers and twelve.men on shore at Bnyport in charge of Ensign E.

C7ufortuuately the launch broke her shaft the first clay out, so that the part;diad . to ·lepentl entirely on the boat; still they r;in over one hundre<1 miles of soundings and erected a unrnh<'I' of signals during tl.te ten days the ship was away. J,ines of sounding were ran with the ship at a distance of one mile apart, connecting with tbc boat work and extending out to a depth of ten fathoms; most of these lines were over twent_y miles Jong, and their outl'l' limit was from thirty to thirty-five miles from the shore-line. Obsern1tions to find the strength and direction of the tidal current were taken at different. anchorages of tbe ship, but no very satisfactory results were obtained, !duce the direction and strength of the current appear:J to be almost wholly influenced by the direction and force of thC' winu.

The following na \'igatiou uott·s comnnmicatetl b_y Lieutenant Hawley will be of iuterest: "It i:-; da11gerous for vessels drawing nine feet or more of water to venture on Saint Martin's Heef, which extt·rnb from Xorth Auclote Keys to Cedar Keys south, owing to the numerous coral reefs and oyster-beds that crop out in unlooked for places. By keeping in not less than fourteen feet of water these da11g1~r."l will be avoitled. There is a channel inside the reef extending from North Anclote Ke~'s to the northward, iu which nine feet can be carried as far as the survey extended this year. This channel is nse<l by the c:>aoiting steamers. Formerly it was marked b~· a line of beacons plaeed about fi\·e miles apart, but there are none standing now. The anchorage at.

In 1884 he had established a permanent bench-mark for reference of gemh·,.;ic ll'Yeliug operations on the custom-house in Mobile. 'l'he first trestle encountered which retarded nry much tlie })rogress of the work was that at Biloxi Bay. The track is ten feet above the surface of Urn water, and the trestle-work supporting it rests on piers fifteen feet apart and of six }liles each. This was found to be very Htable, so muc11 so that at one point where a bencb.-mark was established 011 an old pile not connected with the trestle, but which sto0<l near the track and could be observed carefully, no vertical motion was perceptible when an express tra.in passed over the trestle at the rate of twenty-five miles per llonr. There was a draw-pier abou~ half way of the trP.stle, an(l it wa11 plannetl to cross ilie ua~- b;y

means of simultaneous obsen·ations on the west hank and on the draw-pier and then on the drawpier and on tbt> east bank, thus diYiding the whole trestle into two sections, and reducing the length of the sights to one-half the width of the ba.r. Simultaneous observations were thus made 011 three different days. Encouraged by the great stability of the trestle it was decided to run a line of levels across the bay by setting up the instrument on the trestle and taking short sights each of about one hundred meters. A difference of but four millimeters between the greatest and least of four measurements was obtained, and this was a sufficient proof of t11e excellence of the results. Two of the lines across the trestle were run in an easterly and two' in a westerly direction, aud no trains passed while running from one bench to another. When winds and currents pre\-ailed no good work could be done, but nuder the conditions nuder whicll the work was accomplished it is belim·ed that tllis is as strong as any other part of the line. At Hay Saint Louis both metllods were used in crossing, but cm account of the relatiYely long 1fo;tance over the trestle-work it was thought best to rnn six lines instea<l of four. At the Rigolets, on account of the depth of the water, forty feet in the channel, and the wind and almost cou ~inuous current, it was not possible to run a line O\'er the bridge and trestle, so that the method of simultaneous obsern1tions alone was used, but the observations were continued uut il a good crossing -was made. , Ou reaclliug the outer edge of the city of ~ew Orleans, in order to avoid running through the ·most frf'qne:.ited streets, it was decided to take what is known as the Gentilly road, and so get around the city to Carrollton. At Carrollton, wbere the party arriYed April 12, the line of len·ls was referred to the bench-mark established in 1875 on the iron step of the Carrollton Railroad depot. Xext day the party was transferred to Meridian, Miss., in order to accomplish as much as cou Id l>e done with the balance of funds an1ilable, towards filling- the gap in the line of precise lewli11g between that station and Citronelle, Ala., reference to whicl:f is made in the re1wrt for 1884. Upon reaching Quitman, :Miss., about twenty-six miles in a southerly direction from :.\1eridiau, field-work was closed May 12, in accordance with instructions. "Jir.

Hydrographic examination in the 1·ieinity of the Chandeleur Islands antl ltydrographio resuney of HvmI8land Pass.-Im;tructiomdssnml in Xovcmber, 1885, directed Lieut. John .M:. Hawley, U.S. N., .Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, to take command of the steamer Bache, antl prepare her for sen·ice on the Gulf coa8t. In December, in pursuance of detailed instructions from the Il,Yllrograpbic Iuspector, Lieutenant Hawley completed his arrangements and organized his party on board the Bache, aud after a stormy passage reached Key West January 19, liavi11g left Sew York .January 7, 188fi. Ile lPft Key \'Yest .Tannar;v 21, encountered strong northwesterly wiuds in the Gnlt~ and was obliged to put into Tampa Bay on two different occasions before lw could. continue on his course. Haying taken in coal at Mobile, the steamer arrived nt the nortbem end of the Cbaudeleur Islands February 5. Herc Lieutenant Hawley put up a tide-gauge near Chandeleur light, and having provided for the services of a tide-keeper, he continued on with the ship down the outside coast of the islands, a distance of twenty-five miles, to the localit.y of the work assigned to his party. On February 6 three parties were sent out to erect signals, ancl on the 8th souuding was begun, using two boats for the in-shore work and the ship for off-shore so111,1diugs. Four days sufficed to complete the soundings in this locality. Lieutenant Hawley found discrepancies between bis own survey and the former oue, not fully accounted for by the changes tbat had probably taken place during the forty ;years that had elapsed since the original surrny, and he reports that in order to obtain a satisfactory explanatiou it will be 11ecessary to begin a. triangulation from a base established at the light-house, redetermine all signals, replot the hydrograpl1y executed in tbe spring of 1885, and then complete all new bydrography required. Lieutenant Hawley has transmitted to the office a tracing showing the location of the signals established hy his party and the corrected shore-line. On the 11th of February the Bache proceeded to Horn Island Pass. Finding that a mere examination, such as was contemplated by hiR instructions, would not develop as ful!Y as was desirable

the facts wanted by local pilots and others interested iu the commerce of East l'ascagoula, Lieutenant Hawley madP a complete resun'ey of the Pass, from the anchorage inside of Horn Island to the sea buoy, de,·eloping a very crooked channel, through which can lJe carried at uwau low water a least cle;>th of nineteen feet. Over tl!e bar proper can now be carried twent~· and a l1al f feet, where the old survey showed but seventeen feet. A plane of reference for the soundings was established fron~ the meau of tbt' low waters, a,; determined by observations at a tide-gauge established on Horn Island. The signals nsed iu the resurvey were located h.\- occup~ing the seYeral light-houses, Horn Isla11d, Hound Island, and East Pascagoula. I . ieutenaut Hawley fouud tliat 1<ince the old snrYe~-, the point of Petit Bois Island bas grown to the westward about a mile and a half. lle observes that the people of East rascagonla expressed much gratification at the fact of his maki11g a complete survey of the channel, and seernet1 to feel that the future prosperity of theii· town depended upon the result.

An account of Lieutenant Hawle_y's hydrographic work to the north of Anclote Keys is given under the heading of Section VII. Sur·ve.lf of tlte coast of Louisiana between Barataria Ba.y and the Mcrmentnu River.-In order to cover that part of the coast of Louisiana lying between Barataria Bay and the l\ferrncntou Uin·r by a survey sufficiently detached to admit of the completion of tbe coast chart of that locality, Assistant F. \V. 1~erkins was placed in charge of that work iu Kovember, 1885, and authorized to adopt such methods as tlie peculiarities of the countQ·, together with a <lne i·egard to a reasonable degree of accuracy, might suggest. Mr. E. L. Taney was at the same time placed in charge of a sub1larty as topographer under the general direction of l\lr. l'erkius. The steamer Hitchcock was fitted out as a general headquarters and base of supplies awl to accommodate the main party. No suitable_ vessel for the use of the secondary party could lie found at short notice, but a small sloo1l was secured wbid1 was made to answer their purpose, though not without much inconvenience and discomfort. The work of the triangulation wa8 begun at the southwest pas:; of Vermilion Ba~· and carrieL1 westward to the limit of the work of 1884, within about eigllteen miles of the mouth of th<' )fermentou River, after whicb. the old astronomical station, Deer Island, at the mouth of the Akllafalaya River, was recm·ered, and the work WHS carried southem;t from there to Isle Dernierc, nud Ship Shoal Light. The topography, commenced b,Y a sun·e.r of tlrn southern aUtl eastcm portion of Marsh faland, was carried around Vermilio11 Bay over the country triangulated westward from the southwest pass of that bay, and closetl with a sl1n·e.r of the shores of Caillou Bay. West of Vermilion Bay the coast is a low marsh, drained by four or five bayous. A thin la.n·r of broken shells, a few meters wide aloug the Gulf shore, and the ridges of hard land known ns Chemin Tigre and Mulberry Island ncnr the coast, and Pecan Island in the back country, gfre a little variety to its general marshy character. Marsh Island, immediate!;\- to the eastward of Yermilion Bay, is a considerable body of ,·er~· low marsh which separates Cote Blanche from Y(·rmilion Bay, and bas a narrow strip of harcl land at its southern edge, heyond which sea-weed and a uctwork of shell reefs exteu<l for miles. Oaillou Ba.h extending- frotn Point au Fer to Isle Derniere, is a vcrs shallow hody of water. apparently without reefs or shoals, with shores formed by a succession of marsh islands, whicli separat,e it from a series of small bays, lakes, and bayous, uaYigable lly small crafts.

the geometrical re(Jltiremeuts, recourse was had, when the depth of water permitted, to water signals, placell back in the marsh, aud to tlags in the trees 011 the Pecaniere. lu t11e constructioll of water signals, <lifferent metlwds were tried by J.\Ir. Perkins, but lie fonml uoue so satisfactory as those devised b:.- himself for use on the Florida survey, coJJsisting of :t simple tripod, pr1:1parell on <leek, witll a tie-piece connecting the legs at the deptll to which it was intended to ha\·e them enter the mud, and weighted on each point with about two hundred and fifty or three hundred pounds of old grate-bars. The whole structure, when prepared, being launched from the deck, was ;;wayed down to its bearings by a boat's crew, stationed (JU cleats nailed to the legs near the water line, and the vole WtlS plumhed afterwards. These signalA stood well aml maintained their po:,;ition iu water eighteen or twenty feet deep. Ju placing signals back iu the man;!J greater difficulty was experiencetl. Very light tripods and poles were used, the legs running a couple of feet into the mud, and kept from sinking out of sight hy boards laid flat upon the surf;we and caught nuder transverse cleats spiked to the iegs. AU signal material had to be com-eyed oYerland on the backs of men, or pnslled in flat-bot-' torned boats up the bayous and across the lakes. The high grass and reeds and insecure footing on the floating turf in the former case, aml the shoal water and ooze, too soft to support the "·eight of a ma11, in the latter, made the labor much more senwe than men are ordinarily called to endure. To the eastward the m1sun-e5,ed portion of the coast is apparently quite different in cha1·Hcter, and it is hoped that it will present less serious difficulties. ' The s<:'ason was a Yer.r tryrng one, and the success attained is due to the untiring zeal of Mr. Perkins aud Hte officers associated with him,· l\fessrs. E. L. Taney, J.B. Baylor, and G. I·'.

Arri,-ing at Vermilion Bay early in February, he attempted to get into Cote Blanche Bay without success, au1l proceeding to Barataria Bay be began off-shore work, for the execution of which he was furnished with two projections, each on a scale of 1-40000, including the coast froru Southwt·st Pass to the lower part of Barataria Bay. · The off.shore work was suspended February 19, and another attempt made to enter Cote Blanche Bay. This was successfol and soundings were taken in t.he bay between March 18 and April 20, wheu the ofl"-shore work was resumed and continued till the close of the season, May 14. The h;ydrography of Cote Bhmclie Bay was executed on a scale of 1-20000. Lieutenant Crosby had great difficnlt;y iu getting hi1' \"ei;sel into the ba~., and he reports that it cannot be entered with safety b,r a n·ssel drawiug four feet of water, the entrance from the eastward being full of oyster and shell IJauks.

Rirnr. In West Bay, west of the l\Iississippi River, the water is much shoaler than appears b~ the last in-shore survey, and tlJe mud fiats and stranded drift-wood extend out a considerable distance from tlie shore-line. In going oYer the bar at t!Je entrance to Barataria Bay eight feet oi water were found at high water. For the off-shore work west of the ~Iississippi Hiver Delta, a box-gauge and also a staff-gauge were ereck<l north of Barataria Light-house-the box-gauge with a float and staff-pointer. For the work at Cote Blanche Btty a box-gauge with a rod and pointer secured to the float was erected on the wharf at Cote Blanche Plantation. A plane of reference was established by obseniug high and low waters for thirty-one consecutive days, and the mean of all the low waters was nsed. No current stations were occllpied during tlie seasou, but it was obserYed that in Cote Blanche Bay the currents were inilllenced by the winds aml were very irregGlar. They are also \'ery irregular to tlie westward of the Mississippi Delta, and cannot be depended upon. Near the shore a vessel will he set to the westward, farther out to the eastward 01· southeastward, and on going out farther she will again be set to the westward. Lieut. F. S.

On the 31st of August, this portion of the topography hav-ing been nearly completed, camp was moved from Laguna Oailon to San Jnan Capistrano, and work begnu soon after on a second plaue-table sheet. This locality south of Aliso Call.011 and tlle bold Niguel Ridge, nenrly one thousand feet in l'le\·ati()n, is quite remarkable from its being cut up by deep chasms, eroded by the occasional heavy, almost tropical, winter rains. These chasms, or barraucas as the~· are called, sometimes nrn lrnnk full iu winter, bnt are dry hells in snmmer. They are in many places a complete barrier to progress m·eu on foot, autl long detours are necessary to cross them. 'l'he contours in this locality were fouml to be extremely difficult to determine, mucll of the land being a high mesa or table laud, with ;inch a gradual slope inland as to make a liberal use of the level expedient. Iu executing this and other '\Vork of special. <lifficnlty, Mr. lfodgers had the assistance of Mr. Isaac \Vim;ton, Aid, in his part~·, of whose serdces be speaks in the highest terms. When notoccnpied in fielrl-work .'.llr. Winston computed the triangnlat.ion of the preYious season, and completed these comvutatious lJefore the party left tl1e ficltl.

Rf'mnnai.~sancefor tlte site <~fa prhna.ry base-line in Los Angeles "'County, Oal'(/ornia.-Under special iLstructions from Assistant George Davidson, in charge of work npfln the Pacific coa:st. Assistant James S. Lawson organized a party to co operate with AsRistant Dickins of Mr. Davi(tson's })arty, in au examination of I,os Angeles Plains, in order to obtain a site for a hase-liue to be used iusteau of the preliminary San Pedro Base, one of the terminal markings of which had been maliciously destroyed before 1881. In compliance with these instructions, Assistants Lawson and Dickins, accompanied by their Aids, l\It:ssrs. Morse arnl Welker, took the field in Ma;y, 1886, and ma<le a close exami11atio11 -of the coi:.ntry from Norwalk to Santa Ana Valley (north and i<outh); from Anaheim to LoR Cerritos (east and west), and as_far as Las Bolsas to the southwest. It was desired by 1\Ir. Davidson to obtain a base-line near tlle Southern Pacific Railroad between Los Angeles and Anaheim, so as to .form one side of a qmulrilateral towards Bol:sas and San Pedro, aml also one side of a quadrilateral towards Santa Anita and San Juan. Two Jines were found, one of thirteen thousand six hundred aud fift,y meters (8.48 statnte miles) in length, running parallel and close to the railroad; its north west end a short distance south of the village of Norwalk, and its southeast end about a mile from the railroad station at Anaheim; the other seventeen thousand tbree hundred and ten meters (10.76 statute miles) in length; its north end on a plateau a little ov1 r a mile east of the village of Norwalk, and its south end distant two and one-half miles from the Aualleim depot. Tllis line crosses the railrm1d at an angle of 190 in the immediate vicinity of Coyote Creek. Plane-table snr\·eys, with measurements, were made of both sites by 11fossrs. Lawson and Dickins, and the connections of each base with the triangulation are shown upon sketd1es accompanying the detailed report made by Assistant I.awson. The examinations were most thorough, and will furnish accurate data for a comparison of the relative merits of the two sites. Contin11ation of the triangulation and topograplty of tile south coast of California 1Jeilrcc11 Bstcro Point and Point S11r.-Reference was made in the last annual report to the completion of tlw tt:rtiary triangulation of the south coast of California from Moro Bay westward to the liue Irving-Estrada within three miles of the town of Cambria, San Luis Obispo Count~·, by the party in charge of Assist.ant Stehman Forney. Under instructions dated in June, 1885, :M:r. Forney resumed field-work early in Jn!~·, aml after completing his topographical sheet in the vicinity of .Moro Ha:f, which had been begun the previous sea!!lon, lie took ap the triangulation from the line Estrada-Irving, and connected it with the work executed by Assistant Rockwell at San Simeon Bay iu 1871-1872. This lfone, he left Cambria, October 11, 1885, with his party and pack-train to make a n'counaissance for the tertiary triangulation of the coast fron Piedras Blancas Light-house to J>oint Snr. Having finished this reconnaissance November l2, he proceeded under imtructions to San H.Ex.40-0

Francisco where he was enf§agcd until June, 1886, in working up his li<:hl-notes and making the needful computations. On the 12th of June, in pursuance of instrnctfons, he left San Francisco for the field, and at the close of the fiscal year was engaged in completing the topographical survey from Estrada station to the junction of his own triangtilation with that at San Simeon Day in 1871-1872. Some extracts from the elaborate report submitted by l\Ir. Forney will be of interest: '·The country between the shore-line and the Coast Itange of mountains, running parallel with the iilwre-line from San Carpojoro to J>oiut Sur is probably the ronghest piece of coast-line on the whole hteific coast of the United States from Sau Diego to Cape Flattery. "The Lighest peaks of the crest of the coast rnnge arc located at an average distance from the coast of three and one Jrnlf miles. In this di8tancc they rise to elevations of from three thousand six hundred to fiyc thonsmHl fet"t abo\e the sea-level. l''rom San Carpojoro to Pfeiffer's Point, a distance of :fift,v-fm.:r miles, tLe shore-line is an iron-bouud coast with uo possible chance of getting from the hills to the shore-li11e and back except at the mouths of the crreks and at such places as Coxe's Hol.e and Slate's Hot Springs, where there are short stretclles of sandy and rocky lwaches from iift~· to one lnrndred yards in leugth. In many places the sea blnff>:1 are perpendicular, and rise from one thousand to fifteen lrnrnlrHl feet. above the sea. The countr;> is cut up by de<'p cafions, walled in with liigh and precipitous bluffs. These canons are drnsely wooded with re<lwook, oak, and ~;ellow au<l siln·r pine timber. "The redwood tref's arc from three to six feet in diameter and from one hundred to one lnmch·ed and iiftr feet bigh. Tile oaks and pines are of the same arerage dimensions. Beautiful streams of clear cold water, filled with an abundance of sahnou·trout, are to be found in all tlrn cafious. The spurs running from the summits of the rauge to tLe ocean bluffs are co,ered with a dense growtL of brnsh and scattering clmups of oak and iiine timb0r. The chaparral is very thick, and in many places grows to a height of ten or iifteen feet. ''In making a topographical survl:'y through this country it will require a great deal of hrn>:h-cntti11g as well as some cutting of timber to clear !in.es for the triangulation. The spurs, slopt·s, and caiions are impenetrable, and trails will have to be cut through the chaparral in order to lcwatc plaue-table stations from which to sketch the topography." !!fr. Form·J- remarks tLat in bis opinion liberal sketching will be sufficiently accurate to show the general topographical featnres of the country, determining, of course, with accuracy the heights all(l <lircctions of tile spurs and cafions. His re110rt gh'eS many interesting details with regard to the settlements, laniliugs, and auchomges along the coast, and is accompanied by a sketch which shows that l1i.s work ha:s llcYeloped a direct connection of the chain of tertiary triangles extending from the liue Stone-Villa to the line l'oint Sur-Pico Blanco with the primary triangulation stations Cone Peak, Santa Lncin, Rocky Butte, and Piedras Blancas Light-house. Oce11pation '!l stations in contimwtion of the primary triangulat-ion of the coa~t of California, non'<i (:f Point Coneepcion.-In complirtnee with instructions to resume work in the primary triangulation of Califomia as 8oon as practic::ible after the beginning of the fiscal year Assistant .James S. Lawson organized Lis party for tbe occupation of Castle l\:Iountaiu early in September, 1885. The coudition of the atmosphere previous to tbat time was such as to malre it inadYi1mble to take the field, although all preparations for a start bad been completed. On reaching the foot of the mountain the part.v found, much to their disappointment, that, owing to the dry summer, all the water supply Lad disappeare!l from the site preYiously selected for the lower camp, and that it would be 1wcessary to select a new site a mile higher up. 'fo reacL this with wagons a road bad to be g-raded around a steep part of the hill. The outfit ha\·ing been remoYed as rapidly as possible to the HPW site, the trail to the summit was laid out, cleared, and graded for the pack-auimals. During this time the heat w:-is iutense, and the water being strongly impregnated with alkali much sickness resulted. At the earliest moment the instruments and outfit immediatelv needed at the station were tnken up the mountain aud the 1iters and observatory built. On October 6 obserYations were begun, ancl on the 31st were finished. The work at Castle Monutain consisted of observations for horizontal directions vertical augles, time, latitude, azimuth, and for ralnes of· the ocnlar micrometer of theodolite N~. 131 and micrometer of meridian instrument No. Hi. For azimnth, a Ursre Minoris was observed, direct and 1 eflectcd from mereur~·.

At the beginning of November, arrangements were made for transporting the party to Ilepsedarn Station. At the site selected on this mountain for the lower camp many difficulties and daugers were eucountered from the sudden rising of the waters in San Luis Creek and the oYerfiowing of its banks caused by sudden and hea,-y rainfalls. Continuous watching and ditching around the lower camp had to be maintained day and nigllt to tJrevent the ruin of instruments, equipage, and stores. Another eflect of these heavy rains was to render the soil in places so soft that the pack-mules woulcl sink knee-deep in the aclobe mud. Attempts were made on seYeral different days to reach the summit, and as often did the animals slip, lose their footing, and roll back to the bottom of the inclines with their packs. Fortunately no1ie were injured, and by watching every fa\'Orable opportunity the aseent was .finally made. The summit of the mountain is a rocky ledge, offering barely enough surface for the observatory, the foundation for which had to be obtained by great labor in rnoYing large rocks and building them around so as to get space needed. In one respect the party was fortunate, a fine spring of water having l>een cliscoYcre<l nt'ar tlle upper camp, some three lmndrecl feet below the sLHnmit. )Ir. Lawson remarks that tllis i8 the first time he has obtained water at any of his primary stations without packing it from two to four milt>s. The observations at Hepscdam were similar in character to those at Castle .Mountain. At each station a sweep of the horizon was ma.de on all surrounding peaks and prominent objects. Field operations begun at Hepseclam December 12, 188:>, were closed lauuary .1, 1886. During the season Assistant Davidson's party occupied the primary sbitions, Santa Lucia and 'Santa Afia, connecting with Ca.stle Mountain aml HepsPdam, and in se,·eral instances there were stations on which l>otlt parties observed. At these one heliotroper attended both instruments. Assistant Lawson acknowledges in terms of high praise the Yalne of the serYices of :\fr. P. A. Welker, aid in the party. Mr. Welker took i;ome fine instantaneous Yiews iu the Yieinity of Bep· se<lam station, copies of which l\lr. Lawson has forwarded with his report. The statistics of the season are:

He has also received and transmitted all of the official corresponde111:e between the Superintendent and the officers of the Survey on that coast. Mr. Davidson has submitted a comprehensive report of the nirious operations in which he was personally engaged, or which were carried on under his direction during the fi:scal year. These are reforred to under the several headings which follow.

1lla'in triangulation and astronomica,l work.-The connection between the work of 1851-1852 depcmling upon the preliminary Pulgas Base, aud that of later years, depending upon the Yolo Base, was finished by l\Ir. Fremont Morse, Aid iu Mr. Davidsou'8 party, in July, 1885, with quite satisfactory results. It was found tlmt the triangulation point Table Mount, determined between 1852-1859, differed four feet in latitu<le from tLe station Tamalpais of 1876-1882, when in fact both are identical. Mr. Davidson specially traced the history of tllis discrepancy, and having personally revisited the locality satisfied himself tJiat the two stations were identical, aud that tllP> observations at each were wholly trustworthy. He nccounts for the change by the effects of an earthquake. On the 21st of Octoher, 1868, occurred the severest earthquake recorded on that part of the Pacific coast; it had its center near Uaywards, south of Oakland, and its effects of dislocation were felt man~· miles more distant than 1\fouut Tamalpais. On July 15, 188;"), AssiRtant E. F. Dickins joined .Mr. Davidson's party, and begau preparationsfor resuming the field.work of tl1e main tri:mgulation in Southern California. Tbe party remainl:'tl in the field till after the middle of December, having occupied two important stations, Santa Lucia, of about six thousand one hundred feet elcvatiou, and Santa Afia, about three thousand se\·en lrnndred feet. The former is very difficult of access. At each station, direction instrument No. 115, diameter of circle tweuty inches, was mounted on cement piers with the Da\·idRon position circle. Assistant Dickins made the ohservatioas for horizontal directions, vertical angles, and azimuth; .Mr. Morse rnatle the transit observations for time, and the zenith telescope obser·rntion~ for latitude, each officer alternately recording for the other. Jn this triangulation Mr. DaYidson's party worked in such concert with that of l\Ir. Lawson, wLose operations have already been referred to, that at each station occupied, one Leliotroper served for signals to both. After the party left the field the usual office work was accomplislled, tile records Leiug llnpli.catet1, and all abstracts and computations matle.

Eeeonrw.issancej01· the sight of a primary ba.se-linc.-I:,eference has been made in detail umler a preYious heading in this section to the examinations carried on by Assistants Lawson and Dicldrno; ou the Lo;; .Angeles plains, haying for their objt>ct the st>lection of a sitP for a ha;;e-line to be ni,:pd instead of the old preliminary San Pedro Base. Of the two sitt>s selected for consideratio11, J\Ir. DaYids011, under whose gt>neral direction 1he work was done, giYes the preference at present to a line of ten and seq'nty-six lrnudredtlis miles in length, cro:;siug tlie Sontbern Pacific lfailroad at a slight angle. Ile obfierves that the country is yet <>pen, and as the improvements are not Yalnable it is extremely desiraLk· to lla>e the measurement maue as soon as practicable. Exam'ination of stationR in the -~clierne of triau,qulMion, ricinity <!f 8an Dic,qo.-Assistanb Lawsou and Dickins and Aids Morse ai1d "''elker made an examination of some of tlle 11roposed stations in the Rcheme of triangulation from San Diego arnl Yicinity northward, and the 'lrnrk was being pm;hed with Yigor when telegr:iphic orders were l't'Cein'1l from tLe Sn11C'rintendent for its suspension. The party left the field and returned to tl1e >1.nbofiieP at the end of June. Obsenations of the annitlar eelip.Yc of the sun, JJ!arch 5, 1886.-The annular eclipse of the sun of March 5, 1886, was obsen·ed at the Coast and Geodetic Suney Station, Lafayette Park, San Fran· cisco, by Assistants DaYiclrnn and Law1rnn and Aids Morse, Welker, and Bill. Mr. Davidson observed '1ith his equatorial of six and one-fourth inches apertm·e; tlie obser. Yations by 11is colleagues were maue with reconnoitering te~esco1ws lrnYiug :<rnall aperture,: and low powers. A tabulated statement of the observations will be fournl in Appe111lix: No. 6. · fflagnetic observations.-To keep up the serit>s of magnetic obserrnti,1ns for the i11npose of determining the time and amount of the maximum dt>cliuati.on on the Pacific coast Mr. l\lo!'se was directed to make a regular set of observations for declination, dip, and llorizontal iuten>'ity at the Presidio Statfou, San Franciscff Peninsula. Th el'e observations were made in Angui>t, lSS;"i, nnd again in April, 1886. Reference will be found under the beading of S<·ction XI to i,:irnilnl' ohi;erYations made at stations on the Columbia Riwr. During.August, Mr. )forse reduced the magnetic obser>ations which had been made h~- :\I1·. Davidson at El Paso, Tex., and at Tacubaya Observatod in tlie City of Mexico in 188!. Tl1ei-e obsen·ations were found of essential value in the discussion of the secular change in thr large series of primary stations. Goa.st Pilot work.-V\'heneYer the pressure of regular official tlutie;; permitted, Mr. Da\"id>:on continued the collection of data and material for the Coast Pilot. Iu Lis Yisits to the North Farallones and to Point Reyes he mad~ views and took photographs of these rocky islets. In Octol>er he made a trit> as far north as Puget Sound for this special duty, and got Yiews and photographs of headlands, &c. Again, in May, on his way to observe in Oregon aud Washington Territory, lie got other views and photographs. Before he left on this trip tbe mam1io;cript of the Coast Pilot had been completed as far up the coast as Port Orford. )Ir. Fenlinand \Yestdahl, in the interrnls of bis regular duty, worked upon a series of views of headlandR which he liad takf'n an<l madP a fair copy of the Coast Pilot manuscript. J:i'or tlle examination of the North Fa:allones, special autliority was obtained by the Superin-. tendent from the Secretary of the Treasury, directing the commandPr of the reYenue cutter Rit·har<l Rush to assist Mr. Davidson in this special duty. From four points on the islands which had been determined in 1859, each position occupied b~· the vessel was established, while soundings, view,-:, and photographs were being taken and heights measuretl. The soundings showed· deq1 water around these islets, and a twenty.four.fathom passage between the northwestern islet and the mass grouped to the southeast. The islets are barren rocks, reaching one hundred and fift;y-sernn feet in elevation; too steep to be the home of the sea-lion, but cow·retl by m.rria<ls of birds. In a special report of this examination, bearing date of May;{, 1886, l\Ir. Davidson makes a recommend· ation for a fog.signal on the northernmost of the North Farallones. He aeknowle<lges the cordial assistance of Captain Hooper of the revenue cutter in the work at the l<'arallones aud also in tlie special ~xamination made by Mr. Westdahl of Noouda\· Uock.

The. rock which was disco'°ered when the first Noonday Rock was blown awa;y he fouuu again, but observed that the buoy was in a wrong position, aud that vessels coming from tlie northwest would be pla.ced in imminent danger if they made the buo~· first. Further examinations will be made. In October, 1885, upon his return from a tour of inspectiirn, reference to which will be made under the heading of' Section XI, Mr. Davidson made to the Snperinteudcut suggestions for Aids to Navigation, aml in January supplied more recent information about the location of the LiglJthouse on Point Sur. Suboffice at San Franci11co.-~1r. DaYidson continued in charge of the suboffice at Sau Francisco, atten<led to all the duties, and answered all calls for information. \Yith tlie assistance of )Jessrs . .Morse and Hill he computed a second table of the azimuth nnd apparent altituJ.t· of Polari,; at different hour angles, aud for a large range of latitude, for use in field-work. Outside of his official dntie;; he 1rns engaged upon the introduction of azimuth an<l transit ;;tars for his Field Catalogue (Appendix Xo.18, report for 1883), so as to enlarge it for a fntnre edition. Ile prepared also and nearly completed au extended paper upon the vo.rages of UJloa, Cahrillo, Ferrelo. Drake, ancl Vizcaino upon the coast of California, desiring to locate their positions as far as practic.able by stl\dying tlieir descriptions and taking tllem from his personal acquaintauce witli the coast. This papt->r will appear as Appendix No. 12 to this volume. The obsern1tory at Lafa~·ette Park was usecl hy the Assistants, Suha.ssistants, and Aids for Jlractice and for tlrn determiuatiou of the constants of field instruments. Duriug the greater part of the year Assistant E. F. Dickins was attached to Mr. Davirlson's 11arty,and had direction of the details of the work when in the field. He executed all work with :_.,atisfaction, both as to character and quautity. Mr. Fremont Morse, Aid, contiuned in his party throughout the year1 was iu the field with :\Ir.

Ferdinand ':Vestclalll performed duty as draughtsman in the suboffice, and, as alread.r Coast Pilot and inspection duty. Mr. Cilarles B. Hill Rtatecl, accompanied J\lr. Darklson attemled to his duties as clerk,. made transit observations for time to determine the oerror of chrouometet· for the Saucelito Ti<lnl station, and filled all calls outside of official hours. Vicente Denis served as janitor, messenger, and porter, had the care of the instruments and camp equipage in the snhoffice, and worked faithfully without regard to llours. Examination of weights and balances at the U1iited States Jllint.-By special authority from the Superiutentleut, aud at the reqnest of the Director of tlie :Mint, Assistant Davidson made a i)erso1rnl examination of aU the coin and bullion weights and balances of the United 8tates .Mint at San Fraucisco. This uork was done mostly after official hours, and involved a long series cf minute obserrntious and checks. The reduction of the observations and the tabulation of the results was doue wlioll,r outside of official hours, and necessarily involved considerable time, but it was esseutialf~· co111pleted l\Iarch 30, 188G, at which elate it was transmitted, through the Superintendent, to tLe Director of the Mint. Under snbseqnent headings in this and tile next section reference will be macle to other duty assigued to Mr. Davidson or operations in liis charge during the fiscal year. Shore-line re15urvey of Carquinez Straits and San Pablo Ba:y-Resurvey of the shore-line topography of the Golden Gate and approac71es.-A revision of the shore-line of Cm·quinez Straits and Sau Pablo I.lay l.uwing become desiralilt~ owing to the cllanges that had occurred since the E\Urvey of 1855, Assistant A.

A tidal obsen·er was left at ·westport, Memlocino County, witL. instrnctiom; to keep np tidal observations witL. the same gauge that had been used during the spring i;;easou. On aeconu t of t lie exposed cbaracter of- 1he coast, it was not }lracticable to put np a tide-staff nearer the wo1:.king gronntl except at great antl unwarranted expense. As a prt·cautiouary measure, Lieutenant 'Iam;sig landed an extra box, float, and staff, which proved to be of use in the latter part of the sea"'ou, the first one having been carried away by a heavy swell. On the 10th of XoYemher tl.ie :>t·eo111l one was ahm carried away during one of the heaviest anti most <bmagiug gales ever kuown ou that coast. The earlier partof the season was dernted to defining the e:s.te11t of tl1-e shoal aml banks i11 tlw vicinity of 'Vbite Rock station and Shelter Cove, and the hydrography was colllplete(l to a poi ut oft' Horse Mountain statio11.

Completion of the connection of tlie Koos Bay and Umpquah River triangulations-Progress of the topoyrapltic m1<l hydrographic survey of the Fmpquah River.-In the last annual report an account was giveu of the operations of the party iu charge of .Assistant Louis A. SengteUer on the coast of Oregou, between Koos Bay and Umpquah Hiver. l\lr. Sengteller had been in the field since May 3, and between that period aud the _close of Ilic fiscal year bad carried the coast triangulation 11orth arnl south of the Umpquab, ball determinetl all the points needed for the topography and h~·drograpby of that river, and had developed the reconnaissance on the coast to a junction with the Ji11P. Pony-Simpson of the Koos Bay triangulation. He was prPparetl therefore, on Jnly 1, 1885, to begin observations of horizontal angles, and di1l !:o by occupying Simpson station. Some delay wa~. however, caused at the outset by the prenilence of a ,-iolent northerly gale, lasting for two days, during which tbree of his stations were destroyed, and ohser,·ations upon tllem~ wl1ich bad been partly completed, were lost.

He was directed to gh·e special 11ttention to sonuding in the iudentation at False Tillamook, with a YiPw of making a car<>· fol examiuatiou, should it afford au anchorage. At. the time that Lieute11a11t-Commander t5now was in the vicinity, late in August, he repOI"tS that although the sea was smoother tltan mmal, and the ship was taken quite close in, t!Jpre seemed to be no protection from tile swell ~hich was then setting from northwest. A boat'g party sent to look for Falcon statioa, on the high bluff marking the hight, returned reporting that no place could be found to effeet a lauding. The pUot wli(} accompaniPd tbe steamer from the Columbia RiYer stated tliat the indentation at False Tillamook afforded little or no protection as an anchorage, aud that he knew of no case when it had been used as such by coasting vessels. Lieuteuant-Commancler Snow was informed that with a wind from the northward, or from northward and eastward, the sea is ,·err smooth along the coast from False Tillamook to Cape Meares, and that this was also the case du1ing the brisk northw<'st summer winds (close in to the coast) when the sea has a more soutberly dir<'ction. He states, boweYer, that he was not so fortunate as to find any winds from these directions except for such short pcliods that no climinutioD of the prevailing westerly swell was caused tl1erehy. ll.

On the afternoon of Augnst 30, the Hassler entered Tillamook Bay to take up a rf'surYcJ· uf that harbor, sbouhl it appear from the examinations to be made that a resurvey would be needed. On enteriug, about an hour before high water, eighteeu feet was the least water got on the bar. Parties were sent out ou the following day to put up signals, aud a tide-gauge was established at tlJe wharf of the canuery, a bench-mark being marked ou a rock on the beach a few lnrndred yards away. Tidal obser\""ations were immediately beguu and continue(} day and night for a lunar month, and daily observations afterwards until the conclusion of the work outside. I,ieutenant-Commancler Snow ~tates as a general result of such soundings as he was able to tjlJtain i11 tlie bay and on the bar that there is need of' a resun·ey,. and that had his in.structions warranted taking the risk of a long detentio11 he shonld have remained to gfre a more careful Xamination to the navig;tble cllrimwls inside. But from the da,y of his entering the bay until the Sth of September the smoke was so dense that no work could he done except on tlnee days dnriug clearing intenals. On the 8th of September tlie rains comlllenced aml continued with dense· fogs until the 17th, tlie bar meanwhile breaking too beavily to permit any work or to take the iship out1>ille. On that day, a fa\·orab1e opportunity hadng offered for crossing the bar, and the danger of lleing llar-bonml inside increasing, owing to the lateuess of tlie season, tlJC Hassler was takeu outside to prosecute the off.shore work. Lientenai1t-Comma11der Snow gins iu his report fnll detail;; in regard to tlie hydrographic char· acteristics of Tillamook Bay, and observes that in view of the changes which have taken place iu tlie bay a!l(l on the bar, and to meet the wants of the rapiul,y-growiug- country around, he recomrnemls a complete l'Cslll'vey to he made of it, but that this sl10nltl not be undertaken after the 111011th of August. That from his own experience on the coast of Oregon, aud from what he could learu from those familiar with it, he \Vas convinced tlrnt auy i>urveyiug work tlJere can best, be doue from :May tu September. The gre<ttest obstacle to he encountered at that season is the smoke from forest fires. The seasons >ary greatl~·,-however, in this respect; in the snmme1· of ISS± there was no smokt>, and in the summer of 1885 tlwre were very few clear days, hut it is only at tliis seai;;m1 of tltf year that the sea is smooth enough for boat-work. 'Vork off the coast was begun with the ship September 17, and, in accordaiwc with instructions, the lines were rnn about one and a half miles apart, altematc lines, to a distance of twekc miles frow the shore, the shorter lines extending only to a distance of eight or uine miles. :Puriu~ tlie continuance of this work much bad weather was exp<:rienced, aud it was fotrn<l necessary to run iuto Columbia Hiver several times to a \·oid southeasters which, accompanied by rain aIHl fog, lasted .several tla,rs. There was also a very hea\·y westerly swell on the days when work was 11ossible, prewutiug as near an approach to the coast as was desirable. IIeavJ· breakers, especially in the vicinity of the .Xehalem River and Tillamook Da,\·, rendered auy boat-work impossible; there was~ in fact, no time <luring the season when sounding by boats would have been prudent. The coa~t fro111 False Tillamook to Cape l\Ieares is apparently free from any hidden dangers. T!Je off-shore li1ws, beginning in fifteen fathoms of water about one awl a quarter miles from tlw shore, deepened Yer.'· regularly until a depth of i;event;r fathoms was rea-0hcd, twelve miles oft", the curves of equal <lepth runuing nearly parallel with the trend of the coast. The currents wer·e Ccentric, probabl,\· because of the cllaugiug se''lson, it being a well-known fact along this coast that witlt the prevailing northwest wiwls iu summer there is a strong set to southward, while in winter the set ill more frequently to northward. After southeast or southwest winds, which lrnd 1in~n1iletl sernral da_ys, the northerly set was YeQ' noticeable. A snr,·ey of Neualem Hi1·er llar, which had been coutemplated as part of the seasou 7s work (though of minor importance), was found to be impracticable, heavy breakers extending quite across the entrance and to a long tnl>tance from the shore. Nor could any defiuite information be obtained concerning it, the statements made of the depth that could be carried across the bar n1ryi11g so greatly as to be of no value. A request ha dug beeu received from the Light·Bouse Board for surveys to ascertain changes iu climmels in certain parts of tile Columbia River, Lient.enant-Commaudei· Snow was directed to eonfer as to the details of these SlllTeytoJ with Capt. Charles F. Powell, U. S. Engineers, 011 duty as engineer of the TlJirteentll Light-Hottse District, and on October 13 the Ilasgler was moved up tlle river to \Valker's I .;;land, where a tide-gauge mts establishetl and connected with a bench·

mark at Rainier. Soundings were begun on October 15, using two steam launches, the lines of soundings being run normal to and parallel with the banks of the rh-er and at a distance apart of three hundred feet. Lienteuaut-Commander Snow remarks that the channel now used by ships of deep draught passes close to the Oreg-on suore near Riuearson station, and is a <lifficult one because of its uaruowness and a sharp turn at this point. The channel i:; apparently changing so as to make a straighter course possiLle near the center of the ri>er, still passing· to soutlnvard of ·walker's Islaud. But for a short distance this channel is ;mt impracticable at higlI water for n·.ssels drawing se,·enteen feet, and eveu for thm-e of lesser draugllt it slwuld l.Je well IJouyed. A pilot can always be got at Astoria, a11<l no n·sse1 should attempt to pass up or dmn1 ti.le ri,·er "ithout oue, as the channel iu many parts of the river undergoes a radical change after the ;rearly fresbeti;, and after such changes the pilots are accustomed to somHl out and IJuoy the new chmmel. Lieutenant-Commamler Snow recomme11ds the adoption and issue of '' Llue prints" as a s11eedy process of makiug pnblic the results of uew surveys. 'l'bc surve,y of tl.lis part of the river was· co11chde<l October 20, au<l the Bassler was theu moved dowu to Astoria for au examination of Aurora channel. For this work tides were obsen·ed on l\1r. 1''ilson's gauge at Astoria, a plane of reference baYing been determined there by a series of obserYatious which had been contiuned several years. Sournliug liues were run as at 1'.,.alker's Island, three hundrEd feet apart, par11llel to each otlier and normal to the direction of the channel. This work wa:; much eml.Jarrassed by l.iea.-y rains, but the channel proper was well developed by October 3l, when the survey was closed. "\Vith approval of the Superintendent, tracings were fnrnislied to the Inspector and Engineer of the Thirteenth J,ight-House Distric: which will sufficiently indicate what chauges iu l.Jnoys are required. _ On November 3, 1885, the Hassler left the Columbia HinT for Sau Franeisco, arriYing at tile latter port No>ember 8, after a >ery stormy passage.

Under ordinary circumstances he would have beguu hydrographic work in the Columbia River near Columbia City, at the limits to which he bad previously brought it, bnt knowing that the rh·er would soon be too high and the current too rapid for sounding, and in order to SMe transportation, he commenced the work in the Willamette Hh·er near the foot of Ross Island at the upper limits of the city of Portland. In order to obtain a plane of reference for the reduction of soundings his first step was to set np tide-gauges at Vancouver, the mouth of the vVillamette, at Saint John's, and at Albina. Several years ago a tidal station was occupied at Vancouver, and the readings of the gauges at the several points were all referred to the Vancouver bench and gauge. Simultaneous observations at each of these stations were made for twenty-four consecuth'e hours; and as the rfrer was very nearly at a stand, and the fluctuations of level were quite small, this was thought to be sufficient.

Obxeri~rttfonR for latitude and azimuth, and for ma.qnetic declination <tnrl lw»izontal intensity, at stntions in Oregon and Washi11uton Territt>ry.-Duriug parts of May and June, 1886, Assistant George Davidison occupied the sceon<lary triangulation station Balch, near Portland, Ore.g., to determiue its latitude and the azimuth of a counecting line of the triangulation. Assistant Cleveland Uockwell 'vas assigned to duty in his party. Balch is about ifre hundred feet above the Columbia River, on the lateral spur of a higher ridge, and is reached by a nry steep and rough trail, two hundred aud tif't,r·five feet above the

Da\'idsou proceeded to l'uget Sound, aud began an examination of the Sound at Olympia, Wash. At Tacoma he obtained a sketch of Mount Rainier; at Seattle sketches of the same m-0m1tain and of th~ great range of Olympus. He remarks that in tlle intricacies of the interior navigatiou, tLrough the waters east of Whidbey Island, views are not of much worth, because some of the chauucls are very tortuous, and onlr local knowledge is of use until they are surveyed aud buoyed. All through these waters vessels nre often compellt'd to navigate in foggy and smok~- weather by 1.be ecllo of their whistles from the shores, and dnring tile last summer the smoke was for some time so dense that some of the boats were laid up. lletwet>n J>ort Townsend and Yictoiia, and thence to Cape Flatter~-, some views were 0Utai11ed.

Un account of dense smoke it was possible to obserYe on short lines olllJ; the triai1guL1tio11 of Burrows Bay was therefore completed before it was clear enough to connect it with t lie nwi11 work. A storm on the 8th of September liaving cleared tl1c atmosphere, no time was loi't i11 rn11· J1ectiug the triangulation, and that done the topog-raphy "as takp11 np. The shores ou t lie topograpliical sheet are mostlJ' rocky perpendicular cl'ffs, aml tlte work of delineating them was slow and arduous. By October 26 one topographical i;heet m1s finished, and the rainy season ha Ying ai'rived, field operations were soon after SUfllended for the winter. While engaged in finishing his office-work, l\Ir. Gilbert recei\·ed, iu February, 1886, instrtl('· tions for special astronomical work at 01,ympia and at Seattle. At OJ~-mpia h<:' put np au obi<Pl'Yatory suitable for observations of latitude aud azimuth, and connected the observing station with the triangulation of Budd's Inlet.

Il!fdrographic sur1Jcy.~ in Southeastern Alaska.-.c\.t the opening of the tiscal rear, the party of Lieut. Hichanhon Clowr, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steam~ Pattcnsou, had been eugagetl for about a month iu work preparatory to a sun·e.r of Clarence Strait, itf' approaches, and the waters com1ectiug with it iu Southeastern Alaska. A base had been measnr<>ll, a reconnaissance and triangulation completed, astronomical aud magnetic observations made, and so1111dings lwgnn. A11 account of this \l'ork up to July 1, 1885, was giYen in tbe last annual report. Li1·ute11ant Clo\·pr has submitted a full report of his surYey, accompanied by a sketch sliowing itR limits. Sorne extracts from this report will be of iuterest. Hefeniug to the signals used in the triaugulatiou as beiug of heavy scantling, two and a half b~· three and a half inches, he -0b1Serves: "Evt>n tl1e heaviest signals will uot witbstaud the fierce willy-waws that, frequently sweep .around these 1Shores. It is a common sight to see avenues in the forests which have been swept out by these willy-waws. I shoultl recommeml the use of the lightest scanlliug, and that large signal!'\ he built in p~Tamid form and covered entirely with wbite sheeting. 'Whitewash does not .co,·er sufficient surface :rnd will not stand the frequent rains, for it is not likely to get a chance to hardeu before·it is rained on. Twenty ~·ards of sheeting at a cost of one dollar to each triangulation signal would iu the long run be great economy." And with i·eganl to the nature of the work, the rneaus aYailab]e for executing it, tile people, ~limate, &c.: ''The h;ydrographic diaracteristics of the country are tleep water and isolated rockl-l, which 1·ise up in unexpect<>d localities. The a\·erage depth of the main channels exceeds two hundred. fathoms, and to Lian· ~ouuded out the whole fiel<l uy the old 8JStPm of heaYy lead and line would lla n:i been very laborious, and would of itself ha Ye coni;umPd about all the time of the party for the season. Before leaving San Francisco 1 liad made composition hand-reels and stands for sounding witll piano wire, to lie used iu tlie launches. The counting registers were made on l>oard by Passe,! Assistant Eugiueer H.K. Stevenlion, lI. S. N.

Thus tlie launches were much better suited for the deep sounding than a large vessel would be, particularly as by immediately reversing the engine they can be brought to a dead stand in only their length wl1ile moving at full speed, anc:J need no time to regain headway. I·'or ordinary wo1 k I found a senn-pound hand lead sufficiently heavy. "The topogravhical features of tl1e country are exceedingly monotonous. While much has ileen said of the commercial value of Hie timber, I fonnd as a rule that the trees in the immediate section grew to a great size, usually from forty to sixtJ· feet, and close together. There is but little depth to the soil covering the rocks of the rnouutains, anq consequently tlle tl'(.'S immediately show want of nourishment in a dry spell. Their roots have so little bold that freqneutly willy-waws t:iWeep out whole awuues in the forest. The yellow cedar wns found, hut ne,·er in sufficient quan· titics to make any particular locality valuable. They are also said to be usually rotten at the core, so they do not cut up well.

Ju order to expedite the work, Mr. Mosman had planned to occup;r two stations about the same time; hence at some stations two heliotropers were necessary. ·while he was preparing Gould station he sent Mr. W. B. Fairfield, extra observer, to Yisit the stations to be obserYed upou, adjust the signals, and 1Jost the heliotropers when needed. Camp was ready at Gould July 15, and observations "l"l"ere begm1 July rn. On ,July 29 l\lr. Fairfield occupied station Fradd, about ten miles northeal't of the town of houtou, Lawreuce County. Obsen·ations at this station were finished August 14, aud at station Gould all obser>ations of horizontal directions had been completed by A u1,'11st 5. This being an astronomical station also, determinations of time, latitude, and azimuth were begun as Roon as tl1e necessar,y instruments could be receh·ed from the office, but owing to eYents there w.Uich led to delay, aud 011 account of nufavorable weather, obserYatious for time could not be obtained till Augui,;t 23. Very rai11y and cloucly weather prevailed till September 11, but h~· tl1e 18th of that mouth tl1e wol'k at Gould was finished. Between August 26 ancl September 8, two stations, Cave and Howlaud, were occupied in Kentucky, both in Greenup County. A signal had previously been erected at Round Top, a couspicuous hill of some se,·en hundred and fifty feet eleYation, callt:'d by t.Ue riwr pilots tlle lliglwi<t point on the river between PittsburglJ aud New Orleans. On 8eptember 19, observations having been completed at all Rtations that could be occupietl before extending the recon11aissance, the astronomical instruments were forwarded to the office aml arrangements macle for storing the camp equipage at l<'ranldin Furnace. This done, all hands were discharged except the driYer, and Messrs. Mosman and Fairfield began a reconnaissance for t!Je extension of the triangulation westward from the line Scioto (Ohio)-RouIHl Top (Kentuck~-). )Jr. l\Iosman observes that this country is a Yery difficult one for obtaining loug l i11es of sight, being formed of ranges of steep hills, all den-sely wooded an<l all of about the same elrrntion. The stations Scioto, Round Top, Twin Creek, and Peach Monnt, Ohio, and Cherry Ifa1g(', Kentucky, were Yisited, and by October 4 the line Scioto-Peach Mount had bt?en cleared of tirn her, so that a signal fift_y feet !Jigh ~tt Peach Monnt woulrl render this line intervisibl<:>, a tripod on<' 11 nndred feet in height ha Ying been erected at Scioto. To obtaiu this line of eighteen miles in lengt!J, lim·s were opened through hea,~y timber a mile and a half long and crossing o\·er the tops of five ridgr~. During the progress of this work .Hr. K K 'l'orre~·, foreman in the part;)', had erected au obser\""ing tripod and scaffold eighty feet high at Twin Creek, which was finislled October 10. Tl1e line from Scioto to Twin Creek was then opened and pre1mrations made for the simultaneous occupation of Scioto and Round Top, Mr. .Mosman and Lis foreman being at Scioto au<l Mr. I<'airfield and a recorder at Round 'l'op. T11e first-namecl statiou is three miles northwest of I'ortsmoutl1, Ohio, the second about fi>e miles eastwartlly of Vanceburg, Lewis County, Kentucky. Between October 21 and No>ember 30, observati011s a.t these two stations were finished, ancl on December 1 a station was occupied at Spring,·ille, Greenup County, Kentucky, iu t!Je extreme uortbeastern corner of the State. At this station, as ·at Scioto and at others occupied during the season, observations were made on spires of churches, court-houses, and other public lJuildingr; wheneYer practicable, to fix them in geographical position. At the request of the County Commissioners a meridian line was laid off in the grounds of the Children's Home, at Portsmouth~ Ohio. On December 4 the part.y started down the Ohio River to Ripley, Ilrown ConntJ-, to extend . the reconnaissance westward from the line Cherry Ridge (Kentucky) to Peach Mount (Ohio) ·. Very cold and thick weather set iu at this time; still one very good figure was obta.!ned, reaching about twenty-two miles westward in Ohio and Kentucky to a line Ashrillge-;-"Mine'rrn.

Stations Schultz, Cook, Brown, Buck Hill, and Gibson were suitably marked anti <le!"cribed. All of the records of the field-work, including the morning and C\"euing readiugs of the nneroi(l barometer, 'l'hich were kept up as heretofore at each station, have been sent to the office. The total number of angular measurements was twel>e hundred and fifty-six . .B:J:te1ision to the eastward hi the State of Indiana of the transcontinental triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel.-Instructions issued to Assistant George A. Fairfield in June, 1885, <lirected him to resume '1ork on the transcontinental triangulation in Indiana as soon after the 1st Df July as i1racticable. By supplementary instructions, issued early in August, he was dirf'ctecl to connect the astronomical station at Vincennes '1ith the primary triangulation. Preliminar~' arrangements were begun by Mr. Fairfield July 1. At that date he dispatched hit:i foreman to prit up the necessary signals, and on the 6th of the month left for ·w ashington, to obtain instruments, preparatory to occupying Summit station, about nine miles 11orthwest of Viuccunes. All preparationR were made at the station, but delay occurred in beginning the work, owing to imperfections in 1l1e theodolite, whicb could not be remedied except by returning it. to the office. l~nnts there quite unforeseen in their nature led to further <lday, so that it was 11ot till the 8th of August that the instrument was H'Ceived in good order. In the mean time Assistant ,T. n. ·weir, who was attached to the llart;y, bad made a H'tonuaissance for the purpose of counecting the Court-House at Vincennes, to which the astronomical statiou had been referred, with the main triangulation. This work was found to be quite difficult, owing to tlrn rolling character of the country and the height of the trees on all of the elevations. Obserrntionlil were begun at Summit station August 11, large tripod and scaffold isignals haYiug been erected by the foreman at two of the stations to be observed upon. As during several previous seasons, -the obserYations for horizontal directions were made at nigllt, by using at the scYcral stations stu<lcut-laruvs fitted with reflectors, so as to be effecth·e for night signals. The ouly exception was at Claremont station, in Illinois, thirty.four miles west of Summit. I<'rom ClHrcmont it was fouud uecessar~· to have a magnesium light shown, the student-lamp reflector not bPing bright enough. On the 6th of Septeruller all of the ollservations at Summit station were.completed; the obserrntions at the "Court House" and at "·wolf Hill'' for connecting the astronomical station at Yinct·m1£>s with the triangulation had been made, ancl on the 12th of the month camp was pitched at l\lcrom, Sullinrn County. 'l'hc point to be occupi<~d at Merom was in the cupola of the college building in that town, ma] mm.:h work had to be done before the theodolite could be mounted there. Observations at 1\Ierom were finished October 2, and tlle part.)· wa.s then transferred to station Sisson, which is on the road from Carlisle, Sullirnn County, to Pleasantville, about seven miles from the former place and two

Mr. Fairfield acknowledges tlle inte~est shown lly all the members of bis party in bringing the work to a successful close, and refers e8pecially to thl' n1lne of the services rendered by Mr. "\Veir. During the ~inter, Mr. Fairfield was occupied at the office iu completing the records and results of his field operations. Upon finishing that work, he was first assigned to regular duty in the office and then transferred to the imrt.r of Assistant Henry Mitchell. Geodetic operations-Continuation of the reconnaissance and triangulation of the State of Indiana.-Reference was made in the last annual report to the resumption of geodetic operations in the State of Indiana by Prof. J. L. Campbell, Acting .Assistant, at the opening or the season in 1885. Twenty days in the month of .June in that year were occupied in tile location of station 0 and M (one of the stations of the tbird quadrilateral north of tlle Ollio H.iwr) a111l in the construction of a tripod and tower at that station. During July, August, and part of t::leptember four stations were occupied for the extension of the triangulation, namely: Six :Mile, Hap;tack, Lutz, aud 0 an<l l\I. At the two latter stations observing tripods aud Rcatfolds forty and forty-ii YC feet in height were required; at tho two forlller the observations were made from the grounil. Stations Six l\lile allll Ilaystack, and also the advanced stations Bartle and Summit of the last quadrilateral of the recounaissance, arc on spun; of" The Knobs,'' while stations Lutz and 0 and .M, witb a new advanced station (x), not yet full.}' determined, are 011 tire divi(ling ridge between the waters of Sih·er Creek, west, and the Ohio River, east. The elm-atious of the stations occupied above sea-leYel, as determined approximatelj- by referriug them to the nearest railway stations, and by means of the railway profiles, access to which was accorded to Professor Camp~ell, are as follows: Six Mile, nine hundred and thirty-seven feet; Ha_ystack, uine hundred and seventeen feet; Lutz, six hundred and five feet; and 0 and :i\I, six hundred and ninety-nine feet. Each station was referred also in location to the section corners of the Government Land Surveys. At the four stations occupied .fifteen principal angles were measured. For the determination of these angles the number of observations made was one hundred and eighty-two aud the 1mmller of pointings one thousand and ninety-two. Field-work was suspended September 15. Jn December, Professor Campbell occupied th·e days in rnconnaissance for a. new station north of 0 and M, and in May, 1880, be was authorized to use a small unexpended balance of the allotment for his work to continue the reconnaissance. Prof. J.M. Coulter served as recorder in the party. It was but for a brief season tliat. the reconnaissance could be prosecuted in June, 1886, the work being closed umler instrnctious .Tune 30, in consequenco of the failure of the Honse Appropriations Committee to insert the usuul item for aid to State surveys in the Sundry Civil Expenses bill. Dcierm'inativns of gravity at Ann Arbor, .Micll., and at .Madison, Wis.-Heforence was made under the beading of Section II to the plan for carr~·ing on gravitation work during the fiscal year as outlined in instructions received by Assistant Charles S.

After heing oscillated at tlte western stations, these pendulums were remeasured and oscillated·at the Smithsonian Institntiou. Itetluctious of tlie observations at Ann Arbor were carried towards completion, and reductions of those at Madison begun. At both of these stations time signals were kindl,Y supplied b;r the Directors of the Ob,r.;ervatories. 11fat1netic obseri·ations at Detroit, ~illiclt.-Reference has lJeeu already made in this report to the occupation of a number of stations by Subassistant James B. Bayl0r for tbe determination of the magnetic elements, this duty beiug executed under iustructions issuetl in ,July, 1885. At Detroit, ::llich., a station was selected iu the grounds of tlie Harper Hospital, at which observations were made for magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. A comparison of l\lr. Baylm's results with those obtained at Detroit b~· the U.S. Lake Survey at rnrious periods between 1859 aml 1876 will fumish additional data for the value of the secular change of the mvgnetic elements in this localit,y. Geodetic operations-Continuation of the triangulation of tltc State of Wisconsin.-I~rot: John E. · Davies, Acting Ai;;;sistant, has· transmitted his report. of field-work in advaneing the triangulation of the State of Wisconsin during the fiscal ;year. He has taken cccasion in this report to review the history of the origin and pr<igrn~s of the sun·py under llis charge, stating tbe considerations which led to the adoption of the scheme according to which the work bas been developed. Professor Da,·ies reports the cornpletio11 of tbe connection of bis triangulation with that of the U.S. Lake Survey at stations Erin, Delafa~ld, and Lebanon, and remarks tliat while the work was one of considerably greater difficulty tban be batl anticipated, it proved very rntisfactory, the r<'sults sl1owiug that tile triangulation of tbe State, as far as be had canied it, agreed well with tllat executed by the U.S. Eugineers witll much more refined appliances. Tl1e work of the season of 1885, which began July 7, was somewhat retarded by the loss of all the records and papen; of former years in the fire at the Uuiversit.y of 'Wisconsin the previous winter. lt wa,.; louml ueccssary also to revisit many of the statio11s and to rclmilrl some of the sig1~als. A tl'ipml and ecafi'okl signal was begun at Medina station, and preparations made for the re-occupation of station Pleasant Springs in order to get measurements upon Harmony and Janesville stations, which had not been seketed when Pleasant Springs was first occupied. Very variable weather with violent storms prevailed during the month, and delayed the completion of the work at Pleasant Springs till August 1. In August, in anticipation of the occupatiou of l\ledina statiou, near lllarshall, Dana County, 'Visconsiu, a tripod and scaffold signal sixty-firn fcl't. ill height was built at llePseville, and one of seventy feet at Minnesota Junction, one of tbe latitude statious of the r;-.

· Extension u;c:;tuard of the primary triangulation in JJlisiwuri and ICan.wN near the t11irtv.11i11tl1 parallel.-Arrangemcnts were made b,r .Assistant F. D. Granger, in accordance witil instructions, to resume work in Missouri on the transcontinental triaugnlation at as early a date ns 11raeticabh· after the beginning of the fiscal year. During the previous season the trilmgulation had been brought up to tile lines Fulton-Berry antl Bowler-Berry, statious in the western part of Missouri. A tripod aiHl sca1fol<l ou,;t·1Ti11gstation sixty feet Ligh had been erected at station Haskin in Kansa:-, aud Iumher for a sig1fal of the same height at station l\Iarty in Kam·as bad been purchased. Lumber was also ou tlm ground at two otller stations for tlrn erection of tripod and sca:ffoltl signals; hence ~Ir. Grauger was able to take the field without dela;y for the erection of signals, and to settle definitt,ly the interYisihility of some points, determined by the reconnaissance made in 1881, and between which were gro,-cs of valuable trees. lt was found fortunately that the lines of sight passed· sufficiently abow the intervening trees so that they were not aifocted by the variable refraction aud generall~- disturbe(1 atmospheric conditions noticeable in making observations near the surface of the ground. On the 28th of Jul;y, camp was pitched near station Marty in Kansas, about nine miles iu u southwesterly direction from Kansas City, :Mo., and observations were begun August 1. The theodolite was mounted upon the tripod of the signal at an elevation of sixty-four and three tenths feet. From this station, five primary, two secondar,r, and twenty tertiary directions were determined, and obse1Tations for differences of Jieights wnn made upon the principal ohjecti-;. 011 Augtu;t 20, the work at Marty having been finished, the camp and party were transferred to station Haskin, eighteen miles to the southward, and eight miles to the east of tile town of Spring· hill, Johnson County, Kansas. Tbfl elevation of the theodolite at this station was sixty-four am1 six-tenths feet. Five primary and nineteen tertiary olliects were observed. Upon tlie completion of obs~rrntions at Haskin, a station was occupied at Bebe Mound, about three miles west of Edgerton, Johnson County, Kansas. At this point, which is the most prominent one in the localit:y, the observationis were made from an elevation of fifty.fl.Ye fret. Four prim a rs and ten tertiary directions were observed. '\Vith a view to the extension of the sclleme, vertical and horizontal measures were also made upon the most prominent and distant objects to the westward. Station Thomas, about six miles southwest of Olathe, Kaus.,. was next occupied. Five primar,y and thirteen tertiary objects were observed, the theodolite being mounted upon the tripod at an elevation of fifty-four and six-tenths feet. Upon closing the observations at Thomas, Octouer 22, a portion of the camp was stored at Olathe and preparations were made for transferring Urn party to Eckman, Leavenworth County, Kansas, the last point in the scheme ready for occupation. Here the theodolite was elevatell fifty and five-tenths feet above the ground, and the obserrntions upon five primary, one secondary, and sixteen tertiary objects we.re all made lJy Subassistant E. D. Preston. During the season, :Mr. Preston, in addition to making the observations at Eckmau, occup1ed with a. six-inch repeating theodolite three points, selectP-d by him .on the :Missouri and Kansas State line; re-oecupie<l station Berry for observations upon the State.line points, and observed a

During the last days of Juue, personal equation observations had been made by Assistant Edwin Smith and Snbassistant E. D. Preston. During the first uays of July, l\Ir. Preston observed pcrso11al equation with Assistant C. H. Sinclair. l\fr. Preston was tlJen relievecl from duty on longitude work, and :Messrs. Smith and Sinclair continued office-work till July 14, when, nuder instruc. tions, the parties were organized for the work of the season between Kansas City and Colorado Springs, Kansas City and Ellsworth, Kans., and Ellsworth and Wallace, Kans. The charge of one of the 1011gitmle parties was assigned, July 21, to Assistant George \V. Dcau, with the aid of Assistant Sinclair. This party occupied a station at Kansas City, Mo,, in the grounds of tbe Franklin School. The part~· in charge of Assistant Edwin Smith established a station at Colorado Springs, Colo., to the west of the Antlers Hotel and about four buudred feet south of the sta.tion of 1873. Exchanges of siguals lJ~' telegraph for difference of longitncle of Kansas City and Colorado Springs were ha<l on the 11igl1ts of July 28, August 2, 4, 5, am1 7, after which the obserwrs, })fessrs. Smith al.lll Sinclair, changed stations, and similar exchanges were had on the nights of August 7:?, 13, H, and 15. Upon .Mr. Smith's arrirnl in Kansas City, l'rir. Dean proceeded to Ellsworth, Kans., to prepare au olJseniug station, and was joined there lJy l\fr. Sinclair after the completion of tl.tc work 1Jetwcen Kansas City and Colorado Springs. Some <lela;r occurred after the completion of the statiOll at Ellswortll, owing to the nou-arri\'al of the instruments to be used there, which ha4l been forwankd from Omaha. Before excl1anges of signals were obtained, 1\ir. Siuclair was transferred to duty in cliarge of the 'Vest Virginia and I'ennsyl>ania bounda.ry survey, and Subassistant F. H. Parsons was or<lered to Ellsworth in his place. 'l'lie difference of longitude between the station at. Ellsworth, located in the grounds of the public school, and the Kansas City station was determined, iu the first position of tbe ohser\·ers, on the nights of September 8, 10, 13, 14, and 15, after which the obsen-ers challged places, and similar tletermiuations were obtained on September lG, 17, 18, aud rn. For the latitude of the stlltiou at Ellsworth se\·enty-six ohsernltions were made on twenty-one 1>airs of stars on nine nights. Ou Se1itember 18 Assistant Dean was relimwl from duty in connection with longitude work. ::Ur. Parsons proceeded to Wallace, Kans. 1 soon after, and took charge of the station which had been l·stablished there by Mr. Dean in tlae grounds of the Union Pacific Railroad. Between Ellsworth and Wallace, exchanges of arbitrary signals by telegraph for longitude w~re obtained on the nights of September 24, 25, 26, and 29, after which l'tlessrs. Smith and Parsons exch·mged stations, and similar exchanges were obtained on the nights of October 1, 3, 4, 5! and 6.

TransconUnental triangulation near the thfrty-1·inth parallel carried to tl1e eastward from stations in central Utah.-Arrangements for ad,·ancing towards the eastwanl tLc transcontinental trian· gulatiou in central Utah were made by Assistant \Villiarn Eimbeck, in ptlr8nance of instructions · issued towards the en<l of .June, 1885. .Mr. Eimbeck arrived at Salt Lake City on the 14th of July, aud was occupit'.d duriug the remainder of the month in organizing his part~ and in transferring it, "·itli iustrumeutfl, camp outfit, and paek animals, to 1\farJs-rnle, at the bmie of :Mount Tm;liar (formerly known as l\fonnt Belkuaph the station it was intended to occupy. This mountain rises some six thonsaud two lmndred feet abo,-e Marysvale, and has an elevation above sea-level of about tweh-e tl.Jotrnand two hundred feet. At the end of July au advance party had been engaged nearlJ· a week in locating and opening a pack trail up Bullion Canon to the very base of the peak prop~r. The month of August was ~ccupied in completing pack trail to top of peak; in packing ontfit, instrument;;, &c., to camp Tamarack and thence to the peak; in preparing the peak for the reception of the instruments, aml in establishing camp and party at the peak, all of which was accomplished hy the 20th of the month. Senn parties ofheliotropers were also dispatched and posted. The large theodolite was placed in position August 18, and obsen·ations hegun the same da,,-, but not much was accomplished by the end of the month, owing to unfavorable weather. Dnring· September, however, the conditions were favorable for the Yigorous prosecution of tLe work, and by the 22d of that month the observations of horizontal directions, primarJ·, secoudarJ", and tertiary, had been brought to a successful conclusion. The remainder of the month was rrqnirrd to dismount instruments, strike tents, and transfer eYerything on the backs of pack animals to a lower camp. The parts left this lower camp September 29, and Mr. Bimbeck took up the work of connect· ing Lieutenant Wheeler's astronomical station at Gunnison, in the Se\·ier mnr ValleJ·, utnh, \'>ith the primary triangulation. Mr. G. F. Bird served acceptably as an aid in the party. JJcterminat,ions of tlte longitudes of Santa Pc, N.

Sinclair proceeded to Colorado Springs, Colo., and, having organized their respective parties, took up the determination of the dift'erence of longitude between Colorado Springs and Santa Fe, N. Mex. The station here was establish~d by Mr. Sinclair in the grounds of Fort l\Iarcy, and was identical with that of the United States Engineers, thus connecting the two surYeys. Telegraphic longitude signals were exchanged on the night!'l of May 7, 8, 14, 17, and 18, when the obser\'er,; changed stations, and a second set of exchanges was obtained on the nights of l\faJ· 21, 27, 28, at, and June 9. At Santa Fe observations were made by Mr. Smith on three days for the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. From Santa }'e Mr. Smith proceeded to Gunnison, Colo., where he established a station in the grounds _of the Court-House. \Vith Mr. Sinclair at Colorado Springs, signals for longitude were H.

Conference witli the Inspector of Weights and 111easures for tlle State of liliode Island and uith a Committee of the Legislature of tltat State in regard to a standanl measure of length and the estabrishme11t of n meridian liue.-In compliance with a request from Prof. John H. Appleton, Inspector of -\veights aud :Measures for the State of Hhode Island, :Mr. E. B. Let'axour, -of the \Veights and 1\[easures Ufficc, was directed to proceed to Providence, R. I., to confer with that .officer respecting the constrnctiou of a mural 8taudard of length aml also .with regard to the establishment of piPrs for fixing a meridian line. At tile conference, which was held August 25, :Mr. Stephen A. Cooke, ,ir., was present on the part of the 8tate legislatnre, aud the l\Iayor of' Proviuence aiid tlie Oity Engineer on the part ot the municipal authorities. After an examination of niriom; localities, the Dexter Driving l'ark was selected for the 1;ite of the meridian picrsi and, under certain conditions, a l1an.wa.\' in the Court-House for tlle stamlanl of length. :For this standard, the construction recommended as the best, was an iron bar of sufficient le11gth resting upon a bench of stone, this bench to be supported by piers or brackets fastened to the walls of the building; tbe iron bar to rest directly upon brass rollers which are so arranged as to allow free access of air to the bar below as well as abo\"e. In cross-sect,ion the bar maJ· be hal,f an inch thick by one ancl one· half or two inches wi<le'. To insure permanence in molecular structure the bar nmy be heated to a red heat and allowe1l to cool slowly. J>ainting it with asphalt dissolved in turpentine will prevent it from rusting. The <lefining marks are made on German-siker pins inserted into the bar at fifty and one lmu dred feet, and at les8er distances if needed. \Vith. regard to the meridian piers, it was recommended that care should be taken to Im Ye them at leat1t fifty feet away from any iron water-pipes, lamp-posts, or iron railing, and that all clue precauti.011 shouhl be observetl to obtain a firm foundation. If tbe frost line is at six feet, the founda. tiou sllouhl begin at sewn and a half feet below the surface. Beginning then with. a square five feet 011 a sidl', a p~Tamidal pile of broken stone and cement i:s built up to the surface, wliere it is, say, tweut.r iucbes square. Above this is to be lmilt a brick pier eighteen inches square, surmounte<l by a stone cap twelve inches tl1ick. To the north or south of this pier, a meridian line haviug been laid out hy means of a theodolire or transit instrument anll observations of the sun or of the pole star, a similarly constructecl pier is built which may be at a distance of sixty-eight and seventy six one-hnm1redtll meters, or two lrnudret1 and twenty-five feet seven and one tenth inclws. Ou the tiouth pier, two arrangements may be made for centering, one by means of concentric rings, diagonals, and three lines 1200 apart cut permanently into the slate; the other by having a brass plummet poised over the center by a weight so as to be freely raised or lowered. The to11 of the north pier is pmvided with an upright sight, i. a slit, one centimeter (thirty11 ine huudredt hs of an inch) widt>, and twenty centimeters (seven and nine-tenths inches) bigb, cut in a vertical brass plate; this opening may be made more distinct by a sheet of white paper behind it in day-time, or it may be illuminated by a light if used at night. Vertical black lines may be drawn on the brass plate above and below to mark the axis of the slit. The upright plate is secured to a horizontal plate of brass cemented and bolted down upon the stone pier. At the distance suggested, an error in }lointing of one centimeter would 11ot involve an angular error greateP than half a minute of arc. Bot it wonhl be easy to point much cioser, say to one-

For many of the suggestions made, Mr. LefilYonr acknowledges his indebtedness to Asi:-i8tant Schott, who pre1mred a paper on the subject for the use of tlte City Engineer. Subofficc a.t Philadelphia.-The charge of tlw suboffice at Philadelphia was coutiuned witl1 Assistant Spencer C. Mccorkle. He has endeavored as heretofore to establish closer relations between the Survey and tlie 1)eople of the city, and to afford information in regard to its publicRtions or work to all inquirers. During the year requests for information were responded to from United States ofliciah; located in the city; from the Geological Sur.-ey of the State of New Jersey; from the Board of Port Wardeus, the Survey Departmeut and Water Department of Philadelphia, and from the American Philosophical Society; the Pennsylvania Historical Society; the :M:initirne E:i:chmigt>; the Engineer's Club; the :Franklin Institute, antl tbe l\Iercantile LilJrar~._ Office facilities were furnished at \"ariow times duri11g the year to tl1e following:-namcd officers of the Survey: .Assistants Henry Mitchell, R. M. Bache, H. L . .Marindin, C. l\L Raclte, and l\Ir. ·Charles Junken. In addition to the charge of the suboffice, Assistant l\IcCorkle, during July and August, 1885, had supervisiou of the topographical survey of tbe shores of the Delaware Rinr abon Bridesburg, executed l>y the city aut.horities. la January, February, aml March, 1886. he obser,·ed the movement of ice in the riYer and bay, as referred to elsewhere. in t bis report. C 0 AST AND GE 0 DE TIC SURVEY 0 FF ICE. Assistant B. A. Colonna, who was assigued to the charge or the ofiice aud topography Jul~· 24, 1885, succeeding Assistant C. 0. Boutelle in that capacity, IJresents in his annual report (Appendix No. 4) a concise summary of office operations during tlle fiscal year. After a referencP to the changes in the office personnel wliicli occured at tile time of his assignment as Assistant in cliarge, and to the trying ordeal to which the Sun·e,r was snbjected by the course of eYents during the .rear, Mr. Colonna alludes to reforms accomplished in bm;iness methods in the office, some of wllich hall been projected and in part carrieu out by his predecessors. To the chiefs of the office divisions he expresses his appreciation of their cordial support in the performance of the exacting and laborious duties which devolved upon J.Jirn. Au increase of force in the Computing, Drawing, and Eugra,·ing Diyisions of the otnce ig urged as needed to meet the demands of the work. Assistant C. A. Schott, in charge of the Computing Division, has directed the lahon:i of tlie computers, reported the results of computations, answered calls for information, aud ~mbmitterl a number of reports of special value. He bas determined in geographical position a geodetic hue of nearly four hundred a.nd five statute miles in length, forming part of the boundary between California and Nevada, and has in preparation a sixth edition of his paper on the Secular Variation of the Magnetic Declination in the United States and at some Foreign Stations. He hao; taken up also the computation, discussion, and preparation for tbe press of the records of the . U. S. Arctic Expedition under Lieut. A. W. Greely, U. S. A. Mr. W. T. Bright ser"\'ed as clerk to tbe Drawing Divisiou till the dose of bis connection with the Survey, September 50, when Mr. T. J. O'Sullivan, draughtsman, was plactd in charge of it. Soon after the death of Mr. O'Sullivan, which took place l\farch 5, 1886, Assistant E. Hergei'heimer was assigned to a·uty as its chief. l\tr. Hergesheirner's exceptional skill as a topogr~1ph.-r and draughtsman has been of great service in perfecting the re-organization of this division. Assistant Ilerbert G. Ogden has continued in charge of the Engraving and Electrotyping Division, and bas been active in bis efforts to introduce every economy into the purchase of material and supplies, and to keep up the high standind of faithful and artistic delineation reached by the best to}lographical engnwers. ~Ir. Ogden bas gi"\'en special attention to the selection of improved chart papers, and bas succeeded in getting manufacturers iuterested in the production of papers showing a high average of good qualities. In the Electrot_yping and Photogra1lhing branch of the work, Mr. D. C. Chapman, who succeeded Dr. Zumbrock, has introduced uew a11tl

simplified methods, reducing the \Vaste of material and increasing the amount of copper deposited iu a given time; he has been nry successful also in making pilotog-raphic reductions from original sheets, and, by au ingenious device of his own invention, in mounting them to scale. Gpon Jul.r 24, 1885, l\Ir. C. :N. Saegrnuller was relieved from the charge of the Instrument Di dsion, and in August of that year Assistant Andrew Braid was assigned to its direction. Ju addition to the large amount of repairs, alterations, and preparation of instruments for fidd use which were attended to by the mechanicians, many improYemcnts were made under .Mr. Braid's direction in the system of work, the care of material, and in the keeping of the accounts and inYentories of instruments and general property. The dividing engine was thoroughly overhauleil and adjusted for making closer graduations than any before attempted in the ofHce; the construction of a personal equation apparatus was advanced towards completion, and that of a machine for grindiug spirit levels with greater accuracy and uniformity was begun. .Mr. Braid was clwrged also with the details of the Office of Construction of Standard 'Veights and Measures, a dut~- to which he garn much study and to the performance of wl1ich he brought much skill. His repol'to of these duties form part of the report of the Assistant in charge of the office. ~lr. IL S. AYery, who bad been connected with the Survey since 1853, and had been iu charge of the Tidal Division since 186u, resigned September 30, 1885, and was succeeded by Mr. A. S. Christie. Under Mr. Christie's direction, and with the skillful aid e>f Mr. L. P. Shidy, for many ;years past attached to the divis'.on, the office work relating to tides was systematically laid out aml ,-igorously prosecuted. Tide tables were cnmputed in advance for the year 1887, and part, of the proof read; tbese talJles were much enlarged ancl improved for the ports on tlie Atlantic coast, aml b,r means of plans devised for facilitating computations the labor of preparing tlie tide tables will be somewhat rt>duced, Ro that it is hoped to bave the tables for 1888 ready in .January 1887. The l\Iiscellaneous Division has continued under the charge of Mr. M. \V. Wines, General Office Assistant. All of the business of the office with the Public Printer was conducted by him with promptness and good judgment; improvements were made in the administration of tlle chartToom and iu its methods of account; he bad also the care of the correspondence with sale agenti; for tlie charts and other publications of the Survey, and tlJe supervision of the messengers and laborers in the office. Iu November, 1885, Mr. Artemus l\Ia1tin was appointed to the charge of tl!e Archh·es and Library. lt was hoped tllat he would be able to make a much-needed re-arrangement and cataloguing of the library and introduce iru1)fo,·ed methods of record for the volumes of -0bse1Tations and field-sheets, lint owing to repeated attacks of illness this has not ~·et been accomplished. A change in the Accounting Division of the office having taken place in July, 1885, b;r the retirement of Mr. W. B. Morgan, Disbursing Agent of the Survey, the duties of that position were assigned to Mr. George A. lfartlett, Disbnniug Clerk of the Treasury Departmeut. Mr . ·Tolin \V. Parsons was assigned to aid l\fr. Bartlett as Chief Accountant. l'rfr. Parsons's thorough knowlellgc of the accounts of the Sun·ey, and his tireless im1ustry, made his services of r;pccia1 rnlne to thl' work during a trying period in its history. lu tlie office of the Assistar:t in Charge Dr. W. B. French remlered service as execa1 iYe and accounting clerk which is higlily commended by bis official chief. In the office of the Superintendent, Assistant Andrew Braid continued on duty as executiYc officer and adYiser until July 23, 1885, when the changes that then fook place in the Office organ· izatiou led to his transfer to other duty, as stated above. It should have been mentioned in the last Annual Report t)lat Mr. Braid was on duty in the office of the Superintendent, in the capacity jm~t referred to, during the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 1885. )fr.

CONCLUSION.

The preparation of this Report, with the editing for publication of the last Annual Report and appendices tbereto, was intrusted to Assistant Edward Goodfellow. The report for the fiscal year

ending June 30, 1885, was ordere<l printed by Congress iu Jul;y of tlie preseut ~·ear, and is now passing through the press. It is hoped that it wil4 be issued earl;\' in 18S7. In transmitting this report to the Department, after more thau a ~-ear of serTice as SupP,rin tendent of the Surve~·, with special opportunities for obtaining, even within that brief period, 80ll1e personal knowledge of the Yalue of the work accomplished, of its practical usefulness, of tlie iucreasing public demand for its results, of tire demonstration of its high scientific accuracy, of the plausibility which sligltt acquaintance lends to the most fallacious criticism of its g·eneral methods, and of the certainty with which lmtter knowledge of those methods is folluweil hy iucrem1eu respect for tlrem, I desire to place upon record my sense of the earnest effort and steady deYotion to dnty of most of its trained field officers an<.l office ernplo_yes, and my com·iction that the present org-aniza. tion of the work should iu its general features remain esseutially unclrangt>d. 'fl!at organization and its methods are not the complete result of a fiingle creative act; they are the product of more than half a century of growt11, and to their development, Hassler, Bache, l'eirce, and Putter80ll eminent iu scientific attainment aud in ad miuistratiYe ahilit;y, dc,·oted thPir highest efforts dnring more than the life-time of a single generation. The merit of such an organization a11d of its metllods is in no wise compromised by faults or nces in administration, and the remedy for such faults or vices is to be found for this Bureau, lll'l" cisely as for any other Bnrea,n or De.partment of the GoYerument: not in disorganization, but in corrected administration. Since no institution has been or can be entirely exempt from occasional maladministration, the general adoption of disorganization as its remedy would long since lian' destroyed eYery executive Bureau an<l Department. The criticisms recently urged against the organization, methods, auu published results of the Sur,·ey are identical with those which were opposed to the original undertaking in 1807, and 'l>hich were repeated in 1832, 1843, and 1849. In every instance it was shown that the criticisms were fallacious. In the attacks to which it has been thus subjected, the Survey was not only defendt>d by the ablest scientific men of the time (such as IIumholdt, Arago, Schumacher, Henry, Agassiz, &c.), and by the leading scientific budies, commercial orga11izatious, and educational institutions of the country, but the practical wisdom of the plan and methods, which were originally sanciiont>d by .Tefierson and Gallatin in 1807, was vindicated uy their resumption in 1836, after the confessed failure of the experiment of placing the work under naval control; by their formal and unanimous re-adoption in 1843 by ,a·. !,>Oard consisting of three ci ,-ilians, two Na val and four Army officers, and by the fact that no one of the naval officers who has had general charge of the h;vdrographic operations of the Survey has favored a change of such plan and methods. Of the criticisms directed against, these methods, the most. frequent au<l plausible are the alleged subordination of hydrography to other operations of the Survey, ancl the undue extent :rntl ela!Jomtion of its topography. Those criticisms are not only unfounded in f,ict, but they are amenable to tile significant commentary that no complaint of the suoordination of hydrograph,\- has been made by any one of the naval officers under whose direction the general hydrographic work of the Survey has been carried on; that no occasion was found to modify its hydrographic work hy the ex.naval officer an<l experienced navigator who wa_s Superintendent from 1874 to 1881, and that emphatic tel:lt.imon~' to the immeasurable value of the detailed 1~n<1 extended topography exrcuted by the Survcs in conformity to its o,rganic law, "for purposes either of commerce or of defense,~' has been borne by <lenerals W. F. Smith, H. G. Vlright, l\I. C. Meigs, J. S. Negley, and otheri:; whose fields of operation during the late war enabled them to speak from actual experience. The controversy from time to time reue\Yed by tl.te rm·in1l of the saum fallacious hut phmsi~le criticii;ms is as old ai; tlle Surrny itself: No stµdy of that contr(ffersy would be complPte wl!ich did uot include the report in 1828. of Hon. Samuel L. Southard, Secretary of the .Na,·y, in condem. nation of the results of tire work while under naval control, and tire report made iu 1851 by Ilon. Thomas Corwin, Secretary of the Treasury, in answer to n resolnt.ion of the Senate relatin to the transfer of the Coast Survey to the Navy Department. Respectfully submitted. F. M. TllORX,

N 0. 4 .-1886.

REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF OFFICE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR THE YEAR
ENDING JUNE 30, 1886.
UNITED ST.A.TES CO.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washi'ngton ]). C., June 30, 1886.
SIR: I have the honor herewith to su bruit my Annual Report for the Office, with tLe Reports

from each division thereof. On July 24, 1885, the Superintendent of the Survey was suspended, and the Assistant in charge of the Office and Topography, the Disbursing Agent, the Chief Mechan~ian, and the Electrotyper dismissed. The Superintendent subsequently resigned, and the Assistant in charg~ of the Office, who had been dismissed when performing that duty, was reinstated as Assistant in the Coast and Geotietic Survey, but he was not again instructed to resume duty in charge of the Office and Topography.· It was owing to these changes that I was instructed, July 24, 1885, toperform the duties of Assistant in charge of the Office and Topography, by Superintendent Frank M. Thorn as soon as he took charge of the Survey. The ordeal through which the Survey has passed during the twelve months just ended has been a most trying one; that it has sur\"'in"!d is, I believe, largely owing to its own merits. In the midst of, and notwithstanding all its trials~ the work has gone on steadily: every objectionable business method being discarded as soon as it was found, and economies introduced wherever an opportunity offered. From variorn; cause8 the duties which I have had to perform have been exacting and laborious. That I have been able to get along with them at all is due to the cordial support I have received from each and every Chief of Division in the Office, most of them trained and tried in the duties they perform so well. On July :n, 1885, when I had been in charge of the Office three days, I was instructed to report on its condition, &c., which I accordingly did, giving facts as to some matters and opinions as to others. In two important matters my judgment was at fault. One was in regard to the force required in the field, or the normal force; the other as to that required in the Office. On each of these subjects I am now better informed, having bad a year's experience in their practical management, and I make this mention in explanation of some of the recommendations which I feel it my duty to make in the best interest of the public service. I will here allude to oue practice which in my opinion tendetl most to impair the efficiency of the Office. This was the doing of work, chiefly by draughtsmen and engravers, out of office hours, either for the Survey itself or for other parties, for which compensation was received in addition to their regular salaries. The effect of such a practice was to impair the efficiency of the persons engaged in it. · Both of my predecessors, Assistants Cutts and Boutelle, had endeavored to get rid of it, and the latter, in conjunction with Assistant Ogden had practically abolished it in the Engraving Di dsion, but failed in the Drawing Division for la.ck of that support from higher authority which I have received. The practice is now entirely discontinued in every department of this office. The Computing Dh·ision has remained under the charge of .A.ssistan t C. A. Schott. Its proficiency has been maintained, although it, with other Divisions of the Office, was seriously crippled for some months and its members kept in a state of continual excitement. An unusual unmber of queries have been answered a.s to the Magnetie Declination in the United States, which matter has now reached a. point when steps should be taken to place the information which has been so carefully gathered by the Survey, through iRI own observers and from every other available source, in.

L'XI'rED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

tlie hands of e\·ery conuty surrnyor and clerk of court in the United States. The adjustrneut and rectification of many old boundary lines depends npou authentic information as to the magneti~ variation at uiflerent alJ(l often remote periorls. It is therefore important to disseminate this in for· mat.ion and rencler it every where accesRihle by its free distribution. The cost of doing this need not exceed 50 centi'l for eaeh county throngliout the countr.Y. 'J'he force of the, Computing Di\·ision is imtdequate to the work demancletl of it. At least three computer:'! should be provided for, iu addition to the present force, at an average salary not exceed· ing $1,:.!00 each. This force, with such help as could h1~ bad from members of the normal force temporarily unemployed in the fielcl, would in a few ;\·ears bring the work up to date. 'l'lie valuable contribution of mag::ietic data b~: Lieutenant Greely's Polm'. Expedition ha;; been prepared for the press Assistant Schotfs intl·resting report of the operations of the Computing DiYision is herewith trau s mi tted. The Drawing Dirisio11: Mr. IV. T. Bright was clerk and practically at the bead of tlle Draw· in~ Division to September ;:w, when he ceased to be longer' connected with tllc Sun·ey. Mr. T .·T. . O'Sullivan was then placed at its heacl, where he rem«inetl until his death, March 5, 188G, since whid1 time it has been in charge of Assistant E. Hergesheimer. The work of loo king up, arrauging, a11tl c:italoguing the various drawing;;, sheets, &c., which was begtm by Mr. O'Sulli,·an, has been continuetl by l\lr. Hergeslrnimcr, whose extensive k110wledge and great ski 11 in all matters pertaining to the care of original sheets and the production of drawings and charts has been of gTeat sc~n·icc to tLe Office. I take great pleasure in acknowledging the skill of 1\Ir. Hergesheimer aml ltis \'aluahle assistance, and beg to call your attention to the fact that such 81:ill an<l knowlPdg-e as his \rnuld he but poorly recompensed evcu at a salary of $3,000 per-aunum. The force of skilled draughtsmen is entirely inadeqnate for the work that ought to IJe pet·· fornH"11. At least Rix young men shoultl be added to the force, at average salaries not excet>ding $1,~00 iwr annum, to he ilwreasecl as they gain in proficienc,y. The;y should all be of the class from which <lranghtsmen for plwtolithographic work are recruited. 'Ve haYe 110'\V enough ot mediocrity. The force witli the addition indicated. would, with such assistance as could be n·ndere<l by the members of the normal force not engaged in field work, from time to time be able to procluce some of the ch,irts for which we have the field-notes nQw on hand, awl of which tl1e public is dcpriYed of the nsc for want of force to get them out. Endeavoring to cany out my ideas of economy, I immediately on taking c barge of the Offiel' began to look for competitors iu photolithographing such of our charts as we wished to publish hy that process. With this aim I wrote to all the leading firrmi within easy reach, submitting th<: 1lrawings an1l asking estimates on one or two of the simpler jobs. The result was a great range iu price:>, the biJs of tlie firms best acquainted with the requirements of the work being very near together, while those not well acquainted were either excessively high or ridieulonsl~' low. I tried the lowest bidder once or twice, aud there was an entfre failure to 11roduce an.vthing in some of' the works estimated for, and in other::1 there was a result so poor as to be rejected eutirel;v. Aclver· tiseu1cnt fo1· such work is entirely out of the question, and sending tbe finished drawiugs from place to plucc is ruinous to them, so that I am compelled to use a wise discretion iu the matter, as my predecessors ha Ye done, and employ the best until other firms come up to our standard in this class of 'l>ork, so as to have a fair competition. The Engraving Division continues under the charge of Assistant Herbert G. Ogden. That Urn work of this illlJlOrtant Division of the 0 fficfl ww; for a time seriot1sly impaire.l by matter's over which its Chief had no control is too true; th~ dismissal of the electrotyper, and the death of his assistant soon after, deprived us of all facilities in that direction for a time, bnt this has been, or · will be, more than made up iu a short time by the present increased efficiency of the electrotyping and photographing establisl1ment. The reduction from original sheets by pbotographJ and the mounting of the photographs correct to scale has been successfull;y accomplished by Mr. D. C. Chapman, the electrotyper and photographer. This introduces a great saving of skilled labor, since it dis}Jenfes with the services of draughtsmen for making many reductions for engraving, which formerly occupied much time. Every economy bas been practiced in the purchase of material and snpplies in this tli\·ision, and Mr. Ogden has been indefatigable in bis efforts to lessen

expense iu ernry direction. Inquiries into the prices and qualities of different papers for use in printing charts ha\e been continued and are still in progress. The selection of chart papers requires great judgment, and skill in manufacture is essential; they must combine man_)' good qualities and few manufacturers can come np to the requirements. Tl1c force of cngrawrs is entire!.)· inadequate to the requiremeuts of the Suney. We need at least four more ;young meu, at an a\'erage salary of $1,200 pzr annum, to keep up with-work enn wl1en the DiYision is reliewd as much as practicable hy })hotolithography. The excelleut arTaugemeuts made hy Assistant C. 0. Boutelle in the Chart Priuting Hoom lean1 hut little to be <lesirell there. The work is \\ell anti economically done b.'\· the force unrler }fr. I<rank l\Ioore, and l\Ir. Ogden expressel'\ himself satisfied. As I have done in the case of the Drawing Division, l now iu the case of the Eugra\·ing DiYision call yonr especial attention to the inadequacy of the pay of its Chief. A man. of Ur. Ogden's attainments is worth 83,000 as Chief of this Division, and he ought to get it for ser\'ice actually rendered. Tue Instrument Dh-ision: This important DiYision of the Office has beeu much imprnYed undf'r the management of Mr. Andrew Braid, Assistant, who took clrnrge of it early iu August,_ 1885. Its expenses haYe heen reduced iu 11..ie matter of outla-y, new work has been tunu'd out in addition to the usual repairs, and I hope by the close of the present fiscal year to hm·e a Rhop equal to the production of· much of the expensi\·e work that we require. To Assistant l'. 0. Bon· telle is due the credit of lrnxing begun in the right direction in the Instrume11t Shop. For want of proper books and in\entories we could not readilr account for the iustrnmeuts belonging to the Sur,e.r, but an effort has been malle to get everything entered on a set of books that have been openetl; inventories have been prepared and the instrmneuts are now all eutered thereou; the general propert:y has like>l""ise been inwntoried. This lahorions duty has heeu performed mainly b.r ::\Ir. Braid. In addition to the labors incident to a thorough overhauling of the shop, hooks, and accounts of tlie lni,;trmuent Division, Mr. Braid has been charged with the details of the \Veights aud Measures Bureau, which !1e h·as mastered and performed with skill. I cannot express too strougly my appreciation of his sen·ices. · If tlle (lnties that be has performed for the Coast aml Geotletic Snrw~· are worth a11ytl1iu~ they are rielJly worth $:3,000 per aunurn. The Di\isfon needs a good clerk with qnalifications necessars to enable him to assbt in adjusting- and testing the instruments, and the pay should be about $1 1200 per annum. The Tidal Division had been found by Assistant C. U. Bontelle to be far behindhand iu its worl;. "Mr. H. S. Avery, who 11ad been its hea{l for many ~·cars, resigned September 30, 1885, and was succcc<k(l h.r l\Ir. A. S. Christie, under whose direction the records have been thoroughly o\·erb:mlcd, autl a new era of earnest work inaugurated, about in the same line as hau been prearranged b~- Assistant Bontelle. Owing to the calls for our tide tables as much as niue or ten months in advance, I ha\e directed that the predictions for 1888 be completed as soou a!> possible, and it is boped that the tables will be published early in January. To Mr. Uhristie aud l\Ir. Shidy particular credit is due for the accurate manner in which lll'edictions have been malle an(l the proof read of these tables for 1887. This Division of the Office is now in good discipline, and the work s;rstematioally laid out and Yigorously prosecnted. Two additional co1111mters at aYerage salaries of $1,000 could be profitably employed in this work. The l'tliscellaneons Division has continued under the charge of :Mr. l\L W. 'Yiues, Ge11eral Office Assistant. He has conducted all of our business with the Govl:'rnment Printing Olfiee with his usual good judgment and promptness, attended to ttie extensirn correspondence with our Chart Agencies, and continued bis improvements in this service, and has heartily co-operated witl1 me in all efforts to introduce economies, whether in the matter of original purchase or in the economical use and good care of our property. The Ohart Room has, under his charge, greatly improved both iu ad111i11istmtion aud iu its accounts. Steps have been taken to guard the disposal of the charts aud to enable mi to account ior every one printed. It entails much labor ou the one man in charge, mme perhaps than he can be expeetecl to do thoroughly, but by continued efforts and the aid of a perfected system it is hoped

that l\Ir. Eichl.101.tz will prove equal to tile task. The messengers and laborers have been under tue control of ]Ur. Wines, as ha\'e the office wagon and many other minor matters not involving great resvousibility, but the proper management of which goes far toward facilitating business. It llas at times required very close management to get the messengers and laborers' work in the Office thoroughly well <lone on account of the scarcity of this kind of help; and we would be crippled "·ere these men not particularl;y skilled in their duties. The Lil.nary and Archives was without a hea{l until NoYember 14, 1865, wbe11 l\fr. Artemus )fa1·tiu was appointed to the position. I had hoped that we should have a first-class arrangement of our beoks and <la ta from the time lie took bold of the matter, but he has proven quite unequal to the task, one spell of sickness after another ha\'ing so prostrated him that he has done little or nothing to iwprore matters there. A very fair arrangement of the Tidal Records llas l;een made b_y l\lr. Duesberry, and be ba1:; re-arranged a lot of miscellaneous matter in one of tile u111ier rooms. With tbis exception, the DiYision ha..'> made i10 progress. The Accounting Division was under the charge of 1\lr. W. D. Morgan up to 25th Jul~·, 1885, when lie ceased to be at its head, and the dut.y was assigned to Ur. George A. Bartlett,, Disbursrng Clerk of the Treasury Departmeut. The accounts were audited in the Coast Surrny Office h.r the Coast Survey Accountants, and ou presentation, duly certified, they were paid by Mr. Bartlett. To the courtesy of this gentleman we are much indebted, and notlling Las beeu left uudoue by Lim to facilitate our work. It has been a great burden on him a11d a great responsibility, for wl1ich · -some compensation is justly due him. Tl1e Coast and Geodetic SunTey should uot, in my opinion, be left witllont a disbursing agent. As matters now arc, it is quite impossible to have a strict ~tccmrnt oft!Je public property kept. Great improvements have beeu made, but tl1e limit has been 11early reacued beyond which we cannot advance until we have a well-organized disbursing office, whit!h .-;hall likewise be charged with the property accounts. It will invoh·e some expenditure, hut I t lliuk it wonltl lH· wise to ma,l;:e the outlay and ue able to account for everything belonging to the Survey nt an;r time. Ur. W. B. }'rcnch has been untiring in his efforts to facilitate tho lmsiness of tlJe Office. M.r illcrt'<Jt:"('(l responsibilities ba,·e been fully shared by him, and he has under my direction rec<·ind am1 accountecf' to me for all of the moneys coming to hand on Coast and Geodetic Survey ncconnt. J tah gn·at pleasure in commending bis zeal and fidelity and in expressing my obligatious to Lim. During the year the Office has lost b;y death the services of the following-named employes: (I) Samuel lleiu, April 13, lSSG. Mr. Ilein had sen·ed as Disbursing Agent of the Survey forU tl\nmls of thirty· two years. His deatlt took place shortl:)· after he bad resigned llis position as Lihrari:rn, i 11 which capacits he had remleretl serdce uuring eight years. (~) T ..J.

(G) Hazzard l\IcCoy, mail messenger and Jriver for the Office, March 10, 1886. (7) Uichanl ·waters, fireman, August 30, 1885. The statistics of 'rnrk accomplished in the Office <luring the past year, accompanying this Heport, show that notwithstanding the drawbacks aud trials and loss of time consequeut ou the numerous investigations carrieu ou in the building, involving of necessity some clemoralizatiou on the part of a portion of the per.~onnel of the Office, there has been an amount of work accomplished which is creditable au<l praiseworthy. Both in quantity and quality it is fully up to tqe standard which bas characterized our previous pulllicatfons and bas so often eiicited high praise from all parts of the world. I l1ave strong hope that the coming year will show increased efficiency, and shall <'lliploy every rneau8 in my power to secure it. Yot1rs, respectfully, B. A. COLONNA,

DEAR SIR: In conformity witll regulations I htffe the llouor to submit the usual report of work done by tlle seYeral computers and attaches to this diYision of the oflicc for tl1e fbcal y1·ar ending June 30, 1880. · The charge of the Computing DiYision was continued with the undersigned, aud the 011l_y cbaug.:· in tl1e personnel was that of the transfer of l\Ir. A. S. Christie to tlle head of the Tidal Dirision 011 October 1, occasioning a Ios;; of computing force during uinf\ months, as his pince l1as 11ot l1ee11 filled. Tlie computation of telegraphic longitude work had to be suspended entirely in consequence of this loss. The temporary help was Yery limited; Mr. \\~. A.uhagen was attached dnriug July; Mr. J. Nelson reported for duty October IO, aud was detached November !!8, 1885; :\Ir. ,J. \V. G. Atkins reported for duty December 7, 1885, and n·signcd his position in Hie snrny Jmnrn1'.'. 20, 1886; Mr. \V. B. Fairfield remained with the Computing Dh-ision from January 13 to h·hrna1y 17, 1886; Assistant E. Smith was attacheu between .Ja11uary 13 and April 12, 188G; .Assi;,!a111 C. II. Sinclair was attached between February 23 and :March 31, 1886; Sul.Ja:,:sistant F. Il. Par~011s reported for duty April 2, 1880, and coutiuued to the dose of the fiscal year. ]11 cuu:w11m·11ec ot heavy calls for copies of descriptions of stations and for geogra11hical po;.;itim1;.;, sen·ral writers were temporarily employed. Besides the work of tlirectiug, supervising, and reporting results of tlle cou,putation~ performed in this Di\·ision, the preparation o.· data and the fnrnisliiug of professional informaiiuu called for by office correspondents as well as for regular field use li,v tllc survey parties, I ham cumpntell the distances and directions of a number of positions lyiug in the geodetic line forming part oi' tlie boundary between Nevada and California, and nearly four hundred aud five statute miles iu leugth; have brought out a memoir on the Magnetic Dip and Ju tensity, illustrated by thret. maps of tlie United States showing the distribntiou of the magnetic dip aud the distribution of the horizontal and total intensities of tlle eartlf's magnetic force; ham written au article for use-by the Geueral Land Office on the magnetic declination in the United States; have written a report showiug the methods and formulrn applied to the computation and least square adjustment of the "Davidson ~nadrilaterals" in Ualifornia, to serve as a specimen of the treatment of such large operatiuns by t~ Survey; have advanced the discussion of the secular variation of the magnetic declination in the C nited States, preparatory to the sixth edition of this paper; aml in J uue took up the compu. tation, discussion, and preparation of the records for the pre:;;s of the astronomical and 111agnctie observations made by the Uuitetl States expedition to Lady Franklin Bay, 1881-'84, Lieut. Greely iu command. I also made the usual annual ru:ignetic obscnTatious in this city. Chiefly through tlie labors of l\Ir. E. Il. Courtenay, the 'Computing Di\·isiou was allle to hliug out for publication the geographical positions and otller geodetic data determined in the States of Massachusetts ancl Rhode Island since the beginning of the SmTey; 1,IG2 points iu the former, and 314 in tbe latter State-all based on the standard astronomical data of the Survey and referred to the surface of the spheroid known as Clarke's of 1866, and completel,v harmonious, the unavoidable small discrepancies adhering to all measures having been removed by dispersion through adjustment. The work performed by each computer during the year is herewith appended in detail. Edward II. Courtenay was chiefly engaged upou ti.Jc adjustmeut of the various tl'ianguhttious executed in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and in preparing the geodetic results for publication. This included also a recomputatiou of the Borden triangulatio11 of :\1nssachusetts, strengthem~d by connection with the Coast and Geodetic Surrn;y. Be made fair progress with the work of placing the old triangulation of Connecticut and New York 011 standard geodetic data, and with the com. putation of the modern survey of the western part of Long Islaml Sound, 1881-'85. Ile also has the geographical registers under his charge, takes care of the duplicate records (astro11owic, geo. detic, and magnet_ic) of the Survey, aud prepares geodetic data for field or office use. Myrick H. Doolittle computed the new triangulation (188!) of the Delaware River a burn Phil· atlelphia; prepared abstracts of horizontal directions at tbe 11rimary stations Mount Diaulo, Sierra Morena, Mount Bache, Mount Toro, California, and of Toiyabe Dome, Lo11e l\Iountain, J\fonnt

GNITED STATES COAST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The changes in the Office force incident to the investigation of the Sur\·ey a year ago had an appreciable effect in lessening the results of the engraving aml electrotyping; but the appoint· ment of l\Ir. D. C. Chapman as Electrotyper and Photographer in January bas proved so satisfactory that we are now as well prepared as ever for that class of work. The resignation of l\fr. E. A.. l\Iaedel in October deprived us of a first-class letter cngraHr, and the work of .the engraving has necessarily been retarded by the loss of his services, but we may hope that the steps taken to supply this deficiency will prove effective before the close of another.year. The engraYers were employed during the year principally as follows: E. A. Maedel, A. Petersen, A. C. 1::,uebsam, and F. Courtenay, on lettering; II. l\I. Knight, on lettering and sand; W. A. Thompson; H. C. Evans, an<l n. F. Bartle, on topograpby and sand; J. G. Thompson, on lettering and miscellaneous corrections and auditions; T. \Yasserbach, on sand and. miscellaneous corrections and add~tions; E. JI. Sipe and \Y. H. Da\·is, 011 rniscellane ous corrections and additions; J. Euthoffer and E. J. Entho.ffer, on topograph~·. All of the cngranrs in the Office were employed at different times, in addition to their regular work as specified, on miscellaneous corrections and additions aml such other misce1lani:ous work called for, as cleaning altos and new. printing platei;;, marking instruments, &c., although this class of work bas not been so hea,·:r as in former .rears, owing to the practical suspension of the electrotyping for several moutlll5 and the emplo,yment of an engraver in the Instrument Shop for a short period. The correction of the standard printing plates before striking off im1Jressious of the charts for sale by the agents continues to he a work of unceasing care and labor, contrary to tlle ...-iews I expressed three years ago. The changes in Aids to Navigation are so frequent that mau;v charts require corr~etiou e...-ery three or four months~ au<l there are very few that can safely be misumed to be correct a ~-ear after they are printed. The publicatioi1 of Qual'terly Notices to ·Mariners, recently inaugurated, is a step in the direction of affording ship-masters the means of bringing up their own charts with the most important correctionEc> themselves, and which it is belie,-ed will enntually lead to a more detailed system of monthly or even weekly notices. The c.bart printing bas c011tinued under my superYision and the immediate <lirel'tion of l\1r. Fra11k :Moore, foreman of the rooms. Twenty-eight thousand fl.ye lmmlrell copies of the charts wne printed for the chart-room, the largest number eYer printed for this purpose in one year; and in addition the Engraving Division has been supplied with all necessary 1noofs; seventy-five lrnndred proofs liaYe lleen printed for the Coast Pilot, and the usual "transfer impt·essious" were 1mde of the ProgrPss Sketches for the Annual Report, and some printing for outside parties, including "transfer impressions" of plates of postal-route ma1)s for the Post-Office Department, for which a charge was made. The effort to secure a more :;uitable paper for the chart publications was renewed during fhe scar. Correspondence was held with el<~ven manufacturers, seven of whom submitted samples. Three of the samples showed promise of imprornment, but we receiYed consignments for trial from only two mauufacturers. One consignment tllat was desirable in many respects was not satisfactory for hand corrections; this firm are now making ::t second sample for triaL The other consignment showed such a: high average of good qualities that tlle manufacturers were gh·en an order for sixteen reams. Certain desirable qualities can only be demonstrated by actual experience with a large number of sheets, and this order having proved generally satisfactory a second order lms been given. This is still far from an "ideal paper," but the manufacturers evince an interest in the matter that will 11robably lead to further improvement. The cost is -tlie same as paid for the American machine-made paper heretofore used. The presses ha·e been in charge of Mr. Frank Moore, foreman, assisted by T. Sullivan; D . .N. Hoover, as11isted bs J. Bt'ck, until his transfer to the charge of a press, and then by T. J. Mci\Iahon; .T. h Smith (until his transfer to another Division of the Office), assisted by H. Dyer; a)Hl ,T. Beck, assisted by II. D.rer, until l1is transfer to another Division of tlie Office, and ~ince then by G. Cranford. The. retirement of Dr. A. Zumbrock, electrotyper and photographer, in July 1885, and the long illness and subsequent death of Frank Over, his assistant, practically suspended operations of this class for several months. Mr. D. C. Chapman was assigned to Dr. Znrnbrock's duties in Jatmary. He ~oon mastered the detai1s of the electrotyl'fing, so that on April 22 I was enabled to

re11ort to you our ability to resume work for the ·war or Navy Departments as heretofore. He has introduced new methods simplifying the care of the batteries and reducing waste of materials, which, with systematic attention to the work, gave us tl}ree hundred and twenty pounds deposit in one month, an amount that bad never been reached before with these batteries. JHr. Ohapmau has also been successful in making photographic reductions and in mounting them to scale by an ingenious device of his own invention. The Photographic Gallery was assigned to my superviisiou in September, 1885; previous to this it had been under the immediate direction of tbe Assistant iu charge of the Office. Experiments-were soon after commenced to ascertain the practicability of making vhotographic reductions immediately from the original topographical sheets, and a young gentleman was appointed on trial for this purpose; his efforts, however, were not satisfactory, and some work executed in the city was also a failure, so that further experiments were abandoned and only resumed on the appointment of Mr. Ohapmau to the division. The availability of photographic 1·eductions of original sheets without tlie intermediar;y tracing will be the subject of a special report when tlle ex11eriments now in hand have been completed . .M:r. E. A. Ma<>.del, engraver, resigned October 1, 1885, in preference to becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States. Mr. l\faedel had been employed in the Engraving Division for twenty-eight years, and was an artist in his profession. He was not excelled in his specialty of letter engraving by any of his associates, and it may be truly said that he has.left a stamp of his genius on the charts of the Survey which those who follow may well endeavor to emulate. Frauk Onr, for many years assistant to the Electrotyper, :md Photographer, died February 19, 1886. He had been ill with typhoid fover, and it is belie'\"ed in his anxiety to resume work returned to bis labors too soon after convalescence. He was a man of integrity and probity and was ]leld in higlt esteem by aJl who knew him, especially those who had cognizance of the faithfulness of his long care~r in this office. Mr. John H. Smoot bas continued to 11erform the duties of clerk of the DiYi:iiou iu a most &atisfactory manner. I append !1ereto a list of the copper 11lates that we1'e complete1l, continuecl, or connnenced during the year. I remain, sir, yours, very respectfully, HERBERT G. OGDEN, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Surrey, In char.qe of Engniving Dfrision. B. A. COLONNA, Esq., Assistant itt charge of Otfiee.

REPORT OF THE INSTRUME:NT IJIT'ISIOR, COAST AND GEODETIC Sl"RVEY OFFICE FOii THE YE.:lR ENJJING JUNE :m, 1886.
COAST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

In accordance with instructions I took charge August, rn, and liaxe continued to the present time. Owing to the large number and great variety of instruments used in the yarious operations of the Survey, a large amount of re1miring and altering is constantly required, and this has, as heretofore, constituted the main work of the mechanicians, but a considerable amount of new work has also been accomplished. The preparation of instruments for the field, including their critical examination, adjustment, ~nd determination of constants, such as le;el and micrometer values, inequality of pivots, &c., has been carefu11y attended to, as has also the official correspoudence and the keeping of the records. The dividing engine Las been thoroughly oYerhauled, and the missing parts supplied, and it is therefore now in good working order. It has moreover been so adjusted that closer graduations than any heretofore attempted in this Office are now possihle, and an experimental two-minute graduation has been made upon a fourteen-inch circle. A critical examination of this graduation will deteimine the degree of accuracy attainable, and should the result be satisfactory I will recommend th at the circles of a number of our large direction instruments be thus regraduated. It is even practicable to graduate our sixteen, eighteen, and tweuty incl! circles still closer, >iz, to one minute. The personal equation apparatus and the printing· chronograph commenced last year are well advanced toward completion, but haYe been for the present set aside for more pressing work. The latter instrument I c0Dside1· of uoubtful uti1ity on account of its com1Jlicated structure and consequent liability to get out of order. It might in proper bands be useful in a fixed observatory, but is not suitable for field parties. A machine for the more accurate and uniform grinding of the spirit levels for our astronomical and geodetic instruments has long been a desider!ltum, and such a one has been devised by Mr. Suess, and its construction begun. The imported le>els now used are ground by band and are necessarily expensive, and it is calculated that the cheaper production of the machine-ground levels, to say nothing of the greater accuracy expected, will in a single :rear compensate for the cost of the machine. The new instruments matle have been }nfocipa!Jy st~tion transit!!, protractors, plane-table compasses, and minor instruments, the smallness of the force employed and our limited facilities precluding the possibility of manufacturing on a large scale. I am of opinion, however, that it would be,_ndvanta.geous to manufacture more of our instruments, such as theodolites, planetables, le¥els, &c. The better equipment of the shop, which I have already recommended, and the employment of efficient mecbanicians only, would enable us, without much increase of force, to keep pace with the requireme'nts of the Survey. Of course certain instrmnPnts, such as chronometers, barometers, binoculars, &c., will always have to be purchased. The following statement shows in detail the force employed in this Divisiou during ibe year and indicates the character of the work performed by each person : Mr. E. Eshleman served during the entire year; be has acted as foreman of the shop, attended the repairs of theodolites, meriilian instrume:Qts, sextants, levels, &c.; the silvering of sextant and heliotrope mirrors; the ruling of diaphragms for tranl!its, alidades, &c.; am] has made the necessary repairs and alterations on the dividing engine. He has also graduated circles for protractors, compasses, reconnoitering telescopes, engineer transits, &c., and bas rendered valnahle assistance in the.examination, adjustment, and testing of instrumentR for the fielcl.

Wasl1i11gto11, Stptember 17, 1880. DEAR Sm: I ha;e the honor to su!Jmit the following report of the Instrument Division for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1886: At the beginning of the year }fr. G. N. Saegmuller was still in diarge of tlie Di;ision, but was relieved July 23, 1885.

Washington, Jmie 30, 188G.
SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith the anmrnl rqmrt of this division for tbr 3·par enfling June 30, 1886. All tidal and meteorological records receh-ed lrn1e hcen irnipectcd and registered and all .Uuplicates filed; the proofs for the Tide Tables for tlrn Atlantic and. Pacific coasts of the linited States for the year 1886 have been read; similar taules for the ~·ear 1887 ham been computed and part of the proof reacl; tidal notes for charts ha,·e been furnished as required; talmlationR of higli and low waters and half.hourly ordinates, with sketches and descriptions of tidal litatiou:; .and hencli-marks, for the use of tlie hydrographic officers of the Survey, have been prepareu \Yhen called for, and also all tidal information for persons not connected with tl1e Snrvey. This constitutes the unavoidable current work of the Division. Ju addition thereto, pre,·ions to October 1, a laborious examination of the Old Point Comfort series was made and a reduction Qf the Fort Conger observations was begun ; am.I since October 1 other work has been doue as follows: The original records have heen completely separated from the duplicates and re·luctions by filing the former in the archives and retaining the latter in the rooms of the Tidal Divif'ion; the maregrams (rolls from st>lf-registering tide.gauges) ha-ve beeu arrauged geographically by station, each _year's record at a station in a separate package, proper!.)· labclt>d; the original tide-books have been arranged ou shelving by section and register number, the duplicate tide books in the same order in shelf boxes; the reductions have been classified aml i,;tored iu tluist-proof shelf boxes provided with doors and easy of access ; a register of originals lias been made alHl filetl in the Tidal Di-vision; a set of reduction forms have lieen devised and adopted uniform in size (eight by teu inches) with the ''computing paper" in use in the Survey; a voluminous and permanent!~· valuaUle set of perforate<! or stencil addition forms have been prepared for tile harmonic series K, L, M, N, 0, P, Q, v, and u; harmouie reductions of one J·ear's obsen·ations each have been made for New London, Fernandina, and Key "\Vest, and nsed as tlie basis of the predictions for 1887; and various short series have been reduced by non-harmonic methods. The work of the several computers an<l clerks is herewith given in detail: l\lr. R. S. Avery inspected the tidal observations received, attended to the L-OtTespon(lence relating to tides and tide-gauges, read proof for the Tide Tables for 188G, gave c-011siderable attention to the Old Point Comfort series, prepared tide-notes for charts, and began the reduction of the Fort Conger observations. Mr. A veQ' continued in charge and had general snpcrdsiou of the work of the Division until Septembn30, when his connection with the SarYeJ· terminated b,Y resignation. Mr. Alex. S. Christie was put in charge October 1. He has ins11ected tlie tidal records received, attended to the correspondence and calls for tidal dnta and iuformatiou, and aided in and had supervision of the work of the Division. · Mr. L. P. Shidy examined the Old Point Comfort series, classified and arranged tho rNluctions and duplicate records, computed auxiliary tables for the harmonic anaJ~·sis, devisetl stencil addition forms and assisted in their preparation, devised reduction form8, made harrnouic red actions for New L_!,mdon, Fernandina, and Key )Yest,, made non-harmonie reductions for sen·ral ,.tations, predicted with t be machine for the Paci1ic coast for 1887, n~atl proof, instructed others in tidal work, and took up the Fort Oonger series. Mr. Shidy's ability, experience, and nusclfish deYotion to the work entitle him to high commendation. Miss :M. Thomas reduced observations at Little River, California, worked on the Okl Poiut Comfort and Pulpit Harbor series, and copied tables. Miss Thomas was transferred from this - Division October 4. Miss O. D. Turnbull worked ou the Oltl Point Comfort series, assisted in arranging the rccluctions, prepariv addition stencils, cop~-iug the predictions, malling proof and preparing auxiliary H.Ex.40-17

The usual distribution of the l{cport was made, as well as of the other pnulications of the Survey, to the Departments of Government, iusti· tution.s, and individuals. The Appendices to the .Annual Reports, published in pamphlet form, were, upon application, distributed gratuitously as heretofore. Thirteen Notices to lllarinern, a list of which is embodied in t.ilis report, were issued dnriug the year. '.l'he demand for eopies of Appendix No. 12, Beport fJr 1882 (Secular Variation of' the Magnetic Declination in the United States and at some Foreign 8tations, fifth edition) by county surveyors, civil engineers, attorneys at law, aud others specially interested in the subject of which it treals, was so great that the edition (500 copies) was exhausted early in Nm·ember, and it was necessary to reprint it. Accordingly 5()() additional copies of this edition were priated. The continued calls for this paper indicate that it is regarded as a standard anthorit;y throughout the couutr;y. The Tide Tables for both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for 188i were sent to press. There were distributed duriug the year 70 copies of tbe .Atlantic Coast Pilot, 348 subdiYisions of the same, and l1J8 copies of tile Pacific Coast Pilot.

REPORT ·OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1886.
COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

lVasltington, October 19, 1886. Sm: I have to submit the following report of the hydrographic work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the year endiug June 30, 1886. On the 15th of October, 1885, I was detailed l>,y the honoral>le Secretary of the NaYy for dutr as Inspector of Hydrograp~y, relieving Commamlt>r U. :M. Uhe~ter, U. S. N., who was ordered to a command afloat. At the time of his detachment, Commander Chester bad been connected with the Survey for over eight years, during five of which be had been Inspector of Hydrograpby. His interest in the work of the Survey had been so great, and his methods of conducting the duties of this office so successful, both as regarQ.s the hydrography itself and the repairs and maintenance of vessels, that I ha,-c only endeavored, so far, to carrJ' out the system inaugurated by him. During the summer of 1885, the steamer Blake with tlie h;1·drographic party under charge of Lieut. J.E. Pillslmry, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was engaged in work 011 the .Eastern Coast, the greater part of the season. being devoted to special examinations of reported dangers in Long Island aud Vineyard Sounds and on the coast of l\Iaiue. The party was also engaged in completing the bydrography of Saco Bay and approaches and Cape Split Harbor. In July an examination of George's Bank was made by Licntenaut, Pillsbury with special reference to the location of a site for a light-house, a full report of which was made to you and to the Light-Honse Board at the time. Late in the fall, when it was i'mpossible to continue with proper economy the work on the northern coast, the Blake was put in condition for carrying on the surface and subsurface current work iu the Gulf Strnam, off' the coast of Florida, the results of the previous season Laviug been so Ya1aable and interesting, both to the practical navigator and to the scientist, as to make it important that the work should be continued. Tidal stations were established at Tortugas, and tbe serial current observations carried on with a view of determining more accurately what had partially been determined the previous yearthe relations existing l>etween the entrance of the tidal wave to tbe Gulf and the Yelocity of the Gulf Stream. This work requires tbat a vessel should anehor in water of great depth, and at present little trouble is experiencetl in 500 fathoms. Had the appropriation permitted, it was propo:;c<l this year fo try anchoring in depths as great as 2,000 fathoms, but even with the limited means at our disposal, Lieutenant Pillsbury intends anchoring in 1,000 to 1,too fathoms for still further investigation of this interesting subject. The detailed report of Lieutenant Pillsbury, con laiuiug much Yaluable and original matter, has already been laid before yon. In May, the work in the Straits of Florida having been completed, tLe party in the Blake began the off-shore sounding on the coast of Virginia, carrying the lines out to the lOO-fat11om cnr·e. This work was continued until the end of the fiscal year.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC Sl'RVEY.

Tile beginning of tbe year found the steamer Baclie, under the command of Lieut. E. D. F. Heald, CT. S. N., Assistant Cnast and Geodetic Surwy, on the working grouml on the coast of :Maine, where during the 1mmmer and fall the party finished ti.Jc bydrography of Pleaf:ant Rin·r, :Machias l{iwr, and the upper portion of Machias Bay. U11on the return cf this part;\· to New York, at the ('IHI of the tenl:'ou, Lit>utenant Heahl, bavi11g serYed oYer three ;years on the Surver, was dEta<"hed allfl directed to a8i<nme his regular wH·al duties. In thiis connection I 1lesire to express lll.Y rt-gret i11 losi11g the senices of a11 officer whose tour of dut,Y was iso marked b_y lti:s great interest in the work and the success attained in prosecuting all that was assigned to him. Lieut. ,J. :M. Hawley, U. S. :X., Assis taut Uoast aml Geodetic SurYey, after ftnishi11g the work assigw·ll llim i11 Kew York Ilarhor, was directed to assume command of the Bache, and with that party proceetletl to the coa.~t of T1onisiana, where, after rmrnin g a few su pplernentar;y liues of souu,ling;.i oft' t be Uuan<leleur Isla11ds, he took up the examination of Horn Islaud Pass. 1Jmiug the remaindt·r of the winter and s1iring this party was emplo)-ed in executing tlie h,vdroirraphy from Xorth Anclote to Herriug Bluff, Florida. On the 26th of Ma_y the vessel proceeded to New York to prepare for work on ti.Jc coast of Maiuc. The Getluey, under the commaml of Lieut. I·'. II. Crosb_y, U. S. N., Assistant Coa8t a1,1d Geo· detic S nrYey, was ernvloycd iu Delaware Bay, and executed the hydrography in Maurice IU,·er aud Bay and o\·er the sl10als around Cape May l'oint, thus completiug the resurvey of Delaware Hh·er froll! l'hiladelphia to the sea. Duriug the winter the Geduey was employed on the coast of Louisiana, and completed the ott'-sl10re ltydrogrnpb)· west of the l\lississippi Delta to the entrauce to Barataria Bay, aud also executed the hydrography of Cote Blanche Bay. The Gedne.y closed work in the Gulf on May rn, an<l proceeded to New York from Pensacola, Fla., with the schoouer l\fatdiless in tow, arriving there on l\Iay 31. As it was important to push the work in Long Island Souud as rapidly as possible, the ;wcessarr repairs to the vessel and other preparatious were made with great haste, and on June 15 slie started for her new working grouu<l. The part~· on board the 1>tearner En<leaTor, under the charge of Lieut. G. U. Hanus, U. S. N., Assistant Coast aml Geodetic Surve:r, begau operations in the i,;pring, and at the beginuiug of the fiscal year was still engaged 011 the hydrograplly of the lower ha,y of New York Harbor_ \\'ith the \'iew of comparison with past survrys, and in order to lla·e the most accurate obtaiuaule data for fnture reference, the work ou the bar w<is executi::-d with greater refinement than would be nece::isary for the navigator alone. During the winter the party on board the Endearnr completed the hF1rograpl1;y of the liar and approaches of Santee Hi\·er, Dewees, Caper's, and Price'1> Inlets, a portion of Bull's Bay, aml th,e main channel across Charleston Bar. As there are few protected anchorages on the coast from which the work can be eco11ornieally carried 011, Endeavor was frequently obliged to anchor in an exposed position to ride out gales of win<l, au nu pleasant place for a small steamer. Early in July the schooner Reatly, nuder command of Lieut. Sunm<·r C. Paine, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, left New York for work on the north Hliore of Long Is'and Souud. This work was carried on until the end of the season, when the Heady was sent to New York aud Lieutenant Paine was detached and ordered to duts at the Naval Observatory. ·while Lieutenant Paine's services on the Survey extended o\·er only 011e summer, the records of the season's work are sufficient indication of Lis energy and aptitude, and it was a imbject of regret to this office that he could not remain longer on the Survey. The beginning of the year found the schooner Eagre under command of Lieut. J. l\f. Hawley, C. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, at work in East River, New York, where work hall been commenced iu the spring under the appropriation of $30,000 for the resurvey of New York Bay and Ilarbor. This party remained in the field until November, continuing the bydrography of East l{iver as far ns Blackwell's Jslnml. The additional dangers discovered afford ample cvi· deuce oft he necessit,r for the resurvey of this great thor-0ughfare.

In 1'iovember Lieutenant Haw le~· was relieved from command of the Eagre by Lieut. D. D. V. Stuart, and assumed command of the steamer Bache, as al read~· mentioned, and the Eagre was sent to the New York Navy-Yard for the winter. Early in Y£ay a party was organized on board tlle Eagre, under the comm'.IIHl of Lieut. C. P. l'erkins, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sune~·, and commenced field operations in North River, contiuuing the work of the previous seasou as far as and through Spuytcn Du;Hil Creek. The end of the ~-car fouud the vessel at College I'oint engaged on work in Flushing Bay. The schooner Palin urns, commanded by Lieut. W. G. Cutler, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geocletic Sun·e.Y, contiuued the work~ commeuced iu the spring, in North l{iyer, aud was emplo~·etl in acth·e field-work until the latter part of November, when tlle \·essel was laid up for tlle winter, aud Heutenant Cutler, after fHlITing successfully on the Survey tor nearly three years, was detaclled and onlered to the U. S. S. Dolphin. Early in April a part,\' under the command of Lieut. D. D. Y. Stuart, U. S. N., Assistant Coast ancl Geodetic Sun·ey, was organized on board the Palinums and commenced work on the north shore of Long Island Souncl from Sheffield Island Light to tllc westward, wllere the party was engaged at the eud of this year. The steamer Arago, having been laid up during the summer and winter, was placed in charge of Lieut. G. H. Peters, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, iu April, who with that vessel verified the notes previously taken, and took additjoual notes in Chesapeake Bay and trihntaries for tlle compilation of a Coast Pilot of those waters. In June Lieutenant Peters was relieved by Lieut. F. S. Carter, U.S. N., and tlirected to assume his regular duties in the office. Tbe Arago was th ell sent to New York and put in condition for wol'k in Loug Island Sound. The schooner Drift was employed during the summer nnd fall, under the command of Lieut. F. S. Carter, U.S. N., Assistant Coast aud Geodetic Survey, in making a series of current obsen·atious in New York Bay and Harbor. In November the vessel wl\s sent to tlle Navy-Yard for the wiuter, arnl in .January Lieutena.nt Carter was detached and ordered to the Gedney. The steamer Daisy, a small tug transferred to this office by the Light-House Board, was employed as a tender to the field parties in New York Harbor, and was of great assistance i11 the work at the entrance to New York. During the summer of 1884 the schooner Scoresby was in charge of a ch·illan party enga{.t'ed in makiug current observations in New York Bay and Harbor, and was afterwards laid up at the Nav~'-Y11rd, New York. During part of August the rcgul;ir h,\·drographic work wa8 suspended hy all the 11arties working in that vicinity and simultaneous current obst1rvations were made (Jll Sandy Hook Bar. In March a party was organized on boanl the Scoresby, under the command of Lit>ut. Frauds ~~inslow, U. S. N., .Assistant Coast aull Geodetic Survey, and commenced work in Core Souml, Nortll Carolina, making special examinat.iom; with reference to the location of oyster-beds in tllat vicinity.
HYDROGRAPIIY-P .ACIFIC COAST.

Tile steamer Patterson, under command of Lieut. llichardsou Clover, U.S. X., Aio;sh;tant Coast and Geodetic Surwy, continuecl the snrYey of Southeast Alaska, commenced during the spring of 1885. Lieutenant Clo,·er extended his work to Point Lemesurier, in Clarence Strait, befor(· it became necessary to return to San Francisco, where tlle Patterson arrh·ed October 15, 1885. In March, 1886, Lieutenant Clover was detached from the S11rvPy at his owu request. He had inspected the building of the Patterson and after her completion hacl command of her 011 the passage around to Sau Fraucisco, where she was fitted for work in Alaska. The results of the season's work, referred to above, wert: so satisfactory that it was with much regret that.this office lost the valuable services of so compete11t an officer. His surYey, 11ow published, bas received the commendation of all wllo hM·e seen it aml wlio are acquainted wit It the locality. ·To show bow rapid]~· tlle Alaska work has been puslled, I will state that I1i<>ntPuant Clover completed urn miles of the shore-line during the sliort st·nson iu which work eau be

economically carried on in these watern. Fort be al'curacy of tbe work I refer to the records aud to the chart already published. After considerable deliberation as to the best method of continniIJg this important snr...-ey, I recommended in January last that two Yei:sels lJe sent to carr,'I" on tl1e work, on tbe appropriation allowed for one party. To accompJii.;h this it was necessary to lie very economical in fittiug out the expetlition. This was succe»sfnlly accomplished, and although the results have been vers gratifying, it is to be regretted that the small appropriation 1886-'87 rendered it necessary to recall the parties before the end of the season. The vessels tlctailed for the work were the Patterson, Lieut. Commander A. S. Snow, U.S. N., commanding, and the Mc.Arthur, Lieut. J. l\L Ilel111, U. S. N., commauding-, tlrn combined party being under the direction of the former officer. Lieuteuant-Uommamln Snow report:-<, September, ISSG, tlrnt be has during the preseut season, with the combined party under bis charge, eomplete1l l,GOO miles of shore-line, leaving uncom' pleted in Southeast Alaska abont 4,500 miles. · Tim snn·es of tlrn Ala;.;kan coast and waten; is oue of the most important works now remaining for the Coast Survey. ~Witll a vieq· of completing the ;.;urvey of tlie principal thoroughfares now used as rapidly m; possible, the work is carried on with the intention of obtaining data for the construction of chal'ts for the use of the navigator, showing harbors, anchorages, an accurate shore-line, and such topographical features as are of use to him. This sun·ey is carried on untler many ad verse circumstances. The density oft he forestis, which are almost impenetrable, renders it impossible for observers to occupy the mon ntain peaks with· out great delay; the precipitouR shores, thickly wooded to the high-water IUark, make the building of signals very difficult; while fogs and almost conRtant rains, with beav;y gales, constitute a yet more serious obstacle to progress. J,ieuteuan t-Commander Snow writes, nuder date of' June 11, 1886, that in twenty-nine consecutive days there was not oue on which rain did not fall. The naval parties on board the Patterson and the .McArthur have continued the system of triangulation from a measured 1.Jm'le, checking with astronomical statious,aud have carried ou aii tlJC work of triangulation, topography, and hydrography. '.l'he steamer l\fcArthur, nuder the commaml of' Lieut. E. D. Tiwssig, CT. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic SuHey, was employed in continuing the hytlrography ou the coast of Oalifomia south of Cape ::\Iendocino. The shores in this vicinity are rocky and abrupt, the country is but sparsely settled, with no tlefiued roads and only here and there a chute for a landing, and add to this the fogs, tbe prevailing 11eavy swell and oeea;o;ional severe gales, without any harbor of refuge, and sou haYe some idea of tl1e difficulties under whicll this work was accomplished. Great credit ii:; due to Lieutenant Taussig who overcame the many obstacles that were continuall.r presented. This party returned to San J;iraucisco during the latter pitrt of November, and in February Lieutenant Taussig relieve<1 Lieutenant-Commander Snow of tbe conlIIland of the H<1ssler, an<l f,ieiit. .·T. ::\I. Helm, CT. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Snn-ey, assmned command of the l\IcArthur. '.l'liis party prepared for work, aml in April 8ailed for Southeast Alaska, "lfliere, in conjunetion witll the steamer Patterson, already referretl to, the party continnetl the triangulation, topography, an<l hydrography of the inland waters. The steamer Hassler, nuder tlle command of Lieut. Commander A. S. Suow, U.S. N., Assi8tant Coast and GeodeUc Surrn.v, sailed eat'ly in August for Departure Bay, when, after coaling, she proceeded in the execution of the wol'k assigued her, viz, off.shore hy<lrograpby seuth of' Columbia Rh-er, Oregon, examination of the channels into and iu Tillamook Bay, h.ydrognqihy of \Valker Island Bar and Tongue Point Bar, Columbia Hiver. 1'he 11arty was delayed by galei,;, rain, antl ;;moke, and owing to the continuous bad weather was u uable to connect tbe outside steamer lines witlt tne shore. The vessel returned to San I<'ranci8co in November, and after Lieutenant 'raussig ai,;f!nmed command, in February, the party was pr(·paretl to complete the work 011 the coast of Californht son th of Cape ~Ieudocino.

\'igor, and on June 18 the party arri>ed in San Francisco, having finished this most difficult piece of work. The schooner Earnest, under the command of Lieut. Charles T. Forse, U. S. :N"., Assi.stant Coast and Geodetic Survey~ was engageq in the survey of Puget Sound. The party anived in tlic field early in the season, and at once commenced active operations. The h;rdrography of Hood's Canal and Port Orchard was finished hefore the pa.rt,y returned from the field, which was not until December 8, after the weather became too severe for active field operations. Early in April, the part~· w:rn again in the field engaged in the hydrography of Admiralty Inlet and Port Townsend, botli of wliich were finished by the latter part of June, when the vessel left for I'ossession Sonrnl. The chief obstacle to contend with in the prosecution of tue work in Puget Soun<l is smoke. The yearly extensiYe forest fires envelop the whole country in a cloud of smoke, RO that for scYcrn l ~eeks at a time it is impossible to carry on any field-work. The steamer Hitchcock and schooner Quick in the Gulf. tbe harge Beauty on the Atlantic coa;;t, and the schooner Yukon and sloop Kincheloe on the Pacific coast, were usPd by ei\·il assistants. The H_ydrographic Division has hee11 under the charge of Lieut. J. F. Moser, U.S. N., Assh-itin1t Coast and Geodetic Survey, and to his great care and untiring energ_y we are mainly indebted for the accuracy of our charts, particularl_y in regard to changes since their issue. The co-operation or the Light-House Board, through its Nasal Secretary, Commander H. F. Picking, U. S. ~.,is SQ tliorough, that all changes made under the direction of the Board are immediately indicated on our charts. By recent arrangement with the Ollief of Engineers, U. S. Army, we hope iu the future to be able to profit by the numerous hydrographic surve.rs carried on hy that i<ervice iu connection with harhor imprornments. In December I recommended to you that a scheme prepared hy Lieut. J. F. l\Ioser, U.S. N., for a quarterly issue of a" Notice to 1\lariners" lie carried out, and on 1\Iarch 31 the first of this series was issued. This notice is intended to contain in a brief space all the important changes that have been made on any chart since the preceding notice. Tllese changes include not only 11ew dangers, but also important chauges in lmoyage, new lights, &c.; in fact any adtlitiou or eorn·ctiou to the chart that would make it more perfect and be of interest to the navigator. These 1nt1ct·s are also sent to the chart sales agents, so that they can have an op1~ortunity of correcting charts 011 hand, or at least distributing them with charts sold. In >icw of the fact that they sPem to lw sen-fog a very good purpose, I lrnve t() sugg-est that after January 1, 1887, the8e notices he is:rnetl monthly. It is not intended that they should take the place of the special notices issued \\'lieu important dangers are discovered or developed. The work in the draughting-room of the H;ydrogra.pbic Di\·isiou of this office was most sntisfactorily irnrformed hy l\lessrs. E. ·wmenbucher, "\V. C. Willeubucher, and I<'. U. Donn. A talmlated statement appended will show for itself the zeal displayed by tliese gentlemen. The general supervision of the work on the Atlantic Coast Pilot having been assigucd to the Hydrographic Inspector, with your approval I detailed for this duty and placed in imnwdiate charge of it at the beginuing of the fiscal _year Lieut. George II. Peters, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, who had at an earlier period ser>ecl one tour of dnty on the SnrYey. In August and September field-work on the New England coast was carried on for pnq>oses of verification and revision, inclurling special hydrograpbic examinations \\'here necessarr. Dming the winter, office duties were performed in the revision of tlie volumes alread~- in print and in noting the necessary corrections to bring up to date manuscript already prepared but not ,Yet priuted, as well as in the preparation of new matter. The current editions of a unmber of volumes of the Atlantic Local Coast Pilot being nearly exhausted, the publication of new editions in such eases bas been kept in view iu carrying on the re\·ision. The changes required to bring the text up to date are many, involving much lauor in which great care and accuracy are necessary. A 11ew (tliird) edition of Subdivision 13, which iucludes the south coast of Loug Island, New York Bay and Harbor, and the Hudson River, is in the hands of the printers and will soon IJe issued; 11ew editions of others are in an advanced state of preparation and will soon be read_y for the printer. Lieutenant Peters again took up field-work early in April, taking charge of the steamer Arago for the collection of data in Chesapeake Bay and tributaries, iu "'hich work he was engaged nntil the middle of June, then returning to the office and resuming duties here. In the latt('r part of

144

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODET10 SURVEY.

November, 1885, Mr. John B. Goode, jr., was designated to assist in the Coast Pilot work, au<l performed the cleric:1l and other duties assigned him most efficientl_y up the time of hi!'> resignation in August, 1886. It is proposed to suspend, for tlie present at least, t11e 1mblication of the large volumes of tlie Atlantic Coast Pilot, two of which, Yiz, Division A, Eastport to Boston, and Division B, Boston to New York, ha,·e already been issned. 'fo meet local· wants, the Atlantic Local Coast Pilot: issued in subdivil;ions, each comprising a limitt'd portion of the coast, may well be continued; a yolume of this series, treating of Chesapeake Bay and tributaries, and others, coYering the coast to the southward of' Savannah, are now in hand, the coast from Cape Heury to Savanuah beiug inclmled in subdh·isiom; 19 and 20, already issued. The demand for the J,oca.l Coast Pilot is sufficient to mdicate that it supplies a spPcial want, lJut its bulk and its minuteness of detail render it unsuitable for general me. l·'or this pt1rpo8e a Coast Pilot should be prepared which should include the entire Atlantic coast iu oue \'Olunw. Our naYal vessels now have to lle supplied with a general work of this nature, issnrd hy a private firm; wliile this is a useful publication, it does not apr>ear to meet their needs fully. For the general treatment of the Atlantic coast, a method invoking new features has been devised Ly Lieutenant Peters. Sample pages illustrating the pro1)01;ed method lun-e recently beeu 1iri11trd, with your a11prova1, to facilitate proper distribution for the purpose of eliciting such criticism and discu8sion as will tend to enhance the usefulness of' the project. The general CO]](lition of' the hulls, engines, boilers, &c., of' the vessels of the Surrny at t1ie end of the year was good, with a few exceptious, wbieh will be noted. The serYice on which \·essels in the Surve;y are engaged is Yery severe on their boilers, at · tiiues going for mouths witliont hauling fires. 'fhose of the steamer Gedney, after over ten years' ui:;c, were in such condition tliat it was decided best to put in new ones. Bids were accordingly asl,ed for, and on the 28th of ,June the contract was awarded to Messrs. Speddeu & l\foCiymont, of Baltimore, Md., for $2,!MO. While the boilers are out of the vessel it is proposed to gi\'e her a general overbauliug, it liaviug been ascertained that many of her fastenings are in a very bad conditiou. 'fhe GedneJ- is a composite vessel, and her fastenings are of iron. Recent iuvestigatio11 ~l1ows that man~· of them are entirely eaten away by galvanic action, and it is proposed to n'phwe tlwm. A new ~team windlass was placed in the Gedney in December last, which adds much to the C'flieic1wy of that \'essel. In .Tune arrangements were made for the building, at the Washington Navy-Yard, of two large steam lam1cl1t>s. These boats when completed will be a very valuable a1lditiou to the Survey. The Arago'H decks have given considerable trouble. being too old and loose to be properlr calked. The question whether she is in proper condition to warrant 1rnttiug in :vew decks aud deckbom·es will have to be considered this Jear. She is of' much service to tlie Surrny, being com para· tiYt>ly inexpensiYe to maintain, and her light draught enables her to work in our inland sounds. 'l'he schooner ::\Iatchless, which was turned over to the SnrVeJ· in July, 1885, by the Quartermaster's Department, IT. S. Arm~·, will reqnin·, iu order to place he1· in proper condition for use, a thorough remodeling of bn interior arrangements, when she will pro\·e a very valuable addition to our vessels. During the winter the repairs were made to the wssels at New York by the reduced crewR of those veRsels. 'These repairs included ship carpcntc1·'is, joiner'"· sail-maker's, and machinist's work, a111l the result was that when the vesselH were required for serYice in the spring the amount of rnoIH'Y expended for repairs was very small, beiug confined principally to skilled labor of a c~ass 1iot easily fouud among a ship's crew, such as cop1wrnmith's and plum lier's work. On the 1st day of March I had the houor ton connneml tlrnt the schooners Baclte and I~esearch he i:;olll, as their condition was such as to render it not ad\·h,able to put them in condition for use. The schooner Silliman could properly ha,·e been brougl1t nuder the same head, but ·although unfit for farther use as a sun·e;viug Yessel, she was still of great sen·ice aH a store-ship for Coast Sur\"ey propertJ' at the New York :Navy-Yard. 'l'hc tenders for the schoonPI" llache wNc so ~mall tl1at it was decided not to accept any of ti.tern, and she waH, on application, turned onr the llureau of Ordnance, Navy Department. Tlit> Re8l·nrch was sold at J~emmcola, Fla., to the highest bidder for $'.!27.

The steam launch Lively, now engaged in the Alaska survc:y, has been almost constantl;r in use for twelve years, and is nQw in such condition as to render it questionable as to the propriety of repairing her. A recent survey by a board of officers shows that she will require \er.v extensi·e repairs, both to hull and to engines and boiler. It will probabl;r be more economical to replace her by a new launch. From the rather in<le:fiuitc information that can be obtained, it seems to be necessar:y to make extensive repairs to the bull of the steamer Barataria, now laid up at Gretna, La. The steamer Hitchcock, laid up at the same place, also requires considerable work on both hull and engines. In March Mr. Wyvill, who had served faithfully for nearly four J·ears in this office, was promoted to a position in the Drawing Division, an<I-his place has since been filled to my satisfaction by Mr. George J. Yestner. I forward herewith tabulated statements of officers serving on the Suney, work done in field and office, &c. Very respectfully, W. H. BROWNSON, Litutcnant-Oommandcr, r. 8. ]r,·., Hvdrograpliic Inspector. Mr. F. M. THORN, Superintendent U. /:3. Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey.

AN EXAMINATION OF smrn OF THE EARLY VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATIO.'.\ ON THE NORTHWEST COAST OF AMERICA, FRml 1·339 TO 1603.
By P1'of: GF_;ORG-E
DAv~IDSON,

INTRODUCTION.

During my work Oil the Pacific coast of the United States siuce the spring of 1850 I becawe deeply interested in the discoveries and explorations of tile early Spanish navig-at0rs who ha<l followed the coast from Cape San Lucas to Alaska. Part of m~· duty consisted in the determiuation of the latitude and longitude of the headlands, islands, rockR, harbors, rirnrs, &c., and in ti.HJ geographical reconnaissance of the shores fro:n the Mexican boundary to .the fort~·-nintli parallel. While in command of the surveying brig R.H. Fauntleroy, I entered (in addition to my regular duties) upon the self.impose<l task of writing a Coast Pilot for California, Oregon, and Wasltington Territory, and I ha>e nearly completed the fourth euitioll of that work. Very naturally, my early interest in the old explorations became intensified, and I made many special examinations of the 11arratives and their application to supposed localities. I think I ham been able to reconcile many of the discrepancies of tile old "Spanish, English, American, and French navigators. Their inaccuracies arm·e principally from "constant" errors of their instrumeuts, ignorance of the coast currents, errors of judgment in e<'timating distances, &c. Among the Spanish discoverers, the meagerness of <letailed uescriptious, a faihire to seize the salient points for the determining of their positions, the want of minute accuracy in most of' their plans~some· times giving weight to.general features an<l sometimes to details without distinction-and a kaning to exaggerate certain discoveries and to com1iletely overlook others, ltarn much inrnh-ed the locating of many of. their landfalls, headlands, monntaim;, and streams. The minuteness of record in Cook and Vancouver, of comparatfrely recent date, has enabled me to follow their tracks day by day and to correct their positions by personal .knowledg(~ of the localities uescribed; bnt whilst giving these great men the fullest credit for surveys unparalleled before or since (wbeu all the attendant circumstances are considered), I cannot withhold my admiratioll for the iudomita· ble courage and perseverance of the old Spanish navigators, who, in small, ill-conditioned, and illsupplied vessels, with crews nearly destroyed by scurvy, fought their way to the wildest parts of the Alaskan coast almost regardless of season. "There were giants in the earth in those days." The records of such of these voyages as are published are too short to be of much more value than isolated statements of what was done; and the inaccuracy of the observations for the determination of the geographical positions has led many to judge that all were touched witll the spirit of Maldonado, de Fonte, and de Fuca. But witli the present knowledge of our coast it is possilJle to locate Ulloa; to track Cabrillo and Ferrelo in their discoveries in mid-winter; to 11lace Drake under Cape Ferrelo and Point Reyes, and to fix with certaint;r the most of_ Vizcaluo'.-. positions. Later than 1603 I ha\e not undertaken identification ill this paper, except to incident· ally mention Father Taraval's visit to Point Engenio, and his lauding upon Natividad and Cerros
lf>:J

U1'\ITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURYEY.

Island;;;. I was particularly interestetl in the ,·oyages of Cahrillo and Ferrelo, and I ham emlea\·ored to pnt myself in their places; and understanding the seasons and the difficulties they enconntered, I have tried to follow them day by day in their exciting discoveries. I ha Ye basell my narrati>e of Cabrillo upon the comlensetl aml unsatisfying chapte1 s in Herrera (B), and have correcteil se,·eral mistakes and deciphered one OL' two ohscurc passages. Of the narratirn supposed to embrace the whole voyage of C,tl>rillo and Ferrelo, I have freely used the translation made by Mr. Richard Stuart !:<~vans as printed with introductory remarks by l\Ir. H ....\V. Henshaw (H), but in critical passages where important issues were involved I have examined the original (C) and made my own translations. Of the Yoyage of Ulloa, I liani ball recourse to the short narrative gi"rnn in Burney and tra11sJate<l from (A). Of the \'oyagc by Drake, I haYe collated from the "English Hero" (D), and the '"Vorld Encompassed'' (E), with refrreuce to the Portus K ovrn Albion is in the margin of Hondius' map; · and to this map I !Jave reduced the Coast Survey chart of the vicinit~· of Drake's Bay to correspond iu ecale and in orientation, whereby I have identified his bay. In the voyage of Vizcaino I first trusted to foe English translation of Venegas' narrative, but I fonnd it so uncertain in critical positions that I bad recourse to the original (F); and I have usedYizcalno's chart of the coast exhibited in Burney, Part II of his series cf volumes of Voyages aud Dh;coveries (G). For details of some of the points and anchorages south of Todos Santos Bay I have used the Coast Surn1 y charts of 1874 and the descriptions of the "West Coast of Mexico, from the Northern Boundary," published b;\' the Hydrographic Bureau of the United States Navy (I). To preserve accuracy and consistency of description on the coast north of Mexico, I have referred to the manuscript of the fourth edition of the '' Coast Pilot of California, Oregon, and \Vasbington" (J), and constantly to the charts of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. The full titles of these authorities are appended to this introduction with the reference letters. In order to present as clearly as practicable the descriptions of localities by the different uavigators, I have drawn them up in three parallel columns, preserving in the case of Cabrillo and Ferrelo the whole of their narratives. l\Iy notes and remarks have been l)laced in another column. At tbe close I have added a condensed tabular statement of the names and positions of the seventy places mentioned b~y Cabrillo and Ferrelo and which I have identified. In the narratives I have occasionally added a note or condensed statement in brackets l ]. Jn regard to the name "California," I extract the following note from the California Coa"t Pilot already referred to: "The name California is first found in the worthless romance' Las Sergas of Esplandian, the son of Amadis of Gaul, written by Garcia Ardonez de Montah-o, the translator of the Amadis. IL was first printed in 1510, with editions in 1519, 1521, 1525, 1526(two),157_5, 1587, and the recent reprint of 1857.·, "The name appears in Reveral passages, of which the following are given: '·'Know that, on the right hand of the Indies, very near to the Terrestrial Paradise, there is an island called California~ which was peopled with black women, without any men among them, because they were accustomed to live after the fashion of Amazons. '' 'In this island called California are many Griffins, on account of the great savageness of the country and the immense quantity of wild game found there. "'Now in the time that those great men of the Pagans sailed (again~t Constantinopll') witli those great fleets of which I have told you, there reigned in this laud of Califc-rnia a Queen, larg-e of body, very beautiful, in the J>rime of her years, &c. "'The name California next occurs in the memoirs of the Conquistador, Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who served with Cortes in the conquest of Mexico. He writes that "Cortes again set Rail from Santa Uruz and discovered the coast of California." Here Cortes remained for some tinw, disheartened at the want of success of his various.expeditious. The rieeroy, Mendoza, dispatche<l

But the northwest wind blew so >iolently, and the air was so coltl, that the squadron was obliged to run close in wit.h the land, and on the sixteenth they were under some lofty black mountains, on the top of which wern l:i.rge plains.

Here they were again overtaken by a most violent, gale from tho northwest, with thiek weather, an1l agaiu lost sight of each other (p. 72). The reason for the nRnal violence of the 1Viud at thi" Cape, called del Eugafio, is that tho air is there contracted betwixt the cape aml the island of Cen1za, which lies about eigl1t leagues distant along the mainland to the west-northwest of Cape Engafio (p. 73), and this island is divided in the middle, forming two steep, lofty, ronnd mountains of equal height.

To the northward the trend of the shora is north-northwest, ancl to the southward sontbeast by cast.

The present absence of wood may have resulted from fire spreading over the islet. Torquemada is apparently confused about the Island of Cenizas aud the Island of San Ger6nimo, as if they were two distinct islatH1s, and ht\ even mentions th:· characteristics of each. The explanation is this: The Almiranta, after her separation from the fleet, searched for the Capitano. by going as far back as Cerros Island, and then, not wishing to be again obstructed, made a long tack to seaward (p. 79), whe11 she saw Guadalupe Island, which she named the Isla de Paxaros, and from this position she tacked inshore, making the landfall north of San Hilario Island (San Martin Island), which t,hey saw and miscalled the Islan<l of Ccnizas (p. 89); thence sbe sailed in search of the Capitana, and when near tho Bay of the Virgins she saw the Capitana and Fraga ta sailing out. This islet, as we shall soon see, is also <loul.Jle headed. Moreover, it is evident that tbefleethad pr(JVious knowledge of sowe island described ae Cenizas (cinders, lava), l.Jecause on their p!W!sage to the northward they left Cemis Islaml to search for it. This knowledge they i·mst have derived from the voyages of Ulloa and Calirillo, and the description may possibly have referred to Natividad nnd Cerros Islands.

The coast of the maiulaml runs north-nort.hwest and south-southeast, and is a clean coast. The land within is of very good appearance and level, and there are good valleys and some trees, and the rest is baro. They did not find these days a sign of Inclians.

''The Island" is the low sandy, cbaparr al-covered penini>ula, formingtbe west shore of the bay arnl cromling so close to Ballast Point under Punta de ht Loma as tJ form the deep narrow channel between tbl1 bay and the sea. It is not over six feet above the IPYd of the sea, an<l in 18;>0 was locally known as "The Islarnl," antl now known as the ''Peninsula." Next fo that of San Francisco, no harbor on the Pacific coast of the United States apllroaches in excellence the Bay of San Diego. It is readily distinguished by the notable landmark of Point Loma, in latitude 3:2° 3!J', is easily a.pproached on account of the absence of outlying dangers, and a depth of twenty· two feet of water can !Jc ca'rried over the bar. Thi> !Jar has not changed in deptl· or position since t11e time of Vanconver. Vessels approaching San Diego Ilay make the ridge of Point Loma as a long fl'1t-topped falaud, wbeu alJout twenty-five miles distant. This appearance is occasioned lly the bay to the south west, liy the low land to the northeast, aud by the Puerto Falso at the north. The bay is a long ctirdng hod.Y of water about twelve miles in lengtl1, n.ml from one-halt' to tea miles in width. For tlm first six or seven miles from tho entrance there is a fine \;road channel, carry in;.( four to eight fathoms of water. The southern en!l of the bay is occnpictl \Jy Yery extensive flats, throngll which a channel with twenty to twelve feet of water is found.

As Vizcaino gives a graphic description of his passage through the Santa Barbara Channel, we interrupt· Ferrelo's narrative to condense it. The Island~ of the Santa Barbara Channel. To tho liroad passage between the mainland from Point Hueneme to Point Concepcion all(l tho islands from Anacapa to San .Miguel, Vizcaino (p. 95) gives the name El Canal de Santa Barbara. He is the first to call attention to the parallelism of these islands with the continental 8hore. This channel is sixty-five miles long nearly east. ancl we8t, ancl ranges from eleven to t'venty-six miles in breadth. His statement that tbere arc six islands in this channel must include the islands which he n:imed San :Nicolas and Santa llarbara, and which are laid down by him half way between Santa Catalina Island and Anaca.pa. His chart gives a very fair representation of the archipelago and its relation to the mainlantl. This archipelago is now known as the Santa Barbara Islantls, aml embraces all of them from San :Mignel to San Nicolas ai,<l San Clemente.

Cabrillo's vessels left Buenaventura and reached the "lUncon," latitncle 34° 2-2', four leagues west of San Bnenanmtnra. This coast is borderecl by high and steep mountains, the water is alkali, and it was doul1tless bnt spa.rs<·ly inhabited.

This- is the largest and best harbor around the Island of Sau Miguel. Hi~ a rnoderatt'ly large bay on the northeast face. Its extent is a little more than one mile b11_ tween the eastern and the ;vesle1n heads, and abont twothirds of a mile deep. It has uold shores and approaches, and a large rocky blet balf a mile north of the eastern bead. This islet is five burntre(l yards in extent and 303 feet high, with a precipitous face to the north-northwest. Across the mouth of the harl.wr stretches a dense field of kelp having six fathoms of water throughout the greater part of it, but marked lJy two reefs and rocks near the middle, and almost in line between the heads. There are other ro<'ky patches in the eastern part of the harbor. Ycssels coming into the harbor from the northwest pass within half a mile ofthe western heacl, through the kelp, at a distance of only three hundred ;yards from the cliffs, and then haul towards the western bight of the bay, where they anchor in five fathoms of water, o;·er hard bottom, but protected from all sa1·e the north and east winds, which rartly blow. The heavy swell from the stroug northw<!St winds reaches well into the anchorage. (Seep. 236.) Vessels cannot easily enter by the eastern passage unless familiar with the dange:s aud currents. Water is found at one place on the steep southern bill face, and during winter water drains down the gully at the western part of the long beach southeast from the anchorage. The summit of the island lies only a mile southward of the anchorage, and is about seven hundred feet above the sea. It is in latitude :J4° 0'2'. There is not much vegetation upon the island, aml the south and western part is swept by sand driving from the ocean beach. The evidences are very strong of there having beeu a very large Indian population on this island, and doubtless the fishing was good among the kelp-fields and rocky patches off the west and northwest parts of the island.

They may have been in tLe broatl bight between Point Concepcion an<l Point Arguello.

This day they advanced little, as ihe wind was not fa. vqrable; and in the middle of the following night they had a wind, south-southwest and west-southwest, with rain, so that they BaW themselves in difficulty, for it was an on-shore wind and t~y were near the land, and they could not double the cape on one tack or t.be other; and the following Thursday at vespers the wind veered to the south, aml they proceeded on tlu·;r conrse t.en leagues to 11

The North Farallones is a group of four smaller islets and low rocks gathered together in a somewhat compact body. The four principal islet.. are high, barren, and almnst, inacces~ible. The highest rises to an elevation of 158 feet. The group lies six and three-fifths miles northwest by west from the Sontheast Farallon, and twelve miles south-southwest from the \..Osteru extremity of Point Reyes Head. The depth of water around these iolands iR thirty fathoms 1 and the same continues well in towards the shore sotbaL i t is somewhat st,range that Cabrillo, Ferrelo, and Vizca)ao did not go inside oft hem; they could no.t have been coasting very closely along the main shore. Prequently these islets are hidden by tho fogs even when the shores are fairl.v free aml visible.

This is Cnyler's Harbor in l:ititudc 34c 03', already dcscrilled. (Seep. 236.) While wintering in this hla de Posesion, on the third day of January, 1543, depa.ted from this present life Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, Captain of the said ships, from a fall which he had on the same island at the former time when they were there, by which he broke an arm near the shciulder. He left for Captain the Chief Pilot, who wus one Bartolome Ferrelo, a nath-e of the Levant; and he charged them much at the time of his death that they should not give up the discovery, as far as possible, of all that coast. They named the island La Isla de Juan Rotlrignez. The Indians call this island Ciqnimnymn, and anot.her they call Nicalqne, and the other they call Limn. In this islantl de la Posesion, there are two villages; the one is called Zaco (10) and the other N imollollo. On one of the other islands there are three villages; one they call Niehochi, and another Coycoy, and the other Estoooloco. On the other island there are eight, villages, which are, Miquesesquelna, Poele, Pisqucno, Pualnacatnp, Patiqnin, Patiqnilid, Niuumn, Muoc, Pilidquay, Lilibeqne. The Intlians of tllese islands are very poor. They are fishermeu; they eat nothing but fish; they sleep on the ground; all their 1.msiness and employment is to fish. In each house they say there are fifty souls. They live very swinishly; they go naked. They were in these islands rrom the twenty-third of November to the nineteenth of .January. In all this time, which was almost two months, there were very hard wintry storms on the land and the sea. The winrls which prevailed most were west-southwest and south-southwest and west-northwest. The weather was very tempestnous. Friday, the nineteenth day of the month of January, 1543, they set sail from the island of Juan Rodriguez, which is callecl Ciquimaymu by the natives, to go to the mainland in search of some supplies of provjsions for their voyage, and in leaving the port a. heavy storm from the west-northwest struck them, which made them put into th<' other islands of Sa.n Laca..s, and they anchored off the island of Limuu, to which they gave the name of Sau Salvador, and they fonnd it necossary_to weigh anchor again because it had no port more under the shelter of 1he islands, and the wind veerecl around from all 1.eiuts, and they sailed around these islands eight days with the wind very foul, sheltering themselves under the islands from the bad weather; and on the twenty-seventh of the saicl month they entered the same port of the island of Juan Rodrignez where they were before. The greatest hindrance they had was because tbe winds were not st··acly, bnt went veering about from one point to another.

and because they did not find any port,, they had to go to la. Isla de la Posesion, which is one of the Islands of San Lucas, and they entered there Thursday, on the twentythird of November, and because it is a good port, they repaired the small vessel, and made her staunch, as she . was going to sink.

In the aforesaid port they remained, until the eud of December, on aoconnt of the bad weather, with great cold and snow, even to the sea level, rain from heaven, and heavy clouds; and as the south.-ast storm was continuing, there was so great a surf, although in a laudlockecl harbor, that aometimes for three and four day~, it was not possible to go on shore.

They departed frolll this island of Sau Lucas 1fo11da~·, the twelfth day_ of the month of J<'cbruary, which they could not do sooner on account of the bad weather, whicl1 gave them winds aml much snow. It is inhabited, and the people are like those uf thlJ otl1er island. The Indians call it Nicalque. There are three villages on it, which arc called Nicochi, Coycoy, Coloco. This day they went to Puerto de las Sardinas, to take in wood and other things necessary for their voyage, as they were not to be obtained on those islands. 'Wednesday, on the fourteenth of thu said mo11th, they departed from El Puerto de Sardinas, having taken a "boat-load of wood, an<l they did not dare to remain longet· there on account of the great swell of the ocean ; they did not find so many Indians as before, nor any fishing on account of the winter; the natives eat oak acorns ancl other seeds and herbs of the field without cooking. From this place they proceeded to the islancl of San Salvador, becan~ they were there more secure from thll storms, that they might be able to make sail and run out to sea. Sunday, the eighteen th <lay of the said mouth of FeLrnary, they departed from the island of San Salvador with a moderate wind from northeast, a11d they ran along to the southwest, because the_y hatl been told that thero were other islands toward the south west ; thc_y were at dusk this day abont. twelve leagues from tlrn islanc1 of San Salvador, ancl they saw six islancts, some large am\ othe;s small.

He could not han. seen San Clemente Island; Anacapa is small; and Santa Catalina would, at that distance, appear small. San Nicolas would be seen moderately small, because he would make it endwise.

The description aud the position of the cape in relation to the foregoing mountains are good for Cape Mendocino, hut I think the latitude ho gives is merely a report, for they do not appear to have observed the sun, and his chart places it in 4P 40'. The high mountains, rising to an elevation of 3,400 feet behind the cape, might well be covered with snow if the winter wa3 se>erc, as we may a.ssume it was from the narrative.

"The day following, which reckons itl!elfthe thirteenth of January, a southeast wind came up with the greatest fury, and witl1 it a fine sleet that appeared like snow. This wind rais6d such a tremendous sea, that every moment it appeared as if the ship must founder and all be lost; and to avoid its fury, and not to reach a higher latitude, because they feared the excessive cold and the increased violence of the atonns in the higher latitudes, aml it being the depth of wint-er, it was deemp,d the best to lay to until the wiud was favorable and thf'n make sail for Acapulco. ~ · · "With this decision came a little strength to mi:i~ate the snJl'erings of the people, for they now thought the~· V\Ouhl be able to hold ont Eomc tlays longer than if tlH'Y went farther north.

Vizcalno does not state positively that this cape is in his observed latitude of 42", which, by the way, is the only latitude he mentions in his narrative. His chart lays down a cape of white cliJfo in 41° 40', where he places Cape Mendocino. There are the white cliffs of the Gold Blnffil in 41° 25', and the notable white sand dunes just north of Mack's Arch. These sand dunes are three miles in length and rise to 170 feet elevation and are a marked feature in the shore line. They lie in fatitude 42° 14' and the verdure-clad mountains behind them rise to 1,500 foot and are pine covered on the upper slopes and crest line. In latitude 42° 05' the Coast Snr'l"ey has named a bold headland, seen from Pelican Bay, Cape Ferrelo, and in latitude 42° 18' a second notable head has been namt-d Cape Sebastian, but without other intention than commemorating these names.
''A Bad bay," Drake 4.?". Chetko Ba;I', latitude 420 Ol'. This is an open roadstead exposed to the full force of the southerly swell. It is at the southern termination of fifty miles of high rugged coast coming .from Port Orford to the Chetko River. Iu striking the coast Drake could find no anchorage between Point Orford and this 11Iace, and none other near this except Crescent City Harbor, seventeen miles southward, and which he would hardly approach when the dangerous Dragon Rocks or St. George's Reef gnarded the shore. Chetko anchorage is but slightly protecte<l even from the northwest swell by the long rounding head of Cape Ferrclo, five or six miles to the west-northwest. The shore line to the westward is bound by rocks, and there are several sunken rocks with breaks upon them in the anchorage. 'Ve know from exper'.ence that it is not a comfortable anchorage; and it may very well be accepte<l as the anchoring place of Drake in latitude 42°.

In their demoralizeu condition they were auxions to get ~helter, au1l the first object they conld find would be the Hedding Relck in latitude 4 to 22', only fi l'C miles off a nearly straight coast-line. It is only eighty-three feet high and of limited extent, but sufficient to give a lee for such a small vessel; moreover it is evident that the storm was not very severe. This protection was his only r<'fuge, and his reference to Cape Mendocino was merely to the nearest known lamlfall.

Cape Orford, or Cape Blanco, in latitude 42° 51 1 · North of thia latitude the coast· does not run to the northwest; on the contrn.ry it trends nearly north (magnetic). Yet we may suppose that in running-along the coast and making the cape with the northwest wind with its dangerous reef before him he fell ha.ck upon bis instructions to return. This cape has a water-worn face that shows whitish in the afiernoon snn, but thoro is no river near it which be would dare to enter. In May, 1886, the cliffs around Cape Orford were mostly covered with verdure, autl only small spaces showetl whitish. Taking his narrative as accnratcly descriptive, we may assume that his Caho Blanco was the white sand dune line (just. south of Cape Sebastian) i11 latitnde 42° 14', anfl already describeu. Hence the coast runs to the wost cf north to Capo Orford. After passing these bright dunes and keeping the coast-line moderately close aboard he would open tho well marketl valley of the Rogue River in latituuo 420 25'. This stream has a tolerably wide mouth and has heen entered by vc'!scls; but the current is very strong and there i> a short breaking liar off tho entrance; while outside of it there is a very dangeronH reef which he would certa,inly avuiu. The Chetko River and Smith's Ri\"er are in the deep I.light of Pelican Bayunder420, and he woultl hardly have rnn in there from around the Dragon Rocks. The Cbetko month is closed by a gravel barrier in dry seasons. On the 28th of February, 1543, they were out of sight of land, and probably in latitude 411°, allowing a correction of one and a half degrees to his reported latitude. Tho \Ycdnesday following, the twenty.ejgbth day of the saiu mouth, at daybreak, the wind shifted directly to tl:ie southwest, and it ditl not blow hard. This day they observed the latitude in forty-three degrees. Towards night the wind freshened and shifted to the south-southwest. They ran this night to the w'est-northwest with much difficulty, and Thursday at daybreak the wind llhifteu to the southwest with great fury, and the seas came from many parts, which harassed them much, and broke o.ver the ships, which, not having the decks [as in a man-of-war], if God should not succor them, they could not escape, aml not being.able to lay to, of necessity they scudded northeast towards the la.ml; and now, holding themselves for lost, they commended themselves to our Lady of Guadalupe, and made their promises [or olferings], and ran thus until three o'clock in the afternoon with much fear and labor, for they saw they were going to be lost, and already they perceived many signs of the laud which wa~ near, as small birds, and logs very fresh, which had floated from some rivers, although from the dark and clon<ly weather the land did not appellr. At this boor the :Mother of God succored them with the grace of her Son, and there came a very violent rainstorm from the north, which made them send all that night and the following day until sunset to the south, with.the foresail·

·'Y no toner puente." In Spanish, pnentetloes not mean exs.ctly "dook" when applied to a ship; it means the place where the batteries of a ship are situated.

They were probably in latitude 42° 30' abreat1t of Rogue River and working their way back to El Cabo do Pinos; but they must have been sev.enty miles broad off the coast, which was therefore not visible. The logs were bronght down the flooded rivers of this part of the coast; and they always have been a feature off the coast north of :Mendocino.

and on the nineteenth oi January, the pilot Antonio Flores, who was in the tender, found himself in latitude forty and three degrees, where the land makes a cape, or point, which was named Calio Blanco, an<l from \vhich the coast begins to run to the northwest, and ver~· close to it, he found a River of large volume, and deep, that upon its banks it had very large Ashes, Willows, Elden;, and other trees of Castile; and wishing to enter it, the currents would not permit him." [And thereupon Ensign Alferez Martin Aguilar, commander of the tender, ·and the pilot Antonio Flores, finding they were in a latitude beyond that mentioned in the Instructions of the Viceroy, that there was no appearance o! the flag-ship, and that the crew were very sic-kly,agreed to return to Acapulco.]

from the twenty-seventn of February, until Tl.mrsday, the first of March, they rnu the greatest danger, and 11tlll more on the night o? the same day, andwhen it became daylight, they gave thanks to Our J,ady, and to Her Blessed Son, for having save1l them from so dark and terrible a night, because the storm is not felt so much in the daytime: a.od when the weather cleared up, on the first of'?ilarcl', they observed the sun, in forty and four degrees, with so mnch cold t1111t ~hey weN fr·~zing,

A REPORT ON MONOMOY AND ITS SHOALS.

J\Il'J'CI-IELJ ,, -'"-»<-<i<-'taut.

COAST AND GEODl<~'JIC St:HVEY 0FFIC1':, .Tu.ue '.,!.:-;, 18SH. The peninsula of Monomo,y and the group of shoals about it present dangers that affect tlw commerce between the States to a greater degree llerhaps than nuy other obstrn ctiouo.; for here, at the eastern entrance to Nantucket and Yineyanl Soun1h;, pass about 30,000 Ye~:o;el:-; :mnually, and occasionally 300 in a single day-the maximmh of the year. These :mu vessel;; a Yeragl' :!00 tons measurement,, giving a total of G0,000 tons, and represent, with cargo. $;~,000,000. These vessels not only run the gatmtlet among tlwse n~.ural llan~ers, but they endanger l'ach other hy crow1ling into the fair-ways. Tile principal avenue-Butler's Holc-l1as only half' 1lw width that it had a century ago, and its course has of late yem's very materially changetl. Every foot of width where safety jg assured has a value, and if the limits of the shoals eould be accurately defined there would be a great reduction in the real dauger and, most or all, in tlrn fear of danger which delays the fleet in thick weather. In the measure that we can furnish 1lle coaster with accurate clrnrts and marks of this locality we reduce liis danger and his fears, whid1 tax the community. Tlle real source of trouble iis the comitant; shifting of these shoals and their growth. \Y l' speak within tlle truth when we assert that these shoals have doubleu their volume since the last century, an<l they have moved a mile in the average. The worst of it is that th P mowmPnt is very far from uniform in rate or direction for different members of the group. This neighborhood was designated by <.Jhamplaiu (1.605) Cap Battul"ier, couvesing the impression, by this name and the context in his narrative, of a projecting region of breaking flats. At the present rate of building, the dry land of Monomoy could scarcely barn been half tlw presP11t lengtll at the time of Champlain, and, if half the hulk, it must have been submerged. The present aspect of the case is ,-ery threatening to mwigatiou. It looks as if tile sea would soon break from Monoo:ioy to Nantucket 011 the summit of the circus tLat is formed by Pollock Hip, Great Round Shoal, arnl Great Point Rip, with their conmidions. The present broken wall has material enough in it to close the ship naYigation, if this material slwnkl he strewn along more uniformly by some great storm so as to connect morn intimately the chain of shoals. i\foreon:·r, there is plenty of new material supplied from the caving down of the Chatham shore. This CTWiug has been very actfre of late years, nn<l forrrns the theme of Appendices to Annual Heports of' the Coast Survey for 1871 and 1873. The beach in front of the town of Chatham began to break up in 1871, and Professor Peirce, then Superintendent, ortlere1.l special 1mrvey8, which were Pxecnte1l by Assistant H. L. Marinclin, and formed the subject of reports by ms self. The earliest chart of this neighborhoml based upon auytliing like a regular 1mrwy .,;cems to be that of Capt. Paul Pinkham, made at the time that the present light-house was being built upon Great Point Nantucket in 17&1. There are plenty of earlier charts, and there are sailing directions as P.i.r back ·as 1707; but the Paul Pinkham cltal't, ou the whole, furnishes the first reliable testimony relative to the location of shoal~ at the entran<>,e to the Vim>yarrl Sound.

leave to offer an anal~·sis of this testimony iu detail because of its importauce, aud because I fear that the chart of which I speak is likely otherwise to be confounded with a later one b~· the Blunts, assuming to be "surveyell by Oapt. Paul Pinkham," which is singnlarlj· ont in· its longitudes and in its distances. The following appears upou the chart, wuich I haYe used as my base of comparison:
A CHART OJ<' NANTUCKET SIIOALS SURVEYED BY CAPT. PAUL PINKHAM.
lllostou: Puulisllell. and sohl l>y 'Villiam Norman, No. 7:i Newbury street, Feliruary lG, liHl.]

Tu all u·Jwm it may concern ; As there ne,·er has yet been publisbetl au accurate chart of Nantucket Shoals, Tliese are to certify that when the Light-house was building on Nantucket Point, iu 1784, this slll'\'f'\' ot the 8hoals was made from the lantern (an opportunity never before bad for so valu,able :i pnriJOse) bj· Capt. Paul Pinkl1am and othern, by the hel1l of the hest compasses and instruments that could !JI' procured, and it .!Ja.s !Jcen rwo,·ed by experience to be the most accurate chart ever offered to the public of those daugeron8 shoals (which are a terror to all navigators), which bas been run by with greatest safet;y and is fullj' approYed, and that the publication of this chart, from its accuracy, cannot fail to be g1·eatly beneficial to all uavigators who may fall in with sai<l shoals, is the judgment of us. · NANTUCKET, Sept. 1, 1790. JNO. CARTWRIGHT. JOS'H CHASE. DAN'L COFFIN. NATH'L BARNAI-m. JAS. BACKER. WM. COFFIN. ALEX. COFFIN, JUN. 'rHOS. DELANO.

The nmuy sur\"e.vors who have attempted the surrny of the island of Nantucket, with the shoals around it, and whose charts have beeu published, have, from ex1>erience, proved very incor· rect and erroneous, more particularly the shoals which, lying at so great a distance from the land, have hitherto been laid llowu from information only; from hence has arisen great errors and inac· curacies in the various charts publislietl of those shoals. On considering their dangerous situa.tion and the dread they are to all navigators who frequent the coast, as well a1o; the great utility of a correct chart, I have been induced tQ use m;y best endeavors to obtain a new and accurate survey of the shoals eastwardly of the island, being taken from tl.Je light-1.Jouse 011 Nantucket Point in 1784, which eminence afforded a large and distant pro8pect of the shoals, and from which their true bearing was had with precision and certaint~·. I hei·eby certify that the chart hereunto annexed, having been carefully examined b.Y warrantable pilob\ aml navigators a111l run by for some years with safety, is fully approved au<l by them certified. N ANTUCKE'l', September 1, l i'VO. l'ELEG COFFIN, JR. Tbe scale of this map is about 1:1315.Sfl. It is tile property of the Nantucket Athenooum. It will be obsen·ed from the foregoing that the claim of accurac.y particularly applies to the rtgion seen from the Light-house which it: plotted on this old chart in latitude 4,10 22', longitude 700 00~'· It is tl1e same Light-house that now staodK, and is found by latest survey, in 4JO 23' 24" of latitude, and 70° 02' 45" of lougitude. 'l'lw former determination, on the Paul Pinkham chart, was then 2! miles too far to the cast-soutlwast. This error, however, need not concern us if we confine our inquiries to objects witliiu :sight of the Light-l1onse; and first of all we must seek those that have not cllanged, iu or(ler to orient ourselves. From Matthew Clark's chart of this neighborhood, indorsed by Osgood Carleton, for the Boston :Marine Society (1798), the nniation iu the eompass as use<l seems to have been 60 45';

and, as the Paul Pinkham chart is evidently adjusted to the magnetic meridian, we liaYe eorrected for rnriation (as finally ascertained to be about 6~0 west) in the following bearings: "Uishop and Clarks" Hocks on Paul Pinkham's chart lie 15! nautical miles N. 39}0 \V. (true) from Great Point. Bisho11 and Clerks on the most recent cl.tart lie 14:1 uantical miles X. 39:1 \V. of Great Point light. The distances are measured for the old chart, 11ot by its scale, but by minutes of latitude. 1 · would remark here that the Paul Pinkham chart is a pretty g"ood projection, with ratio of 1: 1.3 for longitude and latitude divisions; but the scale of miles seems to be minutes of longitude. There is, upon the northeastern portion of Tuckernuck, a sort of lagoon, at the head of which is quite a hill, upon which there was at the time of Paul Pinkham, and still is, a group of houses. This hill as represented upon the Coast Surny charts, lies W. 30° S. from Great Point Light distant lOJl nautical miles. Upon Paul Pinkham's chart the llead of the lagoon bears W. 29-P S., distant 11 nautical miles. The lagoon is known as East Puud, all(} tile hill ,th at rises at its head is a Yery conspicuous laudrnark. These three points, Bishop and Clarks, Tuckernuck, and Great Point Light, are all t1tat we can feel sure of as remaining unchanged. Great Round Slwal.-lf we draw a circle through the three shoalest soundings upon the Coast Survey chart we find its center N. 550 E. from the Great Point Light-house, distant 7Jl miles. On the Patil Pinkham chart it is represented by a circular line of dots, the center of which is N. Go40 K of Great Point light, 72- miles distant. Little Round Sl10al.-Tl1e shoalest water lies N. 39:\o E. of Great Point Ligllt, upon our most recent cua1ts, distant 8 miles. Upon Paul Pinkham's chart it is indicated by a circle of dots, the ce11ter of which is N. 40~ 0 E. from the Ligllt, distant 7 miles. This i;hoal it; not easily distinguished from the Stone Horse. "Broken part of Pollock Rip" lies N. 37.go E., 11 miles from the Light, mi the Coast-Surwy chal't, and N. 35;\0 E., 14~ miles on _Paul Pinkham's. This is rather beyond the range of Yision from the Light-bouse, except for a wreck, and bard to distinguish, the shoals being numerous. Stone Jlorse.-Thc middle of this shoal, as well as can lie determined, lies about iu the same direction upon old and uew charts, N. 2!!! 0 E. from Great Point Light.. Its distance, accordiug to Paul Pinkham's chart, was 81- nautical miles. It is now i)i, i.e., the shoal bas moved about threeq uarters of a mile toward the Light; liandkerckie.f Slwal.-This slloal ltas ,·er.r much iucreai,;ed in !'ize, and icorkcd or extemlPd southward. The least deptu is the same (4 feet) now as upon Clark's map of 1 ms; but this figure lies auout 1 mile farther from Great. Point Light on Clark's chart than upon our own. The southern point of the slloal is giyen N. 20 W., 8~ miles from Great Point Light, by Pinkham while by Clark it is 72 miles due north, aud upou the recent Coast Survey chart 6! miles K. r;~o W. The northerli or northeastern portion of the shoal has not essentialls changed, being the same for !'inkham, Clark, and the Coast Sun·e.r~ but the growth southward has exceeded one mile iu the past century. ·upon both of the old charts (Pinkham and Clark) the sajliug course for the" :North Channel ·i was laid down north of the Handkerchief, and 1·an across what is now dry land uPar the present Monomoy Light. Clark's representation of Monomoy indicates a great extent subject to o\·erfiow, so that it is difficult to make comparisons between it and other plottings. Butler's Bole.-This most frequented channel was about Ul miles wide upon Pinkharn'.s chart, 1 mile on Clark's, and little more than a half mile at the time of the most recent snn-ess. ~\s might.have been expected, Butler's Hole has increased in depth as it has lo:::;t in width. We find nearly 20 fathoms on the site where the old charts gave 15 as maximum depth. The 1>reseut max· imum depth is 232 fathoms. Before entering upon the more modem history of this region, we must call attention to wlrnt we may designate as the deep hole, indicated by the sounding of 24 fathoms upon Paul Piukham·s chart. This sounding is plotted 7! uautical miles N. 71~0 E. of Great Point light. )foBlair, in 181!.I, found 2lf fathoms at a distance of 6 miles N. 79~ E., and Captain Brownson, at the margin of bis s1uw·y of 18831 gives 20 fathoms and no bottom, 7 miles N. 77JtO E. of Great Point Light.

to be uo doubt that a gully of considerable extent exists which our vrinted chart does not. propt·rly represent; and it is believed that this gully i:::. a permanent feature, notwith1:1tauding that our bearing differs from Paul Pinkham's very largely. It must lie bomc in mind that the bearings of brt'oki1i_q shoals could be accurately taken from Great Point light tower; but a deep hole maketi no sign. This gully lies so near tile proper track of the South-Channel fleet that its careful representation upon the chart would l>e a valuable guide to na,-igation, while its absence from the chart, or entirely inadequate rendering, pro~ides for disaster. Some >essel standing in from seaward in thick weather may happen to cast her lead in this deep place., and, believing herself outside of all the shoals, sail on to lier destructiou. There is reason to believe that Great Round Slioal and this gully are to be fouud just where they always ha>e been. The sailing line on Paul Pinkham's chart of 1784, if plotted upon our own chart, lies very near the southern slope of this gully, and between it and onr most receut sailing line. But why this gully shou1<1 not :fill up, in this region of strong t.ida] currents laden with sand, is :t mystery. It might be worth wliile to take some current observations aud ascertain if a resultant occurs here not elsewhere developed. 11fonomoy Point.-Tl.tis is well defined on Desbarres' chart of 1777, and on Pinkham's of 1791; but on :Matthew Clark~schart, 1798, it is represented as if awash. Tbe distances across from Great Point to Monomoy are: on Desbarres' chart (1777), 14 nautical miles; on J>aul Pinkham's chart (1784-'91), ll:i nautical miles; on Matthew Clark's chart (1798), 10~ uautica1 miles; United States Coast Survey ( 1868), 9! nautical mile11. 1\Iattbew Clark's cba1·t onl.v assumed to be a correction of Desbarres', while Paul Pinkham's was from a new stuvey. There seems al ways to lrnve been a shoal off the extreme poiut of Monomoy known as ''Egg Islan<l," when dry. This shoal has sometimes attached itself to tbe end of l\Ionornoy. hut oftener !ms been separated by a deep slough channel. If we ignore the slough channel that now separates the point of .l\lonomoy from the Shovelful Shoal (the re-appearing Egg lslantl in an ad\·anceu position), we reduce the di.stance across from Great Poiut to less than nine nautical miles ( 1875). It should be notell here that Great Point Nantucket has lost, by fits and starts, considerable length. Paul Pinkham found the extreme poiut in 1784 over 3,000 feet beyon{l the present light-house, theu in course of construction; Assistant Henry L. Whitiug's topographical sLirvey of 1846 gives tllis distance 1,90() feet, and Assistant F. D. Granger, on his hydrographic sht·Pt of 1874, places the point (by a signal as near as possible to the high-water breaker) about 1,()00 feet from the light-houses. · ·we lw,i·e every rea.son, then, to believe that the dry lmid of ;lfonomoy has extended, soiithu:ard two m'ilc.~ during the past century.· The first survey of l\fonomoy made by a professional topographer was that of l\fr. Charles 0. Boutelle, then attached to the trigonometrical survey of Massachusetts, in 1840. At that tirue the point lay 2,_GSl feet S. 3,837 \V. of the Light-house then standing. (See Captain Boutelle's re· port, .addressed to Superintendent Ooast and Geodetic Survey, 16th June, 188G, appended.)t In 1853 Assishi.nt S. A. Gilbert, of the Ooast Survey, made a plane-table survey, and found.. the extreme point of Monomoy 2,821 feet S. 3,542 feet \V. of the" Old Ligbt-h<mse" referred to l>y J\Ir. Boutelle. The first twelve to thirteen years of authentic history only ad\"anced this point about 140 feet. The next sur·ey was by Assistant C. T. Iardella, of the Coast Survey, in 1856, when the extreme point was fonn<l to be 3,180 feet S. 3,906 feet vY. 'of the" Old Light· house," showing an advance of 509 feet SW. in three years, or at rate of 170 feet per annum.
· Tliere is a mysterious chart in the archives of the Coast and Geodetic Sun-ey entitled, ".A chart of George's Bank, including Cape Co<l, Nantucket, and the shoals lying on their coasts, surveyed by Captain Paul Pinkham," and "pnhlished by Edmund M. Blunt, 1797." · This chart, ostensibly six years later t.ha.n t.he "Chart of Nantucket Sl10al·" (which we ilave found so valuable), is compara.tiYely ai)surd. It is a whole degree out in longitude, and it g-iYes, for the distance from Great Point to Monomoy sixteen minutes of J.Btitude; and yet the bearing and distance of George'· Shoal were more nearly correct than upon any previous chart. Its scale is about 1: 400000. t Captain Bontelle's testimony against the map ma.de by John G. Hale in 1831 rules it out of court; but I may be nllowed to state tila.t upon that map the point is represented a.s about 1,650 foot south of the light, and the PtJtOdl!r Hole Harb11r is absent. There is no doubt, in my own mind, that the testimony of the old people on Cape Cod is correct in ascribing the first creation of the Powder Hole to the first half of this century. We have witnessed its de· structiou.

Again, the point was located by the survey of Assistant P. C. 1~. vVest, of the Coast Sun·ey, in 1868, 4,851 feet S. 5,266 feet "\V. of the same old light-house, showing an advance southwesterly of ahont 2,123 feet in twelve years, or about 175. feet per annum. l!'inall~', we have the plane-table. sheet of Assistant C.H. Boyd, of the Coast Survey, execnted with the intent to complete the history to the present time (June, 1886), and :find the point ·J,~66 feet S. and 5,151 feet W. of the site of the Old Light-house, showing an ad rnnce of about 22~ feet per annum nearly south. The growth of the point is again slowing down, and Mr. Boyd's map shows that deposit has been arrested elsewhere en route from the north. It would seem that the material torn from the Chatham shore travels down the beach or near to it, and adds itself to the point of Monomoy in unequal masses at unequal intervals of time. As far as we are adviseu, the sands move from the north under the action of the ground swell which sets on from U1e northeast. It. is the same at this entrance to Vineyard Sound as at the entrances of Delaware and Chesapeake- Bays-the slwals protrude and advance from the north side. Of course, at all such entrances the flooll tidal currents sweep in along the outside shores, and bear with them a great load of silt supplied by the breakers, so that the resultants are towards the bay, near the coast; but this movement (b~- currents) is usually just as conspicnom; ou one side as on the other of the entrance. l\1r. Boy(l found the Shovelful Shoal showing a .dry spot for two hours at low tide. Tllis has been dry before, but our hydrographic sheets have usually gi.,-en 1 foot at mean low tide. The summit of this shoal is now about 2,300 feet farther to the t'wuthwest than it was in JS53; bnt the point of Monomoy has gained upon it 877 feet. Of course, if this gain continues, a sudden annexation may be expected. It seems probable that this shoal ad\ances more slowly than )1onomoy Point, because in deeper water. The central point of the dry Shovelful is now S. 36° 41' \V. (true), from ohl light-house site, 9,Gl 7 feet.* The discrepancies of the measures of l\Ionomoy from land surveys cannot be attributed to any want of definition or to differences iu the height of the tille. On sandy shores exposed to ocean waves the strand (i. e., the belt left bare when the tide is out) is very narrow and of nearly uniform width for tides of equal range. This is often true, irrespective of the ocean depths in the neighborhood. It is quite otherwise as regards inside beaches-tilose along the margins of sheltered basins or harbors-where the strand is often broad and always irregular, becanse ouly the continuation of the bed-slope.~. The point of l\fonomoyhas always been Lold or" steep-to," at< the sailors sa.y. Illustration No. rn gives a compari;so11 of Paul Pinkham's survey of 1IM with that of the Coast Survey of 1886. Let us turu now from these measures of dry land to the hidden dangers that lie beneath the sea. These are dunes that creep upon the track of our commerce, and grow up it1 the channels, to become more aud more sources of distress every year, and the most remarkaole of these, altl1011gb. not the most dangerous, is the Handkercliief.
HANDKERCHIEF SHOAJ:,,

From a glance at our most recent M1rvey one would say that this shoal is shaped like a pear with stem downward. It is, in a very general sense, a sector-like figure with radius of 3! nautical miles and 360 :flare. Closer examination, however, discovers that it is not s,:pnmetrical, b·1t consists of three lobes, representing, as I think, thr-ee different periods of growth. The most northeru lohe, which is the largest now, is the oldest. We find it upon Paul Pinkharn's chart in the form of a horseshoe opening directly west. It was then about half the size of the present northern lobe as limited by the 12-foot curve, or less than a tbiru of the whole sho'.ll as now similarly limited. The area of this shoal, as defined ty the IS.foot curve, increased from 9,888,870 square j·ards in 1853 to 12,636,672 in 1875, an<l the southern point advanced into the sound 3,400 feet; or over onehalf of a nautical mile (34 seconds of latitude). The bulk of this shoal in 1853 was l!:!,543,759 cubic yards; in 1875 it, had increased to 19,175,835 cubic yards, and in this interval its center of gravity had moved 3,956 feet S. 20 55' E. (true).
"The old Light-house was 182 feet N. 46° 30' W. (true) from present Light-house.

These recent changes of the Handkerchief Shoal can be th ms concisely and contidently stated, because our figures are based upon very careful comparisons of soundings made for the Coast Survey by Lieut. Maxwell vVoodbull, U. S. N., in 1853, Assistant F. D. Granger in 1874, and Lieut. R. D. Hitchcock, U.S. :N., in 1875. The sketches that accompany this report represent final conclusions from much discussion, in which Mr. H. F. Bothfold has taken a laborious part as expert in such comparisons. Sketch No. 20 gives a graphical representation of the changes in the Handkerchief Shoal. It is hoped in subsequent reports to complete this diagnosis, and to point out clearly-what now -is but dimly seen-tbe depeudence of these movements of the samls upon great cycles of the ticles. · Very respectfully, yours, HENRY MITCHELL, Coast and Geodetic Siin:ey. :Mr. F.

WashingfQn, D. O., June 16, 1886. 'Bm: l return herewitll tile llUIJers sub mi tte1l by Assistant :Mitcheli on the su~ject of Monomoy Island, south of Chatham, Mass. I recoguize the smaller tracing, sent by Mr. H. F. Walling, as COJlied from a large manuscdpt map which I assisted in making. I also recognize it as a correct copy of a plane-table survey :ruade by me on the island of Monomoy, in November, 1840. I checked the survey by several triangulation points upon t be island, <letermiued by me for temporary use, by the "three-point" method. At the time of ru.r su1Tcj· the "Powder·holc" harbor, near the Light-house, was a place of resort for fisltermen aml a harl.1ur of refuge for small vessels. By spacing upon the tracing I find that the southernmost point of Monomoy Island, iu November, 1840, was 2,47fi feet, or 24".4 S. and 3,83G teet W.-50".5 of Monomoy Light. The Coast Survey 11osition of the same light is gi,·eu in Coast Sun·ey Report for 1851, page 189, as latitude 41 o 33' 32".W, longitude fi90 59' 18".98. Tho "faint indication of a triangulation point" upon Mr. Walling's tracing is undoubtedly tltat of the Light<l10use. He gives the squares inclosing it. These count from the zero point of tbe section, and are four inches upon a side, or, upon the scale of 200 rods to an inch (1: 39600), each 8ide is 800 rods, or 13,200 feet, long. I u the printed tables of the Massachusetts Trigonometrical Survey, section v, page 71, :Monomoy light-house is given as 202,380.37 feet south, and 191,375.31 feet east of the zero point of the section. 'l'he north side of ille square inclosing the light is therefore the fifteenth south of the zero, -0r 13,:wo x '15=198,000 foet south, and the east side is also the fifteenth, or 198,000 feet east of zero. The position of the Light-house in the square is therefore 4,380.37 feet south of the north sid~, aml u,024.G9 feet west of its east side. · These quantities spaced upon the tracing agree so closely with the station marked by Mr. \Valling as to assur~ its identity with the J,ight-house of' 1840.

The necessity for my survey of l\fonomoy Island arose from the grossly inaccurate character of the map of Chatham made by Mr . .T ohn G. Hale for the town authorities in 18.'H. This person was employed by contract with many towns in eastern Massachusetts to make maps which could be returned to the Secretary of' State, under the act requiring each town to make and return a map of its territory upon a uniform scale of 100 rods to an i11ch. Mr. Hale's maps were all very neatly drawn, and were all very inaccurate; ma11y were only sketches without any survey. So far as I can recollect, at this distance of time, I was informetl that Mr. Ilale never >isiteJ Monomoy Island, but copieu some. older map or chart. At any rate the case was so flagrant an evasion of the law that the selectmen of Chatham furnished me, at their expense, with men and transportation required to make the 1mrvey. The large tracing sent by J\Ir. \Valling represents Mr. Hale's map, now on record in the State House at Boston. Yours, respectfully, C. 0. BOu"'TELLE, Assistant, Coast and Geodetfo Survey. F. M.

CoAsT A?\D GEorn~Trc SrnYEY,

Boston, Jlass., September 1 lS::iu. DEAR SrR: I present herewith a report of my recent resur,-eys of tile shore-lines and beacltes of Martha's Vineyard, more particularly in regard to the cLauge;,; which ha H\ oecurred :,;irwe the fir;,;t
StUYeys were made, just forty years ago. Tbe changes along the southern shore of the Is laud give an interesting illustration of tlic action of what may be termed a "rolling beach," and the power of tLe ocean sea-dash npou a saudy shore to driYe this mateifal before it. Tl!e .south shore of Martba'ti Yineyanl is a can·, where little if auy other force has operated. Its geographical position, so far beyond the trend of the main land, aml its straight alignment, present au unobstructed front to the wa,·e action. Although iu occasional storms the breakers come upon the shore in oblique directions, the preni.iling action of the Rea-dasl1 is normal to the shore. Even in gales from the southeast and south west, after the force of the wiml subsidPs, the breakers come in directly from the south. I witnessed some years ago after a lwiwy southeast gale a "roller," which I estimated to be a mile in leugth~ break upon the shore in a ;;iugll~ blow. An examination of the original map upon which 1 ha.Ye made the rcsun·ey will gh·e a better u11<lerstanding of the nature and exte11t of the changes which ha Ye oceurrerl than ean be con w:red by a written tlescription of them. Where the beaches haYe been low, particularly iu front of tile several ponds, the overshot of the sands has made a greater encroachment upon the l1ou1ls allll marshes inside of the beach than occurs in the outer sllore~line oppm:ite. The general recedeuel' of the shore line I should estimate at from 175 to 200 feet. At the crest of the summit of the hluft' at Nashaquitsa Cliffs, which is about 150 feet in height~ the maximum waste is about 220 foer. Opposite Chilmark Pond the maximum outer waste is about 180 feet, and the on·n;l!ot of sands into the pond near the opening is about 52.1 feet. At Tisbury Great Pond the outside waste west and east of the inlet is, respectively, about 180 and 140 feet, while the correspondiug encroachments upon the pond are, respecti\ ely, 680 and 480 feet. Quite a peculiar coincidence occurs in the present opening into Tisbury Pond with that of 1846, wl1ich is almost idl'ntical in loeation a1Hl extellt, except that it is farther inward, while between the years ISCO and 1865 the opening \"\"a8 about t hreP· fourths ol" a mile farther eastward. Most of the inlets of thl' soutlwru poml;; are 01wuetl artificial Ir, for the purpose of improving the fisheries and to prtwent tbe O\'ertlow of marshes by tlte 1h·,,hn waters of the IJOnds. When once opened, the width and depth of the inlets arc establi::;hed 1111d maintained according to the power and condition of the tides and the wa\·~ action of tbe ocean. They sometimes remain open for several months, and again are clotietl lJy the first l1eavy istorm. The most considerable movement of the entire beach occurs along the front of Great Ilerrmg Pond, in Edgartown, where the whole muss of the lleach has heen tlri\·eu in upon the former wate1s

of tlrn poutl a distance about equal to twice its width. As will be seen upon the map the overslrnt of sands bas eutirely obliterated Craxtuckett Pond and a smaller one west of Great Herr~ng Pond, awl in one instance changetl what was a former co,·e into a. separate pond. I would again briefly allude to the difficulty of making an accurate resurvey of the south sliore of J\Iartha7s Vineyard, in consequence of the entire loss of former points. The mere linear extent of shore-line surveye<l gives no adequate measure of the work invoh,ed. T11e stUV<'Y of the new openiug into E<lgartown Harbor and Cotamy Bay and the sl10res of Chappaquiddick foland, should, I suppose, be classed as an original survey. 1t i8 on a new projection and not connected with former work. The locality of tlie work, except along the northerly shore of Clrnppaf)niddick and at Cape Pogt', is beyoud the immediate coutrol of the only group of triang-1llatio11 y1oints upon tile sheet (Edgartown Spire anll Light-House, Cope Poge Light-House, and Sampson's Hill). I wish, 110we>er, to report the YeQ' excellent character of the projection made by l\!r. Charles Junken and SPnt to me for this work. I fonnd it so accurate that the most remote <leterminations from the base points at the southeasterly part of the fheet were efiected without any perceptible enor. I have marked upon the sheet a number of intermediate points which I Jrnve determine<l for use in the <letailcd survey, mainly house cliimne_ys, which will saYe much labor in the en·nt of future resurve;ys. I had 11ot the original map of my survey of 1846 of the eastern 1mrt of Chappaquiddick and Cape l'oge, by wilieh to make comparison of results and report upou the changes. '.fhis can, of cour:;;e, lie done at tlie office. I would call attention, however, to the point of Cape Poge where great waste lt118 occurred. The summit of the sandy bank or bluff nearest to the Light-House is ll-OW witliin about 4i"i feet of its foundation and wasting rapidly. Some thirty years ago or more tlie foot of this bank was protected hy a rip-rap of stone. The line of this ridge of stone c:an he seen UIHll'l' water from the top of the bank, I jmlged from 500 to 600 feet beyond the present shore. lim·. 'There is indication of onrfiow along the beach opposite the two easterly coves of Cape Poge Pond, wilich may hin-e been of sufficient force and rnnge to aftect the outlines of the coves tbemselns. How far tlie strong tidal currents through Muskeget cbaunel have affected tile eastedy beach of CLappaquiudick I am unable, for the reason stated, to report. At tile extreme southeastt·rly point of the island (\Vasque, Point), or just south and west of tlie point, the tendency see1m; to be to maintain a re1;narkable uniformity of position. Slight changes, forming waves in the ontn liue of the heacb, occur with almost every storm, but the general outline of the point is in rnncil the same g-eograpbical position it was forty years ago. A ft·ature of interest and ·rnlue as a m('aus of shelter and protection in tbis exposed fiRhiuggronntl is the increase, in size and ele>ation above liigh title, of Skiffs Island, which for the past twentj· j'ears has been little more thau a shoal dry at low water. Wlietber its present changed condition is due to the influence of the new currents through the new opening is a question which would require quite elaborate observation to determine. At the time of my former survey" Skiffs faland '' was merely a shoal covered at high tide. Its conllition and the rough water and "rips" around it made it impractical to determine it a.fl a topographic :feature. Its location on the published chnrts of the Sarvey is, l believe, from hydrographic data. In connection with my present surveJ· I thought it important to determine its poRition and outline more accurately. I did not make iustrumeutal stations upon it, but put signals on the salient points and determined them from shore stations. The geograpl.iical position of the Island falls off the present sheet, but I ham tram;ferred it one minute in longitude west from its true position. The survey was made on August 15, wbich was tlie .first of mauy days when a landing could be favorably made. The Island is about southeast from "\Vasque Point and distant from sbore to shore about 18- miles. .At the time of the 8nrvey it was about 1,200 feet in length-north and south-with a greatest width, east and west, of about 290 feet and contained an area of about 4i acres. Probably for the first time in the lai;t fifty years beach weeds and grasses are taking root and growing upon it. The 1ww opening through Cotamy beach, so called,' ccurred on the uight of January 9-10, 1886. After a gale f'rom ENE. the wind shifted to \VSW., still blowing a gale. The west beach, aR the portion west of the opeuiug is Iiow de:>ignatcd, was <1uite low before this gale occurred, and after the shift of wind the whoJe beach, in lon.g-shore phrase, was a" breaker." .A very high tideone of the highest siuce the Minot's Ledge gale-acc:ompa11iecl this storm.

that with the turn of the tide the opening was first made by the outwar1l or southerly current. As soon as the beach could be visiteu the opening was alreatly, by estimation, about 100 yards in width. On July 1 it was about 1,200 feet. The present survey of tlrn inlet was made on July l, and tile position of the sandy points on either side of it as then cletermiue<l, place the opening alxmt half its widtli east of the position of the former opening as determined by the snrvey of 1856. The width of the present inlet, as will be seen by comparison of the two surveys, is nearly the same. [See illustration No. 21.J There is uot much chaugc in tlw general position of the beach, but the easterls point of the present opening is farther within the bRy (northward) than at any previous time. Tlie cLanges of filling up, by wind and sea, in the site of the last opening, before it closed, along its pathway bet\Yeen the fast lanu of Chappaquiddick and lbe former outer beach, are exhilJited by the tletails of the
map.

Contrary to the usual action of the inlets and openings on the south side of Martha's Vin6· yard, and particularly those through Cotamy Beach, the resultants of the mo\~iug sands thus far with the new inlet have been 1ce.stward. This, l10wen'r, will probably prO'>e to be but a temporary movement, and eventually tlie opening, as all previous ones ha\·e done, will work eastu;ard. There are p_reisent conditions of the beach, however, which may retard this movement. This iutlnence, it effectiYe, will be due to the comparatinly small amount of material in the west beach, wl!id1 is unusually low. One of the forces which 1irevail in causing the east eris movement of tile opeui11g is the encroachment of the west point or chop upon its channel, and, by contracting it, causing a corresponcliug waste or cutting awa.y 011 tlie east point or chop. Formerly the west beach contained quite high sand hills and dunes, which supplied material for the extension. of the water-point. The high sand ba11k wl.Jich existed in 187t was probably oue of the causes which teu<led to fill up the artificial cnt made by General Warren. The tidal currents through the inlet, through the narrows of Cotam;r Bay and through Edgartown Harbor, are now Yery stro11g. I am unable to state the exact Yelocity, but it lias had power to increase the depth of water along the front of the town and about the whan-es. The currents are also -effecting change in the position aud deptli of the poiut of Chappaquiddick, opposite the town. They also aftect the manmnvering of ,-essels, which now do not like to anchor ahorn Chappaquiddick Point. The fishermen state that the scour of those currents is injuring the clam and quahaug grounds, which are of much local vRhw. 1 have endeavored to ascertain whether the tidal currents through the harbor were strongt>r now than when the inlet of 1856 was open. From such facts as I coulu gather, however, they seem to be of abotlt the same force. In 1856 a. wliale ship lying at the illner wharf was torn from her moorings anu carried eastward witL tho tide until her anchors were let go. · That these strong currents must produce changes in the physical comlition of the liarbor seems self-evident. The very peculiar tidal phenomena connected with it makes the study of the subject one of special interest. Comparing the time the })fesent in.let bas been open, about eight months, with the eighteen or twenty years of less effecth-43 action since the former inlet closed, the probabilities are that the harbor channels and shoals are still iu a transition state. During the next spring or summer it may be desirable to ascertain, by a b;ydrographic survey, the degree of change which has taken place, and in what WRY the change of regimen affects the quality of the harbor. I append a notice from tlie local paper, the Vineyanl Gazette, relating to the opening of t.he new inlet. Very respectfully submitted. HENRY L. WHITING, Assi.sta1it. Mr. F. M. THORN, Superintendent Goa.st and Geodetic Survey.

years. Tbe opening is reported to be 100 feet "ide aud 5 or G feet in depth, and it is beliewd will be like1y to stand for a number of years, although there are those who dissent from this opmwn. Assuming the permaneucy of the opening, howeYer, its importance can lmrdly be overestimateil. The long voyage around Cape Poge, witli its attemlant risks and exposure, and tlie long day required for a f("W hours' fishing, can be discontinued, aucl instead thereof will be subi;tituted the safe aud eas;y run dowu the harbor, with two chances a day for those who <lesire it. Summer visitors will enjoy the eas~· access to tbe fishing-grounds now afforded, and the sojourners at Katama especially, who ha\'e had heretofore to sail nearly around the island of Olrnppaquiddick to cateh a bluefish, but wlio can now accomplish their purpose after a half-hour's rnn, will find the change a most agreeable one. With proper legislation on the seining question the new opening ought in all respects, with the possible exception of the quahaug fishery, to operate to the decided ad \'autage of the town.

COAST AND GEODETIC Sur.TEY OFFICE, June '.!5, 1886. Joe Flogger Shoal.-This shoal forms the central prong i11 the subwerge<l delta of tlie Dela· ware. It is a mole of sand protruding from the mouth of the river into the bay, with a fair way or pass on either side. It is ov!'r 13 nautical miles long, but only !2,000 feet wide, in the average, at the base (18 feet below th..; plane of low-water spring tides).* It has an irregular and ,·ariable summit, \l'itll two remarkable sags or sloughs. 'Ve have two excellent sunep,; of tliis shoal, the first made in 1811-'±3 by Lieut. George S. Blake and others, the second in 188~-'83 b~- ~farindin, Mansfield, and 'Yiu slow. The case admitted of a simpler method than usual, an(l may ue briefly stated thns:

"' e have alread~· referred to Joe 'Flogger Shoal as a long mole extending from the mouth of Delaware River into Delaware Bay. W'"e have compared the· dimensions of this mole for the llifferent dates precisely as if it were an artificial structure needing repair. \Ye ham plotteu the profile of its crest with a plan of its location as a first essay (see Diagram .A); we ha Ye then plotted a profile of its mean depth, its location, and its width, and we ha,·e <lone tbis for each date, placing the results side by side (Diagram B }· The mean depth is the mean of the soundings from the 18foot contour on one side to the same contour on the other, and the location is that of the axis of each cross-section. That there may be no misunderstarnliug of this statement, the manner of determining the axis or the axial point in each cross-section is illustrated in tile following diagram:

Tbe dotted line in aboYe diagram bisects all the cllor<ls of the cross-section, and the rueau of all the points of bisection falls at i.8 on the horizontal scale, i. e., at lif of the base of the figure (18 feet at low tide) lies the axis of the shoal at this point. Having plotte<l the location, crest, width, mean <leptb, and sectional aiea, we ha Ye formulate<l these for equal distances along onr base. (See Tables I and II.) In locating this base npon the different projections l\lr. Boyd bas placed its zero, or origin of ordinates, in longitude i5° 2iY ,V,, latitude 3!> 0 JG' N. on the hydrographic sheet of 1841, and in longitmle 7;302'.!'15 11 , latitmlc 39° 1G' Ou" on the hydrographic sheet of 188'.l-these locations being identical in nature.
RESUL'l'S OP 'l'IIE
CO:IIPARISQ~S.

The first comparison was made for the location and height of the summit ridge, i. e., the crest of the shoal. This ridge has lost nearly a mile of length at the upper ellll, and it has dropped or worn down · about l~ feet in the forty years elapsed between the two surveys. This summit ridge has presen·ed the old alignment pretty well, except that the slough at the fifth mile amounts almost to a break now, and the break at the tenth and eleventh miles has shifted up-stream. (See Table No. I and diagram A..·) The highest 1iart of the summit ridge was about m~dway of its length. in 184J, but in the last survey it is found near the southern end. The great slough has shifted northward over one nautical mile without any change of depth; it is, howe>er, much narrower. Tlie second comparison was made for the location of tlie axis of the slwal, for the mean height, and for the base width; the plane of reference being low water of spring tides or one-half foot below mean low water.t (See the see<:~nd set of tables attached to this report and diagram B.·) Leaving out of consideration certain low aurl indefinite portions of the shoal, we may assert that its axis lies now where it did in 1841, but its length has diminished about 7 per cent., its width 20 per cent., and its ele,·ation of axis 11 per cent. These changes appear also in other prongs of the delta, such as Cross Ledge, &c., where loss of elevation is still more considerable. A glance at the diagram B, however, shows that the heavier portions of the shoal have maintained nearly the same elevations in tbe average. Midway of the length of the shoal (11,000 to 15,500 meters of our table), where the bea,·iest portion of the Joe Flogger is now found, the mean elevation has remained almost exa4,tly the same for the axis, although the summit bas lost 1 foot in the arerage an<l 3 feet at greatest. The width at the base bas not increased, but the cre~t is flatteued as if by the wash of steam vessels. The rolume of sand composing Joe Flogger Shoal has been reduced, according to these tables, 30 per cent., if we count the original length, or if we count only the present length and.its corresponding portion of the old shoal, we have a loss of about 27 per cent. No possible error in plane of reterenct~ can aceount for this, nor tlo we fincl adequate evidence of submergence; but upon these shoals and upon some portions of the shores there has been waste. "While the loss of length in Joe Flogger Shoal i8 mostly at the upper end, the wear in the lower half of the present shoal seems to be greater than in the upper. Confining ourselves to the present length, we find that the cross-section of the upper half lost, since 1842, 4,33! square feet, while the lower half lost 5,132 square feet, i.e., 18 per cent. more. For that })Ort ion of the ol<l shoal that has been lost, i. e., the first mile of Table No. I, we ham examined the new survey and find a ridge which marks the rain of the old shoal. This ridge has an average depth upon it of 23! feet, while in 1842-'.t,3 the average depth was about 13 feet.. Tho Joe Flogger lost, then, between 1842-'43 antl 1882-'83, a mile (or more nearly 1,800 meters) from its upper end, and in this mile there was an average dee1>ening of 10 feet, i. the summit fell or washed off, so as to lose 10 feet in elevation £or over a mile in length.

e.,

· The diagrams are omitted because of their great length. They are plottings on profile paper of the elements of the tables which follow. t The survey of 1841-'4:J was reduced to the plane of low-water spring tides, and th!l contours having been very carefully drawn in when the survey was made we did not dare to alter them, so we a.djustl'Al the new survey to this lower plane of reference.

'l'he valuable channels ou either side of Joe Flogger Shoal have not suffered. On the contrar_y, the thalu:eg depths ha,·e increased; they, too, have been scoured uow11. In the Blake Channel, which lies westward of the 1>hoal, the first half of the di1>tauee (13,000 meters from the hea.<l of the cha;rnel), the <leepening is only 0.2 foot, or essentially nothing; but for the second half (13,000 to 23,000 rueters) the deepening is nearlj' 3* feet. In the channel on the other 1>ide of Joe Flogger, i.e., in the main-ship-channel, the thalireg has deepened almost the entire lenglh, and in the a\·erage 3,f feet very uea:'ly. The minimum depth in either of these channels has not, perhaps, essentially changed, although the more numerous soundings iu tile later survey discover more water ornr the shallower reaches than would appear from the old "·ork. (See Tables Ill and IV.) We· are much indebted to Assistant U. H. Boyd, Mr. ·w. ll. Fairfield, and Mr. C. J. l\Ieade, who have done most of the work ou these comparisons. The first named gave but little time1 being busy on the review of accounts, but bis work was of good quality, being the proper adjustment of projections and the like. Mr. Fairfield made the tables an<l Mr. l\Ieacle the diagrams. Very respectfully submitted. BEXRY .MITCHELL, A118ista11t. .Mr. F. l\f. THORN, Superintendent Coast and Geodetic Surrey.

U. S.

CoAST AND GEODETIC SURV£V STEAMER BLAKE,

August 20, 1886. DEAR Sm: I ha,·e to make the fol1owing report of the season's work of the hydrograpbic party under my command, in\·estigating the currents of the Gulf Stream, in obedience to your general instructions, daterl January 9, 1886. The Blake left Washington on the morning of February 16, baving been delayed over a· month after the Jlarty was ready to lea Ye by ice in 11.ie Potomac River. Havana. was visited early in the season to obtain authority to establish a tide-gauge in the vicinity of Cape San Antonio, Cuba, for the purpose of gaining some knowledge of the relation, if any, existing between the entrance of the tidal wave into the Gulf <if Mexico and the Yariations in the velocity of the Gu Ir Stream at cr<>SS-section A. · The United States Consul-general, the Captain of the Port of Havana, and the Minister of l\Iarine all nil vised against the proposed plan, a.I though the permission to carry it ont conld be readily obt.1iued. I therefore det,ermined to establish it at.Tortugas, aml for that purpose visited the locality and placed the gauge near the fO'rt at Garden Key. EYery op1lortn111ty was taken during the seasou to obtain the current obser\·ations, the only break of any length of time being about ten days, which time was required to go to New Orleans for bituminous coal, that at Key West, which it was propotoeed to purchase, having heen destroyed in the grea·t fire which devastated the city in the early part of April. When at anchor in the stream it was necessary to have, at all times, a good 1nessure of steam on the boilers, so that the anchor cou14 be weighed, aml the engines ctarted at a moment's notice, and for this reason hard coal could not be used. The 'veatber ill March and April was abnormally bad, stroug northerly winds and heavy seas prevailigg most of the tin1e, and indeed, the whole season was entirely dift'erent from the year before. Tile mean maximum and minimum temperatures for the two years were:

UNITED 8TAT}f}S COAST A:'.'TD GEODETIC SURVEY.

The winter of 1885-'86 in the Bahamas and at Ke.r West was said to ham been more severe than ever before known, fish in vast numbers being killed or benumbed on the shoals. In 18851 during April and l\f ay, there was rarely a <la;y on wbich rain di<l not fall, while in 1886 we scarcely had one shower during either month. These are but signs of different coD11itions of the elements in the two years. ·Without having the meteorological record of a number of years to wbich to refer, I think, from the local evitlence, we may conch1de that 188() was abnormal an<l 188J was uearly a normal year: The Gulf Stream currents of the past season showed mauy erratic features, as if influenced hy something which did not follow any regular Jaw. This season there were three current meters on board of tbe same pattern as those used last year.· The observations were taken in the same manner, except that one meter was used for the surface and another for the subsurface currents, but frequently interchanged. This increased the rapidity with which the data for any depth was obtained. The meters were allowed to register, for the surface one hour aud for the others tilirty minutes, except the first set after anchoring, when they were thirty miuutes for the surface and twenty minutes for 15 and 30 fathoms, theise being shortened so as to ha Ye a complete set at the start as soon as possible. In the anchoring gear an accumulator of 13 feet was used, and a distance-line of steel-wire rope attached to the boom end, which was of sufficient length to allow the accumula~or ruhbers to compress about 52 feet (which was about their limit of elasticity), tbe pressure being about 15,000 pounds. Any greater strain than this was taken by the distance-line, the boom at that time lleing at an angle of 30°. With any angle grnater than this the topping-lift and distauce1iue would have to bear a less strain than there was on the anchoring wire, hut with a less angle the strain on the former would be rapidly multiplied. Instead of a pulley at the masthead for the topping lift, a pendulum 3~ feet long was substituted. The accumulator was shackled to the lower end of this, leading forward, and the after leg of the topping-lift leading aft. The variations in strain vibrated this pendulum slightly, but still practically made only a dowu thrust on the mast. This was used instead of the pulley, as last yea-r, to obviate the danger of stranding the topping-lift by the continuous slight bending backward and forward ornr the pnlle,y, due to the variation of the strain. · At the 11eel of the anchoring boom a ball and socket-joint was substituted for the goose-neck hinge, and although the currents this year were at times stronger than last, there were no signs of its giving way. The pawl-bitt, which took the thrust of the boom, was strengthened by a long jack-screw thrusting forward, thus transferring a part of the strain on the bitt to the deck beams f'.irther aft. The system employed in ancboring, and the use of the rubber accumulator to support the boom end, enabled us to detect at once if the vessel dragged, and also to determine something of the relative strength of the currents. With a stronger subcurrent than on the surface, the vibrations of the anchoring wire would be great. '.Ihe vibrations sometimes seeme<l to commence far below the surface, and increased from being just perceptible to very violent. If' the anchor dragged but was clear, tlie boomjum1lecl violently; but if it was foul, and dragging crown first over sand, the tremble was easily distinguished, and the cam1e assigned correctly. In making a discussion of the most salieut features in the observations ohtained this season I shall also include those of last year, in order to show the agreement between the two. It is impossible, however, in so short a time. to do more than give but a. partial revitiw, as the press of other duties prevents. · The study alone of the influence of the winds and barometer on the Gulf Stream, will require iu itself a long time, arnl very much more than I can give to it. I hope, however, that some of the emiuent gentlemen of America who ham made tides and currents a life-long study, may biJ given the opportunity to solve the many p1·oblems I lea\'e untouehe<l, for which I believe in the observations obtained there will be found sufficient and trustworthy data. At the instance of Prof. Hem·s Mitchell, I made an experiment for the purpose of conftrming the observations of the current met~r. A uumber of yeara ago he made some investigations iu

the Gulf Stream to ascertain tlie velocity Qf 1he sullmurents hy floating two pair;.; of 8pheres, ono pair with the lower sphere weighted mid suspended at \arious distances below its matl', a1ul tbo otber pair tloatiug in the upper strata.. Tlwy always maintained the same velocity, from wliich be concluded that 1hc cnrreut from surface to bottom was flowing with like Bpeecl. He suggPsted, therefore, that, while lte <lid not doubt the direct evideuce of m..r current meter, it would lit· well to try the experiment he did. The meter shows fbat on tLe east sl<le of tLe stream (Statiou 51 the difference of ihe wlocity at the snrfaee anu at 130 fathoms is rare1y Olle-half knot, and tbt· curreut at G5 is faster tlian at 15 or 30 fathoms. It shows also that on nll statious there are ti met<, and uearly e\-ery day, when the current at the surface ii:; rnuuing lees than at 15 fathom:;;, ;10 fatlloms, or eYen G5 fathoms. In making m;r trial, therefore, I selected a time when the current meter indicated a very slight current at. 130 fathoms. Two oil barrels were fasteue'l together by it piece of steel wire (Xo. 16 gauge) 14.0 fathoms loug, The lower barrel was weighted so that the upper one was about 3 inches out of water. The sea was perfectly smooth, and for the ih'st lialf of the time there was no wiud, and after that only a ,·ery gentle breeze. These were 1rnt overboard, aud akngside the surface barrel a pair of cans was dropped, the lower one being suspended 4 fathoms below the surface. Most of the officers on board declared that so great was tlie wake of the floating barrel, that its mate 1·!0 fathonm down must be anchored iu t11e uottom. The angle between Fowey Rock& Ligbt-House and Cape Floriua al1d the hearings were continually changing (we were about 8 miles distant from the former), hut I took a. soundiug close alougsi<le the barrel, aud fouud 2C5 fathoms. The surface pair was iu the mean time fast drifting out of sight. The means of fixing the relative positions of the two pairs was of course rather iuaccurate for so short a drift, but the fact was <lemonstratetl that the smface pair waa going at about twice the speed of the other. ·- I :slmll take up the various portions of this report ou the ousenatious in the following order: I. Gtmeral characteristics of the Gulf Stream as developed by the obsen·ations. IT. Daily variation of the stream. III. Monthly variation of the stream. IV. Axis of the stream. Y. Effect of wind on the velocity of the stream aml the posit10u of its axis. VI. Depth of the f;Jlream anti rnlocity at different depths. VII. General summary with rules for the guidance of navigators.

I. In my report of last year's observations iu the same wa~ers, I couclu<led that there wal:l a daily variation of the stream, that there was a monthly variation, aud that the axis ')f the stream was not situated at the point at which it was genera'ly supposed. I barn St.'en nothing in this year's observations which lJas caused me to re\'erse the conc1usions of last year or to mollify them, and I think I can girn predie.tions on these points with a degree of exactness quite suftkicut for the needs of the navigator. With such a vast body of \Vater, subject to so man:r influeuces, ,-ariatfons will always exist from causes far removed from its immediate vicinity, aud for which no allowance can b~ made by the navigator, for want of knowledge of tbcir existence. Prediction can be IJased upon tlrn date and the declination, phase, and meridian passage of tlie moon, throwing ont of consideration tho }lOSsible weather in the Atlantic aml Gulf of Mexico. The regular variation of the stream consists of a daily change in velocit.Y amou:Jting at timea to 2A knots. This difference in rate has taken place within three or four houn~, as if a large wa n1 traveled up the stream, its front face being steep and its rear less inclined. The cbauge has heeu seen to be accompanied by a tide rip when the wiud wail favorable for its formation, arnl williin five minutes the speed of thecnrrent advanced over one-half a knot. Aii a rule all ,·adations aro more excessive on the surface than at a lower depth, and on t11e western side greater than on tlw eastern. When the current is running at its maximum, the surface is very mnch faster thau any current below; but when at its minimum the spce1l at JO fathomg, and sometimes at even lower depths, down to 65 fatl1oms, lR faster than at the surface.

UNITE'I> STATES COAST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

II. I append herewith several plates (Nos. 23 to 28) showing the observations taken in the. Gulf 2'tream during 1885as well as 1886. In order to indicate tltevariations to the eye more readily, I have contrac~ted the ordinates representing days to about the same space as those representing knots, but for use in making calculations for mean curves :ill observations were represented on a scale five times as large as this. These plates also show the declination of the moon in a continuous curve, north declination beiug about the middle line and south declination below. Above the middle line is shown a curve which is the mean of all tbosebelow. This mean curve was made by taking the a'·erage of tlie readings for eactr deptlJ at each l1our on the curves on the lower half (or rather the similar ones on tlte large scale). 'l'he solid black Jines are the actual means thus obtained.· The dotted black lines are supposed curves, and will be explained further on. Referring to plates 23 and 24 (the observations of 1885), it will be noticed that the difference of time of the saccessive maximum velocitie'l is about twenty-five hours, the average being 2411 52m. The time of this maximum flow, when it comes before the upper transit of the moon, is indicated by the left-hand edge of the shaded space. The right IJand edge ·of the shaded space shows the time of the upper transit of the moon. Sometimes the maximum daily flow takes place after the · upper transit of the moon. The time of this is represented by the pa-rallelogram to the right of the shaded space. In the observations taken, however, there were but four times in the two seasons when the ,-elocity was greater after the transit than it was before the precediug or sac'. ceeding tran!'its. There is, l10wever, on nearly eYery day an increase of Yelocity at this time followe<l by a decreased speed. The shaded space and the open parallelogram represent what may be called the establishment of the Gulf Stream at this point. The aYerage of the former is 911 91n before and the latter 311 36m after the upper transit. This establishment is taken from the mean curve as found from the observations in the manner described, on the supposition that the mean flow of the stream truly represents the average flow of the surface current. This, however, may not be absolutely true, from the fact that obserrntions on one station may baYe been taken at a time when the conditions effecting tile rnriarions were exerting their influence toward a maximum tlow at, say, the surface, antl at a11other time tlie reverse. It is thought, bowever, that the average of the mean curves does represent Yery uearly the average of the surface as to time of the fluctuations; near enough, certainly, for all practical purposes for the navigator. The variation in 'Velocity in the surface current is yer·y much greater than in any of the subcurrents, aucl cousequently the mean does not represent this. The time of the establishment of the surface currents is found to be, by the observations taken, 9 11 07ro, differing but two minutes from that obtaiued from average of the means. In 1885 observations were taken at one anchorage (Station I) as loug as possible~ in order to gain a knowledge of the law of Yal'iations. iluring the past year the endeavor has been made to Yary 'the stations as much as po~sible to ascertain the relative streugth at different points. Referring again to plates 23 aud 2J, it will be noticed, particularly at No. 1 station (on the western side of the stream), that the meau curves, when the observations are continuous for mol'e than twenty·fonr hours, are very regular,.with a high maximum about !)h before and its lower 1na.xi· mum about 3 11 30m after the upper transit. As sfatecl before, the first maximum is greater tbau the second, except on four days, the most noticeable being on May 14, 1885. It has been thought that 1irobably this variation to the rule ishould. come when the declination of the moon changes its name, in the same manner as the tides at some places iu the Gulf of Mexico miss one high tide at this time, when the lower maximum becomes tite higher; but tlie ,·ariations in the Gulf Stream seem to follow .some other law. The observations, I fear, nre not sufficiently numerous to determine these questions with certainty, but from those we l1ave it seems that the exception doe.s not come at any fixed declination, but does coiucide most singularly to the fall and change of the moon. In the obsen'ations in May, 1885, on No. 1 station, until the 13th day the position of the diurnal and semi.diurnal waves caused the first maximum velocity to be the lesser of the two. On May 13 they hatl about the same ,·elocity, and on the following day the maximum velocity, which shou1u have arrived about nine hours before the moon's transit, was altogether wanting, and the one arriving after the transit was -very liigb. This was on the day of the new moon and the fourth day after the change of declination from south to north.

285

The next connected series of observations commenced on May 23, when we find the highest maximum was before thfl upper transit, but also before the lower maximum instead of after. The day previous to the next full moon, which was flxe days after lhe change of declinatiou, we found the two high Yelocities about equal. ObserYations at No. 1 station were broken then in t:ons(·quence of bad weather, but the record on No. li station 011 this day gaYe a Yery marked cmT«, descending more abruptly than at any other time at this place, and the, highest point nine !Jonrl' before the transit. This was seemingly as if the second maxim nm (the one following the preyiou~; transit) bad been missed. Ou l\Iay 1 and 2, 1886, bad weather prevented the observations just at the time when most important, but tlrn ending of position 11 au<l the beginning of No. 1 m (plate 26) indicated that tl1~· Yelocities before anll after the transit were about equal. This was thirty-six hours after the change in declination, and the new moon followed about twent.y-four hours later. The day before the next full moon on Station 2 the maximum velocities wcr.e about equal on the third day after the change of <leclinatiou, and on the uay of the full, on Statiou 1~', the maximum before the transit is wanting. It seems possible, therefore, from the few obsen"ations we have, that the change of form of this curve of currents takes place on tbe day of full and change of the moon, that at the time of new moon the highest maximum is omitted and the lower one increased, but only for the day, the next max;imum arriving at its proper time. The shape of the curve then changes, the smaller wave going on the other side of the larg·er. I onJy draw ~-our attention to this coincidence as a. possible solution of this variation in the stream, but at the same time there are .some reasons for the supposition that the change in the form of the curve follows the declination. In onle1· to show the agreement between the isolated observations taken on Station 1 in 1885, I ham inse1·ted between them s<>me supposed cunes in dotted Ulack lines. The supposed curves, howernr, are actual ones taken from the observations at some other time in the month, and either iuserted direct or rcrnrsed, according as the daily means were increasing or decreasing. It will I.le noticed that the dotted curves seem to fit perfectly, and in passing those of other stations the maximum and minimum velocities coincide with great exactness. Commencing with May 3, 188J, to connect a few bours' observationi;i taken on Station 1" with those of No. P, the supposed curn· was taken from 1· and ]t and reversetl. On May 10 the supposed and actual maxima agree ill tillle although not in velocity, on the 9th and 8th the supposed is nearer the average in point of time than the observed. On May 5 no observation was taken at the time of greatest velocity, but the curves on No. 5· and 4" point to a. maximum at the same time that the supposed curve of No. I station. The latter on May 3 arrives at a point which is higher than the actual observatiomi . on Station 1", but coinciding with the proper" establishment;' of 9 hours before the upper transit of the moon. Between 1', ld, and 1' stations a supposed curve has been inserted, using 1 1 for the purpose. The agreement between it and the actual observations is very close, as will be seen. So on May 28, the cun·e connecting No. 1' and l! in passing the curve of Station 5'. The observations of March and April of this year, while they are so few and for only short lengths of time, nevertheless show an agreement with the others in the time of the maximum flow, and are valuable for that purpose. The variations iu the current are much greater Oil the west side of the stream than on tho east, the av~rages of all tlte wlrnle da_ys oil each station being as fallows:

That is, on No. 1 station the mt·a11 nll'i:ition of the surface current iu twenty-fl. rn 1lays' observations was 1.17 knots. III. In addition to the <lail~' rnriation there is a <lecided change during the month. 'fhe surface observations taken at No. 1 station ha ye bee11 averaged for each day and plotted on' platl' 27, with the velocity as the ordinate and the mean declination of the moon for the day as thti abscissa.

is most complete for the reason, as previously Rtated, that observations were m;ule continuous for as loug a period as possible, while during the latti>r year the position of tlte veRsel was sbifte<l frequentlJ. 'l'he average of the mean cUr'l'es has also bee11 plotted in the sauie waj' and found to agn:e with the average of tile surface in form, l>ut, of course, with a lower ,·elocity. It will be seen that in May, 1885, iu which month mm;t of the observations were taken, tile curve takes an upwa;·d turn just before the greatest southern declination, and, reaching its maximum a day or two after, drops to a speed of abcrut 2~ knots, which it maintains as the declination changes from south to north. In 1886 tlm obserrntions available (from their continnity) for this purpose show the same lityle of cmTe, with northern declination, bnt very much lower than the previous year in point of spee<l; bnt this occurre<l just at the time of the abnormal condition of weather in the early part of May. The currn of 18oG, it is possiule, may be uormal, but it seems as if the-portion above so north declination shoul<l be rernln~<l upwar<l, pivotiug on the point of the curve representing the current at May 20. Confirming t!Jis view (that the cur\'O is uot normal), attention is drawn to the fact that on the predous year, on May 14, the current at the same station was 2~ knots, with about 140 uorth declination, which agreed within less than two-tenths of a knot of the speed, with the 1ame southern declination, and that the former indicated by its form only a tendency to fall a trifle, in the same wa.v that iu the latter it was found to fall before the great rise, as the moon approache<l its greatest <leclination. IV. The 1iosition of tlte axis of the Gulf Stream, or the point at which the flow of the stream is 1trongest on tlie smface, is a matter of great importance to the navigator, and dnring this season I ha,'e endeavored to arrange the ouservations so that the question could be settle<l. I suppose that this term" axis" shoultl be cousilleretl to mean the point at which the greatest volume of water passes a given point in 1\ given time, but as this is of no value to mariners, a11tl as they do and will use the term most, I think· it best to apply the name to the point of maximum surface tlow, and for the other, to use the term "axis of volume." By last year's record I conclude<l that the axis was not at the position supposed by Professor Bache, but seemed to be on the west side iuiotea<l of east of the mid stream. I at last determined that it was somewhere between Stations 1 and 2, the first about 8 and the other 15 miles from Fowey Ifocks Light-House. I therefore occu· pied a station alJout mill way b(·tween them, which I IJelieve to be very near the position of greatest wurface velocity, or the axis. In changing stations to or from No. 1~ (the station on the axis) as quickly as pm;sible, it has invariably been found to have a greater Yelocity than the one with which it is compared, although the average of its twenty.four hours' observations may in some instances . Iiave been Jess than the others, in consequence of a rapid decline in velocity of the whole stream. I think in this case (as, for example, Stations 1 and 1~', May 21, 22, 23, of 1886), had I remained at Station 1', the cune of its surface current would have been at least half a knot below that at No. 1!'· Station 1' was just after the moon's greatest southern declination, when the current should have been running the strongest; No. 1~· was at the time when the decline in speed shoultl liave been alJrupt, an<l, besides this, something abnormal caused the maximum, both before and after the moon's transit of May 23, to be omitted. Upon ceasing observations at No. 1·, at 9h 15"' p. m. on May 22 1 the s1)eed of the surface current wa.5 2.78 knots. Two hours later, at No.1!, it was 3.cB knots, and after a slight increase it rapidly decreased. The mean surface current at the various stations is shown in the following table, together witl1 the number of hours used in obtaining the average and the distance from Fowey lwcks:

to 11 miles distant. Wl!ile tlte ,·elocity of the current at 7 miles <listaut may lie aud is at times great, it is by no means so sure as at 11 miles off sl!ore. At No. 1" station, on Ma~· 5, 6, 188G, the current was rernarkaul;y slow, at times running as little as three-tenths of a knot per hour. At 8 a. m., with a surface current of 0.75 knot per hour, I changed to No. 2 and No. 3 statious successfrely, returuing to No. 1 at 8 p. m. At the latter I found that the surface current had increased to 1.85 knots, but at No. 2 station I found the current to be from 3.2 knots to 3.7 knots and at No. 3 to vary from 2.4 to 2.7 knots. I believe, therefore, the axis of the Gulf Stream at this cross-section is situated at No. 1~ station, about 119- miles distant from Fowey Hocks. Tbe fact tlJat it is on the edge of tbe bank, where tile water mpidly 1lrepens from 200 to 400 fathoms, may be of value in drawing interrncPs as to tl\e axis at other poiuts of the stream, until WP\ know from actual obsernttions its exact locali y. V. The effect of wind on the Gulf Stream is, I think, believed to be most potent in changing· the position of its axis, as well as in banking up the current or accelerating its ,·elocit_y. In the observation:s I have taken in tl.Jc stream, or outside its limits on the·a<ljacent banks, I have found not the slightest evi<lence that the axis changes by the direct action of the wind to an extent discernible. Anchored on the edge of tLe adjacent banks with winds from certain drrections, the clear blue water of the stream is blown to\"l"ards the shore, but tl1e current does 11ot accompany it. On the Bahama side, the current is generally setting to the northward on the edge of tbe bank as far as 8 or 10 fathoms. On the Florida si<lf', auchored in tlrn line of the reefs, with a fresh SE. wirnl blowing directly on shore, there was 110 current. Anchore1l in the stream with winds from all directions, no change in the position of its axis was observed. At stations 5· and 4b I remained at anchor with quite strong winds from the northward and eastward. The currents at the surface and at 15 fathoms indicated a retardation, which I think was due to the 'wind. After leaving No. l', I steamed across the stream, but could not anchor because of the roughness of the sea. The current found in crossing, however, was less than it should ha·e been with normal conditions. On .May 2, 3, 4, and 5 the wind was almost continuously from the eastward, varying in force from 1 to 5 (Beaufort scale). The current on the west side, at Station 1, at this time, Imel the iocal wind a power to change the position of the axis by its direct force, would have been strong; but, iustead of that, it was so weak that for many hours we were actually riding to the wiud, which at that time had but a force of 1 and 2. The cause of this phenomenal current, however, I believe to ha\'e been the wind. At Station 1' on May 1 the currents were about normal in strength, hut vny irregular. On May 2 the upper strata dropped in velocity, while at 65 and 130 fathoms there was an inrreast-. On May o, at station 1", the average currents for the day were as follows: 1 - - - - · - - - - -·

The \ertical curve of this day's currents and the mean cune of 1886, as well as the curve of both years, embracing 555 hours at No. 1 station, are shown on plate 27. On May 6 an.I 7 the upper strata increasecl in velocity with great rapidity; tlJe lower strata decreasing. Referring to the vertical curves mentioued above, it will be noticed that at Station 1·, when the current was running slow at the surface, at 130 fathoms it was running at the same spee1l as the mean current for the two years, and faster than the mean of this year's observations; and that a. continuation of the curves below 130 fathoms to the bottom, shows a large rnlume of watPr at the lower depths hastening north as if to re-establish the equilibrium. It is said that durmg a norther, the Gulf Stream curl'ent along the Flo1i,la reefs, withi11 .io or 50 miles of Key West, sets very strong to the eastward, and at other times oue cannot depp111I upon finding a current in either direction. I J1ave no e\'ide11ce from my own observations that such is the case, but I can readily see that in tlJe confine(l waters of the Straits of Florida it might be true. A very strong norther woulll hank up the water on the Cuban side. In re-establishing the equi·librium the lower strata woultl set slightly toward the Florida. shore, and, coming to the surface

when it strikes the shoaler water make a strong current setting to tlie eastward, where is usually an intt>rmittent one. Tlle flame would not he true to such a. marked extent with an easterly gale in the Straits of Bernini, because the northeast Providence Channel would gfre relief to a portion of the lower strata, iu its endeavor to make to the eastward. I think that the popular belief, that the axis of the Gulf Stream changes with the wirnl, is almost wholly due to the hitherto unkuowu daily variations. A Commander starting across the stream \rJ1e11 it is running at its maximum would probably reach the opposite side in time to fiucl a less curreut. On another pasisage, if he happened to cross with reYerse conditions, the statement that the axis chaugeis woultl prnuably be verified to the sati!;faction of himself and his friends. My cou· du:sious arc, therefore, that any moderate wind does not alter the position of the maximum surface flow pC>rceptibly; that a strong wind blowing with or against the current will acceleraw or retard its Yelocitr somewhat, and that in the confined portions of the stream between Florida and Cuba or tlle llallamas a gale blowing at right augles to its axis may cause an increased velocity on the weather side; but of this last I have no positive evidence. · YI. The depth of the Gul( Stream current and the velocities at different depths: The vei·tical cunes, represeuting the velocities at different depths, are shown on plates 27 and 28. They :mi comstructecl 1zy taking the averages of the velocities at the various depths iind plotting them with their prover co-ordinates. The meau curves are constructed by giving the means a.t all depths 011 each of the stations equal mines, iustead of taking the average of all observations at each depth for the mean. The surface current at en~ry station hacl a higher \'elocity than at any lower depth. At times during tLe day, when the current was running at its lowest speed, the surface for a. short interval became slower than at 15 fathoms, but the average for the twenty-fotir bom·s was almost invariably higher. At stations No.1 aml No. ouly, was I able to obtain o\)servations uear the bottom, and at the former the 1mrrent was sometimes foun<l setting to tile southward. In 1885 this was not the case, except ouce or twilw, ai1<l then with scarcely perceptible currents, but tllis year it has been noticed se\·eral times. 'Ille mean curves of 1885 a11<1 l886, it will l>e be noticed, are nearly together at 05 fathoms; al>orn that depth there is a witle departure, the curves separating most at 30 fat11oms, and below G;j fathoms there is auotller departure. It seems from the vertical curves that at the bottom there is, at times, a current setting to the southward iu all parts of the stream, except on the extreme eastern side. The vertical enrves of all stations are plotted on plate 28, together with the curve of the bottom at cross-section A. The zero line of each YertiClll Curve is shOWU at j ts proper distance .(rom the shore Oll either &ide of the stream; but each cun·e is re-ml ved around its zero to a. position at right angles to the direction of the current. Observations were taken for practical purposes only as far as 130 fathoms, tbe <lata taken below that depth not being sufficient to combino with advantage. In order to give some idea of the strength of the currents below 130 fathoms, the curves hiwe been continued to zero velocity. These cur\'es, it will be remembered, are found from the average of a.ll obaerrntions at each depth at each station. The curve atNo.1 and No.12-' stations, situated 011 the i;lope, reach zero ,·elocity about 2;j fathoms from the bottom. Nos. 2 an<l 3 stations, it will he seen, arri\'c at zero at almost the same depth1:1, au<l No, 5 station continued, seems t-0 possess a current wh'iclt reaches to the bottom. Tbe obser\·atio~s takenon this station (~o. 5J during this year were io. March aud April aml under exceptiouahly unfavorable weather. Attention bas been drnwn to one of these under the lieading of the "Effect of wiud." A slight error would aflect ihe velocity at the bottom considel'ably, and it is possil.ile that actually there is a.less current than shown. The question as to whether the lower strata of water is moUonless, or whether it has a movemeut north or south, my obser"a1.ions do not show a.bsolutely, except on No. 1 station, where at 130 fathoms 1~ southerly current was found at times. The form aml position of this curve changes continually; sometimes, as on Station Jf, with a cousidernllle Yelocity at the bot.tom, aud again, aa on 1°, with a most decided southerly set at 130 fathomis. I believe that at all the stations the current to the northward may at times reach m~ur the bottom, bat at Nos. 2, a, nml 4 it rarely does.

At Nos. 1, 1;1, 2, 4, and 5 stations dredgings haYe !wen made aud more or le;;s mml brnught up, except at No. 5, where the dredge sLowed nothing but broken branch coral with a fr"· :small shells. The curYes of the various stations taken from west to east liecome more aud more 11early wrtical, and the point bel&w the surface at wliich the current maintains about the sarne Yelocit,\extends farther down. .At No. l station the swelliug ou the curve is but little~ aml is llenn·e11 l:J and 30 fathoms. On No. 5 it is at 6.'.i fathoms. Ou all stations the Yelocit.y at the surface is greate1· than at auy depth below, but with 01w C·l two exceptions the record of tile means indicates that a stratum of water helow tl1e imrface is rn0Yi11~ at a slightly greater speed thnn a stratum at some point llet\Yeen it and tl1e surfaee, aJHl abo grt>att·r than the water below. It indicates that the volume of this stra,tum increases at the different statiun" from west to east. It is probable that on No. 5 station, wliere the current at G.i fal11om,; i" greater than at H> or 30 fatlwms, if observations could be taken at 300 fathoms the cmTe11t "\\Onlil he found to lrnve decreased some\\· hat, so as to gh·e greater iuclinatiou to the cmTe. The vari-ation in the curves near the snrfacc will vrolmbly be found to follow \Try closely tu the meau change of temperature in the .Atlantic Ocean. The cun·e of No. 1~ station near the surface seems to lie abnormal, antl prob;1 l1iy a form :1pproximatiug to that of No. l station would lJe nearer the true one. Tl1e upper half of i1Jate 28 shows the cross-section with enrves iudica!iug- the limits-of each . stratum of water from zero to the maximum current, by increments of one half knot, as de,·eloped from tbe cnrHs on the lower half of the sheet. The space from each extreme-station (Nos. 1 auu 5) to the shore is didde<l proportionatel5·, under the supposition that the decrease of the current shoreward is regular.

THE SECULAR VARIATION OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND AT SOME FOREIGN STATIONS.
[New 3ncl grt=>atly enl:ngf'.fl p(\ition. J

By CHARLES A. SCHOTT,

AB·istant, Coast a11cl Gl'Odelic S11rveg.

[Sixth ctlitiou, AJlril, ltJ:'ii.]'
IN'l'RODUCTION.

The practical nature of the inquir,y, and the nece8sitJ· of looking to the publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to supply the latest information on the subject of the changes, secular and otherwise, of the direction of the magnetic needle, lias caused an ever-increasing derualJ(l for these investigations of the survey, and this has acted again as a stimulus to advance our knowledge of the secular changes of .the magnetic force, both for direction and iutensity. It tlrnf> becomes necessary every few years to re-discuss or submit to analysis any additional observations, as wen as to direct such observations to be made at ti.Jose places where tlle;r may contribute most effectively towards the elucidation of the laws of cha11ge. Appendix No. G, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1885, contains au exhaustive. article on tbe secular change of t'he magnetic dip and the magnetic intensity, as observed in the Unite<l States from the earliest to the present time. It is accompanied by three maps, showing the actual distribution of these magnetic elements for the epoch 1885-0 · This, together with tbe present communication, completes the inquiry in this branch of knowledge by bringing it up to date. During the fh·e years which ha>e elapsed since the last issue of this paper the available material for the discussion of the secular variation of tbe declination has greatly increased, bringing up the number of stations contained in this edition to 94 and the number of declinations to. 1071, for each of which full reference is given, as well as a comparison of tbe observed and computed values. The average number of observations for a station is 11. It is satisfactory to remark that this increase of observations was found greatly to improve the values of the analytical expres~ sions, giving greater accuracy to the results deduced and tending to greater uniformity in Rud~ phases of the secular variation as the amplitude of the motion and the epochs of maxima and minima or times of magnetic elongation, all of which depeml on the geographical position of tlw stations.
·This article originally appeared in Coast Survey Report for 1859, Appendix Ko. 24, pp. 296--305. In the 8~cotHl etlition, iu Coast Survey Report for 1874, Appendix No. 8, pp. 72-lO!:l, the investigation appears greatly extended; tlt" substitution of a. ~ine for a cosine function was made and the epoch was changed from 1830 to 1E50; tth<o some "'"'· was made of Cauchy's method of interpolation for the establishment of some second periodic terms. The third edition, il!Sued in June, 1879, appeared in pamphlet form, an<l is not contained in any annual report of the Coast and Gcoil<'i ie Survey. The geographical range of the investigation was much enlarged, and the paper was illustrated uy two plates. The next or fourth edition was brought out in June, l&ll, and forms Appendix No. !J, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1879, then passing through the press; it was illustrated with three plates. In the fifth editi<>n, of November 1882, Appendix No. 12, Report for 1882, there were discns.'!ed 837 declinations, observed at 82 statious, sit 11ated in tbti United States and a few in Europe, South. America, Asia, and Polynesia, the latter for thn purpose o( <extending our knowledge of magnetic changes beyand our imme<liat.e ~cacoaRt.

;_TNITEH STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SUHVEY.

In Urn collection of ollt'ened dedi11atious, as heretofore given, I had sparingly made use of ohscn-ations taken ou board ship, introducing such observations only from necessity, i.e., in the absence of olJservations 011 land; hut in the prese11t discussion trnstwortby observations made at Bea ha Ye been more freely introclnced, and in the case of the great number of obsen-atious by Spani:sh navigators towards the close of the past century, along our Pacific coast, their united testimony has greatly benefited our range of knowledge by giving greater security and unity to results which before appeared doubtful or scattered. The collection of tbis material is contnined iu Appemlix No. 7, Coastancl Geodetic Suryey Report for 1885, and was comml!-nicated by Assistant G. Daviclson. Its >alne was then conjectural, but the present discussion of it proved to be Liglily crNlitable to the Havigators of that period. I fintl the aYerage probable uncertainty* of a declination (niriation of com11ass) ob1:1en·ed on board the wooden hulls of those times not to exce!:'d ± 10, the same ns I had assigned to tlie observations taken by Vancouver, an amount wl1ich Jlrobably represents the liest practice of that epoch, Jn onr own times, for Yessels composed of iron and steel, and otherwise largely supplied with such metal, when swung on, say, 8 or 32 equidistant points of the compass, the observed declination "°ill fitill be subject to a probable nncertainty of about ± 0°.5 to ± oo.3 The immediate object of the discussion of the secular cbange of the declination is to furuisll the means of rderring obse1Ted declinations from one epoch to another, as, for instance, "When i:mn-e~·on; are requireJ to re-trace and re-discover old lines original!J· run by compass, but which had become oblitnated in the course of time, or when the variation is de!llanded for the compasses placed on the sailing, coast, aud harbor charts of the survey. The principal demand for tbe re· sults of this article comes from surveyors and membcni of the legal profession, and frequently arises from litigation in cases of disputed land boundaries; aud since the source where such infor· rnation could be ba<l became uetter known, the number of applications to the survey for assistance has increased from year to year. To facilitate refereuce to stations and result~, the conteuts of tlle paper are arranged in tbree parts - an eastern, middle, and western division-in which the places· follow approximately in geographical order; and the final tables, or ephemerides, give"the tleclinations, after the rrar 1~50, for <'Ver,y fifth year, instead of for eYcry tenth as in former editions. To render this investigation more useful to practical meu, I have thought it desirable to preface it with a brief account of the principal motious, systematic as well as apparently irregular, to which the direction of tbc magnetic needle lias been found subject, in order to clearly separate and distinguish these changes from the secular Yariation, which last is here the special object of treatment. The magnetic declination.-Tbe magnetic declination (or Yariatiou of the compa·s, as it '"as formerly called hy surve:yors and still is uy navigators), at any placf', is the angle contained between two vertical planes, one being the astronomical or true meri<lia n, and the other a plane in which the horizontal axis of a freely suspended magnet lies at the time. The former plane is fixed and the latter ''ariable, since it is found that the needle is generally in a state of slow or tremulous motiou. The magnetic declination varies with res1)ect to space and time; it is, there· fore, necessary to gh-e with the statement of its measure tlte exact time (year, day, and hour) when au olisern1tiuu \fas made, as well as the geographical posit10n of the p!ace (tlle latitude and longitude to tbe 11earest minute of arc will suffice). The declination is caJled "west" wht>n tile north end of the magnet points to tbe west of true north; algebraically this.fact is indicated h_v a + sign, and if "cast" b;v a - sign. It is a matter of obserYation that the mnguet, "·be11 light aml delicately suspended (by a single fi her of raw silk) is seldom or 1iever at rest, but is always shifting its dircctiou, or is iu a state of oscillatio11 or of tremor, or it ma~· be suliject to ,,;u<lden change1>. These augulnr motious haYe been classified as regular (periodic) and irregular rnriations, auJ of tlic!'c WP. propose to notiec briefly the principal ones, imch as may generally be exhibited will.iiu the limits of tl!c enited States. Tbe solar.ditffna.l ntriation cousists in a s_ystematic movement of tlle magnet, 1.JaYing for its period the 8olar day. Its phases depend ou local time and its character is the same for tbe greater part of the uortheru hemisphere; ,·iz, about the time of sunrise the ~wrtk encl of the needle it>

generally found approaclliug to or 11c.u· its rnoi;t ca~tcrly deflecti011 or elongation from the m:ignetic meridian. This phase happens, for iustance, at Philadelphia, on th£· yearly m·erage, about 7;1 1' a. m.; at Key \Vest, Fla., about 8ih a. rn.; aud the same at l\Iadison, ·wis. lt is subject to an annual variation, being about three-quarters of an hour later in the wontLs when the sun is south of the equator, and about one-half of an hour eal'lier in the summer mouths than its ;y('arly an·rage time of occurrence. The north end of the 11eeclle then begins its principal daily motion; ancl reaches the opposite extreme position, or its western elongationi about half past 1 o'docli p. m. It is reached a few minutes earlier in summer and a few minutes later in \Tiuter, amlhardly nuies half an hour for different localities. After this epoch the ueedle takrs up au easterly movement and gradually returns nearly to the direction from which it set out in the morning. Frequently au interruption, 01· small reversed motion, is exhibited <luring tLe night. At Pl.liladelpbia the average dail;y direction is reached in summer about lO:P a. m. and in winter about lO~h a. m., aud generally within l.lalf an hour of these times at other lllaces. The magnetic meridian is crossed a second time, generally between 7 and!) p. m. 'l'he angular range between the morning ::md afternoon elongations, or tlie <liurn:il range, is about 81 on the arnrage at Philadelphia and about 5~1 at Ke~' \Yest; in bigfa:r magnetic latitn<les it is more, iu lower less. This range is subject to an annual inequality, being much more conspicuous in summer than in winter (10~' at l'hiladelpuia in August autl G' in NoYewber). It is furtuer subject to a periodic inequality related to the eleYen-year cyc!e of the suu·spots. It is least iu ,years of minimum sun-spots (as in 18i8 and 188i {~), for instance) aml greatest in years of ~aximnrn sun· spots (as in 18i0 and 1883), the factors being 0.1 and 1.3, al.lout, of the a\'erage amount of the;,e years respectively. This daily Yariation appears at times intensified, at other times enfeebled, and during Hie winter months there are occasionally days on which it cannot be recognized. Observations must be corrected for time of da~· in order to reduce the result to the anrage direc~ion of the twenty-four hours; a table given for this purpose is found in Coast and Geodetic Surwy Report for 1881, .Appendix No. 8, Art. 6. The annual rnriation of the declination is so small that a mere mention of its existence suffices; its amplitude is at most· 1:} minute!'< of arc. The variation depeudiug on tli.c solar rotation has a ])eriod of about twenty-six tlays; its amplitude is likewise small in our latil ude. Ti:c lunar inequalities: These we also pass over on account of their small amplitude. The principal inequality is the lunar diurnal variation exhibiting the peculiarity of two maxima and two miuima ou each lunar day. The range of this inequality at Philadelphia is about 27", and at Toronto, Canada, abont 38''· Otuer lunar inequalities are of yet smaller order. Tltc seculai· variation of the magnetic declination, our subject proper, is most prol.mlJly also of a periodic character, but since it requires centuries for its full development, an<l since, as yet, no one cyolc has actually been completed within the range of observation, we arc obliged, in the auscnce of any reliable theory, to follow up the JJbenornena by continuous observations. The secular motion may be com1)areu with a wave motion or with an oscillation of a peudulum which comes to rest momentarily at its extreme positions or elongations and morns fastest mid way lx"tween tuese extremes. Smaller variations within this period have also been detected, but the general angular movement (say of the north end) of the magnet may be described as follows: About the times of maximum deflection the magnet appears almost stationary or onl.r slowly oscil· lating about the same average direction for several years (as observed uy ordinaQ' or rough iu:;trn· me.nts); soon, however, the effect of the secular change becomes perceptible, increasing gradual!~-. year hy year; this progressive angular motion soon reaches an anunal maximum value, after wltieh, stilt mol'ing in the same direction, it slowly dimiuislrns in speed and finally becomes again stationars, now at the opposite extreme digression, after which possibly it will return again to its first position. Within the area of the Unitecl States aud south of latitude 49° a complete oscillation of this kind may require between two and a half and three and a half centuries, during wbich time the magnet would swing twice, i. e., once forward and once back ward, through an arc of seYeral degrees, generally keeping within the limits of 40 and so of total range for our geograpl!ieal boundaries; in otller localities the period ancl range are Yery much greater. The remarkable regularity of the motion is well shown on the accom11anying diagram for Paris, France, for which place we pr·obably possess the Ioi;tgest series of obser,·ations; the period is about four and two-third cen-

t uries, aml tl1e mnge nearly 330, To illustrate further the effect of the secular change, we may take th(· case of New York City. In this locality the needle was observed to be in nearly a stationary condition about 1682, its north end pointing then fully 90 to the west of north; it then moved ('asterlJ' and reached its easternmost digression about 1799, showing at, that time only 4:\o west decliuatio11. Ever 8ince this epoch the motion bas been we8terly, its present value being nearly 81° ,V.; the grelltest aunnal change (u('arly 5') was apparently passed about the middle of the ceutnry. The times of these stationary epochs are di:flerent at different localities; the last epoch of eae;ten1 elongation was noted earliest in Maine towards the close of tile past century, later in tl1e ..'\Iississippi Valley, and it Las now 1eached the coast of California and 'Vashington Ter1itory. At present over nearly the wllole of the United States the effect of the secular change is to increase west <leclination, or (what is the same) to decrease em;t declination; but on imrts of the Pacific coast and for some s:hort distance in the interior the effect is still opposite, Yiz, an ,increase of <ast uec1inatio11. Alaska, bowewr, is to be excepted; tbere easterly (leclimition is now slowly decreasing. 'l'here must, consequeutl.v, be a region or belt of no change at present, wh;ch will be referred to in detail further on. It is this regular motion, known as the secular variation, which renders it nece;;;:sary to reconstruct isogonic charts from time to time and to change the compasses and magnetic bemings on our charts. Although this 8ecular nuiatiou is perfrctly systematic it may not always appear so, especially when deduced from few observations made at diflereut places in the same ge11eral locality, eitller on account of small observing error:s or in consf'quence ;:,f local deflections, or for the rellsou that ordinary periodic variationH and ill('qualities have not been fully elimiuateu from the results. Among the latter irregularities must be classed the1llag11etic disi'urbmwes or storms.-These may occur at any time, ancl are, when taken indiYidually, he~'ond the power of prediction; but attacked by the statistical method, i.e., when classified and when averages arc taken of many t:housands, they are found to be subject to various laws. Their presence is generall;r indicated by sudd{'Il deflections, and by rapid and great fluctuations iu the direction of the needle aR compared with its normal position, which otherwise might have been ex1Jected at that time of day aml month. They often take place simultaneously over distant regions of the globe, and iu tluration may be confined to a few hours,·or they may last a day or even for several days. They are frequently accompanied by auroral lights and hy strong electric earth. currents. 'VLeu aual,yzed in large m11nliers they ex.hibit a sohn-dinrnal variation, the westerly and easterly distmbances, howfl·er, following different laws. They also have an annual variation and seem to depeud large]~' on the sun.spot period or an elen·n-year cycle. Irrespective of direction of tLe disturbing forces the most disturbed lionrs of the day are generally those between 7h and lOh "" m., and the least disturbed tLose bet\"l'een 21> and (jh p. m. 'Vesterly dii>tmbances occur most frequently about 81' a. m. and least about 8 1' p. m.; they exhibit a single daily progression. Easterly disturl1ancl"s J'('acl1 a maxim urn about si. p. rn. antl a minimum about 2i. p. n1.; they exhibit:a double daily progression. "'el'terly and earterly disturbances appear to agree iu their ammal variation, in their times of maxima, i.e., in August, September, and October, and iu their times of minima, i. e., in January aud June. The tlisturbances are most frequent and considerable in the years of maximum sun-spot activity and the reverse in years of minimum sun-spots. The following table of the obserwd disturba11ces, in a bi l1ourly series at Philadelphia in the years 1840 to 1845, will give an idea of t:heir relative frequency and magnitude:

UNITED STATES COAST A:!\D GEODETIC SUHVEY. We now proceed to the consideration of the secular variation of the magnetic <lediuatio;.:.

Historical note.-The foilowing brief historical remarks on tile magnetic declinatiou awl it;;
secular variation have been prepared from extracts from Huwboldt's Cosmos (Otte's translation, Lond011, 1849-1858), Vol's II and V; from the Encyclo11redia Britannica, 9th edition, Art. Com pas::;, vol. VI (Boston, 1877), and from E. ·walker's treatise "Terrestrial and Cosmical .Magnttit>m," Cam bridge (Englancl), 18GG, in which works fuller references will be found. The Encyclop~tlia of Experimental Philosopb;y, London, 1848, Art. !IIa~uetism, as well as Gehler's l'!J~·sikali:<cl11>;; 'Vi.irterbuch, Leipzig, 1825, Art. Compass, were also coni'ulted. The first notice of tlrn magnetic needle tis applied to navigation we meet with among weskm (European) nations does not date further back than the deve11th or twelfth century of our era, lmt in China the directive property of the magnetic needle was made u1>e of on land as early as tlle twelfth centur.r B. C., and, according to tradition, even at a Yery much earlier time (2634 B. C.). In the third and fourth centuries of our era Chinese rnssels were guided by tlrn magnetic needle. and through them a knowledge of the polarity of the needle was conveyed to India and thenct· westward. In the ninth centurJ' Cbinese merchautg traded in ship8 to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Probably through the influence of Ara\Jian navigators, or tl.lrong·h the agency of tLe Crusaders, the use of the mariners' compass was introduced into Eastern Europe. Among the first European writers oftbe middle ages who refer to ti.Jc loadstouc or to the compass is tbc Icelaudic historiau, Are Frode, who lived about the end of the eleventh crnturj·. Ile states that the directive property of the loadstone was then known to seamen in i1orthern countries. Next are mentioned, Alexander Neckam, in two treatises, ''De Utensililms" and "De Naturis Iterum/' of the twelfth century, Guyot, of Provins, in 1190, and Jaques de Yi try, uetwCl'll 120± and 1215. Hayrnond Lully, in 1272 and 1286, remarks that the seamen of 11is time employed the magnetic needle, an<l from Torfruus we learn that the compass was in use among the Norwegians abont tl.ie middle of the thirteenth century. Among then-western nations the construction of the instrument under"'°cut great improvements, particularly by 1he hands of Flavio Gioja, of Amalphi, Italy, in 1302. Tile declination.-From a Chinese work, written between 1111and1117 A. D., we learn tliat the needle was then suspended by a Hi.read aud that the mode of measuring the amount of the <leclinat.ion, it being then west (or, as there expressed, east of south), bad long been understood. It eau hardly be supposed that the fact of the needle, in general, not pointing exactly to the true north and south could have been overlooked in the twelfth ceutur.r, on the !llecliterranean, in places whPre t.he dec1ination reached 60 to 10°. A passage interpolated in a Pnris MS., a copy of "Epii<tola Petri Peregrini," &c., of 1269, states the c1eclination to have been determined by him in Italy at 50 E. Columbus probably was the first who records the change in the sign of declination with change of geographical position. On starting from the west coast of Spain he bad east declination. In September, 1492, in the Atlantic, in fatitnde 2so longitude 28° (about) be obserYed 110 W. He has also the merit of being the first to discover a part of an agonic line, or line of no cleclination. The first scientific work in Enropc in which the declination is treated at any length aml ue<1nce(l from actual observations is that by Boroughs, published iu Hi81, entitl('d "~.\.discourse 011 the Yaria. tion of tb.e Cumpas or l\fagueticall Needle,'' and is dedicated to the" travaillers and mariners of England." 1n 1599, Prince l\Iauriee, of Nassau, the 1onl bigh admiral of the Low Conn tries, reco111· mended t1eamen to keep a register of the declination iu every part of the worl<l they might Yisit. Isogonic charts.-The declination 0111.Y was marked on the chart of Andrea Dianco, drawn np in the year 1436, but Alonso de Santa C:mz, in lf">30, constructed the first general declination chart, though bas~<l upon very imperfect material. Upon the chart b~· Fatllcr Christopher Burrus (who died in 1632}, published at Lisbon, the magnetic Jines are called "tractus chalyboeliticos." About 170 years after Alonso de Santa Cmz, Ellm. lfalley puhlished his celebrated isogouic chart for thl' year 1700 1 based entil'elJ' upon observations. [Tabula Nantica, Yuriationum l\lag·netiearnm Iudex, juxta observationes anno 1700.] Bis rn_yages of the years 1G98, 169H, au<l li02 ·rere u11dertakP11 at the expense of the British Go,~ernment. This chart comprises the art>as of the Nortl1 arnl South Atlantic, the Indian, ancl tbe extreme wes~era part of the Pacific Ocean. Isogonic charts be(:a111e quite uumerous after Halley's time. 1rhose l>y Hansteen (Magnetismu.- Iler Brde, l~WJ <le>'l'l'\·(, special mention; his earliest one is for the year 1600. In 1838 Gauss published his" Genernl tht·ory of Terrestrial Magnetism" (in Hesnltate, etc., des l\fagnetischen Vereius, Gotting·cn) and the rl':rnlt-

UNITED STATES COAST AXD GEODETlO SURVEY. iug isomaguetic curns were afterwards cllarted. A translation of tlle theory and copies of the charts are gi,·en iu Taylor's Scientific )1emoirs, Vol. II, London, 1841. In the work of .A. Erman and Il. I'etersen, "The Fonmlation of tlie Gaussian theory and the p11enomemi of Terrestrial )fag1ietism in tlJe senr 18'.!9," Berlin, 1874, t11e general distribution of magnetism over tlie globe is shown on si.x charts for the q10ch 1829. For the most complete magnetic charts <leJ1ending directly on obsen·ations, tlie readt>r is referrt>d to General Sir Edward Sabine's Uontrilmtions to Terrestrial Magnetism, Xos. XI, XIII, XIV and XV, l,hil. Trans. Hoy. Soc., for tlrn years 1868, 11'72, 1875 a11d 1877, respcctin·ls. These cliarts refer to the period 1840 to 1845. The latest isogonic charts for the rnited States of America, rednce<l to the epoch 1885.0, will be fouud in the Coast and Geodetic Surny l~eport for 188:!, Appendix No. 13, in three sheets, Nos. 38, 3!), 40. The sec1l1ar rHriotfon of the declination.-The discovery of the gradual chauge of the declination, which for any one place hacl previously been supposed by philosophers to be constant, is <lue to Gellihrand, of Gresham College, England. In 16:35 he publi.,lled his work, entitled "A discourse mathematical! on the Yariation of the 1.fagneticall Needl~, together with its admirable diminution lately discm·ered.'' He based his conc!nsions upon the recorded obsen'atious of Boroughs (1580), of Gunter (1G2:.!), arnl his owu obserYations (Hi33-34), showing tlrnt in the Yicinity of London the direction of tlw llecdlc hatl challged in the interval fully 70 to the westward. From this time the fact of the fiecular variation was completely establishetl, and it remained to later times to determine its exteu t and dew lop tbe law goYerniug this change, aud to emka,·or to find its cause. That the >elocity was not uniform was soon percei,·ed, and the apparent periodic character of the >ariation was promineutly f9rced upon the attention of obseners when the needle reached a stationary condition, as, for instan<'e, in the eastern part of the "Gnited States towanls tbe end of the eighteenth centnry, aml tben recommeuced its motion in a direction O)Jposite to that it batl before. Similarly at Paris, France, thl1 secular change was westward between the sta,tionar;1 epochs of 1580 (about) and 1812 (ahont), since which time tbe needle bas commenced retracing its course eastwardly. Nearly midway between such stationary cpoebi> the annual change is observed to be a m:_tximum. See Plate No . .':O, upper diagram. ·

then the conditional equations will take the form : O=o,-D + x +sin am .y+cos mn.z+ . . . . . . . . . from which the numerical values of x y z are to be deduce<l in the usual way by meanl:l of normal equations. To determine the value of a (arn.l similarly of a, a 11 · · · ) the computation is repeated three times (or more if necessar)·; using the slightly changed values a +.ia and a-Ja, from which that particular value of a is found and finally retained which renders the sum of the squares of the differences of observed and computed declinations a minimum. In some cases where certain oli,.;er· vations were ffridently less trust worth~· than others, and wbicll ue,·ertheless could not he dispensed with owing to the small number of observations, or on a~count of their special value with n>oference to time, particular weigh ts were assigned; generally each observation recein\d the weig;_.~ unity, a few imperfect obsen·ations tile weight one-half, and to some speciall~1 \aluable obserYations double weight was assigned. In these cases the conditionJ.l eqna,tions were multiplied by the square root of their respective weight. Of obs1>.rrnti.ous C\ idmtl_y grossly in error no notice what· ever was taken. In finally selecting what seeme!l to he the best expression for the secular clrnIJge at a station, I have also frequently been guided by the acconl of the various constauts enteriug into the equation when compared with correspomliug ,-.1lueti in the equation" for snrronnding stations. \Yl!en appl_ying Cauclly's metl!otl of inte1polatio11 tlle form D = o + I' co,;; c . sin 111<¥ + r ~in c · cos mt¥ + ... was f'onml more coavenient iu ul:le.

The greater part of this apparent probable error or rather probable uncertainty in the representation is due to the fact that the observations collected at any one 1·'1ace were not generally made at precisely the same spot, thus introducing the effect of any local irregularities iu tLe distribution of magnetism in addition to the ordinary obsen'· ing errors. In cases of obserYations evidently not correctetl for diurnal ,·ariation, with the hour of the day of observation not known, the received imperfect nilue bad to he accepted. This remark, howeYer, applies only to otherwise am)urate measures for which alone this correction is of importauce. There are some stations where from \Vant of a sutncient nnmber of obserYations, or from short· ness of interval between the first and last obser>a'tiou, the length of the period of the secular Yari:t· tion could not be made out. ln such eases the declination and annual clia11ge due to the secular rnotiou may be expressed by means of an exponential function, thus: D=do-t-Y(t-to)+z(t-to)3 + ....

The principal uncertainty iu ti.JC inn.'stig,ition thus arises partly from large obserdng or instru· mental enors iu tlte older ouscrnttions maue with ordinary compasses or with rude instruments gem·ral!y, aml partly, iu ca:se of modem ob8erYatio11s, :since the introduction of more refinetl instrumeuts (tltc magnetometer witb collimator maguet an<l theodolite), from cliange of local pogitions and from imperfect eliminatio11 of irregular Yariations from the normal direction of tile magnet. In consequence of the extended use of iron above and below gronml and the rapitl growtll of cities cowring up older stations, it is difficult to select and presen·e at snch places a suitable Jocality for permanent use. Accurate iuvestigatio11s of the secular Yariation can oulJ· be made ut regular magnet1c ob8en·atories or in 1oca1i\.ie~ exempt from all disturbing influences. In applying at pre;.:;e11t a pet'iodic fnuction for the representation of the secular Yariatiou,· it should be understood that this does not neoes&irily imply that the pLenomenou is a periodic one, or even has an inrariable period of tlrn length assigned, or that it must exhibit a second or repeated mo· tiom; of like character to the first, or eYeu that a first peiiod will lie completed without some minor change of law. The aim is F>imply to rcprl~sent by a F>nitable and comprel1em;ive formula tlrn changes which are obserYed iu the direction of the horizontal component of the magnetic force from year to :i:ear an<l during ceutnries, and to provide the means for the further study of the phenomenon with a Yiew to ascertaining its probable cause, as well as for predicting, at least for a fow years in ailrnuce, the probable direction of the needle, this infornmtiou Lciug required in the constru~ tion of our liplrographic charts, as well as by the navigator and the surveyor.

*This table was obtained from Mr.John B. Kaufman, county surveyor, Franklin County, Pennsylvania, who communic;tted the same to me in a letter dated" Upper Strasburg;, Pa., March 11, 1887." It is headed "Declinations collected by John D. Kaufman, county surveyor, Franklin County, Pennsylvania, partly obtained by differentials between old and new bearings of trustworthy lines, partly by direct observations at the county meri<lian, latitude 39° 56 1 , longitude 77° 391 VI/., and al the private meridian near Upper Strasburg, in latitude 40° 03' and longitude 77° 41 1 W., about." He further remarks: "From IiJ6 till 1852 (the declinations are) from land surveys, except the observation of Irwin's Mill; after 1852, partly by ,well-established lines compared with annual tests at county meridian, till 1876. Since last date obserntions were recorded from annual tests at pri,·ate meridian. No correction made for diurnal variation." 32.-RAT.TIMORE, MD.

*Mr. Thomas Kelhaugh, sun·eyor at Mount Carmel, Baltimore County, Maryla nd, communicated to the Coast Survey Office (letters dated August 17 and 24, !877, and April 28, !879) 52 cases of observed (or allowed for) changes of magnetic declina- · tions between two given dates. These differences were mostly from redeterminations of magnetic bearings of old lines, made with the common surveyor's compass, by different individuals and with different instruments. Their locality was generally within a radius of 15 statute miles of the city of Baltimore, and on the Jo\_, the NE., and N\V. of it. These sun-eys were made by order of the Baltimore County circuit court, in consequence of disputed land boundaries. Other values Mr. Kelbaugh copied from the record books of the county surveyor and his assistants, between 1805 and 1825. [These 52 differential values were carefully scrutinized by me and finally combined to r2 mean results, as given in the above table results Kos. I to I I inclusive and No. 16. To these several differences I have added the respective values adopted by me for the declination atthe time of the resurYey. These latter data resulted from a formula for Baltimore as established by me in I 877-Sctt. 1

* A rough expression. t The secular variation observed at Paris is illustrated on accompanying plate No. 29. It is introduced for the purpose of showing the extremely systematic character of this variation. In the upper half of the diagram the dots indicate the observations. and the smooth curve represents the declination according to a constant and the first periodic term D= + 6°.479 ..L 16°.002 sin (0.765 m 118° 46 1 .5 ). At this station the phenomenon has now been follo\\;ed up for about 346 years, in which inten·al it exhibited two well marked extremes, viz, about the year 1581 a maximum eastern position, and about the year 1812 a maximum western position; the interval between these two consecutive elongations is 231 years, which may be regarded a:. the time of half a period; in the formula the numerical value of a implies 470 years for the period. The secondary wave superposed upon the primary is shown in the lower half of the diagram; it has two characteristics, viz, a variability in the parameter, that is a diminution in the size of the wave since about 1540, with a possible increase now, and secondly a variability in the length of the period. which was nearly constant in the second half of the sixteenth and throughout the seventeenth centuries, but afterwards diminished rapidly. Both variations, if real, are undoubtedly periodic, though from want of sufficient data our tabular expression io limi:td ;n time. It appeared to me doubtful whether one or two secondary waves lie between 1740 and 1870, and since tlie above diminution of the period hinges upon this question, two analytical expressions were presented in the last edition of this poper, one showing one crest, the other two crests within the interval. The latter expression is here given the preference in comequence o'. its better representing the latest obseryations. The factor (4.04, etc.) of n, where n=t- 1700 corresponds to a length of period of about go years, which at present has diminished to ahout 57 years. These variations necessarily complicate the formula The law, however, may be studied at Paris to great adrnntage, and the station was only introduced here with the object of pi·ominently showing the stately secular swing of the needle, and to facilitate the connection of its phases with those noted in No.-1,h America.

*The maximum west declination, according to the formula, \vas reached in 1799, but according to direct observation in 18o7 and again in 1814; the latter value, however, would certainly place it too late, the observation referring to noon and to a. single day. The observations when plotted appear stunted about the time of tum in the secular motion; omitting the effect of the secondary wave the primary wave would place the maximum in the year 1812. t According to Mr. Moureaux's observations (Memoires divers; observations magnetioues faites l l'observatoire du Pare Saint-Maur, pendant l'annee, 1885) the decrease between 1884.5 and 1885.5 was IY.3.

*The geographical position here given depends on that of Mannsville as determined by the U. S. Lake Survey.

t The table gives zero declination for October 1, 1797. This mistake originally arose, I supppose, by confusing the annual
change, which was then about zero, with the declination itself. Mr. Colvin himself points out elsewhere in his rept"rt of 1886 that the declination was not zero in the Adirondack region about that time, but reprints the table uncorrected.

III.- Collection of ~Magnetic Decl-inations from the earliest to tlw present time, obserred on or near the Pacific coast of the United Sta.tes and west of the Rocky 1llountainll and extending ot'CI' thr region from the Isthmus of Tclwantepec, Jlforico, northward to Bering Strait and the Arctic Oeean, coast of Alaska.

To these are added observations at a station in Kamtchatka and at two stations in the Sarnlwieh Islands. This collection, however, comprises only places for which sufficient data were fonr;il for the discussion of the secular change of the declinatfon. Since the issue of the last edition of this paper a valuable collection of magnetic data ha,.; been published by .Assistant G. Davidson, iu .Appendix No. 7, Report for 1885, entitled "Uoll1'('tion of some :Magnetic Yariations off the Coasts of California and Mexico, obserwd by Spanish Navigators in the last Quarter of the Eigliteenth Century." The contents of this commuuicatio11 bearing directly upon our researches, it was submitted l>y me to a careful scrutiny, "·hen its mine became at once apparent, as it enabled me to assign for that early period a closely approxinrntP value for the declination for an)" part of the coast between San Blas, a leading Mexican port. at the time, and Vancouver Island. By means of these observations, when properly discu,,~etl, a" satisfactory a value could be gi,·en as if it had been directly obscrrncl, atHl consequently l ham introduced such results in the general collection of declinations at all places where observations were wanting about that period and iu some ins.tances made use of such values as checks ou observations which appeared doubtful. It will therefore be proper to explain the method of procedure and give the results deducecl before presenting th_e general collection of data at the secularchange stations on the Paci:fic coast. All observations in question were made at sea, hence indh-idually tliey gi\·e little information for an;'.'- particular place, but collectively their value becomes apparent if it can be shown that the probable error of a single observation is reasonably small and the law of geographical clistribution of the declination can be made out satisfactorily. This was effected by plotting all obserrnd values for localities not more than about 40 of arc or about 240 nautical miles distant from the coast and representing tlle distribution of the declination as a fonction of the latitude and longitude disregarding the effect of the secular change during the interrnl 177-t to li!IO; iu other words, making no allowance for reduction to mean epoch. To treat so large a number of observations by application of the method of least squares, the 122 observations selected as within our limit were united into mean values, for 7 grou11s, which could readily be marked out on the chart. No rejection was made and the values forming each group may be identified, if desired, by the epocll and their latitude and longitude without special reference to .Appendix No. 7. These groups are as follows: In the table the groups arc marked ''A." to "G," and the headings No., -r, <p, A., D indicat~ the running number, the year aml fraction, the latitude, the west longitude, and observed declination, respecti\-ely. -----·

which is a sufficiently close representation.

For tile probable error of the mean of a group we

have
r=O.fiH / [t·~]~=±oo.205 or ±:12'.

'\ n-m

Ou an average the 11umber of obsen·atious in a group is 17, hence the 11rol>al>le error roof any individual observation for declination is 0.'.!05 ,!IT or ::l::00,845 or :1::51', a tolerably fair value, considering the time when these observations were made. It also compares favorably with the estimated average probable error of an observation made by Vancouver. To draw the isogonics as represented on the accompanying chart (:N"o. 30) it was only necessary to find the roots of tlie ahoYe equation for certain assumed values for D, ranging from -5° to -180, and plot the corresponding values of <p and i\. for each line. A comparison of the isogonics of 1783 with those of tile present time shows tllat a century ago the general direction of the cur,·es was not very unlike tl1e present one, but they were less crowded tluu1 now. In the spa-0e between Sau Blas and the nortilern part of Vancouver Island we fin<l a change of declination iu 1783 of 130, whereas in the sa,me space we now have 150 of change, aud, roughly speaking, the rleclinatfou a century ago was 40 less easterly than at present in the region of San Blas and (30 less than at present at Vancouver Island.

Series of .,,lfagnetic Stations mainly on the PaC'ific Coast and in the region irest of the Uocky .,,lfountains. ·

The stations of this western series are irregularly scattered over the region extending from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, :Mexico, to the Arctic Ocean, Alaska. Added thereto is a station in Kamtchatka, Eastern Siberia, and two on the Sandwich Islands group. Ju this series the observ.itions for magnetic declination have been collected and discussed for secula,r variation at the following places:
1, 2.

Acapulco, Mexico.

Vera Cru.t, 11exico. 3, City of ~Iexico, :Mexico. 4. San Blas, 1\1 exico.

[Mr. Marcus Baker discussed the magnetic observations at Japonski Isla.ml
made between 1850 and 1864 incl., and as there was no absolute detenninalion for this period, he based his annual mell!l values on the computed value resulting from my expression of the secular change at Sitka, given in the preceding edition; thus th_e diflerential scale reading 396.0 for I 857.5 corresponds to the declination 29°07'.2 E., March, 1882-ScH.]

N. B.-This important Asiatic st:1tion was included in the discussion on account of its proximity to the Western Aleutian or Rat Islands, and as affording the means for connecting the Jaw of secular change with that found to prevail over Siberia. For information No. 3, part of 4 and of Nos. 5, 7, and 9, I am indebted to l\'lr. '.\farcusDaker,temporarily(1879)attachecltothe Computing Di\'ision of th~ Const nnd Geodetic Survey Office.

The following two stations 011 the Sandwich Ishrnds, wldcli were first iutroducell in tlie tliinl cL1ition of tlie paper on tlie secular change, are here retained, but without giving for them an analJtkal expression of the law of change. This was tliought to be the proper course to pursue i11 Yiew of t!Je nncertaiuty now attaching to the former values in consequence of later ancl. important information hearing on the subject. In a letter addressed to me hy Curtis J. Lyous, assistant Gcn-ernme11t Survey, dated Honolulu, January fl, 1884, l\Ir. Lyons expresse8 his conviction that from 1850 to 1884 the i>ecular nuiation was increasing the easterly declination prevailing over the Sandwich Islands, and cites bis experience on Hawaii, viz: ''From a number of compass bearings observed by me in 1853 when compared witlt the respecth-e bearings taken by the same compass and the same observer in 1872-'73, the increase of declination was 40', lrnnce auunal increase 2'.0 '' Again, in 1873, :Mr. Lyons made careful notes of a magnetic bearing of a, base line in Oahu and repeated the same with the same instrument in 1884 and found an increase of about 20', hence mrnnal increase l' .8. He also states that he knows the 8pot where Commander \Vilkes' observatory stood at Honolulu in 1841, and tl.Jat the vltl site is llOW included in the }Jalacc yard; at this place lie "finds tl1e declination in 1884 to l>e !)o 30' E., beuce amrnal iiwrease l'.7. If it thus be a, fact that from about t~c middle of tbis ceutury to tlte present time the east declination 011 the Samlwich Islands has been on the increase, as believed by l\lr. J,yous, the explanation might be found in the presence or obtrusion of a secondary waYe of sufficient range to have temporarily overpowere1l aud concealed tile ordinary effect of the primary wa\'"e of secular motion. There certainly was indicated by tlie obserrntions an increase of east declination from the earliest times for which we ha\'e here record np to the year 1832, some years more or less, when apparentls a maximum was reached; this last feature it would i;cem we have now to give up aml await furtlier clHelopmeut before we can be certain of our deductions. Iu a second letter to me dated Honolulu April 23, 1884, Mr. Lyons gives further eYidence supportiug bis former statements by fresh obsu,·ational eYidence of direct measures, an<l gives as J1is result that the annual increase easterly declination between 1871 and 1884 was about l (1'.9 +2'.2 +1'.5) or 1'.9 very nearly.

Obsetvations inclosed within oair.entheses are proposed for omission in any process for representation that may be employed.

No expression of thl' above observations by means of a periodic function will for the present be attempted, as it seems impossible, without unllue and arbitrary straining, to reconcile such a formula with the oondition imposed upou by Mr. Lyons, i. that the easterly declination was i'*"1'etllli"fl on the islands from about the middle of the century to the prP.sent time; we therefore prefer to suspend our judgment as to the direction and amount of the secular change at the pres-

e.,

ent time, and shall -wait for further development.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Iu a volcanic region like that of the Sandwich Islands it is absolutely essential for the elucidation of the secular change in any of the magnetic elements that the successive observations should be made at the same stations, otherwise local disturbances may completely hide the true progressive movement and render all comparison nugatory. Even with this precaution we are obliged to assume that the law of secular change has not at times been suddenly interrupted tilrough the agenc.Y of \olcanic eruptions or through tile effects of earthquakes. A complete maguetic surwy of this group of islands could not fail to throw much light on the distribution and cliaracter of the local dis.turbances as well as furnish evidence whether or not the secular change on'r <listnl'bed aud um1isturbed regions is the same, aud it is to be hoped that it will be undertaken b.y the Hawaiian Government Su1Tey. TLe Sandwich falands group is magnetically considered no less interesting than are the Bermuda Islands, in which latter group, however, there is less liability to abrupt local changes in the curYes representing the distribution of magnetism than in the former.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
GRAPHICAL ILLUSTRATION OF 'l'HE SECULAR VARIATION.

In a preceding part of this paper we have akeady made use of the graphical method to exhibit to the eye the motion of the needle as observed at Paris, and since this kind of representation has the great advantage of readily impressing the facts on the memory and of affording easy comJ>arisons and generalizations, the secular motion as observed at four leadiug stations is introduced on plate No. 31. These stations are New York, Baltimore, San Francisco, and Sitka. As an aid to mnemonics on the diagrams, the degrees of easterly decliuation are shown to increase toward the right or east, and consequently the degrees of westerly declination increase towards the left or west, the ordinates being considered as directed north a:ud south (trtle); t.he time scale increases downward where additional observations can be plotted more conveniently than on the top. The observed declinations are shown by dots, the computed declinations by a continuous curved line. These diagrams show in a conspicuous manner the great regularity and persistency of the secular variation, and thus impress the mind with the fact that the ex1"llanation of it must ultimately be referred to forces of a periodic character simultaneously acting over large areas au<l with great regularity, and probably having their source directly or indirectly in the sun, and with a prooal>le .dependence on planetary configurations. The effect of these deflecting forces on the magnetic -condition at points on the earth's surface undergoes modifications as manifested in the observed variations of the amplitude and in the duration of the secular oscillation at places geographically widely Jistributcd. So far, however, we are not in possession of any theory or even of a plausible working hypothesis as to the true cause or origin of the secula.r varia.tion, and consequently are constrained to pursue the inquiry empirically by meaus of observation aud discussion. On map No. 32 we give the annual change of the declination for the epoch 1890, for all pla.ces ,discussed and falling within the limits of the map. The numbers are expressed in minutes of arc, and are directly taken from the preceding tables. A plus sign indicates increasing west or decreasing east declination, as the case may be. To know where the declination is west and where it is ·east, the agonic line (or Hue of no deviation) for 1890 is introduced; for all places to the right, or to the north and east, of this line the declination is west at that epoch, and for all places to the Jeft, or to the south and west, of it, it is east at that time. The map also shows the positions of this agouic for the epoch 1795, at which time it had about reached its extreme northeastern position, having come up from the southward; apparently it rested here a few years and then comJ menced to retreat over its previous course. At that time, in this vicinity, it passed between '\Va.shiugtou and Baltimore, a.ud extended out to sea just south of Oape Henry, Va. It is not easy to determine the exact time of stationary condition; there may be a.n uncertainty of several yea.rs in consequence of the ordinary irregularities in the direction of the needle and the extreme smallness of the secular effect, which is overlaid and bidden by the former. There al'e likewise shown the positions of the agonic line for the epochs 1850 and 1875, and it is hardly necessary to remark that while about 1795 its geographical change was nil, its rate of change southward along our Atlantic coast has continually been increasing; it will reach a maximum at the time of the middle of the secular swing. It will be noticed that for nearly the whole of the United States (within the Umit of the map) the annual change has a positive isigu ; in other words, 'the north end of the needle moves westward, increasing west or diminishing east deolina.tion, and the same is true for Alaska; but there ar~ two regions of exception where the opposite of this motion is observed, viz, one in the extreme northeast, outside of o:ir territory, in Newfoundland and part of Nova Scotia, the other in the extreme west, which is less accurately known than the other in consequence of its great extent over a comparatively little explored area. between Mexico and British Columbia. Shaded bands on the map indicate the boundaries of the opposite regions within which the north end of the needle moves in opposite direction, hence these bands occupy places where, in 1890, the n1:>edle will have apparently ceased to move, or will have assumed, temporarily, a stationa.ry con· dition; western elongation having been reached at all places within the Nova Beotia belt, and eastern elongation at all places within the western coast belt. These bands, like the agonic or any other isogonic cnrve, continually and gradually shift their position, to which circumstance we shall presently recur. It would not be difficult to oonstrnct curves of equal a,~nual cMnge for 'any given .epooh. as was done by the writer for a limited area.

such aiu. 'Itie line of maximum annual change might be expected to lie geographically midway uetweeu the two zero regions, which we find roughly to be tile case. On plate. No. 33 an attempt is made to exhibit tile changes which the (so called) agonic line of the North Atlantic has apparently undergone since its first disco\·ery by Columbus in 1492.· It shows tile several positions of that line for the epochs 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800; also for 1850, 1875, and for 1900 prospectively. Tlte earliest posit.ion is quite conjectural, and rests on the observation of Columbus for its place in the mid-Atlantic, and for a secoud poiut on it., farther north, on an observation by Sebastian Cabot.1 We also have reason to suppose the line to have passed over a region in the vicinity of Paris, and over a region including the Antilles. The s~cond position, that for 1600, is taken from Hansteen's work (of 1819) and may be considered as a rough approxima. tion; some change w,as made by me at its western end. The position for 1700 is more reliable, since it depends directly on numerous observations collected by Halley; it is taken from his chart. The positions for 1800 and 1850 require no further explanation; that of 19007 though prospective, is quite certain, considering tlle small scale of tha map. Upon the whole the general direction of the isogonic system in the vicinity of the agonic line of the North Atlantic appears to have been swaying forward and backward in a rather irregular way, with a preponderance, after 1600, toward a direction like that in which astronomical azimuths are counted. ProgrC88iVe cltange in tke secular variation.-Tbe progressive change noticed when examining at different times the position of the lines where the needle bas arrived at elongation or at extreme range in the secular motion has already been referred to in a geueral way, aud the systematic propagation of the phase of easter11t elongation across the United States, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, in about the lapse of a century, has been adverted to. Uuder the present heading it is proposed to enter somewhat more minutely into this remarkable phenomenon. The following figures are taken directly from onr table, oolunm headed "Nearest epoch of east elongationr" and beginning in the e.xtrem~ northeast we find the years of occurrence of this sta· tionary phase of ea.st elongation at different localities as follows:

For particulars see two papers in Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 188o, viz: Appendix No. 18: "An attempt to solve the problem of the first landing place of Columbus in the New World," by Capt. G. V. Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, 1861-'66; and Appendix No. 19: "An inquiry into the variation of the compass off the Bahama Islands at the time of the landfall of Columbus, in 1492," by Charles A. Schott, Assistant Coast Survey. In connection with this subject it may be remarked m passanl that, in the writer's opinion, the controversy about the first landing place, and the track of Columbus among the West India Islands, may now he considered as closed (save the identification of the first harbor in Cuba) by the recent labors of Lieut. J.B. Murdock, U.S. N.: "The Cruise of Columbus in the Bahamas, 1492." The landfall took place, undoubtedly, at Watling's Island, as insisted upon by Captain Becher, in 1856, but in attempting to trace the su/Jsequent track he failed, iJi consequence mainly of an erroneous assumption of the magnetic declination prevailing at the time of Columbus. t Soon after the discovery by Colurtlbus of a point of no variation in the Atlantic, Sebastian Cabot discovered a second one farther north, and evidently belonging to the same agonic curve. Livio Sanuto states, in his Goographica Distincta (Venice, 1588), that he procured the information from Sebastian Cabot and made use of his map (probably th.at oomposed in 1544), on wb.ich the position of the meridian inter.secting the po.int of no variation was seen to be one hundfed and ten miles to the west of the ishind of Flores, one of the Azores;. see·· Narrative and Critical History of America," by Justin Winsor, Vol. III, Boston ud New Vork, 18l14, p. 41. This discovery probit.bly was made on the second voyage of the Cabots, or in 1498, although it may have been nOted in the first, in 1497, by the elder Cabot. The latitude of the point is uncertain, but may be approximated from the fact that in the lint voyage land was apparently sighted at Cape Breton, and in the second the coast of Newfoundland (Baccalaos), which is said to have been made from the north. In the cow:se of a conversation with Contarini, the Venetian ambassador to Charles V, in 1522, Sebastian Cabot told the llldbusl!.dor that he had a method for ascertaining, 6y tM n«dk, the distance between two places from east to west, which had DC'IU ~ beeu. discottred by -y ooc. Ibid., p. 50. . la thill idea. howeHr, he waa also anticipated by Columbwl.

These places and corresponding times suffice to bring into strong relief the gradual progress within our geographical borders of what may aptly be called the crest (or hollow, as we may con· ceive) of the magnetic secular wave clear across the North American continent in about a century's time. This transfer of the eastern-elongation phase thus took place from east to west across the country; hence it is higl1Jy probable and may reasonably be inferred that with tbe present passing out into the Pacific of the eastern-elongation phase and the coming in of the opposite or westernelongation phase in the east, this invasion of the latter phase, already commenced in Northeastern Maine, will likewise propagate itself in the course of time over and across the continent; in fact our fornmlro do suppose this to take i1lace. The question whether our table of dates of the easternelongation phase can be extended so far east as to reach Europe cannot be definitely answered. We have for St. John's, Newfoundland, the date of 1741, and for Paris the year 1581, for tbc epoch of this phase, bnt unfortunately no intermediate stations at which to follow up the motion; observations at the Azores, in southern Greenland, and in Jceland may possibly come to ligbt·to assist in this inquiry. If we follow up the dates of the eastern magnetic elongation going south along our Atlantic coast, thence across the Gulf of Mexico and north along the western coast, we notice the same law of gradual change as in onr first table. A curve of equal elate would fairly run parallel to our . Atlantic coast liue, aud hold even as far south as Havana and Panama; similarly a curve of equal date on the western coast from Lower California up to the Straits of Fuca would not greatly de,Tiate from it. ·

Beyond Vancouver Island alJ(l as we enter Alaska tlie dates again become earlier, as at Sitka, 1861, and in the whole region to the north ward and westward, and including the chain of islands, the average date probably varies between 1830and1840 or thereabout. Near the eastern coast of Asia, west of Kamtchatka, we encounter a complex system of isogones whose secular development, however, lies outside the l!mits of our research. With respect to secular variation, then, our magnetic weather is coming in from the northeast, aml we already note the past occurrence of the western-elongation phase at Newfoundland in 1870, aud at Prince Edward Island iit 1884, with its expectation at Halifax in 1893, at Eastport in 1899, and at Portland in 1913. .Should the Paris date 1812 be connected with this, the spee.d across the Atlantic must ham been very different from that of the earlier east-elongation I)hase; all this, however, is at present matter of speculation. Looking over the numerical values of on which the length of the period depends, we notice a relation to geographical position, as in the case of the epochal quantity c, of our general furmula, just considered, but less marked. For stations on our Atlantic coast the ·alues a are generally included between 1.30 and 1.M, implying periods of 277 and 232 years respectively, fmd the s.:tme limits will apply to the generality of 11laces in the interior. /,,,. For stations south of the United S~tes the value of a is decidedly less, as at Kingston, Panama, Acapulco, City of Mexiuo, for which a varies between 1 ()and 1.11 with corresponding periods of 360 and 327 years. The value ot a for western coast stations, as San Diego, Santa Barbara, Monterey, San Francisco, aud Cape Mendocino, remains low, averaging 1.15 (period 313 years); in Ala.ska it rises again to about 1.30 (period 277 years), with but little variation. At first sight this diversity in the length of the periotl would seem to present a great obstacle in the way of explaining the ca.use of the sectdar variation through the action of an external or cosmical disturbing force which would be supposed to act alike at all stations. If we suppose the clianges in the direction of tlle magnetic needle to be due to changes in the direction of electric currents or of electric impulses or waves traversing the earth's crust and permeating the same to a considerable depth, and altering by incluctive action the magnetic condition of the earth itself,

we may see in the diversity of the length of the period, and of the magnitude of deflection at dif· ferent places, the effect of a systematic swaying in the position and intensity of such electric currents. For the further development of the laws of secular variation in North America it would be of great importance to know what has been going on in the immediate vicinity of the magnetic pole (where the dip is 900 and the horizontal force zero) since Ross visited the region, now more than half a century ago. We have no direct or observational evidence whatever whether the pole remained stationary or has shifted its position, and if the latter, how much and in what direction. In conclusion a few remarks may be made respecting the accuracy of the observations, shown in the tabula.r values of probable errors as derived from the differences of observed aud computed values. The probable errors of observation given in the tables will ser>e to convey some idea of the relative value of each series of observations. The imperfections in the instrumental means and methods of the older observations in many cases react unfavorably on the modern obser>ations, which are made with more precise instruments and by more refined methods. If we take, for instance, the observations of Hudson, made in 1609, in the vicinity of New York, we fiml each fairly chargeable withe. probable error of about ±3 or 4°. ·while these observations are very imi.}erfect, those of Champlain of about the same period (1604 to 1612) are no better. These two navigators differ nearly 90 off the mouth of the Penobscot, Maine, and nearly 12° off Cape Cod. The observations made by Vancouver on our western coast, between 1792 and 1794, are e.ach sub· ject to a probable uncertainty of± 1°,and enm in our own days it requires \'ery favorable circumstances to determine the variation of the compass at sea with a probable error of say half a degree or less. Increased precision was attained with the improvement of the azimuth compass and by allowance for disturbing effect of the ship's iron, and, with respect to shore stations, greater accuracy was obtained by the introduction of the theodolite for determining the astronomical meridian. With a portable magnetometer and a collimator magnet, the instrumental means need not introduce a greater uncertainty than about oue minute; but the actual probable error of auy determination is dependent also on the irregular variations in the direction of the magnetic force precise work to continue the from day to day, thus making it desirable and indispensable observations for three or more daJS and to correct the individual results for diurnal Yariation. The amount of the probable error of an observed declinatmn depends also on the intensity of the lwrizontal component of tlte magnetic force at the place, i.e., in general the smaller the horizontal force the larger the apparent probable- uncertainty.

ON THE CIRCULATION OF THE SEA THROUGH NEW YOUK HARBOR.

A

Report by EIF:NRY J\fl'J:'CT-TELL,Assistant.

'iVASHINGTON, D. C., ]l:fay 6, 1887. SIR : The following is offered as my report ou the recent physical survey in New York Harbor, although it is almost exclusive}~· confine·l to a single proposition and its demonstration. Mr. Marindin, who has already submitted to you his statistics of fieltl work, will report on his studies of the 1rater contours as soon as his levels are completed. Very respectfully, yours, HENRY MITCHELL, Assistant l:nited States Coast and Geodetic Survey.

CIRCULATION OF THE SEA. THROUGH NEW YORK HARBOR.

Although the tidal currents of New York, especially in the East Ri\·er, appear to move to and fro, with ebb and floo<l, in monotonous repetition, like the swing of the pendulum, there is a tut gain, under ordinary conditions of river discharge, to the westwar<l, i.e., a pt'rmanent transfer ( f water from the Sound thr<>Ugb tho harbor and out into the ocean· over Sandy Hook Bar. Tliis statement, if true, involves so many consequences affecting the condition of the harbor (its na\igation and its improvement) that I have put it in the form of a proposition to be demonstrated, .first, from the most general relations of the Sonml and Harbor titles as oscillations of the sea ''interfering" at Hell Gate; and second, from a strictly inductfre study of gaugiugs made b;v different observers at different dates. I shall first show tbat it ought to be true theoretically aml then show that it i8 true practically. Gefteral relati.ons of the tides.-Two derivations of the tide enter New York Harbor; one by way of Long Island Sound, the other by way of Sa.ndy ~ook .Bar. The one that traverses the Sound is much obstructed and crowded, so that it arrives upon the scene four hours behind the other, a.nd much augmented in range. These two tides meet or pass into each other at Hell Gate, and give to the city portion of the East River a.' composite rise and fall, and to the whole length of the strait a nearly synchronous system of tidal currents.

TYPES OF THE TIDAL PROFILES.

The two figures are serpentine curv-es whose elements are those of the tides given in the tables of published charts for the two entrances tJ New York. From this diagram we observe that about three lunar hours after the moon's transit. the surface of the Sound is at the same elevation as the sea at Sandy Hook. Later they differ, and more and more widely, till at the sixth hour a maximum difference of height is reached which exceeds 5 feet. Then a decline takes place, till at the ninth hour the Sound and Sandy Hook Bay are again upon the same level. After this a slope in the opposite sense develops, reaching a maximum about the time of tqe next transit. The first slope, that between three hours and nine, is towards the Sound, i. the Sound continues through this interval to be lower than the Harbor. The second slope is towards the Harbor, and one may remember it easily as that which reaches its maximum at the soutMng-of-the-moon, and creates the ''ebb current," ~o-called. The peculiar quality of the East Ri\"er current, as compared with the free tidal ciirrent is that the former is a gravity stream, i.e., it is water rnnning down a slope as in a fresh-water river. Referring again to the diagram, it will be seen that the two Iunc>..s, or spaces between the type-curves, are equal, i. e., the' slopes, creating the flood-current and the ebb-current alternately, are equal in amount and duration. There is the same head for one stream as for the ofoer. But there is a very important di:lference. in the positions of these Innes, wbiCh affects materially the relati Ye values of the slopes they represent. We have marked with a cross tfle center of each, and it will be observed that the right-hand lune is 1 foot abo-re the other, which meana

that tht) ebb (westerly) current is in cleeper water aml greater transverse section tlian the flood. It is, therefore, the larger stream, and, .baYing greater hydraulic ·mean depth, it is tlJe quicker also. The East Ri\"'er is deli\"'eriug more water into New York Harbor than it carries back again to the Sound. , Although the Hudson and other rivers tlow into New York Harbor, and slightly raise its lc\'el, · t.he conditions illustrated iu our diagram are Yery nearly realized in tile seasons when the freshwater discharge is at a minimum. One of these seasons is the autumn; the other is mitl-winter, when the laud-waters are ice-bound. At such times the greater Yelocity being westward, and the greater depth of water being that of the westerly flow, tl.iere is, as a net result, a eirulation of seawater through the harbor from the Sound to the ocean. In mi<l-v.inter tbis circulation reuewing the water before it can get chilled, and lowering the freezing point by mixing sea-water with the Tiver discharge, serves to keep the pol't open to commerce. One ma.r form some estimate of the value of the four degrees difference of the freeziug points between sea and rirer waters, when it is remembered tlrnt in severe wint~rs Halifax, Portland, and Boston have not closed before Philadelphia or even Baltimore. This circulation also aids in maintaining the channels o>er the bar, which coulu not exist if the ebb and flood were equal, i. if there were no net gain of the sands swept to and fro. For the bar is but a broken portion of the cordon littora"l of which Sautlr Hook and Coney Island arc dry parts. Its channels are maintainell by a slight preponderance of the seaward flow, as our -0bser,·ations distinctly show. The indirect >alue of this influx from the Sound du~:ing the dry season lies in the partial supply -0f the tinder-run of sea-water which. occurs when the heatl of the river is insufficient to counterbalance the greater density of the sea-water. "\Ve <lo not find this under-run (oqirepon<lerance of inflow) at higher levels than the deepest channel-beds of the bar, except 011 rare occasions; but one may easily see that the withdrawal of the influx from the Sound would cause the bar to rise and work inward. The fresh waters, that enter from the Hmlson and other streams, play an insig· nificant part in the physics of the harbor; but the circulation of the sea by way of tlie Ea.st Rh-er~ although small in quantity, is the element which determines the superiority of New York Harbor over nearly all the sand-barred inlets of the world. It is this circulation which keeps the port open m winter and sweeps the sand from its threshold.

FIELD WORK OF 188(}.

Before entering upon detailed illustrations of the relation between slope and \eloeit~·, as revealed by the past season's work, it may be well to state how it happened that this theme came to be parsued by the fiel<l. and office parties instead of the gaugiug of the bar originally coutem· plated. In order to properly gauge the bar and to ascertain whetlier the channels over it are hol· loweu out of the sands to the limit of res1tlta1it scour, it was foreseen that two steam launches would be required, besides the other Yes~els, and Congress was asked to appropriate money for these, but rlid not; and finding that the launches already in the possession of our sernce were -either unfit or unavailable for this special use 1 w~ abandoned our project anu sought other ends within our means. Mr. Henry L. Mariudin, Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey, was instructed liy ~-ou to take charge of the .field work, and furnished by me with "memorau<la" setting forth the objects in view and the means of reaching them. He was directed, in effect, to occupy as many tidal an(l cur· rent stations simultaneously as could possibly be done, that" Urn 1·elations of different basins and .channels to the tidal system" might be disclosed; and "that the comparative Yalne of different reservoirs and the particular office of each channel" might be determineu, especially as affectiug the draught of water over the bar. Moreo·er, he was directed to gather the material for a series ()f contour maps of the surface of the harbor-a long-cherished i1rojer.t. In order that the computation should keep l'ace with the field work as nearly as the proper oouwe of the latter might require, 1 secured r..n office for myself and my assistant (Mr. E. E. Haskell, an expert observer, formerly iu the service of the 1\fississippi Wvcr Commission), aud iu this way mere rou.tine was a"._oided, and all worked together with definite and direct purpose.

412

UNITED STA.TES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

When everything Q.ad been prepared by Mr. Marindin to the utmost extent of :It.is means, it was discovered that our special survey of the Ea.st River circulation, which was the oialient point in our new project, require<l more experts and more vessels than we had provided. At this critical moment the Ilydrographic Inspector, Lie~t. Commander W. H. Brownson, U.S. N.,, with J·our consent, tendered assistance from the naval surveying parties at work i11 the neighborhood, and the whole thing was very successfully arranged. The interval between 8 a. m. of the 4th of October and 1 p. m. of the 7th, i.e., over three entire days, was secureu without a break at ele>eu tidal stations and four current stations. Mr. 111arindin directed the tidal stations, going around to give them exact time, &c. He also in a general way kept the current station at Twenty-third street advised, while Lieut. G. C. Hanns, U. S. N., assisted by Ensign C. S. Ripley, U. S. N., occupiell stations iu the Narrows and on the Bar, and Lieut. C. P. Perkins, U. S. N., occupied a station off Old Ferry Point. The station depended upon especially for the East River flow was that at Twenty-thir1l street, which had been occupietl the previous year as a gauging section. At this station 1\lr. J.E. :McGrath, of our own service, aml Mr. Homer P. Ritter (an expert obsen·er formerly in the service of the Mississippi River Commission), made the observations, assisted by Mr. George E. Kent, who also acted as sailin~ master. At the close of the season Mr. McGrath, assisted by Mr. Ritter, ran lines of precise levels connecting Hunter's Point, Ravenswood, Eighty-fourth street, Pot Cove, Polhemus, College Point, and Willets Point tide gauges with repetitions and checks removing all doubts. All of the stations proved to have the same mean level except Pot Cove, where the surface near time of low water appears to be lifted above where it should be. It may be that the. great whirl from which the cove gets its name really creates this lo<:,al elevation during the strength of the flood (easterly) current. We haYe not dared use this station in computing slopes, because, even if the levelings and observations are without error, the results are not in accord with the uniform testimony of other stations. Since, with tbis single exception, the stations connected by precise levels proved to have the same mean sea-level, it was assumed that Governor's Island and Sandy Hook hacl the same; so that the falling short of our level lines bas not distressed us thus far. Nevertheless it is very important that the precise levels should be extended to Governor's Island antl to stations on the Lower Hudson. And it is at least 1·ery desfrable to have the levels extended to the Narrows on the Long Island side, to the head of Newark Bay, through the Kills, around the Sandy Hook Bay to Sandy Hook light-house, connecting en route with all the tide gauges and making benches of the datum.planes of all the light-houses, forts, &c. We anticipate the necess-ity for these lines at au early date. . The foregoing is a sufficient resume of that portion. of the field work of the past season which has supplied data for what follows in the discussion of the circulation. I refrain from any mention of the water contours iu the harbor, because Mr. Mariudiu is working up these, and will present the whole scheme in a series of charts for which the office bas supplied the skeletons. It is not often that I feel content with my data; but this time we seem to have foreseen our wants, and by keeping office work and field work together or in concert, we have filled out the

requisition.

EA.ST RIVER TIDES A.ND 'l'IDAL CURRENTS.

In illustration of the relations of the two derh-ations of the tide that meet at Hell Gate we offer Diagram B drawn by Mr. Ritter. The first :figure· exhibits the profiles of the tides at Governor's Island and Willets Point-the stations that lie at the extremities of ibe strait connect.Ing Long Isla.nu Sound with New York Harbor; the second figure shows the profiles of the same tides within a mile of their meeting plnct>; and the thiril figure the same tides at the very Bill of the Gate j11st prior to their meeting.

UNITED STATES COASr AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

415

The first and second :figures are from synchronous observations, an<l two other pairs of profiles might ha'\"e been plotted over these but for the confusion of lines; for we have eight stations of faultless tidal observations besides two current stations in the East River for the 4th, 5th, aml <lth of October, 1886. (Sec schedule of field work preceding.) . The third figure of Diagram B is plotted from observations made long ago (l&J;j before Hallet's Reef was blasted away.

It will be observed that these curves, which are plotted ;bove an<l below an axis representing

the mean level of the sea, make two intersections, one about three, another about nine hours after
the southing of the moon. These intersections mean that the two water surfaces which the curves represent are then at the same absolute level; and if all the pairs of stations throughout the strait were to intersect at the same moment, we should say that at that moment the whole fiat surface Qf the strait from Harbor to Sound lies at tbe same level. This is w~arly the case, but not quite. There is au unequal loss of time in approaching the Gate from different directions which brings about distinct iutersectiom; among our I) lotted p?Oftles, and as this involves loss of time it involves aleocbangeaofetevation. Mr. Haskell has prepared for me Table 3 and Diagram C, which follow, &fvi.ng the nearest approach to the horizontal watM snrface an<l the widest departure rom it:

It has already been stated that the restorations of level are not exactly synchronous from station to station; for this reason the planes whose profiles appear at lIIhr· and at lXhrs in Diagram U are warped. The discrepancies are too small to confuse the simple conception with which this raper opened; but we take the precaution to gh'e these discrepa1icies as tabulated by Mr. Brad· 1ord and Mr. Haskell in the tables that follow (4 and 5).

The absolute height, irrespective of time, nt which the intersections among our 11!otted profiles occur is essentially the same for onr different pairs of stl!-tions, notwithstanding that we ba"rn had little choice in making these pairs-the stations having been located under -restrictions of ooti· venieuoo somewhat. ·

In Tables 6 and 7, which follow, the restorations and mean slopes are tabulated for a whole lunation, that the variations for the moon's age, declination, &c., may be exhibited. The variation with transit, i. e., the hf1lf-monthly inequality, is much like that of high water and low water, but we discover no orderly variation with declination, and upon this point we shall have something to say hereafter.

The average difference between the stages for the two slopes has been very carefully computed for me by Mr. Uitter for the entire lunation of observations at Governor's Island and Willets Point. It proves to be 1.48 feet, or just about one-half the mean slope, and could not have been otherwise if our stations represent, as we assume, the two ends of the strait in which such slopes are found In Diagram 0, in which the slo11es are }llotted for certain days and hours, we see a reversion point of the slope just below Hunter's Point at the time when the maximum difference of surfa~e le'l"el obtains between Governor's Island and Willets Point. In treating mean slopes, we find it possible to trace the difference of stage as far as Corlear's Hook, between which and Hunter's Point, the ebb and flood, with nearly eqnal slopes (0.31 foot westerly and 0.29 foot easterly), lie very nearly at the same stage, the ebb being less thaa 0.01 of a foot higher. But the duration of the easterly slope exceeds that iu the opposite direction, at least when plotted by mean levels. Referring again to Diagram B, it will be seen that the lunes made by the intersecting curves are not all of the same size. .As we approach the Gate we see them diminish; this means that the two tides a.re reconciling tbeir ..differences. Instead of making a vertical fall at Hell Gate, as our Diagram A seemed to threaten, the "ltead" falls baek by an actual transfer of water. The" heail" is not

absolutely inexhaustible, in the sense that onr opening scheme conveniently assumed. It is a question, then, whether the artificial enlargement of the "section" at Hell Gate can materially quicken the mean rate of flow, as one might expect in the case of an exbanstless ''head." The falls given in Table 3 are tlie ordinates of all the Innes at the moment of greatest difference of surface level between Governor1s Island and Hallet's Point., and tltese "fa.fl!!" diminish from about 4 feet between extremes to about 1 foot within the tumult of Hell Gate; but the slopes become more and more steep. It is a very curious fact that tbe harbor tides seem to suffer more depletion, when high, antl more filling-in, when low, than the Sound tides. The Sound tide.scarcely indicates interference till it reaches Hallet's Point, whereas even Governor's Island tide betrays in its profile the presence of oscillations from the Sound. From the preceding tables and diagrams it will be seen that the level of the East River is restored three hours (2h o1Jm) after the transit of the moon at a stage 2 feet below the mean sea-level. An easterly slope (and tlood current) then deYelops, reacqing a maximum of 4.7 feet at the sixth hour after transit and declining to zero again at the ninth hour (9h O'.?m). The mean of this easterly slope is 3.14 feet and its duration 6h 02ru. This restoration occurs at a stage 2 feet above the mean sea level. A westerly slope then develops (with ebb current), reaching a maximum of 4.8 feet at the hour of transit, and declines to zero abont three hours later. The mean of this westerly slope is 3.02 feet and its duration Gh 23m. The integrals of slope are, then, essentially equal for the two directions; and the curreuts which these slopes excite would also be equal if the depth of water remained the same for each slope; but tliis is far from being the case. Oue bas but to glanca at the diagram to see that the lanes made· by the overlapping profiles are at unPqual elevations. The actual node of the tide, i. e., the transfer from oue derivation to the other, occurs always at what is $pecifically known as the Gate, which is the narrow and obstrncti>d turn off Hallet's Point. Here the establishment shifts two hours and the tidal ranges alter 15 per cent. iu 200 feet. This particular statement is based upon observations made before the blasting of Ballet's Reef; lrnt other stations of recent occupation within a few thousand feet bear the same or similar testimony. The last figure of our Diagram B is plotted directly from the note-books, and, while it 1loes not strictly represent average conditions, it is tyJ}icaJ of these. It will be observed that the two Innes in our figure are es~entially equal, but very differently situated. The left-hand lune (which measures the slope eastward when the haroor is above the Soll,.nd) occurs at a stage 2 feet lower than the right-hand lune, which measures westerly slopes. Iu other words, when the slope is westward, and the current is flowing that way, there is a depth of water 2 feet greater than when the reverse slopes and currents prevail. In the present condition of the Gate, a line drawn from the shore at the electric light to the opposite shore in a direction N. 35° E. (true) indicates a width of about 570 meters, one-fifth of which is interrupted by the Hog's Back Reef. .A.s I remember the scene before the blasting was done, there was a noisy vertical fall over Hallet's Reef on the flooa and a furious boiling around the Hog's Back. The fiooll current converged in midchannel and became almost a torrent, the measured velocity being from 8 to 9 feet per second. But on the ebb a much quieter scene }Jresented itself. The tide had so risen that the Souncl waters u·elled over all obstructions and occupied the whole width of the passage way. It is not the particular obstructions in Hell Gate that cause a tidal node there, but these obstructions fix. tba.t node so that it is not prone to shift its location from springs to neaps, &c., as does the node between the ~tlantic aud Bay of Fundy tidal systems at the southeastern approach to Massachusetts. · .Although it is directly at Bell Gate that we are to apply tlte test of net discharge, our ohsermtions were necessarily made at convenient stations on either side of that bewildering scene, and we fortunately have a pair of stations at no great distance which for the period they cover are wholly abo>e suspicion of local re-action. These stations are Polhemus Dock, 1 mile eastward of Ballet's Point, and Eighty-fourth street, one-half mile westward of the same p~int. From a portion of the observations at these stations the second figure of Diagram B was plo·ted, and the c-0rnputatious show that the slope westward creating the "ebb" current is 2.32 feet more elevatetl (i.e., at a higher atage) than the swpe eastwarJ, but the integral slope is nearly the same iu both direction11. Tl.te mean slope westward (Eighty.fourth street, lower than Polhemus Dock) is 0.73 foot, with duration

42:.:!
(lh

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

12m, while the mean slope eastward is 0.67 foot, with duration 6h 17m, It will be observed that tbe difference of stage is three or four times the slope. We have spoken of the slope westward as taking place at a stage 2.32 feet more elevated than tbe slope eastward, referring explicitly to the average during these slopes. If we inqnire concerning the maximum slope the contrast of stage is much greater because the maximum slope westward is nearer the top of the tide in Hell Gate, while the maximum slope eastward is nearer the local time of low water. From Table 3, and the Diagram B that illustrates it, one may estimate for the point intermediate between Eighty.fourth street and Polhemus Dock a difference of 3i feet between the stages of alternate maximum slopes, i. c., there are 3~ feet more water O\'Cr the sill of Hell Gate when the western slope is at maximum than tllere is wllen the eastern slope is at maximum. We have reiterated the foregoing statement because it is the key-note of our theme and gives no uncertain sound. The city portion of the East River is jhished westward. ·we have indicated causes which should. produce this effect, and now we purpose to prove our case by furnishing the observed process of actual discharge through the avenue. During the period in which the tidal observations were being made along the East River and at Sandy Hook, the currents were also observed at two stations afloat in the East Hiver, one in the Narrows and one on thQ Bar near the middle of the East Channel. These observations of currents ham been plotted hy Mr. Ritter from the :field books, on diagram D, and below the figures the times of the moon's transits are indicated. The first thing that strikes the eye in this diagram is the correspondence between the figures in time. Flood or ebb is a continuous stream from ocean to Sound at strength, and this strength, at ebb, fulls very nearly at the time of the moon's transit; so that one can say that at the southing· of the-moon there is a continuous stream flowing from Long Island Sound through New Tork Harbor out over the bar to the ocean, ancl at this time this ebb current is nearly at its strength. \Ve are here at once remiuded that it wali at the southing-of-the-moon that we found the greatest slope between the Sound and the Harbor, and with this hint we proceed to connect the slopes and velocities more intimately together. That the success of this connection may be appreciated, attention mnst be called beforehand to the difficulty in selecting in any part of a tidal avenue a single station that will furnish an equally fair exhibit of ebb and flood; there is a proneness of these adverse streams to prefer opposite shores, and for obvio_us reasons as one looks at the approaches in contrast.

In the foregoing tables the lunar honrs are reckoned from the transit of the moon, and three days' simultaneous observations (ten or fifteen minutes apart) are used. The better to conny the information of these tables, Diagram E, Figures- 1, 2, and 3, are offered. One who is acquainted with tidal currents easily reoognizes in the discrepancies near the tnrn of the current familiar sources of difficulty in the process of observing. So long as the euITent is strong and runs fair with the channel the observations are consistent, bnt when the turn approaches, the vessel swings out from her old position, or the current tak~ a dh~ction of which only one com11onent lies in the previous train.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

If tile epochs of slack-water and ma,ximum velocity fall in properly with the times of restored level and maximum slope, I consider that cause aud effect are established, and the constants of time and coefficients of velocity have real values. The coefficient of velocity is, of cours<\ a local quantity, varying at every step along the course of the river, but the constant of time is the delay between cause and effect. The slope reverses before the current reverses-or, in other words, tbe current overruns. It is a measure of inertia. If it be true that the currents of the East River are products of the slope in the most ordinary sense, as we have described, then the facts that these slopes occur at different stages in Hell Gate should necessitate greater discharge in the direction that the highest stage slope obtains, i.e., west ward towards New York Harbor. · Previous to 1885 we had never attempted to gauge the East River except once, that was at Wall street in 1872. (See "The Barbor of New York; its Condition." New York Cbamber of Commerce, 1873. Also, "Annnal Report Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1871.") I distinctly remember that it was a source of distress to us to find that no corrections for tide woull balance ebb an<l flood at Wall street, and with such expert observers as Mr. H. L. Marindin and Mr. J.B. Weir, there was little chance of error; so we published the result with 42,000,000 of cubic teet excess of ebb (westerly) flow, and I referred to the discrepancy as perhaps an error of my own reduction. In 1885, however, we again gauged the East Ri\er at Old Ferry and "off Nineteenth street," sections nearly ten miles ~part, and found an exi.;ess of ebb over ftood of 432,000,000 and 418,000,000 cubic feet, respectively. In these gaugings, which were from shore to shore and from surface to bottom, Mr. Mari.ndin was again in charge of the observers, and we had Messrs. Haskell and Ritter as expert observers detailed from the work of the Mississippi River Commission. It is rare in pbysical studies that one is able, as in this instance, to connect cause and effect so intimately and prove the case from every point of view without discord anywhere; but this work in New York Harbor (done by patch-work with little money and wretched equipments as regards vessels) has bad the ad\'antage of first-rate obseffe1·s and no ulterior object. It illus· trates the value of a. physical study made for the sake of anything that might turn u11-a st1idy wbose only purpose was to find out what was going on.
MISCELLANEOUS.

Tbere are several branches of my foeme that are practica11y of little value, but which are of sufficient interest to bear brief notice. I have spoken of the time of the tide as if it were represented by high and low water; but this is not the case in "interfer·ences," where the profiles are distorted. Here we should take the progress of the middle of the figure, and iu the following talile l\:Ir. Bradford has compil<'d such data:

that the experience of the tide propagated through the sound, as distinguished from tile same tide presenting itself at the Sandy Hook entrance, is represented almost exclusively in the augmentation and retard of the semi-diurnal wave. The diurnal element, when e\·oked by t110 folding backwards and forwards in interrnls of a half day each, proves to be much the same currn in either case. By the folding process just reforred to and by the exercise of considerable ingenuity with "trial and error," l\Ir. Bradford and Mr. Ritter have constructed the following table (12) and diagram (F), in which there are "graphical corrections" and "adjustments" not >entured upon in the preceding exhibits of this report. The results, however, warrant the statement that Governor's Island tide and \Villets Point tide can each of them be so decomposed that a diurnal element common to both is discovered, and that this element appears at the same time at Governor's Island that it does at Willets Point.

The diurnal oscillation, being small and of long duration, reqnir<'s bnt little action, and betrays therefore little re-action. It is not appreciably change1l by its journey through Long Island Sound. The same is true of other oscillations of great amplitude, as, for instance, the halfmonthly fluxes. In my study of the Bay of Fundy tide (see .Appendix No. 10, .Annual Report Coast and Geodetic Survey, 18i9) I found that the semi-diurnal tide rei·ersed as it passed from the .Atlantic into the Gulf of Maine, but the diurnal tide di(l not.

This comparison of the mean levels for Governor's Island and Willets Point, for the month of October, furnishes but little positive information. At zero declination of the moon and at max· iumm declination (north or son th) tho tides from the Sonn<l ·and those from .the Sandy Hook entrance rise and fall from the same absolute plane ; but at the time of rapid change of declina· tion especially on the increase, our computations furnish discordant results. There is no rl:'gu]ar half monthly flux through New York Harbor recurring with similar declinations of the moon; but there is evidently an irregular flux-often of many days' duration-dependent upon the rourse of the wind. .As might be expected, northeasterly wimls blowing along the axis of Long Is1aud

Sound are the most potent iu disturbing the equilibrium at the Hell Gate entrance, the shallow waters of the Sound being heaped up and crowded up to leeward very considerably. In our singlemontb·s comparison we had no stormy weather, but a moderate northeasterly wind raised the mean le,el of the western end of Long Island Sound nearly a half foot abo\e the harbor on one occasion. In a former survey of Hell Gate I estimated the rise of a great northeast st-Orm at over G feet, the greatest rise on the open coast due to storms being 4 feet. The highest estimate that I have heard for the rise at Hell Gate is 8 feet, which occurred during an easterly gale. To this effect of easterly winds there is no counterpoise. Westerly winds cannot ha\e much effect in the short and narrow reaches approaching the Gate, and over a supposititious dam at Hallet's Point we behold the wind waters often welling over to the westward but perhaps never to the eastward. Until we can keep gauges in operation at both entrances to New York-i. e., at Sandy Hook, and Willets Point-for a year of good obsen-ations, we cannot determine any half monthly variations of mean level, nor can we measure the effects of winds. It is possible that without oonsideration of the winds we may be reckoning without our host in the physical scheme of New York Harbor. To return to the salient point of thig paper, viz, the determination of the direction of the net discharge by observing the difference in the elevation of the" lunes" at the meeting of the tides, I desire to call attention to other applications of this key: .Between the southeastern angle of the coast of .Massachusetts and Cape Sable, No;a Scotia, a node occurs in the semi-diurnal tide, with profiles on either side closely resembling those on the two sides of Hell Gate.· In this case the currents at the entrance to the Gulf of :Maine are not flowing under the direct action of gravity in the sense that we sh<luld speak of the flood and ebb of' the East River; but when we leave the open sea and turn to the Barrington Passage at Cape Sable or the Vineyard Sound of Massachusetts, we entertain something like tlJe same problem that we have in the East River, and a net movement in one direction must be involved. If, for instance, we plot the tidal profiles of Monomoy (or Great Point, Nantucket) with the tidal profile of Menemsha .Bight (Gay Head), we discover that the westwardly slope lies at an average stage of about 0.25 feet above the average stage of the eastwardly slope; and although variations of ratio of perimeter to section hardly count for anything in these broad sounds we must admit, as inevitable, a. net movement westward. We actually find from observation that the differences of stage either way from West Chop contratlict each other, but that in the adjustment, slope replaces stage, and in the Narrows between West Chop and Nobska we have a preponderance of westerly slope out of all proportion to the opposing inequalities of duration. I am quite aware that this part of my theme is very obscure in the absence of diagrams, but I have thought it well to record these phenomena, kindred to those of the East River, because the bar at New York is by antithesis placed in the same category of obstructions to which the Monomoy Shoals belong. At New York Bar tbe net movement is outward towards the ocean, and the shoals are thrust back; but the southern tidal current on the outi;ide of Cape Cod falling at high stage is the active agent in sweeping the shore sands down to the mouth of Nantucket Sountl where they find a movement westward, i. e., into the Hound. It is a rare case; but the march of the shoals seems to bear out our view of the agencies at work. (See Appendix No. 8, Annual Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1886, and Appendix ..A, Annual Report Harbor and Land Commission of lfassachus<!tts, 1886; see also a. paper intended for publication in the next Annual Report, entitled "Movements of the Sands at the Entrance to Vineyard Sound.") fo the'' Report of the .Ad\·isors Council of the Joint Committee of t11e Massachusetts Legislature" on the proposed Cape Cod Canal, 1860, there is a sketch of mine to be found showing the tides of Barnstable Bay and Buzzartl's Bay as simultaneously observed. This sketch resembles closely the one we have given for the Hell Gate interference, and in a similar way predetermines the direc. tion of the net discharge through the canal. In the canal sket-Oh the mean slope in either direction is 3.40 feet, and the difference of stage (as indicated by the mean difference in the elevations of the "Junes") is 1.42 feet in favor of the west;erly ti<lal current. In other words, the current which will run to the westward from Barnstable Bay to Buzzard's Bay will find 1.42 feet more water than
·see Appendix No. 10, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report, 1879.

its alternatirn; it will therefore bave greater velocity and greater transverse section, ancl conse. qnently much greater discharge. In this instance, more cous1)icuously than in the natural canal at New York, this circulation to be induceJ by the Uape Cotl Canal presents a paratlox. Here are two seas now on the same mean level, and the tides are only oscillations equally above and below this same mean level, yet the canal, 1chen opened, will gilie rise to a resultant flow in one direction tendi·ng to' disturb the le·vel. From similar reasoning one might predict that if a ship-canal witl.10ut gates could be buiit from the Bay of Fundy to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, there would be a net discharge towards the Saint Lawrence. Aud, similarly, if a free canal be built across the Isthmus of Panama there will l>e a resultant flow from ti.le Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea. HENRY MITCHELL, Assistant.. F. 8.
