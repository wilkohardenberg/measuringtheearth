REPORT.
CO.AST SURVEY OFFICE, BANGOR, MAINE,

November 3, 1857.
Sm: In compliance with the law of :I 853, and with the regulations of the Treasury Departme:o.t, I have the honor to present my report on the progress of the Coast Survey of the United States during the past year, or from November 1, 1856, to the same date in 1857. The survey has been in progress, in its field or office work, during the past year, in all the States and Territories of the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific coasts, where it is not essentially completed. Since the commencement of the work, the extensive coasts of Florida and Texas, and of California, and Oregon and Washington Territories, have been added to the Union. I propose to retain the same division for this report as of the one immediately preceding it. 'l'he general divisions are three in number-the introduction, the description of operations, and the appendix. I. The introduction gives a general notice of the progress of the survey, with references to more detailed accounts of the operations in the second and third parts of the report. The estimated progress for the next year, on the same scale as for several years past, is next given, with the estimates necessary to insure that progress. Any change in the means furnitohed, will, of course, change The rate of advance, and, as there is a certain definite amount of coast to be surveyed, will change the date of completion of the work. The present scale of progress is a more economical one than a smaller scale, as has frequently been shown. It is estimated that, with the same means provided for the last two years, the field work on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts may be essentialJy completed in nine to eleven years. II. The second part of the report gives a detailed account of the work in the field and afloat, . and of the office work, arranged under the head of geographical sections, numbered from one to eleven, beginning at the northeastern extremity of the United States, and passing to the south· ward and westward on the .Atlantic and Gulf of M~xico, and from the southward on the Pacific coast to the northward and westward. ~ Each section forms a chapter of the report, and the operations are 1mbdivided acoording to the class to which they belong and the officer conducting them. , The statistics reported by the several chiefs of parties are given in these chapters, and indW:ate, in a general way, the progress made. .A brief reference to the progress of the section, a.ud to the several operations described in the chapter, precedes each chapter. The appenti is subdivided as follows: 1. Fkl.d, hgdrographic, and qf!i.ce rletails, included in general lists, showing the distribution of the parties along the coast ; the names of army and navy officers attached to the work ; ite~s of information communicated in reply to applicatiom1 made within the year ; the statistic& of field and office work ; the detached surveys made on the 1$

GEOGRAPHICAL SECTIONS-ESTIMATES OF PROGRESS AND OF COMPLETION.

The limits of the geographical sections into which, for convenience, the coast has been subdivided, with the best estimate which I can make of relative progress, are given below, estimated upon the present resources and regular rate of progress. As a general rule, unless when the character of particular localities, as the Nantucket shoals and Florida reefs, for example, requires a different courso, the sections should niake a similar general progress, so as to be finished at the same time. This condition would have been readily fulfilled had the survey been begun in each at one date, and the scale of the work been at once raised to meet it with the determination to continue it. As the work was commenced at very different periods, so now the sections are at different stages of advance ; but, by pushing those begun later, they have in a degree overtaken the others, so as to make the date of completion much less irregular than might be supposed. SECTION I. From Passamaquoddy bay to Point Judith, induding the c()(L8t of the States Qf Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.-This section is more than half (six-tenths) done, and may be finished, the triangulation in eight years, and the topography and hydrography in from ten to twelve. This will, however, require close management to accomplish, and the most favorable use of the resources. The primary triangulation will be finished in say three years, and the number of the other parties may then be increased. The triangulation was begµn in this section in 1843. SECTION II. From Point Judith to Oape HenJ,open, inLludi'IU} t'lre coa8t of o~. New York, New Jersey, PennSylvan:ia, arUJ part <>f Delaware.-This is essentially completed. A part of the rivers and some revision work remain, all of which will be completed incidentally as parties are available for other portions of the work. SECTION UI. From Oape HenJnpen to (Jape Henlrg, im~ t'M··(f()fl(Jt· cf part· of Delaware, Maryland, and part of Virginia, is more than thTee-fourtbs (eight-tenths) done, and the remain· ing operations are generally of a class resembling thotJe of the last section, and, with certain leading ones steadily provided for, wtll be executed as parlies are available. The climate in this and the preceding section favors this arrangement, which is, besides, under the circumstances, the most economical. This sootion is characterized by the importance of its great interior bay, the Chesapeake. The triangulation was begun in 1842·.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

SECTION IV. From Gape Henry to Cope Fear, including part of the coast of Virginia and, North Carolina.-This section is rather more than half done, in<'luding the land and water work. The preliminary triangulation of the outer coast is finished, and more than one-third of the interior triangulation. The topography of the coast and of more than two-thirds of the interior sounds is done. The triangulation of Pamplico sound, with its rivers, with average success, will take five years, but there is at present no party available for it. The hydrography should be completed in seven to ten.years at the present rate. 'the most dangerous parts of this coast have been done, and, if there were a special object in doing so, this section could easily be pushed to completion earlier; but three others will need the resources more, in order to bring them up to time. SECTION V. From Cape Foor to the St. Mary's river, including part of the ooaBt of North GarOlina, and the C-0<1/Jt ef South GarOlina and Georgia.-This section is nearly half (four-tenths) done. With the number of parties now engaged there, it may be completed in seven years. The triangulation was begun in 1849. It will probably be expedient, after a few years, to diminish the number of parties in this section, applying the means to others which have made less progress. The progress in these five Atlantic coatit sections is, on the average, nearly two-thirds towards completion, estimating in due proportion all the operationt:1. SECTION VI. From St. Mary's river to St. Joseph's bay, including the cc1,.9tern and part qf the western coast ef Florida, arid the Fl-0riila reefs and looys.-This sectiou is about one-fourth done, if \Ve estimate by extent, and more if we take the importance of the work executed into con· sideration, and, if the present rate of appropriation is continued, can readily be finished in ten years. If not, it may be difficult to bring the work on the main coast to a close as early a.s the other sections. The character of that essential work, however, is so much changed by the line across the head of the peninsula, permitting th~ substitution of a small secondary triangulation, that it may come out earlier than I now suppose'. Two or three years hence I can form a better estimate. The line across the peninsula can be done, at the present rate of appropriation, probably in two years. SECTION VII. From St. Joseplt' s bay lo Mobile bay, includi1ig part of the coast ef Florida awi .Alabama.-This was the last section commenced, and it is perhaps between one-sixth and onefifth done. It will require additional force to push it through in ten to twelve yea"!"s. This may probably be had, as the Atlantic sections require fewer parties to bring them to a close; but I cannot foresee positively yet. Good progress has been made since we commenced this work in 1852; and there are three centres of operation-near Pensacola, near Apalachicola and St. Mark's, and near Cedar keys. If we had means to employ a steam vessel here throughout the season, there would be 110 doubt of the completion of this section v.>ith the others. The topography and hydrography are simple in their character generally. S.ECT10N vm. From .Mobile bay to Vermi.l£oo bay, including the coast ef .M"'/,SSissippi and part ef Lmi.tiana.-This was the first commenced on the Gulf, and is between one-third and one-half done. There are two centres of operation; and with the present means, there can be no difficulty in essentially completing the work within ten years. To do this, the parties must, however, be kept steadily at work in tlie section, and cannot be spared for work in those adjacent. 8~'1'10li IX. Ft'Om 'VermiUori 'bay to tJUJ southiuestern boundary/, incllUiing part. ef the coast ef ~ and rxJa8t ~ Te:M8.-This 11ection was commenced soon after Section VIII, and the coast has less of detail work need~d than any other on the Gulf.

third done, and can readily be finished with the present force in ten years. A less force, however, will not accomplish it ; and, indeed, there may be a new centre of operations necessary at the northern end of the section, requiring additional means to be furnished. These sections on the Gulf are very expensive, compared with those on the Atlantic, in regard to the subsistence of parties and the means of transportation ; and the fact must be considered in estimating for them from data derived chiefly from the Atlantic sections. Taking all the operations into consideration, the Gulf sections are nearly one-third done, and can, at th~' present rate of appropriation, be completed in from ten to twelve years by close economy and thorough efficiency of arrangement. Nothing less will do.

ST.A.TEME..~T

OF PROGRESS.

A reference to the map, (Sketch No. 64,) which shows the sheets projected for preliminary and general coast charts of the United States, will enable me to describe intelligibly the present condition of progress on the Atlantic and Gulf coast, and to show the limits of the geographical sections, and give an estimate of progress connected with each. The work is certainly more than half done on the Atlantic and Gulf coast, and the appropriations now made, secure every year a much more considerable rate of progress than in the average of the past years. Notwithstanding the increased cost of supplies of every kind, the rate of progress has been more than kept up in proportion to the means expended. When the survey was upon a small scale very little division of labor was practicable, and the change of the parties from north to south, according to season, could not be made to advantage. If the plan now in successful operation for several years is carried out without interruption, the essential completion of the Atlantic and Gulf work within the time already named (ten to twelve years) is almost certain. This is, of course, more to the interest of commerce and navigation and of the government than to that of the persons engaged in the work. The credit of taking part in a great work successfully completed will, however, jf I understand their spirit, more than repay them for the more short-lived character of their positions. Up to this time I have always had the most cordial support of the officers of the survey in the extension of the work, though obviously diminishing by many years the duration of the work. Fifty-three base lines, ten principal, and forty-three preliminary, have been measured on different parts of the coast. Upon these rests the triangulation which is now continuous from Mount Desert, in Maine, to Shallotte inlet, south 6f Cape Fear, in North Carolina; stretching over more than ten degrees of latitude, and as many of longitude, including the coast of ten States and the greater part of the coast of two others. Then, with an interval of"about seventy miles, it extends along the coast of South Carolina and Georgia with two gaps, which this season will fill, to Ossabaw entrance. It covers, on the coast of Georgia, Sapelo entrance, and St. Simon's and Brunswick harbor ; St. :Mary's, Georgia ; and Fernandina harbor, and St. John's river, Florida. It is continuous from Virginia key, Cape Florida, to the Marquesas, west of Key West, completing the connexion of the outer keys and reefs of south Florida. On the western coast of Florida it extends from Cryf'IW river to beyond Cedar keys ; over Ocilla river entrance ; St. Mark's harbor; from East Pass through St. George's and St. VinceJit' s sounds, including Apalachicola harbor; St. Andrew's bay and Pensacola harbor and approaches. On the coast of Alabama and Mississippi, it crosses Mobile bay and the approaches ; Mississippi sound and part of Lake Pontchartrain, connecting Mobile and

New Orleans. On the coast of Louisiana, Chandeleur sound to Isle au Breton wund; Isle Derniere and Caillou bay ; A tchafalaya and part of Cote Blanche bays. On the coast of Texas, Galveston entrance and East and West bays, and the coast to include Matagorda bay, and the entrance to the Rio Grande. On the coast of California, the main triangulation is complete from north of Sonoma mountain to south of Monterey bay, and the secondary triangulation connected with this along the coast line is nearly completed. Secondary triangulation has been made at San Diego; near San Pedro; along the Santa Barbara coast, and on the Santa Barbara islands ; in San Francisco, San Pablo, Suisun, Ballenas, Drake's, and Tomales bay;;. The river entrances of the coast of Oregon have been surveyed, and Columbia river triangulated to .Astoria. On the coast of Washington Territory, Shoal water bay, ""'r ashington sound, .Admiralty inlet, and parts of Puget's Sound and Hood's canal have been triangulated. Where the main triangulation did not afford the requisite facilities for progress, preliminary triangulations have been executed in advance of them, to serve as a basis for the detailed work, and to be verified in turn. The topography, giving the coast-line and so much of the shores as may be essential to recognition by the mariner, and to give the nearest land commuuication, has been kept generally within one season of the triangulation. The hydrography has followed closely in turu. The in-shore hydrography i8 nearly continuous along the coast from Cape N eddick, in :Maine, to Ocracoke, in North Carolina, with gap8, which two or three seasons will probably fill. Kennebec entrance and part of Casco bay, in :Maine, are, besides, done. The difficult off-shore work towards George's bank has made good progress, and the broken ground of the ~:m tucket shoals has been completely sounded. The hydrography of the coast of North Carolina is in vigorous·progress, being complete from Hatteras tu Portsmouth, beyond Ocracoke; from Cape Lookout to south of Beaufort, and at Cape Fear and approaches. The in-shore work on the coast of South Carolina is nearly complete ; Winyah bay and,. Georgetown harbor are done, and the so,undings are complete from Winyah bay to Tybee entrance. On the coast of Georgia, Tybee entrance and Savannah river, to the head of .Argyle island, are finished; also St. Simon's entrance, Turtle river, and Brunswick harbor, to the north end of Blythe island, and St. :Mary's entrance. Reconnaissances have been made of St. Andre·v's sound and Doboy eutrauce. On the coast of Florida, Fernandina harbor is completely surveyed, and St. John's entrance and river, to Jacksonville. The hydrography of the Florida reef is complete from near Oape Florida· to Rodriguez bank, and from Loggerhead key to the Marquesas, and Key Biscayno bay has been sounded out. There is a reconnaissance of Tampa bay. The hydrography is complete from Waccasassa point to Cedar keys, inclusive; of Ocilla river entrance; of St. :Mark's harbor; St· .Andrew's bay, and Pensacola entrance and harbor. The hydrography is complete of Mobile hay, Mississippi sound, and coast outside of the chain of islands, and westward into Lake Borgne, and of part of Ohandeleur sound. Much off-shore hydrography has been done in connexion with this in-shore work, and both classes of hydrography keep close upon the triangulation and topography. There is a reconnaissance of the passes of the Mississippi. The hydrography of part of Caillou bay, behind Isle Derniere, is complete, and that of Atchafalaya bay is in progress. Galveston bay and entrance are complete, and East and West bays in part finished. The in-shore work of the CQast of Texas is nearly done between Galveston and Matagorda entrances. There is a reconnaissance of Aransas pass, and a survey of the Rio Grande entrance.

SUPERINT:ENPENT OF

On the Western Coast, San Diego bay and harbor, Cortez bank, San Clemente anchorage, Santa Catalina harbor ; the coast of Santa Barbara channel, between Point Duma and San Buenaventura; Prisoners' harbor, Cuyler' s harbor, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Coxo, and Monterey harbors; San Pedro, San Francisco, San Pablb, and Suisun bays, and Mare Island strait, have been sounded out. Ballenas and Drake's bays ; Haven's anchorage, Mendocino City harbor, Shelter cove, Humboldt harbor, and Trinidad bay, Crescent city and Ewing harbors, Umpquah river, Columbia river entrance, Shoalwater bay, Gray's harbor; Nee-ah ' harbor, New Dungeness, and False Dungeness, in the Strait of Fuca ; Canal de Haro and Rosario strait and approaches ; Blakely harbor ; and in Admiralty inlet, Puget's sound, and Hood's canal ; Port Townshend, Port Ludlow, Port Gamble, Olympia and Steilacoom harbors, and Bellingham bay, have been surveyed in a preliminary way, and charts have been published. 'l'he field work is now so far done that it is easy to see that a few years more must bi-ing it to a close on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, if a steady progress at the pre!Olent rate is secured by the usual appropriations. It is much more easy now, upon the .Atlantic coast, to state what remains to be done than what hail heen done. Filling up a gap of seventy miles on tho coast of Maine, of seventy miles on the coast of North and South Carolina, of seventy-five miles on the coast of Georgia, and of three hundred and forty miles on the coast of Florida, would give a continuous triangulation, either main or secondary, from Quoddy Head to Cape Florida. The time of completion of the work is merely a question of the means furnished, for we have now, not only trained officers steadily, adively, and intelligently working in their several spheres of duty, but many in inferior grades who are quite ripe for higher occupations. The survey is essentially a temporary work, and its whole organization is adapted to that idea. It has thus the advantage of adapting the number and qualities of its employees to the amount and kind of work, and is able to recognize the principle of promotion by merit, for which the quantity and quality of the work furnish a mathematical basis. · The resources being applied from year to year to the varying state of relative progress in the different op0'rations, the progress for a given extent of coast is determined by the scale of appropriation. A comparison of the relative progress, in the earlier stages of the work, showed clearly that it was more economical to conduct it upon a large scale than upon a small one. The division of labor, and facilities for working on diiferent parts of the coast during different seasons of the year, produce the chief part of this economy. The sooner the facilities of a survey can be presented to a growing commerce and navigation the better. The ex.tent of the coast being determined, economy-and utility both indicate that the appropriations should be such as to push the work vigorously to completion. A recent reinvestigation of the question of economy has shown me that for an increase, in 1855, of appropriation, from the average of 1844 to 1849, of two and three-tenths, the work done in the field is two and six-tenths, and in the office upwards of three, showing the economy of the larger scale aH amounting to some eighteen per eent. The charts have kept pace with the field work, preliminary ones being published for ea.ch year's work, in advance of the elaborate finished :maps. The principal dangerous looa.lities -0n the coast have been surveyed, and charts p11blitdted in advance of connected work; thus, of the Nantucket and Monomoy shoals, Hatteras shoals, the Frying Pan and Oape Fear shoals, Cape

Roman shoals, Oanaveral shoals, and others. The same course has been taken in regard to localities affording facilities for commerce and navigation, and nearly half the harbors and most of the important inlets of the coast have been surveyed, and charts of them have been published. Every season, as the hydrographic work comes in, a preliminary chart is drawn and engraved, and the engraved plate is added to, year by year, by the electrotype process. This is done accordjng to a project determined beforehand, as early ,.as the limits of the coast are known with sufficient precision. Charts of two hundred and thirty-five harbors, inlets, shoals, sounds, bays, and portions of the coast and rivers, have been drawn, engraved, and published. The number of maps, charts, and sketches drawn within the year, or now in progress, (as will be seen by reference to Appendix No. 22,) is ninety-five; and the number engraved, or yet 1n hand, is eighty-four. or these, twenty-nine ar~ first class maps, twenty-six are preliminary 0harts, and twenty nine are sketches and diagrams. The fott of published maps, charts, and "ketches, (.Appendix No. 22.) shows that one hundred and forty-eight sheets may be had of the general disbursing agent of the Coa;:;t Survey, and of local agents in the principal marts of commerce. Within the year seventy sheets have been published, including those with the report of 1856. The number of copies distributed under the act of Congress and regulation of the Treasury Dep:utment within the ~rear is nineteen thousand Reven hundred and ninety-five.

The general distribution of the parties, and the progress made by each one, is stated in tabular form in Appendix No. 1. By the help of the map of the coast, (Sketch No. 6i,) this progress of the work in the fiflld and afloat can be minutely followed by referring to the table. This progress to November 1, 1857, may bo briefly stated as foll~ws:
SECTION I. Coast ef MaiM, New Hampskire, Massachu,selts, and Rltode Isl.and.-(Skeicltes Nos. 1 and 2.)-A base of verification of between five and six miles in length has been measured on Epping Plains, Washington county, Maine, and the ends have been permanently marked. Astronomical and magnetic stations have been occupied at Bangor and Calais, Maine, at which telegraphic differences of longitude by the American method, latitude, and the magnetic elements, have been determined. The astronomical station at Bangor has been finally connected with the prima.ry triangulation in the vicinity. The secondary triangulation has been extended eastward on the Sheepscot river to Wiscasset, over Townsend and Linican bays, including the Damiscove islands, near the entrance of Kennebec river. The topography of the shores of the Kennebec has been extende.d northward to include Bath, and of those of Casco bay from Cape Small Point towards Harpswell, and from the mouth of Yarmouth river to join with work in the vicinity of Portland. The shores of most of the islands in Casco bay have been surv.ayed. Tae topography of the shores of Plymouth harbor, extending northward from Back river, aear :Ouxbury, :US been eompleted. Revision work has been done near Provincetown, Massachusetts. The hydrography of the Kenneboo river has been c.:rried northward to tliit) upper limits of Bath; tha~of the eastern end of Casoo bay has been executed between Oape Small Point &nd the meridian of Ragged·island. The off-shore work 'between the coast of Hassachus~tts and George's bank and beyond George's has made good progress, as also the in~shore 80Gndings north of Oape .A.nn towards Portsmouth, N. H. Additional hydrography

SECTION IL Coast ef Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and part of Ddaware.( Sketches No. 11-15.)-Some additional triangulation in New York harbor has been done; the triangulation of Hudson river has been extended from Poughkeepsie northward to above Roundout. The topography of the islands in New York harbor, of the shores of New Jer1:iey, opposite New York, from Bergen Neck to Guttenberg, and of the shores from Throg's Neck to Harlem river, has been executed. SomB hydrography of revision has been executed near New York, and the soundings of the Hudson river have been extended above Newburgh. This work was generally in prosecution of the regular operations of the section, the aid from the New York commissioners having ceased in April.

ESTIM.ATES.

In my report of last year I remark : ''As the prices of all commodities and of labor in.crease in our country, the amount of work which we can execute for a given appropriation is, of course, diminished. The present scale of the appropriations does not quite meet this increase, and may fall so far short of it as to require a new appeal in regard to it. This I shall, of course, avoid, if it is at all possible. The expenses of the parties in the sections on the Gulf of Mexico are also considerably greater than on the Atlantic coast." In accordance with the spirit of those remarks, I prepared (October 19, 1857) the annual estimates, to be presented for the examination of the Secretary of the Treasury, with the usual explanatory letter which I now embody here, omitting only the general statement of progress of the work, already given in this report : "The estimates provide for the 'scale of progress heretofore approved by the Treasury Department and by Congress. The items are the same as for the last two years, with two exceptions. The estimate needed for fuel and quarters, and for transportation for officers of the army serving on the work, in consequence of a surplus from the former estimatm:i, is Iese than heretofore; and the withdrawal of the naval engineers, hitherto detailed for the Coast Survey steamers, requires an estimate for the pay of steam engineers. ' 'The progress upon which these estimates are based is stated under the head of the several sections of the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coa.sts, and the sums estimated are the least which can insure the amount of work stated. They include, as usual, the office as well as field work, and are intended to keep the former as near the latter as practicable.' 1 '' The past year has, owing peculiar circumstances, not determined the question of insufficiency of the western coast appropriation, referred to in my last annual r-eport, and I have therefore not advised an increase.'' "The line across the Florida. peninsula proves very practicable, and will be of great advantage to the survey, connecting the main triangulation of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, and preventing the necessity of reliance upon .the small triangulation across the Florida peninsula

u;

for such a purpose. As a measure of economy, it is also of great advantage. It is possible that the sum now asked may nearly or quite complete this work." '' Several of the older vessels of the survey require more thorough repairs than can be given from the current resources, and provision is made therefor by an item in the estimates.'' ''The estimates, which are hereto appended in detail, show the progress proposed to be secured by them during the fiscal year 1858-' 59." These estimates suppose the same aid from the War, Na''Y· and Interior Departments, as heretofore. Should any part of this be withheld, the proportionate progress must, of course, be less. The table shows, in parallel columns, the estimates for the next fiscal year, and the appropriation of the present year :

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

For pay and rations of engineers for seven steamers used in the hydrography of the Coast Survey, no longer supplied by the Navy Department.····· · · · · · · · · · · · · · $12,800 In a communication from the Treasury Department, received by me after these estimates were sent, but before they had reached the department, I was advised that, ''In view of the existing embarrassed financial condition of the country, and the greatly diminished receipts from revenue, it becomes incumbent on the department to bring down the estimates for all work8 under its control to the lowest figure possible. "It will he expected, therefore, that you will reduce your estimates accordingly, applying the amounts asked for to such portions of the work as are indispensably necessary." To meet this view of the department, I made a supplementary communication, (October 21,) stating that, "Under the view entertained in your letter of the 14th, if the measure meet your approval, the publication of the records and results of the Coast Survey might be suspended during the next fiscal yeaT, and the estimates for that purpose be omitted for that year. This would diminish the estimates of my letter of October 19 by $15, 000. "If a further reduction is necessary, I would advise that $5, 000 be taken from each of the following items : For the line across the Florid'a peninsula; for repairs of vessels ; and for fuel and quarters of army officers employed on the survey. These will make a further reduction of $15, 000, and a total reduction of $30, 000. I hope, however, that tho first named reduction may suffice. "A contraction of the scale of the work is not an economical process, as has been shown by comparisons of the survey in former years on different scales. Omitting to complete operations which are begun and in progress, will lead to much loss and waste. The signals are temporary, and the operations must follow each other closely to be conducted with economy."

DEPTIIS OF HARBOR BARS, CIIANNELS, L"TC.

The table of depthR contained in my last annual report has been revised and extended, according to the latest tidal results, and is republished in Appendix No. 21.
SAILING DIRECTIONS.

Preliminary arrangements are making for the printing of the sailing directions, notices of dangers, &c., compiled from the records of the Coast Survey, under the act of Congress making appropriation for publishing tho records and results of the survey. The volume now in preparation will contain directions for entering ninety-three L.arbors, and for seventeen bays, sounds, &c.
MAPS AND CHARTS.

In my report of last year I explained, succinctly, the character of the different maps and charts of the coast which had be~u projected. They were subdivided into coai,;t or in->-'lwre maps and charts, general coast or off-shore charts, and harbor maps and charts, in reference to their uses and positions. In regard to their style of execution, they were subdivided into sketches, preliminary charts, and finished maps and charts. I stated the progress maile in theE<e several classes, and especially tho efforts in regard to the finished maps, which, requiring firstclass engravers, have made extraordinary efforts necessary in procuring them. We have now eight first-class engravers at work, but those who have recently joined the office have not all yet succeeded as fully as is desirable in working up to the style of execution. 'l'o meet this, certain changes of style have been necessary, in order not to lose too much time, the result of which is yet an experiment. The following project for maps and charts, thirty in number, have been submitted and approved during the year, and given to the office for execution: Kennebec river, Maine ; Wood's Hole, Massachusetts ; Provincetown harbor, lfassachusett~ ; New York bay and harbor, preliminary and comparative; Rappahannock river, Virginia, lower part, and combination of six sheets; York river, Virginia; Hampton Roads; Norfolk harbor; Beaufort harbor, North Carolina, comparative chart; preliminary coast chart. of North and South Carolina, Bull's bay; St. Mary's river, Georgia and Florida; map of reconnaissance

from Fernandina to Cedar Keys, Florida, comparative of St. John's river, Florida ; W accasassa bay, Florida; Apalachicola river, Florida; Pensacola harbor; Mississippi city; St. Louis bay and Shieldsboro' harbor, Mississippi; Grand Island Pass and Pearl river, Louisiana; Galveston bay, Texas; entrance to Matagorda bay, Texas; San Diego bay, California; Monterey bay, California; entrance to Santa Barbara channel, California; San Antonio creek, California ; and Mare Island strait, California. Of these, six are preliminary, and twenty-four are harbor charts. The coast-line is now generally known with sufficient accuracy to render it practicable to' prepare projects for a general series of maps according to the scales, and for the objects heretofore adopted. These projects have been taken up from time to time, and laid down again for want of more precise materials to be furnished in the progress of the survey, or for more thorough and mature study after preliminary examinations and discussions. The three classes of maps and charts, of which the study has been resmned, are the preliminary seacoast charts on the scale of cro'o ; the general coast charts or off-shore charts on the scale of 40o'oo 0 , and the finished coast maps (in-shore) on the scale of <fvioo· The first and second named series have been approved, subject merely to alteration in the details, and the third, after modification, has been retained for further study. The several sheets of these different classes of maP.§l and charts form, of course, part of the series. The series of harbor charts is additional to those just referred to. The general classification of the maps and charts resulting from the survey. has been given in my report for 1856.
PRELIMINARY SEACOAST CHARTS.

T.hese useful charts have been growing as the work advanced, but the subject was hardly, until recently, mature for projects for a general series. Under my immediate direction, Mr. A. Boschke has presented a plan, which is favorably improved, in which the whole coast of the .Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico is given in thirty-two chart projects on the scale of 200\nru· or about three miles to the inch. These will give the shore-line, and all the in-shore, and part of the off-shore hydrography, and they will, as far as practicable, be a series, so that con,secntive sheets may be mounted together and form continuous charts, suitable for the office or counting room, while the separate sheets will be used upon the table, or be bound in an atlas. The coast of Maine, from Eastport to Portland, is given in one series of two sheets; New Hampshire and part of Massachusetts, to include Cape Cod and the Nantucket shoals, in two sheets ; Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, from Nantucket to Barnegat, in two sheets; New Y~rk, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, from Fire island to Cape Lookout, in four sheets; North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, 'from Cape Hatteras to the St. John's river, in five over-lapping sheets-the first embracing Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout, the second Cape Lookout and Cape Fear, the third Cape Fear and Cape Roman, the fourth Cape Roman and Tybee entrance, the fifth Tybee and the St. John's; Florida peninsula in three series-the first in three sheets, extending from the St. John's to Cape Florida ; the second in two sheets, from Cape Florida to the Tortugas ; the third in three sheets, from Cape Roman to St. Mark's ; Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, from St. Mark's to New Orleans, in three sheets; Louisiana and Texas, from the passes of the Mississippi to Galveston, in three sheets ; Texas, from Galveston to Corpus Christi, in two sheets ; and Texas, from Corpus Christi to the Rio Bravo del Norte, in one sheet. The detail& of the limits of these sheets will, of course, be carefully studied as the work

23

advances. Materials are already collected for beginning eighteen of them; for nearly completing five ; for completing six; leaving parts of the coast untouched by the survey in but three. Of these charts, twelve have been already commenced, and will grow from year to year as the work continues, the sheets being joined by the electrotype process. Eight of the charts are nearly or quite completed, falling into the systematic arrangement. In some casefl these charts will, perhaps, be omitted in favor of the finished charts already executed.
GENERAL COAST CHARTS, OR OFF-SHORE CHARTS .

This series has been the subject of repeated study by different assistants, and the last project of Mr. Boschke has seemed to me so successful that I have adopted it for general guidance in the office, subject to such modifications in details as tho progress of the work may require. It gives the coast of the Atlantic and Gulf of .Mexico in sixteen sheets. Of these, the Atlantic series is comprised in nine sheets, for which there are materials for beginning the whole in the office, and I propose to imblish on this scale, and as preliminary with the reports of the year, by lithography, stone engraving or transfer, such portions of these charts as are finished from time to time, referring them by their numbers to the complete charts. The limits of the .Atlantic ;;;eries and its prog1·ess are as follows : No. I. Qu<Xidy He.ad to Oape- Cod, Eastport to Provincetown, (seacoast of .Maine, New Hampshire, and part of Massachusetts.) II. Cape .A.nn and Jt;ifries Bank to Gay Head and Davis Shoal, including George's Bank and the Nantucket shoals, (seacoast of Massachusetts and part of Rhode falaud.) III. Gay Head to Cape Herdopen, including Long Island Sound and New York bay, (seacoast of part of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and part of Delaware.) IV. Cape May to Currituck, (seacoast of part of New Jersey and Delaware, of Maryland, Virginia, and part of North Carolina.) V. Gm·rituck to Gape- Fear, including the Wimble, Hatteras, Cape Lookout, and Cape Fear shoals, (seacoast of Nor th Carolina.) VI. Ocracoke to ·t;harleston, (seacoast of part of North and South Carolina.) VII. Winyak bay to the St. John's river, (seacoast of part of South Carolina, of Georgia, and of part of Florida.) VIII. St. John's river to Gape Florida, (seacoast of Florida.) Of these No. III has been published; materials are in the office for nearly completing Nos. II and IV, for more than half of the land work and hydrography of No. VII, for the land work and portions of the hydrography of No. V, for two-thirds of the land work and portions of the hydrography of No. VI, for a third of the land work and a portion -0f the hydrography of No. I, and No. VIII is the only one for which there is a. mere beginning in materials collected. Direction$ have been given for the execution of the drawings of this series, and for arranging a.II the preliminary de.tails of their progress. Several of the charts have already been begun.

to the Coast Survey for the information in any use which may be made of it, and that the expense of furnishing it is defrayed by the parties desiring it. A special application for authority to communicate is made by the Superintendent to the Secretary of the Ti·easury in each case, but this authority has not been refused. The list of information furnished, stating the names of the persons to whom it has been supplied, is given in Appendix No. 5. It contains eighty-one cases of greater or less importanoe.
LISTS OF TOPOGRAPHICAL AND HYDROGRAPHIC SHEETS.

In connection with the matter just referred to, arid in part to facilitate applications for information, but also for the convenience of the Coast Survey itself, and to bring up the lists comrnuuicateu to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury in 1849, complete lists of the topographical and hydrographic sheets have been made out, aud are appended to this report, (Appendix Nos. 23 and 24.) They show the localities and limits of the sheets, the scale, date, by whom executed, and the numbers by which they have been registered in tho office, for reference. These lists contain, respectively, six hundred and eighty and six hundred and thirty-two titles. A. list of the capes, headlands, &c., surveyed on the western coast of the P nited States, will be found in the Appendix (No. G.)
GEOGRAPHICAL POSlTIONS.

Every two years the geographical positions determined m the course of the survey are published for the use of geographers, surveyors, navigators, and others. In the Appendix to the present report, No. 25, nine hundred and five additional positions are furnished, including points in Sections I to XI, inclusive of the coast. The progress sketches show the location of these points, the latitudes and longitudes of which, with the bearings and distances from each other, are given in the tables. The whole number of positions now published amounts to five thousand five hundred and sixteen.
LONGITUDES.

by the tel.egraphic method.-These have made due progress during the past year by the addition of the lines Montgomery-Mobile, Alabama, and Bangor-Calais, Maine, to the former results. We were disappointed iu reaching New Orleans, in consequence of the necessity for an intermediate station between the first two named cities. .A. detailed account of this work is given under the head of Sections I and VIII, to which it belongs. The southern connection is also referred to in Appendix No. 27. There is now completed a chain of telegraphic longitudes from Calais, in Maine, and upon the St. Croix river to Mobile, in Alabama. It consists of the following links, determining the differences 6f longitude of important stations: Calais-Bangor, Maine; Bangor-Cambridge, Massachusetts ; Cambridge-New York; New York-Philadelphia; Philadelphia.-Washington ; Washington-Petersburg, Virginia; Petersburg-Wilmington, North Carolina; WilmingtonOolumbia, South Carolina; Columbia-Macon, Georgia; Macon-Montgomery, Alabama.; :Montgomery-Lower Peach Tree, Alabama ; Lower Peach Tree-Mobile ; Baltimore-Washington ; Petersburg-Raleigh, North Carolina; Raleigh-Columbia South Carolina; Columbia--Charleston, South Carolina; Charleston-Savannah, Georgia, have also been determined by th<:i same method. This gives a series of differencea of longitude of very great value, unrivalled in any

foreign survey, and obtained by methods originating and perfected in the United States Coast Survey. It is admitted by scientific men who have examined these methods and those applied since their adoption in Europe, that we are still far ahead of our cotemporaries in the application of this admirable method for longitudes. We expect, in the next season, to reach New Orleans and to push the determinations between Washington and New Orleans by the western telegraph routes. We have already determined Washington-Pittsburg; Pittsburg-Cincinnati; Pittsburg-Hudson, Ohio; and Pittsburg--St. Louis, in this way. The original idea was, to use the continuous line to connect Washington and New Orleans, but the imperfect insulation prevents this, and the introduction of repeaters, which answer perfectly the purpose of transmitt.ing ~essages and renders imperfect insulation of much less consequence in the ordinarvmmunica_ tions of the lines, is an effectual bar to accurate longitude determinations. In consequence of this, we have been forced to the incidental determination of several points of great interest in the geography of the country, and, by connecting latitude and magnetic determinations with those for longitude, we have been enabled, without additional expense of any moment, to give the complete geographical determinations of those localities. The longitude connexion now embraces fourteen and a half degrees of latitude, and twenty and three-quarters of longitude, and a distance, in an air-line, of fifteen hundred miles, The report of Dr. B. A. Gould, in charge of the telegraph operations, is given in Appendix No. 27. While having charge of the southern telegraph work, Dr. Gould has been chiefly occupied in discussing the results of former observations, and in preparing them for publication; and the results of some telegraph operations are nearly ready for the printer. .A.mong the · interesting results of the discussion of telegraph longitudes, the variation of a signal given by tapping on the telegraph key from the mean is shown to be not very different from the variation in observation by the eye and ear of the best observers. The increase made of observations in a given time, the greatly diminished effort needed by the observer, the leRs necessity for experience and practice, and the decidedly smaller personal equation, constitute the great gain ~n the electro-magnetic method of observing over the ordinary method of astronomical observation. Another curious result which seems to come out from this discussion is, that the velocity of transmission of a signal is not the same when sent against and with the direction of the galvanic current. · A. special report gives full details of the discussion. Longituika by Sol,ar Eelipseii, Occuliations of Pl.e:ia.des and Moon Oulminati.ml8.-Tbe special researches of Professor Peirce upon this interesting subject have been noticed, and the progress made is stated in his able report in Appendix No. 29. A tribute is paid to the lamented S. C. Walker, to whom the merit is justly awarded of clearly pointing out the line of research needed for perfecting the longitude problem and of grappling with some of its most difficult details. The use of solar eclipses and the probable limit of accuracy of results derived from them is clearly stated, and the special researches and computations that are necessary and have been commenced by Professor Pierce, with the assistance of Dr. 0. H. F. Peters, are briefly hut distinctly recapitulated. The arrangements for observing the occultations of the Pleiades, as suggested by Professor Peiroo, have been steadily prosecuted under his direction. The predictions of the oooultations of M:arch 1, August 12, NovJ>mher 2, and December 27, 1857, were made and projected by Dr. Peters, and distributed to astronomers, in various parts of the United States and in Europe., from the Coast Survey office. Great attention has been paid, eepeci&lly by .astronomers of this country, to the suggestions of observation of these ocoultations, and prompt replies to the. letters relating to them have been received. 4$

REPORT OF THE .SUPERINTENDENT OF

Owing to the unfavorable state of the weather returns were received from only five stations, in March, and two in August. The occultations of November 2, were observed at eight places in the United States; in western Europe, where they were also visible, the state of the weather prevented observations. Considerable progress has been made in collecting the data for the computation of past observations. The new triangulation of the Pleiades, which it is supposed will be made ·with the heliometer of the Dudley Observatory, will complete the means of using the data thus", in process of collection. The beginning and end of the solar eclipse of March 25, were observed by Assistant George Da~son, at San Francisco, California, and his results forwarded to the office. . Professoh". C. Bond reports from the Cambridge Observatory, for the use of the survey, thirty moon culminations, seventeen occultations of stars by the moon, and a number of transits of certain bright points on the moon's disc. His report, which contains interesting remarks, is given in Appendix No. 28. '" . Longitude by Ohronometers.-The longitude of Fernandina being required for the air line ·'" triangulation across the head of the Florida peninsula, and no telegraphic line having been yet established between Savannah and that port, it was necessary to determine the difference of longitude by the transportation of chronometers as the next best resource under the circum· stances. A memoir, showing the nature of the operations and the method of reduction and results, is given in .Appendix No. 30. It is modified from a paper read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in which the incidental questions of personal equation and the like were deemed of more interest tha.n those now more prominently stated . as appropriate to this report. The superiority of the telegraph method of determining longi· gitudes could not be better indicated than by comparison with the labor bestowed to obtain these results, and the rough approximation fuially reached as compared with the corresponding time and accuracy of the method by telegraphic signals. This determination of the longitude of Fernandina. shows that the best charts are out some eight miles in this important position.

In 1851, I read at the Cincinna.ti meeting of the American .Association for the .Advancement of Science a paper cont&ining an account of Talcott' s method for observing latitude by the zenith telescope, then in full use in the Coast Survey, and by the kindness of the secretary was furnished with copies, which were distributed to the assistants of the Coast Survey and others. This original and excellent method is now ad.opted in the survey in preference to any other, and the form into which the observations and reductions have settled down is described in a cleiµ- report by Assistant Charles A.. Schott:, chief of the computing division, shown in Appendii No. 31. The report shows: (1) the principle of the method; (2) the mothte of d-etermini.ng the value of the micrometet- of the inatmment, with tables for recording th&'ol>servations and. for facilitating the oomputationa. reqnisit&; (3) the mode of determining the value of; tbe"le.vel U$ed with th& tp.e11COp4ii with.. form of reeol'd and comp~tation ; (4) the· oorreetiun fOl' refraction, with a table of oorrectiona; (6) th:e reduction tO the meridian witb tii.bles; (6) the rn).e.t for selecting. the pair.a of star&; (!ij the errors in· the determimttion of the· micrometer ~alu.~ ;.

EPPING BASE.

A paper giving a resume of the operations in grading and measuring this important base of verification is contained in the Appendix, (No. 26,) and is illustrated by a topographical sketch of the site, length and cross sections of the base. Views were taken by the photograph, showing the principal stages in the measurement, the signals at the ends, &c. Some of the principal details of this work are given in the chapter headed Section I.
LOSS OF MA.GNEI'IS:M BY MAGNETS USED IN OBSERV.ATION.

Appendix No. 32 contains a report by .Assistant Charles A. Schott on the loss of magnetism in the several magnets used by the assistants of the Coast Survey in their observations, illustrated by a diagram, (Sketch No. 68.) The history of each magnet is traced, and the magnetic moments at different periods, after reduction to a standard temperature, are compared. The gradual loss of magnetism is found to he well represented by a hyperbola; but from its capricious character, as shown by the different cases, the determinations of the magnetic moment made during the observations are to be preferred, in obtaining the several results, to the moment deduced from the general discussion. This paper may be considered as supplementary to thoM on the change of the magnetic elements of the earth, published in my annual reports of 1855 and 185{).
TIDES, TIDAL CURRENTS, AND WINDS.

Tidal, obBervatUm.6 and reductions.-An interesting report, from Assistant L. F. Pourtales, in charge of the tidal division, showing the progress ma.de in the observations and in the reductions during the past year, is given in Appendix No. 34. The permanent tide-gauges are at Charlestown, Massachu8etts; Brooklyn, New York ; Old Poi~t Comfort, Virginia ; and St. Mary's, Georgia, on the Atlantic ; and at San Diego and San Francisco, Califorhia ; and Astoria, Oregon, on the Western Coast. The object and progress of the observations at Tappahannock, of those at the Florida reefs and others, are distinctly stated. The earthquake record at Tahiti upon the self-registering gauge, loaned to the exploring expedition of Commander John Rodgers, U. 8. N., connects itself with similar disturbll.nces upon ·thti gauges at Astoria, San Francisco, and San Diego, which had been previously received, but of which we could make no use from the relative positions of the stations, and our ignorance of the place of origin of the disturbance. As far as 1 have yet been able to study the subject, the Tahiti ob:6erva.tions will enable us to clear up the whole matter. The difficulty of the subject of tidal predi-Otions requires to be studied before it can be fully appreciated. Twice I have supposed we were on the point of success in preparing prediction tables, and twice have found that our progress was not yet np to that point. Rough tables we could issue, but not.such as the materials in our hands would justify. The subject is one of
86a coa.tt.-These ha.ve been revised to date, and are given in Appen,dix .No. 20. The addition&! matter, :prepared by authority of the Treasury Depa~nt,for Mi:. G. W. }Jlunt, and drawn from the study ofthe co-tidal lines of the coast, will be found ofintt).reat to na.viga.tors. The generalisation in regard to the tidal currents near the l'lhore, \lef;w"° the port of New York aud,any southern Atlantic port, is a. very simple one.

currents of ebb and flood, will be the same as if the navigator remained stationary." The sailing lines from New York to southern and eastern ports are given on Sketch No. 65, a11d tables show the succession of tides on these lines off various ports. The distance of the cold wall of the Gulf Stream, off ports south of New York, from the Gulf Stream chart of the Coast Survey, is also shown by a table. The continuous tidal observations on the Pacific coast have led to a closer knowledge of the changes in the diurnal inequality of the tides, and the tables have been corrected accordingly. As a first approximation, the changes before and after the period of the moon's greatest declination were arranged ; but the differences in the two periods being now well made out, the tables have been extended so as to show these for a given number of days both before and after this period. Heights qf tides of the .Atlantic coast.-The generalizations which I have made in regard to the tides of the _,\_tlantic coast were, by permission of tho Treasury J?.epartment, presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in a paper which is transferred to the Appendix, No. 33. Diagrams on Sketch No. 65 are referred to in the paper, and the model ' described in it is deposited in the Coast Survey office, at Washington. As a technical memory these generalizations will be of interest to navigators. They refer to three great physical divisions of the coast of the United States-the great southern bay, from Cape Florida to Cape Hatteras; the middle bay, from Cape Hatteras to the ea.stem part of Nantucket, (Siasconsett ;) and the eastern bay, from Siasconsett to Cape Sable, (Nova Scotia.) The tide wave entering each of these bays increases in height as it runs towards the head of the bay. Thus, from Cape Florida and Hatteras (great southern bay) to Savannah and Port Royal, the tide increases in height from one and a half and two feet to seven feet. From Cape Hatteras and Siasconsett (or, more accurately, Weweeder) to the coast of New Jersey and New York, (middle bay,) the tide rises and falls one foot two inches, and two feet to nearly five feet (four feet eight inches) at Cape May, New Jersey, and Sandy Hook, though with less regularity than in the great southern bay. From Siasconsett and Cape Sable it rises from two feet two inches and four feet four inches to fifty feet at Shadwood point, on the Bay of Fundy. The same rule applies to the bays in which the tide wave enters directly, as Massachll,Setts bay, Long Island sound, New York bay, and Delaware bay ; but does not apply to Chesapeake bay, where, on account .of the. smallness of the opening and the immediate expansion and change of direction at right Mgles to itself by the tide wave, .the height rapidly diminishes after entering. This g.eneralization conforms to an established principle, though it could not, of course, be made O'lllt without tidal observations of similar number and frequency to these embraced in the Coast Survey investigations. , Whether the eastern bay is only a pa.rt of a larger bay between Nantucket and the Newfoundland banks, or whether the Cape .Sable tide of four feet four inches has a different origin, can only be established by observation. The question goes to show the difficulty of limiting physical observations by strict geographical and national boundaries. Tides and tidql ourTcnts if HdJ, Gata.-These observations were made upon the plan of those at Sandy Hook, and in New York: bay and harbor, and the Kills.. They consi-sted of obeervations, at short intervals, of the height of the tide and direction and force of the current at pa.niculatstati-0ns, and of special observations of eddies, of the limits of moving water, a.nd the like.

signal ability on his part. 'l'hey confirm the previously acknowledged excellence of the observations of Commander Charles H. Davis, United States navy, and the careful nature of those of Lieutenants Porter and Goldsborough. The resulting charts of time, direction, and velocity of tidal currents, are complete, and the curves of tides, but as the whole subject presents materials for close study, and these results will come in as an essential part of the work when it takes its final shape, I have thought it best to postpone their publication to that time, and at present to give merely Mr. Mitchell's statement of the observations made, and of tables, diagrams, and results presented.-(Appendi:x:, No. 35.) If the tables and charts were now appended to this report they would be separted from the final deductions, or must be presented a second time. The generalizations will, I am confident, be found useful to navigators, as well as in the great question of rendering this access to New York harbor a safe one. Winds of the Western Coast ef the UniWd States.-The deductions from observations of tl1e force and direction of the wind in connection with the permanent tidal observations at Astoria, San Francisco, and San Diego, are embodied in a paper read by me before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, by authority of the Treasury Department, and placed in the .Appendix (No. 36.) The diagrams (Sketch No. 66) which accompany the paper convey at once to the eye the general facts deducible from the observations, and better than they can be conveyed in words, the mind seizing readily for itself the principal inferences. One series of diagrams, which represents the daily changes from hourly observations, I have been obliged to omit as too expensive for publication. The results are f;ta.ted in the form of inferences in regard to day and night winds, and the winds at different seasons. The very simple regimen of the winds on the Pacific coast is expressed in the two following rules : (1.) W eaterly winds greatly prevail, showing a regular flo'f.' of the air at the surface of the earth from the sea to the land. (2.) There is a general absence of easterly winds, showing the absence of a return current at the surface. The philosophy of these two deductions is obvious, hinging upon the difference of temperature of the ocean and land. When the easterly winds blow at all, it is, as a rule,· during the winter, and the northeast, and more frequently in the morning than in the afternoon hours of the day. It would be unnecessary repetition to state the less general conclusions of the paper referred to as it st{tnds in the appendix. I may venture to express· the hope that these deductions will not be found useless to those men of science who are engaged in studying so carefully and zealously the climate and meteorology of our country. This discussion will be extended to the results of other years, by which valuable comparisons must be obtained, and the generalizations of the year 1855 be tried by the observations of other years.
RECORDS AND RESULTS.

In my report of last year I noticed the progress made in the preparation of the material for v-0lumes for which a special appropriation has been made by Congress. The order of publication of such a work during the actual progress of operations is, of a necessity, chronological, while ultil'.l'.U}t.ely a.n e.rrangement of volumes according to subjects or different classes of wotk appears the most desirable. To delay the publication until the final completion of the operations of the survey would greatly increase the difficulties arising from imperfect statements, when, in most cases, the appeal to personal recollection would have be-0ome unsafe or impossible.

30

REPOBT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The design has therefore been so to arrange the work, according to a general scheme embracing all the various operations of the survey, that the matter contained in the annual volumes ~ay ultimately be re-arranged according to subjects, uniting operations of certain classes into separate volumes. The work of the year 1849 has been selected to form the context of the first volume of GEODESY, as embracing operations of every class, and therefore calculated to give a full view of the operations of the Coast Survey. It will give detailed accounts of the measurement of. a principal base line and of some preliminary bases; of observations of angles for primary, secondary, and tertiary triangulation ; of observations of latitude with the zenith sector and with the zenith telescope; of observations of azimuth and of time. The description of instruments and of methods of' observation and reduction will form a necessary and valuable portion of the first volume. Having arranged the general features of the work after mu~h consultation, I have entrusted the execution of the details to Assistant J. E. Hilgard, who has had charge of the work of publication, and the greatest portion of whose time and attention during the past year have been devoted to this subject. The preparation of a volume giving an account of the CHRO:SOMETRIC EXPEDITIONS FOR ASCERTAINING THE LONGITUDE BETWEEN CAMBRIDGE A.ND LIVERPOOL, mentioned in my report for 1856 as being in the hands of Prof. G. P. Bond, has been completed. The following is a brief sketch of its contents : 1. Introduction.-Reforence to results of expeditions of 1849 and 1851 ; recognition of the change of temperature as the principal disturbing influence. Plan for a new expedition in 1855, in which the elimination of the effects of temperature changes is to be an object of special attention. General arrangements, arrangements for preserving uniform temperatures : for comparison of chronometers with stand and clocks. 2. Description qf instruments.-Transits, clocks, regiaters, chronometers, thermometers, chronometric thermometer. Apparatus for ascertaining temperature coefficients. 3. Gerrerril account of the BeVeraJ, voyag~. 4. Determination ef time at Oambridge.-Methods of observation and reduction. Determination of instrumental constants and corrections, personal equations.

11. Final, results/01' longitude.-Table of results for longitude by each chronometer for the several voyages. Final result. Satisfactory progress has been made in the preparation of a volume to contain the results for telegraphic longitudes, obtained since 1852. This work is in charge of Dr. B . .A.. Gould, jr.; and reference is made to it in his report of the season, .Appendix No. 27. A volume containining the EXPLORAT~ONS OF THE GULF STREAM, prepared by the Superintendent, with the assistance of Prof. .A. G. Pendleton, United States navy, is nearly completed; a part of it is in the printer's hands, and the diagrams are engraved. The general arrangement of this volume is as follows: 1. Introduction, giving the general scope of the work and a historical narrative of previous research. 2. Narrative of cruises, giving the principal objects, occurrences, &c. 3. Discussi<m of instruments, and instrumental corrections. 4. Talks and curvea, giving the record of observed depths, temperatures, nature of bottom, &c., and a graphical representation of the observations. 5. Re81.dt.B, giving a full dicussion of the observations, and the conclusions deduced from them. The volume of SAILING DIRECTIONS for the coast of the United States, the collection of material for which was referred to in my last report, has made progress, and is now undergoing the The form of publiscruti~ of experienced hydrographic officers previous to its publication. cation'fi.as been carefully studied and matured. The plan of this volume is to embody the hydrographic information brought out in the progress of the Coast Survey, in reference to the harbors, dangers, places of refuge, and sailing lines along our coast, and it will, of course, receive additions and mSdifications as the work will extend to localities, of which hitherto no surveys, or hydrographic reconnaissances only, have been made. It gives for each harbor a general hydrographic description, sailing directions for entering or leaving, the positions and marks of dangers ; light-houses and beacons, currents and titles, geographical positions and variations of the compass, forming a companion and commentary to the charts published by the Coast Survey. The preparation of copy of the work of 1849 having in 1856 reached a condition which made it probable that the stereotyping of a volume could proceed without inte,.ruption, and the forms of the principal classes of work having been previously studied and determined upon, the work of stereotyping was commenced about the close of the year· .A. contract had been made in the preceding October, under the law of 1852 and authority of the Treasury Department, with Mr. E. 0. Jenkins, of New York, at whose establishment the work has been done. The work has averaged three pages per day, great care being required in perfecting the manuscript copy for the printer, which is prepared, ·page for page, with all typographical details duly arranged. To insnre correctness, the proofs a.re read with the original records and revised reductions, as wen M With· the e&py used by the compositor. Second proofs. are duly examined, before the pages are ca.st, and proof impressions from the stereotype plates are finally re-examined, with the original records, by a person who has not before read them, and who checks the arithmetical operations appearing on the face of the page.

SPECIAL SURVEYS.

I have given, in the Appendix, extracts from reports on surveys in variomi special localities, as in No. 40, from the report of .Assistant .A. M. Harrison, on the survey of Cumberland and Amelia islands, the former for the site of a base line; from that of Lieut. A. W. Evans, U. '8. A., on the survey of the sites for a base line on Sapelo Island, Georgi.a, .Appern!ix No. 39 ; that of Captain J. H. Simpson, U. S. Topographical Engineers, Oil the air-line across the head of Florida peninsula, Appendix No. 41; that to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, on the survey and marking of the Florida keys, with extracts from the reports of the surveying officers, Sub-assistants C. T. Iardella and S. A. Wainwright, and "Mr. F. W. Dorr, .Appendix No. 42 ; that of .Assistant W. E. Greenwell, on the survey of the islands off the Western Coast, the Land Office, .Appendix No. «; and the report of Sub-assistant W. M. Johnson, on the for Ji< topography of the shore of Santa Barbara channel, .Appendix No. 43. In regard to the surveys for the Land Office, I would observe that one year more of the appropriation would finish the work of the Florida keys, and main immediately connected with them, and that the fruits of the preliminary work on the Western islands, which has been very difficult, are now beginning to be gathered, and in two years more would be fully so. I should regret extremely the necessity for suspending either of these works. It is not possible that in any other way can the keys and main of Florida, or the islands off the Western Coast an! main be. connected, or that it would repay the Land Office to organize and fit out parties for this special geodetic work, which, it will be recollected, was recommended by the Executive and Congress, for the' land surveys Oil the Western Coast in 1852. The triangulation across the Florida peninsula will save much time, labor, and expense in connecting the main triangulation of the .Atlantic coast, and that of the Gu!f. An appropriation of the amount of that of last year will probably enable us to complete this work. A reconnaissance of Bull's bay, thirty miles northeast of Charleston, and a survey of North Edisto entrance, about twenty-five miles southeast of that city, pointed to these harbors as harbors of refuge for vessels unable to p~s Charleston bar in northeast or southwest gales. Charts were published for this purpose, showing easy entrances in both cases, and giving the necessary sailing directions. Last year a new chart of the North Edisto was given, showing slight changes in the position of the bar, but the same depth of water. Assistant C. 0. Boutelle, who ha.a entered both of these harbors during the past year, calls attention to the neglect of them, and gives an instance in which, by running into North Edisto, a vessel might probably have been saved from wreck. I would, therefore, again draw the attention of pilots and navigators to these important harbors of refuge. Bull's bay entrance gives thirteen feet at mean low water, and North Edisto twelve feet . . The instructions of this year include nearly all the inlets on the coast of Section V, not here· tofore covered by the operations of the survey. The combined triangulation and topography of the northern end of the section will be brought nearly or quite to the North Oarolina line, completing the preliminary work of the coast of that State.

RESURVEY OF NEW YORK BAY AND HARBOR.

This important work was begun under the direction of the President of the United States, ancl. upon application of the Commissioners on Harbor Encroachments of New York, in 1855, and continued by that of the Secretary of the Treasury in the following years. The arrangement, made under authority of the Executive of the United States, was of mutual advantage to the government and to the State of New York. It was of great interest to commerce and navigation that the changes in New York bay and harbor should be known. The former survey was made twenty years ago, and considerable changes ·were known, from partial resurveys in different localities, to have occurred. It was important to the plans for the defence of the harbor that these changes should be ascertained. It was also desirable that the most improved methods of survey should be applied to this harbor, the great source of revenue to the United States. The harbor coil'Ullissioners of New York estimate that this survey would have co~t them four to five years in time, and five hundred and thirty thousand dollars iu money, (see their report to the legislature of New York, March 31, 1857, senate document NewYork State, No. 149,) and report that the expenditure upon it, and upon the maps connected with it, as fifty-:five thousand dollars and two years of time. Deducting the cost of special maps, which would not have been required by the United States, the amount by ·which the cost of this necessary work is diminished to the government is not less than thirty-five thousand dollars. The obvious value of the results obtained and reported were such as to induce the legislature of the State of New York to request the Superintendent of the Coast Survey to complete the physical survey of the harbor, so that the results might not only be adapted to purposes of navigation but to the study of the changes in progress. The disastrous result of the continued growth of Sandy Hook into the main ship channel, its progress having been for the last century at the rate of nearly ''a sixteenth of a mile in twelve years," and "large areas, over which twenty years ago there were twenty and forty feet water," being "now dry ground," needs no exaggeration to give it importance. A comparative map, founde<:J. upon the surveys of 1835 and 1855, developed and illustrated the changes in bay and harbor, on the bars, and in the channels. The report of the advi::iory council to the commissioners, consisting at the time of General Totten, chief engineer of the United States, and myself, upon this chart, is given in Appendix Ko. 37; and I note here a few of the results derived from it to show their importance, and to invite an examiaation of the document itself for many others, and for the details of these. The progress of Sandy Hook is discussed and explained, and the mode of controlling it is shown. False Hook channel (Sandy Hook) is found to have deepened a foot and a half; the bar at its southern entrance, seaward, has deepened one foot, (from twenty-one to twenty-two feet at mean low water,) and the bulk-head which closed its northern entrance has disappeared. Eighteen feet oon now be safely mrried th.rough this ch.an11el at mean low water. In twenty years a million and a half cubic yards of. sand have been remov~d from this channel. The average depth ef the main ship channel, hw changed but little. Great changes have taken place on the western shores of Coney island and of Long Island, and in the position and forms of the inlets on the lil"Outh side of Long Island. "In genercil, there has been a movement to the nw-tliward and eastward c( all, the ch.annels and, slwals of New York bar." Flynn's Knoll is an exception. '' While this movement has gone 0 n, the channds liave generaOy i"ru:roo.'>l'd in dept!t, and tl!e skoals have diminuilwd in ext,ent." From the channels the enormous amo-qnt of three millions of cubic. 5$

yards is estimated to have been actually removed, or shifted in position. The outer bar has become more uniform in depth, Gedney's channel being slightly improved, and the North and South channels having coalesced and forming a better entrance than when they were separate. The Swash channel has widened and deepened; the bar at its southern entrance, whichr.had only twenty feet upon it, has now twenty-three feet. The East channel has improved, and the bar at its eastern entrance has diminished in width . .A.t the entran'ce to the Narrows, Lieut. Comg. Craven discovered a shoal which was not on the former chart. The examinations in New York upper bay, in Newark bay, the Hudson river, East river to Throg' s .N eek, have each developed matters of considerable interest.

EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRIES.

Experiments have been made during the past year by Mr. Ma~hiot, in continuation of those on actinic engraving, and on reductions by photography; by Mr. J. M. Batchelder, on the expansion and contraction of highly callendered paper; on the use of backed paper for printing }Ilaps and charts; on the compression of sea water and some other liquids by pressure, and the effect of temperature in compression, as applied to Saxton's sounding instrument; on the use of vulcanized India rubber in a compression sounding apparatus ; on Leonard's dynamometric log for the way of vessels and rate of currents ; and on iridium surface copper plates. The callendered paper was found to act very irregularly. The backing spoiled the impressions of the fine charts, especially the work representing marshes and sanding. The great effects of temperature on the Saxton instrument, and the binding by changes of temperature, showed that it required important modifications to make it a proper sounding instrument. Leonard's log has received important modifications in its details, and will be further tested. The iridium surface plate is promising, not so much as affording a complete protection to the copper as for facility. It is still under trial.
INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS .

.Appendix No. 45 contains a description, by Assistant J. E. Hilgard, of an apparatus for measuring preliminary base lines. It is essentially the same as described in my last report, with some improvements in the mechanical details suggested by the experience of last year, and ensuring greater convenience and dispatch in its use. A combination with the deep-sea sounding apparatus devised by Commander B. F. Sands, U. S. N., with Burt's sounding nipper and Massey's indicator, as used by him in last season's work, is shown on Sketch No. 70. The floating bag, with nipper attached, secures a. vertical cast, while the indicator registers the depth, and the specimen tube brings up a portion of the bottom, the line being relieved from the weight of the deep-sea lead by its detachment in the manner shown in the drawing. The alleged objection to Brooke! s sounding apparatus, from the turning of the spindle, is obviated in a modification used by Lieut. Comg. O. H. Berryman, U. S. N. The change suggested is represented in Sketch No. 71. These improvements have been applied in the soundings taken by the officers who report them. The sounding apparatus proposed by Lieut. E. B. Hunt, corps of engineers, assistant in the Coast Survey, (.Appendix No. 47,) acts by balancing the water column of the depth to be ascertained, by a column of mercury or other pressure gauge, the pressure acting through air.

An instrument for testing the proposed method by experiment has been constructed under the direction of Mr. J. M. Batchelder, and experimental trials made by Lieut. Comg. W. G. Temple, U. S. N., in New York harbor, seem to promise success in its practical application, (Appendix No. 4:8.) A form of tide-gauge suggested by Lieut. Comg. S. D. Trenchard, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, consisting of a float and counterpoise connected by a graduated belt, is described in Appendix No. 49. The instrument is represented in Sketch No. 72. Sub-Assistant Henry Mitchell has invented a spar tide-gauge for observations on the open seacoast, which promises to be useful, and will be further tested under his direction. The description of it is given in Appendix No. 50, and a. drawing in Sketch No. 72.
INDEX OF SCIENTIFIC REFERENCES.

In 1855, Lie\t. E. B. Hunt, U. S. Engineers, proposed to the American Association for the Advancement of Science to have prepared, under itB auspices, an index of scientific references, following out the admirable index of Dr. Thomas Young, and bringing it down to the present date. This subject was one of those which early attracted the_ attention of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Professor Henry, and in regard to which he communicated with the British Association for the Promotion of Science. On his proposition they addressed the Royal Society, inviting co-operation in this undertaking, judged worthy of the best abilities in its execution. Subsequently, Lieut. Hunt proposed to the American Association a system for the abbreviation of titles in connection with this index, showing the variety which existed in abbreviations by different authors, and the desirableness of uniformity. The want of such an index of matters connected with the Coast Survey operations and studies has been se,·erely felt by all those who have been desirous of knowing what progress has been made in a subject of investigation, or whether certain methods, instruments, and appliances are new, or have been proposed or used. Lieut. Hunt suggested that an index of such matters was within the compass of his own labors, and began at once its preparation. In prosecuting this work, some seven thousand volumes have been examined, and thirty-five thousand titles extracted. In his report of progress for the past year, (Appendix No. 51,) Lieut. Hunt states that it is probable one thousand more volumes must be examined before proceeding to the classification of the titles for publication. In this work he has persevered zealously, though his Coast Survey duties have been merely incidental, as his chief time has been necessarily given to d~ties under the Engineer Department and Light-house Board, in the construction of fortifications and lighthouses. I have twice, recently, had occasion to use this index in its incomplete form, by calling upon Lieut. Hunt for references to subjects which it was important to look into without delay. In both cases the references were very copious. This work, I regret to say, will be interrupted during the winter by Lieut. Hunt's orders to Fort Taylor a~ Key West, but the chief engineer has consented that he resume it next summer. It is a work requiring a peculiar combination of qualities to execute well.

REPQRT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Lieutenant Thomas Wilson have been detailed within the yea-r. Captain Smith is in charge of the Coast Survey office. The number of officers attached to the work on the 1st of November is the same as last year, namely, eleven.
OFFICERS OF THE NAVY.

The number of officers of the navy attached to the Coast Survey on the 1st of November, 1857, was thirty-one, being twenty-two less than at the same date of the year before, (1856,) and twenty·eight less than on the 1st of September, 1855. The number of assistant engineers was but five ; and notice was given in July of the intention to withdraw the whole of the naval engineers from the work, in co·nsequence of the exigencies of the maval service. In no year have so many experienced officers been withdrawn from this service. Commander H. S. Stellwagen, and Lieutenants John J . .Almy, T. A. M. Craven, Richarj Wainwright, ~- D. Trenchard, and John C. Febiger have been relieved. These officers have all served acceptably ; and the loss of their experience will be severely felt in the next season's operations. In connection with the hydrography last executed by them, I have expressed my opinion of their services--a small return for their arduous labors. The withdrawal of the naval engineers has brought the expense of running our vessels upon the appropriations for the year which was not calculated for. For the next year there is an item in the estimates to cover this. It is proposed to attach steam engineers, selected by the hydrograpbic chiefs, to the vessels while in commission, keeping one for repairs and care of the machinery while the vessel is laid up.
LIGHT-HOUSE MA.'CTERS.

Examinations ef sites.-The system of lighting the coast has now reached an order and method which make hap-hazard appropriations for lights so rare that the number of calls upon the Coast Survey for examinations of lights in localities of doubtful utility has very much diminished. The few examinations made during the past year, only two in number, are referred to under the head of Sections I and X, and the detailed reports are presented in the Appendix Nos. 56 and 57. The result of a third examination ~rdered in Section XI) has not yet been reported. The number of cases proposed for examination in 1851 was forty-three . .Aids to navigation.-As the hydrography advances, various aids to navigation are recommended by the surveying officers. There have been seven cases of such recommendations during the past year, viz : of a buoy for the flat ground near the Salvages, Cape Ann, Massachusetts ; a buoy for the northern edge of the middle ground near Cape Henry, Virginia.; buoys for the main ship channel, and for the slue at Beaufort, North Carolina; for St. Simon's bar, Georgia ; at St. Mary's and Amelia rivers; Florida ; and a. beacon at Love key, Florida.. reef. These several recommendations have heflln referred to the Light-house Board through the Treasury Department. The reports containing them are given in the Appendix Nos. 60 to 65.
OBITUARIES.

Two of the youngest members of our surveying corps have died within the year, and both from the exposure incident to their duties. Both well deserved, and have received, special notices in connection with the work in Section I an,d Section VI, in which th.ey_were enga.gf:lld.

THE UNITED STATES CO.A.BT SURVEY.

One of the oldest and most faithful tidal observers, too, has died within the year, and his services are referred to under the head of tidal ob.servations in Section I.
MISCELLANEOUS.

The Coast Survey officers frequently have it in their power to render acceptable assistance I have, in previous reports, given many instances of this in which their services were duly acknowledged. During the past ye!K Commander W. T. Muse, in the surveying steamer Hetzel, relieved the ship Manlius, of Boston, when in a sinking condition off Cape Henry ; two of his lieutenants and a crew being sent on board of her. In testimony of their appreciation of this service, the owners of the vessel presented, through the Treasury Department, to Lieutenants R. D. Minor and Bayard E. Hand, U. S. N., each a gold chronometer watch, and forwarded at the same time a contribution in money, which was divided amongst the crew engaged in the relief of their ship. The reports of Commander Muse and Lieutenant Minor and the letter of the owners of the Manlius are given in Appendix No. 53. For a similar service, stated in Appendix No. 69 of my report of last year as having been rendered to the British barque Adieu, the British government forwarded, for presentation to Lieutenant Commanding S. D. 'l'renchard, a valuable sword. A special act, passed at the last session of Congress, authorized the reception of these by the officers for whom they were intended. By request of the United States consul, at Nassau, New Providence, Lieutenant Commanding J. K. Duet, U. S. N., assistant Coast Survey, in the surveying schooner Varina, took on board the crew and steerage passengers of the ship Julia Howard, wrecked on the Bahama.", landing the former at Havana, and the latter at Pensacola. The report of Lieutenant Commanding Duer, and the letters of the United States consuls at Nassau and Havana· are given in Appendix No. 54 . .Assistance in saving government property at Pensacola from destruction by fire, incidentally rendered by the hydrographic parties of Commander B. F. Sands and Lieutenant Commanding J. K. Duer, will be referred to under the head of hydrography, in Sections VII and VIII.

to vessels in distress.

I now proceed to give a detailed statement of the work executed in the field ar:anged under 'the heads of the several sections on the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Western Coast. In each, the operations in triangulation, topography, and hydrography will be noticed in geographical order, preceded by a summary of the office work executed at .the office iu Washington.·

SECTION I.
FROM PASSAMAQUODDY BAY TO POINT JUDITH, INCLUDING THE CO.A.ST OF THE ST.A.TES OF MAINE, NEW _HAMPSHIRE, MASS.A.CIIUSE'ITS, AND RHODE ISLAND.-(Su:roR A, Nos. 1 il'D 2.)

The progress in this section has been very good. The large development of shore-line, which is much beyond any possible calculation from ordinary maps, prior to the time of the Coast Survey, and the great extent of comparatively shoal sea off t6is coast, when taken in connection with the short season for work in the eastern part of the section, makes it a subject of great solicitude with me. I am confident that a continuance of the present resources, and a pro~r application of them according to the systematic steps already laid down, will bring the work here to a close nearly as soon as in the o.ther sections. I estimate for the operations an average period of, say ten years ; the triangulation closing first and the hydrograpby last. This coast changes so little, that whatever is done on the seacoast will remain of authority for a long period of years, and only some of the harbors will require resurvey and careful watching in thei!" changes. The operations in this section during the past season have been as follows : I. Astronomical and magnetic observations at Bangor and Calais, including telegraphic. longitudes and latitudes. 2, The measurement of a base of verification on Epping plains, Maine, with the new Coast Survey apparatus. 3. Triangulation eastward from the Kennebec river. 4. Topography of the shores of the Kennebec to Bath, Maine. 5. Topography of Cape Small point, Maine, and its extension westward to Harpswell. 6. Topography of the islands and main of Casco bay, eastward from the Presumpscot. 7. Topography of Plymouth harbor and its approaches. 8. Hydrography of the Kennebec river, Maine, from the entrance to Bath. 9. Hydrography of Casco bay, Maine. 10. In-shore hydrography north and south of Newburyport, Massachusetts. 11. Off-shore soundings eastward from the coast of Massachusetts to beyond George's bank. 12. Deep-,sea soundings off the coast, and special surveys. 13. Tides and currents of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket sounds. 14. Observations at a permanent tidal station. 15. Light-house examinations. There can be no doubt, on even looking at this list, that the number of parties e~ployed, and the character of their employment, has been in proportion to the importance of this section of the survey, and to the large commercial and navigating interests of which it is the home. Office work.-The following drawings have been completed within the surveying year: Kennebec river entrance, scale TOho-; Annis Squam and Ipswich harbors, roiH; seacoast of Massachusetts, from Scituate to Saughkonnet river, Rhode Island, roc1oo-~ ; Provincetown harbor, -;;-n-ho ; eastern series, Nos. 2 and 3, ffi-oo; Monomoy shoals, (additions,) moo; and bar bor of Wood's Hole, ·20 ho· The following are now in progress : Seacoast from Cape N eddick to Hcituate harbor, 2 c lm; coast chart from Portsmouth to Cape An,n, "J"ohT; from Cape Ann to Scituate, ntn; from

In the engraving division, plates have been completed of seacoast of Massachusetts, No. 1, as preliminary; Plymouth harbor; Boston harbor, (new· edition,) and llonomoy shoals ; ahd the· following piates arc in progress : seacoast of Massachusetts, as a finished chart, Ipswich and Annis Squam harbors, Muskeget channel, and eastern series, Nos. 1 and 2. Astronomical and ·magnetic observations.-The erection of buildings near the Coast Survey station, on Thomas' Hill, in Bangor, during the past year, made it necessary to occupy that station this season in order to rende'r available the longitude results there obtained in 1851-' 2, by the late Professor Sears C. Walker, assistant in the Coast Survey. Upon the completion of the measurement of the Epping base, my party was reorganized, and transferred to Bangor for astronomical work, in connection with which it was desirable, at the same time, to fix the geographical position of some point, near the eastern boundary of th3 United States, which might hereafter be connected with the triangulation of the coast. The charge of this party was assigned to Assistant George W. Dean, who, with Sub-Assistant Stephen Harris, and Mr. Julius Kincheloe, as aid, proceeded to Calais and made the necessary arrangements for executing the work. The erection of an observing station, in connection with other arrangements at Bangor, was satisfactorily executed, under the direction of Sub-Assistant Edward Goodfellow, during my absence at Washington. Upon my return to Bangor, early in September, observations were at once commenced for determining the personal equation between Mr. Dean, Mr. Goodfellow, and myself; after which Mr. Dean returned to Calais, and the exchange of star signals for determining the difference of longitude, by the electro-magnetic method, was satisfactorily commenced on the evening of the 18th. Some very interesting results in regard to personal equation were had, which, however, require careful discussion and study before presenting them. The weather proving favorable for the work, star signals were exchanged on four nights, between the 18th and 26th, when Mr. Dean returned to Bangor, and a second series of observations were made for ascertaining the personal equation between the observers ; upon the completion of which Mr .. Goodfellow proceeded to Calais and continued the observations at that station until the 26th of October, when the operations for the season were closed. At the special request of Professor Jack, of Frederickton, New Brunswick, ·who visited Calais for the purpose of witnessing our methods of operating, star signals were exchanged on one night between Frederickton and Calais ; Professor Jack conducting the operations at the former station, and Mr. Goodfellow at the latter. The telegraph lines between Bangor and the eastern stations were in excellent condition, and the experiments for differences of longitude proved highly satisfactory. Through the courtesy of James Eddy, esq., general superintendent for the .American Telegraph Company, the lines were placed at the disposal of the Coast Survey, after the regular business hours, 9 P· m., ·and all messages relating to the experiments were, at all times, sent free. The local superintendents, Messrs. Bedlow .and Stevens, also the operators at the several stations upon the lines, extended every facility for the successful prosecution of the work. Mr. Dean officially acknowledges, in appropriate terms, the facilities extended to the Coast Survef by the trustees of the Calais Academy, who cheerfully accorded to him the privilege of establishing a Coast S~ey station in the academy grounds.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT' OF

During the progress of the astronomical obsen-ations at Bangor, the angles necessary for connecting the geodetic station with Mount Harris and Mount Wal do were measnred by Assis· tant C. 0. Boutelle. The following statistics exhibit in brief the work executed bS the parties at Bangor and Calais, betwen September 1 and October 26. At Bangor two hundred and ninety-three observations were made for determining the local time and instru¥1ental corrections ; forty-one ciTcumpolar stars were observed for ascertainin~ the equatorial intervals of the threads ; and two hunclred and twenty-five stars were observed by the electro-magnetic method, on seven night.a, .in connection with the station at Calais, for determining the difference of longitude between these stations. The instrument used in making theiM3 observations was a forty-six inch transit, made by Tronghton & Simms, (C. S. No. 6,) which has for several years been used for similar observations. Latitude observations.-The observations for latitude were made by Snb-Assistant Goodfellow and Mr. Dean, and consisted of two hundred and nfteen observations upon forty-one pairs of stars, with the zenith telescope, C. S. No. 5. The value of one revolution of the micrometer of the instrument was determined by one hundred and sixty observations upon the circumpolar star, 51 Oepht:A, near its eastern elongation. Thirty observations were made with the micrometer upon a distant mark for ascertaining the value of the divisions of the level scale upon the telescope. The stars observed for latitude were, as far as practicable, selected from the Greenwich Twelve-Year Catalogue. Magnetic observations.-The magnetic observations were made near the geodetic station by Sub-Assistant Stephen Harris, aided by Mr. Henry W. Bache, and consisted of one hundred and ninety-five, for declination, during four days ; two sets for horizontal intensity and moment of inertia, and five sets for dip. The latter observations were made at different localities in the vicinity of the geodetic station, but no differences werB obtained which indicated local attraction. The instruments used were declinometer D. 22 (C. S. No. 1) and dip-circle C. S. No. 4. MereordogiCal, observations.-The usual meteorological journal was in charge of Mr. Henry W. Bache, one of the aids in my party. One hundred and seventy observations for temperature, and an equal number for determining the evaporating point were recorded. One hun· dred and seventy readings of the barometer (Greenwich, No. 91-0, and Dent's aneroid, No. 8,580) were also noted, with general remarks upon the winds, clouds, and other conditions affecting the state of the atmosphere in the immediate locality of the ~ta.tion. Mr. A. T. Mosman aided in thB longitude experiments, and read off the chronographic sheets for clock and azimuth corrections and equatorial intervals. At Calais, two hundred and eighteen observa-tions were made for determining the clock and azimuth corrections, and two hundred and eleven stars were observed for differences of longitude by the electro-magnetic method, in connection with the Bangor station, by Assistant G. W. Dean, and Sub-Assistant Edward Goodfellow. Luiitude ob&ervations.-The latitude was determined by Sub-Assistant Stephen Harri!! from one hundred and eighty-Bix observations, upon forty-four pairs of stars, with zenith tel'5scope No. 4, C. S. For ascertaining the value of the micrometer, one hundred and sixty-five observations were made upon Polaris, near its eastern elongation. The arc value of the level divisions upon the telescope was determined by seventy-five observations upon a coilimater, which was · ad.justed to a sidereal focus. Magnetic obBervations.-The magnetic obBervatfotlB were made at a point a:bottt·one htm:drnd

and fifty metres south of the astronomical station by Sub-Assistant Harris, aided by Mr. Julius Kincheloe, and consisted of one hundred and ninety-four readings for declination, on four dayR, three complete sets for horizontal intensity and moment of inertia, and four sefai for dip. Mr. Kincheloe also assisted in the longitude experiments, and read off the chronographic sheets for instrumental corrections. MeteorowgicaJ, observations.-The usual meteorological journal was kept, in which were recorded one hundred and fifty readings of a standard barometer, and corresponding readings of the thermometers for temperature and evaporating point. The observing station at Calais was erected by Thomas McDonnell, artificer in the Coast Survey. Assistant Dean and Sub-Assistant Goodft>llow are under instructions to organize parties for the telegraphic determination of longitude between Mobile and New Orleans. Sub-Assistant Harris has been assigned to the party of Assistant J. E. Hilgard in Section VIII. Mea.surement of a base of verification on Epping pains, Maine.-The preparation of the site selected on Epping plains, Washington county, Maine, as a base for verifying the primary triangulation in this section was begun by Assistant C. O. Boutelle, in the autumn of last year, at which time a topographical survey of the line was made by Lieutenant J. C. Clark, U. S. A., assistant. In the spring of the present year the work was resumed; the line carefully marked out, levelled, and grades established at the beginning of each slope throughout its length. These preparations were completed early in July, and I immediately commenced the preliminary comparisons necessary to determine the lei,gth of the bars used in the apparatus. The comparisons were made with Saxton's pyrometer, the same apparatus which haii been employed for the purpose at various bases in the survey. Its essential parts consist, as heretofore, of two stone pillars, one to support an abutting screw, and the other a mirror; a third pillar support· ing a reading telescope and a paper scale, upon which, as reflected in the mirror, the different lengths of the measuring bars and standard are recorded. Twenty-three sets of comparisons were made before commencing the measurement, at temperatures ranging from 60 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit, each set consisting of one reading of each measuring bar, and two readings of the standard. The measurement was begun at the western end of the base on the 20th of July, and con· tinued, with the interruption of nearly a week by reason of bad weather, until the 3d of August. Allowing an average of ten hours to a day, the actual number of working days employed in the measurement would be six and three quarters. The greatest number of tubes measured in a single day was two hundred and eighty-one or l · 05 miles. For three consecutive days the rate of progress was rather more than a mile per day. After the measurement twenty sets of comparisons -were ma.de between the bars and the standard, at temperatures ranging between 60 and 7 5 degrees of Fahrenheit. The length of the base uncorrected for inclination of the bars is 8718 · 64 metres or five miles and four-tenths. The point marking the western end of the line is cut into a solid ledge of rock. That marking the ·east end is secured by a heavy stone monument.

·

The chief peculiarity of this base, as distinguished from other primary bases in the work, arose irom the necessity of employing heavy grades to overcome the great irregularities of the surface. The line measured and profiles of the base are represented on Skewh No. 3. A 6$

detailed description of the site, of the means employed in the measurement, and comparisons of the progress, with the statistics of other primary bases, are contained in Appendix No. 26. As more considerable slopes were to be measured ·on this line than upon those heretofore measured in the Coast Survey, elaborate observations were made at the office, under my direction, by Assistants J. E. Hilgard, Joseph Saxton, and }fr. J. M. Batchelder, to test the . base apparatus as to flexure or mot10n upon a slope, and as to the length upon a slope, the constancy of which with varying inclinations depends upon the 'I.form of the bed upon which the stem carrying the knife edge traverses. These were very difficult and laborious, but in the end quite satisfactory. I was assisted in this measurement by Professor Rogers, of the University of Pennsylvania, w"ko volunteered for the purpose, by Assistant Dean, Sub-Assistants Goodfallow, Sullivan, and Harris, and by Mr. T. McDonnell; Profossor Fraser, of the University of Pennsylvania, was also present at the early part of the measurement, and Dr. Gould near its close. 'l'he operation attracted a very large number of visitors from the surrounding country, who cheered us by the interest they took in the work. Two monuments of granite were placed perpendicular to the base, on the north side, at the distances of thirty-six and seventy-two metres, respectively, from the eastern terminus. These are each 3.5 feet long, by a foot square, and are surrounded by wooden curbs each a foot and a half square. Copper bolts were driven into the tops of each block and wedged, and a line perpendicular to the base at its eastern terminus passes through the copper bolts at the intersection of crosses cut upon the head of each. The monument marking the eastern terminus is of white marble, 1. 64 foot square, and 3. 28 feet in height. This rests upon a block of granite (Sketch No. 3) 3.5 feet square and 2.5 feet thick, bedded on a foundation a foot in depth and five feet square. A plinth for the western monument, seen in Diagram No. 3, was cut from the rock in place at that terminus. Sections through the eastern and western ends of the base are also shown on Sketch No. 3. The levels marked on the diagrams were referred to a zero assumed as 100 feet below the bench mark near the eastern terminus. The tidal observations thus far made indicate that this zero line is 145.4 feet above the plane of mean level of the sea. '!'his gives for the eastern a height of 254. 7 feet above the sea, for the summit of the base 217. 7 feet, and for the western terminus 238.4 feet. Triangulation eastward from Kennibe,c river, Maine.-This work was resumed under the direction of Lieutenant A.. W. Evans, U. 8. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, on the 7th of August, by his party in charge of Sub-Assistant B. Huger, jr., in the schooner Hassler. Six: stations of the previous year were re-occupied, and observations completed at them. The triangulation covers the towns of Westport, Edgecombe, Booth bay and Southport, Monterey bay, Sheepscot river to Wiscasset, Townsend and Linican bays, and the Damiscove islands. Points were established throughout the limits of the work for the uses of a topographical party. The whole number of positions correctly fixed by a triangulation is forty-five. SubAssistant J. A.. Sullivan, who had beeb engaged in the grading of the base site on Epping Plains, joined the party on the' 14th of August, and assisted until the close of the season. The stations of the previous year were visited by Mr. G. E. Humphries, the aid in the party, and secured under the direction of Sub-Assistant Huger. The following are the statistics of

Twenty·one vertical angles were measured at four stations, upon eighteen objects, by two hundred and ninety observations with the theodolite. The heights of all the prominent signals were determined. Mr. Humphries, the aid of the party, was unfortunately drowned in the Kennebec river on the 20th of August, by the upsetting of a boat in which he was returning from Bath, where he had been sent on duty. The energy which he had previously shown in aiding the operations is favorably mentioned in the report of Lieutenant Evans. Work was discontinued on the 4th of October, and immediate preparations were made for the return of the party in the schooner Hassler to the coast of Georgia. Sub-Assistant Huger then proceeded to commence triangulation work on the eastern coast of the Florida peninsula., and Sub-Assistant Sullivan joined the party of Captain J. H. Simpson, U. S. Engineers, assistant in charge of the air-line triangulation between Fernandina and Cedar Keys, Florida. The records of horizontal angles and descriptions of signals used in prosecuting the triangulation of Kennebec river have been deposited by Lieutenant Evans in the Coast Survey office. Topography of shores of Kennebec river, Maine.-The shore line of this river, and principal features along the banks, have been surveyed by the party of Sub-Assistant W. S. Gilbert. The lower limit of this topographical sheet, the details of which were furnished, from time to time throughout the summer, to the hydrographic party, is Cox's Head, near the entrance, where it connects with a sheet executed last season by .Assistant I. Hull .A.dams. The planetable work was extended upwards beyond Bath, and includes both shores of the river. Assistant Adams directed the operations of this party at the outset of the season.

Mr. Adams was employed during the remainder of the season in inking hi." sheets of work executed in Section III. The party of Sub-Assistant Gilbert is now about to take the field in Section VIII.

Topography of Gape SmoJJ, Point, Maine.-The plane-table work in this immediate vicinity, remaining unfinished at the end of last season, has been completed by Sub-Assistant C. T. Iardella. His sheet embraces the lower part of the western side of Small Point peninsula, and joins on the east with a sheet of the previous year, executed by Assistant I. Hull Adams. It also iucludes, on the westward, part of Great island, Bear island, Malaga island, Horse island, and a number of detached ledges and smaller islands lying in the entrance to Casco bay. The topography of the main shore was extended from 6ape Small upwards to Phipsburg. Sub-Assistant Iardella also completed the details of a topographical sheet commenced by Assistant S. A. Gilbert in 1854, and connecting on the westward with his O\Vn of the present year. Rogue island, .Tenny island, Long Ledge, Mark island, and others lying east and north ~f Ragged island, were surveyed.

The following is an extract from the report of Mr. Iardella: "New Meadows river, which divides Great island from the mai11. land, is ten miles in length by three in width, and averaging in depth from twenty to thirty-l'lix fathoms. It is a fine harbor for coasting vessels, being well protected at its entrance by Bear island, and Horse and Ma.laga islands.'' The preparations of Mr. Iardella are now well under way for resuming the topography of the Florida keys. Topography of shore and, island,s in Casco bay, Maine.-This work. has been continued by Assistants .A.. W. Longfellow and A. S. Wadsworth, on sheets commenced by the former in previous seasons. The main.shore-line of the western side of Casco bay has been traced northward and eastward from Presumpscot river to Parker's Point, at the mouth of Yarmouth river. On the islands lying south and west of a line joining Parker's Point, and the outer extremity of Harpswell neck, the plane-table work consisted of filling in the topography of Great Jebeig island, (the largest in the bay,) and the survey of Little John's, Green, Crow, Goose nest, Stockman's, Eagles, Upper Flag, Haskell's, and Great and Little Mark islands. The last five lie off the southwest end of Harpswell neck, commonly called Potts' Point. The schooner Meredith was used for transportation, and is about to be transferred with the party, to resume work in Section V. Mr. Clarence Fendall was attached during the year as aid in the party of Assistant Longfellow. Topography of Plymouth harbor, Ma.ssachusetts.-The topography between Back river, north and east of Duxbury, and extending northwards towards Scituate, has been executed by_ the party of Assistant A. M. Harrison, completing the survey of the shores of Plymouth harbor. The plane-table work was carried back, towards the interior, about two miles. The character of the country embraced is varied, requiring care and minuteness .in the execution of the fieldwork. Sub-Assistant Charles Ferguson and Mr. W. H. Dennis were attached to the party of Assistant Harrison. The work was commenced on the 10th of August, and closed on the 24th of September.

northern extremity of the peninsula of Cape Cod was made by Assistant H. L. Whiting, extending from tho Highland light around to Race Point light, and continued from thence to include the inner shore of the harbor at·Provincetown. The work was carried down on the inside shore of the peninsula to Pond village, nearly opposite to the Highland light. About twenty miles of shore line were reviewed in this examination. This work was executed after the middle of October, and closed the operations of Mr. Whiting for the season. He reports that the general line of the shore has undergone but few alterations since the survey of 1849. Important local changes, however, have occured, which in his opinion seriously threaten the interests connected with the preservation of East harbor. His report, in detail, giving the results of the resurvey will be found in Appendix No. 10. Hydrography of Kennebec river, Maine.-The hydrographic party of Lieut. Comg. Stephen D. Trenchard, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, resumed work on the 30th of August at Cox's Head, within the entrance where the soundings of last season were terminated. Proceeding upwards in the river the hydrography was executed to the upper limits of the city of Bath, shore line being furnished by the plane-table party of Sub;Assistant Gilbert, and during part of the time employed by Assistant I. Hull .A.dams. The deficiencies in the hydrography off Seguin island, White Ledge, and Herron island, have also been filled in. The additional soundings made off Herron island develop ledges not shown upon the chart of last year. The anchorage without the river being unsafe, the schooner Gallatin was kept inside, and the work reached each day in boats. A. preliminary chart of Kennebec river (Sketch No. 4) shows the combined results of the topography and hydrography executed within the year. The great strength of the tide in the Kennebec rendered soundings impracticable, except in the slack water, and the regular progress of the work was in consequence much interrupted. In the execution of the hydrography, one hundred and forty-two miles were run in sounding, six hundred and fifty-two theodolite and sextant angles were observed, and ten thousand eight hundred and sixty-three soundings made in from one to thirty fathoms water. The tides were observed at six temporary stations between the entrance and Bath. Lieut. Comg. Trenchard's hydrographic sheet of the coast between Annis Squam and Ipswich, Massachusetts, and the sheet of Kennebec entrance executed last year, have been deposited in the archives. Hydrography of Gasco bay, Maine.-The work of sounding has been continued at the entrance of the bay, by Lieut. Comg. W. G. Temple, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in the steamer Corwin, His sheet joins on the east at Cape Small Point, with one of the Kennebec entrance, executed last year by Lieut. Comg. Trenchard.. The hydrography of Casco bay was carried westward from Cape Small Point to the meridian of Ragged island, and to an equal distance southward, including about thirty-three square miles in the ·soundings. One hundred and fifty-one miles were run in making twelve hundred and ten casts of the lead. A.11gles were observed, for hydrographic purposes, at three hundred and fifty-eight stations, and seven hundred and forty-three angles were recorded. Within the limits of his hydrographic sheet a ledge, in thirty feet water, was discovered by Lieut. Comg. Temple. It seems to have been unknown to the pilots and fishermen of the vicinity. The position of the ledge was communicated to the Department shortly after its discovery-. It lies five and a half nautical miles W.SW. l W. (W. i S. per compass) from Seguin light-hnuae. The cross-bearings for finding it are given with Appendix No. 9.

Examination of Jordan'B rock, near Portland light, and ef a Bhoal in the inner harbor.-The presence of the h:ydrographic vessels at work during the summer and autumn to the eastward, in the commodious harbor of Portland, having sugges1!ed to the Board of Trade of that city the opportunity for a re-examination of .Jordan's rock, and of a bank lying in the inner harbor off Union wharf, my attention was called to the subject, and the desired resurvey was made by the party of Lieut. Corng. S. D. Trenchard, in the schooner Gallatin, temporarily in command of Lieµt. F. A. Roe, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey. A. number of detached boulders, only two of which projected... 11s much as a foot, were found imbedded in the bank making out from the Cape Elizabeth shore. The positions of several of these, varying from one to two feet in diameter, were determined by Lieut. Roe. He considers the present buoy in that locality well placed, and advises that vessels should not go inside of it. Jordan's rock was found to be an unbroken ledge, extending about two hundred and fifty yards southward and eastward from the buoy which has been placed at its northern extremity. The surface of the rock is quite uneven, the lead frequently slipping off into water two or three feet deeper than that :first fo~nd in sounding. Lieut. Roe recommends that a large buoy be placed a little to the northward and eastward of the present one. He remarks that there is plenty of sea room between it and the opposite side of the channel. The position of .Jordan's rock was carefully determined anew by Lieut. Roe, and the soundings in both examinations above mentioned were made under very favorable circumstances. In-shore hydrography north and 1K>uth of Newburyport, Massackusetts.-In the latter part of the season Lieut. Comg. Rodgers extended the in-shore hydrography of the coast of Massachusetts from Londoner shoal, near Thatcher's island, (Cape Ann,) northward, beyond Newburyport harbor, to the Isle of Shoals, near Portsmouth. During the progress of this work, he deter· mined the position of a sunken ledge near Straitmouth island. The ledge has only twelve feet w~ter on it, surrounded by ten fathoms. Its existence is known to very few persons, and has even been doubted by mariners living in its immediate neighborhood. The flat ground to the northward and westward of the Salvages was also examined, and as little as two feet water found in places on it. The recommendation of Lieut. Comg. Rodgers for a buoy to mark this dangerous ledge has been forwarded through the department to the Light-house Board.(A.ppendix No. 60.) The following is a summary of the statistics : Mile El run in sounding · . · ..... · · . · · · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 1, 914 Number of angles recorded . ·. - ·. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 4,036 Number of soundings · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 11, 7 30 The records of the hydrographic work of last year, including journals and duplicates of soundings, angles, and tidal observations, made in Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard Sounds, have been completed and placed in the office. Off-shore soundings, eastwm·if1·om Massachusetts bay.-In continuation of the deep sea work executed last year to the eastward of Cape Cod peninsula, Lieut. Comg. C. R. P. Rodgers, U.S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, with the steamer Bibb, resumed at Cape Ann and carried a line due east to the meridian 66° 30 1 W. The line then passed southward to the latitude of George's bank, and was extended westward to Stellwagen' s bank, in a course generally parallel to that carried out. A. second line was run off·shore, from a point three miles south of the Highland light, on Cape Cod peninsula, to the same meridian, and thence carried southward and northward, alternately, so as to traverse the V<ieiai.ty south.ward ud

eastward of George's bank, with five lines of soundings parallel and at equal distances from" each other. Two other lines running eastward and westward, after considerable progress had been made, were interrupted by gales. · The lines run were about ninety miles in length, and very nearly fill the spaces left in the off-shore soundings of previous seasons. On my application through the Department, the revenue cutter Morris was placed at the disposal of Lieut. Comg. Rodgers, and was used for a new examination of George's bank.. ''The position of the shoalest water seems to be the same as it was when surveyed by Capt. Wilkes twenty years ago. The least depth found by us was thirteen feet at low water-two feet le8s than the least found in the examination made in 1837." The character of the bottom on George 1 s bank is described in a report from Lieut. Comg. Rodgers, given in Appendix No. 11. In the vicinity of Little George's bank, a small shoal with only thirty feet of water on it was discovered by this party about ninety miles from the nearest land. Its true position is given in Appendix No. 12. Lieut. Comg. Rodgers makes special mention of the efficiency with which Captain Whitcomb, of the revenue cutter Morris, co-operated in the examination of George's shoal. Deep sea soundings.-On the outward passage of Lieut. Comg. 0. H. Berryman, U.S. N., assistant Coast Survey, in the steamer Arctic, for special duty directed by the Department, a line of soundings was run in July along the inner edge of the Gulf stream. From a position southeast of the Nantucket shoals, in latitude 40° N., this line was_ carried in a direction parallel with the general trend of the coast to a position in latitude 44° N., a little to the east of Sable island. Specimens were brought up from depths varying from five hundred to fourteen hundred and forty fathoms. In February last I was directed by tho Treasury Department to have certain incidental surveys made by this party in aid of the Telegraph Company's operations, who had been so liberal to the Coast Survey. These were satisfactorily executed by Lieut. Comg. Berryman, and the charts resulting from them have been forwarded to the office and communicated to the company. This incidental work, which has added little to the cost of the party, is but a small return for the gratuitous use of the telegraph lines, which the Coast Survey has enjoyed through all the lines of the United States, and which have been presented to it by this company, so that, had the cable been successfully laid, we could at once, have availed ourselves of the transmission of signals to it, to connect America and Europe in longitude by telegraph. One set of signals transmitted to and fro would have done more than all the astronomical observations yet made, and the chronometer results observed, to give a satisfactory longitude. On his return, Lieut. Comg. Berryman was successful in obtaining soundingfl' along a line carried southward from Halifax, N. S., to the parallel of 38° N. latitude. The soundings were found to deepen very suddenly a little above the latitude 42°. At the greatest depth, which occurred in latitude 38° N., longitude 68° W., tho line parted after bottom had been roached in 2, 987 fathoms.

Tides and currents.-In continuation of a series of observations conducted under my irome· diate direction, Sub-Assistant H. Mitchell placed tide-gauges at Monomoy, Falmouth, Menem· sha, and No Man's Land, in the vicinity of Nantucket and Vineyard sounds, and has secured a. large amount of valuable data hearing upon the development of the interferences known to exist ~ tibe. ~· _qf _tJJ.i11 p~t of the coo.st. -

In connection with these, fifty current stations were occupied by three divisions of his party, working simultaneously. These stations were so arranged as to furnish the necessary data for a chart of co-current lines, embracing the two sounds ~nd their approaches. Mr. Mitchell made also a physical study of the shoals, their causes and type curves. A detailed account of the operations as conducted by Mr. :Mitchell will be found in Appendix No. 35. The permanent tidal station at the dry dock of the Charlestown navy yard, Massachusetts, was kept up until the 1st of August by Mr. Isaac Williams, whose punctuality and faithfulness have already been alluded to in former reports. Since his death, which occurred in August, the gauge has been in charge of Mr. Thomas E. Ready, whose previous connection with Mr. Williams tends to confirm the expectation that the observations will be continued with a like degree of care and attention. Light-house examination.-In accordance with directions given by the Department, a re-examination bas been made of the point of rocks at Westport, Massachus~tts, in order to determine the expediency of erecting a light-house there. This duty was executed by Lieut. Comg. C. R. P. Rogers, U. S. N., assistant Coast Survey. His report, with the conclusions reached in his examination of the vicinity, will be found in Appendix. No. 56.

SECTION II.
FROM POINT JUDITH TO CAPE HENLOPEN, INCLUDING THE COAST OF CONNECTICUT, NEW YORK, NEW' JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA, AND PA.RT OF DEL.A.WARE.-(SKErCR B, No. 11.)

The outstanding work in this section has occupied one triangulation party during the season, two topographical parties during part of the season, (one a double party,) and two hydro· graphic parties during part of the season, besides which special investigations of tide and currents have been made during parts of the season, and the regular tidal observations in New York harbor have been kept up. A portion of this work is new, and a part belongs to essential work of verification. It was all provided for in the estimaws and directions of the Treasury Department, the supplies from the New York Commissioners on Harbor Encroachments having ceased. The mutually advantageous connection of the Coast Survey and Harbor Commissioners has been referred to in the introduction to this report at some length. The Superintendent of the Coast Survey has been requested by the legislature of the State to complete the physical survey of the harbor and the Commissioners' map, but no special appropriation has yet been made for the purpose of defraying the expenses. The report in regard to changes in New York bay and harbor by the Chief Engineer of the United States and Superintendent of the Coast Survey, acting as advisory counsel to the Com· missioners, i; given in Appendix No. 37. The wharf lines for the harbor and bay of New York, recommended by the Commissioners on Harbor Encroachments on the rep-0rt of their advisory counsel, based upon the Coast Survey maps and results, were adopted by the legislature of N cw York, putting the crowning action to one of the most useful and successful operations ever executed by the survey, or for which it has furnished the materials. The preservation of this noble harbor, so important to the resources of the government and to the prosperity of our country, from further encroachment in the future, is thus assured, while the interesting and encouraging result is made known that the entrance to the bay has not deteriorated within the last twenty years in d.epth of water and regimen of channels ; and a. reasonable expectation is held out that by physical investigations of the tides a.nd currents of

Trw:ngulation qf Hlldson river.-The connected triangulation of this river has been continued upwards from the vicinity of Poughkeepsie. A!isistant Edmund Blunt was engaged in this work from the 8th of August until late in November, and closed operation"' for the season at Station Burhanes, a short distauce aboYe Turmel Point. The extent of the river course included in triangulation within the 1imit8 stated is about t<eventcen miles. A 8eric;.; of small triang-ks confined within the banks, hut connected with the chain passing up the river, will furnisl1 ample means for the execution of the topography. Mr. Blunt was assisted during the season. by Lieutenant A. H. Seward, l". S. A., assistant CoaBt Survey, and Suh-Assistant G. H. Bagwell.

Topography qf the enviro'!18 qf New York ha.rbor.-The party of Assistant H. L. Whiting" during the entire season, and two others under his general direction in the field, have been engaged in filling in the supplementary details necessary to complete the resurvey of New York harbor. Assistant Whiting resumed work on the 22d 9f April, aud completed, in detail, the survey of tho northwest part of Staten ~sland, which had been in~errupted by Revere weather at the close of last season. The party was then transferred to Hoboken, New Jersey, and executed a regular plane-table survey ofthe west side of Hudson river, from below Jersey city to a point opposite Spuyten Duyvel creek. The work in this vicinity was carried inland, so as to embrace all the topographical details of Jersey city and Hoboken and the high land back of them.

REPORT OF THE SUPERL'>TENDEN'l' OF

The party of ~Ir .·Tohn Meehan commenced on the 1st of .Tnl.'', at the limit reached by Mr. W11iting, in 185G, in Bergen neck, (about three miles from its southern point,) and extemled the topo;;raph.'- northward to a junction with the sheet first noticed as containing tl1e 8urvey of .Jersey city. The work ·was comprised within an average breadth of three-quarters of a mile, between the shore-line of New York harbor on the east and the plank road at its western limit. On completing the sheet jnst described, Mr. Meehan took up a secornl, commencing ail J.55tb street, (New York city,) and supplied the detaihi embraced in the northern part of Manhattan island, extending to Spuyten Duyvel creek : ''The island in this part is so wooded that very few opportunities occurred of determining the position of the plane-table by the three-point prol)lem. The thickly studded details, houses, roads, gardens, fields, and villages, Wf'\re mostl:-- secured by traverses of the plane-table, and carefully verified by the severest tests." A third sheet, on a scale of 57h50 , containing Governor's, Ellls', and Bedloe's islanrl.s, was also executed b.v :Mr. Meehan before the middle of October. He thus reports the statistics of the work done 1;,y his party : Shore-line surveyed···· ·. · · .. · · · - · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · - · · · · · · · · · · · · · 28 miles.

F. W. Dorr filled in. with the requisite details, a sheet extending from Throg's neck, on East river, to High Bridge, on Harlem river. Under the direction of :Mr. Whiting, the aid in his party, Mr. C. Rockwell, made a detailed survey of Ward' I' and Randall's islands, the North and South Brother, and Ricker' s island, in East river. The statistic& of t11iR \York comprise about ten miles of shore-line, within three square miles of area. In referenee to tl1e C'haractor of the plane-table BurveyR complctod under his direction, Assi,.;tant Whiting observes : "that executed by Mr. Meehan was detailed and difficult, and was accurately and closely ,qurveyed." "The work from Throg' N neck to High Bridge was executed by Mr. Dorr in a most creditable and accurate manner. The sheet containing the islands, surveyed b? Mr. Rockwell, is ali,;o a fine specimen of work." "The topographical rmrvcyti juRt completed are sufficiently in detail to answer all the purposes to which they could he applied. The representations are c~aracteristic and expreflsive." Assistant Whiting left his own party, in charge of Mr. Rockwell, in the middle of October, and engaged in a resurvey of Provincetown harbor in Section I. ·Mr. Meehan has resumed plane-table work in Section IV, and Mr. Dorr is c~mpleting arrangements for continuing the survey of the Florida keys.-(Section VI.) Two plane-table sheets of the work executed by Mr. Meehan, botween :Macomb' s dam [l.nd Spuyten Duyvel creek, and between Communipaw and Palmispaw, have been inked and returned to the office. Hydrography q/ New YC?rk harbor and approaches.-The supplementary work of the present season was executed by the party of Lieut. Comg. W. G. Temple, United States navy, assiAtant in the Coast Survey, with the steamer Corwin. Newtown creek was sounded out, and EaRt river, from the mouth of the creek to a line crossing Blackwell's island at the penitentiary.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

The hydrography of Hell Gate and its approaches from the eaRtwar<l was also executed. Hlld that of Little Hell Gate; Harlem Killf' ; and the connecting passage,s to the eastward of Randall's island. Tho least depth of water on the several roch at Hell Gate waR determined by su:eeping. ''Ono of the large sounding boats waf' laid broadRide to the current, nearly at Black water, having a loaded pole, twenty-four feet long, suspended by load lirrnB from the bow and stern. The boat was then allowed to drift slowl.v over the rocks, the pole being al way::; kept so as to touch the bottom. At the instant of finding the slioaloRt water, the position of the boat was carefully . determined, .and the operation \Yas repeated until tho 1vholc vicinity had been thoroughly swept."

The channel of the East river, to the westward of College point, was re-examined by Lieut. Comg. Temple and found to be somewhat. imp1·oved in depth since the older ;;urn~y. A thorough search was made hy t11e party in t.he steamer Corwin for the site of a wreck alleged to have been lodged in the lower bay, and around which it 1\-as suppo,.ed that ,,;and might he accumulating. Numerous lines of :-:oundinp;s ''"°ere run over the spot in quetction, which liad previously been marked by a. buoy. Only a small portion of the wreck was found remaining, but it did not appear that any shoal formation had commenced. Lieut. Corng. Temple's report i:,; given in. Appendix No. 14. The new form of sounding apparatus suggested by Lieut. E. B. Hunt, Corp8 of Engineers, assistant Coast Survey, the application of which, in practice with some necessary modifications in i·egard to details, had been arranged for by Mr. J. M. Batchelder, was tested in the channel near the navy yard. I subjoin in Appendix No. 48 a communication from Lieut. Comg. Temple, giving the result of the t.rialR made, and comparisons l1etween, the soundings determined by the water pressure and those obtained at the same time by the ordinary lead line. Having previously witnessed the performance of the apparatus in still water, in which the agreement of the reimlts was remark<tbly close, it may be inferred from those given in the report of Lieut. Comg. Temple that, with some further modification, the method may he adapted to soundings generally in any ordinary depth of water. The hydrographic chart of East river, between Hell Gate and Throg's Neck, the details of which were executed by the party of Lieut. Comg. Graven, has been completed and deposited in the archives.

Hydrography of Hudson river.-Tbe regular survey of this river was continued by the hydrographic party of Lieut. Comg. Richard Wainwright, U. S. N., assistant Coast Survey, until the time of his detachment from the work. Soundings were commenced at Fort Montgomery and extended up the river. In the middle of August the schooner Nautilus was put in charge of Lieut. Comg. James H. Moore, U. S. N., assistant, and the work prosecuted upwards as far as the railroad station, above Newburg, a d'istance by the river course of about fifteen miles and a half above Fort Montgomery. The survey was retarded by bad weather in Oetober. The deepest water found is abreast of :B'ort Montgomery, (28 fathoms,) and in the bend of the river, between West Point and Cold Spring, ranging from .36 to 2s fathoms. After passing Cold Spring, the water gradually shoals to N e-wburg bay, where the depth ranges from 7 to 9 fathoms. The channel here, as in the northern part of the ''Race,'' is on the western· side of the river. Soundings were discontinued on the 7th of November; The following is a synopsis of the statistics :

Comg. ~Wainwright in 1854, 1855, and 1856, have been deposited with duplicates in the office. Lieut. Comg ..Moore is now about to prGsecute the hyarogrnphy in Section V, assigned to Lieu!. Comg. 8. D. Trenchard a short time previo~s to the detachment of that officer. Tides.-The self-registering observations of tides at Governor's Island, New York harbor, were 8Uspended during· the winter, and replaced by observations on a common box-gauge at the .Atlantic Dock ferry, in Brooklyn. The self-registering tide-gauge was replaced on the 1st of May, and put under the charge of }fr. R. T. Bassett. A special series of observations on the tides and currents at Hell Gate was conducted by Sub-Asisi8tant H. Mitchell during the early part of the spring and summer. The object and scope of these investigations are stated in his report, which will be found in the Appendix, No. 35.

SECTION III.
FR9M CAPE HENWPEN TO CAPE HENRY, INCLUDING THE COAST OF PART OF DELAW:ARE, MARYLAND, AND PART OF VIRGINIA.-(SKllTOREl C, Nos. 16-24.)

The body of the triangulation, .nearly three-fourths of the topography, and quite four-fifths of the hydrography of this section are complete. The operations of the past year have included the triangulation of the Patuxent river, which is nearly completed ; of the branches of the Rappahannock, completed ; of York river, which is completed from the mouth to West. Point ; and of James river, which is nearly complete from Richmond to Chesapeake bay. The topography of the· seacoast of Virginia has made further progress; the shore-line and topography of the immediate shores of the Rappahannock river, and of its tributary, Currato-

man river, have been completed, and tho topography of York river is nearly finished. The hydrography of Patuxent Tiver )1as made considerable progress; that of the Rappahannock and its lower tributaries has been completed. That of the York river has been executed from the mouth to West Point, the junction of the Pamunkey and Mattapoui rivers ; and that of the James river has been eompleted to within nine miles of City Point. The details of all thcFlc snrveyR will he found in this chapter. The only large piece of work remaining in this section is the survey , of the Potomac river, for which there are two bases : one near the entrance, and the other near the head of tide, in the vicinity of W aBhington and Georgetown, both connected with the main triangulation of the coast. Offece-work.-Drawings have .been made, or are in progress, of the following sheets, viz : Rappahannock river from Fredericksburg to Port Royal; Rampton Road~; Xorfolk harbor; Chesapeake bay series ; York river and James river, upper part; the engravi11g of Patapsco river as a finished map ; Chesapeake bay :roi 0 0 , Nos. 1, 2, and 3 ; Rappahannock river, Nos. 3 and 4, as finished. York river entrance and Hampton Roads are now in progress. Triang'ldation ef Patuxent river, Maryland.-Lieutenant J. P. Roy, t. S. A., assistant, after completing work in another locality in this section, made in May a general reconnaisRance on both sid_es of the Patuxent river in the vicinity of Setterly Point, where the triangulation, carried upwards from the entrance, bad terminated in 1846. Not recognizing the :,;tatiom; before occupied, he laid ~ut a series of triangles above tho limit of the work of that year, extending from Leonard's creek to a point about five miles above Benedict. The chain thus· projected is provisionally independent of that coming from the entrance of the river, but. a proper connection will be made with it in the coming season. Fifteen stations were erected in the prosecution of the work, and the angle;; were measured by sixteen hundred observations. This duty was commenced on the 13th of May, and continued till the 5th of July, when Lieutenant Roy returned to the office. The limits of the triangulation are shown in Sketch No. 16. Duplicates of the descriptions of signals erected in the pre~ent season have been furnished by-Lieutenant Roy, and deposited in the archive!' of the section. Triangu7ation of Potomac river, Virgini'.a.-This work was commenced in the summer, by :M:r. Farley, in the vicinity of Alexandria. Seven stations vrnre occupied, and eight hundred and sixteen observa6ons made. Triangiilati01i ef St. JJfary's -river, 1Jfaryland.-Immediately after tbe corr..pletion of the hydrogrnphy of this river, which will be presently described, Assi::Jtaut. John Farley determined the stations and signals used in ma.king t.he soundings. Ten stations were occupied in the triangulation, and in its connection with the Potomac river, and fourteen hundred and twentyeight observations were made in the measurement of angles. TriangUlation of Ourratoman riJJer, Virginia.-The triangulation of Curratoman river, a tributary of the Rappahannock, which falls in on the north side of that river a few miles above its entrance into Chesapeake bay, was carried, by Assistant John Farley, from Gray's Point and Station "Whiting," (see Sketch No. 16,) on the south side of the Happahannock, and opposite the mouth of the Curratoman, upwards to the steamboat wharf at Merry Point. This work checks the preliminary triangulation previously executed of the vicinity 1)y the plane-table party of Assistant I. Hull .Adaimi, on the basis of which the shores of Curratoman river and Carter's creek were completed during the season. Assistant Farley occupied fourteen stations, and made twelve hundred and ten observations in completing the triangulat.iou of the Curratoman. He then proceeded with the work on James river.

REPORT 01'' THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Triangulation of York river, Virg-in£a.-At tho date of my report of last year, Lieutenant .T. P. Roy, U. S. A., at1,,istant, having reached Yorktown on the 20th of October, was engaged in completing the triangulation of the river above Purtan island, where his operations closed on the advance of the pr!'lvious summer. Sixteen stations were occupied, and fourteen new triangles laid out, and measured by one thousand six hundred and eight observations. The work was 'Carried above West Point to Glass island, on the Mattaponi, and to Taylor's Quarter, on the Pamunkey river. The data furnished by the triangulation were subsequently used by the hydrographic party, as will presently be notieed. Lieutenant Roy clo:ied operations on the 8th of December, and before taking the field again in this section deposited at the office sketches and descriptions of the signals erected on York river, and two volumes containing tho records of horizontal angles measured. The collector at Yorktown kindly loaned a custom-house boat to facilitate the progress of the party. At the opening of the present surveying year a considerable part of the triangulation of York river remaine~ for execution. This, as already noticed, has been completed, and the results of the concluding operations of the hydrographic party are shown in the preliminary chart (Sketch No. 22) accompanying this report. Triangu-Wtion qf James river, Virginia.-This work was advanced from its former limits in the direction of Chesapeake bav, . during the months of October, November, and December, of last year, by the party of Assistant John Farley, Twenty-one stations were occupied below the mouth of Chickahominy river, and the triangulation is now complete nearly to Newport News. A.bout four thousand angular measurements were made in the extension of the work. '!'ho record8 of horizontal angles observed on James river, and descriptions of the signals used iu the triangulation, have been completed and deposited at the office. It is expected that a connection will be made early in the ensuing season between the series on James river and the triangulation of Chesapeake bay. The two stations adjacent to Newport News (see Sketch No. 16) have been partly occupied by Assistant Farley; but his attention was turned, before completing them, to work on the Rappahannock and on the Potomac, near _A.lexandria. Notice haviug been given of the intended removal of the cupola of the Theological Seminary, which had been used as a station in the triangulation of tho Potomac, it ·was necessary to complete the connections with that station in the course of the summer. Sixteen stations were occupied in the triang.ulation of the James river, and seven on the. Potomac in the neighborhood of Washington and Alexandria. The number of angles measured during the season was one hundred and sixteen, in which five thousand two hundred and sixtyfour observations were recorded. Topography on the seacoast of Virginia.-This work has been continued by Mr. N. S. Finney, northward from Wallop' s island, where his sheet joins with the one last executed by Assistant G. D. Wise. The party of Mr. Finney took the field at tho end of July, and >iteady progress was made until the 25th of September, the weather being uniformly good for field operations. 'I'he topography executed em braces all the shore-line and details of the north end of Wall op' s island, the marsh islands in Chincoteague bay, and the southern, and part of the western, side of Chincoteague island. The shore line of the main was also traced from Snead signal, where the work of Assistant Wise terminated in 1856, northward and eastward to the boundary line hetween Virginia and Maryland, beyond Long Point. The limits of the topographical sheet are represented on Sketch No. 16. Mr. Finney thm; reportB the statistics of his plane-table work:

Tilghman served as aid in the topographical party, and efficiently assisted in the duties of the season. Mr. Finney has inked his sheet and deposited it in the office. His preparations have ,;ince been made for returning to carry on the topography of the shores of \\' accasassa bay, in Rection VII. Topography qf Rappahannock and Curratomari river.s, Vfrg£nia.-The preliminary topog:raph~· of the Rappahannock river, which has been for several successiye seasons in progress between Fredericksburg and the entrance into Chesapeake ba3-, was completed during the year liy the party of Assistant I. Hull Adams. A_t the date of my last annual report, it had Leen extended downwards on the immediate shores of tlw river to a point above the mouth of La Grange creek.-(See Rketch No. 16.) The work :was this season carried in the direction of the river, to a junction with the sheet executed near the entrance, by .Assistant John Seib. Sketch No. 16 represents the limits and proportions of the various sheets, which require, however, in many cases, filling up of interior details. The work of the season lies immediately adjacent to the mouth of Curratoman river, the shores of which were surveyed on a separate sheet. Above the Curratoman, the topogrnphy was resumed at Stations "Jones" and "Spindle," respectively, on the north and south banh of the Rappahannoc:k, and pushed souilnrnrd and ea8tward a distance of rather more than eighteDn miles, to a station below Parrott' s island, falling. on the sheet of Assistant Seib. The width of the part of the river included in this plaue-table work Yaries between two and three miles. La Grnnge, Robinson's, and Grbana creeks, were surveyed in connection with the 8hore;;; of the main riYer, the ·vork being carried up the last mentioned stream two miles and a half a11m·e its mouth, and including the town of Urbana and the topography intervening between it and Robinson' 8 creek. Field operations were suspend~d during winter, and re:mmed on the 1st of May at Beach Point and Bailey's Bluff, below the mouth of Urbana creek. Proceeding from thence in the direction of the river towards its entrance, the shores of the Rappahannock were traced to Toll' s Point at the mouth of Curratoman river. The sheet of the Currntoman extends about six miles aboYe its entrance into Rappahannock river, and includes its several branches known as Taylor's creek, Eastern branch, and Whitehouse creek. From Curratoman Point, the work was carried down the Rappahannock, and in its course embraces the shores of Carter's creek on the north side, and Meachim' s, Lockley' s, and Mill creeks on the south side of the main riYer. "The Curratoman river is about two miles and a half in width at its entrance, hut diminishes to a quarter of a mile at Merry Point, a distance of five miles and a half from its mouth.'' ''At Merry Point a landing has been built and steamboats stop there in passing to and from Fredericksburg and B~ltimore."

Sub-Assistant Charles Ferguson was attached to the topographical party. '.Phe plane-table work was completed in the field on the 29th of June, when the surveying schooner J. Y. J\Iason, which had been used for transportation, returned with the party to Baltimore, and A:;;sistant Adams was engaged in office-work and in field-work, in Section I, during the summer. The recent ,;heets of the survey of the Rappahannock river were inked during the summer, and have been registered in the Coast Survey office. Tcpography q/ York ri-uer, Virginia.-A plane-table sheet, executed by Assistant John Seib in 1855, included the mouth of this river, and its shores, to within three miles of Yorktown. The topography was resumed on the 21st of August, by the party of Mr. Seib, and continued with a view to the completion of the survey before the close of the season. Progress was reported on the 1st of Odober, at "-hich time 8ixty miles of the shore-line had been traced in carrying the work upward, to the immediate vicinity of Bigler' 8 mill, about seventeen miles from the mouth of the river. The plane-table work includes the details within a border varying· in width, from a quarter to half a mile along the banks. Mr. W. S. Edwards aided Mr. Seib in the topography, and in inking his sheets of previous work. At the close of the surveying season, the plane-table work on York river had reached a point only a short distance below the junction of the Pamunkcy and Mattaponi rivers. Hyd1·ography of Patnxent river, Maryw-nd.-From points furnished in the recent work of triangulation, beforn noticed, the ::mundings in this river have been extended from the entrance to Leonard's creek by the party of Commander W. T. Muse, U. S. N., asRistant Coast Survey, in the surveying steamer Hetzel. This work was executed towards the close of the season, the party having been previously engaged in three localities of Section IV. The statistics are thus given in a summary report from Commander Muse: Miles run in sounding . · ..... · ........... · ..·.... · . · · · 182 Number of soundings··.··· . ·. · ......... · ..· · · · · · · · · · 14,374 848 Number of sextant angles··· ............... · ..... · · · · · 430 Tidal obi,;ervation8 recorded · · · . · . · · · . · · · · · . · . · · · · · · · · ·
In connection with the soundings, tw~lve high and ten low waters were recorded. Commander Muse remarks that the facilitie s at the entrance of the Patuxent are such as to invite commercial enterprise : "Vessels of any size can enter and be well protected. Higher up the channel is sufficiently deep, but too narrow for vessels of large size." Bydrograpliy qf St. ,;liary's river, ~Waryland-This work has been executed in advance of the topography, by the hydrographic party of Commander Muse. A proper junction was made with the soundings of the Potomac river, to which it is a tributary. Aft.er a remark similar to that quoted in reference to the Patuxent, Commander Muse observes : ''The largest vessels can enter the St. Mary's river with ease, and be well protected. Its short distance from Chesapeake bay would enable vessels t.o leave in the severest winters, while others remain blocked in ice at most of our large cities. At convenient distances the river is indented by bays, which admit of vessels remaining at anchor to load and unload, without interfering with the main channel."

For purp-0aes connecwd with the reduction of soundings, four high and five low waters were observed. The work here under notice was executed, in November. Following in strict geographical order, it will presently be seen that the operations of this party were resumed at the usual -period of the season, iu charge of Lieut. Oomg. J. J. Almy, U. S. N., who was relieved by Commander Muse in July. Further duty executed under the command of the last named officer will be stated under the head of Section IV. Hydrography ef Rappahannock river, Virginia.-This work, in which st.eady advance has been made since its commencement, hy the party of Lieut. Oomg. Richard Wainwright, U. S. N., assistant Coast Survey, has been completed within the season just closed. The surveying sclxioner Nautilus, with the hydrographic party, reached her station from the Hudson, on the 22d of November, near the upper limit of the topographical sheet last executed by Assistant I. Hull Adams in 1856, (Sketch No. Hi ;) and the soundings were continued from that point down the Rappahannock to the mouth of Urbana creek, and up the channel of that stream beyond the town of Urbana. A month had been spent in the work, when further progress was stopped by the ice, and the operations were suspended until spring. On the 6th of May Lieut. Comg. Wainwright took up the soundingA below Urbana creek, and pushed the survey towards the entrance, following closely, and keeping pace, throughout the season, with the topographical party then at work on the shores. The shore line of Curratoman river having been furnished by Assistant A.dams, that branch of the Rappahannock was also included in the hydrography. Sketch No. 20 presents in the form -0f a preliminary chart the details of the work referred to, and shows its connection with thti hydrography of Chesapeake bay. The following is an abstract of the statistics : 329 Miles run in sounding··. · . · · .. · ........... · . · .. · ·....

The survey of the Rappahann-0ck was completed on the 22d of June, when Lieut. Comg. Wainwright transferred his party to Section II, and resumed the hydrography of Hudson river. In Yay, notice was received from the Navy Department that this excellent officer would be detached from the Coast Survey, and in .August the orders detaching him were received. His career upon the Coast Survey has been one of remarkable success, industry, and steady perseverance, leading to a thoroughness in· the completion of work not to he exceeded. He has labored throughout the year, changing place with the season, and has kept his office-work close up to that afloat, leaving nothing at loose ends. In beginning a piece of work he steadily looked to its -OOtnpletion, having in. view always the fini.shed result, and never being satisfied with desultory or irregular and intermitting effort. These qualities, and his experience, rendered Mm one of the most valuable ofticers· npOQ the survey, and his loss will be proportionably felt. The command of this party ha.s been assigned to Lieuwnant J. H. Mome, U. S. N., assistant . . Hydrograpky o/ York river, Virginia.-Following the triangulation which was completed shortly after th& closeof4he, last surveying year, the party of Lieut. Comg. J. J.

by the 3d of Ju]y the soundings had embraced the whole of York river, from its mouth to the junction of its two principal branches-the Pamunkey and :Mattaponi rivers, at West Point. Of the two hydrographic sheets containing the results of the season, the first in order of execution contains the soundings between the entrance and Bigler' s Mill, a dista.nce of about sixteen miles. The second, those between Weist Point and the upper limit of the sheet just referred to, making together a length of thirty-five miles of river work completed and plotted within the season. During the latter part of the period occupied in soundings, LiElut. Comg. -, Almy was necessarily absent from his party, and the hydrographic operations afloat were, in the interval, conducted by Lieut. Robert D. Minor, U. S. N. The zeal and efficiency of that officer, in his connection with tho various interests of the work, have been specially mentioned in the various reports made from time to time by Lieut. Comg. Almy, and deserve especial notice here. Nearly all the hydrography of the river was executed in the boats of the steamer Hetzel. The following is a synopsis of the statistics : 439 Miles run in sounding · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · · · · · · · .- · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Number of soundings · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 28,047 Sextant angles for hydrographic positions · · · · · · · · · · - · · · . · ·. · · · · · · · · 1,849 Thirty-three high tides and twenty-nine low tides were observed in the course of the work, and twelve hundred and eighty tidal observations made for reducing the soundings. Lieut. Comg. Almy thus remarks upon the capacity of York river : ''No one can look at the chart of the lower part of York river, from the entrance up to Yorktown, without pronouncing it a harbor of the first class. There is no bar at the mouth of this river, and the least water to be passed over in entering it is thirty-three feet at low-tide, near the tail of York Spit, in Chesapeake bay. After passing this the water deepens to six, seven and eight fathoms, increasing in passing up the channel to eleven and twelve fathoms abreast of Yorktown, where the shore is very bold, and wharves carried out a distance of fifty feet would strike four and a half and five fathoms water. The channel of the river is more than a mile in width, and with a few buoys aud beacons judiciously placed, the heaviest line-ofbattle ships could beat up or down the river without the least difficulty." ''Yorktown is situated about thirty nautical miles from the entrance of the river into Chesapeake bay. The location is elevated, and it could be easily fortilied at moderate expense against attack either by land or water. It affords a harbor sufficient for the largest navy and commercial marine, and next to Newport, Rhode Island, it is, in my judgment, the safest and the most commodious harbor in the United States." The preliminary chart of York river, resulting from the work of the season, accompanies this report as Sketch. No. 22. At the conclusion of the survey of York river, Lieut. Comg. Almy was detached from duty on the Coast Survey, and the hydrographic party in the steamer Hetzel was placed in charge of Commander W. T. Muse, U. 8. N., assistant. The records of soundings made in connection with previous surveys in this and the adjoining southern section, toge~her with duplicates ~md records of angles and tidal observations, have been received and deposited in the archives of the office. The recommendation of Lieut. Comg. Almy for a buoy to be pla.ced near Cape Henry, Wl!B oommun\ca.ted for transmission to the Light-house Board. It will be found in the Appendix No. 61. In the detachment of Lieut. Almy the Ooa.st Survey loses another of it& most efficient officers.

Always at work with a purpose, he has made a broad mark upon the hydrography of the coast of Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. His zeal and industry were never at fault, and his success was thus always to be counted on. His watchful care for the interests of commerce and navigation connected with his work was not to be surpassed. His ripe experience cannot soon or readily be replaced. Hydrography of James river, Virginia.-This work was resumed on the return of the hydrographic party of Lieut. Comg. J. N. Maffitt, u~ S. N,. assistant in the Coast Survey, from duty in Section V. In previous seasons the soundings had been extended from the entrance of the James river to the mouth of the Chickahominy. Early in July Lieut. Comg. Maffitt took up the work at Dancing Point, and carried it to a point within nine miles of the junction, beween the Appomattox and James rivers, at City Point, before the close of the season. The tides were observed in James river while the soundings were in progress. A summ&ry of the statistics is thus given in the season's report : 360 Miles run in sounding ...... · · · · · · · · . · · - · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Angles determined · · · · · · · .. · · · · · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 1, 37 4 Number of soundings.··.··.· .· · .· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 10,575 Tidal, observations.-The permanent self-registering observations at Old Point Comfort have been continued during the year under the charge of Mr. M. C. King. The self-registering tide-gauge, established last year at Tappahannock, was kept in operation (with a few interruptions by ice during the winter) until July, so as to obtain the regimen of the river during a whole year. SECTION IV.
FROM CAPE HENRY TO CAPE FEAR, INCLUDING THE COAST OF PART OF VIRGINIA AND CAROLINA..-{SKmCH D, No. 25.) NORTH

The progress in this section, anticipated in my reports of last year, and of the year before, has been realized, and the plan for completing the work of the section, developed in the latter report, has been steadily pursued. The preliminary small triangulation is now connected from Cape Henry to Cape Fear, and the topography of the ocean shores is nearly done between the same limits. The peculiarities of the work on different parts of this coast require different modes of strengthening this preliminary work, or of substituting other connected triangulation in its place. All this has been carefully studied by the light of the preliminary work, which serves as a very complete reconnaissance. Two hydrographic parties have been employed on the outer coast, in Hatteras and Ocracoke inlets, and on Beaufort bar, during portions of the year, making such progress as the stormy character of the season permitted. Cape Fear bar has been re-examined. Nearly half of the in-shore hydrography on the ocean coast of this section is done, and the principal shoals and inlets have been sounded out. · It will be easy by steady progress, as I have before stated, to finish the work of this section at the same time with that of Section III, to the north,' and Section V, to the south of it. In this section there remain the triangulation and topography of the shores of Pamplico sound and of its rivers, the rectification of the coast triangulation, a part of the topography between the head of Currituck sound and Cape Henry, and a small space between Stump and Topsail inlets. Any interruption to the successive operations would be disastrous among the moving sands of this coast, where it is difficult to preserve station points for any length of time, and where the top0graphical outline is subject 'to such changes. To these changes, as having an important

bearing upon the future condition of this important part of the coast of the United States, l must again call attention. The imoads of the ocean are steady. Offece-work.-Drawings of Beaufort harbor, Cape Fear river, (lower sheet,) and Cape Fear entrances, (comparative chart,) have been completed within the year, and the finished map of Albemarle sound, No. 1, has been in progress. The engraving of Cape Fear river, from Federal point to Wilmington, and seacoast of North Carolina, from Hatteras to Ocracoke, has been completed, and the following plates are in.progress: entrances to Cape Fear river, Albemarle sound, Nos. 1 and 2, and Beaufort harbor, (new edition.) Triangulation and topography in the vicinity of Cape Henry, Virginia.-In the progress of the triangulation, which had been brought by the party of Assistant J. J. S. Hassler, northward from the head of Currituck sound, a reconnaissance was made of the dese.rt tract intervening between it and Cape Henry, and practicable lines for the connection of that work with the triangulation of Chesapeake bay were approximately determined. During the present surveying season the efforts of Assistant Hassler were directed to the opening of avenues between the stations selected, and, in c.onsequence of the extreme inclemency of the seas<>n, this proved to be a work of unusual difficulty. Operations were begun early in December. Under favorable circumstances of weather, the natural obstaclGs to be encountered by the party in penetrating through swamps heavily timbered with gum, cypress, and oak, would have retarded progress, but to these were superadded impediments which have rarely interfered with the operations of the section. For continued periods during the winter the forest was covered with snow, which materially obstructed the advance of work on the lines, and the consequent fogs, added much to the difficulties cxpe1·ienced in making the subsequent observations. Preliminary measurements were made from two stations connecting with Cape Henry light-house, and at these six hundred and ten observations were recorded. Final measurements being hindered from time to time during the period allotted for work, Assistant Hassler executed a plane-table survey of the region lying immediately south of Cape Henry, the limits of whiuh will be seen on Sketch No. 16. Tho character of the tract, represented on his topographical sheet, is swampy, and much indented by small bays. It comprises fifteen miles of shore-line, and twenty·one miles of road. Assistant Hassler reports that the degree of cold experienced in the winter has been unprecedented in this section : ''Ice accumulated to the height of ten feet along the beach south of Cape Henry. Nearly all the wild fowl in the vicinity, many of the :fishes, and some of the cattle were frozen to death." Computations have been made of the geographical positions determined by the observations of Assistant Hassler. The records, in duplicate, of angular measurements made in the work near Cape Henry, with descriptions of the signals erected, have been deposited in the office. Triang1tlati-On on the outer coast ef North Carolina, extending to Cape, Fear.-On closing opera· tions, rcferrcu to as being then in progress, under Section II, in my last annual report, the parties of Assistant A. S. Wadsworth resumed, at Topsail inlet, the joint d11ty of triangulation and topography, and pushed the work southward and westward in the direction of Cape Fear. The coast series (a preliminary triangulation) is now complete from Cape Henry to Federal Point light-house, and by two triangles projected on Cape Fear river, by Assistant Wadsworth, it connects with the triangulation of that river and with the coast chain of Section V. The extent of coast in a direct lir\e, embraced in the work of the season, is about twenty-eight miles. Sketch No. 25 _represents the scheme of triangles completed, and its connection with

the work below Cape Fear. The following is an extract from the report of Assistant V{adsworth: "The obstacles t-0 progress were considerable on approaching the head of the sound. The woods approach the beach abruptly, and were of such a character as to require the use of very small triangles, in order to avoid the dense swamps; cutting was necessary for each side of the small triangles, excepting those following the beach. The Jines were opened through timber nearly valueless by reason of the difficulty of access to it.'' "The weather was very unfavorable throughout the Reason, and particularly so after the close of March.'' "The triangulation covers an area of thirty-three and a half square miles. Forty-fiv~ stations were occupied and forty-eight objects observed on in the work." "The Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 13, was used in the measurements, and one hundred and thirty-eight angles were determined by five thousand and three. observations.'' The party took the field on the 1st of December, and closed on the 25th of April. After the completion of the triangulation, Assistant Wadsworth engaged a vessel for the purpose, and revisited the coast between Cape Fear and Beaufort, North Carolina. He examined the stations previously occupied, and found them generally secure. This review of the work was made with reference to the selection of sites for bases of verification. Mr. J. L. Tilghman was attached to the triangulation, partly as aid, and rendered efficient service in the reconnaissance and other duties connected with the work. Field-work was concluded on the 3d of May, at which time Assistant Wadsworth proceeded to the office, and was assigned to topographical duty in Section I. Records of the horizontal angles and descriptions of the signals erected between Rich inlet and Cape Fear were completed during the summer, and have been deposited in the office. Topography of Hatteras inlet, North Oarolina.-After completing the plane-table survey, which will be noticed next in its proper geographical order, Mr. John Meehan, on being detached from the party of ~<lssiRtant A. S. "\Vadsworth, proceeded t-0 Hatteras inlet, and traced the shore-line necessary for the uses of the hydrographic party to be assigned to duty in that locality. Four miles of coast-line were determined, in connection with the adjacent topography and shore-line of the sound. .A.n island known as. '' Shell Lumps,'' lying four miles from the entrance to the inlet, the sand shoals in the sound, and the channel buoys, were also determined in position and represented on the plane-table sheet. Such of the stations formerly occupied in the vicinity as could be recognized were examined and secured by Mr. Meehan. He reports as an instance of the rapid changes to which the neighboring coast is liable, that "West inlet signal, which was erected in 1853 upon a sand· hill within the high water line, stands now two hundred and eighty-three metres seaward in the ocean." ''Hatteras inlet is making an easterly advance, and recently a small inlet has opened a quarter of a mile westward of it, which will probably be merged into the main opening. ~ishing shoal, lying at the interior mouth of the inlet, is assuming the character of a sand 18 .l~nd, while the sand shoals immediately north of it, formerly bare at neap low water, are now visible only at extremely low equinoctial ebbs. The accumulation of sand on Fishing shoal seems to be, as it were, the complement of this decrease." Topography ef ~lre irdet, North Oarolina.-Previous to the execution of the work detailed under the last head, Mr. John Meehan commenced a plane-table survey at a point two

miles north of.the entrance to Ocracoke inlet, and, following the outer coast southward, traced the shore-line to the entrance, and below it, until abreast of the village of Portsmouth, including on the sheet the corresponding shore-line of Pamplico sound, the adjacent islands, the new light-house on Beacon island, the channel light-boat, and th~ running buoys. The data thus obtained in this locality and at Hatteras inlet were furnished to the hydrographic party operating in this section, but the unusually stormy character of the season, which had much hindered the field-work, made it impracticable to execute soundings along the coast beyond' ha!bor ' entrances. Five and three-quarter miles of coast-line were traced by Mr. Meehan at Ocracoke inlet, and an aggregate of nearly twenty-five miles of interior shore-line in that vicinity and at Hatteras inlet, before referred to. The following remarks occur in his special report made at the close of the season : ''With the exception of the closing of the small inlet south of Amity shoal, some advance of Ocracoke inlet to the southward, and the steady encroachment of the ocean observed along the entire coast of North Carolina, I have found little change in the high water contour as compared with the survey of 1853. This inlet, however, must be subject to exterior changes. The beach which flanks it for a league on each side is a sandy flat, devoid of vegetation, and of such low profile as to be submerged by the ocean during heavy southerly gales." The work in this vicinity was commenced by Mr. Meehan on the 4th of May, and, in connection with that at Hatteras, completed by the 24th of that month. After turning in at the office his plane-table sheets he was assigned to topographical duty in Section II, and was so employed until the close of the surveying season. Topography if the coast if North Carolina cibove Gape Fear.-This work was carried on jointly with the triangulation, the details of which have been already given, hy a party under the direction of Assistant A. S. Wadsworth. Beginning a short distance above Rich inlet, and following within. the limits traced in the triangulation, Mr. John Meehan executed all the shoreline and topographical details included between it and Federal Point, at Cape Fear entrance. His first sheet was commenced on the 27th of December, and during the season four others connecting with it were completed. These embrace the shores of Topsail sound, Barren inlet, Middle and Masonboro sound and inlet, Myrtle sound, and the numerous intricate passages through the adjacent swamps. An extent of coast stretching twenty-eight miles southward and westward, and terminating at Federal Point, is represented on the connected sheets. Within this space three hundred and ten miles of shore-line were run. ''The marshes which compose the greater part of the sheets are very intricate· and difficult of access, being in many places overflowed at half tide, miry, and full of quicksands. In topography the general ~haracter is the same as on the other soun~s south of Pamplico, except that the main land is more thickly inhabited, and consequently presents more surface for detailed work." Assistant W adRworth thus concludes his report upon the duty executed by the plane-table party under his direction : ''Mr. Meehan, notwithstanding the unfavorable weather, succeeded, by perseverance, in keeping this work so far advanced that on closing the triangulation the topography had joined that of Cape Fear river, thus completing the coast from Topsail inlet to the upper limit of Bection V. He then proceeded under special instructions to Ocracoke inlet."

The topographical sheets have been inked and registered with others o( the present season in the Coast Survey office. A party is now about to be organized for plane-table duty in Section VI, the charge of which has been consigned to Mr. Meehan. About ten miles of topography yet remaining between Stump inlet and New inlet, on the coast of North Carolina, will be traced by Mr. Meehan before proceeding to Florida. Hydrbgraphy of Hatteras inlet, North Carolina.-A survey has been made of this inlet by the party of Commander W. T. Muse, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, with the surveying steamer Hetzel. The soundings were confined generally within the limits of the examination made in 1852. In the opinion of Commander Muse, the bar of Hatteras inlet has probably shifted since the former survey. Other remarks bearing upon the character of the inlet as a harbor are given in extracts from his report, Appendix No. 15. The following are statistics of the survey : Miles run in soundings . . . . . . . . . . . . ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48 Number of soundings · · . · . · .................................... . 3,962 Number of theodolite angles ................................... · .. 544 Tidal observations recorded · · . · . · . · · ............. · ........... · · .. 310 Six high and seven low waters were observed for hydrographic purposes. Hydrography ef Ocracoke inlet, North Oarolina.-This inlet has also been re-examined by the party of Commander Muse within the season. The work was attempted in July, but was deferred by the unfavorable weather which then prevailed along the coast of North Carolina. The result of the resurvey shows that the depth of water on the bar has decreased at least two feet since 1852. Commander Muse concludes from his examination that the present channel must eventually become useless ; but thinks there are indications of an opening to the northward and eastward of it. Some extracts from his report on the survey are contained in Appendix No. 15. A synopsis of the statistics is thus given in his general report :

This duty was executed by the party of Commander Muse, who thus reports the statistics : Miles run in sounding . . . . · · . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . · . . . 125 Number of soundings.... . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10, 726 Number of theodolite angles . · . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1, 396 Number of sextant angles...... . . . . . . . . . . . · · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 164 Tidal observations recorded · · · . · · · . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . 407 High water was observed in ten instances, and low water in eight, in connection with the hydrographic operations.

The subsequent labors of the hydrographic party in tho st.earner Hetzel have been stated under Section III. Hydrography southward from Cape Lookout, including Beaufort harbor, North Oarolina.-The surveying steamer Bibb, after refitting at New York, left that port on the 7th of March, with the hydrographic party of Lieut. Comg. C. R. P. Rodgers, U. S. N., and on the 10th arrived at Beaufort. "'Soundings could not be commenced until the 23d of March, in consequence of very bad weather and the shifting character of the sand hills on Bogue and Shackleford ba~ks, by which many of the marks left by the triangulation parties had become obliterated. Much annoyance was also experienced throughout the whole season by the frequent prostration of signals erected by us for hydrographic purposes." "Every available moment was improved for prosecuting the work, and, with much difficulty, and some hazard, we succeeded in extending the survey from Cape Lookout, twenty miles westward towards Bogue inlet." The fmundings were carried off.shore about fourteen miles to the southward, the outside limit ranging parallel with the coast. Twenty-seven lines were run in that direction, and crossed by others at right angles. Several traverse lines of soundings were also made within the limits of the sheet. In connection with the regular hydrography of the coast, Lieut. Comg. Rodgers made a careful resurvey of Beaufort bar and anchorage, and developed the changes which have ta.ken place since the survey made by Lieut. Comg. J. N. Maffitt, U.S. N., assistant, in the surveying year of 1853-' 54. The results obtained by the last named officer are given in detail in Appendix No. 14 of my report for that year. Appendix No. Hi of this report contains extracts from a communicatiou made by Lieut. Comg. Rodgers on completing the re-examination. His recommendations therein contained, in regard to buoys, have been transmitted through the Department to the Light-house Board. (Appendix No. 62.)

Two sheets, containing the results of this season's operations in the section, have been filed in the office. A chart showing by comparison the changes, developed by Lieut. Comg. Rodgers, since the former survey, accompanies this report. (Sketch No. 30.) In the course of. the summer new boilers were provided for the Bibb, and that vessel was continued in charge of Lieut Comg. Rodgers, for the hydrographic duty which has been described as executed by his party in Section I. Re-ex.amina;tion of Cape Foor bars and entra~.-A complete hydrographic resurvey of this vicinity was made in December by Lieut. Comg. J. N. Maffitt, U.S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey. The result of his observation showed, in comparison with the survey made in 1851, that '' for all essential purposes of navigation the old main bar channel has ceased to exist.'' Remarkable changes were also noted as having occurred in the entire locality south of. &ld Head Point. In his report Lieut. Oomg. Maffitt says : ''Where, in 1851, nine, ten, and eleve:n

feet could be found in the channel, only five, four, and three feet can at present be obtained at mean low water. On spring tides, and with a northwesterly wind, this old channel is in many places a wash.'' Lieut. Comg..Maffitt suggests the prolongation of the western Bald Head jettee, for deepening the channel, and cites, in support of that opinion, the improvement since 1852 of the o;lue, to which my attention was drawn in a personal examination of the main bar. Slight changes only were found in the western channel, and the middle ground i'i! reported as not having materially changed since the last 1:mrvey. At New inlet the shore-line was found to be much altered, and the Federal point channel narrowed, nearly closed, and shifted to the northward. The report of Lieut. Comg. :Maffitt, showing in detail the results of comparisons made between the recent survey and that of 1851, is given at length in Appendix No. 17. SECTION V.
FROM CAPE FEAR TO THE ST. MARY'S RIVER, INCLTIDING PART OF THE COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA, AND '.lHE COAST OF SOUTH CAROUNA AND GEORGIA.-(SK.ETCn E, No. 31.)

The same number of parties has been employed in this section this year as during the last, and the progress has been very considerable. The irnrties have been distributed as follows: . One astronomical party between Savannah and St. Mary's; two triangulation parties, one (a double party) between Winyah bay and Charleston, and between St. He]ena and the head of Calibogue sound, and one between Tybee and Ossabaw, Georgia; two combined triangulation and topographical parties between the Cape Fea1· and Shallotte inlet, North Carolinll, and at Sapelo inlet and Brunswick harbor; one topographical party on Edisto iBland and vicinity. and on the shores of St. Helena sound; two hydrographic partie><, one on the coast of South Carolina, between Cape Roman and Charleston, and the other on the coast of Georgia, in St. Simon's sound, Turtle river, and Brunswick harbor. Besides these, a topographical party has been at work, in part in this section, on the St. Mary's river and approaches, and Cumberland island, also for short periods, for revision work, near Charleston, and in surveying the eiteo for baB~s on Cumberland and Sapelo islands. I have already, in the introduction to my report, called attention again to Bull's bay and North Edisto entrances, as harbors of refuge well situated in regard to Chai'lcston. Of the eight inlets on the coast of Georgia, between Tybee and St. Mary's, a reconnaissance has been made of two, Doboy and St. Andrew's; a complete survey of one, St. Simon's; and the operations are in part completed in four others, Wassaw, Ossabaw, St. Catharine's, and Sapelo. Provision has been made for continuing these during the coming surveying season. A preliminary chart of St. Simon's sound and Brunswick harbor has been drawn, and engraved on a scale of ,ot-o-.,; additions have been made to the chart of Charleston harbor, 3 -otoo; to the comparative chart of Maffitt's channel, 50\ni; the drawing of St. Helena sound, 40 -} 011 ; and seacoast of South Carolina, from Cl!-pe Roman to Tybee island, Georgia, has been in progress. The engraving has been completed of the following charts: Charleston harbor, (additi0ns ;) ~faffitt's channel, comparative chart; North Edisto entrance, new edition; and the engraving of a chart of the seacoast of South Carolina, from Cape Roman to Savannah, is in progre.-.s. Astronomical and magnetic observations at Savawnah, Georqia.-The difference of longitude be~ween Savannah and Fernandina, Florida, was determined in the early part of the seasor. under my immediate direction. For this purpose ten chronometers were rated and passed by

REP0RT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

regular trips of the steamers to and from Fernandina, observations for time and chronometer comparisons being made at the astronomical stations selected at the two places, respectively. 'l'his determination was of special importance in consequence of the discrepancies in the best charts as to the longitude of Fernandina, now rising into renewed consequence as one of the termini of the air-line railroud across the peninsula of Florida, and from its connection with the triangulation across the same peninsula to unite the work on the .Atlantic and Gulf coasts. At Savannah, observations were commenced M~uch 25, and closed on the 30th of 4-pril.. The transits of two hundred and thirty-seven stars were observed on seven wires each,' with transit No. 3, C. S., of forty-five inches focal length. I was assisted in the operations by Assistant Charles A. Schott, who was temporarily relieved from the charge of the computing division for this duty, and had charge of the operations at Fernandina. A statement of the connected observations now detailed will be made under Section VI. Elaborate observations were made for personal equation, for the effect of temperature on the chronometers, and others, which, with the modes of discussion, will be found noted in the papers in the Appendix No. 30. Assistant Schott, aided by Mr. J. E. BlankenRoip, determined the magnetic elements at Savannah, using magnetometer No. 6, by Jones, and the dip circle No. 9, by Barrow. The dip was determined by two needles, their polarity being Teversed for half the number of observations, and the magnetic intensity was ascertained in the usual way by deflections and vibrations. Records of the observations made by my party have been completad by .Assistant Schott in duplicate, and filed with the archives in the Coast Survey office. The usual meteorological journals were kept up in connection with the observations. The records of observations made for latitude and magnetic elements at Macon, Georgia, by Assistant G. W. Dean, in 1855, have been received and deposited in the office, together with journals of the meteorological readings kept there and at De Rosset, N. C., and Columbia, S. C., in the following season. The operations for telegraphic longitudes which, for several successive seasons, have been noticed in my annual reports under this section, having been extended beyond its geographic limits, will be found described with the work executed in Section V lII.

Tr£angulation and topugraplty of the coast westward from Lockwood' 8 Folly, North Carolina.This work was resumed on the 26th of January at the limit reached last year, and has been extended westward by the party of Assistant C. P. Bolles. Many natural dhstacles to progress in the field occur in this part of the coast. The triangulation is based upon a reconnaissance of the region made in 1851 by Major H. Prince, U. S. A., then assistant in the Coast Survey. Assistant Bolles, in a summary report, thus refers to the work commenced in a former season under his charge at Cape Fear. I give it in more than usual detail as being an· excellent exposition of the method of working in a case i1ivolving much difficulty, and when the usual routine of triangulation cannot be followed to advantage. ''Before extending the secondary chain of triangles to the westward of Cape Fear river, it was deemed expedient to re-measure all the angles in the series connecting Smith's Island base with the mouth of the river, and in order to insure greater accuracy four additional stations were established in that vicinity." '·Taking ad vantage of the open country over Elizabeth and Dutchman creeks, tl1e next step was to extend a net of triangles along their hanks to Ash Swamp and the Georgetown r?a<l, respectively.''

THE UNITED STATES COAST SlJRVEY.

By selecting lines requiring the least cutting, as pointed out clearly by this preliminary survey, the points on Elizabeth creek were readily connected with others favorably situated along the seashore, and thus the secondary chain was gradually developed as far as Ash Swamp. The tertiary series, in conjunction with the secondary, will also serve a usefnl purpose in facilitating the extension of the primm·y work." ''A range of almost impenetrable ewamps runs parallel to the coast, tending to confine the secondary triangulation to a narrow belt, and therefore some modification of the plan before adopted became necessary. This was accordingly made, and the result gives exact information in regard to the most advantageous sites for points of observation, the limits of the triangulation, and also the data necessary for topographical purpos(,,;s, and thus both divisions of the party were enabled to keep pace with each other." '·The most conspicuous sand dunes on the shore were selected as sites for signals, and their relative positions determined by the theodolite and chain. In Urn course of the measurement the lines of high and low water on the seashore, and the range or groups of dunes, were carefully traced." ''A line was at the same time marked· out by reconnaissance direct from a signal on a Sand hill near the swamp, and by means of it all the topographical features, crossings of roads, and houses in the vicinity, were correctly located. This was adopted as a triangle side, (»ee Sketch Ko. 31,) after examination made with the view of changing its direction so as to require the least cutting. "A second line connecting with the first was traced out in the same way, and the triaHgle was completed in the selection of a third line to combine ·with the others the conditions mo;;t desirable in respect of practicabilit~', economy of labor in preparing for observations, and i11 the requisites for plane-table work. "In this manner several triangles were projected before avenues were opened between the stations, so that, if it became necessary to alter the direction to adapt the scheme more advantageously to the circumstances of the c0untry, thi;; might be done without loss.'' "The plan here detailed enabled me to extend four triangles on two baees through tlie narrow belt of country between Ash swamp and the seashore. Tl1se are sufficient for topographical and hydrographic purposes. ''Having reached Lockwood's Folly river, the next step was to find the widt~1 of the belt of country enclosed by the chain of swamps west of it. This information wa.q obtained by tracing a line from Holden (see Sketch No. 31) towards Stansbury swamp and its branches, and by making such an angle with the line to N. Galloway as would meet another at the swamp if run from N. Galloway parallel to the coast, in the sup1rnsed direction of the swamp." ''The triangle deduced from this reconnaisAance defined the position of the main branch of the swamp, and furnished a base for the chain afterwards extended to the western side of the river. Fulford was then brought into the connection, and another reconnaissance line tra~d frnm Lancaster westward. This last line showed clearly the necessity for a grndual reduction in tbe size of triangles to be laid out between Lockwood's Folly and Shallotte inlet." "The auxiliary work was carried on always with a view tu the developmeut of the topogi;aphy, as well as to serve the purposes of reconnaissance for the secondary triangulation, besides giving, incidentally information of the positions of such ohAtaclcs as would materially reta.rd progress in laying out a series of main triangles." , 'l'he party of Assistant Bolles was first organized for the work below Cape Fear, in December,

1854, and disbanded in the following May, after completing the survey from Smithville to Ash swamp, and re-measuring the angles between Smith's Island base and Smithville. The work was resumed in December, 1855, but operations \n the field were delayed until the succeeding month in consequence of extreme cold weather. The party continued the work until May, 1856, having completed the triangulation and topography as far westward as Lockwoo<l's Folly river. Sub-Assistant G. H. Bagwell assisted in all the operntions of the :first two seasons, and in the last Mr. W. S. Edwards served as aitl to the party. In tbe early part of the present surveying Eeat:on, Assistant Bolles made a resurvey of the shore-line adjacent to New inlet and the Cape Fear entrance to correspond with the resurvey by the hydrographic party. The regular work was resumed about the middle of January, and discontinued in May. The shoreline wat-\ traced to Shallotte inlet westward, and the topography is complete to Bacon's inlet, within a short distance of the opening first named. The triangulation now extends fifteen miles westward from Smithville, and reconnaissance has been made for work about five miles beyond this . In the measurement of angles, ninety-nine objects were observed upon by five thousand five hundred and sixty-five repetitions with a six-inch Bnumer theodolite. The statistics of planetable work are thus given by Assistant Bolles : Seaeohore traced · · · · · · · · · · · · · .... · ............... · . . . . . . . . . . . . 20ft miles.

Hinrichs aided Assistant Bolles during the present season, and his zeal and successful application to duty are mentioned in terms of praise in the report. Few tracts along the Atlantic sea board present greater obstacles to the advance of field work than the vicinity of the coast below Cape Fear. To accomplish the results thus far obtained, the parties of Assi.stant Bolles tracked the wilderness in many directions an aggregate distance of two hundred and twenty-three miles, and encountered severe labor in cutting and clearing a\·cnues for the triangle sides. In closing his report, Assistant Bolles expresses obligations to residents of Brunswick county, through whose land Aome of the avenneA in his work were opened, for courtesies shown, and for the spirit of liberality evinced in facilitating the progress of the operations. Four topographical sheets result from the plane-table surveys made. Assistant Bolles was employed during the summer in inking them and in the computations of the triangulation. Secondary tri.angul,ation, coast of South Oarolina.-This work has been continued under the charge of Assistant C. 0. Boutelle, to whom the surveying schooner Petrel was assigned at the opening of the present year, for transportation. The vessel reached Charleston on the 7th of December, and the remainder of that month was occupied in preliminary field arrangements for prosecuting the work of two parties--one of which, under the general direction of Mr. Boutelle, was conducted by Sub-Assistant B. Huger, jr. The first work of the party was the secondary triangulation of the coast towards Bull's bay. ''The new light-house on Fort Sumter afforded a good connection with the primary and secondary triangula.tton of the coast, and it was accordingly oooupied and connected by ol;iser·

vatiom1 with the well determined stations, Charleston Light, Circular Church, and Breach Inlet." "By the 9th of January, having carried the work as far as it could be done advantageously from Charleston harbor, the party in the Petrel moved to Dewee's inlet. Mr. Huger had made a reconnaissance upon the main land, and a couple of days' examination along the seacoast enabled us to Jay out a connected scheme of triangles up to Dewee' s inlet. The weather was cold and blustering beyond any previous experience in the section, but both parties labored zealously in erecting signals and opening avenues for observation on the lines of connection. A.t the close of the month the triangulation had been extended northward and east.ward over Long Island, Dewee' s, and Caper's island, and to the upper shore of Price's inlet." J.)m·ing the month of February the work was carried forward over Bull's island and through Bull's bay to Cape Roman by the parties working jointly. "Bull's bay we found to be a large sheet of shallow water intersected with numerous narrow channels leading from the creek entering the bay, but suitable only for navigation by light draught vessels.'' ".A. very fine harbor of refuge is made by the northeastern end of Bull's island with a safe and easy entrance from sea by night or day, and about fouT feet more water than at Charleston bar. .Although the Coast Survey chart .of this entrance was published in J 850, and a lighthouse has since that time been erected here, I cannot ascertain that the pilots have, in any instance, taken vessels in for refuge." A. sufficient number of stations having been occupied to furnish the hydrographic positions required for use in the party of Lieut. Comg. J. N. Maffit the triangulation was left in charge of Mr. Huger, and Assistant Boutelle proceeded to Georgetown. On making a reconnaissance for the secondary work between Cape Roman and Wihyah bay it was found that both ends of the South ii:iland base, measured in 1853, had been washed away. The site of its southern terminus was reproduced by observing from adjacent stations, and a line eBtablished between it and station "Lowdnes," lying to the southward and westward, for connecting the series pushed in that direction by Mr. Huger. "A. succession of gales and rain storms, in the month of March, greatly impeded our progress, subjecting us to much discomfort and some peril, as we were obliged to land directly upon the sea beach in th~ surf, instead of reaching our stations from interior waters in the usual manner. We found greater difficulty of access to the shore in this quarter than in any other north of Charleston, and much time was lost in consequence. . "The reconnaissance was made, signals erected, and some of the stations occupied by the 12th of March, when we returned to Bull's bay." "Sub-Assistant Huger was retarded in his work by the same blustering weather which had caused so much delay in the operations of my party and by the labor of opening a difficult line upon the main land side. "Both parties engaged in the measurem,ent of angles when it was possible, and by the 17th of March all the stations resting on Bull's bay had been occupied. Mr. Boutelle then proceeded in the schooner Petrel to continue his triangulation southward from St. Helena sound. ·

"Mr. Huger continued the secondary triangulation from Cape Roman with a view to its C?nnection with that execut<3d at Winyah bay in 1853, but alternate gales and the prevalence

of smoke so hindered his operations as to prevent the completion of the necessary observations. His party returned to Charleston on the 7th of May." ''The work from CharleRton to Georgetown light proceeds for a distance of forty-six miles through an unbroken series of eleven quadrilaterals in which both diagonals have been observed. This is the most symmetrical chain of triangles yet obtained upon the southern Atlantic coast, and no other part of the coast of South Carolina affords equal facilities for its prosecution. In the progrnss of the work forty-one stations have been occupied, and five hundred and ninet~ eight angles measured upon five hundred and fifty objects, by five thousand seven hundred and seven observations. One primary tripod and scaffold, twenty-Reven secondary signals, and twenty-two of the third order have been erected, and the triangulation has determined the position of eighty-eight points for the use of the topographical and hydrographic parties.'' In reference to the extension of the primary triangulation northward and eastward from Charleston, Assistant Boutelle observes: ''I do not apprehend serious difficulty in carrying the primary work from Charleston to Winyah bay. The stations along the sea board are already intervisible, and the interior ones may be made so by judicious and careful reconnaissance along the openings formed by the W ando river and Owendaw creek. The diagonal lines must cross and recross the belt of pine forest extending from Haddrell' s Point to the Santee river, and great care will be required in projecting lines so as to avoid intervening buildings on both sides of the belt.'' The party of Assistant Boutelle, in the schooner Petrel, was detained at Charleston by head winds until the 25th of March, and advantage was· taken of the interval to re-occupy some of the stations of the original triangulation of Charleston harbor, made in 1849, connecting with the general triangulation of the coast and the new central station upon Fort Sumter. Five stations were thus occupied, and four hundred and thirty observations made in the measurement of thirty-six angles. On the approach of favorable weather the schooner left Charleston, and Mr. Boutelle met me, by appointment, at Savannah, where preliminaries were arranged for grading and preparing the site for a base of verification in Section I. These being completed, the secondary triangulation was taken up at. the head of Calibogue sound. Several stations were occupied in ihis vicinity, and others established for continuing the work northward across Port Royal entrance. Bad weather coming on, Mr. Boutelle proceeded to the dosing stations of his last year's work on St. Helena sound, and e.rected signals necessary for extending the triangles to a junction at Broad river with the series attempted from the upper limit of the triangulation of Calibogue sound. A. succession of gales and unfavorable weather prevented the completion of observations. Twelve stations in all were occupied, at which sixty-seven angles were measured by eight hundred and twenty-six observations. "The bases Station isl,an.dr-Par1·y, Parry-;--Dorr, and Dorr-Oyster, (Sketch No. 31,) serve, respectively, to carry the triangulation up Beaufort, Broad, and Colleton rivers. Another chain of secondary triangulation passing up Morgan island and Coosa river will meet that of Beaufort, and still another chain will cross betw~e:o. St. Helena and Ladies' island, striking Beaufort river about five miles below the town. These will furnish points for a minute topo· graphical survey of the country between Beaufort and the ocean.'' The party of Mr. Boutelle was broken up on the 5th of May. By agreement with the mayor of Charleston, the schooner Petrel was left at that. port to be used until the next approach of the season for work in this section as a quarantine guard ship, and to be then returned in the condition in which the vessel was delivered for that purpose.

Mr. F. P. Webber and Mr. G. E. Humphries served as aids in the two triangulation parties. Assistant Boutelle and Sub-Assistant Huger wore subsequently engaged at different localities in Section I, as stated under that head. Two volumes containing the duplicates of records of horizontal angles measured in South Carolina have been deposited by Mr. Boutelle in the office. Secondary triangUlatfon and reconnaissance ef Wassaw and Ossabaw sounds, Georgia.-Some delay occurred, in beginning the work assigned in this section, to the party of Lieutenant A. W. Evans, U. S. A., assistant, in consequence of damage to his vessel, the schooner Hassler, on the passage to Savannah. The necessary repairs having been made, Lieutenant Evans commenced operations on the 3d of January ~by making a compass reconnaissance and erecting third order signals along the Great and Little Ogeechee rivers, Vernon river, the shores of Ossabaw sound, Odingsell creek, and the outlet of the Romerly marshes, and on Wilmington river, Wassaw island and sound, and Tybee river, to connect with stations of the triangulation completed on the Savannah river. As soon as a sufficient number of signals had been erected, the measurement of horizontal angles was begun at the stations on Ossabaw sound. The winter and early part of the spring proved to be unexampled in severity, and many hinderances incident to unfavorable circumstances of the weather retarded the field-work. Fogs and haze prevailed until May. That month and the following were more favorable, and good progress was made until the close of the season. ''In prosecuting the triangulation, a good connection was made with the work of Assistant A. W. Longfellow on Romerly marshes, and his signals, which were all found standing, w-ere of great service, particularly in the neighborhood of W assaw sound. The work in that vicinity was taken up on completing the measurements· at Montgomery and on the Ogeechee river, and I was successful in making a series of large triangles, which connect a base of the Savannah triangulation with W assaw sound, Romerly marsh, and Ossabaw sound.'' Lieutenant Evans accompanied me in April in an examination of the sites for a base on Sapelo island, originally pointed out by the reconnaissance of Assistant Jam es S. Williams. I left, in his charge, the execution of the work to Mr. H. S. Du Val, aid to the party, who was to make a plane-table survey of the base sites and vicinity on Sapelo island, (Appendix No. 39.) This survey was satisfactorily executed, and a report made upon it after the close of the season. Sketch No. 31 shows the scheme of triangulation referred to in this section.

Topography of <Jhar1eston, S. 0.-.A. resurvey of the wharf lines and of the additions made since 1848 was in part executed between May 12th and the end of June, by Mr. W. S. Edwards, who was detached for that special duty from th'e party of Lieut. Comg. J. N. Maffitt, then engaged in prosecuting the hydrography of the section. The wharf lines along the .A.shley and Cooper rivers were traced, and the alterations which have been made were marked on the sheet. In prosecuting this duty Mr. Edwards chained a distance of forty-seven miles and a half in the various streets of the city, measured an aggr'egate length of three miles of wharf line, and traced six miles of shore. The data contained on his topographical sheet, with that to be obtained next season, will be used in the new edition of the chart of Charleston harbor. TO'j)Of!raphy of Wadmdaw illland and river, and parts of Dawlw and South Edisto rivers, S. C.-The work in this vicinity has been completed by the party of Assistant John Seib, and au additional plane-table sheet has been commenced for the extension of the survey of the shores of St. Helena sound. The party sailed from Baltimore on the 15th of November in the surveying schooner Wave, and was met on the 27th by .Assistant Seib at Charleston, where the vessel was detained by unfavorable weather until the 4th of December. Assistant Seib joined in his first sheet with the limits reached in a previous year by Assistant G. D. Wise, and continued the topography along the main road and seacoast to South Edisto river, where his work of last season terminated. The two sheets then under way are completed, and now embrace the shores of Wadmelaw river from the North Edisto to stations in the triangulation of Assistant C. 0. Boutelle, (see Sketch No. 31,) part of Wadmelaw island, parts of Togodo and Mc Cloud creeks on the main land, the lower part of Dawho river, Rus· sell' s creek, on Edisto island, and the topography between these creeks and rivers, and extending to the main road on Edisto island. Part of the Pon Pon, and the greater part of 8-0uth Edisto river, with Jehossee and Edisto islands, Fenwick's, Pine, and Otter islands, the intermediate topography and the shores of the .A.shepoo river from St. Helena sound to a point about a mile above Fenwick's island, are also included in the completed work of the season. On a third sheet commenced hy Assistant Seib, a part of the shore-line of St. Helena sound has been traced. In reference to the character of the t-0pography represented on his finished sheets, Assistant Seib observes : "The surface is low .and almost level ; the highest point on Edisto island is elevated about fifteen feet above tide, and occurs near its middle. The slopes are mostly gradual towards the marshes, and steep on or near the water courses. ''The entire work includes a group of islands and ex.tensive marshes, difficult to traverse in the vicinity of the salt water, but more solid when above its reach." "Much of the land in this locality has been recently laid out in rice plantations. The roost extensive of these is on Jehossee island, which is now intersected by nearly twelve miles of canal, cut to admit the water to, or drain it from, the rice fields." .A. synopsis of plane-table .statistics is thus given in the report of the seasGn1 s operations :

ing them to the office engaged in the topography of York river, which has been noticed under Section III. His arrangements are now in progress for an early return to this section. Topography qf Sapclo sound and shores ef Sapelo river, Georgia.-I<'ollowing the triangulation of this vicinity, described in my last annual report, Assistant A. W. Longfellow commenced the topography on the 13th of December, and prosecuted it ·with such interruptionR only as were ocGasioned by the inclement weather, which prevailed generally on the southern coast, until the 22d of March, when his attention wm; directed to another locali t}T, as will be hereafter noticed. "Tho results obtained in the vicinity of Sapelo sound aud urnpped comprise one humlred and thirty·four miles of shore-line and three miles of road, within an area of thirty-seven square miles. The limits of the sheet (Sketch No. 31) exteJ](l from east to west thirteen miles and a hal±~ and from no1:th to south nine miles, and include fourteen miles in extent of tho channel of inland navigation. On the south it traverses the western side of St. Catlrnrinc's sound through Johnson's creek, cros:-Jes the sound on a south course towards Blackbeard island, thence west to the northern or High Point of Sapclo island, from which it passes up the broad and shallow channel of Mud river to Tea Kettle creek, communicating with Dohoy sound. The outer, or ocean shores of the islands were also run to the limits of the sheet, the map showing two and seven·tentbs ruiles on Blackbeard, and five and five-tenths miles on St. Catharine's island.'' '' The survey extends from the entrance westward through the sound and up Sapelo river, a distance of eleven miles and a half, to a point a mile above Sutherland's bluff." The following remarks in reference to the surface and other features are also extracted from the report of .Assistant Longfellow: "The topography has the usual character of the southern coast, the sea islands being sand hanks, protected on the ocean side by a series of parallel ridges thrown up by the action of the sea and the winds, and running generally with the trend of the coast. The level portions form the plantations which produce sea island cotton. These subside inland into extenl"ive marshes, intersected by innumerable creeks, through which passes the remarkable channel of inland navigation, before alluded to, extending from South Carolina to Florida.' 1 "The entrance to Sapelo sound is more than a mile in width at high water, and lies between St. Catherine's island on the north and Blackboard island on the south.'' The hydrography of the sound, including Sapelo river, as far as the plane-table f'Urvey has been carried westward, will be commenced and, if practicable, completed, early in the ensuing surveying season.

Topography cf Brunswick harbor, Gcorgia.,.-.A.s the proposed site for a naval depot, attention having been directed to Blythe island, in the immediate vicinity of Brunswick, .Assistant Longfellow was instructed to make a detailed survey of its shores and interior, upon a scale double the size of that first intended. This duty was commenced on the 24th of Mai;ch, and com1lleted on the 29th of April. ''It consists of the minute survey of Blythe island, called for by special instructions; the ex.tension of the shore-line of Turtle river with its branches, to a point seven miles above Brunswick:, at the head of Blythe island ; the shore-lino of Brunswick harbor and of the channel thence to Blythe island ; and a survey of .Academy creek to the outlet of the A.ltamaha canal. 1 '
"The number of miles of shore-line run was sixtv-two The area · .I , and of roads six miles. included by the survey is about sixteen square miles.1' "Blythe island upland extends from north_ to south four miles, and bas an average width of

nearly a mile. The measured area il'l three and one-tenth sq"Q.are miles, equal to nineteen hundred and eighty-four a.cres. Including its marsh extensions; the total length of the island is six miles. 'l'he marnh at the southern end has an area of five hundred and ninety-five acres." "Turtle river bounds the island on the east. Its western side is irregular in outline and difficult. of access, the marsh and creeks there being much broken. Except in the old plantation fields it is covered with a growth of small pines of little value.'' Data requisite for the uses of the hydrogrn.phic party of Lieut. Comg. S. D. Trenchard, U. S. N., assistant, were furnished by Assistant Longfellow in the prngress of his work. He has <tlso furnished descriptions of the signals employed in the triangulation of the Romerly nmrshes, and completed and turned in duplicates of his triang'ulation of St. Simon's sound and Ilrunswick harbor. ~Ir. Clarence Fendall served as aid in this party during the season. Assistant Longfellow specially refers to his intelligent and efficient services. The schocmer Mereuith was u::;ed for the transportation of tlie party during the season, returning to the north in May, and being employed in the plane-table work at Portland, mentioned under its propc1· head in Section I. Preparations are now makiug to resume work on the coast of Georgia. Hydl'Dyraphie re8w·vCJ/ ql Cape Fear bar and New inlet, North Carolina.-Before resuming the regular oui>iide hydrogrnphy of this section, at the beginning of the present surveying year, Lieut. Comg. J. :N". Maffitt, U. S. N., aBsistant in the Coast Survey, made a thorough re-ex· amination of the bans and channels at <Jape Fear entrance. The surveys made in this locality in 1851 and 185:?. wcTe taken by him aR tlie baRes of compariRon, and the rmmltR were presented in a specinJ report, a copy of which is given in Appendix No. 17. The Sketch No. 33 shows distiuctly the changes which have takm1 phwo. The main bar has shoale<l, and the western chaunel is now the main entrance. The pocket observed in 1852 as affording the rudiment of a new channel through the m<1in bar has improved, extending still nearer to the ocean than formerly. In tho re,;urvey at Cape Fear the soundings were extended about ton miles and a half abreast of the western bar and main ship channel, and carried inside as far as a line joining Bald Head light-house and Fort Caswell. The hydrography executed at New inlet comprises the space two miles seaward from Federal point, and extending southward and westward, to include the entrance, beyond Zeek's isbnd. A synopsis of the sfatistics of this work is thus stated in the general report of Lieut. Comg. :Maffitt: Miles run in sounding · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · .... · . . . . 506 Number of angles determined··· - · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·. · ·.. . . . . . . · · . . 1,832 Number of soundings······ · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . ·. · ·. · .. 27, 143 Hydrography C!f the coast of Sonth Oarolina.-The in-shore soundings necessary for the completion of the coast chart between Cape Roman and the entrance to Charleston harbor have been executed by the party of Lieut.

The limits of this work include the entrance to Bull's bay, and a belt of hydrography extending evenly so11thwa1·d and westward along the coast to a distance seaward of about ten miles. Two surveying vessels, the schooners Crawford and Bancroft, were employed in this service, and while thus engaged, on the 4th of January, the first named vessel was blown from her

station off Bull's island in a furious storm which prevailed along the coast. By extraordinary exertions Lieut. Chandler, the officer in charge of the Crawford, kept the vessel fLfJofLt during twenty-four days of unusually tempestuous wmither, and finally succeeded in reaching Smithville, North Carolina~ with loss of sails, one of the surveying boats, and considerable damage to the hull of the sc~ooner. To the energy of Lieut. Chandler and the excellent conduct of the crew must be attributed the preservation of the vessel, which, before making port, had lieen leaking badly. The hydrography of the immediate coast, from Cape Roman to Tybee Light, is ~ow complete. Considerable progress has also been made in the off-shore soundings of this vicinity, and in the investigation of the normal current at stations distant twent;~ miles from the land. The completion of the off-shore work was prevented by bad weather. Supplementnry lines, requisite to the completion of the deep-sea hydrography, will be run on the ucxt return of the vessels of the party to the section.

completion proceeded to Section VI ; under which head will be mentioned the subsequent operations of tho hydrographic party. A recommendation, made by Lieut. Comg. Trenchard, for the placing of two adclitional buoys to mark the line of best \vatcr in entering St. Simon' R sound, was communicated to the Department in the usual manner for transmission to the Light-house Board, (see Appendix, No. 63.) Eight volumes, containing records of the soundings and tidal observations made at Brunswick and St. Simon':; o;cmnd, have been depo8ited in the archives by Lieut. Comg. Trenchard. He has also completed and returned the three hydrographic sheets of that locality commenced in 185G. The additional data obtained in the present year, including the topography executed by the party of Assi~tant Longfellow, appear, in the preliminary chart of St. Simon's sound ancl Brunswick harbor, as No. 37 of the sketches accompanying this report., T~'des.-The permanent self-registering tide-gauge at the custom-house wharf, Charleston, has been kept in operation by Mr. W.R. Herron with great regularity. Observations of tides, for short periods, wore altio made in connection with the hydrographic work at Brunswick, Jekyl isbnd, and Turtle river, Georgia. A series of observations were conducted during three months at a station near St. Simon's light-house, to verify the results obtained during the previous season on .Jekyl island. The comparison showed that they were . entirely satisfactory, and that the obstruction of the low water wave, off the mouth of the creek whore the gauge was placed, had caused the discrepancy in the results of Mr. G. Wiirdemann in 1855, and those of Lieut. Comg. Trenchard in 1856.
Gl:LF STREAM.

The observations, for tlie most part, of the past season, have been incidental ones. Commander B. F. San<lr;, 'L. S. N., assistant Coast Survey, returni11g from the Gulf of Mexico, ran a line on the inner warm bancl of the Coast Survey chart, carrying depths from a hundred and fifty-six to twnnty-five fathoms, from about the latitude of Cape Canaveral to "-1.thin fifty miles south of Cape Fear, where bad weather and leaky boilers put a stop to the observations. A line was run, but under unfavorable circumstances, by Lieut. Comg. Craven, from Havana to Key West, 1ooundings for temperature being taken at various depths to four hundred fathoms. Bottom was reached at that depth about seventy nautical miles from Havana, and the lowest temperature observed at that depth was about 48° Fahrenheit. · Lieut. Comg. 0. Il. Berryman made several efforts to run a line across the Gulf Stream, after its divided trend to the eastward, as shown by the Coast Survey chart. In his last voyage, on a line from Halifax towards the Bermudas, he had reached a position south of 39° north latitude, when, all his sounding line and wire being expended, he was forced to return, with the loss of several instruments. There has not b~en time yet to study these results, but extremely lowtemperatures seem to have been reached, as low, if the indications of tho thermometers can be trusted, as 19° Fahrenheit. The greatest depth reached was 2, 987 fathoms, (3.4 miles,) when 3, 040 fathoms of line were out. The temperature appears to have been 25° Fahrenheit. Thiti very difficult section of the Gulf Stream yet remains to be explored. A continuous line of soundings for temperature was run in the axis of the stream, from the Tortugas to the Chesapeake entrance, by· Lieut. Comg. J. C. Febiger, on his return froro Section IX, in the surveying schooner Arago. The observations were made at the surface, and at depths of fifteen fathoms, and show, conclusively, what I had before inferred from tho comparative results of the different sections, that the Gulf Stream water varies in temperature

irregularly at different parts of the axis of the stream i depending, probably, upon the temperature of the air on the Gulf of l\foxico, so that a more southern point at particular times may have a lower temperature than a more northern. The ease with which the axis of the stream was tracked, by using the Coast Survey chart, was quite remarkable. SECTION VI.
FROM ST. MARY'S RIVER 'IO ST. JOSEPH'S BAY, COAST OF FLORIDA, AND INCLUDING THE FWRIDA REEFS AND KEYS.-(SKETCH F. Nos. 39 ANn 40.)

'.l'he triangulation of the Florida reefs and keys has been rendered continuous this season from Virginia key (Cape Florida) to the Marquesas, anticipating by a sea~on the result stated in my last report. When the connection is completed of the triangulation with the Cape Sable base by which the two bases, the one at Key Biscayne, and the other at Cape SalJlc, will be brought to bear upon the lengths of the same sides, we shall he able to determine whether this triangulation shall be accepted as final or rnnst be further streng·thened, or be considered only secondary to a main series, In any case an astronomical station is needed about the middle of the work, and it may be thai this is all that will be rec1uisite to make the geodesy complete. Two more seasons will cloRe the topography of the keys, if the same means be furnished during the second as are now available for the first. Two or three seasons also of continuous effort will complete the 11ydrography of thiR, tho most dangerous, part of the coast. The effect of the knowledge already spread in regal'd to it, and of the examinations which have furnished data for the orection of signals, beacons, and lights, in diminishing the risks of navigation, is admitted by those who have observed the wrecks and disasters of former and recent years. Including the work upon the main, as well as upon the keys and reefs, eleven parties have been employed during the pa14 season, viz: triangulation parties, one on the air line from Fernandina to Cedar keys, and two between Point Charles and Stirrup key; five topographical parties, viz: one on Amelia island and its vicinity, two upon the keyR between Key Largo and Plover key, and one on the northern part of the group known as the Pine keys and on the main near Cape Sable ; a hJ-drographic party during a brief part of the season in Fernandina harbor and its approaches, and another during the season on the reef, the latter party having a steam vesRel. Sixty-nine miles in extent, following the sides of the triangles in the reckoning, have been completed, and six hundred and sixteen miles of shore line, exclusive of creeks and interior passages. A line of soundings for temperature has been made across the Gulf from Key West, and tidal observations with selfregistering instrumentR have been kept up at five stations. The details of these various operations, which have employed the skill, energy, and industry of a number of capable officers, will be found in this chapter. With a continuation of the meanR appropriated for work in this section during the past three years the triangulation of the whole section could be completed in from five to seven years. The topography could be kept closely up to it, say within one season, and the hytlrog~ra1Jhy within some two seasons of the triangulation. Cutting off the small triangulation of Florida peninsula from the main series of the coast is a most important step, and there now appears to be no reasonable doubt that it can rertainly be done, and with a moderate outlay of expenditure. The open character of the route between the St. Mary's and Oedar keys will permit the opening of avenues for the sides of

78

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

the trianglos at a moderate expense. As a measure of economy and of efficiency there can be no doubt of the very great advantage of the air-line across the head of the peninsula. If the small triangulation around the peninsula must be so strengthened as to connect the work on the Atlantic and Gulf of :Mexico, foe expense would lie very greatly increased, and the time of its execution would be much prolonged. Under the present conditions it becomes a comparatively rapid and inexpensive work. Ofticc-work.-The drawing and engmving of the sheets of St. John's river have been com- ' pleted, and the drawing of a chart of the Florida reefs from Carysfort light southward is in progress. Astronomical observations at Fernaniliria, Florida., for differences ef longitude, and magnetic ol,servat1:ons.-'l'he operatio1rn of the party organized under my immediate -direction, for the determination of tho longitude of Fernandina, .A,melia island, Florida, have been referred to under Section V, the observations being made in connection with others at Savannah, Georgia. During the month of April two sets of chronometers, five in each set, wore sent and returned by the regular steamers in their passages between Savannah and Fernandina, eight interchanges in all being thus made. Tho chronometers ·were compared by the method of coincidences. At the station on Amelia island, transit No. 10 was mounted and adjusted for use on the 1st of April. Between that date and the 27th of April, the transits of 147 stars over nine wires each were observed ; with the exception of the determination for personal equation, these oLservations were made by Assistant Charles A. Schott. In addition to these, thirty-three sots of chronometer comparisons for longitude were made. The transit used has a magnifying power of thirty-five and a focal lengtl1 of twenty-six inches. Chro11ometer, llutton, No. 311, was employed for time in noting the observations. At the commencement and near the close of operations several determinations were made of the personal equation of the observers at the two stations. The observations necessary for instrumental corrections were made and applied in the usual manner. Ob;;ervations were continued at Savannah and Fernandina at the same time-by myself at the former, and by Assistant Schott at the latter place. Towards the close of the operations the observers changed places. MesRrs. J. R. Toomer, J. E. Blankenship, and D. Hinkle, served as aids in the party. The last named aid accom· panicd the chronometers in their transit between the stations, and made the comparisons generally. The usual meteorological observations were 1·ecorded at both stations. As soon as practicable after the return of the party to the office the results obtained by observation were computed. One of the best existing maps was found to be in err~r nine miles in the longitude assigned to Fernandina. The determination now made is dependent on the telegraphic longitude of Savannah, observed in 1851. Assistant Schott, aided by Mr. Blankenship, made observations for magnetic declination, dip, and intensity, at the geodetic station at :Fernandina, on the 6th, 10th, and 20th of April. The station chosen is about a third of a mile north of the observatory. Magnetometer No. 6 and dip circle No. 9 were used. Mr. Schott also verified the direction of the meridian line traced by Sub-Assistant E. Goodfellow, on Amelia island, in 185G. Five volumes original, and four others in duplicate, containing the records of chronometer comparisons, observations for time, and tho magnetic elements, with the usual meteorological records, have been completed by my party, and are deposited in the archives of the office. On concluding tho operations at Fernandina my party returned to the office, and immediate

preparations were made for work in Section I, the details of which have been given in their proper place. Assistant Schott was at that time Te-assigned to the charge of the computing division, which, during his temporary absence, had been conducted by Assistant J. E. Hilgard. A paper on the method employed in determining the diiferenceR of longitude between Savannah and F·ernandina will be found in Appendix No. 30. Reconnaissance and trfo.ru1ulation for air-line rneasuremeni lietu;een Ferna'fldina and Cedar Keys, Florida.-This work, -for which a special appropriation has been made, was commenced by Captain .J. H. Simpsou, U. S. Topographical Engiueers, asBistant in the Coast Survey, on the 8th of December. Starting from a camp near Loftin's creek, about ten miles from Fernandina, with the necessary equipment, the party weTe occupied hventy-one days in traversing the route of the railroad and adjacent country in the direction of Cedar Keys. The entire distance travelled in the reconnaissance wm; fonr hundred and twenty-nine miles. Having completed his review of t11e whole line arn~ come to conclusions favorah1e to the practicability of a triangulation across, Cnptain Simpson repaired to the office, and, after a personal conference, retuTned to Fernandina and proceeded to open the liues between the stations which he had selected as points for tTiangulation in order to test 'tho cost of cutting. The progress thus made will be seen by reference to Sketch No. 39. Stations were erected for the completion of four triangles, in which the conditions most desirable for accuracy were sought and obtained. The triangle sides average about six miles and a quarter in leugth. A. preliminary connection was made between tho series commenced and two stations in tho triangulation of Lieutenant A. W. Evans, U. S. A., on Cumberland sound. Captain Simpson carried his work southward and westward in the direction of Cedar Keys, and closed for the season on the 7th of ApTil at a station established on Dunn's creek, west of Nassau marsh, distant about thirteen miles from Fernandina. The timber growth encountered in opening the lines for observation consisted principally of pine and cypress, chiefly the former. An aggregate extent of fifty miles was prepared in the reconnais~ance by cutting, for the measurements subsequently made: Captain Simpson was aided throughout tho season by Thomas Baltzell, jr. and Mr. G. B. MaynadieT. Their promptitude and effectiveness in the disclrnrge of duty and thorough co-operation in all the interests connected with the work are highly commended in the report made by Captain Simpson at the close of the season. Captain Simpson acknowledges also the courtesies extended to him by Messrs. Finegan & Co., of the Florida railroad, and Mr. Daniel Callahan, contractor, in the assistance afforded to the party in transporting the camp l()quipage. The liberality of these gei:ttlemen in declining any charge for the services rendered merits this public expression of my thanks. Captain Simpson returned to the office at the end of April, and turned in the records of his triangulation, with a map and notes of the reconnaissance. His report describes minutely the character of that part of the Florida peninsula which falls within the limits of his operations. The extracts from it, given in Appendix No. 41, will be found interesting as bearing upon the local resources yet to bo developed by the projected connection between Fernandina and Cedar keys. The work of triangulation in the di1·ection of the last mentioned point is about to be resumed by Captain Simpson under the appropriation made by the last Congress.

triangulation parties, and three others engaged with the plane-table, kept the field during the periocl allotted for work at the soutlt. The party of Lieutenant A. H. Seward, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, reached its station in the schooner Graham on the 28th of December. Early in January the triangulation was resumed at Point Charles, and carried southward and westward to a station on Matecumbe key, ·where it joins with the work of Lieutenant J. C. Clark, whose operations will be next referred to in their geographical order. The series of triangles determined by Lieutenant' Seward includes stations on the outside shore of Key Largo, Dove key, Tavernier, Indian key, and Lower Matecumbe. Several of the beacon signals recently erected on the reef were also observed upon, in addition to others lying outside of the keys. The disttLnce between the limit8 of the work of this party, (Sketch No. 40,) executed during the present surveying year, is about twenty-five miles. Mr. C. B. Baker served as aid in the party, and his efforts in the discharge of duty are commended by Lieutenant Seward. Six repetitions were made in the measurement of each angle. The instrument used was the ten-inch Gambey th:eodolite C. S. No. 15.

Previous to the commencement of operations Lieutenant Seward completed and deposited at the office his journal in duplicate of the work of laet season, with sketches and descriptions of the stations then occupied. Since his mt.urn from this section he has turned in also the records of horizontal angles and descriptions of the signals observed on during the present year. The triangulation executed by Lieutenant Seward in 1856 has been reported upon from the Computing Division of the office as being satisfactory in connection with the work of.SubAssistants Rockwell and SuHivan of that <late. A very satisfactory agreement was also found on comparillg the computed lengths of the triangle sides as derived respectively from the preliminary bases at Key West and Bahia Honda. Lieutenant Seward has been tingaged during the summer in the triangulation of Hudson river under the direction of Assistant Edmund Blunt, and is under instructions to complete the connection of the Cape Sable and Key Biscayne bases. The records of ohservati(ms made in the course of the season's operations, together with the computed results of the tr~angulation of the Florida keys, have been received and deposited in the archives of the section. A second triangulation 1mrty, condncted by Lieutenant .J. C. Clark, U. S. A., assistant, in the Rchooner Bowditch, commenced a series of triangles on the 5th of January at Stirrup key, the eastern limit of previous work executed by Lieutenant Seward, and extended it northward and eastward over the Stirrup keys, Grassy key, Long key, and numeroufl small patches of keys between Eagle cove and Lower Matecumbe. At the locality last mentioned the series joins with the triangulation executed within the season by that officer. The connection is now

complete along the entire outer line of keys lying between Cape Florida and the Marquesas to the westward of Key West. Lieutenant Clark found the season generally unfavorable for observations. The extent embraced in the triangulation by his party iR nearly twenty-nine miles, the limits and details of which will be seen on Sketch No. 40. Mr. F. W. Alexander served as aid during the season. Twenty-five signals were observed upon in the measurement of s-eventy-five angles comprised in the series.

Some l'emarks extracted from his report, having reference to the local facilities for navigation afforded in the vicinity of Long key and Grassy key, are given in Appendix No. 42. The operations of the party were closed on the 22d of May, when Lieutenant Clark returned to the north, and the schooner Bowditch was laid up at New York. Arrangements are now nearly complete for work by this party on the Florida peninsula.

Topography ef Curnberland sound, and

ef St. Mary's and Amelia rivers, with their tributaries.-

On closing the plane-table work in the vicinity of New York bay at the end of the last surveying year, the party of Assistant A. M. Harrison proceeded in the schooner Benjamin Peirce to Fernandina, and commenced the topography of Cumberland sound, and its dependencies, on the 5th of December. The weather proved unusually stormy and inclement in that vicinity, but operations in the field were continued throughout the full season, and tenninated on the 5th of June. Four topographical sheets, containing the shore-line of numerous intricate water courses, tributary to Cumberland sound, were completed before the return of the party, and have since been put in ink and deposited in the archiveR of the office. The limits of these will be found severally marked on Sketch No. 31. First in order of execution, Assistant Harrison projected a sheet which includes the entrance of the sound and adjacent parts of Cumberland and Amelia islands, the entrance to St. Mary's river, part of Tiger island, and Amelia river from its mouth upwards to Kingsley's Cut. Other sheets, connecting with that just alluded to, extend the survey to a point three miles above, and including the town of St. Mary's, together with the shores of North river and Durrell' s creek, in Georgia. On the Florida side of the boundary, the same sheets embrace the whole of Bell's river, Jolly river, and Lanceford creek, with numerous intersecting branches of the first mentioned streams occurring on the upper part of Tiger island. · The towns of 01d and New Fernandina, the Atlantic terminus of the Florida railroad, are represented on the sheet which contains a part of Amelia island. The contents of the several sheets are stated in detail in the report of Assistant Harrison, extracts from which I have p~aced in the Appendix, (No. 40.) A tracing from the sheet first described was furnished by him at the request of the Florida railroad company. A1:1 preliminary to the opcratiom; of the party engaged under my immediate direction at Fernandina, Mr. Harrison also made an exam· 11 EB

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

ination, and submitted a plan, which met my approval, for connecting the astronomical station with the triangulation of Lieutenant .A. W. Evans executed in 1856. Having conducted the operations of his party in the field during' five months of the season, .Attsisfant Harrison returned north, in consequence of the condition of his health, in the early part of May, after which the plane-table work was continued by his principal aid, Mr. W. H. Dennis. Under the direction of .Assistant Harrison, a minute survey was made by him of the site proposed for a base line on Cumberland island. Four lines of levels were run in executing this duty. A strip, embracing a quarter of a mile in breadth, and extending throughout the entire length of the projected site, is represented on one of the topographical sheets. In refenmce to the services of Mr. Dennis, .Assistant Harrison remarks : ''The duties assigned t~him, of whatever kind, have been performed faithfully and promptly. He has cheerfully co-operated in the work, and has proved himself a valuable acquisition to the party." Mr. J. A. Da Costa also served as aid during the season, and his efforts in the prosecution of the work, which met many hindranccB in the unfavorable character of the winter and spring, are well spoken of by Assistant Harrison. The plarndable work included in the four sheets was completed by the 5th of June, at which time .l\fr. Dennis rejoined .Assistant Harrison with the schooner Peirce for topographical duty in the vicinity of Plymouth, Massachusetts, reference to which has been made under Section I. The following statement of statistics, contained in the report of .Assistant Harrison, is referable to the work executed in the vicinity of Fernandina and St. Mary's.

In reporting upon the work executed, . .Assistant Harrison expresses his obligations to Lieut. G. ·w. Custis Lee, U. S. Corps of Engineers, in charge of Fort Clinch, for assi8tance, and to Mr. Nightingale, of Cumberlarnl island, for courtesies extended to himself and party while employed in that vicinity. Topography ef the Plorida keys.-.A plane-table p_arty, additional to the two which have been regularly employed in the survey for the General Land Office, was organized at the close of the last year, and a corresponding advance has been made in the progress of the work undertaken. The party of Sub-Assistant S. A. Wainwright resumed operations on Key Largo on the 16th of January, and had fixed in place eighty section posts when the increase of Indian hostilities in the vicinity made it, in his opinion, inexpedient to carry on work beyond the immediate reach of the outer shore, his party being without means of defence. His party was therefore transferred to Point Charles, and commencing there with the plane-table, the outer shore-line of the key was traced to its southern extremity. The work executed falls within the triangula· tion carried on at the same time by Lieut. A. H. Seward, the details of which have been given

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

under their proper head. The outside shore-lines of Upper and Lower Matecumbe keys were also traced within the season. Including creeks and passage>; between the keys, and tbe outline of water courses intersecting the fast land of Key Largo, one hundred an<l twenty miles of shore-line, and six square miles of interior were surveyed by the party. The limits of the work are represented on Sketch No. 40. Thirty-seven of the quarter section posts put down were of iron, and forty-three of wood. They were all marked in the usual manner as being at the intersections, or intervening between the meridians and parallels. The points requisite for the plane-table work were furnished by Lieut. Seward. The surveying schooner J. W. Bailey was used for transportation by the party of Mr. Wainwright, and at the close of the season was laid up at Baltimore. Appendix No. 42 contains remarks bearing on the quality and value of the keys in the vicinity of Key Largo, extracted from the report of Sub-Assistant Wainwright. The work will shortly he resumed in that locality. The second party employed in the topography of the Florida keys was conducted, as iu the two previous surveying seasons, by Sub-Assistant C. T. lardella. His operations commenced on the 3d of January, and embraced the plane-table survey, and marking of a number of keys lying westward of Bahia Honda harbor. These fall principally within the triangulation completed by Sub-Assistants Rockwell and Sullivan.in 1856. Three plane-table sheets finished within the year, inked, and returned to the office by Sub-Assistant Iardella, present in detail the survey and subdivision of tho following named keys : Ramrod key, Big Torch, Little Torch, Big Pine, and No Name keys ; Newfound harbo1·; Litfle Pine key; Pye' s Harbor key; .Annette, B£g Spanish, Little Spanish, Crawl, H wc's, and !Jfayo' s key; the Johnson keys; Flat key; West Bahia Honda, an<l East Baltia Honda. Full details, in reference to the quality of soil and timber growth occurring on the keys just enumerated, are given in the report of Mr. Iardella, which I have placed in the Appendix, (No. 42.) The number and character of the quarter section posts put down for the General Land Office will also be found in his report. The surveying schooner Agassiz, which had been reassigned for the use of the party, arrived in the harbor of Key West at the usual time for resuming work at the outset of the season. Mr. S. J. Hough, attached to the party as aid, accompanied the vessel, but was seized with fever a few days after reaching port, and died on the 14th of December. He had served throughout the previous season in the party of Sub-Assistants Rockwell and Sullivau, in the triangulation of tho Florida keys in the vicinity of Key West, and during the former year in my own party in Section I. In these employments, u.nd as connected with tbe p·arty of Sub-Assistant. Iardella, his faithfulness in the discharge of duty had commended him to favorable notice. ~~e untimely loss of Mr. Hough was replaced by the assignment of Mr. G. U. Mayo, who Jmned the party in February, and continued in it until the close of the season. Notwithstanding the adverse circumstances which occasioned delay in commencing the work, the amount of detail presented in plane-table sheets j., beyond the average for the working season, and in its character and quality is highly creditable to the energy of Sub-Assistant Iardella. The statistics comprise one hundred and ninety miles of shore-line, within an area of thirty-one square miles. Operations were discontinued for the season on the 3d of May, when the schooner Agassiz was transferred to the north and laid up at Baltimore. After inking his sheets of work executed in this section Sub-Assistant lardclla was assigned totopograp h" ' ical duty on the shores of Cai:ico bay, and made the survey described under t h at

title in Section I. His preparations are now in progress for an early return, to resume work on the Florida keys. The additional party detailed for service in this section was ent'rusted to Mr. F. W. Dorr, vthot<c experience in the field, under tho direction of Assistant H. L. Whiting, had qualified him to conduct its opcrntions. Mr. Dorr reached Key \Vest on the 10th of January, and in the following week joined the surveying schooner Dana, which had been assigned for the trans~ portation of his stores and imitrumentl'\. His topographical Rheets compriRe surveys made in three separate localities, which will be noticed in the usual geographical order. Points within the triangulation of Lieutenant Clark having been furnished by that officer, Mr. Dorr took up and completed the survey of Key V acas, referring the junction of his sheet to the limit reached by Assistant I. Hull Adams in a former year. His work in that vicinity was carried eastward, and includes Boot key, the Stirrup keys, Fat Deer key, Bamboo key, and a number of small intervening patches. Remarks concerning the relative positions and character of the several keys, included in the sheet now under notice, will be found in Appendix No. 42, which contains extracts from Mr. Dorr' s report upon the work of the season. The location of the sheet is eastward of Bahia Honda liarbor, and wholly within the triangulation of Lieutenant Clark, already mentioned under this section. A second sheet wa:;: projected, to include the ummrveyed keys lying northward and westward, and immediately adjacent to the work of Sub-Assistant Iardella. Mr. Dorr's sheet of that vicinity comprises the topography of Burnt key, Knock' em down key, Budd key, JJJi"chail' s key, Raccoon key, the Water keys, the Eastern and TfTestern Content keys, and Harbor key, together with numerous smaller ones not distinguished from each other by local names. The report of Mr. Dorr, (in Appendix No. 42,) will be found to contain information relative to the size and surface peculiarities of the keys included in this sheet. All the firm land embraced in his surveys was subdivided into quarter sections. The first sheet represents the positions of sixty· seven, and that last mentioned of eighty-nine quarter section stakes, which were placed in the progress of his work at the intersections of the meridians and parallels, and marked, respectively, M. P. or MP. An attempt was made, at the outset of the season, to commence the topography of Cape Sable, but the presence of hostile Indians at the extremity of the Florida peninsula made it expedient to defer that work until the advance of spring. Mr. Dorr began, in the middle of March, a plane-table sheet, to include the base at Cape Sable, and the extremity of the peninsula southward of a line joining Northwest cape and the "Upper Crossing," opposite to the Oyster keys. His survey in this neighborhood requiring a second slieet, the shore-line between Palm Point and Northwest cape was traced and repre· sented on it. Sandy key, lying southward' and eastward of Cape Sable, is included in the topographical work executed in this vicinity. Fifty-two quarter section stakes "Yere placed and marked for th(<. purposes of the General Land Office, with letters to designate their location on the meridians or parallels. The limits of the four topographical sheets returned to the office by Mr. Dorr are represented on Sketch No. 40. His operations were discontinued for the season on the 16th of May. The local features of that part of the peninsula of Florida over which his work extended are given in Appendix No. 42. Mr. Dorr' s report contains the following summary of statistics, derived from the several plane table surveys completed by him in this section :

Dorr was assigned to Juty in the vicinity of :Kew York. Preparations are now in progress for his return to prosecute the survey, and marking of the Florida keys, in conjunction with the party which has been heretofore engaged in that service. The Commissioner of the General Land Office has lJeen furnished with copies, in triplicate, of the sheets completed within tho season by Sub-Assistant Ianle1la and Mr. Dorr. My report addressed to him, and extracts from the field reports, giving the details of progress made in the s.urvey within the present year, will be found in .Appendix, {No. 42.) Hydroqraphy of St. Mary's ba,r, and of the entrance to Cumbe,rland sound.-.A very careful re-examination has been made of the soundings executed last season Ly the party of Lieut. Comg. 8. D. Trenchard, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey. Some of tho lines rnn in the present year extend over the localities included in last season's operations, and no change was found in the comparison made. 'l'he bar seems, however, to have deepened slightly, and the change detected there is thus referred to in the report of Lieut. Oomg. Trenchard : "The thirteen and a half feet ridge, which extended across the channel, now appears broken, forming a middle ground, with a channel of over fourteen feet on either side.'' His recommendation, that, a buoy be placed on tho middle ground referred to, has been communicated, through the Department, to the Light-house Board, (.Appendix Xo. 64.) '' In the prosecution of the work the lines of soundings were carefully verified, every precaution being taken to develop the line of best w:i,ter, by making the soundings as clo8e as possible. The positions of the lmo.ys wore determined and laid down on the chart. The bar has been sounded out, in company with the St.·Tohn' s pi1ots, on two separate occasions, and the result shows no depth greater than that assigned by our present survey. The soundings were mostly made in boats during very light winds or calm weather, between the 21st of February and the 11th of March." .Additional soundings were also made in Cumberland sound and at the entrance of the St. Mary's river; the operations of the party in the surveying schooner Gallatin having commenced there early in January. The hydrography 0f .Amelia river and its tributaries and Fernandina harbor was also completed within the season. Tho limit to which the work was carried seaward from the entrance into Cumlierland sound will be seen by reference to Sketch No. 31. In connection with the hydrography of the bar, the tide register at the entrance was observed every five minutes. From the 10th to the 17th of April simultaneous observations were made at the bar and at Fort Clinch with reference to the intervals between the times of high water. The result of the comparison made is thus stated by Lieut. Comg. Trenchard : "Time of low water at Fort Clinch, thirty-one minutes later than at St. Mary's bar." "Mean duration of slack water (ebb) at !fort Clinch, :fifteen minutes." '' Greatest difference between times of low water at Fort Clinch and bar, one hour ; least, ten minutes.'' "The observations were made during favorable weather, and the tide, during their continuance, was not influenced by wind.'' Simultaneous observations were also made between the 17th and 20th of June, at the bar and

at Fort Clinch, for the purpose of detecting any difference which might exist m the rise and fall. Comparisons made of the record:,; by Lieut. Comg. 'frenchard sho-..v-ed no appreciable difference between the respective heights of the water at the two stations. The gauge used at the bar was placed just within the entrance buoy. The shore-line requisite for the hydrography of A.melia river was furnished by Assist>Lnt A. M. Harrison. I have communicated, in the usual form, to the Light-house Board the recommendati~n of Lieut. Comg. Trenchard, for replacing the entrance buoy at St. Mary's by one of the first class.-(Appendix No. 63.) While the schooner Gallatin was at anchor near the northern point of Amelia island, in February, she was driven on shore by the swell and northeast wind, ·the ring of the anchor g1vmg way. Fortunately tho vessel sustained no injury, and with the" valuable assif?tance rendered by Lieut. G. '\V. Custis Lee, 'C nited States Corps of EHgineen;, in charge of Fort Clinch, and by others, Lieut. Comg. Trenchard was enabled to get her afloat by the 25th, and resume the regular work of the season. The bydrographic sheets of the ·St. Mary's bar, entrance to Cumberland sound and Fernandina harbor, containing the work of the present season, have been received and filed ·with the archives of the office. Lieut. Comg. Trenchard returns the following report of statistics:

.A. comparative chart has been prepared showing tho results of the successive surveys made at the St. ~Iary' s entrance by the party of Lieut. Corng. Trenchard. Ten volumes, containing the original records of soundings, angles, and tidal observations connected with the work, have been depmiited in the office. Supplementary hydrography at the enfrance of St. John's river, Fla.-After completing the work last noticed, Lieut. Corng. Trenchard commenced, on the 21st of May, a resurvey of the bar of St. John's river, and extended the hydrography seaward, and from the entrance upward to a junction above Mayport Mills, with his work of 1855. This resurvey was made by request and at the cost of the Engineer Department. Soundings were carried southward to a line abreast of St. John's flag; northward to Talbot island, and a mile within Fort George inlet. The following is an extract from the report of Lieut. Comg. Trenchard : ''The sound· ings on t.he bar have been made with great care, and as close as it was possible to plot them. The least depth on the bar at mean low water, running the pilot's line in, is eight and a half feet.'' Observations wore made with reference to the tides and currents in connection with the hydrography. The work was completed on t.he 13th of June, and the results are shown in t.he following statistics :

established, three hundred and thirty-seven high waters were observed, and three hundred and twenty-eight low waters recorded. The chart of the entrance to St. John's river has been completed and deposited in the office. Lieut. Coing. Trenchard returned from thiR section at the close of June, and, after refitting the Gallatin at New York, engaged in the hydrography of Casco ba:·, in the vicinity of Portland. His chart of St. John's river entrance is now in the office. Hydrograpliy ef Florida Reefs.-This work was continued by the party of Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in the steamer Corwin. Tho vessel left New York on the 25th of January, and commenced the operations of the season on the 7th of February, at a line extending southward and eastward from East Bahia Honda. The hydrographic sheet falls chiefly within the limits of the topographical survey made within the season by Suh-Assistant C. T. Iardella. Soundings were extended to a distance of ratlrnT more than nine miles in a direction generally southward from the line of outer keys. The limit reached in a westerly range is beyond Loggerhead Key, nearly seventeen miles and a half from East RLhia Honda. A. sheet previously executed there joins with the work now under notice. While engaged in tho regular hydrographic work on the reef, Lieut. Comg. Craven ran a line of soundings, in connection with observations for temperatures, between Hav;ma and Key West, the results of which have boon referred to under tl10 head Gulf Stream.

The operations were brought to a close on the 15th of May. Two hydrographic sheets of work, previously executed by the party, have been plotted within the year and deposited in the archives. In order to save tlie time of the triangulation and topographical parties engaged on the keys, in passages to and from Key West for supplies of wood and water, an arrangement was made with Lieut. Comg. Craven, and the requisites were regularly furnished to them by the Sophia, the tender of the hydrographic party. 'l'ho recommendation of Lieut. Oomg. Craven, for the erection of a permanent beacon on Looe Key, (Appendix No. 65,) was communicated to the department for transmi~sion to the Light-house Board. Lieut. Comg. Craven was detached from Coast Survey duty shortly after his return from this section. The loss of his services is one of the most severe of those which the survev has had to sustain during the past year. His natural qualities as a hydrographer hav.e ?een ripened by a large experience, and there is no part of his profession in which he is at fault. In the regular routine of sounding, and in the more difficult and delicate investigations of the Gulf stream, and of tides and currents, he is equally at home. His industr)', perseverance and zeal are not to be surpassed, and have rendered succei;;sful in hiR hand,; tho difficult exploration of the Gulf Stream, tho soundings of the Florida reefs and coast, Ahrnys and tho minute hydrography of New York bay and harbor and its approaches. prompt himself, he has inBpired the officers of his party with his own zeal, and haf' thus always had around him cheerful and active co-laborers. The selection of this officer to conduct the exploration of the Atrato route for an interoceanic canal removes him to a higher field of duty,

and is a just reward for the faithfulness and efficiency of his 1:1ervice in the Coast Survev. Lieutenant Craven was replaced, as chief of a hydrographic party, by the assignment of Lieut. Comg. W. G. Temple. New boilers were provided for the steamer Corwin during the summer, and have been put in place since the return of the vessel from service in Casco bay. The arrangements of the party are now in progress for resuming the bydrographic work on Florida reef. Tidal observations.-The self-registering tide-gauge at, Fort Clinch was kept in succe'ssful operation during the season as a perm~nent station. Observations of short period for hydrographic purposes were made at New Fernandina, Fla., at the outer bar of the St. Mary's river, and also in the St. John's river, at PilotB' wharf, and Mayport mills. Four self-registering tide-gauges were established by Mr. Gustavus Wiirdemann on the Florilla keys, viz : at Cape Florida, Indian Key, Key West, and Tortugas. These are still in operation under Mr. W iirdemann' s supervision.

SECTION VII.
FROM ST. JOSEPH'S BAY TO MOBILE BAY, INCLUDING PART OF THE COAST OF FLORIDA AND ALABAMA. (SKl!rrcH G, No. H.)

This is only the third year for which we have had an appropriation for this section of the coast. The same number of parties has been regularly employed as last year, namely, two in triangulation, two in topography, and one in hydrography ; besides which, the occasional ser· vices of another have been had in triangulating and measuring a preliminary base. Being still cramped in regard to means, each of two of the vessels for transportation were necessarily assigned to two parties, in a degree retarding the progress of the separate operations. The season has not been altogether favorable; but, as the parties were early in the field, the amount of work haR been greater than that of last year. The localities of survey have been Pensacola and itR approacheR; St. George's sound and the approaches to .Apalachicola and Waccasassa bay. We Rhould have a combined triangulation and plane-table party to keep up the extension of the work begun at St . .Andrew's bay. The details of the several operations in these localities will now be given. The following drawings have been completed: Waccasassa bay, 50 {;-00 ; St. Mark's river, -3-0 ~voi addition to St . .Andrew's bay, 40 l 00 · The engraving of .Apalachicola river entrance is in progress. Triampdation of WaccaBassa bay, ea.st of Cedar keys, Fla.-There being no vessels disposable for the transportation of two separate parties, and the state of progress and the nature of the work permitting the triangulation and topography to go on together without material inconvenience, the two operations were joined under the direction of Sub-Assistant G. H. Bagwell and Mr. N. S. Finney, and the schooner Joseph Henry was assigned to the united parties. Various delays occurred which prevented the vessel from reaching Cedar keys until late in January. During February and March the weather proved very unfavorable for field opera· tions, but Mr. Bagwell succeeded in making the reconnaissance required for the triangulation and in determining a sufficient number of points to keep the plane-table party at work. Beginning at Grassy Point, (see Sketch G,) Sub-Assistant Bagwell re-occupied several of the stations erected in the previous season by Sub-Assistant B. Huger, jr., and carried a series of triangles southward and eastward along the main on the eastern side of Wac~asassa bay to the

entrance of W e-thlocco-chee river, and thence in the same general direction to Shell Point, beyond the entrance to Crystal river. It was found imprac.:ticable to make connections in the chain of triangles by stations on the peninsula, in consequence of the difficulty of access to the c;hore. ''Throughout the season much delay was occasioned by the necessity of being far removed in the vessel from the ground of operations, and the impossibility of reaching many of the points, even in small boats, except at high water." To the extract just quoted from his report, Sub-Assistant Bagwell adds: ''The country over which the work extends consists chiefly of low marsh, overflowed at ordinary high tide, shifting bars, and shell reefs, from one to three mileR distant from the main shore. "Operations were closed on the 27th of May, and the Btatistic::; of the work executed up to that time are as follows : "Stations established · · · .. · ..........·.·... ·. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 ''Stations occupied ...... · · ........... - ..·.·.·.................. 14 "Number of signals determined................................... 18 ''Number of angles measured ·. · · ..· · ..... · .. · · · .. · · · · · ·. · · .·· · ·. · 89 ''Number of single observations· · ·.... · · .. · . · · . · .. · . · .......... · . · 3, 096 ''.Area of triangulation in square miles · · · · · · · · · · · . · · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 89 ''Eight sets of observations, .of six repetitions each, were made to each angle, the sets being observed forward and backward alternately, beginning with new readings of the instrument." ''The station points were well secured with screw piles and granite blocks, the former being used in every case where the soil was loose, as on the Teefs, or liable to change." Mr. N. S. Finney, in charge of the topographical party, co-operated in the triangulation work executed. Sub-Assistant Bagwell haR been occupied during the summer in the party of ARsiBtant Edmund Blunt, engaged in the triangulation of HndBon river, and will shortly return to continue the work in the vicinity of Crystal river, Florida. Triangulation of Apalachicola harbor and we.stern pad of St. George' 8 sound, Florida.-This triangulation was continued by Sub-Assistant S. C. McCorkle, who had charge of it during the previom; year. The schooner Belle, a~signed to his party for transportation, was lost in passing along the coast from Pascagoula upon a shoal not laid down upon any chart, in the vicinity of Crooked island, near St. .Andrew's bay, retarding the commencement of work, and requiring the party to find transportation in the schooner Franklin during the former part of the surveying season. The schooner Belle was so old, being one of those turned over by the Quartermaster's Department at the close of the Mexican war, that she was soon broken up after grounding. The crew were unharmed, and the instruments and equipments were landed safely. In consequence of this delay Sub-Assistant McCorkle was unable to commence observations until the 26th of December. He had previously visited the stations occupied in the preceding season and replaced the signals, then erected, which had been nearly all blown down by the gale of August, 1856. Some difficulty was experienced also in obtaining materials for signals, the pine timber bordering the coast having been, in great measure, destroyed by the action of salt water. · Mr. McCorkle reports in reference to the condition of the station points themselves : ''They were generally found in a good state of preservation, Some, requiring additional security,

were attended to as far as practicable. The water, during the prevalence of a gale, rises as much as ten feet, and washes away the ground in some places fifteen or twenty, rendering the positions used in this vicinity very uncertain, and no ordinary precautions will answer for maintaining permanence in the stations." The distance of the triangulation points in advance of the topography making it inconvenient to work from the vessel of the topographical party, vessel was hired on the 1st of Mar«h for the remainder of the season, the party being discharged at the close of May. ' The triangulation was resumed at Cat Point station, on Godley's Bluff, and carried directly westward over East bay, .Apalachicola harbor, and St. Vincent's sound and island to the western outlet of the sound at Indian Pass. Signals used in the triangulation were erected on St. George's and St. Vincent's islands. From the position first occupied the work was also pushed eastward through St. George's sound to a line connecting the station adjacent to Turkey Point with the eastern end of Dog island. "The season proved very unfavorable; December and January were fair working months, but the extreme cold weather towards the end of that period greatly retarded field operations j during February and March it was almost impossible' to carry on the work in consequence of fogs and smoke, except at very brief intervals." Sketch No. 44 presents a scheme of the triangulation executed. Nineteen tripod signals and five of the ordinary kind were erected by the party during the season, eighteen stations were occupied and seventy-six angles determined with the six-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 55. One thousand six hundred and eight observations were made in the measurement of angles. Mr. Eliab H. Wells was attached to the party as aid, and his aptitude and zeal in the discharge of duty are referred to in terms of praise by Sub-Assistant J\foCorklc. The necessary computations and duplicates of the field records were made after the return of the party and the vo}u:qles containing them have been placed in the office. Sub-Assistant :McCorkle thus refers to the local resources of that part of the coast of Florida included in the range of work : ''In my opinion the channel of .Apalachicola river can be deepened without great cost, and when done it will open to the country one of the most valuable timber ports to be found on the coast. The shores of the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers abound with timber equal to any in the world." ''During the present season more than eighty thousand bales of cotton have been shipped from this port." .Arrangements will be made with .a view of executing, if practicable, the hydrography of .Apalachicola harbor early in the season now commencing. TriangUlation qf Pen.~acola harbor, Florida.-This work has been continued by the party of .Assistant F. H. Gerdes, by a reconnaissance for the main series of triangles. Several stations were occupied for the secondary triangulation of Escambia bay, and the angles formed at Gan;on Point, Red Bluff, and Emanuel Point, with stations selected for the main and secondary work, were measured. The early part of the season was occupied by Assistant Gerdes in the measurement of a preliminary base, at Cedar keys, to be connected with the triangulation executed by Sub.Assistant G. H. Bagwell, reference to which has already been made. The statistics of the work near Pensacola are as follows :

In the course of the summer he completed a duplicate of the observations made, and descriptions of signals used, in the work at Pensacola. These, together with his computation of the results of the triangulation, have been placed in the atchives. Topography of the eastern slwre if Waccasassa bay, Florida.-This was executed by Mr. N. S. Finney, whose party, as already stated, was united with that of Sub.Assistant Bagwell, in charge of the triangulation. The plane-table sheets are connected with those made a year ago by Assistant Harrison. "The topography executed embraces all the shore-line, outline of forest, islands, shell-bank, hammocks, and details of every description, lying between the W acca.<1assa and W ethlocco-chee rivers, excepting a few small islands and shell reefs near the mouth of the last named river, which the time appointed for closing work did not admit of including. The sheets included W e-thlocco-chce and Mangrove bays, Turtle creek, and W accasassa river as far up as the head of steamboat navigation, or three miles from its mouth.'' "The Waccasassa reefs were also surveyed, and the shore· line of the Gulf was traced to the distance of two miles northward of the entrance to Waccasassa river." In connection with the work assigned to Mr. Finney, he assisted in the erection of signals for the triangulation, in reconnaissance for stations, and the measurement made by Assistant F. H. Gerdes of the preliminary ba'Se at Cedar Keys. The following are statistics of the plane-table work, which was discontinued on the 26th of May: Miles of shore-line surveyed ................... - ... - .... ·. . . . . . . . . . . . 151 Miles of forest outline . . . . . ...... · ..... · . . . · . . . . . . . . . ...... · . . . . . . . . 10 Sub-Assistant Bagwell furnished ..the points requisite for topographical purposes, and cooperated thoroughly in the duties jointly assigned to the parties. The following extract from Mr. Finney's report refers to the tract included between the W accasassa and W e-thlocco-chee rivers : ''The character of the country is such that I was obliged to dispense with the chain altogether, and carry on the work entirely by intersections; the surface being soft and broken marsh, very much cut up and traversed by innumerable small creeks and bayous. As a matter of necessity, the plane-table and instruments were transferred from station to station in the boat. There was great difficulty also in finding stations sufficiently firm, and, in consequence, most of those occupied were in water from one to three feet deep." A~ter inking and depositing his sheets in the office, Mr. Finn~y was assigned to duty in Section III. In conjunction with the party of Sub-Assistant Bagwell, Lis preparations are now well advanced for resuming work, in continuation of that of last season, in the vicinity of Crystal river-, Florida. -

Topography ef St. George' 8 sound, induding tlze slwres ef Apalachicola harbor, Fum'da.-As part of the duty assigned to Assistant Geo. D. Wise in the preceding year, some progress had been made in the survey of the Rhores of St. George's sound, as noticed in my last annual

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

report. His party arrived at Apalachicola on the 29th of November, and, before closing for the t<eaimn, executed the topography of the delta of the Apalachic6la, the shores of St. George's wund, including Apalachicola bay, and the greater part of St. Vincent's sound. The planetablc i'Urvey of the vicinity is now complete from Indian Pass, east·ward, through St. George'8 sound, to Dog Island light-house, a distance of about forty miles. The schooner Franklin was used by the party of Assistant Wise for transportation,·,and, during two months at the commencement of the season, by the party of Sub-Assistant S. 0. McCorkle also. Mr. Wise thus reports the statistics of l1is work, the sheets of which have been inked and turned into the office : Shore-line surveyed· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · . · . · .. · ... · ......... : . . . . 170 miles.

''Most of the season was unfavorable for topographical work on account of high winds and the unusual degree of cold. Thick fogs also prevailed for weeks at a time." By request, ARsistant Wise made preliminary soundings on the bar, and furnished E. K. Dodge, esq., a map of the mouth of Apalachicola river. On the 23d of }fay the operations of the party were closed, and the vessel laid up m Apalachicola river. The report of Assistant Wise contains the following remarks on the commercial facilities of .;_\palachicola: ''The town is of considerable importance, shipping yearly some ninety thousand bales of cotton. Its trade is principally with New York and Liverpool. Semi-monthly lines of steamers run to New Orleans and Key West, and there is almost daily communication with the interior by the river boats as far as Columbus, Ga., a distance of three hundred and eighty miles.'' ''It is very desirable for the future prosperity of Apalachicola that the bar at the mouth of the river, which prevents vessels drawing over five feet from coming to the wharves, should be removed. As the distance requiring dredging is short, this could be done at small expense. The bar has been formed by deposits from the river, and it is of very light material." Assistant Wise was employed during the summer in office-work. Mr. F. F. Nes served as aid in the topographical party througl10ut the season. Three plane-table sheets, resulting from the work in Apalachicola bay and St. George's sound, have been inked, and registered with the archives of the section. Hydrography of Waccasassa bay, Florida.-Supplementary soundings for the chart of Waccasassa bay were made during the season by the party of Lieut. Comg. J. K. Duer, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey. The eastern limit of the work, as will be seen by reference to Sketch No. 44, is about ten miles due south of W accasassa Point. From this line the hydrography was continued westward to a junction with the'" work of last year. The duty assigned to the hydrographic party included Pensacola harbor as well as this locality. The supplementary soundings eastward of Cedar keys were commenced on the 23d of March. The hydrography was continued from that date, with no interru:[)tions excepting from bad weather, until the 15th of April, when the hydrography already described was finished, and operations were resumed in Pensacola bay.

Hydrography of Pensacola ba,y entrance and approaches.-Tbe party of Lieut. Comg. Duer sailed from New York in the surveying schooner Varina on the 8th of November, and commenced the hydrography of Pensacola bay and its approaches early in the following month. Many hindrances and interruptions were experienced in the general prevalence of fogs and easterly storms throughout the season. By a diligent use, however, of the means afforded in intervals of good weather, satisfactory progress has been made. The sheet projected for Pensacola bay is now in the office. It contains eoundings from Santa Rosa island northward and eastward as far up the bay as Emanuel Point, and the hydrography of the approaches in a direction southward and westward to a limit about eight miles outside of tho entrance. The work hero was closed on the 11th of May.

On the southern passage from New York, at the outset of the season, the schooner Varina touched at New Providence, and at the request of the United States vice consul at Nassau Lieut. Comg. Duer received on board his vessel the crew and steerage passengers of the American ship Julia Howard, which had been, a short time previous to his arrival, lost on the Bahama banks. No provision existing at the consulates to meet such cases, the destitute passengers, and. such of the crew as desired it, were taken in the Varina to Pensacola. The correspondence relative to the action of Lieut. Comg. Duer is given in Appendix No. 54. In February Lieut. Comg. Duer was applied to for assistance by the consignees of the schooner Georgia, stranded some days previously about thirty miles from Pensacola. The party proceeded in the Varina to the wreck, and united in the efforts made to relieve her, but these proved unavailing without the employment of means inconsistent with the duties of the season. While the hydrographic work at Pensacola was in progress a fire occurred at Fort Pickens ; the officers and crew· of the Varina promptly co-operated in tho measures taken to stop the destruction of property, and the service so rendered by the party was acknowledged in a communication addressed to Lieut. Comg. Duer by Captain John N ewtob, of the Corps of Engineers, commanding the harbor. The schooner Varina, shortly after her return to New York at the close of the season, was Uimporarily exchanged with the Navy Department for the steamer Arctic.

REPORT OP THE SUPERINTE1'<"1:>ENT OF

SECTION VIII.
FROM MOBILE BAY TO VERMILION BAY, INCLUDING THE CO.AST OF MISSISSIPPI AND P.ART OF LOUISIANA. (SKETCH H, No. 47.)

The same number of parties has been employed in this section as during the previous year, and with the same organization. It has been found quite economical to connect the operations for topography and triangulation in one party, under the circumstances of ground and climate in the section. There are two parties thus organized, and a third topographical party is required to keep the topography up with the triangulation. The hydrographic party in a steam vessel nearly keeps pace with the land work. The triangulation of the section is quite half done, the topography and hydrography more than one-third. .At the present rate of progress six or seven years will complete the triangulation of this section, and the topography and hydrography will be but a few years behind the triangulation. The work of this season has included1. Longitude determinations by telegraph between Montgomery, Alabama, and Mobile, with latitude and magnetic observations connected w-ith them. 2. Secondary triangulation and magnetic observations on the coast of Louisiana. 3. Marking of the terminus of tlauphine island base. 4. Reconnaissance and triangulation of the Mississippi delta. 5. Measurement of a preliminary base at Pt. au Chevreuil, and triangulation of Cote Blanche bay, Louisiana. 6. Topography of the shores of Lake Borgne. 7. Topography of the main and islands of Chandeleur sound. 8. Topography of Cote Blanche bay, Louisiana. 9. Hydrography of Mississippi and Chanileleur sound. 10. Deep-sea soundings of the Gulf of Mexico. The necessary details in reference to these operations are given m this chapter. 'fhe progress has been entirely satisfactory, taking into view the means furnished. ~e work in the office has consisted of the computation of the field-work; of drawings of Mississippi City harbor, St. Louis bay, and Grand island Pass, and Pearl river entrance ; the drawing of the coast chart of Mississippi sound, from Round island to Grand island, and chart from Cat island to Lake Pontchartrain, has been in progress ; the chart of part of the coast of .Alabama and Mississippi has been engraved, and the chart of :Mississippi sound, Nos. 1 and 2, and Biloxi bay, (as a finished map,) are now in progress. The rough chart of the Gulf of Mexico, between the mouth of the Mississippi and Key West, which accompanies this rep-0rt, gives a capital general idea of the form and character of the bottom in this great bay. The curves show the extent of the gentle slope from the shores to the abrupt descent to a great depth, and the shading shows the material of which the bottom is composed, the mud, the sand, the m·d and sand, and, towards the Florida keys, the coral. This map, with its sections, when completed, will give a full idea of the physicail geography of this portion of the Gulf. A line run from the entrance of Matagorda bay, (Section IX,) nearly at right angles to the general direction of the coast, about fifty nautical miles in length, shows a gradual slope to sixty-eight fathoms, the depth at its extremity. We were disappointed in the expectation of being able to complete the telegraph work

between Washington and New Orleans last season, as the state of the lines required u,,; to make an intermediate point between Montgomery and Mobile. The connection between Mobile and New Orleans only remains to be made to finish this longitude line, unsurpassed, for length, in any part of the world, between Calais, in Maine, and New Orlean:-;, in Louisiana. Longit,ude determinat~'ons by Tekgraph, between ffiontgomery and Mobile, Ala. Astronomical observations.-The chain of telegraphic longitudes between Washington and New Orleans has this season been extended to Mobile, by tho party of Dr. B. A. Gould, jr., as(>istant, the operations of which were, as heretofore, conducted by Assistant G. W. Dean. We expected certainly to have reached New Orleans this season, but the state of the telegraph lines has prevented it. Arrangements for longitude experiments were completed early in November, and Sub.Assistant Edward Goodfellow proceeded to Mobile in charge of the party and instruments; Mr. Dean then passing on to New Orleans, for the purpose of erecting a suitable observatory upon the site selected by Dr. Gould last season for determining the longitude of that city. Having accomplished this duty, Assistant Dean took cha~ of the telegraph station at Montgomery on the 1st of December. The astronomical instruments were adjusted in position, and the telegraph apparatus placed in good working order for finding the difference of longitude between Montgomery and Mobile. On the 7th of that month efforts were made, but without success, to exchange signals between the two cities without the use of the repeater at Lower Peach Tree, which, however efficient for ordinary messages, destroys the accuracy of the longitude determination. Between December and the following March a large number of experiments were made with different arrangements of the batteries, but the imperfect insulation and connections of the line at that time could not be overcome. The reports of Mr. Dean satisfied me that the experiment8 had been conducted with care and good judgment, and accordingly in March I directed him to establish an intermediate station at Lower Peach Tree, near the Alabama river, in order to complete the work to Mobile before the close of the season. The instruments at Mobile in charge of Mr. Goodfellow were transferred to Lower Peach Tree about the middle of }larch, and from that date until the 11th of June the observations advanced rapidly to completion. At Montgomery six hundred and seventy-five observations were made upon one hundred and sixty.five stars, with the C. S. transit No. 6, for determining the clock error, azimuth and collimation corrections to the transit instrument. One hundred observations were made upon eighteen well ascertained circumpolar stars, for thread intervals, and the inequalities of the transit pivots were determined with the riding level of the instrument, by the usual method. At Lower Peach Tree station four hundred and ninety-six observations were made upon one hundred and fourteen stars, with the C. S. transit No. 8, for clock and instrumental corrections. For thread intervals fifty-three observations were made upon eighteen circumpolar stars, at upper and lower culminations. The inequalities of the transit pivots were determined in the usual manner. The latitude of the station at Lower Peach Tree was determined bv Sub-Assistant Goodfellow, from ninety-five observations upon twenty-two pairs of tStan;, with the zenith telescope C. S. No. 5. At Mobile eight hundred and ten observations were made with transits Nos. 6 and 8, for time and instrumental corrections. The thread intervals were determined by one hundred and

96

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

twelve observations, upon twenty-four circumpolar stars, and one hundred stars were observed on for the personal equation between Mr. Dean and Mr. Goodfellow." The latitude of the Mobile station was determined by Sub-Assistant Goodfellow, from two hundred and fifty-seven observations, upon forty-three sets of stars, with zenith telescope C. S. No. 5. The value of the micrometer was obtained from ninety ob~ervations upon Polaris, near its western elongation, and the level divisions were determined from observations upon a collimator. In the determination of difference of longitude between Montgomery and Lower Peach Tree, signals were exchanged on eight different nights, the observers changing places after four successful nights' opservations, for the purpose of eliminating the effect of personal equation. Two hundred and twenty-two stars were used for the telegraphic observations. The difference of longitude between Peach Tree station and Mobile was obtained by exchanging signals upou two hundred and thirty stars, on seven nights, the observers replacing each other after four succeBsful nights, as in the previous campaign. Assistant Dean acknowledges his particular obligations to Brevet Major P. G. T. Beauregard, Corps of United States Engineers, and J. N. Jennings, esq., of New Orleans, for aid rendered in the erection of an astronomical station in that city. The officers connected with the telegraph line over which the experiments were made, in the past season, extended all the facilities for working in their power, and the courtesies of Mr. J. C. Butler, superintendent of the line, are especially acknowledged in the reports of the assistants who conducted the operations. Magnetic obs;;.vati.ons.-At Lower Peach Tree, Ala., the magnetic clements were determined by Assistant G. W. Dean, while the operations for telegraphic longitudes were in progress; one hundred and twenty-five observations were made for variation on three different days with declinometer No. 22, by Jones, (C. S. No. l ;) two sets for horizontal intensity and moment of inertia, on two days; and two sets for dip, with the ten-inch Barrow dip-circle, (C. S. No. 4-.) Magnetic determinations were also made by Sub-Assistant Edward _Goodfellow, in the public square at :Mobile, consisting of one hundred and eighty observations, on four days, for varia· tion ; three sets for horizontal intensity and moment of inertia, on three days ; and four sets for dip, with the same instruments used at Lower Peach Tree. A meridian line was traced in the public square, and permanently marked, by Sub-Assistant Goodfellow, with marble monuments furnished by the city authorities of Mobile, at whose request the line was established. The meterological conditions of the atmosphere were recorded in connection with the various observations made at the longitude and magnetic stations. Messrs. Julius Kincheloe and McLane Tilton served M aids in the longitude parties, and rendered valuable assistance in the operations of the season. The volumes c011taining the registers of observations, and computations of the places of stars used, have been recei"·ed from Assistant Dean. Sub-Assistant Goodfellow has completed and sent to the office, together with the original record, a dUJJlicate of the latitude observations made at Mobile, and the computation derived from the rlata contained in them. Since tho close of .operations in this section at the approach of summer, Assistant Dean and Sub-Assistant Goodfellow have been engaged with my party in Section I. Under favorable circumstances, it is hoped that the arrangements already made for prosecuting the telegraphic work in the coming sea5on will enable the parties to complete the

TIIE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEl'

observations necessary on the line connecting Mobile and New Orleans, and thus complete the longitude connection of Washington and New Orleans. Secondary triangUlation on the western shore of Gliandeleitr sound, La.-This work, in connection with the primary triangulation of Mississippi sound, has been advanced westward by the party under the direction of Assistant J. E. Hilgard. The attention of Assistant Hilgard being required at the office in the arrangement of details for the volumes of Records and Results, the operations of his party were executed by SubAssistant Stephen Harris, aided by Mr. R. E. Halter, and during part of the season by Mr. J. S. Harris. Beginning at the opening of t.tie se~n at the stations Cat island and Cat Island light, (see Sketch No. 47,) the work was extended southward, and now joins at Freemason's key the triangulation of the Chandeleur islands. In the prosecution of the secondary triangulation, one hundred and five angles were measured at eighteen stations, by six hundred and fifty-two sets of observations of six repetitions each, with the ten-inch theodolite, C. S. No. 79, and six-inch No. 84. The area covered by the triangulation is two hundred and fifty square miles. The surveying schooner Twilight was in the service of the party of Assistant Hilgard for transportation throughout the season. Before proceeding to Chandeleur sound, Sub-Assistant Harris made a local triangulation in Mobile to connect the telegraphic longitude station with the spire of the Episcopal church in that city, one of the points in the main triangulation of this section. Originals and duplicates of the observations recorded, in the primary and secondary triangulation of Mississippi sound and Lake Borgne, in 1855, together with descriptions of' the signals used in that work, and records of the observations for azimuth at Cat island, have been furnished within the season and placed with the archives in the office. · Magnetic observations.-At Barrel Key station, on tho western side of Chandeleur sound, observations were made during the progress of the work of triangulation and topography, by Sub-Assistant Stephen Harris. The magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal intensity were determined with declinometer, C. S. No. 2, and the ten-inch dip circle by Barrow, C. S. No. 8.

Dauphine Isla'Tl.d base.-Since the measurement of the base on Dauphine island, ir:. 1847, the site has been repeatedly visited by .Assistants F. H. Gerdes and J. E. Hilgard, in passing to and from the ground of their work in the Gulf Sections. Inspection has been made from time to time, and the condition of the marks, intended to be permanent at the termini, reported, and the results have been stated, from time to time, in my reports. The hurricane of' 1855 having destroyed the monument at the west end of the base, a new set of marks were made by Assistant Hilgard from points marked during the measurement of the .base undisturbed by the hurricane. For further security, reference marks were made by Assistant Gerdes, and a 'Screw pile was inserted in the prolongation of the line, below the s~rface, in a vertical position, filled, covered, and marked. In the opinion of Mr. Gerdes it will keep its place so long as the island itself remains. O~ eompleting this duty, .Assistant Gerdes proceeded with his regular work in this section and m the prosecution of that described under Section VII. . lleconna~ a,'Rd, tria~ of M"issi8Bippi delta, Louisiana.-.A.fter completing the work Just described, .Assistant F.

ma.de a general reconnaissance, with the object of commencing tho triangulation of tho delta within the season. Regarding as so many stations to be occupied, the light-houses at the entrances of the delta, the scheme of triangles projected extends upwards from the outer passes of the Mississippi, and includes the several arms of the delta and the main river as high up as Fort St. Philip. The site for a preliminary base was selected and surveyed by Assistant Gerdes. ·"Its ~oca tion is on the eastern shore of the main river, just abovo the head of the Passes, on a very narrow strip of pasture land, running close along the bank, and bounded on the eastern side by marshes and the water known as Bay Rondo." ''The ground during a dry season is as hard as a gravelled road, perfectly level and free from all but very trifling obstructions. It much resem'1.es the site of the base at Cape Sable, and presents the advantage of being always hard and not subject to be affected by ordinary showers of rain.'' ''From end to end the line measures approximately 4, 950 metres,' 1 (3. 1 miles.) The location of the site is nearly central on the ground at present embraced m the field operations, as will be seen on Sketch No. 4 7. A topographical sheet, executed by Assistant Gerdes, includes the shores of the rivers in the immediate vicinity of the base, and the junc· tion of the three principal outlets of the Mississippi. The statistics of work are as follows : Stations occupied. · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · · . · .. · ..... · · · · · · · · · . · ... · .. · · . . 9 Preliminary observations made at . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . · . . . . 5 Angles recorded .. · ... _ ...... · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 888 Area in square miles. · . · · · ·. · .. · ............... · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 70 Shore-line traced, (miles) . ·. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 Mr. Gerdes teports as probable that the site chosen may be found to possess the conditions requisite for a primary base line, and by reason of the general instability of the neighboring surface this fact will, if verified by subsequent examination, materia1ly conduce to the means for securing accuracy in the work. The connections desirable with the triangulation are reported by Assistant Gerdes as being entirely practicable. Probably no tract of equal extent, included in the operations of the survey, presents so many natural obstacles to progress in the field as the delta of the Mississippi. The light-houses at the outer passes serving as points will opportunely aid in the work, and it is supposed that a station carried to the height of forty feet, at the junction of the mouths with the main body of the river, would enable the observer to complete measurements upon all the points connected with the triangulation: of the delta. Facilities for the erection of stations, so common else· where, are in this district almost entirely wanting. Assistant Gerdes remarks : ''A greater scarcity of foothold I have never experienced, and, but for the light-houses, I would regard the work as altogether impracticable, without the employment of extraordinary means for its execution." , ''The use of the plane· table in the prosecution of topography will, in all probability, be found impossible.'' Having adjusted his scheme for triangulation, Mr. Gerdes occupied successively fourteen stations of the second order, at nine of which he completed the angular measurements. Pre· liminary observations were made at the remaining stations. The computations resulting from the work have also been made by the party and sent to the office. :Afr: C.

While the work here referred to was in progress a division of the party was detailed for the continuance of the triangulation and topography beyond Atchafalaya bay, as will be presently noticed.

Muwurement of prdiminary ba.se at Point au C hevreuil and triangulation if Cate Blanche bay, La.-Necessary comparisons were made at the office, of the apparatus intended for use
in the measurement at Point au Chevreuil, and on their completion tL.e bars were packed and directed to Assistant Gerdes, who was then engaged in the triangulation and reconnaissance noticed under the last head. The ve;;sel, however, in which they were despatched was unfortunately wrecked on the Bahamas, near Nassau, and the apparahls was lost. On receiving from the office a new set of hars, Mr. Gerdes proceeded at once to Atchafalaya bay, and made preparations for the measurement of the base at Point au Chevreuil, the approximate length of which had been determined by repeated chaining in the previous year. The base was measured without any interrupt.ion. Two days were occupied in preparing the line, and five were employed in the measurement. Mr. Gerdes reports that the contact slides, devised by Assistant J. E. Hilgard and attached to the apparatus, worked very well in use. After making the computations and reductions for inC'lination and applying the necessary temperature corrections, the resulting length was found to be 3,473.9 metres, (about 2.2 miles.) Mr. Gerdes was assisted in the measurement by Sub-Assistant J. G. Oltmanns, who subsequently prosecuted the triangulation of Cote Blanche bay, based on a reconnaissance made previous to the return of Assistant Gerdes to the site of his work at the mouth of the Mississippi river. From a connection with stations occupied last season in the vicinity of Point au Chevreuil the triangulation was pushed northward and westward into Cote Blanche bay. The limit reached in the work, as far as completed in that direction, coincides w:ith a line joining the northeastern extremity of Marsh island with Malony's Point.-(See sketch No. 47.) The reconnaissance made by Assistant Gerdes will furnish also the means for carrying the triangulation into the upper part of the bay in the ernming season. The statistics of the work executed by Sub-Assistant Oltmanns are as follows: Stations established or selected .. · · .. · · · · .... · · · · · - .. · · · . · · . · · · · · · · 23 Stations occupied. . . . . . . . · . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 Angles recorded . . . . . . . . . . . . · ·........ - ............... · .... ·. - . . 1, 02'1 A duplicate of the record made in the measurement of the preliminary base, at Point au Chevreuil, has been received from Assistant Gerdes. Topography ef shores ef Lake Borgne, La.-The plane-table party heretofore employed in this v-ieinity was organized at the usual date for resuming work by Assistant R. M. Bache. A sheet was commenced by him intended to include a part of the northern sqpre of Lake Borgne, contiguous to Shell Point and Alligator Point, but after some progress had been made in its execution he was compelled to leave the field in consequence of declining health, and Sub-Assistant W. S. Gilbert was detailed to conduct the party operations until the close of the season.

Mr. Gilbert completed the sheet begun by Assistant Bache, and laid out two others. The one immediately adjoining that just mentioned commences at Alligator Point, and comprises almost the entire shore-line and adjacent topography of the southwestern extremity of Lake Borgne. The details a.re thus stated by Sub-AssiBtant Gilbert: "That part of the country Was included lying between Fort wood and Proctorville. The work was carried back about a

mile and three quarters from the shore at Proctorville, nearly to the same distance back from Martello Castle, somewhat less in the vicinity of Battery: Bienvenue, and from thence to Fort Wood, a fringe of about a mile and a half in breadth was executed and represented on the sheet." ''The shores of the lake, and as far back as the sheet extends, with the exception of the site of Proctorville, and a few shell banks in the vicinity of Martello Castle, are compo_sed of very soft marsh, intersected by numerous bayous and lagoons, which connect with each' other and with the lake on both sides of the peninsula known as Proctor Point." "The banks of these bayous are covered with cane, ranging from five to nine feet in height, which, by obstructing the view, rendered the survey very difficult." ''Early in May a third sheet was commenced, which takes in the shore lying between Proc· torville and Point aux Marchettes. The detailed work was carried back to distances varying between half a mile and a mile from the general shore-line. The character of the topography here is similar to that before described, except that there are a few trees on tho banks of tho intervening bayous. Having determined their positions by lines from the shore, I was enabled to check on them as point1', when it was impracticable to use the positions furnished in the triangulation." Sub-Assistant Gilbert highly commends the efficiency and zeal manifested by the aid in his party, Mr. Rufus King, jr. The schooner G. M. Bache was taken in charge by Mr. Gilbert on the 9th of February, for transportation, and at the close of the season was laid up at Pascagoula. Work was discontinued on the 1st of June, at which time the three topographical sheets comprised the following statistics : Shore-line surveyed··· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · . · · . . . . . . · . . . · 242 miles. Area included in detail· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · · · . · ... · · · .. · · 62 square miles. The sheets were inked soon after the return of Sub-Assistant Gilbert from this section and registered in tho office. Assistant R. M. Bache has completed and turned in two sheets of the Rigolets and Pearl river island and vicinity, executed by him respectively in 1855 and 1856. Late in July Mr. Gilbert commenced and prosecuted the duty noticed under the head of topography in Section I. His preparations will be made early for the continuation of the work i~ Section VIII. Topography qf western shores qf Chandelewr sound, La.-In the intervals unfavorable to the measurement of angles, plane-table work was carried on by the party of Assistant Hilgard within the limits of the secondary triangulation of the western side of Chandeleur sound. A sheet, represented on Sketch No. 41, was completed, and another, joining it and extending in the direction of the Mississippi delta, was in progress when the operations were brought to a close by the advance of summer. One hundred aud sixty-two miles of shore-line were traced and transferred to the sheets within an area of twenty square miles. The completed sheet has been inked and placed in the office. The surface of the country surveyed is marshy and intersected by numerous shallow bayous. On returning to the uorth, Sub-Assistant Harris was attached to my party, and assisted in the operations described under Section I. He is about to return and prosecute the triangulation in Ohandeleur sound, under the direction of Assistant Hilgard. Topography -Of Cote Blanche bay, La.-In connection with the triangulation of Assistant Gerdes, and from points furnished in its progress, Sub-Assistant Oltmanns executed a plane

table survey of the shores of Cote Blanche bay, including that part of Marsh island which fell within the bounds of the triangulation. Point au Chevreui.l, Malony's Point, and the intervening topography of the eaRtern part of the bay, are represented on the sheet. The statistics connected with its details are as follows : Shore-line surveyed· · · · · · · . · . · .... · · · . · · · · · · · · · · · ... · .. · . . . . . . 26 miles.

Sub-Assistant Oltmanns reported at the office, but his health was so much impaired as to render it inexpedient to a~sign him to duty at the north. Assistant Gerdes was occupied during the summer in office-work depending upon his observations made in this section and on the western shore of the Florida peninsula. He has since completed and returned to the office two topographical sheets containing the work last executed on C te Blanche and .Atchafalaya bays. Hydrog'raphy ef Mississippi sound.-Commander B. F. Sands, U. S. N., assistant Coast Survey, in charge of the hydrographic party in the surveying steamer Walker, sailed from Philadelphia on the 19th of November. On the way south incidental soundings were attempted, but unfavorable weath~r in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras prevented the accomplishment of any satisfactory results. The efforts of Commander Sands, made with the same object later in the season, were, however, successful, and the results obtained have been referred to under another head. A succession of gales was experienced on the passage, and after coaling at Key West the Walker was delayed some time for necessary repairs to the boilers, which, having been a long time in use, had become much worn. SomeJurther delay occurred at Pensacola, from which port the vessel finally sailed for her station on the 1st of February, and on her arrival the regular operations of the party were resumed. The hydrography of Mississippi sound was continued from the limits of former work, and is now complete to the westward as far as Grassy island, at the entrance into Lake Borgne. The space included in the soundings made this season lies north of the range of islands bordering the southwestern part of the sound, and extends to a line midway between them and the northern shore at the entrance of Bay St. Louis. A resurvey was also made of a portion of the work previously executed off Pass Christian. The duty thus far noticed was accomplished by the end o!' .April. Commander Sands then proceeded to Pensacola for a supply of coal and provisions, and on his return ran a line of soundings S.SW. from the bar of Pensacola, a distance of thirty miles, and thence to Chandeleur sound. The hydrography was resumed at Chandeleur north, and carried by the 25th of MifY westward about ten miles across the northern end of the sound, and southward nearly to the latitude of Rescue Hill. Sketch No. 47 represents the hydrographic limits of the sheet of this locality, and also that containing the work done in Mississippi sound. On the completion ef the two sheets just noticed, Commander Sands carried a line of soundings from a position ten miles east of Chandeleur light, southward and westward along the islands, to the delta of the Mississippi, at Pass a l' Outre, and from thence shaped a course for the NW. Pass, at Key West harbor. The results obtained are thus stated in his report: "I . succeeded in running the line, having good weather, and in obtaining soundings and portions of the bottom at every cast, by means of an improvement recently devised, and attached to my apparatus, for bringing up specimens, a drawing and description of which (Appendix No. 46, Sketch No. 70) accompanies this report. The instrument was entirely sue-

cessful in practice, and renders the work of sounding, at the greatest depths, comparatively an easy operation. The rod with specimen tube attached and Massey's indicator, weighing but five or six pounds, admits of the use of the smallest lead-line, and is hauled in by hand with perfect ease.'' "The deepest sounding made on the passage to Key West was at 1, 511 fathoms, registered by the indicator with 2,070 fathoms of line out, and an ample specimen of light blue mud was brought up. The preceding cast showing but 370 fathomR, and my meridian obs~rvation placing the vessel further north than the position intended, I hauled to the southward, and the greater depth, as just described, was obtained, showing the abruptness of the northern plateau and leading to the inference of a greater depth further south, say along a line extending from South Pass to the Tortugas." In my last report I remarked upon the sudden change of depth from the plateau as a general fact, and threw out some suggestions in regard to its connection with the cause of the low temperatures at considerable depths. At the bottom the temperature in the month of May was 38° Fahr., the air being 78° and the surface water 77! 0 · After taking in a supply of coal at Key West, Commandei: Sands returned to the north, and, on the homeward passage of the steamer, executed a fourth line of soundings, which has been remarked upon in a former part of this report, in reference to the Gulf Stream. The following is a synopsis of the work executed during the season by the hydrographic party:

The chart of Mississippi sound and Pass Christian has been plotted and registered in the office. Before commencing the operations in this section, Commander Sands had sent to the office twenty volumes containing the original records of soundings made in the work of 1'u!t year, a volume of observations in determining angles, another of tides observed, and thirteen diagrams, in duplicate, of current observations made in 1855. While detained at Pensacola, assistance was rendered by Commander Sands, with the men and boats of the steamer Walker, on the occasion of a fire which happened at Fort Pickens on the night of the 20th of January. On the day following the accident, a communication was addressed to him by Captain John Newton, corps of U.S. engineers, commanding the harbor of Pensacola, in acknowledgment of the obligation to the officers and crew, who, in conjunction with the hydrographic party in the C. S. schooner Varina, had promptly repaired to the scene of disaster. The steamer Walker was refitted with new boilers at Philadelphia during the summer, and has been re-assigned for use of the hydrographic party, to continue the work in this section.

SECTION IX.
FROM VERMILION BAY TO THE BOUNDARY, INCLUDING PART OF THE CO.AST OF LOUISIANA, .AND THE COAST OF TEXAS.-(SK&TCH I, No. 63.}

The same number of parties have been at work here during the past season as during the year before, and I see no reason to change the estimate which I made in my report of 1856 of the time of completion of the section. The proportionate progress during the past year has been reached in the land work, and only fell short in the hydrography by one of those untoward changes in the organization of the party to which I have before referred as so often interfering with the progress of the survey in this section. Five years, or less, will carry the triangulation to the Rio Grande, if prosecuted with the means now devoted to it ; and the topography is of such a character, that one party continuing work with the triangulation, and another acting independently, are sufficient to keep up the plane-table work. There will then remain the extension of the triangulation from Galveston bay to V errnilion bay, on the coast of Louisiana. These remarks suppose that the present triangulation may suffice for main work. If this proves not to be the case, a few years must be added to the estimate. A hydrographic party with a sailing vessel is also sufficient to keep pace with the land work, the soundings being unusually uniform along the coast. We are, however, again to be retarded this year by a change in the chief of the party, and this will, of course, tell upon the progress. The details to be given in this chapter will show the completion of the triangulation of Matagorda bay, and of its dependencies ; the completion of the greater part of the topography of the bay, and of the hydrography of the entrance and part of the interior, together with some off-shore soundings, giving a general idea of the slope of the bottom of this part of the Gulf of Mexico. These sn bjects will be taken up in turn. Qffice-work.-The drawing of a finished map of Galveston bay, .-0 t 00, has been in progress; the preliminary chart of the coast of Texas, from Galveston southward, has been drawn and engraved, and also a new edition of the entrance to Galveston bay, 40~ 0 0 · TriangUlation of Matagorda bay and its dependencies, Texas.-This work was resumed, after the completion of the office-work of last year, by the party of Assistant S. A. Gilbert, who continued his operations in the field until its final completion on the 20th of June. The topography was prosecuted by him in connection with the triangulation. Assistant Gilbert found the season more than usually favorable for field-work, and succeeded in finishing the triangulation of the bay and its dependencies, including Lavacca and Espiritu Santo bays, a.nd in extending the scheme for completion quite across the entrance of San Antonio bay, lying between that last mentioned and Aransas. Before the close of the season stations had been occupied within thirty miles of Aransas Pass. As represented in Sketch No. 53, the triangulation has been completed to the line Espiritu Santo Rahal, in the direction of Aransas. "The whole number of stations occupied was eight, from which we observed upon and determined twenty-four signals, and other conspicuous objects. At all the stations we were obliged to observe from scaffolds, elevated twenty to thirty feet above the ground, in order to 800 over the high rolls of the prairie, the cane grass that grows in swampy places, and the bushes fringing the shores. These scaffolds required to be made very steady, as a strong

breeze generally blows when it is clear enough to observe, and there is no protection against its force. The difficulty of transportation renders the carrying o( the lumber for them tedious and very laborious.'' During the progress of the work, conducted by Assistant Gilbert, points were furnished to the hydrographic party, in charge of Lieut. Comg. J. C. Fcbiger, for the execution of work which will be referred to preRently. Mr. Charles Hosmer was attached to the triangulation party as aid. He assisted,' also, in the topography, and, under the direction of Mr. Gilbert, in inking the sheets. A volume containing the recordB of horizontal angles measured in the triangulation of Matagorda bay has been deposited in the archives of the section. Topography.-The plane-table work on the shores of :Matagorda bay and its branches was carried on by AsBistant Gilbert in connection with his own triangulation. Some difficulty was experie,nced in the field in consequence of drought and the necessity of using unwholesome water; but the unusual degree of coolness for that latitude favored operations generally, and good progress has been made in the work. :N'early the whole of the topography of Matagorda bay has been completed. The portion remaining to be yet executed comprises a part of Lavacca bay, in the vicinity of Gallinipper Point. Assistant Gilbert thus reports the statistics of his plane-table sheets : Shore line surveyed· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · . · · · ... · . . . 158 miles. Roads · · · · · · · · .... · · · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · · · · · · · · · · . · · · · · 15A '' Area of topographical sheets· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · · · . . . . . . . 90 square miles. Of the three sheets completed, one, embracing the inner shore of Matagorda bay, between seven-mile station and Live Oak bayou, was begun in the previous year. Assistant Gilbert traced in, on the second, the western shore of Carankaway bay and the shores and interior in the vicinity of Sand Point. It was then taken up by Sub-Assistant M. Seaton, in charge of a separate topographical party in this section, and completed. Tho third sheet embraces the shores of Lavacca bay and the continuation of its western shore beyond Pass Cavallo light· house, at the entrance to Matagorda bay. '' The general character of the country is prairie ; along the shores of the bays the land is subject to overflow at very high tides; but, at a distance of ten or fifteen miles from the Gulf, the shores of the bays are fronted by bluffs rising from :fifteen to thirty feet high, with freq11ent patches of timber, especially near the streams." ":Matagorda island is mostly low, but ridges, or 'rolls,' rising from eight to "ten feet above the Gulf, extend throughout its entire length. Immediately along the Gulf shore some sand hills occur, varying in height between five and thirty feet." ''The soil of the island is fertile ; but high winds prevail constantly during spring and summer. All kinds of garden vegetables grow in great perfection and abundanee. "Fruit trees generally, and the peach and fig, thrive very well in sheltered localities; but tht! chief attention is given to the raising of cattle, mules, and sheep." "The towns of Lavacca, Indianola, and Saluria come within the limits of this season's work. At the two first named considerable business is done in forwarding and receiving goods and produce, passing and returning between the coast and the upper country. Regular lines of sailing packets connect with New York and New Orleans, and two lines of steamships run to and from the last named city.

THE UNITED STA.TES COAST SURVEY.

'' Saluria may become a place of much importance, if plans which have been projected for the improvement of the bays are carried out." Assistant Gilbert prosecuted his operations until the 20th of June in a vessel hired for the purpose at Saluria. Before leaving the section he executed a reconnaissance for the extension of the work in the coming season to Aransas. The three topographical sheets resulting from the labors of the party in the vicinity of Matagorda and Lavacca bays were inked during the summer, and have been regi;;;tered in the office. The party of Assistant Gilbert will shortly be reorganized to extend the triangulation and topography of the coast of Texas southward and westward, in the direction of Aransas pass. A second party, detailed for topographical duty on the shores of :Matagorda bay, "vas conducted by Sub-Assistant M. Seaton. He reached the field on the 13th of January, and commenced a sheet at Olive Point, to include the whole of Trespalacios bay, above the entrance, and West Turtle bay, with the streams running into both. The southwestern limit of his work comprises also the eastern shores of Carankaway hay. "An abrupt bluff, from six to eight feet in height, composed of a species of marl, shells, and black mud, forms the shore on either side of Well Point, and the edge of the bluff is covered with low matted hushes." "A well of excellent water occurs in this vicinity, and also wood for fuel, articles very scarce in that region. The prairie is generally high and slightly undulating, with occasional depressions of wet grnund, which abound in wild fowl." The plane-table survey, made by Sub-Assistant Seaton, was extended upwards from the head of the bay, and embraces the shores of Trespalacios river for about a mile above its entrance. "There is a shallow bar at the mouth of the river which is a serious hindrance to naviga· tion, for vessels drawing more than two and a half or three feet. After passing this obstruction bold water is fouud for many miles up. Several large creek,,;, in former year.;, were the outlets for large quantities of cotton and suga,r, but the trade seems to have been directed into other. channels.'' In addition to the sheet completed by Mr. Seaton, some details were placed by him on one previously commenced by Assistant Gilbert, to include the vicinity of Indianola and Lavacca.

Preparations are now well advanced for resuming the topographical work at the opening of the coming season.

Hydrogr<11>hy of the bar and entrance to Matagorda bay, Texas.-Tbo hydrographic party which has been heretofore engaged in this section was reorganized, at the usual time for resuming work, and continued under the command of Lieut.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

.After the necessary preparations, the surveying schooner .Arago sailed from Philadelphia, and, in a passage of ordinary duration, reached the ground of work, off Matagorda peninsula. On the way south, Lieut. Comg. De Haven suffered much in the failing of his eyesight, but proceeded, in the hope of being able to direct the hydrographic operations of his party. His expectati<~.n was not realized, and towards the end of January he requested to be relieved from the charge of the duties assigned · Lieut. Comg. John C. Febiger was detailed for the service, and having relieved the officer at first in charge, and received the requisite data, furnished by the triangulation party, be projected a sheet to embrace the entrance and a portion of the lower part of Matagorda bay. The bar near the entrance was sounded, and will be laid down on the completed chart. Four current stations were used, and tidal observations made for the hydrog.raphic reductions. Soundings were extended to the distance of four miles outside from Decros Point, and from the limit in that vicinity five miles southward and westward, to a line beyond the light-house a few miles below Saluria, on the southern side of the entrance to the bay. .A. space, including about six miles square, lying inside of Matagorda peninsula, was also sounded, in connection with the work on the bar. Efforts made by Lieut. Comg. Febiger, soon after his arrival in the section, to obtain lines of o:!I-shore soundings were not successful. .A. line was, however, subsequently run from the outer buoy at Matagorda bar, on a southeast course, (magnetic,) and specimens of bottom were obtained at depths ranging from four to sixty-eight fathoms ; the soundings on this line were carried to a distance of rather more than fifty miles. Work was commenced by the party in charge of Lieut. Comg. Febiger on the 24th of March, and terminated on the 19th of May. The folloWing is an abstract of the statistics of tlie regular hydrography : :Miles run in sounding.····· . · · · .. · · · · · · ........... ·.. . . . . . . . . . . . . 520 Number of soundings.··· . · ·. · · ................... · · · · ..... ·. . . . . . 31, 290 Angles determined. · · · · · .. · · · .. · · ................... · . . . . . . . . . . . . 1, 249 The operations of the party were retarded by the unfavorable character of the weather and by the loss of one of the working boats. On returning northward, soundings for temperatures were made by Lieut. Comg. Febiger in the axis of the Gulf Stream, which service has been referred to, under that head, in a former part of this report. Very shortly after the arrival of the schooner Arago at Philadelphia, Lieut. Oomg. Febiger was detached from duty on the Coast Survey, and the office-work of the party was executed under the direction of Lieut. W. T. Glassell, U. S. N., who had assisted during the season in the hydrographic work at :Matagorda entrance. The chart of the bar, and part of the bay included in the soundings, has been forwarded by that offic!=lr to the Coast Survey office, with duplicates of the records and seven specimens of bottom taken from the bar at Matagorda. I had hoped to retain the services of Lieutenant Febiger as chief of a hydrographic party. He had been trained in the school of h.rdrography of Lieut. Comg. Craven, and had earned a most enviable reputation as his executive officer. His promptness in ·repairing to Texas, and his success in taking up the work in the midst of the season's operaltiofiB, gave earnest of his futnre usefulness. I much regretted his detachment, and endeavored to induce the Navy Department to withdraw it, but without effect.

The land-work in these two sections has made excellent progres;;, but the hydrography has been, in a degree, retarded by the call for the services of the hydrographic party, under the law of 185G, for transportation, and other aids, to the Commissioner of the Northwestern Boundary of the United States. All the work that zeal and industry could accomplish, under the circumstances, has been executed. The details are given under the following heads for Section X: 1. Astronomical and magnetic observations at San Francisco and Tamales bay. 2. Triangulation of Santa Barbara islands and adjacent coast. 3. Primary and secondary triangulation north of San Francisco bay. 4. Tertiary triangulation on the shores of San Francisco bay. 5. Topography of main of Santa Barbara channel. 6. Topography of San Francisco bay. 7. Hydrography of Monterey bay and Santa Barbara channel. 8. Hydrography of San Francisco bay. 9. Tidal observations. 10. Light-house examination. The work done in Section XI is mentioned under the following : J. Triangulation of .Admiralty inlet, W. T. 2. Topography of .Admiraly inlet and Hood's canal. It will be seen that we are about to realize the results desired by the Land Office in the connection of the islands off the Santa Barbara channel with tho main. Should the appropriation for this special work be cut off, the parties engaged in it must necessarily also be cnt off, and the operations be stopped for the present in favor of the more important work to the northward. Two years more would probably complete all that is desired here, beyond the regular progress of the survey. It would be premature to attempt yet an estimate of the time of completion rif these two sections, seeing that the data are necessarily so insufficient for the purpose. The amount of shore-line shown by detached surveys would probably not be so much in excess, as proved to be the case on the .Atlantic side, and yet. on particular parts of the coast, as near San Francisco entrance, any estimate from the ordinary charts must have fallen very much below the truth, as shown by the detached surveys. Qffece-work.-The following maps, charts, and sketches of Section X have been drawn during the year: San Diego bay, Cortes bank, San Clemente anchorage, eastern entrance of Santa Barbara channel, San Francisco entrance, San .Antonio creek, and Mare Island strait. Finished maps of Monterey bay, San Francisco bay, and San Pablo bay have been in progress. The engravmg · ' following plates has been completed : .Anacapa and part of Santa Cruz island ; o f the entrance to San Fr~ncisco bay, as preliminary, and the engraving of San Diego bay ; eastern entrance to Santa Barbara channel; entrance to San Francisco bay, (finished chart.) San Antonio creek and San Pablo bay are now in progress. . Sectimt XL-Drawings have been made of Port Townsend baiie and Apple cove. The

Astronomical observations.-Although the computed predictions of the occultations of the Pleiades on the 1st of March, which had been sent to Assistant George Davidson from the office, did not arrive until after their occurrence, he had made all requisite preparations to observe them at San Francisco with the C. S. transit No. 2, and zenith telescope No .. 3, and succeeded in obtaining no less tlian twenty-two immersions of the stars of that group, with transits of the moon aml moon culminating stars on the two following nights. Mr. Davidson alRo computed the times of beginning, ending, and phases of the solar eclipse of March 25th, noting the instant of both contacts by actual obRervation. One hui1dred and eighteen transitr;: in all were observed in connection with the eclipse and occultations. JJiagnei1'c obsavntions.-ln order to make his observations of the solar eclipse of March at San Francisco as complete as possible, Assistant Davidson sot up the magnetometer, and obtained results showing the changes in the mag·netic declination. A full series of meteorological observations was made at the Rame time. During the rainy season )fr. Davids011 viRited Tomalm; bay, and completed a series of satiRfactory observations for absolute magnetic declination at the previous station there, then occupied by tbe party of Assistant G. A. Fftirfield. No reliable results were obtained for inclination with the dip circle used. The results obtained in these several observations, with duplicates of the records, have been received at the Coast Survey office. On various occasions during the year Assistant Davidson furnished, by request, the geographical positions of light-houses in this and the adjoining section, with notes, tracings, and information relative to other points on the coast, desired by the officer in charge of the lighthouse service, :aiajor Hartman Bache, U. S. Topographical Engineers. The party left San Francisco on the 1st of April in the surveying brig Fauntleroy, and the l'egular operations of the season, conducted under charge of Mr. Davidson, will be stated with notices of the work in Section XI. Triangulation. Santa Barbara islands and adjacent cuast of California.-This work has been continued, and good progress has been made in it, by the party under the charge of Assistant W. E. Greenwell, in the surveying schooner Ilumboldt. On the main the triangulation has been extended from San Fernando to Conejo station, near the coast, and lying between Point Duma and the Santa Clara river. Reconnaissance has been made in addition, and signals erected for carrying a chain of triangles in the same direction, between the main and the islands of Santa Cruz and San Miguel, quite through the Santa Barbara.channel to Point Conception. The scheme proposed is given on Sketch No. 56. The difficulties attending the triangulation of the main and neighboring islands, to which allusion has been made in my previous reports, have been iu a great measure overcome by the energy of Assistant Greenwell, whose efforts in its accomplishment have been uutiring. His party has spent the entire surveying year in the field. The triangulation of Santa Cruz island, which was in progress at the close of last season, has been completed, and that of San Nicolas, lying at some d stance from it to the southward, has also been executed. Some interesting remarks on the character of the islands forming the Santa Barbara group,

and the views of Mr. Greenwell in reference to the practicability of completing their survey, will be found in Appendix No. 44. Mr. P. C. F. W eRt served as aid in the triangulation party, and is commended in the report of Assistant Greenwell for willing and intelligent co-operation in all the interests of the work under his charge.

S. No. 44, 'vas used by JI.Ir. Greenwell in the measurement of angles. Violent shocks of earthquake occurred on the 9th of January while the triangulation and topographical parties were engaged on the shore of Sallta Barba,ra chaunel. Assistant Green· well, in charge of the triangulation, was then at San Fernando Station, (see Sketch No. 56,) and Sub-Assistant Johnson at. work with his plane-table party in Sycamore valley, a few miles wostwar!l of Point Duma. Reports received from both of those gentlemen agree as to t.110 time of commencement of the earthquake at twenty-four m twenty-five minutes past eight. o'clock in the morning. Beb\Teen that time and eleven o'clock of the same night, nine shocks in all were recorded by Mr. Johnson, and four by Mr. Greenwell. The shocks felt at Sycamore valley in the morning were all within the space of twenty-four minutes from the beginning ; those in the evening commenced at half-past eight o'clock and recurred at intervals until forty minutes past ten. At San Fernando, three shocks occurred in the morning between 3h. 25rn. and 9Ji. 31m., and one in the afternoon at 4h. 49m. .Mr. Johnson's camp was thirty miles eastward of the town of San Buenaventura, and, having occasion to visit. that place i11 connection with the delivery of supplies which had been forwarded from San Francisco, he left Sycamore valley soon after the last shock was felt in the morning of the 9th, and reached S~n Buenaventura in the evening. His observations on the effect produced by the earthquake along his route are thus described in his report: ''We forded the Santa Clara river six miles from its mouth. The stream in itself ii:i insignificant, but its bed is from a half to three-quarters of a mile wide from bank to bank; and here I met with the first evidences of the terrible power exerted by the convulsion of nature so recently felt. Long cracks were visible in the bed of the river, many of them being six or eight inches across, and extending in a direction SE. and NW. These openings must have been at first considerably wider, for many of them had evidently been filled with water from the river, as on either side of the cracks lay a ridge of wet sand. "These appearances were visible as far as I could see up and down the bed of the river. Near the mouth of the river the cracks were longer and wider. Persons residing within a mile of the entrance say that the water was thrown out from the cracks as high a'E: six feet, and that large blocks of earth sank several feet below the former level. and there remain.'' ~.fter the arrival of Mr. Johnson at San Buenaventura, .shocks were felt there generally comcident with those recorded by the party at Sycamore valley during his absence. In reference to the first shock felt a.t S.in Fernando, Assistant Greenwell says : " The earth Was in fearful agitation, with undulations so quick and rapid as to make it almost impossible to

stand. The sensation was very much like that felt on the deck of a small vessel in a heavy chopped sea." He arlds, in regard to changes of relative positlon, which might have been expected in the immediate vicinity : "I was interested to know whether my signals remained unchanged; but in subsequent measurements no differences could be detected in the angles." .At San Fernando, the earthquake wave seemed to travel from east to west. In Sycamore valley, the direction was judged to be from the southeast, ranging upwards with the trend of ~oo~. ' The particulars of the earthquake of January 9 have been furnished for the archives of the Smithsonian Institution. Earthquake shocks recurred at intervals during the month of January at Mr. Johnson's camp, on Santa Barbara channel. His journal contains notes of the time and attendant phenomena of one on the 10th, two ou the 11th, one on the 15th, three on the 16th, one on the 17th, and one on the 28th of that month. These shocks produced no action upon the ocean which could be detectetl upon the tide-gauges at San Diego or San Francisco. Primary and secondary triangulation north ef San .Francisco bay, Cal.-'fhe primary work in charge of Assistant G. A. Fairfield has been extended to Point Reyes, in connection with the secondary triangulation. The secondary woTk on Tomales bay has been completed and carried northward to include also Bodega bay. At the date of his last report of p.rogress, Assistant Fairfield was engaged in endeavors to connect his triangulation of Point Reyes with that previon:oly executed by Sub-A_ssistant Rodgers, on Ballenas bay. Field operations, at stations along the coast, have been very much retarded by the prevalence of df'.nse fogs. In reference to prospective work Assistant Fairfield remarks : "The indications now are that we shall have an early and severe winter ; in which case I anticipate being able to execute more of the primary work than during the past two years, which have been exceedingly unfavorable to the progress of the triangulation." The signals observed on during the season were erected by Mr. C. B. Ellis, the aid of the pi:rty. A magnetic station, established and occupied in the course of the season by Assistant G. Davidson, was connected by Mr. Fairfield with his secondary triangulation. The following are statistics of the main and secondary work : Number of signals erected . · ·. ·. · · ·. ·. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·. ·. . . . . . . 21 Stations occupied, (including one primary station) · · · · . · . · · . · . · . . . . . . . 17 Angles observed and determined· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · · · . · .. · . · . · . . . . . . . 122 Number of observations · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·. · .. · 1,828 Tertiary triangulation on the shore of San Francisco bay, Oril.-As a basis for his plane-table work of the Contra Costa, Sub-Assistant A. F. Rodgers laid out a chain of small triangles extending from the station, marked Contra Costa (1) on the Sketch No. 57, to Red Hill, in a direction nearly southeast from it. Ten stations were occupied with the Wiirdemann theodo· lite, C. S. No. 38, and sixteen points determined and plotted on the topographical sheet. Sub-.A.J;sistaut Rodgers also made a small triangulation at the entrance of San Francisco bay, and determined the positions of the light-houses on Point Bonita, Fort Point, Alcatraz island, and the position of the selected site at Point Lobos. The records of the triangulation made on the Contra Costa have been sent to the office.

son, and continued eastward along the coast to Point Duma. It is comprised on two sheets, the first extending from the place of beginning to the Canada de Isique, and embracing a rough and difficult tract. ''The part of the coast range represented on this sheet has an average altitude of twelve hundred feet above high water, the mountains springing directly from the water line.·' On the second sheet, which includes the coast between Canada de Is-ique and Point Duma, the topography undergoes a slight change in character. A strip of table-laud, about a hundred and fifty yards wide, commences at tho Canada, and gradually increaAes in breadth in the direction of Point Duma, where it is several mileR in extent. The average elevation of this table-land is about two hundred feet. Five miles eastward of Point Duma the hills again come down boldly to the shore . .At the last date received from Sub-Assistant Johnson, his party was at work two miles west .of Point Duma.

M. Bache served as aid in the party, and assisted Mr. Johnson in both the field and office work throughout the year. Transportation was furnished by .Assistant W. E. Greenwell in the surveying schooner Humboldt. An original topographical sheet, executed between Point .A.no N"uevo and Punta del Bolsa, by Sub-Assistant Johnson, in 185,i, has been inked and deposited in tho archives. The character of that part of the coast of Santa Barbara c1rnnnl'] surveyed during the year is well described in extracts from the report of Mr. Johnson, Appemlix No. 43. Topography of San Francisco bay, Cal.-This ·work has been vigorously prosecuted withiu the year by two parties under the charge of Sub-Assistant A.. F. Rodgers, and the survey of tho shore-line is now complete. The localities embraced in the concluding operations lie at the isoutheastern extremity of the bay, below a line joining· Guano island and Contra Costa, (1,) and in the vicinity of San Francisco city. Seven topographical sheets in all have been completed during the season, of which five contain in connection the shore-line, creeks, and water courses of the ]ower part of the bay, and two the shores of the Golden Gate, San Francisco city, and the western shore of the bay from the city southward beyond Point Avisadera. Commencing at the Upper Contra Costa, the first sheet executed comprises, in addition to the eastern shore and numernus intricate streams, a survey of Union City. A second sheet reaches to the extremity of the bay, and includes the shores of Coyote creek and its tributaries; Ravenswood and Alvise are contained on the third sheet, with the shore-line and water courses occurring between those two towns. The work continued from Ravenswood upwards, along the western side of the bay, is comprised on two sheets, one of which includes Redwood city and the shores of San Francisco bay to Guano island. The marginal shore-line of the bay within the limits just described is much broken by smaJl creeks and more considerable streams, all of which are represented in the details of the topography. In order to secure the largest result in field-work practicable within the Reason, a second party was organized by Sub-Assistant Rodgers, and placed in charge of }fr. David Kerr, who ha~ served as aid for several years in the topographical party, and previously in the triangu· lation party engaged in the wQrk on San Francisco bay. Tho survey of the main shores of San Fr.ancisco bay was completed in March, and Mr.

Tracings from the sheets of the southern part of the bay were furnished by Mr. Rodgers in February and March to the hydrographic party then engaged in sounding. ·while the topographical work was in progress Sub-Assistant Rodgers made reconnaissances along the shores of Napa and Petaluma creeks. In reference to the first he reports that "the principal impediment to its navigation is a reef of rocks between Suscol ferry and the town of N"apa, which is situated higher up the stream. These extend across the channel, and close the passage to any boat of more than one foot draught of water. Snags are brought down by the winter freshets, and these also are hindrances to the navigation.'' The following remarks result from his observation>i made along the i;hores of Petaluma creek: "Petaluma must soon reach a position of no little comparative importance in the list of California cities, if rapid development is tho invariable result of extraordinary advantages of location ; and, under the influence of capital and labor, its progress during the last year affords ground for the 1mppoi!ition. The town is situated at the head of navigation, in the ·channel through which passes to market most of the produce of the valleys of Petaluma, Bodega, Santa Rosa, and Sonoma, fertile fields for agricultural enterprise. Their resources are only beginning to unfold, though every day attracting more attention. ''At low water the channel of Petaluma creek is very narrow in places, though free from rocks or snag», and generally of sufficient depth for ordinary steamboat traffic.'' Two original sheets of previous topographical work, executed by Mr. Rodgers on the shoreB of San Francisco bay, have been received within the year and deposited in the office. Hydrography of Monterey bay arul, Santa Barbara ckanruil.-At the close of the last surveying season the hydrographic party of Commander .Alden was engaged in Monterey bay and completed the soundings north of Point Pinos, including the entire bay, and extending to a line three miles west of Santa Cruz harbor. The in-shore hydrography of the coast 8etween Point .Afio N uevo and Point Miramontes, and soundings at the eastern entrance of Santa Barbara channel, abreast of Point Hueneme, were also completed before laying up the vessels for t,he winter. Fifty-seven speGimens of bottom taking. in the soundings of Monterey bay, sixteeu

at and near Point Hueneme, and nine from the vicinity of Pigeon Point have been sent to the office, with twenty-two specimens secured last season in the survey of San Diego bay. Commander Alden has also sent, for deposit in the office, four hydrographic sheets, containing the soundings of San Diego bay, his chart of Monterey bay in four sheets, and sheets of the work executed in Santa Barbara channel, and on the coast north of Point Ano Nuevo. He thus refers to a peculiarity observed in the hydrography of Monterey bay. ''It will be perceived, by referring to the general chart of the bay, that there is a deep sub-marine valley, or ''gulch,'' directly in the middle of it, wide at the mouth, (taking the fifty fathom curve,) but narrowing very much as it approaches the shore, where deep water is found close to the very beach, and we discovered that this was the only practicable landing throughout the exposed portionB of the bay." In reference to Santa Barbara channel, Commander Alden also remarks : ''It will bo seen by the Jhart of the east entrance of Santa Barbara channel that there is a similar characteristic off Point Hueneme, where tho deep water approaches the shore, and where we also found the best landing. In other words, we landed on the point without difficulty, while the bight inside of it, and to leeward, was clearly impracticable." .A.t the close of summer Commander Alden returned to the Atlantic coast on leave, and the party was assigned to the command of Lieutenant Richard M. Cuyler, United States navy, bis experienced senior assistant. Hydrography of San Francisco bay, Oal.-The southern part of the bay, which remained at the close of last season, has been sounded by the hydrographic party in charge of Commander James Alden, United States navy, in the steamer .Active and schooner Ewing. Tho greater parts of the months of March, April, and May were spent in this work. Hydrographic points and the soore·line requisite were furnished, as needed, by Sub-Assistant A. F. Rodgers. The hydrography of San Francisco and San Pablo bays is now complete. Commander .A.Iden thus reports the season's statistics of his party : Miles run in sounding ...... · ..... · ·. · . · · - · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 597 Angles measured ............ · .. · · · .. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 2, 217 · Number of soundings ........... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·' · · · · · · · · 28, 134 A line of soundings was run by the steamer Active, and a section of the bottom between the Golden Gate and the Farallones obtained by Commander .A.Iden. The resulting chart and twenty-two specimens of bottom taken along the line have been received at the office. In reference to these soundings, Commander Alden observes: ''I also noticed that two of the casts show reddish specks something similar in character to the soundings inside of the bar, (at the Golden Gate;) but as they are so remote, and the water so much deeper, I hardly think that mistakes could possibly occur." The hydrographic sheet concluding the survey of San Francisco bay, and the chart of the Straits of Ka.rquines, have been deposited in the Coast Survey office. Deep-sea temperaturea.-On the passage northward of the surveying brig Fauntleroy, a line wa.s started by ~saistant Davidson off Haven's anchorage, and carried northward and westward to latitude 39° 19' N.; longitude 128° 32' W. Twelve soundings were made, during such intervals as the weather would permit, for temperature at the surface, at ten, :fifty, a hundred, and two hundred fathoms depth. The lowest temperature (46.2 degrees) was observed in two hundred fathoms at the io-shore extremity of the line, the corresponding temperature at ten

114

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Tides.-The three permanent tidal stations, San Diego and San Francisco, Section X, and that at Astoria, in Section XI, continued to give very satisfactory results under the charge of Lieutenant N. F. Alexander, of the Corps of Engineers, until the time of his transfer by the Engineer Department to the Atlantic coast. On the 2d of August the gauges were placed in charge of Lieutenant G. H. Elliot, with the concurrence of the Chief Engineer, to whose courtesy the survey is indebted for regular tidal observations since the withdrawal of the officer who had been regularly in charge. A few days' observations, made by Sub-A.ssistant A. F. Rodgers, at Al visa, near the southern extremity of San Francisco bay, have proved of interest. Three stations in the bay have been occupied for periods of about a month in connection with the hydrographic work. At Alvisa the spring tide occasionally rises to a height of more than thirteen feet. Sub-Assistant Rodgers observes : ''That there is frequently a difference of more than an hour between San Francisco and Saucelito in the changes and actual times of high and low water, and that the tides of Napa creek and Karquines strait differ as much as an hour and a half. There is no duration of slack water in the change from flood to ebb in Karquines strait, and the other turn is very slow." L,ight-house examination.-A concluding report has been made by Commander James Alden, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in regard to the necessity for a light on the main of the Santa Barbara channel, Cal. The conclusions arrived at in his last examination, and reasons therefor, are stated in Appendix No. 57.
SECTION XI.
FROM THE FORTY-SECOND PARALLEL TO THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY, INCLUDING TH:ij: CO.AST OF OREGON AND W.ASHINGTON TERRITORIES.-(SKETOH K, No, 63.)

.Astronomical observations.-Assistant George Davidson set up the C. S. transit No. 7 at Point Pully, Admiralty inlet, W. T., for the purpose of making observations to connect with occultations. Two transits of the moon and twenty of standard and moon culminating stars were observed, but at the predicted time of the occultations the sky was clouded. The occul· tations of the Pleiades in August and September could not be observed at Point Pully in consequence of the dense smoke and cloudy weather which prevailed in the vicinity of the astronomical station. The notice of sixteen occultations made in the last season by Mr. Davidson at Port Town· shend, W. T., was not received in time to admit of being mentioned in my annual report for 1856. Triangulation of Admiralty inlet, W. T.-This work has been extended southward from its former limits by A.ssistant Davidson. His party left San Francisco, where the rainy season had been occupied in office-work, on the 1st of April, in the surveying brig Fauntleroy. The vessel encountered a succession of heavy northwest gales during fifteen days, and was compelled to return for rep.airs after unsuc· cessful efforts to reach any harbor north of San Francisco. These having been made without delay, the party reached its site of work without further detention, accompanied by Sub· Assistant J. S. Lawson, and was soon after joined by Mr. Davidson, the condition of whose health would not admit of taking passage in the vessel at the time of her departure. Mr. Lawson carried forward the reconnaissance in Admiralty inlet, pushing it southward

from the line Dolphin Point-Brace Point, and erecting signals for the triangulation and for topographical work. Assistant Davidson resumed his reconnaissance at Point Defiance, carried it through Colvos Passage to the line Hornet-Upper Steilacoom, in Puget's sound, southward; and also made a preliminary examination of Port Orchard, westward of Baiubridge island. Over a hundred signals were erected for the means of triangulation. The angular measurements were then commenced and prosecuted with various interruptions until the 1st of August, when it was found quite impracticable to continue them in consequence of the smoke from great fires, the season having been unusually dry. The work of triangulation executed within the season, as will be seen by reference to Sketch No. 63, is comprised between the south end of Bainbridge island and the line Point Pully-Point Heyer. As incidental to his regular work, Assistant Davidson made a close reconnaissance for sketching in the shore-line adjacent to his stations, observing by single pointings upon three hundred and two objects for that purpose. The following is a synopsis of the season's statistics : Number of stations occupied ... ·. · ...... · ............... ·.. . . . . . . . . 26 Number of angles measured ...... · · · · · · ... · .................... · · · · 141 Number of observations, (djrect and reversed)···· ...... · · · · · · · · ·. · · · · 6, 072 Early in August Mr. Davidson attempted to co-operate, under my instructions, with the Northwest Boundary Commission, but was again taken ill and forced to remain under medical treatment during the remainder of that month. In September he commenced at Point Wilson the connection of the triangulation of Admiralty inlet with that of the southern shore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The stations at Point Partridge and Ross were occupied by SubAssistant Lawson for connecting the light-house at New Dungeness with the triangulation. He also erected signals on the Gulf of Georgia for extending the triangulation to the line Patos-Point Whitehorn. A few observations were made by Assistant Davidson for vertical angles 11pon Mount Hood, of the Cascade range-upon Mount Ellinor, of the Olympm; range, and upon the "Brothers." The geographical position of the first not being well determined, no computation can yet be made of its height from the observations. Mouut Elliuor is stated to be 6,312 feet and the "Brothers" 6, 897 feet in height. Forty-six volumes, consisting of the original records of observations made in the triangulation of Rosario strait, Canal de Haro, and Admiralty inlet, and duplicates of the observations for azimuth at Point Hudson, and of those connected with the azimuth, magnetic, and other obser· vations at Port Townshend, New Dungeness, and Admiralty inlet, have been forwarded by Mr. Davidson within the year, and deposited in the archives of the C. S. office, with descriptions of the signals used in .Admiralty inlet and in the triangulations of New Dungeness and Port Discovery. The continued ill health of .Assistant Davidson rendering his return to the Atlantic coast advisable, he returned to San Francisco in October, and reported at the office in Washington at the end of the following month. Topograpky.-In .June, Assistant Davidson, in ch·arge of the land-work in this section, detached Sub-Assistant J. S. Lawson from his triangulation party for plane-table work on the shores of Admiralty inlet. The topography was resumed at the entrance of Hood's canal and prosecuted to a connection with Port Ludlow on the west, and around Foulweather Bluff to

Point No Point on the main shore of the inlet, on tho east. The two sheets executed have been inked and turned in at the office. They embrace twelve miles ()f shore-line, and include an area of rather more than four square miles. The country represented is covered with a dense growth of fir, and an almost impenetrable undergrowth. Assistant Davidson has also sent to the office two maps of reconnaissance made in the western part of the Strait of Fuca and in the Gulf of Georgia, and a third showing the progress of the triangulation in this section. Sub-Assistant Lawson returned to the Atlantic coast with Mr. Davidson, in November. During the progress of his triangulation work in Admiralty inlet, Assistant George Davidson, in the surveying brig Fauntleroy, discovered and partially sounded out a ten-fathom bank off the northern entrance to Colvos Pal'!sage. It lies a short distance, southward and eastward from Blake island. Mr. Davidson has named it Allen's bank, and I have placed it under that title in the list of developments of the year. Hydrography.-At the request of the Department of State, and by direction of the Treasury Department, the surveying steamer .Active, and hydrographic party in charge of Lieut. Comg. Richard M. Cuyler, U. S. K., assistant in the Coast Survey, have been placed at the disposal of the commissioner of the northwestern boundary, Archibald Campbell, Esq The prelimina· ries connected with the duties assigned to the commissioner tiave kept the vessel in employ, and but little regular hydrography has been added to the work of the section. Towards the end of the season, Lieut. Comg. Cuyler found means to commence soundings in Semiahmoo bay, lying on the forty-ninth parallel, and on the eastern side of the Gulf of Georgia. The work was retarded by rainy weather and smoke, but the hydrography of the inner harbor was completed at the middle of September. The tides of the bay were observed for two lunations in connection with the soundings. On being advised by the boundary commissioner that the services of the steamer .Active would not be further needed by him until the opening of next season, Lieut. Comg. Cuyler sailed in September for San lfrancisco, where the vessel will receive the repairs necessary to :fit her again for duty.
OFFICE-WORK.

The Coast Survey office has been, since January 20, 1857, under the charge of Captain M. L. Smith, U. S. Topographic& Engineers, with occasional intervals, during which it was under the charge of Lieut. A. P. Hill, U. S. Army, who relieved Captain H. W. Benham, of the Corps of Engineers, on the 1st of November, 1856, and directed in the office operations until January. The lucid report of Captain Smith, Appendix No. 22, gives a full account of the progress of the office-work, arranged under the heads of the different divisions, and referring, when necessary, to the sub-reports of the officers in charge of them. A reference to these reports dispenses with the necessity for more than a brief summary of the work of the several divisions of the office.

1. COMPUTING DIVISION.-This efficient division has been continued under the charge of A.sBistant 0 harks .A. Schott, and, during his absence on field service for a short time, was under that of .Assistant J. E. Hi1gard. The great amount of systematic labor performed by the employees of this division, is shown in the report of the assistant in charge of the office, and of the division.
The memoirs contributed to this report by Mr. Schott and others, in the preparation of which he assisted, are given in the Appendix Nos. 30, 31, and 32.

Of the several computers attached to t,he division, .Assistant T. W. Werner has been employed in reductions of primary and secondary triangulation and geographical positions ; JJir. Eugene Nulty on astronomical azimuths, and transits in connection with occultations of the Pleiades, and in reductions for chronometric longitudeR; JJir. James Mai'.n on magnetic observations and azimuths; JJfr. G. Rumpf on geographical positions and triangulations ; JJir. John Wiessner on the adjustments of triangulations and second reduction for latitude ; Mr. J. E. Blankenship in the discussion of magnetic results and reductions of triangulation; Mr. John T. Hoover served as clerk in the division, and assisted in miscellaneous computationR; Mr. D. Hinkle was engaged in the early part of the season in reducing triangulations. He afterwards served with my party in Section I; and, on the close of operations, was transferred to duty connected with the publication of records and results. JJ:fr. T. F. Herbert and JJfr. L. Daser a~sisted temporarily in the preparation of geographical positions for publication in thiB report; and R. Freeman was employed in copying. 2. TIDAL DIVISION.-This division, under the charge of Assistant L. F. Poitrtaks, has furnished all the tidal data required for the charts and tables, and bas continued the discussion of the observations under my immediate direction, as stated in the introduction to this report. Mr. R. S . .Avery has continued the discussion of the Boston tidal observations. Mr. C. Fendal,l was eng·aged in graphical decompositions when assigned to field duty at the end of November, 1856. Mr. G. C. Blanchard has been principally engaged in reading off and reducing observations from self-registering tide-gauges, and in other ordinary reductions and copying. Mr. R. E. Evans in decompositions and reductions. Mr. O. M. Yulee in similar duties until his resignation on the 1st of July. Mr. G. B. Vose during the early part of the season assisted in discussing the Boston tides, and in miscellaneous computations. Mr. R. T. Bassett was engaged in ordinary reductions until the end of April, when he took charge of the tidal station at New York. Mr. S. Wal.ker has been employed in graphical decompositions, and Mr. G. B. Maynadier in miscellaneous reductions. The meteorological observations turned in have been, as heretofore, tabulated by M. Thomas. 3. DRAWING D1v1sroN.-The gratifying fact is stated by the assistant in charge of the office, that this division has during the past year gained upon the field-work. It has been under the charge of Lieutenant J. C. Tidball, U. S. A., and now consists of eleven draughtsmen, a clerk, and four persons employed chiefly in tracing. The interesting remarks of Captain Smith, Appendix No. 22, in regard to the economy of labor from separating the field-work, and drawing from each other, should be referred to in this connection. Of the persons employed, .Assistant W. M. 0. Fairfax has been, as heretofore, employed on :fine topographical and hydrographic reductions ; .Assistant M. J. McOlery on first-class topography, and additions to the Congress map ; Mr. Joseph Welch on topography until the beginning of illness, which caused his death in February. Mr. J. J. Ricketts bas been engaged in hydrographic reductions and verifications; Mr. F. Herbst, until his resignation in March, was employed on the light-house map ; Mr. L. D. Williams was occupied on general coast charts and drawings of sketches ; Mr . .A. Balhach on hydrographic reductions ; Mr . .A. Liruknkohl on topography, projects and progress sketches; Mr. W. P. Schultz has made chart reductions and projections for original sheets ; Mr. L. Daser was engaged on hydrographic reductions until his transfer to the computing division in August; Mr. W. T. Martin has been engaged in topographical drawing, and on diagrams for the last annual report; Mr. A. Strausz, from the 10th of September, was employed in hydrographic drawing ; Mr. P. WiWel has been

·

118

.REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

engaged on comparative charts, progress sketches, and projections; Mr. W. Wagner was employed until May in the reduction of topography ; JJfr. F. Fairfax has reduced the topography and hydrography necessary for additions to certain charts and sketches; Mr. W. Fai1fax was engaged on sketches and tracings until June ; Mr. .A.. Schoepf and JJfr. E. Hergesheimer have worked by contract on .preliminary charts ; JJir. B. Hooe ha,. been continued on tracings ; Mr. S. B. Linton and Mr. W. T. Bright have been practiced on reductions, and also employed in tracing ; Mr. H. JfcUormick and Artificer J. .A.. Campbell have been enggged in tracings, the former until the first of April, when he left the office. 4. ENGRAVIKG DIYISION.-Twcnty-one engravers have been employed during the year in this division, nine of whom are of the first class. 'T'he division has been under the charge of Lieutenant Rufus Saxton, U. S. A.. The programme for the year included six first-class maps and numerous preliminary charts and sketches, and has been executed, with certain changes pointed out in Captain Smith's report. Forty plates were completed during the year, and twenty-nine are in progress. The office estimates that during the coming year some ten fin1tclass maps, and sixty-eight to seventy preliminary maps, charts, and sketches may be executed. A complete list of the maps anrl charts of the survey is given in Appendix No. 22, and includes two hundred and fifty-eight sheets. The following are the names and occupations of the engravers : 11fr. G. JJfcCoy has engraved the work of first-class topography and views; Mr. John Knight, titles, notes, general lettering, and the soundings on first-class charts; Mr. F. Dankworth has continued the engraving of outlines and topography; ltir. A. Rolle has been engaged on fine topography ; 1':fr. J. Enthqffer on engraving, and .lJfr . .A.. Blonde-<w in etching topography; JJfr. A. Sengteller has engraved topography and sand, and Mr. G. B. 2!fetzeroth has engraved · and etched on copper and steel, and executed views on sketches ; Mr. W. Phillips joined the office in June, and has been employed on topographical engraving; Mr. J. V. N. Throop has engraved titles, notes, and soundings; JJ1r. A. Maedel, topography and lettering; Mr. J. C. Kondru.p, outlines, topography, and notes on charts ; Jfr. H. S. Ba.t·nard, the sanding on plates, and miscellaneous work; Mr. E . .A.. Maedel joined the office on the 1st of April, and has been chiefly employed in letter engraving ; Mr. W. La,ngran, besides miscellaneous work, has engraved titles, notes, and soundings; Mr. W. Ogilvie and JJ:lr. A. Petersen have executed outlines, general lettering, and soundings; Mr. J. J. Knight was engaged on plates of preliminary charts and sketches until the 1st of August, when he left the office ; Mr: S. W. Bradley had recently completed his apprenticeship, and was engaged in general lettering until near the time of his death, which occurred on the 1st of July ; !Jfr. R. F. Bartle completed his apprenticeship in May, and has been employed upon preliminary charts and sketches ; apprentices F. W. Benner, W. .A.. Thompson, and E. Sipe have been e!Ilployed in the engraving of progress sketches, and in the practice necessary to their improveibent in the art. I have had frequent occasion to notice the devotion to duty of Mr. Edward Wharton, engaged as assistant in directing the details of the engraving division. 5. ELECTROTYPE DIVISION.-Mr. George Mathiot and two assistants have executed the entire work of this division dming the present year, including the experimental researches in photography, and engraving by phototype, which Mr. Mathiot has executed himself. The application of photography as a substitute for drawing in the reduction of maps has made good progress and yielded excellent experimental results; but we are not as far advanced in the actual practical application as a substitute for drawing as the British Ordnan-0e Survey.

I shall hopo that even before this report is published we may have reached the point desired in this important application. 6. 11fISCELLAXEOUS.-(a) Pn'.nting. Some changes, stated in Appendix No. 22, have taken place in regard to this part of the work, and it has been placed under the more immediate charge of Lieut . .A. P. Hill, U. S. A.. Twenty-two thousand two hundre<l and forty-two copies of maps, charts, sketches, and diagram:,; have been printed during the year. The printing is now executed by Mr. John Rutherdale. (b) Distribution if maps and reports.-During the year, nineteen thousand seven hundred and ninety-five impressions of map.s, charts, and sketches have been distributed, or turned over to sale agents, or for use in the office, within the past semmn. The titles and numbers are stated in Appendix Ko. 22. Mr. V. E. King has been continued in charge of the map room, and of distributing the Coast Survey reports-attending to clerical duties in the office when not thus occupied. Six thousand and eighty-three copies of the report of 18i'i.5, and thirteen hundred and twenty-five of those of 1851 to 1854, inclusive, have been distributed under act of Congress, chiefly to associations and persons connected with navigation and commerce, science, and the public service. Notwithstanding this large list, applications are daily received for copies of the report of 1855, and frequent ones for the earlier volumes, to complete sets. Those prior to 1851 are out of print; a very limited edition having been ordered by Congress. (c) Library and Archives.-These have been continued in charge of ~lfr. 0. B. Snow, who represents in his report the inconvenience resulting from the limited space which the office affords for the library and records. During the calender year, 1857, three hundred and eightynine volumes have been added to the library, of which one hundred and sixty were presented by foreign governments and scientific societies at home and abroad. (ii) Instrument shop.-This part of the office, under the charge of 1lfr. J. Vierbuchen, has ,. turned out a large amount of work during the year, of which a detailed list is given in Appendix No. 22. It includes the making as well as repairing of instruments. (e) The work in the carpenters' shop, under the charge of Mr. A. }eatman, is also stated in detail in Appendix No. 22. lieutenant A. P. Hill, U. S. A., has served as general assistant to Captain M. L. Smith in the office, replacing him during his absence, and at all times relieving him of many onerous details, and has rendered most acceptable serYioe in this position. The assistant in charge acknowledges especially the services of Mr. A. W. Russell, the principal clerk in his office. The services of .Assistant J. E. Hilgard, in charge of the publication of records and results; of Assistant L. F. Pourtaks, in charge of the tidal researches ; of Lieut. E. B. Hunt, in charge of the preparation of a scientific index of geodetic and kindred matters ; of Pref. A. G. Pendleton, in charge of the Gulf Stream records and results; and of his successor, Prof. W. P. Trowbridge, have been noticed in the introduction to this report, their work being under my immediate direction.

Lieut. W. D. Whiting, U. S. N., who served as chief of the hydrographic division of the office, was relieved in March last, and the exigencies of the naval service have not permitted the assigment of a successor. The details have been adjusted by the assistant in charge of the office and Lieutenant Hill, with the aid of a hydrographic draughtsman. It is hoped that the detail of an experienced hydrographic officer for this important position may soon be obtained.
MT. J. M. BatcluiUer has conducted acceptably various experimental inquiries in connection

120

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

with the field and office work of tho survey during the year ; notices of the more important of which have been given in the introduction. I have had more than usual cause, during the past year, to give expression to my sense of the services of Samuel Hein, esq., general disbursing agent of the survey. A more zealous and efficient officer it would be impossible to find. His method and industry in keeping the various and complicated accounts of the work are very remarkable, and while he never loses sight of economy, he avoids the extreme of crippling the operations of the work by injul:licious interference with the lawful expenditures of the parties. To my principal clerk, W. W. Cooper, esq., I would agam accord ackno\vledgments for his able and uevoted services. Respectfully submitted by A. D. BACHE, Superintendent U. S. Coast Survey. Hon. HOWELL COBB,

Secretary of the Treasury.

"~EST TrSilFRY, ~!A!'s., D1xemlJer 15, 1857. DEAR Sm : I report herewith the result of m:;· resurvey of Provincetown harbor. Cape Cod. A eareful rc,;urve:· uf the entire shore of the Cape has been made from the Hig·hlancl light in Truro. continui11g arouml the outside c:lwre to tbe Race Po~nt light, thence tu Long- Point light ancl alon~ the inner shore of the harbor, including a. resurvey of the wharves and shore line at Provincetown, and extending past East Harl1or to Pond village in Truro, nearly opposite to the Highland light. Tliis work eompril:'es a1Jout twenty mile<' of shore liiie. The general change" in the actual f'hore line are not remarkal1le; in fact, the general line of the shore is almost what it ;vas in 1849. The wind has grfldually blown away the sand hills, however, and the effect has oeen to drive the sand in upon the Cape. At Race Point consider· able change has taken place. The opening of Race Run has >Yorked nearer to the Point, and the action of the storms and the sea has been such as to beat in the beach. The shore h:u; also c·onsiderably al tercel in shape, sl10wing some change in the action of the currents and tide. The opening at Lance's harhor (so called) between Race Point and Long Point has closed, and for an extent of two and a half or three miles the beach has been driven in from a hundred to three lnmdrefl fopt. At Long Point tho sand has accumulated and the solid fence, which was built some yenn1 since from the main beach of Long Point or "\\-ood End" to the small sand spit or island i1pon which the light· house stood in 1849, lwi-; cau,;etl quite a strip of beach to be thrown up on either side of it, so that now the highest tides never overflow it. During the last summer a crop of beach g-rass \rn;,; st<ll'tP<l upon this ridge of sand. X ot only along the fence-an increased deposit of sand seems to have been made at the extremity :mo on the out8ide 8hore of Long Point.

From -Long Point no change seem!" to have occurred along the town shore excepting about East Harbor inlet. This has changed considerably, and a. strong tidal current through the opening is wearing away the f'hores of the creek :md lagoon called East Harhor. I am informed that a great quantity of sand is carried out by the ebb tide and deposited in the main harbor, and that the flats and t:hoal water in this part of the harbor are constantly increasing. There has ccrtainl:- been much shifting of sand about tlie inlet. The main channel of the creek has changed its course in one place, and cut into a drift sand hill, about forty feet in height, some three hundred feet :,;ince the survey of 1849. The most important change, however, as regards the probable consequences, if means are not taken to pre.-cnt them, i" in the outside beach opposite the "head of the meadow," a tract of mar:,;h through which the East Harbor creek winds. This marsh extends nearly to the outside shore, leaving only a low and narrow strip of beach connecting the high ground of Truro with the peninsula of Provincetown .. Opposite to the marsh and lower portion of beach the sea has encroached more from the outside than at any other place between the Highland light and Race Point. There is one point at which a cove of marsh made up from the inside, and in 1849 came within about three
hundred feet of the outside shore. . The beach here was, however, about forty feet high, pre·

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

149

l:lenting a bluff of sand towards the outside shore. This beach is now on1y about a hundred feet wide and from t\Yelve to fifteen feet high. The sea, 1 believe, broke over it durin~ a violent. storm last winter. The difference of the lc..-el of tide betweeu lhe oubide and inside of the pc·ninsula at the >'allle time is very con:::iderable, perhaps not less tlwn four or five feet even at the rnout h of East Harbor, and at the "liea<l of the meadow 11 probably the icl1ole tide. f"'l that if the Sf'.a ~honld ouce form a cha1mel H1rnut:h the lieach i1 would fk\\\· i11tu the creek awl ni,;h thrun,~li iuto tho liarbor ,,·ith great force. The effect would lie most di:>Hstrous to the harbor, such as probab1y to change its character, or perhaps entirely tlestroy it. * "" "" * Attention ~houlrl be given to the condition of this ,_1,ore at once, ant1 the importance urged of irnmedintc me:tsures to guard against the eonse(}nences of the eea lircaking through this narruw :;trip of beach. * * * * * -x* V cry respectfully, your:;, HEXHY L.

BANGOR l!Lu:rn, Orfober 17, 1857. Sm: I have the honor to communicate to the Department the result of a development made by Lieutenant Commanding C.R. P. Rodgers, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Surn;y, showing a gradual decrease in the depth of water on the shallowest part of George's shoal, off the coast and eastward of Cape Cod peninsula. The examination was made under fayonthle circumRtances, on the 10th 0f Scptcrubcr, and the resu1ts are thus reportetl by Lieutenant Commanding Rodgers: "George's shoal seems to consist of narrow sand ridges (like those at the entrance of Nantucket sound) lying parallel to each other, in a direction generally north and south, though some incline to the eastward and westward. The tide rushes across them with great violence." "We kept the steamer over the crests of these ridges, and, aided by our ex pericnce of last year, proLably found the most shallow spot, where the sountlings, reduced to mmrn low water, show a depth of only thirteen feet, or two feet less than the least found in the year 1837. The least water found differed only some seconds, either in latitude or longitude, from that found by Captain \\~ilkes, in his examination of the shoal twenty years ago.'·' I would respectfully request authority to publish this communication, as a notice to mariners.

From this examination I am able to reiterate the substance of my former report, that no bank whatever exists in that vicinity, but a ~mall portion of the wreck, not more than eight or ten feet in exteut, remains at a distance of about t"·enty yards southeast from the buoy. A. loose spar is attached to this fragment, and at slack low water it may be seen '' wa~ching '' as a buoy. During the strength of the tide this spar is carried under, so that vessels drawing not more than fifteen or eighteen feet might touch it in passing over the spot, giving the impression that no more than that depth of water covered the solid part of the wreck. This impression, however, would be erroneous, as there is a depth of twenty-three feet at mean.Jow water, and the soundings deepen at once to thirty-three feet all around it. Respectfully, WM. G.

The greatest depth that can be carried into the harbor of Beaufort, N, C., througb the main channel at mean low water, is now, as it was in 1854, fifteen and a half feet; but since that year the bar has extended towards the westward, while the southern breakers lie further to the north; so that we found from three to six feet water where the survey of 1854 shows from t'venty to twenty·three feet. The deepest water is now nearer the Shackleford Bank. The whole of the main channel, from the bar to the anchorage, has become narrowed, and off the southwest end of Shackleford Bank there is at present from four to fourteen feet, where in 1854 the soundings gave from twenty-seven to thirty feet. · A new channel across the breakers of 1854 seems to be forming to the westward of the main ship channel, from which it turns at the southwest end of Shackleford, and runs into the open sea, in a direction a little to the westward of south. Through it ten and a half feet may now be carried at low water.

153

In 1854 there was a slue to the northward and westward of it, through which eight feet could be carried, but this is now entirely closed by breakers with from three to seven feet water, where there was a depth of more than twenty feet three years ago. It seems probable that this new channel will deepen, and it is not unlikely that it may at some future day become the chief entrance to the harbor. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, C.

APPENDIX No. 17.
Report qf Lieutenant Commanding ,J. N. ~1Ia:ffitt, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, showing the result ef a re-examination ef the bias and entrances to Cape Fwr river, North Carolirui.
UNITED STATES SCHOOKER CRAWFORD,

Charle11ton, De<>ernber 19, 1856. Srn : I herewith enclose a tracing showing the result of the re-examination of the Cape Fear bar, made in accordance with your instructions of September la,;t. From a comparison of the prBsent survey with that of 1851 it would appear that the progressive deterioration of this bar within the period of five years included within the recent and previous examination by the Coast Survey, and for an interval prior, as derived from other authority, has at length reached such a point that, for all essential purposes of navigation, the old main bar channel has ceased to exist. The eighteen feet curve, from abreast of Bald Head Point, extends five hundred and eighty yards less to seaward than it did in 1851. The twelve feet curve has contracted, in the same direction, sixty-six yards. 'l'he Fingers have become connected with Marshall's shoal, and where, in 1851, there was nine, ten, and eleven feet in the channel, but five, four, a:id three feet at present can be obtained at mean low water. On spring tides, and with a northwesterly wind, this old channel is in many places awash. This entire locality has undergone a total change, and the accumulation of sand is so great that, in all probability, with the continuance of existing causes, the channel will not resume entirely the former passage way to the sea. The deterioration of this bar is, by the pilots and others, now erroneously attributed to the construction of the Bald Head jettees, whereas their erection has already supplied a most important desideratum for protecting the shore of this important locality. So long as a turning point, like Bald Head, is subjected to the abrasion of the curreut and the consequent transportation of its sand to different parts-of the channel, there ca'fbe no permanency in its direction or capacity. The security of this point will, undoubtedly, in time, insure the optming of a better and more direct channel. In fact, such are the present indications, as the pocket, or slue, which attracted your attention in 1852, has improved, and now manifests a still greater tendeney to oolnmunioo.te freely with the ocean. If I might hazard a suggestion, it would be decidedly in favor of thi; immediate prolongation of the western Bald Head jettee, with- a view

20

REPORT OF THE SUPER1NTENDENT OF

of restoring the ancient limits of that point and deflecting the ebb current through what appears a more natural channel, such as is exhibited by ·wimble' s chart of 17 38. The closing of New Inlet would, of course, be an important auxiliary. I incline to the opinion that the present condition of the main bar may be, in part, accounted for by the rapid washing away of Bald Head Point, thereby changing the direction of the channel more to the eastward, and the ebb current, freighted with sand, has, at. certain points, (the Fingers, for instance,) encountered an ocean currnut, which, after an easterly blow, is very rapid to the westward, over Frying Pan shoals. .A.t this point of meeting the ebb is exhausted aml the <lepu::iit occurs. Of course, the greater the abrasion at Bald Head, the greater the deflection of tbe chnnnel from its natural course, the more the tidal current would be diffused, and consequently tho less would be its scouring power. The pocket, or slue, has made ;;ea·ward, and, as it demonstrates, through the narrowest part of the bar. An opening hero would seem to give promise of a good and safe channel, such as existed in the same place in 1738, prior to the opening of Xew Inlet and wearing away of Bald Head. The further extension of the jettees towards this opening would unquestionably insure the re:mlt desired. It is certain that no injury can be occasioned to the bar by the experiment proposed. The valuable commerce of Wilmington, and interests connecting through that city ·with a large and wealthy section of the State, demand that prompt attention be given to the improvement of the Cape Fear entrance. The Coast Survey chart of 1852 gives the following differences on the old bar, as compared ·with the present examination: The eighteen feet curve has contracted seaward four hundred and ninety yards ; the twelve feet curve in the same direction eleven yards ; and in the channel way, for instance, where the outer buoys were located with seven, eight, nine, and ten feet between them, but five, four, and three feet now exist at mean low water, which change, as compared with the chart of 1851, shows the deterioration to be progressive but irregular. The slue, in 1851, had a mean depth of six feet, and the distance from its inner six feet curve to its outer six feet curve was nine hunched and eighty-four yards. The twelve feet curves (outer and inrier) were then separated by a distance of fifteen hundred and eighty-six yards. In 1852 an evident improvement had commenced, as will be observed, from the fact that the distance betweel' the inner and outer six feet curves was but four hundred and five yards, a difference at once in sfavor of five hundred and eighty yards, in reference to this particular curve of six feet. The twelve feet curve had not changed, as shown by comparison of the charts of 1851 and 1852. It will be seen by the. present chart (1856) that this slue has continued to improve in genera~ capacity since 1852, the distance between the outer and inner e.ix feet curves being now only two hundred and fourteen yarda ; and the twelve feet curves are separated by only nine hundred and eighty-four yards, giving thus an extension of the water passage seaward of considerable importance. Reeper' s shoal, on its east side, is generally bare at low water. It assists in confining the ebb current to its work of dredging out the slue, and serves at the same ti.me as a breakwater against the influence of the heavy easterly waves; the "Middle Ground" affording the same facilities on the west s~e. As the direction of this anticipated outlet over the narrowest part of the bar is not in positive opposition to the coast ebb and flood current, a deposit, such as has occurred in the old main channel, could not reasonably he anticipated, for the increased capacity of the ebb current by the closing of the new infot, and &11 the dredging resouNes of the riv~r thus -00ncentrated would, as a natural oOJM!equ.ell®, foxce tbe.-entire bar further seaward into deeper water.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

155

The western channel has undergone but little change. Its present capacity is ten feet at mean low water. On the Rip there is a depth of eight feet, but its fluctuations in direction and depth are very frequent. Changes occur almost monthly, the Rip being particularly sulJject to the influence of southerly gales. The pilots are forced to give constant attention, in consequence of its Yariable character. I am convinced that no improv®J.ent c-ould be made in this locality offering the slightest hope of permanency. The ":Middle Ground" has not changed matcriall~· since the last survey. The shore line at :Bald Head has kept pace with the "jettees," and the "wattling" to the eastward has fulfilled the purpose designed in the accumulation of sand, and the consequent extension seaward of the high water mark. l{ew Inlet.-The shore line about this inlet has changed remarkabl~- since m;· former survey, and should he retraced by the plane table. ¥\-~here the wharf at Zeek' s island now stanrls the Coast Survey chart of 1851 gives fifteen feet ; and so rapid ~Yas the accumulation of sand soon after the wharf was constructed, that it ceased to be of use for the landing of material& required for the closing of the .-Iue:;;, and an extension some fifty-five ,vanh; further into the channel became necessary. The shore line follo"-ed the wharC and now there is but four foct depth at its outer end. On the Federal Point side, opposite to Zeek's island wharf, the shore has made to the southward some two hundred and twenty yards. New Inlet has narrowed since 1851 about three hundred and seventy-five yards. Tl1e closing of the inlets to the southward of Zeek' s island has been successfully accomplished, and the ebb and flood cntirel:1 shut off from those former paBrng-c wa~-s, the result of "·hich is to feed New inlet with an additional amount of Hood. The pilots have conceived the itlea that the closing of the two ,;mall inlets bas been of n'!arked benefit to Xew Inlet bnr. Be tbat as it may, the bar has certainly undergone noticeable changeB, and has increased one foot in mean depth since 1852. The entiro channel has shifted to the northward five hundred and fourteen yards since 1851. It now rnns where the Middle Ground was in 1851 rrnd 1852. Carolina shoal has follo,vecl the shifted channel, and extends castwardly two hundred and seventy-three yards further than in 1851. The W.S. W. point of the Middle Ground has been washed away for about three hundred and ninety-four yards, and \vhere depths ol' five and six feet occurred in 1851, twenty and twenty-one feet can now be found. Federal Point channd has narrowed until it is nearly closed, and at the same time shifted to the northward. New Inlet channel is now, in its narrowest part, between the six feet r:urvee<, tw<0 hundred and eighty-four yards wide ; in 1851 it was only one hundred and Rixty-four yards. In 1851 the narrowest part of the channel, abreast of Zeek's island wharf, from six feet curve to six feet curve, was three hundred and thirty-two yards. ~l\_t present, in the narrowest part of the same locality, the distance is, from six feet curve to six feet curve, one hundred and ninetyseven yards. The bulkhead athwart the mouth of New Inlet has undergone some few changes, none, however, of conseq_uence, excepting a prolongation of the southern spit of about one hundred and sixty-four yards, thus lapping entirely the mouth of New Inlet. In reference to the very decidedly improved state of this bar, .I am inclined to think it due only to the continuance of recent strong southerly winds; for I have long observed that when the wi11d blows with violence frOl\l.. the· nG:rthward .~ eaatwru;d, N·w I.nl·t bar decr.ea.ses in. dept.a, while lbe w~tern .channel

TIDE TABLES.

For the use ef navigators, prPpared fmm the Coast Surrey obscr1.:alio11s, lYjj .A.. D. Bache, Super·in tenden t.
[Furnished, by authority of the Treasury Department, to E. & G. W. Illunt, New York, and revised January, 1857.J

The following tables will enable navigators to ascertain the time and height of high and low water in some of the principal ports in the United States. Tho results arP approximate, t11c observations being still in progress, but they may Rafely be used for practical purposes. The number of places of observation, and the time during which many of them have been made, are steadily on the increase as the Coast Survey advances. The tides of the coast of the UnitBd SwtteR, on tlrn Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific, are of three different classes. Those of the Atlantic are of the most ordinary type, ebbing and flowing twice in twenty-four hours, and having but moderate differences in height between the two successive high waters or low waters---one occurring before noon, and the other after noon. Those of the Pacific coast also ebb and flow twice during hrnnty-four hours, but the morning and afternoon tides differ very considerably in height ; so much so that at certain periods a rock which has three feet and a half water upon it at low tide, may be awash on the next succeeding low water. The intervals, too, between successive high and successive low waters rnay be very unequa.l. The tides of ports in the Gulf of Mexico, west of Cape St. George, ebb and fl.ow, as a rule, but ouce in twenty-four hours, or are single-day tides. At particular parts of the month there are two small tides in the twenty-four hours. The rise and fall in all these ports is small. East of Cape St. George the rise and fall increases ; there are two tides, as a rule, during the twentyfour hours, and the daily inequality, referred to in the Paeifie tides, is large. These peculiarities require a different way of treating the cases, and in >ome of them separate tables.

I propose to enable the navigator to find, from the Nautical Almanac and the following tables, tthe time and height of high and low water at any date within the ordinary range of difference produced by winds and other variable circumstances. I will endeavor to divest the matter of nnfamiliar technical expressions as far as practicable, though, for shortness t>ake, some t>uch termi,; :tnay be employed after defining them. The discussion of the Gulf tides has not been carried so far as to enable me to present the results in as definite a form as the others.

158

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

As is well known, the interval between the time of the moon's crossing the meridian (moon>s transit) and the time of high water at a given place is nearly constant ; that. is, this interval varies between moderate limits, which can be assigned. The interval at foll and change of the moon is known as the establishment of the pmt, and is ordinarily marked on the charts. As it iR not generally the aveTage of the interval duTing a month's tide, is a less convenient and less accurate quantity for the use of the navigator than the average interval which is used. on the Coast Survey charts, and is sometimes called the "mean'' or "corrected establishment.'"* The following taulc gives tho principal tidal quantities for the di.fferent ports named in the first column, where they are arranged under specific heads. The third column of the table gives the moan interval, in hours and minutes, between the moon's transit and the time of high water next after the transit ; the fourth, the difference between the greatest and least interval occurring in different parts of the month, (lunar.) A simple inspection of this column will show how important it is to determine these changes in many of the ports wl1ere they amount to more than half an hour, or to more than fifteen minutes, for the average interval. The fifth, sixth, and seventh columns refer to the height of the tide. The fifth gives, in feet, the average rise and fall, or ayerage difference between high and low water. The sixth gives the greatest difference, commonly known as the rise and fall of spring tides ; and the seventh the lea;;t difference, known as tlie rise and fall of the neap tides. The average duration of the flood, or rising tide, is given in the eighth column; of the el)b, or falling tide, in the ninth ; and of the period during which the tide neither rises nor falls, or the "stand," in the tenth. The duration of flood is measured from the middle of the stand at low water to the middle of the stand at high wateT, so that the whole duration from one high water to the next, or from one low water to the next, should be given by the sum of the numbers in the eighth and ninth columns. At most of these places given in the list, a mark of reference has been established for the height of the tide. I have omitted the description of these marks, (except in the following localities,) as of no particular interest in this connection.

The foregoing Table I gives the means of determining, roughly, the time and hci.£rht of hid1 water at the Rcveral ports named. The bour of tramit of tlic· moon preceding the time of liigh water is to be taken from the Almanac, and, the mean establi,.lnnent l~eing added, the time of high water 1·e1mlts. ThnB : Example I.-It is required to find the time of high water at Xew York on the 5th of J\oycm· lier. 1854. The Amcric'.an Almanac giveR Oh. Om. as the tim0 of transit of the moon on that day. The mean interval for Kew York, from Table I, column 3, is oft. 13m., whicl1, as the transit "·as at Oh., is roughly the tin:ie of hig}1 water. The moon being full, the height is that of i:;prinf! tides of column 6, name!;·, 5. 4 feet. If tho soundingR on the cJrnrt arc reduced to low water spring tide,,, 5.4 feet is to he added to them, to give the depth at high ·water. If the soundiugs <lre reduc,ecl to rmmn luw WC\teL the rise a.nd foll for mean tides being l.1 foot lesi' than for RpTings, the rise or i11crnase of <lepth will be half of thi><, or 0. G of a foot les::: than 5.4 feet, which is 4. 8 feet. or near!;· 4 feet 10 inclie><. Example IL-Required, the time of high water nt Bo~ton on the 2;)r! of .Januar:·, lf\fll. From the Americ<m Almanac we find the time of the moon's southing, or trau~i t. 011 that day. 5h. IS m. a. m., and from Tnble I tbe mean interval at Boston dry dock is 11li. 27m. We liavc tl1en 511. 18111. time of transit; To which add 11 27 rneau interval from Table I. lG 45 time of hig;h water, or -!li. 45m. p. m. If the Greenwich Nautical Almanac: is used, adll 2111. to the timo of transit of Greenwich for every hour of ·west Iong:itude, and its proportional part fur lo~s than :rn hour. lt will suffice to take the half hour whid1 mar be over anr numlJer of lwurn, as the eorrcction for lesR than this would be less than one minute, and need not be taken into account. Thu,. Be>ston is 471. 4-4-m. west of Greerrn'ich. The correction to be applied to th0 time of transit of the moon is, for the four hours, eight minutes, and for the 44m .. one minute. The time of tranRit, on thi: date assumed in the preceding example, is 177i. 9m. of the 22d, or 5h. 9t11. 11. m. of the 23d ; to '~hich add nine minutes, the correction just found, g;ives 5li. 18m., ns before ascertained from the .American Almanac.

In using the United States :N"autical Almanac, in th.i astronomical part of ,,·hicl1 the transits of the moon are given for the meridian of Wa~hington, the corrections required may, in this
first approximation for the Atlantic coast, be neglected. To find the time of the next following low ·water add. from Table I, the duration of ebb tide. This gives 4lt. 45m. p. m., time of l1igh water. 6 13 duration of ebb tide, from Table I .

10 58 p. 111. By subtracting the durntion of Rood tide, we obtai11 the time of tl1e preceding loi.v water, lOh. 32m. a. m., recollecting that 4h. 45m. p. m. is the same as Hih. 45m. reckoned from midnight .
. The height of this tide, corresponding to th trausit of 511., will bring it nearly to a neap tide, and the rise and foll obtained from column 7, Table I, is 8. 5 feet . . The next following high water may be had by adding to the time of low water the duration Df fiood, from Table I, thus ;

·

1071. 58m. p. m. time of low water 23J of January. 6 13 duration of flood, from Table I. Sum 17 11 or 51.. llm. a. m. on the 24th of January.

Or, haviug found the time of high water, the time of the next following high water may Le found by adding the duration of flood and of ebb together, and tlieir sum t6 the time of high water fouud, thus : 6h. 13m. duration of ch b tide, from Table I. 6 13 duration of flood. 12 26 duration of wl1ole tifle. 4 45 p. m. January 23, time of high water. 17 11 or 5h. llm. a. m. 24th January, time of the !1e:x:t succeeding high water. Subtracting the same quantity will give the time of the preceding high water. Thus: 4h. 45m. p. m .. or lGk 4511:.. from midnight, is the time of high water. 1:; 26 the duration of flood and ebb. a. m. of the 23d for the preceding high water. The duration of the flood and ebb being reckoned from the middle of one stand or slack water to the middle of the ne:x:t, the time of begirrniug of staud of ebb or flood will be found l1y rnl·tracting half the duration of stand or o;lack ·water given by column 10, Table I, from the time of high or low water, and the time of the end of stand of ebb or flood by adding the S3.mo. A nearer approximation to the times and heights of high water may be obtained by the use of Tables II and III.

In these, the variations in tl1e interval between the mmm' R transit and Jiigh water are shown for some of the principal port::' contained in Table I. These variations of interval depend upon the age of the moon, :md as tbey go through their value" in half a lunar month, are known as the half-monthly inequality of interval. The table extends from Oh. of transit, mitluig;ht of the calendar day, or full of the moon, to 11~ hours. The numbers for "change'' of the moon correspond to those of 0 hours, and for 13 hours (01~ 1 p. m. of the calendar day) to 1 hour, and 0 " on up to 23 hours. The ports for which tho numbers arc given are designated by the heading of the columns.

The mean interval, it will be seen, does not occur at full and chang-c, but near].'~ two days afterward, on the Atlantic coast. _A.t Key West it. occurs more nearly at full and change, and at San Francisco still more nearlv. The same remark applies to heights; spring tides occur about two days after the full and change of the moon, and neaps two days after the first and last quarter.

REPORT OF TltE SUPERINTENDENT 01'

The use of this tab1e of nearer approximation is quite as simple as that of Table I. Rule to.find the time ql ltiyh zcater.-Look in the Almanac for the time of moon's transit (or southing) for the date required. In the table corresponding to that time will be found tho number to be added to the time of transit. E:cample III.-Reqnired the time of high water at New York, October 1, 1856. Using the United States Nautical Almanac, we find the time of moon's transit Iii. 24m., astronomical reckoning, or Ilt. 24m. p. rn. calernfar time. From Table II, we have, under the heading of New York for lh. 30m., (the nearest number to lh. 24m. in the table,) 8h.. 1 Om. Thus to 1/1. 24m., time of moon's transit, Add 8 IO interval found from Table III.
34 p. m., is the time of high water on the lst of October, 1856. The sum, 9 --If the !'Um of thei:;e numbers had exceeded twelve, the tide wonlcl have belouged to October 2d, and we must. have gone back to the transit of the day before, and computed with it, to obtain the tirle nf Odober l,.;t. Rule tofi11d the hcir1M qf kigh 1rnter.-E11ter Table III, column 1, with the time of mr101i':> tran,,it. In the column headed with the name of the place, and marked .ti, 'vill be found the rise and fall corre;;:ponding; to tl1e time of ira11sit ; i11 column B, the numlier to be added to soundings on the chart, wheni the wuudings are given for mean low water; in column C, the numher to be added to charts of which the soundings are giYen for low water, Rpring tides. In the foregoing example, (III,) the time of transit being between I and 2 hours, we find, from Table III, the rise and fall of the tide on the I st of Octoher, 185G, between 4. fl and 4. 7 ; the number to be added to ;;otmdiugs given for mean low water 4. 5 feet, (column B,) and for low water spTing tides, (column C,) 11. 9 feet. Raving found the time of hig-h \Yater, that of low water may be obtained nearly by adding the duration of eb1J from C<llumn 9, Tahle I. The time of the next preceding low ~Yater may be found b;; subtracting the duration of flood from col11mn 8, Table I. 'l'he time of the next following, high water rm1y lw fouucl by adding the duration of l·oth flood and ebb, and of the next preceding high water, l·y sulJtracting the same duration of the whole tide. Example IY.-To find the next high water following that of Example III. The duration of flood, column 8, Tltble I, for New York, is 6h. Om. ; and of ebb, from column 9, is G/1. 25m. ; the sum is 12'1. 25m. To 9k 34m. p. m., October 1, the time of high water found, Add 12 25 duration of flood and ebb. Sum, 21 59, or 97i. 59m. a. m. of October 2, the time of the next high water.
TIDES OF THE PACIFIC COAST.

On the Pacific coast there is, as a general rule, one largo and one small tide during each day, the height" of t\\-o successive high waters occurring one a. m. and the other p. m. of the same twenty-four hours, and tho intervals from the next preceding transit of the moon are very different. These inequalities depend upon the moon's declination. They disappear near the time of the moon's declination being nothing, and are greatest about the time of its being greatest. 'l'he inequalities for low water are not the same as for high, though they disappear and have the greatest value at nearly the same times. When the moon's declination is north, the highest of the two high tides of the twenty-four

TUE UNITED STATES COAST SL'RVEY.

hours occurs at San 'rancisco about eleven and a half hours after the moon's southing, (transit;) and when the declination is south, the lowest of the two high tides occurs at al>out ihai i11tervul. The lowest of the two low 'vaters of the day is the one which follows next-the highest high water. The nature of tlwse tides will probably appear more plaiuly from the anr1exc;<l di~1grams. In them the height of the tide is i:;et off at the >iicle on a ~cale of feet, ::rn<l the hour1; of the day are at the top. .At XII noon, for example, the tide-gauge marked 6. 7 feet. Joining all the heights observed in the twenty-four hours, ·we have a curve like that marked in the :figure. The two high waters arc a and c, and tho two low waters b and d, If a is tho high water which occurs about twelve hours after the tran;::it of the moon, when the declination is south, the euh ab is quite ;;mall, and the high water a is much lcrwer than the next high water c. If the moon's declination is north, it is the larg-e hig:h water a of the second diagram, which occurs next after the tran«it, and about twelve hours from it. ' ! 11! Tables IV and V give the number to be added to the time 7i Gi of moon' R transit, to find the time of high water almost as 51 readily as in the former case. It is one of double eutry, the time of transit being, as before, placed in the first colnm11. The number of days from the day at which the moon has :\ I had the greatest declination is arnmp:ed at the top of the -z [ ! I ' 1 table. Entering the first. column witli the time of transit, [ \ un<l following tho line horizontally until we come under the "i I :1,-i ~ column contai11i11g the days from the greatest declination, we :find the number to bo added to the time of transit to give the time of high water. If the moon's declination is i>outh, Table rv is to be used ; if north, 'l'ablo v. Tables IV to IX, inclusive, havo been recomputed, using more complete data for the inequalities ahove referred to.

If we disregard the daily inequality, the column headed San Francisco in Table II would give us, as in the examples on the Atlantic coast, the means of determiuing- the time of high water.
ExamplP V.-Rcquinod the time of high watc>r at Korth Beach, San FranciE<co, C,difornia, on the 7tl1 Fehruary, 1853. 1st.

Hlm.; requiring a correction of lGm. to the time of trnu:oit for San Francisco, "·hich is thus found to be IH. 57m. 2d. The moon's declination is south, and at tlw time of transit about two day:o,: after the gref!test. Entering Table IY, we find 1271. (oT 071.) of trnn,-it, thP nearest number to 1171. 5711i. which the table gives ; and following the liue horizontally until ffe come to t\\·o days after t.he great declination we find 137t. lOm.

The days from greatest declination are written in the first and last columns of the table. The second, third, and fourth columns refer to south declination, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh to north. The si;cond column gives the number whil'h is to be adde<l aecordin;r to tlic declination to the time of high water obtained b.Y mean,.; of Tahle,; IV and V, to give tlie411ext low water, which is the small low water b of Diagram I. The third contains the numbers to be added to the same, to give the second or large high water c of Diagram I. The fourth, the numbers to be added to the same, to give the second or large low water d of Diagram I. The succeeding columns give the uumlJCrs to Le used in the same way for north r1eclinations, to obtain the low water b (large) of Diagram II, the high 1vater c (small) and the low \Yater d (small) of the same diagram. The rise and fall of the same ,.;uccessivc tides ma_'." be ohtaine<l by inspection from Tahle IX, in which the first column, at the side, contains the time of tran:"it, and the ;,;ucces,;ive columns the numbers corresponding to that time and to the numl>er of days from g-reatei"t declination. The arrangement of this fable is like that already given. The numbers for the small ebb tide ab of Diagram I, or c d of Diag-ram II, are first given; then those for small low and large high water b c of Diagram L anrl rl e of lliaµ;ram II ; next the large e1L tide c d of Diagram I or ab of Diagram 11; and la,.tly, from the large low wate'r to the small high water d e of Diag-ram I, or b c of Diagram II.

Example YII.~Thus, in Example YI, the high water of February 7 was found to be 2. 8 feet above mean low water. The declination being south, Diagram I applies, and thi~ high water is the small one. To obtain the fall of the next low water, or small low water, we enter Table IX with Oh. of moon's transit., and two days after greatest declination in tho first part of the table, and find 2.3 foet, which will be the difference in height of this high and low water. Entering with the same transit and day in the second part, wo find 3.3 feet, which is the rise of the large high water a hove the small low water ; the di:fforence between 2. 3 feet and 3. 3, or 1.0 foot, is the difforonco of height of the two successive high waters. It is easy to me hffw, in this way, tho souncliugs of a chart can bo reduced to what they would be approximately at all the successive high arnl low waters. A sirnihtr set of tables is in preparation for Key West and some of the other ports on the Gulf of Mexico, where the tides are of the same character. The tidal observations now in progress on the Pacific will give the means of extending the tables to all the principal ports there.
TlDE8 OF THE ffCLP OF MEXICO.

On the coast of Florida, from Cape Florida, around the Peninsula, to St. Mark's, the tides are of the ordinary kind, but with a daily inequality which, small at Cape Florida, goes on increasing as we proceed westwa1·d to the Tortugas. From the Tortugas to St. Mark's the daily inequality is large and sensibly the same, giving the tides a great resemblance to those of the J>acific coast, though the rise and fall is much smaller. Between St. Mark's and St. George's island, Apalachicola entrance, the tides cha.nge to the single day class, ebbing and flowing hut once in the twenty-four (lunar) hours. At St. George's island there are two tides a day, for three or four days, about the time of the moon' 8 declination being zero. At other times there is but one tide a day, with a long staud at hig~t water of from 6 to 9 hours. l!'rom Cape St. Blas, to and including the mouth of the Missisllippi,

· the single day tides are very regular, and the small and irregular double tides appear only for
two or three days (and frequently even not at all) about the time of zero declination of the moon. The stand at high and low water is com para ti vely short, seldom exeeediug au hour. To the west of the mouth of the Mississippi the double tides reappear. A.t Isle Derniere they are distinct, though a little irregular, for three or four days, near the time of the moon's zero declination. At all other times the single day t.Ype prevails, the double tides modifying it, however, in the shape of a long stand of from 6 to 10 hours at high water. This stand is shortest at the time of the moon's g-rcatest declination, Botnetimes being reduced to but one hour. At Calcasieu the tideR are diRtinctly double, but with a large daily iner1uality. The rise and fall being small, they would often present to the ordinary observer the same a11pear:mce as at Isle Derniere. At Galveston the double tides are plainly perceptible, though small for five or six days, at the time of moon' e zero dedination. At other times they present the single day type, with the peculiarity that, after standing at high water for a short time, the 'vater falls a small distance and stands again at that height for several hours, then continues to fall to low water. Sometimes it falls very slowly for nine or ten hours following high water, and then acquires a more rapid rate to low water. At Aransas PaBs and BrazoB Santingo the single day tides prevail. Small, irregular double tides are only perceiYed for two or tl1rec da;n; at moon'" zero of declination. At other times there is but one high water in the day, 1\·ith a long :4and of from six to nine hours, during which there are often Rmall irregular fluctuations or a very Rlnw fall. In the following table the mean rise and fall of tides at the above stati011t' are gi\·en. The highest high and the lowest low waters occur when the greatest declination of the moon happens at full or change; the least tide when the moon's declination is nothing d't tlie first or last quarter. The rise and fall being so small, the time8 and heights arc both much influenced by the ·winds, aud are thus often rendered quite irregular.

REPORT 01!' THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

TO DETERMINE THE RISE AND F.U,L OF THE TIDR FOR ANY GIVEN TIME b'H01[ HIGH OR LOW WATER.

·

It is sometimes desirable to know how far the tide will ri8o in a given time from low water or full in a given time from hi§!;h water, or to approximate to the time which has elapsed from' low or high water, by knmYing the rir:;e or fall of the tide in the interv<tl. If the proportion of the ri;;e and fall in a given time were the same in the different ports, this would eaRily be shown in a single table giving the proportional rise and fall, which, by referring to table I, showing the rise and fall of the tide at the port, would give the ri~e and fall in feet and decimals. 'l'he proportion, lwweyer, is not the same in different ports, nor in the same portR for tide« of different height~. The followi11g Table XI, show8 the relation l.ietween the heights above low water for each half hour for New York and for Old Point Comfort, and for spriug and neap tides at each place. Units exp1:e~s the total rise of high ·water above low wa,tc1·, and tht· figures opposite to each half hour denote the proportional fall
of the ti(k from high water onward to low iYater. For example, at New York, three hourd after high water, a spring tide ha,; fallen six-tenths (sixty-hundredths) of the whole fall. Sup pose the whole rise and fall of that day to be 5.4 feet, (Table I;) then, three hours after high water, tlw tide \vill have fallen 3.24 feet, or three feet thref: inches, nearly. Conversely, if we have observed that a spring tide has fallen three feet three inches, we may know that high water has passed about three hours. TABLE XI,

TIDES IN COASTING.

By observing the times of high and low water al6'11g the coast, we find the places at which they are the same. The map of cotidal lines Rhows that it is high water nearly at the same hour all along our coast, from Sandy Hook to Cape Canaveral; of course, not in the bays and harbors and up the rivers, but on the outer coa1:1t. It is high water exactly at the same hour all along the
1ine marked XII seen on the chart, near Sandy Hook, and north, and south of Hatteras, and, with small interruptions, at Cape Lookout and Cape Fear, all the way to near Cape Canaveral·

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

173

This same line extends eastward to near Block island and south of Nai1tucket, and then pa,sses aw:ty from our coast. At full and change of the moon, along this liuc, (approximately,} it is high water at XII o'clock, Greenwich tinh~, the local time of high water depending upon the longitude of the place ; or, to speak mnrc corrcctl~', in the average of a lunar month, it is high water so many hours after the time of the moon's passing the meridian of Greenwich. By these linei'1, called co-tidal lines, we can determine ·whnt tidal currents the navigator must expect to meet in coasting, and for thiR purpose we divide the ports of the coast into two sets-those south and those north of New York. The sailing lines of coasters bound to southern ports this side of the straits of Florida are marked upon the map, and also of those bound through the sounds to caRtern ports, and, outside, to Halifax and European portR.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The co-tidal lines are in Ruch directions that at 10, 20, and 30 milm1 from the coast, between Sandy Hook and the St. John's, there is but a variation of seven minutes, and ~vcn to Cape Canaveral ouly of eight minutes. Keeping ten miles frum the shore, the coaster would pass from XII hours at Sandy Hook to XI hours 45 minutes at Hatteras, and increase again irregularly to XU hourR 7 minutes at the St. John's, as shown more explicitly in the Table B. These three tracks of 10, 20, and 30 miles are inside of the cold wall of the Gulf Stream, and genera1ly in the cold current, except at Cape Canaveral.

It follows, then, as a general ibiug, from these two taules, that the coaster, in passing from Sandy Hook to the St. John's, would l;iave the tides the same, within soll!e fifteen minutes, mi if he remained at Sandy Hook. So that leaving, for example, at high water, he would, ac· cording to the elapsed time, have the ebb and flood alternating every six hours and a quarter, nearly, as if he had remained near Sandy Hook. As the flood tide sets in generally to.the north· ward and on shore, and the ebb tide to the southward and off shore, he would know l1y the time that ela,pl-5ed from his departure, and the period of the tide at which he started, what tidal currents he might expect to meet as he passed along the coast. This, of course, is not peculiar to Sandy Hook as a point of departure, but would be true for any of the entrances given in the table, taking care not to mistake the times of tides within for that at the entrance. By referring to George W. Blunt, Esq., I have obtained. the tracks of sailing and steam vessels passing from New York to ports south of it, as shown by the lines on the chart accompanying this paper. Trncing these on the map o( co-tidal lines, I have determined .how the navigator

would find the tides as he passes from port to port. The results are shown in the annexed table, (C,) in which the port between which and Sandy Hook the mariner passes, is at the bead of the table, and, at the side, the place off which the co-tidal hours will be found, as stated in the table.

Thus, from Sandy Hook to Delaware bay, starting with XU hours 5 minutes, off Barnegat there would be, at the same instant, XI hours 57 minutes, and off Cape May XII hours 10 minutes ; Ro the navigator would have the same succes8ion of tides, whether he remained at Sandy Hook or passed onward to Delaware bay, or whether he came from Delaware bay to Sandy Hook. So, from Sandy Hook to Charleston, he would find, at the same instant, XII hours 5 minutes at Sandy Hook, XI hours 57 minutes off Barnegat, XI hours 45 minutes off Cape May, and so onward upon the parallels of latitude for the several points. For all pradiool purpo;!es, then, ef coo.sting, the success-ion q/ the tides, and, ef c<mrse, ef the tidal currents cf flood and ebb, 'will be the same aB if the navigator remo,i·1wd stutionary. Leaving at low water, he will meet the flood for six hours and 15 minutes, and then the ebb for another 6 hours and 15 minutes, and so 0 !1· It is t.he simplest of all rules that has thus come out of this investigation.

The coasting line of thirty mileo: keeps inside of the cold wall all the way to Canaveral, and all the route;; traced on the chart from Sandy Hook to southern ports are inside of it. The Gulf Stream lineR drawn on the chart show how the route to Bermuda and to the Bahamas cuts the alternate bands of warm and cold wate·r of the Gulf Stream.

VesseL'i to and from ports east of New York.
The plate Rhows the sailing lines of vessels bound from N cw York to eastern ports and to Halifax, outside. The annexed tahle (E) gives the Greenwich times of high water off the several points named in the first column on the routeR to and from the places named in the heading of the table. The distances are measured at 1·ight angles to the co-tidal curves.

In passing from Ke"· York to :m ea~tern port, the first great eh(mg·e in the tiJes and tidal currents is between the East ri.-er and Lollg I~land Sound ; the difference between GoYernnr· s island and Negro Point, on \Yard',; island, at the ea,,; tern entrance to lldl Gate, i,.; 2 hours and 45 minutes. Between this point and Thrng·s Point the change is small. The mariner i,.; rww in the full tide of the Sound, and between Throg' s Point a11d Fisher's island there is a difference of time of but 2 hours and 20 minutes, the greatest part of which i:-; at the head of the Sound and at its entrance, that is, neaT Throg's Point nnd Fi"hE'r's i:-<fond. From off :Sew London to off Sand's Point the difference is but 1 hour and 40 minutes; i'O that if the mari1wr, instead of remaining at Throg' s Point, pa~ses ornnud to Fisher's ishmd, he ·would lose but half a tide in tlw 'd10le passage. In other word:;, he would Jmye the same succession of rise and foll, accordinl-" to the time elapsed, whether stationary or pas;;ing onward within two hours aud a hnlf, or lcsi-' than half a tide. The tidal current lines show that oven a le,;i,; allowance is to be rnadt' for tht· change of current than for the change of tide, the difference in the change of cun-enr hctweon Throg'11 Point and F'isher'is island along the middle of tlw Sound being of 110 prRctical importance. Passing out of Long Island Sound, the tidal hour:-: grow eRrlier, until off Block island that of Sandy Hook is again reaclw<l. The co-tidal line of SanJy Hook and Block island being the same, it is the struggle of the same lide through Xew York bay and the narro,,· East riYer and obstructed Rell Gate, and throug·h l<'isher' s island and Long Island Sound and to Throg:· s Point. The tidal currents meet near Throg's Point. The lower part of Narragansett bay has the co-tidal hour XII hours nearly. Buzzard's bay has nearly the same co-tidal hour, the tide-wave reaching the shores at nearly the same time all around t.he bay. It wonld be impossible to give in a small compas:> a minute account of the tides of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Sounds. In general, it may he said that a;; far as Holmes' Hole and Wood's Hole. they resemble those of Block Ishmd Sound, and afterwards thoRe of Monomoy, at the eastern e,ntra~ce i but this generalization iR un8atisfactory without more details than there is space here to give. In these Sounds tak0;; plRee the remarkable change of between three and four hours, the great change of our coast, di:3locating, as it were, the tinw,; of high water at places south and west, and east and north of Nantucket. The whole of thi,; change takes place between the eastern entrance of N ant.ucket Sound and the western of Martha's Vineyard, giving rise t.o quite a complex condition of both tideR and currents, which it ha11 occupied much time to unravel.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The dominant co-tidal line of 01ir coast. ftl>m Block islnnd to Cape CunaYeral, is tlrnt of XII hours of Greenwid1 time; that of our ea"tern coal't, from Xantucket to Pas><amaqnod<ly, iR in general XY hours. Passi11p; out of Nanfucket Sonm1, coa:;ter" carr.Y 11earl_.,- the same co-tidal hour to Cape Cod, and theni:e vnr;· their time aliout half an hour in pussing to Boston, to Portsmouth, to Portland, or to Pas,;arnaquoddy. It has been long knlrn·u that tl1e tidal Almanac fur Hrn<ton mig·ht practically be used for eastern ports. Y es:'lcls from :'.\ow York to Halifax. (and X cw York io Europe,) which keep outside, and should keep well uff the Nantucket shoals, and ofl:' George's, a::: shown by the track on the chart, vary their co-tidal hour lmt little, keeping between the lines of XII and XI~ until quite well on their course A.nd beyond Cape Sable. The same rule will apply to their case a~ has been given for vesseb lietween ::\ew York and a southern irnrt.

APPENDIX No. 22.
Report qf Captain M. L. Smith, lJ. S. Topographiccd Engineers, assistant in charge (!f tlie Coa.st Survey qtfice, and extracts from sub-reporf8 qf chir;t~s qf the qffice dii·i8ions.
COAST Sl"RYEY OFFICE. Octol!f'r 31. 1851. Sm : In submitting to .'·ou the annual reports from the chiefs of the varions rli visions comprising this office. I take occasion to ~iYe a brief summary of their contents, also a fe"· remarks in reference to the operations during the year. The general design of tho office organization being to take up the rernlts as sent in by the field parties, dig:e8t and compute them, afterwards delineate on paper, and then, "·ith all the de:-patch consiste11t "·ith accuTacy, pnhli,;h to the ·world, with snch diTections, dutn. and conclusions as will be of use-the work will be g1anred at in the order received, and presse·i through the various divisions. First in order the triangulation i8 receh-ed, the ::ingles and distances computed, the point,; then plotted, and returned to the field parties for minute topographical detail, then again plotted on separate sheets anrl sent for the hydrographic re~ults. The second return of work is received by the drawing di\·ision. diani:;ed in scale to suit the nature and extent of locality desired to be embraced in one map or chart. workc(I up hy the uraughtsman into the appearan('e designed for the public; thence it pas;;es to the engraver to be permanently fixed on copper 11late for re-production. The plate goes from the engraving to the electrotype room, ·where a mould or alto is taken, and from the alto a cast or basso produced, which is the duplicate of the engraved plate, and the one U:'<ed by the printer. The process by \Yhich Coast Survey ·work is embodied into form through the medium of the office is thus genera.Uy indicated, in order that the particular mention of the Jivisio11s which constitute it a unit may not seem disconnected and confused. It will be convenient to retain the general order already indicated, while giving the total of the office work, by presenting a brief summary of the operation" of carh of it;;; divisions, also to confine remark to the chiefs, referring you for more detailed information to the diYisions' reports themselves, herewith submitted. I beg leave to call attention at this point to the vast amount of work done in the office from year to year, not apparent in the published results of tho work, nor in the annual re!)Ort of its progress.

To illustrate : by law two scales are designated on which the charts of the coast shall be published, viz: Tuo'ooo"and 80 ~ 00 , or, which is the same thing, on a Reale of about six and onethird (G}) and one and one-fourth (l!) miles to the inch. Let us suppo!"c the entrance to Savaunah river surveyed to include the lower anchorage ; on either of the .two scales mentioned the survey, when plotted, would be too small and minute to afford that certnin guide as to position of lights, land marks, dangers, &c., neces:;;ary to enable the mnriner to enter with safety and come to a proper anchorage. Hence a chart on a scale differing from either of the two mentioned, and of a size suitable to delineate all that a vessel's safety requires shall he shown:, i~ drawn, engraved and published. The wants of commerce imperatiYely call f..Jr this. At fi~st thought it might be supposed that the office had done with thi:3 particular locality with the issue of th e c l1art ; tuJS L · · llJ no means the case; vessels must eome to and leave tlus · ''is anchorage, and it is quite as important to know how to get there from any given point, or how 24 ~

the po><ition of this anchorage rehitive to other points near must be shown, and con{reniently rn,

too, in 01·der that tbe e.n' may take thorn in. Thi8 nece;::;it~- calls for a smaller t:cale, in order that a greater extent of coat:t may be put within convenient limits, and the same ·work is reduced a second time, then re-drawn and re-engraved to suit tlin 1w'v caf'e. . Aµ:ai11: it i~ 11ecc.s:-ar:- to sho'Y the po;;;ition of the anchorage with reference to points much mon· remotC', ill order that the ves:>el, "-hile distant nrnny hours, may know lww to head so as to take tlw shortl'i't pot<;:ible dir0ction. This calls for a scale still more minute, and the office r0-produce::; the entire work again. Thi.· occlir8 even a fourth time : and when it is stated that the charts on these small scaleR, on which tlie labor of years is expended, (for the smaller the scale tlrn more nice and delicnte becomes the 1York on it,) do not appear among tlie charts, &c., accompanying the annual report, it i;; readily perceived, as ::;tatcd, that a large proportion of the labor of the office is not apparent to the c-asual reader, nor can well be described so aR to become so. Again: take tlie case of the computing division. Suppose a system of triangulation runningalong an exteut of 4-00 miles of coast before it becomes practicable to measure a verification base. to fix ah,,olntely the azimuth and the position of the terminating point astronomicall:-. and tlrnt Hwse resnltf'. then disagree with the results of the triangulation, as in all human prohabilih· the:· will ; now, it is comparatiYoly ea8y to compute distances between point&. to n'rluce baPc moaRuremonts and to compute the obt<orvations ; but '\'ho besides the compntc;r himself can estimate the weary paim:-taking labor required to go back over hundreds of milef' of 1rianµ:ulr1tion, re-c0mputc, re-examine cvcr~·thing again, wcig·h all the elements and c1wnces of error, compare. aclju:-:t, and re·acljui'<t, so that error ma:'· disappear and re;;;ults agrPe. The same remark ffill a],.:o apply to tbe designing- the form, limits and scale of maps, (termed project,.:,) requiTing in tlw cat4e of every chart or sketch issued a careful stud;-.-, so that the~· may. as far m: po><siJ.le, fulfil every condition of uscfulncs!' that can be looked for in them. The above is not to be understood as admitting or eYen intimating that in amount of work stated thi::: report will not compare favorably with what has been done during any former year. but to dra"- attention to the fact that, notwithstanding the details given, many resultE< are ohtairwd nncl much labor expernled that cannot be adYerted to. The general adjustment of force between the different divisions is very satisfactory ; no 01w is too much in advance of tlio others in its labors ; all aro moving steadily forward in the track of the field '\vork, and ae nearly abreast as the nature of the work and the division of duJio." will admit of. In point of progress the computing and drawing must lead off, the engraving and puhlit'11iug cJose up. A.s to the state of adYaucement of the oflice relative to the field work, it is impossible to specify the number of weeks or months that separate the two; but it may in general be stated that the 111ffice is from one to three years behind. I am not positive but what this state of things is not only necessary but desirable ; opportunity for re-sun·eys and corrections of mistakes, supplying omissions, &c., is thus afforded. without the office itself being stopped in its progress or losing time in correcting erroneon:i information. Computing Dir1'.8ion.-The field covered by the labors of this division is necessarily extcrrnive, inasmuch as the primary, secondary, and tertiary triangulation, all astronomical, chronometric,

W'ith the exeeption of furnishing to this ofl:ic:e the tidal data for chart>', the labor,; of the division arc directly controlled by the supcrinteudent, to whom the chief as,;istant, L. F.

A general statemeui will l·e found an· nexed to my report. · Drawing Divisio11.-All the topographical and hydrographic 1;-ork executed by the variom: Coai'.t Survey parties dotted along the seaboard of the United States is reecivcd into this division, reduced in scale, joined together, discrepancies reconciled ..and then 'IYorkcd up intu the appearance designed for publication. In addition, much labor is consumed in preparing for the field pa1·ties the sheets used, and projecting upon them the astronomical and trigouometrical puiuts previously determined. Considerable infor!natiou also i» given forth clirectly from this division every year, in cases where it is too important to be delayed for engraving hy tracings from original clrawings. The division consists of fifteen per;;ons, subject to the immediate direction of Lieutenant J. C. Tidball, U. S. A., and i:,; kept nuder a rather constant pressure by the wants of field parties calling for information, of the engraving division for work, and l>y the litl10graphers in Balti· more, Philadelphia, and New York, by whom a portion of the charts and sketches for the annual report are executed. Still, although the demand upon it is constant, all calls for information and work have been promptly met, and the amount of work reported show:o< a steady increase upon that of previous years ; also a gradual gain upon the field work. It is a fact well known and established, that more time is commrned by au isolated party, in working up the results of its own survey, plotting and making the drawings, than is required to make the survey itself and obtain all desired data. If the Coast Survey, in this respect, shows more rapid progress in the office, it may be regarded as due, solely, to the system established, that the field parties shall be kept in the field, having little or no office duty proper to perform, and that the offiee party shall be charg:er1 with no field duty, but kept steadily employed with its o\vn peculiar dutie8 ; thus enaliliug the experience and skill gained from day to day to be advantageously applied ou each succee<liug

one. Some few changes in the individual draughtsmen have occurred, but no difficult): was ( experienced in maintaiuing the standard of skill, intelligence, and industry. The working force has not. materially varied. Four of the draughtsmen have been constantly kept on the 80 ~- 0 -0 finished charts ; eight others partly on tlte finished charts and partly on others of a larger Renie; the remainder on maps le8s highly finished, and on the ordinary drawings and tracings of the office. I subjoin, with the report of Lieutenant Tidball, a list of maps. charts, and sketche~, completed and in progress, as comprising the operations of the division during the past year. Engran:11g Divisimi.-It is a matter of necessity that muchinterest should centre around the labors of this division. As the work of the survey has progressed from one step to another, been digested, reduced into form, revised an<l modified, it finally comes to that point when it is to he given to the public, in a form not only accurate in detail, but practically useful and pleasing to the eye. The best engravers have conscqucntl,\· been sought, to properly express the valuable labors previously expended on the work, and upon their success must depend, to a very considerable degree, the general success of the work in the estimation of the country. It is believed tlrnt thus far no camrn for disappointment exists, and that, both as specimeus of art and as faithful representations of the portion of country intended to be delineated, and as giving reliable information to the navigator how to enter the different harbors, and the dept!i of water he can rely upon as being· able to carry in, they are unsurpassed. The engraver" themselveR certainly stand high in their art. It has chanced that, since my <:mrneclion with the office, specimens of work have been submit~d h;· various persons in Europe, with a Yiew to their getting employment here. The inference has naturally been that tbe applicants were among the most skillful of their class, and certainly no specimen received has been of an order such that, in my opinion, it could not to-day be excelled in this office. The charge of this divi;;ion has been under the control of Lieutenant Rufus Saxton, U. S. A., whose management has proved judicious and effective. The yearly project of work for 1857 proposed the following to be accomplished in engraving, to -wit : Plymouth harbor, ::M:uskeget channel, }fonomoy shoals, .Albemarle Sound, Beaufort harbor, and San Francisco entrance, together with the list of preliminary charts, &c., published in report of 1856. All the work contemplated has been doue, with the two exceptions of Albemarle Sound, No. 2, and Muskeget channel; the former has been delayed in consequence of a i<mall amount of work required to complete it not being in the office ; the latter is still in hand, and reported as requiring at least one year's steady work of an engraver to complete, affording an instance where, "'vith all the experience of the office, it has be~m found impossible to make an approximate estimate of the time required. Still the division has not fallen behind even in the number of plates, as the two important charts of Eastern and :Middle sheets of south side of Long Island, Boston and Charleston harbors (all of which the yearly prospect of work did not contemplate) have been finished, and contain the changes ;;lwwn by the most recent surveys. In addition to the first class cliarts completed, considerable work has been done upon ten others, which it is not possible to show in a report. It can only be apparent to those in the office. The total number of engravers is twenty-one, most of whoru have attended to the work entrusted to them with a commendable spirit of industry and professional ambition. The exceptions to this have not been of such a character as to call for more than a passing notice, and are corrected by the mere knowledge of them.

The various calls made upon the division have been promptly met, and thus far no test of its taste and Rkill in execution has been too great. The ;.;:y;.;tcm of apprenticeship established ma~- be regarded as working well ; the office gets a certain class of work done more cheaply than h.v other means, and the young men, by learning the art of engraving through the instrumentality of the office, are given the means of earning a future livelihood. During the coming year it is proposed to complete the following plates, to wit : The finished first class charts of EaBtern series No. 2, Muskeget channel, A.nnis Squam and Ipswich harliors, Patapsco river, Albemarle Sound, Kos .. 1 and 2. Beaufort harbor, (re-survey and new edition,) Mis,;issippi Sound, No. 1, San Pranciscu bay, San Diego bay. together with seventy-three preliminary maps, charts, sketches, and diagrams. The following extract from Lieut. Saxton's report contains a ,;ummary of the work done in the engraving divi10ion during the past year. "In the engraving division, seven first dass maps have been completed during the year. and seventeen have been in progress. Of these last, ten were commenced in former years, and seven in the prcl:'cnt :-car. Twenty second class maps or charts and s'Kekhcs have been completed during the year, of which sixteen were begun in the present year. and nine of the same claRR, commenced 1vit.hin the year, are in progress. Thirteen diagrams ha-ve been completed. This gives a total of forty plateR completed, and of twenty-nine in progres8. or of sixt:·ninc engraved or engraving withi11 the year ending November 1, 185i. The additions ~md corrections have l1een so numerous to six of those previously published that they haTe been re-issued as new editions, and two of those formerly issued in a preliminar~- form have lwen completed. The chart of Boston harbor is included in this year's :finished list, owing to the various corrections and additions which have been made upon it. In addition to tho;;:e engraved upon copper, thirteen charts and sketchm; have been engraved upon stone. The complete list giving the titles of the maps and charts will be found appended to this report. The list of maps, charts, and sketches, up to the present date, which also accompanies the report, includes two hundred and eight titli:s. .Of these, fifty-two are :first class or finished maps. Twenty progress sketches, in addition, have been engraved.'' mectrotype Division.-From rather an experimental beginning, this division has grown to he one of the most important auxiliaries in getting before the public the results of the surve;· ; it is to the engraving division what the die is to the seal; let a plate on which there is engraving but pass into it and that engraving is pcrpetu11ted ; deface or destroy the original, it can be re-produced ''ad infinitum'' in the utmost perfection. Never has the process been carried on with more certainty than during the past year, and the number of plates capable of being produced Ly the process is only limited by the means placed at the disposal of the electrotypist ; a few years ago it was thought an achievement to produce six perfect plates in a year, now one is produced on an average of every two and a half working days.

In the report of the Superintendent for 1855 a brief description is given of the facilitv with which work on different copper plates is joined together, by using thin electrotypes of. them, which ca.n be readily cut with the scissors, thus fitting the work together, and afterward,; producing a new plate by the sall'le process.
It is now practically ascertained that thin electrotypes are all that is necessary; the 'stiffness ll&q\l!iJite- lo print i?.otn ·~ing ghren by ~t~ ~m. ~ ·'BWel ~}14Q·cw1r -hli7~ing a·:snrooth

surface, and cut to the proper size. As one steel plate, termed a stretch plate, will answer for 1 all electrotypes of the same size, it is readily perceived that a great saving of both time and expense will hereafter follow in this division. The use of thin electrotypes in combination with steel or any substance that will give it the necessary support has led Mr. M<1.tl1iot, who is in charge of the division, and to whose experiments mid researches it is conceived the Coast Survey owes much, to propose its application to all kinds of printing done from eng-raved surfaces, other than warped surfaces. The Superintendent's attention is invited to tliis as a matter of record. To illustrate by a sing·lc example : ·.Calico pi:inting is now done from a steel or copper cyl· inder on wl1ich the desired figure,<: or deAigns are engraved and stamped at a heavy expense : when thi8 cylinder is too much worn for use there is no method of producing more of the same prints except by engraving a new cylinder at the same expense as the first. By the use of the thin electrotype plate, which is almost as flexible as paper, the above expense is almost entirely done away with. Instead of engraving on a cylinder, which in the first place is difficult, let the design for the prints be engraved on an ordinary copper plate.; from this plate obtain the thin electrotype, which wrap around a smooth prepared cylinder and secure ; the engraved steel cylinder, or it8 equivalent, is now ready ; when worn the electrotype wrapping can be replaced any number of times and at the most trifling expense. If the expectations above alluded to prove well founded, it is readily perceived that a complete revolution may be produced in the pref'ent limited uses to which printing from copper is put. The following on this subject is an extract from :Mr. Mathiot' s report: ''The working of the thin electrotypes has suggested to me the idea of U8ing these plates on a circular bed or roller, and gaining thereby the great advantages of cylinder printing for flat plates. This has often been sought before, but the impossibility of getting a rigid plate to conform accurately to a cylindrical figure has hitherto defeated it. As the thin electrotypes are easily strained over a covered surface, the great desideratum is now attainable. l am about having this matter put to a practical test, and h<tve every hope that the copper-plate printing can thus be executed by steam machinery, and with almost tl.}e rapidity of letter-press work." Printing.-Lieutenant ,L P. Hill, U. S . .A.., in addition to his duties as general assistant in this office, has given more particular supervision to this branch of the work, and reports that both presses were discontinued for a brief space in order to repair the boiler ; the small press in addition was not in use for a time, Mr. J. Rutherdale having been taken from it and placed at the large one, in place of Mr. O'Brien, on tho 1st of July. A printer for the small press has now been employed and both are in active use. In consequence of the necessary changes stated above, the number of impressions struck off from the various platei;; ·was dimini8hed. Somo improvement has been made in the preparation of the ink used, by which it dries harder and-is more adhesive ; the lines also ('Orne out more clearly defined . .A. subjoined list will show the number of impressions taken from the different plates since November 1, lll\56. The distribution of maps and Coal'Jt Survey Reports has been attended to by Mr. V. E. King, who, when not so occupied, has performed clerical duties in the office. I would refer to his report, hereto annexed, for a statement, in the usual form, of the number of impressions sent

away, and to the continued demand of the office as well as from field parties for information. the keeping of the archives and scientific library attached becomes rather important to the proper working of the Coast Survey. 'l'he system and attention of Mr. 0. B. Snow, who is in ch:nge, have afforded every desired facility, and his services have g-iven satisfaction. He reports ·as follows: ''During the past year there has been no change in tho arrangement of the archives ; the records are in as good order as the limited spaco will allow, but, in cOflsequence of the increasing number of volumes and the smallness of the room, great inconvenience ·will be felt if a larger space is not shortl.'prnvided.'' ''To the lilirary tliere have been added durin~ the year, between Januar.Y. 1856, and January, 1857, three hundred and eighty-nine volumeo:, of which one hundred and sixty-one wen·. presented by foreign governments and different scientific societies." Instrument Shop.-The statement furnished by Mr. J. Vierbuchen, master instrument maker, shows that the following irn;truments have been made during the year, viz : three plane tables, two compasses for plane tables, the motion work for a plane table, fourteen Rpring clamps for plane tables, fifteen metre chains, and as many pairs of shoes for chain metre poles, two theodolites, six theodolite stands, four riding levels, four deep-sea thermometers, two eye pieces for theodolites, four beam compasses, four lanterns for transits, two 3-armed protractors, two stands for leveling instruments, a reversing apparatus for transit, a pyrometer for base apparatm<, two current metres, two rulers for tide gr:rnge divisions, four tide- gauges,· three sextant:;;, tweh-e st<in(J;, for base apparatus, a set of base rods with sectorn, and nume1·ous smaller instruments for use in the field and in the office.

In addition to the above, repairs were made on twenty-three theodolites, twenty-two plane tables, twenty-five sextants, seven surveying and four prismatic compasses, four telegraph registers, two dip circles, seven theodolite stands, fourteen metre chains, six sounding apparatus, (altered for deep-sea indications,) eleven deep-sea thermometers, three levelling instruments, ten beam compasses, and a number of other field and office instruments. The labors of this branch of the office have been in every way satisfactory. The demand for the deep-sea thermometers hal' been supplied. A great variety of work has been done on the base apparatus. All the paper used on the self-registering tide gauges has been cut and rolled. The drawing in:,;truments have been kept in order, and a large amount of miscellaneous work executed during the year. The force employed consists of l:1ix mc<'fuanics, a blacksmith, and an apprentice. Carpentry.-I subjoin a statement of the most important work done in the carpenter's shop, under the direction of Mr. A.. Yeatman, master carpenter, whose services are very 8ati.sfactory : "There have been made eleven theodolites and plane-table stands ; twelve plane-table boards; ten cases with pigeon holes for office records ; two large cases; with slides, for copper plates in archive" ; one large case, with drawers fur filing proofs, in engraving division ; seven fine cases for theodolites and plane tables; wood work for four new tide gauges ; twelve boxes, with inside work, for packing same ; two complete sets ~f stands and boxes for subsidiary base apparatus ; one case for dividing engine; painting and numbering upwards of 120 tin cases for original sheets; four covered writing tables for office ; one engraver's table ; 350 feet of fencing, eight feet high; putting up house for preservation of boxes; seven large drawing boards; one large vat for electrotyping ; about 25 boxes for packing valuable instruments, such as transits, heliotropes, plane tables, &c. 1 &c. ; one carpenter's bench for shop; one covered d~sk and table for office;

In closing this report, I take· occasion to re.mark upon the great advantage resulting to the office in having a general assistant, to take the place of tho assistant in charge of the office in case of sickness or absence ,: also to attend to t1-ose special cases re<]uiring more time and' attention from the assistant in charge than is consistent with due attention to the general duties of thi;; office. Lieutenant A. P. Hill, U. S.

I take pleasure, also, in calling attention to the admirab_le manner in which the clerical duties of the office are performed by Mr. A. 1.V. ltussell. Much of the success met with in any bmiiness is due to the proper keeping of books and papers, and the remark is peculiarly applicable to this office, where the duties are various, and papers and accounts numerous and complicated.

Co.AST SURVEY OFFICE, October 1, 1857. In compliance with the office regulations, the usual annual report on tho condition of the computations and the occupation of the computers during the year past is herewith respectfully

submitted. During my temporary absence from the office, from the middle of March to the end of May, while engaged on field duty, the division was attended to by Assistant J. E. Hilgard. On the laRt of July Mr .·T. E. Blankenship resigned, and the vacancy theEeby occasioned has not lieen filled at the date of this report. Since no important alterations were made in the general organization of the division, the same being perfectly efficient, it needs no other reference than that to the character and amount of work done by the several computers, of which a detailed statement follows. As far as the nature of the field work rec@iv-ed and the requirements of the office permitted, the general plans and estimates for the year have been adhered to. Particular attention wa 5 paid t-0 the revision of the astronomical azimuth and latitude computations i the adjustment of the triangulations is ~so c~ia'ling wore time, in prop~rtion to the increaae of the number of connected astronomieal positions and tQ.e junctions of the separate parts of triangulations. The reduction of the magnetic observatiom~ and discussions have been fully kept up to da:eThe general condition of the astronomical and geodetic reductions is in due conformity with the state of the field w~rk, ~ the pr~t force of co,mpu~~mi. is. jue.t suffi.pient to ~eep. it thus

balanced. The increase in the field-work occasions no further preo;snre, as the same is met by the corresponding advantage of the accumulated experience of the computers. On the lGih of 1\Ia,rch the Superjntendent assigned me to dut.r in his party, for the determination of tlte longitude of Fernandina, Fla. ; a detailed f'tatcment of which will be found elsewhexe. On :May 29 I again took <'ltarg·e of the divi,.,ion, completed the reduction of tho longitude of Fernandina from chronometer tnm:<portations, and reduced the magnetic ob:-ervations at Savannah and Fernandina, 1857. Prior to thi;.; field dut:v l reducml the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity of seventeen 1'tations 1n Sectlon III, 1857. In December last I was eugaged for one week at the A" tor Library, Ne\\- York, in complding the Coast Survey bibliographical index. Beside,., a number of report,.; \H~re su1nnitted to tho a!:',;istant in charge, amongst them the following : On the ,iunetion of the geodetic operationR of SC;ctio11s III and IV and of Section IV with Cape Fear riYer ; on tho connection of the Cedar Keyt> and \VacrasaR;;;a Bay triangulation ; on t.he latitude and longitude of astronomical f'tation Flt the mouth of the Rio Gn:milt>. I made alRo a f<ketd1 of a hypsnmetrical equatorial section of the earth's 1<1irface, and reduced the Key Bil'.'c:iyne lrn;;e. All current work for the oflfre and calfa from the field parties hnve been prompt}_;· attern1ed to. The geogTaphical positions published in thiB volume will be found noticed at the end of thi;; report. As8istant Theoclurn TF. fVcrner completed the trnntiit and latitude reduction of H nmholdt Ba~' station, Section X, reduced the triangulation of l\Iatagorda Bay of 1856, and Sapelo Sound of 1856, for which latter locality rectangular co-ordinates were computed. Ile calculated the geographical po1<ition of about forty stations near New York, of Assistant Blunt' s triangulation. Mr. Werner also reduced the primary and secouclary measurements of Assistant Boutelle' s triangulation, from Edisto Island to Long Island, S. C., S:octiou Y, between 1849 and l85G ; 0 work of considerable labor, including the positions of over two lrnndrerl trigonometrical i;,\,ations. He also completed the reduction of Assi;;tant Davicfaon' s triaugulation of .A.dmiralty Inlet, and computed the latitude, longitude, and azimuth of the '"hole of that triangulation. JJ:fr. Eugene ]).Tulty made the reduction of the follo\Ying astronomical azimuth": Of Hurricane Island, Section VII ; of Mount Desert, Section I ; of Point Hudson, Section XI ; of Cat faland, Section VIII; of Yard, Section II, and of I~oint Pinos, Section X. :Mr. Nulty also reduced the latitude of stations Fort 8t. l\fark' sand St. Mark' i:; T,ig ht, Se di on VII ; of Deer IF.land, Section VIII; of Hurricane faland, Section VII ; of }fouul Desert, Sect.Lon I; of ~fol~ih,, Section VIII.

Extracts from tlte report qf First Ldeutenant Ilufu.Y Saxton, 4th regiment cf artillery, United, States army, assistant, in charge qf the engraving department.
COAST SURVEY OFFICE,

Wa,sltington, November 1, 1857. The charge of this division has remained with me since the date of my last annual report, November 1, 1856. J have been assisted by l\Ir. Edward Wharton, and it gives me much pleasure to testify to the ability with which he hl\s discharged his duties. The engraving force now present consists of one chief engraver, Mr. Geo. McCoy, seventeen engravers, and three apprentices. Mr. S. W. Bradley, a young man of fine promise, has died. He served hi.i apprenticeship in this office, and bid fair to have become one of our beBt engravers. Mr. J. J. J!night, a young man who acqui~ed a knowledge of his art here, has dissolved his connection with the office. As a general rule, the engravers have evinced commendable zeal in the discharge of their duties, and the quantity and quality of their work will, I think, compare very favorably with that of any previous year. Some of the toPography and lett,eriug is highly creditable to those who engraved it, and, compared wit!i specimens of work from si~ilar offices abroad, shows that the standttrd of the art in ours is inferior to none. 'l'he charts of the Coast Survey are in great demand, and the extensive use whfoh is made of

THE UNITED ST.A.TES COAST SURVEY.

the information which they contain by those who are in any way connected with the navigation and commercial interest of our country, involves the necessity of extreme accuracy in details. As errors might endanger both life and property, no time or pains is spared to make them as accurate as possible. Charts which were reported as complete in my last annual report may be again reported, in some instances, as finished this year. This is due for the most part to important changes which have taken place upon the coast, requiring the insertion of subsequent data which could not be estimated for. The above fact will Le sufficient to explain any apparent discrepancy between the reports of this and the last year. The engraving of several important first class finished charts has been completed during the year, viz: Plymouth harbor, Boston harbor, Monomoy shoals, south side Long Island, (east,) south side Long Island, (middle,) and Charleston harbor. In addition to the important work which has been done upon the above named ma11s, the fine first class charts of Patapsco river, Chesapeake hay, No. 1, Chesapeake bay, No. 2, Chesapeake bay, No. 3; Eastern series, No. 1, Eastern series, No. 2 ; Beaufort harbor, AJbemarle sound, No. 1, Albemarle sound, No. 2, and San Francisco bay, have been kept constantly in hand by our first class engravers, and well advanced towards completion. Since the date of my last report, lJ.Ir. George McCoy, the chief engraver, has re-engraved some fine view·s upon the chart;; of Boston harbor and south side of Long Island, and some excellent topography upon the map of Eastern series, No. 2, and south side of Long Island. Mr. John ]{night has been kept constantly employed engraving the titles, notes, general lettering, and ,,;oundings on the finit class maps of Bmiton harbor, south side Long Island, Nos. 2 and 3; Chesapeake bay, Nos. 2 and 3 ; San Francisco bay and harbor, and other miscellaneous work upon first class maps and· charts. For beauty and style of finish. his work is unsurpassed . .lJfr. Dankworth has been continued at the engraving of the outlines and topography on the maps of Chesapeake bay. The quality of his work is not excelled in the office. Mr. Rolle has completed the topography on the map of Boston harbor, and continued the engraving of topography upon the map of Patapsco river, besides miscellaneous work. The beautiful map of Boston harbor, the topography of which was engraved by him, gives the best evidence of his skill. JJ1r. Enihojfer has been employed, since he joined the office, engraving the topography upon the maps of Eastern series, No. 2, and south side Long Island, No. 3. Mr. Blondeau has been employed nearly the entire year in etching the topography of San Francisco bay and harbor. Mr. SengteUer has engraved the topography on the map of Plymouth harbor, a portion of that of Albemarle sound, No. 1, and the sanding of Rappahannock river. Mr. JJfetzeroth has finished the etching of topography on the steel plate of Beaufort harbor and views of Anacapa island. He also engraved the topography on the plate of the Rappahannock river, No. 2, a portion of that of Albemarle son ml, No. 2, and has executed miscellaneous work. Jfr. Phi1Up8 joined the office June 8, 1857. He has completed the topography on the plate of Charleston harbor, and engraved a portion of that of Mississippi sound, No. 1. Mr. Throop has engraved soundings, titles, notes, and general lettering on the following plates, viz: Beaufort harbor, Cape Fear river, (upper,) Tidal Curves Gulf of Mexico, Monomoy shoals, New York bay and harbor, Elec. 7, Rappahannock river, Albemarle sound, No. I, Maffitt' s channel, St. Mary's bar and Fernandina harbor seacoast of Texas, and miscellaneous 1 , ettermg. Mr . .A. Maedd has engraved topography and genei:a1 lettering upon Cape Fear 26 EB

river (upper and lower,) and Albemarle sound, No. 2. Mr. KondruP_ has engraved a pprtion of the outlines of Chesapeake bay, Nos. 1 and 2, and the topography, title, notes, and general lettering of Rappahannock river, No. 1. Mr. Barnard has engraved a portion of the sanding on the plates of Albemarle sound No. 1, Monomoy shoals, St. John's river, (lower sheet,) and Charleston harbor, and done some miscellaneous work. Jt[r. E. A. Maed~l joined the office on the 1st of April, 18.57. He has been principally employed since that time as a letter engraver, and has engraved the title, notes, and general lettering upon the following plates, viz: Rappahannock river, Nos. 2, 3, and 4 ; lines of deep-sea soundings in the Gulf of Mexico, and telegraphic diagram plate. Mr. Langran has engraved the titles, notes, soundings, and general lettering of the chart of seacoast of Alabama and Mississippi ; title and notes of Steilacoom harbor ; notes on Galveston entrance, and done miscellaneous work upon charts and sketches. Mr. Ogilvie has engraved the outlines, title, notes, soundings, and general lettering upon seacoast of Massachusetts, and miscellaneous work upon charts and sketches. M1·. Peterson has engraved the title, notes, outlines, topography, soundings, and general lettering upon the two maps of St. John's river, (upper and lower,) besides lettering upon the progress sketches. Mr. J. J. Km:tJht left this office on the 1st day of August. Up to that date he was employed upon the following plates, viz: Blakely harbor, Bellingham bay, Florida reefs, Shoalwater bay, San Antonio creek, and progress sketches. Mr. S. W. Bradley engraved the title, notes, and general lettering on the plate of .A.nacapa island, besides miscellaneous work upon other charts and progress sketches. His death occurred on the first day of July last. Mr. Bartk has been employed in miscellaneous work upon the report and progress sketches. Apprentices Benner, Thompson, and Sipe have been employed in the engraving of the pro· gress and other sketches, with such practice as was necessary to improve their knowledge of the art of engraving. It is to be regretted that the number of first class engravers is so small, as there is a much greater amount of important work to be done in this division than can be accomplished within a reasonable time, or as soon as it is desirable that it should be, by the present force employed. This deficiency of engravers has rendered it necessary to resort to lithographing, and in this most undesirable mode have some of the valuable sketches contained in the Superintendent's report been 'published. For a more detailed account of the work performed, I respectfully refer you to the accompanying list of maps, charts, preliminary charts, and sketches engraved or engraving during the year ending November 1, 1857, arranged in order of sections, and also to the complete list of Coast Survey maps, charts, preliminary charts and sketches engraved, geographically arranged.

I re~pectfuUy present the following report of the operations in this division since November

1, 1856.

THE UNITED STATES COAS1' SURVEY.

211

By the electrotype process we have made eighty-four plates. Of this number forty-six were in alto, and thirty-three in basso, from the charts of the survey ; five were for other departments of the government. I append tables of the plates from the Coast Survey charts. The work of combining, extending, and altering the charts by the electrotype process has 1ncreased on former years. It now occupies a considerable part of the time ; is performed with certainty, and gives full satisfaction. The usual assistance to the party for taking longitudes by the electro-telegraph has been rendered. The work of electro-gilding the deep sea thermometers 1ias been executed as in former years. The work of furnishing thin electrotypes, for printing, 1ntf' dda)-ed during: the early part of the year by the want of suitable metallic beds for stretching the thin plate:<; lrnt a rnitable article has at length been found in the sheet steel used in the manufacture of large sa11·s, a11d the use of thin printing plates is now entirely satisfactory. '.I,'he working of the thin electrotn>es has suggested to me the idea of using these plates on a circular bed or roller, and gaining thereby tlrn great advanta.~ei' of cylinck·r printing for flat plates. This ·has often been soug-ht before, but the impo,.;;:;i\Jility of getting u rigid plate to conform accurately to a cylindrical figure ha.s hitherto defeated it. A~ the thiu electrotypes are easily strained over a curved surface, tlie great dc8i<lcrntum is now attn innl!lc. I am ubout having this matter put to a practical test, and have every hope that copper-plate printing can thm; he executed by steam machinery, with almost the rapidit:i- of letter-pTc;:s work. Duriug the year some very important ex11eriment,; h:.n-e been made on the aTt of photogntphy, with a view to its employment in the illustrations of the survey.

Lieutenant A. P. Hill, United States army, assistant-on the progres11 made in printing.
COAST SURVEY 0FF1CE,

Washington, D. 0., .November 1, 1857. I have tho honor to submit a report of the results accomplished in printing during the year ending October 31, 1857. The discontinuance of the small pres><, for fmme time, caused by the want of a printer, together with the loss of time to both presses, from repairs to the boiler, has necessarily diminished the number of impressions struck off. A. careful attention to the quality of the ink used, and the burning of the oil, has caused a decided improvement in the printing, both as to distinctness and adhesiveness, the ink now drying hard upon the paper, and the lines being clear and well defined. Since the 1st of July, the large press bas been in charge of Mr. John Rutberdale, who has also had the general oversight of the printing room, and I am gratified to hear wituess to hi;,; attention and industry. Since the 1st of Xovember, there have been printed from the following plates:

APPENDIX No. 25.
List of geograpf,ical positions determined by the United States Coast Survey, and continued jroni reports of 1851, 1853, and 1855.
The present list is a continuation of that p11blished in the annual reports for 1851, 18;)3, ancl 1Sl:i5, an<l contains the geograpltical positions of points determined astronomically and tri~o nometrically since the date of the former reports, with the repetition of some points previously published, for convenience of reforcucc. The following explanations 1vill give all the information required for the use of the tables. For the purpoo;es of the survc~·, the coast is divi(1cd into eleven sections, in all of which tho work i,; carried on simultaneously. The surVC}' being- in differc11t stages of progress ill the several ~ections, and new results bei11g added from year to year to those here given, the same divisiolls have been adopted in the publication. The several sections arc defined as follows : SECTION I. From Passamaquoddy bay to Point Judith. SECTION IL From Point Judith to Cape Henlopen. SECTION III. From Cape Henlopen to Cape Henry. SECTION IV. From Cape Henry to Cape Fear.· SEGTION V. From Capo Fear to St. Mary's river. SECTION ·vr. From St. Mary's river to St. Joseph's bay. SECTION VII. From St. Joseph's bay to Mobile bay. SECTION \THI. From Mobile bay to Vermilion bay. SECTION IX. From Vermilion hay to the Rio Grande. · SECTIOK X. Coast of California, San Diego bay, to 42d parallel. SECTlON Xl. Coast of Oregon and Washington Territories, 42d to 49th parallel. Tlie tables give the latitudes and longitudes of the trigonometrical points in each section, and their relative azimuths or bearings and distances. The manner in which these data have been obtained may be briefly explained here. In each section a base line of from five to ten miles is measured with all possible accuracy . .A. series of triangles, deriving the length of their sides from this base, is then established along the coast by the measurement of the angles between the intervisible stations. In this primary

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

265

series the triangles are made as large as the nature of the country will permit, because the liability to error increai:;es with the number of triangles. On the bases furnished by the s:ides of the primary triangles a secondary triangulation is next established, extending along the coast, and over the smaller bays and sounds, and determining a large number of points at distances a few miles apart. The distances between tho points thus determined, as given in the tables, are liable to an average error of about one foot in six miles, until a final adjustment between the base lines shall have been made. In some parts of the survey the base lines for the primary triangulations have not yet been measured, or the connexion bct1Yecn the secondary and primary triangulation has not yet been mi.lde, in which ca:"CR the distances depend on preliminary buse lines, measured with great care, and they are liable to an average error of one foot in three miles. This applieo; to the positions on Savannah river in Section V, to a part of those in Section vI, and to the positions in Sections VII, IX, X, and XL As on the completion of the primary triangulation in each section the several series form one connected chain, the different bases afford verifications of each other, and of the triangulation connecting them. The first four sections arc thus connected, the last section, however, only in a preliminary way. Observations for latitude and azimuth arc made at a number of stations of the primary triangulation in each section. The differences of latitude, longitude, and azimuth between these and other stations are then computed, under the supposition that the earth is a spheroid of revolution of t11e following dimensions, which are those determined by Bessel, from the reliable measurements made at the tim0, viz : Equatorial radius = 6377397. IU metres. Polar radius= 6356078.96 metres. Eccentricity = 0081G96. 83. It has been found that the differences of latitude and longitude, as computed in this manner from the distance and azimuth between two stations, and \Yhich arc called geodetic, differ from those obtained by astronomical observations at the several stations, by quantities which are greater than the errors of tl1e observations. Such disagreements are due to local irregularities in the :figure and density of the earth, and the error resulting from them in the determinations of latitude and of the meridian plane is designated as station error. It amounts, according to the results obtained at present, to between one and four seconds of arc in the eastern section of the survey, and to about one second and a half in the sections south of the Delaware. In order to eliminate the influence of st;ttion errors on the general result., observations are made at a number of stations ; the results are referred to a central station by means of the geodetic differences, and the mean of all is used for the computation of the positions given in the tables. The geographical pm;;itions mrn;t therefore be considered as lialJle to future changes from the accumulation of new observations, and from the final discusl-'ion of all the results obtained. The dijferences ef fongitu<le are obtained, as has been stated, by computation, from the dhtances, latitudes, and azimuths of the triangulation. In adding up the differences from station to station, an accumulation of the unavoidable errors is probable. They are checked, however, b,y- differences of longitude determined by means of the electro-magnetic telegraph in e v ' section where the introdudion of the latter makes it practicable. 34 EB

REPORT OF THE SL'PERINTENDENT OF

Seaton staNan, in W ashingtor1 city, has been selected as the centre for the tele~raphic differences of longitude. Tho sections at present connected by telegraph are Sections I, II, III, IV, Y, and YIII. Tho first three being also connected by primary triangulation, the check on the geodetic differences of longitude is here obtained and the agreement is very close. The longitudes from Grecmvich in the first five sections depend upon that of Cambridge observatory, as determined by chronometric differences between Liverpool and Cambridge, and by occultations, eclipses, and moon culminations, observed at various ob::;ervatories in the l:Tnited States, and referred to Cambridge by means of telegraphic differences. The following statement shows the result up to the present time.

They depend on moon culminations observed at San Diego, Point Conception, Point Pinos, Presidio, Telegraph Hill, Port Orford, Cape Disappointment and Cape Flattery, compared with corresponding observations at Greenwich and American observatories, and on chronometric differences between the same and other stations. The Section XI longitudes depend upon Lummi island. The longitude of the astronomical station has been found 122° 40' 36".9 W.
Explanat-ion o/ the talAes.
The first column on the left contains the name of the several stations or triangulation points. Their general locality is indicated by the heading at the top of the page, by means of which they may be readily found on the sketches accompanying the tables. Sub-headings in the first column indicate the locality more minutely where it is practicable. The stations are generally either prominent objects of permanence, such as spires, lighthouses, beacons, &c., or they arc the points on prominent hills, capes, and points of land, where signals have been erected for the purposes of the survey, and which are marked on the ground. In a small number of cases in the first three sections, but much more frequently in the southern sections, where settlements on the coast are sparse and few permanent objects are to be found, the stations have no other distinguishing mark than tho signal erected on the spot; and after its decay the mark left in the ground to designate the station point. The latt~r 18 generally consists of posts or stones set around the point, while the centre of the station

designated by an earthen cone or ghtsR bottle buried under the surface of the grnund, and marked on the top by a stone or post. Where the station is on a rock, a copper liolt, or a hole filled with lead or sulphur will be found to designate the exact spot. 'fhe sketches showing the configuration of the land, as well as the relatiYc positions of tlw stations, no groat difficulty will be experienced iu fimlillg the latter '\\·hen clcsirer1 for local surveys or reference. In any case whe1·e minute descriptions of particular i)oints arc required, they can be had by application addressed to the Coast Survey Office. The second and third columns contain the latitude,; an<l long;itudes of tho stations named. The fourth column contains the azimuth of the line joinin:; the station named in the :first columii with that named in the fifth; that is to my, the angle; ·whir:h that line make" with tho meridian of the former station, rockouecl from soulh arounu by we~t through tho \Yl1ule cirde ; tho sixth column gives the back azimuth of the Rame line, or the nngle which it make" \\'ith the meridian of the latter station, reckoned as hefore ; the difference between the azimuths in the fourth and those in the sixth columns being 180° le8s the inclination of the meridians at the two stations. The seventh, eightli, and ninth column8 µ:ivc the distances, in metres, yardf', and milei<, between the stationl3 named in the first and fifth columns. The relation of the metre to the yard U8ed in obtaining these results is: 1 metre 1.0935696 yard, or 3!).368505 United States standard inches. For each station tho azimuths and diRtances to two other stations are given. In every case the lines so given have actually been observed. In each section the stations of the primary triangulation are <listi11guished by being printed in small capitals. In Section IV some points previously published are repeated, with slight changes in their positions, arising from an adjustment of the triangulation between the Bodies Island base and the Kent Is1and base, and tho carrying of the Section III latitudes and longitudes into Section IV. Corresponding changes should Le made in the positions of the 1851, 1853, and that part of 1855 report depending on the former. In Section YIII a number of points alreacly published in the report for 1851 have been repeated on account of a slight change in tho base. In Section IX the longitudes given in the reports of 1851 and 1853 :ohould be increased by 20" to conform to the latest determination.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 26.
J:t.Totes on the measurement ef a base for the primary triangulrdion c:f the eastern .~Peh:on qf thr cnast of the United States, on Epping Plains, JJiaine, by A. D. Baclte, Superintendent United Stales

Coast Survey.
[Communicated by authol'ity of the Treasury Department to the American Association for the Advancement of'Scionce.J

The reconnaissance for a base of verification at the eastern extremity of the primary triangulation in Section I of the coast was commenced by Charles 0. Boutelle, esq., and Major Henry Prince, U. R. A., Assistants in the Coast Survey, in 1853, and continued through 1854 and 1855. The absence of long and straight sea beaches on this coast rendered it absolutely necessary to look for an interior site. The reconnais,;ance resulted in the selection of Epping Plain>:, Washington county, Maine, as the most suitable site for the purpose, considering the character of the ground itself and the facility of connecting the ends of tho base with the primar:Y triangulation. In this selection and the examination of the plains these officers were much assisted by the local knO\dedge and the kind offices of .T. A. Milliken, esq., now of Cherryfield, to whom I beg leave 1ere to return the thanks of the Coaf't Survey. 1\fajor Priuce beiug relieved from the survey, the final minute examination of the site and the determination of the best line which could be obtained Oll the plain devolved upon Assistant Boutelle, who ''>as assisted at different times by Sub-Assistant J. A.. Sullivan, Lieut. J. C. Cbrk, U.S. A., and l\ir. F. P. Webber. Epping Plains, or "Barrens," as tliey arc called, lie between the Narraguagus aud Pleasant rivers. They present a moderately rolling surface of ~mnd, generally destitute of trees, except in the lower and swampy parts, and are traversed by sand ridges of different elevations, resembling very much the surface which the sounding line develops 111 such regions as the Nantucket shoals, at pre;;ent below the surface of the water. The plain is quite elevated, and falls suddenly from an irregularly curved margin, by a steep H1ope, to a lrnver plain or a wide valley. Portions of the plain are strewed with boulders of various sizes, some of them containing not less than 4, 000 cubic feet, and of various granitic materials. Schoodiac Hill was found to limit the position of the base, so that the problem became to draw tho longest line through a point at the base of that hill, the ends of which would be easily visible from the secondary and primary stations. BefOJ"e the final selection of the line a topographical survey was made, under the direction of' AsRistant C. 0. Boutelle, by Sub-Assistant J. A. Sullivan and Mr. Webber, and the profile was studied upon a sketch of the plain made by Lieut. Clark. In 1856 I examined the site and took steps to obtain the necessary estimates of the cost vf preparing it for measurement. The profile of the line as graded gives a good general idea of the ground, as it varied but little from the natural profile, (Sketch No. 3.) The whole length of the line is about 8, 716 metres, or 5.4 miles. Its general direction is E. 16° S., (true bearing.) From the eastern end, for about four miles, the plafo is quite level, rising in the first mile pretty regularly about :fifteen feet, descending nearly as much in the next, to rise by the same quantity in the third mile. It then runs along an elevated level for

a fourth of a mile, and descends gradually to the rougher part of the base, which is included between the 3!j- the miles from the eaRt end and the western end of tho Lase. This line was skilfully grnded h)· M:r. Iloute1le, so as to follo11· i.110 natural f<urfacc wL.011 the grade did not ruu above three degrees, and to gi.n! a;,; lou.; slopes m; pos,;iule of the same grade, for the convenience of measuring, (Sketch No. 3.) As it was found more economical to make the temporary ernbankmen:.s than to excavate, a profile giving a considerable excess of emuankment was selected. This was executed in the cheapest way wl~ich would give stability for the time during which it was required to stand. The Jee s~ ·width was twelve foet., of ·which nine feet was on the south, and three feet on the north Rirle of the line to be measured. Tl1e base was very carefully alig1ied. High signal11 we:re placed over tlte termini which are intervisible. On the Schoodiac a ::-;ignal of moderate elevation is vis:b]e from both, and the distances between this point and the termini. were gradually sulJdivided until the smallest limit, the distance easily reached lJy a smaJl transit, was obtained. The verification of the al~gment at different points of the me.i.surerne11t, when the seeing was geod, wa:i complete. In all these preliminary operations :Mr. Boutelle was assisted by Sub-Assistant J . .A. Sullivan and Mr. "\Vebber. His gradi.ug pa1"ty consisted of the farmers and lumbermen of the district, vd10 served with great cheerfulnces and skill in the use of the heavy implements for rough grading. One of the greatest difficulties was the removal nf Ruch boulders as were in the line, many of them being of such size as to require blasting to break them up, aucl 80!lle being actually removed to the required distance'from the line by heavy blasts. The signals erected at the two ends are very suustantiaL each forty-three foet in height to the top of tho tripod, and fifty-three to the cone which surmounts them. The base apparatus already described before the association, and described and figured rn my report for 1854, by Lieut. E. B. Hunt of the Corps of Engineers, was used in this measurement, p1·eliminary trials being !llade in the office to test its steadiness under the greatest inclinations to which it would be subjected, a11d the accuracy of the surface upon wliich tlie measuring stem traverses, and which determines the length of the apparatus. I was assisted in the measurements by Ass'stm1t G. \V. Denn, Prof. Fairman R::igers, who volunteered for the purpose, Sub-Assistants Goodfellow, Stephen Harris, and Sullivan, and M.r. Tho.nas McDouuell, among whom the different operations were divided. The.usual comparisons of the apparntm; with the standard six metre bar were made beforo and after the meas.uement, to ascertain that no change had taken place in the length from damage transportation, and to add to the rc:mlts of former compari::wns. The measurement was begun at the west end of the line on Saturday, the 18th of July, hut the next week proved so rainy that it was only resumed in earnest on Monday, the 27th. 'l'he work of the finit Saturday, (24 tubes,) was remeasured on the following Monday, ·with precisely the same result as to length, tho end of the second measurement faJling exactly on the marks which had been placed as terminating the first, and which were fine dots upon the head of a copper nail placed in a stake, some eighteen inches in length, driven into the ground until its head just projected above the surface. The position of the mark was determined and verified, as all others of the sort in our measurements, by using a transit placed at right angles to the line a.nd at a moderate distance from it.

This was on a descending slope of the strongest grade adopted, and there was a difference r of temperature of some five degrees in the two measurements. On Tuesday a length of 18 tubes which lmd been measured on Monday "~as remeasured "\Yith an identical result. This was on ascending slope. On Monday the work was, in part, interrupted by the arrangemente for photographing tho apparatus, on Tuesday by a fog, and on Wednesday by showers in tho beginning of the day i we mrido, however, half a mile on both dayi=:;. On W edncsday began a series of four un)::iroken days, during the firnt of which we meaRured abou~ Reven-eighthR of a mile, and on the three others a mile or more than a mile each day, reaching the east end of the base on Monday eve11ing. Thus, counting in the broken days, 5.4 miles were measured in eight days. This time included the markiL.g of five permanent points near to the ends of the successive miles where stone posts have since been placed. The ends of the base will be marked by regular monuments. The base of the monument at the west end is cut from the ledge of rockf; upon which the signal stands. By the kindness of Professor Fairman Rogers I have been enabled to collect approximately some of the statistics of the measurement in a tabular form, (No. I.) A second table contains the comparison with tho other five Coast Survoy basos which I have measured.

APPENDIX No. 27.
Report of Dr. B. A. Gould, J1·., assistant, on the progress made in telegraph campaigns for differences of 'longitude, and the preparation of results.for publication.
CAMBRIDGE,

MASS., October ], 1857.

DEAR Srn : During the past year the work of reduction and computation of the telegraphic campaigns for the longitude has progressed rapidly, and copious materials have been collected for the volume upon the results of the telegraphic longitude measurements of the Coast "Survey; The large quantity of data already collected, and consequent pressure of the work of reduction, combined with other motives to render me anxious to be relieved from field duty, and to devote my whole attention to the computations and the deduction of results from the abundant store already accumulated. With your approval, therefore, the entire charge of the observations at the south wa.s left to Messrs. Dean and Goodfellow, whose experience of many years and unweary39 (i1

ing zeal succeeded in ultimately accomplishing the connection of Montgomery with ¥obile by mean8 of an intermediate station at Lower Peach Tree, (Ala, )-as described in full by Mr. Dean in his report. The methods used have been esBentially the same as arranged for previous years, and aro described in foll detail by M:r. Dean in the very faithful account appended to your last annual report. The chief advance consist;;; in the preparation and adoption of a standard catalogue of right ascensions of stars for determination of time and azimuth, analogous to the list·, of right ascensions of circumpolar stars, appended to my report of last year. The details of the preparation of this "Time-star list" will shortly be presented to you in a separate report. Meanwhile, I have the honor to offer herewith, in a special report, the discussion of the places of the 48 stars of the circumpolar catalogue, declinations included. The necessity of an intermediate station between Montgomery and Mobile, imposed by tho extremely unfavorable condition of the telegraph line, entailed a large amount of labor ; but even after this intermediate station was established, it was only with great difficulty that signals could be simultaneously communicated in both directions. On one occasion, indeed, as is now evident, both clocks were breaking circuit, one at each extremity of the line, and both observers tapping, but without the signals from either station reaGhiug the other. Various expedients ·were resorted to for remedy, but neither an increased number of cups, nor increased surface of the elements proved of sufficient avail, and it is evident that incomplete insulation and inadequate connexions must have combined to render the communication so difficult. A necessary result was great difficulty in the armature adjustment, leading to indistinctness of the records, and great embarrassment in the reading off. The experience of the earlier campaigns led to my conviction of the importance of some guard, not only against accidental errors in the process of reading off the observations, but also against personal equation in the application of the glass reading-scales. Such personal equation would enter into a longitude determination to its whole amount, unless the corresponding records at both stations were read off by the same individual. The plan which I have in all cases adopted for the last two or three years has been : first, to have every register read by two different persons and the reading compared in cases of discrepancy by a third; and, second, that the corresponding records at the two stations be read by tho same assistant. The amount of labor is necessarily great, but the trustworthiness of the results is more than commensurate. I find that the average discordance between practiced readers does not often exceed 0'.02 for the fillets, and o·. 03 for the chronograph sheets_ There is, in some cases, indication of a personal equation in reading off, amounting to two or three hundredths of a second, but all such effects are entirely eliminated by the mode of combination. From present appearances, I am inclined to believe that, with the assistance with which I um at present provided, the whole series of longitude campaigns undertaken since I first took charge of the telegraph longitudes in 1852 will be fully reduced and ready for the press before the time for my next annual report- The material for the desired volume is already assuming shape and consjstency ; and the coming winter will, I trust, enable Messrs_ Dean and Goodfellow to connect the stations already erected at Mobile and New Orleans. We shall then have the following longitude determinations by the electric telegraph carried out since 1852 : 1Vashington-Raleigh. Raleigh-Charleston. Washington-Petersburg. Raleigh-Columbia.

Peach Tree-Mobile. :Mobile-New Orleans, in addition to the Bangor-Calais connection in the north, no\v going on under yom· own supervision, and such other northern campaigns as may be carried out during the next Reason. The connection of Macon with Sanmnah at some future time "·ouldJ'urnish a duplicate series between Raleigh and .Macon similar to that already olitained between Washington and Columbia; and if the New Orleans station be then astronomica11y connected with Cincinnati by means of the western line of wire, a magnificent check will he provided, Cincinnati having long ago been connected with the Seaton station by Mr. Walker. Three intermediate stat.ions, one of which might, if desired, be directly connected with :Macon, will doubtless suffice for this desirable end; and if the reasonably anticipated accordance be once attained, we shall be in possession of a series of standard points of reference for the continent which the Coast Survey may regard with great and warrantable pride; a system of standard zeros such as was never before kno-wn, and until the invention and introduction by the Coast Survey of our .American method, never pm1sible. Should lt appear desirable, several cross-connections can readily be made to this beautiful net-work of longitude determinations, and the labors of Mr. Walker have already extended its tributary ~nnections to the north and east. Longitude measurements, which already have l1cen very desirable, and which will be attended ·with much less embarrassment aml difficulty than those further south, will extend the system of mutually dependent points, and amplify the reticulations; and we may reasonably hope, in the near future, to see the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States studded with stations whose relative position is certain within onetenth of a second of time, as they now are with stations whose astronomical latitude is trustworthy to within a second of arc. Among the most interesting general results, it may not be inappropriate here to mention one or two. The mean error of a transit over a single thread does not, from the experience ?f several campaigns, appear to be of an essentially different order, whether recorded UfA)Il the chronographic register by means of taps, or noted through the employment of eye or ear hy an astronomer of skill and experience. The mean deviation of a single tap from the mean of 15 or 25 varies usually from about o·.11 under favorable circumstances to 0".15 in unfavorable ones. This statement has reference, of course, to the portable 30-inch transit instruments of the Coast Survey. The most experienced and accurate observers may claim for their results an equal degree of precision, but if this be conceded, it must also be remembered how close and devoted attention is requisite, and how great is the fatigue accompanying the concentration of effort. And there is no risk in asserting that the mean error of ordinary observers by eye and ear far exceeds this limit, even when we disregard the influence of any constant inaccuracy in the scale of subdivision of seconds. This most fruitful source of incorrect results is of necessity entirely eliminated in the chronographic method. But little doubt exists in my mind that the use of higher magnifying powers will diminish the amount of mean discordance; and I trust that the new and powerful instruments of the Dudley Observatory may soon afford the means of submitting this question to a practical test.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The experience of a decade enables us at present to form our judgment with gre;;i.t confidence concerning the advantages and disadvantages of the chronographic method. Prominent among the latter is the lalior entailed by the uecessity of reading off the records, especially when, as in the case of our longitude determinations, the degree of accuracy required will not authorize reliance upon the unchecked figures of a single reader. To this disadvantage is to be added the care (not great) required by the chronograph, and the possibility of its derangement. On the other hand the record of every tap is automatic, ineffaceable, easily )egible, and capable of preservation w·ithout difficulty, qualities which quite compensate the former objections and leave the rornaining and chief advantages without drawback; the great gain cousists then chiefly in the following points : 1. Tho needlessness of long experience to insure accuracy in observation, inasmuch as we find the observations of young untrained assistants to be often quite as good as any, and not unfrequently superior to those long accustomed to astronomical work. 2. 'l'he greatly diminished effort on the part of the observer, so that forty stars, on fifteen or twenty-five threads, may be observed with less fatigue than twenty over seven threads in the old method by eye and ear. 3. Tho larger number of threads over which the transit may be observed and the consequent gain in accuracy. 4. 'l'he freedom from errors arising from a uniformly distorted estimation of the subdivisions of the second-a source of error from which no astronomer seems to be wholly free, and which the observations of many show to be so serious as to demand, in delicate r . . arches, a systematic translation of their estimated t~nths of a second into those fractional parts which investigation shows to correspond. 5. The smaller personal equation, and the facility and minuteness with which it may be determined. 6. The reference of different observations to the indications of one and the same clock-an absolutely indispensable requisite for longitude measurements, and of paramount importance even in an observatory. During the past few years numerous experiments have been made, and their results published in different. European countries, for the telegraphic determination of longitudes. In most cases the methods have been extremely crude, and the results highly discordant from those previously obtained by moon culminations, occultations, and even from terrestrial signals. Still they appear to have been adopted without hesitation. My apprehension is that subsequent experiments will shake the confidence now apparently bestowed upon these results, but should this be the case, the telegraphic met.hod cannot be held responsible, for fo the best of my belief it has not been fairly applied. The pl'Ocesses of the Coast Survey, even in the infancy of the method ton years ago, were environed with safeguards which seem to have been w110Ily neglected in the European operations to which I refer. The accordances between the results obtained on different nights are, in some instances, so wondrously close as almost to compel the conviction of some overpowering constant error, and in other cases so discordant as to excite grave misgivings as to the mode of operation. Without the use of recording apparatus at each end, without tho entire absence of any intermediate signal apparatus analogous to repeaters, and without full elimination of the time consumed in the transmission of the si~als, trustworthy determinations of the longitude cannot reasonably be anticipated. The results of former years relative to the velocity of the signals are confirmed by each

successive campaign, and experiments, made by va1-ying the battery power on different night<', seem to lead irresistibly to the conviction that this velocity varies, according to some simple law, with the intensity of the current. Among the most singular phenomeua is one for which I am, as yet, unprepared to offer any explanation, although its existence appears beyond dispute, namely : that the deduced velocity is different for signals sent in the two directions. Since the only available means for its measurement is by comparison of the two records of the interval between a clock signal, which travels in one direction, and a tap signal, ·which tmvels in the opposite one, we cannot assume that the discordance is due to a difference of velocity in the t\YO direct,ions, since, even if such a difference existed, it would not be made manifest· 'rhe batteries being at the extremities of the line and in immediate communication with the ground, the idea of any unequal resistance to conr1uction, arising from their um;ymmetrical position, is altogether precluded. A concise summary of the velocity results deduced from the Wilmington-Columbia campaign will illustrate the character and the amount of the phenomenon of which I speak. A small table will readily exhibit the mean excess of the interval between.the clock signals and the observation signals, as recorded at the clock station, over the same interval as recorded at the other station. Any apparent results deduced from comparison of the records of observation would, of course, be simply illusory were they other than zero, although the influence of errors in reading off or of uncompensated irregularities of any one of the chronographs may thus be made manifest. I have consequently incorporated in the table the amount of excess for observations made at the clock station, in order, by comparison, to show the reality of the velocity measurement and the order of discordance which may reasonably be attributed to the above named errors. In every case the ground connection was with the. platinode at Wilmington and the zincode at Columbia. The distance of the two stations is, at the Lest estimate, two hundred miles, including a submerged cable, 687 feet long, across the Cape Fear river. The line was entirely new, having been put up within a few months. The number of cups was always the same at each end of the line.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The decrease of the amount of discordance as the strength of the current increased ,cannot escape remark. At some not distant period I propose to present in full detail the results of these velocity measures as afforded by the different campaigns. The supervision of the preparation for observations at the Dudley observatory has demanded a large amount of care and attention. The trustees have now nearly completed this observatory aud taken measures to equip it. with instruments of the l1ighest order, capable of rendering essential service to science and greatly facilitating the coast survey operations, both by fnrniflhing accurate places of latitude stars and by the triangulation of the Pleiades. This latter operation will contribute largely to tho facility and precision of the astronomical determinations of longitude, according to the methods of Professor Peirce, in cases whore tho use of the electrotelegraphic method is not practicable. Dr. C. H. F. Peters has been stationed at the observatory during the entfre year, charged with the immediate supervision, and with a careful determination of the latitude by means of the zenith telescope. I hope soon to transmit his report upon latitudes. He has, at the same time, been employed in the computation of tho Pleiades occultations for P_rofessor Peirce, preparatory to the fuller development of the longitude methods of this astronomer, who will speak for himself on this subject. 'Ve anxiously await the completion of the heliometer, by Mr. Spencer, in order to proceed to tht! work of triangulating the Pleiades, for which, as well as the determination of latitude stars, the trustees of the observatory have so handsomely placed tho observatory and its instruments at the disposal of the Coast Survey. All seems now to promise that, before the time for mynext annual report, the magnificent instruments of the observatory may have been received, mounted, and made to render important service to all the astronomical parties of the survey, as well as to the office for the reduction and computation of former observations. Throughout the year I have been aided in the work of reductions by Messrs. J. H. Toomer, A. E. Winslow, and A. T. Mosman, who have labored with interest, assiduity, and zeal, and for whose constant and ready assistance I desire to return my best acknowledgment. To l\Ir. Toomer I am also indebted for constant assistance in the preparation of the two star lists, to which be has devoted much care and with great success. w·ith sincere respect, I remain, dear sir, most faithfully and truly yours, B. A. GOULD, JR. Prof. A. D. BACHE, LL. D., Superintendent United Sta~es Ooa.<;t Survey.

Moesta, superintendent of the Chilian observatory at St. Jago, and other observers on the western coast. The occultations of sta1·s have had, usually, two or more observers at this station. You will be gratified to learn that, assisted by Messrs. Whipple & Black, of Boston, we have succeeded, at this observatory, in obtaining photographic impressions of st,ars down to the sixth magnitude, and of the surface of the moon so distinct as to show the posit.ions of A and A' Messier, and other similar bright points, very nearly as well as they are seen with an object glass of 2i- inches aperture-that. is, with about the quantity of light of one of the fortyeight inch transits. On the night of the occultation of Spica, June 2d, we obtained many photographic impressions of the moon and star >vhen near conjunction. The star, when approaching the moon's enlightened limb, appears to lose in-intensity of light, so much so that stars of the fifth and sixth magnitude are usually lost sight of before c011tact with the bright limb of the moon, and are -not seen on emersion until they are some distance from it; but in regard to the photographs of Spica, taken on the night of the 2d of June, tho impression of the star upon the plate seemed to be as strong when the star \Yas in apparent conjunction with the moon's limb as it was whsn at a considerable distance from it. At the request of Prof. De Moesta, I have prosecuted a series of declination observations on the north and south limbs of the planet Venus when near its inferior conjunction, in the months of April, May, and June last. No difficulty was experienced in obtaining observations on the day of conjunction. Prof. De l\focsta was to have made simultaneous observations at the government observatory in Chili. At the suggestion of Sir William E. Logan, I have been in electro-telegraphic communication with Lieut. A.she, R. N. After much delay and many disappointments, we have at length succeeded in interchanging a full and satisfactory series of electric signals, which will afford tho data for an accurate determination of the difference of longitude between Cambridge and Quebec by the route of Portland and lfontreal.

The labors of the Coast Survey for the determination of the longitude of some central positions upon this continent have been conducted with singular consistency, according to the method commenced by S. 0. Walker. The conclusions which seem to have been hitherto

established are, that neither by moon culminations nor by the tram1portation of chronometers is there any reasonable hope of obtaining a longitucle which can be relied upon nearer than to about a second of time, and that the further multiplication of observations by either of thelc'c processes is not likely to lead to results of any higher order of approximation. Until, therefore, the Atlantic telegraph shall be successfully accomplished, the method of solar eclipses and occultations must remain unrivalled in accuraf:y, and the labor of bringing this method to its full measure of perfection is no longer to be postponed. Upon the u8e qf the .wilar eclipses. The solar eclipses have the great advantage of facility of observation, as then the same eclipse is observea in a sufficient variety of places to correct all of the elements of the tableR, except those dependent upon parallax. In Walker's reports upon longitudes in the years 18,18 and 1851 this matter wmi specially considered, and the importance of Henderson's correction of the constant of lunar parallax and Longstreth's correction of the theory were amply discussed, the mean error of the previous computations determined, and the correctness of these researches has been fully established by the profound investigations of Hansen. In reference to this subject permit me to )"emark, that after carefully reading these reports, I am constrained to declare that Mr. Walker, in his generosity, was far too liberal in the amount of credit which he awarded to me ; so far as I can remember, all the details of the suggestions were his own, and they were so judicious that my part was only to approve the~. This portion of the work cannot, however, be regarded as properly concluded until all the eclipses have been recomputed by means of the latest tables of the sun and moon ; and it is also important that the subsequent eclipses which have been observed should be thoroughly reduced, and especially that of July 28, 1851. This latter eclipse was so well observed in Europe and America, that I am disposed to think that the longitude -obtained from this eclipse alone will be nearly or quite as valuable as that which has been hitherto derived from all other sources. The reductions of this eclipse are quite far advanced among my manuscripts, and will at any time be placed at the disposal of tho Coast Survey. Tho chief difficulty in the solar eclipses may now be regarded as dependent upon the personal equations of the observers, which cannot easily be eliminated, because the phases of the eclipse, which are nearly simultaneous in Europe and America, are the reverse of each other ; that is, the emernion in America corresponcls to the immersion. in Europe. It is probable, nevertheless, that the longitude determined from tho solar eclipses may be depended upon to about a half or a third of a second of time. Upon the occultations

Even with the advantage of Hansen's new tables of the moon, it is not probable that isolated occulations can at present be rendered available for the nice determination of distant longi~udes, because they are so much affected by the small errors which still remain in the places of the moon and of the stars, and by the undetermined irregularities of the lunar disc. It has, therefore, been found necessary to resort to the mutually dependent occultations of the Pwifldes. The ultimate necessity of this method of solving the problem of the longitude was clearly foreseen by W<dker, and in his report of 1848 he suggests that it is proper ''to institu~e a f uU discussion of all the ol>servations qf occultations of stars in the group ef the Pleicules extant in any courdry.

Tbe equations required for conducting- this in\-ei'tiQ"ation have been given in my previous reports. Dr. Peters has been cmriloyed in collecting· the data for the application of the formulm and in making- the prelimi1rnry computation:" re<Juircd for their disClrn,;ion, a.swell as the prediction,.; h:- wl1ich the ndditicmal c1;1ta may he securer!. which are still wantiuµ, upon thi;;; cmlli11eut.. The data consist, of course, of the extant recon];; referred to by TValker, of 1vhich Dr. Peters has collected many thouf'and. so that they are probabl3' sufficient for all the purposes of the theory. The difficulties of the inve"tigatiou am undoubtedly great, and it will require judgment and skill to conduct it to a suc:cc:-;;-:ful conclusion. At the recorded instant of each ol>served immersinn and emer~ion the clistnnce of the star from the lunar disc is to be computed from the ephemeris of tl1e moon. \Y ere there no Brrors in the tables, in the records of the observer, or in his g-eop:rnphical po>:ition, and no irregularities in the disc of the moon, the computed distance would vanisb in cmTrcspondence with the observation. But besides the errors of observatiou, there are those of the latitudes and longitudes of the moon and star;;;, and of the lunar parallax and l'emi-cliamcter, and of the longitude of the oliservcr. The tabular and constant error;;i mu,:;t fin;t be determined Lefore it can be known what remains to be divided between the ob;;;,erYer and the irret'ularitics of the moon's disc. There is much Teasou to hope that the lunar parallax a11d latitude ~·iyen by Hansen will prove to be so accurate as to require no further correction ; and this will l>e assumed until it shall be found to be incompatible with the observations. It i;;;. also probable that the moon's motion in longitude is given with sufficient precision. Bessel's re la tin~ pluces of the Pleiades for 1840 cannot need to be corrected, but their mutual changes of position \'ill cause much perplexity of computation until the new s.urvey :,;hall have been instituted b3- Dr. Gould with the heliometer of the Dudley observatory ; and it is greatly to be desired that this important national institution shall be placed as 8oon as possible in complete workin~ condition. After setting aside these various sources of error ar:; unimportant, there will remain the conE<tant error of the moon's longitude for each night, the error of the constant of the moon· s >'cmidiameter, the error in the geographical longitude of the observer, the irregularities of the lunar disc, and the errors of observation. In the first approximation the irregularities of the disc will be neglected, as well as those of the longitudes of the observers, except for place;, in America, and the_ investigation ,.,-ill be restricted to the determination of the coHect 1ong:itufie of the moon and its mean semi-diameter. In the second approximation the irregularities oft he lunar disc will be the special object of inquiry, subject, however, to the errors of observatiou; and the longitudes of the European observatories will, in the course of this eo1111mtation. be carefully scrutinized, and will probably need to be corrected in io;ome of the less accurately determined positions. To investigate its irregularities, the surface of the moon will he divided into zones of three minutes of ai·c in geoc;entric latitude, commencing with the lunar equator and extending so as to comprise four zones on each side of this equator. The character of the irregularities· as to form, position, and approximate height, must, as far as possible, be determined from direct observation, and here again it is greatly to be desired that the assistance of the Dudley observatory ma.y be secured, and its immediate co-operation obtained in this difficult and delicate research. To conduct these observations properly will require skilful and wise direction i but it is worthy of notice that the libration of the moon, w11ich seriously embarrasses the measurement of the heights by means of the Pleiades, will, on the contrary, facilitate their determination by direct observation. But when the heights shall have 40 e

It is proposed to connect the triangulations of the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of ~Iexico by a series of triangles across the peninsula, from near Fernandina. to near Cc~dar Keys, the termiui of the air line railroad. The importance of this connection will be obvious ·when the distaucc .arouud the peninsula and the nature of the triangulation whicl1 will envelope it are considered. A reconnaissance liad Rhown such a triangulation to be p1;acticable, and it was desirable to keep the general direction of the line alroac:!y reforred to. The latitude of the two termini had been observed and the longitude of a point on one of the Cedar Keys. The determination of tlie longitude of Fernandina would furnish the remaining element needer], and alf'o an important datum for the geodetic work of the coast of Georgia and Florida, already in progress. 'l'he longitude of Savannah had been obtained hy telegraph, and the conncc.tion of Fernandina with it was easily made l1y the transportation of chronometers in the
steamers running twice a week between Savannah and the St. John's and stopping at Fernandina. It is proposed to give an account of tho operations of this expedition, with the results for personal equation, for the performance of the chronometers under different circumstances, and other,;, arnl of the final determinations of the difference of longitude. The incidental results will probably have more interest for the American Association than the mere longitude question, though as the two best maps differ some nine miles iu tJw longitude of Fernandina, the final result must, in a practical point of view, be esteemed of gre:it imporfance. Early in the spring of the preiwnt year aITangements were made for executing this work by a party under the immediate direction of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey. The old a;,;tronomical station near the Exchange in the city of Savannah was re-arranged and furnisl1cd with suitable in:>truments. This station is on the bank of the Savannah river and forty.four foet above mean low water, commanding a good view of the heavens both to the south and the north. It has one drawback, namely, that the st.one supporting the transit instrument re;:;ti\ upon an arch, and that the vibration from heavy vehicles passing in the street is communicated to the instrument, affecting, in a degree, the accordance of individual results,· but not sensil;ly the final determination of time. Tho outfit of the station consisted of transit instrument No. 3, by Troughton and Siwms, with a focal length of forty inches and a magnifying power of seventy; of an observing chronometer, (sidereal,) No. 1707, by John Fletcher; and of the usual meteorological instrument~. The observations generally were made at this station by the Superintendent, replaced for a fe"· days in the early part of the work by Assistants Charles A. Schott and Charles O. Boutelle. Mr. J. H. Toomer was the aid in the party.

was as follows : 1st, the level was read ; 2d, ..a low star was observed for azimuth ; )M, two zenith stars for time ; 4th, the level was again read. Occasionally special observations for co1limation were made by reversals on PolariR on the middle wire. 'l'he Savannah transit had seven wires and the FernaIJ<lina nine. The probablu error of time for the transit over all the wires of each transit was about the same namely ± 0".11. This includes any error of right asccns1011. The places of the stars were taken from the Greenwich Nautical Almanac. The equatorial intervals of the wires of the two transits were known to within a probable -error of ± o·. 0.5 and ± 0".04 respectively. The value of one division of the level of transit No. 3 was found to be 1".05 ± 0".02 and of No. 10, 0".73 ± 0".02. Observations made for the purpose sho\\· that the pivots of the first nam_ed instrument are sensibly equal, und gave for the second a correction which at the greatest is 0'. 02, the clamp pivot being the larger. Fifteen hundred and twelve trnrniits were observed at Savannah and twelve hundred and sixty-nine at Fernandina. They were all reduced by the method of least squares. In (;bserving, time was marked for the Superiutendent by Mr. Toomer. Mr. Schott marked time for himself. The records were kept by Mr. Toomer and Mr. Blankenship. Personal equation.-Observations on alternate wires for personal equation, between the Superintendent and Assistant Boute11~, showed no sensible difference, time being marked for both by Mr. Toomer. Ten stars observed on April 4th gave for personal equation - 0'. 01 ± 0'. 02 and seven stars on the 6th 0'. 05 ± 0'..02. The following are the results for personal equation between the Superintendent and Assistant Schott.

The result is: B - S o·. 58 ± 0'. 04, which has been applied when necessary. The resn1fa am remarkably accordant when the variety of circumstances is considered. The first were made when the first observer had the day before arrived from a fatiguing journey, and the second had had several days of practice. In the second and third, both observers were in full practice, the second having had but a brief interval from work for the short trip from Fernan· dina by water. The practice had been, it is true, with the smaller instrument at Fernandina. In the last series both were fresh from the short trip to Fernandina; the first had been in full practice with the large instrument, but had not used the smaller one. The probable error of one determination varies under the different circumstances, within the limits of± o·. 10 & ± o·. 14, under the circumstances already stated, while the average. is still preserved. In a few cases the first observer took the star's passage over the first four, and the last, the second three wires of the transit. The results for personal equation were grouped for stars observed for illumination east, and then west, for the two observers leading, respectively, for stars north and south of the zenith, and for lo:w and high stars, without sensible deviations from the mean value. To determine how much of this large personal equation was due to the difference between the marking of .time by Mr. Schott and Mr. Toomer, and how-much to the

difference of observation of the star's passage over the wires, Mr. Toomer was directed on the 26th of A.pril to mark time for both observers. Eleven stars were thns oh;;erved with a personal equation of B - S = 0". 30 ± 0'. 03; thns 0'28, or nearly one-half of the perRonal equation, was due to the difference in marking time, or ear perception, and the ot1ier half to the difference in the observation of the transit, or the eye perception. This supposes the tapping to be simultaneous with the perception of the transit, and on the average this is probably really so. Diagram No. 2 showR the separate valneR found for personal equation, and presents some results worthy, when time and opportunity serve, to be further pursued. The steadiness to the mean, with large accidental fluctuations on the first night, and the running up on the nights of the 23d and 24th, towards the close, and down on the 26th, are very curiouE. Tem~rature c-0mpensation.-The compensation of chronometers is never perfect for any considerable range of temperature. Professor W. C. Bond pointed out, in the CoaRt Survey chronometer expedition between Camb1·idge and Liverpool, the consequences of this, and elaborately examined the rates at the different temperatures to which the chronometers were likely to be subjected in the different voyages. Diagrams Nos. 3 and 4 show conclusively the over compensation of the observing chronometers used at the two stations, the curves of rate and of temperature corresponding remarkably. Twenty-four conditional equations between the observed rate and temperature were found for Savannah and seventeen for Fernandina, and the solution of the normal equations gave the . correction t~ be applied to the rate of each chronometer for temperature as follows: Chron. 1707 rt= + Q·.12 - 0. 095 (t - 56°.9.) 311 rt=+ o·.36 - 0.155 (t - 61°.0.) where rt is the daily rate in second;;; at the mean temperature t. The results were thus reduced to a mean temperature, and the remaining irregularities were equalized graphically. These corrections were applied during the interval between the time of observations of transits and of the comparison of the chronometers in determining the error of the chronometer on si<:l.erial time for the epoch of the comparison. Chronometer comparisons. -Each set of chronometer comparisons consists of r;. double operation, the repetition being considered necessary to insure correctness. The chronometers beating half seconds, there is a coincidence of beat between the comparing chronometer and a mean time chronometer every minute, and between the comparing and siderial chronometer every minute and a half. The comparing chronometer was observed, in turn, in a regular order with each of the others, passing from one end of the box containing them to the other, and then back again to the first. To the mean of the observed times of coincidence of beats a small correction is applied for the gain of the comparing chronometer on mean or on siderial time, giving the chronometer time at the common epoch of comparison. To these times the corrections already referred to were applied. The peculiar arrangement of the chronometers forming one set and the order of comparison, and the reduction of the chronometer time of all the chronometers to a common epoch, viz : the chronometer time of the observing sidereal chronometer, is exhibited in the following specimen of record. The small correction is owing to the gain of the comparator or mean time of its rtll" part, a.nd on sidereal time of its rf"lr part of the interval. No. 1507 is the comparator, 1707 the sidereal observing chronometer, and the rest are wean time chronometlirs.

+ to the chTOnometer correction

indicates ·' chronometer slow,'' and when applied to

the rate it indicates "chronometer losjng ;'' the reversed sign applies to chronometer fo.st and to gaining rate.

Stationary and travelling rates.-The next step is the determination of the stationary and travelling rates of the chronometers. The !'ltationary rates resulted directly from the observed change (corrected) and the interval between the time of arrival and departure at each station.

In making these reductions it was found most convenient to Iegard the chronometers as sid,·real ones with a large rate; stationary Iatcs IYere deduced for eight intervals, four at each station for each c:hronometer. 'The travelEng rates were oLtained by deducting from the whole interval behl"ecn the depnrture from aud return to the same station the shorter stationary interval at the other station. to ·obtain the sidereal travelling interval ; and from the whole change of chronometer time, the change during the stationary intervaL to obtain the travelling change. The following specimen of reduction illustrates this process: Voyage No. 2, sei. No. 2, Initial station, Savannah.

These travelling rates were ascertained for the trips fro~ Savannah and baek again, as wcJl as from Fernandina and back ; and b;r using these, approximate values for the difference of longitude were obtained. The error arising from the assumption of equal travelling rates for tho outward and home trip of each jour.qey, implied in this process for deducting the travelling rates, is partially corrected by taking the mean of the longitudes from and to Savannah, and from and to Fernandina.,

Comparing the travelling rates of the separate trips with the average travelling rate before found for the voyage, or trip to and fro, the differences will be seen to be quite small, showing the satisfactory character of the first hypothesis, from which the approxin;iate longitude was deduced. Having thus the individual travelling rates for the several chronometers of each set, a difference of longitude was deduced by using it in combination with the stationary rate, as follows: Trip No. 1. · Set ~o. 1.

This table shows such a decided difference between the longitudes given by the two sets of chronometers, or what may be call!3d a "personal equation between the two sets, even after the application of corrections for the temperature deduced for each instrument, that it wa~ deemed advisable to try ·whether if the tvrn sets were exposed to identically the same circumstances this difiel'.ence would remain. They were therefore carried, side by side, from Savannah to Fernandina and back, and carefully rated at both places. The resulting longitude for set No. 1 was lm. 28s.6., and for set No. 2 was Im. 29s.3., agreeing with th~ former results. In accordance with tho method of reduct.ion pursued, the relative weight to the result by each chronometer will depend on the changes of rate of the successive trips. Let n = the number ofrates x 1 x 2 · · · ·or n - 1 =the number of changes of rates, and L: b. XJ =the minimum sum of squares of differences of rates, then the probable error of a change of rate,

one which has been commonly adopted is, by turning the micrometer at right angles to the position in which it is used for making latitude observations, and noting the times of the passage of Polaris, on any close circumpolar star near culmination, over the micrometer wire, placed at the successive turns or half turns of the screw. The method now in use is, by observing the star near elongation, when rapidly rising or falling with but a slight motion in azimuth; this method avoids the displacement of the micrometer, and as the level is read at every alternate noting, any disturbance of the instrument in the direction of the vertical can be corrected for. It is necessary in this method to apply a correction for difference of refraction. · Let H be the hour angle of the star reckoned from elongation, and x" the number of seconds of arc in the direction of the vertical from elongation, and A the north polar distance of the star, then ,,_ Sin.

It is convenient to apply the term ~· (15 sin. 1") 2 H to the observed time of noting. It is added to the observed time before, and subtracted after either elongation. The following table gives the value of t (15 sin. 1")2 H 3 for every minute of time from elongation up to 44m. H.

the present, the change in refraction. Various methods of combination may be adopted for the determination of the value of one turn of the screw. That used in the following example is probably as good as any other, and recommends itself by its simplicity. The correction for refraction to the value of one turn is negative for either eastern or western elongation, and aquals the change of refraction for the space equal to one turn. It is obtained from the proportion3600" : diff. of refr' n ·for 1° at star's alt. = value of I turn : corr' n.

Correction for refracUon.-One of the great advantages of the determination of latitude by zenith telescope observations is, that the correction for refraction is very small, being for the difference merely of the two refractions on each fj.ide of the zenith. The correction for temperature and pressure of the atmosphere is insignificant. The refraction being nearly proportion~I to the tangent of the zenith distance, the difference of refraction for the two stars of the pair will be given by the formqla r, - r,. = 58" sin. (z. - !") sec2 · z,. The following table gives the value of ~ (r. - r,,) for every minute of difference of zenith distance up to 24' and for different zTmith distances. Correction for refraction to be used in correcting observations with zenith telescope.

Six Year Catalop:ueR, and Rumker' s Catalogue, afford ready means for their selection and th6 computation of their places·~ 1. The latitude of the place should be known within one or two minutes. 2. The difference of zenith distance of the south and north stars should not exceed a conve. nient range of the micrometer-say, fifteen minutes, corresponding (in the instrument,; in use) to about twenty turns of the micrometer 3. The interval of time bet\\·een tl1e culmination of the stars, of a pair, should not be lcf's than one minute, so as to give time deliberately to read the micrometer and to turn the im1tru· ment in azimuth, to be prepared for obt>crvation, and should not exceed about twent.r minutes, to avoid changes in the instrument. 4. The interval between the pairs should afford time for reading the micrometer and levq and for setting the instrument for the next pair. This ·will var:·'"' ith differeut ob><ervern, hut three minutes is about the time adopted by most of our ob:<ervers. "'hen the iutervals between the pairs are unavoidably long, they may be filled up by observing tra11"1it8 for time. 5. The 6~ mag·nitude is the least that admits of easy observation ·with tlrn telescopes which we use ; we commonly observe ·with a magnifyi11g po>Yer of fifty or sixty. 6. All stars marked '·doubtful'' are rejected i in general, tho:-;e haviug but one authority are not taken. 7. In order to be certain to embrace all dei<irable combination;;;, the catalogues are to be con· suited from the earliest RA ·which the daylight, at the time of beginning the series of observations, permits, to the latest hour at which it i;; desirable to observe. 8. Since z. - z = 2 L - (D. D or= :.! colat., the stars are ;,:elecfed \vhose declinations are such that z, - z .. is within tl1e preRcril·ed limit,.. It iR de,.;iral1le that the algebraical sum of the z, - zn for all the pairs shall be IJearly zero, so that the error arisiBg; from any uncertainty in the value of the micrometer be eliminated in the final result for latitude. Sources qf e1701· in the determfoation ef the value of micrometcr.-Thc value of the micrometer, as obtained from observations made for that purpose, may be in error from either of the following causes: 1st. The observations may not be sufficiently numerous. 2d. When the observations are made on a close circumpolar ::;tar near culmination, a slight disturbance of the instrument in azimuth will vitiate the result. A considerable disturbance will be readily detected from the observations themselves, but t>light disturlrnn~es, continually occurring in the same direction, may remain undetected and, by their accumiilation, very much vitiate the result. 3. There is yet another source of error which, there is reaRon to bclie>e, is of more common occurrence than the preceding ; this arises from a change of focal adjustment in turning the micrometer at right angleR, in order to bring it into the position used in making the latitude observations, after having made observations on a close circumpolar star, near culmination, for value of micrometer. The two latter sources of error. are avoided by observing the star near elongation.

The probable errors of the different catalogue stars must also be modified, so as to make them also depend on the number of authorities or number of observations used in the deterwination of their declinations; for further information on this subject, see a manuscript paper on computation of star places.

COMPUTING DIVISION, COAST f-1RVEY OFFICE,

January 28, 1857.
DEAR

Sm : In conformity with the Superintendent's direction, a discussion of the gradual

loss of magnetism of the several magnets used in tho survey has been made, and the results are herewith respectfully submitted. This paper may be considered as a continuation of the series of magnetic results published in the Coast Survey reports of 1855 and 1856. The computations were made by Mr. J. Main, of the computing division. Before the deduced magnetic moments of the magnets observed at different periods could be compared, it was necessary to reduce the magnetic moments to a uniform standard temperature, for which: 62° Fahrenheit was adopted. Let m equal the magnetic moment at the standard 11 temperature, m, the same at any temperature, t and q the change of magnetic moment for change of 1° temperature, then

rn = rnt [l (t - G2°) q]. By means of this formula the observed m. have all been reduced to the standard temperature. The resulting m and the discussion is best preceded by a short historical note of the magnets which have been used for the determination of horizontal intensity. Magnet S 8, belonging to declinometer C. S. No. 1, (Jones 22,) length 3.25 inches, was used as a deflector by Capt. Lee, during the years 1845, '46, and '4 7, at thirty stations in Sections I and III. Within this period it was also used by Mr. Boutelle at three stations in Section IV. In 1848 it was used by Mr. Ruth at four stations in Sections I and III. In 1849 it was used by Mr. Boutelle at Breach inlet; at Marriott and Kent island by Mr. Hewston; at Patuccawa by Mr. Boutelle; and at }It. Independence by Mr. Davidrmn. In 1850 it was used by Mr. Davidson at Edisto island; then by Mr. Dean, who used it till the end of 1851 at Soper, IIill, Webb, Ca us ten, Mt. Pleasant, and Cape Small. In the early part of 1852 this declinometer passed into ithe hands of l\fr. Hilgard, who, however, did not use S 8 as a deflector, but the longer magnet C 32, (at Depot Key.) About the middle of 1852 this dcclinometer again pa~sed into the hands of Mr. Dean, who (with the exception of one station (Allston) occupied by 1\Ir. Boutelle) has continued to use it till the present time. At the stations Roslyn, East. Base, Galveston Island, and Jupiter, both S 8 and C 32 were used as deflectors. Since the occupation of Allston by Mr. Boutelle, S 8 has ceased to be used as the deflector. Magnet 0 32, belonging to declinometer C. S. Ko. 1, (Jones 22,) length 3.92 inches, was, as already noticed, first used as a deflector by Mr. Hilgard at Depot Key in 1852, and has been used ever since (with the exception noticed) by Mr. Dean as irnch. LSince the date of this report,-.it has been used at Lower Peach Tree, Alabama, in 18.'>7.] Magnet 0 9, belonging to declinometer C, S. No. 2, (Jones 20,) length 4.00 inches, was first used by Mr. Ruth at Fort Morgan and E. Pascagoula in 1847 ; then by Mr. Fauntleroy at Point Judith, Fort Wooster, and Legget, in the same year. In 1848 it was also used by Mr. Faun..tleroy at Dollar Point. Il'rom 1849. 7 till 1853. 6 it was used exclusively by Mr. Hilgard. It sunk with the schooner Phoenix, in 1854, but was recovered. llfagnet D, belonging to declinometer C. S. No. 4, (Jones,) has been used by Lieut. Trowbridge on our Pacific coast in the years 1853, 1854, and 1855. JJ:fagnet 0 6, belonging to declin1:lmeter C. S. No. 2, (Jone;, 20,) has taken the place of the above magnet C 9 since the accident. It has o~ly as yet been used at two stations, and by Mr. Hilgard in 185.4 and 1855. [Since the date of this report, .M:r. Harris used it at Barrel Key in 1857.]

+

Magnet Ii, belonging to magnetometer C. S. No. 6, (Jones,) length 4 inches, was first used by.Messrs. Hilgard and Harris, in April, 1856, at the magnetic observ:ttory in the Smithsonian grounds, in this city, for the purpose of determining its moment of inertia, mflgnetism, and changes of magnetism for 1° of temperature. It was used by Mr. Schott in August and September, 1856, .at seventeen stations in Section III. [Since the date of this report,' this . magnet has been ·Used !by lrlr. Schott, ,of the Superintendent's· party, at Fernandina, Florida, and at Hutchinson!e island, Georgia, in the spring of 1857.] Note.-The magnet used by Mr. Schott, in 1855, at sixteen stations in Sections I, II, and III, (Appendix No. -l9, "C. S. report of 1&55,) ·belonged to the Smithsonian Institution, and has been used since in Mexico.-(Seepage 214 of Coast Survey report of 1856.)

In order to trace the loss of magnetism in the course of time, the following consideration led to the adoption of the equation of an equilateral hyperbola referred to its asymptotes. In conformity with experience, the loss of magnetism for several months after magnetisation is much greater than afterwards, and generally after the lapse of a few years the magnet appears have approached a stationary condition, which relations can be represented by a hyperbolic curve, the abscissae being the time elapsed and the ordinates the corresponding amount of magnetism.

By means of these formulre the observed values of m have been discussed. In com;equence of m being affected by errors of observers, as well as subject to sudden changes from causes which need no further enumeration here, several trials had to be made to represent the successive values of m, and in some cases it was found necessary to discuss the same magnet in two separate branches, as no continuous curve can possibly represent. sudden changes. Referring to the diagram plate No. 68, the curves represent the computed values, and the dots the observed values of m. That such sudden changes do occur in the magnets in use is known from the fact that magnet 8 8 pt!.SSes from m= 0.58J.7 tom =0.5645 between the 5th and 9th of July, 1849, at Kent island, I. An equally striking example occurred at Nee-ah bay in regard to magnet D, the magnetic moment of this magnet having changed from O. 77 lb to 0. 7495 between the 15th and l6t}i.,of August, 1855. Whatever may be the cause of these sudden changes, there can be no dovbt of the fact, as the vibrationa and deflections eque.lly showed a decided loss of magnetism.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The above formula is empirical, and was used on account of its fitness and convenience ; the following formu1re, by Dr. Lamont, is based upon a physical principle, viz : that the velocity of loss is proportional to the excess of magnetism over that finally retained. Let x be the magnetism of a magnetic bar at the time, t and c the magnetism permanently retained, then the velocity

where q is constant. Integrating we find log. (x - C) = - q t + constant. To find the constant lot B =the magnetism at the time t = o, then x = C + (B - C) .., t. This formula would produce no better agreement between the observed and computed m, and since its numerical application is more laborious, the hyperbolic formula has been used here in preference. lifagnet S 8.-In consequence of the sudden loss of magnetism of this magnet at Kent island I., between July 5 and 9, 1849, it becomes impossible to represent the magnetic moment by the ordinates of the Rame rectangular hyperbola. It will be seen from what follows that a hyperbola has been found which represents tolerably well the values of the magnetic moment from the time commencing observations with this magnet until the break above alluded to. Another hyperbola has boon found which represents still better the remaining portion of the period during which this magnet was used as a de:flector.

Magnet 0 9.-The magnetic moment of C 9 has changed very capriciously. It decreased with co11siderable rapidity from the time it was first brought into use at Fort Morgan, in 184 7, but not with uniformity, until 1850.15, at Cape Florida. From this latter date until 1850. 68 at Kittery Point, it decreased at a more rapid rate than a.t any previous period, and then remained stationary, or nearly so, until it ceased to be used in 1853. The only period, therefore, which can be subjected to hyperbolic law, is from 1847.39 to 1850.15. For y 1.00 we find x = 1844.34, c = 17.949, (and the epoch at origin 1826.393.)

The values after 1850.15 are represented by a straight line. Magnets D, C 6 and II will require further determinations of their magnetic moments before the present values can be discussed. The question as to the propriety of changing the observed m into the deduced m in the final reductions of the magnetic intensity is answered in the negative, for the following reasons : There appear to be minor regular fluctations, such as the first curve of S 8 plainly shows; in other cases observations at consecutive stations show a remarkable coincidence, as the three values for 1849.5, 1849.6 and 1849.8, also 1851.4, 1851.6, and 1851.8, and many others; in all these cases it would be wrong to substitute the computed m. The difference in the determination of the moment of inertia by means of weights and ring may effect tho values of m; for magnet S 8 there appears to be no difference in this respect, the break occurring at another time and at the same station (Kent island); for C 9 the break occurs at the time of change of method, but here the use of balancing rings -..vould affect any conclusion that otherwise could be drawn from it ; the break of C 32 is, however, not owing to this circumstance, since the inertia ring has been used throughout. The magnet H showed, besides a very rapid loss of magnetism at. first, a corresponding shifting of the direction of its magnetic axis. My observatiomi give the reading of the magnetic axis in August, 1856, 16.52, in September, 1856, 19.01, and in April, 1857, 20.49, which latter reading is near the geometrical axis. Yours, very respectfully, CHAS. A. SCHOTT. Capt. M. L. SMITH,

U. S. Top. Eng' rs, Assistant in charge, Coast Survey Office.

On the heights of the tides of the .Allantic coa8t of the United States, from observations in the Coast Survey, by A. D. Backe, Superinwndent.
[Communicated, by authority of the Treaeury Department, t.o the American .AMoeiation for the Advancement of Science.]

It is well known that where a bay or indentation of the coast presents its opening favorably to the tide wave, and decreases in width from the entrance towards its head, that the tides rise
higher and higher frotn the mouth upwards.

The Rev. Mr. Whewell has stated that in a

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.·

343

general way the same fact is deduced from the observations on the coast of Great Britain and Ireland, discussed by him. The Coast Survey observations of the tides of the Atlantic coast, the results of which, from time to time, I have brought before the Association, furnish the means of a complete discussion of heights as well as of times, and very simple generalizations result from their examination. Through the kindness of Captain Shurtland, R. N., and of Adm.iral Bayfield, R. N., I have been enabled to extend these results to the coasts of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and to part uf Newfoundland. I beg leave to make my best acknowledgments to these distinguished hydrographers for the prompt and liberal communication of the results of their observations. The Coast Survey observations have been worked up in the tidal division under the direction of Assistant L. F. Pourtales, and I am indebted to him for giving the results the shape desired, and for the diagrams representing them. The follmving table of stations on or near the exterior coast line of the United Statei:; is taken from the more extended tables of the Coast Survey, omitting stations ·which are up rivers or bays, except in special cases, the object of inserting which will be obvious. Table A contains a number for reference, the locality of the tidal station, the State to which it belongs, the latitude, longitude, the mean height of the tide in feet aud tenths, and a column of remarks.

REPORT OP THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Thesg numboTs may be extended beyoud the turn of Capo Race, where 1he coa;;;t trends to
the weBt of north. hy further nisult;.; of Admiral Bayfield, tl.10ugh the remarks which he makes

sho\v them to he only approximate. Thus two stations on the coast of Labrador, St. Lewis bay, in latitude 52c 10 1 and longitude 55° 37', and Henley island in latitude 52° 00' and longitude 55° 53', give each for the mean of the height of spring and neap tides 2. 3 feet. St. John's, N (ndrrnndlan<l, g:ivcs 5. 0 feet. 'l'repasse.'" harbor, south of it, 5. 8 foet. Bl'J.6m1iu~ with ihe southern end of Table A, mid followiug the results nmthward and eastward, we ih1d, from Cape FlDrida to Savannah and Port Royal, a gradual increase of the tides, and then a graclual decrease to Cape Hatteras, with a single contradiction, easily explained. Next following the stations on the com;t, nnd omitting those in the bays and sounds, w-0 have a less regular increa;;c to Sandy Hook, and a decrease to W eweeder on Xantucket Island. Next is a less n~g:ular reg:imen, requiring a more det11ilPd examination. By developing the curved line of the coast into a straight line and marking upon it the tide stations, which will thus be at near13- their proper distances from each other, and by erecting ordinates at each of the station points, and setting off on a imitable vertical 1-;cale the heights of the tides at those points, and connecting the extremities of tho several ordinates, we have the broken line shown in Diagram A. In drawing this line the stations of the coast only are joined, and the irrogularitie:; are cut off by the curve. This curve shows distinctly the physi'.cal <livi8ion of the coast between Cape Florida an<l Cape Sable into three great bays. The great Southern from Cape Florida to Cape Hatteras. The great Milldlc from Cape Hatteras to Siasc.onsott; tho great Eastern from Siasconsett to Cape Sable. Perhaps this latter may be considered as only a portion of a great bay from Siasconsett to Cape Rare, bnt this generalization iR rtt present hardly safe, and I confine my8elf, therefore, to the more limite<l view. The tide '"ave 8etting into the southern bay rises as the bay contracts, an<l the heights of the tides along tho shores increase as the places are more distant from tho chord t<panning the entrance. If we suppose tho lines of equal height tl· he l"traig11t lines, an<l draw them upon the diagram tram;forring: them fo a map of the coafit, we shall find that they are more crowded on the more eurved side, and more open ou the lest< curved. The curve indicate::; Cape Hatteras and not i he inlet, which wn,..: the tirlal si ation, as the point of le~u;t height: The physical cam'le of this phenomenon is wcll tm<lerstood if it has not yet been reduced to mcaimre. The next curve shows us plainly the Middle b~ly, having Hatteras for its southwestern cape, and Smith's Point or 'V ewceder for it;; northeastern entrance. The form of the shore is less favorable to regularity, but the result is nevertheless well marked. The interference of tidal waves which takes place off Nantucket tends also in a degree to confuse the results. The chart shows how simple the system of co-tidal lines is in the three bays, running nearly parallel to the shores. The ea;;:.tern bay lies between- the eastern part of Nantucket (Siasconsett) and Cape Sable, Mas8achu::1etts bay being suhsidiary to this. The tide wave entering the eastern bay follows the deep water, and thus the co-tidal lines take generally the direction of the shores, until tho tide wave enters the Bay of Fundy. The most probable form of the co-tidal lines, from XI to XV hours, inclusive, is shown upon the chart, which is merely an extension of the chart of co-tidal lines of the United States coast formerly presented to the Association. The heights focrea.se rapidly from Nantucket to Cape Cod, being 2 feet at Siaaconsett, · d 9.2 feet at Pro·

THE UNITED STATES COAST SL"RVEY.

vincetown. At Cape Ann they are nearly of this same height, and increase in passing up and into the bay to 10.0 feet at Boston, and 10.1 foot at Plymouth. 'l'he height at N e~Ylrurypurt it1 probably local, dependiug upon the position of the tide-gauge. There is hut little change from Portsmouth to Portland, and from Cape Sable to Elle1rn-ood' s island. Shall we look to the greater ba_Y between the Kantucket and Kewfoundlan<l f"lwal" for the cause of the 8-feet rise at Cape Sable, and of the heights from Admirnl Bayfield' s talJle? \Ye nud the hei~hts along the coa::;t of Nova Scotia to vary from '7 to G feet ; not \rith regularity, hmvever. At Cape Breton i:,;land they Yary from G.4 to 4.(; feet. decreatiing tlrn~ in going northward and eastward. Are these hei~hts dnn to the crcrwcling: of the \vateTs into thii' greater bay'? If so, why are not the heights of Cape Breton greater than those of KoYa Scotia'? "\Ye require results on the south shores of Newfoundland, and on the Great Bank. to give ns clear ideas on these points, and I hesitate to extend the generalizations to thi::: ternptiug field. The shoals from Nantucket and broken ground near George's Bmik, and the comparatively s1wal water in their vicinity, on tlie one side, and the Great Bank of :\"ewfouncllaud un the other, look as if full of meaning of this sort. Further re1'ults way, however, show tint this is not the interpretation of the phenomena. The tides of Labrador are hut 2.3 feet, bringing us back to the standard of Hatteras and of :Montauk Point, mid 1Yhat proLa!Jly would be that of Kantucket hut for interference. Soon after passing :Mount Desert on the wost side, and Ellen wood's island on the e;rnt side, the tide wave has turned into the Bay of Fundy, and the ri,.;e increases

with extraordinary rapidity.
Tho complicated character of the co-tidal lines in this immediate vicinity is indicated by the chart, the lines from XII to XV hours being crowded into tho very small space of a:fe>Y miles, on the south side of Nantucket. To return to the more limited scale, within which our inductions are 1mfo, Delmnire bay, New York bay, Long l,.;laml sound, Nan-ag~uiseit and Buzzard's bays, Nantucket and the Vineyard sounds, present, on a smaller scale, the same phenomena of increase in the lieig-ht of the tide in ascending. On the contrary, ill Chesapeake bay, whid1 widens and changes dfrection at a right angle immediately from the entrance, the tides diminish in height, us a general rule, in going up the bay. The results of the heights of tides along the coast are very satisfactorily sho1Yn upon a model which is now before the Association, for superintending· the executiu11 of w11icl1 I arn iudebted to Mr. Pourtale8. The basis is a map of the Atlantic coast, from Cape Florida to Cape Race, upon which the co-tidal lines of the United States are traced. The tidal stations ttre marked upon this, and rods, cut to length, and proportionate to the rise and fall of the tides at the several stations, are inserted in holes drilled at the 8ta.tion points. The sleel rods refer to the heights at exterior stations, au<l the brass rods to interior ones. Paper cut to tho form of the general curve of heights which has already been explained, and placed behind these rods, serves to show the generalizations with great distinctness. I propose to call the bay between Cape Florida and Cape Hatteras the southern bay ; that between Cape ~atteras and Nantucket the middle bay; and that between Nantucket and Cape Sable the eastern bay, of the coast of the United States. The general figure of the coast line has, of course, heretofore attracted the attention of geographers. The connection with the height!! of the tides could only satisfactorily be made out by such a series of tidal obseryations as those embraced in the Coast Survey.

They are now in operation, and so far very successfully. ]from the W CF'tern Coast we have only a few temporary observations in San Francisco hay, which prove interesting from their confirmation of the faet first pointed out by Sub-Assistant A. F. Rodgers, that the tides are higher inside the bay than at the entrance. Numerous observations have been made in the neighborhood of Hell Gate, ~nd in Vineyard eound, by Sub-Assistant H. Mitchell, but they have not yet been turned into the o:dice, and be will report on them himself. By the kinndess of Baron Muller a set of tidal observations was taken at Vera Cruz, )foxic-0,

Mr. Avery also Rpent some time in studying out modes of discussion in connection ·with tho same subject, aml in f ormi11µ; auxiliary table;.;, &c., on which he has reported from time to time. The tidal curve of San Diego for the whole year of 1855 was decomposed into the component diurnal and semi-di nrnal curves by the graphical method b.Y MeRsr8. 8. Walker and C . .M.

Mr. v\'alker also treats in the same way the tidal observations received from Mr. Wurdemann's party along the Florida reef. The call for tide tables for the engraving: division has been considerable during the spring, and har< called for a careful revision of the reductions, examination nf discrepant results, &c., to which I have alway8 given personal attention.

tion of our harbors and seacoastR-here cutting away headlands, there stretching out hooks, destroying at one point and building at another. We are called upon not only to exhibit the daily and houdy couditions of these great elements, uut to ascertain their oflices, tl1eir modes of operation, and their effects. I offer the following as a brief report of the field-work done by the party under my-direction in the localities to which I have above referred :
IIELI, GATE AXD YICIXITY.

Tides.-Permanent tidal stationi' were established at Ravens·wood, Hell Gate ferry, Hallet'11 Point, and Pot Cove. At the first two stations Saxton':-; Relf-registPring: gauges were successfully use<l, while at the last two ordinary box gauges were employed. 1Vith the exception of Hallet's Point, these stations were simultaneously occupied during a period of five weeks. At Hallet' s Point the serieR covered about two weeks. The box gauge" were observed every fifteen minutes, night and day. Many other tidal stations were temporarily occupied at points intermediate and more diRtant, in order that no local change in the wave might escape our irn1pection. These observations exhibit the character of the interference between the two branches of the tide wave which have been propagated, respectivel.'~, 1Jy "~ay of Long Island sound and the Sandy Hook entrance. The permanent stations were connected by lines of levels, so that we are able to refor all the observed hoight.s to a common zero and ascertain the disturbance of sea level at each stage of interference. The tranRition of establishments is so rapid between t.he interfering tidal systems that it. is necei;;sary to construct tables for many places at short distances apart, and the ranges of the tides differ so materially from station to station that they cannot be too carefolly determined in a locality where vesflels are stranded daily. The changes in the mean water level, caused by long continued gales of wind, are among the most striking characteristics of this region, and are susceptible of accurate classification by proper groupings of the observed height.s. Currenfs.-In situations !'ubject tu titlal interference>< "'e fiud a peculiar class of currents, easily distinguished from the ordinary ebb and flood drifts accompanying a single tidal system. It is obvious that this class of currents bears a complicated relation to the observed rise and fall, and that we can only hope to obtain a comprehm1sivc knowledge of thi8 by ~mhjecting both tides and currents to simultaneous oh>CTvation. Your instruction;; pointed out the course to be pursued, and, as you will perceive, we have followed them closelr. vVhile those at the stations on shore noted the heights of the tide, another set of observers noted the velocity and direction pf the current in the channel. The surveying schooner " Madison" was used for occupying stations where long series were required, and her boats were employed in positions where a single day's work would suffice. Great care was taken that each current station should be in the axis of the stream, and that as many points as possible should be occupied at once. At these stations the ordinary log was used, the velocities and directions being recorded each half hour. The exact time of slack water was also noted. At most of the stations occ~pied by the "Madison" the observations were kept up in unbroken series of from seven to nine days each, and it was designed from these records to form correction tables by which to reduce the single day series observed from the boats. In addition to this. method of observing, we made trials of free floats, following them through .the ch&nnels, and by angles and ranges determined their positions at stated periods. The '\te:locities.given by these floats were corrected for mean values by' referring to the Jog observa·

tions made at the same time from the sd1ooner. I would remark here that this means of mcai3uring currents, except for very limited dii'tanccs, is subject to great ohjectio11s. From a simple consideration of the cli::lti11dive clcfi11itions of fluids and solids, it will lie 8een that we cannot correctly rcpre;;cnt the motion of one by that of the other. In irregular and crooked channels the solid bod.'· drifting with the current will not submit. to cha~es of direction so readily as the "Water in which it is irmnerBed. With the -.Jig:htest beud in the course of the stream the float w111 leave the axis. This familiar foet is strikingly illustrated in t]ie plottings of our current trips in Hen Gate, w11ich I shall ;,cmd to :nm 1vhen complete. It has occurred to me that the diflic-uitiet: ariRillg' from this methocl of obt:<erving might be obviated hy substituting a fluid in place of tl10 Rolicl float. There are some Rpecics of oil which float for a great distance hof'ore bec-oming; di;,,.;ipater1. Iu the course of our "~ark the whirls and counLer currents i11 ! he vicinity of IIell Gate were exami11ed. :Many of tl1c more remarkalile of the,;e are confo1ed to fixed limit;;;, and regularly recur with c:1ch ehb or fluod currcur. It was deemed important to determine their positions, in order to point out the couri:'c which a vessel must pursue in order to pa8s beyond their influence,;. The great wl1irl,.; of llallei' :-; Covt~ ;rnd Put CoYe, 'Yi th several otherR, have been plottcll on di1q;rau1s 1\~ith more or le.~s accuracy. The rclatious w11ich these currents and whirl:-: bear to shoal fonnatio11s anLl mull depo:sit:s ltave heen traceu to some extent. The shoal in Haliet' s Cove, tho mucl deposits to the eastward of Hallet' s Point, the ")IiJ<lle Ground" shoal, below tl10 Ga tu, a,; wull as other similnr formations, can be truced to the action of these driftH. But, while noti11g- the aceumulatiurn· wl1ich take place in certain situations, our atten· tioH wa:< drawn to tl1c work of destruction which is going on ehicwberc. Even the rocks are wearing away liy tl1c ru:-;h of water over them. The materials of which these rocks are composed, :rnd ,,,-hich arn not uniformly distributed throughout the mass, do not equally yield to the wear of tho warm", and thus occur those sharp and ragged forms among the reefs and ledges.

Levellhigs.-Bofore referring to the operations in Sect.ion I, I bog leave to report the completion of tho lovcllings which connect the tidal stations on the Hudson river. In order to place our reHults beyon<l all possible doubt, I directed Mr. Vose, to whom the lev.elling was assigned, to proceed 8lowly aml with great care from station to station between New York and Albany. AB you directed, a <louLle 8cries of levellings was made throughout the whole route and every doubtful step was retraced. \Vith regard to the clo,.;eness of the results obtained, Mr. Vose says : ''From a hiu;ty computation which I have made, it appears that th~ probable error for the entire distance from N cw York to Greenbush does not exceed two-tenths of a foot. In some parts of the route-as, for instance, across the long bridge near ·Tivoli-it was necessary to run over the work five times.''

existing in He11 Gate, though on a very much larger .scale. The consideration of the tidal interferences has formed the subject of former field-work and reports, and the operationf' I am about to describe were undertaken with a specia] view to the determination of tlie lawR of the currents, engendered by these interferences ; it has, however, been necessary to repeat some of the tidal observations, in order to trace the connection between wave and current motions. Our ·field of work extended from No Man's Land to a point a few .miles to the northeast of Monomoy. Tides.-Tidal stations were established at No Man's Land, Menemsha Bight, Falmouth, and Monomoy. At these places the observations were kept up from six to eight weeks. In order to preserve a uniformity in the records, the observers ·were all fun1ished with the mean time of Nantucket. The extreme 8tations, Ko Man's Land and Monomoy, \Vern chosen to exhibit the forms of the eastern and western waves before suffering interference; while Falmouth, being a meeting point, was a proper place to observe the compound interference tide. The observations at Menemsha Bight were intended for comparison with those of No Man's Land, in order to explain some peculiar changes in the form of the tide >Yavc, noticed in the results of a former season. O;,rrents.-The current stations were so arranged as to give the characteristic epochs and velocities throughout all the channels, and at. points but short distances apart. The Coast Survey s,phooner "Bowditch, n the chartered sloop "Key West," and a whale-boat suitably constructed for this purpose, occupied stations in concert. The observa6ons were made at frequent intervals during periods of thfrteen to forty-eight hours. In order to correct the observations thus obtained for semi-menstrual and diurnal inequalities, as well as to detect anomalous results, a permanent current station was established at the Nantucket light-boat, situated in the main "South Channel," between the Horse Shoe and Cross Rip shoals. Here the observations were kept up during a large part of a lunation. In addition to these the Bishop and Clerks, Shovel Full, and Pollock Rip light-i>hips were occasionally occupied by observers. The several divisions of the party, shifting their 8tationR o,·er di8tricts previously apportioned to each, soon collected the data for a chart of co-current lines. The information thus gained pointed so siguificautly to a possible explanation of the causes and offices of the beaches and shoals which have rendered this neighborhood notorious, that we received directions from you to extend our work to these inquiries. The shoals of these sounds are mostly composed of loose, quartzose sand, and the approach to them, in many cases, is so abrupt that vessels run upon them before the leadsman has detected the shoaling of the water. The very fact that such precipitous banks of loose material can exist in the midst of violent tidal drifts, is itself suggestive of the conclusion that upon the arrangement of these same tidal forces must depend their construction and preservation. Our course, at the outset, was to snrround certain shoals by a cordon of current stations at points more or less remote, and the oliservations were in the highest degree satisfactory. We soon discovered that our results fell rraturally into certain classes and represented certain type forms of deposit ; they resolved apparent confusion into harmoniou<1 relations. Not only the shoals hut the beaches and hook;; are found to be the result of causes quite within the reach of the investigation you have instituted i even Cape Cod itself may fall within one of the determined classes. The whole number of current stations occupied amounts to above fifty, and some of these were repeated at different times. Upon the data collected I shall draw up a preliminary report and send the papers to you for discuasion. In closing I would remark that, from my limited experience in field studies

of this kind, I am convinced that the i::onstant operations of these tidal agencies are (commcr~ cially speaking) in the highest degree beneficial irr their ultimate purposes, and that where improvements of harbors or channels are contemplated, the design should be to aid, not thwart, these efforts of nature.

APPENDIX No. 36.
On the winds of the we.<Jtern coast of the United States, from observations in connection with the United States Coast Survey, by .A. D. Bache, Superintendent.
[Communicated by authority of the Treasury Department to tbe American As80ciation for the Advancement of Science.]

The observations of which I propose at present to communicate the results were made in the year 1855, in connection with the tidal observations on the Pacific coast, at three permanent stations-Astoria, San Francisco, and San Diego. · The approximate latitude and longitude of each of the stations is as follows : Astoria, Oregon, latitude 46° 111 N., longitude .123° 49' W. San Francisco, California, latitude 37° 48' N., longitude 122° 28' W. San Diego, California, latitude 320 40' N., longitude 117° 12' W. The mode of observing was that described in my paper on the winds at Cat Island, read be· fore the Association in 1850. The obserrnrs were posted and practiced together by Lieutenant W. P. Trowbridge, of the Pnited, States corps of engineers, under whose supervision the observations were made. The directions of the wind were noted in points, and the force in the conventional scale before referred to. These numbers were reduced to velocity in miles per hour by the tables given in my former paper, and the quantity of wind blowing from any quarter during a given period was thence readily found. The tables and diagrams are thus of the same kind as those which I have before presented to the Association. They were made under the direction of Assistant L. F. Pourtales, of the United States Coast Survey, to whose care, assiduity, and knowledge, I am indebted for the opportunity of presenting them. The computations and the diagrams were made by M. Thomas. The observations were taken three times each day, at 6 a. m. and p. m., and at noon, except on Monday of each week, when hourly observations took the place of the regular daily ones. From these latter results the reference of the three daily observations to the mean of the day has been made. The quantities of wind for each hour and for each direction were computed and grouped by months, and then plotted. The eye readily takes in the characteristics of the winds at different periods of the day and year, and for the various directions. To apply these to the reduction of the daily observations, tables were formed of the average time during which each wind blowing would give from observations at the three hours already named the result for the day. For example, the west wind at San Francisco gave for the quantity in twentyfour hours by the daily observations 505, the mean hourly quantity a.t 6 a. m. being 6, at 12 m.

27, _and at 6 p. m. 31. These quantities respectively being supposed continued for 9 hours, 5 hours, and 10 hours, which agrees with the diagrf_.tm, would give 499, a number differing but little from the total found for the day. In this way the following table was formed, which was applied to the reductions of the daily observations.

From this table the diagrams representing the quantities for each month from each directipn (Plate 66, Nos. 1 to 12) are taken, and also those showing the total annual quantities of wind from each directio~, and the total quantity of wind from all directions for each month.-(Plate 66, Nos. 16 and 17.) It seems to me altogeth.er probable, from the study of the figures of these tables, th!tt the scale adopted by the observer at San Francisco is greater than that at the two other points. The total quantities at Astoria, San Francisco, and San Diego, are as 59, 87, and 60, and it is hardly probable that there is so large an excess of quantity at San Francisco. I have also the same remark to make as on the observations at Cat Island, on the absence of observations upun the intermediate points between the cardinal ones, showing the tendency to designate the winds only by the cardinal points. From these diagrams we see a.t once the simple general regimen of the winds On this coast.

TBE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

357

1.. The great prevalence of westerly winds, representing a flow of the air at the surface
from the ocean in upon the land. 2. The general absence of easterly winds, showing the absence of a return current at the surface. The proportion of westerly to easterly winds is as 8 to 1. 3. The increase of westeTly winds in the summer and their decrease in the winter. 4. That when easterly winds blow at all, it is, as a rule, during the winter. 5. The N., NE. and E. winds blow more frequently in the morning than in the afternoon hours. 6. The SE., S. and SW. winds are, in general, pretty equally distri1uted over the morning and evening hours. . 7. The NW. is the prevailing direction of the ordinary seabreeze at Astoria and San Diego, and the W. at San Francisco. Sometimes the W. wind has that character at the first narq.ed stations, and sometimes the SW. wind at the last named. A closer inspection of the same diagrams will lead to other interesting results. Considering the quantities of wind at the three places for the whole year, (Diagram 3, No. 13,) San Diego and Astoria present remarkable similarities. There is more NE. 1 E. and S. wind at Astoria, and more NW. wind at San Diego. The axis dividing the area symmetrically is in the same direction. On the contrary, at San Francisco the W. and SW. winds give the character to the rose, and the axis makes an ang.le of some sixty-seven degrees with that of the other spaces. .All show the same deficiency of easterly winds, and San Francisco is deficient also in southerly ones. The monthly curves grouped in two periods, from November to March, both included, and from April to October, (Plate 66, Nos. 14 and 15,) show that the annual curve has the summer type impressed upon it. The summer is, in fact, the windy part of the year. The NW. wind prevails in August at Astoria and San Diego, and the W. and SW. at San Francisco. The scale of Diagram No. 14, iR leRR than that of 15 in the proportion of IO to 14. There · is scarcely any wind from points between north, round by east and south. The form of the rose is exceedingly simple and the generalization very obvious. The winter system is less simple. The axes of the spaces for Astoria and San Diego make angles of more than 110° with each other. The NE., E., S. and SW. winds a'"e considerable at Astoria, and the N"\V. wind is deficient. At San Francisco the W. winds give the prominent feature to the rose curve. As the winter is not the windy season, so the months of March and September are not the windy months. On the contrary, July is one of the windiest months of the year. San Francisco . ...;_At San Francisco the great current of air flowing fro111. the sea to the land comes generally from the W. or SW., rarely from the NW. In the period from November to Ma~ch, inclusive, (Diagram No. 14,) the W. is the prevailing wind, exooeding in quantity both the others, the SW. wind exceeding in quantity the NW. Iu the period from April to October, (Diagram No. 15,) the W. and SW. winds are nearly equal, and each exceeds the NW. ~ The W. wind has, in general, the features attributed to the sea breeze, beginning after the rising of the sun, increasing until after the hottest part of the day, and dying out or much diminishing at night-fall. The W. aud SW, winds give the prominent features to the wind rose at San Francisco.

358

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The SW. is the prevailing wind in June and July, SW. and W. winds blowing nearly .the whole of those months, not succeeded by an easterly land breeze, but rising and falling. The rose curves fur lfay and August resemble each other, the NW. and SW. winds being nearly equal in quantity, and each less than the W. wind. So the curves for April and September, when the NW. wind has nearly died out. The W. wind diminishes in quantity through March and February, and through October, November and December, to January. The N\V. d increases again from April towards December, and is very small in October and November The SW. Vlrind disappears in October, changing the form of the rose curve, but reappearing in November and December, and increasing towards January. The W. wind has a maximum in .April and May, and another in September aiid October, the minimum being July and January. The N. wind in December, ..Tanuary, and February, reaching a maximum in January, is the only other point to be noticed for San Francisco, partaking with the other places in the general absence of easterly winds. TJ:v:i tables show a little in the winter. There is also but little S. wind there. Astoria and San Diego.-In general the winds at these two places resemble each other more than those at San Francisco do either. The rose curves for April, May, June, July, and .A.ugust, (Nos. 4 to 8,) have the same general character. 'l'he mean curve for the year, (No. 13,) and for the summer period, (No. 15,) have also the same general character. The NW. wind is the summer wind, and has the characteristics of the sea breeze, but there is no return land breeze. The NW. wind reaches a maximum in July and a minimum in December. It is the great prevailing wind of the year (Diagram No. 13) at San Diego. As it decreases it is generally replaced by W. and SW. winds of less quantity. In December the quantities of the three winds are nearly equal. The resemblance of these winds at San Diego and Astoria is remarkable, the remarks just made applying generally to both places. There is, however, much less NW. wind at Astoria than at San Diego. Except in June, July, and .A.ugust, there is some S. wind each month at Astoria, and especially from September through October, November, December, and February, it presents a marked feature of the rose. At San Diego this is less marked, the two agreeing most nearly in quantity in March, April, and May. 'l'he SE. wind is a distinct foature in both places in February and March, and at San DiegG in .April and June. The E. wind is prominent at .Astoria in January, February, and March, and the NE. from October to January, inclusive. AAtoria has the most easterly wind, the NE. beginning in October and blowing until February, and being replaced by the E. wind in March .

APPENDIX No. 37.
Report to the Commissioners on the preservation <f New York harbor from encroachment, by the advisory council on tlie compm·ative map qf New York bay an<i harbor and the approacli.es; prepared by the Coast Survey 1farch, 1857, ·incltlding e.r,lracf.<; from the report <f A. Bo.~hke, esq., United States Coast Survey, to Prqfessor A. D. Bache, Superintendent, February, 1.857.
The advisory council has received from tlie Superintendent of the Coast Survey a. map, prepared, under his direction, by A. Boschke, esq., comparing the shore lines and hydrography of

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

359

New York bay and harbor, and the approaches, as shown in the surveys of 1835-' 36 and of 1855-' 56 by officers of the Coast Survey. This comparative map has been prepared with great care and ability by Mr. Boschlrn, and shows in a conspicuous manner the changei; which have taken place within the last twenty years in the harbor and its dependencies. It is presented with this report to the commissioners. The hydrography of Lieutenant Commanding (now Commander) T. R. Gedney, United States navy, is represented in blue upon the chart ; and that from the recent surveys of Lieu"l:enant Commanding T. A. Craven, United States navy, in reel. The recent bydrography of the Hudson river is by Lieutenant Cumrnauding Richard Waimvright, United States navy. The spaces over which encroachments have been made do not represent their danger a!'I well as does the study of the effects in particular localities. It is, however, satisfactory, and, for some purposes, answers to know their general amount. Mr. Boschke calculated that, between 1.:he Hudson and East rivers alone, 1, 220 acres of land have been made, upon which, formerly, the tide rose more than four and a half feet, removing thus a tidal space of nearly nine millions of cubic yards from this part of the harbor. To this encroachment is to be added the space occupied by piers and slips, amounting to 519 acres, since the tidal currents arc so checked between the piers as to lose nearly their whole scouring action. The piers alone displace about 312, 000 cubic yards. It is, of course, to be considered that these encroachments are made upon a port of \reat capacity, and that they represent but a small fraction of the total area of even this portion of the harbor. If made according to a systematic plan which would have considered all the circumstances of the problem, they would by no means have produced injurious consequence~, but the contrary. The importance of these changes to the welfare of New York, as a great em poriurn of commerce, needs no enforcement from us. They should be watched carefully, be faithfully chronicled, and be attentively studied. It is not sufficient to know the changes and their extent. Tho causes which have produced them must be ascertained. In this way alone can they bo regulated and controlled. Thus only can injurious changes be prevented, and favorable ones be assisted. It by no means follows that, because a partial change in a particular direction is favorable, that if this be continued indefinitely it will still be advantageous. For example : a diminution in the water-span of a harbor, by increasing the velocity of the current, may deepen the harbor, ant!. thus a first encroachment may appear to be advantageous. Continue this, and the velocity of the current becomes excessive; navigation is impeded by it; the bed of the harbor is torn up in one place · to be deposited in another; the capacity of the harbor is contracted injuriously. Again: the contraction of the entrance to the harbor may act, at first, favorably by increasing the rate of flow of water over the bar and thus increasing its channels; but this contraction, if continued, may so altRr the direction of the currents as to destroy the first favorable effect, and may even be carried. so far as to obliterate, by its encroachments, some ·or the principal channels. It will be seen, in the course of our remarks, that an increase in the velocity of currents and changes in their d,i.rection have, in many cases, produced favorable results, and that even the advance of Sandy Hook into the main ship channel may, up to this time, have been advantageous, while, if encroachmentR i:n the same direction were continued beyond certain limits, the destruction of the harbor might ensue. It will be further seen that the physical survey of the harbor and approaches, which we have h~ret.ofore recommended in strong terms to the commissioners, is absolutely essential to furnish

360

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

materials for the study of the diverse and complicated phenomena which the harbor presents. We have the basis of this in the present topographical and hydrographic surveys of the Coast Survey ; but we need very elaborate observations on the tides and currents, and on the movement of the sand and other materials constituting the bottom of the harbor, before we can satisfactorily trace the causes of all the effects which the comparative map brings to light. We have an example of what is desired in the satisfactory results obtained from the observations on the growth of Sandy Hook, and a case in which the minuteness of the facts e-bables us to draw very safe conclusions. We cannot too strongly or too often urge upon the commissioners the necessity for knowing whence the materials of the bar are derived, and how they are brought to their present places; why they are deposited as ·we find them, and why they change their places according to laws, '.'-hi ch are obvious on a casual inspection of the comparative map, and are confirmed· by a close s-tudy of its details. In following out the important changes which have taken place in the harbor, we have been greatly assisted by the able report of Mr. Boschke, before referred to, and refer to it as our test for most of the numerical results, for many of the facts, and for some of the deductions which we present. Extracts from it, giving able and valuable statistics of the changes, will be found hereto appended. We begir. with the chang~s at the entrance of New York bay, and, first, with those of the land on the south side, n_iunely, at Sandy Hook i second, with those on the north side, at Coney island and the shore of Long Island to the eastward as far as Rockaway beach ; and next proceed to the changes of the bar itself, outer and inner, and the channels and shoals into which it is divided. Upon the depths of the channels of this bar depends th,e commercial prosperity of New York.
1. Changes at Sandy Hook.

The light-house, which is now more than a mile from the point of Sandy Hook, was built near to that point. Maps of nearly a century ago show it as about one-third of mile from the end of the Hook. The point both advances and recedes, but, upon the whole, grows to the northward, jutting out more and more into the main ship channel. Its rate of growth, on the average, for the last century, has been about one-sixteenth of a mile in twelve years. In the main ship channel, where, at the time of Captain Gedney' s survey, there was 120 feet of water, there is now but 21 feet. Large areas, over which twenty years ago there was from 20 to 40 feet of water, are now dry ground. Within twenty years the point has grown to the northward 220 yards, narrowing the main ship channel, and changing in a degree the directions of both ebb and flood currents at this part of the entrance. Various causes were assigned for this growth ; and minute observations of the tides and cur· rents were made by the Coast Survey, under the immediate direction of the Superintendent, by Sub-Assistant Henry Mitchell, under authority of the commissioners, tq, test the different suppositions, and to collect such a body of facts as would lead undoubtedly to the full solution of the problem. The observations have shown that on both sides of Sandy Hook, the outer or ocean side, and the inner side of Sandy Hook bay, there prevails during the ebb and flood tides northwardly currents, varying in strength at different times and at different distances from the shore, but

a

361

tending to carry the sand on both the outer and i1mer shores to the northward. On the outside, in False Hook channcJ, this current prevails for seven hours out of the tweke, bcingstrongest in mid-channel, aud the weakest on the shore of the-Hook and on the Fal>'e Hook shoal. On the inside the northwardly current prentils fur eleven hours out of the twdve. At the meeting of the,;e currents their motion is lost, and the sand which they transported is dep~sited. The comparative chart by the form of the curves of 6 and 12 feet depth off the point of the Hook shows this in a very perspicuous manner. · It is easy to see from the principles of the motion of fluids how these currents exist ·while the tidal currents are flowing in and out of the ent.ra.nce to the bay. Ou the ebb the oufoide Cfurrent is an eddy current, h:wing nearly the opposite directi0n to the general tidal current issuing from the bay. Inside both ebb and flood draw the ·water frnm s,mdy Hook ha~' l1y tbe western shore of the Hook, which is thus >Yorn a·vay. r ' The norHnvanlly current outside has not only carried the matcriab of the New Je1·sey coast northward, but it has dimini:,;hed very much the area of the shm1ls known as the False Hook and Outer Middle Ground ; has deepened the bar at the southern end of False Hook clwnncl from 21 to 22 feet; has, according to Mr. Boschkc, deepened the channel by about one foot and a half; and has removed the bulkhead, which, in 1836, closed tl1e northern end of Pabc Hook channel, giving 30 feet water where there was twenty years ago but 1 :i feet. gigl1teen foet can now be safely carried through this channel at mean low water. The projecting shoal,; formed just north of what was in 1836 an inlet, about a mile north of the old Shrewsbury inlet, have also considerably diminished. S1Jrewsbury inlet, which, in 1835, was about 1, 100 yards north of the Ocean House, and through 'lvhich six feet could be carried at low water, and the 'IYider but shoaler entrance just referred to above, are now entirely obliterated. Seeing in these northwardly currents the power which transports the sand to the point of the Hook, W(l have the obvious remedy afforded by jet.tees, at suitable intervals and of proper lengths and directions, for stopping the progress of the material. These constructions have of late years been so much studied by engineers that most of the circumstances attending them have been ascertained, and it will be eas~-, whenever the growth of Sandy Hook ought to be arrested, to do so by simple cand comparatively iuexpensive means. By referring to the comparative map these changes will be distinctly seen, and ahm the northward movement of the False Hook shoal. :Mr. Boschke estimates that ir1 twenty years a million and a half cubic yards of sand have been removed from this channel;*that about a million cubic yards of sand have been transported from the Outer Middle and False Hook shoals, of which half a million have been re· deposited at the northern end, increasing it, as is shown upon the comparative map. Thus two millions of cubic yards of sand have been transported towards the point Sandy Hook, the main ship channel, and the southern part of the bar from this locality alone; bounded on one side by Sandy Hook shore, and on the other by the outside of the Outer Middle and False Hoqk shoals. Does not this show the absolute, necessity of the most minute observations of currents, extending not only over these localities but further out from the land? Do not these facts argue that continued watchful~ss is necessary in regard to' these changes, and that no labor and no reasonable expense should be spared to keep them constantly under observation? The average depth of the main. ship channel has changed but little. The ,V-estern part has shoaled, hut a d_eep hole has been excavated due north from the east beacon. On the wbole, Mr. Boschke

of

· See report hereto appended.

362

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

reports that but ninety-five thousand cubic yards of sand have been deposited in this channel. The growth of the hook has added about two millions and a half cubic yards to this encroachment, representiug, ·with the quantity just stated, more than the excavation from False Hook channel. The wear from the inside of the hook is estimated at about one hundred thousand cubic yards within i.he last twenty years. The wearing of the blutfa must not be confounded with the ·wearing- of the shore, for the sand which is tlrns removed is deposited on ~be shore and on spits, causing an actual increase of the Hook. From these facts it is probable' that the sand from False Hook channel does not at once reach the bar. The importance of knowing. positively where t,he bar derives its supply of sand is obvious; since in that knowledge is involved the.questi~n whether this supply can be so cut off or diminished as to cause a deep· ening on the bar by natural mean;;;; and whether, if dredging were applied and the Bource of supply of the-sand cut ofl; the improvement of the bar "\Yould be possible. This question of the d~epening of the bar has in the progress of commen:e, in the change of burden of ocean steamers and sailing vessels, derived new importance, and it is altogether probable that future progress will render it a vital question.
2. Northern side qj entrance, Coney Island and south slwre of Long Island.

The western part of Coney Island has made to the westward since 18G5. The eighteen, hvelve, and 1:1ix feet curves of depth arc now more than eighty yards further to the westward than they were twenty years ago. Rockaway inlet, which drains Jamaica bay, has passed, according to Mr. Boschke, 620 yards to the westward since 1836; and Duck Bar Island, which then was mai11ly on the eastern ;;ide of ihe eutrance, is now on the ~western side. The shore of Barren Island to the west of Rockaway inlet has lost, according to Mr. Boschke' s calculations, nearly a square mile of area, and the destruction would have been greater had not the woods upon the beach checked it. Hog inlet has shifted nearly a mile in the same time. We thus see a great westwardly movement of the sand along the Routh Hhore of I ..ong Island perfectly established. It remains for such an examination as was made at Sandy Hook to explain the causes of these changes and their probable future progress, and thus to put us in possession of the means of controling them. Near the western end of Coney Island there is "a tendency to form a channel close to the land, which is the correlative of False Hook channel at Sandy Hook. This channel has not altered much in its general features since 1836, having moved, however, somewhat to the northward. Great chauges have taken place in the bar of Rockaway inlet, its depth having decreased from fourteen to twelve feet, and the direction of the entrance over it having changed to tlie southward and eastward, which is unfavorable. The point of the western si:x. feet shoal has advanced southward and eastward uearly three quarters of a mile ; and that of the eastern side h~s receded nearly as much. The general curves of six, twelve, and eighteen feet along this shore to the 1'-cst of Rockaway inlet seem to show that its influence does not extend more than ,.two miles and three-quarters, there being little or no change in filwse curves at that distance ; but this point is too importaut to rely upon in<lirect observations to establish it. It would seem that the accumulat:ion of sand at Rockaway inlet, and the projection of its shoals and bar further inj.o the sea,. may have stopped a portion t>f the supply of sand fro.m tbe c~ast of Long Island to the New York bar. We want at every step direct observations of the tides

and cnrrents along this shore to enlighten us as to the cause::< of the changes which are determined. If the supply of rnnd to any part of the great bar is derived from this shore: of Loug Lsland, how desirable mmit it not be to know it positively, and to be in posse;;sion of all the particulars of the moverneut?
3. ll'ew Yorlc bar.

In the old maps the bar \Yas represented by a large bank called East Bank, the main ship channel skirting its 'Ycstern edge, m1cl then turning along the southern side to the ocean. In fact, across New York entrance hr~low Sand:- Ilook a11d Coney bland lies an extensi,·e hank* "intersected lJy five charmcl-s, giving tlnrn altcrnatdy a shoa1, n channel, a sl~rrnl, a Ghannel, anu so on." The main sl1ip channel is next north of Sandy Hook, it"' direction is due ea,,;t, and its width 1, 050 yards, the passage,:; from it through the outer bar are by Gedney' s chmmel with 23~ feet, mid by the south channel with 23 feet, at mcau low water. North of this and separating· it from the Swash channel is Flynn'" Knoll, (tho southwestern part of which is known m; the SW... spit,) covering an area, y.;ithin the eighteen feet curve of depth, of 852 acreR. Northeast of Flynn'" Knoll lies the Swash channel, the general direction of "1d1ich is SE. by S., gently curving from itR upper entrance 80 as to pass more castwardly; its average width is 900 yards, and throngh it 21 feet can be carried at mean 101Y water. Though the main ship clmirnel has the be::<t water, the Sn-ash, from it" E'nperior directness, is ~he favorite channel into New York. North west of the Swash channel is the Romer ,;ho al, the area of which is 2, 080 acres. Northeast of the Romer shoal is the eastern channel, 7 50 yards in width, running SE. for half its length, then E. and p1H<sing· over the outer bar with 19 feet water, a remarkable slue running nearly dm~ ;;outh, connecting this with Gednc;'' s channel. Next, to tlw northeast, is the MidJ1e Ground slwal, covenng 1, 5-18 acres. Next, the Fourteeufeet channel, running to the SE., and closed by a wide bar with H~ feet upon it. Then the extensive Ern'!t Bank, covcxing 3, OG3 acres. Finally, the slue clo8e to the Long Island shore, having a bulkhead at its western end, near the point of Coney faland, and a bar at its eastern end. This entire bank through which the channels are cut is of sand, similar to that of the beaches of New Jersey and Long Island, the river depot-1its taking place higher up in the bay. The directions of these channels and shoals show, in a general way, the directions of the forces of tl1e water acting at this entrance. The tidal currents of ebb, reinforced by the affluents of New York and Raritan bays, displace the sand which the flood deposits, and the channels thus measure, in a general way, the forces of these affluents. A thorough inYestigation of the forces requires nothing less than the complete physical survey which we have recommended. Time would be wasted for purposes of navigation upon such a survey, but when it comes to those of improvement noth.ing less than a physical survey will answer. A few thousand dollars thus expended, by determining the minute actions of the tide" and_ cnr1·ents and their causes, may save hmJdreds of thousands in expensiYe tentative works of improvement. .il'hese observations could hardly fail to show where natural action::\ were to be aided or restrai_ned, and when art might profitably come to their aid or must be used to control, modi(v, or change them. While we consider that we are not yet justified in speculating upon the causes which have

From the elaborate computations of Mr. Boscbke (hereto appended) it appears that in twenty years Fl;nm' s Knoll has been carried 240 feot to NW. by W. ; Romer shoals 920 fe'et to the XE. ; the MiJdle Ground 270 feet to the NE. ; and East Bank 2, 840 feet to the NE. \Vhat portion of the movement is due to the extension of Sand:· Hook, and what portion to othc1· emv.cs, acting in the 101\·er and upper bay, ·ffe do not undertake to say, not haviug sufficient data for this purpose.

'l'he enornwus quantities of sand tl1at haYe there Leen shifted in position, antl small portions of whieh have been again deposited in>'ido of the outer bar, while the main bodies have Leen canicd away into deep water, are shown iu the iutcre,;ting tables of }.fr. Boscl1ke, which we extract from his report, hereto appemlofl. 'l'Iw,;e alh:rations, l1y tho removal of sand, prove that changes have occurred in the force and direction of the tidal currents, in regard to the nature and extent of ·which only a complete phy::'ical ;o;urvey can inform us, and that for the future. That twenty year>' have sufficed to produce 1rnch chang:es is a fact surely sufficient to make us alive to the necessity of procnring at once the materials by comparison with which, five, te11, fift eon, ur twenty years hence, our successors may draw their conclusions. From the channels tho enormous amount of three millions of cubic yards is known to have been actual13· removed, or shifted in position, and in the shifting of tho shoals fifty-four millions of cubic yarclil have been carried onward. While this has been going on, the main ship channel }1 a,- liad a deposit of sand in it of nearl;v one hundred thousand cubic yards, and the :Middle Ground a deposit upo1i it of nearly ·a million of cubic yards. The shoals within the eighteen feet curves have diminished in extent nearly fifteen per cent., or from nearly nine thousand to between tieven and eig:ht thousand acres. For those positions we refer to tho tables of Mr. Boschke. An inspection of the comparutivc map will show changes on the West Bank in harmony with tho11e which we have noticed at length. Gravesend bay has also changed very materially, the depo;;it in it being- much increased. It would lead us into too much detail to discuss thus elaborately the changes in other parts of the lower bay; the following, to ld1ich our attention has been directed by Mr. Boschke, will suffice, as bearing specially upon the navigation of the bay : 1. The outer b:a has become more uniform in its depth, as is shown by the section across it 011 the comparative IIHtfh Gedney's channel has slightly improved. The north and south channels have coalesced, forming a better entrance than when they were separate.· A few isolated s1){)ts or lumps, of seventeen and a half and eighteen feet, occur, which possibly have for their nucleus portions of wrecks, or of the obstruct.ions which were placed at the eutrance l~y the British during the revolutionary war to prevent the entrance of the fleet of our allies, the French. \-Ve adopt the sug·gcstion of Mr. Boschke that these should be removed by bl~st ing or dredging, and that, in fact, a steam dredge should be kept at work on the bar durrng

The present condition of the shore, aR Mr. Boschke jm;tly remarks, between the Quarantine and Fort Tompkins, is unfavorable from its many irregular projections.

A general glance over the 1mrface of the comparative map from north to south shows, hy the portions left uncolored, the great body of the Hudson riYcr ilowiug onward through the upper and lower bays, and passing by the underwater delta of the bar into the Atlantic. The color~d shoals on each side show that the expansion of the water, by checking its rate of motion, causes deposits of the silt,-which it car~ies with 'it, forming extensive flats like thoRc between Jersey City and Kill van Kull on the western side, or the Middle Ground and the flats of Gowa.nus bay on the eastern.

The Eilst river is, in fact, a m~re arm of the sea, and which, as the tidal currents divide on tl1is sid,~ of Thrng' s J'\nck, thP t·bh runniug to the east through Long Island sound and to tltc \Vest tbrougl1 Hell Gate, may be regarded as a tidal t;t.ream heading at that point of divi8ion. Its influenee is readil~· seen, as its eub passes out on either side of Governor's island, sweeping through Buttermilk channel, forming Yellow Hook and Owl's Head channels, and causing the deposit of a triangular shoal at the south side of Governor's island an_d of the Middle (}roullcl, as it comes in conflict ·with the main current from the northward. Buttermilk channel, to \d1ich attention waR firnt direcfrd by the survey of Iji ..mt. D. D. Porter, U.S. N., one of the assistantR of the Coa,,t Survey, is of inneasin&; importance, and nothing which can liy po:-':.:ibility lead to its obstruction slwuld be permitted. The ;;hoal to"·ards its southeastern entnmce, by the Atlantic dock, seems to have at its point a rocky nucleus. The current of flood pa;-;ses directly along the cdp;c towards tho entrance of the dock. It has undergone but little clrnnge since the date of the first survey. The i:;hoal off the southern side of Governor's i;;land, on the contrar:-, has worn awn.'· consideraLly. }\fr. Bo:-;chke estimates that the inner ba~· cuutains 14, G:2D acres, or nearly 23 8cprnre miles. Of this, the Narrows to New Brighton occupy one-fourth; the Jersey fiats and the main ship channel, from New Brighton to the Battery, ncarl:· one-third each ; and tho :Middle Ground and Gowanmi bay nearly one-eighth. The .Jer:<e:· flats colltain 4,427 acres, the ::I.fiddle Ground uud Gowanus buy, 2,020 acres, and the ;;:hoal south of Governor',; island, 83 ac:res. The Jersey flats have inneaseu in exteut and diminished in depth within the last twenty years. The well defined edge has g-rown out particularly near to Jerney City, pointing to the encroachments there as the enuso of this change, and showing so clearly the connection of this line or border of the flats with the cncrorichmcnts as to indicate for the future what must occur if they arc extended. The material of these flats is of soft mud, supplied by the river from the upland and from the sewerage of the cities. There are rocky or stony patches scatte1·ed over tho area, but these are exceptions. The mud extends to a considerable depth befrH'e firm bottom is reached. Between Ellis' island a11d the canal basin, in Jersey Cit;1"i the eighteen foot curve has advanced in twenty years some 230 yards. The computations of Mr. Boschke (hereto appended) show that an average daily deposit of 1, 550 cubic yards takes vlace on these flatR. Go·warrns bay has in like manner shoaled from the same causes, increasing the area over which there is six feet and less of water by 177 acres. These spaces arc, in fact, the expansions of the river bed, into which tho waters, passing 'vith diminished velocity, find places of deposit for the solitl matter which the more rapid current above has carried off. While these comparatively quiet spots have inon>ased, the Middle Ground and the shoal south of Governor's island have worn away. This is, in part, no doubt, duo to the general increase of velocity in the currents by loc;al encroacl1rnents, but, as the map shuws, is also produced by the changes in the shore line below Castle Point, (Iloboken and Jersey City,) which have thrown the current more over on the eastern side of the bay. This same increase of velocity in the tidal current has deepened the main ship channel generally, and especially at the mouth of Kill van Kull. The slllall changes of velocity necessary to effect these and other similar changes could only be established by the most elaborate and refined observations on the tidal current£!'. Such results as are ample for purposes of navigation would fail to detect such small changes. Tbe variations in the rate of the currents at different parts of the lunar month follow those of the

tides from which they are derived, and must be connected with them by observation, or else marked out independently by such a long continued series of oh:<crvations as would deter the most indefatigable observer. Thi;; entire matter would form part of the complete ph:niical survey of the harbor. to which we have so often called your attention. The Coast Survey oLservations haYe shown, experimentally, the variation of the tidal currents with the well known tidal inequalitie8, called the half-monthly and the daily ineqnalities. This whole field slwulcl be explorecl in a way to put upon permanent record the mo:-<t miu uie information for future 14uidance in reference to encroachments and to improvements. An examination of the tidai register:>, in the archiYcs of the Coast Sun'0y, docs not show any change in the tidal estabhshment at Sandy Hook or at Governor's it>land of sufiicient, amount to be adopted as a certain conclu:-iiot1. Had the ob,.,ervatim1s of twenty years ago been continued over periods as long as those more recently made, ·we might lrn ve been aLle to decide this que:-<tion definitely. Iu fact, in impurtaut harbor;:; like Xen- York ticlal ob,.en·ation,.; should be constantly kept up, tbe time of high and low water, as well as tho height, being carefully ascertained. The Coast Survey 13elf-registering gauges gn-e these elements, and, besides, the law of the rise and fall of tho. tirl(~. 5. llO'eu:ark bay. This tidal re;rnrvoir, containing; an area, according to ~Ir. Bo>lchko, of about 6,000 acres, fa supplied and drained through Kill van Kull into X ew York ha.'·· and through Arthur's Kill and Staten Island 8ouud into Raritan bay. It receives at its head the water:< of thn Uack(mRack and Passaic rivers. The bay is au extensive fiat, with two channeli', of which tlic principal one leads into Kill van Kull. The average depth of the bay is about six feet at mean low .water, and the bottom generally of soft mu<l. Tho shortue>:<t', depth, and breadth of Kill van Kull render it the principal outlet and inlet for Newark bay, notwithstanding the sharp turn which the water is obliged to make as it passc" from the bay into the Kill. Artlrnr' s Kill is longer, narrower, shoaler, and more crooked than Kill van Kull, and the bottom is quite irregular, the profile of the channel presenting shoals and pools alternately. The mi1111te tidal and current observations in the Kills lia.ve shown that the tide:> meet some\Yhere between Fallen Beacon and Elizabethport, and that the tidal currents meet over an area south and we;:;t of Shooter's i~land. The drainage channel from one Kill to the other across the mud flat, which is most clearly shown on the map, has really not lesR than seven feet in it at mean low water, but is so narrow that no vessel of any size can keep iu it an<l carry this depth. Newark bay has not altered generally in depth since the firat survey. Kill van Kull has deepeued, and Arthur's Kill has undergone changes of different kinds in different looolities. In our former report we strongly urged uniform shore lines for these pa:>sages. V1'beu they have been adopted, there will be a tendency to greater uniformity of depth in Arthur's Kill, aud dredging will be very effective. This would even now be quite useful, and ·would produce 'favorabl\; changes in the flow of the tides. and in the amount of rit:e and fall at the upper end of Arthur's Kill. Dredging is the Lest resource for ma.king a deeper passage between the two Kills, and would necessarily be resorted to at intervals. It is an easy operation in such a locality and with such a bottom as here.

Hudson river.

W o riuote from ~Ir. Boschke' s report : ''The avera;;e width of the lower section of the riYer is 1, 300 yards. It,;; average depth i::; from 30 to 50 feet, the channel being 011

the New York side, and tho Now Jersey shore being bordered by a fiat of an average width of 400 yards, upon 1Yhich there is at moi;t eighteen feet of water. '·The construction of the Hudson River railroad has clmmd up the various ll ttle bay:,;, and has given a more uniform shore line to the river, 1Yhich has camied a general deepening and more uuiformiiy uf clepth. The consideralile encroachments between Thirtieth street and Hammond street have narrowed tho river, and deepened it, on tho_ average, Rix to ten feet in that localit;,·, throwing, beside3, the current oYer to the Ne'\v Jome_\· shore. Below aud aliove tho projecting piers, ancl within the slip;; from abont Thirtiteth street south, the ground sl10als eonsicleralily, aud, from the nature of things, clredging must necessaril.Y lie resorted to to give an increased depth. The extension of the piers on the New York side, nnd particularly near the Battery, has increased the eddy in front of the Battery, and therefore caused the extension of the f'hoal there.'' These change,':', which the map fu1ly showR, enforce all that we have heretofore said in regard to ihe clauger of encroachments in this part of New York city froIJt. We cannot too ofteu repeat, that whatever changes the direction and velocity of the current, must change tho regimen of the harbor for good or for evil.

7. East river to Th1·og' s Neck.
The value of Buttormilk channel has been already referred to. Its oastorn entrances are divided by a middle ground, one channel running close to Governor' 8 island, the other to tho Brooklyn wharves. These channels should be most jcal01rnly guarded from obstruction. The middle ground has, according to the statement of ~Mr. Bm;chkc, dra~wn from tho map, increased in area within the 18 feet curve by five and a half acres since 1836, and a 8pot of 11~ feet at mean low water has formed since the first survey. .A considerable deposit has occurred on the north shore of Governor's island. While tho eaetern branch of Buttermilk channel has somewhat deepened, there has been an accumulation on and sonth of the shoal in front of the Atlantic dock. \Ye agree with Mr. Boschke in the judgment, that wliile the encroachments on the Bast river, between Oorlaer' s Hook ancl Fulton ferry, have increased the rapil'l.ity of the current so as to tear up the bottom in many places, they have also thrown the current of ebb more on the New York side, so that the Brooklyn side doponds chiefly upon the tlood current for keeping up the depth between the .Atlantic dock and Fulton ferry. There is a general deepening of the river from the navy yard to the western side of Kip's bay, caused by the contraction of the stream until the point is reached, where the influence of Lowber' s bulkhead, between Seventeenth and Fourteenth streets, is felt. The shonJ betwoen Fourth and Eighth streets has increased, and the channel bas less water than before the construction of the bulkl1ead. '!'his is caused by the deflection of the water from Kip's bay more directly to the opposite, or Williamsburg shore, by I.owber' s bulkhead-an inference which the deepening in the new direction of the current towards the opposite shore fully sustains. The rocky character of the shore and bottom between the points just noticed and Hell .Gate precludes much natural change. In the cove between lOOth and 116th streets Mr. Boschke notices a Blight deposit.

From Astoria to Throg' s N eek great changes have been produced. Iu the general there has been a deepening of the deeper water, but sometimes a mere transfer of shoal spots and deep ones to other localitie~, and sometimes a decrease of <lE>pth. Ilfr. Boschke computes that the area of this part of the river is 6, 200 acres, and that 15, 000, 000 of cubic yards have been removed from its channels and shoals, giving an average deepening of between one and two feet. The influence of the tide of Long Island Rouml disappean; almost ellLirely ai Pot CoYe, between which and Throg' s N eek the tide wave is compounded of that of Long Island sound and of the East river. The area over which the currents meet lim; near to Throg' s K eek and west of it. Direct observations are wanting to establish definitely what changes have taken place in the rise and fall nf the tides and in the current:- over this space: 1ut we can hardly suppose that, with the great changei;; in the Hal't river, some alteration haf' not occurred in the general phenomena of the tides a11d tidal currents. The change" shmYn by the map, like those in tl1e upper and lolover bays of New York, correspond on the average to an increast~<l velocity of current, which is thus, as before, fully cstabli:;hed by the indirect observations, and is in accordance with what the encroachments of the kind and degree already made upon the waterspace \Vould necessarily produce. Some of the c.:lianges in this part of the river require et'pecial notice; such, for example, as the decrease of the shoal on the eastern side of Riker'" island, where the six-feet shoal has, according to 1fr. Boschke, lost 130 acres in area; the decrease of the eightceu-feet sl10nl of Flushing bay by 35 acres ; the deepening of the passage" between Port Morril3 and X orth Brother island, and between North and South Brother if\lan<lF-. The shoals having six feet and less than six feet upon them. in the bays aml coves, haYe generally increased in extent since 1836. The main channel through this part of the river, from Throg' s Point to Hell Gate, has nowhere less than thirty-seven foot of water at mean low ·water, affording the greatest encouragement to the removal of the dangers of Hell Gate from this eastern entrance to New York harbor. The general changes in Ne~v York harbor, within the last twenty year;:, are thus shown to have been beneficial, while in special cases encroachments are found, eoncl 1 1siYely, to have acted most injuriously upon particular localities, turning the channel mvay from the New York city side of the river, where natural causes had made it flow, increa~ing the velocity F-O as to wear the river-bed into hollows and contribute materials to slwals, and even, in some cases, to be injurious to navigation. While thus t.he general result is a favorable one, so many of the particular local results have been bad as to make it plain that a very different eystem s;hould have been pursued in furnishing the facilities required by commerce on the water and on the land. The same good result, and a much better one, could have been obtained without such instances of evil had the shore-line been regulated years ago according to a systematic plan. The advisory council has not been opposed to such additions to the land as were required fur present or future accommodation by wharves and docks ; on the contrary, they have everywhere endeavored t.o provide such, where encroachments had not already been carried to the verge of imprudence, or beyond it, or had not been guided by erroneous principles, tending to produce injury to many while seeking individual benefit. We have endeavored to trace such lines as would produce regular shores without abrupt 47 ED

changes of direction and width, 'to alter the proper directions of currents, or to increase or check their regular movement. The large traced map furnished to the commissioners, when spread upon a level surface, Bhows admirably the general harmony of the harbor lines which we have propoBcd. That we have not been unmindful of the wants of future commerce is proved by the fact that we have provided 1, 840 acres of area for dock accommodation, according to the calculations of Mr. Boschke, made in reference to this matter. That we. have not feared to recommend proper facilities for the riparian owners, within just limits, is proved by tho fact that our lines contemplate the filling in of 2, 480 acres of land now under water, amounting to some thirty-four millions of cubic yards. But this is done according to a systematic plan, which will avoid the dangers "'Ive have observed or have been able to foresee, and which will, as far as they have effect, favor those changes for the better which are now going on and avoid injurious ones. In conclusion, we repeat that this is tho time for a complete physical survey of the harbor, to be based upon the Coast Survey work and supplementary to it. We have already seen the value of a partial work of thiR kind and run no risk in guaranteeing similar important results for an entire work of the same description. Respectfully submitted by

Bxtra.ctsfrorn the report

Supm·intendent, February, 1857.

New York harbor, like all other tidal harborn, must principally depend on the ebb and flood to keep its approaches and channels in navigable condition. For this reason it is necessary to preserve jealously, the water area of the harbor, so as to permit the greatest possible quantity of tide-water to· enter it and by its efilux to scour the channel and bar. But the great value of the land in New York city and on both shores of the Hudson and East rivers, as well as the dock accommodation desirable, have induced owners, in the course of time, to fill up the land under water to a very considerable extent. If we recur to the original condition of the harbor, we find, on comparison, that the shore has been artificially extended into the Hudson and East rivers so as to make, in filling up, 1, 220 acres additional land where formerly the tide rose four and a half feet, thus taking away a tidal reservoir of 8, 860, 000 cubic yards. To this should be added the water area now occupied by the piers and slips, amounting to 519 acres, because in the body of water between the slips the current is completely checked by the lrnlls of vessels. The piers also obstruct the free flow of the water ; eddies are formed between and behind them, and so the tide is retarded. The struc· tures of the piers displace now the considemble space of 312, 000 cubic yards, once occupied by water. These encroachments will appear, however, comparatively small when we consider that the

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURV'EY.

S71

area of the harbor within the limits stated embraces 98, 37 0 acres, and consequently represents a tidal reservoir of 714, 166, 000 cubic yards, and that the bod.'- of water at mean low tide of the whole mass in the harbor represents the enormous sum of 3, 17 0, 122, 000 cubic :rnrds. These quantities compared ·with the amountr-; representing the encroachments are, of course, small, but it should be recollected that it is not the diminished water space alone, but principally alterations so lirought about in the direction ancl velocit3· of the currents which havo occasioned the changes. The impo1·tance of arresting the increase of Sandy Hook becomes a vital question, fo1· in the main ship channel, where twenty years ago a depth of 120 feet existed, we have Jlow on1y twenty-one feet water, and close by, eighteen and twelve feet, and the entire channel has been thus affected in that immediate vicinity. Exc1nding the increase of the Hook, my calculation shows that a deposit of 93,800 cuLic yards has been made in the main ship channel from Southwest Spit to Gedney' s channel. At False Hook, and Outer Middle can be plainly traced the same effect as at Sandy Hook, a 'flWtionfrorn south to north, and we may justly attribute it to the same causes. M:y calculations show that the southern part of the flat called the Outer ::\.Iiddle has diminished h:- 1, 030, 000 cubic yards, but an increased deposit appears at ihe northern end to flie amount of 500, 000 cubic yards. This evident tendenc;· of a current mo,-ing from south to portl1 has had also considerable effect on the channel between False Hook shoal and the Hook. I find that a bulkhead or bar at the northern extremity has been removed and replaced by deeper ·water; and the removal from the channel of 1, 560, 000 cubic yards of Rolid mattm has deepened it by an average of 1-45 feet. The flats lying between Sandy Hook and Conoy Island are intersected by five channels, giving thus alternately a channel, a shoa1, a channel, &c. Starting at Sandy Hook, and sounding northwardly, they lie in tho following order. 1. Main ship channel, direction due east, width 1, 050 yards .. 2. Flynn's Knoll and Southwest Spit, with an area of 852 acres. 3. Swash cha1.rnel, direction SE. by S., width 900 yards. 4. Dry Romer shoal, an area of 2, 080 acres. 5. East channel, SE. for half its length, then S., width 750 yards. 6. Middle Ground shoal, an area of 1, 548 acres. 7. Fourteen feet channel SE., terminating suddenly in a ·wide bar. 8. East Bank shoal, 3, 063 acres. 9. The Slue, a small channel parallel and close to the shore of Long Island. Tho forces of currents, or other agencies not yet fully developed, have, in the space of twenty years, occasioned the following changes at the entrance to New York bay, by the transposition of solid matter.

The shoal which is called the bar- proper, or the most easterly bar crossed by Gedncy's channel and the north and south channels, has attained a more uniform depth, and I find that about 3,380,000 cubic yards have been removed from it. Few isolated spots of 18 and 17~ feet at mean low water yet exist where they were 20 years ago. The proportional area of the parts forming the upper bay of New York are as follows : The Narrows to New Brighton 3, 662 acres, with a water capacity at mean low tide of 223, 860, 000 cubic yards. Jersey flats 4, 427 acres, with 63, 7 56, 000 cubic yards at mean low water. Main ship channel from N cw Brighton to the Battery, 4, 500 acres, with a body of water equivalent to 238,026,000 cubic yards. Middle Grounr.l and Gowanus bay 2,020 acres, with 32,485,000 cubic yards of water. Slwal south ef Governor's island 83 acres, with 1,340,00() cubic yards of water at mean low tide.

The changes which have taken place in this locality have been two-fold.

channel has generally deepened, and particularly at the mouth of the Kill van Kull, in some places from one to two fathoms. The Middle Ground and the shoal south of Governor's island have been washed aw~y b~~ the current of the Hudson river, deflected to this side sinee the extension of the 8hnre on the Jersey side, below Castle Point. The area of the Middle Ground has l;een thus diminished 90 acres, and the shoal south of Governor's islaud 27 acres. The solid matter removed from the Middle Ground is L 410, 000 cubic yards, and from Governor's island shoal 156, 000 cubic yards. The same cause has probably effected the filling up of 7, 230, 000 cubic yards in GO\rnnus bay within the last 20 years, and thu>' inere;ised the area of 6 feet and less than 6 feet water by 177 acres. A similar extension deposit has been made on the Jersey flats, which amounts, as shown h:--- the comparison, to IL 291, 850 cubic }·ar~s, giving an average daily deposit of 1, 550 cubic yards.

Report qf Mi-. A. Boscl1ke on the drau;ing qf maps ef New York harbor, made for the Commissfoners on Harbor Encroackments.
Co.AST StrRVEY OFFICE, September 18, 1857. Sm: At the expiration of the term of the N e·w York harbor commission, on the 15th day of January, 1857, the survey of the shores of the island of Manhattan. and of King's, Queen's, and Richmond counties, on Long Island, surrounding the harbor of Ne"~ York, had been completed. The maps on i,yhic:h the preliminary bft1khead and pier lines were laid down, as recommended by the commissioners, were also drawn in outline, but were then incomplete in details. These maps form a series of forty-two sheets, each measuring thirty by fifty-two inches in size, and the whole are bound in two volumes or atlases. The comparative map of the entire lrn1·bor, on the scale ,,-0~01>· ordered in your instructions, has been completed. It represents, in blue, the survey of 1835, by Lieut. T. R. Gedney, U. S. N., then an assistant in the Coast Survey, in comparison with the survey of 1855-' 56, by Lieut. T. A. Craven, 'G. S. :N"., assistant, which, for distinction, is shaded in red. The changes which the harbor of Kew York l1ad undergone during twenty years are thus graphically shown, and in the report which I had the honor to submit to you on the subject they were stated in detail. In addition, there has been compiled from the surveys a series of maps on a scale of two hundred feet to the inch, on which it is intended to have plotted the grants of land under water at different periods, made by the colonial government, corporation, land office, commissioners, or by the State of New York. The collection of these grants was entrusted by the Commissioners on Harbor Encroachments to Assistant Edmund Blunt, with your concurrence. Those coming into my hands have been, for the present, deposited in the archives of the Coast Survey office, to await the receipt of others yet to come in. A general map, which will embody the survey of the sho1·es, the topographical survey of the lands adjacent to the shores, and the minute hydrography of Kew York harbor, from Y onken; southward to Shrewsbury river, N. J., and from South Amboy to Throg's Neck, was also commenced, in obedience to your instructions, on a scale of 20 r The size of this map is ten 100· feet by nine. At the beginning of the present year a considerable portion of the topography on the,map was reduced in pencil; but the progress made, as compared with the whole work, hll.li been limited, only two draughtsmen being available for duty in connection with it.

874

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

On the 15th of January the Commissioners on Harbor Encroachments reported to the legislature at Albany, and laid before the Committee on Commerce and Navigation the several maps in the condition just described. A further term of three months was then granted, to enable them to complete their labors and for finishing the drawings. During that period the maps contained in the two atlases were completed. I also marked plainly on them, in black ink, the bulkhead and pier lines, as recommended by the commissioners, and continued the work on the general map with one topographical and a hydrographic <lraught.sman. By the 15th of April considerable progress had been made, and in this advanced condition it '.Vas presented by the commissioners, with the other maps, to the legislature. After the passage of the law adopting the lines as recommended by the commissioners, thirty days were allmYed to make out descriptions of the lines, referring them, by offsets :nd bearings, to permanent objectF; and to the sides of streets in New York city. In accordance ·with your instructions, this voluminous and elaborate document was completed under the direction of the commissioners, and has been filed, together with the two atlases, in the office of the secretary of State, at Albany, as required by the law of the 17th of April, 1857. A joint resolution of the legislature having been passed requesting the Superintendent of the Coast Survey to complete the general map of New York harbor, it was returned, by your direction, to the office in Washington, and is now in my hands for completion. Since the 20th of June two topographical draugl1tsmen have been employed on it under my direction. The progress of the work will bear a large proportion to the means assigned for its execution. The bulk of the details will probably be done before the next meeting of the legislature, and the style of execution will speak well for the ski'!l. of the draughtsmen engaged. At the close of this final reJ)Ort, allow me to thank you for the confi®nce and liberality which you have shown towards me since the work was placed in my hands. I trust that my exertions and good >vill to execute it to your own and to the satisfaction of the commissioners and the credit of this office may have been successful. I have the honor to remain, most respectfully, yours, .A.. BOSCHKE. Prof: A. D. BACHE,

APPENDIX No. 39.
Rcp01·t made by Lieutenant .A. W. Evans,
S . .A., .Assistant Coast Survey, on a topographic<il reconnaissance of a part of Sapelo island, Georg£a, for the sdection of a site for a primary base line.
[J.

ELKTO:N, MD., Septembe1· 8, 1857. Srn: Your instruction respecting the reconnaissance of Sapelo island, Georgia, with a view

to the selection of a site for a primary base line, embraced several heads, and particularly specified three distinct and separate portions of the island, each of which it was conjectured might afford a good line. T11e selection could he best made from the inspection of a topographical sketch of the localities. Mr. H. S. Du Val was despatched to Sapelo on the 25th of May, with a copy of your

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

375

directions for his guidance, and instructed to make a plane table map, on a scale of Totoo> of the southern and western portions of the island. This duty was completed on the 24th of June, when, in company with him, I personally inspected such parts of the work as I had not previously visited, and compared them with the map. It is due to the topographer to state that he appears to have labored very faithfully and accurately under all the disadvantages of inconvenient transportation, very sultry weather, and without trigonometrical points. His sketch gives a close representation of the ground, and, as you will observe, confirms the general accuracy of the old French map. Facilities were afforded, in the progress of the reconnaissance, by :Mr. Spalding, one of tho proprietors, whose kindness in forwarding the work, though in accordance with his well known hospitality, I feel cannot be too highly commended. Sapelo island is generally much more level than the one adjoining, (Black Beard,) and geologically older. The latter i;; a serieR of parallel sand ridges, the valleys being frequently filled by brackish ponds, and every spot bearing distinct traces of the recent action of the sea. Sapelo appears to be a congeries of hammock islands, originally separated, but now connected by marshes, which have assumed the clrnructer of hard savannahs, being now for the most part dry. These hammocks abound in live oak and palmetto, afford the best arable land, and are generally the highest ground. When they become, by successive vegetable ueposits, a little higher than the neighboring marsh, the first gro·wth is of scrubby pine. It is thus that iho savannahs or prairies seem to posses;;; no distinct line of separation from the adjacent pine land, but gradually to run into it, while oak is found growing upon higher and drier spot8, having a well marked edge or shore. Through the savannahs at the s011th end of the island, the ground examined by J. S. Williams, esq., (fonnerly assistant in the Coast Survey,) two lines seem practicable. I have indicated them on the map, and shall refer to them separately. The other lines drawn show the lines respectively suggested by Mr. Spalding and myself. To commence at the north end, the line drawn from my north base past Chocolate plantation, and running to Little Sapelo river, is ahout three miles and eleven 1rnndred metre:,; iu length, passing over hard and level ground, with but two ditches, a natural hollow and rivulet emptying into Mud river, at the old fort, and a piece of marsh near the southern end. X early a mile of the north end passes through a grove of ymrng oak; thence it is clear, excepting a high hedge at phocolate plantation, and a few valuable trees, which it would he difficult tc avoid. Both ends of this line look directly upon the main, without involving the necessity of cutting. The north end is also very favorably situated with respect to Sapelo sound. This site is number two in your notes of instruction. Site No. 1 commences in an open field at the southwest end of the island, ·with a clear Yiew of the main, and offers no serious obstacles until it reaches Mr. Kenan' s plantation, two mile~ and a quarter distant. It can be made four and a half miles long by a mile of heavy cutting through oak and pine, ending in an open savannah. .A. ditch occurs on the line at .Mr. Spalding's plantation, and another at Mr. Kenan's. The ground is hard and nearly level throughout, being original hammock land. The north end affords a vimv in one direction elem· to the main. The connections of the two sites described, 'vi th the main land, are good, and nrny possibly outweigh the objections to the:rrrwhich have occurred to my mind . . The other sites lie almost entirely in open prairie, but the ground is by no means so soft. or wot as the ordinary marsh. In dry weather it is quite hard. The site indicated by Mr.

376

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Williams, which was, in the course of the present season, e»amined personally by yourself, commences in the first open space at the south end of the island, just west of the oaks at. Mr. Spalding's residence, and passes over arable ground and prairie to the point where the great savannah ends in the pine woods. The woods are here very thin, and by cutting a very few trees the line can be made five miles long. Two small oak groves, which must also be cut through, are not great obstflcles. Several ditches must be crossed, but none on the island are more than three metres in width, and they can be easily bridged. The ground is girnerally dry and level throughout. This site I shall call No. B. Site No. 4 might commence near the point of beginning of the site first described, in the open field at the southwest point of the island, and run up the great savannah, intersecting No. 3 near its northern end. It can be made five miles long. The first obstacle on this site is a grove of oak and pine, with underbrush, about five Lundred metres through, and a ditch. Thence it would pass among some negro house,;, cross the road and a small corner of wood, and run up the great savannah without other obstacle, excepting from ditches. The ground is good and level throughout, though not quite so dry aR site No. 3. Either of the lines, No. 3 or No. 4, I would recommend us posRessing advantages for a base. With regard to their connections with the main, the fact of their northern extremities both lying in the same large pine forest will, of course, sugg·est the necessity of considerable cutting. Here I would recommend the erection of a tripod, forty-five feet high, to overlook much of the pine, (which is of the character called "loblolly,") and such tall trees as might intervene could be cut. Time did not suffice to finish in detail the map of the northeastern part of Sapelo island, and it can only be stated, generally, that it is a large pine forest, in which lie, however, several open prairie.s. In that part looking towards ;Black Beard island is the site of an old plantation ·with some open fields ; but the larger portion, from the head of ·the open savannah to the north end of the isfond, is a pine forest with but little undergrowth, the trees seldom attaining any groat size. The line to St. Catharine's island would, in a very short distance, strike the marsh which separates Sapelo from Black Beard island, and then pass clear of everything. At the south end of site No. 4 there need be nothing more than an ordinary signal on the ground. If by any means site No. 3 could be prolonged to "the neighborhood of the light-house across the marsh and creek, its south end would see clear in every direction, but this would be a difficult operation. Ending it on the hard, high hammock ground, an obstacle in the direction of the main is presented by a thick oak grove, requiring either heavy cutting or a high tripod and scaffold. In view of tlie great necessity, in this low, flat country, of elevating the theodolite, I would recommend the latter resource for each end of both sites, (No. 3 and No. 4.) Spars of any size may be obtained cheaply either at Doboy or Darien. For the tripod and scaffold at the north end, perhaps it would be better to cut the stuff upon the Rpot. From this point lines to signals upon the main must cross the whole breadth of the island, here two miles wide, and wooded nearly all the way. To the extreme northern point of the island is a distance of four miles, mainly through pine woods. It is not to be supposed that an elevation of even forty-five feet would overlook everything upon such lines. The oak wood in this country is all either of present or prospective value ; such pine, however, as f's found upon Sapelo island is comparatively worthless, and is used chiefly for fencing and fire-wood. I do not think that upon any of the sites proposed the grading and bridging need be

TIIE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

cmrnidered a8 matters involving any difficulty or delay. The ground on the prairief' is bermtifully level, and the opening of lines to the main JHesents the 011ly difficulties th:it nee<l be taken into serious cons1deration. I would also suggest that the secondary triangulation be :first comy11eted from Sapelo entrance to Doboy, before making the selection of primary points upon the main. Without the previous choice of them, it is, of coun;r:, impossible to state precisel3- the amount of cutting rcquii3itc to come off the base. The south end of Creighton island is a high :-;hell uauk covered by tall cedars, and might he a good primary point. Directly west of Sa polo island lie Little Sapelo and several large vrnoded hammocks, separated from the larger island by Little Sapelo river. 'fhe best season for meat<nring a baRe is the winter, both on account of climate, and as interfering least with cultivation along the line. November and December, I think, arc drier months than either January or February, when most of the v;et weather occurs. I believe the cotton crop is generally secured before November. Very truly, your obedient servant, A. W. EYANS, Lieut. [J. S. A., Assistant Coast -Survey. Prof. A. D. BA.CHE, Superintendent [J. S. Coast Survey.

Extracts from a report by Assistant A. ftL Harrison relative to tlte topographical features of C1m1· berland and Amelia island8, St. JJ-Iary' s river, Georgia, and Amelia rfrer, Florida.
'UNITED STATES SCHOONER PEIRCE,

Plynwuth, Mass., June 23, 1857. Sm: * * * * * * * * * * My first sheet of the season, in the order of execution in the field, includes a part of Cumberland sound and Amelia river ; the entrance to them from the ocean ; the mouths of the St. Mary's, Jolly, and Bell's rivers, and Lanceford creek, together with portions of Cumberland and .Amelia islands. The topography of the country embraced by this sheet is varied. Cumberland island, Georgia, is generally level, the southern extremity being formed of marsh, divided irregularly by Beach creek and its many branches. The outer or ocean shore consists of low sand hills and a sandy beach, constantly washed by the breakers of the Atlantic. The rest of the island included upon this sheet is composed of the cultivated lands surrounding Dungeness, the residence of the proprietor, Mr. Nightingale, and thick woods of Spanish bayonet, oak, and so~e pine. A road extends nearly in a straight line northwardly through this forest, upon or near which, and its continuation still further north, is located the proposed site for the base. This island forms the northern shore of the entrance to Cumberland sound and Fernandina harbor. The boundary line separating Georgia and Florida runs between this and Amelia island, (w·hich forms the southern shore,) and extends through part of Cumberland sound, and thence follows ~ Westwardly the channel of the St. Mary's river.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

changed to its present title by General Oglethorpe at the solicitation of an Indian chief who had been the recipient of some kindly favors from the Duke of Cum.berland. Amelia island, Florida, presents a various topographical character. The trend of its outer shore forms, somewhat singularly, as far as surveyed, an ol1tusc angle with that of Cumberland. A wmk: named Fort Clinch is in progress of erection upon the northern extremity of Amelia for the defence of the entrance. The northern and eastern sides of Amelia i;;land are bordered by rows of sand hills,' thrown confusedly together, and backed by a thick forest of pine, palmetto, oak, and undergrowth. Immediately behind this is a narrow strip of marsh, running inland some miles, south and west of whieh the country rises into rolling hills, in some places cleared for cultivation, and in others covered with woods. Upon one of the most prominent of these hills Amelia light is situated. \ ery little cultivation is now carried on upon these cleared spots. On the western or river side of Amelia island, upon the shore of Amelia river, are locaJ,p,d the towns of Old aud New Fernandina-the former a dilapidated relic of Spanish rule in Florida ; the last named is a flourishing place, and has been selected as the Atlantic terminus of the Florida railroad. The land is rapidly clearing in the neighborhood, houses are going up, and it bids fair to become a thriving town. The rest of the topography of sheet No. 1, including the mouths of the streams before mentioned, con,;is+s of marsh, cut up hy many ba.youR and creeks, with occa.'lionally a hammock or "island" of fast land rising slightly from the level of the surrounding swamp, and covered with a growth of pine and palmetto. In heavy gales this marsh is frequently submerged. On the Georgia shore of the St. :Mary's, a short distance ~bove its mouth, Point Peter (a wooded point of fast la11d 1 cleared at its extremity) comeR down nearly to the water. An earthwork once stood here, and vrns the scene of a conflict during the last war with Great Britain. Sheet 1.fo. 2 embraces the survey of the St. Mary's river from its termination on sheet No. 1 to a distance of three miles above the town ; the upper parts of Jolly and Bell's rivers, and Lanceford creek; portions of North river and Burrell's creek, from their mouths inland; the town of St. Mary's and vicinity; Martin's i.~land, and a large area of wooded country south of Bell' A river. The town of St. Mary's is situated about seven and a half miles frorn the entrance, immediately upon the shore of the St. Mary's river, on a point of fast land. Back of the town is a level, sandy, pine-covered country, divided by numerous roads .and paths. The St. Mary's river is a narrow, crooked stream; and just below the town it receives the waters of North river, which is bordered by pine land and marsh. Upon it are three sa.w mills ; one only, however, being now in operation. Above the town Burrell' s creek runs through a patch of marsh, and empties into the St. Mary river. Between the St. Mary's and Bell's river, extending southwardJy and southeasterly, is a large area of marsh land, intersected by Jolly river and innumerable creeks and runs, turning in every conceivable direction, in some places presenting a confused network of muddy streams and sloughs. This is particularly the case eastward of Martin's island, a large wooded ham· mock, once under cultivation, but now abandoned. The intricacy is so great in this region, and the foothold so bad, that the topography could not be executed with the ordinary minutenE¥Js, and recourse to sketching was rendered unavoidable. Oysters and fish of excellent quality abound in these streams. South of Bell's river the land is high, sandy, and moetly pine-clad. A few settlements ttre found here, but the quality of the itoil for cultivation is poor.

CAMP Ko. 32, SEAR FERNANDINA, FLORIDA, .Afa.y 21, 1857. Sm: I have the honor to make the following report of operations upon the air line tri:mgulation between Fernandina, on the Atlantic, mid Cedar Keys, on the Gulf coast of t1ie peninsula of Ji'lorida, for the season which has jm;t closed. On the 22d N ovemLer I em Larked from Kew York, via Savannah, to Fernandina, the starting point of my labors. I reached Felfnandina X ove111 ller 26, but finding I could not purchase there or in the vicinity the necessary mules for a reconnoitering expedition across to Cedar Keys, which I judged necessary in order to an enlightened development of plan of work, I embarked on the 28th November for Charleston. Here I obtained an outfit, consisting of three fine mules and two riding horses, with wagon and harness, and returned by steamer to Fernandina, reaching there the next day. By the 5th December my ptnty, consisting of ].\fr. Thomas Baltzell, jr., and )Ir. Gustavus B. Maynadier, aids, and five men, were organized for the field· and on that day we started on a reconnaissance of the country between 1''ernandina and Cedar Keys. We were engaged in this work hveuty-one days, the party returning to Fernandina December 26; and the distance travelled without a guide ·was, in all, going and returning, 429 miles. Of this distance, the wagon travelled, as shown by the odometer, on tho outward trip 176 miles ; on the ·inward, 17 5 miles ; and the balance of 78 miles was traversed by parties detached for the purpose. Immediately on my return a map of the reconnaissance was traced and presented to you at Washington, together with my report. As that report gives an account of my operations up ~o the b~gi~g of the year, I here introduce a large portion and forward in duplicate a map illustrative o :it. The route taken to Cedar Keys was along the line of the railroad, at present graded only from. Fernandina. for a distance of about 45 miles, and with its track laid for a distance of 14

miles. This road is at this date, May 21, finished, and the locomotive ii:; running over it for a diRtance of thirty-odd milei:;, and it is embanked about halfway to Cedar Keys, or for a distance of, <"ay, 15 ~ilcs. Of counie, as the object was to see as much of the adjacent country as possible, we crossed the railroad lino several times, and thus by a tortuous course made our Toute some 26 mile;:, greater than the probable distance by the railroad. This railroad line, it will be perceived from the accompanying sketch, No. 39, makes a considerable deto1:1r to the north in order to head Nassau river and its tributarieE<. ' 'l'he route taken on our return to Fernandina from Cedar Keys was generally in the vicinity of the air line connecting: those points, and, like the former, was made long by many windings. The country along the railroad site, as also that along the air lin~, we found essentially the same in character throughout, except that in the vicinity of N ewnansville the latter presents a more rollirtg, hilly country tban the first named route. Its general and, I may say, its invariable cl1aracterititic is a siliciuus allmcium superposed, in some localities, upon argillaceous clay, in others upon beds of marl ; in some places, as in the vicinity of Hogtown creek, upon sand rock, and in others, to the south of Newnansville, upon a calcareous rock, which, on account of its solubility in many spots, gives rise to what are calle<l sink holes, caverns, or water holes, into which several streams, such, for instance, as Hogtown creek, are known to lose themselves, not to appear again. Others, as the Santee Fe river, disappear for a distance, and then discover themse h·es. The limestone I found in some instances so soft and pliable as to appear as if already calcined ; in others, so hard that only by the severe8t percussion could it be broken. 'I'his geological Iffoduct, I have no doubt, will be founJ of value in the settlement of the country as a cement and fertilizer. These rocks form, as it were, the backbone of the peninsula in a north and >;outh direction, and its breadth has been formed by the alluvium which has been washed against it from the Atlantic anu Gulf waters. The singular symmetry of the formation in cross section, and its gradual emergence to an elevation above the sea of one hundred and eighty feet, will lie well seen by reference to a profile made by Captain M. J_,. Smith and Lieut. I·'. S. Bryan, U. S. Topogrn phi ml Eugineers, in 1853-' 54, for a ship ·canal on the line traversed by us, which profile will be found introduced in the accompanying map. Tlrn sylva ·we passed through is what is familiarly known as the yellow pitch pine. It prevails almost entirely >vithout intermission from one coast to the other; the only exceptions lwing the forest trees which bmder the streams we crossed, the cypress to be found in the S\ntmps, generally of small extent, and the cabbage palmetto, which is seen mostly on approaching the Gulf in clustered groups, and sometimes as single trees sparsely intermixing with the pine. Thus disposed <on the level surface the landscapes presented suggest an analogy to Oriental scenery. The pine is generally below the medium size of large timber, and is so scattered as not to interrupt the view for a quarter of a mile; in other localities it is small and rather thickly scattered. A system of wclJ-conditioncd triangles is practicable throughout, and I consider it as the best possible mode of accomplishing the problem proposed. At either extremity of the line upon the coast no difficulty will be found in connecting the triangulation which has been already executed with that proposed; and neither route presents any obstacle to the opening, by cutting, of visual avenues, which will enable #:observer to see any signals necessary in the measurement of angles. .. The comparatively level country which lies toward~ either coast can assuredly, with the

aid of suitably high signals, offer no obstacles, and the swelling eminences on the Back Bone ridge, if properly seized as Rb1tion points, will much facilitate the 'vork. On either line hiangle Rides of five or more miles can, 1 helieve, be readily obtained, and approximately with the condition best suited to insure tl1e greatest attainable accuracy, that is, for the construction of equilateral triangles . .A.nd now the question arises, upon which line, the railroad or air line, would it be most expedient to construct the triangles? The probable length of the railroad from Fernandina to the keys will not be far from 150 miles. Measurements could not well be made on the railroad track on account of the contin11ed passing and repassing of the cars, and the width of the embankments will not admit of placing the stations outside; but in the cai:m of the air line, a;; it is to be straight behveen the extreme points, sites for bases and 11igh points for stations can be selected at pleasure. The number of tho triangles may be made the least possible. Bases may be measured as often as may be required. .And, what may be of some moment commercially, an air line avenue will thus be opened between the ports of Fernandina and Cedar Keys, now looming into merited importance by the approaching· completion of the Florida rnilroad connecting them. For these reasons I am decidedly of the opinion that the air liue basis of triangulation will best suit all the conditions of the problem to be solved, and ,;}10uld be th0 one ordered. This reportr, sir, you were pleased to approve, and verbal in><tructions were given to go on "''ith the constmction of the triangles to the extent of about forty miles of cutting and the erection of the proper signals and stations. Upon receiving these imstructiorn; I immediately returned to the theatre of my labon;, and now report the following as the result. The triangles Wflre constructed to the extent required by the middle of March, and, agree· ably to your directions of March 14, the cutting was continued still further; so that, on terminating for the Reason, four triangles were constructed, commencing at Fernandina and based on a line tending towards Cedar Keys, (see Sketch No. 3fl.) The sides of these triangles will be in no case less than 6l miles, and their aggregate length is about 59 miles. The greatest deviation of any one angle from the equilateral form will scarcely exceed 3°. Signals similar to that presented in the accompanying sketch were erected at each vertex, and obser· vat.ions within the degree of accuracy required for final measm·cment were made from every station. Thus far the work has required the erection of but hvo stands to observe from-one 7 feet high, at O'Neill station; the other 25 feet high, at Drum creek, all the other observations having been made from the ground. The signals erected have in every instance been about 50 feet higl1, and essentially consist of a tripod 25 feet nigh and a mast about 40 feet long, 25 feet of it surmounting the tripod, and the top made conspicuous by a barrel covered with white cloth, and a tin cone, ha:ring three cleets nailed on the side at the to1) so as to form in plan au equilateral triangle. On this the tripod of the instrument stood, and a scaffolding was made for the observer to stand on by nailing pieces around the legs of the signal tripod and laying on them a flooring of puncheons. I cannot close this report without acknowledging, as I here do, the courtesy I have received at the ha-nds of Messrs. Finegan & Co., of the Florida railroad, and of :Mr. Danie] Callahau, contractor, in the prosecution of my duties. These gentlemen have frequently aided my party,

APPENDIX No. 42.
Report to tl1e Commissioner 0( tl1e General Land O(jice, slwicing ilte progress made in the s1trvcy and marking ef the Florida Key8, in quarter sections, during the present season.
COAST SURVEY OFFICE, July 20, 1857. Sm: I have the honor to report, in continuation of the work on the Florida Keys undertaken for the General Land Office, that the triangulation of the outer keys, from Point Charles, on Key L:ngo, to Pigeon K<\)", on the southward and ·we;;tward, has been executed within the present surveying season. The distance between the points named is about fifty-four miles. The triangulation on the outside of the keys is now complete from Key West upwards along the entire line of the reef. Three topographical parties have been engaged in extending the plane table survey, the operations of which commenced about hventy-five miles northward and eastward from Key West. In that vicinity Burnt Key, Knock-' cm-Down Key, Budd Key, Raccoon Key, Water Keys, Eastern and vVestern Content Keys, and Harbor Key,_were surveyed b~- the party of Mr. F. W. Dorr, extractH from whose report are herewith appended, marked, (A.) accompanied by a tracing from his survey. · The topographical sheet containing the keys just enumerated is joined on the southeast by three others executed by Sub-.A.ssistant 0. T. larde11a; copies of these are herewith transmitted with his remarks (B) upon the general character of the soil and the growth of timber on the keys. Tl1ese exhibit the surface features of Ramrod Keys, Big Torch Key, Little Torch Key, Big Pine Key, No Name Key, New Found Harbor, Little Pine Key, Pye's Harbor Key, Annette Key, Big Spanish Key, Little Spanish Key, Crawl.Key, Howe's Key, Mayo's Key, Johnson's Keys, Flat Key, West Bahia Honda, and East Bahia Honda. Maps of the keys lying immediately to the eastward of that last mentioned, and extending as far as Key V acas, have been already fornished to the General Land Office from Emrveys made in previous years. Continuing the work in the same direction, the accompanying copy of a sheet completed during the present year by Mr. Dorr will be found to contain the shore-line and the characteristics of Key Vacas, part of Boot Key, the Stirrup Keys, Fat Deer Key, and Bamboo Key. Particulars in reference to the size and quality of these are given in the repOTt of Mr. Doir, before referred to (A.)

The plane table work-has been continued also on the outside of Key Largo, the sl10re-line !:tavi11g been traced from Point Charles soutlnvard and westward to its termination. Below, and adjacent to Key Largo, the outer shores of tho Upper and Lower )fatecumbe were likewise · run during the season by Sub-Assistant S. A. "\Vainwright. His report, stating the comparntiYe quality of soil, timber growth, and peculiaritieR of thr;sc and other keys in the vicinity, is appended, marked (0.) 'l'he triangulation of the keys last alluded to was executed by Lieut . .A.. H. Seward, U. 8. A.. , .A.ssi:-<tant. This work is joined on the southward by a series of triangles begun at Pigeon Key by Lieut. J. C. Clark, U. S . .A.., Assi8tanL and extended northward and eastward to a station on Lower :M:atecumbe. In reference to the character of the keys fallin~ "'ithin the limits of hi~ triangulation, Lieut. Clark reports as follows: '·From Pigeon Key to Lower ~fatecumbe, the line of keys is quite narrow, not affoTding well conditioned triangles, nor sides of sufficiellt length without using exterior points for stations, aud the practicable points on the reef are tofJ far apaTt for the purpose. Stations were erected ou several shrntb between the ke_\·s and the main lan<l,. but consi<lorable difficulty was experienced in occupying thorn on account of the rush of the tide when accompanied by wind." "Between these shoals and the keys is a channel for vessels of light draught, which is much used during the prevalence of high southerly winds." ''There are several harbors within the limits of the triangulation, as Knight' 8 Harbor, Jacob's Harlmr, Tom's Harbor, and a fourth at tl1e eastern cxtrc>mity of Long Ke:·." For statements of particulars in regard to the number and marking of the quarter sections in the several keys, I would respectfully refer to the tracings and accompanying reports. The reported incursions of hostile Indians in the immediate vicinity of Cape Sable, at the extremity of the Florida peninsula, made it impracticable to commence the work there as early in the season as had been intended. Before its dose, however, the party of Mr. Dorr succeeded in completing the plane table survey, and marking in quarter sections of the strip of land adjacent to Cape Sable and extending from ~- \Y. Cape, on the nortlnvard and \vcstward of it, to "Upp er Crossing," opposite to the Oy;;ter Keys. The sheet of this locality, a copy of which accompanies this report, include;; the site of the base meat'ured near Cape Sable in 1S55, and also Sandy Key, lying outside, to the southward and eastward. Descriptive references to the local features of the tract included in the survey here mentioned will be found in the appended report (A.) of Mr. Dorr. Very respectfully yours, A. D. BACHE,

June 21, !851. Sm: In compliance with your instructions of November 19, 1856, I proceeded to Key West, but I was unable to engage a piftt to accompany me to Cape Sable, such was the general terror of Indians. I therefore lost no. time in commencing a sheet among the keys about twenty-five miles to the northward and eastward of Key West. I reached the scene of active operations about the 20th of January, 1857. Burnt Ke:y, which was the first i~ ordeT of survey, is upwards of a mile and a half in length,

but quite narrow. The land is slightly elevated, and sustains a growth of large trees, principally button-wood, with scarcely any mangroves. South of this are two small keys, not wooded, and nearly covered at high water. Directly west of Burnt Key, and scarcely hafr a mile distant, is Knock-' em-down Key, which is three miles in length, and averages neaTly a mile in breadth. Comparatively a small portion of it is beyond the reach of ordinary high ·water, and it is very much cut up by lagoons and creeks. But a small portion of the key is wooded. Budd Key, the next to the NW., is about a mile in length, but narrow. It is separated into throe distinct parts by narrow channels, one of which is quite deep even at low water. Beyond this, to the NW., are some half a dozen small mangrove keys and shoals, only one of which, Michael's Key, iB judged worthy of a name, and that is but little more than a quarter of a mile in length. A mile to the northward, howeve1·, brings us to Raccoon Key, which is one and a half miles long, and from a quarter to half a mile in width. The woods occupy but a small portion of the surface. They are principally of button-wood and mangrove. .. N\V. of this are three small mangrove keys, the largest of which, Eagle Key, covers an area of nearly a quarter of a square mile. Parts of the :l.'orch and Howe's Keys also came on my sheet. The former group, with it8 numerous shoals and small grassy keys, intersected by numerous channels, most of them dry, or nearly so, at low water, covers an area of about four square miles. Torch Key proper is, in some places, a mile wide, and is to a great extent overgrown with button-wood, sea grape, torch, a few palmetto, and numerous other species of trees. East of this are three small keys, from three to five hundred metres in length, each densely covered with mangrove. Duo north of Torch, and separated from it by a channel only one-fourth of a mile wide, are a group called the Water KeyR. TheRe stretch in a northerly direction about three mileR, and are all connected by flats at low water, at which time they form one continuous chain. But long before the tide reaches its full height they are separated into nearly a dozen, most of them very small. The most southerly, and the only one of any size, is long and narrow, being more than half the length of the whole chain, and supports a ridge of large high trees. The western half of Howe's Key. lies to the SE. of Water Key, distant three-fourths of a mile, and the portion on my sheet covers an area of nearly two square miles. The NW. part is low and intersected by lagoons, and the woods are thin. To the north and west of Water Key are the Eastern and Western Contents. These giiups stretch in a NE. direction for about three miles, and vary in breadth from a half to threequarters of a mile. They are intersected by numerous deep passages, mostly narrow, except the one behveen the two groups, which is over half a mile wide, and at the mouth of which there is a break in the reef which stretches along outside of these keys for a considerable distance. Lastly comes Harbor Key, situated about one and a quarter mile E.NE. of the Contents. This iB a small, nearly round key, scarcely two hundred mettfes in diameter; but the land is high, and the woofts dense. It can be seen and readily distinguished at a considerable distance, and derives some importance f~om being a prominent landmark for vessels cruising in the bay. There is a narrow strip of -0oral reef, north of the Eastern Content group, a little more than one-fourth of a mile distant, which is bare at low water. Between it and the shore the water

is shallow, but the outer edge falls precipitately to a depth of one and a half fathoms. The space included between the Contents, Water, Torch, and Raccoon Keys, an area of six square miles, is one extensive flat, not quite dry at low water, except in a few scattered places, yet impassable for boats e:en of the smalle;;t draught. The accompanying map of this locality contains eighty-nine quarter section stakes, labelled, respectively, M, P, or NP . .After completing the sheet just mentioned, I succeeded in obtaining a pilot for Cape Sable, where I commenced about the middle of March, and worked as far from the base line as was practicable previous to triangulation. Cape Sable, from what I could learn, is probably an island formed by Shark river, leading up to White Water bay, a large inland lake, and this, also, has an outlet towards the east, which empties somewhere into Barnes' sound. From Cape Sable proper, or, as it is sometimes called, the Eastern Cape, to Palm Point there is a fine sand beach, with a ridge about three feet in height running along just back of high water mark. This gradually falls away towards the woods, which are in most places upwards of a hundred yards from the shore, but in some places run in close to the beach . .A.t Palm Point there is a large open space of firm ground, a fine rolling prairie, some six feet above the level of the sea. It has recently been selected as the site for a small military station, Fort Cross. The most prominent objects in this vicinity are two tall palm trees, the largest being upwards of one hundred feet in height. They are quite useful as landmarks. Just beyond the prairie at Palm Point, proceeding in a NW. direction, the woods again approach to the water's edge and continue to skirt the shore for some two miles, where they begin gradually to recede, and there is a fine high sand beach, reaching to the Northwest Cape. Here, again, there is a high undulating prairie. Beyond that the woods grow close to the water's edge, and to the westward of this point there is no clear land for several miles. None, in fact, except here and there a very small prairie on some of the innumerable scattered islands, formed by the mouths of the various rivers between here and Cape Roman. For the shore-line from Palm Point to the Northwest Cape, I was obliged to use a separate sheet. From Fort Poinsett, eastward, there is a high sand beach, as far as a point which makes out abreast the east end of the base line. The walking would be good were it not for the dead mangroves which have decayed and fallen into the water. A.t the foot of the sand ridge the soft gray mud commences, and stretches out with scarcely a perceptible variation in the depth of the water for some distance, say two hundred yards, and from there shoals very gradually out to the channel, about three-quarters of a mile, where there is from seven to ten feet of water. This channel extends, perhaps, a mile beyond the Oyster Keys. To the eastward of that the whole country is one extensive fl.at, dry at low water for miles. After a strong northerly wind has prevailed for a day or two, this becomes perfectly bare to a. distance of two or three miles from the main, and remains so until a change of wind. The Burfaee i.s covered entirely by gray mud, into which a pedestrian must sink more than two feet at every step. Beyond the point above mentioned the mangroves grow to the water's edge, and, in fact, from .the mol'e·line. This growth continues to the ... Upper Crossing,'' opposite the Oyster

Keys, the eastern boundary of my sheet. Here there is a narrow opening, perhaps twenty yards wide, where the prairie comes down to the water's edge. Beyond that the mangrove appears again and is absolutely impenetrable. There is a narrow strip of fast land between the beach and the base line. There the "Glades" commence-a marsh dotted with hammocks. These latter are mostly qaite narrow, although some stretch to a considerable length. To the NW. of the second mile-stone of the base line, there is a solid growth of black mangrove, reaching to Fort Poinsett. In it arc several ponds, mostly small, although one, tho largest, is three-fourths of a mile in length. These are all connected together by trails worn by the alligators in their migrations from one pond to the other, and to White Water lake, which commences about a mile and a half NV'l. of the west base, .and st.retches in a NW. direction between four and five miles to just beyond Palm Point. It averages three-quarters of a mile in width. The water is salt, and the ebb and flow of the tide, though slight, is plainly perceptible. The bottom is composed of very soft and unusually sticky black mud. The lake is completely enclosed by the woods, except portions of the eastern shore, which border on the prairie. While I was there the water was very shallo-w, as was the case with all the ponds, a number of them even being entirely dry. The greatest depth of water did not exceed six inche8. But when the Glades are foll-during the rainy season-the water rises to a height of over six feet. :My sheet of this vicinity also embraces Sandy Key. This is a narrow strip of land, in shape resembling the two legs of a right-angled triangle, and is only remarkable for the countless flocks of sea birds which frequent it. The sheet last referred to is marked by fifty-two quarter section stakes, labelled, respectively, M, P, or NP, mostly the latter. After completing all I judged it prudent to attempt previous to triangulation, towards the latter part of April I proceeded to the Vacas Keys. Having obtained points of Lieut. Clark, furnished from his work of this season, I commenced upon Key V acas, joining Assistant Ad~ms' work of a previous season, and worked in an easterly direction. Key Vacas is about five and a half miles in length, and varies in width from a quarter to half a mile. It is mostly wooded, although parts of it are cleared, and towards the eastern extremity there is a small settlement of about a dozen houses. An extensive shoal makes out from the southern shore for a mile or upwards, scattered portions of which are dry at low water. A number of very small keys and rocks lie at short distances from the northern shore of Key Vacas, only one of which-Rachel's Key-bas been named. That part of Boot Key which my sheet embraces is nearly two miles long, but very narrow. The eastern portion is high, firm ground, but the middle of the key is entirely cut up by lagoons and deep channels. The Stirrup Keys are three in number, and lie to the northward of Key Vacas; the largest, on which the station is situated, is three-fourths of a mile long, and in the widest place measures about a quarter of a mile. Fat Deer Key lies to the eastward of Key Vacas, from which it is separated by a narrow but quite deep channel, called Jacob's Harbor Passage. This key is much cut up by numerous channels, most of them deep, and is, moreover, divided throughout its entire length by a large lagoon. The whole length of that portion of the group which is contained on my sheet is about two miles, and it averages about a quarter of a mile in width.

Bamboo Key lieB to the northward of the preceding. It is scarcely a quarter of a mile long by about one hundred metres in width. This sheet is marked by sixty-seven quarter section stakes, labelled, respectively, M, P, or lVP. It was completed on the 16th of May, at ·which date I discontinued operations m Section VI. The total amount of work done by my party was: shore line, 210i miles; wood and marsh line, 69 miles, within a total area of seventy-three square miles. Yours, very respectfully, F. W. DORR, U. S. C.

B. W ASRINGTON CITY, D. C., June 10, 1857. Sm: In pursuance of your instructions I repaired to Key West in November. Owing to repairs of. my vessel, the U. S. schooner Agassiz, and the death of my assistant, Mr. S. J. Hough, the commencement of my work was delayed until the 3d of January. The operations of my party this year embraced the topography and marking of the following named Florida keys, viz: Big Torch, Little Torch, Big Pine, No Name, Howe's, Newfound Harbor, Pye's, Annette, Little Spanish, Big Spanish, Flat, Grassy, Johnson's, East and West Bahia Honda, and several smaller keys in their vicinity. Ramrod Key is one and a half miles in length by one and a quarter miles in breadth; the outer shore is of coral rock. The key is covered with heavy mangrove, palmetto, sea grape, and button-wood. On 'the southeastern end is a lagoon three and a quarter miles long by a quarter of a mile wide. 'l'he depth of water in this lagoon is from five to fifteen inches. This key was marked by fourteen painted posts in parallel-meridian, and also in quarter sections. The rocky portion of the key was marked by iron stakes, two and a half feet long, driven into the rock four inches. These were marked with a coltl chisel on one side, the letter M, NP, or P, being painted on another side. On other parts of the key yellow pine posts, four feet long, were driven into the ground one and a half feet, and protected by coral rocks piled around them. The posts were marked on one side with the letters U.S.C.S., and on the other side M, l'P, or P, with black paint. Big Torch Key, which lies next to- Ramrod, is irregular in shape, and is divided into three separate keys by a channel one mile in length by one hundred and sixty-four yards wide, with a depth varying from six inches to three feet. The shore of To1·ch is rocky on the eastern and western sides; the northern and southern being extensive mud flats covered by the sea at high tide. This key is a formation of coral rock, covered with a thin crust of marl about one inch in depth, and is thickly wooded with black mangrove, palmetto, sea grape, and buttonwood. The key was marked by thirty posts of iron and yellow pine, designated as those on RamT<ld Key. . .Mttle 'Porch .Key is separated from Big Torch by a channel two and.a. quarter miles in length by a quarter of a mile in breadth, with a depth of three feet. This key is three miles in length and a. half a mil~ in breadth; the soil and wood ar-e like those of Big Torch Key. Little Torch

388

was marked by fifteen posts of iron and yellow pine, similar to the section marks of Big Torch Key. Big Pine Key, due east of Big and Little Torch, is of irregular shape. It is nine miles in length by three miles in breadth, comprises an area of thirteen square miles, and is covered with a heavy growth of yellow pjne trees, varying in height from twenty-five to sixty feet. The eastern shore, extending from Big Pine station to nearly opposite No Name station, is a white sandy beach, the remainder being of coral rock, with mud flats here and there. This key, as others, is covered with small rocks, and with soil in some plE·ces from one to two inches in depth. The only feature claiming attention is the pine timber, the northern end being thickly wooded with mangrove and button-wood. There is on the northwestern side a small lagoon, which is nearly dry at low 'vater. This key was marked by fifty-five posts of yellow pine, with the letters U.S.C.S. on one side, and M, lVP, or P, on the other, with black paint. No Name Key, which lies due east of Big Pine, is three miles in length and one and a half miles in breadth. ThiR key is covered with a heavy growth of mangrove and palmetto. A grove of yellow pine trees about a quarter of a mile square extends into the middle of the key. The soil on No Name is similar in character to that of Big Pine Key. No Name Key was marked by seventeen posts of yellow pine, distinguished as those placed on Big Pine Key. lfewfound Harbor is a group of three small keys. The largest is of irregular shape, and is one and a quarter miles in length by a quarter mile in breadth in the middle, tapering at each end to two hundred and eighteen yards in breadth. Another is about two hundred and seventythree yards in length by one hundred and sixty yards in breadth. The third, which nearly joins to Big Pine Key, is about a half mile in length by one hundred and sixty-four yards in breadth. These keys are covered with mangrove and button-wood, and were marked by five posts. There is a fine harbor on the int'lide of the keys for vessels drawing from four to ten feet. Littk Pine Key lies due north of Big Pine and No Name Keys; is three miles in length by seven-eighths of a mile in breadth in the centre, the eastern and western ends being about two hundred and eighteen yards wide. This, like Big Pine Key, is mostly covered with yellow pine trees, varying in height from twenty-five to fifty feet. The eastern and western ends are thickly covered with black mangrove and button-wood. The soil is similar to that of Big Pine Key. On this key fourteen posts of yellow pine were planted, and marked as those on the key last mentioned. Pye' s Harbor Key is a small mangrove key, and lies between Loggerhead and Newfound Harbor. It is surrounded by extensive mud flats, covered with water at the lowest tides. Annette Key, due north of Big Pine, is one and a quarter miles in length by a half mile in breadth. The surface is covered with thick mangrove and button-wood, and is marked by posts of yellow pinA. There is a low flat key adjoining which is entirely covered by the sea at high tide, and is surrounded by extensive mud flats, bare at low water. Big BpanuiA Key is the most northerly, covered with thick mangroves and entirely over· flowed at the lowest tides. Little Spaniak Key, east of Big Spanish, is about three-quarters of a ll'.lile in leD.gth by one quarter of a mile in breadth. This key also is overgrown with mangrove, with ex.tensive, m~d flats inside. The northern part of the key is nearly covered with ~t.er at high ti~e. ftus key was marked by two yellow pine posts.

Howe's Key, which lies northwest of Big Pine, is thickly covered with black mangrove and button-wood. The southeastern end is much cut up with lagoons, varying in depth from six to twenty inches, but nearly dry at low tide. This key was marked 'oy fifteen posts of iron and yellow pine, designated as others already described. ]}fayo' s Key, east of Annette Key, is one mile in length by two hundred and seventy-three yards at the widest part. This key, like the others, is thickly overgrown with black mangrove, sea grape, and button-wood, and was marked by four yellow pine posts. Johnson's Keys, three in number, lie due north of Little Pine Key. Key No. 1 is seveneighths of a mile in length by a quarter of a mile in breadth. K~y No. 2 is about one mile in length by a half mile in breadth. Key No. 3 is six hundred and fifty-six yards in length and one hundred yards. in breadth. These keys are likewise covered with black mangrove, sea grape, and a small quantity of button-wood. The area was divided by eleven posts of yellow pine, and marked as those on other keys. Flat Key, northeast of the Johnson Keys, is one mile in length by a half mile in breadth, and is covered by the sea at high tide. It is thickly overspread with mangrove and buttonwood. This key was marked by three yellow pine posts. West Bahia Honda, one mile from Flat Key, is a half mile in length by one-eighth of a mile in breadth. It is covered by the sea at high tide. East Bahia Honda, two and a half miles east of West Bahia Honda, is about one-half mile in length by one-third of a mile in breadth. This key is also thickly covered with heavy mangrove. My season's work, of four months, covers an area of thirty-one square miles, and includes one hundred and ninety miles of shore-line. Mr. G. U. Mayo assisted me in the work part of the season. The topography is comprised in three sheets, which will be deposited in the archives when inked. Operations were discontinued on the 3rd of May. The schooner Agassiz was laid up in Baltimore, on June 3, 1857. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, C. T. !ARDELLA., Sub-Assistant U. S. Coast Survey.

INDIAN KEY, FLORIDA.,

May 4, 1857. DEAR Sm: I have to report that, in obedience to your instructions of November, I proceeded to Key Largo, Florida, on the 16th of January. . After putting down eighty section posts there for the land office, the Indian hostilities having
increased, it was deemed imprudent to expose the party, which was without any means of defen~e. I prooeeded to Point Charles and continued the plane table work on the outside of Key Largo, a.nd have completed all the key and the creeks, as far as it was possible to go from \.he sea·si'de; tJ.so the outside shore-line of Upper and Lower Matecumbe, which extends about four miles below India.n Key.

outward shore of Key Largo and all the keys is of coral rock, soft enough in places to force the posts down; where this was impossible, I used iron stakes flattened at the top, and marked with a chisel U. S. C. S. on one side, M, or P, or JYP, as the case required, on the other. The wooden posts were marked with the same characters in paint. The soil on Largo Key, from Point Charles, where my season's work commenced, is superior to that of most of tho other keys. This key, Upper and Lower Matecumbe, and Lignumvitre, being the most fertile of' any of the large keys, the growth on them is large and very prolific. They are covered for some distance back from the water with a low growth of small trees and bushes, where the land is comparatively high, caused by the water making its deposit there. Going towards the interior the trees are large, but tho ground swampy, from the creeks which pass through the higher land in small streams, and spread themselves over the key in numerous branches and ponds. The two Matecumbe Keys are much more free of these than Key Largo. The upper one has one Rpr1ng; the lower, five. Key Rodriguez is overflowed at high tide, and Tavernier has some fast land on it, only on the northern end, which would probably be overflowed at very high tide. The two small keyi;; Dove and Tea Table have a very good soil on them, deep enough for almost any growth. If properly drained they would be very profitable, having the best soil I have seen in Florida. Y ery respectfully, S. A. WAINWRIGHT. Profesi;;or A. D. BACHE, Supt. U. S. Coast Survey.

September 10, 1857. Srn: In compliance with your instructions of .Tune 16th, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my party during the past year. Our work ~as been extended from Point Conversion, near the southern limit of the Santa Clara valley, eastward to and including Point Duma. The first plane table sheet extends from Point Conversion eastward to the Canada de Isique, and embraces as rough and difficult a portion of topography as can well be imagined. A spur of the coast range of mountains here meets the ocean, and its steep and rocky sides, overgrown with brush and cactus, are made even more desolate and forbidding by innumerable barrancaBt gU/,clws, and eanadas. These terms have been adopted by .Americans living in California, and are now in general use, as being much more expressive than any English' words that could be employed to convey the same ideas. The first signifies a deep break cut into the hill-side by winter rains. The term "gnl-Oh" conveys tl1e idea of a small a1;1d narrow valley, very tortuous in its course, the bottom cut into irregular falls, and strewed withlal.'gO bolllders, over wbic'h the water.a sweep with violence. Its steep side11 are ge~rally oo:nre<l wi,tkthick brnsb1

and form the haunts of bear, deer, and great numbers of rattlesnakes. The "call.atlas" differ from gulches, in being comparatively _wide, level, and rileasant valleys, in which are to be found fine large oak and sycamore tree8, and usually water, which, however, seldom reaches the coast, losing itself in the luose gravelly soil of its own bed some miles in the interior. * * * * * * * The part of the coast range embraced by the first sheet has an average altitude of about twelve hundred feet above high water. As the mountains spring abruptly from the water line, we were restricted to a small sand beach in laying out a base for the work. Canada de las AUsos, though small, is the principal valley represented on the first sheet. It extends from the coast in a northeasterly direction for about eit;ht or nine miles, bending in the table-land or basin included by the ranchos of Conejo and Truenso. This basin is from a thousand to twelve hundred feet ahove the ocean. The names of the other principal gulches and cai'iadas are : Cold Sp1'i11g Guldi, i-o called from a spring of delicious cool water that bursts out but a few yards from the beach ; Ca11wla de Santa Jueta, in which water is to be found in pool!', and Canada de Isique. In this la!'t water may be had a mile and a half from tho coast, near a point where it suddenly disappears. Judging from the number of rattlesnakes which we have killed in the field and among our tents, it seem,; a wonder that no serious misfortune lrns been met by the party. At the last · station they were so numerous that it has been named by the men ''rattlesnake camp.'' Two horses, temporarily in my employ, were bitten at different times. In both cases the swelling rapidly extended to the chest and neck, occasioning great difficulty in swallowing, but b:-.repeated drenchings with a mixture of whiskey, salmratus and water, and proper attention to the wounds, both ultimately recovered. * * * * * * Our second sheet extends from Canada de Isiquc to Point Duma, (also called Suma.) On this the character of the topography undergoes a slight change. At the cafiada just named commences a strip of table-land between the coast and the foot of the hilb. This is only a hundred and fifty yards wide, but gradually increa8es in the di1·ection to Point Duma, where it is several miles in extent. 'The average height of this table-land is about two hundred. feet. A.bout five miles ell.st of Point Duma the hills again approach boldly to the shore-line. Between Canada de Isique and Point Duma tlrn country is very much cut up by fifteen large gulches extending into the interior from six to eight miles. In several of these are fine streams of water, also a consider~ble quantity of oak timber; bnt this, from its situation, will never be of value. No names have yet been applied to the intervening gulches. The canadas represented on the sheet are two in number : Canada las Francas and Canada del Suma. In the first of these, at a depth of twelve feet below the surface, and half a mile from the shore, we found water, but it was too brackish for use. Suma is the larger cafi:.i.da of the two, aud contains a spring of very good water and some very fine oak and 8ycamore trees. * * After. favorable winters, this part of the country might support from twenty-five hundr:ed to three thousand head of cattle. Its use will probably be confined to pasturage. * * * The winter has stolen upon us unu,sually ea:rly, and we have had several slight showers already. One of the surest indications of the approach of ·winter is found in the little springs that fail during the dry season, again making themselves visible at the approach of the rainy season. * * * * * * * * * * I have .the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, W. :M.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 44.
Report of Assistant W: E. Greenwell, on the survey, character, and resources of the islands and main culJacent to Santa Barbara channcl, Oalifornia.
U.
DEAR S. SCHOONER HUMBOLDT,

Prisoner's Harbor, August 16, 1857. Sm: In conformity with your instructions of June 16th, I forward you a Slfmmary report of work executed the past year, and with it I propose to make some remarks, which may not be ont~of place, in reference to the coast, the Santa Barbara islands, and f;ome suggestions as to the most practicable time of pushing the main and secondary triangulation in this section. From San Pedro, excepting the high land immediately adjacent to the coast, is smooth and even prairie land for a distance well up in the bight of Bahia-Ona, and from thence to Point Conversion the mountains run down abruptly to the shore, barren, rugged, and useless for any habitable purpose. From Point Oonven;ion to the old mission of San Buenaventura, some twenty mile;;, the coast is beautifully smooth and level-a wide open prairie of fertile land, part of which is watered by the Santa Clara river. From San Buenaventura to Santa Barbara the mountains again touch the shore, leaving occasional valleys and spots of cultivated ground. Between~Santa Barbara and Point Conception, a distance of about forty-five miles, the li~e of coast is unbroken-by any elevation, the range of mountains running parallel with it, but lying back in the rear from four to six miles, and gradually sloping to the very shores of the ocean. Such, in a word, are the general features of the line of coast stretching from San Pedro to Point Conception-a part of it offering advantages for the rapid secondary work, and a part presenting many obstacles to its progress. You will see by the sketch encloRed (No. 56) that the Recondary triangulation has been carried from San Pedro well up to Point Duma. I prnpose, when a suitable occasion presents itself, to complete this up to the last named point, so that this line of coast will be then ready for a topographical party. This secondary work was executed during my first winter in California, when the state of the atmosphere was such that no observations could be made on the main lines. Santa Cruz island will likewise be triangulated before ~he season terminates, and a part of Santa Rosa or San Nicholas, whichever may be found most practicable, as the season advances. By the sketch it will be seen that the main work has bee:i;i_ carried along the coast up to its present limit ·without touching the islands. The work has been extended np to Anacapa, by avoiding the long lines centering on Santa Barbara island, which proved, during a part of my first winter, to be impracticable. There is something remarkable about this little island of Santa Barbara. It is constantly enveloped in fog, and even when the rest are bright and clear the fog seems to hang over this isolated rock without ever lifting. I have observed the same phenomenon at a high bluffy point, exposed to the NW., on the island of Santa Cruz. ~rom Laguna station the lines r_un to Anacapa, Santa Cruz island, San Buenaventura, and so on, from island to main up to Pomt Conception. The sket~h gives full idea of the scheme, as already compfoted, and as laid out for the future, but no description could give an adequate knowledge of the labor it has cost to carry it through. I feel proud that I have been able to accomplish it. With your approval and appreciation of my exertions, it in some measure compensates me for the hardships gone ~ through, both in the prosecution of this main work and in the successful triangulation of the ·t a.re' island of Santa Cruz. Of the primary work, the proper and only months to carry 1 on

a:

commencing in November and ending in March. Early in March the fogs set in, and if not fog, a sort of blue haze, through which no instrument will penetrate. It would be useless to attempt observations on the long lines at any other period of the year than these. The spring, summer, and fall months are well suited for secondary and tertiary triangulation, when the lines are short, for island work particularly, or for such of them as can be triangulated upon short baBes measured upon the island itself, or some one adjacent. Santa Rosa, San Miguel, and San Nicholas can be surveyed in this way; but I will speak of these hereafter, and give my views in reference to them. San Pedro is the port of the little town of Los Angeles. As a harbor, it is perfectly safe in summer, spring, and fall, but open to the SE. gales of winter. It is the port of egress of all the produce of the section of country that surrounds it, and the point from whence the military post Fort Tejon, about one hundred miles off, secures its supplies, equipments, &c. I subjoin a statistical table of the exports shipped from this port for the first three quarters of the past fiscal year: n may be interesting, as showing its importance to the lower part of the western coast.

REPORT OF THE SUPERL.'tTENDENT OF

Of the islands forming what is known as the Santa B~rbara channel, Sama RoiJa ii:i1 perhaps, the most valuable. It is level, compared with the other islands, but mountainovs op. the south side, the hill& there sloping gradually to the north and west, and so smooth that a horseman can ride all over them. There is no wood on the island. but a bountiful supply of water, which runs the whole year round. At the present time there arc some 7,000 head of cattl(;) upon it3, 000 sheep, and probably as many wild hogs. Santa Rosa has been confirmed to Captain Thompson by the United States district oottrt, and is now considered as a private estate. Upon the island is a suit.able site for a short base, from which both it and San Miguel could be triangulated. San Migud, adjacent to Santa Rosa, is a small, smooth island, the highest elevation being not more than four or five hundred feet above the ocean. It is without wood, and has a very limited supply of water. At present there are some four or five hundred head of sheep upon it. It is, I believe, public domain. .. Santa Gru~ is altogether different from the two islands last mentioned. It is very mount· ainous, the surface being thrown up in sharp ridges, and presenting gulches and peaks of every conceivahlff form, the latter averaging in height from 1, 500 to 2, 000 feet above the ocean. It is considered valuable, but i:s so rugged that it is impossible to ride over it, and it is only with the greatest difficulty that footmen can pass up or down the slopes of the mount· ams. There is a :fine stream of water on this island, and very convenient to the anchorage in Prisoner's harbor. This fact is_ well worth being generally known. There is also wood (live oak) on the island, but not convenient to the anchorage. The daim to this island has also been confirmed, and it is considered private property. At present there are some 7, 000 or 8, 000 head of sheep upon it, and probably the finest in California. The excellence of Santa Cruz mutton is proverbial in the San Francisco market, and it commands occasionally almost fabulous prices. This island, like all in its vicinity, is unfit for cultivation, but is valuable alone as a grazing rancho. Here, as on the other islands, stock of every description is free from the depredation so common on the main land; and the expense of transporting it to the main shore, and thence to market, is considered more than counterbalanced by the increase saved when thus free from the risk of being stolen, and the destruction of the young by bears, coyotes, &c. San Nw/W/,as is different from Santa Rosa or Santa Cruz. It is considered valueless. on . . ac· count of the sandy nature of it;s soil and its distance from the main land. The island is low table-land, not mo;e than three or four hundred feet above the ocean, without v~eys, and with very little vegetation. There is no wood on it, but gooG. water can be found near the northwest point. It is, I believe, public property. San~ Gat<Jlina I have described in a previous report. It ii:i mountainous and r~ed, and in this respect very much like Santa Cruz, but without the valleys or S'Jl.pply of w:ater which that island affords. I believe it is public property. San Olemente I have not visited, but, from all I can learn, it resembles the islands above described, with the exception of being less rugged, ~ore level, and with less elevation. There is wood a'nd water upon it, and a good shelter from the northwest winds at the southeast end of the island. This is also public property. It seems probable tha.t a; s~~ l;:l.a.se roig~t be found on it sufficient for its triangulation. I propose tQ visit this ·.~ w~~ a sm:table

upon short bases, measured upon each separate island, if required. In the case of San Miguel, however, this would hardly be necessary, it being so small and so near Santa Rosa that one base would be sufficient for the triangulation of both. The three last named islands will not be difficult to triangulate or survey. Santa Catalina has no spot upon it Rllitable for a base, and will thus have to be connected with the main work before a secondary triangulation of it can be made. I am under the im· 'pression that, With a side, as base, once upon the island, it can be cut up in triangles.somewhat ~fter the manner of Santa Cruz. Of this, however, I am not certain. Very respectfully, &c.,

APPENDIX No. 45.
De,scription

ef an apparatus for

measuring subsUliary base lines.

Some improvements having been made in the mechanical parts of the apparatus described in ·Appendix No. 60 of the Coast Survey Report for 1856, which materially facilitate its use, it is thought desirable to describe it again in its improved form. A.ny apparatus for the measurement of base lines which does not, in a great degree, combine 'the principles and details of the principal base apparatus of the coaf't survey, must necessarily 'fall far short of it, not only in accuracy, but also in facility of use and despatch. The compensation of the effects of temperature, with all the means of securing uniformity of action, the delicacy of the level of contact, the facility of adjustment in line and elevation afforded by the elaborate construction of the trestles, cannot be approached by appliances 'much short of that apparatus itself, and to it we must always look for the accurate ascertainment of distances. There are many cases, however, of local surveys in advance of primary triangulation, and of check measurements desired in extensive secondary series, in which an accuracy of lineal measurement less than that attainable with the compensating base apparatus is sufficient, and whei'e the 'greater length of time required in using an inferior apparatus is compensated by the fact that it requires bnt little mol'e than the usual force of a triangulation party to operate 'iHth it. For the purposes indicated different means have, at various times, been devised and used by !~istanta 'h°aving chal-ge of such work, and an apparatus designed by :Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle, 'is de'!!<Jnbed in :Appendix No. 41, Coast Survey Report for 1855. The foi'tn of construction now presented is the re81llt of a careful study of the sunjeet by Assistant J. E. Hilgard and Mr. Joseph Saxton, in consultation with the Snperintendent, with 1 1!peeiai '~ferehce fu the experience with other apparatus. It has been used in the measure'merit 'M .three lines <hfring th~ pbt two ~a.rs by different persons, and has given great satisiach"on <ta !the opera.to~ . . . jJrmeitJaJ. lJdinte tt.rrived a;t were the following : ·l.

2. To effect the contact of the rods or coincidence of lines by a continuous screw motion. 3. In the construction of the supports, to combine a large range in elevation with the means of making a nice final adjustment. The manner in which these ends have been attained may be seen on sketch No. 69, where the apparatus is figured. A. round iron rod, five-sixteenths of an inch -in diameter and four metres long, is encased in a solid wooden bar, three inches wide and six inches deeJ?, composed of two pieces firmly screwed together, as seen on figures 1 and 2. Figure 3 shdws the manner in which the thermometer is inlaid in the middle of the bar, so as' to bring the bulb near the iron rod, the top of its case closely filling up the aperture. In practice, the thermometer is withdrawn and read every twenty minutes or half hour. The temperature of the rod changes slowly, and, while it never differs greatly from that of the surrounding air, it is unaffected by alternations of sunshine and clouds, which greatly affect the indications of an exposed thermometer. In figure 1 the upper part of the wooden bar is taken off, in order to show the details of the arrangement for making the contact; a is the forward end of a rod already in position, armed at the end with a plane of hardened steel; a1 is a portion of the forward bar about to be brought into position in contact with a; each rod is movable lengthwise in its groove by the action of a screw d, counteracted by the spring e; J is a short tube, armed with a steel knifeedge which slides over the end of the rod and is pushed outward by a spiral spring rather more than sufficient to overcome its friction, (see figure 7,) and has a delicate line drawn on it, the coincidence of which with a similar line on the index plate i fastened to the rod determines that position of the slide in which the knife-edge is at the known distance from the plane at the other end of the rod; the silver index plate i is visible through a slit in the sliding piece called the abutting slUle; the plate j passes through a notch in the collar k and prevents the rod from twisting by the action of the screw. When the whole bar is nicely adjusted on trestles or stands in elevation and alignment, and within one-eighth of an inch in distance either way, the exact adjustment is effected by sliding the rod within the bar by means of the screw d, counteracted by the spring e, until the lines on the index plate and abutting slide coincide, the knife-edge on the latter abutting meanwhile against the steer plane of the preceding bar, which suffers no pressure except that due to the small spiral spring within the abutting slide. In judging of the coincidence of lines, a mag· nifier is made use of, which can be conveniently attached to the bar or carried by the operator. A level sector, figure 2, by means of which the bar can be set level or to any desired iuclina· tion, or on which the accidental inclination of each bar may be read o:ff, is attached near the back end of the bar close to the person directing the adjustment of the bar and making the contact. Before the measurement of a line the sectors should be adjusted by placing the knife-edge at one end and the middle of the plane at the other end of each bar on a level (by means of a levelling instrument or a theodolite set up equidistant from both ends) and adjusting the level to the zero of the arc. Figures 4, 5 and 6, show the improved stand. On a tripod stand, wi:th double 1$gs of the usual construction, is screwed a cross-piece l, carrying the upright guides m, m, 'to which can · be clamped at any elevation the cross-piece n, which has a small spirit-level atta.Ched roindicate its horizontal position i a similar crQSs-piece o can be moved parallel ton, 11p·'Ol' doW'Il:.eequarters of an inch from its average position by means of the wedge p, as the.drawing sb.ows e.bundantly-.

and which is in a ~ike manner attached to the lower cross-piece n, is introduced to react against the clamping screws, and to throw apart the pieces o and o1 when the screws are loosened, so as to admit of easy movement along the upright guides m, n, to which end friction rollers x, x 1 , are also inserted into the ends of the cross-pieces moving between the guides, a little play being of course allowed. The design is to make all the movements free and easy, so as to require no close fitting, and to operate well under all changes of heat and moisture, the cl.amping securing perfect stability after the bar is brought into position. An equab]e motion, without jarring and with certain bearing, is secured for the wedge by causing it to move between friction rollers, as indicated in figure 4. The rollers are of the simplest kinds, being merely perforated cylinders of brass running on steel pins driven into the wood. The wedge being found to run with great ease on the rollers, and liable to fly out when under the weight of the bars, a :flat spring is introduced between the side of the wedge and cross-piece n, which, pressing the wedge against the guides m, n, causes a uniform friction independent of the weight of the bar. IN MAKING THE MEASUREMENT, the bars being four metres in length, the stands are set up at distances of two metres, each bar being supported at one-fourth its length from the ends. The tripod legs are so placed that one of each stand is in the direction of the line towards the middle of the bar. The height of the stands is approximately adjusted by the spreading of the legs, which, however, remain clamped at an average slope when the ground is even. The proper distance for the stands is ascertained by a light rod of two metres in lengih laid on the ground. The wedge p being now placeti in its midway position, the cross-piece n is clamped at a suitable height, which is ascertained by sighting across the top of the pieces o to a bar already in position, n, being kept level by means of the small spirit-level attached to it, which should be placed on the forward side of n, so as to be under the eye of the person adju~ting the height, one of the assistants tightening the clamps when so directed. The bar is next placed on the stands in approximate alignment, for which the space between the upright makes ample allowance, if the stands are set with moderate care; it is then adjusted in elevation by means of the wedges, and either placed level or at any slight inclination, and the sector read off. The alignment is now perfected by means of the sights, figures 2 and 4, on the top of the bar, which is merely shifted by hand, and not in any way clamped to the stands, as its weight is quite sufficient to secure stability; at the same time the position in distance is approximately so adjusted as to bring the perfecting of it within reach of the screw motion. In launching the bars backward or forward by hand, the operator should lift the contact end slightly off the trestle, while the assistant at the forward end, with his hand placed under the bar, merely take.s the weight of the bar off the trestle, leaving the operator free to move it either way, m· which he may be assi~ted by a slight swinging movement of the hand. Black bands are painted on the bars in the places where they ought to rest on the stands, figure 6, in order to call attention to any progressive error in placing the stands. The bars can be readily adjusted to a level by means of the sector, the wedges working with perfect smoothness, and it is always preferable to use them level, where the "nature of the groq.n4 permits. Considerable irregularities may be overcome by means of the stands deemibed, and for general changes of le,vel a vertical offset with a theodolite will be preferable to "P&ing the bars at,considerable slopes. ·Ji; . .

The apparatus was first used in May, 1855, in remeasuring a portion of Dauphine Island base, between marks that had been left in the original measurement with the compensating base apparatus. One hundred and eighty-nine bars, or nearly half a mile, were measured at the rate of a little over three minutes to the bar, and the distance agreed with that previously measured within two-tenths of an inch. .At that time the :mechanical arrangements ~f the trestle were imperfect. Since then several lines have been measured wi'th the apparatus as described in the report for 1856, and in November, 1857, a line of nearly four miles on the bank of the .Mississippi river, near 'the Balize, was measured with the apparatus as now described, at the average rate of 1. 7 minutes to a bar, the best time made being 230 bars in five successive hours.

Description of <kep-sro sounding apparatu8 invented by Commander B. F. Sand8, U. S. N., Assi.<itant in the Coast Survey.
The rod a a (sketch No. 70) is of half-inch round iron, about eighteen inches long, w:ith a swivel at the upper end for the lead line, and a sock~t at the lower end to receive the tenon of the specimen tube b, fastened by key c. Two wire rods f, about a foot in length, on each side of the rod, connect the flMige g of the specimen tube with a small band h around the rod, having two spurs pointing downwards. Surrounding the sounding rod are two semi-cylindrical weights of cast iron e e, grooved on the flat sides to receive the rod, and to allow the valve connecting rods to play freely between the weights. Holes of three-fourths of an inch diameter are drilled in their lower ends to receive the plugs d d that are hinged upon the ends of the key c, and which keep the weights in their seat ; and in their upper ends of one-fourth inch in diameter, to receive the small spurs of the band h which confine the upper ends of the weights to the sounding rod. In the act of the specimen tube piercing the bottom, the sliding valve of the tube is raised to admit the specimen, lifting also the band h connected with it. by the wire rods/ releasing the upper ends of the weights and causing them to fall free from the rod, leaving nothing but the rod and specimen tube to be brought on board. The upper portion of the sounding rod is flattened and pierced with two holes to allow the self-registering indicator to be clamped to it.

The device proposed has for its chief object to run sounding line's in 'harl:ior's anti water of moderate aepth.

of mercury made ai,r-tight, and from this cistern arrange a vertical glass column, open at the top, through which the mercury can rise to any height required by the pressure due to the depth. The mode of use would be thus : throw the weighted air vessel;,overboard and lot it sink to the bottom, being connected with the vessel by the air-tight tube, duly connected, in turn, with the barometric cistern. Let the boat or vessel be propelled on a course ; the air vessel win be dragged along the bottom, and, as the water must have free access to the bag inclosing the air, its pressure will compress the air to a density due to the depth. This pressure will be communicated along the tube to the vessel or boat, and, being received on the mercurial surface, will raise a column of such height that its weight will equal the weight of an equal column of the water. This column equals in height the depth to which the air-vessel is sunk, or, rather, that of the lowest part, on which the pressure acts. As this depth varies the height of the column will also vary. The relation of these heights is expressed by the specific gravity of mercury, divided by the specific gravity of the particular sea or other water in which the soundings are made. It would be necessary to make occasional observations with the hydrometer, and, in the case of tidal streams, these should be quite frequent. The following will give a general idea of the construction of the parts : The air vessel should be an easily flexible India rubber bag of the pear shape, with a tight neck screw on which to fasten the pipe. .A.round this bag a vear-shaped metal ca.se must be adjusted, of weight sufficient to sink the air vessel and connected tube rapidly. I suppose lead will be the best. The form is important, as it should be such as to offer but slight resistance in being drawn through the water. It would be best to throw a large preponderance of weight on one side of the swelled part, so as to make that side keep towards the bottom. The superior forward surface can then be so arranged as to bring into action a component acting downwards and due to the forward dragging. The India rubber bag should then be fastened to the lower part so as to compel it always to indicate the pressure corresponding to the same distance from the ground. The tube should, I suppose, be made of the common gas-pipe, (India rubber canvas patent,) the smallest bore being preferable. This tube must then be laid either with wire or fit1hing line of sufficient strength to bear the strain safely. By first laying lengthwise all around the tube a series of wires or twines, and then wrapping them all firmly, the strain of dragging would come almost wholly on the wires or twines, and yet the whole will be quite flexible. If a smaller size of flexible tube which will sufficiently resist inside pressures can be got it will be better ; for, as the pressure within will always exceed that from without, the arching stiffness is not ·required. As the wrapping will greatly strengthen the tube its sides may be of moderate thickness. I suppose the tube should be arranged at a number of points for fastening to the boat's or vessel's stern, so that the length out shall be always eamly seen, and I presume it · tube not payed out .is to be might very well b.e dragged at a slope of about one-fourth. All the eoiled be.tween the stern and the gauge. By loading the air vessel the slope at which the tube Qai;i, he di;a.gged may be. increase;d1 or as before indicated, by a head armatlJre or blade giving a QpWifW~rd component. .A.s the effect of the change of tu,be slope will he but slight on the hori· ~pl)taj 4!stance between the boat and the ~t vessel, the sounding, at a.D.Y instant, may be taken ~ bel9~; to a. qc>nstant disU!.nce astern for ea.ch of the bots or loops of the tube.

at once be seen how great an advantage this will give in dragging for bars or shoals along ehannel ways, to say nothing of other cases. The a~r tube is to open into a cistern, or basin, or syphon branch, connecting with the open glass indicator, or scale tube ; the whole to be gimbal mounted, and the tube to be led along tne gimbal axes. The graduation can be made differential, so as to always £how true inches of pressure. It would probably be, on the whole, quite as advantageous to have_merely a glass tube of say one foot long fastened on an India rubber tube and arranged to slide up and down on a scale, t.he flexible tube connecting with the fixed ciste~n. If great depths are attempted with this combination, this will be necessary. There would be some advantage in using an incompressible fluid in place of air, the small specific gravity of which might give a differential pressure. Thus, sulphuric ether has specific gravity= .715; absolute alcohol, =. 792; olive oil,= .915; whale oil,= .923; either of which, introduced into the tube and bag and resting on the mercury, would give a tolerable indication, or, if used as tho reading fluid witho_ut mercury, would be perhaps too sensitive. Sea water being of specific gravity= 1.026, we see that sulphuric ether will give over three feet on the scale for ten in depth, and whale oil just about one to ten. Linseed oil, specific gravity 940, would be more manageable; and turpentine, specific gravity 991, would, if its fluidity sufficed, be very good. Wine is '.992, and if it could be kept pure might do, though too little sensitive in fresh water. If we assume that one hundred feet is our limit of depth to he sounded, we can readily proceed from this to fix the size of air vessel required, if air is used, or the Jength of scale, in case any of the fluids named are used alone or with a mercurial reading column. There is the objection to these fluids, that the height of the zero level above the sea must be considered; but if air is used, this may be neglected. .A. careful study of the possible combinations will probably indicate substantial reasons for a preference. If air be used, the air vessel must be so Jarge that it will be supplied with air at the maximum depth anticipated; for which purpose the entire air space of the tube and ci1:1tern must bear a less ratio to that of the air vessel than one atmosphere of pressure does to the pressure due to the maximum depth in the densest water. The air space being fixed, the weight must. suffice to sink this readily; but as it goes down, the sinking power will increase, thus partly counteracting the lifting effect of propulsion on the sloping tube. If we assume a hundred feet as the maximum, and one-fourth as the slope, this tube must somewhat exceed four hundred feet, and the part out will be varied as the depth, though the whole will be in use as a connection at all times. These indications may suffice for the simple barometric form. There is, however, a far finer possibility which may be ultil!l-ately attained; that is, the making this arrangement self-registering. Suppose a sheet of paper made to traverse over a roUer either by spring't:lo~ work or by a mechanism moved by a screw propeller fixed to the side of the surveying vessel or boat. Then suppose a pencil point collll~cted with a float on the top of the mercurial column, and made to. traverse the recording roller as it rises or falls. This would trace a strictly proporlional record curve of the bottom dragged. JTatthis arrange· ment would be difficult and intri(·ate. Suppose, li:owever, that a light fluid-is used in the 'chamber of the drag, the tube and the cistern, and let this cistern be made of~ Ol" corrugated material of along cylindriealfonn; one head of the eyiinder beiDg'fixeil, and·the'ot~er acting against a spring.

I suppose spring clock work moving a record sheet might be combined with tLis corrugated cylinder, so as to give a record proportional to time without very great difficulty. But the moving of a sheet by a side p··opclJe:·, so thPt t.he f'..DsciBsus woJ.ld be proportional to the spaces traversed is very .much the mo··t dei;irnble form, anc ma,\' pos;;i\Jly uot present difficulties too formidable t.o be overcome. It would, do.ibtless, be best to experiment first with the barometric form, and if no unforeseen obstacles occl'r, tl'e greater u1Jject can tbea be maturely considered, and, if practicable, fully realized to the vast advantage of hydi·ography.

UNITED STATES SDRVEYIN"G STEAMER CORWIN,

Kew York, J..Yoz:cm"Uer 12, 1857. SIB : In accon]ance with your verbal instructions, I went yesterday, in company with Mr. J. M. Batchelder; to test the practical application of Hunt's somJrJing apparatus. The operation was performed in the dhmnel between the navy yaTd ancl the cob-dock in one of the sounding boats of this vessel, in depths var.y":1g from uue to four fdthoms. The main features of t~ie apparatus, as constructed by ~fr. Batchelder for these expe1·iments, are the efost.ic bc·g, ll10 c01rnecl.itJg tube, and the rmmome<er OT p!'es&ure indicator. The bag was made of India n 1 bber cloth, about eighteen by fourteen incbos, and, when blown up, t.hree inches in thickness. .A_ i:,crew thimble is inserl-ed at one end to receive the screw attached to the ImJia rubber tube. Tlrn lmg is placeJ in a tiu box, wifo suitable rings for attaching the drag rope, and at the fm ward end :m aperture th1·ougli which tho tube passes. The tube is half an inch in diameter, with a bore of one-eighth of an inch, and made in lengths of twelve feet each, which are joined by tubular couplings having n. collar on each end, half the length of the coupling being i111<e1·ted into each tube, the ends of which are firmly moulded upon the coupling with waxed thread. The tube and pressure gauge are connccte<, by means of a joint coupling with stop-cock, which is fitted to the end of the tube and scniwcd finnly to the pressure gauge, which is ope of those kuown as .Ashcroft's steam-gauge. It may be attached to the gunwale of the boat or held in the handR of the observer. 'l'he tin box was kept down by a weight of twenty-five pounds attached. The tube and drag rope were lashed together at intervals of eight or ten feet. By reference to the i.ccompanyin0 table, giving the soundings by lead and line, the pressure by the gauge, and the depths corresponding to i:he pressure, as taken from Mr. Batchelder' s computations, it will be readily seen t.hat thus far, at least, the invention is eminently successful. In no instance does the difference in the two readings amount to more than one foot, and this occurs but once in twelve times. This difference, however, is probably due to the somewhat precipitous character of the bottom. The indicator was found to be exceedingly sensitive, and at the same time to move without the slightest vibration. I am of opinion that several alterations may be yet necessary to render the apparatm: of practical value. The air chamber now in use is liable to rise when any headway is given to 61 e

the boat, although a weight of twenty-five pounds was attached to it. Perhaps a thirty-two pound shot and spherical India rubber air chamber, reduced as much as possible in size, would present fewer obstacles to a successful issue of the experiment than any other size or form. I would also suggest that the gauge now used as an indicator be graduated to express fathoms and feet, instead of pounds of pressure, and, if practicable, that it be so constructed as to admit of being laid in a boat with the face upward. The tube, also, sl10uld be so constructed as to be as little liable to injury as possible, and to serve as a drag rope. If then a force puihp be fitted for filling the air chamber, all the objections that have suggested themselves to me in the present apparatus would be obviated, and I am of opinion that in running lines of soundings for considerable distances, and in depths not exceeding three fathoms, with a soft or sandy bottom, it will be found very serviceable. I doubt, however, whether it can be used in its pTesent form for greater depths to advantage, or that it will be found to answer the purpose intended, if towed by a steamer at a greater rate of speed than is usually attained by one of our ordinary sounding boats.

APPENDIX No. 49DeBcription of tl1e tide-gauge devised by Lieutenant Commanding S. D. Trenchard, U. S. N., Assistant in the Ooast Survey.
This gauge (sketch No. 72) dispenses with the rod usually attached to the float, and substitutes in its place a varn~shed cotton belt about an inch and a half wide, which passes over 3 roller near the top of the gauge, and is kept tense by an attached weight working in a groove 3 in the back of the box. The back of the gauge is made of two pieces : one, an inch and quarter thick, with a groove in the front a half inch deep, and wide enough to admit of the

TUE UNITED STA.TES COA.ST SURVEY.

free motion of the'belt; over this is placed a board a half inch thick, which separates the groove from the float box, and keeps the former water-tight. One foot below the roller a slide workil in grooves in the sides of the box, in which is cut a hole a quarter of an inch wide and an inch and three-quarters long. This serves as an index for reading the rise and fall, as well as for keeping the belt in the middle of the box. A door opens from the top of the gauge to the slide, giving room for joining and dif'connecting the belt and float, and securing, when closed, the ·whole from the influence of the wind and spray. When it is desirable to place the gauge uuJer a wharf, the top can bo rerno>ed and the register taken from the belt as it passes over the ruller. Tho gauge may be used advantageouf'ly in observing the tides at a distanc-e from the shore. For this purpose a chain is attached to the float, passed over the roller, and joim; a wire which is led ashore over uprights, and to ·which is attached an index working along a stationm·y scale. The wire is passed over a pulley on Bhore, and a weiglrt attached to the end of it; for thiR purpose the float should be large and heavy.

Au.gust 28, 1857. DE.A.R Sm: During the past season I have, among other duties, made a trial of an apparatus for observing the rise and fall of the tide in deep water, and in situations exposed to heavy sea. · As my experiments proved entirely successful, I would respectfully offer for your inspection the accompanying drawing and description of the gauge. You haV"e frequently called my attention to the necessity of obtaining tidal observation on the open coast, in order that we may ascertain the form and cliaracter of the tide wave before it has submitted to the disturbances consequent upon its passage through irregular channels and into harbors. The necessity of this information in the computation of general prediction tables has been great. With the hope of meeting this want this gauge has teen arranged. General description.
A long pine spar, bolted at the foot, with a universal joint, to a block of stone, is lowered down to the bottqm of the sea. The portion above the surface of the water is slender, so as to be less affected by the wind; while the part near the bottom i.s large, in order to be a;; buoyant as possible. To the top of this spar, which projects some ten or fifteen feet above the water, is attached the rod of a heavy pendulum,. which slides over an arc five to eight feet below, and determines the inclination of tho spar. To this buoy, thus arranged, is fastened the gauge, which is a glass tube set into a graduated staff, and having a red glass bubble rising and falling within. By a small hole in this tube, some eight to ten feet below the surface of the sea, the water enters, upon which the bubble floats. The 9bserver records at once the height of the bubble and the angle of inclination of the gauge. The computer, with the aid of a table of natural cosines, readily reduces these observations to perpendicular heights.

DEAR

BR1sToL, R. I., Oetorer 10, 1857. Sm: The index of papers on subjects relating directly or indirectly to the various

operations of the Coast Survey has made considerable progress since my last report, though much less than I had hoped or desired. The total of volumes examined now amounts to about seven thousand, and the total number of titles to about thirty-five thousand. It will probably be desirable to add about a thousand volumes. more to the list examined before proceding to the classification of titles and the :final publication. It is due to myself to say that the almost continual demands on my time by my engineer duties at Fort .A.dams, Newport, R. I., and the chargft of the light-house eonstfnctions in Rhode Island, have left me but little time or mental energy to give to the protracted labors of this index, except such as I could find during the winter while ou.t..doO!' ·ork ·,,.. e11Spt1t1ded.

regret that I have reason to anticipate being deprived of this winter resource during the coming season, and that thus the completion of my index labors must again be put off by the exactions of other imperative duties. I shall not remit my efforts to reach an end at the earliest possible date. It cannot fail to be a source of gratification to you that the train of circumstance;;; in which originated my humble efforts towards forming the index in question, may prove to have been the fountl'.in source whence a general index of physical science is ere long to emanate. If so, it will not be among the least of the many benefits which the Coast "Survey has bestowe<l on the general cause of science, that a deliberate effort to supply its own necessities for full investigations has led to a like universal result. As you are already aware, I began my index gleanings in 1854, and was gradually led to clearer views, not only of the 09ast Survey needs, but of the general Tequirnment'i of physical science. This resulted in various conferences with Professor Henry and Profeflsor Tiaird, in which a free interchange of ideas took place, much to my advantage. I suppose it to have been a direct result of these interviews that Professor Henry addressed to the British .1L:sociation a proposal to prepare a general physicul index, and offering, in behalf of the Smithsonian Institution, to prepare a complete index of American papers, coming under this head. The original Smithsonian programme contemplated this general result, bnt then, for the first tiL e, was a positive step proposed. The British Association responded to this proposal by appointing a committee, which has cooperated with a like committee of the Royal Philosophical Society. Two reports have been made, proposing a plan agreeing in many featuref! with that explained in my _communication at the Providence meeting of the American Association, in August, 1855, (hereto appended) though the importunce of systematizing abbreviations, as explaiued in my communication read at the Albany meeting of the same body, (hereto appended,) appears not to be sufficiently realized by the British Association committee. I will not here enlarge on the prospects opened by the action of the Smithsonian Institution, British Association, and Royal Society, further than to express my earnest wish that the general result Ro much needed may be so fully attained that my own labors will be superseded before their completion, except for the direct uses of the Coast Survey. How long a labor must precede this consummation I so fully realize, that I do not look for a very speedy termination, and shall not permit the anticipation to abate my interest in finishing what I specifically undertook. From the prominence given to this index in t.he council report of the Liverpool meeting of the British Association, I am led to hope that a strong determination to meet this great requirement of scientific investigators is felt by those who are best situated for giving effect to their plans. I cannot close without expressing my obligations to Mr. Charles A. Schott, assistant in the Coast Survey, for his collaboration in the German series. As all the remaining labor bas actually been done by my own hands, I trust that those who are looking for the published index will esteem all the delays encountered as not unreasonable. Very respectfully, yours, &c.,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

On an index qf papers on snl{jects of mathematical and pfiysical science. Hunt, United States Corps of Engineers.*

By Lieutenant E. B.

The history of science exhibits a continual tendency towards specialization. Tho sphere of each laborer becomes more and more limited as the area of research is expanded and distributed into ·well defined specialities. The same thing is observable in ~cientific research, which, in the mechanical and chemical arts, is familiarized under the name of subdivision of labor. Thit same advantages and disadvantages of the specializing tendency are equally observable in the domains of science and of manufactures. The restriction of investigation and of industry to limited fields of exorcise has the effect to produce the highest skill within those fields, at tho price of narrowness of conception and privation of power concerning all other spheres of action and research. The man whose life is spent in heading pins._becomes almost preternaturally skilful in the manipulations of that manufacture ; but this man, in any other sphere of industry, is a blunderer and a bigot. So, too, the man of science who assiduously cultivates a chosen speciality becomes therein pre-eminent ; but, in so doing, he is in great danger of losing his grai;;p on those generalities which transcend his particular field, and of becoming not only impotent, but bigoted, relative to those branches of research whicn he has not pursued. As the microscopist restricts his field but intensifies his vision within that field, so the cultivation of a speciality withdram;; into a single study the diffused powers of the original mind. The microscopist and the specialist find the same difficulty in seeing the parts in their relations to the whole. No problem is more important to the scientific investigator than that of rightly co-ordinating his general and special culture. If generalization too largely prevail, his life ·will probably be exuberant, but fruitless. If a speciality absorbs all his powers, there will be abundance of ignoble and innutritious fruit. If he knows how properly to combine the general and the special, he is likely to bear such rich and lasting fruit as has made the names of Newton and Leibuitz, Euler and Lagrange, Cuvier and .Agassiz, and all of this illustrious kindred, such unfailing sources of strength. The power to generalize and the power to specialize must co-exist in the true magnate of science. Great things may be done by men strong in either, but not the greatest. Whoever neglects general culture, in his eager pursuit of the special, harms his own nature. It may be said that power in specialities can only thus be attained ; that specialist devotees are essential to the progress of science ; that science, like another Juggernaut, demands the sacrifice of the man himself to his chosen pursuit. Whoever thus reasons has already sacrificed his humanity to his speciality, and is but shouting the praises of Brahma. Nor is it easy to adopt a theory of scientific castes which would make the specialists a lower and necessary grade, whose business it is to gather materials for the generalizing noble to arrange in their true order around some latent principle which he alone is privileged to see. That some minds are. thus noble by nature and by training is certain enough ; but it is hard to believe that many who could be "of any assistance as specialists cannot also do some part, however small, as the generalizers of their own field and of its relations to others. · The p~esent age of science may, with great propriety, be called the morwgraphic age. We have reached that period when every subdivision of research needs to be presented in the· form of a monograph. While it is still possible for the student of any single subdivision to pursue

it in all the original papers treating thereon, it is quite impossible for the investigator of a
more extended area to study the contained and related subjects in their whole range of original papers. To him it is quite essential that the various subdivisions of research should each be digested, by thorough masters of their component confrihntions, and brought out in iheir orderly, well balanced proportion:;. The true, the proven, the mature, has need to he separated by adept rnonographers from the false, the speculative, and the crude. The contributions of many successive invm;tigators, each tending to place their common speciality on higher ground and to bring it out in more perfect definition, have all to bo digested by one who is qualified to take tho judicial point of view and to use aright the privilege of moderns, vd10, as Bacon says, are the ancients of knowledge. The model monograph is one "'hioh presents tho known, substantive facts of the subject, treated in their natural order and relations with all attaina11e clearneRR, completeness, a!l(l brevity, and which gives such an, insight into the nature of all original memoin; thereon as will enable investigators to recur to such originals as may be important for their special purposes. Already the mathematical and phy8ical sciences have hundreds of subjects needing to he monographed, while comµaratively few are yet so auequately presented under this form as not to need either a new monograph or a revision of tho old. The great number of investigatorn now at work; the late remarkable increase of periodical publications and memoirs devoted to scientific suLjects; the subdividing or fissiparous tendency of modern science, and its signal proclivity to annex fields of empirical practice, and make them rational or strictly scientific-these and other causes have thrown nearly all the provinces included within tho present domains of science into the precise condition to need tho services of well furniRhed monographers. An invaluable result of such a presentation of these subjects would be found in the aid which investigators would thus receive towardR keeping up their general scientific culture, without turning too much away from their specialities. Thero seems no possiLle way by which inYcstigators can maintain the general and the spe()ial in correct and harmonious relations, except by means of an ever increasing expansion of their monographic aids. As the realm of knowledge goes on yearly expanding, and steadily growing more and more to exceed the possible grasp of any one mind, this need of a direct and disembarrassed presentation of all positive results, state(J:, as far as possible, in the common language of science, will become continually more pressing. It will be only by the aid of monographs of various degrees of generality that the entire domain of science can henceforth be at all surveyed by any single investigator. The narrowest fields, being first duly digested into 111onographs, ·will furnish the materials for monographs of higher generality; and from these, step by step, the ascent will be to that universal monograph which shall draw within its compass all the high generalities of the great epic cosmos in which science will attain its far off final consummation. When physical science becomes thus organized and digested, we shall no longer be constrained to behold the ardent mind borne :way by generalizing speculations beyond all basis of fact, or the far more revolting arid mind cramped within a petty speciality and disdainfully ign:iring all the vast domain of vital generalities, simply because it tram1cends its own dwarfed and grovelling eomprehem1ion. The only worthy type of scientific mind is that which at the samtl time pursue" g-enernl and special truth; which can see _grand generalities underlying the minutest phenomena, and

408.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

which can trace in the loftiest generalities the simple convergence of an infinite series of kindred special phenomena. The entire character of the active investigating mind of the coming generation wm be much influenced by this monographic tendency and need. The extent to which we shall digest into consistent wholes ·the now dispersed and fragmentary materials on a long array of subjects in mathematical and physical science will almost measure the prospective prevalence of that just union of the generalizing and the specializing powers whence alone can spring a trne progress in scientific philosophy. The views now presented are essential preliminaries to a full understanding of the bearings and workings of an index of papers on mathematical and physical science. This subject ia one which the naturalists have better appreciated than the mathematicians and physicists. The proof of this will be seen in that laborious work which the genius. of Agassiz inaugurated, and which presents, in four octavo volumes, the titles of all known papers. on natural history and geology up to its date. These titles are arranged alphabetically, under the names of their authors, as is probably most convenient in the departments included. Natural history and geology, being esse11tially descriptive sciences, are less fitted for the classification of the su1Jjects included than the more abstract or logical mathematical and physical sciences. A logical arrangement of subjects, at least for natural history, will scarcely now be proposed by those interested; though it is possible that Englemann' s Bibliography of Natural History, which distributes authors alphabetical1y under a limited number of general beads, may yat serve as a model for indexing papers or memoirs in the same field. In proceeding to examine somewhat the subject of an index of all original papers in mathematics and physics, it may be well briefly to state the circumstances which have led me to consider it. As an assistant in the Coast Survey, I had, on several occasions, to make special investigations, in whic:h it was desirable to examine all good relevant authorities and original memoirs. How to do this was the question. To range over series after series, index after index, from be~inning to end, would surely bring to light all such papers. But this is a labor of truly appalling magnitude, and not to be thought of for each minor research. It only remained to start with such papers as I chanced to know of, or could find by tho few indexes of series at my command. Then, following up all the references which could be gleaned from theBe sources, I could go on till they were exhausted. By that time any man of moderate patience would himself be exhausted and indisposed to beat up for further game. Yet what guaranty is there in this process that the very best papers may not entirely escape one's knowledge? I found, from experience, just this result; nor do I suppose that any person can be sure of having examined all those printed papers, on a given subject of physical science, which are essential to a full comprehension of its history and development. He may find a vast deal more than he likes to read, and yet leave the best of all unknown. This is peculiarly true of those just entering on a career of research. Veterans bear in their memories some traces of the leading papers published during their lifetimes on all subjects ever likely to enlist their activity. But the neophyte has no such aid, and does not even know how to get at the most accessible memoirs. A great loss of time, in turning over leaves for the want of specific references, is common alike to young and old. Thus, for instance, when I wished to find all the publishe<l descriptions of automatic tide gaugei;, I spent a gr{lat deal of time to find what could be read in five minutes, and am by no means confident that I have

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

409

seen the best description of the best foreign gauge. Every person's experience must abound in such illustrations. I did not many times repeat this experience of time sacrifice before seeing the advantage of making this search for materials a general one, and so, once for all, mustering the forces which were likely to be needed, I was thus led to form the plan of a systematic examination of all the principal series of scientific memoirs and periodicals, for the purpose of extracting such titles of papers as I judged proper for a Rpecial index on subjects directly related to the various Coast Survey operations. This project met the hearty approval of the Superintendent, who has doubtless experienced its need more than :my other person. He authorized my proceeding with its execution, and has furnished every encouragement. l have alread;.' examined considerably over one thousand volumes of memoirs, transactions, scientific periodicals, &c., and it is my expectation to advance this index so far as to permit its being included in the Coast Survey Report of this year as an appendix. It will be impossible for rne to exhaust the field, but, fortunately, a supplement can, at any time, be added, with the contributions of succeeding years, in which omissions from the first index may be supplied. This index will be arranged by means of a detailed classification under subjects, and will embrace various heads of interest to cultivatora of physical science at large. Though the principle of selection is that of probable use in the Coast Survey operations, the ground covered will be of considerable extent. Such a fragment alone, though rather laborious, I should not think worthy to bring before this Association, were it not that it has served to indicate a far more catholic plan, and one which, if executed, will prove a signal benefaction to all cultivators of mathematical and physical science. This plan is simply an extension of the one already defined, so as to arrange in one general repository all titles of papers on mathematical and ph3~sical science. The ground unoccupied by the index of Agassiz and his collaborators should all be included, so as to aggregate in the two works references to all scientific researches. Engineering, machines, chemical, mechanical, and artistic technology, would be invaluable additions, and should, if possible, all be embraced. .A.11 these titles, being duly extracted, and, when necessary, annotated, would admit of classification into several volumes, each containing a connected group of subjects, so that every investigator would find most of the references he would need in a single volume. It was to somewhat such a shape that this plan reduced itself when I came to confer with Professor Henry and Professor Baird, of the Smithsonia11 Institution. In the programme of objects proposed to be accomplished by that institution is inclu,.ded a project of this very character. Professor Henry, having, as he declares, found particular advantages from using the Mathematical and Physical Index arranged by that clear-minded philosopher Dr. Th-0mas Young, on a somewhat similar idea, was not likely to forget this among plans for the !ncrease and diffusion of knowledge. It is, indeed, a plan for rendering accessible the kno'wledge already recorded, and, as such, eminently deserves the aid of that institution. Were · tJ:ie Work" done, and well done, the inRtitution would undoubtedly undertake its publication.

But done it is not, and the question.is how to accomplish its proper execution. Could I have eommanded my Q.Wll. tilne, the performance of this task would have been a congenial labor. ln S!Jite of that ph~oa.riousness of station which is my professional prerogative, I was much in()ti~i to. thi.i!i undemking, and probably should hitve begun it had not the assignment ~pte:,~ie duties nmde it sim~le'1'ollyto venture· it.

obliged to forego this expectation, and have brought the subject here in the hope that some one, more favored by circnmstances, may be induced to undertake so needful an enterprise. I will gladly lend any aid in my pmver to any one who is both fit and willing thus to work for the good of science. Hovv far assistance and compensation might be allowed by the Smithsonian Institution in the execution of this plan is, of course, not for me to say. From the real value of the prnposcd wo;k, and the interest felt by the Smith;.;onian officers in its accomplishment, it is fair to infer that no reasonable aid would be denied which the means of the instihition "'ou1d authorize. Its valuable collection of memoirs and transactions would be of peculiar value in this connexion. There is one excellent suggestion for which I am indebted to Professor Baird, this is, that an index of American scientific papers would be a usefql and proper beginning for such an undertaking. Tho exceedingly scattered and anomalous vehicles through which American investigations have reached the present time "\Yill make this portion of the search rather peculiar, and it is on this account much more needful. In truth, we do not know the real wealth of our own science, especially those of us who are young in such pursuits. Europe, too, is in a state of deplorable ignorance relative to our investigations, an ignorance which has considerable excuse, too; for how can "'e expect foreigners to ferret our science from Patent Office or Coast Survey reports, or other public documents, Regents' reports, Stafo legislative documents, or, indeed, from any except tlie standard journals and the vo1umeR of memoirs. Thus, there a.re very good reasons for an .American index as preliminary to a general one, with which it could be regularly incorporated. The work now proposed is certainly one of great labor. It will require severaf years' time and an examination of various libraries for its completion. Our own libraries will not offer all the materials needed for its completeness. English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Hungarian, Russian, Swedish, and Latin series will need to be ransacked before the work is finished. .A. delicate exercise of judgment in accepting or rejecting titles will be required. There will be sundry questions such as these: ShaH any anonymous papers ho included? Shall papers in the literary magazines be selected? Shall titles be given in full and literally, or cut dOivn, modernized, translated, or annotated? Shall translations be included? Shall reprints into more accessible series be referred to? &c. It has been my practice to include the date iu each title, and to give the limiting pages of each memoir as an indication of the fullness Fith which its subject is treated. The labor of classification will be one demanding a truly cosmopolite mind. Rightly to distribute the hundreds of subjects, and always to maintain tho truly logical catena of succes· sion, will require a broad power of appreciation such as few possess. Many plans of classification might be devised, and each having some advantages; but whatever system is adopted, an alphabetical index of subjects would make it easy of practical use. This study of classification would of itself be a most valuable research; for I am confident that any abstract or a priori plan would find the materials somewhat refractory, and thus would undergo modification and amplification. The general alphabetical arrangement of titles by authors' names would, I think, be quite unfit for this case. The greatest benefit of the whole :plan would be in its hripging together references to all which has been written on each subject, and thus ~t once giving a clue to all the materials for perfect monographs. It iti, of far ,lea importance in

mathematics and physics to know the who than the what; but both can be sufficiently known by alphabetical arrangement of authors under subjects, and hy an index of authors' names ·with references to all the subjects under which each ha;; title,;. Thus all the papers of any author and all the papen~ on any subject may be directly found. I need not further enlarge on this plan. Should there be any one who has capacity and courage to undertake the great enterprise indicated, further hints would be superfluous for him. Should there he several who are willing to associate their laliors, each taking certain serief', and so together exploring the whole, it will not be difficult to concert a general plan. 'I'lie greatest difficulty of snch an aRsociation would be in securing thorough coi.ipcration and uniform execution. The means of classification would, of couree, be by movable slip>o, and thus most · incongruities of plan would be avoided by making the claseifi:cation the work of one. When we look at an individual labor so valuable as Poole's Index of Periodical Literature, we cannot doubt that the labor now proposed is destined ere long to enlist far greater industry and talent, and that, if seriously undertaken, it must succeed. Dr. Young" s Index, contained in the volumes of his works, would afford valuable aid towards conceiving the plan, though it is very far from perfect and of too old a date to permit the continuance of its classification without much change. The proposed index seems to be one of those undertakings which the current of events ·will render too indispensable not to be ore long begun. If so extended as to embrace engineering, machines, and the technology of arts and ma!lufactures, (chemistry, in all its applications, would, of course, be included,) it will become sufficiently valuable to many practical interests to enlist their active support. Our Patent Office might well afford to defray aI~e cm;t of such a work in those departments over which examinations for patents ·are required to be made. If for a moment we conceive the result attained, and the entire compass of reference to mathematical and physical papers brought into a systematic body under specific subjectheadings, we shall better realize its value. The course of investigation on any particular subject would be made simple and direct. By yearly supplements we might he kept informed of new papers beyond our ordinary range. The investigator would proceed to exhaust all the papers of value on any subject in hand, and would. know when he was done; thus he would start thoroughly furnished for making additions to existing knowledge, instead of ''.:asting his strength on work already done. The preparation of a monograph would :uo long·er involve a chartlcss roaming over a boundless sea, but our materials could be used in certainty of their completeness, and.in such succession as our convenience might dictate. Monographs thus made easy could not fail to cover field after field with unprecedented completeness and facility. "\Yo should, in each branch, he soon furnished with that clear synoptic presentation of all its important elements and results which would enable us to give each speciality itR true value aud relationi,i on the general chart of scientific coordination. Our general views would keep paco with our ~pecial investigations, and our mind::< would attain tlrnt harmony of culture charadcristic of the well developed man. A.like versed in those graml generalities which form tbo groundwork of creation, and practiced in the study of our chosen fields of re,;earch, wn <'iwuld steer clear of fruitless speculation and of the bigotry of petty kuo\\ ledge. Such would lie the ten~(mcies of the work proposed. What now rnmains is simply to do it, aud for this 1wthi11g is wanting but the man or men. The benefit is for science among all nations. The benefoc·

tor's reward will be a truly honorable distinction, and a consciousness of usefulness such as few living men can rightly claim. When we remember how the mighty dead and .the honored living have given record to their best thoughts, in hope that the world would not willingly let them die, it becomes in us a deed of pious duty to retrace and render legible the inscriptions on these too neglected record tablets.

Letter qf Lieutenant E. B. Hunt, United State.-s Corps ef Engineers, to Prefessor A. D. Bache, Superintendent United States Ooa.st Snrvey. *
In preparing, under your direction, an index of the titles of papers on subjects involved in the operations of the Coast Survey, gathered from all the scientific periodicals, transactions, memoirs, &c., to which I can obtain access, one unanticipated difficulty has again and again perplexed me. EvBry title which I take out must contain an abbreviation of the title of the work from \d1ich it is taken ; hence I have been obliged to write many thousands of these abLreviation8 while gathering the materials for this Coast Survey Index. It is, therefore, a matter of considerable moment that these abbreviations should be as brief as possible, while serving their primary purpose. The special difficulty to which I refer is, that there is no authentic code of abbreviations in general lrne, and that many of those particular forms which I have encountered are long, unwieldy, indeterminate, and conflicting. In many instances I have to coin abbreviations, and in many others there are insuperable objections to such as are now more or less in vogue. This subject is more important thrm it might at first appear i for these abb;:eviat9s are not only written and priuted thousands of times each year, but every cultivator of science must, as a part of his special training, become familiar with the abbreviations which concern his own departments of research, as a kind o(special alphabet. Hence the abbreviated forms ought to be as short as possible, without losing distinctness, to save needless writing and memorizing. This ~will be better appreciated when we Lear in mind that the list of Agassiz and Strickland contains one thousand two hundred and eighty-four titles of acts, journals, and collections of papers on zoolog-y and geology alone, without being complete, even on those subjects ; while each of these titles must probably have one or more abbreviations in use. We ought not to forget that we are even now but at the beginning of scientific expansion, and that each succeeding year is bringing into being accessions to tho long array of scientific records. It is therefore of the greatest prospective importance that principles for abbreviating titles should now be settled, and that practice Rhould as rapidly as possible be brought to a uniformity based on these principles. In 1856 ·we sboul<l boar in mincl that the year 2000 is to come, aud that then tho records of science will be found under at least a myriad of Heparatc periodical titles, and each series will contain matters for future reference, just as we now refer to the various early series of transaction;; for the invci'ltigation;,; of our predecessors. The results, on being aggregated, would doubtless make it proper subject for publication by the SmithsoniiB.n Institu_ tion. It seems to me that some plan of this general character would be feasible. Should the American AR:,:ociation share this impression, it is in its power to initiate the measure, and test its practicability with no fear of bad results. The demand of comi.ng generations will be for freedom of memory, and our duty is to make their mnemonic burdens a minimum.

This chaotic diversity is common to nearly all abbreviations in the above cited works, whero they must have received rather special deliberation ; and by referring to individual modifications, by separate investigators, .a perfect Babel of usage ·will be found. That this is a real evil, I assume none will question. Can it be corrected, is a question on which different opinions will probably be found to exist. Certainly, correction cannot come without some effort, and without the aid of time. There is time enough ; there ought to be effort enough. Things cannot be worse, for there is now nothing fixed. Conservatism has uothing to fear in thi!'i instance. It has occurred to me as a plan which would stand a respectable chance of 1mccess, for tlw American .A.ssociatfon to initiate' a reform by consigning the subject to a special committee ftwith instructions to invite, in behalf of the Association, the cooperation of other countries concerning their own periodicals, &c. Thus, for instance, the American Association might. fix

414

REPORT OF THE SUPEBJNT·ENDENT OF

such abbreviations for all American scientific issues. It might, by correspondence, invite the cooperation of the British Association, or Philosophical Society for British periodicals, &c. Some principles of abbnn'iation might here be elaborated, but I shall only say, in brief, 1st. That abbreviations should be as brief as possible, without becoming obscure. The motto should be "abbreviations that are abbreviations." 2d. Only the leading characteristic words of a title should find place in an abbreviation. Connecting particles should be thrown out. The possessive or genitive form, which is by far the most frequent, can be easily disposed of by using the apostrophe or possessive flign for qf or of the, thus: .Am. J.' Sci.-J. ' Soc. ' Arts. 3d. Cerb1in words of very frequent occurrence should be reduced to their initial as an abbreviation, as J. for Journal, 1£. for Memoirs, N. for New, Nouvelle, Nuovo, Neue, Nova; others to two initials, as Ph. for Philosophical, Tr. for Transactions, An. for .Annals, Ac. for Academy, &c. In general, the abbreviation for the same word, when frequently occurring, should be constant, and a practical minimum in all combinations, and, when posi;:ible, the same in different languages. 4th. Location should, as a general rule, enter each abbreviation in some form, as M.' Ac.' Par., for the Paris Academy Memoirs; Am. Ph. Tr., ~<imerican Philosophical Transactions. These hints will suffice to show that there are principles in this matter which should be carefully elaborated and weighed. It may be that tlrn coinage of abbreviations under compulsion, which has fallen to my lot, leads me. to attach an undue importance to the subject ; but I am confident that a like experience would make most per;;;onR quite a8 dc8irou8 of seeing an estalJlished c.ode ef ahbre:lJiatiori.s for cill the world as I have Lecome.

CAMBRIDGE, MA.SS., November 10, 1857. Sm : In the letter dated Washington, March 1, 1855, which I had the honor of address· ing to you, and in which I announced that I had tried my best in composing the work relating to the orthography of names, the history of discovery, and the chartograpby of the Western Cnast of the United States, the execution of which you had the kindness to confide to me, I took tho liberty of stating that in the progress of that work, I felt the want of a coroprehen· sive hydrographic dm;cription of this coast, and how desfrablc and useful it would be to com· binc suc11 a description with the results of my historical researches. You declared that my proposition on this subject foll in exactly with your -0wn views, and you had the kindness to request me to undertake also the difficult task of1 embodying in rny ~vork "a full and complete account of the liydrography of the Western Coast and ite configura· tion . with details respt;icting the size, figure, and nature of its varions SBCtions and subdivisions, DEAR

bays, gulfs, inlets, harbors, rivers, entrances, capes, rocks, banks, shoals and cm-rents, pre'valent winds, and other phenomena of general intmest for maritime history and navigation." .A.nd in doing so, at the same time to make in the work itself the changes which might become necessary in consequence of the development and enlargement of its plan. vVe agreed, further, upon certain other changes to be adopted in the plan of the work. The researcher;: upon the origin and orthography of the names, to which in my former 'vork a separate chapter or division had been devoted, were now to be connected with the hydrographic deseription. The literary authorities and sources of information from which in my former work I had tried to make special catalogues of books and maps, were now to be connected with the body of tho work itself, so that every division of the work, every point discrn;sed, every expedition reported on, &c., should have its literary references near to it. In fact, the whole_"plan of our work in dimini8hing the division was more simplified and made more practical, and it became at the same time possible to conde11se more matter m a smaller comparative compass. In entering with my researches deeper into the peculiarities of the hydrog:raphy of the coast, I amended, in many cases, my historical results ; they became clearer and more precise. I gained much new light, and I soon found it neces;mry to go over the ground again and reconstruct the whole. From thi.s has grown an entirely new work, which, after having completed, I have now the satisfaction of laying before you, and in so doing, I express a mode,;t hope that. it will gratify you and the classes of your great nation which take a particular interest in this subject. Being invited to undertake this work by you, the chief of that most :important branch of civil administration, the hydrographic survey of the coasts, I had in view, first of all, the interests of your office and its members, the many distinguished officers who are connected with it, and to whom I wish.ed to become, in some respect, useful by m;· investigationR. Your operations spread now over a vast extent of many thousand miles of coast, and all that in former times has happened upon those coasts lrns a special interest in such a connection. The Cortes, the Cabots, the lfalaspinas, the Yancouvcrs, and all the other old navigators, who, with sometimes very insufficient means, tried to find out the secrets of these coasts, may in a certain manner be called the predecessors of yourself and the United States officers who operate now on the same field of action with the most perfect instruments and the most ample means which the arts and sciences of the nineteenth century and a rich and powerful nation can afford for the work. But the history of your department, or what might be called the earlier records of your office, comprise a great part of the whole maritime history of this country, and this maritime history of the United States includes a large portion of the entire political history of tho nation, as referred to its true Atlantic origin. The history of discovery and maritime enterprise forms, as it were, its very basis and foundation. The noble work of discovery, exploration, and surveying, very naturally has become, wo venture t-0 say, one of the favorite occupations of the nation.

but also the inland population, who look back to the shore where their forefathers landed, and from which they trace their descent. To know, therefore, what brought these remarlrnb]e shores at first into notice; by what extraordinary and repeated undertakings the physiognomy of this shore-line of the country was first traced out ; to observe how tho progress of arts and sciences made the results of these exertions from age to age more satisfactory; and to inquire how this work, which was commenced four centuries ago, stands at the present day by exertions which have tended to make the shore-line and all its extensive approaches and dependenc1es continually more accurate and more applicable to the uses of commerce, navigation, and other great interests ;-all thef'le matters, and others connected with them, may ·well occupy thinking minds in this country ; and a work which essays to treat of them may.expect to find ;:;ome favor and perhaps, even if it comes not quite up to its desired mark, a benevolent reception. Having, therefore, in view, during the composition of my work, as the public to which it might bo serviceable, if not exclusively professional men, at least the great classes of serious thinking and intelligent readers, I excluded from it all that might be called merely entertain· ing. I admitted nothing but what appeared to me to be to the purpose. Little attention has been given to embellishment, but I have tried to make it speak for itself in the development of the events and matters themselves. These I tried to bring forward in a simple and clear way, and arranged them in a manner and after a plan which offered itself to me as the most useful and prnctical. To this latter point, the plan and arrangement of the work in queRtion, I beg leave to refer more particularly. I have brought the whole matter under the following four principal heads or divisions: I. Introductory remarks. II. General sketch of the history of the Western Coast. III. Special hydrographic and historical description. IV. Appendages and illustrations. Each of these divisions will be briefly described.

I. General remarks on the physiool,froturcs qf tlte Western Coast qf the Unitea States.
Before I could enter into any detail of the history or hydrography of the coast, it was necessary to give a distinct idea of the ex.tent and limits of the section of the world on which I was to treat, and, further, to give a general view of the nature, aspects, trending, configuration, and tendency, of the principal physical phenomena characteristic of it. By the prevalent winds and currents of our coast, by its trending and configuration, by the distribution of headlands, bays, and rivers on it, all the navigators who have come to it have been influenced, directed, helped along, or retarded in th.eir operations nearly'in the same way. To point out such physical features in advan~e would serve very much to set us right at once with respect to the principal points to be taken into consideration. It would save us, in the sequel of our historical developments, much repetition, and would spare us. the necessity of interrupting th.e thread of our histOTical narrative by ex:pl~na.tions and diseussions on physical subjects. It would be desirable, before attempting a histnry at &U, to ha-ve iJefol"e

This introduction i:s c01tfi11ed excb,,:ively to the purpose of illustruti11g maritime ltistor.Y; I therefore touk intu l'Onsi<l.eratiou ouly tltuse objects and features which had special interest for the naYigator, the topographer, and hydrographer, and which were to he kept principally in vie,,- h;v the historian of nautical affair"1. The mariner looks upon all the numercn1" object" whicl1 a coast offers from l1is Offll point of view, and those which he at all think::> worth con,,;ideration are comparatiYely fow. Of all tho rich and manifold productions of vegetation ho seldom takes notice, except "·hell Hw:~ appear iJJ the shape of large treei,; 13tandillf2; on a hi;,!;h JJosition, and which he cau use in taking his bearings.

"\Yhether tho mountains contain gold or silver, or are of ''primary.'' ''secondary,'· or any other formation, he does not inquire; he knows them only by their shape, as laudmarkr:<, and asks only after their height aud at what distance they may 110 seen from the mastLcad.

The winds and fogs, the rainy ancl dry seasons, and other meteorological phenomena 8ttract the peteuliar attention of the mariner, the h)-drographer, and maritime liistoriaii, only so far as they move on the waters along the cou::;t line. \\'hat seal"ons may gon!rn beyond that lim~ ; ·what haib or drought may destroy tlrn harvests of the farmer; "·1rnt rains may fertilize his :fields, and many other questions of thi,; sort, have for them no i<pecial conseque1we . .As I have adopted the stand-point of tho rmvigator, and writt"'n the introductory chapter in question only >vith re;:;pcct to the wants of t110se who move along the coast, it may easily be conceived how little the naturalist will find in it.

The short paragravh on the phy3ical chang-es during the historic:al period ,,·hich 1 have appended to the introduction will, I l1ope, be found not misplaced. 'l'hat there have 1-1een
during the progress of discovery many physical changes, should be well remembered before tracing this progress itself, and the place8 in which changes have occurred should be pointed out at once; some parts of the historical accounts might not otherwise be intelligiule. There are localities on our coasts where, in former times, ships could anchor or sail, and where to do so now is impossible ; and, on the contrary, there are some harboi·s which we now enter moni freely and with greater draught than formerly. ·we must keep tliis constantly in mind, or we should run the risk sometimes of refusing to old accounts that credit which they deserve.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Some authors have traced the progressive march of at least some branches of the North American aborigines, (Aztecs, Toltees, and other conquerorn of :Mexico,) from the far northwest, through our coast regions to the southward; have attempted to settle the chronology of their progress, to point out the stations or pauses of their wanderings, and to give us some hints about the names and geography which they introduced into the country north of Mexico. Others have believed that also the Chinese, at one period, discovered and reached our coast, and that they even settled there, and had names for the countries. . Taking it for granted that we should investigate only the hi<itory of the present system of geography and navigation, commenced by the nations, mariners, and explorers of European descent, I commenced the historical memoir with the time of the discovery of America by the Spaniards, and excluded all the speculations on the ages previous to that event. There are, also however, cases in which these European explorers have travelled, so to say, on old Indian trails ; have been directed in their operations by Indian report and guidance, and have adopted into their geography a part of that knowledge acquired of the aborigines. Nay, sometimes even those speculations on Chinese discoveries have had some influence upon their movements and proceedings. In such caRe I have occasionally alluded to the fact, pointed out the manner in which European navigators were helped along by foreign tribes, or were checked, and misdirected, and tried to determine the degree to which they admitted into their own geography that of the Indians. For the most part, I have strictly and exclusively kept in view the boundaries of the United States coast as the limits of my field of research. What passed beyond those limits I have therefore disregarded. When a great circumnavigator of the globe has appeared on the waters, I have traced his course only from tl:ie moment when he turned his keel to our coast, or got it in sight, and I have left him at the place where he left us. This could be done, however, only to a certain degree. Our section of the coast is like a stone embodied in the entire structure of the whole Western coast of North America. It has shared with it in many respects the same vicissitudes, and has profited with it by the same exertions. Many astronomical observations, for instance, made in the north and south, have influenced ideas in regard to the position of our coast. When Abbe Chappe, for the first time, accurately determined the longitude of Cape Lucas, he fastened, so to speak, the wavedng and movable coast line of the old maps, which thus acquired certainty throughout its whole extent. It would be a gross omission not to consider Abbe Chappe' s expedition and operations as forming a part of the hydrographic history of our coast, which was so much affected by it. The cosmographical ideas connected with the search after a northwest passage have not only modified in a great measure the views which geographers, at different times, formed of our coast, but they have also, in a high degree, assisted and furthered its discovery and development. It would be impossible, in a history of the Wes tern Coast of the United States, not to allude to these ''northwest passage'' expeditions, and to keep their influence in view. Numerous similar instances might be pointed out of cases in which we ought to look beyond the strict limits of our narrow field of research. It is, however, impossible to give general rules in reference to this point. How far we ought to enter in each case into the history of distant events depends partly upon the degree of importance of the case itself, and partly upon

the size of the work which we devote to our object. In a book like ours, restricted to narrow limits, only brief allusions generally could be made to them. In a large work we might havP extended onr scope of view, and might have drawn more matter into our circle, fur it i,; e·ident that such a circle is of a very expansive nature. One might say that nothing has taken place throughout the whole extent of the vast Pacific which had not some influence upon the geography of our coast; and again, that nothing has happened beyond the Rocky mountains which could not be shown as having been, to a certain degree, in connection with it. Tho Pacific coast of Mexico, and that of the isthmus, which forms a comparatively narrow bridge between North and South America, were at several points firt't reached and explored by land expeditions from the European colonies on the Eastern Coast. But our Western Coast, being separated from the Eastern regions where Europeans first landed by a Yast breadth of continent, was first reached by water. For more than two and a half centuries we read exclusively of maritime expeditions skirting along these shores. In the latter part of the eighteenth , century the coast was connected ·with other European settlements in America, alt<o by lancl expeditious ; and duriug the pre!"ent century the whole broad continent of North .Americ-a has been traversed, and the shore has been reached repeatedly by exploring expeditions from the interior, though until very recently the most important operations in this way were conducted from the water side. We have, therefore, throughout the whole course of our investigation, principally to deal with maritime expeditions, not only from the nature of our subject, which is maritime history, but also from the peculiar nature and position of the coast, which could not easily be reached from the opposite side of the continent. To a certain degree >Ye must also pay attention to those land expeditions, and include them so far as they bear upon the object of our history. The mariner and hydrographer deri;e valuable assistance and information from the land traveller; the latitudes and longitudes to which the latter, by carrying his series of observations through the interior of the country from a distant, well-established point, has arrived, may be used by the former to compare with and correct his own observations . The traveller names and measures for the mariner thf' heights of the mountains and other objects which the latte?l!llllses as beacons and landmarks; he explore,; for him tlie diRtant heads of the rivers, their nature, length, climate, freshets, &c., and shows to him their value and importance, and .the causes of the phenomena by ·which the sailor is struck and influenced at their mouth. Many voyages have been made in connection with simultaneous land expeditions, and their proceedings and results have been combim1d. The sailor himself sometimes leaves his pitching vessel and becomes a wanderer, making travelling excursions to the interior. It is hence obvious that, though maritime exploration is our principal object, we were obliged to keep always in view what was transpiring on the adjacent land ; this, however, could only be done to a certain extent. Of the naval expeditions I have tried to give a complete account, including them all, but have reported only on those among the land explorations which reached the coast, and which had some marked influence on the progress of hydrographic knowledge. In brief, I pointed out their commencement and direction ; somewhat more minutely traced the circumstances under which they discovered the sources of the coast rivers, or the tops of mountains in view from the coast ; more attention was paid_ to them from the time they reached

tide water ; and when they got the ocean itself in sight, and wandered along its shores, I tried to accompany them with nearly the same solicitude as the navigators themselves, and have given them a full investigation. Even by water our coast was not easily accessible to the European navigators ; it may be said to have been for them the very ultima thule of .America; from Europe directly it could only be reached by a circumnavigation of the whole . .American continent around Cape Horn. On this route nearly every other coast section of this continent would be seen previously, our coast being almost the very extremity of the track. The Spanish enterpri;:;es commenced in the central parts of .America and diverged from tben0e towards the south and north-at first along the eastern coasts, somewhat later along the western, and 1atcst of all to the northwestern regions. The extremities of the southwestern radius towards Peru and Chili, after the discovery of Magellan's Strait, were soon reached and received light from two sides. In consequence of that discovery, they soon became principal stations on the great oceanic route round the globe. Every circumnavigator touched the southwestern,. while the northwestern radius ended in darkness and uncertainty. For a long time our coast thus lay far off from the great route of navigation, and was only now and then seen by a stray wanderer on the waters. The Portuguese, on their advancement around Africa and ;:;outhern Asia to the East, would be, of course, the very last to arrive there, and the Russians, in their march through Siberia to our region of the northwest coast, failed in their efforts to make extended settlements. At an early date they became acquainted with the more northern peninsulas and headlands of America, while our coast, intervening between their northern fur-hunting grounds and Spanish Central America, remained to them for a long time a terra inco.gnita. We dare say that on the whole globe there is no spot' watered by the ocean which has been so completely passed by in the travelling and colonizing movements of the European nations as our Western Coast sections. The history of its exploration derives some prominent features from the peculiar situation of the coast. It does not run on, like the history of some other parts of .America, smoothly from a point of commencement. Its ,progress cannot be compared to the tfrowth of a river, which commences with a little stream, and the course of which we can follow along an uninterrupted line to its swelling mouth ; we shall, on the contrary, have to travel over very bad roads, and we shall find long periods of time in which the march of history comes to a stand still, and nothing appears to have been done. The exploration was repeatedly tried and repeatedly left off; sometimes it seems to be in good progress, but new impediments arise, and it is stopped again. In their first enthusiasm of enterprise, and full of hopes of :finding something strikingly rich, the Spaniards, of the time of Cortez, reached pretty high latitudes on the northwestern track ; Cabrillo, as early as 1543, doubled Cape Mendocino ; but not iinding their expectations realized, they did not re-turn, and ·cabrillo' s Cape Mendocino stood on the Spanish maps where he put it, for ·more than. sixty years, as a fabulous ne plus ultra, never to be reached again. The Englishman, Drake, an extraordinary Ulan, upon a most adventurous voyage, ranged for a great distance along our coast, and fixed upon it the English name of New Albion. But this English country, which he laid down on the English ·maps o-f ilhe'l!e: regiom, stood there
~

421

only like the superstructure of an unfinished building, soon to be overgrown with the moss of oblivion. For nearly two hundred years people in England spoke of New Albion as the Romans once spoke of Taprobane or Thule, but no other English navigator, before the time of Cook, came in sight. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Spaniards appeared to be willing to commence another series of northwestern explorations ; one of their best navigators, Sebastian Vizcaino, set out on the track of Cabrillo, made an extensive survey of the coast, passed even a little distance beyond the ne plus Ultra of his old predecessor and was inclined to organize a second expedition, but he was not supported. His charts were hidden and forgotten in the Spanish archives, and he had no successor. The Spaniards who found the pearls of the Californian gulf in their way, were, throughout the whole seventeenth century, occupied in pearl :fishing expeditions ; for maritime enterprise they showed so little interest and energy that they lost even the knowledge of the northern part of that gulf, some supposing that it might be an endless strait. On this point the companions of Cortez had entertained no doubt. . Of the configuration of our more northern coasts, the most fabulous reports were at that time credited, and the De Fucas, Fontes, and other impostors, were believed to have sailed where water perhaps might have been found in antediluvian ages. The Jesuits were the first to found the Californian conquest on the firm basis of settlement and colonization. During the first half of the eighteenth century they christianized and, though roughly, explored all the countries ·which surround the Gulf of California on both sides. They were in a fair way of progressing to the north, when suddenly they were interrupted by those divisions of the European powers, which gave the death blow to all their activity. The Franciscan missionaries, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, took in hand the work commenced by the Jesuits, and assisted in their land excursions by a series of maritime expeditions of the government, and explored a great section of our coast in a more satisfactory manner than had yet been done. At the same time the Russians came along the coast from the higher north to lower latitudes; and soon after also the English, conducted by their Pacific hero, James Cook, again made their appea.Tance: By a singular combination of circumstances, of which I have tried in my memoir to develop the particular causes, this hitherto forlorn region became then the general meeting place of navigators of nearly all the nations of Europe. The Portuguese, the French, the American citizens, all took some part in this new sphere of activity ; but in the midst of all, the English Vancouver bore away the palm by making at the end of the century that excellent survey, by which our coast became at once nearly as well known as other parts of the world. This extraordinary activity was again interrupted during the European wars, after the French revolution, and in a certain sense our present century had to commence the work anew. Several Russian, French, and English navigators partly completed the surveys of Vancouver after the conclusion of peace. The Spaniards by and by disappeared from this scene of action, and the wheel of fortune, excluding all others, brought at last to the head of western affairs the nation whose pioaeers and explorers now flocked in from all sides, by land as well as by

sea, and which at last organized, as it had already done on the eastern and Mexican gulf coast, systematic plans to consummate the work of survey and exploration. The -circumstance that our Pacific coast lay so remote, and the difficulties which interposed in reaching it, have had another peculiar consequence, which is rather favorable to the historian. To the eastern coast of America, which was so much nearer to Europe, many private expeditions went out from Spain, as well as from France and other countries, soon after the discovery by Columbus. The journals and reports of these adventurers, if they ever wrote any, have not been preserved. They could sometimes do their work only very secretly. No account of them is found in the archives. We therefore see many islands or coast sections mentioned as known, (some even laid down on the maps,) without being able to name the man who :first made the discovery. Afterwards, when the eastern coast,· especially that of North America, became thickly settled, so many obscure hands were at work in continuing the detail of the exploration, that it is sometimes impossible to :find authentic evidence for the date and manner of each new appearance or name of river, cape, and harbor. On our Western Coast private exertion, at least for a long period of time, did little or nothing. The attractions were so small, ;.ho difficulties so great, that combined forces, as gove:rnments or other powerful political bodies can only afford them, were necessary to overcome these obstacles. We have, therefore, here, more than in any other part of America, to deal with offedal expeditions, fitted out as well as the time permitted, and sent to the coast on special command, either by the Viceroys of Mexico, the Kings of Spain, England, or France, or the President and Congress of the United States. Not only the naval, but also the first land expeditions to the coast, were undertaken by well known religious, political, or commercial bodies ; by the orders of the Jesuits and Franciscans; by the great Russian, English, and American fur companies, and some of them also by the American government. From the first mo1Tement on our coast, under Cortez and Mendoza, to the last exploring expedftions under Lewis and Clarke, Beechey, Wilkes, Fremont, Emory, and others, we have a chain of great official expeditions at long intervals, growing out partly, as I said, one from the other. These circumstances give to the history of our Western Coast quite peculiar features. It is nearly all official and well authenticated history.. In many cases the instructions given to the navigators at the outset are preserved to us. Of some of the northwestern expeditions, which happened to excite great interest in a more enlightened time, quite voluminous and complete accounts have been written. And though, as I have said, sometimes long series of years pasEed without action at all, we need not fear, as we might of other regions, that in the intervals much has escaped our notice. On what wa,s done, we are comparatively well instructed. The progress of exploration and maritime enterprise depends, of course, like every national exertion, very much upon great political events. It progresses rapidly when the affairs of the exploring nation are in a flourishing state. It stops with the downfall of the State. Peace, war, the appearance of great and enterprising kings or other powerful characters, exercise a great influence on the development of the work. I might, therefore, have arranged my. reports after the periods and heads of the political history of Europe without losing the great and leading events of the time.

This would, how·

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

423

ever, have had many inconveniences, because we had to deal with navigators belonging to very different nations and States. "'~ e dare say that every special branch of history, though developing itself from the great general course of events, still brings along with it its own chronology ; and the more special it is, the more this will be the case. I have, therefore, tor the history of our Western Coast, invented a special chronology, or, more properly speaking, I have adopted those periods or epochs which the dovelopment of this particular work seemed to offer. Events on the Western Coast are divided into historical groups corresponding with the periods of Cortez, Drake, and Vancouver, who distinguished themselves in discovery. Allusion is sometimes made to general events which bore upon the subject, in order to show the connection of maritime enterprii;e with those great events. From this has grown out a plan for the work, the special titles of which will be readily seen in the headings of its different chapters. Accounts of all the western exploring expeditions are arranged in strict chronological order, to show the gradual growth of the im1. t'OVcmcnt and completion of knowledge in discovery. To keep up this chronological arrangement through the whole body of the work was, from two circumstances, not very difficult. The field of discovery was not very extensive. An expedition which would touch on one part would usually sweep along the whole of it. Secondly, the operations were conducted for the sake of discovery. Through more than two and a half centuries there were never, at the same time, more than one expedition upon the coast. We could, therefore, treat as a whole the particulars of each, accompanying one explorer from the beginning of his excursion to the end, and then take up the next. A few general remarks and some retrospective observations suffice to interlink them all so as to form a connected narrative. This method, however, requi1·ed modification for more recent times, when the explorers began to crowd each other, as it were; several of them appearing at the same time, and pru;hing their researches parallel to each other, sometimes independent, and somefimes with united forces, . through a series of years. Different nations, too, or commercial companies, then took an active part in the work, each executing a series of operations, some being more active in the north ; others in the south ; some exploring the interior, and others confining themselVes to the margin of the waters. A strict observance of chronological order for such a period would have had great inconveniences. During the short space of a year we would have to carry the reader from place to place. We would have had to leave one explorer in the very midst of his career, in order to take up the beginning of the route of one of his cotemporaries. It would be necessary to accompany the Russians one step further south, and then to show the French in Canada advancing a short distance further to the west, and at the same time turn our eyes to the Spaniards, in their missionary stations, to find that they, during that particular period, did nothing at all. In fact, the strictest chronological order, under such circumstances, would be the greatest historical disorder; and hence, for such periods, it has not been attempted. Some well defined ~hains of operations have been followed out from beginning to end-special chapters being devoted to them. Such advance a little in time, and then run back to trace in the same

manner a similar series of interlinked movements made in another section of the coast,
by another nation or company.

"Many have supposed," remarks the excellent Captain Burney, "that to abridge is a work of no great skill and labor."* It is sometimes called "compiling," an expression which may, indeed, be characteristic of the unskilful, careless, and rude manner in which some abridgements of voyages and reports on exploring expeditions have been made. I have not tried to "compile,' i but to dige.':Jt the rich material before me ; to ex.tract from it what appertained to my subject; to condense and compress it; and to lay the whole in a clear and connected historical narrative before the reader. This process of digesting, extracting, condensing, and relating requires a high degree of skill and critical judgment, and a. great deal of knowledge of the principal subject, as well as of all of the manifold secondary subjects connected with it. Hence, the fear that I may have totally failed should, perhaps, keep me silent ; but the conviction that I have done my best gives me the courage to explain further how and ]n what manner I have tried to accomplish the work in question. In doing so, I may, however, be stating rather what was wished than what I have <lone. First of all, on taking up for notice an exploring expedition, I pointed out the circumstance wh.ich induced a new enterprise, and alluded in a few retrospective sentences to the state of local knowledge as left by the former expeditions. The expedition was put down under the name of the chief commander of the vessel or vessels when a naval enterprise was in question; for the spirit of the commander pervades the whole undertaking, and what was done under him ought to be considered as done by him ; the merits as well as the faults of the enterprise should be ascribed to him. In most cases I included the names of the second in command, and other principal officers. These sometimes take the lead in case of the death of the commander, and their names are frequently perpetuated in geography in the designation of capes, harbors, rivers, or other objects. The names of the vessels are likewise mentioned as contributing, according to their qualities, not a little to the success of an exp~dition, often not less than the officers and crew themselves. Their names, too, are often perpetuated in geography ; and a knowledge of their size and burden often serves to decide doubtful but very interesting questions in the history of the expedition. Unhappily, we are seldom made acquainted with the names of the crew and companions of an explorer, and their former and subsequent fate. If this had been done i~ all cases, we would frequently have been able to show much clearer how a school of e:x.pl-Orers wae formed, how one of these schools grew out from the other, and how a certain acquired knowledge was spread through the world. The directions and instructions which a commander receives from his authorities for the expedition a.re of a decisive import in estimating its value. As he is directed in his movements by them, so we can only follow his movements and operations with a clear knowledge of them .. Unhappily, these instructions are so often not to be found among the documents brought to our notice. When practicable, I have not omitted to mention the leading points of their contents. The same may be said of the scientific outfit of the expedition, ·of the number ~d construe· tion of the instruments used on board the vessels, and the qualifications of the le~ned men who, as assistants, accompanied the expedition. The- old navigators and their hist.orians :rarely give

us more than a hint on these most interesting subjects, and not always in modern reports do we find complete lists of the instruments used on board the vessels. On the good or bad qualities of a single set of instruments the geography of a coast rnay be truly or erroneously determined and put dov.;n for centuries. Take, for example, the astronomical positions determined by Viz;caino in the year 1603. He had no successor until 1770, and was the nautical authority for our Western Coast for more than one hundred and fifty years. I have tried to find information on this most important but most obscure branch of maritime hi8tory, and have noticed the occasion at which a point on our coast, for the first time, was observed with tolerably good astronomical instruments. ! have also pointed out the date at which, for the first time, a chronometer waR carried along the coast, and have further alluded to the period of the first introduction of other scientific improvements. I could, however, but seldom attempt such explanations-partly from want of information, and as much from want of space. It is evident.. that, in a general history like this, many important matters which are capable of being developed in special historical essays can onlj, be touched upon in passing. The same may be said with-respect to the astronomical results which the discoverers and observers reached with their instruments. I have sometimes, in treating of a very eminent man, alluded to them, and have compared, for instance, the latitudes and longitudes of Vancouver with those of Malaspina, and again with those of our United States Coast Survey; bnt this could be done only in rare cases. To carry out such interesting and useful comparisons to any degree of complet!)ness would have taken me beyond the limits of my sketch. After having taken into consideration, in the manner stated above, the scientific outfit and import of the expedition; stating its principal character; whether from the beginning a true and genuine exploring expedition destined for di8covery, or in it8 main objects a commercial, political, or military enterprise; and if for exploration and discovery only, whether as an accidental and secondary object, I proceed to relate the principal events of the voyage itself. Selection from the many events which the journals written by navigators and travellers contain, was sometimes difficult. They usually report daily on everything occurring on board their ships, but often without any critical method whatever. They recite at greatest length what touches them nearest ; and remarks which, for the subsequent historian, are of the highest interest, are sometimes only casually made and communicated in remote relatiuu to the thread of the narrative. The first thing which attracts the attention is the point where the strange coast was first seen-the Landfall. I have tried to fix this point accurately in all cases; it is sometimes involved in doubt, but, if properly determined, pften serves to throw light upon all the future proceedings of the navigator, and upon the position of his ships, which may likewise be doubtful at subsequent events. .. During the progress of the exploration I have endeavored to include every incident or remark which can be serviceable to the history of science, or which might illustrate the operations, the track, and the success of the navigator in question. The event.a in a voyage, as in every other human undertaking, will generally be found so interlinked as to form, as it<Were, one continuous chain in which the accurate observer thinks he can spare no li_nk whatever.

occurrence on board the vessel, the want of an article of provision, a turn in the mental disposition, or even the reveries of the commander, may sometimes give a perfectly new impulse or turn to the expedition, or may be the cause of it1:1 overthrow. To understand everything, and to see it in all its beariugs, causes and effects, the reader would, therefore, wish to have at command the complete and foll report. As this, however, cannot be expected from a general description like that of the Western Coast, the main object of which is to c~ndense matter, it is evident that, in saying I had omitted no important incident, could only be' meant no principal one of decisive and palpable influence and interest. In accordance with this, I pointed out the objects on the coast which were for the first time seen and observed on the expedition in question, and the names which were for the first time introduced by it in geography-if the object, harbor, cape, bay, mountain, &c., had been already discovered. I indicated, in few words, what change or improvement was observable in the remarks of the later nav1gator, anrl whether he was aware of, or had noticed at all, the discoveries of his predecessors. Writing f~r· hydrographic purposes, I took, of cmtrse, particular notice of the hydrogruphic discoveries made in the voyage of the observations for latitude and longitude ; on the con:6guration and position of the coast; on soundings, good harbors and anchorage ; ·on the size and course of the discovered rivers, &c. Botanical and other discoveries, in regard to the productions and nature of the soil, I have treated more slightly, and shortened very much, or left out entirely, the reports on the political state of the country, on the ''mission,'' and especially on the transactions with the Indians, on which ancient as well as modern navigators have been fond of expatiating so much. I have referred to the Indians only in a few instances, when the navigators received from them good hints about the direction of tho route to be taken, about the trending of the coast, the course of a river, &c., or when the Europeans adopted a geographical name invented by them, or when, perhaps, these transactions with the Indians were either particularly disastrous or otherwise important, and when the locality of the event, therefore, remained famous in the history of the coast. I have tried particularly to find out and mark the places where the expedition anchored for some time, and tho exact dates and period of such a stay. The journals of our mariners are often very far from being accurate and complete in their chronology, and not seldom even the date of such an important event as the "landfall" can only be arrived at by discussion from a combination of circumstances ; yet these dates are, of course, all important for deciding in doubtful cases the priority of discovery. . Having accompanied, in this manner, the navigator on his entire route, and traced the principal directions and turnings of his track, I attempted at last to determine, in connection with the date, the locality of the limit reached by him. The coast limits of the explorers are as much shrouded in doubt as their landfalls, and are· just as eagerly discussed. They became famous in maritime history, alf!d we sometimes find the '' ne plus ultra'' of a celebrated navigator put down ()n the maps, and making a great figure there for more than a century, if during this time the place was not reached by a subsequent explorer. Finally, I have pointed out the cause of the end the expedition and its departure from the coast; whether it was occasioned by the want of provisions, sickness of the crew, shipwreck, the hostility of the Indians, or other disastrous events, or from the circumstance of the commander's ha.vfog fu11i11ed his mission i and last of all, I have summed up, briefly, ~be geo-

graphical results of the expedition, showed what was made by it on the former voyages, and what was yet left to be done by subsequent explorers. In this manner I have tried to define the rank which the expedition in question should occupy in history, connecting it, at the same time, with the whole chain of enterprises in which it forms a link. To du this the more effectually, I have now and then introduced general remarks on the progress of discovery, either in the shape of a short introductory note to a new voyage, or in that of a concluding note to the one preceding. I have so far spoken only of the manner in which I tried to treat, extract, and compress the accounts of sea voyages and expeditions. I :need not speak particularly of the mode of treatment when a land journey was in question, or where, instead of a o:ingle expedition, au account of a series of voyages of the same nation was to be given. I have applied, more or less, th~ same method also to them, and have arranged and repOl'ted on them in the same manner. One principal point remains still to be touched upon, namely, the nature of the sources of information, the authorities, literary productions and documents, which I have used for compo· sition, and the manner in which I arranged the materials. I sought, of course, only for the most authentic and original documents for every case, but in this pursuit met many difficulties. It has been already shmvn that, for certain reasons, our literature, in rm·pect to voyages on the northwest coast of America, is comparatively complete. Having nearly throughout to do, principally, with official government expeditions, which, for the time being, attracted a good deal of attention, we are correspondingly well furnished in official information, and with authentic reports and documents. This remark must, however, be received with a considerable degree of allowance. That we are in possession of a part of the instructions given by Cortez to his captains, first sent out to tho northwest, a~d have yet the original official reports of Ulloa, Alarcon, Coronado, and other commanders, to Cortez and the Viceroy (Mendoza) of Mexico, on returning from their earliest northwestern excursions, ii:; a rare fortune, though it is characteristic of the whole documentary history of our Western Coast. For historical purposes, iu reference to other regions of America, we are far less favored; the historian has, nevertheless, in the former case, to lament the loss of many valuable sources of information known to have 0nce existed. He perceives, in reviewing and arranging his "authorities/' many blanks, so that, although he may be regarded as comparatively rich in materials, he is often inclined to think himself very poor. · Nearly all the great exploring expeditions, before being determined upon, were preceded by manifold transaci.ions, correspondence, and discussions between the authorities which decided and the persons interested in them-as between the royal governments and their viceroys, or -0ther p-rovi:ncial chiefs, and between those and the persons destined for the command of the e:x.pedition, or otherwise to be engaged in it. There are instances )n which such correspondence was carried on for years, volumes having been written on the expedition before it weighed anchor at all. We have sometimes fong preliminary discussions on the subject of exploration ·in"·1ongress or Pa.rlimnent, and thti learned academies and other scientific bodies disclL'lS .the

..lilatter in thfilr way. :¥1)8t of these import.ant souroosof information are now quite lost or inaccessible to us.

The

preliminary official correspondence is very seldom fu11y ~reserved even in the archives of the States, or the hydrographic offices, and we are rarely favored with such glimpses or scattered specimens as the excellent Spanish archivcst, Navarette, has communicated in his well known and most valuable collection of ollicial letters and documents relating to voyages of discovery. Even with that important and nearly indispensable article-the imitructions given to the commanderswe are seldom favored. These instructions were sometimes intentionally kept secr_et, and sometimes even the commanders of the expeditiorn; have omitted them in their publications from negligence or oversight. Throughout the expeditiom; themselves usually a great deal has been committed to paper. The commander-in-chief has kept journals, the t>econd in command hiR log, and perhaps also the mates and the volunteers, preachers, missionaries, commercial agents, and scientific gentlemen have all taken their notes, and have, where occasion offered, written letters to their friends at home. Possibly a chart was drawn on board the vessel-perhaps one in each of several, or more than one on each vessel. Such charts were laid down on a large scale, each on the very spot itself, on uumerous great sheets of paper, and step by step the track of the vessel was marked upon it. On these charts and in the journals are contained note;; and letters written on the spot, under the impression of the moment, in tho midst and in sight of the very objects they describe ; thus forming the most anthentic and original sources of information on the events of the voyage. They constitute the most interesting· library of the voyage which we could wish for. The historian would like to have them all. He would desire that nothing of all that should escape him. But in most cases-nay, nearly in all-he must greatly restrain his expectations. Of these original archives, accumulated during the voyage on board the vessel, very little comes to his notice. Instead of them, he obtains perhaps nothing bttt a contracted official report, made up from ''notes'' after the return ; and, instead of the large sheets of charts made on the spot, on which he might note the position of the vessel at any particular moment, he is favored with nothing but a little reduced chart added at the end of the book. He is fortunate in having even that ; for, in pursuing his researches, he will soon learn that, with at least half of the narratives, even ''reduced'' maps have never been published. The official reports made by the commanders to the government, in their original form, have been to the same extent kept in the secret archives, lost there in course of time, and then brought to light again in another shape, thought fit for the public at large. Time, too, has carried on the work of destruction, so that for entire periods all official documents are wanting, and we lose all mention of the commander-in-chief, the soul of the expedition, in regard to his operations and intentions. Short accounts given by subordinate individuals must then be treated as precious documents, and la<:\onic journals made by an ignorant sailor or soldier are to be commented upon in place of the brilliant reports of a Herodotus or Xenophon. Sometimes we have only second or third hand information, or perhaps nothing but hearsay reports ; still we must listen attentively to this echo, which comes to us by a repeatedly broken reverberation, and construct from it our calculations and hypotheses. It will, from this, easily be perceived under what ,restricti-011s the mention of authentic tionrces t1hould be understood. The question has nearly always been to make e., critical choi-Oe between the more or less unauthentic, and to take the .least deceptive.

The critical and bibliographical discussion of the comparative value of the accounts of voyages are of the highest importance for our object. An accurate knowledge of their chronology, and of the dateR of different editions of maps and books, decides l:lometimes in regard to the question of a date or pri.ority of discovery. It was evidently necessary to enter into tl1cse uiscussions to a certain degree. In a general work, like the history of the \Y estern Coast, this could be <lone, of course, only to a very small extent. In very important cases I have expreseed my opinions on the points involved. As this, however, could be done only in a very shwt and .concise manner, I have Ftated these literary questions is additional notes under the text, ,;o as not to interrupt the ihTead of my narrative. In a general note, added to the inscription of the voyage, I have given a list of the titles of the works or documents which I regarded as containing the principal and most origim1l accounts, excluding therefrom second-hand or more remote information. To this latter class, in which I include discussion of voyages and matters appertaining to them in critical reviews, in the memoirs of scientific bodies, in geographical works, maps, or atlases of the world, which show how the matter, brought before the world by the discoverer, was digested by the geographers of the time, how they understood his reports and used them for the advancement of knowledge, how they embodied his charts of a little section of the world in their general pictures of the globe ; to all these matters, when occasion offered, I have referred in subsequent notes under the text, so that I venture to say the reader will find at hand, and brought together in practical connection, all that he wants for convincing himself of the degree of correctness of my statements, and also for further information on the subjects. I may be allowed to state on this point, further, that I have not considered myself as a distributer of praise or blame. My work was not to be a repository for critical remarks, though critical research must have preceded itfl composition. I have, therefore, all the authorities I tbought to be the best, as a rule, simply quoted; and I hope I have seldom, if ever, deviated from this rule.

III. Special liydrography of the Western Coast.
I have before said that a special description of the coast previous to entering the field of history would be desirable in some respects, but that, for certain decisive c0nsiderations, I thought it better to let a general sketch of the history of the exploration and geography of the coast be followed by such special description. There are many nice historical points and questions which can be satisfactorily decided, so to say, only on the very field ef action, and some which can only be made quite clear by means of the details of the description, and which, therefore, it is most convenient to bring forward with the description itself. These historical niceties may easily be separated from the general historical sketch, but to

make them intelligible such a general sketch must have already preceded.
The local history, also, of places can be much better understood in connection with minute hydrographic descriptions; they throw light upon each other, and should not be separated. But the local history ca11 only be understood after a full development of the general history, which consequently carries with it the special description. 'l'his will be made still clearer in explaining the arrange!11ent of matter in this third prfucipal division of my work.

430

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

I have divided the coast into sections, putting down as dividing limits certain headlands, great turning points of the coast, or deep and broad indentations, river mouths, or other very marked and prominent natural features. These divisions should be neither t.oo large nor too small: too large, as not being throughout of the same character, would require other subdivisions; too small, as offering no striking differences and shades of character, would lead us to repetition and would destroy tl;ie contrasts. The proper limit;; could not, of course, be fixed by any general rule, but must depend chiefly on the extent and speciality of the work to be written. It would not do at all to adopt for our purposes the political divisions, the boundaries of States or provinces, because by this method objects which form a natural part of a physical division would sometimes be separated. Still it may be very convenient, and, under some circumstances, even necessary, to adopt as the end of a section a political boundary line. The great headlands, remarkable bends, and turning points, on the coast, usually mark, also, its natural divisions. In the neighborhood of those headlands the climate of the coast often changes. 'l'hey serve to break the prevalent winds, and have a great influence on the direc. tion of the tides and currentf!. Frequently they are prominent landmarks, the terminations of great mountain ranges, and play as great a part in history as in nature; near them the navi· gators were accustomed to make their landfalls also, and they form the ne plms 'Ultra of many expeditions. Nevertheless, our coast divisions could not be made exclusively by the headlands; on great tracks of the coast we find no prominent headland at all, and must then, if a division be neces· sary, have recourse to a broad inlet, or river mouth, or some other well defined object.. As no method could be devised which would obviate every inconvenience, I have followed no strict method whatever, but have made my choice among the objects on the coast according to circumstances. The small islands I have considered as dependencies of the coast section near which they lie, and have treated them in connection with it. Some extensive archipelagos I have treated of separately. Very important rivers and bays have not been treated as appurtenances of the coast, but are described in special chapters, as San Francisco bay, Admiralty sound, Columbia river en· trance, &c. Generally I have not adopted many divisions and subdivisions, but rather preferred to put all the objects which belong to a greater section under running numbers, one after the other, though strictly taken they perhaps should have been put one under the other. Of each larger coast sectien I have tried to give the general characteristics, the leading features, the trending of the whole coast line and range of the mountains and elevations which define the trending. The history of the principal names under which the coast section has been known in the course of time is also given. After this I have taken into consideration each principal object on the coast section in succession, at first giving a hydrographic description of it, and then its

history.
These objects, as well as the coast sections themselves, I ha.ve a1'l'allg'6d u much as possible in geographical order, from south to n~rth, following in this manner the wh<>le of our P.acific

coast from its initial point at San Diego to its northern end at the British American boundary in ~ 0 north latitude. ' This arrangement is the most natural and convenient, because it is pretty much in agreement with the march of the ma1·itime history of the coast, which was first discovered and settled in its more southern parts from Mexico. The northern sections became 1rnown at a later time. In adopting this arrangement, we therefore proceed in parallelism with hiE»tory, from the oldest known objects to matters of a later date. In the hydrographic description of each cape, bay, harbor, island, river, &c., I have tried to give a general as well as special view of it. If a mountain or headland ·was under consideration, I described the aspect which it offers from the sea, its shape, size and conuection with the interior of the country, its approaches and the rocks and isfets scattered around it ; I have pointed out the influence which it is likely to exert on 'vinds and currents, and the protection which it affords to anchorage in its neighborhood. If a harbor, lagoon, or bay was in question, I defined its outlines and extent generally in nautical miles, its characteristic soundings in fathoms and foet, the channels leading into it, and through its interior waters ; the depth of water on its bar if one existed, the sand banks in its vicinity, and in all these particulars as far as I believed it necessary for such a general work as that under review; not so far, however, as would be requisite for the purposes of navigation ; it was not the intention to write a coast pilot, but only to compose a work for the illustration of history. Some peculiar difficulties arose with respect to the description of the rivers. The question how far they oug·ht to be considered as belonging to the coast department and to form objects of marine hydrography was not always easily to be answered. Their mouths, which are sometimes the most frequented harbors and anchorages, and the manner of their connection with the ocean, weTe decidedly parts of our fielcl of researcl1, and I have given to their bars, channels, currents, tides and freshets particul:u attention. The limit of tide wateT might perhaps be considered as the boundary of research for the historical coast surveyor, but I thought that at least in a general way the rive1· should be traced up throughout its interior course, and that its size and principal bends ought to be pointed out to show its importance and relation to the coast and to marine affairs. Beyond tide water no detailed description was deemed necessary. It is an observation by which every geographer must often have been struck, that tho objects on the same great division of a coast win have a remarkable resemblance to each other. Certain forms of headlands will sometimes be found to predominate on a coast section for a certain distance, and then give place to a class of differently- shaped headlands. 'l,he con- . :figuration of harbors, bays and lagoons, the manner and circumstances under which rivers reach the coast, will in certain divisions be found strikin~ly similar. Such similarities along the coast line are of course, i? most cases, only consequences of the predominant geological structure of the country ;.. they may be partly due to the effect of prevalent currents, winds, and other agencies, peculiar to the regions. Such i;imilarities I have pointed out by repeated comparisons of one bay, cape or island with another. In the hydrographic descriptions, I closely followed the reports and descriptions of

43~

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

the navigators, and eye-witnesses themselves, and often used their very words when I believed ihern to be very appropriate and striking. · After the descripiion of the object in question, I entered into its local- history, the account of its discovery, name and survey, mentioning the time, and the navigator by whom the capes were first descried or doubled, the harbors entered, the rivers traced, the islands circumnavigated. I have showed who first surveyed, sounded and described them, and who m~de the first astronomical observations on the spot. I have related, further, who made the second and improved explorations and survey, and who gave corrected longitudes and latitudes. According to the importance of the object in question, I have entered more or less deeply into these researches, ::'nd pointed out at last where the latest and best views, plans, charts, and surveys of the locality may be found. In this manner I have brought the whole local history of the Western Coast of the United States to the period of the operations of the United State Coast Survey. With the history of exploration and surveying, I also combined the history of the n,ame first given to each object, the subsequent changes of the name, and by whom introduced, and have tried to settle questions in regard to the propriety of their application and orthography. When the locality in question was somewhat extensive, I have given, after the general description of it, a general history of its exploration, and then afterwards a special description of its particular parts, combined with their particular local history. It is obvious that in this way repetitions could not in all cases be avoided. Many events which had been already related in my general historical memoir were to be referred to again. I therefore preferred rather to admit some repetition than any incompleteness. Besides, the same events would thus be related in the two ca1:>es with different connections; in the general historical sketch they stand in chronological order, but in the special hydrographic description are distributed geographically. Opportunities, of which I took advantage, were thus given to add certain minor discoveries, and to trace the history of some specialities of observation, for which I could :find no convenient place in the general historical view. In this way I believe the entire work will be found to progress from the more general to the more particular, everything growing from its root in an easy and logical manner. We have begun with a general description in order to lay a sort of foundation for the work ; we have been able after this to gjve a general view of the history of the entire coast; and then we have brought our history and description again together, developing the peculiar
~specialities

features of greater sections of the coast, and at last the geographical as well as historical of every point and place.

IV. Appendires.

In two appendices to the work I have givenI. A collection of reduced copies of maps and charts of the coast, lllade at sev~ral periods of time, ancient and modern, and II, a hi1:>torical map of the coast, on which I hav0 tried to represent in colors the tracks, the landfalls, and ne plus ultras of the navigators, and also the routes of the land travellers, so far as they fall within the range of our Western Coast. The collection of ancient and modern maps and charts is arranged cbronofogically. It

'rHE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

433

begins with a chart of the time of Cortez and ends with the first general chart made under the direction of the Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey. The small copies, of course, only represent the most important features of the originals, and those among the names that were most renowned for the time being. In the explanatory ''notes'' which accompany them, I have endeavored to give a short sketch of the history of each map, and have occai;ionally made some remarks on the chartography of the Western Coast in general. The charts will serve to illustrate the history of the discovery of the Western Coast, and will themselves derive more light from this history. In the hi:>torical memoir I had frequent occasion to refer and make allusion to them. On the large colored map of the Western Coast I have tried, by a new method, to represent in colors the field of each discoverer. In a note I have described the plan of its construction, and the uee which may be made of it, for the further illustration of our subject. I have further added to the work a full and complete table of contents, which shows its whole plan and· purpose in a compeni;lious manner, and enables the reader to find out readily every object connected with the history of the Western Coast to which he may be desirous to refer. To make the work still more useful as a book of reference, I ·would have added to it also an alphabetical index ; but &9 it is tho intention to bring out similar comprehensive works on the Atlantic and lilexican Gulf coasts of the United States, it may perhaps be better to defer the preparation of such an index until after the entire work has been completed, and to comprise in it all matters connected with the history and. hydrograpby of the coast. of this great country. In concluding this letter, where I have been assisted in my difficult task by so much kindness, I cannot help giving expression to warm feelings of thankfulness for the generous and liberal courtesies extended to me in the. libraries of Cambridge and Boston. Still engaged, and yet enjoying this delightful literary hospitality, I can do full justice to the spirit which prompts it, and to my feelings and sense of duty, after I have brought to an end my whole task. I may then take the liberty to specify somewhat more at length the assiStance which I have received in researches through the kindness of officers and owners of American libraries. Such specification may perhaps be useful to the American reader in learning at what places he may find stored np ample means of information on subjects kindred to that on which even so short a work as mine may, it is hoped, not prove uninteresting. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Srn: In c01npliance with your order of the 9th instant, I respectfully submit the following report of the assistance rendered to the American ship "Manlius," of Boston, by th~ officerl! and crew of this vessel. On the morning of the 9th, while on our way from Old Point to Ocracoke inlet, North Carolina, we were boarded, off "Magnois, " by Francis 0. Pitman, esq., captain of the ship Ma11lius, of Boston, tl1en on his way to Norfolk for asl!istance, who reported th.at hfs ship was at anchor off Cape Henry, and in a very disabled condition, leaking at the rate of 4,000 strokes Jler hour, ·and }1is ofllcers and crew nearly exhausted from their continued efforts to keep her from sinking. He requested us to give him immediate assistance, and the steamer was at once headed for his vessel, then distant some ten miles. About 2 p. m. we arrive-.! ,near her, and I, with Lieutenant Bayard E.

bound to Baltimore, with a cargo of 1,000 tons of copper ore on board consigned to the Baltimore Copper Smelting Company. The ship had been leaking a little for some time past, but on Sunday the 5th in;.;tant, when about 37 5 miles from the capos of Virginia, the leak 'nts found to have suddenly increased to 3, 500 strokes the hour. All hands were then sent to the pumps, but the leak increasing to 4,000 r:trokes, preparations were made on Tuec;day the 7th instant to abandon her, the captain and officers considering it ver3- doubtful if the ship eould Le kept afloat much longer ; LuL with a favorable breeze alld coutiuiwd exertions they succeede<l, with tho assislance of a Baltimore pilot, ~Ir. Thomas Beau, ('d10 boanled them on Monday,) in anchoring the ship off Cape Henry in ton fathoms of water. The crow were then too much exhausted to furl her heaviest sails, and moreover, too, they coul<l not well leave the pumps, as their efforts could barely keep her afloat. Finding the ship in thiR state, I deemed it my diity to take immediate charge; and on an examination of her by Lieutenant Him11 and myself, we found the leak to be in her ;.;tarboard quarter very low dmvn, and the water ru:;hing into the ship with great rapidity, so that with a large force at the pumps we could barely keep her free. I estimate the value of the ship at $40, 000, and cargo at $250, 000, and, in my opinion, she would have sunk in from 15 to 20 hours had not assistance been so opportunely rendered. At 5 p. m., the wind being light from the SHJ., the "Hetzel" took us in tow, and cast us off when well up in the roads. I then anchored the ship, furled her sails, and with our men left her for the night, gi,·ing her in charge of Captain Pitman, who in the meantime had procured some laborers from Old Point to relieve his crew at the pumps. Before leaving·, however, l made arrangements with Captain Pitman to send him more assistance during the night should he requi1·e it, and ~rnhse quently some supplies for the sick, and for the. vessel also, were sent on board from the steamer. On the 10th I again boarded her and found that Captain Pitman no longer needed our a.'!sistance, as he had obtained men enough in Norfolk to keep his ship afloat and fake 110r in tow of a steam tug to Baltimore. I remain, i:;ir, yours, respectfully,

Haroor ef Pensacola, Der.ember 1, 1856. Srn: I have the honor to inform yon that I arrived here yesterday, having left the navy yard, Brooklyn, on the 8th ultimo, and Staten Island the following morning. On my way across the Bahama banks I touched at New Providence, and afterwards put into Havana. At th(/ former place I took on board, at the request of the United States vice consul at Nassau, thirteen distressed seamen, who had composed the crew of the American ship Julia Howard, recently sunk on the Bahama bank, and also six steerage passengers from the same vessel, for the purpose of conveying them to Pensacola. At Havana, however, upon their own application, and by the advice of the United States consul at that port, I permitted the seamen to leave the vessel, and oight of them, claiming to be Portuguese subjects, were taken in charge by the consul for Portugal. The passengers, who aro entirely destitute, I was obliged to bring to this place, as I could find no means of sending them to New Orleans, their place of destination. I enclose a letter to the Hon. Secretary of the Navy, with copies of two communications in relation to this subject from the respective United States consuls. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, JOHN K. DUER, lieut.

Sm: I have the honor to inform you that I have now in charge thirteen distressed seamen who belonged to the American ship Julia Howard, Patterson master, recently sunk on the Bahama banks while performing a voyage from Boston to New Orleans; and if you could conveniently and consistently do so, I should be very glad if you would give them .a passage to Pensacola, for I see no very immediate opportunity of trending them away.

There were also six steerage passengers on board the ''Julia Howard'' at the time of her disaster, who represent themselves to me to be American citizens, and who are quite destitute, having lost everything when they were obliged to take to their boats. I am unauthorized by government to take these men in charge, and since they have been here they have been maintained by private charity. If yon would also take these poor fellows to Pensacola, they would be exceedingly olJliged to you, and I should be relieved of a tax upon my purse. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, JOHN R.

Havana, November 25, 185G. Sm: Eight of the seamen belonging to the crew of the ··wrecked American ship "Julia Howard," Capt. Patterson, that were placed on board your ship by the United States consul at Nassau, having presented themselves to the consul for Portugal in this place, stating that they are Portuguese subjects; that they are named, respectively, Jose Viera, Pedro Jose Machado, Juan de Sousa Cardoso, Manuel 'l'ejera Marcial, Antonio do Mato de Silveria, Jose de Oliverra Manuel Pereira Seal, and Manuel Miner da Cruz, and expressing a wish to be landed in this port, where they can obtain employment; and the said consul having requested me to permit the said seamen to be landed here, offering to take charge of_ them, thereby relieving the United States of all responsibility and expense, I have concluded that it is expedient and proper to accede to his request, and therefore I beg of you to allow the said men to come on shore with such baggage as they may have.

BANGOR, ME., Sept.ember 8, 1857. Sm: I have the honor to report that the re-examination of the Point of Rocks, at Westport, MasR., has been made in accordm1ce with a direction contained in a letter from the department, under date November 29, 1856. The following is a copy of the report addressed to me by Lieut. Comg. C. R. P. Rodgers, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast Survey, on completing the service required : '' In pursuance of your instructions, I went in the steamei: Bibb, on the 8th of August, to make an examination of the Point of Rocks, at West.port, Mass., in order to determine, in connection with the commerce of that locality, the expediency of erecting a light-house there. '' The inspector of the customs informs me that there are now belonging to West.port nineteen whaling vesf'els of from 120 to 350 tons, five coasting vessels of from 10 to 90 tons, and tw·e'"lve fishing vessels of from 10 to 50 tons. Ten of the whaling vessels belonging to Westport are now refitted at N" ew Bedford. "I am led to believe that during the stormy months, if theJO harbor was marked by a. light, many small coasting vessels would find shelter at West.port when baffled by wind and weather between New Bedford and Newport, instead of turning back to one of those places for a port of refuge. ''After a careful examination of the harbor and its approaches, and a long conference with the pilots and sea captains of W ~stport, I think there can be no doubt that the· southeastern extremity of the ' Point of Rocks' is the best position for the proposed light-house· The channel, which is very narrow, runs within ten yards of.the rocks, so tha.t.a vessel mighLsteer

directly for the light, and, grazing its tower, find herself at once in smooth water and a g0od anchorage. "In conclusion, I respectfully state my opinion that tho light-lwuse ought to be built; that it should show a colored light to prevent mistakes, a11d it might be of the smallest size, as its light need not be visible more than six or seven mile;;.'' 'I concur in the condusiom; presented in the report of Lieut. Comg.

DEAB SIR: I send, pe:r w· ells, Fargo & Co.

The distance between the island and the main land wai,;i gotten rather roughly by tangents, taken from the steamer, there being no opportunity to do it in the usual way. Tlite best position for a light in that vicinity has been selected, agreeably to instructions, a~ marked on the chart.

the track of ves1>els sailing· between Sant~ Barbara and San Pedro, and as there are not more than three or four vessels, including a steamer, engaged in the trade, that could be benefitted by it, I should hesitate to recommend the immediate erection of a light in that quarter. Should it, however, he decided to place one there, I would suggest that it be only of the third or fourth order, to serve merely as a guide to coast.wise vessels; for since the discovery of the dangerous rock on Cortez Bank it would he imprudent for large vessels from sea to attempt that passage, and a coast light, therefore, on Hueneme Point is, in my opinion, -,entirely unnecessary. The ground at the point selected is composed of irregular sand hilhi some ten or fifteen feet high. The lantern should be elevated at least fifty feet above the sea, so that the mist which frequently rises from the surf may not obscure it. The arc of the horimn which it will illuminate is 210 degrees. The distance to which it will be seen must, of course, depend upon the size of the light. I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

to this subject, will be aln-ay,:; favorably entertained and <luly appreciated by the Light-l10use Board, of ·which you arc chairmau, I have conclucJe<l to suhmit for your con::;idcrntion the expediency and, in fact, necessity of establishing another light-hou::;e Oil ''Fuca Straits," in addition to those already appropriated for by Congres.~, in order to inrnre safo 11avit2,-,1tion. The light-house alluded to, and "-hich, in u{y judgment, is eminently rc:1p1ire,J, sl10uld be erected on "Point Wihon," at the cntra11en of "Admiralty inlet,'· cm "Puget's Sound." Fuca Str<.dts will then have, on the .American side, lig1ti-lwu::;c,.: un C:t]JC Flattery, '·Kew Dungene>'f' q1it," Point Wil,;01-., aud Smith's i,:lall(l ; thc>"e, togdhcr 'vith a liglit-hou:oc on Race island, (where there is a Yery dangurous reef;) which it is the illtcntio11 of the Enµ:lilih government tu e;;;tablish, as I have been informed recently b~· Governor Doug: la;.;,.;, of \~anconver· s islarnl, will render navigation in Puca 8trnit:; perfectly safe in tl1e darkest nights. ']'here being a g1·eat deal of dc11,;cl,y fogµ:y weathl'r in the Stniit,.,, and tlie currents 1wt only rapid bnt very irregular, I would recommend, as <iddirional safoguard:S, that fog-l>e1lF; ho placed on New Dungeness spit, Point \\'il>'on, and Smith's isla·nd. I have been compelled to anchor frequently with this vessel in Fuca Straits, owing to the very dense fog, and ::;omctime,.: in fift~ fathoms water; whereai", if there had been fog-bdli.i on the different points sug·gesl.ed I coulu have st~od on with safety. I umlen;taml that some of the inlrnbitants of this Territor.\- are uq:cing upon the government the necessity of erecting a light-house on '' Partriup:e 11 oint'' or "Admiralty Head,'' int"tcad of Point 'Vilson. * ·X· +-' * .,, * * +.· * A glance at Captain Kellett';; chart of Fuca Straits will, [am confident, satisfy :rnn that Po111t Wilson is the most elig·iblc site for a light-house, being the foulest "hore, aml vcr~ tl;mgcrouR of approach, particularly at night and during a fo~-, in consequence of a low sanely spit extending some distance out from this point ; but on V\Tl1idbey Island Point the shore is bold and free from reefs or rocks, and the bottom soft mud. This ship has been a:<liore there, owing to a very dense fog, in only five feet water, for ;;ome F<eventrwn hours, witho11t snr;iaining the slightest damage. J All the pilots of any experience in these water:;;, aud masters of .-cs:-:els trading Let"·een San Francisco and Puget's Som1d, concur in opinion with regard to the neccBsiry of a ligl1t-hom;c at the entran~c of .Admiralty inlet, and of Point 'Wilson being: tbc most eligible site. After doubling Point \Vilson there is a safe a11chorage for ve;;sels of any draught, where they can find good holding grouud and shelter from gales of ·wind from an.Y quar-ter. A light of the third magnitude would be sufficient, provided tho::>e on Dungeness .spit and Smith's island are of greater magnitude. Having been on this station for the last eight monthR, and almost con;;tantly ernir;ing in Puget.' s Sound and Fuca Straits, by day and nig;ht, I flatter my,;elf the:rn su1'\gestiuus with reference to making navigation safe and easy in Fuca Straits, based upon my own experieuce, "-ill meet with due consideration from the board.
