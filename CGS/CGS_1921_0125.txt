INTRODUCTION.
In the interests of Government economy it is my purpose to make this report as brief as a proper presentation of the work of and conditions affecting this Bureau will permit. While the report will be as brief as may be, it is believed that it would be a mistake to abrid~e it to the extent that it would not fully present to you the vital neeas of the Bureau, the accomplishments during the fiscal year for which it is made a general idea of the task still ahead of the Bureau, the program for the current fiscal year, and a general discussion of tb-e matters affecting the Bureau.

Part !.-SUMMARY OF CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE BUREAU.
CHAPTER I.
THE FUNDAMENTAL TROUBLE IN THE BUREAU.

The first and mm;t important matter to be brought to your attention is the condition of the Bnreau as a functioning organization. To be perfeetly candid, it is not up to the maximum of production, due primarily to the faifore to provide adequate salaries throughout the service. Congress did prevent complete disintegration of the Bureau when· it gave recognition to the field officers, and their pay is now fairly commensurate with the duties performed, but there are other highly technical as well as nontechnical employees of the Bureau who have been retained in the senice only through the hope and continued promises of reclassification that have been held out to them; but now that this measure apparently will not be brought to maturity the technical employees and others that are highly qualified, thou~h not members of the technical force, are openly signifying their mtentions of leaving this Bureau to become identified with other branches of the (iovernment service or to enter outside employ. ment where the salaries a.re more commensurate with their abilities ·and the charact('r of work actually performed by them. This will be a loss to the country, to the Bureau, and to the individual, because the Bureau has a field of its own not paralleled anywhere else in this country, and, consequently, the emrloyee leaving the Bureau can not folly apply anywhere else the slnll he has attained in the Bureau, nor can he be replaced by another employee of mature skill and judgment in carrying on the work 0£ the Bureau. The direct failure of the Bureau to function properly at the present time is due to the justifiable dissatisfaction that exists among these employees. They feel, and rightfully so, ~hat they have stood loyally by the J?ureau through the war at a direct monetary loss to themselves, with the anticipation, based on definite promises, that conditions would be righted by recbssification; and, as I have stated in my 1920 annual report, it wns only the zeal, painstaking care, and extra efforts of these seasoned employees, imbued with the old-time trndition that the Bureau should set the standard of scientific exactness, that prevented the disintef,rration which would mean the loss of fidelity of our nautical charts, tide tables, current, magnetic, and triangulation data. It may be of interest to you to know that many of these unclerpai<l technical employees, as well as those of the less technical workers, are compelled to resort to outside work under the most trying conditions in connection with their regular duties in order to make a livelihood. It leads me to express the belief that both the Federal Government and the employees wonld be gainers by the early adoption 0£ higher salaries and a more productive day. Under present conditions not a few bnt many of the employees mnst hurry from this Bureau at the

close of the day to und<.'rtake other duties. Just to cite one specific case: One of the most valued technical men in the Bureau, whose services to the country can not Le measured in dollars, has been compelled to go to his home each night and prepare his and his children's supper, while his wife works at night in order to meet the needs of the family; and each morning, as his wife must rest for another night's work, he prepares his and his children's breakfast, puts up his ~unch, nnd lrnves for his daily work. Isn't t~1is deplorable, and would 1t be tolerated anywhere outside of the (~overnment? There are many more such cases. How long must this go on? Under such conditions neither the Government nor the outside employer can have the services of a vigorous, wide-awake, self-reliant worker, bnt must l~ut up with a :nan wh_ose ~nergy has. been partly spen~; Uf!-d a co:itmuance of tlus practice for a certam per10d results inevitably m the run-down, overworked, nen-ous, and irritable or dejected employee. It would be for more profitable for the Government to ptty ·a higher salary and obtain the best efforts of the employees for ii more productive clay. I can not emphasize too strongly that unless this fundamental trouble is soon corrected a disintegration of the service will continue, with disastrous results of which the Government and the public wi!l feel the effect for years ~o come. The question is, Will the pledge g~vcn some years ago, contmually repeated and as often postponed with the usual excuses, be kept no'v with the men who are the backbone of our Federal institutions, or will the unredeemed ptomises continue to pre mil? (See fig. A, opposite p. 6.) Another phase of the salary question is important enough to bring to .your attention, reiteratin~ wha~ I have said in former reports. It' mvolves the entrance salaries, whJCh are too low to tempt those who have the basic education required for the specific work involved. Instead of being in a position to accept only those who meet the ne.cessary requirements, the Bureau has to take men with inferior qualifications and hold them simply as" temporaries." If they show special aptitude for the work their sojourn in the Bureau is of short duration, for the present rate of pay is too smnll to hold them. They are benefited by the help and coaching of more experienced men, and' then leave for more lucrative positions. The balance of these temporary employees who do not improve nor measure up to a fair standard eventually must be dropped; and so it goes on, year after year, with an annual turnover of 50 to 100 per cent. All this means unrest ttnd disorder, and an unnecessary burden on the division chief and his principal assistants. Their time is wasted when it should be applied to important mattm·R only. The Director's time, too, is more or less taken up with these unfortm1ate conditions. This method of doing business is wasteful, viewed from every angle .. I can.not fill vacancies with inefficient people just because vacancies exist. Until the long-recommended change for equitable salaries is made, just so long will this uneconomical condition exist. I have given you the above facts frankly without obscuring the. actual conditions, just as a manager would submit them to the head of a large business concern. In this Bureau we are endeavoring to give the public a salable article, but with these handicaps the output is proclucecl under unnecessary . difficulties which mean .delay and waste.

CHAPTER II.
THE BUREAU'S MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS.
NEW BUILDING WOULD PAY INTEREST ON INVES'.1'1\1ENT.

The second most serious condition that prevents this Bureau functioning to the fullest extent, and which I have dwelt on at length in previous reports, is the utterly inadequate space in which it is housed, and a lack of proper and sanitary quarters. The Bureau is operating in eight buildings, five larger and three smaller, all but two more or less detached~ and connected as far as it is feasible by communicating bridges. Two of the main buildings were designed and built for dwellings and one of them was used for that purpose. One of the smaller buildings was built for and used as a stable, and another two of the main buildings were designed and constructed for use as a hotel and were rented to the Government for the use in this Bureau from 1871to1891 when they were sold to the Government to house part of this Bureau. As its work centers largely in the construction and production of nautical charts and it is therefore a manufactory, the Bureau operates under a signal handicap in buildings so little suited to its needs. It is a matter of economy to provide a respectable building for this service-it is waste to continue under existing conditions.
CURRENT OBSERVATIONS wrr,L SAVE LIVES AND VESSELS.

During the years from 1900 to 1921 there were stranded or wrecked on the Pacific coast of the United States more than 100 vessels involving a loss of hundreas of lives and millions of dollars in l?roperty, and this in spite of the fact that our navigators on the Pamfic coast comprise .an unusually able, keen, and alert group of men. To a large extent this loss was due to the lack of knowledge of the effects of the currents on the Pacific coast. Had there been adequate knowledge of these currents, a large part of this enoi·mous loss certainly · would have been prevented. In the safeguarding of life and property on the Pacific coast a knowledge of the currents is of the utmost importance·; for in the more than thousand miles of coast line that stretches from the Mexican border to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, harbors are many miles apart2 sailing courses long, and periods o:f thick weather are of comparatively frequent occurrence. ' Appropriations for the observation of currents have to the present time been so small as not to permit the maintenance of a vessel :for making a detailed systematic study of the treacherous and littleknown currents of the Pacific coast. By taking advantage of the five light vessels stationed along the coast, the Survey has at little cost

secured observations which have brought out the important fact that, contrary to the belie:f o:f the mariner, a·wind creates a current not in its own direction, but in a direction about 20° to the right o:f the wind. The importance o:f this discovery lies in the :fact that a wind blowing parallel with the coast may produce a current which tends to set a vessel on the shore, a :fact which un.til now has been unsuspected by the navigator. To bring out to the :full the effects o:f the currents it is necessary to make a systematic study o:f the currents all along the coast. A modest appropriation that will permit the maintenance o:f a vessel for three seasons to secure observations at critical points between the light vessels is needed. Such a survey will bring out the effects o:f both the tidal currents and the wind currents along the whole coast. In this connection it is to be noted that while the Survey at present is engaged in the determination o:f the magnitude and nature o:f the currents that affect navigation, it has at the same time, and at no additional cost, secured data :for a comprehensive study o:f oceanic circll'l.ation, which has an important bearing upon many problems in meteorology, climatology, and related subjects. · . Given th.e modest appropriat~on necessary to carry into effect the plans outlmed for a systematic survey o:f the currents along the Pacific coast, a long step will have been taken toward the safeguarding o:f li:fe and property in the navigation along that coast. The appalling loss of li:fe and property in the wreck o:f the Alaslca on August 7 on the coast o:f California is a compelling argument for the charting o:f the currents on the Pacific coast. Only one explanation o:f the wreck has thus :far been offered. The second officer of the Alaslca declares that an uncharted northeast current dragged the fog-bound ship several miles inshore into the reef.

SURVEYS ON J,AND ARlc WA8'rJ·:1cuL.

The need for control surveys, for precise triangulation, traverse, and levels has reached an acute stage. For years the appropriations for such work have been far short of what they should have been, until now there is an accumul.ation of demands which are so pressing that they command consideration. In Alaska our geodetic surveys are far short of the immediate needs o:f our charts. In southeast Alaska the triangulation has no main scheme control, nor is it as ye.t connected to the North American datum. Western and central Alllska are entirely without control surveys or a connection to the North American datum. For years the Coast and Geodetic Survey has been importuned by other Federal organizationsi.....especially the General Land Office, the Geological Survey, and the 11 orest Service, to supply precise control for the interior o:f Alaska. The proposed international cooperative arc o:f triangulation from PuO'et Sound through southeast Alaska to the Yukon, then down the Yukon and a.cross to Cook Inlet, will do much to relieve the Alaska situation; but at the best that project will require four years to complete. The demands o:f the business interests o:f the Nation for the completion of the topographic map of the entire country are yearly becoming more insistent. The extension o:f the good roads system, the

10

water supply prolil<'ms of the cities, the colonizoation and industrial expansion programs of the railroads, the administration problems of Federal agencies, each in itself would be sufficient reason to complete the topographic map at the rarlirst possible moment at a saving to the country as a whol{'. But preceding the topography must come l'Ontrol surveys, the triangi1lation and levels. vVe are so far in arrears of c11rrcnt <lcmirnds for such snrvevs that an immediate increase in the funds for sneh work is imper·ative. Detailed s11rveys and the attendant control surveys are too intimatc>lv connected with the economy and the welfare of essentinl industries to permit those snrveys to wait longer for a time when funds will be abundant. If fonds are not provided for this Burean to do this pioneer work for which it was creRted, then we must p\'entually pay dearly for the <lelay, mistalws, and disaster which arc bound to develop complications and ultimately lar~cr costs than if the control surveys, etc., were done prior to the detailed mapping work.

OLD

VESSl~LS.

Each year for the last seven years I have 'rndeavorc<l in my an-· nual report to emphasizoe the urgent need for speeding up the hydrographic survey of the waters contiguous to our seacoasts, both at liome and in ~<\.laslm arnl the insular possessions. Much has b~en accomplished in this line by reorganiz;ation of surveying parties, by· improved methods, and by greator uniformity and strindardizoation of methods; but there is, of course, a limit to the amount of work that can lw aecomplislwd by an organization without expansion and without the most efficient tt>ols; arnl I believe that we have now approximated that limit. Further solution of the problem, therefore, appears to dernaml more surveying parties and more and better equipment.' This Bureau is in urgent need of vessels to increase the number of parties that can attack the vast unsurveyed waters under the control of this country, and to bring some of the present parties up to a higher degree of efficiency. It is as unreasonable to expect efficient work from a hydrographic surveying party in a worn-out or otherwise unsuitable vessel as it is to expect good work from a mechan~c with defective tools. Vessels a re the tools of the l~ydrograJ?lnc parties; they have other tools, to be sure, such a8 soundmg machmes and instruments for navigation and surveying, but those are relatively inexpensive, and consequent!~ can be supplied with?ut difficulty from the funds annually provided., Vessels are refat1vely expensive, particularly during recent years, but it can 1Je shown that the annual savings that would accrue from the nse of entirely suitable vessels, instead of antiquated or otherwise unfit vessels, would soon pay for their C()st. · It would undoubtedly be an economical procedure to take some of the. vessels that are no longer required by other organizations of the Government and turn them ovee to the· Coast and Geodetic Survey for hydrographic surveying, if there were any sueh vessels. But, unfortunately, there arc not; at lPast, I have been unable to find any more vessels that could be used by this Bureau which can be spared by the organization to which they are now assigned. All of the vessels that are not now required elsewhere in the <iovernment serv-

ice are either HO large that the cost of open1ting them as snrrny vessels would be prohibitin~. or else they are so vrnrn out and defective that the cost of putting them i11 senice would be an unwarranted outlav on a craft that rnul<l not be made reallv cffici1mt. This subject ,hs gone into thoroughly immediately nft'er the war and seven of the most likely of the Navy's aYailable vessels were taken oyer. Three have been turned hnck as entirely useless :for this work, and the others, with possibly two cxeeptions, arc far from satisfactory. Nor arc there any suitable vessels to he had outside of the Gon~rn mcnt. Vessnls are hu ilt n]ways for a specific use and are designed to best meet the requirements of such. "When put to some radically (lifferent use, there is necessarily loss in efliciency and heavy unproductive expenses. This Bureau has learned from 100 years of experience that economical surveying can be accomplished only with the smallest craft that can be steadily operated on the body of water under survey. It may be a small power bont for entirely sheltered waters; n small st~am or motor vessel where protection is less complete; or an able seagoing vessel where there is no shelter; but in every case the size must be hchl down to a minimum pradirnble :for the nature of the ·vork. It has been found that a seagoing vessel of 1,000 tons disc placement is ample for the largest operations in the most exposed localities, ancl hence this has been fixed as the largest vessel this Bureau is willing to operate. In order to get the necessary personnel and appliancPs into a vessel of this size, it is necessary to gin~ specinJ considerntion to its design; hence, the reason why n perfectly satisfactory vessel for some other purpose does not make a satisfactory surveying vessl'l. Right here it is appropriate to quote what the presPnt eomrnancler of the S1trneyor has to say about the Const and Geo<1Ptie Snney's only modern surveying ship:
H1lYlng been nhoar1l thi:,; shiv Jor about i,ix months ai1tl ahoanl most of the otlwrs in the sel'Yiee fo1· vnrions 1P11gths of ti1111>, my opinion is tlul{ the others should he junked nnrl more like this one gotten. She hns powPr, accommodntions for the nw11, n lnrgp f1wl ea1)ncity-there is no \vorry ns to whether ~-ou will burn l ton of con! too much upon starting for port-ll!Hl she <·an work in rough wcnther. \Ve cnn take al.Joar1l nhout l,000 barrels of oil per hour, the equivalent of 200 tons of <"onl, arnl, at the 1n·e8ent prices of oil nn<l coal, is cheaper to operate than other Yessels of small tonnage. She has stopped and hnclrnd from 10 knots ahead OVC'I' three t11ommnd times rlurlng the vast <·ouple of months, nnd ther<' is n~ry little YihrnUon aft. ']'he chief engineer hn:;; re1lnc<'<l the oil consumption considerably; it varies from 00 to 80 barrels 11er duy when on hydrogTaphy from 10 to 19 hours, and to about 30 barrels llN' 11ny lying idle. '.rhis wssel ct111 or>ernte most economically wlleu n lnr;.:<' nr0n is nssignec1 to the pnrty, so that it will be more or less irnlependent of local wentlwr eomlitions.

The Bureau now operates 11 surveying vessels betwPell 100 and 1,000 tons displacement and 2 nuder 100 tons. 2 of which belong to tlw Philippine Go1'Prnnwnt. Three only of these n~ssels l':lll \York in exposed ]ocalitie;;, and the others m1~st he employed only where ~helter can be~ had during stormy weather. 8eyen of these vessels, large and small, arn r·onsi'dered really efHcient for the work on whieh they can be employed. nncl the othei·s are only makeshifts. This is the (~quipment with ·Yhich the Bureau must keep up to date snrveys of the Atlantic, Gulf. and Pacific.coasts of the United States and extend the hyflrography out to the edge of the continental shelf;

survey Alaska, Porto Rico, Virgin Islands, Hawaii, and the Philippines; and make such special surveys as may be requested by other bureaus of the Government. The Navy has no vessels suited for carrying on hydrographic work with the exception of the mine sweepers. Request has been made by this Bureau for two of these vessels and refused on the ground that they were needed by the Navy .fo~ other duties.
EAI!THQUAKE PI!EDICTIONS VITAL 'I'O HU.M:AN LIVES.

Very recently important seismological investigations have been begun by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and by other agencies, looking toward the prediction of earthquakes. Japanese seismologists already have, to an extent, proved their ability to predict destructive shocks in areas where a detailed study of conditions has been made. Seismologists agree that earthquakes are due to an abrupt adjustment of the accumulated strains in the earth's crust, often accompanied by sudden relative vertical and horizontal displacements of portions of the earth's surface. It is believed that the strains as they accumulate, prior to the actual convulsion, may cause a gradual distortion of the surface of the earth which can be detected by geodetic methods. As a prt!!iminary step, it is necessary to J:aye 4etailed precise tri~ngulation and levels in regio~s of ~eismic actrv1ty m order that studies may be made of gradual distortions or displacements in the earth's crust prior to shock, the character and extent of the displacements at the time of the earthquake, and the extent of the later readjustments of the portions displaced.
AERIAL SURVEYING.

The Mississippi River delta was photog_r~phed by the Air Service
of the Navy during March, April, and May, 1921, for tile use of this Bure11u in revising the chart of this area. Office work on these

photographs is now in progress. Atlantic City, N. J., and the vicinity was p}iotographed in July, 1919, by the Air Services .of the Army and Navy, and almost tJ:e whole of the outer coast lme of New Jersey was photographed m March, 1920, by the Army Air Service. Revised charts of the New Jersey coast are now being compiled, and will soon be issued, showing corrections as obtained from these photographs. .An officer of this Bureau establis~ed the ground control and verified the results of the office compilation, making an examination of the photographic mosaics in the field. . · The results of this work have produced some interesting and important conclusions in regard to chart revision : ( 1) The cost of the revision of the topography of the New .Jersey coast by means of aerial photography is about one-third of the estimated cost by plane-table methods; (2) the inacenracies to which aerial photoc graphs are subjact become negligible when reduced to a scale of 1 : 80,000, the . scale of our coast charts; ( 3) no better historical record could be kept of shore-line changes than that furnished by aerial photographs as every detail is shown. Owing to lack of trained personnel, the Air Services of the Army and Navy have not been able so far to carry out a program of

photographing portions\, of the Atlantic coast as requested by this Bureau for the purpose of chart revision. The situation is improving and these services are planning to cooperate more fully in the near future. An officer of this Bureau has devoted practically all of his time during. the year to the study of this subject and in keeping in touch with developments. Instruments for use in compiling data are being acquired. In June of this year a mathematician was assigned to devote alart of his time to the study of the mathematical problems connecte with aerial surveying. A draftsman was also detailed for a portion of his time in order to become familiar with the process of compilation of data from photographs. In this way preparations are being made to handle photographs as they are received from the Air Services. The nucleus of an office and field force is being formed, so that when the time comes that the Air Services will be able to make extensive photographic surveys the Coast and Geodetic Survey will be ready to do its part with a small increase in personnel and the charts of the United States will be clo~er to perfection, as far as topographic features are concerned, than they ever have been before. Too much stress can not be laid on this successful method of re: vising our shore topography, emphasizing accuracy, economy, and speed. But the Coast and Geodetic Survey does not maintain airships and seaplanes, and unless there is greater cooperation from the .A:i:·iny and Navy Air Services valuable time will be lost in supplying for charts and maps important information for commercial purposes on.-sea and land.
ALASKA.

There has been much said about Alaska and the develo_Pment of her resources, and while the Federal Government should give every encouragement to the upbuilding of her great frontier country the primary p.nd important need of Alaska at the present time is a complete charting of her great area of coastal waters and control surveys and levels in her interior. Is it not good business to safeguard in every way possible the lives and property and wealth of a country, and to establish sure and perfectly charted lanes to other markets~ Is it not a good investment to make an outlay of a comparatively small sum of money to make vast wealth a vi1ilable ~ · The Coast and Geodetic Survey must have suitable ships, men, equipment, etc., so that we can as quickly as possible chart safe and well-established lanes through which commerce can pour at will. All the mines in the country would be useless, all the railroads futile, if the products could only be brought to Alaska's shores and then be lost. Enough shipping has ended fatally these past years to provie the need and advisability of locating dangerous reefs and rocks and other dangers and making accurate and safe charts. TQe outstanding needs are indicated as follows : About 7.000 square miles of water area in southeastern Alaska remains to 'be wire dragged, but a part of this area is not frequented by lurge vessels to-day, and may not be for some years hence. However, this work should not be delayed until some vessel is lost dl.le to an uncharted pinnacle rock. The main steamer route will be com-

pletely dragged this yettr from Dixons Entmnce nearly to the head of Lynn Canal. The balance of this route <lown Chatham Strait to Joy Strait, and thence through Icy Strait arnl Cross Sound to the Pacific, should be completed next year. The additional work required to be done along the deep-draft steamer route, via Sumner Strait, Chatham Strait, and Frederick Sound, probably will be completed year after next. Thereafter the drag parties will be a-yailable to take up the other steamer routes in the order of their importance. It is believed tlrn,t wire-drag work in southea~tern Alaska is fairly well in haml now and that we have, or will have next year, equipment for carrying this work to completion ns rapidly as possible. In Prince ""\Villiam Sound there is it large amount of drag work that should be undertaken as soon as equipment is available, and the need for this work is almost as urgent as for the southeastern Alaska work. That the improved wire drag fulfills its puqwse is shown by the fact that in the 4,000 square miles of ·rntel' area dragged, :3,500 uncharted obstructions ha Ye.been discovered, a nnmber of which were close to if not actually on the lines of ocean travel. A fast-moving liner striking a pinnacle rock in just the right 'vay would suffer the fate of the Titanic, no matter what precautions were taken. In the matter of offshore k!Jdrof11·aphy~ the Survey is most seriously handicapped by lack of vessels snitabfo ·for this work. From Dixons Entrance to ('ape Spencer there nre ~tbout 12,000 square miles yet to be SUl'YeyeJ. From. Prince vV illiam Sound to u nalaska there are 40,000 sqnare miles that should be surveye(l immediately. AH of this work requires able seagoing ressels, of which we h:we available just one, the Survw1;01·. It, therefore, appears that the most serious problem confrontmg this Bureau is the outside sutTey and in particular the outside surveys of western Alaska. This, for the reason that, while we.yet have much work to be done in southeastern Alaska and in Prince \Villiam Sound, we have vessels that can be employed on this work and some of it can he accomplished by large launches, of which '.Ye have a few available, and will have others when the wire-drag work is completed; but on the outside work we are entirely dependent on one vessel. This very important part of the United States has been sailly neglected. Not only a1·e the fiehl surveys of Alaska far in arrears, but in addition it has been impossible to produce accurate charts of many areas of which s1irYeys have been made. Tl~e subject oi' corrections of our Alaska charts iwesents a different but equally serions and difficult problem. The rapid development of that Territory combined. with our insufficient facilities for making adequate surveys as rapidly us that devdopment demanded has l'<>Stilted in a condition from which we are still suffering and under the inost favorable circumstances must continue to suffer for some years to come. Owing to the insistent demand for Alaska charts the first surveys were rushed. They were nothing more than l'econnoissances. The control was erude; signal positions were plotted graphically on the survey sheets before they were computed. Evtir since those chai·ts were constructed we have been making surveys to be applied to them. But in order to apply such a new survey to the small-scale charts we must distort it to fit the dis-

REPORT 01<' DIRECTOR, CO/$£ AND GEODETIC SURVEY;

15

to1'ted chart or else construct an entire new chart to fit the survey. It is an actual fact that to-day if a wire-drag party reports a newly discovered dang.er by giving its latitude and longitude we can not plot it on -0ur charts in its accurate relation to adjacent features until we know the chart or shQ.et from which the i)osition was taken. If this were the whole story, the solution of the present condition would be an immediate adjustment of the existing Alaskan triangulation and subsequent reconstruction of our charts to conform·thereto. But the matter is still further complicated. We ~1ave just begun the field work on a main scheme of triangulatfon through southeastern Alaska and the Canadian Government is ca:i;rying a similar scheme through British Colmnbin, by means of which our Alaska triangulation will be connected with that of th1:l United States. When these two measurements are completed all the southeastern Alaska triangulation will be adjusted to the North American standard datum. But to make any adjustment of triangulation 1wior to such completion wonld involve months of work, which would all have to be done over when the final connection was made. 'When this triangulation is adjusted almost all of the charts will have to be made over. As we lack the draftsmen necessary to undertake this work, the preliminary adjustment could not in the near future be utilized to an extent sufficient to justify its cost to the short-handed division of geodesy. Onr future policy should be to apply the essential information obtained from new sunreys and to postpone forther reconstruction of small-scale charts until the triangulation is completed and adjusted, by which time it is hoped that the force of draftsmen will have been increased sufficiently to ennble ns to take up a systematic reconstruction of all necessary southeastern Alaska charts. I am informed that the 'York of the Canadian Government may possibly be completed this calendar year, an<l if not that we may expect· its completion in rn22. In my opinion, therefore, it now b(~comes of first importance that the divisions concerned study this subject carefully to ascertain precisely what additional datn, are needed for a complete adjustment of all southeastern Alaska surveys, to the end that any field work which may be required :for sui)plementing our present control <la.ta may be furnished this office by the time the C1madians furnish their pnrt of the task. The control is needed along the whole Alaskan coast, and·should be rapidly compl~ted. . In the intenor of Alaska we have no :fundamental control surveys whatever. This is not a creditable condition of affairs. ThB U. S. Geological Survey, the General I..1and Office, and the Forest Service are carrying on their operations in furthering the industrial and commercial development of Alaskn, but are badly handicapped by lack of accurate latitudes, longitudes, nnd elevations for the proper location of suneys and maps. Every year's delay in starting the control s~rveys in Alus~rn aggravates the confus10n and retards the suneyrng and mappmg of the area which arc so essential to its development. 1'he yearly increa.~e in the p1'oducti1Jity of Alasl~a, re8ulting fi·om the control .~U1"l'ey8, 'Will be greater tlian tlle enti1:e cost of tliese surveys.

HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.

The increased commercial importance of the Hawaiian Islands makes it desirable to carry on hydrographic surveys in the waters surrounding them. At present there are many parts of the island coasts along which there are no soundings ·whatever and the water between islands is frequently inade~uately surveyed. There are many places in the waters surroundmg the Hawaiian Islands at which current observations should be made. The more adequate charting of the waters of the Hawaiian Islands and of the reefs to the westward of this group ig necessary both to save life and property and to save time to the ships in sailing from island ports to various points in the Pacific. There are many places where the waters are dangerous because of submerged reefs while at the same time there are undoubtedly safe channels between the reefs, but in the absence of accurate charts the navigator does not dare venture in the dangerous zone. . · This matter of charting the waters of the Hawaiian group is of such importance that urgent appeals have· been made to the Coast and Geodetic Survey by the governor of the islands and by com-" mercial bodies at the important ports of the group, requesting that the completion of the charting of the Hawaiian waters be expedited. In addition to the charting of the waters there is work ashore in the form of primary triangulation to properly coordinate the charts and maps of the several islands. . Without this precise control the charts and maps of the group can not be carried on to the best ad· vantage. The U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Territorial government, is now making topographic maps on some of the islands and in this work triangulation which has been done by the Coast and Geodetic Survey and by the government of the Hawaiian Islands before annexat10n to the Umted States, is being used. This triangulation has never been properly computed and adjusted and this should be undertaken at an early date. The expense would be small, but the benefits to the charting and mapping would be very great. Practically no work has been done in the Hawaiian group for a number or years by the Goa.st and Geodetic Survey because of lack of proper equipment and madequate funds and also because of the necessity of using such equipment, funds, and personnel as we have on the coastal waters of the United States and Alaska, but the time has certainly arrived when this neglect of the Hawaiian Islands should cease. Their importance to the country is very great, as is shown by their commerce, and it would seem that some part of the activities of the Federal Government should be directed toward giving the islands the charting and mapping facilities needed in their further industrial and commercial development.
OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH ESSEN'l'IAL

·ro

NA'l'ION's WELFARE.

Another subject that should receive early attention by this Burea;n is · ocean surveys. From 1845 until 1860 the Coast and Geodetic Survey, then known as the Coast Survey, employed one or more vessels almost continuously on deep-sea hydrography in the Atlantic Ocean contiguous to our coast and principally along the Gulf Stream.

REPORT 01!' DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

17

This work was interrupted between 1860 and 1867, but was then resumed and was carried forward with only short interruptions until 1890. Since that time this Bureau has made only minor contributions to our previous knowledge of the deep waters off our shores, and through which all our shipping, except the coustwise, must pass. The earlier work was performed mostly from sailing vessels .and ·with such crude apparatus that incomplete and often contradictory results were obtained. The later work, particularly that of Mitchell, Sigsbee, Bartlett, and Pillsbury, was excellent, . but was, of course, limited in detail to the capacity of the instruments that had been devised up to their time. This work, however, was confined to the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea, and principally to an exploration of the Gulf Stream; it was discontinued, not because sufficient information had been obtained or any of the large problems of oceanography had been solved but·,because vessels were no longer a'lailable for this work and also to carry on inshore surveying, the demand for which had been insistent. Consequently, investigations in oceanography had to give way to hydrography that was more urgently needed than by our merchant marine. Since the war there has developed a very urgent demand for more exact information concerning the oceans, and in particular the Atlantic and th~ Pacific. · This demand comes from scientists as well as from mariners, fishermen, and cartographers, and the information sought concerns the advancement and welfare of the country in many respects. There would result from a better knowledge of the oceans direct savings from a decreased loss of ships, their passengers, and cargoes, fr<;m shorter. and quicker passages, and from reduced passenger, freight, and msurance rates because of the greater sa:fety. There would result a better knowledge of the present fishing banks, the discovery of new fishing banks, and a better knowlerlge of the distribution and movement of food fishes and of their food, which would have an enormous economic value to the country. A better knowledge of the configuration of the ocean bottoms, of the materials deposited upon those bottoms, and of the ocean currents may result in discoveries that will materially modify our ideas of some of the laws of nature. Meteorology is believed to be closely related to oMan conditions, and it seems more than probable that systematic observation of meteorological data over the oceans will contribute to more complete and more dependable weather forecasts. · Ocean surveys should be resumed in the Atlantic for the purpose of supplementing and extending our earlier surveys. Unexplored areas off our coast should be examined and a sufficient number of soundings taken to give at least a general knowledge of the relief of the bottom. Where the· earlier surveys are known to have been made with C·rude apparatus and by doubtful methods, a reexamination should be made to verify the earlier work and, if found to be appreciably in error, these ttreas should be resurveye~. Accompanying the hydrography there should be taken a sufficrnnt number of observations of current, density, temperature. and salinity to permit n, thorough study of the ocean currents. These are the phases of oceanography that come properiy within the scope o:f activities of

this Bureau, but there appears to be no reason why other investigations in oceanography could not be conducted at the same time at small additional cost by scientists detailed to the party from the bureaus having cognizance of such subjects. In the Pacific the same lines of investigation should be carried out, but there even a beginning has hardly been made; the areas of totally unexplored ocean are of vast dimensions. There is reason to believe that fishing banks of which we have no reliable information may lie just outside our coastal waters; the supposed locutions of these banks should be investigated without delay. Off the southern California coast and also westward from the Hawaiian Islands arc dangerous reefs in the track of our shipping. Until these and other uncertain areas are thoroughly explored we may expect unavoidable wrecks and loss of life. Within the last few years great advancement has been made in instruments for precise measurement of ocean currents, temperature, and salinity; and by means of radio communication and radio direction determination the position of a vessel at sea can be fixed with far greater accuracy than was possible at the time of our last oceanographic work. We are therefore justified in expecting much more accurate investigation in oceanography now than has ever been possible heretofore. The Pan-Pacific Scientific Conference which met at Hawaii during August, 1920, adopted the following resolution: ·
Oceanographic investigations yield results which constitute a basis essential for scientific exploration and research in the Pacific region, notably in meteorology, geology, botany, and biology. Moreover, such investigations are of importance to navigators in disclosing clangers to vei;;sels sailing the ocean, and are of economic Yalue in enabling vessels to snve time and fuel in their navigation. The present knowledge of the oceanography of the Pacific is deficient in every branch, and constitutes but a meager array of data scattered widely. In the oceanographic investigation of the Pacific waters the configuration of . the bottom sl10uld be determined, specimens of the bottom deposits collected and their thickness and stratification revealed, the physical imd chemical characterlsties of the water at different depths and times determined, and the horizontal and vertical circufotion of the waters observed. The field work involved in such investigations must be curried on almost entirely by the governmental' hydrographic organizations of the countries bordering on and containecl within the P~cific Ocean, owing to the great expens1~ involved in creating new and special agencies, and because the governmental agencies have the personnel trained in this worlc Those carrying on oceanographic surveys in the Pacific should avail themselves of the services and advice of individuals and organizntions dealing with those branches of science depending upon the results of such surveys. This conference feels tllat a systematic oceanogrnpllic inVL>stigation of the Pacific should be undertaken as soon as possible. 'l'he plan adopted should be designed to complete the survey of the most critical areas at an early <late, and eventually the whole Pacific region.

To undertake this work a vessel specially adapted is essential, and it should be kept continuously on the work, in order to accomplish definite results, much that the country should already know about. The failure to have undertaken oceanographic work years ago only emphasizes the fact that soon our country will be looking for certain information regarding the seven seas, just as the farmer seeks information about his land, and it wilJ not be available. The work · should not be put off.

The manuscripts for several other publications are in course of preparation and at least two of them are ready for publication. namely, Triangulation in Massachusetts, nncl Precise Leveling in Texas. In addition to the routine work of the division, several special problems have been studied nnd investigations made. These include a study of the rnoyement of .the earth's crust in the earthquake region of California, a study of earth dynamics in connection with the Stokes theorem, and a continuation of the study of map projections. This Bnreau has become orie of the leaders of the world in geodetic work largely because the methods for carrying on the work are being improved continually by careful study and experiments, both in the field and office. A scientific bureau like this must devote a part of its energies to this class of work if it would progress rather than retrograde. The number of computers or mathematicians, who were assigned to the division of geodesy at the Washington office, varied s~ightly from month to month during the year. The average force durmg the year was 18.6 persons . · ·whenever an engineer from the field was brought to the vVashington office, after a season's work on geodesy, he was assigned to the division of geodesy, but these field engineers were engaged most of the time wlule here in preparing reports on their phst season's work, in completing their field records, and in preparing for a new season's W()rk. Very little work, therefore, was done by them to supplement what is being accomplished by the regular computing force. The duties of the division of geodesy at the Washington office consist largely of the admi~istration of the office and field forces; the computatlon and adjustment of triangulation, including astronomic observations; the computation and adjustment of precise leveling; the computation of field observations made for the determination of the intensity of gravity and researches in the subject of isostasy in which gravity determinations play an important part; geophysics in the form of research of the subject of the strength of the earth's crust or isostatic shell and certain physical properties of the material of that shell; and furnishing information to officials of

the Coast and Geodetic Survey and 0th.er Government organizations and to the public in response to written or oral requests. As soon as practicable after the computation and adjustments of the field observations are made at this office, the results are printed in order that they may be available for general use. ·
DIVISION OF HYDUOGRAPIIY AND TO.POGHAPHY.

This division has supervision of all hydrographic and topographic surveys executed by the Bureau, which supervision includes--determination of where surveys or resurveys arc required, how they shall be conducted, the preparation of instructions for surveying parties, the organization of the parties, the examination of the records, and inspection of field work. The division is also charged with the construction, maintenance, and, repnirs of the vessels and other field equipment (except instruments), the records of the se111nen employed on this work, and the compilation of the coast pilot in the field an<l office. The division also has sufnervision oYer the fi vc field stations locatell .at. Boston, New. York, New Orleans, Seattle. and San Francisco, respectively, and over the office at Manila, P. I. The field stations are for the purpose of maintaining i;lose relations between the Bureau and those who have occasion to use its charts, publications, and data, and to keep the Bureau informed of the needs for further work in these general localities. The office work incident to the above duties was kept current during the year.
DIV18ION OJ<' QHAR'l'S.

The energies of the division <luring the year h~we been devoted, first, to keeping our charts in print an<l keeping them corrected from all new informittion received m the Bureau; and, second, to striving for improvements in facilities, processes, and morale, so ns to increase our production without any corresponding increase in expenditure. Under the first heading the division has lived up to the admirable record of previous years. Back orders have been kept down, in general, to a few charts at a tim~ and these have bet>n on the back-order list for short periods only. information that has come to the office necessitatino- the correction or addition to charts has been applied promptly. There has been· considerable increase in such information received during the year, due, no doubt, to renewed activities by the various o-overnmental surveying organizations. IssUE OF 6HAR'l's.-As was expected, the prevailing stagnation of the merchant marine has been reflected in a reduction of the number of charts issued during the year, though the reduction was less than had been anticipated. Slightly less charts were issued than in 1919 or 1920, but aside from these two y-ears the issue for 1921 was the largest in the Bureau's existence. The following shows the issues for the years from 1916 to 1921: 1916, 176,395; 1917, 248,144; 1918, 236,577; 1919, 302,155; 1920, 31G,699; 1921, 290,188. The diagram opposite grnphically presents the issue from 1896 to 1921, inclusive. The lar§crest item in the reduction of issue of charts. was in the issue to the hipping Board, which fell off from 21,707 in 1909 and 25,843 in 1920 to 6,400 in 1921.

ISSUE OF COAST PILOTS, INSIDE ROUTE PILOTS, AND TIDE TA.'BLl]S.-

The same influence that diminished the distribution of charts, the prevailing stagnation of the merchant marine, has also shown its effect in the distribution of coast pilots, and from a distribution of 15,261 in 1920 the issue fell off to a distribution of 8,728 in 1921. The diagram opposite presents graphically the distribution of coast pilots from 1901 to 1921, inclusive. The issue of Inside Route Pilots, mstead of decreasing has increased, the issue for 1921 being 2,655 or 571 greater than for any other year. There was a slight decrease in the distribution of tide tables, though not material, the issue for 1920 being 24,887 and the issue :for 1921 being 24,212. CoNSTRUC'I'ION OF NEW CHARTs.-Although the construction 0£ a new chart (involving the assembly- of data, drafting, engraving, and printing) , is not an entirely satisfactory unit of measurement of progress because the details for each new chart are not uniform, the progress in the construction of new charts during the fiscal year is very gratifying. This is due in a large measure to a program that was adopted on September 18, 1920, with the object of both expediting and increasing our production of new charts. Preceding the adoption of this program a tabulation of the cost in time and money of producing 11 new charts published during the year had been made. The most striking fact brought out by this tabulation was the length of time required to produce a new chart. The longest time required was 54 months, the shortest 15 months; the average for all charts was 27 months; for engraved charts, 35 months; and photolithographed charts, 22 months. This lapse of time was out of all proportion to the actual cost of producing the chart. Each chart required an average of seven to eight months of actual working time to produce. 'l'his excessive lapse of time was due to the fact that preference must be given to correction of existing charts and because of these interruptions the actual time required to produce charts was increased by approximately 15 to 20 per cent. To improve this situation a definite program was drawn for the work during the fiscal year. The program called for the production of 19 new charts. The program was drawn with the end in view that each man should be kept continuously on one job until he had finished it. The success of the plan laid down in the program exceeded expectations. The program was necessarily modified for reasons beyond the control of those in administrative charge of the division, yet in spite of these modifications it was completed during the year. Although the pro. gram was necessarily somewhat in the nature of an experiment, it has demonstrated the value o:f the idea of giving th~ division as a whole a definite objective for the year's work, and in so far as possible of giving each employee in th~ division a definite part of that worR to perform. The following table compares the production during 1921 with other recent years during which the great increase in the demand for charts has so materially increased the work of the division. In this table Philippine Island charts are listed separately, as these {)harts are drawn in Manila and the work of the Washington office is confined to their printing.

The new chart production for 1921 is a 50 per cent increase over ·any one year and a 13 per cent increase over the average for the period on which a comparison may fairly be based. It is to be noted particularly that this result was accomplished while handling, without slighting, a greatly increased amount of correction work. PHO'l'OLITHOGRAPHIC REPRODUCTION OI<' ENGRAVED CHAR'l's.-An improvement of first importance in our methods of reproducing charts from engraved copper plates has been worked out during the year. Our previous method of lithographic reproduction from copper was to pull an impression from the copper plate upon a specially prepared paper which was then laid down ·on the aluminum prl.nting plate and run through the press, thus transferring the work from paper to plate. This method was defective in two respects, first, the printed chart was distorted, the distortion in some cases amounting to as much as 3 per cent; this was due to the fact that the transfer paper used was so light that in stripping it from the copper plate it was pulled out of shape. Second, the method involved a considerable duplication of correction work in the engraving and printing sections. Each time a chart was reprinted corrections were mad:e to the printing plate by the lithographic draftsman. With a lapse of time, however, it becomes necessary to produce a new printing plate either because the existing plate has become imperfect with use, or because extensive new information has been received wliich can not readily be applied directly to that plate. When either of these contingencies occurs the copper plate must be corrected for all in-

24

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC 'SURVEY.

formation received since it was last used in order that a new correct imi:>ression may be pulled from it for use in the transfer. Furthermore, the correction of the copper plates is a tedious and laborious process and any method whichmaterially reduces the amount of such correction will result in a considerable saving. By the new method the paper used in making the transfer is an unsensitized, highly glazed bromide paper. This paper is first coated on the back with a solution in water of flour, starch, glycerine, and gelatine, which is allowed to dry. In wetting the paper, as is necessary for it to pull the ink from the copper plate, this adhesive solution becomes tacky. In pulling the impression the paper is first laid on the copper plate and over if is placed a sheet of heavy blotting paper. When run through the press these two papers stick firmly together and the combined strength of the two is such that there is no distortion in pulling the paper from the plate, while the dry blotting paper prevents any subsequent change in the wet bromide paper as the latter dries. The result is a sharp intensely black impression of the work on the copper strongly contrasted against the glazed surface of the paper furnishing an ideal subject for photolithography. From this point the process is similar to the regular l)hotolithographic method, the one point to be noted being that muc 1 less work is required iu recutting these negatives than is necessary for negatives of vellum tracings. By this method, therefore, the distortion which hitherto existed in charts produced either directly or indirectly from copper is entirely eliminated. Our charts are now, at least from the point of view of the navigator, true to scale. The duplication in correction work will also be greatly reduced. Corrections which formerly made it necessary to bring up the copper plate can now be made on the negatives. Some corrections will still have to be made on copper, but these will occur at much more infrequent intervals where the correction is so extensive that in a photolithographic chart they would require a new drawing. Here no duplication should be involved, as such a correction would not be made in the printing office. This method is probably the best of those in use in this office for the production of new charts for the following reasons: First, the work of the past year has demonstrated that on the average chart where the hydrography predominates and where the topography is much simplified and generalized a new chart can be engraved about as cheaply and as rapidly as a vellum tracino- can be made. Second, the copper is permanent and a plate would be in good condition long after the vellum tracing is worn out. Third, corrections must still be made occasionally on either copper or vellum. On the vellum~ as a rule, not more than one correction can be made in any given area, whereas by means of the electrotyping process the number of corrections in any area on the copper is unlimited. Fourth, we sometimes receive corrections so extensive that it is cheaper to make a new tracing than to attempt to correct the existing one. This, of course, means redrawing much information which is still corect on the old tracing. By means of the electrotyping process these. corrections can be made on copper probably in somewhat greater time but at less cost than that of the new tracing. Fifth, the copper

plate is a valuable insurance against loss by fire or accidental damage to tracing or negative. vVe have to-day in our files tracings which would have to be made over i:f one o:f the negatives :from them should be accidentally broken. This method has been on trial :for almost a year, and it is considered that its practicability and value have been demonstrated. Nineteen charts are now on plates produced by this process, and their number will be increased as rapidly as the :facilities of the Bureau will permit. It should be noted that this method involves an increase in the' work o:f the lithographic draftsman and in consequence that its extensive adoption will necessitate an increase in that :force.· It is believed, however, that such an increase can be made at tlie expense of the drafting and engraving sections without involving any net increase o:f the personnel o:f the division. NJ<JW CAJ\HcRA.-A camera :for the production o:f photolithographic negatives is now in operation. This camera was designed and plans drawn in this Bureau along lines stwgested by the Bureau o:f Standards and with the cooperation o:f that bureau. Its design includes some novel :features not usually incorporated in cameras :for this work. The two essentials to good photolithographic negatives are sharpness of de~nition and accuracy of scale. The former is secured by properly timed exposures through a good lens. To secure the latter the drawing in the copy holder must be accurately parallel to the sensitized plate. In order to secure this condition in the new camera the depth of the box to which the plate holder is attached has been considerably ·increased and the box is screwed firmly to the base upon which the camera rests; :focusing being accomplished by move ing the front box carrying the lens. The copy holder is capabl~ of minute adjustment by means o:f bolts at the ends o:f the beam agamst which it rests. The use of this camera has materially facilitated our photolithographic production of charts. Our negatives are now exact to sc-ale and match perfectly, whereas with the previous camera we had considerable difficulty, not only having frequently to make over negatives a second or third time, but also being compelled to make arbitrary junctions ~here the negatives did not join properly. Before, where one negative of a set of four or six was bad, the whole set had to be made over; now we can make over that one negative with assurance that it will fit the others. · ENGRAVING SEcTION.-The work accomplished by the section during the year and that in hand at its close is as :follows:

TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

The results of observations made at the Sitka and Tucson observatories during 1917 and 1918 were submitted for publication and proof of the publications was read. The reduction' of the results of observations at the Porto Rico Observatory for the same period was completed and prepared for publication. The correction of the horizontal intensity results at Cheltenham, required by the fact that the magnet of the variometer was not in the prime vertical, was made and the reduction of the results was completed. · The reduction of the results of all of the observatories for 1919 was nearly completed and good progress was made with those for 1920. ' The results of field observations made during 1920 were revised and published as Special Publication No. 72. Revision was made of the comparison observations at the observatories for standardization of instruments. The earthquakes recorded during the year have been tabulated and published month by month in the Mont~ly Weather Review .. A new edition of Directions for Magnetic Measurements, involving considerable changes and additions, was prepared and sent to the printer just before the close of the fiscal year. To meet the continued demand for Special Publication No. 33, Distribution of the· Magnetic Declination in the United States for 1915, a reprint of that publication was ordered. An examination was' made of the results of absolute observations of horizontal intensity at the different observatories to determine whether there was a systematic change of distribution coefficient with time and also to determine whether the temperature coefficient required any modification. . Comparison was made of the acti':'ity of th~ earth's magnetism m 1915 at the Cheltenham and Seddm magnetic observatories and the results were presented in a paper at the annual meetinO' of the section of terrestrial magnetism and electricity of the American Geophysical Union.

DIVISION OF TIDES AND OURRE]).'TS.

The growing importance of the tidal and current work of the Sur- . vey rendered advisable the creation of the division of tides and currents out of the section of that name. This change was made on December 15, 1920. The work of this division is comprised under the following heads: Tidal observations and computations; advance prediction of tides and currents, and preparation of the annual tidal and current tables; current observations and computations; tidal and current surveys of our principal harbors; physical oceanography, and the preparation of technical publications dealing with tides, currents, and related phenomena. Tidal observations and reductions were made at seven principal stations on the Atlantic coast, three on the Gulf coast, three on the Padfic coast, and three in Alaska. · Observations and reductions of currents were made at 10 light vessels on the Atlantic coast and 5 on the Pacific. Computations on the relation between wind and current were made for the light-vessel observations on the Pacific coast, in order to correlate wind and current for the preparation of current diagrams :for the aid of the navigator in estimating the current due, both to tide and wind effects, to which his vessel is subject. The results of this work are of prime importance to shipping on that coast, and will appear as a separate current table :for the year 1923, the tables for 1922 having already been issued. The predictions of tides and currents for the 1922 tide tables were made and the manuscript submitted :for printing in three separate parts: Tide Tables, Atlantic Coast; Tide Tables, Pacific Coast; and Tide Tables, United States and Foreign Ports. These publications are now available for distribution. In connection with the publication of the tide tables for 1922, alterations were made in the J?.resentation of the predictions, with a view to making them more easily used, and more uniform in appearancethe high and low waters, and the time and height being given in separate columns.

The total disbursements from July 1, 1920, to June 30, 1921, were $1,962,998.46, which sum does not, however, represent the expenses for the fiscal year. The itemization of the expenditures under each appropriation is reported to Congress in a special report later when all accounts for the fiscal year have been received. These expenditures were made throughout the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico, the Philippines, and the Virgin Islands. From 30 to 50 chiefs of party were engaged on field work at various times, being financed through advances made to them by the disbursing agent.
CHIEF CLERIC

The principal duties of this division are the care, custody, and upkeep of the buildings occupied by the Bureau; the supervision of the expenditures from the appropriation for office expenses, including the purchase of supplies for the office, for chart printing work, and to some extent for the field; the care and custody. of most of the original records of the field surveys, as well as the library of printed publications kept for the use of the Bureau; the general supervision of all matters relating to the personnel work of the Bureau, including records of leaves of absence taken; the custody and accounting for the receipts for the sale of charts and publications, etc. ; and the direction of the watch, engineer, electrician, labor, and messenger force of the Bureau and other employees connected with the care and protection of the buildings. The more important accomplishments during the year have. been: Planning the thorough renovation of the buildings occupied by the Bureau. This work has been partly accomplished. Forty rooms

and six halls (a total area of 54,795 square feet) have been thoroughly cleaned and painted. By the aid of an electric-driven floorsurfacing machine the floors of some very unsightly halls have been cleaned of the upper surface of dirt and grease, and old paint and the exposed clean s·urface of the wood has been dressed with linseed oil and shellac, so that the halls now present a very pleasing and sanitary appearance; the poorly arranged electric wiring in many rooms has been removed and replaced by indirect lighting that yields the same luminosity in every part of the rooms without casting shadows and with practically the same cost in consumption of electric current as when the inefficient glaring lights were used. Some alterations have been made in the buildings th8<t have decidedly improved working conditions and expedited the conduct of business. Most important of these is the removal of one of two stairways where both served the same purpose in the Butler Building and using th.e resulting space for library stacks, thus relieving the serious congestion in the library, and by cutting two doorways making all parts of the library accessible without fong detours. A contract was placed to install modern shelving in one of the rooms of the library in which are stored on wooden shelves the original field records of the Bureau, which cost probably more than $1,000,000 to produce, and which could not be replaced short of resurveys.' With this modern shelving the fire hazard will be practically eliminated. Another improvement was the building of a short and inexpensive bridge joining the printing office of the chart-paper storage room and the rear Richards Building, thus permitting the chart paper to be loaded on trucks in the storage rooms and wheeled directly to the printing presses, whereas before it was necessarily carried by hand over a long detour up and down flights of stairs. Alterations that permit the more expeditious conduct of business were also made in the rooms occupied as the Director's office and in other parts of the buildings. r~egislation has been enacted authorizing the Survey to obtain heat and light from the Capitol Power Plant. The necessary installations to permit this are practically completed. It is quite certain that there will be a very considerable ultimate saving to the Government, as it is understood that the steam generated by the C11pitol Power Plant is practically a by-product. Heretofore, the eight buildings occupied by the Survey have been heated by four lowpressure boilers, involving the purchase of coal, employment of ~re men, and the removal of ashes, as well as the upkeep of the heatmg plants. · · It is worthy of mention that the cost of the care, maintenance, upkeep, and operation of the buildings occupied by the Bureau has been reduced from 44 cents. per square foot for the fiscal year 1920 to slightly more than 29 cents per square foot for the fiscal year 1921. An activity during the year somewhat apart from the general routine of the duties of the office of the chief clerk has been to place the data resulting from the surveys by the Bureau more readily at the disposal of the public. The triangulation stations, magnetic stations, and bench marks resulting from surveys made by this Bureau in the interior of the country are very numerous, and in published form many large volumes are requ1red to contain the data regarding them. For example, there are five quarto volumes containing the rmmlts for the State of Illinois, weighing 14 pounds,

30

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

containing a total of 2,370 pages and costing $3.06 to print. Formerly when a request was made for data resulting from our surveys in the State of Illinois the custom was to send some or all of these volumes to supply the information. To provide a definite guide or index to our results a small and inexpensive digest has been prepared. This digest costs about 3! cents to print. It contains a base map of the State showing graphically where our surveys have been made and a tabular arrangement of the counties of the State, the places in the county where surveys have been made, and the publications of the Bureau containing the results. Now when an inquiry is received one of these digests is sent the correspondent, and he is enabled to find exactly what he wants without any guesswork resulting in a request for more or less costly publications. The public has appreciated these efforts. Two letters from civil engineers are quoted below:
I think your plan of notifying the interested parties of the information which is available is very good, and I shall be glad to avail myself of it when the occasion arises. It has seemed to me in the past that some such practice which you seem to have adopted was very necessary, in view of the fact that such a large amount of information is assembled and printed, the average man being entirely unaware of its existence. As your letter implies, antl from my own personal experience, I am led to believe that a large majo1ity of the civil engineers of this State do not avail themselves of the great fund of engineering data contained in your publications, maps, plats, etc. I also believe that this serious oversight on the part of engineers does not result from lack of appreciation of the value of this service by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey but, on account of the lack of publicity, the engineers do not know of the excellent service your Bureau is capable of rendering our profession.

By the close of the fiscal year such pamphlets had been printed and distributed :for the following States: Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, and Nebraska. In the. library and archives 32 hydrographic and 30 topographic shee~s, each representing new surveys made by the Bureau, were received. Other additions to the library and archives were:

Serial No. 159. Relation Between Plane Rectangular Coordinates and Geographic Positions. By Wnlter F. Reynolds. Special Publication No. 71. 90 pp. 2 text figs. Octavo. The control surveys over large areas the size of a State or the whole United States are necessarily made and computed by the use of geographical coordinates (latitudes and longitudes) because of the curvature of the earth. For this reason the results of triangulation in publications of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the United States Geological Survey, and the United States Corps of Engineers are always given in geographic coordinates, for the triangulation in any of these publi· cations either covers a large area or is joined to the triangulation scheme of the whole United States. When all the points of a survey are located within a relatively small area the use of plane coordinates instead of geographic coordinates is much more convenient. The object of this publication is to enable the engineer to convert geographic into plane coordinates readily and quickly or to convert plane coordinates bacl;: into geographic coordinates if desired.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY. DIVISION OF TIDES AND CURRENTS.

39

The prog-ram :for this division for the year ending June 30, 1922, is as follows: The tide tables for 1923 will be completed, scanned for the removal o:f errors, and sent to the printer. The Current Tables for 1923, a new publication, will be completed during the year and sent to the printer. The sounding records received :from the hydrographic parties will be checked as received, so that no delay wiU be occasioned to the chart division. · O:f the tidal records received, those upon which the determination o:f planes o:f reference depend will be computed immediately and the computation o:f the other records kept up to date as the :force will allow. The bench-mark records as received will be computed immediately for those demanding immediate attention and the others kept up to date as the force will allow. A publication on the bench marks o:f the State o:f New York will be completed and sent to the printer early in the year. A publication on the relation between winds and currents on the Pacific coast will be completed and sent to the printer, as will also an abridged publication of the above, written especially for the mariner. A publication on the harmonic analysis and prediction of tides will be completed and sent to the printer during the fiscal year. In general, the work of the division will be so arranged as to take up immediately the work upon which the publication o:f charts and the prosecution of field work depend; after that the energies of the division will be directed toward keeping its tabulations and computations up to date and to issue in the form o:f publications the lar~e mass of material that has accumulated in this division and which is o:f very great value to the navigator, the engineer, the scientist, and the public generally.

The progress of geodetic field o:i;>erations during the period covered by this report was steady, but limited by the small appropriation. Distinct advances were made in improving field methods in some operations. A supplement to Instructions for Precise Traverse covers many details of that very important method of furnishing horizontal control. Precise traverse will undoubtedly be used more and more in the future, both to supplement the more costly triangulation on comparatively short lines and also to furnish the secondary control for cities. Experiments were made at various times during the year on the effect of magnetization on the period of the new invar pendulums, and at the close of the fiscal year the prospects were bright for being able to perfect simple methods· and apparatus to render that effect negligible. . . The publication of the new gravity manual will make the work of instructing new observers much easier in the future.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The feature which gives the greatest promise, however, and which will revolutionize the process of making observations for astronomic longitude, is the apparatus being built for the Coast and Geodetic Survey by the Bureau of Standards. It is designed to receive at any point in the United States the time signals sent out each day by radio from Annapolis and to record those signals chronographically in comparison with the same chronometer, and on the same sheet of paper employed to record the star observations by which the local time at the new station is determined. The difference of the local times of Annapolis and the new station is, of course, the difference of
lon~itude.

'Ihis new method is exactly similar in principle to the one formerly used, except that the radio is used instead of telegraph or cable lines. The advantage of the new method over the old lies in the fact that only one observing party will be needed instead of the two formerly used, and in being independent of telegraph and cable lines. This invention is especially valuable in regions like southeast Alaska, where a number of longitude stations are needed before the triangulation can be properly adjusted and where no telegraph or cable facilities exist. It will also be very useful in connection with gravity observations at stations out of reach of telegraph lines.
HYDROGRAPHY.

The following is a statement of the vessels at the disposal of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at the beginning of the fiscal year : Bache, Oosmo~i,. Explorer, Fath01ner,1 Hvdrogra.plier, Lydonia,2 Marinduque, 1 1vatoma,2 Onwa't'd2 (returned to Navy Department), Pathfinder, Ranger,2 Romblon1 (returned to Philippine Government), Surve1;or, Wenonah, 2 Yulcon; total, 13. · · The following is a brief statement of the assignments of the vessels at the disposal of the Coast and Geodetic Survey within the fiscal year : Bache.-On July 1 this vessel was engaged on a hydrographic survey at the entrance of Delaware Bay extending from clOse inshore out to the 100-fathom curve. At this depth curve the soundings developed a pronounced ravine hitherto uncharted. At the close of the season the Bache sailed for duty in southern waters, on October 7. On October 19 a revision of the alongshore hydrography, between Tybee Island and Port Royal Sound, was commenced and completed early in December. A number of remarkable changes were found to have occurred since the last survey. The United States Army Engineers, at their request, were furnished a copy of the Tybee Roads area, as some of the new shoals indicate the possibility of a serious encroachment on the dredged channel. In contrast with this instance of accretion is the suit of a landowner of a near-by point for damages from the Government on account of erosion along his water front ·which he claifils was due to dred,ging operations. In April she resumed offshore work in the vicinity of Chesapeake Bay with a view to the extension to the northward of pre' Owned by Phlllppine Government and loaned to Coast and Geodetic Survey for surveying in Philippine waters. ·Converted yachts received by transfer from the Navy Department for surveying.

vious surveys of this class. In cooperation with the Navai Radio Compass Service a series of tests will be made which are expected to afford data for improvements in methods and apparatus valuable to both services. Ewplorer.-On July 1 this vessel was engaged in combined operations in Stephens Passage, southeast Alaska. The most important feature of her work consisted of the extension of the wire-drag examination northward through Stephens Passage, Gastineau Channel, and Lynn Canal. She acts as mother ship for ~he wire-drag launches and takes part in the actual operation of thd drag and sweep. A precise triangulation and a topographic and magnetic survey are being carried on at the same time. Field work closed on October 18, when the steamer returned to Seattle, where she remained until March 24, when she sailed for Taku to resume the same program. Fatlwmer.-This vessel was employed the entire year in surveys in the Philippine Islands. On July 1 she was engaged in general surveys in Sulu Sea in the vicimty of the Cuyo and Cagayan Islands. This work was completed in October and the steamer shifted her working grounds to the southwest coast of Zamboanga Province, and continued in this area until weather conditions made further operations impracticable and she returned to Manila J anuary 29. She was under!!'Oing repairs until April 15. On the 18th she proceeded to her working grounds in the vicinity of the Cagayan Islands, Sulu Sea, and contmued there until the close of the fiscal year. Hydrographer.-On July 1 this vessel was investigating a reported shoal about 4 miles northwest of the Marquesas Keys, Fla., which turned out to be an uncharted coral bowlder with a depth over it of only 7.2 feet. On July 12 the offshore hydrography south of Marquesas Keys was resumed and continued until September 10. On September 14 the steamer proceeded to Boot Key Harbor, which was used as a base for the hydrographic survey between American Shoal and · Sombrero Reef until the close of the season December 30. On January 8 she left Key West and after some delay, due to bad weather, arrived at Mobile, Ala., the 17th, where she remained undergoing repairs _until February 21, when she proceeded to Chandeleur Sound to contmue the work of the Ranger. Before the hydrography in the Gulf could be extended it was necessary to provide adequate control by a triangulation scheme connecting Mississippi Sound with the Delta. This was completed through Chandeleur and Breton Sounds by May 27, and the vessel arrived at Burrwood, La., to take up a hydrographic examination of the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi Delta, requested by the Army Engineers, which was in prog- · ress at the close of the fiscal year. Lydonia.-On July 1 this vessel was engaged in combined operations on the outside coast of southeast Alaska, along the west coast of Dall Island. The steamer was engaged in offshore soundings from August 23 to the end of the season, October 23. The Oosmos was engaged in inshore hydrography between Cape Augustine and Meares -Passage during the entire season, fl.nd the topography o;f the same stretch of coast was done by a detached party with launch 47, operating from a camp. On April 2 the steamer left Seattle to ~ake UP. the offshore hydrography on the northern coast of California, and this work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Marmduque.-This vessel was employed the entire year in surveys in the Philippine Islands. Owing to the lack of a complement of officers, she did not take up field work until March 17, when she commenced operations in Bacoor Bay. This work was completed by May 13. On May 23 she began combined operations in the vicinity of Lagonoy Gulf and remained there during the remainder of the fiscal year. Milcawe.-This vessel was assigned to the resurvey of the stretch of coast from Port Royal Sound to Charleston, S. C. In general, the hydrograph;y had as its offshore limit the 3-fathom curve, and was extended into the inlets of any importance to a distance of at least a mile or to a point where the depths were unchangeable. Work was commenced on August 5 and discontinued on December 20. It was resumed in April, and an additional party with the launch Elsie was also assigned to cooperate with the M ikciwe in this section. Natoma.-From July 1 to July 13 this vessel was at San Francisco, Calif., completing miscellaneous repairs. On the latter date she left for Los Angeles Harbor to take up a general revision of the hydrography and topography. Since the last systematic survey very extensive improvements had been made, with the result that what had hitherto been little more than a convenient anchorage became a harbor with unusual facilities. Field work was completed on December 14 and the vessel returned to San Francisco to resume the revision of the hydrography and topography in that vicinity. The work included a resurvey of the bar, wire-dra.~ investigation of shoal soundings off Fort Point and east of Angel island, and the location of four radio compass stations. Field work was closed on May 26, and up to the close of the fiscal year the steamer was undergoing general repairs and overhauling. Onward.-This vessel continued on the resurvey of Pamlico Sound and Neuse River until October 21. On November 26 she ·was returned to the Navy Department. Pathfon<ler.-This vessel was employed <luring the entire year on surveys in the Philippine Islands. She left Manila July 26 for hydrographic surveys off the coast of Camarines Norte, east coast or Luzon. This survey includes a bank shown on former Spanish charts at the edge o:f deep water in the Pacific. The indications are that this bank is much smaller and deeper than reported and the survey will probably remove it from the list of dangers. This work was suspended in October before the period of northeast monsoons, and on November 1 the Pathfinder sailed for the west coast of Mindanao to take up combined operations. The triangulation was completed between Neg'!'OS Island and Sibuguey Bay, Mindanao, and she returned to Manila January 5. From-January 10 until the first part of March she was undergoillg repairs, and on the completion of these she proceeded to Lagonoy Gulf, arriving there March 16, and was engaged in this section until May 16, when she proceeded to J omalig Island. Having completed the detailed hydrographic examinations there in June, she commenced the work of deep-sea sounding, thence to Catanduanes Islands. Rdnger.-On July 1 this vessel was engaged in the offshore hydrographic survey in the Gulf of Mexico from Mobile Entrance to Chandeleur Sound. From November 14 to December 27 she was at Gulf-

port, Miss., making repairs to boilers and arranging for extensive repairs and alterations preparatory to taking up a new assignment for combined operations in Porto Rico and the Viq~in Islands. From December 29, 1920~_.to June, 1921, she was undergomg repairs at New Orleans, La. On June 1 she proceeded to Key West, where she was joined by the launches Mitchell and Mar'indin, and convoyed them to San Juan, P. R., arriving July 5. Surveyor.-On July 1, 1920, this vessel was engaged in combined operations extending' from Shelikof Strait westward to Mitrofania Island, southwest Alaska. The principal part) of this work was triangulation for primary control of that stretch of coast, 180 miles in length. A shortage of fuel oil rendered it necessary in midseason to change the original program to operate parties at both ends of the scheme, and to concentrate the entire complement and equipment in Shelikof Strait. The Yulcon was used as an auxiliary during the season, which closed October 5. After stopping two days at Sitka for a special examination, the steamer proceeded to Seattle, arriving the 18th. With expectation of continued fuel-oil shortage and its high price in southwest Alaska, it was decided to postpon~. operations there and _!'eplace the Lydolfllia on the survey of the outside coast of Prince of Wales Island, southeast Alaska. The steamer left Seattle April 2 and on April 18 field work commenced and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. Wenonah.-This vessel was engaged on July 1 in carrying on combined operations in Clarence Strait. In aduition to the topography and alongshore hydrographv done by the launches and the hydrography out in the deeper waters of the o.pen strait by the steamer, a section of the scheme of precise triangulation is also being done and will eventually connect with that of the Eroplorer through a short link completed in a previous season. Field work was closed in November and the Wenonah arrived at her home port, Seattle, on the 18th. She returned to Ketchikan April 2, and by the 18th all branches of field work were resumed. The statements below contain the statistics regarding the class of accomplishment during the fiscal year:

The magnetic observatories at Vieques, P. R.; Cheltenham, Md.; Tucson, Ariz.; Sitka, Alaska; and near Honolulu, Hawaii, have been in operation throughout the year and practically continuous records have been secured on the magnetographs and seismog-raphs. The necessary absolute observations and scale value determmations have also been made. A magnetometer which had been previously compared at Cheltenham and Tucson was compared with the magnetometers at the Honolulu and Sitka magnetic observatories, and then again at Cheltenham, thus giving an indirect comparison of the magnetometers at these four observatories. Instruments intended for field use were standardized at Cheltenham. In April, 1921, the instruments of the yacht Oamegie, of the department of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, were compared with those at Honolulu Observatory, thus giving another determination of the relation of the latter to the international magnetic standard of that department. In February a new Milne-Shaw seismo15raph was installed at the Honolulu Observatory. The greater sensitivity and more imi;>roved · time-marking apparatus of this instrument will make it possible to determin.e the .earthquake P.hases .with much greater accuracy than was possible with the old Milne seismograph. · The time record of the seismograph at Tucson has also been greatly improved by the substitution of a make-circuit chronometer in place of the clock which came with the instrument. At the Sitka Observatory much trouble was experienced in replacing the broken jewels in the bearings of the recording arm o:f the E-W component of the Bosch-Omori seismograph. Steel bearings installed at the end of the year promise to give very good results. Earthquakes have been recorded as follows: Porto Rico, 25; Cheltenham, 26; Tucson, 35; Sitka, 9; and Honolulu, 68. Extensive improvements have been made to the buildings and grounds of the Honolulu Observatory, and repairs to the office

building at Vieques were in progress at the end of the fiscal year. Local conditions in the building trades made it advisable to postpone longer the erection of a building for office and quarters at Cheltenham, but it is hoped that this most important work can be done next · · · · year. The observer in charge of the Honolulu Observatory was a delegate to the Pan-Pacific Scientific Congress, and was able to secure the services of a former magnetic observer to take temporary charge of the observatory while he attended the meetings of the congress on the island of Hawaii. ) MAGNETIC SuRVEY.-Because of the inability to secure additional magnetic observers it was necessary to suspend almost entirely the fiela work of the magnetic survey, and as a consequence to postpone the preparation of the isogonic chart for 1920. A magnetic observer began field work the middle of June to secure the secular change data in the northwestern part of the country needed for the preparation of that chart, and had occupied three repeat stations at the end of the fiscal year. Declination observations were made at a number of stations in southeastern Alaska in 1920 in connection with the triangulation work, and in April, 1921, an extended series of observations was made in the vicinity of Port Snettisham, Alaska, by the party on the steamer Explorer for the purpose of developing a local disturbance which had been reported in the vicinity of Sentmel Point. Declination observations were made at four stations by the topographic party at work in the Virgin Islands. Arrangements were made with the United States Coast Guard by which it will be possible to make magnetic observations on the shores of Bering . Sea and the Arctic Ocean during the coming summer. After making observations at the old station at Seattle, an officer of this Bureau left that place for Nome, Alaska, on June 9, where it is expected that he will join the Coast Guard steamer Bear after making observations in that vicinity.

In addition, tidal observations in connection with hydrographic surveys were made at 30 stations in the United States with an aggregate length .of 5! . years, 18 stations in the Philippine Islands with an aggregate length of 3! years, and records received from outside sources totaled 21 stations with an aggregate length of 11! years.

At the principal tida1 stations the relation of tide staff to bench mark was verified With spirit levels, insuring accurate data :for precise level net connections and also for the detection of emergence or subsidence of coast. To make available for engineering and other purposes definite datum planes all along the coast, and to the mariner increased accuracy of current predictions, a tidal and current party was employed in New York Harbor for about 3!- months. The work of this small party was preliminary to a contemplated intensive tidal and current survey of the port, extending over only a, short·. period. but with. simultaneous observations by a number of parties over the whole area. Current observations during the year were made on 19 light vessels on the Atlantic coast, and on 5 light vessels on the Pacific coast. In addition, short series of observations were maqe at 62 sta,tions with an aggregate length of 13 months. . An improvement in connection with the obserwation ot tides, of considerable importance, was inaugurated during the past year. This consists of a standard tide staff and backing piece wh:i,ch will 'elimi~ nate a great deal of trouble heretofore eJ!iperienoed in maintaining a fixed relation between the. tide curve and the zero .of .the tide staff. This standardized tide staff and backing. 'pi.~ce ·are being estab~ lished at all the principal tidal stations maintaiped by the Survey.. Another improvement worthy of mention here.is the.field automatic tide gauge, which was devised the pas~ year ari.d which is now being constructed in the instrument section of ~he Survey. This new gaµge, ·which is portable, will .aid in securing better observations for use in connection with hydrogn,iphic surveys and do away with the. necessity of maintaining one or mor.e tide observers with ·each party, thus securing increased accuracy at decreased· expense.

CHAPTER II
PRESENT CONDITION OF GEODETIC, HYDROGRAPHIC, MAGNETIC, AND TIDAL AND CURRENT SURVEYS.
GEODETIC WORK.

One of the major operations of the Bureau is the extension of triangulation and leveling of precise and primary accuracies into the interior of the United States. All surveying and mapping o:f the country is, or should bej i oined· to these two systems of control to give proper coordination. Maps and charts are not satisfactory if discrepancies develop when two or more of them covering adjacent areas are used together. The only possible way of avoiding these discrepancies is to have all detailed and local work connected to the main scheme or control :framework of precise accuracy which includes the whole country. For a graphic J?resentation of the present pro()'ress of triangulation see figure opposite. Until recently the plan followed in laying out the O"eodetic work was to distribute the control surveys, triangulation, ancf' precise leveling in such a manner as to have as soon as possible one or more points of precise accuracy within not more than 100 miles of any place in the United States. The Board of Surveys and Maps, after a careful consideration of the mapping situation in this country, has recently recommended that the 100 miles be decreased to 50 and that the precise control be completed at as early a date as possible. The board estimated the total cost at $4,200,000. The need is urgent. Not only are the mapping activities of the United States Geological Survey and other Federal map-making bureaus dependent upon this precise control, but States and cities are demanding more and more insistently that this control be made available for their use. This work is a necessary preliminary to the industrial progress of the nation and must be regarded as a necessary investment rather than as running ex:penses. The question. of State cooperation m this work is one that should be considered. It is believed that a State should be permitted to share the cost of control surveying which is entirely within the limits of the State and which is done primarily at the request of the State to meet its own particular need. However, the greater number of arcs of precise triangulation and lines of precise leveling cross several States. Each separate piece of this control surveying must be joined at both ends to the main scheme over the whole country and so can not well be done piecemeal at wide intervals of time. It would be very difficult, one might almost say impossible, to secure the cooperation of several States m the required manner. It is, of course, out of the question

:for each State to do its own control work. The cost of organizing and equipping a geodetic survey in each State would be prohibitive to say nothing of several other almost insurmountable difficulties as, for example, the carrying of work through intervening States which were indifferent or wished to delay in making the appropriations, to a State urgently in need of control data. Although the need for triangulation and leveling in the United States proper is very great, the condition in Alaska is even worse. 'fhe precise control work in Alaska immediately needed includes an arc of triangulation along the coast to coordinate the hydrographic ch~rts, and trian~lation and leveling f_rom Cook Inlet into the iI~ ter10r toward Fairbanks, for the use of several Government orgarnzations, especially the topographic branch of the Geological Survey, the General Land Office, and the Forest Service. This Bureau and the Geodetic Survey of Canada are at present cooperating in carrying precise triangulation from the northern boundary of the United States to a point on the Yukon River where it crosses the one hundred and forty-first meridian boundary. This will make the North American datum available for both Alaska and Canada. One of the important lines of scientific work carried on by the Bureau is the determination of gravity. The cost of this work is very small. The results are of great value to geologists in their practical as well as theoretical work, and they have urged that the work be continued again, especially to ascertain if the .gravity apparatus can be used for the detection of oil or other mineral deposits. Another important problem in gravimetric surveys is to develop an apparatus for the measurement of gravity at sea. Many investigations regarding the formation of the earth's crust and earth dynamics would be greatly advanced by accurate aravity determinations over the oceans. The cost of this work wou1d be almost insignificant as compared with the benefits to be derived. The subject of seismology is now being followed actively by many able investigators in this and other countries. Very recently this work has been undertaken in California by the Carnegie Institution of Washington and independently b:y geologists in California. This Bureau should be given an appropriation to cooperate in this work to the extent of carrying precise triangulation and leveling into the regions of seismic activity in order to detect movements of the earth both horizontally and vertically. It is very probable th~t there is a slow movement of the earth's crust prior to an earthquake shock and that the imminence of destructive convulsions may be predicted after proper study of the subject has been made. Following the San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906, the triangulation in the area affected was revised to determine the amount and extent of the horizontal displacements in the earth's crust. Relative horizontal displacements of from 6 to 20 feet on the sides of a fault 185 miles long were disclosed by this triangulation. It also disclosed evidence of earlier movements which had affected a large area, probably at the time of the 1868 earthquake. These two great movements caused horizontal displacements in an a:i;ea 0£ more than 4,000 sguare miles. In order that any preliminary gradual displacements may be detected, it is necessary that detailed precise triangulation be extended over the areas of suspected seismic activity and that the ohsenations

at .pertain stations in that area be repeated at intervals. Critical strains in the earth's crust may also be evidenced by changes in the relative elevations of different portions of the terrain, so precise levels should also be run. These precise earth measurements are a necessary preliminary to the successful study of the seismic phenomena antedating severe earthquakes. The control points established will also perform their more common function of base points for local surveys and will thus be of value in a dual capacity.
HYDlWGRAPHIO WORK ·

.It has been found convenient to arrange this work in the form of separate projects. These projects may be divided into two classes, as follows: (1) Unchangeable areas; (2) changeable areas which will require continuing operations for an indefinite period. In the first class, there are the offshore hydrography of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts; the wire-drag work on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, including Porto Rico and southeast Alaska; the first complete survey of certain sections of southern and western Alaska, which are of immediate commerc1al importance. No ·estimate is made for the Aleutian Islands west of Unalaska, most of the area in Bering Sea or Arctic Alaska, sin.ce their commercial development seems to belong to the distant future. For the offshore work, we have planned to go seaward to a depth of 100 fathoms in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico and to a depth 'of 1,000 fathoms in the Pacific Ocean. 'When these ocean surveys have been accomplished in accordance with present standards, there will be no necessity for additional work inside of the 100-fathom depths on the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico and the 1,000 fathom depths on the Pacific Ocean except in those places of comparatively shallow depths, such as Georges Bank, Nantucket Shoals, Diamond Shoals, and the shallow coastal waters which are subject to constant changes. ·Likewise, after the surveys of the designated sections of Alaska, the Hawaiian and Philippine waters have been completed, the only additional work that will be required in these areas will be such as may result from changes in localities of shallow depth, or where greatly increased commercial importance necessitates more detailed surveys of small bodies of water, or where changes have resulted from public works undertaken subsequent to the original survey, and work in the Bel'ing Sea and Arctic Ocean. · The second class of work, chart revision and the resurvey of the bays and inside waters of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States, and to a lesser extent of Alaska and the insular possessions, must be carried on indefinitely, just as we are to-day resurveying waters that have been adequately surveyed several· times in the past. This is due to the fact that the forces of nature are continuously cutting out 'and building up along the entire shore where the formation is not solid rock, and also to the fact that the industrial development of the country is continuously changing both the water.ways and shore line by dredging channels, filling iJ.1, constructing piers and other works. In order that the charts may be kept up to date and be of real service to .the mariner it is necessary that they be corrected from time to time to show these changes.

The oceanographic work which. the Bureau should carry on can not be treated as a project on which any time limit for completion can be given. At the present time there is an urgent need for the detail of one able vessel on this work on the Atlantic coast for the exploration of the Gulf Stream'is one of the problems that was laid down in the organic act creating the Coast Survey. ·we have done very little work o:f this kind in the hundred and more years of the existence of the Survey, and no work of any consequence has been done within the last 30 years. These projects do not include all of the work that should b~ performed by the Bureau in the line of hydrography and topography, but it is believed that they do include all the projects that should be undertaken at _this time or in the near future, the other worlcto be deferred until the completion of some of these projects. After the completion of any of these projects the personnel and equipment that had been. employed on t~e project will be available fol' other work. This other work includes hydrographic investigations beyond the ~iinits of the present. projects and other special .investigatio~s. It 1s clearly the duty of this country to perform lts share of ocean investi~ation, and there is a large field for such investigation in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, contiguous to our. coast, but outside of the 100-fathom contour. There 1s a like need for such work in the Pacific Ocean outside of the 1,000-fathom contour, which is comparatively close .to our coast. There. are fishing banks seaward of the 1,000-fathom contour in the Pacific· Ocean that should be investigated for the benefit of our fisheries. There is a stretch of unexplored water extending hundreds of miles west of the Hawaiian group through which our ships are required to pass. These wat'ers are known to contain many shoals, reefs, and rocks that are a menace to navigation. The survey of these ,waters, together with resurveys of the shallow changeable offshore waters, would fully employ any equipment and personnel that would be released on the completion of any of the projects which require similar equipment. ·· WIRE DRAG,1 ATLANTIC .AND GULF CoASTs.-Area to be dragged, 5,000 square miles; 3,000 square miles of this area is on the coast of Maine, and inoludes much deep water.

PACIFIC COAST OF Ar,ASK.A.-Cape Spencer to Attu Island. Incomplete hydrography area 26,250 square miles. The surveys of ·a large J?art of this are sufficient for present navigational needs. For admimstrative purposes it should be considered in the same class as the changeable areas on the continental coasts of the United States; Additional surveys will be made· in response to a demand, and the ideal arrangement would be to assign one or more parties each year to this class of work. No work under this project is undertaken during the present, nor is any contemplated during the next, fiscal . . ,· . year. . Exploratory or unsurveyed are~ 120,465 square miles. Of this area there are 40,000 square miles of immediate· im:portance to navigation. This includes the stretch of coast from Prmce William Sound to Unalaska Island. The 'party should be J?repared to undertake all classes of surveys. The type of organizat10n would be that of the Surveyor in 1920. ' · Ar..ASKA, BERING SEA AND Anc·rrc OCEAN .-'-Area unsurveyed 427 ,345 square miles. Most of this area is of such a distance from land that its survey is of no present navigational importance. The stretch of coast on the north side of the Alaskan Peninsula and ex~ tending from Unalaska Island to the mouth of the Kuskokwim River promises to be of increasing commercial importance due to the large fishing industries and the possibility 0£ the discovery of gold-bearing sands, the characteristics of the shores of the Kuskokwim being similar to those found at Nome. No work was accomplished on this J?roject during the present fiscal year, nor is any contemplated durmg the next year. HAWAIIAN IsLANDs.-The unsurveyed area is 10,280 square miles. Most of this area is deep water which could be done by a steamer of the Lydonia type. The hydrography of the bays and close along shore, as well as the topography, would be done by a detached party from the steamer living .ashore and assigned a launch. This work is much needed, but owing to lack of appropriations it has been impossible to do any work on this project during this fiscal year, nor is any contemplated during the next year. · In the present and previous annual reports there are printed diagrams of the Condition ·of Field Operations. ·These diagrams are intended to show in a graphic manner where our surveys are at present adequate, or where surveys are needed, and the type of survey required to make our charts up to date and thorou'ghly reliable for safe navigation. . · " · To facilitate reference to the text and to the locality, diagrams are inserted showing the important steanier courses, the courses being numbered to correspond to the paragraphs of descriptive matter:

Using these sketches as base maps, I have endeavored to show the progress that has been made in the hydrographic and topographic work, using the same sequence in nunibering the courses and descriptive matter pertaining thereto. . A detailed analysis of the conditions and the progress of the work can not be given in this limited space, but there are shown on the base maps the areas covered during the past year. 1. DEEP-DRAFT ALONGSHORE COURSE FROM THE CANADIAN BOUNDARY TO THE OuTEU LIMIT OF ISLE AU HAUT BAY.-The entire area that this course covers is a region of ledges and bo,vldcrs. The ledges rise abruptly from the deep water and the bowlders ordinarily lie singly or in clusters on an otherwise Hat bottom, so that the navigator can not depend on the lead to avoid them. The thoroughfares affording an exit to the Bay of Fundy from Passamaquoddy Bay and St. Croix River have been wire dragged. Also an area 15 miles in length between Machias Seal Islands and Petit Manan Island. There is still remaining a large area as yet untouched by the wire drag. There are a number of towns along this course that depend on waterborne traffic for shipping out their produce and receiving their supplies. The commerce consists of lumber, fish, and fuel, and miscellaneous merchandise, constituting the supply of the sm~1ller and larger fashionable resorts, of which the largest is Bar Harbor, Me; The exceptionally rocky coast makes it certain that a wire-drag survey will result in the discovery of many rocks that· now endanger the safetv of commerce oYer this course. (See fig. 5, opposite p. fi4.) 2. 'I<~RENCHMANS BAY.-This bodv of 'water lies westwitrd of Schoodic Peninsula and eastward of Mount Desert Island. It is the approach to the town and important summer resort of Bar Harbor, Winter Harbor, South vVest Harbo1·, N orthrast Harbor, and many small villages and naval coaling sta:tions on the north side of Eastern Bay. T~e bay .is frequented by many passenger steamers, yachts, small craft, fishmg vessels, and a few cargo vessels. This area has been dragged to it line extending westward from Schoodic Island whistle buoy, though not to depths now consic1ered l'tecessary. The value of the work is further impaired by the necessity of passing over not less than 14 miles of undragged, doubtful area, in order to reach the bay from the open sea. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 54.) · 3. INLAND TJionouGHl<'AllES I·'ROM MouN'r DESERT IsLAND ·ro Rocn.I,ANo.-There is a series of valuable inside passages along the Maine coa~t that are very narrow in places and wind between rocky ledges. Owmg to the nature of the bottom they are in particular most li.keli' to be obstructed by pinnacle rocks or the extension of narrow ridge.s ·out into the channel. The only part of these clrnnnels which lrns been dragged lies between Bluehill Bay and the western entrance of Penobscot Bay. The results obtained have been so startling that they clearly indicate dangers in the use of channels that have not been drago-ed. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 54.) · · · 4. PENOBSCO'l' RrvER.-This river, emptying into the head of Penobscot Bay, forms the 11pproach to the towns of Bucksport. vVintcrport. Hampden, and Brewer, and the city of Bangor, the latter two at i;hA head of navigation, about 24 miles above Fort Point Lighthouse at the entrance. It has considerable trnde in regular steamers drawing about 10 feet, and many vessels trading to Bangor draw as much as 18 feet. Practically the entire river above Bangor is usod in lumber-

56

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

ing. From the mouth of the river to Bangor there will be no positive certainty of the absence of all dangers to navigation until the area has been dragged. (See fig. 5,· opposite p. 54.) 5. PEN?BSCOT BAY.-In Penobscot Bay every port has benefited by the practwal completeness of the wire-drag work. There are, however, some of the less-important sections to be dragged, and some of the approaches from the eastward are not yet completed. The wire drag, as used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was developed in this region, and some of the area was not dragged to the depth now believed necessary. The size of vessels has increased rapidly, and additional work is necessary to protect this increased draft. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 54.) As it has required time to solve all the problems involved in dragging to this greater depth, it is probable that much of the deeper part of Penobscot Bay which was covered during the development of the wire-drag apparatus will later have to be dragged to a greater depth. · . 6. PENOBSCOT BAY TO CAsco BAY (DEEP DRAFT) .-The coast of New England throughout its length presents practically one uniform problem to the hydrographic engineer. Surveys of varying degrees of completeness have been made of the entire area, and it is possible for navigators to select channels which are apparently safe. They would be of ample depth if it were not for the ice-worn granite rock or the large bowlders deposited during the glacial period. The lead line is not adapted to find without assistance dangers of this character. This thoroughfare presents uneven and rocky bottom between ·Monhegan Island and the eastern entrance to Casco Bay, which should be dragged to remove all doubt of the existence of pinnacle rocks or small ledges. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 54.) 7. P:irnonscoT BAY TO CAsco BAY (MonERATE DnAFT).-From the western entrance of Penobscot Bay to Casco Bay there has been no wire-drag work done. The inside route is constantly used by coasting steamers, but it is certain that it has within its limits many uncharted rocks, some known locally and some unknown. (See fig. 6, oppo· site p. 56.) 8. BoonrnAY HAnnon.-This :forms the approach to the town of Boothbay Harbor and numerous smaller summer resorts. It is frequented by many vessels and by a large number o:f fishing boats and pleasure craft in ·summer. It is one o:f the best anchorages on the coast'o:f Maine, and is much used as a harbor of refuge by all classes of vessels. This area is in urgent need o:f a wire-drag survey. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 56.) 9. KENNEBEC RIVER.-It is the approach to the cities o:f Bath and Augusta, the towns of Woolworth, Richmond, and Gardiner, and· numerous smaller villages arid summer resorts. The river has considerable water-borne commerce, the deepest draft being about 21 feet to Bath and 14 feet to Augusta. There is urgent need for a wiredrag survey of this river. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 56.) 10. CAsco BAY.-Casco Bay and the approaches to Portland have been dragged with the result of finding numerous uncharted shoals, thereby furnishing important evidence of the need of carrying the survey to the eastward and westward to a junction with completed work. A resurvey of inner Casco Bay is badly needed, the glaciers having left a series of long, narrow, and dangerous ledges, which require closer examination. · (See fig. 6, opposite p. 56,)

11. PORTLAND HARBOR AND APPROAOHEs.-These have been dragged, and all dangers to navigation are shown on the charts. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 56.) 12. PouTLAND To PoRTSMOUTR (MODERATE DuAFT) .-Westward of Portland the succession of sand beaches, of which Old Orchard is the best known, might appear· to indicate an absence of rocks in this region. The depth of sand above the underlying rock is not great, however, and· pinnacle rocks occur outside these beaches. There is a gap in the wire-drag surveys between Cape Porpoise and Cape Elizabeth, which must be completed to make this portion safe. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 56.) 13. PORTLAND TO CAPE ANN (DEEP DnAI<'T) .-The region from Boon Island to Isle of Shoals is very rocky, and its importance as the approach to Portsmouth is well recognized. The area has been covered by the wire drag which now forms a continuously dragged area from Cape Porpoise to within 10 miles of Cape Ann. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 56.) 14. PORTSMOUTH HARBOR.-This area has been dragged, and all dangers to navigation are known. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 56.) 15. MASSACHUSETTS CoAsT NORTH OF CAPE ANN.-From the New Hampshire border to Cape Ann the shores are entirely different ·from those to the north or south. There are high sand bluffs in places and low sandy shores in others. As a result, the depths along the shore are changeable, and, though they have been recently surveyed, they will need further attention. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 56.) 16. CAPE ANN TO CAPE Con CANAJ,.-A completely dragged area extends from Cape Ann tO Cape Cod Canal and from the head of Buzzards Bay to Sakonnet Point, R. I. With the exception of the areas near the shores of Buzzards Bay, this importafit survey is complete. This work was made especially necessary by the opening of the Cape Cod Canal in 1915, the origmal surveys having been made while the commerce of the region was relatively unimportant. A number of shoals were found of less than the proposed canal depth. It was important not only to find those shoals 0£ less than the proposed canal depth, but also those which might become a menace at some future date in case it should be necessary to deepen this canal to take care of the largest vessels. With this view the drag was carried at a sufficient depth to meet such requirements. Even should a depth of 40 feet be adopted for the canal, the present ..surveys of the approaches will be found adequate, and where less depths have been found the information will be invaluable to the engineers making the improvement. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 56.) 17. FnoM Bos'l'ON SouTH OuTSIDJ<J CAPE Coo.-Much of the traffic between eastern New England and points west and south passes outside of Cape Cod; most of it through Nantucket and Vineyard Sounds. Off Cape Cod the surveys are not complete. In Nantucket Sound the entire route is through channels bounded by shifting sand, and requires frequent revision work. In one part of the channel most used-through ·Pollock Rip Slue-a shoal was formed in the last few years that has been steadily narrowing and decreasing the depth of the channel. A resurvey of parts of this route is needed every few years to insure safety' to navigatio:r:i-. No rocks abound eastward of Cape Cod, but in the north half of Nantucket Sound and the western part of Vineyard Sound large bowlders occur

58

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

and wire-drag work is needed. At present vessels must pass over 10 miles of undrugged area in following the best channel through Vineyard Sound. (See fig. 7, opposite p. 58.) 18. FRo:r.r CAPE Coo CANAL THROUGH BuzzARDs BAY.-This route has been dragged out to the eastern limit of Long Island Sound. (See fi¥. 7, opposite p. 58.) 20. ENTHANCE TO NARRAGANSE'IT BAY, BLOCK ISLAND SOUND F1snERs IsLAND SouNI>, AND EASTERN PAH'.1' OF LoNG Is1,A.No SouND,__: '.rhese areas are practically completed, with the exception of the central and western parts of Long Island Sound, which remain to be dragged. (See fig. 7, opposite p. 58.) 21. GUL1'' m' MAINE.-The portion of the Gul£ of Maine of which the Bureau makes surveys may be considered as lying to the westward of meridian 67° O' and extending to Nantucket Shoals. This entire area has been inadequately surveyed, as it was accomplished at an early date when both the appliances and the methods were far inferior to those of the present day. Not only are the soundings obtained insufficient, but many of them are not located correctly on the charts. A good example of this is the discovery several years ago that only one shoal rock exists on Cashe Ledge, where two were charted, and that Sigsbee and Ammen Rocks formerly shown four miles apart are really the same rock. These defects in the charts are serious for two reasons: The trans-Atlantic steamers approaching the ports of northern New England, especially Portland and Boston, are unable to depend on the charts of the Gulf sufficiently to locate themselves accurately by sounding. This is particularly serious during the fog of summer, which often extends far out to sea and lasts for days, and during the winter snowstorms. In addition to this, 'the fisheries of the Gu1£ of Maine are an important national asset. Not only are many important fishing banks uncharted, but the limit and depths of known banks are not correctly given. Besides, there is not at present enough information available .as to the character of the bottom. The knowledge of rocky bottom may lead to the discovery of good fishing grounds. (See fig. 8, opposite p. 58.) 22. NANTUCKET 8uoALs 'l'O GEoHGES BANKs.-Extending eastward from Nantucket Sound there is an immense shoal area, consisting of sandy ridges which are shifted by the waves and currents. Nantucket Shoals .extend about 50 miles offshore; then there is a deep channel followed by ridges. It is readily seen that it is important to keep the channel surveyed and to examine the adjacent shoals to detect changes; but it might readily be asked,. what is the use of surveying such areas as Nantucket Shoals, which vessels are most careful to avoid~ First, it is necessary to be certain that the outer limits of these shoals are clearly defined in order that they may be avoided; second, the shoals are important fishing grounds; third, more careful surveys may develop safe channels for coastwise navigation channels which are already indicated on the charts but are unsafe to use because of inadequate sMrveys. Due to the constant changes the existing surveys are nowhere adequate. The shoals are so numerous and the channels so intricate that a difficult problem is presented in their examination by accurate methods. The ground fishing, which has in recent years assumed large proportions, is steadily moving seaward. During the winter Nantucket Island is the

lieadquasters of this industry. Not only do the present charts lack the needed information in the search for new ground hut the absence from the charts of existing shoals is a source of. danger to the boats running to and from the harbor. Breakers often occur ·where there is ample depth for boats when the water is smooth. This is an excellent example of how a region usually avoided by commerce may be of importance to an industry which furnished p,art of the food supply o:f the nation. (See fig. 8, opposite p. 58.) . 23. TRANs-A'l.'LAN'l'IC ArrnoACH 'l'O Nmv Yomc.-There is scarcely any part of our coast where correct soundings are of more importance than in the approach to N e-w York from the eastward, as all transAtlnntic steamers bound to that port pass over this area. Many of them have to depend on soundings for safety. A fairly good survey of this area is available, but additional work should be done by modern methods in the portion out of sight of land so that the needs of the enormous traffic will be met. (See fig. 8, opposite p. 58.) 24. FnoM PoINT JUDITH TO Nmv Yomc.-It is almost unnecessary to· go into particulars, except to make it clear that the central and western parts of Long Island Sound rema,in to be dragged. This work will be undertaken at the earliest opportunity. At present New York Harbor has but one exit to the sea for deep-draft vessels-by way of the Lower Bay and through Ambrose Channel over Sandy Hook Bar. The other exit, through Long Island Sound and" Block Island Sound, is obstructed by ledges at Hell Gate, in the East River. The project to remove these and secure a depth of 40 feet is now in progress. Before it is completeq, channels of this depth in the sound should be examined with the drag to mrtke certain they are safe. This would also apply to Fort Pond and approaches, if the proposed transAtlnntic terminal is located at that place. The project to deepen East River to 40 feet makes it necessary to be certain where the channels ·with such depths are located in Long Island Sound. The work done in Block Island Sound has defined the limit of such depths in the eastern approach to Long Island Sound, and it is urgent that the entire aren. should be completed without delay. The approaches to all the harbors on Long Island Sound should be dragged. The shoaler bays are used extensively by motor boats, and the number in operation for a given area is probably greater than anywhere else in the United States. (See fig. 9, opposite p. 60.) 25. HunsoN R1vEn.-The Hudson River is a vahrnble waterway between N cw York and Albany and is a part of the canal system of the State. A few years ago a dangerous rock was found directly in the path of steamers· between New York and Albany. With such a possibility all the doubtful parts of the Hudson should be dragged. (See fig. 9, opposite p. 60.) 26. Nmv YonK HARBon.-New York Harbor has had a recent surYey, but as it is an area subject to change it will require a survey, at least in pnrt, every few years. (See fig. 9, opposite p. 60.) · 27. CoAs'J.' OF Nmv JERSEY.-Along the most of the coast of New .Tersey the character of the bottom is such that the exact existing depths should be ascertained beyond all doubt, particularly as shoals dangerous to coastwise traffic have been reported from time to time. '.fhe only reliabl.e surveys along this stretch of coast have been made m connpction w1th searches for these reported shoals: Eastward of Cape :\fay there are shoals that need a resurvey.

area was in progress July 1, 1920, in the vicinity of Cape Henlopen and extended northward. The sounding lines were carried out seaward as far as the 100-fathom curve. The season closed in October. (See fig. 9, opposite p. 60.) 28. DEJ,AWAHE BAY.-Delaware Bay has as its most marked characteristic a series of narrow, fairl~' cleep' channels separated by long, narrow shoals. These shoals are subject to chaug(~. .\ survey is needed now, and one should be made about every IO _years in the entrance and at longer intervals in the upper bay. 1'Vhih; dredgml channels a.re maintained for most of the distance from the entrance of the bay to Philadelphia, vessels of moderate draft use the other channels. In view of the importanc of the cities at the head of the bay and on the river, it is highly important that the needed survey of.Delaware Bay be made so that a chart of the proper standard may be issued. (See fig. 10, -0.pposite p. 60.) . 29. DELAWARE Bxr ENTRANCJ" TO CnESAI'JCARJ<; BAY.-From Delaware Bay entrance to Chesapeake Bay there is a succession of shoals and banks. Many of these are buoyed so that rnoclerate-dra ft v<!s~els may pass inside of them. In cei·tain regions it is of the highest importance that the surrny should ~e correct and kept up to date. At only one place has a comprehensive survey heen made, and this was the investigation of a reported shoal. \Vork in this section is now in progress, norti1 of the entrance to Chesapeake Ba v, and bPing extended northward. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 60.) · · 30. C1msAPI<JA1rn BAY AND 'l'RIBUTAIUI~s.-These have Leen extensively surveyed in recent years, and a large nnmber of tributaries will not require resurveys for many years. This is a 180 trnP of the Potomac River. The parts which need resurveying are parts of the bay from Cape Char-les to a point opposite Annapolis, parts of the James River, and the Rappahannock and Susquehanna Rivers. The entrance has been recently surveyed, but another survey will probably be needed in 10 years. Owing to the shifting sandy bottom, the bay is greatly in need of examination at critical localities where depths are near the draft of vessels, frequent report indicating presence of new shoals. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 60.) 31. CHESAPEAKE BAY ENTRANCE 'l'O CAPE JL.\TTERAS.-'l'he diagram shows the tracks for both the light-draft and deep-draft vessels. While a resurvey is desired, the most pressing need is that the present limit of shoal areas be accurately determined. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 60.) 32. ALBEMARLE SouNo.-Albemarle Sound and its tributaries, with a few exceptions, have been resurveyed within the last few years and will not require resurveying for a long time. The uncompleted portions, including the North and Alligator Rivers, should be finished in the near future, as they form part of the project for a through 10-foot channel of the inside waterway route. The Chowan River, which is the western extension of this sound. should also be finished, and then the survevs of this region would in a most satisfactory; up-to-date conditio'i1. (See fig. 10, dpposite p. 60.) 33. CROA'l'AN SouND.-Croatan Sound, the connecting link between Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds. has recently been resurveyed, but the depth is so near to the draft' of vessels usii;g it that the surveys will have to be revised from time to time. vhanges in the main

channel have occurred within the. last two years; (See fig. 10, opposite p. ·60.) · ·· 34. PAMLICO SouND.-Pamlico' Sound has additional importance owing to its relation to the· inland waterway route, The eastern half of the sound is well surveyed, but the entire western half and the Neuse River, in addition to its local use as part of the through; lO~foot channel, have not been completed; the survey was in progress up to October, 1920, when it had to be discontinued owing to' the steamer P,roving unsuitable and too expensive to operate. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 60.) 35. DIAMOND SHOALs.-Diamond Shoals ·off Hatteras should be resurveyed chiefly to determine changes in their extent, a.nd particularly to obtain a knowledge of the correct depths on the seaward ·side. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 60.) . . . ' ·· 36. CAPE HA'l'TERAS TO WrnYAH BAY, S. 0.-Nearly the whole of this area is in need of a new survey, as.those areas now charted are not ~n ~ufficient detail· for m?dern ~avigation. Next to Diamon~ Sho.als rn unportance to coastw1se navigation are the shoals .extenduig seaward from Cape .Lookout and Cape Fear. They are subject to change and should be examined at short intervals.. (See fi'g: 11, opposite p. 62.) .. . · · . · · .· · 37. 17VINYAH BAY TO FERNANDINA, FLA;-This' region has been recently surveyed, the work extending out to lOO~:fathoni curve. The. inshore.limit did not include the water area inshore from: the 3-fathom curve or the entrances to the harbors and inlets. Resurveys of this shoal-water area have been in progress for over a ·year, and the topography of the immediate coast line is being revised at the same time. · The results show many changes of importance to small craft. (See fig. 11, opposite· p. 62.) · 38. ·FERNANDINA TO 1·1m FLORIDA REEFs.-From Fernandina to the Florida Reefs ·the area of moderate depths continually narrows, until at Palm Beach the distance to the 100-fathom curve is very small. The completed survey referred. to in paragraph 37 extei;ds southward to a httle· below St. Augustme. South of St.· Augustrne the bottom is probab~y not subject to change except a~ noted below, and the surveys, while by no means complete, are fair. · Off Cape Canaveral and outside the :southern half of the Indian River there are extensive banks and ridges in urgent need 0£ resurvey. Known depths of 11 to 16 feet a long way offshore show the need of further surveys to make certain that all the shoals are correctly charted. From Jupiter Inlet to Fowey Rocks, where the Florida Reefs begin, the deep water a:pproaches so close to the shore that it will be a slight task fo complete ms.hore workin connection with the offshore surveys; (See fi~g. 11, opposite p. 62.) ~ . 39. GENERAL, ATLANTro, AND GULF CoAsTs._:._An explanation' of :the method used in verifying the location of a vessel by sounding when objects on shore a:re obscured by distance or thick weather will show why a:ccurate charts are partl.cularly needed from New York to' Falm Beach and from Key West to the Mexican Border. At fixed intervals the vessel takes soundings, which are plotted to the scale 0£ the chart on tracing paper and this is moved over the chart, keeping the~line joining the soundings parallel to the course of· the vessel until the. soundings agree with those ;shown on the chart. If· the charts are correct and based on a sufficiently modern survey, the method is one of the best kiiown for verifying the ship's position. If,

62

on the other hand, the. soundings are few and far apart so that the ship's soundings fall between them,- and if those on the chart are wrongly placed, this method becomes much more difficult and an accidental agreement mf!y lead the vessel into danger. From New York to Cape Hatteras the charts, while fairly good; are by no means good enough to meet the full needs of navigation, but the work required to bring them up to date has been postponed, as the need for resurveys has been more urgent farther south. Up to a few years ago the offshore surveys from Cape Hatteras to the Florida Reefs were almost unbelievably deficient. This condition is being remedied as rapidly as possible, and between Winyah Bay, S. C., and St. Augustine, Fla., the offshore work out to the Gu.If Stream is complete. It is important that this work be extended both north and south from its present limit as rapidly as possible. 'With adequate funds full advantage can be taken of the seasons, and by working north in the summer and south in the winter the cost of tlie work will be greatly reduced. (See fig. 11, opposite p. 62.) 40. INDIA~ ~IVER.-Thei:e have been no recent surveys of these waters. Rev1s10nary work is needed. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 62.) 41. {3rsc.AYNE BAY.-Recent surveys have been made of this area out to the 100-fathom curve, in the vicinity of Miami and as far south as Fowey Rocks. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 62.) 42. VrnrNITY OF FoWEY RocKs Lwn·r.-No recent surveys have been made. Inshore and offshore work is in progress eastward from Key West, which includes this area. The present surveys are not sufficient in detail. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 62.) . 43. COAST OF FLORIDA FltOM p ALM BEACH AROUND TO CEDAR MYS.For a distance along the shore of 567 miles from Palm Beach southward around to Cedar Keys on the west coast of Florida coral reefs are found, in some places more abundant than in others. Coral reefs, whether the result of disintegration or of a building up by animal growth, are found in a great variety of forms and in vast numbers of sharp projections from the general bottom, where conditions are favorable for the growth of coral. While we are informed that an enormous number of uncliarted rocks exist in this region, due to the fact that they are so numerous and that the region is so large, an effort has been made to first drag areas of the coast used by commercial and naval vessels because of both the time ana cost involved. Wire-drag work is accordingly undertaken in localities where there are commerce and naval operations. To accomplish even this will require years of work. Westward-bound vessels . through the Florida Straits have to force their way against the strong current of the Gulf Stream, which in places attains a velocity o:f 5 miles per hour. Along the northerly edge of the stream and close to the reefs the current is very weak. There is a strong temptation to keep dangerously close to the reefs and save fuel, and this is the cause of frequent accidents. Besides the danger of running into the known reefs, which are in many places bare and are of no great depth throughout their length, another danger, the extent of whiGh is not :fet known, has been discover~d in a ~econd~ry ree~, parallel to the mam reef and about one-half mile outside of it. This secondary reef is found to approach the surface in places as a na!row ridge, with depths as little ,as 25 feet. Twenty-five miles of this reef ha".'e been examined, but 200 miles remain to be examined. It is impor-

tant to nearly all the great traffic entering the Gulf of Mexico that this examination be· completed at the earliest possible moment; During the past year up to December, 1920, a vessel has been continuously employed on the surveys of the Florida ·reefs between' the Marquesas Keys and Fowey Rocks; this includes supplement.ary sur~ veys of the channels through the reefs from deep water mto the inside route lying between the reefs and the mainland ; also the close development of the shoal area westward of Key West and southward of the Marquesas Keys. In ~onnection with this the work has been carried out to the 100-fathom curve for a distance of 50 miles along the reefs. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 62.) 44. VESSEL COURSES NoRTH FROM KEY WEST.-Vessels bound :for eastern gulf ports naturally wish to take the shortest route. If of light draft, they can cross the Florida Reefs at Key West. The next channel is between Rebecca Shoal and Dry Tortugas, and if this is not used, vessels must pass well to the westward of Dry Tortugas to avoid a shoal bank west of it. The Rebecca Shoal channel has been dragged and has ample depth of water. The bank west of Tortugas should be dragged, espeeially as vessels making land from the westward have to cross part of it. Northward of the keys from Key West to Tortugas a doubtful area should be dragged. The necessity of this is emphasized by the fact that the U. S. S. ElJAs, while steaming northward of the Marquesas Keys recently, struck a coral head which proved to have only 7 feet over it. This coral head was directly out of a depth of 35 feet, with no indication of its existence until struck by the naval vessel, which was severely damaged. The channel between the keys and the reef known as the Hawk Channel is important for moderate-draft vessels. It will be necessary to drag the axis of the channel to insure against dangers to the vessels making use of it. . 45. CAPE RoMANO.-This area is in need of surveys. An inspection of the existing maps and charts of the State of Florida show practically a blank area for that part of the peninsula south of Lake Okechobee. There are but few areas of the United States of like size about which so little definite information can be obtained. N orthwai:d of this unknown region drainage canals are opening up the country for development. It is not unlikely the same means will be extended southward. At the present time the Bureau should prepare to meet a demand in the near future for the delineation of a broader belt of country back of the shore· from Cape Sable to Punta Rosa than is now shown on our charts. Tourists and land prospectors are now exploring this intricate system of island and water. . . ways. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 62.) 46. CHARLOTTE HARBOR.-No recent surveys have been made of this area and it should be resurveyed. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 62.) 47. TAMPA BAY AND APPROAOH.-The existmg surveys at present meet the needs of navigation of these waters. (See fig. 12, opposite . . . p. 62.) 48. CEDAR KEYS..:_No recent surveys· have been made of this region. ·Wire-drag surveys are badly needed. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 62.) ' 49.

REPORT OF. DIB]j)CTOR, COAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

50. INSHORE WATERS, GuLF CoAST.-The chief characteristics of the west coast of Florida ·are the distances to ·which shoal water extends offshore between Cape Sable and Cape Romano and from Tampa Bay to Apalachicola and the existence of a large number of bays connected with the sea by deep channels, either natural or dredged. From Apalachee Bay to Cape San Blas the coast begins to assume a character more like the· South Atlantic coast, and coral bottom is no longer found. · This stretch of coast is sandy and sand shoals extend off some distance, especially in the vicinity of Cape San Blas. This region needs a resurvey, and, like other sandy portions of the coast, will need resurveying from time to time. The Florida and Alabama coasts differ somewhat, as deep water approaches close to the shore in. the latter. The coast of Mississippi and Louisiana has a very large proportion of changeable area, and resurveys are needed now and will be needed from time to time in the area· from Mobile Bay to the end of the offshore shoals of Vermilion Bay. The immense load of sediment carried by the Mississippi River, especially in. time of flood, causes constant changes in the delta. The deposit of sediment and the action of the waves on the deposits result in rapid growth in some places and of erosion in others. Sixty miles west of the Mississippi Delta there begins an extensive shoal :region which is in need of survey. The inshore region along the rest of the' Louisiana coast and the Texas coast, with an important exception,. has deep water fairly close to the shore. The exception is along the eastern riart of the Texas coast from Sabine Pass to Galveston. Sabine Bank and Heald Bank have shoal depths at a considerable distance from the shore, and they should have a thorough resurvey.. Galveston Bay also needs re~ surveying; (See fig. 13, opposite p. 64.) · 51. ST. JosEPHS BAY.-No recent surveys' have been made of this area, and a reexamination is needed. ,(See fig. 13, opposite p. 64.) · 52. OFFSHORE w ATERS, FLORIDA REEl'S TO THE MEXIOAN BORDER.Alone; the northern edge of the Florida Straits the soundings are insufficient, and they wm have to be carried out ,somewhat beyond the 100-:fathom curve. Along the west coast of Florida the distance out to the 100-:fathom curve is about 100 miles. Over much of this area the depths are moderate and the charts are based on reconnoissance surveys only. The bottom is coral rock in many places, and projections from cora~ ba:i:iks·mat come sufficiently near the surface to be a menace to nav1gat10n:. Fishermen ~ave reported several uncharted ridges, and while the somewhat incomplete surveys of the reported localities have not. confirmed all the details of their reports; important differences from the charted depths have been found. The 100-fathom curve approaches fairly close to the Mississippi Delta; then swings offshore again, so that it is about 60 miles south of Sabine Pass. It then swings to the southward in a curve, which brings it within about 80 miles offshore at the Mexican border. , This whole offsho1~e area is badly in need of a thorough resurvey. There: is no other part of the work in offshore water so likely to. be productive in furnishincr important changes in existing charted depths. (See fig. 13, opposit~ p. 64.) . .· . · , 53. PENSACOLA BaY.~Surveys have recently been completed m the entrance to the bay; the entire bay requires reexamination. {See fig. 13, opposite p. 64.)

LAKE PoNCHAR'I'RAIN.-In connection with the survevs in Mobile Bay and Mississippi Sound, a recent survey has bee:ri made at the eastern end of the lake. The greater part of the lake has not been examined for 20 years. (See fig. 13, opposite p. 64.) 57. APPROACHES TO MrssrssIPPI PASSEs.-The offshore work which has been in progress westward for the past two years from Mobile entrance has been carried to a junction with recent surveys north of Chandeleur Islands, and has been interrupted temporarily to make, at the request of the Army Engine~rs~ a_n e.xamination of the approach to Southwest Pass of the M1ss1ss1pp1 out to the 50-fathom curve. This was nearl:y complete at the close of the fiscal year. (See fig. 13 opposite p. 64.) · 58. VERMILION BAY AND CoTE BLANCHE.-No recent surveys have been made of these areas. Surveys are needed. (See fig. 14, opposite p. 66.) 59. APPnOACH TO SABINE PAss.-No recent surveys have been made here; revisionary surveys are needed. (See fig. 14, opposite p. 66.) 60. The. su~veys .of Porto Ri~o were begun when the island C!J-me under the Jur1sd1ction of the Umted States as a result of the SparushAmerican War. By 1910 the surveys of the bays, channels, and inshore waters were completed and a number of deep-sea soundings were taken around the island. There are, however, extending to the eastward and westward of the island and alOng the south coast extensive areas where the bottom is of co1·al formation. There are also reefs along the north coast, but as they are close to shore, and must· be avoided by vessels, it is only important to know their location and limits. The areas on the east, south, and west are diiferent in that there is traffic between the teef and over areas where the depth is little greater than the draft of the vessel, and the probable existence of uncharted projections is a source of danger. Vieques Sound, between Oulebra and Vieques Island, east of Porto Rico, Virgin Passage, and the approaches to the harbors of the ·American Virgin Islands are in need of wire-drag surveys. The only work o:f this character that has been accomplished here is in the vicinity of Mayaguez. This work resulted in the abandonment 0£ one channel and the rebuoying of another. A surveying steamer and two launches, specially constructed for wire-drag work_,~ arrived July 5, 1921, at San Juan and commenced operations in v ieques Sound. (See fig. 15, opposite p. 66.) 61. VIRGIN IsLANDs.-The Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark, and the United States took possession in 1917. The surveys that have been made are by the British and Danish Governments. At the present time the available hydrographic data regarding these surveys are bein()' examined with a view of determming whether'they are sufficient fur the needs of our naval and commercial vessels. It is certain that the coral formation in the waters touch.: ing these islands requires extensive wire-drn.g suneys before acour~te charts can be issued. Topographic surveys oi' these islands were

requested by the Na~ Department. The triangulation was ex- . tended eastward from I orto Rico for the control of the topography. St. Thomas and St. John have been completed urnl St. Croix was completed last ,June. In connection with the "·ire-drag suneys of Porto Rican waters there will be a hydrographic examination o:f the water area surrounding the Virgin Islands to supplement the British and Danish surveys. 62. PANAMA CANAL.-The Atlantic approach to the Panama Canal has been surveyed since work started on the canal construction. Limon Bay is, however, a region where pinnacle rocks occur. All the anchorages should be dragged, and the work should be carried a short distance outside. The Pacific a pp roach to th. e canal has had a recent survey and has been dragged. (See fig. 16, opposite p. 66.) 63. PACIFIC CoAST OF THE UNITED STA'l'Es.-The western coast of the United States is very different from the eastern. Generally mountainous, with comparatively :few harbors .or inside waterways, and with comparatively deep water close to the shore, it presents little resemblance to the low shores and wide continental shelf of the Atlantic. The purpose o:f the survey is, then, to meet the needs of vessels approaching :from. seaward and coasting vessels which keep to a :few comparatively narrow tracks, to insure up-to-date charts of the various harbors, to make soundings offshore, and to develop fishing banks that are known to exist. The weather is an· important factor in increasing the importance of the charts of this coast. From Los Angeles Harbor northward fog is very common in the sulnmer time, and in the winter gales accompanied by thick weather are of frequent occurrence. On the coast and in the vicinity of San FraJ}cisco thick weather is prevalent for perhaps 25 per cent of the time.· Under such conditions the navigat(')r must rely entirely upon his chart, and it is essential that detail surveys be made to the 100-fathom curve, which is beyond the limit of soundings taken by merchant vessels. Along the shore of southern California much work was do.ne uf. to 1895, and some of the surveys then made may be accepted as ?na . In the vicinity of the outer islands surveys extended. only a httle way from the shoreh..and the deep waters between and outside of them are unsurveyed. The few soundings taken show irregular bottom, and breakers have been reported in places where the .chart shows 600 fathoms. These waters, therefore, .should be surveyed out· to the 1,000-fathom depth. The Oregon coast is practically unsurveyed. A limited amount of work was done years ago south of Cape Blanco and in the vicinity of the Columbia River, but this was not .more than a reconnoissa:rice and does not extend out far enough to b~ of practical value to. navigators., Elsewhere no surveys have ever been undertaken until recently. Even in such an important locality . as Cf!-pe Bla?co, ~hich must b.e round.eel by all vessels plying ~etween the Columbia River and San Francisco, there a:r:e,no. sou,ndrngs to serve as a guide in thick weather, and vessels have been lost wholly on account of this lack of surveys. On the coast of Oregon there are eight important harbors on which the Government and private interests have expended approximately $40,250,000 in improvements. designed to facilitate navigation. One of these is the Columbia River1 the gateway to one of the most important transportation centers of

the Pacific coast~ Yet, iri spite of the immense expenditm es for improvements, there is not a single one of these harbors the approad1es to which have been adequately surveyed. The· approaches to the Columbia· River have been sounded for a short distance offshore, but even in this area the soundings are too far apart to more than indicate, in a general way, the depth which may be expected. This partial suney extends southward along the coast to include. the approaches to two other harbors. The approaches to the remaining five, on which $.3,826,000 have. been expended in improYement, are entirely unsurveyed. The entire 'Vashington coast stands in nrgent need of a first survey, except in the approach to the Straits of Juan <le Fuca and in the straits themselves, where the present work is ade· quate. (See fig. 14 ·opposite p. 66.) 64. Los ANm~LES HAnnon.-Los Angeles Harbo1· should be dragged. A revision survey of Los Angeles Harbor ·and· approach· was completed during the first half of the fiscal year. . .· 65. SAN FnANCISO BAY.-San :Francisco Bay is of varied character of bottom and needed surveys vary to correspond. The immediate approaches are complete except in the vicinity of Farallones. Here p,dditional sounding is needed, and an investigation should bc1 rH:1de. with. the wire drag to Yerify the existence of other rocks than those charted. · "\Vire-drag work has been carried through the Golden Gate and inside, both northward and southward of San Francisco :to the limit of the rocky area. The resm·vey of the·bar outside the Golden Gate has been completed. Surveys in the southern part of the. bay; have also been cqmpleted and the r:wision 0£ San Pablo Bay, will shortly be taken up. ·. . 66. AwNas.noru~ W ATERs oF THE PACIFIC CoAsT STATES.-'-From the western end of the Santa Barbara Channel to Montei·ey Bay the surveys, as a rule, extend only to the 50-fathom curve, which lies but a short distance offshore. The surveys should he extended seaward to include the usual track of coastw!se vessels, which lies an average distan.ce of about 10 miles from shore. From San Francisco Bay to Point Arena a widely spaced system of sounding lines has been carried out to the 100-:fathom curve. Here an additional amount. of work, about equal to t~at already accomplished, is necessary before the survey can be considered complete. Between Point ·Arena and Cape Mendocino the surveys extend a uniform distance of 6 miles from shore1 reaching depths varying from 50 to 600 fathoms. Addi~ tional detailed surveys should be made in the vicinity of each cape; and between them the work should be carried seaward to beyond. the: steamer track. The offshore surveys have been in progress for the past two years, extending from Point Arena to the northward· of Cape Mendocino. A party with a chartered launch made a survey of the Umpqua River bar. The necessity for such surveys is shown, by the location of the hitherto uncharted submarine valley north of Cape, Mendocino, which was a factor in causing the wreck of the steamer

Bear.

From Cape Mendocino northward to the Oregon·boundary.the lim.,. ited surveys .existing made niany years· ago are e~tirely i~adequate. A complete survey should be made at the earliest possible date.; There are no adequate surveys of the inshore .area along the State.of· Oregon. Of .the water off the northern part. of the Pacific· coast,

68 1

little is known, except that the Bureau of Fisheries, acting on the information obtained from fishermen, has located certain banks. .These banks should be surveyed to determine their depth and extent; .and it is believed that a general survey carried out to the 1~000-fathom curve will result in the discovery of other banks of great value. (See fig. 14, opposite p. 66.) · · 67. lNTERIOR 'VATERS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON.-The interior waters of the ~tate of 1Vashin:gton represent the point of change from a practically straight coast line to the broken formation of the coast of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. There are many channels of importance leading to Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, Bellingham, and Olympia, and connecting with the inside passage to sontheastem Alaska. All these waters should be dragged wherever there is the slightest doubt as to the presence of dangers to navigation. (See fi~. 20, opi>osite p. 68.) 68. STEAMER ROUTES, SOUTHEASTERN AI..ASKA.-In southeastern Alaska the first and most obvious need is to complete the wire-drag work. Most of these waters have been sounded, so that only dragging is necessary to complete the survey. This drag work should be taken up in the order of its importance, beginning with the main steamer.. route throu~h the region and then taking up the various tributary waters leadmg to areas of commercial importance. For some years past parties have been actively engaged in dragging the main steamer routes, and this work is now about 70 per cent complete. One of these parties has completed Stephens Passage northward from Frederick Sound, as well as Gastineau Channel to Juneau, and is now engaged in Lynn Canal. · 69. THE OUTSIDE COAST w ATERS OF THE ISLANDS BORDERING ON THE OPEN PACIFIC.-These and their connecting channels are largely nnsurveyed and should be navigated with great caution. A navigator seeing the chart on which the shore line is sketched-no soundings, several rocks and shoal banks, notes as to rocks and breakers reported. and a statement on the chart to the effect that the area is unsurveyed~ is, to say the least, unable to proceed with confidence, and this situa-. tion is by no means unusual. The same pressing need of such regionk is a complete hydrographic survey, followed later in places by wiredra~ work.' The rapidly increasing commercial importance of thi~ regmn and the exceptionally dangerous character of the ·waters through which traffic must pass render surveys in the near future imperative. Work on the outer coast is now in progress northward from Dixon Entrance. Surveys were also in progress in Clarence Stmit and Dixon Entrance. (See fig. 21, opposite p. 68.) 70. CRoss SouND TO PRINCE WrLLIAM SouND.-From Cross Sound, the northernmost channel from the inside waters to the sea, · to Prince William Soun<b. the coast has few features of present or prospective importance. There is, however, urgent need for surveys to msure the safety of vessels approaching and passing this coast. In this region the charts are very defective in the manner of showin[r soundings and prominent coastal mountain peaks n.nd headlands th:at would enable the navigator to obtain his position on approaching from seaward. The only important break on this coast, Yulmtat Bay, has some canneries, and. additional surveys are needed here 011 this account. (See fig. 21, opposite p. 68.)

a. Pnl:NCE WILLIAM SOUND TO UNil\UK Pass,....:-A very .impprtant section of the Alaska coast extends from the waters· of Prince William Sound westward. to Unimak I~ass. . Not only are the, industries. of present importance, but theve,are extensive mineral resources ;largely undeveloped through lack of cheaper transportation. 'rhe .point to be emphasized is that this is n<;>t an old, settled country, wjth its needs in the matter of transportation fixed, but it is still capable of great future development, and: in c.onsidedng .the needecl surveys its future must be taken into aecount. The approaches to. Prince 'Villiam Sound have been.surveyed, and .no resurveys.for the present are needed except in the vicinity of Cape. St. Elias a:n.d Middleton .Island. Wire-drag ·work will be needed in bQth of these .localities, a~ reefs and pinnacle rocks exi~t. Prince WilU,am .S?und nee.ds addit10nal" soundings over most of ;i,ts al'ea, ap.d many of.,1ts :hnµ;10hes need original surveys. .Cordova is the terminus of .the Copper R,~yer and Northwestern Railway, which gives access to· the impo.rtilnt copper mines on the Coppel' River, The approaches to Cordova ha.ve be~n surveyed, except for wire-drag surveys needed to in,s.ure com_pl.ete saf~ty. Seward, ~m Res~rrection Bay, is the terminus of tl}e AJfls!>:a Railroad now bemg bmlt by the Go;v~rnment. Tb,e surveys of. its approach are completed except for wire-dl'ag work, It. is probable that much of the trade originating along the line of, the Government railway will be transshipped at Anchorage, at the head of .Cook l:p.let. Not .only will this make it necessary for. many vessels to nav~ate these waters, but. there are now very large salmon canne1:ies all along its shor.es, as well as considerable mining. The present surveys are inadequate, and wire~d.rag wol'k is .needed ov.er much of its area. Kodiak Island, with a number of canneries and with some cattle grazing, is largely unsurveyed. From Kodiak Island westward to Unimak Pass surveys are now in progress; onl;: a CQmp,11.ratively small part has been . surveyed at present. 'V"hile t).1e amount of present traffic is sma.11 it is sufficient to need protection. At present the Coast Guard v.essels and the freight and passehger vessels run grave risks Jin using the protected natwaJ channel leading along the coast inside the island, . This is a particularly bad stretch of coast, with many reefs and i~lands. Only in the vicinjty of the S,humagin Islands and from Ummak Pass to Unalaska !E"la:nB have surveys been made, p,nd they are imidequate. It is not now practicabl~ to drag the entire area, but it is important that the immediate needs of navigation, .even ~hough of limited amount, be met by dragging n..selectea channel, to msure the safety pf ves~ls :from Shelikof Strait to Unimak Pass. Unimak Pass is the almost universally used channel into Bering Sea. It has been surveyed, but· it is probable that part of it sho.uld b13 dragged or .at least :further soundings be taken. Surveys were in progress :from Shelikof Strait westward to Metro:fania 'Island during the season of 1920. The operations were hampered by a shortage of fuel oil, and with the expectation of a .continuance of this shortage and the high price of the oil during ~he season of 1921, it was decided to. postl?on,e surveys in. this sectio-P, Wltil n;1}other year. (See fig. 22, opposite p. 68'.) . .. . . . , .. 72. Ar.EU'l'IAN Isr,ANDs.-The.

{}f:th,is :service a few years ago was:wholly due to the lack 6f nde.'<1nate surveys. (See fig. 22, oppositerp. 68.) · ' ·· n. BnrsTOL BAY.-:-A large part of the salmon shipped from Alaska co hies 'from Brist61 Bay. This is without surveys except in Nushagak Bay and Kuskokwim · Bay and River. Both of these have recent surv~ys, but: as the bo~t9m is subject t<! change on account of the large rivers, future add1t10nal surveys will be needed. As· an example of what surveys mean in a new region, the discovery of an entriince to the Kuskokwim River suitable for moderate-draft vessels opened up .an immense area for grazing, and also in places for general aO'rfoulture. (See fig. 22, opposite p. 68.) 14. NORTON SouND.'-The importance of Norton Sound is due to the gold mining on its northern shores and as being ¥the outlet of the Yukon Delta on the southern shore. In all of Norton Sound additional surveys are needed. It· is curious that in this sound, which according to all available information is of quite level, sandy, or muddy bottom, Besboro Island rises very abruptly to a height of 1,012 feet. With.such an occurrence it is not absolutely certain that no pinnacle rocks exist. (See fig. 22, opposite p. 68.) . 15. BERING SEA AND AitCTIO OcEAN.-Except in the vicinity' of Pribilof IsJands, there are no other existing surveys in Bering Sea or to the north which can be considered of value. (See fig. 22, opposite p. 68.) · , 16. GuA1\r.-The present chart of the Island of Guam is compiled from Spanish and British charts and some harbor surveys by the United States Navy. No attempt at a comprehensive survey has been made. . A complete survey should be made, not only ineludihg the harbors, but the surrounding waters, carrying the work out to a depth that will be certain to include all dangers. In these waters shoals rise abruptly from great depths, and the absence of soundings on the charts does not imply safety, but simply absence of surveys. 17., HAWAUA~ IsLANOS.-There are only two good harbors' on all the Hawaiian Islands, and both of these are on Oahu Island. All of the islands except Hawaii have coral reefs around at least part of them. In the vicinity of Oahu, Maui, Kahoolawe, and· the south coast of, Molokai the surveys are ~airly complete. In .the :vicinity of Hawaii the surveys are very inadequate except in the only harbor, Hilo Bay. The west coast of Lanai and the vicinity of the two westernmost islands, J auai and Niihau, are practically unsurveyed. The various channels between the islands :from Taui to Oahu .are fairly well surveyed. The others are practically Without surveys. (See · 13,g. 23;. opposite p. 70.). 78. PHILIPPINE lsLANos:-The Philippine Islands are composed 6f not less than 3,000 islands and isl.ets covering an area of approximately 150,000 square miles, and about the sa,me as that of the five N ~w England Sta.tes and. tl1e: St~1,te of ~ ew York combined.. The total length of the general coast hne, measured on small-scale charts using 3-mile spaces of dividers apd omitting islands and bays less than 3' miles lbng, is approximately 10,850- miles, or' about the same as that for the entire Atlantic coast of the. United States, il),cluding the islands. , The. unsurveyed hydrography covers a large ar.ea on .ac9ount of. the nece8sity ,of extending this work, in:· some. localities, for many miles offshore, and on account of the very extensive area o:f the Sulu Sea.

coast of Luzon from Polillo Island northward to Aparri; the region off the north coast of Luzon, including the Babyan Islands, Balintang Channel, the N a:tan Islands, and Bashi Channel ; the entire· west coast of the island of Palawan; the south coast of Mindanao, from Pola Point to Malita, in Davao Gulf; the Sulu Archipelago and the Sulu Sea from the Tubbathaha Reefs south to the limit of our·i)ossessions off the coast of Borneo. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 72.) 79. NoRTHEAST COAST OF LuzoN.-This entire unsurveyed region, from Polillo Island on the south to· Aparri on the north, is of little commercial importance, and being quite free from dang~rs to navigation, the execution of the work is being delayed until more important localities are completed. Little reliable information relating to this region is available, but a number of good anchorages have been reported. Among these are the inner harbor -of Port San Vincente,. Dilasac Bay, Casiguran Sound, and Dingalan Bay. The first and third mentioned are excellent typhoon harbors. The work must, however, be done during the se1ison of frequent typhoons, it being impossible to approach the coast at any other time of the ;y:ear on account of the heavy sea qaused by the northeast monsoon. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 72.) · 80. OFF NORTH CoAST oF LuzoN.-A survey should be made of the islands and the waters to the northward of Luzon as far as Bashi Channel, as, in accordance with the numerous reports, there is considerable uncertainty in regard to the true location of the islands and the rocks that are dangerous to navigation in the locality. As it is in the region visited by frequent typhoons, the work should be undertaken during the period when the typhoons are less :frequent. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 72.) 81. WEST AND EAST CoAST OF PALAWAN.-The coast line of the ·island of Palawan is very irregular, indented with deep bays forming some of the finest harbors in the archipelago. The whole region about the island and extending southward to Balabac Island, Banguey Island, to Cagayan Sulu, and off the north coast of Borneo.·consists of coral reefs, many small islets, and innumerable hidden dq,ngers to navigation. 'l'o the westward of Palawan, reefs and dangers extend to over 100 miles offshore. The hydrographic survey of this region involves an immense amount of labor. A preliminary survey for the location of channels through the reefs and entrances to harbors will first be necessary, after which these localities must be swept with the wire drag. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 72.) 82..WEST CoAST OF MrnnANAo.-This island is of little commercial importance due to the absence of harbors and having a rugged mountainous country adjacent to the coast which is not adapted to the growth of any of the staple i;>roducts. The usual steamer tracks do not approach the shore withm 4 or 5 miles, a sufficient distance to avoid all dangers. For these reasons the surveys now in progress have been pos~oned for more important localities. 83. SouTH COAST OF MrnnANAo.-This stretch of about 160 miles, from Pola .Point to Malita in Davao Gulf, is similar in many r;espects to t.1e west cioast. In general, it is bold and steep, with numerous outlying reefs, which, however, do not extend a great distance from shore. The triangulation for f:urnishing the controlling positions for the hydrography and topography presents a difficult problem~

the shore line being invisible from the peaks and ridges but a short · distance back. 84. SULu AROHIPELAGo.-This region, about 75 miles wide, extending in a southwesterly direction from Zamboanga, on the southern coast of Mindanao, to 'the coast of Borneo, a distance of about 180 miles, has scattered oyer it about 300 islands and islets and numerous hidden dangers to navigation. Surveys in this area are now in, progress. It requires a survey of the most careful and intricate character, and much of the lot::ality must be swept with the wire drag after the present hydrographic survey is made. The formation is coral and dangerous to navigation, as rocks are frequently found in localities where they are least expected to exist. The currents in the region are very strong. The physical conditions are such that . excel~ent control to cob~dinate the work with t~at alon~ the coast of Mmdanao can be obtamed. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 72. J 85. SuLu SEA.-The northern end, as far south as the Tubbataha Reefs, except certain small area: has been surve~ed with a fa~r degree of accuracy, but owing to the coral formations, where hidden dangers frequently exist, wire-drag sweeping will .be necessary in selected passages. A large part of the region to the south of the Tubbataha Reefs remains unsurveyed except for a reconnoissance with approximate locations by navigational methods. A survey of this area is now in progress. Numerous rocks and reefs dangerous to navigation are scattered throughout the sea, but certain well-defined passages have been examined with sufficient accura,cy to make navigation through them reasonably safe. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 72.) MAGNETIC WORK. 0BSERVATORrns.-The five observatories now jn operation are not adequate for an extensive and detailed magnetic survey of the United States and outlying territories. This was clearly evident during the last few years in our efforts to secure sufficiently accurate data to reconstruct the secular change lines on the new isogonic chart for 1915. The lack of personnel for field work was partly responsible for this, but even if the usual number of observers had been in the field, the results of the recent unusual change in the secular variation would not have been so readily apparent or so precise as would have been the case had a magnetic observatory been in operation somewhere in the northwestern part of the United States. In the outlying territories still greater areas are without adequate facilities for r~istering the magnetic variations. Especially important are the vanal Zone and the region of Guam which lie directly in the path of two most important trade routes. FIELD W ORK.-In planning the field work for a magnetic survey of the United States it was decided to establish one station at every county seat, and the work has been carried on with this end in view. At present there are about 175 county seats to be occ~:pied. Observations have been made at sli~htly over 7,000 land stat10ns i, the United States and outlying terntol'ies. Reestablishing stations that have been destroyed and occupyjng stations in newly· incorporated counties is work of a continuous nature. ·

Throughout the United States there are a great numbei· of localities which are magnetically disturbed and which ·l'e<}Uire additiona 1 observntions at auxiliary stations in order to be able to represent them eve.n fairly accurately on our isogonic charts. From the viewpoint of the practical engineer it is .as important to know the magnetic declination iit points 1 or 2 miles apart in a disturbed region as it is to know it at points 50 miles apart in a region that is undisturbed. Special observations to determine the extent of locally disturbed areas have been made at about 156 places in the United States ·and outlying territories. A glance at the isogonic chart will show that there is still a great amount of work to be done· before these regions are all investigated. Observations for secular change during the pnst :few years have been so few that the 1920 editiou of our isogonic chart has been delayed until additional data are received. Another phase of field work is the investigation .of. secular change in regions <?f local disturbance. Only a very hrtnted amount .of data ,1s ava1labla for a study of this problem. · A systematic survey for this data is a matter for future consideration and may involve more labor than anticipated. Another subject for :future consideration, no less important than those mentioned above, is the magnetic survey of the coast line. At present this is lacking in detail because most of the available data have been obtained only as opportunity offel'ed during the progress of other work.
TIDAL A.NP OUIUlENT WORK.

The first stage of the tidal work for the coasts of continental United States may now be considered as oompleted, so that very accurate and extensive tide tables are being furnished the American navigator. Although the harmonic analysis, which is made use of in the :grediction of tides, has not yet reaohed a state of perfection, further study of the method may be made from the observations at the representative principal tidal stations maintained for other purposes by the Bureau at the larger ports along the coasts, and the annual tide tables issued by the Survey have been brought to a standard ranking well with the published tables of any other nation. More .detailed tidal and cl,irrent work in connection with the development of the principal harbors of the United States is required for the purpose of furnishing necessary data to engineers. charged with this development, both for commercial ~md military nnd naval purposes. The port of New York is greatly in need of such systematic and detailed tidal and current surveys, both for the use of the mariner in furnishing him more accurate pl·edictions for the berthing of large vessels in that part of the harbor where strong currents m(l.ke it hazardous, and at times impossible, to berth a large vessel except very near to the times of slack water, and also for the use of Federal engineers charged with the efficient and economical expenditure of. large sums in the development of this harbor. A beginning ha5 been made so far as funds would permit,. by securing from time to time current and tidal observations scattered over the harbor; bl.lt the problem complicated by the harbor being made up of a bq,y, .a tidal river, and two straits connecting independent tidal bodies ma.Q.e

necessary slmultaneous observations over the area before conclusive ·and accurate results can possibly be reached. Such systematic tidal and current surveys have not been made in any of the harbors of the United States and should be carried out in the order of the commercial and military importance of the different ports, beginning with New York. In the matter of currents it can not be said that even the preliminary work has been completed. Observations are not only necessary in the different harbors, but along the coasts, so that current tables for the use of the mariner may be built up. At present the Survey is making predictions of times· of slack water at only five places on the Atlantic coast and foU:r places on the Pacific. These predictions are of tidal currents only and even less has been done toward the predictions of currents due to winds. The Survey has made use of every available means for securing observations for the study of current conditions alon~ the coasts. It has secured the cooperation of the Lighthouse Service and mar~ iners in securing information on currents. What is now needed are short series of current observations made by a Survey vessel at designated vital points between light vessels which will link together the observations made at these light vessels. The methods used by the Survey in the observation and reduction of currents are such that from the same set of observations the wind currents and the tidal are deduced. Under physical oceanography, comprising miscellaneous oceanographic observations and computations for the purpose of furnishing information relative to densities, temperatures, ocean currents, and related matters to navigators, engineers, and scientists, very little has been done and much is required to bring our state of ·knowledge and amount of information to that of other even less important nations. At our door is the Gulf Stream, a study of which 1s one of the most important items in oceanography which should be continued by the Survey. Considerable work of a reconnoissa nee nature was done a number of years ago by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in this important field, but lack of funds has not permitted further work. . At present observations of densities and temperatures are being secured at four of the principal tidal stations maintained by the Survey. These will be extended during the current fiscal year to cover all principal stations. In the matter of tidal bench marks it is evident that the goal to be aimed at is the establishment of one or more bench marks at each important place on the Atlantic, Pacific, 1md Gulf coasts of the United States. The most economical method, however, to accomplish this is in connection with hydrographic surveys and jt is this system that the Bureau is following. At a number of points the Survey has for many years been establishing bench marks along the coasts based on long series of tidal observations at its principal tidal stations, and the time has come when these stations, many of which have been discontinued, should b(\ visited and new bench marks established where old· ones have been destroyed. The only work being done along this line is .that at stations which are at present in oper!ltion, and there remain all old

stations yet to be leveled and new marks established. This important work should not be delayed lon~er, for these bench marks protect, in many cases, long series of tidal observations costing many thousands of dollars and the duplication of which would require not only many thousaJ?-dS more but many years. . To the present time new bench marks have been established and old ones releveled only in connection with other survey work, and while this makes for economy and will be continued there is also great need for a special tidal bench-mark party for reestablishing of bench marks at stations that have been discontinued. At any one station this work will be necessary only every 5 to 10 years.

CHAPTER III.
PROGRAM FOR CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IN THE FIELD.
GEODETIO WORK.

The precise traverse started in ·Wisconsin during the fiscal ymn· 1921 will be completed to Duluth, Minn., where a connection will be made with the triangulation of the United States Lake Survey. This traverse in Wisconsin will then be extended southward a1id westward from Ladysmith to La Crosse, on the Mississippi River. This is a line 0£ traverse which will eventually be extended across the southern part of Minnesota and in the northeastern part of South Dakota, where it will connect with the ninety-eighth meridian precise triangulation. Precise leveling will be begun in the spring of 1922 following the line of precise traverse from Green Bay to Duluth. Triangulation will be extended in Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico to complete an arc which will extend from the vicinity of El Reno, Okla., to Williams, Ariz. Triangulation will be begun on the arc which will extend from the vicinity of Pecos, Tex., northward into Colorado. This line will run through eastern New Mexico. Precise leveling will be run in the State of Oregon from Portland, Oreg., to W allula, Wash. This line will connect t,vo of the main lines of precise levels of the country. Another line in Oregon wiU be run from Bend to Prineville. Precise levelin/? will be run from the vicinity of Green River, Utah, io Halls Crossing, thence down the canon of the Colorado River to Lees Ferry, and from that place southward to Flagstaff, Ariz. A reconnoissance will be made in Montana and Idaho for the selection Qf precise-triangulation stations along the boundary between the United States ahd Canada. There will also be made a reconnoissnnce in northern Minnesota for the purpose of selecting precise-triangulntion stations for an arc along the international boundal':'"· Precise leveling will be begun in Montana and Minnesota in the spring of 1922 along the Canadian boundary following the reconnoissance which will be made during the summer of 1921. The triangulation along the boundary is part of a general scheme which is bem_g undertaken by the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Geodetic Survey of Canada, looking toward the completion of an arc of precise triangulation from Lake ~uperior to the Pacific coast. In the winter of 1921-22 precise traverse -w_ill be run in the State of Mississippi, extending the line that was begun in the winter 0£ 1920-21. 76

, Precise leveling will be done in New York to revise the leveling which' had been previously carried on in that State and to make a connection between certain pieces of existing work. . · In the SJ?ring of 192~ a line of precise leveling. will be ~eg~m ~ear the Canadian border, rn northern New Hampshire. This lme is a part 0£ a line of leveling which will extend from northern New Hampshire to Portland, Me., and thence along the coast, touching at Boston, Providence, and other places, to New York City. The determination 0£ the intensity of gravity and of the astronomic latitude will be mad~ at a irnmber of stations in the States of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The precise triangulation of Puget Sound will b~ completed during the fiscal year 1922. Precise trian~ulation will be continued in southeastern Alaska to the northward or Dixon Entrance. The work in Puget Sound and in southeastern Alaska is part of a general scheme which is being executed by the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Geodetic Survey of Canada, working in cooperation. It is being proposed to extend the precise-triangulation system of the United States from the vicinity of Puget Sound, northward along the coast to White Pass, just above Skagway. From that voint the Geodetic Survey of Canada will extend, precise triangulat10n down the Yukon River to the crossing of that river by the one hundred and forty-first meridian, which is the boundary between Alaska and Canada. When this work has been completed, geographic positions on the North American, or final, datum, will be available for northwestern Canada and for Alaska. This will be of great value to those engaged in surveying, mapping, and charting within the areas mentioned. Pract,ically all 0£ the work outlined above, to be done during the fiscal year 1922, has been requested by some competent authority or it is working toward a plan for the completion of the precise control of the country.

TIDAL AND CURRENT WORK.

In order to utilize fully the series of systematic current observations made on the different light vessels on the Pacific coast durin& the past two years in the building up of satisfactory and useful current tables for the use of the coastwise mariner, short ser.ies of curi·ent observations should be made along the sailing lines between these light-vessel stations for the purpose of linking together th~ current conditions along the whole .coast. During the present fiscal year it is proposed to make a beginning of this work along a part of the Pacific coast by utilizing one of the Survey. vessels for about two months between survey seasons. While this addition to the regular program of tidal and current work will necessitate. a curtailment of other very important normal activities, it is thought that th~ vital information obtainable should not be longer kept from the mariner to assist him in keeping his vessel .from the .rocks along a coast where the current conditions are most complicated. Principal tidal stations, representative of the tidal conditions along their different stretches of coast, will be continued at the following places:
Portland, Me. Boston, Mass. Delaware Breakwater, Del. Baltimore, Md. Fernandina, Fla. Key West, Fla. Cedar Keys, Fla. Galveston, Tex. San Dies-o, .Calif. San Francisco, Calif. Seattle, Wash. Ketchilmn, Alaska.

GEODETIC' SURVi~Y.

In order to carr? out the field work· on currents at intermediate stations on the Pacific coast as previously outlined, it has been found necessary to curtail somewhat the current work on the light vessels on both coasts. On the Atlantic coast observations will be continued only on Nantucket Shoals and Diamond Shoals Light Vessels for the full year and at Charleston light vessel for a :few months, until a short series of observations are made in the immediate entrance to Charleston Harbor, so that predictions for this port may be included in the new current tables which will be issued for the year 1923. On the Pacific coast current observations will be discontinued temporarily at all light ves~els except Blunts Ree~. Obse~ations on all these vessels on the Pac1fi? coast, ho~ever, "!111 be agam ta~en up when the Survey vessel begms observat10ns at mtetmediate pomts along the coast. In order to maintain a fixed zero of staff, a most essential matter in securing a long series o:f tidal observations, tide staffs of standard design with special backing piece, cap, and stop have been designed during the past year and installation made at thtee of the principal stations. It is a pa.rt of the program of tidal and current work for the current year to install these standard staffs at all principal stations maintained by the Survey. Datum planes for the use of the engineer and the mariner, based on tidal definition, are the only ones wliich lend themselves to coordination of surveys widely distributed and brought togetqer. The Survey has for many years by means of its principal and subsidiary tidal stations established bench marks and is furnishing to engineers in all parts of the country descriptions and elevation of such bench marks based on mean sea level. Since an accurate determination of mean sea level can be obtained only ftom a comparatively long series of tidal observations, the value of such bench marks and the importance of their preser'Vation is very evident. A large number of important bench marks determined by long series of observations at stations which have been discontinued are in danger of being lost. While the present modest appropriation will not permit of maintaining a level party to visit all stations and save all such bench marks :from destruction, it is planned to visit and level as many as possible during the current fiscal year beginning with the most important ones. Because of the destruction by fire of the principal tidal station ut Fort Hamilton, N. Y. the Survey is not at present maintaining :~ station in New York Ifarbor. tlowever, through cooperation with the United States Army Engineers, who are operating a number of ~auges in this region, tidal information for this important harbor lS being secured and kept up to date. Arrange;ments nave been made with the Eng'ineers to take over one of their stat.ions upon their 1fo:;. continuing t1dal work here. ·

[W; C. HODGKiNS.]

The .work of the field station consisted largely in supplying information in regard to charts and other nautical matters to the yachting and general maritime public; also in supplying charts and publications to the several sales agents as necessary to enable them to meet extraordinary public demands upon their stocks. A fairly large number of such publications was also disposed of by .direct sale to the public, some seeming to. prefer to deal directly with the Bureau when aware of tl1e establishment of the field station~ In addition to the strictly maritime information furnished as stated, many inquiries in regard to other activities of the Survey, and also of other Government bureaus, were received and answered as fully as the available information would permit. · .· · · Frequent calls from the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, and other·public services for copies of our charts.and publications haye been honored so far as possible. From time to time, and from various sources, information has been collected for the correction or improvement of the charts of this inspection district and; when deemed of sufficient importance, this has been communicated to the ·office at Washington. The special incident of the year has been the establishment of a new tidal Eftation at South Boston. That station, situated on Commonwealth Pier No. 5 . by the courtesy of the Massachusetts Department of Public' Works, is supplied with an automatic gauge, of the customary Coast Survey pattern, an'd has a · specially ·designed fioa t tube of steel provided with a conical base of cast iron, through a small aperture in the apex of which the sea water finds entrance to the tube. Preliminary steps toward the establishment of the tide station were taken in the winter months, but it was not until May S, 1921, that the gauge was put in operation. Since that date, it has functioned without interruption or serious mishap. ·Lines of spirit levels were t·un from the gauge to bench marks of the city of Boston and of the Navy Department in other parts of South Boston in order to have permanent marks or reference for the tide planes. · The clerk ·.attached to the field station, since the establishment of the new tide station has acted as tide observer and has also observed the density of the sea water at the station.

During the year 3,685 charts were sold; 776 charts were furnished for official use of the Army, Navy, Shipping Board, United States district attorney, and other officials; 2,588 calls were made in person, by letter, and by telephone for charts and publications and for information. An inspection was made of the motor launch Elsie Ill, in company of tlw officer in charge of the section of vessels and equipment, and repairs were arranged for and made under the direction of the inspector· until the arrival of the chief of party and the transfer to him of the· launch and equipment Cll July 27 .. Tide and current observations were contipued in New York Harbor during the season, and every possible assistance was rendered in installing a selfregistering tide gauge at Port Newark, N. J., and a tide observer was furnished for the tide gauge in the Harlem River for a short time. Proposed locations of tide gauges by the U. S. Engineers in the East and Harlem Rivers were reported to the office, and an inspection of certain locations was made in company with the representative of the section of tides aml currents. · Permission was secured from contractors operating dredges in the.East River to make current observations from their floating plants. An uncharted rock in Kill Van. Kull was reported and request was made to have its position determined. · Three chart agencies in New York City were inspected, and inventories were made of their charts and publications. Minor repairs were made to the tide station at Fort Hamilton, and a new tide gauge was installed in December. The total destruction of the station by fire was reported a few days later. A. visit was made to the office of the U. S. Engineers at Albany, N. Y., in order to secure data for correcting the charts of the Hudson River. A sketch of the triangulation o;f' the upper part of the Hudson River and the coordinates of the station were also secured and forwarded. Fifteen piers under construction by the city in the narrows on the Staten Island shore were located on the chart. The times and heights of the, tides at pier "A" and the barge office for the period September, 1920, were tabulated for comparison. A tabulation showing the location of the stations for tide obsei:vations made by the city from 1885 to date was prepared giving dates of occupation to indicate the tidal records ·available for discussion. The summation of the hourly heights of the tides.at San Francisco, Calif., for 1905 was partly completed. · The clerk of the field station was detailed to assist the officer in charge of the Coast and Geodetic Survey exhibit at the National Motor Boat Show held in New York, December 10-18, to install and care for .the exhibit, and the inspector attended on several evenipgs to aid in furnishing information. Every, thing possible was done to make the exhibit a success. The field, station wm; removed from 428 to room 503 in the customhouse. An officer of the Survey, in addition to the inspector, was on <luty at the field stat.ion, except when absent on leave, until the end of December. Tide-gauge readings from t.lie reconls of the ·u. S. Engineers' oflice were copied, and tide curves were plotted from the U. S. I<:ngineers' records of gauge readings at nine stations in New York Harbor and transmitted to the office at Washingtf>n. Data for the correction of charts were compiled lllH1 furnished. Material and instruments for the vessels of the Survey were inspected and forwarded.. Apparatus for observing currents was placed 011 the Harbor Channel and Stickland Lightsb,ips. Times of tides at Governors Island, Santly Hook, and Hell Gate Ferry, Astoria, were compiled and furnished for publication. Au investiglltion was m1ule and consultation held with the chief of tile division of tides awl curreuts with a view to planning sinrnltuneous obse1Tatious of currents at a number of stations in New York Harbor in cooperation with the U .S.

ence wus lrnd.with the chief of the Coast and Geodetic Survey party.enguged in tidal and current' surveys in New York Harbor. It was found that the pipe necessary for the estnblishment of the tide gauges in Harlem River by the U. S; Engineers had not been received. Consequently the chief of the Coast and Geodetic Survey party was furnished with two Coast and Geodetic Survey automatic tide gauges· nml instructed to proceed with the :mrvey in Newark Ruy, thus allowing more time for the completion of tbe engineers' tide gauges in the Harlem River. 'l'he Coast and Geodetic Survey part~· was inspected on October 12, the records examined and found to be in good condition. While it was impossible owing to congestion of traffic in the East River to locate all current stations in mid-channel. exactly as contemplated in the instructions for this work, this has been done as far as possible under the circumstances. It is commendable that this work has been carrie1l ou in u locality such as the East River ancl Hell Gate without an accident or damage to the equipment. On completion of the above work, the inspecting officer proceeded to Boston, Mass., and conferred with the inspector of the field stat.ion at that place, wit!} the U. S. Engineer Office and the city engineers in regard to the establishment of a principal tidal station at that port, and also in regard to any tidal or current. observations in progress or completed. In regard to the matter of a favorable location for a principal tide station, it was found that tbe State engineers had been operating at intervals an automatic tide gauge of their own design on Commonwealth Pier No. 5, but. that the operation of the gauge had been discontinued. This station could be secm~ed for the purpose of installing a Coast and Geodetic Survey automatic gauge. . Automatic tide gauges have been ruu at times by the city engineers, met.ropolitan State engine<'l'S, and Federal engineers at Moon Island, Deer Island, Charles Rivet'. Dam, and at the navy yard. No current observations hnve been made. The officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey returned to Washington, October 15, and resumed his duties as chief of the section of tides and currents.

A subparty was placed on board the drill boat of the New Jersey Shiubuil11ing & Dredging Co. operating ofl' Twenty-third Street. Only a partial record "'as obtained by this party, due to the fact that tile drill boat had to be moved a considerable distance with the aid of tugs. Various difficulties were encountereit by this party, as equipment had to be shipped from one encl of tlle·bont to the other at each change in tlirectiou of the current.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

No unusual conditions were encountered at these stations, and tl!e part~· gained experience for the more hazardous stations in the East River. Work in the East River might be considered as beginning with the station between Rikers Island and Barretto Point. A drill boat of the New Jersey Shipbuilding & Dredging Co. was engaged in blasting a ledge of rock· in the center of the channel. Advantage of their position was taken by anchoring the launch about 500 feet to eastward of them in the axis of the channel. From this point-that is, between Rlkers Island and Hunts Pond-to the Battery the traffic in the East River is very strictly ·regulated by the War Department through regulations issued by the Corps of Engineers. Violations by tug masters were reported by inspectors on the dredges and drill boats and resulted iu fines ::md loss of licenses, so that traffic exercised due care and! caution in the vicinity of dredges, dynamite boats, and the launches of the Corps of Engineers: In order to inform passing craft as to the nature of the work, a large sign was carried on either side of the launch. These Rigns were approximately 4 by 8 feet, made of white oilcloth bearing the caption "U. S. Coast Survey" in black letters about 8 inches in height; beneath were the words "At Anchor" in red letters about 14 inches in height and a warn· Ing " Keep Clear " in black letters about 8 inches in height at the bottom. The special Coast Survey day signals and night lights were lilso carried. The light at night, however, proved to be confusing to traffic, especially the larger and faster boats. The green· lights could not be separated the maximum distance, and doubtless at a distance were mistaken for one light. Fortunately, the launch was equipped with· an excellent whistle, which when operated with 80 to 100 pounds of air pressure could be distinctly heard at a distance of a mile or more. When a vessel seemed in doubt of the launch's movements four blasts of the whistle served as a warning. This signal was regularly .used by all the floating craft, such as dredges, drill boats, pontoons, etc., and was well understood by tug masters and pilots to mean to either slow down or use caution in passing. In the lower East River, where traffic was too dense to be continually on the lookout, use of the Coast Survey signals was dispensed . with entirely, and two red balls by day and two red lanterns at night were used. Thereafter very little trouble was experienced with passing craft. Only in Newark Bay, where the tug masters stubbornly chose to dispute the right of dredges, etc., to restrict the channel, was any serious difficulty encounterecl. Stations in the East River were occupied as follows: Throgs Neck, Barretto Point, Lawrence Point, Bronx Kill, west .end of Hell Gate, between Blackwells Island Light and Ballets Point, west side of Blackwells .Island, east side of Blackwells Island, off Twenty-third Street,. New York; off Brooklfn Navy Yard; under Brooklyn Bridge; north end Buttermilk Channel; between Governors Island and the Battery, and in Newtown Creek. · Following the completion of observations in the East ·River on October 15, 1920, a day was spent making some repairs to the tide station at Fort Hamilton, under the direction of the inspector of. the New York field station. On October 18, 1920, the party proceeded to Newark Bay, and pending the arrival of an automatic tide gauge from the office was engaged in establishing a plain staff at Greenville, between Jersey City and Bayonne. Permission was obtained from the Submarine Boat Corporation to use a house arid well at the end. of their dock, where a tide gauge loaned by the Coast Survey had formerly been established. The party returned to New York, secured a tide gauge, and with the assistance of the inspector the gauge was put in operation on October 20, 1920. The services of a field engineer for the Submarine Boat Corporation were secured to look after the gauge and note the staff readings on the mari· gram. Frequent inspections of the gauge were made by the current .party, Beside the tide stations noted above, an automatic tide gauge was maintained by the Army Engineers at Shooters Island; plain staffs were also read at Un-coln Highway Bridge, over Passaic River, and at Elizabethport during periods of observations nenr those points. The following stations were occupied in Newark Bay and tributaries: Entrance to Arthur Kill, below Central Railroad of New Jersey Bridge at Bayonne; above the Pennsylvania Railroad bridge; near the junction of the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers, and at points in the Hackensack and Passaic· Rivers near the bridges carrying the Lincoln Highway ·or Plank Road over those streams. No unusual conditions prevailed in Newark Bay, the current in the main being fair with the channel. In the rivers a difference· in the time of.' change was rioted between surface and subsurface currents. Traffic in Newark Bay is mainly the movement of freight in barges. Some difficulty was ex·

perienced in avoiding traffic at the station above the Pennsylvania Railroad, and one tow which fouled the anchor line necessitated cutting the line to clear . . Upon completion of work in Newark Bay instructions were received to take up the work in Harlem IUver, occupying the stati(IHS from Spuyten Duyvll to the southward. The week of November S:-13 was used to establish automatic tide gauges and do the necessary leveling at Spuyten Duyvil .and Willis Avenue B.ridge. Little or no difficulty was experienced with trnffic nt any of the stations. At Broadwa~' Bridge all towns and most smull boats m;e the southern -channel on. account of its being .a clear fairway. But little difference could be noted in the current in either channel. The piers for High Bridge constrict the channel to such an extent that dangerous velocities are generated at· that point. Traffic uses the center opening In the middle of the . river, whlle observations were made under the western opening. It is believed that there is but little difference in the velocities through these openings. The above station was the last station occupied, being finished on November 24, 1920. As it was necessary to close work on or about December 1 in order to bring the Elsie. Ill south to Baltimore, the rest of the month was spent in painting and overhauling the launch and in dismantling the tide stations. The party was disbanded with the exception of two officers. . · The party during the above season was aided materially by the experience anu methods of the current party during the season of 1919. The lnspect~r of New York field station was of the greatest assistance, with advice, in procurin~ information from the Army Engineers and in communicating with the Washington office. On December 1, 1920, the launch Elsie III left New York. The inspector accompanied the party to Fort Hamilton, where a new automatic gauge was installed in place of the one then in use some years. The party. proceeded to Tompkinsville, thence to Elizabeth, N. J., where a supply of gasoline was taken aboard. The party arrived, in Philadelphia on December 4, 1920.' A stop was made here over Sunday, continuing the journey the next day, and arriving in Baltimore on December 8, at which place orders were received to conti1;rnc to Lewise'tta, Va., and there· turn the launch and equipment over to H. B. Campbell. At Baltimore an officer was detached from the party. The launch ·arrived at Lewisetta on December 10, 1920, and the transfer was made, after which the chief of party proceeded to Washington, D. C.

Under instructions dated Januai·y 4, 1921, an inspection was made of the tide station on the Wilson.Line Pier at Philadelphia, and arrangements were made for. running levels between the tide gauge and bench marl·s upon receipt of instruments. It had been intended to discontinue the tide station at Phllad~phia, but this intention was reconsidered, and the observer was directed not to dismantle it but to carry out instructions in regard to Atlnqtic City. · Upon arrival at Atlantic City on January 14 the rainy weather prevented work on that da:y. Levels were run on ..January 15 and 17, .and the gauge was ·dismantled on the 16th. The observer then returned to Philadelphia and on .January 21 completed the necessary leveling, returning to duty at the Washington office on January 22.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR,- COAST AND GEODETIC SU~VEY.

Beyond the limit of Yisibility of the buoys the lines were to he run to the 100· fathom curve, spaced 2 miles apart to and 4 miles apart beyond the 25-futhom curve. The usual procedure customary for the control of the offshore lines waH to be followed. : By the close of the season the inshore hydrogrnphy was finishetl from latitude 38° 28!' to 38° 50'. 1'he sounding lines on this work were run east and west. Offshore hydrography within the same limits was finishNl. The offshore lines run about southeast and northwest. The 'inshore hy<lrography between the latitudes 38° 34' mul 38° 44' hml been done by the party of the Isis in 1919: There were three areas within this work which had to have additional development. This development wus made, 1rncl the only important discovery was a 30-foot sounding on the ridge running northeast and southwest in latitude 38° 41!' and longitude 74° 45!'. The doubtful 30-foot sounding about 2 miles southeast of Indian Rh·er Inlet could not be verified. Careful sounding in this vicinity gave no depth less thnn 43 fePt, HIHl it is assumed that the 30-foot sounding was nn error on the part of the leadsman. The spots close to shore between Indian River Inlet nnd Bethan~· Bl!ach on which 18-foot soundings are shown on the present chart were cnrefully developed. No shoaler water was found. Particular attention was paid to the uneven bottom a couple of miles offshore and exte~ding from the vicinity of Signal Cotton Patch to the southern limits of the work. All the shoals in this area are shown on the present chnrts, although they have moved n little from their former positions. The work in one place was carried a little below the southern limits as instructed in order to finish the development of the shoal about 2 miles east of the I<'em1-ick Island Life Sitving Station. Several lines were run in the vicinity of the wreck, position doubtful, about 4 miles north of Fenwick Island Light Vessel. While sounding in this vicinity the submarine sentry was towed at a depth of 10 fathoms. There is a long shoal in this vicinity which may have been caused by the wreck, but this seems rather doubtful as it is so large. The bottom is very uneven along the lines of the survey buoys. A great denl of development work was done, especially at the northern end of these. Hen and Chickens Shoal just off the point of Cape Henlopen was deYeloped with the launch. The shoalest sounding obtained whlle making this development was 9 feet. The present chart shows three-fourths fathom on this shoal hnt probably it has been washed away, and the least depth is as obtained by this survey. In addition to the regularly plotted lines a number of lines were run without plotting, sounding in the breakers, etc. Nothing was found. Several channel lines were run in the deep channel in the immediate vicinity of the approach to the bay, about 5 miles east of Cape Henlopen. There are 20 to 25 fathoms in this channel and the sounding was done with the trolley rig. The channel is about 8 miles long and extends southeast from the 0Yerfalls Light Vessel. The instructions of May 26 specified that McCrie's Shoal and Five Fathom Bank were to be developed on the same projection. In order that no holes would be left in the work a small triangular space was sounded at the junctiorl of the three hydrographlc sheets, 3079 which is the previous work, 4093 the present sheet, and the next sheet to the northward. This triangular space Is just west of McCrie's Shoal. At the 100-fathom curve quite a pronounced ravine was found. This ravine is in longitude 73° 55' and extends north from latitude 38° 05' to 38° 15'. This raYine was crossed with three lines, and a fourth line wu& run just north of it to marlr its limits. Instructions dated .June 23 directed an inspection of the current apparatus in use on board the Overfalls Light Vessel. This inspection was made on July 20, and a report was forwarded to the office on July 31. The current observntions are receiving close attention aboard this vessel, and to all appearances they nre doing good· work. About the end of September the master of this light vessel secured material for making a new current line from the Baohe. Par11gr11ph 13 of. instructions of May 26 directed that the necessary buoys for this worlr be constructed by the party rather than to borrow the navigational buoys fl·om the Lighthouse Senice as 1111cl been tlonB in the past. After a stud~· nf thP yarlons types of lnwyH It wns decided to adopt 11 ln10y with three barrels for buoya!lcy. This work was turned OYer to one of the officers to work out the plnm; nnd build the buoys. They proYed very Rlll'Cessful after a few minor ehnnges, which experience showed were necessnry.

on the construction and hanQ.ling of these buoys was ,forwarded to the office on. A:u~nst 13. Owing to these ~uoys being directly in the fairway nnd ,not bemg hghted, several we~·e lost m the ct>urse of the season by ships running them down. , '.rhese huoys cun be hamlled by the sh:p, and no time is lost waiting for the lighthouse tender to plant or shift them. , , 'l'heir total cost of construction is less thun the mnount charged us by the Lighthouse Service for 1leiireclnt:on on their huo~·s and the use of the tender in placing or shifting them. Their construction by the field party renders the Coast Survey independent of the other bureaus. ' The officers and men get valuable seamanship information in handling them. 'l'he disadvantages in their use are that they can not be made .a.s strong as the navigational type of buoy and 'probably can not be made strong enough to stand a whole gale. There is a great dC>al of wear and tear on the ground tackle of the, ship in handling them, and tlrnre is considerable danger of serious accident to personnel in handling them.· · They can only be handled in smooth weather, and this is the best working , weather for offshore hydrography, hence the field work suffers. A set of instructions giving full information for the running of precise deadreckoning lines and the final plotting of the soundings was prepared, to be used by the oftlcers of the ship.. A copy of these instructions was forwarded to the office August 14. Instructions were issued under date of August 18 to make a series of tests of the, newly devised sounding tl!hes. These tests were to be made in the vicinity of the finished hydrobrraphy in order to have a check on the soundings from the actual contours of the bottom as lletermined in the usual manner. 'J:wo lines from the 15-fathom curve to the 100-fathom curve were run in making these test'!. One line was run with the ship running at full speed between soundings and · stopping to take vertical soundings every 5 miles, the other line was l'll,D with the ship running at 6 knots an hour and sounding while under wa~·. '.rhese latter soundings were spaced about 2! miles apart n'nd so arranged thut every other one was taken in about the same location. us the cot·respomling vertical sounding on the other line.. These tests proved very satisfactory. A complete report of these tests was forwarded to the offi"" on September 18. Paragraph 11 of instructions of May 26 directed that if possible 50 consecutive hours of tidal observations be made on Five Fathom Bank with the apparatus especially designed for this purpose in the office. Weather conditions were very unfavorable for this work until the latter part of September when a couple of days of calm nn:d smooth weather allowed the, apparatus to be inst.alled and the observations made. A special report of this work, describing the installation, of the apparatus and the results of the observations, was made and forwarded to the office on October 13. By the end of September the hydrographic work had been completed from the southern limits of the work to McCrie's Shoal. Arrangements were made for the closing of field work in the vicinity of Lewes and then proceeding to Beaufort, S. C., to coopemte with the party of the Mikaive in th!;! inshore work in the vicinity of Port Royal Sound. Instructions directing this change of base were issued under date of October 5. The vessel sailed from I.ewes the afternoon of October 7 and arrived at Beaufort, S. C., the afternoon of October 10. After conference with the nssistant chief, division. of hydrography and topography, and the commanding officer of the Miloawe, the vessel proceeded to Savannah, Ga., the mornin'g of October ll.

reinforced with wire rope, loops of which· were run. out on opposite sides for fastenings for the lowering lines. A tide sta:lf 1 by 1 inch by 10 feet, graduated to feet and two-tenths, was set in a cylindrical float of wood H inches in diameter. This float and staff operated inside the pipe, the top of the staff extending out through a square hole cut in the cap over the top of the pipe. Staff was read at the top of the pipe. Four concrete anchors 2 ·by .2 by 2 feet; weighing between 1,100 and 1,200 pounds each, and No. 6 galvanized wire were used in mooring the pipe. The anchors were a little too light, the;r lose about 500 pounds when immersed in water, and any future work should use anchors weighing or having at least 1,000 pounds effective holding power. The anchors were placed about 100 feet from the bottom of the pipe just below the cap and four small sheaves, one for each guy wire, were secured to ·this flange by wire loops. (Shackles could not b~ used in securing these on account of the leads of the guys and the small amount of material in the flange.) , The guys were led through these sheaves and set taut with a fence wire stretcher purchase, securing each guy back on itself when set up. There was a small amount of vibration at the top of the pipe, which made the ·apparatus more trustworthy as this prevented the float from adhering to the· sides of the pipe. It was noted that when the staff was pulled up above or forced· below its flotation level, it took some time for it to resume its normal position. A onefourth inch hole was drilled near the bottom of the lower 12-foot section. This was about 7 or 8 feet above the bottom of the ocean and high enough· t<> eliminate any chance of its becoming clogged; with sand. The installing of this apparatus with the equipment of the Bache was rather. a difficult piece of work, and a number of mistakes were. made. It was finally installed by anchoring a whaleboat with the.stern in the immediate vicinity of the desired location for the staff. The pipe· and block were swung under the launch, the block being about amidships and the pipe extending aft past the. stern of the launch. A line to hold the end of the' pipe was brought from tbe end of the pipe to the stern of the launch and made fast. Lowering lines were made fast to the wire loops on the sides of the concrete block. The launch ran· alongside the whaleboat, one set of lowering lines were pa'ssed to the whaleboat and secured, the other set of lowering lines were slacked away from the launch until those on the whaleboat had the strain; the block was then directly. under the stern of the whaleboat. It was lowered away from the whaleboat. The line from the end of the pipe was held, and as the block was lowered the end of the pipe naturally came up out of the water and into position. The pipe could be held upright from the anchored whaleboat, while the anchors were run to position and the guy wires, which were free when the anchors were let go, brought to the pipe and made fast, setting taut as pre.viously described. The· pipe and staff were placed in position about 2;80 p. m., September 28., The staff did. not work correctly for two hours. The cause of this was probably . that the float was becoming water-logged or rather watersoa:ked during .this time until it had absorbed all it would take. This occupied about 8. hours. About 6 or 7 o'clock the tides as shown by the staff were regular, and excellent observations were obtained. ·Hourly observations were continued until 9 a. m., September 80, when the increasing wind and sea and rapidly falling barometer made· it imperative, for the Bache to run for Lewes. In all, three excellent highs and three excellent fows were obtained. The range· is practically the same as at Lewes, Del., time about 1 hour earlier. Currents were observed simultaneously with the tides. These currents are plotted on the sheet of polar coordinate paper accompanying this report. It is not.ad that slack currents occur at about the time of low water, and· that an, average current, setting ·80 degrees true with strength of 0.5 knots, obtains at high water. ' . The pipe and staff were installed about one-fourth mile 25° true from Buoy 2 TS marking the southern end of Five Fathom Bank, approximately in latitude 88° 51' and longitude 74° 88'.

Instructions issued February 8, 1921; provided' for a continuation of the resurvey from northward to the approaches .to Chesapeake Bay. This. resur" vey had been begun in 1919, but had been suspended during 1920. . ' The .details are simi~ar .to those of previous years. , Survey buoys were to be placed Inshore and. fixed-position hydrography carried from the shore to the limit Of visibllity of the buoys. The offshore work was to extend from the limits of the visibility of the buoys to the 100,000 curve. As the signals in this vicinity had been destroyed it was necessary to re· build the 100-foot signals on Mink Hill between Cupe Henry, Virginia Beach, and. at Ship Shoal Inlet and to rebuild the 40-foot signals on Smith. Island bet:ween Cape Charles Lighthouse arid Ship Shoal Inlet before hydrography could be started. In order to .have these signals built by the tim.e the ship was ready to begin operations, a subparty was organized to work. on shore. Between M.arch 21 and April 18, two 100-foot signals· mentioned· above .and three 40-foot signals on Smith Island were built. A tide staff. was ·established at Fisherman's Island and an automatic. gauge erected at Assateagne Harbor on . . April 5.. Before doing any hydrography the; compasses 'vere adjusted and the· ship swung for deviations. The logs were tested ~nd their factors computed. '· · Hydrographic work was begun on April 13 and was in progress at the close of the yeai:. At .that time the hydrography had been finished between liltitud.es 37° 00' 'and 37° · 08' and between longitude 75° 15' and 76° 00'. Some spots needed a little development in this area. In addition to this, one line was run to the· 100,000-fathom curve and extended to the 1,000-fathom curve to test the new sounding machine. This offshore line was along latitude 36° 36'. The sounding line was placed as follows : One-quarter mile apart, crossed by lines 2 miles. apart, between the shore and the 10-fathom curve; one-half mile apart from the 10-fathom curve to the limit of visibility on the buoys;. 1 mile apart from the limit of visibility on the buoys to the edge of the inshore sheet; and 4 miles apart from the .limit of the inshore sheet to the 100-fathom curve. The hydrography was all done from the ship except the development of Nautilus Shoal. This smal,l amount of work was done with a launch party..

C., from .July 1 to 16, 1920, undergoing mnergency repairs. During this period the officers and crew of the vessel were engaged in office work on sheets and records and in miscellaneous ship work. Repairs were completed on thc 16th, and on the 17th the vessel left Elizabeth City to return to the working grounds. On the, evening of the 17th, in the vicinity of Brant Island Shoal Lighthouse, the vessel became disabled by boiler trouble and on the 18th was towed to Oriental, N. C. From July 19 to 22, the ship was at Oriental while repairs to her \)oiler were being made by the ship's force. She left Oriental on the 22d and proceeded to New Bern for coal. On .July 23 she returned to the working grounds and resumed field work. From .July 28 to October 21 combined surveys were carried on in Neuse River and Pamlico Sound. Until the latter part of September the progress of the work was very slow, due to unfavorable weather. The work was also interfered with during the entire period covered by this report by the shortage Of officers and. the weakness of the vessel. Details of the work accomplished after July 28 are given below. Triangulation s.tation Maw on Maw Point, established in 1913, was recovered and re-marked, and station Brant I. III wus recovered. The latter station was found out in the water, and a new station, Brant I. IV, was established 011 tllt~ island and located by measured angl~ and distance from the old station. To. carry tbe triangulation eastward into Pamlico Sound, new stations were estab: lished at Point of Marsh, North Swan Island, und on the point on the east side of the entrance to Cedar Island Bay, these stations being located from the line Maw-Brant I. IV. Brant I. Slue Beacon and Cedar Island Beacon were also located during the course of this work. A 20-foot signal was erected owr station Maw, and 32-foot scaffolds with 16-foot instrument tripods were erecte(l over the other stations in the main scheme. , The position of Neuse River TAghthouse, which was included in this scheme, was found to differ from the position obtained earlier in the season from the trianb'1llation in Neuse River, and the two schemes were then connected by observing the lines Broad Creel;: Beacon-Maw and Mid 2-Point 2, the entire work being recomputed as a continuous scheme stnrHng with the line Cockle 2Gum Thicket in the Neuse.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Tybee Island to Port Royal Sound and including Calibogue Sound, making connection at Port Royal with the hydrograpby of 1916. The instructions also provided for a topographic survey, primarily a plane-table traverse, for the location of the necessary hydrographic signals, of the same area including the contiguous islands. The Bache arrived at Savannah on the evening of October 11. Until October 18 the party was in Savannah engaged in making field projections and gathering data for the field work. Actual field work was begun on October 19 with a signal-building party. From that date until December 4 the work was in progress as weather permitted. On the latter date the work as called for in instructions of October 15 was eompleted and the party moved to St. Helen~ Sound. For the hydrography of Tybee !loads enough natural objects, consisting principally of lighthouse range towers, werP st1in<ling, and no additional signals were necessary. The Army Engineers had a scheme of triangulation, including a measured base, covering Tybee Island. This scheme was connected with the triangulation of Tybee Roads, and. a quadrilateral and their signals ( 40-foot towers) were used both in the hydrographic and topographic worlc. A tertiary scheme of triangulation, consisting of 3 quadrilaterals and a final .triangle, for location of hydrographic and topographic signals only, was extended up Calibogue Sound from the three points-Tybee Island Lighthouse, ' Bloody Point Front Range, and Do. The survey of the outer coast of Hilton Head Island was controlled by the position of Do at the southwestern end and the position of Hilton at the northeastern end, with Hilton Head Front Range and Deer as intermediate checks. The topographic survey was made on two sheets: One covering the outer cbast of Hilton Head Island from Braddock Point in Calibogue Sound to the sman ·creek about 2 miles north of Hilton Head, the other covering the remaining territory as called for in the instructions of October 15, 1920, from Skull Creek, at the head of Calibogue Souncl, to Tybee Creek, Tybee Island, the southern limit of the work. The survey of the outer coast of Hilton Head Island on sheet No. 1 was all plane-table traverse. On sheet No. 2 practically all methods of topographic surveying were used, including sextant ·locations of the greater part of the shore line on the sheet. The survey of the shore line of South Channel, Savannah River, from the east end of Cockspur Island to the western limits of the sheet, was made by the hydrographic party. The instructions of October 15, 1920, called for a resurvey of the .southeastern coast only of Turtle Island. This island has changed so much since the previous survey as shown on the preflent charts that it was necessary to rerun the entire island with the exception of the northern shore before a satisfactory connection could be made. · Few changes were found in the shore line in the balance of the region. Hilton Head Island has been washed in some degree, and the shore line has moved inland from its position on the present charts, as has the eastern shore of Daufauskie Island. Hague Point on D:tufauskie Island has been eroded more than any other point. . Along the marshy shores at the head of Calibogue Sound; there is a netw'.ork of canals and indentations. This shore line is covered at high water, and the shore line shown on the sheet is a generalization only of the outer edge of the grass line. This applies particularly to the area between May River arid Skull Creek. To really survey this section would require more time than its importance or need would warrant. · All the hydrography was small-boat work and was done on two sheets corresponding to the topographic sheets. In accordance with the instructions lines were run at quarter-mile intervals, with such additional lines as were necessary to develop the shoals and channels. The results of the bydrographic survey were startling in the changes found. Tybee Roads has changed so from the conditions as given on the present charts that new charts will undoubtedly be necessary. The most recent survey of the dredged channel from the .end of the jetties, Savannah :River, to the sea buoy at the entrance was obtained from the Army Engineers at Savannah and is submitted with the records. At the north end of Tybee Island a shoal with 1 foot at t]le ou~er end l~as extended about 1 mile to the eastward. The northern side of this shoal approaches the southern edge of the dredged channel very c1osel~. It is thought

REPORT; OF :DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

93

'.t}l11t this shoal will tend to build to the northward rather. than extend itself ,to. the eastward and that unless checked it will encroach on the dredged ch11nnel. Only time will tell whether this is correct. Incidentally, Chart No. 440 shows 15 feet of water over the outer end of this shoal. About 1 mile to the southward of this shoal, a large v-shaped shoal with its apex about H miles offshore commences. 'l'his shoal is shown on the present charts much smaller than it actually is. Between these two shoals there is 1t stretch of fairly deep water, 7 and 8 feet right up to shore.. This is interesting in that at the present time a landowner at this point has brought suit against the Government for damages·to this property, washing away, which he claims has been caused by the dredging of the channel. Another remarkable change is at the southwest corner of Hilt-on Head .Island. The present charts show little or no water between the island and the shoals immediately south. The present survey has developed a .narrow channel with 18 feet from Calibogue Sound to the sea following closely the shore line. The two shoals immediately south of Braddock Point are much larger in extent, while the shoal immediately east of the bell buoy (Bell Buoy No. 2 on Chart No. 440) is much smaller than the present charts show. A line of soundings was run from the mouth of Lazaretto Creek .to. the cuto tr connecting this creelc and Tybee Creek, through this cut-off and down Tybee Creek to its mouth. Fixed positions were carried throughout this line at all changes of direction. This line gives a valuable check on the positions of these creeks and also hydrographic information in regard to Tybee Creek. The Present. charts show no soundings in this creek. The hydrography off Hilton Head Island ·shows great changes from that shown on the present Chart No. 571. Gaskin Bank is much smaller in extent and has moved to the westward. Joiner's Bank, off Hilton Head, retains its general outline so far as that portion of it. which bares at low water is concerned, otherwise it also has been reduced. An excellent connection was made with the 1916 hydrography of Port Royal Sound although there seems to be a little more water at the inshore. ends of the offshore lines than the previous survey showed. ,. The self-reading tide gauge of the U. S. Engineers on the wharf at the north end of Tybee Island was used for this work.. The staff .of this gauge is set with its zero at mean low water-16.71 feet below Bench Mark No. 8. This setting was checked by ·levels before any observations were made. The selfreading device on the gauge reads constantly 0.2 feet. lower than the staff, and all observations have been corrected by aQ.ding this amount to them. This correction was determined by a number of sinmltaneous readings on both the staff and the self-reading gauge. · A tide observer was detailed .from the ship, and through the courtesy of Col. Hiner, Coast Artillery Corps, commanding officer,.Fort Screven, he was subsisted at that·post. A tide staff was .secured to Jenkins Float Post Light, at the head of Calibogue Sound, and daylight observations made on two days. These observations checked the information given in the Tide Tables for May River Range as compared wi.th Tybee Island 1.1, time about 1 hour later. In accordance with instructions of November 22, 1920, the soundings in Calibogue Sound were reduced using the Tybee Island gauge directly. Half-hourly observations were made from 9 a. m., November 22, until 5 p. m., November 25, for simultaneous observations with the automatic gauge established by the party at work north of Port Royal Sound. It subsequently developed that during this period the automatic gauge was out of order, and the Tybee Island observations went for naught. Fortunately the U. S. Engineers maintain two automatic gauges in the immediate vicinity of the Tybee Island gauge, one at the end of the jetties and the other just off Fort Pulaski in the Savannah River just below the quarantine station; and the necessary information can be obtained from that source to make the comparison. Particular mention is made of the cooperation of the U. S. Engineer Office in Savannah. This survey was one in which they . were vitally inter· ested, and they rendered every aid called for. Permission having been given by the Director, they were allowed to make a: copy of the boat sheet of Tybee Roads. This boat sheet showed the soundings reduced according to the pre-· dieted tides as given in the Tide Tables. · . . Through the courtesy of Capt. 0. J, Bond, Coast Artillery Corps, post quartermaster at Fort Screven, and formerly a field officer in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, gasoline was secui.·ed for the launches several times when the supply became exhausted.

Sa Yannnh, Ga., was use<l as a base for this work, the ship running there for supplies every week end. This port makes an excellent:base, although docking facilities are rather limite<l and some difficult.Y is experience<l in getting permission to lie at a dock on the Savannah side of the river .. Under date of November 20, 1920, supplemental instructions coYering the hydrography immediately south of the entrance to St. Helena Sound und north of the finished work of the party of the .i\fil.;awe were issued. This worlr was to· be taken up when the survey as ealled for by the instructions of October 15, 1920, had been completed. The Bache left Savannah the morning of December 7 and arrived in St. Helena Souud the same afternoon. The boat sheet for this work had been prepared ·by the party of the Milcawe; and hydrography was started the next morning. After two partial days' work the circulating pump of the launch engine broke down, and the ship proceeded to Charleston, S. C., for a new one, securing the same at the navy yard. The vessel returned to the working grounds on December 13, and during that week weather conditions were so unfavorable that only one .partial day's work could be done. The vessel was forced to run to Charleston for shelter on December 16. '.l'he office was advised by telegraph, and a telegram dated December 21 was received directing tlw commanding officer to close work and proceed with the Bache to the Coast Guard depot, Baltimore, Md., for repairs. But little work was done under the supplemental instructions of Novemllei20, 1920, and that little was done under such unfavorable weather and sea conditions that it is recommended the entire area be resurve~·ed. There is ahout a: weelr's work in this vicinity, with favorable weather, and signals built. Upon the receipt of the telegram directing the movement of the vessel t<> Baltimore, the boiler was cleaned. After coaling the ship on December 27, the Baahe left Charleston at 4.30 p. m. and arrived at the Coust Guurd station, Baltimore, Md., at 11 a. m. December 30, 1920. Exceedingly disagreeable weather was experience<l lletween Charleston arnl Cape Hatteras. Head gales and heavy seas reduced the speed considerably. The experiment of carrying steam on the donkey boiler and connecting it with the main boiler was tried on this trip. It was ·quite a success, and the vessel was able to carry 125 pounds of steam practically the entire trip even with inexperienced firemen. In accordance with instructions from the office, dated January 4, 1921, the Baahe was delivered to the Const Guard authorities nt their depot, Baltimore, Md., for repairs on January 5, 1921.

Old triangulation stations Hunt, Ott, and Hunting Island Lighthouse were used to get locations for new stations South, Fish, and J<;d. The new stations were marked iu, t.ic regulation manner. The topography done consisted in the mapping of tho shore line and contiguous territory (to about a mile in from shore on the average), including <'reeks, inlets, sloughs, low-water line where possible, and shoals offshore, along the coast from Port Royal Sound to Framptons Inlet, including the shore line. in the lower part of St. Helena Sound. , In general, locations were obtained .in the us.ual manner from· triangulation stations recovered or established.

outlying shoals, which wiis done by means of sextant angles on signals. The distances between the triangulation stations we1·e never great, and the traverse lines, being short, always closed well within the allowable limit. The bydrography done iri the period cm·ered by this report covered the following areas: Beginning with the junction of the work of the steamer Hydrographm· at the entrance to Port Royal Sound and extending along the coast to Framptons Inlet, with the·. exception of a small area· at· the entrance to St. B:elena Sound, to make ·a junction with the 'work of the steamer Endeavor, the offshore limit being a junction with the work of the steamer Isis at about the 3-fathom curve and extending in to the shore. In general the hydrography 'Was extended in to the inlets of nny inmortance to a distance of at least a J:Uile, 01' to a point where the depths were unchangeable. The spacing of the sounding lines called for in the instructions was closely followed, and consisted in running a system of parallel lines normal to the general trend of the shore line at a maximum distance of a quarter of a mile apart, narrowiltg to 100 to 200 meters·apart at important points. In channels, channel lines were run, crossed by lines running from one side of the channel to the other. Developments were made carefully whenever the soundings taken indicated the necessity for it. In general soundings were taken by means of the hand lead from the Mika10e or from the·motor sailing launch while under way at a speed from 4! to 5 knots at thirty-second intervals. Off the straight beach between intervals the bottom was found to be very even and close spacing of the. lines was unnecessary. Near the inlet, however, the bottom was lumpy and il'regular and differed very considerably from the charteu soundings, so a close spacing of the lines was very necessary. In general, inside the inlets the soundings agreed very well with the charted soundings. 'rhere were a number of shoals offshore and others extending a considerable distance 'out from the shore which were bare at low water, and a special effort .was made to get the low-water line on all these, the method used being to walk around the edges of the shoals at or near mean low water, as shown by the tidal predictions. and to locate them by sextant positions taken at frequent intervals. In order to obtain tidal corrections for the reduction of soundings taken, tidal observations were made at four points on the working grounds. · Throughout the season, readings of the staff gauge at Fort Fremont, Beaufort River, were. taken at half-hour intervals f1·om 7 a. m. to 5 p. m. by a careful Tl1is staff was connected by means of simultaneous observations with a staff at Station Creek, where several months of tidal observations had been taken a few years previously. For about two months in the latter part of the season tidal observations were made· at Peters Point, St. Pierre Creek, Edisto Island, at first by means of n staff and later, when ~n automatic gauge was received, by means of that gauge. This station was also connected, with the Fort Fremont staff by means of sinmltaueous observations. · In order to get tidal col"l'ections for the work it1 the vicinity of Fripps Sound a staff was estubllsherl at the infot, conneeterl with the stations at Peters Point and Fort Fremont by met111s of simultaneous ohservutions, and rPatlings were taken while work was in Progress f1·0111 the Milcawe. One of the bench marks at Station Creek was recovered, and thnt, together with two lnittnl marlts, wns connected with the staff by means of levels. Three bench ma1·ks were established at Fort Fremont, three at Fripps Inlet, and five at Peters Point, all connected with each staff by meuns of carefnll~' run lines of levels. At Fort Fremont and at Peters Point levels were run both at the beginning and at the end of the season, in order to give Ii check I'm results and to guard against errors which might be noticed by the possibh~ settlement of the sta1f during the season: The charts of the area covered by the work of the Milcawe were based on surveys of many years ago, and it is considered quite possible that conslrlerahle changes might be found by the present stirveys ; and this was found to be the case, especially in regard to the hydrography. In several cases radical changes were fourtd to have taken Place in the bottom, 8 and 9 foot channels were found where the chart showed shoals bare at·low water, 18 feet of water was found: where the chart showed breakers, shonls were found which hod shifted several, hundred meters, and many other similar changes were found.'

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The difficulties were not restricted to the hydrograpby. It was found that, tl1e shore line had changed most radically in many places. Along the outer. shore of Pritchard Inlet. and Island the shore line had been cut away by 300 meters ; the northern point of Skull Inlet had built out and. ch11nged radically ; at the mouth of the South Edisto River, Pine Island had built at several hundred meters; Bay Point, Edisto. Island, .had built out into what the present chart shows as the center of the river channel; Edisto Island, at the town of Edingsville, had cut away so. that the town no longer exists; as a matter of fact, an inlet is now found at the point where the center of the town is shown .at present. , The .differences between the old charted depths and the new souudi,ugs are so considerable, and the new surveys show such changes ln the shore line, that the continuance of the work to embrace all similar areas is desirable. ,Along the coast of South Carolina· and Georgia,,the country baclc for several m'iles from the shore is generally very marshy and boggy and cut up.by innumerable creeks and sloughs, some of the creeks being a part of the· coastal inland waterways. This condition makes the .mapping .of the area in the .usual manner by means of a planetable exceedingly difficult and expensive. The best method of mapping this country without great expenditure of time and money is by means of airplane photography, by which method accurate surveys can be made at a comparatively low cost and in a small .fraction of. the time required by any other method.

The hydrography of Broad River consisted of. a system of sounding lines normal to shore lines, run approximately 200 meters apart :md crossed by a sufficient number of lines· to check the soundings; Vecy few changes were found in. the Broad River surveys, but Archers Creek was found to have shoaled considerably. On account of the strong currents in Broad Creek a drag was used for the greater part of the worl{; Practicall;v allr of the signals. used were triangulation. stations. For the .reductii:m of soundings Vides we11e observed -on a sta.ffat the west end of Archers Creelt. The reference plane for this station was established by sjmultaneous obr.ervations with a staff at Parris Isla1,1d Naval Station. · The hydrography of the shoals.off St. Helena Sound comprised the area not completed in 1920 by the steamer Bache and the launch Milcawe. It adjoins the work of the steamer Isis to the eastward and southward, the steamer Baclte to the westward, and the steamer Endeavor to· the northward. This work was done under very unfavorable weather conditions, and foi- this reason it was not possible to run any regulllr system of sounding lines, being largely over a very s~al area and with the sea breaking a greater part of the ti.J,De in 9 to 10 feet of water, sounding had to be done largely at high tide and the lines run normal or nearly so to the swell. The deµth of water on the shoals remained nbout the sarne as shown on the present chart, but the shoal ha,d rem.oved considerably to the· southward. · Tide observations for reduction of soundings were made during the cout'Se of the work at Peters Point, St. Pierre Creek; the reference plane for tMs station had been established by the launch M'ilMiwe in 1920. All sounding in this area was done from the Elsie Ill. ' · The sheet covering the area from Charleston to Price Inlet is the first of a series extending from Charleston to Winyah Bay. Work on this sheet was begun June 1 in the vicinity of Winyah Inlet. A sufficient number of slgnnls were located Jn this vici11.ity for the· sul'vey of tliis. b1let, and1 tlte l!ydrography and topogi-aphy were carried to the westward, the hydrography being done when the weather permitted and the topography when it was not possible tc:> sound . .

An isla.nd has.built up east of Dewees Island, completely filUng up the Capers. Inlet channel,· which at one time passed close inshore· along the south of Dewees Island. The bars of both Dewees Inlet and Capers Inlet have shifted considerably, but the amount of water over them remained about the same. Rattlesnake Shoal has deepened so that it 1.1ow has ·a depth of at least 10 feet on it.

Of' the sounding· in this area was done with the Elsie III. The 'worlc in the inlets and the shrnds at their entrances was done. with the motor sailer. For the reduction of soundings a tide staff was established at Dewees Inlet. Triangulation data .for the area along the coast' between Charleston and ·cape Romain are meager. The greater part of the data furnished the party were based on the trhmgulation e:icecutedi ih 1857. The greater part· of the stations have been lost.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEQDETIC SURVEY.
ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, .AND LOUISIANA.

[.T. H. PETERS, Commanding Steamer Ranger.]

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Trlangulation; Three observing tripods built height, 45 feet each; 3 observing scaffolds built, height, 36 feet each. Hydrography : S59 square miles of area covered ; 2, 758.3 mlles run while sounding; 3,993 positions determined (double anl!;les) ; 2,182 soundings made; 1 tidal station established; 12 tall hydrographic signals bu1ltJ each 100 feet in height; 14 current stations occupied; 2 hydrographlc sheets finishea, scale 1 : 80,000.

On July 1, 1920, the party on the steamer Ranger was engaged in offshore hydrography in the Gulf of Mexico, continuing the work mentioned in the last annual report. Work was suspended from August 4 to 12 in order that .the vessel might undergo repairs at Pascagoula, Miss. On August 12 offshore hydrography was resumed, and signals were built in order to carry the triangulation down Chandeleur Sound. From November 14 to December 27 the vessel was at Gulfport, Miss., repairing boilers. ·On December 27 the vessel proceeded to New Orleans and was talrnn to the naval station for repairs, which were in progress at the close of December. The result of.the work. for the season of 1920 was a very close hydrographic resurvey of the Gulf coast from Mobile entrance to Chandeleur Sound. Current and tidal observations were carried along simultaneously with the hydrography. Triangulation signals and observing platforms were built at points in Chandeleur Sound to carry the scheme of triangulation along the coast for the control of the hydrography.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Trlangulatlon: 189 square miles of. area covered; 6 ·signal poles erected; 5 water signals In 14 to 21 feet Of water; 3 observing tripods built, heights, 35 and -40 feet; 2 observing scaffolds built, height, 30 feet; 9 statfons In main .scheme occupied ·ror horizontal measures; 6 stations in supI>lemental scheme occupied for horizontal measures; 16 geographic positions determined.. Leveling : 6 permanent bench marks established; 2 secondary bench marks estab!lshed ; 0$ mile of levels run. Topography : 2 miles of detailed shore line surveyed ; 1 topographic sheet partly finished, scale 1 : 6,000. Hydrography ; 128 square miles of area covered ; 1,286.6 miles run while sounding; 7,687 positions determined (double angles); 38,712 soundings made; 2 tide stations established ; 5 hydrographic sheets finished, scales 1 : 5,000, 1 : 15,000, 1 : 20,000, and 1 : 40,000.

At the beginning of July, 1920, signal building and triangulation were in progress preparatory to the hydrographic survey of the locality of the shoal about 4 miles northwestward of Marquesas Keys, Fla.,' reported by the U. S. destroyer Ellis. An area .of 2! square miles was covered by sounding lines, spaced lOQ meters or less apart. Except for a coral shoal of a small extent, this area was found to have a general uniform sloping depth of abo1,1t l'i to 7 fathoms. During the further investigation of the shoal area mentioned a coral bowlder was sighted and found to have a depth of 7.2 fee{ at mean low water. On July 12. the .inshore hydrography .started from Marquesas Keys and the inshore hydrography south of Boca Grande Channel were resumed where left uncompleted by .the party on the steamer Hydrographer at the time of the September, 1919, hurricane. For the control of the hydrography it was necessary to rebuild two tower signals about 15 feet in height and erect three water signals in 12, 16, and 18.feet of water, respectively. The inshore hydrography was executed on a scale of 1: 15,000, making it necessary to use these fixed signals located by triangulation in order to attain the desired accuracy in· locating closely spaced sounding lines. Several uncharted coral shoals were found to exist: between Cosgrove and Coalbin Rock, also several uncharted shoal soundings were obtained between Coalbin Rock and Vestal Shoal. The Hydrourapher was used for all of the hydrography. When seeing and other conditions were unfavorable, the ship was maneuvered to pass over the shoalest appearing parts of. the coral patches. and thus .endeavor .was made to obtain the shoal soundings. This will account for the number of shoals discovered which in the ordinary methods of' hydrography would probably have escaped attention. Weather conditions were generally favorable for field work in the vicinity of Marquesas Keys, but long spells of easterly trade winds accompanied by hazy atmosphere hampered the progress of the worlr at times. ·

Tides were observed at Marquesas Keys and later at Boca Grande Key, where a tidal station was established and a plane of. reference obtained by simultaneous observations with the Bay station at Key West. The fixed water signal as used by this party consists of a wooden tripod frame and center pole built ashore and towed by the ship to the shoal where erected. Three iron pipes of sufficient length are attached at the base of the tripod legs, the tops meeting and fastened at the center pole. The weight of the pipes causes the structure to rest on the bottom on two of its legs, while end· of center pole is held above the water surface. By attaching su:lficlent weights at the end of third leg, which ;Uso projects above water, the signal is readily erected by lifting the center pole. It is then firmly secured in place by allowing weights attached to wire loops around the pipe to slide to the base of the signal. The water signals were destroyed after they had served their purpose. The wire lashings between the three pipes and center pole were cut, the wooden frame was attached to a stout line from the ship and towed over the bottom until the pipes and weights let go, and the wooden frame then floated to the surface. Field work was closed in the vicinity of Marquesas Keys on September 19, thus completing the work required under instructions dated December 28, 1918. After talring aboard considerable material for signal building and making minor engine-room repairs at Key West, Flu., the Hydrogra.pher took up field work between American Shoal and Sombrero Keys, along the :F'lorida Reefs and Florida Straits. On September 14 the vessel proceeded. to Boot Key· Harbor to investigate the practicability of using this place· as a base for survey operations. It was found to afford excellent refuge in case of a hurricane. During the end of the season while operations were carried on in this locality the ship obtained fresh water, ice, and provisions every other week-end, thus avoiding the long run to Key West, except for coal. On two occasions the vessel harbored at Boot Key during hurricane weather. Little field work was accomplished during the latter half of September for . the reason that several tropical disturbances confined the party to signal-building operations in the vicinity of Boot Key Harbor. During October the signal building and triangulation between American Shpal and Sombrero Reef were accornplisheo. With the use of two water signals described in this report in 14 and 21 feet of water, respectively, it was possible to extend a coastal scheme of· triangulation from American Shoal Lighthouse to Sombrero Reef Lighthouse. One of the water signals was occupied with theodolite, and apparently good observations were obtained. 'l'his triangulation was necessary for the reason that at this part of the coast the triangulation of the Florida Keys was carried along the inland portions of the Keys. On November 3 the offshore hydrography in the Florida Straits was resumed eastward of American Shoal Lighthouse and cmTied to Sombrero Reef by the end of the season, D~cember 30. Likewise the inshore hydrography along the edge of the reefs was executed during this period. The Coast Survey sounding tubes were used with hand-sounding machine for sounding in depths from 20 to 100 fathoms, and in depths less than 20 fathoms· the hand lead was used. Tides for the reduction of soundings were observed. at American Shoal Light,. house. Strong easterly trade winds retarded the progress of the work considerably While engaged in the triangulation and offshore hydrography between American Shoal and Sombrero Reef. Also there were only two officers engaged in this work, which prevented efficient progress. . . · A revision survey of Boot Key Harbor Channel and approach was made. 'I'his place was used by the Florida East Coast Railway as a construction camp during the overseas externdon of the railway. A channel dredged by the Florida East Coast Railway hru; now a controlling depth of 7! feet, which provides an entrance to the landlocked harbor for the greater number of vessels using Hawk Channel. It 'is practically the only good harbor between Key West and Miami. A tidal station was established at Boot Key, and tidal datum was obtained by sin:iultaneous observations with the base station at Key West. The Hydrographer based her operations from Key West, Fla .· obtaining coal, Water, and supplies from the United States naval station. The Lighthouse Ser'Vice furnished docking space for the vessel while at Key West. The services thus obtained were of considerable assistance to the party. · During December the automatic tide gauge at Key West was inspected. and a llew time striking clock. was installed. The relation between staff and bench lUU_l'kR was obtnined by levels during August. ·

The Steamer Hydrographer· closed field worlc in the locality of the Flot"ida reefs and made preparations for the passage from Key West, Fla., to, Mobile, Ala., for repairs. On January 8, 1921, the vessel: left Key West and. did not arrive at Mobile until January 17, 1921, delays having been occasioned by stormy weather. After securing proposals for repairs to the lfuarou.ra!1her, the ship was delivered to the successful bidder on January 26. General rumual repairs and overhauling were accomplished, and the same were completed on ]'ebruary 18.. The Hydrourapher then proceeded to Gulfport, Miss., on February 21, arriving the same day, to take up the triangulation from Misstssippi Sound to the Mississippi Delta, required under the Director's instruction.<J dated January 19, 1921. The party was engagod on the tertiary triangulation in Chandeleur Sound and Breton Sound during the months of March, April, and May. The scheme is based on the line Biloxi Lighthouse to Ship Island Lighthouse, and. was carried to the line Sable Point to Battledore Island. In addition to the main scheme three stations were determined on the west shore of Chandeleur Sound, and four hydrographic signals were located by triangulation on the. barz:lec islands at the east side of the sounds. Four of the main-acheme triangulation signals were erected in 12 to 13 feet of water, and two of these were occupied by theodolite. The description and manner of erecting water signals for triangulation were furnished in a report entitled "Special Report on Water Signals Used for Triangulation and Hydrogra11hy." Good figures were thus made possible by the use of the water signals. and the lengths of the lines were considerably shorter than would otherwise have been the case if land stations only had beeu used on both shores of the sound. The need of short lines was necessary in order to make economic progress in observing during the months of March and April, as the seeing conditions then are generally very unsatisfactory on the Gulf coast. Even with shorter lines the continual hazy weather delayed observations along the first or northern half o.f the scheme, also on days when the atmosphere was clear a bank of mist about 4 to 10 feet in height hovered about the water surface during the day and night and eventually necessitated increasing the height of the signal in addition to that required to overcome curvature, to have signals show above the mist bank. Rapid progress was made on the second or southern half of the triangulation scheme, the signals were built high enough to overcome the difficulty experienced before, and also there were several days of clear seeing about the time observations were in progress. Delays were also occasioned by frequent strong winds throughout the greater part of the season. Two of the signals had to be rebuilt on account of the shifting nature of some of the islands; they were subsequently erected in unchangeable shoal water. Considerable erosion of the shore line was noted in Chandeleur Sound, as examples: Errol Island has disappeared except tbat small parts of it are awash, Barrel Key on the west shore of Chandeleur Sound has washed away entirely; also the islands off.Door Point no longel' exist; The completion of the triangulation to, the mouths of the Mississippi Delta was postponed pending the completion of the bydrographic investigation of the waters off Southwest Pass for the needs of the United States Army Engineers. The latter work was begun on June 7· and was in progress. at the close of the ·fiscal year. Signals for hydrography were determined by· triangulation, survey buoys were constructed and planted in place for. fixed positiom. work to the 50-fathom curve. Tbe lnshore hydrography: from the S.fathom to the 20fathom curve was completed from latitude 29° 00.' on the west side ci.f the Southwest Pass to longitude 89° 19' on. the east s!de .of the pass. The chartered launch Oa.rl F', obtainecf April 23. assisted in the work outlined above. The lease was terminated on June 30, 1921.

.su~DIARY

. Under instructions issued May 12, 1920, field worlr on the survey of Los Angeles Harbo:r and San Pedro Bay was commenced on Ju1y 10. The Natoma arrived at San Pedro from San Francisco on July 15, nnd preparations were made for beginning field work. The 24-foot motor sailing launch which had been shipped to San Pedro was obtained and prepared for bydrography. A topographic sheet on. the scale l: ·10,000 was made to cover the area of San Pedro, Wilmington, and Terminal Island. Boat sheets were prepared, one on the scale of 1: 10,000 for the harbor survey and another 011 the sarne scale for the area eastward of the harbor extending to Long Beach, and the old sound· ings from bromide of. hydrographic sheet No. 1418 were transferred to the latter sheet. On July 19 the work on the erection of an automatic title gauge 'in the outer harbor was commenced, and th!s was finished on the 21st. This gauge was maintained until November 30; five bench marks were esta'bl:shed and connected by levels with the gauge. Prominent artificial objects in the vicinity of Snn Pedro and Long Beach were cut in from the recovered stations on July 21, 22, and 23, and field work on the topographic sheet of San Pedro was begun on· July 22 and continued Without interruption thereafter. On July 80 signal building for ,the .hydrography of San Pedro Bay eastward of Long Beach was begun.; 5 stations were established; tall hydrographic signals of the tripod desfgn, using .whitewashed boards and cloth, were erected over these stations, and symmetrical diamond targets Placed on the center .Poles ·and carefully centered were used for locating them by triangulation. Station Reservoir 2 is on the same hill as original station Iteservoir, no description of which is .available. The pl'imary statiO\l Los Bolsas Which was on the Sllillle site is apparently destr·oyed by the construction of the l'eservolr. No attempt wa11 made to recover any of the old tertiary stations. On A\lgust 7 a boat sheet on .a scale of 1:: 20,000 Was made for the hydrography east of Long .Beach and outside of the br~akwater for work out to the 20fathom ·curve. Soundings. from the old l:lydxographic .sheet 1418 were trans'ferred ,as the lnstructions called for .splitting old sounding Jines. and for com;D.arison with old work. Ou August 12-14 two ofiicers were at work on the 1opographic sheet of San Pedro. Launch hydrography of the inner and outer arbors was begun August 16 and continued \lntil August 30. On August 17 a topographic projection for Long Beach was made, and .observations for lc.:atiug

the new triangulation stations were begun August 16. The new stations, together with prominent artificial objects between Long Beach and Huntington Beach, were cut in from stations Breakwater, Deadman's Island, and Los Cerritos. While launch hydrography and topography in the vicinity of San Pedro were in progress· the trolley sounding apparatus and electrfc-driven hauling reel were constructed by the ship's force for work on the 1: 20,000 sheet outside of the 12-fathom curve. A platform for the leadsman was built for use with the trolley and placed aft of the port side. The greater part of the launch bydrography in the outer harbor was completed by the end of August, and work was begun with the ship on the 1: 10,000 sheet and the 1: 20,000 sheet. Clear weather was utilized for this work on the offshore side of the 1: 20,000 sheet as signals were distinct, and in hazy weather the worl{ on the 1: 10,000 sheet was done. A staff gauge was established at Long Beach on September 28 for reduction of soundings on the eastern end of sheet. Topography was begun early in September on the Long Beach sheet, the San Pedro sheet having been completed, and by tl1e end of the month the Long Beach sheet also was completed. During September and October ship hydrography was prosecuted. Work was prevented by foggy weather on eight days in September and four days in October, and on account of lack of men on three days in September and three days in October. The work on the two hydrographic sheets was completed by the end of October, and office work on reduction of soundings and inking topographic sheets, tabulating tide roll, and plotting soundings on the boat sheets was continued until September 8. From December 8 to 15 field work found necessary to complete sheets was done, and two signals at Long Beach and Reservoir 2 were moved at the request of the property owners. Current observations were made near Weldt Rock, from the vessel at anchor, on November 15, 1.6, and 17. No appreciable current was observed at this station. It was found impracticable to obtain current observations at the other two stations indicated in the instructions as anchorage in the channels is prohibited. The currents in the channel appear to flood and ebb, with rise and fall of tide and never to exceed 1 knot. Field work at San Pedro was completed on December 14, and on December .16 the vessel sailed for San Francisco in accordance with orders dated November 16, 1920, arriving on December 17. Field work on the continuation of revislon of hydrography and topography of San Francisco Bay was commenced on completion of the office work on records of the San Pedro worl{ on January 11. The work of the past season included also a resurvey of the bar, wire-drag investigations of shoal soundings off Fort Point and east of Angel Island, and the location of the four radio-compass stations in the vicinity of San Francisco, namely, Bird Island, Montara Point, Farralon Islands, and Point Reyes. The work is. described in descriptive reports and the season's report for the period January 11-May 26, 1921. In accordance with instructions dated April 28, field worlc was brought to a close on May 26 on completion of assigned work in and around San Francisco Bay, ancl the vessel was moored in China Basin for overhauling.
[FREMON'.!.' MORSE.]

The work of the San Francisco field station has been continued along the usual lines. Besides the routine worlr of the station the sales agencies of the Coast a:nd Geodetic Survey in San Francisco were inspected, and the charts and publications on hand were listed. Recommendations were made as to details of resurveys by the steamer Natoma in the vicinity of San Francisco Bay. Progress was made on a graphic index of tracings on file with the field station. . Information was obtained from the office of the engineer in charge of tiie Oakland Harbor improvements concerning the depth of water in the Albers and the Southern Pacific Basin. A copy of the latest map of the San Francisco water front was obtained from the chief engineer of the State harbor commission. This map shows changes that have.occurred since its publication. It was checked up in the field by the inspector personally and some further changes indicated. The positions of wharves near Fort Point were obtained from the constructing quartermaster, U.S. Army.

SUMMARY oF RESULTS.-·Leveling: 3 permanent bench marks established; l mlle of levels run. Topography : 17 miles of traverse run to Joca te signals ; scale of topographic sheets 1 : 20 000. Hydrography : 991.l square miles of area covered; 1,179.4 miles run While sounding; 2,989. positions-determined (double angles); 6,778 soundings made; 2 tide stations established! 3 current stations occupied; scale of· hydrographlc sheets 1 : 20,000, 1 : 40,000, and 1 : 120,000.

In compliance with instructions dated March 23, 1921, the Lydonia left Seattle for the locality of 'vork April 2 and arrived off the Humboldt Bar during the night of April 4. The bar was rough and the ship ran to Shelter Cove, where field work was begun the next day by the erection of a tide staff. Two days later an automatic 'gauge was placed in operation at North Jetty at Humboldt Bay and the hydrography was begun. The .work was in progress at the end of the fiscal yeai;. Additional split lines wete run between the 40 and 100 fathom curve over the urea from Chris Rocks to Shelter Cove. This gives a spacing of one-halfmile lines . .Additional lines were run to Tolo Bank wherever the original surveys showed Widely spaced soundings .or where tllere were indications of shoaler spots. Similar development work was resumed in the vicinity of Punta Gorda and had extended to Cape Mendocino by the end of June. Offshore lines were run to the 1,000-fathom curve which extends well off the coast at Punta Gorda. Much of this work was done on dead reckoning, as the Weather was generally foggy and no fixes and but few sights could be obtained. By June 30 the inshore and offshore work was completed to Cape Mendocino.

· The survey of the Umpqua River, Oreg., and .bar. lying off the entrance, was begun May 23, 1920. Progress to June 30 is detailed in the. last'.annual report Uf the Director. · The original instructions called for a close development of the bar and the river's mouth and an inspection of tlie river as far up as the railroad bridge to see if a resurvey of tpat portion was necessary. The examination showed that a resurvey as far as the railroad bridge was advisable, and the office was so notified, and the party was instructed to continue work as far up the river as to include the water front of Reedsport. Two hired launches were used in the execution of this work . . When the survey was begun, it was expected that two triangulation stations easy of access and near the mouth of the river could be recoyered. This, however, was not the case, as none of the old stations could be found, and it was necessary to start the scheme from the line Burn to Brushy Hill 2. Station Burn was on a brush-covered hill whlch necessitated the building of a 15-foot :Scaffold and three days' clearing to open up lines of sight .. Three of. the U. S. Army Engineers stations established In 1916 were recovered and incorporated ln the Coast and Geodetic Survey work. These were North Base, Winchester, and Cornwall. When it became necessary to carry the triangulation up the 3;1ver, some of these stl1tions on the sand hills had been undermined and bfown .uown, and the stations· could not be recovered. It was necessary to establish ·.a.new station and to reoccupy two of the other stations. · A fairly strong sche1r.e of tertiary triangnlatlon extended up to the bridge. The stations were marked as permanently as possible. In many cases it Was impossible to put in reference marks. chThe topography consisted in running in the shore line where there was ahy ange from the original survey, consequently the o.uter beach was run for about a mile on either side of the river.

Bay. From there ·to the Big ,Point the shore line was bold and rocky and had therefore not changed. The shore line of all the small islands or flats was determined. .The shore line of all t.he small islands or 'flats was run. Bone Island was located, and the water front at Reedsport. No contours were run except on the sand hills in tii.e vicinity of the Coast Guard station, Army Hill, and the large sand hill off the middle grounds. Two sheets on the scale of 1: 10,000 were used. One plane-table sheet on the scale of l: 20,000 was used ·to locate .signals for the preliminary survey to c·heck the existing chart and determl:ne if a complete survey was needed. Where the shore line was not run it was carefully checked with the old stirvey. Sounding on the bar was in progress on July 1, and from that time until July 16 a constant watch was kept on the sea and weather, and whenever possible a few hours' sounding on the bar were put in. The Coast Guard station .lookout kept the party informed regarding the sea.,The first three weeks of July brought favorable weather. The only chance for a smooth sea was when a decided change took place in the direction of the wind, but during this time the fog was. apt to be worse. Consequently the party always remained in constant readiness to go out onto the bar whenever the conditions were favorable. One hour before high tide on July 16 the sea became smooth and the fog lifted. The party was on hand with the launch, and they immediately began sounding out the bar. The sea was smooth for about 21' hours, just long enough 'for the party.to cover the north spit. The channel through the bar was ·sounded over more thoroughly than usual 'because as it had but· recently ·been ·washed out about 10 feet it was feared that the sand might have "'.ashed away, leaving a pinnacle rock with but very little indication of its existence. A very decided change from the old chart was discovered in the depth of the channel through the bar and in the mouth of the river. The soundings in the critical places were reduced, the tide reducers being obtained from the predicted tides, and the soundings were recorded on the boat sheet for a careful study. 'Two boat sheets on the scale of 1: 10,000 were used to cover· the entire ·area from the whistling buoy. off the .bar to the eastern end of the water front of .Reedsport. A few lines of preliminary soundings were taken on a 1 : 20,000 scale ·sheet to .check the accuracy of the chart. The last sounding was taken on August 30. On arri.val at Gardiner an automatic tide gauge was established at the jetty, and a record was obtained beginning May 24 and endi,ng August 30. A tide staff was erected at the Gardiner Mill Co.'s wharf and a series of one-half hourly readings were made beginning August 6 at 10 a. m. and continued until 7 p. m. the next day. This gave 38 hours of simultaneous readings with the automatic gauge. Thereafter the bydrograp'hic party took a reading on the staff before 'going to work ·and upon returning. Otherwise no tidal observations were made on this staff while the party was sounding. , , Permanent bench marks were established and connected with the tide staffs at the jetty and at Gardiner. On July 16 the launch was made fast to the black can. buoy at the inner entrance of the channel through the bar, and cun·ent observations were begun. The pole and log line method with a stop watch was used, and observations were continued for 25 hours. A maximum velocity of 3.5 lmots was obtained. · A survey was m'ade on the beach on either side of the river and at the mouth of the river for indications of rock. None were found other than the rocks near the boathouse on the south side, Ork Reef, and at Winchester Point. All specimens of l;>ottom ol.Jtalned were sand. The bottom of the whole river ·as far as surveyed was sand or mud. ,On September 2 the work in the Umpqua River was completed and the patty disbanded except for one man. On September 7 the t~o ofllcers and this one man went to Coos Bay and there marked the true meridian passing through the naval radio compass station. A separate report was made on this work un<ler date ,of September 18.

The principal duties which are required of the inspector at this station are: The maintenance of a stock of charts and nautical publications for reference, distribution to the Government officers, and sale, and also the inspection o:r the principal chart agencies Jn the district; supplying light vessels, which incidentally to their regular work are engaged in making current observations for the Survey, with materials and applinnces required in that work; charge of the property .belonging to the Coast and Geodetic Survey stored at Seattle; receiving and forwarding mail and instruments to vessels and field parties of the Survey engaged in field work in Alaska or having their home station at Seattle; keeping on hand supplies of stationery in order to meet requisitions from land and hydrographlc parties; supplying requisitions for information from ·the general public pertaining to the tides, geographic positions, magnetic declination, elevations, depths, changes in aids to navigation, and other information affecr. ing the maritime interests;· supplying the office at Washington with the mo;:;t recent information affecting the charts and tide tables; supervising the operation of tide stations at Seattle and Olympia, Wash., and at Ketchikan, Alaska. Advance notices to mariners are published immediately upon receipt of important information affecting the charts. On January 15, 1921, the charge of the field station at Seattle was transferred to another officer of the Survey. On January 15, 1921, the administrative responsibility and activities of the field station were increased by having assigned to it the general supervision over the hydrographic and topographic parties working within the di.strict, or based at Seattle, except as limited by the regulations, to the end that the greatest possible assistance may be given to such parties, keeping in touch with the parties worldng in ,Alaska and advising the Washington office regarding such changes in the working operations as it is believed should be made from time to time.
GEOJ:!ETIC WORK.
NORTH CAROLINA.

[R. J. AULD.]

Eetween April 26 and May 4, 1921, a base line, approximately 1 kilometer in length, was measured along the Carolina Beach Railway for the purpose of strengthening the triangulation along the Cupe Fear River. The base is located near the point where the coast triangulation from the .north connects with the Cape Fear River triangulation.
[GEORGE D. Cowrm.]

Between June 6 and June· 14, 1921, the length Sand 2 to Redmond, a line of the Cape Fear River triangulation just south of Wilmington, was measured ns a base for the purpose of strengthening that triangulation. Several stations in Wilmington were recovered, with a view to checking the connection at Wilmington between the Cape l!"'ear River triangulation and the precise-traverse line from Wilmington to Sanford.
MISSISSIPPI.

(J, S, BILBY.]

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Preclse traverse: 100 miles of traverse run; 120 main stations occupied for horizontal measures; 23 supplemental stations occupied for horizontal measures. Azimuth : 10 stations occupied for determination of azimuth.

Work was begun on a precise traverse in the State of Mississippi in the vicinity of Pascagoula in January, 1921. A base line was measured on the Louisville & Nashville Railway track to the westward of Pascagoula. The base stations were connected· by triangulation with two old triangulation stations on Mississippi Sound. The traverse started from East Base and was extended eashvard to Pascagoula, thence northward on the Pascagoula-Moss Po'.nt concrete highway about 2! .miles to the Alabama & Mississippi Railway track, t~e.nce northward on this railway to Evanston, thence on the Gulf, Mobile & .1,-.ortbern Railway by way of.Beaumont and Richton to Ovett. Field work. was Closed on March 10. The means of transportation for the field party consisted of two i ton trucks, one !-ton truck, and three hand-driven velocipede cars. The hand velocipede

cars were used in connection with the motor trucks to transport men and material to intermediate points between road crossings which it was not practicable to reach with the motor trucl{, They were hauled from place to place on the motor truck and were available at all times when needed. The observing. party used one of these veloc:pede cars instead of the motor true!{ for moves between stations. It was found that the move from station to station could be made with the velocipede car in less time than was required by motor truck. Velocipede cars were also used in connection with the motor truck by the party building stands, marking stations, and doing reconnoissance and by the party staking curves, running wye levels, and observing. Had motor trucks only been used it would have required four trucks, and at many places it would have been necessary for the men to pack the material and instruments to points that could not be reached with the truck; therefore, the velocipede cars reduced the time, labor, and expense of the work. The railway over wh'.ch the traverse was measured and the nature of the country were unfavorable to rapid progress.
LOUISIANA.

[E. B. LATHAM.]

On September 10, 1920, the inspector of the field station at New Orleans left for Mansura, La., to verify certain angles in a traverse line in that vicinity. A party was organized and field work begun on Septerhber 11, signals were erected on the 11th and 13th, and observations at Station Omar were completed on the latter date. The inspector returned to New Orleans on the 14tll and resumed his duties at the New Orleans field station.
CALIFORNIA AND OllEGON.

[E. W. ErcrrnLBERG.] SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Base line: 1 precise, 14.26 kilometers in length. Precise and primary triangulation: 32,250 Rquare miles of area covered (17,250 square miles Precise, 15,000 square miles primary) ; length of scheme, 500 mill's; 43 observin!! tripods and scaffolds built; 31 stations in main scheme occupied for ho1·1zontal measures; 4 stations in supplemental scheme occupied for horizontal measures; 37 stations occupied for vertical measures; 69 geographic positions determined; 69 elevations determined trigonometrically. Leveling: 18.1 miles of leveling run. Azimuth : 7 stations occupied for observations of azimuth.

'.rhis arc of precise triangulation extends in a northeasterly direction from northern California to eastern Oregon. It starts from the line Bolivar-Bally of the California-Washington arc of precise triangulation and ends on the line Dry-Squaw of the Utah-Washington nrc of precise triangulation. (See Special Publications Nos. 13 and 74.) Tile California end of the arc is in high mountains, while much of the remainde11 of the arc is across a high, urid plateau broken by ridges and peaks und very sparsely inhabited. As an indication of the height of the stntions it is noted that the party was still resortin~ to melted sno"' for a water supply on .July 4, while occupying Mount Grizzly. F'ield work began in northern California on June 12, 1920, and was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year. There were two observers on the work, namely, the cllief of party and E. 0. Heaton, junior llydrographic and geodetic engineer. During the first part of the season the latter occupied the J?!imary stations, while the former occupied the precise stations. Lnter both olisen·ers shared in the precise work. Due to inability to obtain men, the party started wor!{ with only three ligllt l{eepers, the remainder of the stations being tended by truck drivers and employees of the U. S. Forest Service. This cooperation by the Forest Service aided very materially. The work was considerably hindered by dust storms, by smoke from numerous and extensive forest fires, by an unusual amount of rain, and by inability to obtain careful, reliable, and resourceful light keepers and ·hands. Six automobile trucks were used for transportation, one of these being used exclusively in tile marking of stations and in the building of stands. On·. the first four stations the length of pack averaged over 10 miles. Animals were used for packing to these stations, hut on the remainder of the arc hack packing was resorted to on account of the saving in time. The moves between stations averaged about 100 miles and usually required a whole day, as the roads were rough and the trucks could average only about 1<! miles an hol}r.

About August 15, 1920, work was started at the northern end of a line of precise traverse, requested by the U. S. Geological Survey, extending north and south through the central part of Illinois. It was anticipated at first thnt a connection could be made at the north end with precise trian1,'lllation dm·P by the State of Wisconsin. The old stations could not be recovered, however, und it was necessary to measure a traverse line eastward through the southern part of Wisconsin to connect with the precise triangulation of the Lnke Survey along the west shore of ·Lake Michigan. The southern end of the Illinois traverse connected with the thirty-ninth parallel precise triangulation. The northern end of the Illinois traverse was quite difficult, due to numerous curves. After 85 miles had heen completed the taping party was put in charge of C. L. Garner for tho remulnder of the work. Motor trucks were used for transportntion. The work wus completed the latter part of October.

SuMMAitY OF rtl'lSULTs.-Precise traverse: 220 miles of traverse measurements com· Pleted; 75 stations in supplemental scheme occupied for horizontal measures.

Mr. Garner took charge of the precise-traverse pnrty operating in Illinois on September 13, 1920, when the work had been carried to a point just north of La Salle. From here the line of traverse extends south along the Illinois Central Railroad to the vicinity of Vandalia, where it connects up with the arc of precise triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel. The reconnoissance, Sigi1al building, and principal angle measures on this section were made by anQther party. ,_ ~'he railroad track along this section of traverse Is very favorable for this "ind of work and good progress was made in spite of a shortage of hands. After the completion of -this line the party proceeded to Beloit, Wis., and llleasurecl a line of traverse from there to Racine, Wis. This was for the purfose of connecting the northern end of the Illinois traverse with the precise l'langulation of the Great Lakes. The chief of party had previously made a

reconnoissance and ascertained that a traverse line would be muC'h more economical than triangulation for this. connection. On both of the projects above automobile trucks were used exclusively fo1· transporting the party. This proved a very satisfactory arrangement as the railroads were paralleled by highways, which in many cases were af1.iacent to the track, and there were very few stations where the trucks could not bedriven within a short distance. On the 'Wisconsin line the grade corrections were obtained by the use of a track level, thus obviating the ·necessity for precise levels. 'l'he .accuracy of this method was tested and found to be satisfactory. The work of the season was closed on November 20, 1920.

About June 1, 1921, work was started at Green Bay, \Vis., on the line of precise traverse which will extend to the wel'>tern end of Lake Superior. Enough precise triangulation was done at Green Bay to connect the traverse with the· old precise triangulation of the U. S. Lake Survey. This worl{ is being done at the request of the U. S. Geological Survey to furnish precise control for mapping operations in northeastern Wisconsin. 'l'he plan followed was to have the entire party work as close together as possible, usually from the same base. The building party was kept just far enough ahead not to delay the other opPrations. In this way the office work and correspondence were much reduced, and the computations were more easily macle· since all the records were available at any time. Automobile trucks were used for transportation.

This work was done at the request of the U. S. Geological Survey. · . About 20 miles were truversecl over improved roads in the neighborhood of ·Indianapolis. The remainder of the line was along railroads as usual. No especial difficulties were encountered on the work except in getting through the large cities where the numerous curves, railroad yards, and traffic over the streets made the work slow nnd hard.

On Sept<)mber 4 the party engaged In precise triang'ulation at Williams, Ariz., was transferred to Mr. Schoppe. The party and outfit were then taken in five automobile trucks to Allen, Okla. There triangulation was begun where the >vork had been left in W19 and extended westward to a connection with the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. The old towers were found in bad condition, as only such repairs had been made to them as were possible without rebuilding. They were too insecure to use for observing in any but the most favorable weather. Poor closures were obtained at station 'l'urkey, when an attempt was mude to use the 60-foot tripod in. a wind. The observations were repeated later under better conditions with satisfactory results. The work was started on October 5, 1920. One Laplace azimuth was observed at station Allen, and one primary azimuth at station Rosedale. Vertical angles were measured at all stations. Considerable delay was caused by the lack of bridges on the South Canadian River and also bY muddy roads; The local soil formation fs such as to make travel by truck pract!cally impossible. in wet weather. 'I'rial was made under all conditions, and it was found that excessive breakage of various truck parts resulted from trying to get through the mud. On November 9 all four trucks were laid up for repairs due to this cause. Connection with the. ninety-eighth meridian precise triangulation was made at: stations Purcell, Table B.'.11, and Arbuckle Mountain, and the. horizontal measures of the season were completed on November 30, 1920. " ,. On December 1 the party was assembled and started for Savanna, Olda., where a base line was measured. 'Ihe base extended along a ta11gent of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway for a distance of 6,500 meters, and over ffakes for the remaining l,000 meters at the southern end.

In September, 1920, a party was organized for the purpose of building and repairing triangulation signals on the western end of the arc of precise triangulalatlon, which will extend from El Reno, Okla., to Needles, Calif. The signals had been built several years, as the observations were delayed on account of the war. Although the necessary repairs were rather extensive, only three new signals had to be built. The chief of party was ass:sted by a truck ·driver mul one hand. The party was d:sbanded early in November.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAS'.r AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The work done during the period up to June 30, 1920, is given in the previous annual report. The observations were made by two observers, the chief of the party and R. L. Schoppe, hydrographic and geodetic engineer, working on opposit.e sides of the scheme. Much difficulty was experienced in obtaining suitable labor for the work in the field, as triangulation in a mountainous country requires much exposure and isolation as well as very hard physical labor, and is not attractive to the men. Heavy rainfall was experienced from June until August. For a period of nearly six weeks it was practically impossible to observe on heliotropes for vertical angles, and often due to storms observations at night were impossible. As a general thing, however, the weather was much clearer at night tha,ni during the day, and the vertical observations were finished then by pointing: on the lights. With one exception the equipment was practically the smne as that used by various parties engaged in similar work during recent years. The exception was the exclusive use of electric lamps. Transportation was largely by truck. The camp equipment necessarily was. reduced t.o a minimum in order to avoid overloading the trucks, and even then the trucks. were frequently overloade(l on account of the extra supplies and material for emergency repairs, which had to be carried in such isolated places. There were 67 lines in the main scheme, and the average length of line is 56.8 statute miles. The average width of the scheme is 66 miles, and the length is 408 miles. The longest line is 152.8 statute miles, and the second' longest line is 146 miles. These, it is believed, are tlie longest lines over which complete observations for the figures involved have ever been made. Fortunately, these did not cause any delays in the observations except ·at station Ords. At the two other stations involved, the long lines we1·e finished the first night. Most of the long lines hinged on the. station Frisco, and that station .was fin-· ished during the first night of observations. 'l'he success of the observatidns. over these long lines is largely due to the efficiency of the electric signnl lamps. Connections with precise levels were made at Holbrook· and Williams, Ariz .· and at Los L;.mas. ::. Mc:~. Two observers were used on this work, and no other arrangement woukl have been successful on this part of this particular arc of triangulation. On a stretch of over 200 miles on the south side of the scheme there is no railroad and not a single road over which trucks could be driven from one side of the scheme to the other. If the work had been undertnken by only one observer, some of the moves from station to station would have required drives of 40<> miles or more. The chief of party visited the office of the Forest Service at Albuquerque during the early part of the season. The officials there wer(~ very anxious t°' secure points of control in their various forest reserves.

SUMMARY OF RlilSULTS.-Preclse leveling: 492 miles of levels run, 196 permallent bench marks established.

Beginning .Tuly 1, 1920, the line of levels running eastward across the State of Oregon from Klamath Falls to Ontario, with a spur line from Gap Ranch to Bend, was continued from a point 55 miles east of Klamath Falls and completed on November 15, 1920, at Bend, Oreg. From Klamath Falls to Crane the route was along highways and passed through Olene, Dairy, Yalnax, Beatty, Bly, Lakeview, Valley Falls, Alkali Lake, Butte, Egli, Gap Ranch, Riley, Burns, La wen,· and Saddle Butte. From . Crane to Ontario the route was along the Oregon Short Line Railroad, a distance of 125 miles. The route from Gap Ranch to Bend was along the highways ·and passed through Hampton and Millican. A double observing party was used, the subparty being in charge of F. W. · Hough. Transportation was by means of three automobile trucl;:s, except on the railroad between Crane and Ontario, where motor-velocipede cars were used. This 'leveling follows very closely the triangulation across the State. At several places bench marks were so placed that the triangulation party which followed could easil.v connect them with the triangulation scheme in order to control the trigonometric leveling.

SUMMAltY OF !llilSULTS.-Precise leveling: 494.2 mlles of_ levels run, 297 permanent bench marks established. ,

On July 1, 1920, work was in progress on a line of precise levels from Weed, Calif., to Auburn, 'Wash., the line having reached Portland, Oreg. The main line of the levels followed the Southern· Pacific Railroad from Weed, Calif., to Portland, Oreg., and the Northern Pncific Railroad from Portland, Oreg., to Auburn, Wash., with the exception of 9 miles of single-track branch line between St. Clair and Olympia, Wash., and 7! miles of single track owned by the Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Co. between Olympia and Chambers Prairie, Wash. Spur lines of levels \Vere run from Portland to Fort Stevens, Oreg., and from Centralia to Westport, Wash. · From Portland to Fort Stevens, Oreg., the line followed the route of the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railroad. At Fort Stevens three U. S. Engineer bench marks, and at Astoria, Oreg., one U. S. Engineer bench mark were recovered. From Centralia to Westport, Wash., the line followed the route of the Gate and Grays Harbor branch of the Northern Pacific Hailroad to Bay Oity, Wash,; thence overland to Westport, a distance of about 8 miles. At Westport two .tidal bench marks were recovered. Six tidal bench marks were connected with at Olympia, four at Steilacoom, and one at Tacoma, Wash. Two other tidal bench marlts nt Tncoma were found to be inaccessible on account of construction work, and two others were over 100 feet above the traclt and hence required a great denl of time to tie in. No tidal bench marks at Dupont, ·wash., were recovered, although a thorough senrch for them was made. At. Auburn, Wash., tlle end of the line, connection was made with two benc!t · lllarks of the Seattle, Wash., to Pocatello, Idaho, precise le,'.el line.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Motor-velocipede cars were used throughout the season. On several section.:; of the work where the traffic was unusually heavy, and also where the route followed the Columbia River, the use of the cars was extremely hazardous. When using motor cars on leveling work it has been the practice heretofore to mount the tripod of the instrument on a car of the side-drive pattern. This method of mounting has not prove<.l entirely satisfactory as the side-drive car has given more or less trouble ·in not keeping to the rails, thus subjecting the instrument to severe shocks. The instrument mounted in this. manner was <.lirectly over the center of the track, and the line of sight passed close to the recorder who was seated in the second c11r. The possible effect on the line of sight of the proximity of the recorder and the second cai· was balanced by shifting the relative positions of the cars. For some time a center-drive type of cur has been in use, . and its greater· serviceability prompted the observer to design a mounting for the instrument on this type of car and to give it a trial on 275 kilometers of the line. In mounting the instrument on a center-drive car, an ordinary tripod was used with the legs cut to· the pr.Gper length. Two of the legs were bolted to the car, one at each end near the side. The thkd leg of the tripod was swung underneath the head and fastened to the side stringer of the frame of the car. The tripod head was steadied by an extra brace to the platform in the center of the car, and the entire mounting wns inclined in such 11 way that the observer could stand in line with the end of the railroad ties while looking through the instrument. ·While using this form of mounting, the rerunning of the party was not i·educed appreciably, but the residuals of the sections (B-F) showed no systematic tendency to increase. ·

SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Preclse leveling: 45.3 miles of levels run, 17 bench marks

This line of precise levels started from standard bench marks along the Great Northern Railway at H1nsdale, Mont., and followed the roads northward to monument No. 486 on the United States and Canada boundary, near the one hundred and seventh meridian. The field work was begun on May 19, 1921,. and ended on June 18, 1921. The Geodetic Survey of Canada is extending a line of precise levels southward to the boundary at monument No. 486. 'These two lines form a part of the scheme to connect the preeise level nets of the United States and of Canarta at various places along the boundary.

Tests were made of the flexure of a portable aluminum stand resting on a , .. concrete floor, when the stand is used for gravity observations. , The stand is the one used by the Survey for the zenith telescope for latitude observations. It consists essentially of a triangular-shaped head and three legs with extensions made mostly of aluminum for lightness. It is held ·together by means of. cross diagonals which are drawn up by means of turnbuckles. , The usual method of observing flexure was followed: The results showed a flexure correction of 27 in the seventh place of the period. of, the pendulum. This is rather large as compared with the average value of 12, obtained when the case is mounted on the brick pier of the pendulum room of the, Coast and Geodetic Surv:ey building, but probably not too large t-0 permit of the stand being used, ' ,

ern Alaska. It .was planned to keep as mariy parties in the field as the com~ plement and surveying equipment 011. board would.allow, and before reaching tbe' working grou'nds to put out four observing parties in Shelikof Straits, to complete the la11ge figure. in the triangulation which had been begun during the previous season. Owing. to the severity of the weather and the quantity of snow it was impracticable to e.stablish these parties upon arrival on tne working ground, and the whole. party was taken to King Cove, where .the work ·of putting the steamer Yulcon in condition was taken up. The attached parties were established in. Shelikof. Straits upon the first trip of the vessel for a sup.' ply of oil on May 12 and 13. . · The principal and most. important part of .the work required was the connection of the triangulation in the vicinity of Shelilrnf Straits with that in the vicinity of Mitrofonia. As the extepsion of the western part of this worl· necessitated reconnoissance, the work could be carried on quite as readily and more economically by leaving the portion from Cape Ikti to Castle Bay to a party on the launch YuTwn, and utilizfog· the remaining officers and instruments in extending the work from Shelikof Straits to the westward, where m.ounQ!in pealts had already been. determined and the ship could' be used in hydrographic w9rk whlle triangulation was in progress. Having determined a. line on Cape .Unalishagvek for extending the triangulation to the westward, it had been planned to concentrate the ;latter force of the party on. work. in· the vicinity of Chignik Bay. However, the unforeseen shortage of oil necessitated the cutting out of as much running. as possible, and this fact in. con.nection wi.th the receipt of telegr.apbic instructions to forecast and gather information in regard to Kialagvik Bay (Wide Bay) made it desirable to concentrate all the efforts of the party on the extension of the triangulation from Shelikof Straits to the westward. During the season the existence of a rock was reported in the vicinity of Lighthouse Rocks; one trip was made to the location reported, but no evidence of the danger was found. During the whole season every opportunity was taken to make observations. · The triangulation was divided into two parts, that extending from tlie ·work of. the: previous year i)l the vicinity of Cape Ikti to the eastward 1:md the other from the line Kekuruoi-Ridge in Shelikof Straits to tb,e westward. Commencing with the line Village to Copper. determined. during the previous year, triangulation was extended by a quadrilateral to the line Goat-Slope, then by the triangles Goat-Slope-Ship and Goat-Village-Ship to Ship-Goat from Ship-Goat to FoolKits by the four-sided central pqint (Pudding) figure with both diagonals observed. From the line I!'ool-Kits it had· been planned to determine the line Kumliun-Atkulik by a four-sided, central pointed figure with Nak as the central point and the diagonal Kits-Kumliun observed. Although several attempts WeJ:e made. to .observe-the .line Kits"Kumliu1;1 it was found impossible to get a determination of th.e llne from ei.ther station owJng to the clouds which covered Kumliun when .Kits was occupied.. A double determination of the line KumUun·.i\tkulik can be <Ietermfne<I l?Y the obs()i:ving dope; but the flgurl)s are not strong enough to use th.:s determi.nation, in carrying the work to tlle .eastwar<l. To extend this work to the eastward from the line Kumliun to A.tkuUk it was planned to establish and detehnirie statfons on th.e highest point oii Sutwik rsland with a central point on the nttle island south. of Cape Kumliun. if the strength of figures necessitated the establishment Of ·such a point. From tho line Atkulik to Sutwik, points on the Semidi Islands can be determined. The work in Shelikof Straits was extended from the line Kelrnrnoi-Ridge, determined in 1919, to the line Kekurnoi-Top by a simple quadrilateral. l!'ro.m

SUMMARY

· In March, 1920, the steamer JV enonah ,vas .directed to proceed to southeast~rn ·Alaska and take up the hyclrographk and fopographic survey of Clarence ·Strait from a junction with previously completecl work: in the vicinity of Point Nunez and West Devil Roclfto a jtinctfon with Vallanar and Grindell ·Island. Assigned to the steamer Wenonah for this w«;>rk ..were steam launches Deita and No. 11'1 and motor launch No; 38. .The .ship~s boat equipment consisted of one whaleboat, two dories, two dinghies, and one motor dory. A.wire-drag outfit was obtained from the .warehouse.in Seattle, .which was part.of the old outfit left by the party on· tlle stemner.E:cplorer, and proved illtogetller \msuituble for the work. No $pare parts on extra equipment were furnished. · On June, 30 tll.e party sailed for Nichols Bay. On June.2 the ship with launch No. 38 in tpw, started for Alaska. On Sunday, June 6, the vessel anchored off Ketchikan. On ·the 7th coal was taken on board, and the vessel proceed:ed to Metlakatla and began work on the boathouse there.. From that time to tlle.end of the month the entire party was engaged in repairing the launches and, installing boilers and engines 'on them. · · . , , ·. · . . ., . . . . On June 30 the party sailed for Nichols Bay, from which place .on July 1 the wire-drag survey of .the waters, between Cape, Chacon. aµd .Nunez Rock. ,was begun.

A tide staff was erected in· the first bight, at the head of Southwest Channel in Nichols Buy, on which observations were made day,. and.. µight. Wire-drag work was continued throughout the month. A 300-foot. drag .W!\S used, set to 72 feet i;;o as to give an effective depth at 45 feet. Owli;i.g to the strong currents and the fact that the launches lack power, difficulty- was experienced in handling the drag, and it was difficult to continue .the drag lanes of unifol'm width. Topography and triangulation were carried. on by. the chief of party at the same time. Owing. to the removal of the lighthouse wharf at Ketchikan it was·necessary to move:the automatic tide gauge to a dock at the southerly end of the town and to install.another float box, Water levels were used in .placing the new. stnff at the same .elevation as the, old. It was. tern. porarilY connected by leveling with a near·by bench. mark. 'l'h.e Lighthouse Department .built the gauge house which is a very satisfuctory .structure.

. On July 1, 1920, the steamer Explorer with launche~ HeUanth~s and Scantlinavia, was engaged in' combined ,operations in southeast .Alaska, paying particular attention to tl1e. wire-drag work. All classes of work were ln progress at the beginning of the year. · . . . .· · , . The main scheme of triangulation was completed by the middle of August.,, . Supplemental triangulation was.(!arrieid on to locate additional stations in sufficient numbers to meet the prescribed standards of the. Alaska 1work. All stations were marked and described, and reference· marks were .e,stabJ.ished at each station occupied. All of. the triangulation ,was .completed, before ,leaving the field,. and additional observations were made ·where .ne'cess!lr)'... , , , , . The reconnoissance was. practically completed .during the previous fiscal .year, but the scheme contained a very short ,Une.at;I?oint League.. The scheme was. revised, but the requisite signals were.not constructed, and this work ,was left until the permanent triangulation party. was ready to occupy them. Observations for the magnetic declination. \Vere made tit .all main-scheme i;tations. , · · . ·. ·. . . The .topographic work was .carried on by one party through the season, and by an additional party for about ·half the i;;eason. ,Progress was .somewha.t retarded by the breaking down of the engine on one of the launches, ,making.it necessary .to µse .a :pulling boat for transporting. the party. lJl spite of this handicap, the topography was in advance of the other wo;rk by the end.of the season, and bad it not been for circumstances connected with tJie !lrag >york the entire. area assigned could have been finished. Both .shore· hues ,and form lin<>Js for. an average distance. of ,3 miles bacl· from the. shore froJ;D each side. of the channel were completed from the southern limits of the· work to,,and · iricludiug Grand Island. Several unfinished stretches of shore line left at the e;ud of the season 1917 were, completed this year. Each of these stretches required more ,tiine than,It \Vould have if .finished at that.time, as it was necessary to carry a traverse from some distance to establish .new stations for the control of the work. The shore .line was typical of the. Alaska coast: rocky shores. with, stretches of sand beach, occasional almost impassable cl11fs, in some cases,the sho,re being f1'inged with ol.'f-lying,rocks and kelp beds. · , AU,tomatic tide gauge observations we.re continued through the season, until October 11 at Taku Harbor Cannery. 'The bench marks established were connected by leveling with a bench mark established.ln 1888. . · . ·. · .· Tide staffs were placed in the localities designated by instructions, excepting .one, and in one additional locality, and enough obs'erv.ations 'ver.I) made a't each to. determine the stafJ'. readings of the plane of referenc\'l. Observatiops wei;e macl\'l and bench murks established at Cleveland Pa,ssage, Hoburt ·Buy, Pybus Bay, Gambier Bay, Windham.Bay, and.Holli:haiu 'Bay entrance (cove fost wei!t of Woodsp!t). The staff in Hobart.B~ was necessary 'for the.contr6l of work near this anchorage. . · . . · · . . . . . · The staff in Gambier Bay was established on .Good Island near the ahcliorage .in regular us.e; this was conneeted by simultaneous.observations with the sta;tr· established at tb,e cannery w,harf, and referred. to previous 'bench marks. . The ieadlng on stuff. of mean low. water, . deduced from. this complitison, 'is. almost exactly that a.educed by comparison of the series at Gooc'I Isla1,1d with the auto,matic tide gauge record at '.L'alcu Harbor. , Preliminary examinations of the results imd comparative 'cu,rves indicate that Taku Harbor is a. satisfactory location fQr the automatic gauge, .as the other .curves are very. similar except for the lmown difference in height of tl~e t.lde. It lllfl.Y be noted that in no case were the currents observed to me.et as. far south as the entrance to Taku Harbor, and in gei1eral the meeting place was nGrtherly at Point Arden as indicated on the ·chart. Current observations . were begim in.t!je mi(ldle of September. Observations were obtained at two stations, which though 1n or near the channels w.ere selected chiefly because of the niodflrate-

depth of water. The results were just sufficient to emphasize the lacl;: of knowledge of the currents of this region. The observations made at the first station are useful, but tend to give a wrong impression both of the strength and the confused character of the currents, as this point is probably less affected by the currents in and out of the numerous bays than any other that could have been selected. The obsenations were made by the Explorer anchored with the kedge and wire cable in. depths up to 80 fathoms. She had no facilities for anchoring in greater depths, a:nd the anchor was too small to hold her in a strong wind. A moderate amount of sounding work was done with the lead line, but more is required. No power boat was available to carry the line of sounding behind the drag. Some hydrography was done to locate the more obviaus defects in the charts of· the bays and harbors. This work was incomplete beC'ause of poor locations and insufficient time to make the proper development, but the results were of importance. Various notes were made of faC'ts of interest discovered during the season that affected the existing Coast Pilot. The localities were taken up in the same order as in the Coast Pilot. At the beginning of the fiscal year wire-drag work was in progress, but under a great handicap because of Jack of apparatus and material. The way to get a solution of this problem was just being realized, and all this was worked out during the present season. 'I.'he resulting changes have revolutionized Alasku wire-drug methods to such an extent that in deep-water worl;: the old methods could not be returned to even if desired. The rnethods developed on the Atlantic coast have proved to be not well suited to Alaslm because the drag moves too slowly. Expe1,ience shows that no assum11tion in regard to the direction of the currents will work out, and in such a region as Stephens Passage the drag which can proceed regardless of currents is the only practicable device. ' The total output of the season's work and the maximum daily output are not the true measure of what can be uccomplish.cd, as the work was handicapped by lack of material throughout the season, and at the end it was doubtful whether the supply of wire and drums would hold out. The real accomplishment of the season was the worldng out of an idea which had the double merit of greatly decreasing the maintenance of the worl;: and increasing the output in a given time. The daily output·under the conditions met with in Mt13' m1d .Tune could with the methods finally adopted have been more than rloubled. For convenience the apparatus developed will be called the sweep to dis' tinguish it from the drag; the purpose of the sweep being to rapidly cover deep areas, and of the drag to cover ull doubtful and shoal areas. The fundamental feutures of the sweep Dre: Very qu'ck setting out and taking up, which lengthens the working day (th'.s quick setting out keeps the drng in position so that no urea is lost by drifting as formerly) ; nontmportance of currents except thos~ of considerable strength (in no case was the sweep stopped by the currents, though the drag was several times brought to- a dead stop and had to be taken up), a possibility of rounding up all shoal areu with the sweep at high speed, leaving comparatively small ureas for the slow-moving drag; quick taking up makes bad weather of less importance, and it is .Possible to continue longer under unfavorable conditions. It .is possible to use the vessel economically with this drag ori account of the increased output. It has been stated that the drag is equally well suited for finding shouls and determining whether an apparently open sea is clear of all obstruct'.ons, urid for finding all obstructions that may exist in a given area .. For the fit·st use the drag has been superseded by the S\veep. For the second purpose the drag is !;lest equipped, but time is gained by closing in on the. shoals with the sweep. It would appear to be desirable to modify the drug for use in Alaska so that it would have more speed. Construction.-The sweep consists of a bottom wire madP up of units of ;tOO feet or of any greater length which can be obta'.ned without kinking. of the wire because of swivels being unable to take out the twist. The need for stronger swivels was ind'.cated by not infrequent shearing off of 1he heuds. Weak fittings can not be tolerated In a drag whose possible output ls 25 square miles p"er day. Uprights are 100-foot l'ections of bottom wire with swivels on each end, small weights are used solely to keep the uprights from becoming twisted a1'ound tile bottom w:re, ancl these are unnecessary if the uprights are shackled directly·to the ground wire and allowed to slide to a position against

one or other of the sockets at the end of u section. The weight of the wire does all the holding down necessary. No metal floats or any other flouts are used. Bottoni wire.-Three-sixteenths-inch wire was used dul'ing the last season as it was tlle only wire uvuiluble. Indications are that one-fourth-Inell wire of the same type should be used for at least half the sweep when towed by the E.xplomr. Three-sixteenths-Inch wire is more suitable to a. launch because of its less resistance. Method of attaching sockets '.s as <lescrilled though crimping the ends is found unnecessary. Links are not used. A:.11 connections are made for uprights and towLnes by passing a shackle over a swivel instead of putting the pin through the eye as formerly. Shackles so used should pass freely but should Il'lt be too large. Sockets for the quarter-inch wire should be drop-forged and not the heayy cast sockets on the market. Large and small weights.-The large weights require no change though, owing to the method of attachment just described, the staple at the lower end ·is no long-er necessary us all attachments are made at the upper end. The rod should be heavier than heretofore us these not infrequently bend or break,._ The small weight may be as described; the detail is not important, and it is frequently entirely omitted. . Large and wiall buoys.-Only one type of buoy has been used during the season. This is the standard 55 gallon drum with a rounded wooc1en bottom strapped to the drum. To the center of the bottom a 10-foot section of wire is shackled, but the lower end is attached so that the total length of upr:ght will be 110 feet. For quarter-inch wire the standard 110-gallon drums will he required. These drums have the greater advantage in that they are designed with greater cal'e nn<l are made of the best muterilll obtainable.

From March 24 to June 30, 1921, the steamer N.JJplorcr was engaged in continuing work begun in the previous season in extending an arc of primary triangulation from a qase in Dixons. Entrance, through Clarence Strait, east of Marmion and Nulikoff Islands through Frederick Sound, Stevens Passage, Gastineau Channel, and Lynn Canal to the headwaters of the Yukon, to which it was intended that all of the triangulation in southeastern Alaska should ultimately be connected and adjusted. Besides the triangulation the wire-drag work was to be carried through all of the principal channels. It was intended that a spur of tertiary triangulation should be carried up. Gastineau Channel for the control of the topography and hydrography. The instructions contemplated the development of the inshore hydrography of Gastineau Channel, including the rev!Rion of the hydrof"raphy between: .Juneau anti Salmon Cre"'k; ·anti the cc;nplet;un oi tlle dragging of L} 11n Cirnnl from the work done in 1917 to Skagway. 'l'he topography of Gastineau Channel was to be executed as far as SalnionCreek and the work extended to the head of Lynn Canal. In 1920 the gap in the triangulation of 1917, a distance of about 45 miles,. was filled in by tertiary triangulation by the party on the steamer Explorer, so . timt the main-scheme reconnoissance necessary to prepare the scheme fo1· primary. work was· completed. Two bases had been measured in 1917 at con.siderable distances from the localities at which the parties discontinued work .. The scheme for 1921 was accordingly ulmost a duplication of the previous year's tertiary work. Only a few stations 'vere moved to insure .better marking or improved conditions for setting up the instrument and tent. One station was. shifted to reduce observations necessary to reach the base site. After cai:eful study of the previous work and of the possible places for measuring bases, it was found' that two bases would be necessary. Excellent sites were found for both bases, and these were the only sites practicable. There are frequent stretches of sand beaches, but with very few exceptions they are cut off at short intervals by cliffs reaching to the low-water line. 'l'he base nets were ' .given careful study, and they have been included in the work. At the close of the year all but 3 of the 22 mnin-scheme stations were com· pleted, and satisfactory closures had been obtained. A few stations with very short lines had to be reoccupied. Nearly all of the work except on some of the· Ioilger lines was done by daylight-that is, early morning or late afternoon--· using targets which uncler the conditions appeared to eliminate phase in a satisfactory manner. Tertiary triangulation was done for the control of the hydrography anti topography in Gastin~nu Channel. A scheme of continuous quadrilatera,ls was: worked out. fl'his work was practically finished during the preliminary period· of preparation for the drag work. Special effort was made to recover and locate any Land Office .monuments, Geological ·Survey stations, etc., that could' be recovered. At the close of the year. only two stations remained to be observed. The triangulation done was continuous .with that of the previous year's worl,. At the end of the year worlc was completed to Point Young on the south side of· Stevens Passage, and form-line work was finished on both sides ot the channel'

to this .point. On the north .side work was continuous with tbat of the party -0perating here in 1917. 'l'he work .includes form lines not finished by tbls party. The work in Gastineau Channel was practically completed. Tbis was supplemented by information received from various sources-Land Office maps, Geological Survey maps, work of city engineers, mining companies, etc.-to avoid duplication and at the same time to produce a chart corrected to the present date. The magnetic work done includes the special survey of the area of local attraction of Port Suettisbam, both land and water observations. The former were done by compass declinometer and the latter with the ship's compass after careful determination of deviation. The phenomena of this region as developed proved of exceptional interest. A vessel proceeding at the speed of the Explorer past Sentinel Point will get a sudden very rapid shift of the compass through 5fi This worl{ required primary plane-table triangulation. l<Jlsewbere as many station's as practicable were occupied with the compal's declinometer to detect the C'Xistence of local attraction. This work was not earried very far, owing to the luck of an available boat and officers; In the hydrogruphic work the sweep was used practically us it was developed in the previous season. The amount of sweep work remaining from the last season's work was comparatively small. However, it was found that much of the shoal-water work with .general depths of over 20 fathoms could be covered with the sweep if the bo.ttom were not too rocky, and this was done to a degree previously believed impossible. No area that can I.le covered with the sweep in the general r_egion of Juneau reniains to be done. The sweep has been used successfully under very adverse conditions. On one <>ccasion off Port Snettisham the sweep was towed through violent tide rips with a head tide, the rips being such that the worst places had to be avoided b;i the tender for its safety, yet the progress of the sweep was not retarded. A number of shoals were found with the sweep and developed· with the drag. The customary length of the. sweep wris 12,000 feet'. This is now set out with the launches practically at full speed. Improvements in methods and apparatus have made this possible. Sweep worlr is now fully standardized. The open waters of Alaska present no further problem but simply the application of routine methods. No records of area were made during this period, as all of the work was completed before beginning the new locality. Preparations were completed for worlr on a large scale in Lynn Canal. The progress in wire-drag work represents the great advance made by this party in two seasons in Alaska. The drug developed on the Atlantic coast was u highly efficient apparatus and probably had reached its maximum possible development under prewar conditions. New ideas suggested by war experience, and in a no less degree improved materials resulting from investigations made by wire companies during the war, have placed this work on a new basis. The weakest feature of all drug work bad been its inability to contend with currents. With fair currents the drag had been wonderfully successful, and great results had been obtained in Alaska as well as on the Atlantic coast. 'With the substitution of the sweep for the drag in all deep-water work, it became im~ portant that the drag should be specially fitted to get more n·snlts in its · <>wn field. At the same time the shoal areas have always been characterized by stronger currents than the deep waters adjacent. The problem may now be considered solved. No claim is made that the drag worl' can be done successfully against all currents, but any ordinary conditions <!ause no difficulty now. Drags are towed at any desired speed without danger or damage to gear, and progress can be made whenever desired. The drag work of this season was exceptional in quantity for Alaska, in fact <!omparable with any work on the Atlantic coast except that greater results have been obtained in a given time than ever before. The alongshore area left · unfinished last year has been found to include a very considerable number of uncharted rocks, quite a few of them at dangerous depths. The improved behavior of the drag is due to new apparatus devised for the use of this party, and it is probable that the new methods and apparatus will have to be adopted in all drag work to stop the loss of time heretofore unavoidable. This applies to wire-drag work in any locality. The· sweep and the drag ,are now frequently used on the same day, no area that can be covered by the sweep being' done by tbe drag. It is now easy to do any required work With the drag, as there Is no difficulty in shifting the depth through wide ranges.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY·.

The drag work resulted in finding 18 rocks with a· less depth than charted, which is quite comparable with a similar amount of work done anywhere. The progress in wire-drag work has been notably increased by the new practice of obtaining soundings in advance in all doubtful areas. These soundings are often obtained just in advance of the drag work, the soundings being obtained on the same day and plotted before the drag reaches the area affected. This adds immensely to the value of the drag work. The drag depth is Irequently tested to make sure that the higher speed does not introduce uncertainty in depth. ' The time of setting out the drag is greatly reduced and also the time required to change the depth. In a recent case a 4,500-foot drag was lowere1l throughout its length, 4 feet in 14 minutes. This means that assuming that 6 minutes is spent in maneuvering at each buoy only an average of 48 seconds is required to stop at each buoy and change the depth. 'L'he lowering is so fast that the weights can not sink as far as the wire is pulled off the buoy, antl it is necessary for the tender to move the buoy so that the wire will run out" 'l'he possibility of quickly changing the drag depth makes it praetieable to go clOf~e to known shoals before changing the depth, and to lower the drag more quickly at pasl':!ing'; this. adds much to the value and economy of the work. 'raking the soundings in connection with the drag work is practically a new feature which was develo1Jed during the season, although soundings have been taken in the past. for the control of drag work. The conditions in Alaska are different from those elsewhere. In fact the charts are of little value for control of dl'ag depth, especially along the shore. The new practice of making a survey· along the shore and in the vicinity of shoals in advance of the drag work represents a marked advance, and by this means valuable information is obtained in regard to a heretofore unknown area in drag work, that lying .between the work of the drag and the topography of the shore. . This is made possible by the three-man hydrographic launch. By the methods developed it is very easy to do this work without unnecessary expense and with no delay to other work. Another development is the elimination of the cotton leacl line in co1mectio11 with drag work. The lead line now used is of the same wire as the uprights and is very flexible. Its small diameter makes it por;sible to keep it vertical in the slow current. It is not as hard on the hands as might be expected. Grnduations are painted at 1-foot intervals. Th'.s eliminates all uncertainty in regard to depth· and does away with the uncertaint~· of entering old-line corre<;tions in the 1·ecords. 'l'he soundings are placed as in ordinary hydrography. Their lm11mse is tn find the width of the shoal reef along the shore or the general extent of a sllonl. This is done by a single line of soundings along the shore if the shelf is narrow. If it is broad, zigzag lines are run in order to get the curves more rapidly, and later one or more lines parallel to the shore are run. Positions are taken at every sounding, the launch being stopped for each sounding. Automatic tide· gauge observations were taken at Taku Harbor dnring theprogress of the work. Staff readings were obtained in the vicinity of work . distant from the automatic gauge as during the past season. Bench marks were connected with gauges by lines of leveling. Several areas, suitable landing fields for airplanes, were examined. The only difficulty was in finding fields in the vicinity of towns. The emergency fields more or less accessible to. other lines of connection are easily found.

On July 1; 1920, field work was in progress by the steamer Lyaonia on tile west coast of Dall Island, southeast Alaska. . , . The short season available for work made it desirable to confine operatious to one urea and to complete as far as possible all work within that area, For.· this reason the triangulation connecting Bucareli Bay with Noyes Island \Vas not undertaken. An effort was made to complete the topography and hydrog, raphy along the coast of Dall faland. · '

The unfinished worlr within the area in which the Party was workin~ included the hydrography of Sakie Bay ; investigation of several shoal soundings along the shore of Dall Island; further development, on south coast of Suemez Island; and continuation of the shore line on Dal( Island from station I.111st northward to a satisfactory junction with previous work. · The ship was engaged on offshore soundings from August 23 to ·the end of the season. · The Cosmos was engaged on inshore hydrography between Cape Augustine an<l Meares Passage during the entire season, except for 10 days spent on triangulation. The topography from Cape Augustine to station Last nt the entrance to Meares Passage was done by a suhparty with the launch !/'/ operating from a camp. At Craig an automatic tide gauge was left in operation throughout the season. A very good record was obtained covering four months. At Sea Otter Harbor an automatic gauge was kept in operation by the hydrographic party for tidal reductions. 'l'he tidal record obtained from this station was unsatisfactory, and the record was only used for simultaneous ob. servations with the Craig station and for a comparison of.l10urly heights. A comparison of the hourly heights of tides between Sea Otter Harbor anll Craig station, covering five different periods, totaling 24 dars between July 29 and October 7, shows the greatest discrepancy to be plus or minus 1 foot with an average plus or minus four-tenths of a foot. Because of this small difference in height the Craig data were used for all tidal reductions entered in the sounding record. The Sea Otter record was not used at all. Sea Otter Harbor on Dall Island was used throughout the season as a bai;e for the detached parties, and a season's supply of coal and provisions was stored here. Ketchikan was the base for the ship, as there was no place closer to the working grounds where coal could be landed. Early in the season no suitable docks were available for storing coal. After August 1, a dock at Waterfall was available, but transportation then ,was too uncertain. One trip was made to Prince Rupert, British Columbia, for coal ; at all other times Ketchikan .was able to supply it. . '.!;he weather during the season \vas fair. The parties working along tllfl shore encountered much more fog and rain tha;n did the ship wol·king offshore. Weather conditions are extremely local, and there is no way of judgiug the weather other than by being on the immediate working grounds. On August 30, the locality was hit by a sudden and severe southeaster. At the first indication of bad weather the ship, sounding to the soutJnvard of Baker Island, ran to Cape Felix, a two hours' ruu, hoping to he able to pick up a whaleboat party which had been landed there that morning. On reL\Ching Cape Felix, the vessel steamed about for an 110ur watching for the whaleboat. party which it was thought might have put out from shore before tlie storm. Seeing nothing, the ship remained in Port Santa Cruz during the night; and next morning st.earned back to Cape Felix and found the party safe on shore, although the boat was broken up on the beach. Sounding tubes were used in this work with good results.
[J, S. BILBY.]

Under instructions dated April 20, 1921, this officer left Washington, April 22, for Ketchikan, Alaska, to construct. launch ways and a boathouse at that place for the use of the vessels of the Survey. Owing to delays in transportation the party was unable to leave Seattle until May 15, arriving at Ketchikan on the 18th. On May 19, with the cooperation of the superintendent of lighthouses at Ketchllmn, a site for the ways was selected in the most favorable place available on land covered by a license held by the Pure Food Fish Co., of Ketchikan. Satisfactory arrangements were made with this company to remove any of their property that might interfere with ~he construction of the ways so that work might start immediately. The work of clearing the ground, which was heavi1~1 tiJ.llbered, was begun May 21, and by June 2 the grouncl was cleared, stumps grubbed out, pni;t of the lumber and material on the ground, and work on the foundation beg1m. By June 30 the building was incJosed, t.he building of ways well advanced, and all the necessary material on the ground for completing the work. ·

SITKA MAGNl!.'TIC OBSERVATORY.
[F, P. ULRICH.]

The work of the Sitka magnetic observatory has been carried out without material interruption throughout the year. The magnetograph has been kept in continuous operation. Tbe D and H variometers worked very satisfactorily and .required little adjustment. At the end of the year, the H variometer was taken apart in order to secure a freer movement .of the collar which holds the deflection bar. Considerable trouble was experienced with changing scale value of the Z variometer, and it was cleaned and adjusted on June 30. At least one component of the seismograph was in operation throughout the year, but only nine earthquakes were recorded. Much trouble was experienced with the bearings of the recording arm of the E-W component, so that the instrument was either out of commission or not giving .satisfactory record for the greater part of the year.. New steel cup bearings were inserted on June 28, which are apparently very satisfactory. . Absolute observations were made once a week and scale value determiuntions at least once a month. Comparison observations were made with magnetometer No. 40, which had previously been compared at Cheltenham, '.l'ucson, and Honolulu. The.chronometers were kept rated by means of time signals from the local office of the U. S. Signal Corps. Various repairs were made to .the. buildings, and the clearing of the observatory grounds was completed

HONOLULU .MAGNETIC OBSERV4.TORY.

[H. E; McCOMB.]

The wo1·k of the Honolulu magnetic observatory was carried out without interruption throughout the year except as noted below. The magnetograph was kept in continuous operation and required. little adjusting. The usual scalevalue and base-line determinations were made. The installation of a small wireless receiving set early in 1921 made it poss:ble to get the time signals sent out daily from Pearl Harbor and dispense with solar observations with sextant and artificial horizon. The old Milne seismograph was dismounted on January 27, and work was begun at once on the construction of piers for the new Milne-Shaw seismograph. The work was delayed somewhat by the breaking of the pump, so that water for mixing the concrete had to be taken from the well in buckets. The new instrument was mounted on February 19, and the continuous record begun on the 27th. Except for this period of a month a seismograph was in operation throughout the year, and 88 earthquakes were recorded. In April, 1921, a party from· the yacht Carnegie, of the department of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, made an extended series of observations at the observatory for comparing their instruments with those at the observatory. Simultaneous observations were made, using an auxiliary station near the absolute building, with interchange of station in the m!ddle of each series of observations. During August, 1920, the chiefs of the divisions of geodesy and terrestrial magnetism visited Honoluhi as delegates to the Pan-Pacific Scientific Congress· and while on th;s duty inspected the magnetic observatory. The observer was a this congress and was able to attend the meetings. on the local delegate island of Hawaii through the kindness of a former magnetic observer now resident in Oalm who was willing to. take temporary charge of the observatory. . The buildings were painted outside, a new dark room was fitted up· in the building used also for a garage, a vestibule was added to the seismograph house, many minor repairs and alterations were made to the observers' quarters, and· the inside was painted. · , A siphon lamp filler was made for use with the magnetograph lamp and· proved to be a great convenience and tirnesaver. Drawings for a new magneto' graph reading glass wei:e prepared and submitted to the office, and scales of this style are now in use at all of the o.bservatories.

. DurinG" the first half of the fiscal year 1921 the qua~tity. of surveying results and of <!hurt construction nccompllshed b~· the l\Iunilu field. station was. mucb below the normal, due to the greatly depleted numbers in both field and office force assigned to this station. Only two vessels were engaged in sun·eying ,..;·ork during this period, as it was impracticable to furnish the necessar3· complement of officers for additional ''essels. The office work was serious!~· handicapped by the insufficiency of technical help, which caused additional work to be placed on those already laboring under multiplied. duties. 'l'he field work accomplished includes the following: West coast of Jlfinclanao-Dapltan to Caldera Buy. 'l'he triangulation of this streteh of coast line was completed, uncl the work of topography and inshore hydrogruphy had progressed to the extent that only a short time would be required to complete it. Cuvo West Pass.-The dctailPrl sun·py of the waters of Cuyo West Pass that had been in progress for the past threP years was completed October 2 . .Ea8t coa8t of Luzon l8lm1d.-A cnreful im·estigution wns made of the waters off the north coast of the Camarines, which shows thut the reported extensive 3 fathoms bank 36 miles off this coast does not exist. The result of this investigation will fumisli the navigator of deep-draft vessels all desired information for the safe approach to the port of Homlaguu, the east coast terminal of the Manila Railway Co. The principal routes of commerce in the archipelago have been surveyed; the greater part of the remaining work to be done hi distantly located from a base of suppliEJ$ and coaling station. ' Although the surveying opera,tions planned for the year 1921. will be carried on wlt11 "the present existing conveniences, economy will require that a coaling station be establi&hed on the we!lt coast of Palawan ann at Aparri, north coast of Luzon, before the sun·eys in the><e locallties are attempted. , On August 31 a severe typhoon passed over Manila and did considerable damage to the working equipment of the Survey. The s.teamer Mari.nduque, which was moored at Engineer Island, having just completed extensive repairs, was fouled by a vessel that had been blown adrift by the storm and sustained consldemble damage. One whaleboat, property of the United States Government, on the steamer Romblon, was destroyed. The Manila tide station, located on one of the Government piers, was completely demolished. Preliminary steps toward building a new station to be located on the new concrete pier, in process of construction b~· the Philippine Island Government, were immediately begun. An appropriation was made for this worlc by the Philippine Government. On October 3 a disastrous fire occurred in the building in which are located the Manila offices of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, but due to the timely nsslstance of a number of employees the loss sustained by the Coai;t uud Geodetic Survey was of no consequence, and on the second day after the fire the routine business of the Bureau was being conducted as before. Satisfactory progress hns been made on the building to J10use the photo· gi·aphic plant, which was expected to be ready for occupancy upon the arrival of the machinery. , · During the half year 'ending .June 30. 1921, the party of the steamer Pathfinder was engaged in extending the hydrography off the north coast of Camarines Norte, between .Tomallg and Cutanduanes Islands, to the depth of 1,000 fathoms. This worlc included the search for the extensive 3 to 5 fathoms bank shown on the exi&ting charts of this area. The worlc progressed satisfactorily and disproved the existence of any obstructions to navigation In the area formerly shown as dangerous. The party on the vessel also successfu~ly ct?mPleted the work of extending the triangulation on Negros Island to a Junction with the triangulation on the south coast of Mindanao Island, at Sibuguey Bay. The party of the steamer Patho111er was engaged during the year in com-. bined operations on the west coast ·of Zmnbounga Peninsula, deep-sea hydrography in the Sulu Sea, nnd a hyclrographic survey of Cuyo West Pass, and the

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Triangulation: 4,705 square miles of area covered; 54 signal ~les erected ; 5 observing tripods and scall'olds built, heights 14, 17, 38, 12, and 65 feet; !..2 stations in main scheme occupied for horizontal measures; 13 stations In supplemental 8chemes occupied for horizontal measures; 16 stations occupied for vertical measures; 61 geo;;raJ?hic posHioD:s determined. Hydrograpl!y: 4,485 square miles of area covered; 1,!l07.2 miles run wl11le sounding; 6,946 positions determined (double angles) ; 29,021 soundings made; 3 tidal stations established; 2 hydrographic sheets finished, scales 1 : 40,000 and 1 : 200,000.

After completing repairs at the Olongapo Naval Station, the steamer Pathf/Jnder proceeded to Manila to take on stores and prepare for work off the east coast of Luzon. The vessel was ready to sail for the working grounds on July 15, but on account of the unfavorable weather Iler sailing was delayed until July 26 when the weather moderated sufficient!~' to permit a start. The ship arrived at Batun Harbor on July 28, where the bunkers were .filled with Batan conl. This coal is of an inferior quality, but owing to the high price of Japanese coal and the great distance to a coaling station it had been decided that the Pathfinder should make an attempt to use this coal. After some experimenting a method was discovered by which this coal could be used with fair results, and on the morning of July 30 the vessel started for the working grounds. 'l'he instructions called for the offshore hydrography of a large area extending from Catanduanes Island to the Polillo group, and the development of a great 3 to 5 fathom shoal which appeared on all existing charts having been handed down from the earliest Spanish sailing directions. The tide station was recovered in Sisiran Bay, a staff erected, and levels run to connect with the old bench marl{. The readings of this staff were used for the reduction of the entire season's hydrograplly. The ship's hydrography was at once taken up and continued with but few breaks to the end of the season. Lines were run in a north and south ,(true) direction one-half mile apart to the 100-fathom curve, and from there on gradually wi<1eued until they were about 5 miles apart at the 1,000-fathom curve. Tanner-Blisch pressure tubes were used in depths up to aJJOut 40 fathoms with up-and-down casts ahout eYery tenth sounding. In deeper water vertical wire measures were made. Considerable time was saved by anchoring with a kedge and a rope wherever tbe ship happened to be when overtaken by <lurkness. At daybreak the line was simply continued. Officers and crew were assif,'1Ied to regular watches so that the ship could operate 24 hours per day, and always did so when running out to the 1,000-fathom curve. The shore signals could be carried barely to the 100-fathom curve, hence the work beyond that line depended upon astronomic fixes and dead reckoning. The dangerous shoal shown on the charts was not found. However, at the edge of the great 40-fnthom bank extending about 35 miles offshore, there was found a long ridge with 10 to 20 fathoms over it, extending in a direction parallel with the shore line. It is possible that this ridge through exaggeration has been reported as the" 3 to 5 fathom bank." No dangers to navigation were found during the season. 'While a large arPa was finished during the season:, the worlc was not completed, and at least one more season's work is required. Upon arrival at Manila instructions were received to prepare for field work on the northwest coast of Mindanao. 'l'he work assigned was to complete the triangulation started during the previous year by this v.essel and to make u conneet'on with the old work in Sibuguey Bay. After' having a few minor but essential repairs made at the Cavite Naval station, and having outfitted the ship, the 'Pathfinder sailed for the working grounds on November 1. While off the coast of Panay a typhoon warning was receiv<:id, and ns it wns apparent that the storm would be a d11ngerous one for the Visayan

Islands, the Path'fi,nder sought shelter in Iloilo. This port was reached about five hours before the force of the storm broke, and a snug berth was found in th.e river. The c~nter passed .a short distance to the north, and very heavy wmds were expenenced in Ilo1lo, but no damage was done to. the ship. Over 200 houses were· blown down in ·that city, and several small cruft were lost in the neighboring waters. After the storm passed the, Pathfiniler continued her Yoyage and arrived on the working grounds in the early morning of November 6. The triangulation to be accomplished w11s a scheme extending from southern Negros to Sibuguey Bay, a distance of about 95 miles, and involvin" several lines up to 7G miles in length. Most of the signals had been built the"'previous year and were standing, but. observations at two stations only had been completed. More clearing ·was required at two stat!ons, and station Lftbuk (Fathomer, 1920) had bi be rebuilt. This was unfortunate, as it was 11 concluded station in the instructions of this party and otherwise would not have been visited. The longest line, Slaton-Dnnsalan, remained unobserved in either -direction. For the long lines special heliotropes were ma.de on board wlth mirrors 12 inches square. This large size was considered necessary, owing to the fact that the atmosphere is usually hazy at this time of the year and a powerful glare Is needed to penetrate it. Upon, arrival the various signal structures were inspected, and four parties of observers and heliotropers were immediately put in camp, while the ship recovered the station on Aligbay Island and built a signal over it. This station was also occupied by a party from the ship during the time it was tending the \'arious parties encamped ashore. By November 21 it was necessary to go for coal, so the ship left for Sandakan via Zamboangu, where a subparty was disputched to Sibuguey Bay to rebuild and do the necessary clearing at station Quipit. Tiley arrived at S'andakan early on November 24, and after taking on 284 tons of coal, sailed at 6 p. m. the same day. This was an unusually quick coaling. Upon return to the working ground· it wus found that the observations had been completed to the line Dansalan-Talinga. Parties were then sent to rebuild and clear at Coronado and to rebuild Labuk. By December 10 this work was completed, and the ship proceeded to Sibuguey Bay to start that end of the work. An observer with heliotropers was put in camp on Mount Quipit, and the ship took up the work of recovering and building signals over old stations Pan and Wedge located on islands in Sibuguey Bay. These stations formed the line to which the connection was to be made. After completing this work the Path'fi,nder returned to the northwest coast of Mindanao to pick up the party left at Coronado. A bad surf was running. but the party was finally picked up without serious accident. The whaleboat was dmnaged somewhat and the theodolite soaked with salt water, but none of the party received injuries. · The ship then returned to Sibuguey nay, and on December 22 a party of 1 officer and 15 men was dispatched to station North End ( F'athomer,.1920) to rebuild and occupy that station, also to clear lines of sight to points .in Sibuguey Bay. With obi;;ervers and heliotropers stationed at Quipit, Pan, and Wedge, thev were in a position to complete the work as soon as North End made its appearance. On December 28 North End suddenly appeared, and in a short time observations on it were completed. By December 31 all parties were back aboard the ship, and the vessel left · that night for Manila. The officer who was in charge of the party at North End ran into a very heavy job of clearing and was unQ.ble to fi~1ish in the time estimated, thus irncessitating that the party go on short rations for ~everal. t~ays. After !he .signal was erected he f'ent 12 of his men back and remamed with 3 men to fimsh the observing. He completed his program but was forced to travel 36 hours without food before reaching the bench. The party was badly exhausted but rapidly recovered without serious results. . . . While encamped under the signal structure at Dlsacan this party had n narrow escape from serious accident. During a heavy electrical storm the signal was struclc by lightning and partially destroyed, but fortnnatel;r none of the party were struck by falling timbers. They reported that the wire guys were :repeatedly red hot and that several of them fused. None M the party were injured by the shock.

.REPORT OF DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Taken. as a whole this piece of triangulation was a very difficult one, and the hard and conscientious work performed by the various oillcers and crew is nereby acknowledged. Aclmowledgment is also made to the superintendent of the San Ramon Penal Farm who furnishe(l large parties of prison laborers on two occasions for the very difficult expeditions. These men are far stronger and better on the trail than the sailors aboard the ship, and they proved a great assistance in. the successful prosecution of the work. From January 1 to 5 the Pathfinder \vas engaged in combined surveys on the west coast of Mindanao when she was taken to Olongapo Naval Station for· . repairs. Necessary repairs having been completed, the. Pathfinder arrived on her working grounds in Lagonoy Gulf March 16, and was engaged in surveying· operations from that date until May 16, when she proceeded to Jomalig Island and took up hydrographic work in that vicinity. In June the hydrography in the vicinity of Jomalig Island was finished, and the vessel began the work of deep-sea sounding between Jomalig and Catancluanes Islands, which was in. progress at the close of the fiscal year.

SUMMARY oF llESULTs.-Levellng: G permanent bench marks established; 19.5 miles of · levels run. :Magnetic work: 5 land stations occupied for magnetic decllnation; 2 stations at sea at which ship was completely swung. 'l'opography: 322.5 square miles of area surveyed; 211 miles of coast line surveyed; 3 miles of shoro line of rivers sm·veyed; 7 topographic sheets finished, scale 1: 20,000. Hydrography: 7,882.9 square miles of area covered; 11,803.6 miles run while sounding; 13,817 positions determined (double angles) ; 73,199 soundings made; 8 tide stations establ!she<l; 3 cun·ent stations. occupied ; 11 hydroi,'Taphlc sheets finished, scales 1 : 20,000, 1 : 40,000, 1 : 80,000, 1 : 100,000, and 1 : 200,000.

Ship hydrography was in progress by the F'athomcr in Cnyo West Pass from July 1 to August 4. On August 5 the ship discontinued worl{ temporarily and sailed for Manila for minor repairs und supplies. The week from August '7 to August 15 was spent at Engineers Island. On the 16th the ship sailed again for the working grounds in Cuyo West Pass, arriving early on the morning of the 17th.. Ship hydrography wus at once resumed. 'l'his was continued, with interruptions by unfavorable weather, until October 3, when the work in this vicinity was completed. The ship sailed for Maniln the snme day, arriving on the 4th. From the 5th to the 30th the ship was again undergoing minor engine repairs and deck repairs, including docking and painting. During that time the officers were preparing the records for transmission to the office. On October 30 the fl'athomer sailed for the working grounds along the west coast of the Zamboanga Peninsula to resume the combined operations which were closed on May 12 in accordance with instructions. · Work was begun at once. An automatic tide gauge was established at Port Santa Maria, and one officer was put in camp to do the topography in that vicinity. The ship proceeded to Slbulrn Bay, where a tide staff was established and another officer put in camp for topography. From here the ship went south to· continue the work done on the first topographic sheet of the previous season, from San Ramon north. The first few days v;;ere spent in building and recovering old signals. The third topographic party was ,started at onre and soon established enough signals to control the launch hydrography which was then started. From that time the work advanced rapidly, with but slight interruption to the end of the year. Ship hydrography was 'started after the :first coaling. That also progressed without Interruption until the week before the Christmas holidays, when rough weather, caused by a typhoon to the north,, and very hazy weather. made it impossible to get any distance offshore. The work in Ouyo West Pass is tukea up Jn detail in descriptive report accompanyi'ng 1;he hydrographic sheet. As stated there the greatest hindrance was the haze, which was especially bad during July and August. Later there was much excellent weather, with but one interruption, due to a bad typhoon, which made the ship seelr shelter. . The work on the Zamboanga Peninsula proceeded· rapidly, With the exception of the southern end of the first sheet the coast is extremely steep to. This limited the launch work to not more than a mHe offshore, where more than 300 .fathoms are sometimes found. Consequently the launch hydrography proceeded very rapidly. By December 31 two sheets were completed and several duys' work done on a third. J<Jxtremely rough weather held up the work

this sheet for several days. No shoals or indications were found on any of these sheets. · . The ship hydrogruphy also advanced satisfactorily. The launch as well as one topographic party worked from the ship, and it was necessal'Y to arrange the work so that these parties·could be picked up at night. The work was carried from limits of the launch sheets to points 15 or 20 miles offshore: ·while the bottom is in general quite irregular no dangers were found. In fact the only shoal found is one with o. least depth of 48 fathoms with from 200 to 700 fathoms near by. The first six weeks were in general quite favorable for topography, and rapid progress was made .on thr~e .:11eets. Afternoon rain squalls aud cloudy mountain }Jeaks were a hindrance though not serious. During the latter half of December rough weather maue landing on the rocky and exposed coast n hazardous undertaking, and little was accomplished. This unusually rough weather was probably due to the combined effects of the regular northeast monsoon and a typhoon. The former blo\VS with increasing vigor during tile months of Jan· uary and F.ebruary and further unfavomlJle weather is to -be ex11ected. Three 1: 20,000 sheets were practically complete, and some progress was mad!) -0n two others. Also a sulJsheet 1: 10,000 of Port Santa Maria Harbor was eompleted. \Vork was in progress on the triangulation at the end of December. This was for the purpose of establishing control for the topography above Port Sauta Marla. The party of the steamer Pathfinder obserYcd on some of the latter while occupying triangulation stations to the northwanl. Five magnetic stations were. occupied in the Cuyos, at three of which magnetic disturbances were found. No stations :were occupied on the Zamboanga Peninsula. While the launch work \Vas il1 progress on the sheet aboYe Snn Ramon the ship observed currents nightly. This was done every hour by the quartermaster -0n' watch. . . The steamer .J1'athomer was at l\Ianila undergoing repairs from January 13 to April lCl, .1921. On April 17 combined operations were begun in the Snlu Sea in the vicinity of the Cugayan Islands, and this work wns in progres:s at the close of the fiscal year. After December 31 one inshore hydrographic sheet on the Zarnboanga Penin, sula was completed and another about t\vo-thil'ds completeu. " 7 hen the ship left the working ground all of the hyurography hall been complete(! up to a point about 1~ miles north of Port Santa Marin. , Three of the four hydrogrnphic sheets in the vicinity of the Cagnynn Islands were completed, anu the fourth was nearly completed. The topography was complete(! from Sun Hnmon north to a point. about 3 miles nortli of Port Santa Marin. On the Zamboanga Peninsula two new triangulation stations were estab" lished nnd six stations occupied for topographic control. In the Cagu~·an Islands two main-scheme stations were built, two rebuilt, nnd all were occuriied. Three intersection stations were built for hydrographic eontrol. In addition, five floating signals were built on the Nichols<m Shoals and the Sultana Bnnlcs and were locateu by extant angles on a scheme running northward from the existing triangulation.

SUMMARY OF nEsULTs.-Triangulatlon, terftary : 18.5 square miles of area covered ~ 16 signal poles erected; 2 observing scaffolds built, height 20 feet; 6 stations in main scheme occupied for horizontal measures; 2 stations in supplemental schemes occupied for horizontal measures ; 19 geographic positions determined. Magnetic work: 7 land stations occupied for magnetic declination.

Under instructions dated October 23, 1920, an officer of the Survey left \Vashington, November 12, for St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, taking passage on the 15th on' the naval transport Hancoclc, but owing to various delays did not arrive at St. Thomas until December 2. 'Preparations were immediately begun for the organization of the party for work on the island of St. Croix. While in St. Thomas a revision was made of Harbor Chart No. 933, wiHc.h was completed on December 15. On December 22 the party sailed for Frederik$ted on the island of St. Croix and crossed over overland to Ohristiansted, where the headquarters of the party· were to be. The hands had been sent directly to Christiansted on the small schooner. The remaining portion of December was spent in revising a topographic sheet completed during the previous season, as required by the instructions for this worlr. Up to the middle of January the party was engaged in the verification of this sheet. By January 15 work was begun on another sheet including an area of 24 square miles through the center of the isla11d of St. CroJx from shore t0< shore. \Vhile engaged on this work a rapid reconnoissance was made with a view to the selection of sites suitable for landing fields for airplanes, as the result of which Mannings Bay was reported to be the only site available without extensive preparation. After the completion of field work in this locality further information was gathered as to boundary lines and estate names which were required to be shown on the sheets. This requirement made necessary a close examination of the ground and the determination of an unusual number of controlling elevations. The survey of the eastern end of the island of St. Croix, part of which had been left unfinished at the close of t11e previous season, covers an uninhabited region practically without roads and covered with a dense tropical growth. Buck faland and Green Bay were inchtded in this survey, \Vork in this section was begun about the middle of April. , The triangulation was carried along with the topography and the entire survey was concluded about the 7th of June. This brought to a close the land survey of the Virgin Islands begun in 1918. Triangulation control was extended over the east end of the island, including Buck Island, from the line Sight-Green determined in a previous season. Four of the triangulation stations were occupied for magnetic declination.

substitute the mainspring of the reserve clock for the broken one, ·and registration was resumed on June 24. From May 13 to 17, 1921, a very severe magnetic storm was recorded. The Z variometer required considerable adjustment during the first part of the year, due principally t() the pivots, in one case the jarring due to a severe .earthquake shock being sufficient, apparently, to dull the points. A new pair of pivots was installed about the middle of the year, and the variometer gave very satisfactory record for the remaining six months. A comparison of magnetometer No. 19 and dip circle No. 56 with the observatory instruments was completed during July, 1920. The seismograph was in continuous operation, and 25 earthquakes were re· corded. Absolute observations were made once a week, scale value determinations at least once a month, and meteorologic observations daily. '.l'ime was determined by means of equal altitudes of the sun.
SPECIAL DUTY.
IKTERNATIONA!, COOPERATION CONFERENCE. [WJJ,LIAM BOWIE and H. G. AVERS.)

.

On March 8, l92l, the chief of the division of geodesJ·, accompanied by H. G. Avers, geodetic computer, went to Ottawa, Canada, for a conference with the Superintendent and other officials of the Geodetic Survey of Canada in regard to plans for cooperating in carrying precise triangulation along .the forty-ninth parallel boundary and from Puget Sound into Alaska. Plans were also made at this conference to make several additional connections between the precise leYeling nets of the two countries and then adjust tlie two nets together. This will eliminate any possibility of troublesome discrepancies along the border.
PAN-PACIFIC SCIENTIFIC
CONFERE~CE.

[J. T.

WATKINS.)

Under instructions dated .July 12, 1920, an officer 'vas designated by the Department of State as a delegate to the First Pan.Pacific Scientific Congress, to be held in the city of Honolulu, Hawaii, August 2 to 20, 1920. Under verbal notification and instruction issued by the Director dated July 8, 1920, this officer left Washington July 10, arriving in S11n Francisco on the HJth, and sailed from San Francisco for Honolulu on July 21 on the steamship Manoa in company with 14 others on the same mission. Immediately after arrival at Honolulu on July 28 visits were made to the officials of the Territorial Government anti others and preliminary work for the conference was begun. '.rhe general organization of the conference was effected at the first meeting on August 2. and is outlined in the program submitted. The subdivision of the membership into sections, to which were assigned groups of closely related i;:uhjects for consideration and recommendation, and the formation of subsections within the sections where the major subject embraced several Clearly defined and differentiated topics, greatly facilitated the dellberntions of the conference. and contributed much toward extending the scope and increasing the thoroughness of its work. While the sessions of the conference were deYoted to the }lresentation of general policies and subjects in their broader,nspects, as indicated in the programs, tile sections and subsections were more or less continuously engaged ·in the consideration of their assigned topics in detail and in the preparation of reports and recommendations which served as a basis for the adopted resolutions. By reason of his connection with the Coast and Geodetic Suney the interest of the representative of the SnrvPy centered largely in the section of geography, and more particularly in tlle subsections of peysicul oceanography ; lie is responsible for those parts of the resolutions which have to do with (a) "Magnetic Survey" and (b) "Survey of the .Shore Line and the Coastal Waters.'' ·The conference was informative to an unexpected degree, aml in thnt respect will doubtless contribute notably toward cooperation and coorclination in. tl1e se\·eral interdependent lines of work to be undertaken in t11e scientific explor1t-

tion of the Pacific Ocean. It was apparent at the early sessions that work· in nwny fields of htquiry had been pursued without a full knowledge of the extent of the collected data on other related subjects or a' clear understanding of their common interests. In establishing the necessity for such research work, indicating its greut scientific and economic Yalue, and pointing the way toward a- more complete utilization of existing material, the avoidance of duplicaton and a closer cooperation, the conference was a success. The proceedings of the conference dealt only with technical and scientific subjects and the ways and means of obtaining' in satisfactory fashion desired results in vurious lines of research. No engngements were entered into and no commitments made; the activities of the delegates did not go beyond a statement of the present and future needs in the various fields of inquiry und expression of deep personal interest and a pledge to forward in all legitimate ways the projects recommended in the resolutions. The work of the conference was made pleasant and profitable largely through the labors of the local organizing committees of the Pun-Pacific Union and to a marked degree by the untiring efforts of the Territorial Government and the citizens. The intelligent and appreciatiYe intere;;t <lispla~·ed· by the pc>ople of the islands and the sym'[lathethic support tendered by them on all occasions served as a strong urge to t11e conference and encouraged the hopes that many of the vrojects embodied in the l'PSolutions will soon bP initiated. The record of the proceedings of the conference was in preparation when this report \Yas written, and it was the expectation that it would be published early in 1921. · The conference concimled its labors on August 20 and adjourned. While in Honolulu the representati\'e 01' the Coast and Geodetic Survey was engaged part of 1.he time with matters having to do with various branches of the work of the Coast and Geodetic Sm·vey in the islands nncl bearing only indirectly upon his duties at the conference.
INSPECTION DUTY.

[C. V. HODGSON.)

In the latter 1mrt of October, 1920, the assh;;tant chiej' of the division of geodesy went to Yonkers, N. Y., to consult with the city officials and to inspect the precise triangulation covering the city, which was being done under the city engineer. The scheme of precise control was found to be very well planned, and the worl' was making satisfactory p1·ogress. Some suggestions were made as to · details of the work to bring the methods more nearly in accord with' the most recent practices of the Coast and Gt.'oclctic Survey. The city oflicials expressed their appreciation of the assistance rencle1·ed them.
[WU,L!HI BOWIE.)

On .July 11, 1!)20, the chief of the division of gl'Odesy started on an inspection trip which included two leveling partiPI" in Oregon, the magnetic observatory near Honolulu, a triangulation party in Arizona, and a traverse party in Illinois. While in the Hawaiian Islands he atte,nded and took an actirn part in the meetings of the Pan-Pacific Scientific Congress and also hacl numerous conferences with the governor and suneyor of the Territory of Hawaii, and with otlwr officials as to the need for work by this Bureau in the islands. He returned to Washington on Sevtember 9, 1920. Later, on February 11, 1921, he went to Boston, Mass., for.a conference with the inspector in charge of tlmt·field station and with .various city officials in regard to certain level lines needed in .nnd around Boston and in regard to plans for cooperation between the cit~· and this Bm·eau for doing the work.

.Su~IMARY

Although an extensive program of aerial. phot:otopography lmd been mappe.d out early in the year, the Air Sen·iees of the Army and Navy were unable to cooperate with this Bureau to the extent expected, and only u small portion of the work requested wns done. Requests were made. on the Air Service of the Army for a total of 2,660 square miles, comprising specified areas along the Atlantlc coast from New York to Florida. '.rhey were unable to phot0:graph any of these areas during the year. '.rhe only are!t requested from the Navy Air Senice ,\·as the Delta of the Mississippi IUver, nncl 232 square miles of this urea were photogrnphed in the spring of the year. This projeet will be continued in .the coming fiscal year. " · The ofllce work on the photographs of the New .Jersey coast, whi~h were taken in March, 1920. and wllich were referred to in the last annual report, was completed. Briefly, the process was us follows: Mosaics were constructed of convenient length, control points identified, .and recluctions made by means of the pUl\togmph to the scale of the chart, only those data being reduced that were to appear on the chart. After the data had all been compared with the existing. chart, it was found neceRsary to malrn a tleld inspection in <>rder to account for discrepancies to fill in shore line missed bY the photo· graphs, to yerify fPatures which were .not clear in the photogt'nphs, 'and to obtain other information otherwise not shown. The mosaics were examined in turn as the trip \\'HS nnvle from Cape M11y to Seabright, Notes were made directly on the mosaics. After the field inspection only a few hours' office work was necessnry to co!'l'eet the re<luctionfl previously made. Although the photogmphs covered an urea 120 miles long and over a mile wide, the land nrea aetnull~· coyered totahid only 83 square miles. The total cost of this work, includfnl! reduction to chart form, is about one-third the estimated cost of a plane-table reYision of the same area. · Tl1e coast of New Jersey is covered by four charts. The aerial survey cor· rections are being applied whenever new editions of these charts are found necessary. One of the charts is alrE'ady heing issued with the corrections on, while two others are in process of correction. , In Murch an officer of this Bureau was detailed to represent the Coast and Geodetic Survey in u cooperative aerial snne~· of the Mississippi River Delta. The aerial photography was done by the Naval Air Service, the Corps of E1igineers· ft1rnished equipment for the handling of the plane while at anchor and In tlle river, and also assisted in the location of the control points; while this Bureau determined the location of tho control points. South and Southwest Passes were photographed at an altitude of 5,009 feet, in order to furnish information for the constructing engineer. The remainder of the work wns clone from nn altitude of 8,000 feet.

REPORT OF DIRECTOR, CO.AST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Office work on these photographs was in progress at the end of the year. The Delta of the Mississippi is a lpcality where aerial phototopograpl1y has a ~arked advantage over other metho:ls of surveying. It is a marshy area, a regwn of no relief, and covered with a rank growth of vegetation consisting chiefly of wild cane, which grows to a height of 12 feet or more. It can be readily seen how the engineer would be hampered iu trying to make a topographic survey by ordinary methods. The work was discontinued early in May, ana will be again taken up in the fall of the year, when it is expected to complete the Delta. It is expected that the final results of this phototo1Jographic survey will be a strong argument in its favor in this type of terrain, especially as regards cost and completeness of topographic detail. The importance of aerial views other than those made purely for mapping purposes should not be underestimated. Oblique views often furnish valuable information to the cartographer, and they also assist in the compilation of the Coast Pilot. '.l'he Air Services have been reauested to furnish this Bureau with copies of aerial views that might be of vali:ie. Considerable use was made of miscellaneous views during the year, especially along the Florida coast. A new stereoscope is being designed for this Bureau by the Bureau of Standards. Arrangements were made in the latter part of the year to have this instrument constructed, as a stereoscope is a very valuable aid in the interpretation of aerial photographs. Arrangements were made with the Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, to obtain from them a transformer for the rectification of tilted photographs. An officer of this Bureau was engaged during the past year in the study of aerial photosurveying, but almost all his time was taken up by the development of the practical side. During the latter part of the year a computer was assigned to devote part of his time to a study of the theoretical side. Assistance was furnished to the Board of Surveys and Maps, through the Committee on Photographic Surveying, in the compilation of the comprehensive report on Aerial Photographic Surveying. The results of the past year's work on this subject demonstrate the advantages of aerial phototopography quite clearly. A.long the coastal plain of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts this metllo'.1 bas a marked advantage over the old' ns regards time, cost, and minuteness of detail. '.rhe value of the photographs as historical records should not be overlooked. The topographic sheet contains certain specified data, 'vhile the photograph records everything visible.

Under instructions issued June 15, 1921, an:1 after conference with the officer in charge of the Anacostia Radio Compass Station, the necessary stations in the tertiary triangulation were recovered and occupied for the purpose of locating the position of the Anacostia Radio Compass Station. No expense was incurred in the execution of this work.

(EARL 0. HEATON.] SUMMARY OF l!.ESULTs.-Triangula.t!on: 1 station recove:t'ed, 2 stations determined.

In March, 1921, request was made by Lieut. Waikhart, U. S. Navy, for certain work in connection with the torpedo firing line on the lower Potomac River. The expenses of this work were met by the Navy Department, which furnished quarters, subsistence, and transportation to the observer. The work done was the reestablishment of the forwurd range mark at the 8,000-yard point. This mark was supposed to have been destroyed but was recovered by use of the refe1·cnce mark. In addition to this work several range signals were built and two line buoys were located, one at the firing point and one at the 4,000-yard point. A tug and a 40-foot launch were used during the work for the transportation of the observer.

[CHARLES SHAW.]

At the beginning of tbe fiscal year work was under way on the triangular speed trial course for airplanes in the vicinity of Hampton, Va., which had been undertaken at the request of the Navy Department. This work was finally completed in the early part of August. Between August 5 and 24 the observer was engaged in establishing points by triangulation at the mouth of the Piankatank River as mentioned in another abstract.
SUMMARY OF RESULTS -Triangulation, tertiary: 7 square miles of. area covered; 3 signal poles erected; 1 observing tripod and scaffold built, height1 85 feet; 6 stations in main scheme occupied for_ horizontal measures; 4 geographic positions determined.

August 5 and 24, 1920, two triangulation stations, Boss and Cherry, were established and determined at the mouth of the Piankatank River for use as base stations for all future surveys required in the river, the old station marks having been washe«;]. away. · To make station Boss 1;1ermanent it was necessary to place it just inside a wood and to construct a double scaffold 85 feet high to see Windmill Point Lighthouse over the trees along Stingray Point. The triangulation was done at the request of the Commission of Fisheries of the State of Virginia for use in its surveys of oyster beds In the Plankatank River.

Between July 11 and 22, 1921, determinations were made by triangulatioa of the geographic positions of the Naval Radio Compass stations at Poyners Hill, N. C., Hog Island, Va., and Virginia Beach, Va., and an azimuth was determined at each station. . For this purpose stations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey triangulation were recovered and occupied. The compass station at Poyners Hill is located about 50 meters northeast of Coast Guard Station No. 169. The latter it was found had been moved about a mile to the southward of the position shown on the charts. The compass station at Hog Island is located in the yard of the Coast Guard station on the southern end of Hog Island, and is about 75 meters northeast of the Coast Guard station. This station was occupied eccentrically. The compass station at Virginia Beach is located in the yard of Coast Guard Station No. 162 and about 20 meters north of the Coast Guard station.

In April and May, 1921, the positions of the Naval Radio Compass stations at· Point Reyes, Bir? Island, Farallon Islands, and Montara Point, Calif., were determined by officers detached for that purpose from the Natoma. At each station an azimuth was determined.
[FREMONT MonsEl.] SUMMARY oF RESULTS.-Trlangulatlon: 26 signal poles erected; 32 stations in main scheme occupied for horizontal measures ; 28 geographic positions determined.

During the period between March 9 and April 27, 1921, the positions of 6 Naval Radio Compass stations located along the California coast from San Diego to Point Arguello were determined by triangulation. Those connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey triangulation were Imperial Beach, San Diego; Point l;oma, San Diego; Avalon, Catalina Island; Point Fermin, San Pedro; Point Hueneme, Ventura County.; and Point Arguello, Santa Barbara County. At San Diego and Hueneme transportation in motor cars was provided by the.naval authorities. At Point Loma, in order to connect with the triangulation, it was necessary to luy out a scheme involving three quadrilaterals with

short sides. At this station a meridian mark was established south of the radio compass as far away as the topography would permit. At Imperial Beach the compmis station is located on the ocean shore west of the southern limit of San Diego Bay. In order to connect with the triangulation it was necessary to go as far up the bay as National' City on the east side and Marsh Point on the west side. After the triangulation had been computed a meridian mark was set south from the compass instrument. In the reconnoissance for this triangulation the old station Field was recovered. At Avalon, Catalina Island, it was found owing to local conditions which deflected the wireless WO.Yes and rendered the radio compass bearings unreliable, the station had been dismantled a.nd abandoned. For this reason the position of this station was not determined. · · At Point Fermin; San Pedro, it \Yas necessary to dete1;mine a new triangulation station, located at the end of the point and about in line with the middle of the two windows of the compass house. Here the compass house is hot oriented north and south, and it was decided not to set. a mericlian· mark, since in testing the adjustment of the circle of the compass it would be far more convenient to sight from the station, which could be seen. from the windows, rather than from a meridian mark from which the· instrument could not be seen. At·.Point Hueneme, Ventura County, there was a lack of triangulation points in the immediate vicinity, and in order to make connection it was necessary to make use of a long line, Laguna to Point Hueneme Lighthouse. Laguna is one of the primary points and is about 9 miles from the lighthouse. Two new stations were established near the lighthouse and an elongated quadrilateral observed. From one of the stations of this quadrilateral located so as to see through the windows of the compass house the distance and azimuth of the compass instrument were mea·snred. Here also the compass house is not oriented north and south, and no meridian mark was set. At Point ArgueHo, Santa Barbara. County, two old triangulation stat;ions established in 1874, were recovered, and from the line joining them the positiotj of the radio compass station was determined. At this stntion a meridian mark was established. · The Point Arguello Lighthouse had not been connected witll'the triangulation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and advantage was taken of this opportunity to make the connection.

[T. J'. MAHER, Commanding Steamer Survovor.]

In February, 1921, determinations were. made by triangulation of the geographic positions of Naval Radio Compass stations on Puget Sound, and true meridian lines were laid out for m;e in connection therewith by two officers detailed for the purpose from the steamer Surveyor. At Smith Island a metal reference marl{ was set in concrete in the light keeper's yard. It marks true north and is about 110 meters from the radio . compass. . . . At Cattle Point two monuments were set in a true westerly direction from the radio compass, one a. nail in cement in the top of a pipe set in concrete 5 meters from the radio compass, and the other a meta.I reference mark set in cone crete 14 meters west from the radio compass. At New Dungeness tl. reference mark was set in concrete about 150 meters east of the radio compass station. The stations are calibrated by setting a transit on the top of the radio compass house and setting it to read true azimuths from north, and a .vessel then sends wireless signals from near the center of the area to be covered by the radio compass. The transit and radio apparatus read the azimuth of the vessel, and the radio circle is rapidly set to agree with the compass. The vessel then steams as nearly' around the radio compass as possible, and simultaneous readings are taken with the transit and radio apparatus ; from these a correction table or curve ifi made for the radio compass readings. In determining the positions of the radio compass stations, three direct and reverse directions 'vere observed and the horizon dosed where practicable. '' . ' Smith .Island and Cuttle Point radio. compasses were computed as part of the quadrilateral from Smith Island Lighthou~e and New Dunge,ness Lighthouse..

New Dungeness is computed from three triangles, the buses being New Dungeness Ughthouse-Smith Island Lighthouse, New Dungeness LighthouseDiscovery Island Lighthouse, and Smith Island Lighthouse-Discovery Island Lightpouse. When at New Dungeness radio compass obse1Tations were also made on Ediz Hook Lighthouse. At Slip Point three triangulation stations were found, no two of which are intervisible and from only one of which the radio compass is visible. A new station was selected on a tide reef from which all three of the stations named and the radio compass are visible. This station was marked with a metal triangulation mark set in rock below high water. Slip Point is located from the new station and station Reynolds. Slip Point Lighthouse was observed, but the new station was not visible at the stage of the tide at the time. Tatoosh radio compass is located by a single triangulation. Tatoosh Lighthouse station mark was found in good condition, but Tatoosh radio compass is not visible from it.
