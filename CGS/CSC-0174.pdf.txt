LOCATION O F BASE LINE, MARKINGS, > : T O .

The prilr~ary b:~seline in liipley County, Tlid., laid out by my party in October and November, 1890, was located on tlie high and nearly land between the Qwns of Holton nlld New Marion. Its level t t l ~ l e lerigth is 5,500 metres, and its direction is nearly north and south. Tn order to avoid the creelc near its north cud, it was swung to the west.w&d fkolri a true 11ort11 and south line. North base is in Otter Creek Township, :~bont 1lnile east of Holton, on the Ohio and Mississippi Itailroad. South base is in Centre Townal~ip, and about half a mile ~ ~ o r t of l ithe village of New Marion. Tlie underground and surface ~narks placed to secure the ends of the base after the completion of the me:isurements mere as shown in the ;lccoinpanying sketch (illustmtion No. 30). The sub-surfitce niark was ;I col)per bolt, set in :i liutestone post (i inclles squarc atid 2 feet lol~g, whicli was sur~liill the earth till its top mas 3 feet below tho surfitcc?. A t tlre i~~tersectioli of crosli lilles cut on the top of t l ~ e bolt, a fine l~olu one-qu:trter of an iuch deep was drilled to mark the st,atioll point. Above and eronnd the post, exceljt for it space of 1h o t scluarc immediately over it, is a Ii~yer of l'ortlan(1 celtient co~lcretc1foot thick and 4 feet square. Upon this fouudntion rests a block of li~nestorle 3 feet square :bud 30 inchea high; having a copper bolt wit11 cross and fiue drill hole sunk into its top a t tlie centre, this hole being the surface mark of the end of the base. To protect tliese snrfttco m:~rks from injury ahd to indicate conspicuously the ends of the base, limestone shafts were placed in position over them. The one a t Xorth Base had inscriptions on three of its faces, as sliown in the illnstration, and tho one a t South Base was sirnilel-ly mttrkd. All of tlle lbreparations ibr the :ictnal measurement were conipleted early in June, 1891. These iuclnded the clearir~gof the line, the fencing of the camp ground, tho pitching of tllc t e ~ l t s twenty-two in ]lumber, the constrnotiol~ of R co~nparillg house wit11 railroad aud track 110 metres long, tile settii~g of posts fbr rnicl.oscopcs, :bud the detennination of the height of North Base above see level by leveli~~gs to the warest bel~ch ]nark of the transcol~tinentul line of geodetic leveling.

J3efore the base apparatus arrived iiom Wasliington, seotion 'stonos were eet a t 1,200, 2,100, 3,000,.4,000, aud 5,000 metres from South Base and carefully aligned. Stones were also seit a t 3,900, alid 4,900 metres to 111arlr the ends of the kilometro intended to be nie:~sured with the standard bar eucasetl iii ice. These section stones were cnbic:\l blocks of liwstolre, 1foot in each dimension, aud set in beds of coiicro& It inches square and 15 inches deep. I 1 1 the top of each stone was secured a copper bolt, 1iilcll in diameter atid 3 inches loug, with a fiue cross cut on its head. The levels ruu alolrg the line from Nortli Base to South 132ue rn:rde e:~c]iof these suction stales ~t belicli mark well dekr~ni~recl iu height above sea level. The comparing ]louse, wit11 milrond uud t r w k 100 lrretrev loug, and posts for microscopes, was finished.
BEGINNING AND PROGRESS OF THE MEASUREMENTS.

On July 37,1891, tlie jnstru~llontswero unpacked and propareci for and on the 28th a Inenswork, by Assistants Tittlnaun anti Woodiv~trti, uremelit of the base was bogtun by ~ s s i s t a n 'Jittmnnn t at A ,- Soutli Base. His p:~rtyconsisted of 4 officers, beside himself, and 4 men, and tliey mero employed for thirteen :vrd one.13alf days in making two co111,plete measure$ of tlie base, besides t w o additional measures of tho kilometre, betweeu storres a t 3,900 alld 4,900 metres from Sontll Base, 1;~id out to be rnoasured by tlie standard bar in ice, the second mens1u.o having been finished on August 13. During this time Assistant Wooelward, assisted by Mr. Siebert a l ~ d one or two hm~ds, was elrg:lged io expcrilne~its with iced b:~rcu~d ty)es \ ill tlio comparing liousc. 0 x 1 'August 14 he began settiug posts on the ltilohetre for sapporting tho portable track, ant1 the ~nicroscopes, using id1 of the availi~ble force of' laborers. Owing to contiiiual r:~iirs,tlio ground was saturated with moisture and the worlr was much delayed. Stakes for supporting tho tape cl~irirlg moasuremout wero also set, a t 10 rlietres apart, the wholo lerlgtli of the base line by Assistant Woodmard, and some parts of tlre . line mere made ready for tape measurement, and on Ailgust 2S,29, mid 31, and September 1and 2, measurements were made by officers alone, and on September 8,16, 17,' IS, 23, and 28, and October 1, 8, 3, 7, and 8, lneasurements mero made, usually a t night, mitli a full force of officers and men.

ICED BAR APPARATUS ON STANDARD KILOMETRE OF HOLTON BASE.

Descriptiotb o f Iced Rnr Base rlp]tco.cit 11s. bert, mho verified all of tlie prelirniiiary c;ilculatiol~srcl;ltiro to tho stability and efi3ciency of the npp:rratus, and who c1:tbor;tted inauy of the designs and mado most of the worliilrg dralviugs for its ooustruction. I am particularly indebted also to Mr. E. G. Fisclrer, chief mechanician of the Survey, whoso kliowlcdpe of and skill in mcclianicaI appliauces were frequently appealed to. Finally, i t :~ffordsme pleaswlio lias I1ad oxtoiisi~o ure to state tliat my friend; Mr. E. S. NTl~ecler, cxl)crience with base apl)nratus, happcncci to visit Washington about tlre time the plal~s for thi8 apparatus \vcr.o cornplcted, : L I I ~g:/vo 1110 tlrc I)cnefit of his :idvice and oriticislu. ( 3 ) Gewwal feat?~res of u ~ ~ p ( ~ r ~ ~ t ~ ~ iced-bar s . - T l ~aly)ar:~tus o belongs to tli:tt type in which il siilglu rigid bar is used as tliu clenierit of langth, long with micrometer ~uicroscol>es to mark its successivo positions. A11 idea of tho iiature of' the apparatus may ho gained from il11istr:itlous 31 and 33. The first of these shows tho apparatus as used on tbo 1 0 ~ 1 coinparator of Holton base, described a t length in section 2, Ch:~ptor 111. Tlie otl~erplate shows the apparatus as used 011 the star~d:lr(l liilometre of tlio same base. It will be seen that tho measuring Bar is carried in n trough, whore it cau be kopt surrouncled by ruelti~~g ice. This trough is ~nounted on two cars, which lnovo on traclis, stationary or portable, as the case may be. The microscopes, ns shown in tlre illustr:~tions,are mouiiteil on wooden posts, which w e raligecl out mid set firnhy in the grourid beforoh;tid. This sort of support for the microscopes, though not essel~tial to tlie apparatus, is co~ivonient and ecolioiirical tlvllen a sorics of moasures of the same line is to bo made. Tlre nlicroscopes are easily clamped ti^ and detached from the posts, aud aro moved forward as tho measure of a line progrosscs. The trough carryiug the bar and ice load is liliowiso easily rolled forward on tho cars illong the tracks. The apparatus is f i l l L long, SO that the microscope posts :ire set 5"' apart. Tho supports for the car tracks are also sot 5"' apart, but :ire l~laceclhalf way betweell the lnicroscope posts, so as to avoid tr;lnsmitting disturbance fo the latter through the ground. As shown in illustration Wo. 31, the apl)aratus on the 10On1 colupar:ttolU was protected from the direct rays of the sun by a shed. For fieldworlr, on the other hand, tlie microscopes wore sliielded by nicnun of Iitrge nmbrollas, as shown in illustration No. 33. Tlie gcr~cral ibatures of the apparatus are thus appal.cnt, axit1 wc i11uy proc.cc(1to deucribn its parts in detail. (3) I T l c c ~ t~teasurin!~ bay.--Tlre measuriug bar of this :~ppai-;~tns is :I rect;l~~gul;tr bur of tire steel. It was rolled in tho stoel 1vor1;s a t L ~ I I thick, and 32'""'deop.

li~ics are ruled on each of these plugs, two in the directio~~ of and olio transverse to the lengtli of the bar. 'l!l~esclines were ruled by Mr. Louis A. Fischer, adjuster in the Office of Standard Weights and Mcasnres. The lo~~gitudinal lines, which serve to limit the parts of the transverse lines used, are 0.2111111 apart. Although great pains were take11 to liuve

tllcsc lines of tlie same width, the transverse lines clifler widely, the narrower one being 18.3"and the broa.der one 36.2' wide. This bar is 1;nown in the Survey records 21s KO. 17. It is dosignated iii all tlie work done with i t t l ~ n s far as BIT. Tho end having tlie narrower transverse graduation iuark is called the A end.

Tliiv trough is called the Y-trough by reitsoti of the rcselnblance of its crosfi section to the letter Y. Tho drawing sho\rs a cross sectiop of tllis trough. It is made of two steel plates 3.14"' lolig, 2T,.tic" wide, ' i~nd 3111111 thick. Tl~ey are bent to the nuglc I3 C D of'tlie tigure, and are riveted together as shown a t X, thus ~nirliiilg the angle of tlio trough B C F= GOO. The bar, sho\vn in cross s c c t i o ~ :tt ~A ; is s11l)porteda t every Ilalf metre c ; f its length by saddles, ollc of wliicli is sliow~iin tlie figure. .Theso saddles are rigidly ;ittached to the sides of the trougli by screws a t 8, S. Each saddle carrias oue vc,rtic:tl nut1 t\vo 1:~teraladjusting screws as show11 a t V, L, L'. Those scrows servo to fix the aligl~lnont of the bar. The lateral adjustilly screws of the snddles a t the e l ~ d s of tho bar are of the gamo lioight, which is equal to that of tho lower screw 11' of the diagram.

For covering the ends of the bar a small quantity of ice is cut mith a jack plaue. Ice t111is cut, like wet snow, packs well and permits making a small co~rieal hole through it to the graduation plugs. A very esselltial auxiliary to tlle use of' the apparatus is an iccc:r~~shor t;o pulverize tlle ice, The machine used is a modification of t.hc Creasey ice breaker luauufactured a t Philadelphia, Pa.

T l ~ e forltler requisite is feet are !)9c8l1 ap;trt? SO that they reach secured by a stridiug level ~vhose from any plug to the second adjacent plug.

The probable error of n bisection is less tlian 41". Wl~ile the bar is in position under tho microscopes, the third observer measures the tlistanco of the front end (and the rear end :tt starting) of the axis nf the bar from the reference line, and adjusts the sectorlevel bubble to ccnter, tnliirig caro a t tho samo time to keep away from the microscope posts when the bar is observed.

(1) Dcscriptioa o f uppn~at 1 u n~z (7 vlethod.-Tlie most iniportant opcmtion atteniling the use of tho iced-biir i?l)p;~ratns is the cletermiuatioii of tho length of tlis ~ne:isl~rii~g bar ill tcarins of o ~ l c of tlic I~itcrr~iktioiial l'rototyl)o Metres. Tlre ge~ieri~l 1)l;in \~lli(:i~ has bee11 followed in tliu execution of this operation is tlli~t 01. direct comparison of tho bar i ~ ~ i c l l'rototype Metre, each beilig paclrcd in nlcltii~g ice. Accordi~ig to this plan tlie nse of therrnolncters is dispcliscd with entirely. It suffices of five tinies tlie lengtl~ of the nietre when simply to measure a dista~ico paclted in n~eltingice, and thou tr:~nsfer this distn~rce to tho 5"' bar Packed in n~clting ice. Tho meaus available for such n~orlia t tlie tinie the apparatus was co~istructedwere tlio oilice conipamtor and cowparii~groom. The lattcr is an ~uiclergro~uld roo111 situateti betwcen tho front of tlio Survey building and tlio at1,j:icclit street. The comparator co~isists of an iron I-bean1 about 6.5"' long, supported a t its ends or1 brick piers. Between tlicse piers ~iiicroinet,cr ~nicroscopes can be att:lolied to the beam a t any dcsired interval up to 6 metres. For supporting the bars under coma t right angles to the I-beam is provided. The parison, a car ~noviug car rails rest on piers well removetl from those supporti~ig the beam. The bo~nparing room is liglitud by electric lights n~hich can be placed in any convenient position for illuminating or reading tlio microscopes. For tho special comparisons in question six micrometer ~i~icroscopes \Yere attaclied to tlio I-beam a t intervals of 1metre. The means of attachment were cast-iron brackets whicli could be rigidly clnniped to the beam, mliile the microscopes themselves mere fastened to the shelves of tlio brackets. Tlio brackets aro adjustable on the beam; so that the foci11 planes of tlie microscopes car1 bo brought into the samo horizontal 1)1:rnc, very nearIy, and tlie axes of the microscopcs made vertical witliin narrow limits. The microscopes in turn are provided with lateral adjustments on tlie shelves of the brackets. Hence the optical :me8 of the microscopes can be brought into one vertical plane, very llcarly, and tlie distances betmeon co~~socutive axes can be 111:ldeclosely equal to 1metre. Tho microscopcs used in J 1 determinations of tlie lc~lgtli of tlie iced bar KO. 1 7 aro Nos. 5 and G of the Survey and Nos. 1,8,3, :tnd4 of the ltepsold base apparatus loaned to the Survey by tlie Corps of Engiiieers, u. 9.

microscol)es were placcd in the i11ternlet1i;~te positions. Thcsc latter microscopes have each about 3"" lateral nlotion by ~ i i c : ~ ~ of' i sa fine screw, so that their axes coul(1 be easily put in line with tho :~xes of the end microscope a t any time. This ad.justluelit was ,acco~nplishecl by bringirlg a fine thread well stretched to focus under tho terminal microscopes and then moving tlie iritermediate microscope till thcir axes were coincider~t with the thread. The error of tliis adjustmcrlt has never exceeded 0.2mm. The held illurniliation of the microscopes was secured by glass prisms attached in front of the microscopa objectives. Light nras thrown into the prism and thence to the objcct observed by means of lonses in h n t of tho illuminating lamps. I n making comparisons the 5" bar B,, was mounted in its Y-trougl~, iced, and aligr~edin the manner already described. The trough was supporbd on its lifting jacks, which rested on tho comparator car. Tiio metre used was Prototype No. 21. It was mounted in a woodcn box whose interior dopth, breadth, and length are ll.Oc"',12-5C111, and 115.0c811, respectively. It was supported byligllt brass suspension hooks attxched to wooderl crosspieces which rested on tho sides of the box. Tho hooks woro placed a t distances of 2OCn from the ends of tho metre. In pack. ing the metre for comp~risons it was completely surrounded to a depth of Geln to 80mby a luixtilre of ice pulverizocl in the ice crusher and 1)y tlie snow-lilte particle8 cut with a jack plano. These finer particles could bo crowded into the grooves of the bar (wlrich has an X cross section) so that tho ice would be in actl~al contact wit11 t l ~ e surface of t l ~ bar e througliout it^ longth. After thus covering the inotre co111I~lctcly'smnllholes were maclo through tho snow paclring a t thc ends of'tl~e box down to the graduated surf'accs, which mero tllc only I,-:u.ts ot' the netr re exposeci to the external air. To remove contlensecl noi istllre, which is sometimes tronblesome, from these polishecl surfilccs, a (11.ycamol's hair brush was found very effective. The upper surfi~ve of tho ice pack and the sides of the box were protected by a heavy felt wrapping, tlirougll which small holes wore cut over the grad11 il t' 1011 a r . The box was provided with 3-foot scrcws which stood OII platcs of glass resting on the platform of the conlparator car. These h o t scrcws served to bring the ends of tho metro to focns under the I I I ~ I * I , O scopes, the requisite lateral and longitudinal adjustmeutR being sccnrctl by sliding the box on its foot screws on the smooth glass. To pack tho 5 m bar 40 to 45 kilogrammes of ice were used, and 10 to 12 kilogrammes to pack the metro. Tho ice was renewed a t intervals of' twenty to forty minutes, but the melting was generally very slight during guch intervals. Assuming constancy of temperaturo of tho bars under coulpari 4011, tho procision of the lncthod just ontlined evidently depends or' the stability of the microscopes nsed. The first soriev of comparisons, made in July, 1891, indicated marked instability of tho ~uicroscopes;and several 6eries made during February to May, 1892, rondored it certain

I t s use for tho carlier cleterminations of the longth of tlie iced bar was snggesteci by considerations of econowy, : ~ n d it was hoped tli;~t with ca~eful manipulittion it would answer the purpose. The no st importaut result, Iiowtlver, of this carlier work was a domonstr:ttion of thc iieccssity of' a clitferollt sort of c:on~parrttor. The defects of the office oolnpari~tor for our 1)tiryose 111aybe ascribed ollicfly to the Inode of rnountiug the microsaopcls. Beiug attached :ls ex1)l;bined ;~bove by means of brackets clanlpcd to tllo I-beam, their focal planes fa11 a t a distarlce of about 0.5"' belolv the beam.

Besting as the bean1 tlocs \\.it11 the friction duo to its weight on the piers, it is ill general ill i1 state of loilgitudinal tress, which is frcquelitly reliovod by vibrations communicated to the piers by vuhicles passing in tho adjilcelit street.

In souie i~istaiiccs, also, in these later tletorn>inatio~is but olle measure of D was mado in the pli~co of (3) :111d(4). I n a11 cletermirlatio~is of length the obscrvationcj of tlie two eiids of Dl, and J12, were made sirnnlta~ieoi~sly by two diKerent observers. The observers :tlso in every case excllarigcd positioll~immeiliately and read on the opposite ends of tile bars, ill order to elilni~late persoual equation, in fro fhr as elimination can be acco~nplishedby snch interchange. I n measuring the distauce betnrcon the terminal microscopes of tho comparator with Jlzl care miis taken to make tlie depcrldence on tho low-power internledinte ~nicroscopessrn:tll by confining tho measirl each case. Tlle srnall inequalities ures with them to a few ~nicrons in heights of the focal plarles of tho microscopes were measured by observing the inclination of a suitably dolicate level tube attached to allwlie~itlie latter was brought to focus under the microscopes. ltcpeated observi~tionsby this ~nctliodgave accurate corrections for such iuequ:ilities. (.?.) (;omnpz6tation o f length o f Bli.-The metl~ocl. of deriving the length of 7jI7 from the observations mill depend iu general on the hypothesis wo adopt with respect to the motions of the microsoopcs. The ~ ~ u l n bof er 11yl)otlieses available, is restricted, also, by tlie number of observations. Ignoring for tlie moment the displacelnent of tho i?tormdiato microscopes, arid considering the secontl programme of the preceding section, we rriay suppose, for example, first, that tllo difitance D between tho zeros of the terminal microscopes remains invariable from the t i & ? of (1)to tlie time of (6); fiecoud, that U varies uniformly with tho time from (1) to (6); third, that D varicqunitornily a t a rate 21, say, from (1) to (3), aud ul~ifornllya t a rate z2 froin (4) to (6); fourth, that D varies a t a rate z 2wt from (1) to (G), z mid t o bciiig constants and t the tinle bcgin~iiiig with (1). All tliese hypotheses \\7eretried in compi~ting the results of tlio observations of February and March, 1892, niado according to the IllOrG elaborate programme given above. The rcsidu:ds bro~rght out by these processes wcrc, however, far greater than could bo :tttributcd to errors of thc ol~scrvatio~isl class, and they showctl clcilrly that the snl)positiorlb were rarely in accord with tlio facts. T11c rensou for this lack of accortl is that the processes do not take adequate account of the irregnlar lilotio~is of the ~nial.oscopes,and especially of tlic inter~nccliate microscopes. It docs ]lot seem worth ~vlrilc, tliercfbro, to set dowli a11 the fon~lulns w1lic.h resldt from tho ;ibuve sii~~~~ositioris and \vliich were trictl as stated. It m:~ysufiice to give those del)erident 011 the fourth su~)])osi. tion. We observe, first, that thc measures (1) and (0) and (2) ancl (3) u7eren l i ~ d at ~ eqnnl il~tel.vals,respectively, from the observations (3) :l11d (4). The latter two \\.ere made so near together that thcy 11iay be considered nimultaricous.

Considering errors of observlttio~lalone, i t appci1rs from the first of equations (2), section 3, that tliey slionld give to :t single determination of x in Table 1 1a probable error of I E d 45, where E is the probable error of a single lnicroscope rending. Tlie value of e does riot exceed Od", so that the probable error of a single valric of x due to errors of' observation is less than I0.8". Since the total probable error of a si~lglu valuo of x in Table 11 is, as given above, -J 3.GF, the reason for dirocti~~g sttontiou to other sources of error than those of ob~ervatiou is evidel~t. % h 's i view of the inquiry was reaclled long before the series of tletcrllli~~atiolln co~iilcnsed in Table I1 was completed. During the progreex of tllis worlr, in fact, 1~1ai1y experim~ntswere lnacle with the Ilo])c of locating the 1:~rgersolirccv of error and devising means for theil. c?liniination or eorrcction. Thns, (a),dc1ic:tte levels were attached to the brackets of tlie terminal microscopes of the comparator.

1,cwgtk oj' Iced fi'ar.S,,. (LO) So?rrcc~ o f error.-The principal sourc:cs of error to which the resnlts in Tables IT1 ant1 subjcct are: (a) those of observation, and (c) those due to flex(b) those due to instability of the ~uicroscopes, ure of Blo. The results involve the aggregate e&ct of these three sources, but ~t is practicable to estimate their separate effects. This we now proceed to do. The quantities q in equations (1) and (2) of section 8 are of the form q=+(R,+Rln -Ra-RIJ, where R,, R1,, and R,, Ria denote the microscope readings a t the north and south ends respectively of MZ1 or of a sub-space of B I D , as the case ]nay be. Hence if r is the probable error of a single microscope reading, the 1)robable error of q due to this source alone is also E ; and i t follows from the first of cquatiolis (2), section 8, that the probable error

are

of a single determination of z, is

r

4 : .

The vdlue of r, as slioali by

Hence the probnblo error of a direct observation, is less than 0.5'. ~iligle value of xidue to errors of observatiou alone is less tllali 0.5'. The assumption adopted in computing the values of the sub-spaces on B,, is that tho interval between the zeros of tho pair of microscopes used in determining any space changed uniformly with tlie ti1110 rcqliired to ~llake the observations. If this i s not a true assumption, or if tho microscopes mere subject to largo irregular displacerne~lts, we should expect to find the probable errors of the quarit~tics q a n d xi derived from the residuals v of e q u a t i o ~ ~ (I), s section 8? larger than those given under (a) above. Such is, in fact, the case. It is essential to observe here that errors clue to flexnro of BI,, or c11:lnges in length of the ~ub.spaces, if they were a t all formidal)le, did ~ i o appear t in the residuals v of the equation8 used. Such changes c i ~ l only occur slowly, from dity to day, or during longer pe~*iotls, since tlicy are primarily due to the change in slrapo of the Y-trough, which is :~tTected only by marked changes of the surrounding air temperature. The tirne required to ~nalte a set of observations in n comparison of H2, with a sub-space was only 6 t o 8 minutes. It appears yritctically curtaiu, t8herefore, that tho residuals brought out in the colnputatiol~ illvolve only the two sources (a) and (b). I n the 90 determinations of t,he 5 sub-spacestllero were 450 residuals :ind 270 unknowns, as sl~ownby the forlnulas (1) and (2) used in tho oom1)utntion. The sum of the squares of tllose residuals is 351.4, tho unit being a micron. Hence if el denoh the probable error of a single observed value of o, -, -3,514- = L 0.6745J G j i 2 7 a = 1.3'' ; whence --

alld that the corresponding value for x,is only slightly less. An examination of the individual residuals of tho diti'ereiit sets of rate of change observations indicates that the assuinption of n coi~stant iuterval mas frequently not realized. I n tlio entire of a micro~cope llun~ber of residuals thcre were twenty wliose values rose to or exceeded %", while six exceeded 3", the maxilmun~ being 3.7 These large residuals, i t is believed, are due tfi sudden disl~lacome~it~ of tlie microscopes. to exp1:iili them, ~znless it be No other hypotliesis appears con~petcnt that of sudden changes in temper:~tureof the bars nnder comparisoi~. The above probable error of 2 x I ,or the pr01)able error of one determination of the length of XI, is & 2.7". Tllo corresponding v:llnc for :I single determination of R17 by the direct process, as givcn in section 6, is 43.6". Hence i t would appear tllat the process of getting tlie entire length of B,, mas subjcct to consitlerably lcss error than the direct determination of B,,. The group means in the last colulnl~ of Table I11 indicate a progresfiive change in tlie length of B18 during the series of comparisons, which extended from April 25 to May 10, 1892. Tlie cause of this change, if real, is import;lnt, Rlrd much stndy was give11t o it.

range of 8" would be accounted for by errors of opposite signs no greater than four times this probable error, but the probitbility of snc.11 :11i explanation is too small to be satisfactory. Hence we proceed to osnn~inethe question of the effect of flexure of Bls on its observed Ie11gt11. Silice the surfaces of the intermediate graduatioi~plugs of TI,, are not in tlie neutral surface of the bar, any change in it8 curvature will tend to disphcc the fiducial lines on those intermediate plugs. This source of diaculty ma8 anticipated, and the lncasures of the flexure wit11 the long striding level, as already explained, mere ])lade for the porpose of supplying any liecdcd correction. It is obvious that no considerable variation in the wiiole incl:isnred Icngt,h of B,, could occur except through large cliangos in its ourvotu~.i.--such,for example, as n change from marked concavity upwards to marked convexity up\vttl.ds.

The level was a.lways reversed in observing the relative heights of adjacent plugs; and as the timo required to make such a measure was less than t w ~ minutes, the observed quantities are subject to no important errors.

Tl~cseoon~lcctio~is were also very rigid; ailtl the great wcight of the pierfi :bud foulld:ttioii, ~ v h i c lwere ~ virtually one Inass, gave a very satisfactory degree of st;ibility.

The measures with the metre started alternately from the west and east ends of tlie co~nparator. Tho micrometric readings on either bar were made simult:t~leouslyby the two observers, who exchanged positions in every case to elinlinato personal equation. Srnnll distances, amounting to a few microns only, mere measured with tho intermediate Bepsold microscopes, whose magnifying powers are but twenty-seven diameters, mliile the torminal microscopes 5 and 6 have a power of flfty diameters. The measures with R,, were nlnde in the manner described a t length jn section 10 of Chapter I. Tliat is, tlie rear (west) end of the bar was lirst brought t o bisection by means of the car lever, while the bisection a t the front end was made by turning the micrometer screw at'that (east) end. The observers then excliaugcd positions, and the same operation was repeatcd in the roverso order, tho bar being brought to bisectio~i by tlie car lever a t the east end and the micrometer threads moved to bisectioli a t the west end. Two sete of such observations were generally made. Both bars were fully iced from half an hour to an hour before observing on them. A slightly greator quantity of ice was used on both bars than in the previous determinations made during the winter iu the comparing room, where the air b~npernture averaged about 60 C. The during July and August, 1802, when the presaverage air temperi~ture were made, was about 350 C. However, when ent deterrni~iatio~ls protected by the felt covers of the riletre box and Y-trough, the ice did not appear to melt macli fitster tllen it did undcr the far lower winter temperature. Throughout this series of compal.isons tho ice about Bn was shaken up and rul)lenished just before bringiug it under the microscopes for observatious, and tlic prototype was similarly treated a t intervals of twenty to tliirty nrinutes. lprom very careful personal attention to tlle packing of these bars, I am confident that they were subj&t to no sensiblo variations in length due to variations in temperature. The observations were made by Messrs.. John 5. Siebert nnd R. 5. Woodward, and tlie record was kept by Mr. Orville G . Brown. The computations were mado and checlted in all parts by the same parties as the work of observation progressed. (15) Method o f contputntion.-The co~iside~atio~ls on which the method followed in deriving the length of BJ,depends are similar to those set ~ in some respects forth in section 3 above. But since the d : ~ t :were different, i t seems proper to state the present case briefly by itself. If the positions of the microscopes of the comparator remained invariable, or if the measured quantities were aff'ecteti by errors of observation only, the distance D b e t ~ e e u the zeros of tlie termitla1 microscopes would be given by each of the following equations, corresponding i n the several measures of the programme in section 14.

I n these, QI Q2 are tlie lnicrometric quantities resulting from the several measures, and 291 vz.. are tlle correspoliding corrections. But the hypotliesis of collstancy of positioli of the microscopes, or of invkiability of D, is inadequate. It appears, however, fro111the observations, that the assumption of a constant rate of variation of D is quite satisfactory, slid this is tlie one adopted. The time intervals between the several measures (1)(2). (5) are ncarly equal, being about 7.5 minutes each on the average. Hence, if me call x the rate of change of D and put as hitherto

The individual values of x in Table T I 1 1 or IX are, so far as known, of equal weight. The values of x in the two tables difler systematically, however, for reasons given a t lougth in section 20 below. Hence we shall, for the sake of distinction, call the me:m of the adopted values of x in Table VIII, xw,and the mean of Ghose in Table IX, e?,, the sufllxes defining the orientatio~~ of BIT. Tliese means a]-o 2 , = + 2(;.9" & 0.4'' for A-end of west, xe = + 31.3 1 0.4 for A-end of Bl, east. Since x = 5M21- BIT and 5J12,= 5"' + 12.5", these equatio~ls give B,, = 6"' 1 4 . 4 " & 0.4" for A-end mcst, BIT= 5 18.8 0.4 -for A-encf cxst. The probable errors assigned to these rnean values arc derived from the residuals ill the 1ast.colnmns of the tables. TIlus, the sum of the squares of the residuals iu Tablo V I I I is 136.5, arid the corresponding sum from Tabla IX is 118.1. The nntnbor of residual8 is forty and the number of unknowns two. ITence the probnble error of an individual val~ie of x in either table is 1 1.7"; and s i ~ c tlle e weights of x , and xe are each 20, their probable errors are eitc11 equal to & 0.4'.

(19) ~5'ourccs o f accidental error.-Tlio principal accidental errors affecting tho quantities x, y, x of Table VII, and likewise the adopted Values of x in Tables VIII and IX, are, it is believed, errors of observation and errors arising from irregular riloveme~its of the six microscopes of the comparator. An icIea of tho rclative maguitucles of theso two species of error can bc derived in the following manner: Referring t o equatious (I),(2), and (3) of section 15, it is seen tliat the resultant of the errors involved 'in tlie qnantitics Q, 011 wl~icll the values in Tablo VII depend, appears in tllc s ~ u i of ~ s the weighted squares of tho resids very uals given in tho last column of that table. These s ~ m vary greatly for different sets of observatio~~s, but it trustworthy value for the resulta~ltorror lnay bo derived from tho aggregate of the sun18 given in the last column of the table. Omitting tlie values of Jnly 18 and 26 for the reasons assigned in section 18, tlio nggrcgats of the sums is [ p v v = 168.8. The total number of residllalv in tho 40 sets of deternninations is 200, and the total number of dcrivcd valncs of a;., y, z is 120. Thus tho is Probable error of an observed Q of weight unity (or of any Q2or

a)

This applies to a single measure of tlie distnnca betwecn the tcrluinal microscopes with the 5"' bar B,,. Sinco the weighb of aiiy Qi, (I):,, 93, or of a single nieasuro of that s:tnie distance witl~\tlie motro JU,~is 1/5, tho probable error of 0110 such measure is -+ 2.2". Silico the Qpswhich enter the forrnulns of seotioi~ 16 aro indcpendont, it follows that the probable error of a siilgle valuo of x derived by this Process is

This value is only 0.2p loss than tho valuederivocl by a difrerent process in tho preceding section. Tho latter process, it will be observed, takes'account of any changes in the quantities x which 111nyoccur from set to set of observations or from d ~ to y day. Tho close ngreotnont of the two probable errors is, thercfora, an indication tllst such cliauges were small, and a,lso that tho assun~ption on wllicli the method of comPutation dopends is esscntiully correct. An examination of the rcsit1u:tls in Tablo V I I sholvs a satisfactory of rosiduals used, namely, distribution. Thus, of tho wliolo nu~ilber 200, 99 are plus, 03 are minus, and 8 are zero each. Tho mt3~illl~ln residual in the class whoso weigllt is unity is 2.3". The maximum residual in tho class whoso weight is 116 is G . W , wliicI1 is about three times the corresponding probable error, or i 2.Y" as given above. It will be noticed that the [pvv] for the earlier sots of detsrminationr, in July are considerably larger, on the average than for tho lstor sets in August. The only reasons I can assign for this aro, first, that the

Now, :IS to tlie rclatio~i of tlle errors of observation to tho aggreg,ato errors, we n ~ a y :isuumc : ~ s 1litl1ert.o that tlie probable error of a single tloes not, exceed U.5'. The pl-ol)i~ble error from this microscope rcildil~g sonrce, tl~en, i l l ;ui obser\:ctl (J2 or (2, is 0.5', if' we suppose but four reatlings to be made on BIT.

Finally, from \\~h:~tever point of view we regard the aclopted values ' of x in Tables VII I and IX, tllcir :lcuord:l~ice leaves little to be tlcsircd.

J(v vl) in July and August, 1892, vhatever it may have been, was such'as to increase v and decrease v1 by about the same amount. A change of this kind might have occurred in several Drays through as may beseen by referetlce changes iu the eight quantities S,, W,,, to the last two of cqnations (ti); but the dnta do not iudicate that tho change is more likely to have occurred in one of theso ways rather than in anotlier. In view of all the evidence presented in this section, i t appears certain that tho observers assigned different lengths to B17, depending on its ofientation in the Y-trough. It nppcars equally certain that this difference is due to personal equatiou of the observers or to change in aspect of the graduation niarlis, or to both tllcse causes. The two causes are entangled ~vitlione auotlior and can not be separated mitliout additional tlata. We co~iclude, however, that the effects arising frotn these causes are nlell elimiilated in t h e mean of lengths of tlie bar in its two oric~itntions, or that the error of this mean length, expressed is small. by equation ('i), Tlic conclusiori just stz~ted does not require the assu~nption of constancy anit equality of the quantities u and u1 of equations ( 5 ) , but i t seems best to adopt this assumption in deriving tlie liuiil lengths of BIT for A-end left and A-end right. The justification of this view is to be found, I think, in nu exntninatiou of the observed values of * ( u + vl), J (v vl), :ind u + ul, given abovc. Thus tho first of theso qnantities varies by 0.4" only for three different sets of dctermin:~tions extending over half a year's time; tlie second varies by 2.1', and the third by 4 . 0 ~ . With respect to this last, liowever, or to the quantity u + ul, we must rernarlr tliat i t might be expected to vary in observed value much more than the others, since i t colries from data dependent on the st:ibility of all parts of the apparatus, while the other two depend only ou tlie stability of B,, a i d the terlnitial microscopes. But tho cons t a ~ ~ of c yu + u1 in the clcter~ni~iations of July to August, 1892, renders it higl~ly probablo that the value then derived is s real quantity, which was ~nnsked by errors of tho less precise determinations on the offlce comparator.

Lengtl~of Iced Bar B,,.
The probable errors in this table differ videly, but so far as is know11 they are the best available indexes of the prccisio~i of the severti1results. 'In accordance with the conclusio~~s and assumption stated in the Preceding section wo shall dorive t l ~ r e evalues for lengtlk of UI,, namely: First, a lellgtlr for A-end of BIT left; second, a length for A-end of BITright; and, third, a meit11 lellgth, which it is assrunecl will be free from con?tant error. It will be recalled tllat the results of July, 1801, wcro obtained by Tittmann and Woodward, while a11 the rest were obtained by Siebert and Woodward, who used the bar also in tho position A-cud right iu all the work of Holto~lbase. We migl~t, therefore, use the results of 1891 in getting the mean length of B17, but they should be excluded in getting the other lengths. 111 any case, however, it call make but little difference whether wk include or exclude the results of 1801, since the weights we are constrained to adopt amolult practically to the exclnsion of those results, Tho salno rernark aplblies also to the results of the indirect deter~ninations of April and May, 1892, S ~ I I C ~ their weights must be small in colnparison with the weights of the results of the direct determinations. (22)Derivation of lengti~s of B17 in terms of J521.-It is assurned, as already stated, that the length of& observed by Siebert and Woodward is greater or less than its nleau length according as the A-end is left or right by a corlstant wllich wo may denote by 06. I11 conforlnity wit11 this assumption, if BI7denote the ~nean lengtl~ of tho bar, or the length free from systematic error, B17+uwill be t l ~ obsorved e longtlr for A-end left and B,,-u the observed longth for A-euci right. 'The-observed lengtl~s given in Table XI1 aflord ,z series of observation equations from which B17 and 04 may be determined. I n writing these eqnntiolrs the question whether the theoretical weights of the observed quantities should be modified in any way presents itself. using the probable errors of the observed lel~gllls of 1892 as n basis, the weights of these lengths are proportional to the numbers 1, 0.2, and 4. These 'soem to present great disparity, but in view of :ill the considerations set forth in the preceding sections, I am not disposed to less disparity niiglit bensed, change them. Other nuinbers l~resentiug but the resulting values for B17 and urnodd not be much changed thereby. Adopting these theoretical veigllts, tlicn, and writing for brevity, P=B17-61n, the obs,r,,tion equations givoli by the 1.esuIts in Table XI1 become

t,hc sir temperature about the Y-trough varied from 60 to lo0 C., while for the latter gronp tho air temper;itnre varied from 250 to 400 0. If the b:tr is affected to any appreciable extent by tlie external air temperature i t ouglit to have beon longer a t the ti~iic of the second group of colnparisons t11an a t the time of tlic first, since tlie average air temperature for tlir second gronp was liigller by about 300 C. tlinn for the first group. The meall lengtlis for tliosc gro11j)s differ, lio~~~cver, by only l.2s, tllc iildic:;ited Icilgth of the bar being so rnncll shorter a t the Iiigher than at the lower tc~npel~iturc. Jl y conclusion, then, is that tlie bar assulnes a sensibly const:int telnperature wlieli properly iccd in the Y - troa gh The time reqnircd by the bar to reach :t stable length is less th:m ten mil~utes. T11er:iteof temperature ch~l~ipe is so great ill the early stages of freezing that 00 per cent or lllore of the colitr;lt;tion of the bar occurs ~yitliin a i n i ~ ~ nafter t e it is well surroni~tlecl by ice. Tlic correspontling time required by the prototype ~ n e t r c to reach a stable length nppears to be less tlian five minutes, wllich is less than tlic tima required to properly pack i t in ice. In thc use of the npparatiis, however, the bar h:tvc been, in general, fully paclied ill ice from half an hour and ~nctre to an I~our before observing or1 t l ~ e n ~ . A question wliich received atte~ltiouin desigliing the iippar:ltns is whether tlie friction of tlic bar or1 its supports i11 tho Y-trongli may ]lot affect its length appreciably. Siucc the cross sectio~iof tlie b:tr is 2.56 square centimotrcs, and the modulus of elasticity of steel about 2x106 kilogl:;lrnu~es per square ce~ltimetre,i t mould require a longitudinal stress of 1kilogramme to cllailgo the bnr7slength 1 rnicron if the bar mere free to respond to such stress. From this ca1cul:ition and from a consideration of the actual circumst;~l~ces untler nrllicli the bar is used, i t was coilclutled that this f'riction woultl prodnce no appreciable eflBct. Some direct expcrinlcnts to test tliis point were mado, howerer, during the course of tlie con~parisons with tlie PrototypoMetre of February and Bfarcl~, 1802. 111 tl~cse esl)eri~ricnte tllc Y-trough was subjected altarnately ill clnick snccession to tension arid compressio~i while readings were miide on t l ~ c bar. Scvcral such tri:tls were made without disclosing ally cllal~ge in the bar's length. I t is, indeed, tlificult to see Ilow ally frictional stress could ~nanifcstitself, cspecizlly wlien thc? apparatus is truritlled :ilong on its oar8 as ill nieasuri~~g a line or as used 011 tlie new colnparator, since the j ~ r r i n gincident to such rriotiori ought to relieve tlic bar from a11 but the srnallost stress. A query inay also arise as to the effect on the b;w7stemperature of the exposed graduated surfitccs. It migl~tbe iiifesred that tllo bar is perceptibly hotter by rcason of tllese exposed p:lrts, small tliougli tliey are, than it would be if elltirely covcrctl with ice. B11t a study of tlie physical 1.c1ations liere presc:~~tcd does riot justify such iuferencc. The 1-easo11 is that the condnctivity of the steel is so lnucll higlicr t h a ~ l its enlissivity in air that tkc cxposctl parts of the bar cannot tliff'er ill temperature by more tlian n few tltous:u~dths oi' a degree from the

Length o f Iced Bar B,,. ltnexposed parts.* Wh:rtevor this excess may be, it can affect only sllort portions of the bar, and hence produce only vanishing changes of length. The same conclusio~~, i t mould appear, applies with greater Ccrti~intyto the l'rototype Met,re. A simple and direct experiment bearing on this questioii has also been frequently tried. It consisted in lnicroscopo readings on tlie ends of the bar just before and just aftel. Pressing tho bare finger for a period of ten to thirty seconds against Oue of tho grariuation plugs. If the heat thus conductetl'from the hand to the bar is not speedily dissipated, the bar sl~ould have becn mensurablY lengtllel~-ed thereby. No such change, lio~over, was observed. An obstaclo which solnctilnes proves troublesome in the use of the aPParatus, is tho condansation of moisture on tho graduated surfaces Of the bar. The most eticctivo means found for removing this is a dry camel7$-hairbrush. Such brushes were used ill the long serics of com1)arisonsof tho bar and Prototype Metre i n July and August, 1892, and no lnaterial del:,y from moisture occurred. ~inslly,exporiencemith the apparatus leads me to recominend a bar having a Y-sliaped rather than a rectauguldr cross section. Such a bar would posscsv the requisite rigidity with small inass per unit length. It Could be subdivicled into metro spaces by umrlrs on its neutral surQce, and its entire Iength deternli~iedby lneasuring those spaces f-Warately as well as by the method dependent on tllo use of six microscopes. I t s flducial lines sl~ould be of eqnal width mitliin n micron or two, so that personal equation would be certain of eli~ninationby exc11a11fi.e of positioils of tlle observers for either orientation of the bar. Provision might also be lnade for protecting the graduated S U ~ ~ ~ ~ from direct contact wit11 the ice. For this purpose liard rubber tubes ~ n i g l be ~ t fitted arou~idthose surfaces, atld if desirable they could be mad6 long e11oug.h to oxtend up through the ice 1);~ck. Such tubes would prevent abrasion of the polished surfaces by grit in tho ice, and would also protect them to some oxtent f'roiu currents of air, which, if laden with moisture, produce troublesome condensation. The longth in melting ico of a bar possessing this dcgreo of rofiueme~ltcould be' readily doterlrlined by the lnetliod followed on the ncw comparator. It would appear, ill fact, fi-om our experience in tho uso of that colnpsrator that tho length of sucl~ a bar in terms of a yrototyl~e metre would be known mith a probable error not oxcceding 1micron from the meal1 of four lneasures, which might be made in olio day, - or in two days a t most.

( 4 ) Result8 oj. ?)zeasuresof conzparator interval.-Tho distance between the terminal spheres of the 100" comparator was measured ni~ieteen times. The first nine measures wore made between July 30 and August 7,1891, and the remainder between September 24 and October 6. A measure as here designated means a determination of the comparator iuterval without interchange of the observers in reading 011 the ends of the bar. Such interchange of observers took place in all cases except for the first five measures, during which direct observa- ' tions for personal equation were made on tho bar. These observations proceedeti on the assumption that the relative equation of the observers was tho same a t both ends of the bar. But, as shown in section 20 of Chapter 11, this assumption is not correct. It becomes essontial, therefore, to recur to the investigatioll given in the sectiori just referred to in order to understand how the personal equation affects the measures in question. I n all measures of the comparator interval tho A end of B,, was' right, and the observers were 8 (Siebert) and W (Woodward). When a measure proceeded from left to right (or west to east) S always observed a t the right or A end of the bar and W a t the other end, if they did not exchange positions. Who11 they did exchauge positions, S alw,zys observed first on tho A end and W a t the B end of the bar. When a measure proceeded from right to left, S always observed first a t the 13 elid of the bar and W a t the A end. In conformity, then, w ~ t h tho notation of section 20, Chapter I T , let J,, L2, E l , Rf, denote the left :urd right llilntl readings rcspectively of Wb a pair of microscopes for any bar lengtli; ant1 let S,, Sh, Wa, denote the corrections to these r e a d i ~ ~ g for s personal equations of the observers a t tlre A elid :uicl B end of the bar, respectively. Then, supposing the measure to proceed from left to right, the distance betweell the pair of microscopcs considered is

for the first position of the obsorvcrs, and

for tlre second positioli. Now the derived length of B,, for A end right corresponds to the mean of these two exprcssions (a) :tnd (b); but when, as in the caso of the first five measures of the comparator interval, tho expression (a) only was observcd, the use of the derived value of B,, givos a distance too large by (8,- lvb) for eacli bar length. Similarly, the distance in tlre case of tho use of oxpressio~i (b) only is too small by (Sb - W.) per bar length. It is necessary, tlie~.eforeto treat the first group of measures of tho cornparator interval in such t way as to take

Theso quantities represent twenty times tho fi~nctiori (8, W,,) (S,, .- TV,) crf the pereoiial equations of tlie observers, as sbomn by tlie expressions (a) and (b) of section 4 above. This function is also the same as v 1 of sectiori 30, Chapter IT. Hence me have

v 1 = + 6.8" for tlie first group, v 1 = + 3.3 for the second group.
The first of these values is less trust\vortlly tlian the second, sirice the latter is indel~endent of all sources of error save th,Q of the c1i:wacter of pessonal equation, mliile the former i~lvolves otller sources of error. If we use tho oljservations of August 4 and 7 oiily in the first $roul), the resulting value of v 1 is + 3 W , which does ~ i odifier t materially from the value coming from tho second group. - W,) equal, as mas Had we assumed the values of (8, - Itr,,) axid dono in a preliminary accourit of this work published in the American Journal of Scieiice for January, 1893, tho resulting value of I) for the second group mould have bee11 idelltical v-ith that derived above, wllile that for tlio first group would have diEered from the value adopted by only 4'. Tho direct observations for personal equation referred to in section 4, and published in the number of the America11Journal of Science just cited, were macle on July 30, 31, August 3, 4,1891. They give 2.4' for the value of (8, - TVb) or (S,, - IV,,), ~u1)posingthese to bo equal, and 4.8' for the quantity corresponding to vl. It appears, then, that the relative personal equation of the observcrs mould liavo been an appreciable source of error in tliis work had 11ot care beer1 taken to elilnillate it8 eABct. Finally, sttcntion may be callcci to tho indication of sy~telnat~ic error, due to the direction of measnrement, fi~rnisliedby the lneasures of October 2 &nd 6, 1801. Referriiig to Table I, it is soon that on Oct. 2, Oct. 6,

From the evidence just submitted, together with that furnished by the measures of the 100'" comparator, atid from an intilnate knowledgo of the conditions attending the \~orli, it is impossible to doubt tliat me were dealing to a quite appreoii~ble extent with actual rnovernet~tsof the marltir~gstones. For this reason i t rrould seem essential to the higllest precisio~i in measures with tho icetl-bar app:~ratusto place tho marking stones ~vcll iulder grounrl and to give them plenty of time for settlement before using them. (11)Probable errors of' the kilometrr~?)henszlres.-From the data and discussion given in tlie preceding sections, it ;~ppearsthat the errors affecting the lrilometre Inensures as expressed in terms of I?,; are of tl~ree lrindu, namely: First, error of operation of the accideutal class; second, error of operation of the syste~nrttic class; and third, error arising from lnotions of t l ~ e ~narkillg stones, which latter may be assumed to be of the accitlental sort. I n the case of the first two measures of the lrilonletre it would sewn tliat tho system:ttic error surpasfied by fhr the resultant of the other two. ILL the case of tho last two me:bsures the systematic orror, thougli probably still the controlling one, was very s~nalland h) some extent conce;rled by the resultsilt of the otlrer two. It ~vould seem quite safb tlien to deduce the probable error due to tlle accic1ent:ll errors of operation from the ficcoud set of measures on the supposition that the two other sources of error were inoperative, since tllc valae thus re:~clied will be too large. No such limiting value, ltomever, can be assigned for either of t11,e probable errors due to the other sources, since tile uneli~nitiatedportion of tlie system:ltic error is entangled with the error due to stone movements. ltecurring to the second system of equations and values given in measure of a seesection 9, i t is seen that the prob:bble error of a ai~igle tion (of 2501nlength) is 1 0.04Stnm; ali(1111isis the ripper limiting \;aluo for the probable error of operation when the app:ir:~tusis used on stable pound. Prom this i t follows that tlie corresponding probable error for one measure of zt kilometre is 1 O,OOn"". It is of interest to compare this with tlie value detluciblu from tho rlieasures of the 1 0 0 ' " comparator, where tlic co~idi tions were essentially the same as those which obtained (luring tlie aecorid set of measures of the kilometre. Referring to section 5, we have A 0-03Gmn1 aud 4 O.OGlnlm as the probable errors of zt single measure of 100111 without excl~ange of observers to eliminate personal equation. Taking the average of these two values, dividing i t by J 2 , t o allow %r exchange of observers, and multiplying the quotient by d z , me 1i:~ve for tlie probable error of one measilro of a kilo~netre, as inferred from the coml~amtor work, 1O.lltnm, wllicl~agreos well wit11 tlie v a l u c j u ~ given t :~bove. It is clear from these figures that, with stable microscopes and with stable section marks, the error of rlleasurcinent may be rendered quite insigt~ificant in conlparisori with tllat of the I u ~ ~ g of t l ithe measurillg bar.

The speed attained in this process has been about 2 lrilometres per hour, though a s i ~ ~ gliilol~~etre le hits been measured in twenty minutes. By reason of the expansion arid contraction of tho tape, it is frequently desirable to set the tape back or forward by a round number of centimetres. This may be done on the zinc plates by means of a suitable pocket scale. Such displace~nents aro recorded :LS l Lset-b:lcksn and "set-ups.?'

B.-DETERITNATION OF EQUATIONS OF TAPES.

(7) Apparatusfor observing lengths oj'tapes.-It is obviously necessary to the successful use of long tapes in measuring lines of precision to provide suitable means for observing the tape lengths a t different temperatures. Such data for any tape give its length a t some assumed temperature arid its rate of expansion, and thus enable us to write an equation from which the length a t any observed telnperature can be computed. In order to meet this requirement in a way which would le:lve least room for doubt concerning the actual behavior of the tapes, the 100" cornparator described in section 2, Cllapter III, mas devised. The feat,ures e~sentialto a study of the tapes embodied by the comparator \!,ere, lst, that its length could be determined by means of the iced bar apparatus with a precision superior to that attainable with tho tapes; 2d, that the tape could be stretched and aligned on the comparator in precisely the same way as when used in the field; and 3d, that the tape length a t any time could be quickly and accurately referred to that of the comparator. As explained in section 2, Chapter III, the ends of the comparator were 111a1.kedby spl~erical-headed bolts, or cut-off' sphores. The end marks or graduations of a tape when under comparison were observed by inesns of micrometer microscopes mounted over the cut-off spheres as when used in measuring the length of tlie coml~arator with the icccl bar al)pa~.atus. The positions of the tape ends cotild thus be accurately referred to the cut-oft' sphores through tho medium of the cut-off cylinders described in section 8, Chapter I. The tape stretchers mere mounted on tho stationary car track of tho comparator, and by mealls of their vertical adjusting screws the graduated surfaces of the tape could bo easily brought to focus under the microscoljes. The t a l ~ e s wero supported a t intervals cf 10"' on wire rods attached to the alternate rnicroseope posts of the co~nparator;and the ~nethoci of handling tilo tape was in every way similar to that followed in field

The tliermonletcrs -?ere hung from light wooden supports attacl~ed to the microscope posts of the niiddle of tho co~nparittorand a t lBrX1 from.eitlier end,. Tllo stcnls of tlio tlierlnometers were upright and tho bulbs were kept a t about the same lieight as the tape. (8) ilfctl~od of observation.-Tl~o program1110ndl~ercd to in all determinations of the t:tpe lel~gt,l~s made on tho 1 0 0 1 ~ colnparator ~ is tllo S~ll~wj,, : l h e tape being n~ouiitetl oil its su1)port nails and :~ttaclled to tho tape Stretchert~, mas first put nuder tension, aligued, and bronglit to focus under the microscopes a t tlie ends of the comparator. Wheii this operation mas completed a t the east eritl of the comparator, the observer of that end gave one blast from his wl~istle. Tlle observer a t tlie \rest elid Uswered this signal by 0110 blast from 11is~vl~istle ;is tsooii as tho adjustme~lts a t his end were completed. The observers then rescl the thermometers nearest to them, while the recorder who st;uids near tlie llliddlo of the coluparator reed the thermometer a t that poult. On' aInlouncing their tllermometer re:ldinps to tllo recorder and heariog his repetition of thorn, the observers retnrncd to tlieir respective ends of the Comparator an(r re-es:uninetl their niljustinci~ts of the tape alftl microwas :%lw:tye scopes with respect to one auotl~er;and tlio tension, nrhicl~ applied a t the west end of the com~)nr;~tor, v7as brougllt to its nonnal value. On completing his adjustment the observer a t the east end gave one blast from his whistle. This was responcled to by one blast from the whistlo of the observer a t tho vest end as so011as his acljnstlnent~ were sittisfactory. The observer a t tlie cast tho1 gave two blasts from his whitjtlc, whereupon the recorder lifted tlie tape a f o ceuti~ metres from and let i t fa11 back on tlie lniddlo support nail. This fjerved to relieve the tape from friction on its support nails; anti ns Soon as the tape ceitsed vibrating the observer a t the east end gave one blast from his whistle. This maa responded to by one blast from the Whistle of the otl~er obsorver, and the microscopes more inlmediatcly brougllt @ bisection on tho graduation marlrs of tlio tapes. This cornPletod, the observers exchanged sig~lals, and procecdocl at onceto re-read tho thermometers. Finally, after coiupletil~gtlie record of tlie tliorhorneter rcndings, t l ~ c observers rcfcrred their respective ~i~icroscopes to the cut-off spliereg of t l ~ e compnrr~tor. The tilne required to lnalte sucll n tict of observatiol~s, exclusive of tho cut-oft'measures, was two to three niinutcs, whilo tho cut-off'nieasUres required about two 111ilr ntes'nclclitio~ial.

Their corrections were determined by Mr. 0. H. Tittmann, assistant in charge of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures of the Survey. Table I11 followiiig gives the corrections essential to reduce the observed readings of tliese ther~noineters to the hydrogeqscale a,sdeter~riined by Assistant T i t t m a n ~ on ~ August 19, 1890.

Tho rcntlii~gs of' tliese tliermomcters when packed i11 lnclted ice on August 19, 1800, mere + 0.250, + 0.080 and 0.000, respectively. Their freezing point readings were uot again determined until January 21, 1892, when they read + 0.150, 0.17O, and 0.000 respectively. To take account of these changes in the freezing point readings i t is assumed tliat they varied directly as the time during the interval which elapsed between the two determinations of August, 1890, and January, 1892. This assumption gives for tlie zero point readings a t the epoch of the tape comparisons, September, 1891, say, +0.173, $0.160, and 0.000, respectively; and these are the values adopted. Tho changos which these readings entail in the corrections in Table I 1 1 are found by adding +0.080 to the corrections for No. 5598, by adding -0.070 to the corredtions for No. 5599, while the corr~ctions for No. 5601 rclnain unchanged. Since tho tliermometcrs always had the same readings within a degree, i t has beell considered snficient to apply the mean of their corrections to the mcnn of tlieir readings in computing results from comparions on tho 100mcomparator. Accordingly, the mean corrections in Table I V following liavo been applied in deducing the temperatures of the tapes from the observations on the couparabr.

This is to some extent a ueedless refiiiement, but its applicatioii cost little labor. (11) Adopted le?lgtks of the conlparator.-As explairied in section 5, Ohapter 1 1 1 ,i t is assumed that the comparator interval or lengtll' 1) changed during the period of t v o m o ~ i t l ~ rnllicl~ s elapsed between tlie two groups of determinatiolls of that interval. Yortunntely, tlle largest groups of tape cornpltriso~is were nearly coincident in tiuio wit11 tliose of the comparator measures. For the small number of tape comparisons made between August 30 and September 5, a length of tho comparator interval is derived on the assumptioil that i t clinriged directly as the time between the two epocl~s for ~\~hicIl leugths are given irl section 7, Chapter 111.

c~mbi.niiig the two groups of residusls into a siligle group, the folloming comparison of the actual with the tlleorctical distribution of the residuals res~llts:

The agreemellt thus shon~n betweell the actual and theoretical distribution of tho resicIuals is, in general, quite close. AS is usual in such comparisons, the de~)nrt~ure fro111tlieory is greatest ilk the case of the large errors., ,On tho whole, therefore, it appears that the errors to which tlleso determinations of tape lengtl~s mere subject are of the colnpe~~sating class. A confirmation of tllis view is :lff:ordcd by tllu residuals of the group mean values s l i o ~ l lin Tables VII ant1 VIII. If the errors to which the individual determiu;btiolis arc sub*j!jectwere not of tho cornpensati~igclass we should expect large residuals to result from those group means. ~ i l residuals e are largest in tho case ofthe results for tape 85; but they reach only 0 . 2 1 0 1 1 1 a t t,lm masinlum, and this for group means having relatively small meiglit. T l ~ e degreo of cornpeneation was manifestly best for t]le comparisolt~of tape 88, sillce the maximum group residual shown in Table VIII is o111y0.03"'"', mllile the individual residuals for the coml)arisous of tape 88 were, on tlie average, somowhat greater tlian tiloso of tape 85. The avertlge of tll0 residuJ,s in Tables V I I and VIIT, regal-dless of Iveights, is O.Ocllll'l. This is equivalent to an error of 0.060 C. in tenlperaturo of the to 3/5 000 0 0 0 t h ~ of a t:y)e length. Notwitlistanding tho compensating cllaructcr of the errors in question wheu taken as rt rnllole, a curetill exalllillation of the residuals in Tab~es V and V I indicates tll& t]le detormiliatiol~s were sul)ject Inor0 or lest3 some systo~ni~tic errors.

( 1 ) Location of bme and pvepcr~ationfor ?neasure?nent.-Holton Base is a line in the TranscontincntAl Chain of Triangulation along or near the thirty-ni~~th part~llel of latitude. I t is situstetl near the villago of Bolton, Itil~lcyCoul~ty, Iud. It is about 5 50OU1 ~ O I I aud ~ , extends in a nelbrly north and south direction across wliat is known as the Crawfisli Flats. As will bo inferred from tliis desigllatioil, tho ground along the line is generally level, although a fern rather abrupt c1i:~ngesin altitu(1e are iuet iu Brossiug t l ~ e c~r;tinage courses. This baso tvas located i r ~lS9O by Assistnrlt Mosmnn, who made a pre1irniu:try mexsnre of its length with n 50'" tape the same year. Early ill the followil~g s u ~ n u eAssistai~t r Moslnan set the tcrrliiiial and section stones af tlie base a i d provided all materials roquisito to the measures made with t l ~ e 100"' t:~pes. During August, 1891, the iaarlcing aiid supl)ort stalres for tIic measures with the lo~ig tapos, weru set uncier the suporvisioli of the writer. The support stalrcs were set a t equi(1istlznt i11tcrv:rls ~ f ' l O 'tllrougliout ~' the lengtli of the line, exaopt on the starldard lrilon~et,re scctiou, wl~ero the micropcope posts for the iced-bar npp:lmtns rendered such staltes unliecesbary. The tapes wcre 8upl)orted on steel wire nails driven to prqjcctoti horizonthe depth of 2.5"" into the stakes. Since theso l~ails tally from tho stake8 for a distance of about 14"11,no great precision was essential in placing the support stakes alolig the liw. Tho marking stakes, wllicll fell 100'" apart, were alignod with considerable precisio~i, and tlie support nails were placed a t closely equal intervals of loll1 by the metl~od exl,lnincci in section 5, Chapter zv.

mado on the section ii OOOm to 5 500" during the last days of August, 1891, and tlie worl~ continued a t illtervalfi nntil October 8, 1891. Tho several sections were measured from six to t l ~ i r t ytimes eacb, the largest nn~nber of measures being made on the lrilomctre section, m h o ~ e precise length mas designed to give a thorough test of the efkctiveness of tape apparat~zs. Most of the measures of the section8 were made a t nigl~t, but a considerable number also were rliade cltiri~~g cloudy or partly cloudy days. Some of tlie latter mere niade uucler circu~nstauces of wind, rain, and sunshine, rvhiali ~vould now be considered quite unfavorable; but since it mas desired to 1e:trii as lnncll as practicable in tlie allotted time concerning tlie bollavior of the tapes, a witla vaiiety of circulnstances was purposely encountered. I n general, tho measures mere made by laying each tape length once as the work proceeded a l o ~ g a section. IT] a few cases, however, tho experiment was tried of lsyi~ig each tape lel~gtli from two to live times and reading the tliermomcters as rnany times; and in order to make these measures iudependerit, tho rear end of tlie tape a t starting mas placed snccessively in coiiicid(lnc.c,with marlrs a centilnetre apart. This experiment served to give all ide:t of the error hi lityil~gor pli~oing a tape length. I11 all tlicse measures but two tliermomcters mero used, and these were 're:lcl but once for each tape lcngtlj. When a sufficient number of operatives mere available the tlicrmonietcrs were carrictl and re:td by observer^ who did naugl~t else hnt assist in cnrrying'tlie tape, At otlicr times the t1lern1ou1cte1.s were carried and read by tho observers who fixed the ends of the tape. l u the former case, tlie tlier~nomctcrs mere held a t arm's le11gt11 by light fitrings so that the bulbs were near to and a t about the ssrtie l ~ e i g l fro111 ~ t the grourid as tlic tape; while iu the latter case the therrnonieters were suspc.,nded ~ I O I I Ia nail or bradawl attached to rr, support stalre so as to fall i n about, the same relative positioll with respect to the tape as before. I n both cases, the therruometers yere placed a t 20n1 fkorri tho tape ends. TIio salne thermometers used in the determinations of length of tho tfiyes on tlte comparator mere used also in the field measures, and the thertuometer corrections given in section 10, C11:tpter IV, mere applied in computing the tape temperaturea for tliese lnensures. In all measures of tlie scctions of Holton Base, Mr. J. S. Sicbert ma8 the observer a t the rear eiicl of tho tape and It. S. Proodward a t the front end. During the earlier measures tho tempera tnres were observed for the most part by Messrs. 0. 11. Tittularin and J. F. Hayford. The records were kept by Messrs. HayforJ ant1 Robert Penington. (3) Determinatio?~ o f grade corrections.-Tho dill'ere~~ces in height of the marking stakes or tables, essentit~l to the conlputation of grade corrections, were measured in duplicate by Messrs.

We are coi~cerried I~ere, then, only with tho excess of tho actual over the observed or liolninal tension in any case; but in order to show the data for these excesses, which qpyly to tlie tape comparisons as well as to the measures of the sections of the base, we give the observed values of W, R, and r arld the rcvlllting values of & ( W - R + r) for both balances in full in Tables 11 and 111 following. The last column of these tables gives, also, the corresporldiug corrections to the standard length of the tape.

The colnputation of the leugtli of tho fitalldard kilometre from tho date gi\rcil in the above table niay be 1n:tde as follows: Tl~e actual or working leugtll of the ti~pe IT, say, may be moat converiie~itlyosprcssed in the, form T=A+a+at, whereill A is the nominal length of the tape, a round number ot metres or lengths of solno standard; a is it sluall excess over that rouud nunibor; a is the rate of espai~sioiiof' tho tnpo, aud t is tho tape's temperature in degrees celltigrade.

end corrections, and the grade correction for tlie whole section of N tape leiigths. Thus, to illostrate by means of the data in Table I V above, we have, first, from section 17 of Chapter IV, for the length of tape No. 88, T8, = 2OB,, 6.31m1" + 1.0914""1't for the standard tension of 25 pounds 9 ounces. Tlie tension in this case was 3.2 ounces in excess of the standard value, and hence the tape was, as explained in section 4 above, 0.161nn1 louger than tho standard length just given. We have, therefore,

+

A = 20B,,, a = + 6-31"'" 0.16"" = + 6*47"m, a = 1-00141uu, N = 10.

Likenrise, from Table IV, the sum of the observed temperatures is 128-00,and the sum of the corrections to this for errors of the thermometers used is - 2.120, as found from the table of thermometer corrections given in section 10, Chapter IV; so Ghat there results Bt = 125.8S0. The several terms of the computation aro, then, tlie following:

XA = 2OOU,,, .+ 64.70mm, Na aZt +137.39, Sum of set-ups -150.20, Surn of end corrections = 10.60, Grade correction 5.39,

Resulting length

In this particular case a correction of 0.4"ln1 is to be added to tho resulting length in order to refer it t o the lrilometre as measured with the iced-bar apparatus, the refbreucc lrlarlrs for the tape ~neasures liaving becw to that extent ecccutric with reslmct to tlie t e r m i ~ ~cut-off al spheres.

(7) Intcrpretntion o f results.-It is esseutial to a propcr interpretation of the results in tlie above table to state certain additional i u f o r ~ n a t i o ~ ~ relative to the couditions under whicli the measures were made. The day nieasures of Scptculber 3, 1891, were made during the afterno011 of a day wliose' earlier part had been hot nud sultry. Tlle field e of this clay state that, altliougli the sky was gennotes of t l ~ 1ne;Lsures tape amit tlieruometers were occasioa:~llyexposed to erally cloudy, t l ~ c tlle direct rays of t l ~ c suu. Tlie measures of September 4 were made while L : strong breeze, risiug to a gale a t iutervals, was blowing This breeze, accolnpatlicd by lnore or less rain, sufficcd a t times to blow the tape mllen under teiisio~l off its $upl)orts. For these reasolls tho results of Septolnbor 4 cau not be regtrrded as a t all trustworthy in comparison with results obtai~led1111dcr ordinarily f~vorable co~lditioiis. The day ulensures of tlie st:mdsrd ltiloluet,rc of October 7 wero made a t a tilue of general cloucliness, but tho tape and thermometers mere exposed a t illtervals to direct sunshine. Whcu tlie 8un appeared on this date the measures were suspelidecl lilltil tho clouds again cut ofr Iiis rays, but in a number of cases the later measures of the set of five made on this occasion mere not completed before the sun's heat mas lnauifest in the thomorncter readings. The night measures were made, in general, a t times when dew was deposited to a greater or less oxtent in opeii fields. The only marked exception to this rule alq)Iies to tIio nicasures of the standard kilometre of September 23, 1891. Tho rligl~t of this (lay was an unusually warm and dry one, and the wooded portiori of tlic liilonietre7 which is about 600111lolig, had a notable storo of radii~nt lreat. The measures of the short sectio~i between tho 490On1 and 50001nstone L wide divergcncc froni the .later of August 27 and 28, IS91, present : measures of the same section. Tllese earlier measures \\.ore tlie first made with the al)paradus in the field, and i t was in laying this parwith the exccptiou of Siebert ticular tape length that the operi~tives, and Woodward, acquired their first experieuce. On these dates, also, a temporary and rather uustablo ninrlring table was used a t the 49001" sto~ie,pending the yreparatiou of iL rigid post which served subsequently as a lnicroscope post a t the tcrlniuus of the standard kilometre, and as a st:~ble support for tho laarlring table used in the tape measures of Septelnber and October. For these reasons the measures of August 27, and 28 uiust be regarded as untrustworthy iu comparison with the later measures of this short section. All of the measures save those of August 27 and 28 and September 4, alluded to above, wero made under favort~ble coiiditiol~s, it is beliuved, so far as the msnipu1:ition of tlie apparatus was concesued. With these explsuntious iu mind atteritiou may now bo ct~lIed to a, marked peculiarity exhibited by a11 tliu results of the day measures

except tlint of August 27 of' the short sectio~i 40001"to 5000111.A glance a t Table V slioms that tllosc, results are a11 s1na11 relatively to tIie results of the night nleasures save in tliu single il~starice ~ ~ o t e dDis. lneasures of August 27 anit Scptenlber 4, eoncorning regarding el~ose which there are grave doubts ;IS alreaciy explained, the discrepaocy in question is most marlced in tlie results of Augnst 27 and 31 (Section 50001~ to North Base), September 3 (Section 2100"' to 300OU1), a~id October 7 (Section 3900" to 4800'"). It nppe;lrs, also, from the lneasures of to Nortll I3itse), Suptclnber 3 (Sectioli 1200"' August 31 (Section 50001L1 to 21001"),and October 3 (Section 3900"' to 4!)00"'), that this discrepaucy disappe;irs, or teiids to do, so with the going clown of the Bun. Tlie u~iexpected fact thus brougl~t to light is that urldar the corlditions prosented by the dates oitecl, the thennometers gave : I temperature too low for the tape by amounts rar~gil~g up to about a degree Centigrade a t tho maxirnurn. Horn this fact is to be exl)lailied I am unable to say a t present, but of its existelice there can be no doubt. It is probably for absorpdue to the differing capacities of the tape and thermoinete~a tion and radiation under difl'ere~lt conditions. In view of this peouliarity of the day measures it becomes esseutial to inquire eareft~lly into tlie behavior of tlie t:lpes in tho night moasures during wliich the collditions a s to radiation diKered much less from those of the 100nlco~nparator mllereon the tape equat,ions nTnredetermined. The data for this inquiry itre furnished by the measures with the tapes of the stantlard kilometre, whose length wau detcrnlined with the iced bar, as explai~~ed in Chapter 111, and we proceed to Qxamine in detail i n tlie following section. these ~neasures (8) Co?~~Iu8ions from ta2e ?aensureu oj'stn~zdardkilometre.-Iu order to give a clear idea of tho performance of the tapes iu the numerous measures of the standard kilometre, a summary of those ~neasures is drnwu up in Table VI following. The first coluln~l of this table gives the date of a set or group of measures; the second give8 tlie limiting tinies of the date withi11 wl~icli the set of lneasures was rnade; the third gives tlie rlumbor of measures in the set; tho fourth gives tho mean of the results for length of the ltilornetre, and the last column gives the error of the mean length for any date, the true length of the kilometre being assumeti to be 200B,, 0.2'*'11 as found from the iced-bar measures and given in Chapter 111, section 12. The results from the day measures are inclosed in square brackekets:

It is clear from the results i11 this table that the errors of tho night ineirsurea are small in coll~parisol~ wit11 those of the (lily 1ne:isures. Tho lllear~of tlie night measures, giving weigl~tsto tho tabular lnealls proljortio~~al to tlio number of rcsults on w11ic:Ii they depend. is 200B,, + O.Omm, which differs but 0.21111i1 f'rom the v:iluo derived from tho iced bar me:mures. Tlle ~nxxjrnu~n error of any group lneau from the nigllt measures is 3.2"lU',or 1/300 000tll pnrt of tlie lrilometre; a11~1 tlie :average error of such gronp lneaufi (c1isrcg;ardiug mcights) is o111y l.Gnl>ll, or l/(i00 000th part of the lrilon~ctre. On tlie other hand, the day mei~sures are hrgely in error : u ~ d in oiie dircctiol~ only, tho masi~num error of one group mesli being 1/100 000th part ot' the kilometre. It seems safe to conclude, therefore, from tl~esenie:tsi~res of the 8talld;lrd kilometrc, that tho tc~nper:~t~ires of the tapes wlleu used a t uigllt ill $lie ope11 air wcrc? suhst:mtially as \yell detincct by tllo lucrcurial tliormo~neters as \ v h c ~ used ~ under tlic J ~ c d of t l ~ 100"' c coul])nmtor. Moreover, this conc:lusiolr is ~ubstnntiatcciso far as it can be by tlio evide~lcoafforded by the lneilsures of tIie otlicr soctions of the bssc, rnliich do 110t present n siltglc well-defined uvceptioll to the rule that the day measures are relatively short. 111aecorclance \\.it11this c*o~~clusio~l, we sllall use t l ~ o ~ r i g l 1iicasuret-j ~t o111yin dcrivilia t 1 1 ~ ndol>tcd ll1OiLll Ieiigtli~of t l i ~ several scctiolls of the biise.

It will be remarlicd, also, that the nul~lerousnight measures of tho standard lrilolnctre afford su6cie1it data for a gooil determination of the equations of tho tapes, especially for tape No. 88, since the tempernture r:wge for it in the kilomctre measures is about 160 C. But, as shown abovc, tltc equations of thc tapes dcrivecl from obscr\~ations on tlle loort1 ~olltl):~r:~tor :~rcill so close ztccord wit11 tllose dzct;~ tllat there is 110 liecd of :y)pealing to them for supplclnentary infbrniatioli concerning the equations of tlie tapes for the night work. Finally, attention way be called to tho snbst~ntialagreement with each otl~er#altd with the trne vallle of' the means of the night me:\sures of the standarotl ltilornctre from the two tapes. These means are 200B,, + 0*!PHn for t:~po No. 85 and 200B,, 0.2111111 for tape NO. 88. The actual errors of these nleasllrcs are thus, with respect to t11c iced bar value (200B,, 0.2n1111), only + O " P n atid - Q-4n1111, which arc in each case less than the millionth part of the length of the line.

It will be of interest, l~owever, to see to ml~at extent the mean lengths of tlre sectiorls and tlla length of tbe wlrole base would be ntt'ected if thc clay Inensures Itrere inclnclecl and given eqnal weight nlortg with tho nigltt rncasurcs.

Accordingly, the values wlticl~ res~~ from l t each of these t11rec sllppositions are given in Table VII following. The data for this table are d c r i ~ e d from TabloV. The first colulnn designates tho section of the base.

This arose from the fact that tlie winrl blow briskly from a nortlierly direction, or nearly in the direction of tlla bnsc, and hcrice it tended to straighten and thus incrcase the working lcr~fitli of' tilo tn],c, jnst ils a strong breeze tonds to Straigltten e string att:tchcd to s fixed point a t one end 01. to rellder it parallcl to the direction of the cnrrel~t, wl~icltis i l l ger~cri~l llorizontal.

classes: (I) Errors of manipulation, or errors incident to tho mero operation of placing or laying a tape length. They include errors due to lack of coiiicider~ce of the tormirial marks of the tape with the detlning marks on the zinc or other marking plates, errors due to incorrect tension of tlie tape, errors cine to friction of the tape on its supports, :m(Z errors duo to defective alignment of the tape. (2) Ten~porature errors. 'l'heso include all errors tending to give incorrect teinperatures to the tape, clxcopt sucll constarlt errors of the thermometers as may affect all mcnsnres itlike. ICelatively, the second class of errors is by far the most forruidablc, since they tend a t times tonrarci the constant typc of errors, but it is important also to give such inforrriation as is available with respect to the riiiiior source. Accordingly we sIia11 ei~deavor to separate the two classes of error.

The residwtls found by subtracting the iced bar value of this kilo~rletre (200 B,, + 0.21e111) from tlie several night measures, taken individnnlly, range from - 4.5U1111 to + 6.3111111, Tlie ]lumber of these residual8 is 21 aiid the sum of their sqnares is 117.2; so that the proba. ble error of a sing10 ~iigllt111easilre of tlie st;lndard kilolnetre was - & ~.~111111~ 011 the other himd, if we coiisitler all tlie night measures of the several ~ectious,iacli~dingtlie stalidard kilouletre (but excluding the short sectiori of 100111 fur tlie reas011t h i ~ one t tape length does 11ot atiord an opportuliity tor the developnle~it of the error8 in question), there are in all 4 G measures of U seotiolis. These sectiolls vary in length from 500111 tO 172001n7 and hence it is essential to have recourse to weights iu order to derive the probable error of one measure of a kilometre. Assumiilg that the resulta~lt error desired is of tho colnpeusati~ig class, the weights of the different sectioi~s will vary inversely as their lengtlls; and if we call the weight of one mcnsure of a kilo~netre 1, the .weight of oue measure of a section n tape lengths long (n100~l) will be lo/?,. In order to exhibit the data fur~iishedby tlie several sections for the probable error desired, the details are brougllt together in Table VIII below. The first column of the table gives the desiglistion of the 8%tion; the second gives the numbor of Illensures of tho sectiori; the third gives the range among thoso measures; the fourth gives the weight of the section; and the fifth gives the sum of the weighted squares of the residuals found by coml~nrir~g tlie i~idividual mossures of a section with their mean.

This, it !rill be seen, is slightly larger tlrizn tbe valne derived from the kilometre measures alone. Now, by means of this val11e and the data afforded by the determinatiorls of the tape lengths on the 10On1comparator, it is possible to derive an estimate of the maguitude of tlie error due to manipulation. By reference to Cllapter IV, section 14, it is see11 that the error of one determination of a tape length on the comparator was f 0.20."'m, and this is due al~nost wllolly to error in the assigned temperature from the mean of six thermometer readings. Assutniug that the temperature errors were no greater in field work than on the comparator, the probable error of one tape length from the mean of two in place of six thermometer readings should be .+ 0.2Omm4G artd heltce, tlro probable error in t l ~ e length of a kilometre, or the 8uln of 10 tape lengths, should 0.20mn1d3% = & l.lllnn. Since the probable error of measurebe ment due to all sources of error was found above tx) be 4 1G"71'11', a t most, me infer th:it the probable error due to errors of lnanipulation in one measure of a kilonietre isr
& .\/-(1~7)~ - (t.l)i= 4 1.3"ln1.

It appears, then, thnt the probable errors dl10 to the two classes of error (error of manipulation and error of temperature) were about equal in the case of tlio night tne:isures of Holton Base. Some doubt may be for entertained as to the correctness of the above estimate of & l.lmm the probable error due to temperature errors. Subsequent experience,, on St. Albans Base, ip 1802, under somewhat different conditions, as explained in sections 20-27 below, does not corifirln this estimate, but seems to shorn conclusively that the error of operatio11is quite negligible i n conlparison with that of the te~npernture.

( a ) Probable errors dzte to errors of measzlrement.-Tlle mean le~lgtlrsof the sections we shall adopt are those given in the secorid colu~un of Table V I I above.

It mill bo observed that tlie probable errors in tho last two columns of t.he above table agree fairly well, and t l ~ n s justify tho assnulption that tlie errors of mensure~nent with tho t:ipo appnr;ltus are of tho compensating sort, or tllat the aggregate error of rncasuro~nellt increases as the squaro root of tile dist,a~lco me:lsured. We conclude, also, that the probable errors (2) are, on the whole, the znoro trustworthy, since they aro not unduly affected by tho cxcessivoly large or the excessively small orrors which appear in the measures of some of the sections.

length would also produce a cumulative error. Both of these align ment errors make the measured lor~gthof the base too great. Both errors are, however, very small. An error as great as 0.2"'" from crookedness of the tape with respect to a vertical plnue tlirougli its ends is, it is thought, of very rare occurrence. 13rrors due to defects in setting tile support llails to a uriiforln grade must be smaller per tape length tliau tlle fornier and of still rarer occurrence. The lnetllod of setting tlie support liails is so easy and accurate tliat an error in position as great as l c l n can arise only tlirough accidents or blunders. Not\~itlistancling the indicntions t11at the errors in grades and alignnlent are negligible, we shall attribute & lmm as a probable error to each of these sources, since it is possible that some blunders occurred in this first application of the method and apparatus. With respect to the two errors of measurenient, 4 1-99mm and f 1.661um, given above, nre shall adopt the larger, in order that the precision may be underestirnnted mtller than overestiruated.

ALBANS BASE MEASUREMENT.

(15) Location of base and preparatiojo for mem?crement.-St. Albans base is a liue in tho transcontinental chain of triangulation along or near the thirty-ninth parallel of latitude. It is situated in the valIey of the Great Kanawha river, near the village of St. Albans, Kanamha County, mTu$ Virgi~~ia. It is about 3 90011LX O L I ~ , and extends iu a riearly east and wost direction alollg a dosuly level portion of the valley. It is on the north sido of and is parallel to tho Chesapeake nud Ohio railway, the wost end being 17.8"' atid the east elid 18.4"' froin the nearest r J 1 of tho main track in 1893. This base was located in the summer of 1801' by Sub-Assistant Walter B. Fairfield. The terminal iuarlting stones were provided and sot uuder the direction of Assistani Mosman during tho autumn of tho same year. A profile of tho line and a doternlinntion of its height with respect to an adjacent triangulatiorl station of ltnown height were also made under Assistl~nt Nosman's dii~ectionby Mr. J. 5. Siebort. This base mas nlensured with the tapo apparatus in the oarly part of October, 1892, by a party in chnrgo of the writer, aided by Asslsttint E. E. Haskell, Recorders M. V. Safford and Orville G. Brown. The lino was cleared of brush, brambles, grass, and other obstacles, arid the marking and support stakes for the tape8 wore set during the days Uctobor 1-9, 1892. Tliese stakes were set 10'" apart, and the marking stakos f ero all csrefully aligned with a theodolite. Special pains more also taken in this work to ~ n a k e the spaciug of the support r~nils uniform slid to bring them accurately into coi~~cidonce with tho liue of slopo for any tapo length. Somo special provision lind to be made for supporting the tapes a t an elevation of 3mto id for two tapo lengtlls whore the liue crossed s ravine. But the supports for tlievo two tapo lengths wore no less stablo than a t otller part8 of the line, aitd no difflculty was met in handling the tapes successfully a t such altitudes. (16) Ncasurernents of the base.-A measure of the base was mado during the afternoon of Octobor 10 with the l o o n 1 steel tape No. 86 in

orilcr to afiord practice in manipulating the apparatus to the operatives, all of whom, except the writer, had had no experience with the apparatus. I n this practice measure no record was kept of the set-ups, and sonic tape length8 were omitted, so that no results can be derived work of actual measurement was begun on October 1 1 from it. T l ~ e ; u ~ dcontinued until October 14. Two measure& of the base, one in each direction, were ~ n a d ca t night with each of the steel tapes Nos. 85 and 88; and a daytime measure, in bright sunshil~e, ~ ~ made n s with tape No. 88. In all the Incasnres, Mr. E. E. Haskell mas tile observer a t the rear elld of tlie tape ant1 Mr. R. 8. Woodward the observer a t the front end. The thermolrieters from which the tape temperature was inferred were also read by these observers. An additio~ial thermometer with a bright bulb, as explai~ledmore fully below, was road a t the middle of the tape by Mr. M. V. Elsfford, who also attended to tlie operation of flipping the tape and :~fiuistedin carrying i t forward. The records mere kept by Mr. Orville G. Brown. The whole number of operatives elnployed in t l ~ e work was ten. The b:ue mas divided into i'our sections. These were all nearly one lrilolnetre in length, except the easternmost one, wliich was about 869". Tlle fractional part of a tape length, ~ramely,6Dn1, in this latter case, mas lneasured on the tape when under the usual tension; 60'" of this fraction (or, rather, three-fifths of a tape lengtli) wau obtained directly from tlie 20'" sub-spaces on the tapes, while the remaining portion of 9", about, was measured by nleans of an auxiliary 1 5 ' " Chestorman steel Lqpo divided fo millimetres. The l~articular portion of the latter tape used mas tested on the Mural standard of the Survey on returnirig from the field, and found to accord sufficiently well with its nominal value.

Any such movements, li?wever, which might take place from clay to day would not aflt'ect the interval between tho ter~ninal stones, since tlie base was measurcd continuously from end to end whenever any measurement was ~nade. (17) Determina.tion qf grade ccorections.-The diftbrences in altitude of the cor~secutiveruarkir~gtables mere measured independently by Messrs. Haskell and Saflord. Wlicnever arly discrepancies appeared, tho work was re-examined by them, and it is believed that the adopted tliflere~iccsare trustworthy within 11alf a co~itin~etre in every case, while the two largest of tlioso differences were determined with a much greater precision. ' The lnaximum difference in height of the tables for any tape length mas 3.571m,which gives a grade correction of 63.76"lm. The average difference in hoiglit per tape length for the several sections counting fkom the west end were 0,37"', 0.89"', 0.2grn,and 0.18m, The grado corrections were conlputed in duplicate by Messrs. Saflord and Woodward, and tlio following are the resulting values for tho several sections : ntm. Sectio~i West Base to Stako 10 - 8.52, Stake 10 to Stake 20 - 93-58, Stake 20 to Stake 30 - 7-20, Stake 30 to East Base - 3-40., (18) Determinations o f tape te?ttperatz~res.-Mercurial thermomotors of the same sort as those used on Holtori Base wore used to give the tape temperatures in the nleasureinerit o f St. Albans Base. But in the hope that the thermometers could be made to follow the tape temperatures with greeter certainty the :iIun~inumsheaths used in the Holton work mere replaced by steel slicaths. Tliesc were made of very thin steel tape which was coiled into cylinders just long and large enough to slip over tho thermometer bulbs and clasp their stems. By annealing, the surface of these coils was given a dull black color cIosely resembling that of the mensuring tapes. A disadvantage, however, of tliese steel sheaths over the alumi~inm ones lies in tlieir greater mass, which is about 0.50 gralnmes, and is about three times the mass of tlie aluminum sheaths. !llllisillcrease in mass caused a notable lagging of tlie thermometers with respect to the tapes, whereas such lagging was very small when the liglltor sheatlis were used. The effects of this lagging, however, appear to have been well e l i ~ n i ~ ~ a by t e dthe process of ~rioasurement adopted. With the hope, also, that some light might be shed on the obscure qnestion of the pers~stent difference between the tape and the thermometric temperatnres during tlio day measures of Holton Base, a thermometer with no sheath att'whed to it (or one with bright inatead

of black bulb) was read in all the measures of St. Albans Base. The salient result revealed by this experiment is that during the daytime the thermometers with black bhlbs (or sheaths) read uniformly higher and a t night uniformly lower than the therlnometer with'the bright bulb. This fact corifirms what might be, of course, expected, namely, that the tape and thermo~netersmay have persistently differing temperatures unless they have the same capacity for absorption and radiation. Another result of this experiment which may prove of value in further' studies with the tapes is that the period when thermometers with bright and black bulbs givo the same readings occurs shortly before sundown, and appears to coincide with the period of steady atmosphere.' But aside from these results, interesting though they be in a general way, nothing came from t h use ~ of the thermonieter mith tho bright bulb. The temperature of the tape was inferred altagether from the readings of the two thermometers supplied with the steel sheaths. That the latter gave temperaturesclosoly coillcident with those of the tapes, except for the lag effect, which .was in general well eliminated, appears to be demonstrated by the results of the several of the base. measures of the four ~ectiolls The thermometers used in all work on St. Albans Base were Nos. 6598, 5620, and 5621 by Green. Table X following gives tho corrections to be applied to the readings of these tllerrnometers to bring them into accordarlce mith the standard hydrogen scale. Tlie corrections to 6598 are those given in section 10, Chapter Iv, tho freezing point re:tding adopted being that of Jauuary 21,1802. The freezing point readings of 6620 and 5621 were determined by Mr. Louis A. Fischer, of the office of Standard Weights and Measures, in Septcnibor, U92.

(21) Interpretation o f results.-An inspection of. tho retlults in Ihe above table shows the ranges amonght the individual measures of the rjeveral sections t a be 13.7mm, 3.0'~~ 7 10*01"", and ll.6n11n,respectively; and the question which immediately suggests itself is, why should the range for the sectiorl s h k e 10 to stake 20 be so much less than for the other sections? The hypothesis wo offer in answer to this questiou affords a satisfactory explanation of the ranges just mentioned, espocinlly those of the night measures, and clears up some of the peculiarities noted in the measures of Eolton Base. It is based on the following corlsiderations :

Tupe 9neasures of St. Albans Base.

In case there is any relative lagging of the tape and thermometric ternper:btures, its eflect mill be more or 1esv eliminated in the mean of two measures of a scctio~i made the one under a rising and the other under a falling temperature. A similar elimination of the lag effect mill occur in a single measure of a section if the temperature is riving for one-half and falling for tlie other half of the measure; and, in gcneral, the lag effect mill tend to eliminate itself if the temperature fluctuates to any considerable extent about its mean trel~d. The conditions whicli obtained during the measures of St. Albaris Base, so far as they pertain to this lag effect are, in general, well indicated by the data in the fifth arid sixth colu~iins of the above table; but it should be 10 to stake 20 was specially favorable by stated that the section ~ t a l r e reason of its topogri~pliiccorlfor~nationfor eliminating the lag effect. The middle portion of this section was on low marshy ground compared with the ground a t either of its ends, so that there was always tt marked fall of ternperdure on approaching the low grouiid and a marked rise on leaving it, regardless of the directiori of measurement. This answer, i t may be conceded, esl~lainsthe small range among the results for the section stake 10 to stake 20; but if it is tho correct answer, me should exgect the means of the forwdrd and backward measures of the other sections to show a similar degree of accordance, since, as sliomn in the sixth column of the table, the temperature gradient mas in gor~eralreverseci with a reversal of tlio direction of measurement. The two night measures with each tape are in this respect strictly comgarablo, sillce they were made under conditions iu all respects similar; i. e. the sky was cloudless or n e ~ r l y so, there was little or no wind, the preceding days had beell very much alike, and the lneasures were made a t tirnes when dew was condeneilig aloi~g lnost p a r b of the line. That these means do so accord is shown by the results in Table XI[ following, which gives the moans of tho night measures of the sections made with t l ~ e two tapes. For brevity the sections are numbered 1,2,3, 4, respectively :

The accordance of these results leaves little to be desired ; but for the reamns already adduced and for others given below, it is dif3cult to see how i t can be otherwise than real. Although the fact that nicuns of forward and backward measures of

a section indicated a marked elimination of ,some source of error was noticed iu certain of the measures of Holton Base, the explant~tion of that fact, presented above, did not occur to me until after the night measures of St. Albans Base had been made. The full import of the explanation, indeed, was not appreciated until after the day measure of October 14 had been made; otherwise a rcvcrse measure of the line moltld have been made on the latter day. The particular measures of Holton pase just referred to are those of sections 2 100mto 3 OOOm and 3 OOOnl to 3 900m. On referring to Table V of section 7 i t will be seen that each of these sections was measured in both directions on Septembe? 18 and again on September 19,1891, under conditions favorable for the elimination of the lag eflect. The excesses over 180B1, of the means of the forward and backward measures of the section 2 100ulto 3 OOOm for these two days are + 71.2m1u aud 70-7n11n; and for the sec6ion 3 OOOm ,la 3 900" the corresponding excesses aro 20-4n'm and 20.0mm. These exhibit a degree of accordance equal to that shornrl in Table XII. A similar degree of accordancc is shown in the forward and backward measures of tlle standard kilodotre of Holton Base of September 30, October 1, and October 8, 1891, on which dates the tem: perature gradients xero favorable to the clilnination of the lag effect. Attention has also been called in sectioll 11 to the fact that the me,zsures of the standard kilometre shorn a less probable error than the measures of the other sections of Holton Base. The reason for this is found, I believe, in the topographic conforination of that kilometrc. It passed for 600'"of its length tlirougli ib dense forest, Ieavir~g200'" a t either end in open fields. I n nearly all tlle night measures the thermometer readings uhow a rise of ternperat~ire on passing from the open fields to the forest, and vice versa; which conditious, a s explained above, were favorable for the elimination of the lag effect in a single nieasure of the line. . To recur to the measures of St. Albarls Base, it is seen from the results in Tables X I and XI1 that the largest discrepancies are found in every case where, according to the liypothesis considered, they would be expected to appear. Thus, in Table XI the range is greatest in the measures of the section West Base to stake 10, which presented the steepest temperature gradients; and in Table XI1 the range is greatest in the case of the third sectioin, which, as appears from the data in the sixth column of Table XT, presented the least favorable temperature ' gradients. It should be noted, howemr, that the difference between the night measures of the section West Base to stalte 10 with tape No. 88 is much greater than that between the night measures with tape No. 86. The temperature gradients, in fact, indicate that the former difference ought to exceed the latter, but lt is not clear that the excess should be has led to a comprtrison of as great as it is.

with tho two tapes. It shows that the measures with tapo No. 88 were fbr overy tape length appsreutIy longer in the oue case and shorter in the other by about (1-7""; in other words, if we are dealing with a lag effect, the ther~nometers gave a temperature too high to the tape under a, fallilig gradient and too low under a rising gradient by about 00.7 O.,and this error was persistent througl~outboth measures of the section. Attention has beon callcd in Chapter IV, section 15, to rt similar discrepikncy in the behavior of tlieso two tapes when placed alongside of ouo another on the 100" coniparator of Holton Base. It is most just referred to, to some difprobably due, aqsuggested in the sectiol~ fercnce in the c~nissivit,ics of the two tapes, but a study of all tlie data has not up to tlfe 1)rosont time led me to any clearer view of the question. It r e ~ n a i to ~ ~consider s the results of the day measure of the base of October 14,1802. This was made on a cloudIess day between 2 5 3 and 4:26 p. m., and tho mean temperatures for the several sections varied from 320-11 C . to 2'3c.80 C. Including this messurc, the moan temporatures of the ttlpe ranged for the differont day and night measures of each section through nearly 250 0.; so that tho ac.cordance of the day measures with the mean of the night inensures affords a pretty severe test of the equations of tlic tapes and of the thernlomotoric temporatures attributed to tlie~n. A glar~ce a t the data in the sixth and seventh colutnns of Table XI shows tli:~ttlro accordance of the day measure is bost, as i t ought to be in col~formitywith the considerations adduccd above, in tho c ~ s o of the first and second sections, and worst, a8 would be oxpectod, in tho cnso of the last two sections.* The dift'erenceflbetween the day moastsures of the several soctions and the xnealls of the night measures of tho same are

for the lag effect, the thermometers as fitted with the steel shields gave temperatures in very close agrce~nentwith thoso of the tapes during both the day and the night mensnres of the base. Briefly summnriced, then, our interpretation of the ~.esults of the measures of St. Albans 13ase is that the most formidable errors to as fitted which they vere subjec:t arose from Isg of the therlno~noters with the steel 8hiolds; that these errors wore well eliminated in tlie means of the forward and backward night rnensures with either tape for all sections, and well eli~~linated in all tlle individu:~lmeasures of the second section by reason of its topographic conformation; and iinally, that tlie result of the day measure is too great by reason of uncompensated lag effect which lie8 chietly in the le~@hsof the two easternmost sections of the base. a (22) Values for weasured lengtlk.9 o f base and probable ewer qf nteasurement.-The value we shall adopt for the entire length of the base i~ the mean of the four night measures, since all our experience indicates that tlie temperature unoertai~ity is in gerieral least in'rlight mcasulees, and since it appears certain that n considerable lag eftect was elimi~ ~ c ~ in t e the ( l me:ms of the forw:trd and backward n~easures of this base. Accordingly, the value we adopt is or the mean of the results in tho last column of Tablo XII.

given by the equations of the tapes derived in Chapter IV. Shbse. quently to the measurement of St. Albans Base the tapes were compared directly on a 100m section of the base. An account of this .work is given iu section 2 G below. It inr1ic;~tesa correction to' thc difference of the tapes a t 00 C. of about the same :rmount as that just mentioued aud kith somewhat greater certainty. The amouut of this e as its discrepancy, i t will be observed, is of about tlie s ~ u i magnitude probable error derived from the expression (9)) section 16, Chapter IV, namely : 4(().055n1m)Z +T ( j ~ o ~ ~j2 ~1 m i t ~~ . O & ~ I , I , so tha.t no great weight can be attached to i t wl~enaonsidered by itself. But inasmuch as t.11~ lengths of tapes mere detelmined by observing on them with ~nicrometermicroscopes l~aviug :I power of 27 diameters, while in applying them to nleasure a base a hand mngnifier or the unaided eye is used, i t is possible that so~ne constant error may have thus entered the measures of St. Albans Base. Bor t l ~ i s reason the extreme value of f 0-06mm will be talcen for the probabla error of the tape lengths in those measums. This, as sl~own in section 16, Chapter IV, is the probable error of tlie tape lcngtbs giver1 by their equations for srlcll temperatures as 00 awl 300 C. Sillce there were 38.7 tape lengths in the base, tllc probable error of 4 0.061n111 per tape length gives & 2.3Zmn1 as the probable error of the whole base due to this source. (24) Corrections to measured length qf ba.se.-To the ,adopted Inearl length of the base give11 in sect.ion 22 above, threc? correc:tions are to be i~pplied, namely: (I), correct.ion for grades; (2), correction for error in thermometer oorrectio~lsused i n the coltlput:ttion of tlie 4e11gths of the sections of the base;. (3), reduction to sea level. (1) Since the entire length only of the base is needed, tlte SUJII of the grade corrections may be :tpplied to the adopted ~neasuredlength given in sectiol~ 22. This sum, the terms of which nro given in ~ectioll 16, is - 112.7nun.

The corrections actually applied in computing the lengths of the sectiou~ of the base were, by roason of an error in making up a) table of correctiont;, all numaricaIIy larger than those by the following amounts for the several sectio~ls of the base counting from the west bnd: First section, 0.028, Second section,'O -022, Third section, 0 -021, Fourth section, 0 .091.

In order to derive the difference in length of the two tapes tlie where D is the distance between the tcrminal marks quantity D- To, of the comparator and Tois the length of either tape a t 00 C., was coniputed for each set of observations by means of the known rates of expansion of the tapes.

It may be remarked, l~owever, that the maximum possible error of St. Albai~s Base d ~ l e to t,liis discrepancy, even if real, is only slightly greater than one two~nillioiith part of its length. Finally, i t seems worth while to give tlie results of certain observations inado on Ocstober 24, 1892, for the purpose of getting an idea of tlle error involvecl in the oper:~tionof laying and stretching the tape. I t I~appened on this date that very favorable coiiditions for determining this error presented themselves. That is, the temperature was very steady, the sun being obscured by clouds; there was equilibrium of radiation as shown by the near equality in readings of the thermolneters with black and bright bulbs, and there mas little if any wind. Under these circumstances threo sets of observations were made with the tape and therlnonieters in the same way that observations are matlo in rnerisuri~iga line, except that the tape was not removed from t l ~ e snpport nt~ils of the comparator, and that tlio position of itla front end was read on the ~nillilnetrescale instead of being marked on a zinc plate. The tensioil of the tape was in each case brought up &om zero to the standard amount, and all other operations performed in precisely the same nlanrigr as in the work of mcnsurentent. Table XV below gives the results of thcse observations. The first rohimn gives tlie limiting times of day of the gronps of observations; t l ~ c second gives the temporatlire observed by the? therniomoters; the third gives tlie reading of the tape on the scale at, its front end, the tape being set in each case to coinciderlce with tlio inark :it its rear end; the fburth gives the values of D- lT0, br the difference between the comparator interval :~nd the lengtli of the tape et 0"C.; and the last column gives thb discrepancies v between the individ~ial~*esults for any group slid their mean.

(1) Object o f investigatiow.-The use of long metallic tapes or wires in measures of precjsiori gives rise to a nahber of questions which can only be answered by a con~petentmathematical theory or by a series of elaborate experime~lts. Thus, in the use of such tapes it is essential to know how to compute the c l ~ a ~ l g ine length due to a change in tenof supports 011 sion, the chang? in length clue to n change in the riu~uber which,the taperests, the change in lengtll due to a change in meigllt por unit length of'the tape, etc, It is tbc object of this brief investigation to give so lnucll of the theory of such fslpes or wires as is needed to answer t h e ~ practical e quesbions. (2) Equations o f equilib~iunz o f elastic tapes.--The tlleory of the eqailibrium of elastic strings, tapes, etc., i s given in one form or anotlier in various treatises on mechanics. It generally proceeds, however, on the assnmption of "perfect flexibilityv of the material of the tape, or on some other doi~btfulass111nl)tion as to the internal stresses of that aiaterial. Properly spralting, the inquiry belongs'to the theory of d a s ticity, and its correct basis has been clearly set forth by Lam6 in sections 39-41 of his Leqons snr la Th6orie MathBmatique de L'fllasticihi tles Corps Solides.* A tape m here cor~sideredis an e!astic body of small cross s e c t i o ~ ~ subject to tension applied at its end&:u~dto any bodily forcoa, brrt tree from surface tractiol~s.

Let ~ 1 ) be the cross section and /J tbp dellsity of t11c tape a t any point of its length defined by rectangular mordina*ti X, ?I, z.

Measzwement o f Holtoli Bmc w,itl~ the New Secondury Bass Apga.ratue.
The whole W e was moasured during rising temperatures and much the greater part during bright sunshine. All the expcri~nentsshow that under such conditions the bars are never shorhr than the indicated temperatures imply, and that t1ic:refore the result, if it is in error on account of thermometer lag, is too small. The experimerits on the 100m lneasured in the bright sunshine, September 21 and 22, sliow that the lag on supposition 1,explained in pages 7 and 8, amounts to about 1 part in one million, and on supposition 2 to 7-,+,m, and i t is therefore : L fair inference that its effect 011 the nFliole base is of that order of magnitude, and that, i t should be applied to the the uncorrected length of the base. Using the value 0.14n"n per 100111 measureci length should be increased by 55 x 0.14 = 7.7"'". I n order not to'claim too high a precision for the lengt,h above given i t seems safe to assert that its absolute error does uot exceed its 1-500000 part.

GENERAL CONCLUSIOXS IN REGAILD TO THlE USE OF THIS APPATLATUS.

1. The average speed of rneasuremcl~ts, including the time requisite for training tllr opc:mtors, ]nay be taken a t I kilometro per day of eight-houl.s, on level ground, or on a uniform grade. With trained men the speed can be illcreased to 1.5 kilometres per day without detriment to accuracy. 3. If the ternperatllre of the bars were known, the accuracy of measl ~ r c m e would ~ ~ t leave 110t11i1lg t o be desireti. The pro1):tble error of a single n~easurement wonlcl thcn be about one part in a million. 3. As usual the princip:il solirce of error is in the u~lcertai~lty betweell the i~rdicated ant1 true temperat urc of the bars. This relation depends on the range of the diurnal temperature to which the bars 11:kvc: been exposcd, and its value must be subject to some uncertai~lty. It appears, lio\vever, that i f is possible to assign the limits of error due to lag of tlie thermometers. Tbe :~bsohitclag of the thermometers can safely be taken to lie between 0 and 4 03.5 Clr. 011 the average in a day's measurement. Hence, if an error of onc part in 340 000 shall not be exceeded, a single ~ n e n s ~ ~ r e r n with u~lt this apparatus mill secure that degree of accuracy if the following rules be observed : 1. If the temperature is rising, apply a correction for lag of 0 0 : ! 5 to the mean tempu~.ature of the thern~omebrsfor the day, and a mrrectioli of - 0.25 if i t is falling. 2. If one-half of the day's lneasiires are made during rising and the other half d u ~ i n g falling temperatures, the mean may be taken without correction. 3. If the measurement is made during hot weather and in the bright sunshine with rising temperatures, no correction need be made. It may also be pointed out that where i t is possiblo the bars, if day measurement only is intended, should be protected as much as possible against, change of temperature a t night.

MEASUIZEMENT O F HOLTOX BASE, RIPLEY OOUNTY, IND.

For description of base ~iiolluments and locality see Assistant A. T. JIosman's report, pp. 330, 331. The 5-metre contact slide rods Nos. 13 and 14 were used in this measurement. This apparatus is of the usuul pattern. It was m d e a t the Coilst and Geodetic Survey Office and was completed in July, 1891. The rueasuring rods are of cylindrical steel, 6 metres long and gmm in di:tmeter, with the usual contact slides. The slide end of each rod carries a white agate knife edgo 3- wide, the other a circular plane in diameter. The index and slide piece of each rod surface about 31nm have each three liries ruled 011 them. When the middle lines on the slide and index are in coincidence, the distance between the agate plane a t one eud and the knife edge a t the other is the length of the rod. Each steel rod is encased in a built up wooden bar and r e ~ t directly s wide, lPam in rt longitudinal groove in its middle. The bars are 7-Earn high, and 4-9 metres long, so that a length of about locmof each rod is exposed to tho air. Each rod carries two thermometers. They are inserted in opposite sides of tho bar and are in contact with the rod and not with the wood. Each one is 1metre from the end of tlie bar. The wooden bar iu turn is surrounded with a w h i t e canvas cover lined with half an inch of cotton.
THE TRESTLES.

Tliey are of the ueual wedge ant1 tripod piittern arid are the same as tho~e used in the Yolo baso. Throughout all the measurements, except those on the comparator, the trestles were used without foot plates, the legs being merely firmly sttnck into the ground.
THE EIEUTORS.

The sectors are segments of arcs of circles. Each carries two (2) Verniers 180" apart and is 80 graduated that the position in which the bar is horizontal reads nearly 20" on the front vornier. The verniers read to 10". Before beginning work the contact ends of each bar were put in a horizontal plane by means of a leveling instrument, theodolite, or engineer's transit. I n go~ieral the sector errors were determined three times a day. Each sector was protected against the sun by a hood made of canvas stretched on a wire frame attached to the bar. Duririg all the measures t'he two verniers of elloh sector were read by din'erent persons.

The thermometers attached to the rods are centigrade divided to half degrees, and were read by rneane of a magnifying hand lens to tentl~s. They were made by H. J. Green, of Now York, and were compared a t the office in June, 1891, with Tonnelot thermometers 4655 and 4656. Bar 13 carries thermometers 1and 2. 14 carries thermometers 3 and 4.

On August 28 Green 5613 was substituted for 5616 (No. 4), the latter having been broken on that date after ita zero point had been determined. The corrections of these thermometers to reduce them to the hydrogen scale were determined in June, 1891, to be as follows:

Afeacrure?nentoj' Holton Bme wit),, the New Seoondary Base Apparatua.

The bars mere aligned during the ineasure~nent by bringing the rear end of tho rod over the starting point or into contact with the forward agate of the rear bar and keeping it there while the forward end of the bar was i~lignedby pointing a snlall telescope on a sigual usually xnciunted on the next eectiou stone ahead. A small aligning telescope is mounted on each bar 25 centimetreo from the front end. The base of tho uprights carrying the telescope has a sliding motion on an arc of a circle co~lceiitric wit11 the measuring rod. It carries a level, by mcitns of which it can be claniped in a horithrough the zontal position iu a vertical plane passing longitudi~~ally rod. I n order that the telescope may transit in this plane the adjusting screws of the base must be properly set. The ndju8tment was not made with satisfactory accuracy during the Arst measurerneut of the distance between ~ o u t h base and the fourth kilometre atone. On reaching this stone u second and more perfect adjustment was made. Subseque~~tly the deviatiolis from n straight line during this fractional part of the Brat measure were traced on the ground, and it was fouiid that tlie error due to the deviation of the measured line froin the base line amounted to not more than 1 part ill 15000000, which call therefore be neglacted. Experiments were made to determine the probable error of alignment of a single bar with the telescope adjusted as i15the remainder of the a be 3811. measures and it was fouud t
GROUND TRAVERSED.

The greater part of t,he measurement was over grassy soil. Several plowed fields were crossed. The surface of the ground near south base is broken, and between the 3 000 and 3 900 metre stoiie it is also very irregular. The first four measures of tho Standard Kilometre mere made when the soil was wet and springy, but during the measures mado on September 24 and September 26 i t was dry and hard. A distance of 200 metres a t each end of the Standard Kilometre is iu the open fields; the remainder is in the woods.
DUTIES PERFORMED BY MXMBERS OF THE PARTY.

Prior to September 21, during the messurementu, the bars were aligned by Prof. Gore, who a.lso, read the forward thermometer; the rear thermometer was read by Mr. Pennington; one vernier of each sector wrts read by Mr. Qjertsen, the other by Mr. Hayford, who also

kept the record and caLled 'a,ttention to any Apparent or real errors in the readings. After September 20 the alignments were made by Mr. Hayford. Throughout the work the contacts were made by myself, using a small lens magnifying 3 diameters;
SECTION MARKB.

The base and its sections, excepting the Standard Kilometre, were marked by lines traced a t right angles to the direction of the base on copper bolts set illto stones. Theends ant1 intermediate sectior~s of the Standard Kilometre were marked by sp11el.ical-beadedbolts, intended to be ueed in connectioh wit11 a so-called cnt-off'appamtus. This ap1)araLus consists of an upright uylinder having a conical recess a t its foot, which fits over the spherical bolthead. The cylinder can be revolved about its upright axis, and any deviatiou frorn verticality is measured by nieans of :in attached ~ p i r i level. t On top, and a t right augles to its vertical axis, the cylinder cerries a scale divided into inillimetres, b which an object over i t can be referred, and which gives its relation to the geometrical center of the bolthead. I n starting, the slide was usually clamped in coincidence with the index, and the knife edge was brought over the starting point by means of s theodolite or tra~isit sector moulited a t right angles to the base line. When stopping for lunch, a line traced on a copper tack in a stub in the ground served as a reference mark. The record of the measurements of the Holton base line with 5-metre contact elide rods Kos. 13 and 14 is contained in 3 volumes. Volume I, pages 1 to 230, and Volume 11, pages 1 to 68, contain the record of the base measurelllent proper, including two extra measurements of the Standard Kilometre. Volwne 11, pages 71-158, contains determinations of the length of the rods in terms of the 100-metre comparator. For description and . Woodward's report. details of this coulpsrator, see Assistant R. 5
LENGTH OF THE RODS.

The length of the rods wm determined immediately after the base meaaurenient by measuring the distance between the euds of the standard '100-metre comparator. The legs were taken off the trestles and the tripod heads carrying the wedges were screwed on substaiitial boards, which fitted across the track prepared for the iced bar carriage. In starting, the slide of the bar was clamped to coincidence. The knife edge was brought under a microscope mounted over one end of the 100-metrecomparator, and a poiliting was made with the microscol>e on the knife edge. The axis of the microscope was referred to the end mark by means of the cut-off nl)yaretus.

The measureineilt of the distance mas then carried on as usual, except that the tripod heads rested in the track, as above described. On remliing the other end of the comparator, \rliero aiiotlier microscope and cut-off' kppa)ratus were mounted, a spider threat1 was stretalied over the plane surface of the agate of the rod, a,ud tlic microsoope . pointing wm inade on the space, which was never niore tllsii about 20 lnicrolis in width, between the direct :~ntl reflected im:ige of' the tlireatl.
