Bodias Jsla11d, N. C., Novc1hbcr ~!>, 18·15. Sm: I have the ho;1or to present tho report of the progress nnd stnte of tl1e snrvcy of the ·coast, required by tho regulations, in' order. that it mny . be," laid before tho Prosidcut nnd CongrnsiJ. 11 · · " · 11he ruport contains, 1st, n brief statement of tho work executed by the· 1lilforcnt parties in the field; 2d, of tho otlice work, including the prepa· ration, engraving, nnd pnblicntion of mnps and charts resu~ti,11g from t.hu survey; nud 3d, n sketch of the work proposed for the ensuing year, with ~n estimate of the cost of cxecutiou. · . ·. ·.

gress for the past ycnr bns been satisfactory, either in reference to that of former years or to tJ-ic sum npproprintcd and expended. · · ·In regard to the estimate. for the next fiscnl year, I wo\1ld bespenk for it in nd vnncc n .fovorublc considerntion; it !ins been made carefully and nfrer due knowledge of the requirements of the different parties, and n · careful study of the operations ·which can be carried on to the greatest nd vnu tage in the course of the year. Any diminution of the sum there ailkcd must involve n dccrcaso in the amount of work which is practicable, nnd thus, postpone the realizing ·of the results of the survey on some portion of the coast, nnd the ultimate completion of the work. Operations are proposed which may certainly be ~1ccornplished with the prcs1211t scientific force, or with a very moderate addition to it. 'l'he uumber of pal'ties which may be employed aclvan· tageously in their execution is stated. '!'he actual expenses of such parties arc taken as the basis of the estimatc-expeuscs which ure limited as for as is consistent with the due pro'gress of the work- so that no party shall consist of more officers or men, or I.Jc supplied with more equipage, thnn is nbsolutcly necessary. '!'lie estimat1!s for computing, rcJuci11g 1 clmwing, cugraving, und printiug, nre rcgnlatc<l in a sin11lar way. 'l'o place these cstimutes upo11 n lower scale wo11IJ be, in the cuse of field parties, to risk the cessation of operntions <luring the worldng season, and thns to incur the ,cxrier.se of sularics without corrcspouc.li1ig progress in the work. It is sometimes supposed that salaried officers alone constitute the working parties of the survey. It is true that the scientific chief of each party is the essential person by wt1om the results arc ol.Jtuined, nnd who works with his hands us well as bis head; but there nrc also }JlHcly manual operations to be performed, requiring in each of the laud parties the employment of at least from four to six, nn<l in some cuscs teu a1iu twclvo men. 'l'he number of persous therefore ucccs8arily e111ployc<l in .the mechuuicnl operations of the survey is very considerable. 'l'hc increase of the nppropriatiou for the year 18 15-'4 li has cnablcU. me to commence operations effectively in two additional southern scc·tions-one in Nurtlt Varolhta nn<l 0110 on the Gulf of Jlt,:i:ico. 'rhis is a measure of economy, since.it gives employment in the fielll. duriug periods of the year when the parties can11ot be employed to the 111mh, a11J. as it advances the work towards completion. It is of public uiility, be. ·cause it must give, at.an early dny, charts of a portion of our coust but little known and dangerous to the navigator. Should the estimate which I furnish be adopted, the work will be extended from these centres, and a new southern centre Lo cstublishcd in ~oulll Carolina or Geort.ria, from which iu tum to extend the survey to meet the other purls of the work. '!'he estimate furnishes means for carrying on the survey of the coast effectively in the following named States: New Jlarnpsltire, .Massac/m · .<1tll11, Rhode l.v/allfl, Comwct-icut, New York, Nt:w .lenity, Pm111sylvu11ia, FJelmcare, Mrirylcnul, Vfrgin ia, Nortli Carolina, South C~trolina or Geor{{iu, Plorida, Alabama, Missi.tsi71pi, and Louisiana; in all, sixteen States. In sonic of them the work is ncurly finished, in others for mlvnnced, n11<l in others new c1mtrcs nrc to lJc occupied; from which the sur\'ey uiay be cxtcudctl 1111til the parts uuite. 'l'he southern coast must be· sun·cycu !Jy frequent bases conncctcu

'l'ho work promised to bo executed witbin the period embraced in this report has been nctunll y clone, and I may, thernfore, claim confidence in the promises uow mndo for the ensuing yenr. 'l'he amount of work clone i~1 the field an~ o.ffice has been greater in proportion th~n tho in· crease 111 tho oppropl'mllon of last year on that W'luch preceded it. Upon n $oneral review, that increase of work ca1111ot be taken at less than one~ tlllfc.l, nncJ the ncldi~ionnl means exceeded those of the former year, inclucling a bulanco of tlui year nexC preceding, but one.sixth.

If :lny incentive to exertion hml bcon rcrp1ir9J in this section of the work clnrin3 the past scnso11, it must hnvo been found in tho nccidc11ts <Jccurriug within tho knowledge of the different p'lrtics, from n wnnt of i11fiwmn1io11 i11 rognrd to the du11gcrs of this rut. of tho coast. 111 tho Viur'}':trd sound n ship pmpmccl fo1· n whnling voy:ige to tho Pncilic etrncl<, in goncl weather nllll with n fine nnd faii· breeze, upon a shonl off Holmes' Hole, and this ''esscl had not en ti roly been released from peril, to bo tnkcn into lrnrbor to refit, when n henvily loaded schooner struck near the saino spot. The injmy to the fir~t of these vessels woultl luwo pnid for ·.ho (lpcrations of tho survey in this qnnl'tcr 11101'0 than twice 0\'Cl'. rrl·lC ship .<Jcntnrion, Inst ou Nantucket south shonl during tho summer for wnnt of k11owlc1lgc of tlio extent of tho shonl nnd of the set mu\ drift of tho ti1.Jcs near and upon it, was it'rnurccl for n snm bcrond the whole nppro· pri:ltion fiir tllc field work of the year. These nro only a p:ut of tho 11cci- · do11ts whkh cH1c1mTed in this region during tho suinmcr, tile least dn11gor· ons portion of tho veur. '!'here pnssnd tlll'l)ugh tho Viucyar<l sound with. in the Inst three yc;u·s, (ns appears from nn interesting lcuor from.William .Mitchell, of Nantucket, nppended to this i·cport 1 nppcndix, No. Ir,) four · hn11drcd nnd forty.seven ships, three thousnnd six hupdred nn<l sixtyfonr brigs, twcnty·three thousand two hundred nnd sixty·two schooncrn, and nine thousand seven hun<lrod uud seven sloops; or n total of thirty. seven thousand and.eighty vessels.

nels, but not the' configuration. of the bottom generally' and, be!tides this, a vessel is often without a pilot when danger is nearest 'l'he coast survey will soon be able to supply the want of n good chart in this quarter. 1. 'l'lle primary tricmg11lation fo this section hns been ·carried from Narragansett bay eastward across Buzzard's bay, the Vineyard sound, and the sound between Nantucket nnd Cape Cod; then northword across Cape Cod and Massachusetts bays, where it meets the same work oarricd northward from Narragansett bay, nnd stretches to the hills which are near the northern boundary of .Massachusetts, nn<l iuto New Hampsl1ire. 'fhe diagram (sketch A) gives a sutfieiently correct iciea of the clw.racter of the triangulatiou, und of its connexion with the geographical features of the country. It rests upon the base mensurc<l by nssif:tant Blunt, on the Boston aud Providence railroad, ns shown by the <lotted lines in the diagram. It is co1111ectcd with the main triangulation, and carried eastward, ns indicated by the· lighter full lines, the line McSparran -Quaker Hill being common to the two triangulations. Passing eastward, it gives a suitable base (Cuttyhunk-Jndinn hill) for the sccondury triangulation; determiues an important point (Cuttyhunk) at the entrance of Buzzard's bay and the Vineyard sound, 11 point on Martha's Vineyard, a point on the island of Nantuckqt, 0110 on the ridge of Cape Cod, near Barnstable, one near the extremity of Cape Cod, one nt :Manomct point, near Plymouth; furnishes the base Manomet-Provincetown, for the secondary work; determines a station (Blue hill) overlooking Boston harbor, a point ('l'hompson's hill) near Cape Ann, nnd other stations suitable for carrying the work along the coast of New Humpshirc and l\Iaine. '!'he character of the country, in proceeding northward and eastward from Massachusetts, admits of a triangulation with sides of very con. sidcrable length, teudin1r. to nccuracy in the scientific rcsulrs, and to economy and rapidity in the practical 011es. At the s:.une time, by adopt· ing intermediate poinrs, a series of triangles is formed, fornishiug, di· rectly or by easy subsidiary operations, frequent bases for the SCC(·Jldary work, in addition to the co11sta11t cliccks presented by the positions of the primary points themselves. 'l'hus, for example, the <JUadrilateral formed by Blue hill, Wachusett, and Thompson's hill in Massachusetts, and Unkonoo1111<i mountain in New Hamp:;hire, has sides of from thirty to fifty-eight miles, one of these being immc<liatcly in the direction of the coast, and the stations nt the other extremities overlooking tho whole coast and t·o1rntry adjacent to it, to the north,vard nnJ eastward, while by the intermediate station of Holt's hill a cliain of lesser tria11glcs is curried lorward, of 'Vhich the angular poiuts overlook the adjacent waters and islands. In tlte cnse usc<l for illustration, the sta1io11s Blue hill and Prospect hill overlook Uoston harbor, its h·lands, and dependencies. 'l'he larger triangulation is m.trkcd on the diagram by the broader full lines, and the minor one by the narrower lines. This part of th'o work will be connected immediately with the observa· tory at Harvard University, Cambridge, nnd when completed will render directly available the aecmatc determinations for the longitude nnd lati· tude of th:i.t point, which have been the accumulation of many years of the labors of the Cambridge and Boston astronomers, and arc especially valuable to the sun·ey in reference to the difference of longitude between this nnd lforopcan observatories. 'rho tri:rnglo Blue hill, Prospect hill, Han·ard observatory,· makes thii; connexion.

'l'lle topogropllieal work in this section has included the head of Buzzard's buy, the eustcrn shore of the bay, the Elizabeth islun<hi, un<l part of .Martha's Vineyard island. It hllS covered nn urea of 01ie humlred and seventy.eight square miles, determined one hundred nn<l thirty-two miles of shore line, and one hundred nu<l scventy·oue u1ilcs of roads.

Boyce, assisted by Lieutenant H. 0. Pratt, of the United States nrmy. 'l'ho area of the two is about ninety.three sc1unre miles, and they iuclude more than one hun<lred and forty n1iles of sliore line, sixty·six miles of roads, and thirty·two miles of i;hore liue of ponds. 'l'he coast embraced in them is rugged n11d broken, with ultcrnations of rocky, sandy, nnd marshy shores. 'l'he face of the country is nn·. dulating uud irregular, with but little wood upon it, m1tl rc<J11iri11g nrnch labor to rcprnse11t itaccuratcly. 'J'hc season hns lwcn gc11erally favoral1lo for work, but high winds and fogs huvo prevailed at ti111es, during which die use of the plane table is <litlicult; nt such times the compass aud clwin have been used with good effect in nd vanciug the work. '!'his party was 11ot able to take the field until the begi1111i11g of Julie, owing to circumstances not necessary to he detailed here, but by great diligence the amount of work done has been satisfactory. 'l'hrough the liberal views taken by the Hon. Secretary of the Navy, in reference to the progress of the coast survey, rmd uu<ler authority of the act of Congress of 1807, the party ha$ had the use of the schooucr Wave bclongi11g to the Uuited States navy, and the faeiliiy thus uffonlc<l must uc t!llll· merntcd among the reasons .for the nmount of work done. 'l'he party wus transferred to Neupeugne beach, on the eastern cud of Long island, for the survey of an unfi11ished space there, on ~he 20th of October, a11d to Philadelphia, for the mcasureme11tsof tho wharves, &c., left uutinished there, ubout the middle of Noven1ber. Assistant Boyce wasi engaged lust wiuter in the office, in putting in ink the topographical work of the preceding season. . 'l'hree sheets, marked No. 1, No. lJ., and No. 4 011 sketch A, have been · surveyed by assistant II. L. Whiting, aided by !11r. W. K GrccnwclL. 'l'he area included in these is about ciglity·five square miles, and 0110 hundred and five miles in length of roads and one hundred miles of shore line arc laid down upon them. 'l'hc work on the runin was done lwtween the 8th of May a11d the close of Scpt{:.mocr, and about the lst of October tho party wns.rcmoved to· Martha's Yirwyard island, rcmai11ing in the field until the latter part of November. 'l'he face of the country 011 tlw main ·11as already bt.·eu described, and that o~J the Yiney:ml npo11 the i111mediato shore is similar; the country embraced in the interior of the sllcet is, on the contrary, level, and covered with woods of scrnb oak, interspersed with pines. The sickness of Mr. Whiting during ono part of tho season, nnd of a . number of his party at another, has in a 11cgree retarded the work, but

the progress hns, notwithstanding, been sntisfoctory, and tho amount of worlc done considerably <'xcec<ls thnt of tho Inst yenr. During tho wiuter Mr. Whiling was.occupied i11 tho office in finish~· ing tho c.lrnwings of his sheets of the previous scasc,n, mid in reducing for publication the mnp of Now Bedford harbor, tho style of the execution of which was very satisfactory.

It consisted chieily of the reduction of ouservatious of tides and currents and the copying of journals. The hydrogrnphy of Now Bedford harhor was reduced for publication, and a copy made of the origfonl chart 011 the working srule; u general reduction of the scasou's work was also made 011 the publication scale. 'l1hc sailing directions, and other u11fi11ished parts of the New Bcdt;1r<l · 'chart, have si11cc ueen supplied, and the work has bceu put iuro tltc hau<ls of the eugraver. .My attention has been rcpeate<lly ·.:alled by Lieuteu:mt com111u11di11g Blake to the necessity for thorough 1opuirs to the schoouer Gallatiu-rc· p:tirs which are entirely heyou<l the limits of expuuditmc permitted by the ordinary appropriation for the coast survey.

1. Prom. Narragansett bay to New 'York bay, mul tlumce to tltc capes of lite Delaware. ~. 1J1:lu10are river mid buy, und sol'lli of cczpe J11m, lopen. . . . I. 'rhe connexion of the priw-.ur!I triaugultJtion of Mr. Ha.;sler at its southern end, with the main triangulation across Delaware bay, by assistant Bluut,.was made only by secondary triangles. '!'he bay tria11gula· tion is remarkab.le for the beantifnl symmetry of its triangles, while the connectiug triangles, howevtr allowulilc in secondary work, were not suitable for the jmportunt purpose of making a j1111ctiou with a tria11gula· tion like that of Delaware bay. · rrhis triangulation has, besides, ussumed a new; degree Of importance, since it has been decided to curry the primary triangulation'across to the Chesapeake, nnd not down the Delaware bay. 'I'hc directions sanctioned by the Treasury Department in the spring of 18114 referred to the importance of a revision of this part of the work, but time wns not found during that year to execute it. It was accordingly made the first,duty of assistant Blunt on the opening of the present sea· son. ~!'he rcconnnisRancc was cornmet1ced iu l\lny, and was carried through under. 'many obstacles, and a suitable trinugulation deter111i11ed upon uud execittctl by the l.Jeginning of 8cptombor. . 'l'he triaugulation is shown in slrntch ll, where the stations arc marked B, 1845. 'l'hey arc six in number, three in Uelaware nnd three in JScw Jersey, with a seventh in New Jersey observed upon but not occupied. 'l'he number of angles measured was 17, and tho uumbcr of ol.Jscrvations made 530. At three of the statiom1 tripods of timber were erected, varying in height from 30 to 45 feet. 'l'he instrument was placed upon 'the top of the tripod, and the ob3erver stood upon a scaffold entirely dctnchcd from the tripod. The legs of the tripod were stiffened by braces paesing to the ground, forming lesser tripods, nnd by horizontal ties. It might be sup· posed that the warping and twisting of the timber of which the tripods were made, under the action of the sun and moisture, would sensibly affect the observations made from them, but this docs not appear to have been the case. '!'he probable errors of the separate observations deduced at the stations where the tripods were used, are not quite so great as of those at the other statious. Nor do the triangles containing two of the.angles measured from the tripods and one from tho ground, compare disndvnntagcously, in the error of the sum of their angles, with those in which one angle only was measured from the tripod and two from the ground. 'l'hese facts, if further experience should verify them, will have an im-

portant bearing in facilitating the triangulation in the southern sections of the rmrvey. 'l'hc nnglos of the triangles were measured with the twelve inch theo<lolitc of Simms. . . · S. V. '1'.ilcou, nssistnnt the pal'ty of Mr. Uhmt, resigned his positi·.m in the coast survey just after the openiug of the seaso1·1, and l\lr. J. P. Bolles was tcmpor3rily nttMhed to t!ie party to assist 1\Ir. Blunt. Obsc rvationn for :izinmth and ltititudo were made by assistant Blunt at one of the Delaware stations, markcJ Deakyne in the sketch, m the months of October nnd November. 'l'ho obsen·ations for nzimuth were taken by the elongations of the polo star, ihc Simms theodolite being t1sc<l for measuriug tho ungles with the elopgation mark. 'l'he observations for latitude were made with tho six inch Gambcy theodolite. 2. 'l'lta prir11cn·?1 tria,,r:ulatimi for counecting Mr. Hnssler's work with. the b:ise of verification on Kent island was in part in this section, but chiefly in the next, where it will he described. . 3. 'l'he work of lriangulation in this section is ncnrly complete. The only muller of importance which rcmnins, is tho verification of the work 011 tile eastern coast of Now Jcnioy. It is vrry desirable, if practicable, to co1111cct this work With tho primary triangula1ion which was carried across the Stale of New Jersey to the river Delaware, nnd southwai·d to· near Delaware bay. A 1·ccannaissam:e to examine the practicability of such a junction wn~ commcncc<.l in tho earlr, part of September, by Lieut. Henry Prince, of the United States army. fhc examination is a difficult one, and nothing positive cnn yet be lmown ns to its remits, the intcnticm being, if possible, to set at rest the question under revi.cw. 4. 'I'lw mr1guetic ob.~eroations iu this section, to be· communicated for the use of the survey by Professor Hen wick, of ·Columbia college, New York, have been coutinued. 'l'he charts of the harbors on Long Islaml sound, uow in progress, require accnralc obsel·vations of the variation of the r1ccdlc, and advantage has been taken of tho necessity for procudng these results to obtain at tlae sumo time, and without additional expense, others interesting to science. 'l'hu observations of this season have included the variation (decliuation) <lip, nud hr,rizmital ilHensity nt Stonington, Connecticut; Greenport, Long island, New York; Saybrook nnd Bric.lgeport, Connecticut; of variation and hori~ontal intensity nt New London and Sachem's head, Oonnecticnt; Drowned meadow nnd Sand's point, Long island, New York; ofyariation at New· Haven.and :Milford, Oo1111cct1c11t; and Black rock, New York. . · 'l'ho instruments used were Riddell's portable ·"'11(\'llctometcr'; by Jones, of London, aud a dip circle; by Uarrow, of London, uccessor to Robin· son.

'J'he shore iine near cape Henlopen, which was reported to hnve undergone changes, was also resurveyed. 'I'he W?rk extends south to Im.lian rh·er, and completes the data necessary for the chart of tho approaches and entrance to Delaware buy, which is now in the course of engraving. 6. 1'/ie o!f-s/101·0 work of this season, which was chiefly in this section, included the commencement of an examination of the gulf stream. A thorough exploration of the gulf stream is necessary to furnish information upon one· of the most important parts of the hydrography of the North American coast. To ascertain its limits at and below the surface, the direction and rnte of the current, its temperature at the surface and at dif. fcrent depths, the soundings in and near it, the character of· the bottom aucl other important particulars, with the i11lluenco of the se11so11s mid pro· vailing wirnls, will require much labor and great zeal un<l intelligcucc on · the part of those charged with the exec·1tion of the work. 'l'hc high temperature at and near the surface of thi:; tody of wntcr cu ables the 11avigatM to recognise his position on reaching it, when bound for tlic United Staks, and is one of the important uses made of this stream. \'ariouli causes interfere with the constancy ~1r' the imlications, as belonging to particular positions, and these shou!J be :nvestigatcd carefully, so as to gi vc certainty in regard to the practical couclusious or rules that must be furnished to the i1avigator. 'rhis work is not without risk, and was unavoidably delayed by the repairs required by the surveying brig Washington before it could be employed in such service. It was not possible to make these repairs from . the remnant of the small appropriation for the survey in J81 1'1-'1!5; but as soon as the ne\V npproprintfou was avnilable, the Washington wns put in charge of Lieut. Com. Uharles. JI. Davis, U.S. N., and made ready for the service. '!'he preparations were completed and the vessel left Now York on the 20th of July. 'fhe means of observing wero necessarily tentative, experiment heiug required to test the value of the methods suggested in the instructions; the duties, too, were in u great.measure new to the o!Jicers. 'I1he zedl and' ability of Lieut. Com. Du vis have supplied the place of experience in the modes of observation; and the methods themselves have been remarkably successful in his hands-having realized at the very first attempt some most interesting results. 'fhis is not the place to discu~s those results, nnd, iu<lced, it would be premature to grouud cour.lwsions upon the fow observations already reported; but the obvious utility of the facts developed, connecting, as they <lo, temperatures u11d souudings together, untl the ellicncy nf the means em· plored, as proved by the \'criiication of known Jaws of the tr:msmi.ssion of heat by co1Muction through n fluid warmed at or near the upper !'Urface, urc too remarkable not to give great cucouragement in 11rosccuti11g
the work.

'I'hese ,,bservations were nia<lc between the 8th of l\fuy nud the 6th of July, when Lieutenant Lee joiue<l rnc to assist iu tlie ob:;ervntio11s at the astronomical stations olrendy referred to in tho eastern ~ection of the survey, having executed Yery satisfactorily a co11si<lernble umount of work iu the brief time allowed him.

'l'ho course taken in this laborious reconnnisfmnce, in which Lieute11unt Prince has shown much persevering industry, ms well as aptitude for the work, was the followiug. 'l'he country northwest of· n !inc joining Washington und Baltimore was first examined; tll<l Elk, Patuxent, and 1\Jontgorncry ri<lg-C!s being explored to fi11d intervisible poiuts. 'l'his examim1tio11 proved that the counexion iu that <lire~tion could only be made by goiug far into the in· rerior.

Whc11 the variety of work thtis do11e is considered: it is obvious that it rcquirus no !.!mall shure of lmowledge, sldll, and iml11stry for its execution. ltcceutly, when it was desirable to e111ploy udtlitionul force to furnish the new buse apparatus, it was found very ditficult to obtain any aid, 1111d several instrument makers, who were applied to, declined uudcrtaking the wodc at all to lm executed by a spccitieJ time.

Dorgno nnd Pontchartrnin, than on other parts of our coast bordering or. the A thin ti~ ocean. '!'he .lakes are rather shallow, and ouly navigable for .l'esscls of ~ light draught; the tide, therefore, affords frequei1tly a irrent advantagb, or otherwise. But this tide seems to be governed altogether by winds; nnd at present no system hns been developed by which we mtiy form a correct idea or oven an approximation to the rise nnd fall. Under the head Y tides and currents," I have mentioned in my report some obse;rvntiou$ which were mnde by myself during my presence on the coast, and have· also referred to the charts of Mr. Blunt, who derived his infor· nmtion rc~arding the tides, I presume, from the surveys of Colonel Kear. ny and Lieutenant Powell. But those observations were necessarily con· fined ton limited period-Colonel Kenrny's register commencing with the 13th of i'\farch and c1Hliug with tlie Jst of May, J822, at Santa Rosa beach, Pensacol~, antl the notes of Lieutenant Powell, including from the Sth of Jannur}' to the 2d of Februury, 18'11, at Ship island. "It appears necessary to investigate, if possifJ!e, closely into the causes of the irregulurity; to observe for u long time not only the actual rise i.rnd fall, but also the direction and strength of the wind, the different formi· dable currents, their courses and strength, and form an itlea of their origin ~ then I believe we may be .able to establish gradually a system of coujec· tures bordering much nearer on truth t!inn all our present suppositions. To make any observations of this rort, I would provisionally name Mo· bile point, either Ship island east or the Chandcleur island north, aud the · Rigolets. · ,' "'l'he strongest '"and most irregular currents which I obse1·ved, were 11orth of the Chamleleur islands and south of Horn island and the Petit . Bois. An instance of the strength I have mentioned in the above named paragraph of .the report in the filling up of the Pelican channel. 'l'l)is is so extraordinary~ that it may be compared wi1h the alterations on the Suu<ly Hook beach, near New York. "11 he danger occasioned by this current is very great. Ou most places the soundini;s change from a considerable depth suddenly to slwllo\V water, and. tlle velocity of the stream sweeps tr.any a vessel out of her reckoning, nud she nuds herself without tho aid of light-houses, in dark nights, suddeuly out of nn nppareutly safe navigation, o·.1 Lars or amongst breakers, at the mercy of the wilu sen. "Another danger for the navigation on this coast is, the irregular point· ing of the need.le. In short disrunces, tho variation changes, according to records, materially enough to throw obstacles in the path of the n1ari11er. '!'he following notes were taken from charts: 0 18' E. "St. Joseph's, Blnnt's chnrt, 182(;, varintion G " " Lieut. Powell, is.11, " 7° 39' " "Mobile bay Dlunt 1840 " 7° 5' " " Balizc,. .' Illunt,' 1838,, " 10° 15' " ! "Ship island,· Lieut.

""l'hcse observations belong properly to the hydrographicnl part of thJ :survey, and were al ways taken simultaneously or even after the sound-

ings were made. This, ho\vevcr, might in future (without alluding to the past) occnsiou some delay in engraving the charts, as n much longer period for obtaining results will be required in tbc Gulf than in our east· cm waters ; therefore I would propose to take into consideration if w'e iuight not begin at once with such obser\'ations."

'l'ho history of this most dnn· gornns nnil fatill shoal is startling.

'l'ho honor of giving to this shoal its trnc locality belongs to Cnptain Jonathan Colcsworlhy, of this pince, who, on the 2·1th of Juno, 1821, made its lntituclc 41° 3' 55'1, it having, in all former time, been coJJsidcrcu to bo .'10° 44'. ; In looking over the docu· mcnts of Captain O., I nm entirely salisficd thnt, in tho old locntion, thcro arc forty fathoms of water.

" If we cou:d have the true account of the amount of property and Im· man life that the erroneous location of this single shoul I.as cost our country, not only prior to 1821, but subsequent to thnt period, the expense of the whole coast survey would seem a diminutive fraction. · 'rhc munner in which this survcv is conducted will settle this muller forever, bv re'moving all possible <lou bts." ·
