UOAST SURYEY 0FFif'E,

u., January 16, 1873. SIR: I have the 11011or to report 11en,with the progress made iu the survey of tile Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coast;; of tlu~ l;-nited States during the snn·csing-year 1871-'7~, which comprises, on both sides of the continent, a workiug-Heai:;on in uorthcrn sections, and another on sm1thern parts of th(~ coast, where all the fie](l au<l h,nlrographic parties are now engaged, as well on the Atlantic as on the Pacific sea hoard. For co11Yenient reference, the notices of opcrationi,; will Clo;;e, as heretofore, with the transfer of parties for the wi:1ter-sur\'ey:,;, which transfer occurr; in general about the 1st of ~fonmbcr of each ;rPar. l'he past year, though extremely unfavorable for snrYeying operations along the coa;;t, will ever be memorable in the annals of ou1· \vork. It included the voyage of the steamer Hasslel' from Boston to San :Francisco through the Strait of Magellan; the temporary occupation of points on the Rocky l\Iountains for special scientific purposes, which will be stated in detail i.u the bod.r of this report under the head of "Interior;" and an expe.<lition for determining the exact difference of longitude between Washi11gto11, D. C., and Greenwich. In each of these unclertakings, the S1uvey, without encroaching 011 appropriations made by Congress for developiug the coast, has enabled <listinguished sarans who ,·olunteered their senices to accomplish near results in se\·ernl importa11t, branches of knowle<lge. The steamer Hassler is now engaged in the regular hydrographic service, for which that \'C88el was destined, on the coast of California. In the course of the voyage, the obsen·atious made by Professor Agassiz, aml his conclusions from tliem, were communicated to me from time to time, ancl have been made known to the public through the columns of the popular press. It is gratifyiugto myself, and doubtless is so to many others, that the facts recently bmught to light by that great naturalistconftrrn the views which he had adopted after many years of thoughtful research. These being well known through bis published letters, only a general narrative of the voyage of the Hassler, (Appendix: No. 11,) written, at my request, by L. F. Pourtalei,;, assistant Coast Survey, will accompany this report. The steady advance of work in the geodetic connection between the Atlantic ancl Pacific coast.s, with the proviso for determining points iu States of the Union which make suitable pro,·ision for their own geological and topographical surveys, will, it is hoped, prove to be of great ser\·ice to the country. In the interior, the indirect benefit of the development of the coast is easily overl~okctl. Thought, consideration, and argument are rnquisite for the conviction that operations upon the seaboard are valua!Jle to States which have no coast-lines. But e\'ery facility in tlJe avenues of commerce, by diminishing rates of insurance and in other ways lowering the prices of foreign pmducts, may be just as important to citizens of Iowa, Kentucky, and Arkansas as to those of Massachusett:-;, South Carolina, aml Loui:,;iana. The safe transportation of three thousautl millions of domestic commerce, which make up the annual coast-trade of the Union, the produce and property of interior States, is more important to tl1c farmer than t-0 the merchant; yet, removed from the sigllt of tl1e owners, the safeguards of trnusit canntlt command their immediate attention. The moderate outlay })roposed for the geodetic connection between the coasts is directly ap1}licable to all the St:ites of the interior. Points used in the ·survey of the coast will ~mflice for the moat elaborate surveys that may !Je undertaken hereafter by the seaboard States. Irr like manner, 1mints determined in the geodetic connection will serve for fut,ure surveys of the interior States. The existing maps am imperfect, lmt no outlay for their improvemeut would be warrantable withlraHkington, ]),

out the essential ·groundwork of triangulation. In prosecuting- the geodetic connection, primary points are determined as far from each other as tht~ natme of the couutry will permit, or as far as signals ean he sPen. The combination of these forms a Rystcm of large triauglcs, hy which all the general po.;;itions of tLe country are Louml together in exact relahvc pm;itiou, and the wlwle constitnt£s what it:l known as a g·e()(letic survey. Such a system of poiuts applied to au imperfect map reveals the errors that exist near the points. }'or tiual topogrnpltical surn\ys intermediate poi11t8 :ue tfotermiued behn~eu the distant station:s. Tlie primaQ' tria11g11latiu11 requires perfect. instrn111e11ts, a1Hl olisernlrs or known aliility anll of the greatest experience. All snch work is subject to direct tests aH to its validity, and frequent Mrntiny has shown that the geodetic work of the Coast 15m·ny !ms been llone by observe1·s especially qualifie(l for this duty. Ju secondary and tertiary triangulation, i-;ueh extreme precii,;ion is uot imlispeus~tble; the determination of nearer points lwing checked, coutrolletl, and corrected by those made at the primary statiom;. The secondary work in the States can, therefore, he safely iutrusted to the hands of scientific citizens or rei;idents couuected with engineering: or other educational institutioris, who might in nunual vacations much ad\·a1iee the interests of tlle State b.Y determining intermelliate points. It is lit'_Yon<1 donut that iu rnauy instances the principals, when 'Jlmliflcd in the m;e of instruments, could enlist, imitable aill:s from the classes uudcr thei1· cbarge. In this way, the survey -iYill be efficiently as;.;oeiate1l wit.11 leading scientific meu in all parts of the country; the work may have the benefit of t heil' athice and co·operatiou, and be subject to their criticism. Tllis form of organization has been apprm·ed by m:my able minds, an<l bas been tried with admirable success in the !State of New Hampshire, where Professor Quimh~-, of Dartmouth College, has, during successiYe yacations, carried ou the triangulation of the State. His field-work duriug the sum mer will be noticed under the head of "section I in thit-1 report. \Vithout :mch co-operation, any sun·cys for dm·eloping the imlus· trial capacities of the several States must ueces:mrily be vague, inaccurate, an<l unsatisfactory. Ti.Je plan here suggested, besides giving opportunity for instruction in the most important })rob· h~rns of sun·e~·ing, wouhl gradually accomplish, with the utmost econom,y, a reliable survey of the entire Union. The annual appropriation requisite to carry 011 operations simultaneou15ly in every State of the Union is estimiited not to exceed $150,000; but several _years must elapse before the interest, now very active and pressiug in some of the States, becomes general. The interests of all reqnire that the co.operative phw, which enlist:.; so much exact knowledge in local geography, and wi.Jich is thereuy made speedily effective in fteld-work, sl1011hl be foRtered to the utmost. .My attention, therefore, ~will be given to every appeal additional to such as have been already made for the determimition of geographical points in the several States of the interior. LONGITUDE. The exact determination of the longitude of some point in the triangulation of the Coast Survey from the principal observatories of Europe forms one of the most important problems of tl1e work, and all the various means known to science have been successively brought to lwar on its sol11tio11. 'l'he Coast Snn·ey Ueports from 1848 to 1806 suow that the methods of moon-culmiwt· tions~ of curo11ometer-trans1;ortation, and of lunar occnltatious have each in turn recei\'ed a large share of attention. The latter method has not yet yielded the full rei-m Its that nrny be expected of it, in conse(1uence of the infrequency with which correspoudin g obsen-ations are obtained in l~urope and America, owing to the parallactic displaeement of the moon ; it cannot be doubted l10wever, that, with a suitably-organized system of observation, this method will in time give 1,esults of extreme exactness. Upou tlw successful completion of the Atlantic telegraph from Ireland to Newfoundland, measur<'8 wl.'re at once taken to make use of that means for the determination of the longitude lldwecn tlie two continents. The results of these operations, comlucted by Dr. B. A. Goultl, have been giwu at length in the ne1)ort for 1867. Although far more certain than the previous results, the Yaltie tlms obtained still left a larger margin of doubt as to its precision than is desira Lle to a<lmit in so fundamental a determination. This uncertainty, which proLably does not exooed a quarter of a second of time, is owing in part to theo11umber of intermediate stations that were necessarily emplo,yed, and in part to the fact that, though we can measure the total time of trans-

1111ss1on of signals through the cable and back again, we arn unable to separate the duration in O])posite directiom;, and are obliged to asirnme it r11nal-an assumption which may not he exact within a sensible fraction of a secon<l. \Vheu the laying of the French cable from Brest, i11 France, to Duxlmry, iu l\fassachusett~, afforded an independent means of verifying the former re<;ult by ouservations under entirely differ ent conditions, the opportm1it,y was promptly seized, and the longitude between Brest and Dnxbur.'f determined by Assistant G. IV. Dean, as set forth in tlie Iteport for 1870. At that time, no cable was yet in operation between Brest and England, so that J\lr. Dean was unable to carry his determination direct to the observatory at Greenwic!J. Such a cable lrnving since been laid, this wanting link in the chain of longitudes was snpplied tlnring the past summer by Assistant J. E. Hilganl, who temporarily gave up the charge of the Cmtst Siurny Office in orcler to bring this much-desired operation to a satisfactory conclusion. In re-occnp:ling Brest for that purpose, it appeared in ever.v way advisable t!Jat the experiments through the French cable should lJe repeated, this time with an intermediate station at Saint Pierre, where the long cable makes a landing. That part of the operations which connected Saint Pierre with Cnrnbridge was under the immediate uirection of Assistant G. W. Dean, and will he further noticed, under Section I, in the holly of this report. The genernl plan of op(~rationx was to unite at BrcRt 8ig·ualR from Americi~, from (}rccnwich, and from Paris, Rent nearl,y at. thB Rame time awl oomparetl b~- means of tlle Bt·e.'3t chronograph, and to determine the personal equations oft.he se,·ernl observers t!Jrough one of them 1 wlw slwuld obserYe sncc,essh·ely with all the rest. This wa8 done by 8uba8siiitant F. Blake, jr., who ah! y assisted l\'Ir. Hilgard in the detailed operations. Through the kindness aud assistance of Sir George B. Air~·, the a:-;tr011omer-royal of Englaml, mul of M. ])clammy, the 1fo,tingnishe11 11irector of the Paris oll;;:en·atorr, wl108c lamented death occurred while tlw opcrationR were in lH'ogress, and through t11e geuerouR conrte:o;y of the French Atlantic Telegraph Company arnl of the S11bmarine 'relegraplt Uom1·:tny, tlw work W;ts hr()ught. to a succP.ssful conclusion in Sept.emt.m-. The results will be found in Appemlix No. lJ. As part of tlie record of the Jear, I 11ere insert the brief statement of progress and remark.fl oil estimates, which were tramnnitted to the Department on the 30th of September: 111 the e8tirnates submitted for continuing the 8\UYey of the coast of the Uuit.ed States dnrin:; the fiscal year 1873-'H, the increase in the items for regular work on the Atlantic aud P~~cilic coasts arises partly from the absorption of the pay and rations of engineers for stea1rn~rs, which vreYiously stood as a separate item, and partly from increase in the wages demanded by tield-hamls on some })arts of the coast. The difticulty of engaging laborers at ordinary i·ates has not been general, though it has affected tlte operations of parties 011 both sides of the continent. It may be adde(l tlmt the two hydrographic parties, which we11t into opcmtion within the present .rear with new steam-ves>1eh1, one on the Atlantic side aml one on the westem coast, will somewhat increasr tl!e outlay for the uext fiscal year; hence, nlso, the 11eceRsitJ- for a small iucrcase iu tLe estimate for lie repair of yessels. The a<ldition of $14,000 in the item for transcoutine11tal tri:rngulation is rl'qnire1l to carry on the plan which was previonsly laid out. This iuclmles the determination in the interior of points in exact geographical relation to the coast. The requirements of the General I~aml-Offico in that respect baye been already met iu several instance:-;. It is again confidently submitted that a timely moderate outlay for that object is needful to prevent confusion and waste of me[tns in the joining and adjustment of future surveys of the interior. From these explanations, it will be seen th1tt, a,lthollgh a tlecilfoll increase in compar.1tive results may be expected from the operations of the fiscal year 1873-'74, the e!'.timates do not contemplatt> a~y enlargement of the organization or of the plans for work. In further illustration of the detailed estimates, an ahstraet is here given, mentioning the site~ which have been occu1)ied by surveying-parties in the field or afloat since the 1st of November, 187L. In the northern sections of our Atlantic and western coasts, the field and hydrographic operations are yet in progress, and, as usual, will be continued lfntil the approach of winter, when transfers will ~ made, as heretofore, for continuing work iu the southern sections.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDE:XT OF

Surveying-parties are now engaged, either in triangulation, topography, or hydrography, on the coast of Maine, at Bass Harbor, l\fountDesert Island; at Blue Hill Bay; on the islands between it and Isle an Haut Bay; and in the vicinity of Castine, for the survey of the east side of Penobscot Bay; on the west side of that bay above and below Belfast; and in Penobscot Bay north of Islesboro; on the western side of the Kennebec, in l\1aine, for the determination of geograpllical points; and or like service in New Hampshire. Special astronomical obse1Yations have been made at Cambridge, Mass., to determine the precise relation in longitude uetween points in t11e United States and points in Europe. One of the parties in that service occupied a station on Saint Pierre, Miquelon Island. The magnetic elements have been determined at stations on the coast of .Massachusetts. Special examinationR have been made to verif~' the sailiug-directionR for harbor-charts of the coast of New Englaml. Tbe tides ha\'e been recorded constantly during the year at North Haven, in Peuobscot Bay, and at the Charlestown navy-~·ard. A l1ydrographic party is now at work uear t11e l\fonomoy Shoals; and offshorc_soun dings have been contrnucd along U1e northern sectionsoft.hc coast. The plane-table survey of the coast of Rhode lslarnl iR in progress near Perrysville, west of Point Judith, and also the detailed sun·ey of Ne\\· Haven Harbor. Views have been drawn for the charts of sew~ral harbors between Portland a11d New York. Special hytlrograpbic in'\'estiga.. tionR are in progress in New York Harbor and in the aqjacent waters, and the tides have been steadily recorded at Guvernor's Island. A fieM.-part,y is engaged in the survey of Lake Champlain, ancl others are sounding itR northern brrmches. Triangulation is in progress near Barnegat, aml plane table work and 11yllrography near Little Egg' Harbor, on tlte coast of New .Jers<~.v. PointR have been determined for the construction of a comparative chart of the Schn~·lkill Riv<>r at. Philadelphia, for which tl1e soundings were made last winter;and the magnetic elements Lave hen determined in that vicinity, and also at 'Vashiugton City. Tlw tides have been regularly reronle.tl at Oltl l'oint Comfort, Va. Geodetic reconuaissance is in progress uear Harper's Ferry. The (fotailed survey of the JameR River, Virg"inia, has been ex1en dell upwarll to 'Yarwick River; that of ramplico Rh-er, at Washington,~- c., has been COUlJ.lleted. and alRo that of the lower part of Pungo Hive1·, and of the Yicinity of Uedar Island, in the lower part of l'amplico Sound. In that sound, the main tria11gulatiou has beeu extended, and progress has ueen made in the soundings. Cape Hatteras haR been incl111letl in a resurvey, which reveale1l changes in contour; awl recent soundings deyelop the clangers to navigation at the Hatteras 81wals. Plane-table work l1as been completed at Bear Inlet mtd Brown's Inlet on the coast of Nortl1 Carolina; arnl the 8<fferal channels leading into Uape I·'ear Iiiver have been sounded, LittlP ·iuver entrance, near the boundary-line of South Carolina, has been examiued, and much of' the coast-line traced southward to connect with a detailed survey; which now includes the shores of \\'inyith Bay. The survey of the Sea-islands and channels between Coosaw River and Broad Rivrr, South Carolina, has been well advanced toward completion; and the sea-water channels inside of Saint Simou's Island, on the coast of Georgia, and lletween Talbot Island and Saint John's River, 11m-e been sounded. Latitude, azimuth, and the magnetic elements were determined at a station on Saint Simou's falaml. The measurement of a primary base-line 11ear Atlauta, Ga., aIHl the determination of' points in geodetic connection with the line are now in progress. Along the eastern coast of Florida, the survey south of Matanzas Inlet, including the branches of l'tfatauzas River, iR well advancfld toward Mosquito Inlet. Below Cape Canaveral, a shoal has been developed uea.r Indian Hh·er Inlet. Soundings have been continued in the approaches to. the J<'lorida Reef and in the Gulf of Mexico; a.nd the insliore hydrography has been completed at the eastern approach of Saint George's Sound, as, also, the survey of the Gulf coast between Saint Andrew's arnl Mobile entrance, including Cboctawhatchee Bay. The hydrography has also de· vcloped the approaches from deep water to the Mississippi Delta, a.ml the vicinity of Trinity Shoal off the coast of Louisiana. In the Mississippi River, the surves has advanced from Magnolia upward to Jesuit Bend, including determinations for latitude and azimuth. On the coast of Texas, the hydrography has been continued in San Antonio and the adjacent ba~·s; atl<l the longitude of Austin has been determined. Sherman Station, in WyQining TerritorJ, and Ver<li, on the Union Pacific Railroad in Nevada., have been occupied as points in the geodetic oonnection between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts; and collateral observations of moeh interest have been recorded.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

On the western coast of the United States, the following sites have been, or will he, occupied in prosecuting the field and hydrographic operatiqns now in progress, in accordance with the 111an of work for the season. The parties arc all in the field, and will, as heretofore, report their n· suits at the end of October. Progress has been made in tlrn h,rdrograpbic recomutissance between Panama aml San Dil·go. The station near Cape San Lucas, at which the transit of Venus was observed in 17G!l, will Ill' determined in latitude arnl longitude. At San Diego, tile tides have been constantly recorded. The survey of the coast of California will be resumed at San Pedro Bay; tllat of the Santa Barllara Islands has lleen continued; and tlle cL·est-li11e of the mountains which range along the Santa Barbara Channel has been traced; reconnaissance has determined suitable points fur tile triai.gnlation between Sauta Barbara and Monterey; the snryey of the coast is well ad nrnce(l hetwe(·n Point Conception and Point Arguello; also south of San Luis 01Jispo toward Point Sal, and south of San Simeon ; and tlw latitude a!Hl azimuth will be determined, if practicable, at uotlt sites of' work before the close of thti season. In the operations of the year are inclnded the 8UL'H'Y of the South Farallon Island, and the outline of Raml-llrift on the San FranciSlj> Peninsula; the con tom of '£able J\Iouutain north of the Golden Gate; comparaiiv<' ROlllHlings at San Francisco eutranee; and tlie tides of tlle year at that port. Cordell's Hank will be develo1wd by sounding.~ in the course of the season; at l\Iernlocino Bay, latitude and azimuth will be determined, and the surn·y in iirogress in that Yicinit.r will be extended northward. l\Iagnetic olJsernttions will be made gm1eral1y at stations which may be occupied by tbe astronomical party. Som1diugs ha,·e heen made to deYelop a bauk off Cape Mendocino ; the survey of the coast uelow Shelter Uo\C is in progreRs; latitude and azimuth will be determined there, and longitude at :E1ireka when the telegral'h reaches tllat placf'.

At Astoria, the tides of the year have been recorded; and ]ongitade will be <letermined when telegraphic faeilities reach that port. The snrn.r of llotlL shores of the Columbia Ri\·er has heen continued, and that of Shoal water Ba;y in "·al'hington Territ<wy. At False Dungeness, tbe astronomical station has been eon1wcte1l with thP tri:rngnlation of thP Strait of Puca; ana Smith's Island has been octmpie<l for complP,ting the main triangulation, which embraces the waters of Washington Sound. 1'he plan for tllis RCflROn i11cltules also tlPterminationR of latitude and aziurnth at Steilacoom and Dwamish Bay; the st·lcct.ion of a site for a ha:'le-line on Whidbey Islam] ; mul triangulation for exte111li11g· the snr\·ey in Pugd Sonnd. On the coast of Alaska, good progress has been made i11 tlie hydrographic reco1rnaissam·P. Observations of mncl1 im11ortance have been ma1le on the ti1lf's a1Hl cmTt·nt,c;, aml a number of geographical points have been determined. The office-operations in drawing and c11graving haxc he.en kPpt np with the rPsnlts ill field·"·ork and hydrography. Twenty new charts have been published, and nine others which show ext.en~ive additions in comparison with tlleir first issue. Fifty charts, of which tliirteen ii-ere commenced within the year, have been in hand in the Drawing Di\-ision. Of the engrn\·ed clwrts, 11,500 copies have been printed and distributed. Ninety of the manuscript.maps 011 1ile in the archives bm-e been copied within the ;year, to meet calls for information. As these usnall,y pertain to places near the more important ports, a few of the topographical :,;beets showing much Yariety in details liarn been reproduced by lithography.

Gcoddic connection.-The triangulation across New Ilampshire, ·which was commenced lm;t year, lws been continueu during the present season by Prof. E.T. Qnimhy. As before 8tatctl, the mnin ol~ject of thifl work is to connect the ;;nrn~y of Lake Champlain with that of the coast, nml incidentally to snpply points as sanctioned by Congress for the geological and topographical operations that may bf\ undertaken in future by the St:tte. The last-mentioned part of the serYice lias been g-reatl.Y simplified h;y the wise and liberal action of the State legh;lature. l\Iention was made in my last annual report of ~t plan pmposecl for inducing tpe several to,vns in New IIampNliirc to erect, at tlieir 0\\'11 expense, the tertiary signal.-> ret1uisite for the local survey. Recently,-, that plan has been much eularge<l. Through the rt'presentations of Pmf'essor (~uim hy, showing the Yalne of uumerons wcll-est.alJlished geographical positions for the future construction of a map of the State, the legislaturn passe<l au act, which was appro;-e<l by the go\·crnor ,July 3, 1872, authorizing the assistant in charge of triangulation on the part of the Coast Snn'ey " to set snch signals as mas be necessarr, at an expense not to exceed $'.:O, in any town or city of tlrn State, a,n<l to draw upou the State treasure1' for the sums so expended.'7 This prompt acceptallce of the policy of Congeess, on foresight of the benefit which must follow as well to each State of the Union us to the pu1Jlic service audits economical a<lmiuistration, wm serve as an example to induce other States to co-operate with the General Government in a work of such \'ast importance as la_ying in time the sure foundation for an accurate map of onr country. Professor Quimby resumed tleltl-work on the 1st of l\Iay, and devoted some weeks to reconnah;sance aud to tlle erection of signals for tlle extension of' quadrilaterals in the direction of Lake Champlain, and of others to include important points in tbe State. The measurement. of angles was commenced on tlie 1st of June at l\Ionadnock, one of the primary stations w 11icl1 was occupied in the s1un'y of the con st. Work was continued at all fayoralile interYals. In reganl to progress at that time, Professor Quimby rPports, "The month of June \ms ,-cr;r nnfayorahie, \Tith sc,ll'cely more than a dny in a week of good observing-weather. In .lul;r antl August, the weather was more favorable; bnt still the raiuy days were about equal in num lwr to the fair ones." Field-work was continued until tlie 1st of Sctltemher.

"The haud-log (a large gratiug) was thrown every lmlf.hour, the ship'::; bead being at each time noted. In twekc boms and a half, the vessel hat! swung once about her anchor. During this time, there was no slack water, the ve1ocit.r of the tide being not less than one knot. The motion of the Ship's liearl was uniform, passing from east through sonth to west, north, and east agaiu. At inhwvals, unequal tide-rips moved np against the current, and these passing slowly from aft forwa,rd temporarily augmented the Yelocit.y of the current sometimes to 2t knots, and as a consequence the Ycssel would shear abont. The rips passed ahead, disappeared gradually, and the current again di~in~ed. Several tide-rips we1'C frequcutl.r in sight at the same time, the appearance being like tha\()f agentle swell breaking in very shallow water. The surface of the sea was white and broken, anll t~ n-0ise, like that of b1·eakers, was audible at a great distance."

In the autumn of 1811, my atte11tion was called to the opening of a new inlet through tLe Na11tnckH Bradt, and the raYages of the sea upon the mainland at Chatham. I visited the locality, aml made arrangements for recording the progress of the changes from time to time. l\fr. l\Iitcbcll, to \l'hom tlie "·ork was as,:;ig11ed, as maki11g part of the physical history of the coast, has since made his first n·port on tl1e snbject.

Tidal ol1sen:ations.-At :~forth HaYen, on one of the Fox Islands in Penobscot Bay, the self registei'ing title-gangP in drnrge of l\Ir. J.C. Spaulding lias recorded the tides of tl.Je year. Tlie deeitled rt·gnlarity of tlte CUl'\'t\A tracetl by the apparatus shows that the station was '1-ell chosm1. Owiug to the accnurnlation of-i<;e around tl.Je pier at Korth llan~u, the continuity oftlie series was several times endangered; but, notwithstamling several short stoppages, tl.Je care and patience of the oosernr secured the record of all tlrn high and low waters. In place of the ol<l. one, a new gauge has been snbstituted at this station, the construction of which includes the latest device for meeting the difiiculties that arise from the forma.tiou of ice arouncl the modng i>arts of the self-registering apparatus . .A full series of meteorological obsen·ations was recorded at North H1wen. At the Charlestown navs-yanl, (Boston,) Mr. H. Howl;iud b,1s continuecl the series of tidal and ?neteorological ol>sel'\·ations. During tile severe col1l of hist winter, tbe old self-registering gauge, hitlicrtn relied on for mait1taini11g the series, freqnently stopped. At such times, the record was continued with the glycc1ine-gange, at the s:tnw station; l.Jut this, being less sensitive under the rise and fall of the water, g·ives a result only approximately correct. To guard against the gt·eat liability to ;;toppagl'S and co11se(jlWH t breaks in the record at Charlestown, heating-apparatus has liee11 attached to the old g:rngt:', similar to the device found neces:sary for maint:tiuing the regularity of the tidal sflies in Penobscot llay.

difference in longitude between Greemvich, England, and tlte ob;;ervatories at Cambridge and \Vashington, in the United States, has been well determined within the season. The general plan of operations was prepared by Asi;h;tant J. E. Hilgard, who con<lucte<l tlw observations requisite in Europe. Tlwse made at the western end of the Frencli .Atlantic ca bk were directed by Assistant George"·· Dean. Professor ,Joseph Winlock, director of the Cambridge obscrnttory, co-operated with the Coast Survey observen;; aml, under the direction of Hear-A<lmiral Sands Superintendent, Professor William Harkness, of the United States Naval Oln.;erYator~· at ·washington, interclrnnged signals for longitulle with the ohserYers at Camb;idge. At the outset, the general plan was to place Coast Snrwy olJisen-ei's at two astronomieal stations, one at DnxlJury, l\Iass., and the otlwr at Saint l'ierre, l\liquelou, where the l"reueb telegraplicable first touches American ground. ~<\.ssistant Edward Goo<lfe11ow reacbe<l Saint.Pierre on the 22d of l\iay, and was recei rnd with marked kindness by the French goverument otlicials, who unremittingly afforded eyery facility possible for the work requisite at the western end of tlie tt-kgTapbic line. Unfortunately, the li11k which passes from Saint Pierre to Duxbury was broken on the :!~th of' May, and in c011Reqnencc i~ cliauge became necessary in the plait, arrangenwnts lrnYing lweu ma-1l<\ lll'eviomsly for recording upon chronographs at Cambridge and \Yashington the 1011gitiule-sig11al:o;~"·hich pais,.;ed from the east through the station at l>uxlmr,y. At tlte reqne,.;t of' Assistant DP.an, the use of land-wires to communieate with J\Iiqne]on was concedell, fret· of charge, by General Thomas 'I'. Eckert, superintemlent of the \Yestern Union lines, and uy JI. JI. "\V:ml, <·sq., snperiuten<lent of the :Sew York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph. 'l'lw same officers, H>: in pnwions i11st:rnces;, co-operatrnl in om· work by the detail of operator8 at the Ren·ral stations. As the "\Vestern Union Company nse the" olo8e1l telef!raph-circnit," while the l,owlon Compan~· operators use only the "open circuit,'' the local managers, ai the instance of 1\Ir. Dean, made tlte arrangements requisite for success in the desirell interchange uf si~nals tltrong-h the telegraphic wires. Some delay occurred in consequence of a defect in the main French cable near Brest; but several series of signals for longitrule-difference were snccessfnlly e:xcl1a11ged hetll'een Snbassistant I<'. Blake, jr., at Brest, on the coast of France, and J\lr. Goodfellow, at Saint Pierre, on the night of the 9th of ,July, and on each subsequent nigllt fayoral1le for obserdug stars, making si>YPn nigl.Jts in an, preceding tbe 24th of July. In recording longitude-signaJs, "perisoual and instmmental retardations" were carefully noted by .A.ssista,nt Goodfollow and Suuaso;istant Blake: Tlie l!cingth of the telegraphic cable between Brest and Saint Pierre is abont 2,:190 geographical or 2,%0 statute miles. For difference of longitude between the extremities of tlte main caule. tlrn result. found from tlte observations is, in time, 3h 26m 4fi".2 right ascension. On the 21st of July, clock-signals were successfully exchanged by telegraph bet, ween Saint PierN', Cambridge, and Washington, and by the !lth of August the observers at the tliree stations ha<l satisfactorily interchanged signal!> on eight nigl.J ts. The aggregate length of telegraph line used in these operations is about 1,575 miles, of which 220 milesare under watn iti passing frorn Saint l'iene to North Sidney, on Cape Breton Island. In the excLanges between Cambridge and Saint Pierre, two "telegra1Jh-repeaterN" were in the circuit, one at North Sidne_\· and 011e at Saint .Tolin, New Rrnuswick . .An additional repeater was used at Boston in exchanging between l\Iiqnelon an<l \YaHhington. }~or difference of longitude between Saint Pierre and Cambridge, the result found is, in time, fiBm 48".8 right ascension . .At Saint Pierre, l\Ir. Good follow recorded 510 transits of 91 zenith and circumpolar stars with the 45-inch transit-instrument. The magnetic elements were at iutervahl determined there b.Y his aid, Mr. A. H. Scott. While these observations were iu progrnss auroras were frequent, and decidedly influenced tile suspended magnets· .Assistant Goodfellow specially acknowledges obligations for the facilities afforded to him by John Gott, esq., superintendent of the French cable station at Saint Pierre, and by his assistant, 1\lr.

The astronomical station at Saint Pierre was carefully marke<l b,y a eut-grauite post, in tbe top of which was inserted a copper bolt. Hy gemletic measurements, tlle station was also referred to Galentry Head lighthouse. In order to pro>itle facilities for determining the 1)erso1ml eq nations of all the obsen-ers engaged in tilis work 7 and for ascertaining whether the collimation of the instruments was in a11y way affected l1y flexure of their tra11sit-axes, Assistant Dean erected, b,Y permission of the Director, a temporar;r station in the grounds of the Ilarvard College ollservatery. I ts exact position is 39 feet north, or iu latitude equal to 0".39, aml 7il ..'i feet, or equal to 0''.US, or 0 8 .07, longitude, west of the great meridian-' circle of the obs;ervatory. At the temporar;y station, a 46-inch tl'ansit-instrument was .firmly adjusted on granite piers, aud 504 ollservations 011 the transits of 97 zenith and circumpolar stars were recorded by the obserYer, ~Ir. Edwin Smith, of the Coast Survey, under the <lirect.ion of Professor \Viulock. Wilen signals for longitude were exchanged, the clock-corrections were also carefully determined by the assistant obsen-er in Cambridge observatory, Prof. W. A. Rogern. For determining the personal equa.tio11 of' the several obserYers, the tramiit-instrumeuts which liad heeu used at Br('st an<l Saint Pierre were brought to CambridgP, aud carefully adjusted on bricl' piers in a line north and sonth ·with the transit used in the ternporar,y ohs1w,·atory. Tile three instruments were alike in size and constrnctiou. Early in September, Professor Harkness, of the United States Navrtl Ohservittory, joiued l\Iessrs. Goodfellow and Itogers. ObserYations were condacted through se\-cral nights; eaeh :u;tronomer determining the correction of the same clock lly ohserdug t,Jie same stars, and also b;r noting the transit of the same star upon alternate taUies or groups of five lines. The merillian-circle of the Cambridge obsen·atory an<l alternately one ot the three ·:16-ineh transit-instnmients of the Coast Survey were used in these oLscrnttions. About !10 transits were note<1 hy Pach of the obsernirs for personal equation.

progress in the -vicinity of New York City, the results given by the recorded series of tidal observations are of vital conser1nence. In order to determine the relations of the tides of the inner harbor to those of the connected waters, it will be necessary to have simultaneous observati011s at other points. With this requirement in view, two tide-gauges ha·e been made on a new plan, with single cylinders. One of these instruments will be put up at Sandy Ilook and the other on the wharf-line at New York City.

Topogra11hy and hydrography of James River, firginia.-The detailed suryey of tlie James River was commenced near ~ ewport .News on the 12th of December, 1871, by the party of Assistant J. 'V. Donn. "Because of the severity of the winter, it was necessary, for tlie safety of the Yessel and for ordinary comfort, to occupy tlle earlier part of tlie season in work on the estuaries of the river. Pagan Ureek and its brancbes, and a margin along the south shore of the Jaurns Rh~er for several miles above and below the mouth of the creek, together with the hydrography of the immediate vicinity, were surveyed hefom tlle clo~e of the winter. As soon as practicable, the work was resumed and continued without serious interruption until the approach of summer. Frequent gales of wind pre. Tented rapid progress, as dill also the occasionall,y riolent cnrrents in the ri\'er.'' Mr. Donn's survey includes both banks of the .Tames River, ancl soundings witbin tbe riYer-conrse for about fifteen miles above Newport News. His operations for the season in this section closed with the survey of \Yarwick Rin"r awl part. of l\lulhe,rry Island, which sqiarates it from the main stream.

Hydrogra:plty of Bliza'/JetltRiver, Virgfoia.-011 t,be last return oftl1e steamer Bibb to Norfolk, after heing in seryice ~n the Hatteras Shoals, as will be mentioned under the head of Section IV, the vessel was founll to be no longer sea-worthy. In order, therefore, to complete the working-season for which tlte crew hail been engaged, Acting- l\faster Rouert Platt was directed to sound out the main clmnnel and the e;.,tuaries of Ji;lizabethlUver. This service occupied the party during November and December, and the hydrograpby is yet in progress. Acting Master Platt, aided by l\fr. J. B. Adamson, determined points along the shores to guide in the soundings. Arrangements haYe l>een made for the shore-line survey tliis winter, to inclnde the river and its branches.

Geodetic connection.-I~ecounaisstmce 11as been made for extending the primary triangulation from the Blue Uidge westward toward the Ohio River as part of the geodetic connection between the Atlantic coast aud the Pacific coast of the United States. Assistant A. T.

line joining Maryland Heights aml Mount Marshall. Mr. Mosman reports that it is practicable to carry the main triangulation through to the Ohio RiYer along· the fortieth parallel, but suggests the examination of the country along the thirt,y-ninth parallel prnious to tlrn determination of points in the geodetic connection. Mr. Mosman had been previously engaged in Section Y, where he is now in the field. :\Iention of his occupation during the early part of the year will be made under that head. Tidal obseri1ations.-The series of tidal observationR, with a self-registering gauge, at Olu Point Comfort, Va., has been continued by Mr. \V ··J. Bodell. Few interruptions have occurred within the year; though in former Reasons the series was broken by causes which have been mentioned in preceding reports. The apparatus is good; but, owing to the deca,y of the parts of tbe wharf leading to tlle pier on which the gauge is placed, it will soon become necessary to mm·e the inRtrument to the steamboat-wharf.

1'riangulation of Pamplico Sound, Sorth Carolina.-In continuation of field-work in this section, Assistant G. A. Fairfield reached Newbern in the middle of Decem bcr, 1871, and without delay fitted out the steamer Hitchcock for the use of his party. The first duty "Was to furnisu 11oints for t11e topographical party of .Assistant Iardclla, who had been directed to Rurve_')- the vicinity of Cedar Island. At one of the southern lines of tile triangulation of Pamplico Sonntl ::\lr. Fair1leld started, and at intervals determined stations as far soutlnrnrd as II all's Point. The inter1tion was to push the triangulation so as to connect with stations on Core Sounu; but, owing to very stormy weather aud the necessity of providing points for another party in Pamplico Sou111l, the connection was impracticable. The triangulation desired will be made by au adYance from the southward. After computing the positions determined along Cedar Island, Mr. Fairfiel<l took up the triangulation of Pnngo Rinir, and extended that work to the heatl of navigation at LeechviHe, where the party closed operations on the 1st of May. The remainder of that month was occupied ll,y Assistant Fairfieltl in reconnaissance for further extending the triangulation so as to incluue tlle main body of Pamplico Sound.

"IQ order to represent properly the approaches t.o the city and its intricate wharf-line, as well -a~ the numerous obstructions, natural and artificial, in the ifrer, the sheet was projected on a scale larger than those representing the main part of Pamplico River. This provision was fortunate, as, wb~n the work was nea.Tly complete, application was made by tbe mayor, U.

To1)()uraplty of Pungo River, North Carolina.-The party of Assistant Dorr, in the Hetzel, the hulk baYiug been towed by the _.\rago, reached the mouth of Pungo River on the 12th of ~larch. Unfa·orable wcl1thcr, which had some time prevailed, impeded work with the plane-table during seTeral snccessiYe weeks, but the lower sheet of Pungo River was finished early in l\fay. The detailed snr\""ey includes the banks of the main stream and its branches as far up as Pungo Creek, ou tlte west side, and Duran's Point on the eastern side. "Pungo River is nearly 3 miles wide at its mouth, and nowhere less t!Jan 2 miles in width as far up as Dllran's Point, a distance of about 8 miles. Although long shoals make out from the Yarious points along the river, the channel is wide, and 3 fathoms can be carried as far up as tlw moutll of Pungo Creek, beyond which the work will be extended in the course of next
Heasou."

After closing work, the retLun of the party was delayed by calms; but, on the arrh·al of the re\ euue-cutter Stevens, Captain Abbey kindly took the Hetzel in tow. The hulk was laid up as usual at 'Vaghiugton, ~. C. ~Ir. 'V. E. McClintock served as aid in the party of Mr. Dorr in this section, aml :tlso in Section 1, tlndng the summer.

Topography of Cape Hatteras, }.,7 m·tli Carolina.-Assistant C. T. Iardella commenced on the coast about four miles north of Cape Hatteras on the 16th of January, and prosecuted field-work until tile middle of February. Hea>y gales then setting in made it impracticable to continue the snn-ey. His party was consequently transferred to another intended site of work, the details of wl1ich will be mentioned i)resently. Field-service was resumed near the cape on the 17th of April, and was closed on the 3d of :May. The returned topographical sheet shows Hatteras Inlet, Cap-0 Hatteras, and the iuterYening coast. In reference to changes in the shore-line, Assistant Iardella reports, "On tLe outer beach, at the extreme end of the cape, the shore has been washed away 612 meters, while the cove has :filled up 250 meters." "At East Inlet, land has made out 770 meters, but nearly the whole of Fort Hatteras has been washed away within the year. 'Vhere the Commissary was recently, there is now a depth of 9 feet of water. But little change has taken place at West Iulet. The southern point has made out 300 meters since the previous survey, and the north and south points have shifted eastward to about the same distance." Mr. Iardella determined, and marked on his plane-table sheet, the positions of the ten buoys w bich mark tbe sailing-course from sea, tbrougb Hatteras Inlet, into Pamplico Sound, The general statistics of this work are: Signals erected and determined. .· . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · · . . . . · · . . . . . . · . . . . . . 9 Shore-line surveyed, (miles) ... _..·.....··. __ - .... _. . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44 Roads and water-courses, (miles) . . . . . · . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . · · . . 30 Area of topography, (square miles) ..·..··.......................... -·-...... 15

Hydrography of Pamplico Sound antl itM Bii·ers.-Assistant F. F. Nes took commam1 of tlie steamer Arago on the 20th of January. After a short trial-trip, to prove the engine, tlrn \·essl'l was started from Baltimore, but was detained some days b~- ice, aud dill not reach Newbern until t!H' 17th day of February. In the course of the SPasou, three sites of work were occupied by the party. Assistant Dorr haying fnrnished a tracing from his sun-ey of tlie lower imrt of Pu11go Hin·r, soundings wer·e commenced without delay, and wer1·, continued nutil tlle Arago was dri\·en from her anchorage by a hca\·y gale that occurre!l early iu 1\Iarcli. On his arri\·al at \Yasl1iugtou, N.

Five uunsnally cold llays were employed in this work, which was pressed at the request of the city-authorities, though the weather at the time was unfit for soumliug. Tue h,Yllrograplly of the lower part of the Pamplico I:h'er had been pre,·iously completed. Taking the bulk of the Hetzel in tow, the Arago returned to Pungo River, and finished soundings in the main stream and branches within tlie plaue-t:ihle limits occupied this season by Assistant Dorr. H,rdrographic work in that riwT was clost'tl on the 13th of April. As soon as practicaule, the hydrograpbj- of Pamplico Sound was resumed. The part deYeloped this year lies between Royal Sb.oal light-house and BranL Island, and e\Terywhere, except alongthe north side of the chart, the recent soundings connect with soundings made in former seasons, Bell's Bay, one of the branches of Pamplico Sournl, near the entrance of l'amplico Uh-er, was also sounded out by the party of .Assistant Kesby means of points usell in the sun-'-\Y of the Jastnamed river. The shore-line of Bell's Bay yet remains to be tracml. The steamer Arago returned to Baltimore on the 20th of May. Assistant Nes was engnged during the summer in Section II, as already stated.

Hydrograpliy of Hatteras Shoals.-A.ft-er repairs needed in order to keep the steamer Bibh afloat for the remainder of the season, the bydrographic party of Acting l\faste.r Robert Platt left :Norfolk with that vessel on the 2d of Jaly to complete soundings in the vicinity of the Hatteras Shoals. Several days were occupied in resetting signals to be used along the coast, and in esta!Jlishiug a tidal

station. E\·ery favorable opportunity was employed until the 26th of August in sounding around the shoals known as the Inner and Outer Diamond. "Beginning with the south point of Cape Hatteras beach, the bottom is very uneven. Between the pitcll of the cape and the Inner Diamond, there are many lumps witll only 6 and 8 feet of water in them. In the inner slough, several places were found with only 14 and 18 feet water. On the Inner Diamond there is as little as 4 feet1 but this shoal may not be cousidered dangerous, as it nearly al ways shows itself lly breakers, and is near the land. Many spots north and east of that shoal have only 18 feet of water on them. The buoys have all disappeared from the inner slough, and that passage should not be attempted unless the navigator is well acquainted with the vicinity of Hatteras Shoals. Betweeu tho Inner and Outer Diamond is a passage, now buoyed, known as the Outer Slough. 'rhis is perfectly safe for vessels drawing less than 14 feet. The Outer Diamond bas 5 feet, anu on the north side is very steep; the deep ·water on that side running close to the shoal. Ou the south side, however, and on the southeast side, ti.Jc water shoals gradually, making the approach safe while _the lead is going. The Outer Diamond shows at all times by breakers, except in calms of several days duration." "East of the Outer Diamond, and two and a half miles from it, is a dangerous shoal SE. ~ S. (magnetic) and eight and a third nautical miles from Hatteras light-house. This shoal has 11 feet water, and 10 fat!Joms within a quarter of a mile to the eastward." Acting ::\laster Platt reoommends that in passing the Hatteras Shoals, heavy-draught Yessels should in day-time keep the white part of the light-house barely in view on the horizon; and, at night, that such vessels, unless very sure of position, should not keep in less than 10 fathoms. Only one vessel has been available for the hydrographie survey off Ca,pe Hatteras; but the distance from land of some of the dangers in that vicinity makes an additional '\'essel expedient, to serYe as a stationary object in the determination of angles of position. In the absence of such facilities, Hatteras ligllt-house was used by the party as a theodolite-station. The tides were recorded at Hatteras Inlet for adjusting the hydrography of the shoals.

Topography of Bear's Inlet anrl Brown's Inlet, .North Carolina.-In continuation of the detailed survey of the coast of North Carolina below Bogue Inlet, A.ssistant C. M. Bache reached Swansboro' on the 12th day of February, and there joined with the previous work of Assistant Adams, who had fille(l in <let.ails from Beaufort to Bogue Inlet, and traced the coast-line as low down as New Inlet. The topography back of that shore-line was filled by the party of Assistant Bache. Subassistant H. M. De Wees and .H. ,Y, Bache assisted in the work. An area of twenty square miles is represented by the plane-table sheet. The party returned early in May, and took up service in Section II. Assistant ·whiting inspected the plane.table work while it was in progress on the coast of North Carolina, and found it oorrect in plan and details. The season being exceptionally cold, the party of Assistant Bache suffered in passing from Beaufort to their working-ground, and were much hindered afterward by inclement weather. SECTION Y.
ATLANTIC COAST AND SEA-WATER CHANNELS OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORG£A, INCLUDING SOUNDS, HARBORS, AND RIVERS, (SKETCH No. 8,)

Hyilroyraphy of the Cape Fea.r entrances.-Witb a party in the schooner Bailey, the hydrography of the Cape Fear entrances was taken up at the end of December, 1871, by Subassistant '\V. I. Vinal. :l\Iajor Craighill, of the United States Engineers, having under consideration the improvement of the channels, signals were erected aud soundings were inade in accordance with the wishes of that officer. The work was inspected in February by Assistant Ilenry Mitchell, who advised with the party in regard to observations on the currents. Profiles and cross-sections were also made of the

narrow strip of land at tllc northern end of Smith's Island. Mr. Vinal reports tllat the shore-line of that island is changing rapidly in the -vicinity of Bald Head Point and near :New Iulet. He carefully traced the water-line in both places as it now exists. Tllc party was engaged in sounding the Cape Fear channels until the 7th of June. Among the developments made are tlle following: A new channel, with 9 feet of water, at the western entrance; a channel, now in use at New Inlet, that of 1866 being no longer used. The hy<lrographic sheet shows the crib-work constructed at the head of Smith's Island by the Corps of Engineers; the catch-sand fences, intended for preserving the littoral cordon; aud tlle ground which efforts will be made to keep from rapid degradation by the cultivation of grass. Rach of the current-stations was occupied during thirteen hours, and reconls were made at each of the rate at and under the surface of the water. "\Vhile the party was sounding at the western entrance, assistance was rendered by Captain Carson with the reYenue-cutter Seward on se\eral occasions. Mr. J. J. Evans aided in the service afloat and also in the field and office work.

Snhassistant Vinal is now engaged in the hydrography of Cape Fear River. Survey between Little Rii·er entrance and Winyah entrance, South Carolina.-Subassistant 0. H. Tittmann commenced on the 1st of January with a -view of developing a stretch of the coast-line of about 60 miles, along wbicll triangulation by ordinary means is impracticable. Two triangulation-points on the upper side of ·winyah Bay furnishing a base and azimuth, otl.Jer stations in connection with them were occupied in tbe usual way with the theodolite to cross the North Inlet marshes, beyond which no natural facilities for triangttlation are found along tlle beacl,1. Iu going northward, the beach was measured in the longest lines practicable by means of a steel tape, and the adjacent topography was sketched in as the measurement advanced. The first opening which interrupts the continuity of the beach is Butler's Inlet. On the adja· cent island, several houses were determined in position, and as points they will be usefnl iu prosecuting offshore hydrography; the uniform outline of the woods which back the view from sea 011 the low flat coast making it extremely difficult to distinguish any other objects. Tlie beach of Debidue Island, moreover, is subject to great changes of outline under the infhmncci of 11ortheast storms. While Mr. Tittmanu was there at work, an old house near the high-water line was washed away, and also some of the posts set to guide in the beach-measurement. Midway Inlet, at the head of Pawley's Island, is like Butler's Inlet, too shallow to admit any except row-boats; but Murrell's Inlet, 5 miles to the northward, though it bas but little water on the bar, bas much more water, and was the refuge of small blockade-runners in tlle late war. Thence on, the coast-line tends to the eastward and becomes more stable, as Subassistant Tittmann observed by the remains of structures for making salt at and below the high-water line. The topography of the region is simple, consisting mainly of pine-woods. About Murrell's Inlet, but seldom above it, the woods are traversed by roads. The waters of the neighboring swamps percolate through the soil, and re-appear on the beach as stagnant, malaria-generatiug ponds. Subassistant Tittmann, his aid, Mr. Bryant Goodwin, and every hand in the party, were })rostrated by the unhealthy condition of the air. Work was pnsbcd until the end of August in the effort to develop the coast-line as far as Little River; but the party being at that time entirely disa.bled 1 was recalled. Mr. Tittmann bad previously made an examination of Little River entrance, which, as ooiug the only navigable opening in a long stretch of coast, has some trade. The channels were

sounded, and observation8 were made for the positions of buo,ys. A sketch of the entrance, made at the reqne8t of underwriters in New York and of traders at Little l{iver, was at once furnished for the infonnation of the Light-House Boaru. Subassistant Tittmann, though much impaireu in healtll by protracting his stay through the summer below Little River, has now resumed work in the hope of completing the topography between that entrance and Winyah Bay. Topography of TI':inyah Bay, South Carolina.-Tbe detailed survey of the shores of Winyah Ray was taken up by Assistant ,Y. II. Denuis, on the 7th of December, with a party working in", the sehooner Caswell. "The sheet on which the work was laid down includes the whole of Winyah Bay aml North Inlet, and parts of the Sampit, Pedee, and Waccamaw RiYers. The main shore-line of the bay, traced by Assistant Whiting in 1SU7, having changed very slightly, was transferred to the sheet of this year, on which the topography was filled in. This includes the vicinity of Georgetown, and the rice-plantations which line the rivers and the western siue of the bay." Field-work was closetl on the 9th of l\Iay.

Early in February, Assistant A. T. l\Iosman sought at the desired points, but found identifying marks at onl;y one station ; the ground at other stations !laving been disturlJed fo the course of tl1e war. Fortnnntely, on Saint Simon's Island the point found was well situated for the application of azimuth. Assistant Mosman and bis aid, Mr. Edwin Smith, occupied the station in March, I.mt tho weather was extremely unfavorable. Observations were, however, completed by tho 16th of April. Before closing, the magnetic elements were determined, and horizontal angles were measured for connecting the station with other known points in this section. For latitude on Saint Simon's Island, 16 pairs of stars were observed on ten nights; for time and instrumental corrections, 66 stars, on thirteen nights ; azimuth was determined by 14 sets of 12 repetitions on six nigbts ; aml for the magnetic elements, observations made in the usual way

Triangulation, topography, and hydrograplty south of .Maianzas Ilil:er, Florida.-For continuing tile survey of the eastern coast of Florida south of the head of :Matanzas Biver, Assistant A. ~I. Harrison organized his party early in December, 18il. The sloop Steadfast 'vas a;;si~ned for transportation, and was passed to her working-ground through the series of sea-water channels which, along the southern coast, permit the transfer of ,·essels that would be endangered b,Y au ontside coast-voyage. Commencing at points which had been determi11e<l in a preyious season near J\latanzas Inlet, Assistant Harrison, in going southward, occupied others in succession along the coast, and thus secured a basis for the torlograpliy, and for sounding tile channel nt the bead of Matanzas I:i\·er. There the Barrier was encountered, which is thus described in the field-report: "This consists, for the most part, of a wet and densely-wooded tract called Graham's Swamp. '.f'he growth is principally live-oak, cypress, water-oak, poplar, bay, myrtle, ha.rd pine, willow, palmetto, and cedar, and the trees are interlaced with vines of various kinds. The Barrier is part of the inland forest which comes to the sea, where the waters of the Halifax River going southward separate from the watPrs of Matanzas River, the course of which is north." For occupying stations in this region, the party of l\fr. Harrison cut lines through the taugled growth of the Barrier to admit of observing with tile theodolite. Stations were determined as far south as practicable with reference to the rate of progress of tile detailed survey.

"The topographical work was taken np at the southern extremity of the plane-table sheet of 1869, made by Assistant C. M. Bache, and was carried southward to and over the Barrier, and about three-qnarters of a mile beyond the last triangulation-point.. During February, March, and April, the party was engaged in mapping the details within a stretch of about sixteen miles long and three aud a half miles wide." "·while engaged in the topography, points were determined. along the outer beach near Matanzas Inlet, and along the shores of the river and its branches, and at these signals were set up to guide in sonndiug the channels. A tide-gauge was established near the head of the river, and observations were recorded while the triangulation and topography were in progress."

Hydrography of the Gulf of Mexico.-At the request of the International Ocean Telegrapll Company, the first service of the hydrographic party, in the steamer Bibb, under command of Acting Master Robert Platt, was rendered in February, by sounding Guadiana Bay, near the western end of Cuba; thatplacehavingbeenindicated as a desirable shore-station for the telegraph-cable intended to connect with the coast of Yuca.tan. The examination made showed, however, that the cable landed anywhere in Guadiana Bay would be subjected to great risk. Acting Master Platt reported on the general features, and specified defects in the existing Spanish charts, through which doubtless the managers had been mjsled. The variable currents in the vicinity of Cape San Antonio were observed and reported on, and a site near San Antonio light-house, inside of Cape Cajon, was suggested a!; the most suitable p1ace in the vicinity for a shore-end of the Gulf cable. From that station, a line of soundings was run to Mugres Island, on the coast of Yucatan, and a favorable place on the island was indicated for landing the western end of the telegraphic line. The greatest depth of water fonncl by sounding was 1, 164 fathoms. Doctor Stimpson, since deceased, was on board of the Bibb, and, though then ill, prosecuted researches iu regard to the forms of animal life brought up by the dredge from the bottom of tbe Gulf. A few rare shells were detected, but generally the b-Ottom was found barren, and wanting in many forms which the dredge brings up in profusion elsewhere. Off Chorrera, the clredge brought up, from a depth of 250 fathoms, a beautiful specimen of Pentacrin11s. It was alive, and about a foot in length. At great depths on the course to Yucatan, the thermometers indicated a temperture of 39~ degrees; the surface-temperature being at the same time and place 81 degrees. The strongest current ob~rved at nine stations on the course was two knots per hour, and the direction was generally northward. On the chart, deep-sea soundings are marked at twenty-six places, and many others were taken in less than 50 fathoms. The results obtained by the bydrographic party were commnnicate<l, at the end of February, to General \V. F. Smith, president of.the International Ocean Telegraph Company. Acting Master Platt was aided in this section, as also in duty which has been mentioned under the head of Sections Ill and IV, by Messrs. J. B. AdamSQn and C. L. Gardner.

'l'his has been done in several places; the direction of the measured Jines in all cases being cheeked so as to i11snre coufidence ju the results. Much work of this character remains at other places along the Gulf coast; but it is gratifying to be able to report that good progress has been made on parts of the coai,;t of the peui11sula of l 1'lorida not available for the ordinary process of triangulation. An importaut link has been included within the present surveying-year. lmmediatel.Y aft.er the opening of the present year, Subassistant F. W. Perkins took the field in this sectiou. After vcrifyiug the measurement of the !Jase-line at Saint Andrew's Bay, he made a <lirect measurcmeut of the Gulf coast between it and Choctawhatchee Bay, tilling in also tbc intervening topography, and connecting with the survey of Assistant Ogden.

The result was a selection of a site for a baseline to connect with that work, and to serve also as a base for a system of points between tbe Atlantic coas,t and the Mississippi Rh-er. l\Ir. Sullh·an continued the reconnaissance in that direction, and at tlle end of the season made a comprebensiYe report on the facilities and obstacles to be met with in prosecuting the geodetic connection. A party has since been detailed, and is now engaged in the determination of points within the region included in the reconnaissance. Assistant Sullivan is yet in the field, and in tlm course of the winfor will select, for large triangles, stations known to be , intervisible, so that, in advancing from Atlanta, stations 011 the Mississippi may be reached by the least number of well-determined points. Jlleasiirement of a primary base-line near Atlanta,, Ga.-Tl.Je site for a base-line in the vicinity of Doraville, about fifteen miles from Atlanta., Ga., hadng been selected to meet requirements in the field-work of Assistant C. 0. Boutelle, I visited the station early in the season, and personally inspected the plan for connecting the line with triangulation, to he advanced from it westward toward the ::\Iississippi. The proposed arraugementl'l were approYed, aml the grading of the line went on during the summer, under charge of the aids of the party, Messrs. II. W. Blair aud Habersham Barnwell; Assistant Boutelle being part of the time prostrated by serious illness. He was able, however, to rejoin bis party in October, and completell the mf'asurement of th~ base-line in NoYember. In his absence from the field, an experienced aid, Mr. \V. H. Stearns, was !letailecl to rn-enforce the party; Assistant Webber, in that interval, taki11g charge of the cletails. Before and after the measurement of the base-line, the bars used for determining its length were carefully compared with tbe standard length-measure at the Office. Mr. Boutelle h~ now making angular measurements for connectiug the 1mse-1inc witl1 the nearest triangulatim1-points. (See Sketch .Ro. 11.) Geo(letic connectioti.-In order to make aYailable without delay the rf'A"11lt8 derirnd from the measurement of the base-line near Doraville, Ga., Assistant P. P. Webber was asRigned to conduct the triangulation of the vicinity. His party reached the site of the base early in August. As soon as practicable, a transit-instrument and zenith-telescope were mounted. Observations for latitude and time were made at faT'orable interyals, and were completed by Mr. \\'ebber by the eud of September. Tlw charge of all the field-work intended in tbe yicinity haviug devolved on him during the iJlness of Assistant Boutelle, Assistant Webber conducted both parties, and was aided in bis special observations and computations by Messrs. Blair and Barnwell. Nea,r the middle of October, he was joined by Mr. Stearns. Later in that month, Assistant Webber arnl J\'fr. Stearns determined the magnetic elements at a station near the base-line. After assisting in the measurement of the line, 1\Ir. \Vebber se1ectell stations for extending triangulation from it iu the direction towaru Chattanooga, appl_ying for that imrpose the scheme which hau resulted from the reconnaissance preYiousJy made by Assistant Sullivan. At the station nearest t-0 the base, a tripod and observing-scaffold lim-e been put u11 1 and a primary signal on Stone Mountain. These points will be occupied in the course of the winter, and such others as may he found practicable for the intended triangulation. (See Sketch No. 11.)

Subassistant Eirnbeck, when tho season clORed, was assigned t-0 duty on the w<istern coaflt. Assistant Boyd took np field-work near Saint LouiR, in August last, after recovery from seriou,; illness, contracted in the course of the sea8on in prosecuting dut.y helow New Orleaus. The great heat of September in the region about Saiut Louis cauRed much siclrneRs in the party; but the details of tTiangulation were urged as far as practicable. 1\Ir. Boyd selected a. site for a hase-line a.bout eight miles to the eastward of the city, and p1·0\·e1l its fitrn·ss for connecting properl,Y with the triangulation-points, which ham been already occupied. The base-site intended for measurement on the American Bottom is about four and a half miles in length. In October, the weather was favorable, but, as in the preceding month, immense ,-olumes of smoke interfered with lines of sight along that part of the Mississippi Yalley. T1Yo stations near the city were occupied, both of them connecting by angles with the proposed base. Late in October, the line was measured with six-meter hars un<ler favorable circumstances, and the ends were carefully marked for identificaWm, as in alJ similar cases. A line of le mis run from the site about fifteen miles, allll terminatin!!" at the city dir<ictory in Saint Louis, gave, for the height of tb.e base-line on the American Bottom above the level of mean tide in the Gulf of Mexico, about 480 feet. Until tbe 21st of November, angular measurements were continued at all fa\"orable intervals at the ends of the base, but farther observations will be recorded in the coming season. The approximate length of the base·line is 7266.86 meters. Five stations were occupied in all. Without th<i hindrance from smoke, the triangulation might ha:ve been well ad ~·anced to the westward of the Mississippi.

.Jlstro11omico.l observations at 8!tcnnan, ll'yomin!J Territory.-At the la;;t session of Congn·ss, a >;mall appropriation was appro\·erl, "to enable the Superintendent of the Coast Snryey to canse astronomieal ol>st"1Tatio11:s to he made at one of the highPst points on the liue of the Pacitie Hail. road.'' The olJsen·ationsliere referred to were recommended by a committel' of the.Americ~m Association for the Advancement of Science, and were antl1orir,cd by Congress "ith a view to ascertain the ath·antage of noting celestial phenomena with the telescope at au ekvntion quite alJove the least. transparent portion of the atmosphere. In view of ulterior purposes, the memorial of tile asso~iatfon was properly met by the action of Cougress; all general operations in the sun·ey beii;g of necessity conducted under tbe lmowu disadvantage of observing with portable instruments at stations near the sea.-level. The station selected for the obsen'ations and tests desired by the memorialists was Slierwan, on the summit of the most eastern rauge of the Hocky .!\fountains, and at the higher;t elerntion on the line of the Union l'acific Hailwar. That station is about 8,2GS feet above the level or the sm. Under the general charge of Assistant ltichard D. Out.ts, of the Coast. Snn·ey, and his aid, l\1r. H. A. Colonna, the obsen·ing-party was Prof: 0 . . A.. Young, of Dartmouth College, well knowu b.Y successful researches with the spectroscope; flll(l his assistant, Prof. U. F. Emerson. The excellent 12-foot equatorial and other apparatus requisite for the obsen-ati1ms were fnmisbt'd hy the trustees .of Dartmouth College. For collateral operations, Assistaut A. T. Mosman, of the Coast Surrn.r, was stationed at Salt Lake City, to co-operate in deterrniniug the true longitude of Sherman station. Three temporary obserYatories were put up at Sherman in J nne: one for the transit and latitude instruments, including also the telegraph and chronograph apparatus; another for the meteorological instruments; and the third for the equatorial telescope. The respective observations were . commenced in each early in July, and were continued until the 16th of August. Professor Young has, with my .sanction, matle known the special results in leacling scientific publications of our country, and they have been read with much interest by European observers.

To guard against molestation by ro\·iug ludiarn;, the observing-party was attended, iu accord·
ance with orders from the \\'ar Department, by a sergeant and ten men of the United States Arm.:r.

Four of the latter, instructed by Assis taut Cutts, reconled meteorological observations for sixty dayi,;. The registers show ti.mt, during Juue, July, aud part of August, the weather was unfavorable for astronomical work, a condition said to he exceptional in that region. 'Vben, howeYcr, the sky was clear, the brilliancy of the firmament was startling h~' the unusual number of stars visible to the unaided ese; and their apparent proximity demonstrated at a glance the transparency an1l st.ead iness of atmosphere gained by clenition. Instrumental comparisons ccmfinned the correctness oT tile eye-impresi;ion. From the results o!Jtai11ell, it may be stated that the value of observations at an eleYation of 8,000 foct is from '.W to 25 per cent. greater than at the sea-level. As a single illn,;tratiou of iucreased power apparently gi>en to the telescope when used abo'l"e the 1leuse aud more perturbed stmta of the atmosphere, I'rofessor Young reports, in reference to the spectrum of the chromosphere, that, at Dartmouth Uollcge, be hatl succeeded in making out a list, iu all, of 103 lines reversPtl; bnt that, dnri11g the six weeks at Sherman, he adtled 170 new lii1es to the catalngtw. Among- th·' oln,iervations were inelnded careful uetermi11atioms of llw latitude autl longi· tude of Ute station, and the magnetic declination, force, aud inclination. Tue details, with the couclusious drawn by each ohsen·~ in regard to the transparene,y of the air due to eleYation, are given in Appendix No. 8. Uonsideriug the short veriml employed by the party at Sherman, aud the cloudy weather which pn·\·ailed, the re1:5uJts revorted are of interest and \·alue. 'l'hey clearly warrant the continuance of special obserYatious tending to the adnmcemeut of astronomical scieuce, and not less directly to the credit of the Government and the repute of our country amoug ua tions. }'or the astronomical obserYatious needful at Salt fotkc Uit,y, Goyernor Brigham Young placed his ow11 ohscnat.or.:r in TPmple Square at the dispos;tl of Assistant Mosma11. 'fime-obsen·ations were made" ilh the tnu1sit-iustl'umeut belong-iug to the gu\'emor, who adtled to this cmutesy eniry facility llesirnule fur the ohserYations. On the 26th of June, the go,·emor's o!Jservatory was connected with the Deseret 'l'elPgrnph Company's wires, going to Ogden hy a loop; and by the line, from Ogden to Slterruu11 by the wires of the Pitcitlc aull Atlantic Telegraph Uompauy. Signals for longitude were exchangetl with the ohsernir at Sherman on the night of the 28th of June, and un seven other nights preceding the 23<l of July. That month being very favorable at Salt Lake, ~Ir. Mosman reconletl time-observations on twenty-live nights in the course of less than a montli. H.e njoincd Assistant Cutts 011 the 27th of July, autl determined the latitude of the point occupied for the special observations at Sherman station. Assistant Mosman returned to the Atlantic coast early in August, aml engaged in computations previous to resuming work, on which he is now engaged in ~ection V. llis field·report specially mentions the cordial assistance rendered by GoYernor Young, of Utah, arnl liy Superintendent Musser, of the Descret Telegraph, in furthering the operations ueedf'ul at Salt Lake for determining the true position of Sherman station. Observations at Su1m11it station and at Verdi, Nev.-On his return to the western coast, Assistant George Davidson occupied a station 011 the Central Pacific Uailroad near Summit, in the pass of the Sierra Nevaua, at au elevation of 7,300 feet above the sea. His plan for testing the advantage of a great elevation included obsernitions with instruments which he had used for years, and the noting of objects entirely familiar to him as an astronomical observer iu the Coast Survey. His predous experience on the Pacific Coast 1\Jountains had been limited to elevations of somewhat less than :~,500 feet. Subsequently, Mr. Davidson occupied several weeks in making transit, azimuth, tmtl latitude obsei·vations at Verdi, about twcnty-JhTc miles east of Summit sta· tion, with a view of connecting points with the one hundred and twentieth meridian of longitude from Greenwich, for the determination of which request had been made, for the uses of another department. The station occupied at Verdi is about 4,870 feet aborn sea.level, and not favorable for steadiness of atmosphere. In observing upon Polaris, Assit;tant Da\'idson reports, tliat "every uigbt the companion of Polaris was tlistinctly Yisiblll to every member of the party." The planet Saturn and the attendant rings were better defined than had e\·er ;been previously obscr\·ed. All foaturel! iu the aspect of the moou were seen with unusual distinctness; and Mr. Da,·idson suggests that photographic pictures taken of the moou from places above atmospheric llerturbation woultl

he remarkably eJfeetive. His obsen·atious on t!Je outline and general features of spots on tlm snu revealed what could not be seen with the same instruments at tl1e sea.Jen~!. The report of Assistant Da-vidson, given in Appendix No. 9, also warrants the conclusion that the Yalue of obserYa· tions on celestial phenomena and objects is much increased by the use of ordinary instruments at great elevations. On the south side of the railroad, near Verdi Bluff, IIIr. Dasidson measured a short base, and made a triangulation of the vicinit,y. ·while occupying stations with tile theodolite, augnlar measurements were made to determine approximatel;1· the positions of aU the mountain.peaks in Yiew that could be identified by local names. Records of the obsern1tio11s for latitude, longitude and azimuth were sent to the Office, aud promptly reiluced and computed. The results are now ou file in tbe archives. In August, Assistant DaYillson passed on to San Francisco, and occupied the season in fieldduties, which are yet in operation. Abstracts of the work done by his own party, and by others under his general direction, will be gi\en under the next liead. The longitude of Verdi station -was determined in April by tlJc exchange of clock-signals between the aid at that station, l\Ir. S. R. Throckmorton, and Assistant DaYidson at San Francisr~o, through the lines of the Pacific auu Atlantic Telegraph Company. l\Ir. Throckmorton recorded 145 transits of 44 stars in the course of ele\en nights, using the meridian-instrument :'.'\o. 1, a Frodsham break-circuit chronometer, and Hipp's :field-chronograph. J\Ir. Davidson subsequently determined the latitude of Yenli by 1G3 ol1serrntions on 88 stari,;, arranged in 45 pairs; recording at the same time notes on their relative magnitude. For titue, 83 transits of 37 stars were observed on uiue nights, "·ith the meridian-instrument aml sidm'eal chronometer. Mr. H. I. 'Villcy recorded at Verdi barometrical obsen·ations simultaneonl!I with others obser\ed liy Assistant Davidson at .San Francisco, for comparing the deriYed differeuce of ICY<)l ·with results gi,·en by the levelling.instrument. Azimuth was determined by .Assistant Davidson's obserrntions on B. A. C. 41G."i at western elongation, and on J>olaris at eastern elongation, in connection \Yith a station of liis triangulation as an azimuth-mark. The base-line, half a mile in leugth, was carefally measured t'."l"icc with steel tape. Six stations were occupied with the theodolite, and seventeen positions were determined, as well as the height of each above the level of the sea. The aids of the party determined at Verdi the magnetic Yariatiou nml llip. Mr. Dadllson adtled to the records a series of observations for the absolute horizontal intensity of magnetism at the station. · 'Vith reference to a geodetic connection b_y stations across the contin<:>nt, l\!r. Da\·illson, uefore returning to San Francisco, made a short reconnaissance along the crest of tlie Sierra -XeYada to note where a large triangulation might cross tl.Jat chain of mountains.

Intimacy of relation with the Light-House Iloanl has been kept up. Assistant Daviuson has furnished p1·omptly to the lighthouse i11sp1~ctor tile ascertaineu positions of lights and buoys, and, as hitherto, has reported upon the location and cl1aracter of ad ditioual aids for navigation on the Pacific coast. Ilydrographic reconnaissance beticeen San Diego and J>anama.-Commander Philip C. Jolrnson, U. S. X., Assistant Coast Sm·yey, has entered upon this service with hif: hydrographic party in tl'le steamer Hassler. Special examination was made under favorable circumstances at the site of a supposed rock off San Diego, in latitude 31 o 00' uortb, and longitude 119° 24' west, but only deep water was found. The steamer was of necessity refitted at Sau Francisco after the voyage by the Strait of l\Iagellan, but is now in effective condition for sen ice in the hydrographic reconnaissance along tLe sailing-line below San Diego. In Scpteml.Jer, Assistant Davidson lent to Dr. David ·walker a few instruments suitable for making observations on a prqjected passage from San Francisco to Guaymas, Mexico, and return passage to San Francisco. The results receh"ed comprise temperatures, recorded at inten'als of four hours, of the water and air; notes on the currents; errors in the position of certain pa1'ts of the coast of Mexico; alHl notice in regarll to a reef off the island of Geronimo, not laid down on any chart. This reef was referred to the attention of Assistant Davidson by Captain l\fotzgar, who discovered it. Uommauder Johnson is assisted in the operations of tlie hydrographic party by Lieut. Uommander C. \V. Kennedy, and by Hents. l\I, S. Day, Il. B. Mansfield, and E. \V. Remy, U. S. N. 'Triangulation and topogmplty.-East of tlrn San Gabriel Hiver aud toward the Anaheim Landng on the coast of California, the topographical survey and requisite triangulation were coutinnetl duriug part of the winter and spring by Assistant A. ,V, Chase. Points for the plane-table work were determined near the base on the Los Angeles Plains, anll other points connecting >l'ith them were established at intervals toward the lmuling. The improvements in the vicinity, incluuing the railroad and jettee and the town of \Vilmiugton, were added to the topographical sheet, with whic.b ~lrnt of the present year connects. Most of tbe ground represented is low, and cut up by lagoons bordered by marsh. The shore is low, and marked by sand-dunes. "'Ir.

In April, he took the field, autl, after connecting San Miguel with Santa Rosa Island by angular measurements, started with the detailed survev of the last-named island. Field-work was somewhat impeded hy recurring fogs, but the progress reported is Ratisfactory. Santa. Rosa Island, in the outer range of the Santa Barbara group, is eighteen miles long, and lJas a shore-line of about forty-eight miles. Parts of it are elevated more than 1 1200 feet.

Tlie part of tlrn coast included presents many difficulties; but at the close of the season Mr. Eimbeck had made good progress in laying out points for the desired triangulation. In order to find intervisible stations, mountaius elevated as much as 5,iOO feet above the sea were tra'l"ersed by the party engaged in tltis reconnaissance. Triangulation and topography of the coast near San Luis Obispo, Cal.-Assistant L.A.

Topography of Table 111omitain anclof the Southeast Farallon.-Field-work was completed at Table .Mountain by Assistant A. F. Rodgers in the course of the winter of 1871. This important landfall at the entrance of Sau Francisco Bay presents three summits in a range nearly east and west; the highest being twenty-six hundred feet above water-level in the Golden Gate. The north and south sides of the mountain are cut by deep gulches, between which are steep rocky slopes covered with chaparral. Part of the winter was occmpied by Mr. Rodgers iu computations and other office-work con· necterl with the operations of the preceding year. Before the completion of these details, the aid of the party, Mr. E. F. Dickins, was sent to the Southeast Farallon to make the final survey of that island. Points were determined by triangulation in the usual manner, and on that basis Mr. Dickins sketched in the topography. After depositing the sheet at San }'rancisco, the party of A::isistant Rodgers took up field-work at another site in tbis section, as will be noticed present!~-. Longiturle-observation.~at San Francisco.-At the ot1tset of the present surveying-year, req nest was pending for the determination of the one hundred and twentieth meridian of longitude on the Union Pacific Railroad, as stated in my annual report. Assistant George Davidson, who passed part of the winter of J 871 on the A ti an tic coast, took cliarge of the service desired, and made arrangements for its performance on l!is oYerlaud return to San Francisco in the spring of the present year. On his application, the lines of the Pacific and. Atlantic Telegraph Company were assigned for the use of bis party, and ff>ery facility needful was afforded by Goremor Stanford and by Messrs. Vanderburg and Foley. Assistant Davidson occupied the station at Washington Square, San Francisco, with transit No. 3, Kessel's clock 1440, and with a chronograph; Verdi station, in Nevada, near the one hundred and twentieth meridian of lougitude ~est from Greenwich, was occupied, as already mentioned, by the aids of his party, Messrs. S. R Throckmorton and H. I. Willey. Observations by means of the telegraph were commenced on tile 1st of J unc, and clock-signals were satisfactorily exchanged each way between Assistant Davidson and his aicls on six nights. For the instrumental and clock corrections at San Franciseo, l\Ir. Davidson recorded 120 transits of 35 stars on six nights; and, for tbe personal equation between himself and Mr. 1.rhrockmorton, sixty-six observations were made in the course of five nights on 35 stars. When the determination for longitude was complete, Assistant Davidson went eastwarcl au cl determined the latitude and azimuth. at Verdi station, as stated under a preceding bead. In the winter of 1871, Mr. Throckmorton, nuder special instruction of Assistant Davidson, made a series of magnetic o!Jservations at Presidio station, with a view of determining the yearly increase of magnetic declination on the Pacific coast. The observations were repeated at the same station in October, 1872; and results of much value are expected from a discussion of the observations, which will be made without delay. Observations were made by Assistant Davidson in 1859 at Ross Mountain and Bodega Head, with the intention of determining then tbe co-efficient of refraction. The records, including registers of the meteorological conditions under which the observations were made, remained incomplete during the war, when Assistant navidson was on the Atlantic coast. Last winter, however, the requisite lines for leYel were run by the aids of' his party, and the means for the desired determination are now complete. The records and :field-computations of this work are on file in the Office.

Hydrography of San Francisco Bay.-During tbe winter of 1871, Assistant Gersbom Draufonl, with bis party, in tbe schooner Marcy, con<lucteu current-obsenations, and from time to time extended soundings in the Golden Gate approaches, and also between Fort Alcatraz and Poiut kvisadera, in order to filrni,;h the means for comparing with the existing cbart any future surYeys of San Francisco Bay. Tlle observations on currents were continued during three days at each of' tlte fifteen stations. Assistant Bratlfonl's report was accompanied by plottell diagrams showing the results graphically. Connected c;ylinders with conical ends were used for determining snl1currents, one of them heing at tlie bottom, with two or more at distances aboni it varying with the depth of water.

Ou the 5th of April, the party, in the schooner :'.\Iarcy, made arrangements for resuming work in tile northern part of the section, as will be noticed hereafter. ·while tlie steamer Hassler was at the na,·y-yard refitting for sea-duty, Commander Philip <..:. ,Johnson, with his party, sounded in the l\lare Island Straits, and in the Yicinity of the na.-y-yard, and made a chart for future reference or for comparison witll previous sur,·eys. To1.1ography and hydrog1·1JphJ/ of Jlfcndocino Bay anii vicinity.-In May, Assistant L.A. Sengtclkr transferred his party from San Luis Obispo to J,ittle RiYer, near ::\Iendocino Bay, and resumed the survey of t11e coaist at tlle nortllern limit of his work of the preceding year. Tlle stretch now included presents a very narrow margin of cleared country a.Jong the water·1ine, which is bortlcre\l by broken bluffs of ruoclerate height, backed by hea·ily-timbered ridges. Renee the triangulation was atlvanced with difficulty, and, a8 in other sites of work, the season was marked by heavy fogs and strong winds. Ou the topographical sheets are included seYeral" landings," or points of shipment, for lumber aud produce, and the streams known as NitYarro Ri\·er, Salmon Creek or Bfg IU1-er, and Hussian Gulch. Lumber is shot into the vessels by structures that stretch from the top of tlte bluff nemly to the deck, the vessels \\llen loading being moored below. These landings afford no shelter from the heavy gales of winter; but by position they are protected from preYailing summer-winds and from the swell of tbe oceau. For the determination of points on which to base the plane-table work~ Mr. Sengt.eller erectecl thirty signals along tbe coast, aml occupied three stations -with the theodolite.

In this general examination, the bottom of the bay "as found to be very irregular and broken. Special examination was made in the vicinity of a supposed rock off the south point of Mendocino Day, but no obstacle to navigation was deve1opecl hy the soundings. Triangulation and topography southof Sltelter Gove.-In July, Assistant A. F. Rodgers transferre11 his party to the vicinity of Shelter Cove on the coast of California, and resumed field-work from the limit of the preceding year. The site of operations presented many difficulties. The beach iti impassable, except at extreme low water. Back of the water-line, the country is rugged, and covered in part with dense chapparral and partly with heavy red-wood timber. The high ground affords no feed for animals nor any water.

Hy<lrography o.f Cape Jllenrlocino.-In the latter part of April, Assistant Gershom Bradford engngecl one of the steam-tugs, with a competent pilot of Humboldt Bar, and determined in position nearly all the sunken rocks which were discoYererl by Assistant Davidson in 18()9. Two other rocks, not then known, were found to tlJe northward. The suryey indicates a passage about a mile and a half witle between the sunken rocks inside of .Blnnt's Reef and the sunken rocks of the Sugarloaf at the cape. Uut this channel cannot lJe used in thick weather. The course by the passnge referred to is, moreover, only about a mile ]ess in distance, as compared with the ordinary course of nssels outside of Blnnt's Heef. \\"lien these special ueyelopments were complete, the steam-tug was returned to her owum-s, and tile l1ydrographic survey of Trinidad Bay was taken up lw ::\fr. Bradford with his party in the schooner .:\Iarcy. .Foggy weather, however, greatly interferetl with lines intended to develope tile offsliore soundings. ,,~hile the party was engagetl at sea, tidal observations were recorded at Trinidad and at Htunboldt Bay.

Parqubar, though in impaired hea1th, accomplished in the course of the winter and spring a large amount of office-work pertaining to the b~·drography of the western coast. These details inclu<le"'°traciugs of the survey of Ilumboh1t Bay, projections for the work between Rocky Point and Shelter Cove, plottings of the current obsernitions, and drawings of previous ·work requisite for the field-operations of Assistant Davidson. Triangulation 801tth of False Klamath Bfrer entrance, Cal{,fornia.-Assistant A. \V. Chase took up this work late in SeptemlJer; his party htwing been preYiously engaged near Cape San Sebastian, on the coast of Oregon, as will be presently noticed. After signals had been erected for field-work south of the Klamath, a dense fog set in and prevailed until the middle of October.

In April, the ofiicc-work was completed; alHl llcforc the end of tl1at month the party reached (.)rescellt City, am1, as soon as pmctica ble, resumed fidll-work Oll the coast of Oregon, south of l\Iack's Arch. The triangulation and shol'e-liue smn:·y were extended to :\lack\; Ueef, from a point allont sixteen miles southward and eastward, w!Jerc the operations closed in tlie preceding season. Two plane-table sheets, joining at ·whale's Head, were projected to include the limiti; of work. The shore-line is complete on both, and the final topograph~- on the sheet north of "'bale's Head, which represents a rong·h, hroken coast, coYf'red 1vith forest and dense undergrowth, The cliffs in many places are precipitous. Niue miles of coast, with the usnal margin of topography, are included in the detailed snryey. Twent~'·two signals were ercctetl hr the party, au<l ms many stations were occupied with the theodolite.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Triangulation and topography of Slwalu·ater Bay, Was1iington Territo~·y.-1'his work was con· tinued by Sabassistant J. J. Gilbert several weeks after ms armual report of last year was closed. Some shoals and islands within the limits of two of the plane-table sheets were added before the field-operations were discontinued for the winter. Mr. Gilbert then engaged in office-work at Ol;ympia, and com1>leted the records and computations pertaining to tlrn previous triangulation, and inked the plane-table sheets. His party resumed field service early in l\iarcL, and extended the trian~ulation and topography of Shoal water Bay down to the ocean-beach, and there joined with the coast-triangulation. Shoal water Bay is filled with extensi Ye flats. Along the shores, the forest geuerally comes down to the water-line. By taking advantage of the state of the tides, Mr. Gilbert has made good progress in this survey. His work of the season includes: Signals erected - .......... - .. _.. _...... _.... _............... _. . . . . . . . . . . . . 52 Angles measured .. - .. - ................ _- ............. - . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . .. 193 Number of observations ...·................ - .... - ... ~ _ . - ..... - .... _....... 5, 648 Shore-line surveyed, (miles) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78 Sloughs, (miles) ..............·...... _. _.. _................... _.. __ . . . . . . . 93 . ..\rea of topography, (square miles) ................. .............................. - . . . . . .. . 27
The survey of Shoal water Bay and vicinity is yet in progress, and will be continued until the stwerity of weather makes it expedient to close work for the season. 'Triangulation ancl topography of Puget Sound, ·washington :I'erritory.-The office-work of last year wa.s brought up by Assistant J. S. Lawson, in the course of the winter of 1871, at Olympia. These details comprise the triangulation-records, duplicates, and cornputation;o;, tlie completion of Urn plane-table sheets of that year, and tracings from them, to guard against possible loss in the transmission of the originals. Assistant Lawson resumed field-work in April, and exteudell the topographical survey on both side;;; of Admiralty Inlet from Lagoon Point and Oak Cove to the north side of Dwamish Bay and Point. Restoration; and up Possession Sound to Point l<Jlliott, where the operations connect with the predous survey of Port Ludlow, Hood's Canal, and :Madison Harbor. In August, the party commenced the triangulation of Budd's Inlet, at the head of J>uget Sound 'l'his is the proposed temporary terminus of the North Pacific Railroad. A base was measured on the north side of the inlet, and the triangulation connected with it now includes the entire course of the channel. Some progress was made in the plane-table sun·ey, but tlie season was well advanced before the triangulation was complete. Details in the vicinity of Olympia and New Market will be mapped in the course of the winter. The work now done is on eight sheet.s, of which the stittistics are, with those of the triangulation: Signals erected- ....·.......................... - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56 Stations occupied. . . . . . . · ................ -.............. - . . . . . . . . . - . . . . . 22 .Angles measured ......................................... - - .......... - .. - 139 Number of observations ............... _......................... _......- . . . 3, 248 Shore-line of sound, (miles) ..................... - .............. - . - ,. - .... _. 86 Sloughs and lagoons, (miles) .......................................... - __ . 3-0 !wads, (miles) ......... - . - ...... - .................. - .... - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5~ Area of topography, (square miles) ....... - ... - ...... - .. - .. - - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48 Two plane-tables were used in the party of Assistant Lawson: one of them at intervals by himself, when not engaged in the triangulation; the other was used during the season by Subassistant Eugene Ellicott.· Mr. F. A. Lawson was attached to the party as aid. The brig Fauntleroy, as 11enitofore, was employed for transportation. Tidal observations.-The self-registering tide-gauge at Astoria, Washington Territory, has been remoYed to a new wharl not far from the old station, and is well attended, as heretofore, by Mr. L. 'Vilson. The series are excellent of both tidal and meteorological observations at Astoria. Mr. Wilson has also tabulated from the tidal sheets the readings of high and low waters.

PACIFIC COAST-ALASKA TERRITORY, (SKETCH No. ff)

Geographical reconnaissance of the coast of Alaska.-In August, 1871, as stated in my last a1111iml report, Assistant '\Y. IJ_ Dall sailed from San Francisco with his party, in the schoouer Humhohlt, for rcconuaissance at tl1e Aleutian lslaud8. 011 the trip to Unalaska., the opportunity was taken to determine the general direction of Ute ocean-currents. The observatiom; as reported confirm the deductions pnbli8hed in m.v report for the ;rear 1807, with other e1mcl11sions then presentl'cl bj· Assistant DaYidsou. Ilefore la;yiug up the U mnuoldt for the wint~r at lliouliouk, :Mr. Dall established a sell'-rl'gistcring tide-gauge, alJ(l kept up a contiu uons series of obsen·atious. In the ~~kutan Pass, it rock was occupied by an ohsen·er for a period sufficient to determine the range of tlte tide. In geographical deYclopment, the party surveyed and soumled out the harbor of Iliouliouk on U ualaska Island, and the passage through to Captain';; llarhor. Between Unalaska and Kadiak, careful obsernitioni:; were made on the current8 in AJn·il. Coal lhrbor, ou Uuga Ji:;land, was sur\·ese<l and sounded; and the latitude of a statinu there mis dl't··1·111i11ed by l\I. W. llarriugton, es11., who accompanied the part.~~ as astronomical ol·s('rn·1·. 'fht· magnetic elements were determined at lmth of the ii:;lands. . Jn June, Assistm1t Dall made a reconnaissance of tlte Sltu111:1g-i11 group of islauds. 'l'lw sl10rps of Popoff Strait were traced, and that passage was sonrnled. At San Lorn Harbor, on N;igai Jslaml, the latitullc was dctermiued; t.he slrnndinc was traced, and so11udi11gs were rnalle to den'lop tlw anchorage. Sever<!! of tlte atljaceut islands were fixed in position b.r angular measurements, nr11l sketches wcrn made of tlte nearest harbors. Northeast Harbor on Little Koniushi Island arul_a harbor on Simeonotr falaml wm·e likewhse traced in outline and brougl1t into comwctio11 with otliers by a detcr111i11atiou for latitude and by observations for position. The currents and titles wt·re recorded at tl1e Shnmagirl8, a11d views were drawn of fifteen conspicuom;; beadlancls and harhorentrnnces. Fourteen harbors or anchorages, aml ten islets or rocks not marked 011 au.r J>I'(Wions chai·t, were noted by the party, and deterrnine1l in approximate position. \Vbile the schooner HnmlJolllt, was on her course for Kadi<tk, l\Ir. Dall tlisco¥erell <t shoal·lJa11k 011 wbicl1 his party caught, iu alJuudance, lrnlilmt and codfish. The hank has a depth of 22 fathoms, and its approximate positiont as determined by the obsen·ations of Mr. Harrington, is Jnt,itude 5G 0 13' north, and longitude 1530 39' west. Prom Kadiak, the Humboldt sailed for San Francisco on tlte 9th of September. 'The oceaucuneuts were observed on tbe passage, and observations for temperature were recorded. Ou the :irrival of the vessel, experiments were made with the magnets for comparison with tile results fonnd by observations in bigb latitudes. The registers containing tbe observations made at various points on the coast of Alaska are uow at San Francisco. Mr. Dall's detailed report of operations in conductiug tlte reconnaissance will be found in Appendix No. 10. 'rirlal observations.-The tide-gauge sent last year to Alaska was establislwu by Assista.nt Dall, at Iliouliouk, on the Aleutian Islands, and has furnished satisfactory records. .These will he compared wit.it the short series registered at the same 11lace in 1867. Early in tbe summer, a selfregistering gauge was sent to Capt. Charles llr_yaut, agent of the Uuited States Treasury Department at Saint Paul, one of the seal-islands in Behring Sea. Should the instrument reach its destination in safety, au interesting series of tidal olJservatious ma.r l>e ex1>ected, from the known zeal and ability of Captain Bryant in prosecuting usefttl researches.

Schott, with the same organization as iu the iireceding year, excepting the increase of force by one geodetic computer during the laRt three months of' the year. The temporary assh;tance of two astronomical computers was afforded to the division, the same as last year. '£he cm. rent work required by the office and field parties was promptly kept up, arnl the adjm;tmeut of tlrn secondary triangulation, old and new, has been pushed forward. '.l'hese computations, aiming at anll securing grea.ter consisteucy and acenrac.r in tile work, require now more freq11e11t npplication Rince the triangulation is approaching completion. Tile tune of one computer was almm;t wholly g'iveu to the l'edsion of the latitude-computations, arnl to the iutrodnction of improved cateloguc-places of stars, which i11 all cases proved the great accurae.Y attainable in tile measures by the r.enith-telescope. Besides arranging the work for the computers, and gi\·iug detailed instructious, exmniuing antl n·porti11g results, )lr.

FIELD AXD OFFICE WORK HELA TIXG TO THE TlDE:"-.

Fiel1hcork.-Tbc following stations ham Ileen occupiell <luring the year, for long or perma11e11 t series of obserYatio11s, to be used for general purposefo; and theoretical in \·estigatimi;; : Korth Han~ll, Me.; Boston, l\Iass.; Go,·ernor's Island, X. Y.; Old Point Comfort, Ya.; San Diego, and Fort Point near San Francisco, Cal.; and Astoria, Oreg. Some short series of ollseffations lil!Yl' also been made bs hsdrographic parties for use in reducing soundings, but wllich, when reduce(l by the tidal di,·ision, have furnished valnalJle constants for improYing tile tide-tables. The tidal obsen·ations recei1·ed from the Xorth Haven station luwe been excellent, with bnt few exceptions. The pier on which the tide-house stand:-; is large and strongly lmilt, wit!; a well in tile center, an arrangement which gi,·es great protection from w:wes aud ice; anti a self-regi:-;tering· gauge was furnislied. Some parts of this haYiug becorue so much worn as to endanger the couti· nuity of the series, a new gauge has bee11 111ade, and sent to take its place. This is made ou a 11e11 plan devised by me, which, it is hopetl, will aYoid some of the imperfections of the older gangeo;. The heating-apparatus, by which a circlllatiou of ''arm water is kept uv around tl.te ruoving part:-; to prevent the formation of ice, lias continued to work admirably when in use, nnd the experiment" of the ol>scner during the past winter have shown that it caunot be dispeused witl1 until icl' disappears in the spriug. Tilis appears to lie a Yery good place for making a Joni,[ series of obsnYations. A series of meteorological obsen·ations is also kept up here. A part of tile wliarf learling to the tide-house had to be rebuilt recentl_r. The ordinary self-registering gauge at the Boston ua\·y-;rnnl has worked well exc<·pt in winter, when it was stopped much of the time by ice. The glycerine-gauge near it was stopped bnt little, and then not by ice; llut, as the cm-Ye traced by it was 11e,·er quite satisfador~-, it has been discontinuecl, and the other gauge is being fitted up with heating-apparatus similar to tl1at which bas done so well at North lfayeu. 'Ye may, tlierefore, reasonably expect better work in wintt'l' than we llaye ~·et haJ at tllis station. The series of meteorological oliserrntions at t11is place is kept up. Pt. new self-registeri11g gauge, on the pla11 of tliat sent to Xorth HaYeu, bas been made alld loaned to the cit) of Pro,·iuence, to be used there for a ,Year or more hy the eng·iueer of the Providence water-works; the observations to be finally sent to the Coast Survey Office for reductio11 and preservation. .A. good set of obsc1Tations at this point was much needecl~ not 0111)· for use on the improvemeuts goiug on there, but for tlle general llllrposes of tlll' Ccast Smv<-r. 'Yitl1011t them, the work relating to Narragansett Bay would not lJe complete. The self-registering gauge at Go,·ernor's Island bas ruu well except i11 "iukr, when some tides were lost, and many stoppages occasioned by ice. To secure a perfect record in winter, some improvements in the apparatus will be required. Occasional day-obsen·ations are mallc at Brookl,Y11 with a box-gauge for comparison with those or the aborn self-registering gauge; but the fi1H· floating ice, ground up by the numerous steamers and ferry-boats, appears to be sometimes drawn into the float-boxes of the gauges, and oostrnetR them; hence, this gauge cannot lie relied upo11 during the coldest weather. Two new self-recording gauges l!aYe beeu made, similar to the N01tl1 Hann one, whicll will be first used in conuection with the sun-eys going on around New York. One of these will be located at Sandy Hook, and the other at some other suitable point, to enalJlc nR to study tlw relations of the tides of the inner harbor registered at Goyernor's Island to those of the ba~-s and other waters connecting with it. The record of the self-registering gauge at Old Point Comfort has generally been good; lJnt a~ the wharf leading to it has been nearly destroyed by worms and storms, it bas been deenwd best

to moYe the gauge to the steam\Joat-wltarf ncal' it, where it will always be accessible. Accoruingly, a room has been prcparell for it there in the new lmiluing erected by the Quartermaster's Departmeut, and it will soon be placed ti.Jere. \Ve are intlebted to General Barry for these accommodations. The porcelain tiual staff-gauges put up at the principal stations on the eastern coast have continued to gi;'e satisfaction, and seem to be far more durable aud convenient to read tllan the wooden ones preYiously used, as the µ;lazing put on o;·er the dilisious and figures protects tl.Jem, while the dirt is easily cleaned off. A self-registering gauge has been seut to the island of Saint Thomas, in the West Indies, in ac'. conlance with an arrangement made liy the Coast Sun·ey Oftice with Col. F. E. de Bille, governm~ of the island. It is expected that the olisernttious made there will be of great use in clearing up certain llifficulties connected with the tidal waYes, which, comiug from tile South Atlantic, pass this island, and finally reach 01ir coasts. The self-registering gauge at San Di<'go continued to giYe good work until the t>upports to the house gave way; and then, as it was nut considered best to incur the large expense required for replacing them, the series ha,·iug been l'Ontinued uearly nineteen years, or about as long as had been contemvlatecl, it was stopped. The gaug;e was also wautetl at Port Townshend, where a good series of observations '}·ith a self.registering gauge is much needed. The self-registering gauges at Fort I>oint and Astoria ha;-e been kept g·oiug. Tue one at Fort Point, however, had to be refitted 011 new piles adjoining the wharf, which had become too much deca.Yell to yield a firm support, and the Astoria gauge was removed to a. m·w wharf built near the old one. At all three of these stations, good meteorological observations have been regula.rly made. G. II. ::\'Ienuell, major of engineers, l.Jrevet-colonel, lT. S. A., lJas continued liis ver,\' efficient superdsion of these stations, and carried out the plans seut from the Otlice. Xo ohserYatio11s have yet been recei\'ed from tlm self-registering title-gauge sent last year to lliouliouk, Aleutian fa\an<ls, bul it is presumed to be in operation. rt iR Yery 11esirable that a good Ret of observations be secured t11ere. Oue of our t>elf-registering· gauges was taken a few moutlls ago to tile island of Saint Paul, the larget't of the seal-islands iu Behring Sea, by Capt. Charles Bryant, au officer acting under the Treasury Department. He appearell to be well qualified for the supen'ision of it, and we are confident tLat he "·ill cause a goo<l series of o\Jserrntions to be made ·with it. The o!d self-registering gauge that bas l.Jeeu used at Xorth Haven will be retumell to the Office ;;;oon for repairs, wheu it will probably lie sent to Fernandina, Fla., as it is very desirable that a permanent tidal statiou ishould be established there. \Ve han 110 gauges yet tba.t can l>e :>pared for the Gulf coa:>t or the coast of Alaska, though obse1Tatious 011 both arc niry desirable. The few observations we have just received from Saint Thomas iudicate a close l'elation l.Jetweeu the foles there and those of the Gulf of Mexico, and it woultl be interesting to have siurnltaneo11s observations from these places . .A t>elf-registering tide-gauge wa" sent, iu August., 18G2, to l\Ir. Pease, surveyor on the San1lwl.Jicb Islam1s, l.Jy Lieut. George H. }}Hiott, by direction of Professor Bache, together with a clescriptiou, foll instructions, and a Rupply of paper, but we have no eYidence that it was e\·er set up; auu, 011 the death of :Mr. !'ease, it was sold amo11g bis effects; but Mr. \Y, D. Alexander, the present su1)erintendeut of the Hawaiian gm·ernnie11t survey, heard of it, aud, after considerable trouble, succeeded in reco\·ering it, an(l ha\'iug it repaired aml put iu operation at Hilo on the island of Hawaii. lle l.ias another self-recording gauge at llonolnln. 'fbe plan of Profesl:!or Bache for securing series of observations at these islands, to compare with tl.10se rna(le on our western coast, is, therefore, after a lapse of terr years, iu a fair way of being carried out. The tiues at these islands are found to be of the same type as those on the coast of California. The tides of the :~forth l'acific seem to be c\·erywhcre of the same general type ; but the study of them cannot be yery complete until we have gauges 011 the coast of Alaska. In the followiug table I give a brief recapitulation of the tidal observations. received at this Office since Nornmber 1, lSil, and not before reported, omitting those made by bydrogra.phic

The work on this series has been greatly increase1l by tlle imperfections in the obsernttious, :rnd sometimes by the loss of them. Two or three months wern wholly lost Oil the. way tn the Oftice. It will require :1 considerable amount of work still to set these honrly readings in proper order for t1iRPnssion. A portion of the commencement of the series has been fonnd to lie o.:o <lf'fectiYe as to call for its p;jc·ction, ancl a continuance of the observations enough long1·r to complete a set of good 011es for a prriocl of the required length. Copies of about three years of thefl<' 110nrJ,,- rea<lings wcr<l sent to Sir \\-illiam Thomson, of J~ngland, for trying his new nwthmls or discussion on them; and the 1·1·s11lts which have been received seem to be good considering the shortness of il1e Rmfos. But to carry out such methods perfectly would st1e111 to require more frequent rPadings. Considerable time ha,; been spent in making the necer,;sary preparatious fol' ta.lrnlating tlH· hourly readings for the San Diego series in tlie best manner. As this series is now terminated, it i>; very desirable that this should be done. A large part of the series was good j and probably tit(~ imperfections which exist in it can be so far remedied aR not to very scl'iously affect any re;mlts that may be deduced from it; bn1 some of t11e re<lnctions required cannot be ma<le iu the hest manner until the whole series has been tabulated.

In this table of resultsA is the co-efficient of the semi-diurnal title or heig;ht of bigh water aboYP the mean lernl: B is the ratio of this co-efficient to that of the tnC'an title ; ' 0 is the effect of the diurnal tide upon the height of high watm·, uear the time of upper transit of the moon. The sign of C must be i·eversetl for bi git water occurring Hear the time of lower tra·1,.it. The height of the maximum and minimum tides only are ginm, :11111 the days on wliich tht-y occur; but several tides preceding and following do not generally difler much from tht~sc in height. Of the two high waters occurring on the same day, the one near the time of upper transit iis the greater when C is positive, but the re\'erse when C is negatiYe. The highest tide of the year will he the tide occurring near the time of upper transit 011 the 7th of October. The uext highest will he on the 27th of Febrnary, near the time of lower tra11sit, since C, in this case, is uegati \·e. Ou account of the smallness of the solar ti<le, aud tbe unusually large effect of the lnnar })araf, lactic inequality, the maxima and miuima of the Boston tides, aml of tbe New England coast generally, are much more irregular tlian those of European 11orts.

some parts of the year, when the moon's perigee happens near the time of new or full moon, the one maximum is almost entirely destroyed, and is frequently less than the mean tide, as may be readily seen from the column B. For the same reason, the intervals betwee11 the maxima and miuima in the Boston tides are-also very irregular, being in some cases ten d:iys, while in others, as in the latter part of .Tuls, only three days. Although the absolute heights of the tides may differ ver;y much in difii.>rent ports, yet, as the type of the tides is probalily nry nearly the same from Cape Cod northward along the New England coast, the i>receding dates of the maxima and minima, and the ratios expressed in tLe columu B, are very nearly correct for an of this coast, and approximately so for tlw whole Atlantic coast. It should be borne in mind that the preceding results ma~- be materially modifieu by the effects of meteorological causes. A fall of one inch of the mercury in the barometer below the mean, ·causes the height of bigb or low water to be about seven iuches greater in Roston Harbor, a.Jl{l the reverse for a rise of oue inch of the mercury; and proportional effects belong to other rauges of the mercury. Also northeast aud contiguous winds cause a considerable increase of the height of high or low water, while southwest aud contiguous winds depress the height of the titles. The preceding results are not only useful to navigators, but also to farmers who have hay to make near the level of tide-water. In July and August of this year, Yer.)· high tides occur on the 13th and the 10th respectively, after which it may be seen from the column B that there will be no tides for nearly a month which come np to the mean tide, expressed by unity.

' " ASIIINGTON CITY,

Alarch 29, 1813.

DEAR Sm: I beg leave to submit the following· report of the astronomical and meteorological

observations made at Sherman, "r~·omiug Territorj-, in couformity with your written and verbal instructions of April and ~lay last. Those instructions directe<l me to determine the 1atitnde and longitude of Sherman for the geodetic connection between the Atlautic am1 Pacific coasts, au<l placed under my general charge tlle class of observations called for in the following paragra11h of the appropriation bill npproyed ll;v the President .Tm1e 10, 1S'i2: "To enahle the Superintendellt of the Coast Survey to cause astronomical ol.lserrntious to !Jc made at one of the biglwst points on tlle line of the J>acific ltailroad, two thousand dollars." The character of the obseryatious to be ma(le was iuferrell from the resolutions passed u.r the American Association for the Advancement of Scieuce, at thPir meetings held, respccti\·cly, at Ohicago, in 1868, au<l at Tro.v, i11 1870; and especially from the memorial of J. E. Hilgard, United States Coast Sun·ey, Prof. Joseph Henry, Smithsonian Institution, aml l'rof. ,l. H. Coffin, of Lafay. Pl.Le Collt~gt1, a committee appointetl by the association to represent to Congress" the importance of establi;;hing an obsern1tory and maintaining a scientific corpA, for one year or more, at one of the higl1est points of the Pacific Itailroad, aud particularly at the eastern rim of the Utah basin." The principal desiderata mentioned in the memorial were the occupation of tlle bigllest point attainaule, and the emplo;yment of the \Jest optica1 means which could be pro,~icJed, ''in order tllat tlle celestial 11henomena observed with the telescope, noted by photography, or analyzed hy the spectroscope," could be coruparecl with similar obscr\·atious made near the sea-level, with a view to deterrui ne the ad vantages to be gained for the ad \-ancement of astronomical science, li.v an elevation of the instruments al.Joye uearJ~r 011e-third, aml certainly the densest strata,of the atmosphere. The sum appropriated by Congress was altogether insufficient to carry out tlle extensive pro· gramme laid out in the_ memorial. The erection of an ol.Jservatory of sufficieut strength to protect the inslrflments duri11g the violeut storms which 1irHail tluring winter on the summits of the Rocky Mouutains would alone ha\·e consumed the greater part of the appropriation. Beiug thus limited as to means, and, consequently, in regard to time, lffOmpt action was necessary in order to secure the montbs most fayomble in respect to weather; and, depcndmg 011 tlie interest very generally felt in the proposed investigations, outside aid was invoked, and was inLlispensaule, Hen for partial results. The Coast, Survey contributed all tllat it coultl uuder the law and the regulations which govern it. An able expert in the science of spectrurn-aual,Yi>is offerecl bis services on accepta.ble conditions, and carried with him; throngh tllc liberality of the trust~es of Dartmoutll College, the splendiil 12-foot eqnatorial and spectroscopic apparatus belouging to that institution. The Army supplied a guarll, from which were drawn suuordinate observers for the meteorologic:il <fepartmeut; aucl free passes for the part,r and the free use of the telegraph-line were given in two instances, to be mentioned hereafter. · The party reached Sherman on the 6th of June, a1Hl consisted, at that date, of myself, B. .A. Colonna, esq., aid, and Mr. '\Verner Suess, electrician and mechanician. On the lOtlJ, a guard, composed of a sergeant and ten men, authorized by tlle honorable SecTetary of War, and selected for their inteligeoce and goo<l character by the comma111laut at Fort D. A. Russell, reported for duty. _Within a week afterward, Assistant A. T. 1\losman arrived, and, ou the 21st, left for Salt Lake City,

to co-operate i11 determining the telegraphic difference of longitude between the two observatories, distant one from the other about 60 30', on the mean parallel of t1° north ; and, on the Gth of .July, Professors C. A. Young and C. F. Emerson joined the part~', to make the astronomical and speetroscopic observations, according to the plan arranged. The instruments carried out were as follows: Time and latitude instrument, No. 13, hy Wiir<lemann, of Wasllington; sidereal chronometer Hutton 202, with break-circuit, by Bond, of Boston; pocket-chronometer, mean time, by Jurgensen; Hipp chronograph, fillets, keys, &c.; battery, repeaters~ and :omrnlries for telegraphic purposes; 10-inch Garn bey theodolite and vertical circle;·· reconnoitering-telescope, 2l inches aperture, by Dollond; sextant and artificial horizon; gradient er, &c.; magnetic apparatus, including theodolittl, magnetometer, dip-circle, &c.; 3 cistern-barometers; 3 sets of psychrometers; 3 detached thermometers; 1 aneroid barometer; 1 anemometer; 1 self-registering maximum-thermometer; 1 seJf.r.egistering minimum-thermometer; 2 black bulbs for solar radiation; 2 hypsometers; 1 atmospheric electrometer; besides Qlicroscopes, scales, clock, complete set of tools for the repairing of instruments, &c.; and, for Assistant Mosman, at Salt Lake City, time and latitude instrument, No. 7, lly \Viirdemanu; sidereal chronometer, with break-circuit, by Bond; Hipp chronograph, battery, repeaters, keys, &c. vVitl1 tlw exception of the meteorological instruments, which were purchased for the occasion from Green, of New York, all on the abon~ list belonged to the lT nited States Uoast Snrvey; some having lwen made at its shops attached to the Office in vYashington. They were packed in 28 boxes, and reached Sherman, June G, in good condition. On the ~7th, 8 additional boxes arriYed; containing the equatorial and spectroscopic apparatus from Dartmcmth College. Sherman, the locality selected for the observations, is sit1mted on the summit of the Black Hills, the easternmost range of the Bocky J\Ionntai ns, and at the highe;;;t elevation crossed by the G nion Pacific Railroad; the track being at that point, as determined by the engineers, 8,:125 feet a born the sea-level. 'rhe summit is a plate.an, the ascent to which, from the MiRsonri Ri,·er, at Omaha, a distance of over fi>e hundred miles, is so gradual that the tnffeler looks in vain for the" Hills." Even when the summit is reached, tbe snow-capped mountains to the westward, a8 seen across the southern terminus of Laramie Valley, are so prominent, and apparently high, as to keep up, in a measure, the illusion that the observer is still on the so-called" Plains." ~mong the characteristic features of the plateau are the isolated piles of granite, which, layer upon layer, stand up like immense ruins, and are, in fact, the remains of a still higher summit; the number of huge masses of the same rock, generally rounded, but frequently weather-worn into fantastic shapes, which are so delicately poised, one upon the other, as to require apparently but a touch to throw them down ; an<l, as the result of this extensive disintegration from atmospheric agencies, the reddish glittering appearance of the soil, composed, to a considerable depth, of an accumulation of crystals of feldspar and quartz. Sherman is a railroad-station, and, in addition to the tickt and telegr~ph office, contains eight or ten small frame-houses, and about thirty inhabitants. A few stunte<l pines are scattered over the plateau; but lower down, on the eastern and western slopes, the canons supply not only firewoml iu abundance but lumber for building-purposes. The necessity of being in close vicinity to the depot and telegraph-wires enal>lecl me to decide, on the same evening I arrived, upon a site for the observatories. This site was an elevation about 650 feet south of, and 33 feet. abo>e, the railroad-track, and commanded a full horizon. Three obsernttories were erected: one for tlie transit, battery, chronograph, and telegraphic apparatus·; another for the meteorological instruments and observers; and a third for the 12-foot equatoriaf. The roof of this last building was divilled into four panels of seasoned plank, each of which could be unclamped and slid off on trestles placed in continuation of the inclination of the roof, either singly or together, as the occasion required. It was erected under the supervision of Mr. Colonna, and, with the exception of the floor, the exact height of w.lticll could not be adjusted until the equatorial was mounted, was completed by the 25th of June. The accompanying topographical sketch of Sherman and its vicinity (see sketch No. 18) will show the position of the obser,ratories in relation to the railroad-track and telegraph-wires. The survey was made by Mr. Colonna. A base 420m.05 in length was measured on a. part of the track found to be straight and level ; and, after a re-determination of the length of the measuring-

wire by re.comparisons with a meter-seale brought for the purpose, the line was remeasured, the two results agreeing within 0.001 of a meter. Starting from this base, a series of triangles and quadrilaterals, with sides gradually increasing i11 length from 500"' to 5,ooom, was laid off, coverin~ the plateau. The horizontal angles and differences of altitude were measured partly by tlu· gradienter, and, in the case of the more <listant points, by ~be 10-inch Gambey theodolite and \'ertical circle. The transit, the meridian-mark, and eccentric station were observed upon ancl intro(lncetl in the scheme, by which means the necessary data were ol>tained for computing the azimuth of each line aud the latitude and longitude of each station. The topographical featnrt>s and mi11or detaih; were determined with a plane.table, improvised for the occasion by Mr. Colonna. The eccentric station abo\·e referred to was established as an additional mark for the preserYa· tion of the point at which the latitude and longitmle obsen·ations were made. It is distant 22.4 feet, and bears north 89° 08' west, tnw, from the center of the block on which tlie transit was mounte<l, and is marked hy a hole drilled in the rock, fa situ, 10 inches deep and 2 inches i11 diameter, a11d filled with lPatl.
LATITl'DE AND LONGI'l'UDE OF
SHER~IAN.

The longitude of the astronomical station at Sherman was determined by telegraphic exchange of clock-heatR with Salt Lake Cits; tlle interdistance, following the line of the wire, being about five hundred miles. Tire observatory at Salt Lake City was the same as that used iu tlie Iougittulecampaign of 1869, during which the difference of longitude between c,imbddge, ou the Atlantie, and San Fra11cisco, 011 the Pacitic, was determined, inclncling two i11trrmecliatP stations, Omaha, on the Missouri Riwr, and Salt Lake City, in Utah Territory. Ry the night of tlte, 2.ith J nne, the transit-instrument, chronograph, antl telegraph-apparatus were monnted and a1ljusted at tLe Sherman observatory, and the poles antl wires were pnt up to connect the Sherman clo1~k, h,\· means of the telegraph-line of tLe Union Pacific Hailroa1l Company, with the clock at Salt Lake Cit,y. Iu the mean time, Assistant Mosman hatl reached the cit,\·; and, finding the transit of Gonmor Brigham Young mounted at the old observatory aud in good coudition, proceeded at once to put it in complete adjustment, and to connect tl1e ohspn·ator,r with tire telegraph -station. By the 28th of June, both observatories were prepared for the interchange of time.signals; lmt, iu consequence of cloudy weather at Sherman and derangements in the circuit, the exc-hauge ditl not commence irntil July 3. Between that date and the 2·ith 1 there were seven nights at Sherman on whicl1 a sufficient number of star-transits were obtained for tlie determination of the local time. The usual course pursued was to observe ten or twelve stars for time and instrumental corrections, equally divided between elamp E and clamp \V, before the exchange of clock-beats; anu a similar series after the exchange. The general result is as follows: 8.

OF

'l'ERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

The measurement of the terrestrial magnetism at Sherman was malle with unifilar magnetometer No. 3, Gauss's construction, aml dip-circle No. 8. The observations were started by Assistant A. T. Mosman and carried on and finished by Mr. ''Verner Suess. The measurements for declina,-. tiou were commenced July 30, and completed on August 3; for h~rizontal intensity on the 3d and 5th, and for dip on the 6th of August. The maguetic observatory was situated 216.5 feet (66m) nearly due west of the astronomical station and about 19.7 feet (6'") below it. Tile observations. were conducted and the results computed according to the methods and formuhe adopted in the Survey, and as fully explained and illustrated in the valuable paper on the subject by Assistant Ch. A. Schott. The results are presented in the following table, with the remark that the intensity iK expressed in English units, as usual in the Survey. Terrestrial ma.gnetism, Sherman.

At 1111 30m, the magnet was iu a continued state of agitation; and, in consequence of the large differences, the set of observations then made for deflection, as well as tbe to· sion.readings, could not be used for the normal intensity. The magnet C 17 was, from time to time, deflected out of the field. At 8 a. m. on August 5, the obser>atious for deflection were resumed; ltnd on th.at occasion, also, the magnet, was disturbed, so much so that it was deemed advisable to reject the first set and to take a second, commencing at 8h 35m a. m. Profossor Young, in his report, refers to these two instances of observed magnetic disturbances at Sherman ; and as they coincided in time with the solar eruptions obimrved by him, he i8 clearly of opinion that the former were iu a great measure a mere response to the latter.
METEOROl,OGY.

The meteorological observatory was a frame-building erected close to the astronomical observatory, and sufficiently large to accommodate both instruments and observers. The building faced to the north, and to this, the highest side, and immediately in front of a small window, the usual latticed frame was bolted ou, within which were suspended, at a. height of 10 feet above t!ie ground, two detached thermometers, two sets of psychrometers, and the maximum and minimum thermom. eters, the two last in a nearly horizontal position. The barometers, two cistern mul one aneroid, were bung up inside, and so placed as t-0 secure, both for adjustment and reading, the proper degree of light from panes of glass inserted for the purpoi0 in the side of the building; and, finally, to inso.re that the eye of the observer should be on the same level with the divisions on the scales, a platform, regulated to the proper height, occupied the interior front of the observatory; and here the observer had his seat and desk, and recorded the readings. The wind-vane, elevated 6 feet above the roof, at tbe northwest angle of tbe building, was so arranged that tb.e direction of the wincl could be read by the observer without leaving the platform

insicle. In the case, however, of the anemometer, which was set up over the northeast augle, it was necessary that the obsen'er shonld go outside and asoend a set of steps in order to read the hourly record of velocity. The ouservations and observers were placed under the special charge of Mr. Colonna. The twenty-four hours were <lidded at first into four aud finally into three watches, for each of which there was a separate observer; and the observers, with a single temporary exception, were enlisted men selected from the guard supplied by the Army. These were carefully trainecl by Mr. Uolonua, and their readings were tested more than once 011 each da,y dnring tlJe progress of the work. As a further security, and with a view to obtai11 some idea of the personal equatio11 of the observers, twelve sets of comparison were made at different dates, tlie results of which are exllibited in Table I. Each set consisted of an adjustment of the cistern and reading of the barometer, a11d, also, of the different thermometers, first by Mr. Colonna. and the11 by the others, one succeeding the other as rapidly as possible. As the attached thermometer, read always after the adjustment of the cistern, was generally higher toward the close of the set, the height of the column was reduced to 320 F. before instituting the comparisons.. Adopting Mr. Colonna's reaclings as the standard for the purpose of this comparison, the mean of tlie differences from that standard, as gh·en at tlie foot of the table, may be considered as the approximate personal error of the different observcn;.

From a careful examination of the records of the comparisons, it wonlll appear thrit the a born differences are due, in part, to changes in the press11re and temperature which occurred during the period, say, from ten to fifteen minutes, require<l by the four obser\'ers to make their respecti\·e acJjustments and readings. The barometers 1936 and 1937 were made by Green of New York, were correct.ed for capillarity, and set to standard. The diameter of the tubes was 0.25 of an inch. The attached and detached thermometers were compared, and found to be correct. The two sets of psychrometcrs, 1807 and 1816, were also compared with the standard, with the following results:

Barometer 1936 and psycbrometer 1807 were adopted for the hourl_y observatious. TIJe otl1er two sets of instrume<nts were observed, a.t equal intervals, four times each day. The height of the barometric column is in all cases reduced to tl~e freezi~g-poi~t. . The observations were commenced on the 17th of June, and c011tmned, without mterrupt10n, to August 15 inclusive, extending through sixty days aud nights.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The full meteorological record is given below. The number of hourly observations amounted to 1,440. Of these, Go;were taken by Colonna, 86 l>y Shanks, 3G3 by Soberg, 44G by .Audrit, and 485 by Oourtru'y, and with ~mcb variation of hours that the errors of adjusting and reading peculiar to each obsen~er were, in a great measure, neutralized iu the· daily and hourly means. Table II presents a condensed statement of the results arranged according to daily means, and will show_at a glance the principal atmospheric phenomena and the relation of one to the other. Eacl1 day represents tl1e meau of the twenty-four hours, except in the case of the velocity of tfie wind, aml)n_this tl1e total yeJocity of the day is given. The el:istic force of Yapor and the relative humidity >vere computed from Williamson's tables. T!Je mean direction of the wintl and of the lower clouds is the ruean or the leading direction of the 2-l hourly _observations. The sky, when entirely overcast, is represente<l by 10, and, when entirely clear, by zero. T!Je mean cloudiness was deduced lly dividing the total amount by the number of"hours for which any degree of cloudiness was entered in the journal. The curves require but little explanation. The_y show considerable aud rapid oscillations in the condition of the atmosphere, and the generally prompt. response of the barometric column to the varying temperature, amount of aqueous vapor in the air, aml directiou and Yelocity of the wind, the combination of which, that is, of the observed and unobsen·ed phenomena, determine the changes iu the atmospheric pressure. The unobsen·ed phenomena are included, as those obsern11l cannot account for all the barometric indications. For insbince, on June 20 and 21 and on .July :3, the high barometers of those dates were preceded by violent winds from the westward, a low temperature, and comparatively dry air. The cloudiness did not extend beyond 5. But, on the 10th and 11th of Jnl,y, there was another high barometer, preceded, accompani..·d, and followed by an a \'erage temperature, unusual amount of moisture, and a Yelocity of wind below the mean, a condition of the atmosphere which did not authorize such high barometer; and we must, therefore, look elsewhere for tile cause. The meteorological journal states that, on the 9th, 10th, and 11th of July, t!Je sky was almost entirely overcast, and that there were frequent shO\Yers, accompanied by thunder and lightning. In consequence of this envelope of clouds, the radiation was obstructed, and the observed temperature of the air at the station was specially high, and not characteristic of the column of air, the weight of which \vas represented by the observed barometer. The southerly wind at the station and the moYement of the upper clouds from a nearly opposite direction, as recorded on the 10th, show the cllaractcr of the two currents, and that we observed the maximum temperature of the lower and warmer stratum.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTE:NDEKT OF

Table III shows tlie tropical hours for the season, and the hours of minimum and maximum temperatm·e and relative humidity, as deduced from the sixty-days set of observations; and Table IV, similar results from the same obsen·ations, di\·ided into four parts. The <1ivision is made in order to determine how close ariy fifteen <lays will sho\V the horary oscillations of the barometer at tbe particular locality and season of the year. The comparisons prove that the hours of the morning maxim nm and of the afternoon minimum were as clearly established by any one of the parts as b.) the whole, while the nigl1t maximum and minimum oscillated from the mean hour by very small quantities. The abnormal Yariations, it will be seen, increased with singular regularity, tb~ increase of pressure being uniform at the rate of .031 for every :fifteen days. The hours of least and highest temperature are allout as clearly de.fined by any one of tlie fifteen-days set as lly the entire series. In regard to relath-e lmmidity, while there is a general c1ecrease from sunrise to noon, and increase from noon to midnight, the hours of maximum and minim nm are not uniform for the parts of the series, nor could t!Jis, or regularity in the l1011rs of ltigh or low temperature, be expected for such short periods, so mtH·h devcnding on the condition of the sk,y and the force and direction of tbe wind.

ANEROID

BA.R0:.\IETEI~.

The aneroid was subjected to different pressures from 20.i:i inches upward, and was compared wit.b, and adjusted to, the standard at 73° and :{2e:>, before it was forwarded to me in May last by Green of New York. From an examination of the journal, or ofTahle II, it will he. seen that the aneroid when at Sherman was always lower than the cistern-barometer, arn1 that the difference varied from 0.149 inch at 420.G to 0.211 inch at 680.2. This divergency from the mercurial barometer would appear to increase, as a general rule, with the rise in temperature. The disagreement at the coldest hours was equivalent to about .080 at the freezing-point, and this qmintity may be considered as the index-error for the high station. Besitles this error, however, the obsen·ations show that there was another, resulting from imperfect compensation, amounting to .003 for every degree in the increase of temperature . .After being used at Sherman, t11e aneroid was sent lmck with the other instruments to tLe Office in Washington, reaching the city in September; anll betw<·e11 November rn, 187'.!, :rnd February 27, 1873, a series of comparisons was made between the sarrn~ barometers, with a view to ascertain whether the agreement, which existed pmdous to their trnn:sport<ition to an elcnition of 8,000 feet, would be renewed on their return to the len·l of tlte sea. In all such comparisous, it must be borne in mind that, while the cistern-barometer can be read to .002, the scale· of the aneroid will not admit of a closer reading than .020; arnl ewu this reading is subject to an error from parallax arising from the distance between the index ant1 the scale-t1i\""isions. Tile mercurial barometer was reduced, as usual, to the freezing-point. During the ordinary changes in the atmospheric pressure, the differences between the readings of the two barometers were alwa.ys less than .01, or within the probable error of reading. During

84

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

great and rapid changes in the pressure, the differences were as high as .03; one ot' the barometers sbowtug the changes sooner than the other. During the intensely cold weatller of December, the aneroid was cooled to l()O F., when it was .033 lower than U1e othPr; and, on the sarne day, the aneroid was placed before the hot-air furnace and heated certainly to 100° F., when it was .08 lower. For seven da~-s following the exposure of the aneroiu to these extremes of tem1ieratllre, the differences between the two were q nite irregular, varying from .00 to .04; bnt, after tile senmth day, the agreement was as good as before the exposure. These recomparisons, for which I am indebtecl to J)r. A. Zumhrock, of the Coast Survey Office, show that tlie apparatus for compensation of teni· perature was iu a better colldition at 29.9 than at 23.:1.
SOLAR RADIATION.

The tl.Jrec solar maximum radiation thermometers, num!Jeretl in the record l, 2, and 3, were constructed according to tho ;;nggestions of Sir .Tolin Herschel, aud, 1.Jeing those now generally adopted to obtain the heat of t.he sun's rays free from the influeuce of vapor and of passing eurreuts of air·, are too well known to require description. Each rpsted i11 a bracket fastened to the top of a stand four feet in height and firmly planted in the ground. They were placed in a nearly liorizontal position, with their 1.JullJs tffthe south, and secured in position liy movalile buttons. The observations were made llourly from 4 a. m. to 8 p. ru., including the moments of sunrise and sunset, and without regard to the condition of tlie sky. The record, howeYer, (Appendix B, which it is not necessary to priut in full,) siic)ws at what lwurs tile suu was more or less obscured, as well as the hours when the bulus received tile full heat of the sun's rays. vVhen the temperature was rising, the thel'lnomet~rs were reaJ before setting, and, ·when it was falling, they were read immediately after the setting. Tbe setting consisted iu taking the thermometer from its bracket and moving it up and down until tbe mercury in tile tn!Je reached tlw lowest point permitted by the temperature of tbe mercury in the blackeued bulb and stem. It was then replaced, as before. During the moming, the ohservatio11, for im;tauce, at 10 o'clock represented the maximum temper. ature which had occurred during the preceding hour, while, in the afternoon, tbe reading gave the radiation as it e:idsted at the particular moment for which it was recordetl. It would have been better, }lerhaps, to have observed in the morniug in the same manner as was <lone later in the day, for the reason that in the dry, cold atmosphere of the station, the tern perature of the air was immediately affected by a cloud-shadow, and, when such occurred at any morning hour, the air-thermo meter showed a minimum for that moment, while the radiation-thermometers expressed the maximum, which may have taken place thirty minutes previous. The observations made under these circumstances have been excluded, as far as possible, in making up the results. lt will be seen that the three thermometers differe1l always, aud, at times, very largely all(l without uniformity. The want of regularity in the differences may be due, in part, to carelessness in reading Nos. 2 and 3, as No. 1, made by Casella, London, was looked upon as the best at a very early date, and the observer was directed to he specially careful iu setting aud reading it. Thermometer No. 1 was, and has been, adopted as the most reliable, from the fa.ct that it recorded a higher temperature; showing that the vacuum in which it was confined was more perfect than . that of either of the two others. The obsenations were extended through a period of fifty-one days, and have been divided into three sets of seventeen days, for each of which the mean time of sunrise and sunset and the mean altitude of the sun at noon have been compnted. Table V, compiled from Appendix: B, shows the excess of the readings of the ulack bulb in eactw over those of the ordinary air-thermometer protected from the sun ; and Table VI, the same results in a more condensed form, iuclmling a special column containing the mNm of the observations taken on tbe nine days of clearest weather, viz, July 1, 2, 5, 20, 29, 30, and 31, and August 5 and 14. Adopting the last column as best expressive of the relative value of the results, we find that the amount of solar radiation was not excessive; that it was the greatest at noon ; that it decreased with the daily decreasing altitude of the sun; and that there was less clou<ly weather and fewer passing clouds in the forenoon than during the afternoou.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.

Observations for atmospheric electricity were made between 8 a. rn. and 9 ll· m. on twentyfi ve days, commencing July 10 and ending .August 12; and, although incomplete in some respects,

they are presented with the lJope.that the unusual altitt1de at which they were taken would give to them an interest not authorized by so short a series. The electrometer was made for the occasio11 by Mr. Werner Suess, of the Coast Survey Office, a mechanician of great skill and au expert in electrical science, and the field observations were placed under his special charge. In his report he gives a drawing, (here omitted,) and the following description of the apparatus: (A) represents a dry battery made of disks of common silver paper, covered on the paper side with oxide of manganese and inclosed in two glass tubes. In one of the tubes, the manganese side of the paper is up and the ball is marked +· . In the other, the silver side is on top, and the ball is marked-. Between these two balls, a piece of very thin gold-leaf, -! inch wide, (B,) is suspended, and fastened to the sruall ball (a) with a little glue. The other small ball (a 1) carries a fork of brass wire, (c,) 1uovided with the disks (d, d 1.) The letters (b, b) show the wire-connections with the larger ha11, (C). The glass tube (E) with the brass end-pieces (h, lt) carries the ball, (F.) The wire (i) in the glass tube (E) completed the metallic connection between C aud P. The stand (g} carries on its upper end an agate center, on which the point of the fine steel-wire needle (e) is playing. The ends of this slightly-magnetized needle are resting against the disks, (d, d.) The whole is inclosed in the framed box (D) provided with windows on the four vertical sides. (K) isa hinge. The movable arm (p) with ball (G) can be m.oved to the ball (F) by means of the string (l,) as shown by the dotted lines. (M) is a weight equalizing the weight of ( p, G.) All the parts already described are adjusted inside of the observatory.

Outside of the building, aml at a distance of 60 feet from it, a mast, (P,) 40 feet in height, was erected. To the upper end is fastened, by means of glass insulators, (o, 0 1 ,) the liglitning-rod point (0.) An insnlatetl wire, (n,) fastened to the lower end of (O,) leads through the wall of the observiug-room direct to hinge (K.) The drawing shows the movable ball (G) in contact with ball(~) of the ground-connection. To make observations, the observer has to bring ball (G,) by means of the string (l,) in slight contact with ball (F.) If there is any atmospheric electricity, it will be communicated to ball (F) and charge the gold-leaf (B) and the disks (<l, !l) with the same. For example, we will obtain + electricity when the gold-leaf will be attracted toward the + ball. To prevPnt erroneous readings, the balls are marked with the electricity of the leaf. At the same moment, the disks (a, d) me charged with plus electricity, and, by contact, the needle (e.) T'.To concluctors, charged with the same electricity, are repulsi>e in proportion to tlle p-0wer of the latter, and the angle of the declination ma.' be read on the diYided circle (7.') fastened to the stan<l (g) by the arms (/,/.) After each obsenation, the ball (G) has to be removed to (N) agaiu. By this arrangement, not only very feeble degrees of electricity may be obser>e<l, hut the avparatns can be used during the hea>iest thunder-storms without danger. ln cases of the latter character, the ball (G) is remoyed onl:r one-fourth of a11 inch from the ball (N), allowing the sparks to pass to the ground during the prevalence of the storm, and at the same time i)ermittiug, by communication, the quality and quantity of the electricity to be marke(l on the apparntus. A distance of two feet, from F to N, was found sufficient during two months' observations, "·ith occasional very heavy thunder-storms. The whole arrange· ment worked admirably, but is, of course, subject to improvement. Table YIU presents the resnlts, with tlw omission of more than thirt;r observations, made tlay and night, but principally at S a. m., during clear weather, when no trace of electricity waR dis· covered. From this recor<l, it would appe~tr tbat electricit,y existed, or was only collected during the pre·alence of great commotions in the atmosphere, and that the kind and intensity followed 110 general law. The entire abseuce of electricity during comparati\ely serene days may hB due partly to the colll, dry atmosphere of the station, and, in some measure, to the incapacity of the electrometer to detect slight amounts. To provide against such a contingency in the future at elevations similar to that of Sherman, l\Ir. Suess suggests that the collectors of atmospheric electricity shoulll command a more extended area; aml tlrnt, for this purpose, instead of one, fonr masts should be erected, about 400 feet apart; and that, in place of tlrn lightning-rod point, there should be substituted a ball of thin copper or brass, from 10 to 1'..! inches in diameter, to he fastened to an iron bar raised about 18 inches abo;-e the top of each mast, aml secured to it by insulators. It was a source of regret that, owing to other more important duties devolving 011 1\Ir. Suess, it was not possi\Jle for him to take a more regular and exteuded series of hourly observations.

ALTITUDE OF THE ASTRONOMICAL STATION.
SPIRIT-LEVEL.

The beight above the sea-level of the railroad-track at Sherman, as given by tltc engineers who constructed the road, is 8,235 feet. The astronomical and meteorological station was 33 feet above the track, and, bencc, 8,268 feet above the sea. This result, however, cannot be accepted as con· elusive. Its reliability is afl'ectell by the probable errors committed in the leveling, especially when conducted by the ordinary method, of a series of lines amounting iu the aggregate to o\-e1· 2,000 miles in length, and hy errors in the grTMluation of the leveling-rods. Of the first uncertainty, no estimate of its value can be made, and we will, therefore, assume that the plus compensated for the minus errors. In regard to the second, we have only to suppose that the foot-divisions of the rod were inaccurate tu the extent of -lu of an inch, which is very generally the case, and adopting the given altitude of Omaha, 966 feet, as critically correct, we have for the line from Omaha to Sherman, a distance of 549 miles, with a gradual rise of 7,270 feet, a probable error of

± 30 feet. The heigbt of the station, from the spirit-leveling operations may be, therefore, stated
to be 8,268 ieet

to Dr. G. Engelmann, of Saint Louis, for a transcript of those taken by him during ,June, July, and August, and also to General Albert Myer, Uhief-Signal Officer, U. S. A., for those of a like uate made under his direction at the Signal-Office in Washington; and I take pleasure in acknowledging the courtesy and prom1)t ness with which both complied with my request. B~side.s these two series of corresponding observations, the mean barometer for the period, as estabhshed by more than one year's obserYatious at Saiut Louis, Girard College, Sacramento, San Francisco, and Astoria, bas heen introduced fur simihw comparisnns; a.1ul for the purpose nf showing and of throwing out, if necessal'J, any special discrepancy which might be found to exist, the sixt,y-days' set has been di\"ided into four periods of fifteen clays each, as exhibited iu Tables IX, X, and XI. Saint Louis (1).-This statiou, the present residence of Dr. Engelmann, is about two miles west of Saint Louis; the cistern of the bttrometer IJeing 3±9 feet above the Gulf of Mexico. The obse1·vations were made at the hours of 7 a. m. and 2 and !) p. m., representing the mean of the twentyfonr. The wet bulb was not observed. WaskingtMi.-The observations at the Signal-Office were made honrly, and, besides the usual corrections for instrumeutal error and temperature, were reduced to the sea-level. Saint Louis (2 ).-The data in this case, the mean of the years lSGO, 18Gl, and 1862, are derived from the meteorological tables published hy Dr. Bt1gelmann iu the Transactions of the Academy of Science of Saint.Louis. During these years, Dr. Engelmann residecl in the city; the cistern of the barometer being 481 feet above the Gulf of Mexico. · Girard CoUege, Pkiladelphia.-The results in the table are the mean of the period during the five years' series taken in 1840, 1841, 1842, 1843, aud 1844, undee the directiou of Prof. A. D. Baehe. Sacramento, San Francisco, and Astoria.-'.rhe data for these stations were obtained from the ten-days' observation:,; in each month for two successh'e years, as published l>y Col. R S. Williamson, Coeps of Bogiueers, U. S. A .. in his paper "On the nse of the l>arometer." The relative humidity and elastic force of vapor for Sherman were computed, as lieretofore stated, from Wi1liamson's tal.Jles. . The formul:E and tables used in the computations of the difference of height. between Sherman and the otller stations were those of Dr. Richltnl Rulilmann, professor iu tlle Polytechnic School aL Cal'lsruhe, published at Leipsic in 1870. The cistern of the barometer at the astronomical i;;tation was eight feetalJo\'e the ground, and thii> quantity must be, therefore, deducted from any computed diffet·euce of lleight from the _Sherman obioervations. The correction for relatirn humidity, or tbe elastic force of vapor, has not, in auy case, been applied. Table.XI shows that the first period of fifteen days gives results much higher, in every case, than the three other periods. This fact points to Sherman as the cause. Upon examination of the record and of Diagram I, we find that between the 21st of .June and the 1st of July, dates embraced ·within the aboye period, the barometer at Sherman fell over half an iucl!. Of course, it cuukl lutr<lly be expected that this great change in the atmospheric pressure would be felt, during the summerseason, at so great a distance as the 11\eridian of Sctiut Louis, and still less of Washington; nor <lo we find at those stations any response, either following 01· preceding, to this exceptioually low barometer at Sherman. The pressure is never the same, except under unusually favorable circumstances, beyond a radius of fifteen miles, so that, unless the two stations were situated within that area, simultaneous observations for a short period give only approximate results; the uncertaiut_y increasing with the distance. When, however, that distance is from 150 to 300 of longitude, the very best observations cease to be corresponding, and the mean of the period for any year or series of years would afford results equally reliable, and especially between a. station of high elevation in the interior and those situated in such an ent.irely different climate as the valley of the Mississippi and the Atlantic seaboard. Rejecting, therefore, the first period as evidently exceJltional, and adopting the other three as representing the true mean barometer for the station ancl dates, we find that the results from the four stations to the eastward are sufficiently harmonious to entitle them to considerable weight. in H. Ex. 240--12

tl1e (1iscn,;8ion of the altitude; and the same may IJe saicl of the heights dednced from the thrt>e stations to the westward, notwithstanding the two sets of results differ more than 100 feet. The observations ou the Pacific coast were taken on 0111,v ten dayR of the month, and are not, therefore, strictl~ entitled to the Kame weight as the full series on the Atlantic coast. In view, however, of all the facts, the mea11 of tlie two sets, 8,312 feet, has been taken to represent the height of the station as deduced from the barnmetrical observations; and, assigning to this rnean an equal weight with the spirit-leveling, the mean of the two shows the altitude of the astronomical station at Shermai1 to be 8,290 feet above the sea-len·I.

BOILING POINT APPA.HA.'l'US.

The temperature of the Yapoi· of boiling water was tletermined by one of Oasella's hypRometer8, No. 9776. Sixteen mean results, obtained on twelrn days in July and August, show th:tt the bnilingpoint, at the altitude of Sherman, ranged from 197°.02 F. to 1970,70 .P.; the variations following the :tluctuatiom; in the atmospheric pressure. The results are given in Table XII. The mean temperature of the boiling-point was 197°.32, and the obeerved height of the barometric column for the same hours and series was 22.305. Now, if we adopt 1970.32 as correct, :tut! compute, by means of tlrn Smitllsouiau taules, what the pressure should have been for that, tempemtnre, we find ti.tat the barometer should lrnse read ~~.1rn, or 0.127 lower than was actuallj' obser\·ed; or, if tlie barometer was cotTcct, the theoretical temperature should have !Jeen 1970.59, or 0°.27 hig·her than observed. 'Vi th ~t view to test the accuracy of the scale of the Casella thermometer at :.n~ 0 , the tempera tum at which it was standarded, a series of careful comparisons were made at rny request, under the special direction of Prof. J.E. Hilgard, assistant, iu clrnrge of the Office, the n·su1ts of which are given in Tablt-1 XIII. Tht-1 comparisons show that, at a mean pressurn of 29.9G7, the boiling-1Joiut stood at 21Z0.087; being almost identically the smne as that deduced from the same pi·essure by means of Moritz's revision of Regnault's tables. It is, therefore, helieYecl that the thermometer was correct, and that its scale had not changed since it was made; and, as it it> not probable that so great an error as 0.127 could ha\·e l.Jeeu committed bj· the different observers in adjusting antl reading the Sherman barometer, the discrepancy must be referred to the tableR and to possible mistakes, amounting to one-quarter of a degree of l!'ahrenheit in the fietd-determinations. It should be stated in this connection that the hypsometer was observed at a point- about .030 of the barometric column below the cistern at flie astronomical station; and, also, that the aneroid and !Joiling-point apparatus were iu excellent accordance. Adopting, for the sake of illustration, the observed temperature. of 197°.32 as correct, we find 22.178 in the table as the corresponding atmospheric pressure, from which must be subtracted the quantity .030 to reduce it to the upper station. ·with these new values, 22.148 for the !Jarometcr and 600.2 for the temperature of the air, the height of the astronomical station would be about 8,416 feet above the sea-level, a result showing that the thermometrical measurement conld not be depended on in this case within about 126 feet of what may be assumed as the true altitude.

HEIGHT OF LONG'S PEAK, ETC.

After the t.riangulation of the plateau was completed, the longest lines were used as bases for cletermining the position and altitude of some of the prominent and distant mountain-peaks iu view from the station. In consequence, however, of the short length of the bases in comparison with the long lines to be determined, and of the absence of si.gmtls on the summits and of any dis. t.inguishiug ma1·k which coulcl be pointed at with equal certainty at all the stationi,i, the angles at the rnountain-peak:s were very small, averaging so, and their determination merely a.pproximate. 'fhe double zenith·distances of Me<licine Bow allll Mount Agassiz were observed at 6 p. m., Angnst 7; the barometer standiug at 22.239, and the dry and wet bulbs, respectively, at 630.3 and 51 o J<'ab renheit. The olJsei·vations on Long'.-, Peak were watle the next aftemoou at the same hour,

when the barometer showed 22.216 and the dry and wet bulbs 490,3 and 4flo.s. The higlwst part of Medicine Bow range, the summit observed upon, and Long's Peak, are alwa~·s covered with 1mow. \Vith the above data and Struve's formula, the co-efficient of the 110rmal refraction was computed for each line:
( K _ -

o·0 ~ .1~98) B I 238 + --::;r· 736.586

(20 - T)

iu whichK = the mean height of the riiy aborn tile ground, in meters; B = height of barometer in millimeters 7 rednced to freezing-point; and T = tbe temperature of the air in ceutesimal degrees. The co-efficient for Medicine Dow was .05791; for 1\fount Agassiz, .058.1; and for J.Joug·'s Peak .05595; but, as the refraction increases slowly, and then more l'aJlidly after the midday hours, tlt~ above values do not represent the co-efficients at the hour of observation .. In tile absence of a reliable table of the hourly rates of increase and decrease for altitudes similar to that of Sherma11, we have assumed one-fifth of the normal refraction as the increase from 4 to G p. 111. The n·s11lts with their probable errors, principally of distance, are giveu in the following tat.le, and are ba;.Pd npon the latitude, longitude, a.nd Leight of the astronomical station, as girnu in the preceding pages:

SHERMAN, ITS ATMOSPHERE .AND CLIM.ATE.

The advantages which follow an elevation of the telescope abo\·e the denser stra:ta of tile atmosphere are a lower and more uniform temperature, a proportional dryness or decrease of aqneous vapor, less refraction, increased darkness of the interstellar spaces in consequence of there being so much leRs atmosphere to produce color, and, for the same reason, the comparative alJsencP of interfering lines in tlrn spectra of tbe heavenly bodies, and, as the general reRnlt, au improved brightness, definition, and steadiness of the stars and degree of accuracy with which celestial pile. nomena can be noted. As the advantages theoretica.]]y belongiug to tile altitnde are modified by the atmospheric conditions dependent on the locality, the results of the meteornlogical ohserrntion 8 made during our stay at Sherman become of the first importance in considering the aYailauility of the position for a permanent observatory. A description of the locality and of the wide plains to the eastward and mountain-ranges to the westward bas been already given. In regard to the sate transportation of iw;trurnents, accessibility at all times, and supplies, Sherman possesses adYantages not equaled by any similar altitude iu Enrope or America. In respect to weather, it may be generally stated that the 7:! days spent there during June, July, and August were characterized b;y excessive cloudiness; b~' high winds from the westward; by the various directions in which the cloud-strata would be moviug at the same time; by the suddenness with whieh the sky would lJc overcast and t-Oen become clear again; and, as a. cousequenoo, by a great uncertaiut,\.· in regard to the dnration of favorable hours for astronomical observa.tious. This conditfoa of the Mmosphere, resulting from the juxt11positiou of the station to the snow-covered ranges to the westward a!J(l the ht'ated air over the plains, wonld appear to Indicate that the altitude was somewhat too great~ being within the region of the lower clouds or mist-formations; a.nd the same objed.ion conltl be urged against tlw oeeU[Httiuu of m1~· of· the higher aititudes situated withiu view tv the westward and from forty to i;eveutv miles t!ii;-

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

tant. In no instance were clouds observed to hang on the mountain-side; but when any existed and were visible from Sherman, they enveloped the summit. It frequently occurred that there was bright, clear weather at Laramie, twenty-four miles west and 1,000 feet lower, and at Cheyenne, thirty-three miles to the eastward and 2,000 feet lower. Assistant Mosman had clear weather, night after night, at Salt Lake Uity, when it was the worst at Sherman. Tlie mean temperature during the sixty days of observation, or season, when the day-temperature would be the highest and the extremes the greatest, was 5G0.5 :F.; the range being from the minimum, 47°.8, just before day-break, to tbe maximum, 650.4, at noon. There were twenty-two days on which the temperature of the warmest hour reached or exceeded 700, and only one wl1en the mercury showecl as higb as 80°. Fires were generally necessary after sun-dowu, and acceptable for half the time during the day, especially when the wind was strong. The absolute quantity of aqueous vapor in the air was about 50 per cent. less than is recorded for Saint Louis ; aud yet it wai;., no doubt, exceptionally large for the season, in c6nsequenee of the amount of snow remaining on the mountain-slopes from the excessive fall of the previous winter. The dryness of the air was further illustrated by rapid CYaporation ; by unusual and almost immediate shrinkage of newly-cut lumber; and by the fact that there was no perspiration, no anima,l putrefaction, aurl no mold. Dew was never seen; the dew-1ioint being invariably lower than the temperature of the air.. The mean evaporation of water exposed for twenty-four hours on the roof of the meteorological observatory was, for ele,·en llays of careful comparison and measurement, sixfold greater than within the building. The total quantity of rain and melted hail and snow which fell during the sixty days amounted to 2.55 inches. The wind was at times very strong, and frequently continued so day and night, constituting dry gat.s. The velocity ranged from 2 to 43. 7 miles per hour; there being Yery few occai;ions on which it was entirely calm. 'fhe yelocity per day varied from 167 to 760 miles; the average being 332 miles. The general direction of the wind was from th~ mountains to the plains, or from the quarter between the northwest and south west; the proportion from this direction was 53 per cent.; from southwest t-0 southeast, 25 ·per cent. ; from southeast to northeast, 12 iier cent. ; and from northeast to northwest, 10 per cent. The direction of the upper winds, as determined by the movements of the upper clouds, was, as a general rule, from northwest to southwest. Notwithstanding the prevalence of cloudy weather, we had opportunities of making all of the observations which we had proposed, and of fully reali:t:ing the advantages of the altitude for astronomical purposes. Wilen the sky was entirely free from clouds, the :firmament was indescribably llrilliant from the appearance of a host of stars of the sixtli and seventh magnitudes, rarely, if ever, seen uear the sea-level by the unassisted eye. Stars of the fifth magnitude were observed for some time before sunset with the telescope of the small portable transit; and the companion to PolariR, a star of the ninth magnitude, appeared, always distinct and only slightly quivering, with a 2iinr~h object-glass and a powe.r of 4.'i. The increased steadiuess iwd definition of the fJ-0 time-stars observed h.r me were readily recognized. Those of the first magnitude, snch as Antares1 were too large and brilliant for precise transits. The number of telescopic stars was increased by two or three magnitudes. The special observations, however, to determine the value of the elevation in the observing of celestial phenomena werem;tde by Prof. C. A.. Yoang. It will suffice I.Jere to sta.te that his telescope and spectroscopic apparatus were the largest and mo1St powerful ever mounted at so high an altitude; .and being the same instruments which he had employed for so many years, and with such distiugnisbed success, at Dartmouth College, he was enabled to make direct cointlarisons of the most interesting and decisive character. Jn his report, which will accom1iany this, he gives it as his cleliberate opinion that the elevation of S,000 feet made his 9.4-inch object-glass equal in power to a 12-incll glass at the sea-level. Before closing this revort, l beg to acknowledge the assistance given to the expedition by the iletail of a guard snpplietl by Genera} K 0. C. Ord, under the authority of the Secretary of War, and made doubly efficient hy the care with which the men were selected by the commandant at Fort

HEPOHT OF THE SDPEin:NTENDENT OF

It is not necessary to say much about the weather, as iui;;pection of the mcteorological repo1t will at once sllow the state of things. For a week and more after our arrirnl, it was exceedingly discouraging; and, during our whole sta~-, only about. one day iu three tnnwd out good euoug·h for ollsernitiou; and the proportilm of good 11ights was Clmsidem\Jly smaller. 'l'l1e co11trast. betwec.n the climates of Shennau aud S:tlt Lake Oit;y was very strikiug. It is, ltowc,·er, 011ly jnst to alh1 th:it all the citizens of Sllerman concur iu representing the summer at:- a ,·er,v mrn>;ual oue in respect to it::; cloud inc;;::;; and this ii' quite prollable, since the amonut ot s11ow whieh foll the preceding whiter was entirely unprecedented, a]l(l at the end of .July it was still l:yiug to a depth of 8 feet on the plateau from which rises the l\Iedicine Bow l\fouutain, abont fifty miles "·est of our station. This was the report of J\Ir. Gardner, the topograpller of King'» geological expe1litio11, who twice visited us. It is easy to see that the moisture from sttch a body of melting snow, c,nTiell by the pn:wailiug westerly winds, couhl hardly fail to affect the clearness of onr sky. But when the ::;ky was cleft!', it was beautifully so. At, uight, hundreds of small stars, wbieh I never i,mw at home, came oat dbtinct1y. Thus, within the " Bowl of the DippPr''-the quadrilateral marketl us a, {3 1 r, a.ml '~ Ursa· :Uajori1>-l I.Jave been accustom ell, under f;wornbh~ circu111sta11cei:;, to c:onut three stars with glimpse:-, of a fourth; at Sherman, I eoul\l see c·iglit: and l'rofesi:;or Emerson, whose eyes seem to be superior to mine, could sec ten, aud sometimes cle\'en. Indeed, I tllink a majority of the star" rated i11 1'he British As1:1ociatio11 Catalogue of the seventh magnitnde were fail'ly within reach of the rnikell eye. The Milky- Way especially was magnificently brilliant near the southl'rn hori;1,on as well as in tl1e zenith. a Lyne was seYeral times ol.Jsenetl with the naked eye from 10 to 13 miuntes llefore sunset . .A,,; observations of the Sllll reqnired about as many hours of work cac]1 day as my eyes wonltl hear, I did less at night with the telescope than I otherwise should ; spending 011 sesen 1liffe1·e11t 11ights perhaps three or fonr hours each. On two of these 11ight,;, the sePi11g 1rn;, exf)ni,.;itPlS }H'I'· fret; on two otlwrs, ver,r tine .i and on the other tliree, it ranged from fair to poor, ·i. e., there was more or foss quivering and twitching of the imagN;. .As tiosts of definition, I tried ;; Cygni, :; Herculis, .~ E<Jnuki, p 2 Jfrrcuiis, and r 2 Audronwda_~. All of these were readily seen, of course, an<l vel'y beau ti folly so on tlie hest nights; the hackgTom11l being far more dark, and the images cleaner and shaqwr than I had ever ;,eeu them. rCoron:c WllS tried, hut J eonl1l only snspt,et that the image was a littlil ''"edge-sliaped. , Bootis seemed to me iwrfcetly rou11e1, with a power of 1,'.WO, and the air almost perfo<t\y steatly. Ha dug witl1 me only Stnn·e'::; '' illensur<r ,1licrometrica:,~' Smyth's Celestial Oyclf', and \\'ebll's Ii ttle hook, l wa::; uot prepared for auy very serious work. I picked up two or three double stars, 11ot in either of 1.lieir catalognes, (otw of them, H. A.

Different vapors, too, would'· tl1in out," ns Mr. Lock_yer expresses it, aud lo1:1e theil' lnmiun;,;ity at Yer.\' d1fterent rates. -, As a consequence of this Yimv, that portion of the solar atmosphere just auO\·e the photosplrnrc must coutain, in tile g<tseous form, all the snushtU<'.PS existing in the photosphere itself; and the absorption of sncll a regiou acconntR for the Fra1rnhofer lines as seen. Further, wh1;rn~ver the direct light of llie snu is exduded, a1:1 i11 a total eclipse, we onght to get, for the spedrum of this layt'r 11ext the photosphere, a pm;itiYe or brigh t-linecl spectrum completL', with all the I<'mnnhofor lines ren'rsetl; as the elevation increases, we should find certain of the lines bt~cominµ; fainter, and tl1eu va11i::ihing, at a height depe1Hling n~ry much, in most instances, npnn the peill.·ction of the spedroscnpe ernploycd arnl the seusitin'1Jes8 of the ohser\·er',; eye. It might, howm·er, Ycry possibly liapp(~ll that the lines of some snhstances woul(l tlisappear suddenly at some particular eleYation, whcrn the temperature falls to a certain critical point, or some associate11 chemic1tl efo1ue11t ceases to react. Tlt(· apparently 1lefinite upper limit of the cht'tH11osplrnre ma,y perhaps he explai11l·1l i11 tl1is way. The hydrogPn-speet1·um here nmlerg()es a suddeu and 8lrnrp dp.gradat.ion of brilliaiH~e, although, m; we 11ow know, this gas extends high into the coronal regimrn. The "D:i-stnff," however, whate\·er that may uc, ct·ases entii·ely at the uoundary of the cl1romo;.;phem, so that, as Proctor sngg·ests, it loolrn very mneh a1> if the lJrightness of the hydrogen in the chromospl.crn were mainly dn(I to its m;o<ociittion with this other mysterious sub8tance. Unusual lli8turLances of the solar surface would, of courRe, cany Yapors (antl often, perhaps, masses of solid or liqnill matter) far aboYe their onlit1ary habitat. Tltesl': dews, I think, are fully conlirnwd uy all the ohst·n·atio11s tlms far made. Tile existence of a thin layer at the uase of the elll'o11wspberP, whose spectrnm re\·en;es all the Frnu11l1of'er Jines, a fact which has been rather persistently tloubteu in some quarters, would seem to lie satisfactorily established lJy the observations of the late total eclipse it1 Iudi,1, and the still later observations of l\lr. l'ogson on the annular eclipse of last, J nne. or conrne, the refiectfrc power of our own atmosphere is the only cause v1·hich prm'ents onr seci11g tl1is reYen;al at auy time. Tlw spectrnlll of the illuminated air uear the Rtrn's place is simp1y a complete solar 8pectrum of consi(lerablt· brilliance with all it;.i dark Hues. \Vhen now this is snperposed upon a11other spectrum containiug- tlie same linPs bright, t11e11, according to the relati 1·e intensity of the spectra, the result ma~- lw, either a solar spectrum with its dark line>' wea keued; a bright-line spectrum with the urig·ht lines re1ic1pre1l faint by the brilliance of tlw continuous spectnuu which is nuHlc to form its hackgTonull; or, Jinally, if tl1twe i8 au npproximatc comJH'Bsation, a co11tiuuous spectrum with all lines seHl'ihly oblikrated; and it rnas happc11, aiso, if the bright line:; in the oue spectrnm do not ('01·n·ispo11d in iutensity to the tlark liucs of the other, (wl1ich is actnall,y the c:tse,) that while some li1H·s are simply ohliterafr(l, others will be distinctly bright, auu othen; ,yet strollgly dark. Ill >ew Bngfallll, the first is the actual result; at the very edge of the sun the tlark lines am somewhat weakmiell, hut, geuerally speaking, tliere is no rm·ersal. In Italy, Fa~her Secclii long ago reported that a thi11 layer close to the limu gives a sensiuly con ti 1n1ons <>peetrnm.

of the sun from that of the region outside, there was a narrow Rtr!'ak, in which many of the Jinc 8 turned bright, most of them seusibly vanished, while Rome perl'isted, though g:e;ierall:; much weakened. This effect was still better seen on placing the 8lit at an angle of F"IG.1. not more than so to 100 with tbe limb. vVheu it m1R rnmlP t:lllgeutial then, just as the image of the sun':s limb tnuc:hPd the slit, the dark lines, for the most part, either turned l>right, OL' more or lt·ss cornpletelv disappeared. · The thickness of ihe layer producing this effect could not ban~ been more than 2", and I think wa8 inside of 1"; that is to say, it wa;;; only within five hundred or one thousand miles from the snrface of tlle photosphere th at the vapors to wllicli ar{' due most of tile dark lilies exiRt iu suflkil'llt qn:rntity and suitable condition to manifest tbeir presencr, sulljPet to the ntrnoRpheric au<l i11strumP11tal limitations under which I observed. The co11stitntion of tlw diromosplierl' being- snch as I liani indicated, the observation of the llriglit linef' in itf' spectrum lieco11H'8 perhaps of Jpss i11tPrest tl1a11 if only a few were to be discovered in it. Still, this ki11rl of \rnrk is 11ot witliont Yalll(', since tlw lines most eaRily seen are naturally those wliich are reall.r most cu11spic11011s in tl1e spedrnm of the chromosphere, and this conspicuousness Rtands in important. hut by 1w mea11R ohYion,.;, or t'Yen entirely simple, relations to the intensity of the correRpondi11g <lark linet:, when 1mcl1 C'Xist; that is to say, the lines which are conspicuous as dark lines in the Rolm· RJWctrnm are not at all cPrtai11 to be equally conspicuous as bright liues in tllc ehromospliere-spPctrum, so that tlie latter s1wctr11m still remains a separate and important subject of invt>stigatiou. lt eamrnt hl~ clo11hte1l that a careful study of these bright lines, and tlleir behavior, will IJriug ont many significant fact,.; a,.; to t lie constitution an<l habitudes of the solar atmosphere. I accordingly took great pains to determine a,; accur::itel;y as possible the position of eYery line I was able to perceive reversed. At Dartmouth College, I had succec·ded in making ont a Ji,;t of 103. I do not know of an,ything which brings out the atmospheric adYautages of Slierman more· clearly than the fact that here, in the course of six weeks, I oh~erYed not only all thoOie (H't·Yionsly seen, but 170 new ones in additiou. I give herewith a catalogue of all the lines ohsern·<l. 1 t H'ems to me Yery singular that no new bright lines should have been found below C, It wa.~ not for want of careful searcll. The only ones among the new lines of auy especial importance arc thr H's. 'fl1e!'e RPPm to he always reversed in the spectrum of tlie cllromosphere; at least, after their firRt <li!-iCOY4'rj-, I H<'Yer bad any difficulty in percefring their reversal whe11 tl1e seeing was good; or, ratlicr, I waR al wa>-" able to do it, for the observation waR never a really eas~- one, but reqnirrd tlw ut"e of eYCl',Y precaution in the way of excluding extraneous light, carefu1 adjustment of tue slit in the focus of the telescope for the particular rays, &c. As will be seen a little further ou, the same lines are alRo re>ersccl in the spot-spectrum. I am persuaded that there are many more of these ehromospheric bright lines in tlte ultraviolet portion of the spectrum, which could probably be found by rnearrn of photography. The telescope used for the purpose of searching for tllem ought to be corrected tor photograph,Y, (nnlPS>i a reflector is employed,) and the clock-work would need to run ver.r perfectly. In the catalogue, the first column cont:iins simply a reference-nnml1er; at refers to a notl' at the end of the catalogue. The numbers in the second column refer to my "Preliminary Catalogue," containing 103 line;;, which was published a year ago in the "American ,Journal of Science." ln thiR colnmu, a t indicates that some other observer has anticipated me in the determination and publication of the line. As I have depended for my information almost solely upon the Comptes Rend us and the Proe1·et1· ings of the Royal Society, (which give the observations of Lockyer, Jaussen, Ra,ret, and Secd1i,) it is· quite possible that some other lines ought to be marked in the same manner. The third column, headed K, girns the position of the lines on Kirchoff's sc::tle; the mrn1b~rs above G being derived from Thaleu's continuation of Kirchoff's maps. In this column, au asterisk (·)denotes that the map shows no corresponding dark line; a f that the exact position, not the existence, of the line, is for some reason slightly uncertain.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The fourth column, beaded A, gives the wave-length of the line in ten-millionths of a millimeter, according to Angstrom's atlas. The numbers in this and the preceding column were taken, not from the map11 themselves, which present slight inaccuracies on account of the shrinking and swelling of the paper duriug the operation of printing, but from the numerical catalogues of Kirchoff and Angstrom, which accompany their respective atlases. In the preliminary catalogue, the numbers were derived from the nrnps; he11ce, some slight discrepancies in the tenths of {livision. The fifth column, marked F, contains a rough estimate of tlie iwrcentage of frequency with which the lines were seen clnring the six weeks of observation; and the sixth column, B, a similar estimate of their maximum brightness compared witb that of the hydrogen-line, C. ' The variations of brilliance, howeYer, when the chromosphere was much disturbed, were so considerable and so sudden that no >ery great weight can be assigned to the numbers giYen ; nor is it to be inferred that lines which have in the table the same im1ex of brightness were always erjtrnlly bright. On certain occasions, one set of lines would be particularly conspicuous; on others, another. ·with two or three exceptions, indicated in tbe notes, no lines have been catalogued which were not seen on at least two different days. In the few cases where lines observed only on one occa8ion have been admitted to the list, the observations were at the time carefully verified by my assistant, Professor Emerson, so as to place their correctness beyond a doubt. J\Ian~y other lines were '' glimp8ed" at oue time aml another, but uot 8eeu 8teadily enough or long enough to admit of satisfactory <hltermination. The last column of the catalogue contains the symbols of the chem ical elements corresponding to the respective lines. The materials at my disposal are the maps of Kirchoff and Angstrom, Tbalen's map of the portion of the solar spectrum above G, and atts" Index of Spectra." Since tl1e positions of the line8 in the latter work are given only to the nearest unit of "Angstriim's scale," I ham marked the coincidence indicated, by it with a (w), considering them less certain than t11ose shown by tile maps. In addition to the elements before demonstrated to exii;t in the chromosphere, the following i;eem to be prett;y positively indicated: sulphur, cerium, and strontium; and the following with a somewhat less degree of probability: zinc, erbium and yttrium, lanthanum and didymium. There are some coincidences also with the spectra of oxygen, nitrogen, and bromine, but not enough, con8iderillg the total number of lines in the spectra of these elements, or of a character to warrant any conclusion. One points to the presence of iridium or ruthenium, and tllere are only three lines known in the whole spectrum of these metals. No one, of course, can fail to be struck with the number of eases in which lines have associated with them the syru bols of two or more elements. The coincidences are too many and too close to bC' all the result of accident, as, for instance, in the case of iron and calcium, or iron and titanium. Two explanations suggest tliemselves. The first, which seems the most probable, is that the metals operated upon by the observer who mapped their spectra were not absolutely pure; either the iron contained traces of' calcium and titanium, or vice versa. If this supposition is excluded, then we 8eeru to be driven to the conclusion that there is some such similarity between the molecules of the different meta.ls as renders them susceptible of certain synchronous periods of vibratious-a resemblance, as regards the manner in which the molecules are built up out of the constituent atoms, suffieient to establish between them an important physical (and probably chemical) cousinsbip, so to speak. I have annexed to the catalogue a table, showing the number of lines of each substance, or combination of substances, observed in. the chromosphere-spectrum, omitting, howeT"er, oxygen, nitrogen, and bromine, since, with one exception, (line 230,) neither of tl1em ever stands alone, or accounts for any lines not otherwise explained.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
SPECTRA OF SUN-SPOTS.

These were observed on se>eral occasions Ycry carefully, but not so frequently as would liave been the case if the time at my disposal bad beeu greater. I felt that, as the observations ou the chromosphere were especially favored by the atmospheric conditions, they should have the precedence, an<l I accordingly paid particular attention to the spots only at times, when there appeared to be nothing pecnliar going on at the sun's limb, a state of things which occurred bnt seldom. I annex a catalogue of the liuesbetween Bandb, which were found to be especially affected; ab,ove bit was found difficult to ohserve the lines separately. Between the limits mentioned, the spectrum of the nucleus appeared simply a;i a dark baud running lengthwise through the field, and crossed by the same dark JineR as the spectrum of the surrounding photosphere. Most of these dark lines were entirely unaffecte11. Many, liowe>er, were more or less widened and ueepened, while a few were tlt'inntJ<l and rendered less conspicuous, and a very few were sometimes reversed. This was frequently noticed as to the hydrogen-lines, aud very rarely as to the follow.ing: G.'i4 K, D 1, D 2, D3, 1474 K, b,, b2 , b,, b4 , and 2002 K. Most of the lines in reversing become simply thinner aml fainter and then finally bright. But the sodium and magnesium lines behave quite differently; the;y become wider and blacker, and finally, so to speak, split open tlown the middle, showing a bright streak in the center of the shade. In this way the two H's were always seen reversed, (hy a bright stripe down the center of the hroad hazy shade,) not only in the nucleus and penumbra of the spot itself, but over a large area surrounding it. On widening the slit, the whole region could in some cases be seen through II to be covered with clond-forrnR much like masses of heaped-up cumulus. The definition, however, was never good like that of the iirominences seen through the C-line and open slit, the reason, of course, being simply that the bright His not like C, a sharp line ju the spectrum, but a band hazy at the edges, and of considerable width, perhaps one-sixth the width of the dark shade. This reversal of the H's over a spot wa:-1 usually brighter and more easily seen than their reversal in the cliromm,pl1ere, thongh, of conr11e, by no means visible without careful adjustments and the use of all precautions as t.o extraneous light. There can be no doubt of the fact, howe,·er, as it was seen Ly me in nearly t\Tenty different spots, and verified by ]>rofessor Emerson in many of them-in all that he had tile opportunity to examine. I have said that many of the dark lines were much widened; but those most aflected in this F'IG _2. way were not generally among the more prominent ! ones of the ordinary spectrum. In many cases, 7!6 7 7 I , '1 11 1, strong dark lines showed themselves which had no corresponding line at all in the photospherespectrnm. Occasional bright lines (or, at least, interruption.s in the dark-nucleus spectrum) were also found; also in one or two places such a peculiarity as I have attempted to exhibit in the an11exed figure, at 761 and 764. (The scale is Kirchoff's, and bright lines are shown at 755 and 797.) 1t !s pos~ible that these peculiar shadings, so closely resembling some of the appearances in one of I lucker s first-order spectra, may be the Persiennes on which at one time 80 much t · d" t· h ' s ress was 1a1'd as m 1c~ mg t ~ presen~c of the Yapor of water. The figure also shows very well the appearance of the Imes ~hich are widened and strengthened in the spot-spectrum. The observation of the spot-spectrum was rendered difficult by the almost tot I b t SI.! f th . r h. h 1 bo a a senoo a e~man o e air- mes w ic usua Iy a und between C and D; their disappearance made this port10n of the spectrum almost unrecognizable. The fact is easily ac~oanted ~or by tbe dryness of the air, which, in fine weather, was extreme. On tbe 18th of July, while observmg, I several times obt8ined slight sparks on touching the metal of

the instrument; blankets of a dark color had been laid upon tlte fioor to diminish tile reflected glare of the sunlight, and the motion of my boots upon them generated the electricity which produced the spark. Such phenomena are common enough in our steam and furnace heated houses in the winter, but I do not remember ever to have heard of a similar occurrence under natural conditions. In the catalogue, the first column, headed K, giw.s the position of the line according to Kirchoff's scale. A c denotes that the same line occurs in the chromosphere-spectrum ; a · that t!Jere is no corresponding dark line in tile ordinary solar spectrum. The second column, headed A, gives the position of the line on Angstrom's ~calc. The third colunrn, headed E, gives the symbol of the corresponding chemical element when known. The last column indicates the amount of wi<lcning or re-enforcement of the line according to an arbitrary scale from 1to10. These numbers, however, are not greatly to be relied on. The same line appears quite differently in different spots, or even in the same spot at different times, and the numbers gh.~en are only the mean of three or four ob1;1er\'ations, as a general rule. In the list, iron is represented by 52 lines; calcium, by 19, including the H's; titanium, by l.:i ; sodium and manganese, by (i each; maguesitm1, by 4; antl chromium, barinm, and nickel, hy 3 each; lithium and strontium, 2 each; while h;ydrogen1 cobalt, ruthenium, and cadmium each present but a single representative within the limitfi of the catalogue. The number of stars(*) is 2G. In this estimate, a line which is marked with the symbol of more tlrnu one element is credited to eacl1.

'l'he altitudes were measumd by observing the time required hy the prorniueuce to pass across the slit when the clock-work or the equatorial was stopped; concctions beiug applied, oi' course, for the snn's declination, and the inclination of the prominence to the parallel of declination passing through its base. The observation was rather difficult, owing to a breeze that often jarred the instrument, and Urn times at which tlie measurements were made were only recorded to the nearest half-minute; so that the results as to the altitude of the prominence at different times, and still wore the numbers re1ll'es1~ntiug the velocit,y with wbich the summit rose and fell, can be cousidered ouly as approximate. Bnt the incgnlarit_y noticealJle in tlrn column of velocitiei,; corresponds to a fact of which I feel certain, that the emption was paroxysmal, anrl the rate at which the summit moYcd was 11either uniform nor uniformly Yaried.

'l'be top of the prominence was carried violently toward the south, (from the equator,) as shown in l·'igure 4, which represents its appearance at 211 45m, Ou the renewal of the eruption at 3h 45m, the prominence assumed a brush-shaped form, which is rather unusual, and the upper current seemed to be nearly as strong in the opposite direction, (see .Figure 5.) Jilly 2~.-Uousiderable disturbance was manifested at the base of a pair of prominences, whose position-angle was 10° eouth of east; altitude, ninety thousand miles. At lQh 45m, the 0-line showed displacement toward us, amounting to 18 micrometer-divisions, and indicating a velocity of about one hundred and ninety-eight miles. At lOh 53m, as seen through the F-line, the northern edge of the brighter prominence a, in Figure 6, had a motion toward us ~---..- of about one hundred and twenty-seven miles per second; while the southern edge, b, in the same figure, was moving from us with a velocity FIC.6 h a of about eighty-seven miles. At llh 1om, the velocity of the SQuthern edge bad considerably increased, while that of the northern had fallen oft' nearly one-half.

Tbe prominence was clearly a tremendom; cyclone, and its spirnlity was 8l10w11 in tl11· distribution of its filaments, as represented in tlie figure.

For stweral days it maintained roughl,\the same place and general aspect, and was found to be tlie pn'cnrsor of the re-:1ppt>ararwe of tlw great spot, which, having disappeared 011 .Jnly :!1, again came into ,·iew 011 the 4th of Angn,.;t. In this plume, the sodimn ancl magncsinm line,; were r<ffer,.;etl entirely to the s11111mit.. The same \Vas true of the line 2.181 K, (I,oreuzo11i's /,) arnl aho of 1870, although this, in tht:> chromosphere, is far less brilliant than some of its neighbors. The li11e G5! K also at timcR Rliowecl itselt' at a.great altitude. At 9h or;m, the displacement of F was to 2086.5 K, indicating a Yelocity of ahout mo miles, which a minute later bad increased to 218. At !)h Oim, I turned to the U-liuc and found a diRplacement of .3.6 diYisions of Kirchoff, corresponding to a yelocit,\· of 20,'l mil('s, a n·ry Rat1sf'actory accordance. 4 At !Jh 13rn, the displacement of F was to 208i, corres1Jonding to 204 miles. At !)h 15n1, a small displacement in the opposite direction showed itself, bnt eame t(} nothing:; anti, by !)h 20111, everything was quiet. After the eruption, the seeing was very poor for a wllile, and I took up "·ork on tlH· ,;'pectrum of a spot. Returning t(} the chromosphere about llh 30m, I found things again in motion. The line (i54 K was re'\ersed finely to tile very top of the plume. Uonsiderable ,·eloci ty was iud icatet1, ~md it was especially notetlthat the line 18'i0 K was distinctly, and m·en larj.!ely affected, while 186i, though much brighter, was not. No <listnrhance was manifest in 53! K, i11 H74, iu .t~ ('.!::i8l .~,) or in either of the ll's, tb(}ugh h showed it well. At this time, the rernrsal of tbe sodium-lines at the summit of the prominence was distinctly more brilliant than at tl1e base, and the Rame was true of the magnesium-lines. It is a circumstance which is not often met witl!. August 3.-As the spot approached nearer t6 the limb, the 1mrroundiug prominences wen·, 1lf course, bet,ter seen, and ou this day the disturbance was illcessant, a11d S(}metimes very Yi(}leut. At 1111 35m, I find in my notes that F exhibited displacement upward as far a8 2086, (l'i::i milt·s per second,) that in K 2003 the disturbance extends quite as far; so also in 1870; 18ti7 Sl'Ctus to oe somewhat affected; 200L5, and the barium-lines HJS!J and 2031 show nothing. The magnesim11lines am distorted; 1474, mo;;, and li:il5 are not; E slightly; the sodium-lines Yery mueh dis·Perhaps this is the proper place to recant an opinion expressed in 1870, that the clisplacenwntR and dist11rb,u1ces of spectral lines might be due to causes otbe.r titan the rnotious of the luminous matter. The opiuion was ktBed 1111011 a failure to detect in the spectrum of a prominence where the F-Jine wits greatly distnrlied, even "shattered tu piece~,'' any corresponding effect upon the C-line. I did not then comp1·ehencl the ra.pidity with which these pl1enomeua alter, ttnd presume the explanation of the ol>scrvation was simply that the Jistnrbance had come to an end while I ""'~ chaug· ing the adjustment of my instrument from l!' to C; a proce1<s which, with the instrument I then usetl, woultl tako two or three minutes. Jn order, however, to test the matter more carefully, I have devised, and hope sonic d,.y to execut.1·, an arra.ngement of two spectroscopes by which the disturbances of two lines may be sirnult:u1eonsly observc1l m11'.l directly compared in the spe<ltr11m of an;i point ou the snn's limh.

tnrbcd, and n,, of course. C is ver,y much broken up and very brilliant; and both 654 K and 534 K are distinctly affected. At 1111 40U:, the upward displacement had ceased, and was replaced, at a point '\"Cl'Y near, b;y a downm1rd displacement, wllich brought a 11ortion of the F-line down to K 2077.5, (96 miles per seeoml.J This ceased at 11i. 48m. At 111i 51"1, a new and even more violent distur·bance began. This time two points, about 2' ripart, were simuhaneousl;y affected, and the ejected gas at both points was un<lPr 150 great a pressure or at so high a temperature as to give a continuous spectrum; i. the spectrum wm; marked by two bright streaks running the whole length of the field, and '1bere th{'se streaks crosst·rl certain of the l·'raunhofer lines they were turned bright and distorted, while others were not in the least affected. The displacement at the northern point indicated a Yelocity of :.mo miles iwr secornl, the matter receding from us, while at the southern of the two points the motion was toward us '>"»ith eve11 a slightly greater swiftness. By 12h orn, 110011, it was all over. The afternoon was ciondy, .ilug1rnt 5.-B_y this time, the spot had come around the liwb of the sun, and was distiucUy ach-aucell upou the tlisk. Between (jh 3ow and 711 2om a. m. of this day, there was a very unusual amount of tlistnrhance in :rnd around tlle spot, exceeding anything of the sort I ever before witllcl.'lscd. l fintl the following notes: "(ih 30"' a. m., C is plainly reversed in i::pectrum of nncle us, hnt much more hriglltly in certain poiuts about 1~' south of it; also in one point about 1 1 north. "At these 1Joiuts, (undoubtedly the orifices through which prominence~mattcr was ejecting,) 654 K is also distinctly reversed upon the body of the sun; 534 K is not. "The sodium-lines reverse faintly iu points, but generally are only much thickened. D" reYersf'S distinctly but faintly, and, where not reversed, is visible asa dark shade rather than as a fine black line. "b 1 and b, arc plainly reyersed and so mew hat distorted; b4 is reYersed, but more faintly; bnt b~,-arnl this is very singular--is more brightly reversed than either of the others, and more distorted. The points which rpyerse these lines give also a bright continuous spectrum, and the 1474-line is faintly reversed when crossed hy the bright streaks. The line 2001.6 is reversed in the penumbra, 11ot in the nucleus, faintly, but unmistakably; its neighbors are not. 6It imm a. m., Fis magnificently reversed aud shattered; portions are di:splaced to 2088.3, and, on the olher side, to 2071.5, indicating velocities of nearl,v 240 miles per iwcond in both directions. By opening the slit of the spectroscope slightly, a prominence can be traced on the sun's surface from its origin on the southern margin of the penumbra to the limb; there it projects from the chromosphere. f (2581.2) shows 110 effect at all; 2796 (II;-) is affected like F, but less brilliantly; h was like ~796, but still fainter." H1 was distinctly reversed across the whole width of tbe spectrum 6'. In the penumbra, it was also mu ch distortell; the effect being certainly more marked than in It. H 2 also sympathized, but was difficult of observation. On turning back to C at this tinw, I found its reversal far more brilliant than I have ever seen on auy otlter oeca8ion. For a length of nearly 2', it was turned into a bright and jagged streak of light, and from one side (the more refrangible) projected a fiame, in form closely resembling a caudle urged by a blow-pipe, but so bright that even on the scarlet background of the spectrum it blazed like a calcium-light; the line 654 I{, plainly in sight iu the same field, faintl~- imitated the c. liue, showing corresponding irregularities of form and thickness, and especiaUy the :flame. B;r 7h JOm, the disturbance was entil'elyover, nor did I see any repetition of it that day, although I continued ol>scrYing till noon. On Augm;t 3, the photographer of the party had beeu occupied during the morning with magnetic observation~, under the direction of Assistant Mosman. About 11 o'clock, be began observing deflections for the pnrpose of determining the horizontal intensity. From the first, he found his observations unusual1y discordant. From llh 30m to Uh 45m, the results were very bad; and, at 1111 54m, he was forced to give up work, the magnet swinging entirely beyond the range of the scale, in ~mch a direction as to indicate a diminution of the earth's magnetic power. · Ou the 5th, the magnetic work did not begin until after 8 o'clock, and, when it did, nothing unusual was noticed. The coincidence on the 3d seemed to me sufficiently striking to deserve investigation; and I accordingly wrote to Greenwicb and to Stonyburst College (England) for copies of their automatic-

If it be true that we have thus got an interval of a few hours for transmission of magnetfo influence a. g1·eat JJUiut is gained. * * * " * "' "lam, dear sir, yours, very truly, " G. B. AIRY."
I annex tlle tracings of the curves of vertical force and declination ; anrl, for the purpose .of comparison, I have urawn in upon the latter the declination~cnn·c from the Stonyhnrst sheet, reduced to the :;;ame scale. It will be seen that at both 11laces there are considerable jumps not found at the other, arisiug, of course, from local cam1es. I have marked some of the mo~t important of them with a letter l, to call attention to them. I am unable to agree with Professor Airy in the idea that several hours are occupied in transmitting magnetic distnrbance from the sun, on account of the indications of the curves for August 5, when the only disturbance appears to be strictly simultaneous with the outburst noted on the sun. So, also, on the 3d, all the curyes show at Uh 50m (Sherman time) a sudden mornment, (clea1'est npon the yertical-force curve.) lVIy conviction is strengthenml by finding, in my note-book, the following remark8: 8h 45 111 a. m: "All the lines in this part of the spectrum reversed at; moments," showing that at that time, and for a few minutes, there was great activity at tlie hase of the prominence I was then examining, whicl1 was the same in which the 1111 iiOm disturbance was afterwarrl noted . .Again, at 101t 30'", "A little bunch gives a continuous spectrum much of the time," and these are the only records of extraordinary activity during the whole rooming. Now, 011 looking at the vertical-force curw., we find precisely at those moments, and at no other time during the morning, sudden and violent disturbances. The same are recognizable on the declination-curves, though less conspicuous. I am therefore disposed to conclude that ci,cry riolent eruptive dfat1t1·bancc on the surface of the sun propagates a magnetic disturbance to tlte earth ir:ith a 't:elocity sensibly the same as that of light, or, a.t least, with a velocity of the same order as that of light; for uur time-observations are not sufficiently precise to enal)le us to measure the rates of the velocities with any accuracy. ·we can only assert that no sensible difference in the time of propagation is ·wide11t. It seems also clear that even a violent distmbance on the sun produces directly only a comparatively small effect on the earth's magnetic elements; and it is ver,y doubtful, therefore, whether intense magnetic storms can be ascribed to direct solar influence. Ou the other ha ml, it is not at all unlikely that eYen a small magnetic impulse, acting simultaneously and alike over the whole surface of the earth, may so dist\trb an unstable magnetic equilibrium as to give rise to convective actions, anrl thus, in the course of a few hours, indfrectly produce a magnetic storm of an intensity onl.r remot!~ly proportional to its exciting cause. The subject, howe\'er, evidently needs further an<l careful investigation.

My experie11ce hail extended through ele\ations from lligh-water mark to 3,-ifl teet ahove the sea.
DEAR
DE8CRl1'1'IOK OF THE COUNTRY An.TAf'ICNT TO
RFIDITT.

Preceding the occupation of Summit, I had for a month hPPn making tran,.;it, azi111ntl1, arnl latitude observations at Yerdi, in connection with the determination of the ouc hundred and twentieth meridian. Verdi ii'. ;1bont twenty-fi>e miles east of the Summit, at au eleYntion of J,.-;;o feet above the sea. It is on the right bank of the Tmckee Hi>er, in a contr:icted basiu-slrnpf'll widening of tlie Truckee Carron, and surrounded by mountains about 2,000 fet"t abon' t11e riH'I'. There the weather was extremely dry and hot, reaching 1::!7'.l Fahrenheit dnring part of the time iu which I measured the base for the triaugnlation; the nig·hts were generall.r cool. Stunmit, at the head of Donner I,ake, is in a gap of the Sierra Xen1dn, arnl alHmt '.?,000 frl't. below the general elevation of the chain northward and Houthward. The summt'l'-wimls draw through it from the westward sometimes very strongl,r. A few days Lefore I occupietl the ,.;tation, the smoke from the great forest-fires of Oregon, 'Vasllingtou, and British Oolu1u 1.Jia had drawn down the great valley of the Sacramento, filled it nearly to the tops of the mountains, arnl complete].\· obscured the Coast Hauge of Mountains that are visible during the greater part of the year.· At this time of the year, I labored undH that disadvantage, and this other, that tlw heated air of the Yalley was partially drawn through Summit Pass. I could have occupied au elevation of about 9,000 feet within three miles of the station ancl arnided these difficult.ies, but at more ex:penditure of time than could then be given. The Sierra Nevada in this regiou is a narrow backbone orridg·e, rising at least 3,000 feet withi11 twenty or tweuty-five miles on each side; it is mostly grass-covered, and, in many place:;-, has pincforests along its flanks, and close under the crest. I examined the ridges for sm-eral miies to the north and south of Snmmit, an cl was well satisfied that localities of 9,000 foet elPYa ti on 1wn· available to railroad and telegraphic communication; but the question of the best location 011 t1H· Sierra Nevada can be readily settled by examination of the prominent mountains farther north aud south, within reas<mable reach of communication. Peaks of 10,000 feet and ornr lie just sont11 alHl west of J,ake Tahoe, near the Placerville road; and of 9 7000 feet and over to the nortlnnml or Summit Pass. ·
THE CLIMATE AND TilE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBSERVING.

My own experience is limited to the month of July ancl part of August, 1872. At Yerdi, in July, there were about six nights cloudy; and the same llroportion behl gooll for the Su mm it. Ami, while I was at the Summit, every night was clear. In Janna~y, February, March, 18591 I was stationed on Table Mountain, north of Sau Francisco, and could see the Sierra Nevada, one hundred and fifty miles distant, as clear, sharp, and steads as objects seen ordinarily fifty miles distant. I then obsen-ed upon some of the peaks for direction nnd elevation.

'.l'HE OBSERYATlONS.

At Verdi, nnfavoral.Jly situated for steadiness of' atmosphere, and 4,870 feet above the sea, I was using for azimuth a telesr.ope of 2.0 inches aperture, 25 inches focal length, and magnifyingpowcr of about 35 or 40. I made a regular series of azimuth-observations upon B. A. C. 4165, sixth magnitude, (Argelander,) upon two nights, using good illumination arnl diagonal cross-threads. I also used a Ursm Minoris at the other elongation, and was astonished to see the companion. I was making no search for it and ha,d no catalogue to ref'er to, but noted its position, &c. It was so distinct that I think I conld have made, with difficulty howP.vcr, measures of precision upon it. With tile zenith-telescope No. 1, I observed stars for latitude, and could make good observations upon stars of the eighth magnitude. At ordinarily low stations of 200 to 500 feet elevation, the same telescope is good for stars of the sixth-and-a-half magnitude. At Summit station, my observations were made for one week in the open air, with a. telescope of three (3.0) inches aperture, 4i.Ji inchea focal length; direct eye·1)iece, with magnifying-power of about GO or 65 ; an inverting eye-piece, not a good one, and power of about 250. Tbe telescope was poorly mounted upon a tripod-stand. My principal observations were made upon the companion of Polaris, the moon, Saturn, some double stars, and the sun, and full fiekl-notes were roughly entered at the time. The examinations were always completed before ten o'clock at night. l'ola.ris.-Every night the companion was distinctly visible with the direct eye-piece, not ouly to myself but to my aids, who have had very little experience, and even to the employe of the Jlarty. It was so distinct at times that there would have been no difficulty whatever in making

obsernttious of precision upon it. 1:'."pon two or thr<'e nights I found it as soon after l"Ullsrt as J could find l'olaris; the twilight being quite bright. I noticed no jumping of the pole-star whatm~er, as is generally the case at low eleyation:-;.

Tlte moon was more familiar than the other ohject11, for I 11ad made a contimtons series of four or five years' obsen·ations upon it for longitude, by transits aud oecultations, from heach stittions up to 3-!71 feet elevation. l\ly present obsen·ations upon it re\·euled a distinctness, sharpness, and steadiness for which I was wholly unprepared. \Yhen there was the sliglitest unsteadiness in the earl.}' m·ening, the impression upon my mind was that a Yery t bin trenrnlons medium was hetween the moon aud the ohsen·er, aml uot at; if a 1]ense medium was immediately e11ycloping the moon, which is the impression coll\·eyed at moderate eleYatious. \Vl1c11 the moon was young (less than three da_ys old) aud very low, l traced the cusps to cstreuie 1111e liucs of lig·ht with a wonderful distinctness; and followed t!Je ash-gray limb YCr.Y ,.;harpl~- all arouml ; m;iug direct eye-piece and power of 60. This sharpness of the cm;ps was rnarkctl on suhsf'quent en'ning,,; e\·en before dark, and the piiiuts of the cnsps traced to finer lines thau the tluest spider-threads in om· instruments. They were traced even 3 a11d J degrees farther than what I could ordinarily expect to se. The mountains were ver;r sharply defined, and tlic outstanding bright points on tlw dark limb minute, sharp, and Yery steady. There was not the least llaziness or n11steadiues" to tile fine lines of the cusps, and no hlnrring whatPYer with a power of 250. Tile outline of the llright limb was so sharp and clear and steady that e,·er.r night I noted the irn·gnlarities tbroughont its border, ancl, with proper means and more time, could lrnYe umde measures and tlrawiugs ·of tbem all. I had never seen them before. In one place, I noted a large elcYation pr~jectiHg so far Ul\Yon1l the general curve of the limb that it would hM·e occasioned an error of one or one a!Hl a half secomls in the time of emcrsion of a star at that place. And all aronrnl the limh were irreg-nlariti!'s from the general outline that would ,-ery sensibly affect the time of emersion of a star. On the dark limb of the moon, I was able to trace the lights and shadows with g-r1·at distinctness; minute points of light and shadow were visible. I traced the outline of the dark limb when the moon was nine or ten days old. On the 9th of August, I obsenell the occultatiou of a star of tiie eighth-aniJ-a.lrnlf or niuth magnitucle behind the dark limb, keeping the bright part of the limb ont of the field of Yie·w, a11tl wa,; eertain of noting the time of its disappearance to the tenth of a second. Prom my previous experience in observing transits of the moon, ocenltation:-;, and edipses, l h:we no hesitation in saying that direct measures upon the moon for diameter, &c., made m1dcr similar circumstances to tbe above, would, in one or two nights, be of greater value than the results of sis: months' observations at small elevations. For occultations, the observations would have special value, as the topographical character of the moon's limb at the points of immersion and emersion would be known; for observing tmnsits of the moon's bright limb by using the double transit-threads, the sharpness and steadiness of the limb would give results fully equal to startransits; and I am not sure but that the transit of the ash-gray limb could be obserYed under farnrable circumstances in the Jong nights of winter. The phenomenon of a star's appearing upon the body of the bright limb before disappearing in an immersion (as I have twice obsen'ed in tlle case of a Scorpii) could be well studied, probably for both limbs, and also at emersiou. · Phot<>grapbic pictures of the moon could be taken with remarkable effects. The sim.-Upon three days, wheu not on reconnaissance-duty, I obserrnd upon the body of

The limb of the sun was as sharply defined arn:l as steady as that of the moon at night; auy slight unsteadiness Ol!casionally experienced gave tl1c impression of a very thin medium moving between the observer and the snn; or that the telescope was yery gently vihrated by a light wind. There was 110 coufuse<l border to the snn a!\ if a boiling material euveloped it. The lines of the facula· were distinctly visi!Jh.\ on the body of the sm1, and se>eral peculiar patches noted particularly i11 order to trace changes in their positiou, shape, or brightness. Sorne of the lines w_ere n~r.r tine, interlaced, and strekhing from spots near the border to the border with such distin'cr,. 11es,.; tbat it seemed as if I onght to see them projected beyond it. ·with a larger telescope and higher power, I Laye no dou!Jt these lines could be seen changing; in one and a half hours I noted cbaug-es in a group of bright spots and lines fa,,·orably disposed aml of <liffereut degrees of brightucss, for satisfactory ollsenatio11. Around all the spots near the sun's border I noted these faculm; aronnd the great spot existiug August D, well toward the middle of the snn, I saw indistinct lines arnl masses of facnlm, and over the body of the sun could detect a mottled appearance, the more ei:;pecially when I intentionally jarred the telescope slightly. Ou the second day I noted clrnng·es in the great central spot; distinctly saw the striations owr the penumbra toward tl.ie centrnl black spot, aml the inflowing of the white stream across the 11enum bra and !Jlat:k spot; also saw the white stream stretching into the spot near the lower border of the sn11. Around the penum!Jra of the great spot there was a mottle<l appearance that seemed as if an intermediate iw11nmhra existed !Jetween the penumbra proper and the brighter hmly of the strn lw~·oml. This sccondal',\· p(\nnmbra (?) embraced all the small and scattered spots in the Yicinity of the great, spot. The spots, penumbra, striations iu tbe penumbra, and tlie fa<inl:c are so marked that all might po::;sibly be exhibited in a photograph. On the lust morning of my o!Jscrvations there was a hea''Y dew, and at fih 2om a. w. I found the atmosphNe too nnstead~' for good obs~rvations; but, at 9 11 a. m. the seeing was aH good as on pr·eyious days, arnl I vcrifictl all my previous observations. Upon each day I was impressed with the remarkable sharpness of outline an<l steadiness of border of the sun, aml what a capital object it was for measures of precision. Tim spots, penumbra, striatious through penumbra, inflowing white streams, faculm near border, were remarkably well defined arnl good objects for study and obsen·ation; but the secondary penumbra('!) and the mottled appemance oYer the middle part of the sun's body were not well made out. Fro111 my examinations 1 am satisfied that one or two days' observations for the <liametElr of tbe imn, matle under similar circumstances, would be better than six months' results at low altitudes. '\nth our instrnments, 1 felt convinced that I could observe with the Rame precision upon the 81111 aR npon the moon, hoth for diameter and for right ascension and declination; aml that the olJserYations would have a value equal to our best observations upon stars for latitude.

NOTEH ON THE NORTH PACIFIC CUimE~TS, :MADE OK TIIE YOYAGE FIW:\l SA~ FRANUISCO TO UN'ALA8HKA, SEPTE:\IBER, 1871.
On leaving tile California coaRt, in latitude 380 uO', and longitude 12;:;0 38', 011 tlie 1st of Se1-' tember, 1871, our records show light southerlJ· aml easterly currents of a third of a knot an lwur, with a temperature of 60° and 61°. At 4h, nantical time, September 3, the temperature, whicll had fallen to 58°, abruptly rose to G2°, and the observations showed a change toward tlie west in tile direction of tbe current. The temperature increased to 63:>, at 201·, on the 3d, and continued so for about twenty-four hours, when it fell to 6:JO again, and the obserYations indicated a slight iiortherly and westerly dl'ift. Ou the 4th, at 24\ tlie temperature rose again, reachiiig GJ 0 , and ayeraging· 63° ..'i for the next twenty-four houri-1, with a slight tlrift to tlie south and west of a bout 0.2 of a knot an hour. Tbe tem1)erature culminated on the Gth, at Sh, in (37'.', after which it feli rapi,lly to (),p, which continued for the remainder of' the clay; the ol>scrnitions sho\\"ing a strong uortllerl,\ and westerly current, about forty-fi\e or fifty miles broad, running at the rate of a knot and an eig[1tll an hour. Another sudden rise of temperature took place between 0 11 and 4h, on the 7th, reaciling 69::;, and arnragiug m;o, with a slight fall of lO at night, the water being warwer tilan the air. This chang-ewas coincident with a current diametrically opposed to the pre\ious one, running to the south aud east nt the rate of more than half a knot an hour. This gradually diminisl1ed in nlocity, thougli the a\·erage temperature of 67°.5 1'\"as maintained for uearl,\' forty-eight hours longer. Ou tlie 9th, the temperatme fell simultaneously with a succession of Routlleast gafes, which obliged us to lay to for two days, and preYented astronomical obsenations from lwi11g made. Ou the 13th, the temperature had fallen to 52:', which was steadily maiutaiued until Oh of tile J.lth. Here, in latitude 430 40' and longitmle 1J2'.l 35', apprnximate, a sudden and very remarkabk change of temperature was e.o..perienced, being au abrupt rise from 52"' to (i:i 0 · The temperature of the air, though lower than that of the water, changed iu a similar manner. \\ e sailed ornr this hot :stream for twelve hours, when the temperature fell, as abruptl,r as it bad risen, to 510. The width of the stream was about forty miles in an east and west direction. The impo8Ri1Jility of gettillg· any astronomical observations unfortunately prevented the determination of its rate and direction. From this time until the 18th, the temperature maintained an arnrage of 4lP.:i. A curreut running from half a knot to a knot an hour was perceptible, which prowd to run, on the 15th, in a southwesterly direction; on tbe IGtb, nearly to the east; and on the lith, to the south and ea.~t. Ou. the 18th, we could obtain no obserV"ations. On the 19th, we struck the south arm of the Alaska stream, with a temperature of 490, aml a northerly and west.orly velocity of uearly a knot au houl'. On the 20th, we passed through an eddy, which will be hereaft.er referred to, having a sontJ1ea~te1 ly direction, and about half the velocity of the last mentioned. On the 21st, we entered the north arm of the'A\aska curreut, about \atitndeG3°; the temperature rose to 500, which.was maintahled while we were in the body of the stream. The rate (witll stroug adverse wind and the vessel making a great deal of leeway) was ornr a third of a knot an hour at first, gradually increasing to a knot and a third on the 2~d. The temperature fell two degrees ~48°) as we neared the shores, and two more (460) when. the mouth of the Aknta.u Pass wa1:< reacl.t:d, where the cold water of Bering Sea was following the falling tide in.to tlle Pacific.

ON CAPTAIN'S BAY ANH VICINITY.

The peculiar pinnacle off Cape Kalekhta, which marks the entrance into Uaptain's Bay, is locally known as the Priest Rock, wl1ile the inner pinnacle at tlie south beau of Letum, or Summel' Bay, is sometimes called the Second Priest. The entire eastern shore of the llay, from Cape Kalekhta nearlJ' to llinliuk Village, is more or less studded with suuken rocks, and >essels shonltl give it a fair bertll. Tlle first bay south of Cape Kalekhta, on. the east shore of the Eastem Road, is known as Con· stantiae Ba_y. A vessel called the Constantine, belonging to the Russian-American Company, attempted to enter it and was wrecked. A reef extends clear across the entrance, allll the whole bay ii'I shoal an;l f'nll of rocks. J m;t off the entrance we obtained 2i fathoms, smootll, rocky bottom. The next bay to the isouth, on the same shore, is known as Letum, or Summer Bay. Tlle yilfage situated upon it is known as Imagnee. This lx1y may be enteretl until the vessel is iu line with the North Head and the Second Priest pinnack. Beyond that line, the bay is full of rocks, which do not break except in heaYy weather. Sear the lake, at the south end of this bay, are hot springs. The southern end of the Bastern Hoad has improperly been marketl on the Coast Snn·ey chart RS lliuliuk Harbor. That name appliel'l onl,y to the la.ucl-\ocketl harbor northwest of the >illage, formed by Amakuak Island. Ulakbta Harbor is known to the RnsAiaus as Dutch Bay, a Dt1tch \'essel, it is said, haYing been the first to enter it. The holding-grOlrnd in the middle of this harbor is goo<l, being soft, black mud and 8hell, in 14 to 16 fathoms. Ulose to tbe end of the spit 22 fathoms may be had with shingly bottom. To the east of the spit, rocky shoals. C',overed with kelp, extend some distance into the Eastern Road. A good rule for navigators in this region is to "k-eep out of the kelp.'' There is no kelp, -without rocks, (though there may be plenty of water,) And there fire few rocks in less than 8 fathoms which are not ma1'ked by kelp. Tile shore lwtween the entrance bf this harbor and the village is very rocky, and sltonltl he a>oided. The small island in Iliuliuk Harbor is named Bx:pedition Island. Sarycbeff moored his exploring-vessel be bind it during oue winter. The laud to the west and southwest of this harbor, on Amaknak, is rocky and mountainous, not low and marshy, as repregentetl on the charts. The soutber·n entrance to llinlink Harbor has a very mtrrow and tort.nomi channel, aml may be considered nntit for navigation. The bay to the sontl1 of the south end of Amaknak is the harbor properly known as Captain's Harbor, or Port Levasheft It is not used by vessels at present. A rock ofl' Obernoi Point exists, which is not down on the later charts. Its position was rediscovered anrl fixecl hy our party ; though we afterward found it laitl down on Sarycheff's chart of 1792. The passage between Hog faland and Amaknak is full of reefs, though a channel probably exists. It should be avoided by vessels until more is known. Extensive shoals extend off the south end and the southweRt shores of Hog Island. The bay south-southwest of Hog Island hi known as Nateekin Bay. 'fhe shorns are entirely hroacl sandbeaehes, and a low valley extemls several miles south from them, watered by two streams of considerable size. The Coast SnrYe_y chart erroneously represents the shores as rocky and precipitous. A good boat-harbor existf.I on the extreme western side; hut the bay rttl'ords no protection for vessels. The bay south of Igognak Point is known as Broad Bay. Behind the reef of Igoguak, a sate anchorage exists. There is no village now existitig on this point, nor is there one on Kalekhta .Bay. A small village is situated on Hog Island, near its southern eml. A bank, noted for its cod, is situated two miles west of Igognak Point: It has 50 fathoms

From this bank to Ulak!tta Head, the w..tter deepens to 7~ fathomR. We were able to find no depth O\'er 72 fathoms anywhere in the bay, and ontsi<le of Captain's Bay it rapidly shoals to 68, GO, and 50 fathoms san<ly mud. The portage betweeu Constantine and Kalekhta Bays i:s very incorrectly represented on the charts. It is entirely low, and the lakes exten<l from bea1.1h to heacb. With regar<l to the approache:s to Unalashka, it may be note11 that the tide-rips (which occur at half-tide) are not daugerouR to vessels except in severe storm:;;. They are in general to be met with at the northern entrance of t.be Unalga nml A lrntnn P:uises, mu1 ::trP e~peciall~- violent off the northwrf<t poiut of .Akutm1 Island.

It is a noteworthy fact that there is never any win<l over the tide-rips, howenr fresh it may Le blowing before they are reached and after they are passed. I can offer 110 Pxplanation oft his well-attested fact, which I hiwe myself observed on Hc\·cral occa~im1R.

NOTES ON THE JURTEOIWLOGY OF TIN.ALASHKA. Tht> taule herewith forwar<l1·1l contains the means and extremes of our mett>orologi1:al ouserrn t.ious. The prernlent. winds in wiutcr are southeast, and bring rain and fog. Nortlwast winds briug clear weather, and north and northwest, snow. The lwaYiest gales are said to come from the southwest; tl1e worst we experie.nce<l were from the southeast. The winds generall_y chn 11ge from east to sonth and we,.,t, with the snu, when the:> ch;:111ge, a fact corrohoratcu hy the testimotJJ of the inhabitants, and by Yeniaminotl' in his work on Unalashka. The high mountains and deep Yalleys, acting as funnels, change the course of tlrn wind ahont. the island before it reaches the bay, and grentl,y increase its forcp, It is rarely possihlP to jmlge correct]~- of the tlirection or force of the wind outsitle, wben in the Lay, and rice ~·ersa. From similar cause;;, we. liaYe been nnable to c01111ect the changps of the liarometer with tlwse of the winds i11 such a manner a;; to afford any guide for nn>igatorn. "·esterly \Yin<ls mmally bring high barometers, aud soutl.Jeas::erly winds the reYerse; but exceptions arc very comnwn. Irnlced, during one of the fiercest gales we encountered <luring the ;year, at Coal Harbor, the barometer stood at 30.4'.m, while a few 1lays hrfore, with a strong northeaster blowing, it stood at '..!8.(;:.a. No ice obstructs the outer road of Captain's Bay in winter as a rule. Once, after two· weeks of northers, fioatiug ice from the north did enter tl.Je bay, and remaint'1l for some time; hut thi.-; iH the only case on record. Skim-ice, very destructive to boats, will form dnring ernry calm winter-night, hut it ne,-er attains any tl1ickaess unless by the freezing of wet snow which may h11 upon it. In any case, it will be broken up by the first strong breeze. The force of the winds, even in the land-locked ha1'bor of Iliuliuk, must be foH tn he appreciated. It surpasseR Verytbiug I have ewr experienced elsewhere. The squalls are especially violent in Ulakhta. Harbor and in Iliuliak Harbor, with westerly or southeasterly winds. Shocks of earthquake and other volcanic phenomena are of almost daily occurrence, thougl1 none of great severity happenetl during our visit. In 1866, however, half the village was shaken down, and a portion of the spit. on which it is situated was rendered nniuhabital>le h.r the sinking of the surface nearly to a level with that of the sea. As a rule, the winter-nights are clear, and astronomical ouservatious could, except for the wind. be very frequently obtained. In summer, however, the renrse is the case, and hardly a clear night or day will be met with from May to Angust. The aurora borealis, -very faint, wns once or twice observed as a white glow on the northern sky. It is said to be very rare here. It, may be mentioned bere, for waut of a more appropriate ]Jlace, tbat in August we obserrnd lightning in the Shunmgins during a uortheaster, the first reported as observed in this region, Also after shortly leaving Kadiak, in September, 1872, as a squall was passing to leeward of the vessel, two miles distant, a lunar rainbow, forming a complete arch, and faintly exhibiting th~ colors of the spectrum, was observed. Parhelia and paraselenre are of rather common occurrence 111 these regions, and usually prececle a storm.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF TIDES OF IJ,IULIUK.

The tides of the Aleutian region have long been considered as likely to afford a kes to many problems connected with the general su~ject, and hence any contribution to a knowledge of them cannot fail to be of interest. The only observations on these tides which have yet been ·made, so far as I am able to disco>er, are those of the United States Coast Rurvey. A tirlal observer was engaged hy Assistant George Davidson during his visit to this region in 1867, and pro.,ecuted hif;; labors for some time with a simple box-gauge and staff. These observations closed with the dissolution of the Russian-American Company, and the removal of the observer to Unga Island from Unalashka. His records were taken charge of by Capt. Charles Bryant, special agent of the United States 'l'reasmry, and by him forwarded to the Coast Survey Office at Washington; but I have uot had access to them, and the following remarks arn solely the result of our own observations. The latter were taken with Saxton's self-registering gauge, (No. 14,) carefully regulated by chronometers to mean local time, and extend, with but one break of any consequence, over the time from October 13, 1871, to February 14, 1872. These tides belon~ to the "mixed type" emphatically, and at least a year's obsen-ations would be uecessar,y to unravel the tangled 8kein and afford materials for a prediction-table. They agree, in most particulars, with the tides which prevail over the entire northwest coast of America, though a thorough comparison woul tl probably expose some individual peculiarities. Something may be gained from our present fund of observations, and so far as they supply the materials, tables (herewith forwarded) have been prepared according to the method recommended by AsRistant Henry Mitchell in his "Tides and Tidal Phenomena.:' The re>mlt of scattered observations among the islands to the eastward of Unalashka shows tllat they are of the same type, though the range or volume of the tide increases as we go eastward, being near!~- twice as great in the Shumagins as it is in Iliuliuk. The method suggested by Mitchell, as will presently be shown, appears to need some modifications, at least in theory, before it can fairly be applied to the peculiar tides of this region. Thi" report will be confi11ed, as far as possible, to a statement of their obser>ed characteristics, leaving the reference to their proper causes, of the various effects exhibited, to those who have greater facilities for research, and more experience in the treatment of tidal phenomena. During two-thirrlR, or thereabouts, of eHch lunar mouth at Iliuliuk, two high an(l two low waters per day may 1.Je observed. For the remainder of that period, one high and oue low water occur daily. The latter are ht·re designated as compound t.ides, being evidently the result of the merging in one diurnal tide of the previous semidiurnal tides. The different kinds will be considered separately. As a whole, these tides attain their maximum range about the time of the moon's maximum declinatio11, north or south, and their minimum range about zero declination; but the highest water occurs about tlw time of the moon's quartering, apparently without much reference to the declination. The benchmark to which these observations refer (a line cut into a perpendicular rock near the gauge) was 13 feet above the zero of a graduated staff outside the crib. The plane of reference, being the meau of all the low waters observed at that station, was 4 feet on the staff, or 9 feet below the level of the bench-mark. The following general observations may be mentioned :

The order thus estal>Jisbed bas been carried through the entire profile, and tlw tides colored accordingly; that due to lower transits being blue, m11l that tlnc to upper trausi ts carmine, forming, where they overlap, a purple, of which a slightly lighter shade has been used to define more clearly the compound form of the tide.

CO:)[POFND TIDES.

These tides invariably occurred during the moon's north dediuatiou, auu at 110 oth1~r liu1t>. Their greatest height was usually reached atout one lunar day after the moon's maximum north declinatioo. Their greatest range was at the time of maximum north declination. The other tides united to form the compound tide from one to three lnnar days Ll'fore tlie uorth maximum, and it ended IJy their separation from tllree to six antl a half lunar days after the maximum; their duration varying (1·elatively with the interYal between the maximum north deeliuatiou and the time of full moon) from fise t-0 eight luuar <la.vs. The shorter the interval referreu to, the greater the duratiou of the compound tide, and rice rersa, without reference to the priority of either the phase or the declination. A greater portion of the increase in duratiou of any epucll of this tide appears in that portio11 of the epoch which follows the maximum declination, rather than i11 that which precedes it. The last-mentioned portion, as well as the range, appears larger when the phase precedes the declination than when the declination precedes the phase. The increase in height. of this tide toward the time or maximum de!.!lination, as well as a smaller iucrease appareutly due to the phase, does 11ot increase tl1e range in like proportion, as thf' line of low waters bears to the plane of reference a relation very similar to that snstaiued by the line of high waters, both rising and falling together, in a g1meral way.

The period which elapses between tlte end of one epoch of cornpouml tides autl the beginning of another a\'erages twenty lunar da;ys, being longest when its full moon approximates most nearly to <L zero declination, anu rice t·ersa. During the time coverell by our observations, the duration of this period varied from nineteen to twenty-one lunar da.ys. "\"\~bile it lasts, two tidet; t>ccur daily, due to a combination of forces, which the material in hand is insufficient to exhibit fully. Mitchell, in his paper already referred to, states that, in mixed tides, similar elemeut8 follow upper transits in north declination a.ml lower in south declination, anrl upper tram;its in south aud lower fo north dt>clination. (Loe. cit., .P· 17.) This generalization "·ill not always apply to the tides of' this region, (as!'uming the semi-diurnal waYes of the same day to be of equal age,) as the change in the nature of the tidal elements of one of the waves at least does not invariably occur until a greater or lesser period has elapsed after the moon's dbange in 'declinatiou. This period varieR from two to ten lunar days; the nol'th declination of the moon actually lasting longer than the south declination, and also exerting an influence upon the tide for a longer time after she bas passeu sonth of the equator than is the case uu<ler the opposite circumstances. Therefore, it bas seemed preferable, in this preliminary work, (hereafter to be revised by abler and more experienced hands,) to lllat the tides as they actually occurred, rather than to attempt to shape the observations to fit a hypothesis seemingly at variance with the facts.

REPORT OF THE SUPERI:NTENDENT OF

Treated in this way, these tides resolve themselves naturally into two series, apparently corresponding in nature, though not in duration, to those referred to by 1\litchell. They finally unite, as previouslr mentioned, to form a diurnal compound tide. The time occupied iu passing from the middle of one compound series, through the vario~s changes, to the middle of the next compound series, is about a month. The duration of the semidiurnal tides is somewhat more than two-thirds of this time. '.l'he two arc theoretically referred to the two orders of transits, upper in north and lower in south declination, and vice versa. The north declination, more enduring and potential, exercises a greater amount of attraction, aud is thus ap. parentl;y enabled to o\·ercome the va.rious opposing forces, aml combine both waves in one compound tide. 111 this, nernrtheless, the various elements can be more or less distiuctly traced, though not sufficicutly pronounced to form a true tidl:'. During the epoch of south declination, the attraction of the moon, even at its maximum, is insufficient to combine the two waves. It wi1I be sufficient for present purposes to desm·ibe their respecti\-e characteristics.
TIDE REFERRED TO LOWER TRANSITS.

This tide, colored blue iu the profile, presen'es in its t-0tal range a greater elevation above the plaue of reference than the other, though its range averages much less than that of the other. The highest waters appertain to this group. This tide reaches its maximum in height about the time of the moon'is fin;t quarter, that maximum being greatest when the moon's zero declination most nearly correspoudis with that phase; or, in other words, when the moon exercises the least attracti\·e influence. The maximum height is smallest when the quadrature approximates most nearly to the maximnm of declination, north or sout.h. In these res[iects, and in some others, it is the oppoisite of Urn other semi-tliurua] wave. The latter seems to be governed by the declination to a prepouderating- extent, while upon this the phase seems to exert a more exclnsiYe infinence. As the phase gained upon the clec1inati.on about four lunar days a month, (that is, the interval between new moon and the preceding zero declination increased a.t that rate,) during the period covered by our observations; so the body of this tide seemed to gain on the body ul' the other in time. The irregulariUes of the periods of phase and declination, however, prevent the gain of the tide from being exactly proportioned to the gain of the phase. From October 13, 1871, to February 14, 1872, they were respectively as followH:

This tide, being l'eferable to the lower transits, should, according to the theory, have inepon· derated over the other in height immediately after the moon's southing, lmt this did uot actually take place until :-.;ome days (four to ten) after; a fact not easy to explain, e\"eu if, taking the height" as an iJl(lex to the age of the tide, (as maintained by Airy,) we consider this tidal wave as being from four to ten days oltl. In that case, we should ham to admit the possibility of a difference in age betweeu the semi-diurua,l wa\'es of one d<'y at one locality-ancl not only a difterence, but a variable difference-for the other wave appears to agree ver,y constantly aml pr.owptly with the declination in its changes in height and range. The" blue" tide emerges from the compound tide about the time of the south moon's least iDfluenoe; i.e., about her third quarter. The i:;horter the interval of time between this phase and the .zero declination, the earlier the tide appears. It is inconsiderable when compared with the

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

185

"red'' tide, both in height and range, increasing slightly in the l~tter about the time of zero declination, and then dimiuishing, reaching sit minim um range about the time of new moon. The height and range then gradually increase, and, at the varying period preYiously mentioned, it lea Yes its subordinate position behind and below the "red" tide, and apparently passes tlle latter, taking the lead in height and rapidly increasing iu range~ the last being greatest at zero dedination. If the llody of the "red" wave ·retained the same position with reg;:.rd to tuat of the " blue'' oJJr, the former would resume its superiority al.lout foll mo J11. As before stated, however, the "bhrn ,. tide gains with the gain of the interval between the 1ihase and zero declination, and, therefore, it happens that, with the approximation of the full moon to maximuru north declination, the ·q.11ue ,. tide has gained so much in the race that both are engulfed in the compound tide before the "red" one can attain its original position in ad .... ance. A fnll year's observations are required before tlrn details of the varying and persistent conflict can Le enumerated. It is probable, howe»er, that at some tim~ during tl.Je tidal year, the "blue" tide emerges from the compound tide, above a11d before the other, though only a hint of this is to Le fotmd in our obsPrrntions.
TIDE REFERRED TO UPPER TRANSITS.

It now remains to deseribe the peculiarities of tbe "red" tide. It is naturally referable to the upper transits, but appears to be mainly gonrued by the changps in the moon's declination. When the compound wave separates into its dual elem.cuts, (always in north declination,) as far as our observations go, tlie "red" tide at once takes the lead, ra11idly increasing its range and (in general) its height. It reaches its maximum range within half a lunar day of the moon's maximum south declination. It attains its maximum height sometimes before, sometimes after that time, varying with the relati\·e interval between the time of new moon and tliat of her maximum sonth declination, b11t varying so irregularly as to render any ge11eralizatiou Oil the matter impractieaule without more material in the shape of obsen·ations. At the variable period referred to in the account of the "Line': wa\·e, t.his tide falls l>ehind the latter in height. It continues in this subordinate position until (when the foll moon is sufficiently distant from maximum north declination) about the time of foll moon, or a period varying witl1 the ath·ancc of the phase upon the zero <lecliua.tion, but always some d;iy.s after the latter. It then resumes the place in advance and tile superiority in height which it had lost .. At the s.~me time, it diminishes very rapidly in range until it is 111e1·gell with the "blue" in one compoaml tide. · As before mentioned, however, m; the time of full moon aml maximum north declination approximate, (through the gain of the phase on the declination,) this tide beoomes unable to regain its superiority, before it is merged in the compo1rnd tide, in what wonld otherwise be the moment of victory.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF ON THE TIDAL CURRENTS OF UNALASHKA.

The old l'esidents of Unalashka belie,·e the title to come from the eastward through Akutan }">ass, and tbis belief is fully corroborated by our observations. A series of observations for determining the relation between the oceanic tide and the Lille ax it appears at Iliuliuk was decided upon in June, 1872. The circumstances which led me to undertake the observatio11s in the Pass unassisted were detailed in my report of progress. The station selected was a small islet in the middle of the Akutan Pass, one of a group knowu as the Gull P..ocks. No other position near Unalashka was at once so accessible and less sn~ject 1.o the action of disturbing influences on the title. 'A sunken buoy, with float attached, and a surface l.moy were used in determining tbe currents. The simultaneous observations of the height of the water were read on a graduated staff~ and the temperature of the water was determined with a Casella thermometer. The weather was eminently favorable for observation, being calm, and without any ground·swell; the s}\y was overcast. The obser'\"ations in the pass co::nprised readings every ten minutes for twenty-four consecutive houri<. Those at Unalashka hegan before and lasted longer than those taken in the Pass, but were otherwise simultaneous. Tlie results may be regarded as approximating to geueral accuracy, and are briefly as follows: I. The tide attains its maximum and minimum in the Pass about two hours before these })Oh1ts are reached at Iliuliuk. II. The difference between the lliuliuk tides and the Pass tides, in range or volume, is about eight inches. Using the corresponding lowest waters as a plane of reference, the Iliuliuk tide is the higher. III. The tide in reaching Iliuliuk, through the various passage-ways about to be described, is shorn of some of its irregularities in form; and the distinctness of the two elementary waves of which it is compounded is to a great extent lost. A reference to tbe accompanying profile will exhibit tilese propositions more clearly. "\Vith regard to the current causerl by the action of the tidal wave, it appears : IV. The rising tide is stronger than the fa.Hing title. V. The rising tide advances on the surface a little before the water at. a depth of 6 fathoms, and begins to move north ward. It also creeps along the shores slightly before it bf'comes noticeable in mid-channel. VI. The temperat.tue of the water which comes in with the tide is a degree higher than the Bering Sea water which it drives before it. In this case, the temperatures were respecth·ely 450
and 44°: In regard to proposition I, it may be remarked that the two hours which elapse be.fore the tide

reacbes its full height at Iliuliuk, after having done so in the pass, cannot be considered as entirely taken up with the regular march of the tide. Mncb of this time is lost in forcing a passage-way into Bering Sea, during which process tide-rips are formed. These rips normally are just beyoutl the northern entrance of the Pass, and only occur within the rass when, to the barrier of .Bering Sea water, is added the additional force of a northerly wind. In propo1tion to the strength of the latter, the rips will aJlproximate more nearly to the middle of the Pass, and will be more violent. They are never known to occur to the south of the middle or smallest diameter of the Pass, and with southerly winds are comparatively insignificant or even wautiug. Tbese facts indicate that the bulk of the tidal flow is from the south, northerly and westerly in the direction of the axis of the Pass, and afterward with the trend of the islands. Observations taken off the heads of Captain's Bay, April 22, showed a surprising difference between the surface-temperature of Bering Sea and the deep water; the former being 390, and the latter, e'\"en with the correction applied, falling below the freezing-point. It appears that the stratum of warmer water (which is clearly due to the influx through the passes of warm water from the northern edge of the Ala.ska current) was ext1·emely thin, less than 28 fathoms, and probably not much over 15 fathoms. The distribution of life also corroborates this evidence; the animals living on the bottom of Bering Sea being all arctic forms, while many of those of the shores and shallow water are of warm tenwerate types. Among the former m~y be named Astarte, Car-

dita borealis, Peronwa, &c., and, among the latter, Naeella, Scaphella, arnl Cancellaria. After clearing the Pass, the tidal current curves to tl!e west and south, striking full on the west shore of Captain's Bay, and is reflected to the southeast. But a small 1mrt of it passes to the eastwanl of Amaknak falanll; the majority finds its way through the strait between South .A.maknak and the west side of the bay, one branch being deflected to the northeast by Obernoi Poiut and entcri11g Iliuliuk Harbor. The accompanying sketch shows the general course of the flood-tide iu the southern and eastern part of Captain's Bay and its apJJertaining harbors in calm weatlier. The ebb takes a nearl;y reverse direction, except that a large portion of the water accurnulatecl in the bight forming the east entrance r·asses out through Iliuliuk Harbor, south, and then northwest through the heads of Captain's Harbor. Thus, in calm weather, with an ebb-tide, there is usually a strong current into Iliuliuk Harbor, though, witli a risiug tide, but little rn ns out in a reverse direction. All tbiR, however, may be altered by the wind prevailing. If it be north or north west, (tide rising,) a larger part of the current may be deflected to the east of Amaknak, and we shall have a current into iusteatl of ont of Ilil:liuk Harbor. A nortlJeast or southeast wind has a contrary effect. "'ith ebb-tide and a southerly wind, a strong current may run out of the nortlieastentrance of Iliuliuk Hart.or, the egress of the water by its usual channd being im11eded ; and these conditions may be indefinitely varied. Taken as a whole, however, in Iliul iuk Harbor, the tide rises and falls principally through the son them eutranc<'. Although it is frequently stated that the height of the tide here is much affected by the wind, yet no important difference attributable to this cause presented itself during our observations. It is stated that the Bering Sea titles incre:tse in volume to the eastward, reacbiug their max· imum (16 to 22 feet) in the narrow estuaries of the Kuskoquim and Bristol Bay, and diminishing to the northward aucl westward.
THE .AL.A.SK.A. CURRENT. I use the above appellation to designate, ill this report, a current which bathes a greater portion of the coast-line of this territory than any other one oceanic stream; and to which, in great part, is due the peculiar climate of most of the Alaska coast south of Bristol Bay. Certain peculiarities in the tlistribution of animal and vegetable life may also be reasonabl;y referred to its influence. 'l'he existence of such a current as a whole, was, to the best of my knowledge, first coutendetl for by Assistant George Davidson, United States Coast Survey~ in an able argument, (Coast Surw·~· Report for 1867, p. 205,) in which the high isothermal line of the shores of tlie Gulf of Alaskn, the isolated but rather numerous observations of the older na,·igators, the Hnssians and others, and the notes of the Coast Sun·ey geographical reconnaissance of Alaska in 1867, w1·re all brouglr to bear upon the subject. During the last fourt{'en months, I haYe collected a number of addi, tional notes upon those portions which we did not visit ourselves, the testimony being all one way; and, indeed, there is hardly any room for a cloubt upon the subject. The existence of a continuous current,·trending with the shores of the Gulf of Alaska, the peninsula of .A.liaska, and at least the eastern portion of the Aleutian Islaad;, wilt be assumed here. Its origin by a ddkction of a portion of the great North Pacific streani in longitude 1430 west bas been treated of in the report of Assistant Davidson alreatly alluded to. As a contribution to the knowledge of the suliject, I have to offer a summary of observations taken under my direction by Ottr party on that portion of this stream situated beween longitude 15U::> antl 1670 west, and extending sou th of the coast from two to six degrees in latitude; also some notes obtained from others in relation to tl!ose portions of the current lying to the eastward. Our observations were taken during tlJree voyages between UnalasLka. and tl10 Shurnagins, respectively in l\Iarcb, April, and June, 1872, on the latter part of our voyage from San Francisco to Unalashka in September, 1871; during our stay among the Shumaginsfrom June to September, 187·2; and on our voyage thence to San Francisco via Kadiak. A synopsis of the observations is gi\·eu herewith, comprising not only the notes on currents and temperatures, but also the direction of the winds at the time of observation. The thick and foggy weather and frequent se,·ere storm1> which prevail through a great part of the season have somewhat interrupted the coutinuit~· of our record. The great amount of leeway made by the Humboldt under all circumstances, has, in most ca~es, tended to diminish the apparent rate of the current; and it was impossible to obtaiu obser·

Bcariugs ou the land were also una,·ailable for the most part, as the coast-lir1es on the only charts in existence are bid down Yery inaccurately. :Ne,·ertheless, tlie material collected is less meager and more iuteresti ng than migltt hin-e been expected, aml a greater knowletlge of tue tides of this region will probably reconcile many discrepancies in the observations of' the ol1ler voyagers.

It is uot snrprising that, its true course should often lie masked or temporarily di,·erted by these agencies. An ofticer of the rc\·enne mariue on dnty on this coast has e\·en reported that, in his opinion, ''the currents along thi8 1mrt of tlrn coast are conteollecl entirely by the winds.''" It has, 110wcver, been prO\·ed by our observations that, in the body of the current off shore, ~t southerly and westerly drift of at least a knot and two-thirds an hour may be maintained directly in the teeth of a strong acherse wind. 1 will leave the discussion of these modif'.ying agencies for the present, and gi\·e, in as compact a form as possible, tlte general characteristics of the current within the region over which our obsen'ations extended. The general courRe of the current is about west-southwest, Yarying from this to the north and i-:onth according to the locality and the modifsing agencies, which increase ill power as we approach the coast.. In general, it trends with the trend of the land. At some iutletenniuate point, the current deflected from the great North Pacific stream· divides into two branches, one of which passes between Kadiak and the mainland, hugging the coast, and finally striking off to the south ward in the vicinity of the Shnmagins. The other has a more evenly western course, and its extreme sonthern limit is j·et undefined, but may probah1y be found between latitude 510 aud i'i20 north. Between these two arml'l, a couutei· current or eddy exists, running in an easterly direction. September rn, 1871, aD<l March 2G, 1872, we found a northwest by uorth cnrrent of nearly a knot an hour in latitude li2° and longitude l(j30 west, approximate; but about sixty miles to tlle north of this, on the 20th of September, we came upon the eddy auove mentioned, having a velocity of two-thirds of a knot an hour, with a temperature of 490; and again 011 the 27th of March, 1872, we reached its upper or northern edge when lyiHg to, antl found a velocity, against a strong adverse wmd, of a quarter of a knot an hour, with a temperature of 400. Between longitude u;70 and Hi3° west, this eddy appears to lie Yer,y narrow, probably not exceeding tweuty miles in widtli, and has a temperature auout the same as the north edge of the south arm of the Alaska enrrent. Later i-u the season, we encountered it (or a similar one) again, and found it striking to the south. ward, where, iuessed l.iy the northern ai·m of the Alaska current before reaching the shelter of Ka· tliak, an<l then continuing in an easterly direction south of that island close to its shores; its rate :n·eraging a litt.le less tLan a knot an hour, and its temperature about 520, nearly the same as that of the south arm of the Alaska current, which we entered a few days subsequently. The counter. current mentioned by LiRiansky, and encountered by Assistant Davidson in 18G7 when searching for the Pamplona Rocks, is very probably the same. The southeru edge of tl.Je south arm would appear from our observations. on the voyage from Kadiak to San Francisco to be met with in about latitude 50° 30' north; but yery many more observations must be made before we can arrive at a correct understanding of these details. There can be no doubt that we struck the great North Pacific easterly stream, with a temperature of about 600, on the 14th of September, in about latitude 430 37', approximate. Our observations of September, 1871, gh'e a temperature at the surface of 490 for the north arm near its southern edge, 500 for the middle of the stream, gradually decreasing to 480 on the edge, which impinges on the islands. At the same tinw, the temperature of the Bering Sea water was 46°; and, the tide turning to rise while we were in the Akutan Pass, the influx of Pacific water was marked by a rise of one degree in temperature of the surface. A similar rise of temperature was observed whilemakingtidalobservationsinthePassinJune,1872. In March and April, thenortb edge a\'eraged 37° and 37°.5, the center of the current 400, and the southern edge sso. At no time was it practicable to obtain trustworthy temperatures of the water of this current at any ·lepth below the surface. In September, 1872, we were able to ol>tain observations at 25 fathoms below the sar·Report on a eruiee in Alaska, Capt.. J. W. White, Sena.ti'> Ex. Doe. No. 8, January, 1869.

face of tlte counter current or eddy before describell, and found tlte temperature, wlleu the corr('Ctiou for the thermometer was applied, to he the same as at the surface. In June, 1872, the temperature of the uorth eclge of the north arm had risen to 43::i, farther Ronth 44°, tLough we did not reach tbc center of it, wl1ich wa8 not improbably a degree higl1er. The temperature of the son th arm it1 Septemuer, 184'.!, raugc<l from 490 to 520. ""ith regard to velocity, that of the u01tl1 arm may be safely set down as at lc:ist a knot aud a <1uarter an hour in those parts most free from the action of external agencies. It is much greater in many places where the actions of the ti,lc aIHl win<l co111hi11e to accelerate it,and correspondingl,\less when they combine to retard it. The rate of the south arm appears to IJe alJout a knot an hour, though our opportunities for olJsmviug it were so fow that this must IJo regarded as merely npproxinrnte. Ou the firgt occasion in September, 1871, ib was 0.93 knots per hour; on tile 2Gth of )farch, 1872, Uri knots; and farther east, in September, 1872, we determined it to lm ~lightly over a knot au hour. In regard to the width, the north arm may safely be assumed to average ahon ta hundred miles. That of the south arm is probably twice as great, but further obscn·ations are necessarv to determine tLis accurately. Cc1ptain Archimandritoff, late of the Russian-American company, in.forms me that that portion ~f the north arm which pass<:>s north of Kadiak (iseulling a hranch into Cook's Inlet) through Shelikoft' Strait, has a velocity of firn or six knots an hour with tlJe ti<le fayoring. 1\1. Aphonse Pinart, a gentlemen who lias lately exploretl this region iu the intere8ts of pltilolog.r, gaye rue a graphic account of his passage across tlJe Shelikoff Strait. According to his statement, the current is very strong; the passage i11 skin-canoes, from the peninsnht to the island, is commenced from a point on the former twenty miles to tbe eastward of the point on K:idiak, whiclJ it is proposed to reach; the cnrrent, even at slack water and in calm wc:1ther, (when <tlone it is practicable to cross,) carrying the canoes over that diistance to the soutli and west. I take it to be this portion of the stream which, crossed by the barrier of the Shumagins, pours through it principlilly by two channels; the main one being the deep gap bet ween Nagai and the iislands to the westward of it, and the other the strait between tlJe north end of Luga and the peninsula. The former strikes full on the south end of Unga Island, near Delaroff Harbor, anti is slightly deflected to the southward. It may IJe mentioned here that the current in tLese straits of Nagai is very strong. The tide has no perceptible effect in retarding it. Vessels at anchor there always tail to the southwest, and with a southwest or west wind an extremely bad sea is produced. The south end of Unga is, howe1er, the gainer. This locality becomes green weeks before the sm·rounding country, and vegetabl~s grow· more rapidly and mature earlier f.lian elsewl1erP, 011 account or the b:tlmy air and higher temperatur~ brought by the current. The branch which passes to tlle north of Unga is less powerful, but by no means insignificant, also deO.ected to the sonthward by the islanus and sl10als oft' the coast of Aliaska, it joi us with the Nagai branch, and both dash upon the rocks and reefs of Sannakh with all their velocity. The current at this point attains, under fa \'Orab le circumstances, a far greater rapidity than came under our notice elsewhere, and may reach three or four knots an hour at times when wind, tide, rmll current are passing in one direction. The deflection causeu by the Sannakh reefs turns this portion of the current to tlJe south of southn-est for a time, but it soon regains its normal course, trending with the islands and having its center of wlocity from thirty to forty miles sotith of them, when in the vicinity -Of Unalashka. It is an established fact that the tides of this region rise tmrnnl the west, and fall toward the east, approximately; this is universally known among the natives and residents of the region, and is confirmed by my observations in the Akutan Pass. This course being coincident with (and perhaps caused by) the general trend of the coast and direction of the currents, it naturally follows that the rate of the latter inshore is accelerated with the rise, and, to some extent, retarded by the fall of the tides particularly in passages an'l straits, and their vicinity. The fall, being opposed to the direction of ~he current, is always less powerfol than the rise. This is especially noticeable in the vicinity of the passes, where the outward current is so effectually checked hs the coastcnrrent that but a yery small proportion of the Bering Sea water enters the Pacific, while a cormspondingly large proportion of Pacific water pours into Beri11g Sea w.itl.1 eve~y flood-tide. How fat· this.may hold good to the westwar<l of Unalashka I cannot say; but it ts emmeut.Jy true throughout.

the region we h:we visited. So, too, in those passes which have a more nearly north and son th axis, like Unimak and False Pass, we find fewer tide-rips and :fierce bores, such as prevail in Akutan allll Unalga Passes, where the axis inviting the influx of the current is nearly east and west. The force of the wincfin affecting the direction of the current, except in narrow passages aml in shoal water, bas, I think, heen much overrated. In shoal water, like the eastern half of Bering Sea, the wind is all-powerful, and drives the water irresistibly before it. But in deep water, such as the offshore portions of the Gulf of Alaska and the northern border of the North Pacific, I am inclined to believe that the principal result of a strong wind opposed to the current is the creation of a ,-ery bnd sea. Small and narrow bodies of water, like the deflected strip of current at Sanna'kb, may be diverted from their usual course, and in narrow passages the power of the >dnd in retardiug the opposed current cannot be questioned, but our observations lead me to think that elsewhere its effects are comparatively insignificant, or, at all events, less obvious. A long and careful series of obsenations would be needed to decide the question, which presents the greater difficulties from the fact that the agencies to be investigated in their very nature present a1most insurmountable obstades to observation.
EFFECT OP THE ALASKA CURRENT ON TllE CLIMATE OF THE ALEUTIAN DISTRICT.

'l'he temperatures of the sea-water at the surface and at a depth of five fathoms were ubsei vetl, during the entire year, as continuously as circumstances would permit. The means and extremes for each month and quarter and for the year are appended in the meteorological abstract herewith forwarded. It will be seen on comparison that the temperature ot' the Bering Sea water below the surface averages about 3° lower than the temperatures taken south of the islalllls during the same months, and this appears to hold good throughout the year. This would give a yearly average temperature for the Alas}rn current of about 450, which cannot be far from the truth. It is a significant fact that the mean annual temperature of Unalashka is within a degree of the mean tem· 11erature of the deep-sea water for the same period. The latter avera.ges a little higher anti the surface-water a little lower than the mean temperature of the air. All three do not vary among themselves more than a degree and a half. The air, howe\·er, reaches its maximum in August, while the sea-water is warmest in September.
TBB ornCULAR CUHRENT 0.F BERING SEA.

I make use of this term to designate a current supposed hy Assistant Davidson to result from the impinging of the Bering Sea branch of the Kuro-Siwo on the island of Saint Lawrence, and which is descrihed by him as sweeping around that sea, in a snbcircular manner, from west to east, south, and finally west again, north of the Aleutian Islands. We have not visited the western portion of Bering Sea, aud can therefore supply no inform'.\tion in regard to the existence of such a current there; but I ha\·e collected a number of notes from others, and made some observations on the eastern portion of the sea. A more or Jess intermittent current does appear to exist around the eastern and southeastern shores of Bering Sea, but it may be accounted for by the following causes: The large rivers of that coast all del>ouche toward the south and west. Tbe titles rise toward the north and fall toward the south and .west with great force in the numerous shallow estuaries east of Unimak Pass; while the westerly drift north of the islands, as far as Unalasbka, has been shown to result in great part from the influx: of Pacific water with the ti(le. The whole of that portion of Bering Sea is exceedingly sh:tllow, a\eraging less than thirty fathoms; and it may reasonably be supposed that this body of' water, with the great river-currents, the tides, and the tidal current;; through the passes, all pushing on its circumference in one direction, wo11ld receive a motion iu that direction varying in velocity with the variations in the above-mentioned factors. The follow· ing notes have a bearing on this subject: In July, 18VO, Bernard Bendel, esq., in the schooner J,izzie Sha, started for Unalashka from the mouth of the Kuskoquim. The first land sighted was the point north of Destruction Volcano, in longi · tmle rn40 45' west, approximate. A strong westerly wind and clear weather prevailing, they beat all day off this point without being able to make any westing. The night was foggy, and they continued to bea~ against the same wind until 9 a. m. the next day, when the fog lifted, and they found tbero·

selves, to their great astoni8hment, off Akhun Bay, in longitude 1650 4i"i'. The wiuu then Lauleu a little to the northward, so that they could barely run to westward; aud toward night, the fog rising, tliey proposed to run into Akhun Bay, as they supposed, but, on examination, tlie la ml pron~d to be tLat of Unalashka, near Cape Kalekhta. A dead calm prevented their working into Kalekbta l3ay, and during the night they were. carried by the ebb-tide to the eastward as far as the longitrnle or Unalga. The first stretch was made in twenty-four hours. _ On a voyage toward the Kuskoquim in the same season, when off Cape Neweuham, it slrnt in calm and foggy. In the morning, the fog lifted, and they were oft' Ragemeister Ish·nd, having drifted the whole of that distance in twelrn hours. \Vhen on the Frances L. Steele, in 1868, bound from Amak Island towaru l:"nimak l'ass, we were unable for sm-eral hours to make headway against an easterly cnrrent, although the wiud favored. With the turn of the tide, however, though the wind meanwhile had shifted to au unfavorable quarter, the vessel was able to make a fair course toward her destination. Capt. E. Hennig, of the Alaska ·commercial Compan:.y, who has s11ent several years in this region and made many voyages between Unalashka and the Kuskoquim and Nu;;hergak Hinrs, informs me that the currents in this part of Bering Sea are >ery yarfable, and, in ltis opi11iou, depend in great part on the tides. The above notes, taken togetlier with the low temperature of the water below t11e surface, and its slight depth, seem to imply that no regular oceanic current exists on the extreme eastern border of Bering Sea, even if the small depth of water would admit of it. It is a well-known fact that the ice-line in winter describes a curve from the Siberian coasts in latitude 62° to 640 north, inclosing the Saint Matthew group of islands, reaching sonth nearly to the island of Saint Paul, of tltc l'ribiloff group, and thence extending eastward into tlie head of Bristol Bay. This ice first gives way to the westward, along the Siberian coast, and tlte whaler,; press in on this line every spring, following the open water until they reach the Arntic. To the east of Saint Matthew, the ice endures much longer, and a passage into Norton Sound can frequently be made by going to the westward of Saint Lawrence, while the ice to the northeast of Saint Matthew, between Suint J,awrence and the mainland, still presents an impenetrable barrier. Tl!is would hardly be the case were any large porticn of the warm curreut tleflecte<l to tl.Je eastward hy impinging ou Saint Lawrence Island. According to information ftlrnished by Captain Chapman, of the Hannah B. Bourne, wl10 has wintered in Plover Bas and at Unalashka, on one occasion a wllaler, storn in the ice off Cape Saiut Thaddeus, drifted into Seniavine Strait shortly after the ice passed out of the latter place. Also, in the spring of 1871, the ice between Plover Bay and Saiut Lawrence Island gave way late in May, and, in the middle of June, a rnssel might have been na\·igatcd there safely if she could have forced her way through the floating ice to the southward. The ice on the west of Saint La wrenc:e Island, according to Captain Chapman, is always open hefore that to the east and southeast of it. In 1869, Capt. E. Hennig, in the schooner Hutchinson, bound for Saiut Michael's, Norton Sound, encountered floating field-ice in the month of June. This was in the Jatitutle of Cape Homanzoft\ about half-way between Saint Matthew, Saint Lawrence, and the mainland. At the same time, Capt. E. E. Smith, in another vessel, went to the westward of these islands, and fouud all clear of ice. Captain Hennig, after working through one hundred miles of this ice, founrl nil clear to tlie north of it. It appeared to extend from the islands to the main. In the spring of 1872, Captain A.rchimaudritoff, in the schooner John Bright, ou an exploring expedition, fitted ont by the Alaska Commercial Company, visited the Pribilofl' Islands in the earl,\· part of June. Re sailed north from them, and found the ice south of Saint Matthew, in latitude 580 30'. Re sounded a good deal about the island of Saint Paul, finding 70 fathoms eighty miles southwest of it and a few miles farther, on the same line, 120 fathoms without bottom. He found a cold.current ~unning fifteen miles a day in a due soutlI direction north of Saint Paul, and stated that the currents in that vicinity vary with the wincls, &c., but that season are generally south· westerly. Judging by wllat we know of the topography of Bering_ Sea bottom, a~d by the memoranda above recorded, it would ·seem more probable that the deflection of any1 p_ort10n of. the north· erly warm stream in Bering Sea to the eastward ant! southward would be more hkely to occur at tlie edges of the shallow plateau to the south and west of St. Lawrence, St. Matthew, and St. Paul Islands

than upon it nearer their shores. If this were the case, the southern deflection wou1<1 strike the Aleutians to the weshrnrd of Unalashka, and tlms would be explained the absence of an,y trace of its existence in the evidence I have been able to accumulate.. That some deflection of a portion of the northerly warm stream does occur, or, at least, that a part of it is lost or remains quiescent in tl.ie main basin of Bering Sea, is ver~· probable. In evidence of it may be mentioned the fact tl.uit cocoa-nuts (and perhaps other tropical productions) are frequently cast on the northern shores of the .Aleutians. Jn the winter of 1871-'72, I picked up un the west shore of Amaknak Island nearly the whole of a cocoa-nut shell, with the husk attacl1e<l, and I was informed by the residents that they are not unfrequentl~· found there. Among the mb'\cellaneous drift-stuff which accumulates in those bays which open to the northward are found in particularly large quantities the peculiar 8pruce (Abies alba) of the Yukon and Kuslrnqui!ll, amt that (A. Sitkensis) of Kadiak and Sitka; also, the Sitka cedar, ( G. Nutkatensis,) the poplar or cottonwood, birch, and alder. The cedar is frequently called "camphor-wood," from its odor, and erroneous}~' supposed to be of .Asiatic origin. ~'he three first mentioned are particularly abundant iu those bays opening to the northeast, and compose nearly all of the drift-wood found on the islands. "' c found one tree of the Sitka spruce, with green leaves still attached to it, and one specimen of wild ginseng, (P. horridum,) which is more or less peculiar to the Sitka district. A more thorough examination of the drift- wood deposits would doubtless reveal many interesting facts. Among other matters thrown up on the beach of Captain's Bay by the winter-storms of 1871-'72 was a piece of the schooner Idaho, wrecked the previous year on the south coast of Unimak.
NOTES OX THE
SHU~IAGIN

ISLANDS.

The following hJ·drographic and other memoranda were collected during our visits to the Shmuagins. This group is very incorrectly laid down on all existing charts, and we made great exertions to obtain as many intersections as possible from known points on the other islands:. Jn this way, we shall be able, when our work is platted, to define the area within which a miijodty of the islands are situated, and also to correct the shore-lines to sonie extent wl!ei·ever they came under our immediate observations. We shall also he able to define much more near!~· than has yet been done the actual position of the more prominent points 1.Jy these intersections. "The geological features of the group, which are ver.r simple, (as partly shown iu the annexed diagram,) have considerable bearing on their bydrographic characteristics. Two axes of elevation are especially noticeable; the main one being at right angles to the great volcanic axis of the pcniusula of Aliaska, and the other parallel with it, and, of eourse, at right angles with the former. The axis of every harbor, ridge, or strait among these islands lies in one or the other of these two axes. The rocks all dip at various angles to the westward, (magnetic,) and preserve the following order. To the east the islands arc composed of massirn granite, uot bedded, and intruding in tl!e form of dikes and veins into tlie metamorphic slat<'s and sandstones, which surmount it in the middle islands. The metamorphic rocks iu their turu, as we reach the western Shnmagins, are surmounted Ly Tertiary stmta, of which the upper beds coutain fossiliferous layers of Miocene age, the lower ones containing remains of warm temperate vegetation, and the uppermost the remains of marine animals, mollusks, and cetacea. The Tertiary and granite rocks, opposite extremes, decompoise into sand, forming good btaches, while the recent Javas (which interrupt the continuity of the succession of tlle other rocks, especially about Popoff Strait) and the metamorphic slates are of such a flinty hardness that the beaches and shores of the islands composed of them are rocky and irregular, so that it is exceedingly difficult to make one's way alou~ the beaches or to find a boat-landing even in the harbors. The bottom of the straits and passages about these islands partakes of the irregularities which characteri~e the islands themselves, in which, however, there is a certain uniformity. Thus, all the islands being composed of uplifted waves of strata having their axis trending in a north awl south llirection, so, in a. general way, the submarine elevations are parallel with. them. This is especially marked in the strait which separates Nagai from the islands to the westward. At the mouth of the large bay, without a name, which heads to the eastward in Sanborn Harbor, Nagai, we

obtain 60 fathoms, gradually deepening to 100 and 120 fathoms; two miles off shore is a long submarine elevation known to the fishermen as the" Ridge," where 45 aml50 fathoms maybe obtained. Beyond this, again, is a Lleep depression, where over 200 fathoms are reported, (aml through which one branch of the north arm of the Alaska current pours,) which separates Nagai and the islanus east of it int~ a differeut hydrographic group from those to the westward. Each of these groups is composed of ilands separated from each other by comparativel.r shallow water. In these notes, I shall consider these groups separately. To sa\'e repetition, those islands, harbors, &c., which are not to be found on the charts, will be marked with an asterisk, and thmie which are without names by a dagger. In all cases, I have adopted the names used on the first pulllished cliarts, as far as tlIPy ban· come under my observation, and any otber names of subsequent date are inclosed in brackflts.
WESTERN SHn.uGINS.

This group consists of Unga Island, Popoff Island, Korovin, Bould.vr, and Andronica Islands, the Haystacks, Seal Rocks, and fi \'C or six smaller islands. Unga.-This island contains two good haroors and onp anchornge. In connection with Popoff Island in the strait another good harbor is formed. Delaroff Harbor, so called, is the best known, but is merely a safe anchorage in northerly and westerly winds. The holding-ground is poor and rocky; se\·eral reefs in ill-determined positions exist off the entrance; and the inner anchorage affords only a fathom and a half at low water, rocky bottom, with room for only one of the smallest class of Yessels, an<l open to Routheast winds, which are the most pre\'alent and powerful in the stormy season. Neu; har7Jor. * t-A new harbor exists on the east side of unga in the deep bas north of Delaroff Harbor. It is formed by a sand-spit, behind which, in a southeaster, Captain l\Iorse, of the schoom~r J. D. Sanborn, in 1869, foanrl 9 fathoms water, gJJJ holding-ground, and protection from all winds. \\'e did no<; enter it. Two small islands t exist in the middle of the wide strait between Popoff and L'"uga Islands. There is plenty of water on either side of them, and no hidden dangers known. Zachary Bay, (Coal Harbor, North Harbor of Unga, &c.)-This bay is open to all northerly winds, the holding-ground is bad, and the shoals extend balf a mile from shore on the west side, while on the east side, within the same limits, are numerous reefs and shoals, some of which are hidden. A very long anll dangerous reef extends two miles from the West Head, north by compass, toward Gull Island, a small rouuded rock, 20 feet liigh, which lies off the mouth of the bay. That portion of this bay lying to the southwest of Round Island is shoal, but a navigable passage exists on each side of Round Island into a new har7Jor. t This harbor was first entered by the boats of the Western Union Telegraph expellition in 18u5, and very roughly sketched by their parties. It is one of the best lwrbors in the Shumagins. The holdiug-grouud is the be~t in 9 fathoms water, muddy bottom, with plenty of room; water, wood, (aldt!rs,) and fine Rand all conveniently situated. A small islet (called in our notes Range Island) lies between Round Island and the poiut to the south of it; it is about 15 feet above high-water mark in height. .A long and narrow shoal extends in a southeast direction from the spit on Round Island for half a mile. Vessels beating in by the northeast entrance should keep open the eastern end of Range Island and the western end of the point south of it, thus avoiding this shoal. The astronomical position of Round Island was obtained by us, the shore-line run with the telemeter, and the harbor sounded, but we had not the time to devote to triangulation. A view of the northern entrance t-0 this harbor is herewith forwarded. Observations for magnetic dip were also obtained here, and the height of Round Island determined to be 427 feet · .The western shore of Zachary Bay is rapidly wearing away under the heavy swell caused by northeast storms in winter. At least 200 feet have been washed away since my visit in 1865, and the water along the shore has become much more shoal. The maximum muge of the spring-tides here WJMJ ob11er~ to be 12 feet; the ordinary tides average from 3 to 6 feet. . The bottOm..ofthe Straitt north of Unga Island is very irregular and rocky. Just east of Gull Island good t\sbing is reported~ on a bank of small extent, with 40 fathoms water.

REPORT OF THE

S~PERINTENDENT

OF

Popoff Strait.-This strait., varying from half a mile to two miles wide, separates Popoff from Unga Island. It is of considerable importance; as, besides containing a good harbor, it forms the easiest and shortest passage from Unga to Belkoffsky settlement, and from the fishing-grounds about Korovin it is the nearest and most accessible shelter in storms. It is obstructed by two reefs, which may, however, with the information gathered b.Y us, be easily avoided. One reeft on the west shore makes out. from the first rocky point on that side after passing the sand-spit from the south. It was known to the Russiaus, and is well marked by kelp and partly bare at low water. The other*t is abreast the first point on the east side after passing the sand. spit. It is never bare, has but little kelp on it, and ma.v have 9 feet of water on it in extreme low tides. It was not known to the Russians. In June, 1867~ the brig Olga and the J. D. Sanborn got 011 this reef, while the schooner F. L. Steele passe<l safely irnside of it. Iu 1869, the schooner J. H. Roscoe an<l another vessel touched on it. Vessels may keep in the channel and avoi<l both reefs by the following rule: After passing the sand-spit from the south or Hauge Island from the north, keep in line with the west ends of the spit and island, which will clear all obstructfons. The least water on this line is 5k fathoms at lowest water. North of the two reefs, a rocky patch, with a good deal of kelp on it, lies in mid-channel; but it, has not less than 4 fathoms at any tide, and may be passed over safely. R.ange Island is in the northern entrance to the strait at its narrowet>;t point. There is no pas· sage to the east of it, and vessels should give the shore north of it a fair berth on either side as it makes off shoal and rocky for a quarter of a mile. We obtained a reconnaissance triangulation, soundings, sketches of the topography, and ran the shore-line of this strait from the uortheru entrance l-0 the sand-spit. The lta~·bor *t is formed by the sand-spit and the shores of Popoff Island. A \'essel may anchor almost anywhere north of the spit, getting the best protection close into the Popoff shore, in 9 fathoms bard sand. Excellent water, easily accessible, and plenty of driftwood, may be obtained here. If it seemed advisable, I wouhl suggest that the name of the Humboldt might not improperly be associated with this harbor, which, through her indirect agency, bas now been made known for the first time. Popo;tf Island, (Popoffsky of the Russians.)-This island, besides tbe harbor above mentioned, partly fonned by its shores in the strait, contains another anchorage, said to be good, though small. The southeast end of tbe island is known as Popoff Head. It is a high, rounded promontory, rising some 500 feet above the water. Off this point, good fishing is reported in 45 fathoms. On the southwestern sllore of the island is an open cove, mai·ked by a bluff of reddish sandstone, and known as Red Cove. A stream noted as a salmon-run comes in here, and there is a small settlement at its mouth, where fresh :fish, eggs, &c., may usually be obtained. On this shore the water is bold and the beaches rocky, but there are no outlying reefs. Tbere are several indentations on the eastern shore, the most northern of which contains tbe anchorage"*t before mentioned. It has been entered by several fishermen, who report fair holdinggroun<l and protection in most winds, with 7 fathoms water. ,lust north of this harbor is a small, round island, 100 feet in height, called by the Russians Vesoki, or High Island. Off tbhs island good fishing is reported, but tbe bottom is rocky and irregular, varying from 45 to 110 fathoms within a cable's length. The Straitt between Popoft' and Korovin Islands affords no anchorage; the water being deep and the bottom as abO\'e described. We found a very str-0ng current setting through it to the westward. Korovin Iswnd, ( Korovinsky of the Russians; name derh·ed from Korovin, one of the early explorers.)-This island is very high, and divided by a broad isthmus or low valley into two portions. It is extended much too far to the eastward on the charts. A small settlement exists on the south ·shore, in the valley above mentioned. Eggs, potatoes, and fresh salmon can usually be obtained. This, with those previous}~· mentioned, comprises all the native settlements on tbe Shumagius, though there are several localities on Unga, where the Delaroft' Harbor natives go for salmon in summer. A reeP·t ex.tends half a mile off shore from the southeast end of Korovin. Off the southwest end of this island is a small, low island,t separated by a narrow channel with 4 fathoms water. Here good fishing is reported, and good holding-ground in 25 fathoms, gravelly bott-Om.

. An anclwrage·t exists on the north side of Kor-ovin, which affords good protection from all winds, except northers and northeasters; in 7 fathoms, sandy mud. It bas been entered by a number of the :fishermen. In the straiit between KoroYin and Bou1ilyr, good fishiug was reported in 1873. A rock*t exists on the line between thH northeast. end of Korodn and the southern end of Bouldyr, one-third of the way from the latter to the former. It has 8 feet of water on it and is marked by a patch of kelp. It was touched with an 8-foot oar by the fishermen of the s~hooner Scotland in 1871, and seen in 1872 by Captain Henderson, of the Wild Gazelle. Bouldyr is a rocky and very high island, without any indentations or e\·en a landing-place. The water around it is sai(l to be deep and bold. The straits between Koroyin and Andronica Islands are known to the fishermen as Gorman'" Straits. They are a fa'>orable fishing-ground, though the bott-0m if; reported to be rock;1- au<l irregular. Andronica Isiand, (Yasni, or Foggy Island.)-Tllis island is very incorrectly represented on the charts. It is moderately high, and its shores are fringed with reefs, especialls on the southern and eastern sides. Tlte Haystacks.-These are a group of fin· lal'ge and a number of small rocks, whidi trnnd to the southeast from Andronica, anu extend about two miles off shore. They present from the south a pretty evenly-rounded appearance, from which their name is derirnd. The largest one is perforated by an arch, it is from 60 to 75 feet iu height. 'l'hpy am covernd with sea- bird's eggs in the seai;on, aml the watr about them is said to be bold.
EASTERN SHC\IAGINS.

Nagai.-This is the large~-.t island of the group, and remarkably irregular i11 its form and topography. Jt is really composed of six islands, united by low isthmuses. The western side is indented by five deep bays, all of them without names, three of which terminate in harbors. The shores are bold, and, in most cases, precipitous, rising, toward the middle of the island, about 1,500 feet. The few reefs which may be found off the headlands are close inshore, aud have deep water close to them. The north end of the island is a rocky IJlnft; separated by au isthmus, hardl.,· higher than the beach, from the middle portion of the island, which is very mountainous. The extreme northern end rises to the height of about 300 feet. A single rock lies off of it to the northward. It is about 40 feet high, and half a mile offshore. A reef lies off the northern hearl of the bay next southwest, distant about half a mile southwest from the point. Tlte southern arm of this bayt is long, but the shores are precipitous, and it affords no anchorage. Passing to the southwest, the last of three successive points is marked by a pinnacle, 50 feet in height, and is known as Pinnacle Point. This marks the north headland of a deep bay, t six miles long, which terminates in two harbors. This bay has 40 to 60 fathoms water, and no hidden dangers. At its eastern end, it. suddenly contracts to ft narrow passage, three-quarters of a mile in wiclth. The southern bead of this passage is calle<l Granite Po·int, and is composed of a mountain, 1,500 feet in height, with a serrated cre~t, and prncipit-Ous sides to the south. A bight exists just southwest of it, which should be avoided by vessels, as it is extremely shoal. Everywhere else, in beating in, a vessel may go close inshore. The north head of the er:trance above mentionetl is a low point, off which is a. small rounded island," known as Mack's Hea<l. Within the entrance, the bay suddenly expandl' in a northeast and southwest direction, forming Sanborn Harbor.· On the north side of the bay are several shallow indentations and one deep one, marked by a peculiar conical mountain about 1,500 feet high and a peculiar cup-like armngement of the ridge below it and also by a low rounded knob-like point on the eastern side; this is I'01poise Harbor.· Both sides of the bay are high, and in entering this and all similar localities in the Shumagins navigators should be on their guard against sudden squalls from the mountains, locally known as " woolleys." These are more than suffieiently strong enough to throw down a vessel if care be not exercised. The schooner Vivid was thrown down in this manner during the summer of 1872, at the entrance of Falmouth Harbor, Nagai. Porpt>ise Harbor.*-This is a small aud well-protected harbor for small vessels, but th~ entrance is not over 100 yards wide, and at lowest water has but 9 foot of water off the end ot the

196

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

sand-spit which forms the harbor. It derives its name from the small schooner Porpoise, which wintered there during one season; a :fishing-station having been established there. We obtained a reconnaissance-chart of this harbor, with a few soundings. Sanborn Harbor.*-This harbor deri\'ed its name from the schooner J. D. Sanborn, commanded hy Capt. Wm. Morse, who, driven by a storm, sought shelter in the outer bay, and discovered t-his tiue harbor in May, 1866. There are no hidden dangers in this harbor, unless we except a rocky patch, dry at lowest water, a cable's length from the shore directly opposite the entrance. The anchorage is iu the northern arm of the harbor, in 12 to 14 fathoms shelly mud. Shoaler water may be obtained by going farther in, but the holding-ground is not so good. The Rtream at.1tl1e south end of the habor contains multitudes of salmon and trout. Two low portages, one rendered still more narrow by a large lake, indicate that at no distant period the waters of this harbor may haYe communicated with the sea on the east side of Nagai. As it is, the island is nearly cut in two, or rather in three, at these points. A complete reconnaissance-chart and observations for geographical position were obtained by us. This harbor is constantly in use as a port of refuge by the fishermen. The next indentation of the coast of Nagai to the Emuthwest is a large bayt about five miles in length and two in width. It is surrounded by monntains, but its shores are less precipitous than those of the bay last mentioned. Two-thirds of the way toward its eastern termination are two remarkable spit-formations, one on each shore, and opposite one another. They are both very narrow and hardly raised above the surface of the water. That on the southern shore incloses a sheet of water a mile and a half long and half a mile wide, without a naYigable outlet. The other stops short at its eastern extremity, forming a secure anchorage known as Eagle Harbor.· Be· tween these two spits at the roost contracted point, the water shoals to 4 fathoms. On either side of this bar, there is almudance of water. At the head of the bay is a peculiar conical mountain about 1,500 feet in height and called Bayle Mountain. Eagle Harbor.*'-This is formed by the spit before mentioned and forms a perfectly-protected anchorage with from 7 to 10 fathoms muddy and stony bottom. It is frequently used as a harbor of refuge by the fishermen, who first entered it. A sketch of this harbor, taken from a bird's-e~'e view, assisted by bearings, accompanies this report. Between the southern headland of this bay and the northern head of the next, the western shore of Nagai reaches its most western longitude and greatest altitude. This high precipitous bluff reaches about 2,000 feet above the water, and, from the frequent severe squalls which come down from :t, has received the name of" Woolly Head" from the.fishermen. Several isolated rocks*+ lie off this head about a quarter of a mile from shore, with deep water close to them, and elevated about 10 or 12 feet abo,·e the tide. South of ·woolly Head about two miles, lies the north headland of another bayt without a name. A few rocks lie off this headland close inshore, ril:ling 10 to 20 feet above the water. Half a cable's length outside of them is another rock awash, marked by kelp and a breaker. This is about a quarter of a mile from shore. Southwest by west from the southern head of the bay, a reef extends a quarter of a mile with a single rock three-quarters of a mile from shore in the same direction. This rock*t is awash. bare at low witter, marked by kelp and a breaker. ' The northern headland rises some 500 feet in a perpendicular cliff. The southern one rises much more gradually, and is low, at the water's edge reaching 25 feet or more. The north shore of the bay is rocky and bold. A single rock,*! 5 feet above the water, stands about a quarter of a mile from shore a mile and a quarter west of the north headland. South (true) from this rock, on the southern shore, is a low point, with a rock close to it known as Cape Horn* among the nsherrneu. East of this, the bay widens a little and ends with a triangular spit, rounded at its southern end, and composed of coarse shingle and rounded boulders. .A large amount of drift-wood lies here. · Falmouth Harbor.*-Behind this spit lies Falmouth Harbor, so named from a vessel driven by a gale into the bay, which first entered it. The entrance is not over 300 yards wide, and con· tains no hidden dangers. It carries 6 fathoms in, behind the spit expanding into a sheet of water ~bout. b.alf a mile a.cross, Here 7 and 8 fathoms sandy bottom may be obtained. The northern

shores are broad, sand flats, which drop suddenly to 4: fathoms. The harbor is perfectly protected from all winds, but there is room only for one vessel, and she must haYe a fair wind to enter and go out. At the head of the harbor jg a stream, coming from a good-sized lake, full ~f salmon and trout. Good water may be obtained here. A fishing-station was established here iu 187~. The land surrounding the bay and harbor is high and broken, some of the hills reaching 1,500 feet. The entire bay is abont five miles long. There are no bidden dangers known. A sketch of this bay and harbor, from a bird's-eye view, aided by bearings, accompanies tllis report. To the south of the south headland of this bay, the shore of this island trends to the soiitheast some seven miles, to a low point without a name. Off this point lies a small rounded rocky islandt rising to the height of 300 or 4:00 feet. This portion of the coast bas never been carefullv examined, as far as I am aware. I observed from oft' shore that that portion of the island of Nag~i to the southward of this small island is composed of two clusters of rocky hills perhaps 1,000 feet in height, united to each other and to the main bods of tile island by low fiat isthmus<'s, evidently remains of raised beaclles like those on the northern portion of the island. A view of the southwestern shore of Nagai accompanies this report. Off the south cape, which is 500 or 600 feet high, a reef marked by a breaker extends southward for three-quarters of a mile. The east coast of Nagai is exceedingly irregtdar, aud tlie greater part of it bas never been correctly determined. Just soutb of the elevated northern end of the island before mentioned, a bigbt makes in toward the low isthmus before described. Iu this bight is a very small, low, rocky islet.·t To the south of this bight is a deep, pointed bay,*t extending to the westward and southward, which hAA never been entered. The land around it is high and broken. South of the south headland the laud trends in a nearly south direction until we arth-e at a deep bay having two arms, which we have called in our notes the East Bight of Nagai." The north arm is open to the eastward, bas high, rocky shores, aud occasional high, steep, shingle-beaches, and terminates to the westward at a long beach of boulders and shingle, behind which is a large lake, the opposite shore of which is separated by a very low portage from Sanboru Harbor. To the northwest of this lake is a high, conical mountain, over 2,000 feet, in a.ltitude, forming tlle eud of a long ridge, an<l called in our notes Mount Peirce. South of the lake, the promontory <lidding the bay into two arms, is a rounded mountain, 1,500 feet in height, called by us 1Jiou11t llilgard. A high ridge· terminating in a precipitous cliff of 1,000 or 1,200 feet, which forms the southern headland of tlie height, we named Mount l>am~dson. The south arm of the bjght ends to the westward in a narrow· pointed inlet, nearly reaching the middle of Sanborn Harbor, from which it is divided by a low portage, half a mile wide, but really dirniaished to about half that whlth by a shallow lagoon making in from Sanborn Harbor. On the south shore ot' the south arm is a new harhor.·t This appears to he a diS(}overy of our own, as I could find no one who had heard of it before. It is formed by the usual shingle-spit, which ineloses it on the east and nortb. It appears to ha,-e an abundance of water, though we had no means of sounding, as we did not take the vessel in there, but ran the shore-lines by crossing the portages from Sanborn Harbor. The shores are gravelly. From the north side of the spit, shoals, marked by kelp, extend northward about a quarter of a mile, and a narrower shoal fringes the southeast foot of Mount Hilgard on the opposite side of the entrance. This harbor has perfect protection from all winds, room enough for three or four vessels, and can be entered or left with any wind. It is also the only harbor on the east side of the islalld. South of Mount Davidson, a broad granite promontory, with a valley in the middle, extends for a mile or two, and is sncceeded by a shallow bay,*t with a broad sand-b~acb, having a lagoon behind it, and a portage (over a low ridge to the south end of Sanborn Harbor) about two miles wide. There is a small peninsula on the south side of this bay, composed of a rocky islet unitetl by a low sand-beach to Na,gai, which might afford shelter for boats; but the hay is very shoal and has. several rocks above water in the middle of.it, on which we observed sea-otters. The bottom is sandy, a.nd the depth of water less than a fathom at low tide. South of the capet forming the south headland of this bay is the low isthmus before referred to, which connects the main body of the island with a cluster of broken hill~, which is sacceeded by another isthmus connecting the latter with the elevated southern end of the island.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The straiti betweeu Big Koniushi Island and Nagai is deep, with au irregular, rocky bottom.
It is crammed with islands, none of which are on the charts, and between which plenty of water

seems to exist. After leaYing the northern isthmus of Nagai, we have on the east side of the strait a new island.*+ It reaches 800 feet in height, two miles in length, and a mile and a half in width. From its southeastern end a spit, succeeded by a long shoal trends toward the nearest cape of Big Koniushi. There appeared to be a clear passage between. the end of this shoal and Koniuslii of a mile in width. On the west side of tlie strait, a little to the southward, is another new 'island.*t It is of oblong form, in a north and south direction, and divided by two transverse depressions into th.ree elevated portions. Length about a mile and a half, height about 500 feet. Off its southwestern end, and apparently connected with it by a shoal, is a small, rounded islet, an eighth of a mile long, and very low. Immediately to the south of the last mentioned is another new island*+ of about the same size, but more irregular in shape and not quite so high. A series of reefs extends from the south and southwest edges of this island, apparently about a quarter of a mile from the shore. This lies directly opposite the east bight of Nagai, three or four miles from the south headland of the latter. A view of it, taken from :Mount Hilgard, accompanies this report. Spectacle Island.*-Directly in mid-channel, between Nagai at .Mount Davidson and the sJuthern end of Big Koniushi, lies a large islat1d not on any chart, aud known by the foregoing name among tlie :fishermen, as its northern and southern portions are connected by a comparaHvely low ritlge. The length of this island is about five miles, and it maJ' be two miles wide iu some places. The highest; peak may reach the height of 1,000 feet or less. Close in to the southern end lie a few rocks. On the southwest side the.re appears to be a cove where boats might find shelter. The shores are bold and the beaches narrow. \Ve saw no signs of any outlying dangers. Twin Rocks.·-To the south and west of the last named, bearing south 37° east about 6 miles from Mount Hilgard station, lie two rocky islets not on the charts, and known by the above name. No reefs or breakers being visible about them in heavy weather, it is presumed tbat there are no outlying dangers. They appear to be from 60 to 100 feet in height, and an eighth of a mile long in their greatest diameter. The southwestern rock is much narrower than the other, and they appear to be separated only by a narrow chasm. Their sides are precipitous and apparently devoid of vegetatiou. A Yiew of them as seen from Mount Hilgard is herewith forwarded. Near Island, (Blizbni Island of the Russians.)-This island lies about two miles east of the northern of the two isthmuses on the southern end of Nagai. It is about two mileg long and about the same in width, appearing about 600 feet high. The sides are precipitous and rocky. The island is easily recognized by a very regular serration, which cuts its crest into :five little peaks. Castle Rock.*-A large rocky island lying off the north end of Big Koniushi, about five miles, is so denominated by the fishermen. It is of rounded shape, high and broken, with precipitous sides. The northern and highest peak may reach an altitude of 1,200 feet. It is about a. mile and a half in diameter, and no outlying dangers are reported. It is so prominent that it is a matter of surprise that it has not found its way on to the charts. Big Kon,iushi Island.-This island bears no resemblance to that which represents it on the charts. Its northern end is pointed and comparatively low. Its western shore is very irregular, and its most salient feature is a peninsula which is high and rounded, projecting between two bays and connected with the main body of the island by a high but narrow isthmus. South of this peninsula·, a safe ancltpra.ge*t is reported by the fishermen in 8 fathoms sandy bottom. It is more or less open, however, to southwest winds. The whole of this side of the island is rocky, precipitous, and broken, and of the most desolate character, being absolutely destitute of any vegetation except lichens. At the southern end is a long and narrow point connected with the island by a very high and narrow ridge. :From some points of view it resembles an island, and has been laid down as one by Tebenkoff. The native name is Kungagingan. :Behind this point to the eastward is a deep bay,·t but the water is reported to be so bold as to afford no anchorage. East of this bay is another,·t larger and wider, in which vessels have anchored in 16fathoms hard bottom, with probiction from northerly and westerly winds. · The holding-ground is poor. To the east of this the

island, always high and rocky, trends to the northeast until it forms a headland, which is the east head of Koniushi Strait. A small rocky islet.*t lies close to this shore, half.way from the bay just mentioned to the strait. · North of this strait is a shallow bay *t, the mouth of which i8 reported to be nearly closetl by two small islands *t forming a secure anchorage'*' in westerly weather. To the northward the island trends to the northwest, forming a capc,·t between which and the northern end of tlle island is another bay,*t in which the fishing-vessels are said to anchor in southerly gales, finding good pro· tection in 7 to 10 fathoms water. The soundings to the northeast of this part of the island, aud southeast of Castle Rock, are reported to be very even, averaging 28 fathoms, and afford good fishing. The island of Big Koniushi is one of the most rugged of the group, and the average height of the peaks may be 1,500 to 2,000 feet. Koniushi St-rait.-This strait is much narrower than represented 011 the charts. It will exceed a mile and a half in width, and the soundings reported are 16, 20, and 28 fathoms. Little Koniuslii Island.-This island also differs entirely in outline from anything on the charts. it is really composed of three islands united by raised sand-beaches, intersected by lagoo118. The shape is very irregular. The western coast trends somewhat to the west of north. The southern end t.erminates in a high rocky, pointed cape,*t with a reef, marked by a breaker, extending abont a quarter of a mile southwest from it. The eastern coast is indented !Jy t"°o bays,t of which the northern one is much the widest tmd deepest. Off the northeast cape of Little Koniushi, and connected with it by a shoal half a mile long, is Atkins Island,* so named after the schooner Minnie G. Atkins, whose commander first discovered the fishing-grounds about it. This is an ornl and rather high island, about two miles and a half long, ancl reaching an altitllde of about 800 feet, but with a coinparati,·ely even surface and slope from the central crest. The northern coast of Little Koniushi extends in a nearly due east direction from Atkins Islaml to Koninshi Strait, indented midway by a bay,*t off which lies a triangular islaml.*t Behind this island is situated the so-called Northwest Harbor"' of the fishermen. This may be entered from either end, and affords good holding-ground and ample protection from all except northeast winds. .At one time a fishing-station was establishe!i here. w·e did not visit this locality. On the west side of Little Koniushi is an opening two miles wide into a large bay which divides into two arms, and is known as Northeast Harbor.* The northern arm of this bay is somewhat open to westerly winds, and the holding-ground is said to be rocky and poor. The extreme southern end of the eastern arm is more protected, and for some reason is a favorite refuge for the fishermen, though the bottom, being alternate patches of rock and sand, does not afford a good bold for the anchor:;:. There is a ismall and well-protected boat-harbor here, where a :fishing-station was formerly established. Astronomical observatious were obtained here, and a series of angles, bearings, and other observations sufficient to make up a tolerably accurate sketch of the harbor, herewith forwarded. The mountains on this island reach a height of 11000 to 1,500 feet. They are of solid granit<', and the whole aspect of the island is barren and desolate. Twelve-Fat/tom Straits.-The straits separating Little Koniushi and Simeouoff Island:-. are known by the above name among the fishermen. The depth averages from 12 to 16 fathoms. With the exception of a few patches of kelp near Simeonoff Island we saw no signs of any dangers. ,, Simdmoff Island, (Simeonoff.sky of ti.le Russifl.ns; Tiakinak of Tehenkoff.)-This is the most eastern of the gi:oup and a very peculiar island. It is composed of two clusters of hills, surrounded and connected by a low, nearly level, plateau, composed of decomposed granite and sand. This plateau is nearly cut in two by a very irregularly.shaped harbor.*t A glance at the accompanying sketch of this island will ~onvey a bett.er idea of its peculiarities than a detailed description. About five-eighths of a mile from shore is a kelp-patch off the northern point of the island, which probably marks a submerged cluster of rocks. A reef extends half a mile in a westerly direction from the north point of the entrance of the harbor. Off the south point is a. low, fiat, rocky island,*t fringed with reefs. The whole coast of Simeonoff is bristling with reefs and shoals. Those from the south end of the island are variously reported to extend from three to seven miles off shore. Tliree miles off shore to the ea.st of

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDE:NT OF

the island, a series of reefs parallel to the latter are reported with a clear passage between the island and the reefs. The harbor·+ is perfectly protected from all winds, but the shores are rocky and the water very shoal. The inner anchorage is in 2~ fathoms, not exceeding 2, at lowest water, with a smooth gravelly bottom. This harbor is a favorite hunting-ground for sea-otters. There is plenty of drift-wood on the eastern shore, bnt the water is poor. The hills on the northern end may be 800 feet high, those to the south perhaps 1,000 feet. Bird Island, (Petitski of the Russians.)-This is situated nearly south of Big Koniushi. Its shores are bold; there are no bays or harbors upon it. Tbe island is comparatively low, thougb its surface is broken. None of the hills much exceed 600 feet in height. No outlying clangers ~re reported. A rock abo>e water lies off the southern end a short distance. · Chernobour Island, (Niuniak of Tebenkoff.)-This in most respects resembles the last, but is narrower and longer. It lies to the southwarcl and eastward of Bird Island, and is the most southern island of the group. A rocky islet apparently connected by a bar with the main island lies off its northern end. On the east coast are three small bays, the middle one of which is reported to afford an anchorage in westerly winds. As we saw this island and the last only from a distance, I can give but few details in regard to them. With regard to the meteorological features of these islands, it may be remarked that the win· ter is rather colder than at Unalashka, owing to the winds which blow directly from the ice·coYered mountains of the peninsula. From 11lay to the middle of August, cloudy, overcast weather may be expected, with some rain, but little fog, and not much wind. After that time there is more clear weather, but attended with strong gales from the north and east. In winter, the succession of gales is hardly interrupted by an occasional }lleasant day. We obtained the first :flowers of the season in the early part of April, and the spring as a rule is early, and the growth of vegetation on the Western Shumagins is rapid and luxuriant.

On our passage from Simeonoff Island to Kadiak, Thursday, September 5, 1872, the weather being clear and calm, we sounded at noon, the water being discolored, and, much to our surprise, found but· 22~ fathoms, gravelly bottom. v;r e immediately put over some lines and obtainetl a number of fine cod, and some halibut weighing over 100 pounds. The approximate position of this bank is latitude 560 13' north, longitude 1530 391 west. The soundings continued without material change all the afternoon, the course being northeast by compass. At 6 p. m. we got 38 fathoms, and at 8.30 the next morning we obtained 60 fathoms. We had run by Massey's log during that time about thirty miles. The wind shortly afterward rising, we obtained no further soundings, but the w~ter resumed its normal hue. I may also note that at 8 a. m. this morning, (September 6,) we were able to see distinctly the Semidi Islands, U gamok, aud Cape Granville 011 Kadiak. If the reported island of Saint Stephen bad also existed, we could hardly ha\·e failed to see it. Dy our observations, the latitude of the island of Ugamok is more correctly given on the Russian Admiralty Charts of 1847 than in the later maps. The longitude of the latter, however, seems tlle most correct, though the topography of the ohl map is far the best. The Semidi Islands agreed in their bearings with the latitude given on the charts, but their extreme visibility would seem to indicate a more eastern longitude. We saw no breakers on the Vasilieff(William's) or Kadiak reefs at Saint Paul, though there was a heavy sea on when we entered and at the time of our departure. MISCELLANEOUS HYDROGRAPHIC NOTES. 'l:be following notes have been collected during the voyage and are hem appended. Even if they possess no other value, they will serve to call attention to existing doubts on the points in question. I. Archimandritoff calls attention to some rocks whfoh he states exist abreast of the Gull Rocks (Chika ostrova) in the Akutan Pass. We saw and heard nothing further in reganl to any such rocks, though they probably exist.

II. He also notes the reef off Cape Kalekhta, which he says extends half a mile off shore. \Y c saw this reef breaking on one occasiou, but had uo opportunity of fixing its position. Ill. He also reports that the island of Tanaga, or the one next west of it, is crroueou;;ly located on Tebcnkofl's chart, as the bearings there giYen do not connect. l V. Also that Amukhta l'ass, which is mapped by Tebenkoft' as thirty-six miles wide, is really forty-six miles wide, but cannot state where the error lies. Also that Buld,yr is ten miles south of TebenkofPs position for it. V. He also states, from information derh·ed from tile uati\·es, that there is a good harbor on Semisopochnoi (Seven Volcano) Island; but E. Hennig states that it is a Yery poor harbor, and that the pasi,;age leading to it is rocky, with dangerous tide-rips. VI. Capt. E. Hennig states (iu regard to the reef commonly reported to extend from the northeast end of Urnnak to Bogosloft' Island) that while there is a short reef extending from l;rnuak, a quarter of a mile or so, the supposed continuous reef does not exist, as he bas passed close to both islands in good weather, and could find no bottom with two cod-liues, (58 fathoms.) VII. Captain May, of the bark Uyane, haYiug reported some unknown rocks near the Sburnagim1, I matle the following copy of his log: ''Ship Crnsarewitch, June 25, 18G9. Point of fleparturc, Uheruobour Island, bore northwest by north, by compass, (noon,) about 2.J miles. Latitude, by obserrntiou, 54° 2:Y north; longitude, 159° 21' west. Course, northeast." June 2u, 1869, (begins at noon of 2."ith.) " Began fresh breeze from southwest. Later, (G p. m.,) wind moderate, hazy." (No estimate of distance run is given in the log.) "8.30 p. m. :;.\lade two rocks above water, bearing northwest by compass, distance about eight miles. Changed course to southeast. Estimated position, latitude, 5fiC J[i' north; longitude, 1580 50'.'' Captain :May reports that the rocks were 30 feet high, and that he sa,w breakers before be changed the course. This latitude is evideutly a clerical error, as it was impossil>le for the vessel tu have been in latitude 550 15' under the circumstances. Archimand1·itoff, from information received from Captaiu ::Vfay directly after the occurrence, estimated the position at latitude, 54P 4!J'; and longitude, 157° 38'. I cannot explain the discrepancies, hut Archimandritoff'i;; position would seem the most probable from the courses and probalJle distance run. In this case, it would bring these rocks on or near the outer fishing-ground, where it is in the highest degre& improbable that such rocks could exist and not have been seen by fishermen. I am or the opinion that Captain May saw two fishingYessels at anchor on the outer ground, though he is quite positive that they were rocks. VlII. We visitetl Delaroff Harbor in boats on the 4th of Julj", 1872, and found that the greatest depth of water in the inner anchorage is 9 feet at low water, with room 0111.r for one vessel of the smallest class. This place is full of rocks and shoals, and the Hussian chart is extremely inaccurate. ·whether the shoal water (now existing where the chart gh·es more) is due to the action of an earthquake or not, I am unable to state; it was so reported to me b,r Capt. Charles Riedell, iu 1868. IX. Captain Giles, of the sloop ,Jahez Howes, who had wintered at Isanotsky, or False Pass, gave me the following notes in regard to that locality. The southern entrance of this pass though narrow is extremely deep, no bottom haYing been reached at 50 fathoms. There are a few rocks close in to the East Head. The tides run wry swiftly in this passage. The flood tide (from the south) is much more powerful than the ebb. 'rhe tides resemble those of Unalashka, but the flood does not meet with sufficieut resistance from the north. to cre:.ite tide-rips. The northern entrance is very shoal. The channel is close to the Unimak shore, and is often changed and (when heavy northers occur) even silted up by the shifting sand which forms the bottom. There is about one fathom wat.er in it. The Jabez Howes, drawing 4 feet 2 inches and the Lizzie Sha drawing 3 feet 6 inches, had gone through, but he did not think the Humboldt, drawing 8 feet, ~uld get through even at high water. This explains the inability of Captain Smith to find even a boat-channel through, in 1868, as reported to me. X. A bay without a name is laid down on Tebenkofi's chart, on the northeast end of Akhuu Island, facing Unimak Pass. Approximate latitude 54° 17' north and longitude 165° 33' wei;t.

H-EPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

'rhe entrance is represented by Tebenkoff as shoal or closed by a barrier of sand. Capt. E. E. 8mith, an old whaler, of the schooner Eustace, reported to me that he anchored near the mouth of this bay in June, 187'.!, and Raw !>'·er a sand-spit finback-whales spouting and playing in great numbers. Now, this species of whale does not go into very shallow water, and I am of the opin· ion (and several wlialers wliom I liave consulted agrpe with me) that there must be a cornpara· ti\·ely deep channel by wliich these whales entered; and that heiog the case, a good harbor would exist here. If so, it won Id be of great importance to traders aud whalers bound out of Beriug Sea, as they are frequently delayed 8everal tfays (as I have been) at the mouth of tbe Unimak Pass, a.waiting an opportunity of getting through. I eudea\·on~cl to reach this locality in June, 1872, lmt was prevented by bad weatber. XL The narrow pm;s betweeu Aklmu and Akutan is repre8enteu as full of rocks and unnavigable ll_y Tebenkoff. It is in no case to be attempted, as tbe tides rnsh tlirough with great fury; but in the fall of 1871, the natives reported tbat a large whale-ship was drh-en by storms into Akhun Ba,y and passed tlirough this opening iu safety to the Pacific, greatly to their surprise, as eyery one expected to see her tfasbed to pieces on the rocky shores. ,

The temperatures of air and water were taken at the same time and with the same instrument. The day begins with noon and ends with the next noon, as in nautical time. The dead reckoning bas not been taken directly from the log-book, where it runs on uncorrected for the whole voyage, but has been recomputed each day, from the last preceding position, by observation; in most cases that of the previons noon. The distance is by dead reckoning, and shows the distance of each point of temperature-observation from the starting-point of the day. The rate and direction of the currents are really only approximate, and represent the mean rate and clire<'tion of all tlie currenti; passed through during the day or since the last observatien.

APPENDIX ::\ o. 11.
VOYAGE OF THE STEAMER HASSLER FROM BOSTON TO SAN FRANCISCO. DY L. F. POcRTALES, ESQ., ASSISTANT IN THE UNITED STATES COAST SURYEY.

On the afternoon of the 4tlt of December, the Hassler left the Charlestown navy-yard, and steamed down the barhor. After passing Boston light, the weather compelled her to return, and anchor for a few hours in Nantasket Roads, but the next <lay she ran around Cape Cod and anchored in Vineyard Haven in company with a large fleet of weather-bound coasters. Here she was compelled to remain until the 7th, the weather being stormy and very cohl. Tile delay garn a good opportunity to improve the storage of the numerous boxes of apparatus, &c., put 011 board at the last moment. A final start was made in the afternoon, the pilot discharged at Tarpaulin Co\·e, and a course taken for Saint Thomas. After leaving Yine~·ard Sound, a series of hourly obserYations of surface-temperature and density of tbe water was institntlld 1 and kept up by Messrs. Pour. tales, Steindacbner, White, and Blake, each taking a watch. The course lying almost at right angles to the Gulf Stream, the observations ga>e its northern ec.lge with considerable accuracy, but at a distance of nearly forty miles farther south than the Coast Survey chart intlicates. This being only the edge of the superficial warm stratum overflowiug the cold water of the so-called polar stream, it is not surprising that its position may vary considerably with the seasons and the prevailing winds. The main body of the stream still extending to considerable depth in this latitude 1 there is no probabilit.;r of its being affected by these influences; but we ha,·e no observations yet on the subject. On t1Je 10th, the cold weather had been definitely left behiml ; and, on the following days, the sea was remarkabl;f calm, and the weather very pleasant. The opportunity was improved by Professor Agassiz for collecting Gulf weed and studying its inhabitauts, mid by Lieutenaut Kennedy and l\lr. Pourtales in measuring and marking deep-sea lines, mounting dredges, &c. It is a subject of regret that the instructions co11templaled no deep-sea researches prior to reael1iug Saint Thomas, as this locality would have iuesented a very favorable ground; the weather hei n g all that could be wished, and the ocean being supposed to lm of >er:y considerable dcvth iu this region. The missing of this opporttmit,r was felt the more afterward, wben the chances for thil' ldnd of researches grew less and less during the progress of the voyage. On the 14th, the bigh mountains of Porto Rico hove in sight; and, on the 15til, the ship anchored in Saint Thomas, having first bee11 threatened with quarantine on am~ount of exaggerated reports of small-pox: in the United States. It was, however, remitted by Governor Bille on the r~presenta tion of Professor .Agassiz. T11e ship remained in Saint Thomas until tlie !!!!d; some repai1·s having been found necessary. During that time considerable collections of natural history were made by Professor .Agassiz and Dr. Steindacbner, and various points of interest visited on the island. During the stay of the Hassler int.he harbor, courtesies were extended to the officrrs and tile sci· entific party by Goveruor Bille, formerly Danish minister in Washington. On the 22d, the ship left Saint Thomas. In act·ordance with the instructions of the Superiute11de11t, it bad been intended to test all tbe deep-sea apparatus between Saint Thomas and Santa Cruz, where the depth is known to be more than 2,000 fathoms. Very interesting results were anticipated, besides tho useful practice to be acquired by the officers and men in the use of the instruments. Unfortunately, after leaving the harbor, the trade-wind was found to blow with great vioience, raising quit-0 a rough sea, so that operations had to be deferre<l until evening, when under

the lee of the island of Santa Cruz. It was too late to do more than run out a little more than a thousand fathoms of line to stretch it, andi night coming on, the anchor was cast off the town of lfrederickstadt. The next morning a few casts of the lead were taken, to test the indicators; but, although the sea was comparatively smootli_, tlie wind blew so fresh that the ship drifted away from the lead too rapidls for good work, and particularly for determiuing iustrumental corrections. No attempt was made to dredge for the same reason. Experiments were made by Lieutenant Day, at the same time as the soundings, with l\Ir. l\Iorse's apparatus for sounding without line. This consists in a tin cylinder with pointed ends, containing hollow glass halls as fioats, tested to resist a great pressure. The whole is carried down by a weight, which detaches on touching tlle bottom, allowing the cylinder to rise to the surface again. The depth is recorded by a peculiar arrangement, registering the pressure. In this case, (and iu every subsequent experiment,) the weight was detached at only a short <listauce below the surface, from some cause not easily explained, when, of course, the :float immediately rose to the surface agaiu. The Hassler continued on her way against a heavy head sea, passing iu sight, and between the islands, of Montserrat and Guadaloupe. On the 26th, the air-yessel of the donkey-pump burst; and, as it could not be repaired on board, it was deemec1 prudent to bear up for Barbadoes, when anchor was cast the same evening in the harbor of Bridgetown. The goveru01·, Mr. Rawson W. Uawson, showed much interest in the Hassler's researches in natural history, being himself a distinguishetl conchologist, and possessing a valuable collection of ·west India shells and corals. The repairs being finished, the aftemoon of the 29th and the greater part of tlie 30th were employed in dredging off the coast a few mHes north of the harbor; GoYernor Rawson being a guest on board during that time. The harvest was the richest obtained in dredging during the voyage, as well in quantity as in the great variety of the objects brought to light. Many forms heretofore unknown were obtained, and, what is perhaps of equal or greater interest, SC'\Cral animals found in the deep-sea researches of previous years, in the waters of Florida, of the British isles, and even of Norway, but in those localities generally in much greater depths. The Asthenosoma, a soft-shelled sea urchin, and the Rltizoorinus may be mentioned as striking examples; more will probably be found when the collection is critically examined. A great rarity was a fine, living specimen of Plenrotomar-ia, of which only one other is known to exist in collections. On the evening of the 30th, after landing the governor, and Dr. :Martin, who, from increasing trouble in bis eyes, was reluctantly compelled to girn up the voyage anu return home, the voyage was resumed. The course was almost directly against the trade.winds, which, raising a very disagreeable sea, and accompanied by occasional rain-squalls, rendered this part of the voyage exceedingly disagreeable. The motion of the ship was so considerable (the pendulum recording sometimes as high as 4'.! 0 for the rolling) that sea-sickness, or, at least, great discomfort, was \"'ery prevalent, and anything like study or research out of the question. This lasted more or less until the 15th of January, when, the coals running rather short, it was deemed prudent to touch at Pernamlmco for a small supply. The United States steamer Ticonderoga was anchored in the roadstead. Tbe Hassler went inside of the remarkable reef forming the natural breakwater of the harbor, but, on account of the prevalence of the yellow fever among the shipping, very little com· munication was had with the shore. The ship was visited hy the United States consul and bis family and a few other persons. On the 16th, having finished coaling and watering, the Hassler sailed for Rio Janeiro. On the 17t11, in latitude 9° 45' south, a fow casts of the lead were taken to obtain the corrections of the indicators. The temperatures obtained at the same time were 800,5 at the surface, 670 at 100 fatl1oms, 44-0.5 at 485 fathoms, and 420.5 at 556 fathoms. On the 18th, in latitude 11° 49' south, soundings were taken at different distances from shore. Iu Gl3 fathoms, the temperature was found to be 390; surface, soo.3; in 12 fathoms, nearer shore, 800. Several casts of the dredge were taken in depths varying from 12 to 20() fathoms, with moderate success. On the 20th, off the Abrotbos, the most extensive coral reefs on the coast of South America, several casts of the dredge were taken in 20 to 44 fathoms, (temperature at 30 fathoms, 720.) The harvest was not very rich, though interesting.

On the 22d, in the neighborhood of Cape Frio, in 35 to 45 fathoms, a quantity of concretions formed by Bryozoa., about the size and shape of potatoes, were obtained by the dredge; also a few corals and shells. Early on the morning of the 23d, the Hassler entered the magnificent bay of Rio Janeiro, favored by a clear atmosphere, through which the Sugar Loaf, the Oorcovado, aml the Tijuca shon~ in their full splendor in the morning sun, with the city stretching along the water at their foot while in the distance tlrn picturesque Organ Mountains receded in the hazy distance. ' The SL'1y in Rio was prol&ged to the 15th of February, on acconnt of necessary repairs and alterations, the most important of which were the removal of a fender running around the hull, under which numerous leaks allowed the water to penetrate in hea\·y weatl1er, and the calking of the de~k. A very unfortunate incident was the flooding of the hold from a water-cock being left open by neglect or mischief in the fire-room. There is no doubt that tlle stock of dredging-line stowed below was damaged by it, and caused the failure of the subsef1uent attempts at dredging in great depths. Excursions were made hy members of the scientific corps and such of the officers as could be spared from tlleir duties to Tijuca, Petropolis, and other places of interest. B,y invitation of l\Ir_ Ellison, superil1tendent of tLe Dou Pedro II Hailroad, an excursion was made across the mountains to the end of the railroad, and from there, by the kindness of l\Ir. Morrett, superintendent of the turnpike and stage company Union y Industria, to .Juiz de Fora, ancl back through Petrnpolis. The two gentlemen mentionefl accompanied the party throughout tile trip, aml, by tlleir thorough knowledge of the country, rendered it as iustructi\·e as it was pleasant. The season being millsummer in the sout,hern hemisphere, the heat was generally excessive during the day, tempered on boaru ship by the sea-breeze, which could not be felt in tlrn streets of the city. Leaving on the Hitb, the plan was to nm a line of sonmlings and dredgings off the coast. But it was found to he bl-0wing too fresh for the purpose, and the wind during the day increased to a heavy gale, which compelled Captain ,Johnson to lie to the greater part of the next twenty.four hours. The ship behaved well un<ler the circumstances, thollgh the motion was rather too li\·ely for comfort. On the 20th, the sea was calm enough to allow or a cast of the dredge, in latitude 320 south, in 70 fathoms, aud bottom of soft mud. The results were not of particular interest. Another heavy gale was encountered on the 21st. On the 2::w, several casts of the dredge were taken in 19 fathoms, 11ear the entrance of the Rio de la l:'lata., with good results. On the 23d, in the morning, the Hassler anchored in l\fontevideo, and was immetliately put in quarantine, although ba,·ing a clean hill of health from Rio Janeiro. The effort8 of Admiral Lan~ man, United States Navs, commanding the Sonth Atlantic squallrou, antl of the United States consul, proved nnaYailing to have pratique exte11dc1l; the fearfnl ravages of the yellow fever at Buenos Ayres a ~·ear or two before baving rendered the authorities timorous and o\·ercautious. Having misunderstood the terms of a relaxation of tbe rules allowing a landing to be made in a sparsely-inhabited neighborhood for scientific purposes, Professor Agassiz, accompankd by Mr. Pourtales and Lieutenant Kennedy, visited the Cerro, the only hi.11 interrupting the monotony of the surrounding plains, situated on the north side of tlw harbor. Here plain, though not abundant, proofs of glacial action were rlisco\'ered in the shape of small granite and quartzite bowlders, lying over the slate composing the hill. The object of the excursion was fully accomplished, when the whole party was arrested by the police for breach of quarantine, and marclied to the guardhouse. The matter having been explained to the commissary by Lieute11ant Kennedy, they were immediately released, on condition of sinning no more. At the expiration of the quarantine, which was aggravated by disagreeable weather, the ship went into the inner harbor for a few hours to take in a further suppJy of coal, and sailed on the 28th. Several casts of the dredge were made on t~e follqwing days with interesting results, all inside of 50 fathoms. On the 4th of March, the sb1!> entered San Matias Bay, on the coast of Patagonia, passing close along the remarkable bluff8 of bonzonta.Uy.stratified clays and sandstones, and anchored at night off Oliff End. The next morning, an exploring party went ashore: some were employed in hauling the seiue, obtaining by its means a large collection of ft.shes; while others ascended the bluffs, collecting fossils in their strata. The most remarkable were an oyst~r of monstrous dimensions, found in great abundance, and a fiat sea-

urchin, (Monc;phora.) The bluffs formed the border of extensive rolling plains, very arid, with a scanty vegetation of scrubby and thorny bushes. After a few hours' delay at this place, the anchorage being rather exposed, the anchor was weighed, and better shelter obtained at the head of the bay, in the well-protected harbor of San Antonio. Here the bluffs had disappeared, the land being but moderately elevated, and intersected by numerous creeks. The following morning, parties scattered in different directions to collect specimens of natural history. A party crossed to the westem shore of the harbor, where a large creek opened into it, and followed its shores for a considerable distance in a vain attempt to reach the bills beyond; The country was found to he entirely without fresh water; no traces of even the passage of human beings or domestic anim,als were found; and the usual animals of Patagonia, the guanaco, the cavia, aud the ostrich, were far from abundant. On the shores, however, wading-birds were found in great numbers-a tide of nearly thirty feet offc1'ing them a vast extent of feeding-ground at low water. In the evening, the ship stood out of the bay, and experienced during the night a severe hail-storm. During the following days, some interesting casts of the dredge were obtained, always iu very moderate depths, when the rather variable weather permitted. During a heavy squall on Marcil 7, the engine was damaged by the breaking of the governor-Yalve, but was repaired by the engineers, the steamer being ho>e to on the next day for the purpose. On the 9th, occasional patches or rafts of floating kelp were passed. On the morning of the 13th, Cape Virgin, at the entrance to the Strait of Magellan, was sighted, forming a heal.lland of bluffs, apparently similar to those visited in San Matias Bay. They rose to a considerable height at Cape Possession, which was passed shortly afterward. At night, the anchor was cast off Tandy Point, in Possession l3a.y. The singular appearance of tl.Je mountains known as )fount Aymon and the Asses' Ears, distant about eight miles from the shore and breaking the uniformity of the Patagonian plains, formed au inducement for an effort to visit them, particularly as they woulcl be more likely to afford au opportunity for the observation of ancient glacial phenomena. So, while Professor Agassiz reserved for personal examination the more accessible parts of the neighborhood, a party, consisting of Messrs. Kennedy, Ponrtales, Mansfield, ~White, and Dee, with two sailors, st~rted at daybreak for the interior. Tbe path led over the usual Patagonian desert, here almost entirely destitute of bushes; the country ha-ving been apparently swept by fl re at frequent intervals. The surface was undulating, varied by hills and valleys of moderate elevation or depth, seldom abrupt; the valleys presenting the usual appearances of having been excavated by running water, such being a regular incline toward the sea, affiuen ts, &c., but nowhere could any trace be seen of recent effects of waters; there were no gullies, no fresh sand-bars; on the contrary, the sward, scanty to be sure, but certainly ancient, covered hill and dale with-perfect uniformity. In a few depressions, shallow ponds or puddles were seen. One of them, near the sea, but elevated at least 100 feet above it, was f9und by Professor Agassiz to be salt, and contained living sea-mollusks, a proof of the elevation of the land at no very remote date. Another more elevated puddle was found by one of the party to be fresh, but so shallow and so trampled by animals that he could not procure any water for drinking. The whole surface of the country was found to be covered with glacial drift; bowlders three or four feet in diameter were not rare. Guanacoes were seen in abundance; also a few ostriches. The mountains were reached after a fatiguing walk, and found to be volcanic cones, of no great age, with well-formed craters, elevatetl some two to three hundred feet above the surrounding plain. They had evidently pierced th rough tbe drift, and covered it with their streams of lava. From the summit of Mouut Aymon, which appears ' to be the easternmost of the chain, a large number of similar volcanoes were seen, extending in an irregular chain to the westward. No sign of the }llace having been visited before could be found. A record was left in a bottle on the summit, covered by a cairn of blocks of lava. The same chain has been observed farther west by Commander Masters, Royal Navy, during bis extended trip through Patagonia. The party reached the shore after sunset, almost exhausted for want of water, a want felt particularly severe on account of the dryness of the atmosphere. Professor Agassiz bad been quite successful in his explorations, having found abundant traces of glacial action. v aina.ble additions were made to the collections at this place; among them a fine gnana.co killed by Mr. Kennedy. On the 15th, favored by very fine weather, the passage of the First and Second Narrows was made, taking advantage of the powerful tidal current sweeping through them. In the afternoon,

At tb,at height, the thickness of the ice, as seen in the expo13cd side of tile glacier, was estimated at about seventy feet. In the rni!ldle of that thickness, a11gnlar bowlders of cousideral.Jle size were seen imbedded iu the ice, and added, wlwn disrngagt·d by mdting, to the mass of the lateral moraine, composed here of YCI'J' large blocks witu slightl;y-romuled angles. Quite a nmnher of lakes, of the cllaracter of those mentioued hefol'e, were seen dnring the excursions ; one or two were retained by moraines. 'l'be next day was very stormy, and the Hassler remaiued in its well-protected anchorage. On the 26tll, the bay of Chnrnca, on the south side of the straits, was visited, iu the hope of finding there a glacier disr~harging directly iuto tlte water; the oue at Glacier Bay, named by Professor .Agassiz tlH.' Hassler Glacier, having its terminus nearl;r half a mile from the water. No such a one was found; the bay, howcrnr, was one of the most beautiful Yisited, being surrounded by high mountains surmounted by glaciers, aud deeply cut by laternl bays branching off iu Yarions clirections. ·without anchoring, therefore, we steamed out again, and, crossing the strait for the first time in sight of tlle Pacific'Oeean beyoucl Cape Pillar, anchorml for the night in Sholl Bay, at the month of Sm:yth'8 Uhauuel. On the 27th, Professor Agassiir, wcut m;bore with a party to fish ancl collect, while the Hassler steamccl out into the middle of the strait to oimmd a drellge, between Sholl Bay and Cape Tamar. The greatest depth found was 135 fathoms. The surface-temperature was 490; bottom, 470,5, The water hall a dark bottle-green color, and it may be remarked here that siuce leaving Montevideo the water had always preoieutell tllis appearance, the ship being ou soundings all the time. The dredge brought up mud and stones and a few sliells and echiuodcnm;. Tue collections nmde on ;,bore were qnite snccessfuL The party on shore were Yisited by natives iu an old ship's boat, who followed tliem to the steamer, bcggiug for tobacco and lJiscuit. The same afternoon the ste:tmer entered 8rnytl1's Channel, and anchorell for the night at Otter Islands. The next day we had at times magnificent views of the snowy peaks and glaciers of the Sarmiento Cordillera and of l\lount l~nmey, its cnlmiuating point in this region. During the forenoon, the rod of the reverRing quadrant of the engi11e broke, aml ocmu;ioned a delay of about two hours. The anchorage for the 1tigllt was at l\lay11e lfar\Jor, wl1ere the next day was also spent while the engineers were making the necessary tempornry repairs. Au excursion 011 shore showed the usual granitic rocks, ·with greenstone veins passing into porphyry, and showing all the markoi of glacier action. The next day'is progresR was aR far aR I'orto Bueno, anchoring there early enough in the after11oon to permit of' the usual collecting excursions. Au early start was malle on tlie 31st, with the hope of reaching an anchorage of Tom's Bay before night; the morning was clear, aml afforded fine views of the snowy Cordill em rrnd of l\louut Stokes ; but, unfortunately, in the afternoon the weather became ver.v thick, so that the landmark:,; gin·n iu the sailing-directions could not he recognized. After trying 8eYcrnl small hays, none of which agreed with the description or oifored a convenient anchol'ing_ ground, 110 choice remained but kee1)ing ill mid-channel for the night, with a boat-parts keeping up a fire 011 the nearest isla1Hl to enable us to retain our position. The 1st of A1)1'il was a particularl,v fine day, enabling us to enjoy the fiue scenery of this part of the strait. 'rue mouth of Eyre Sounll waR passed, out of wl1id1 nnmeron8 small icebergs were floating, detachetl from some large glaciers which disclmrge direct I~' into tlte sea at tl1e head of this sound, but were not in sight from the main channel. Ahout 110011 the Narrows 011 the western side of Saumarez Island were passed, presenting on their sides remarkably fine glacial furrows, following the trend of the valley. Large glaciers in the higher parts of the mountains were frequently seen during the day. The night's anchorage was

On _tlrn 3d, the steamer left the straits, imssing into the Gulf of Peiias. The chain of snowy monntams bonrnling tlw gulf on the east made a magnificent distant panorama at i;un;.;et. Th~· pas8agti from tlie Gulf of Pefias to the Gnlf or CorcoYado w:1s rather tlis<1grecahle as far as the weather was c:mcemed. Tlie latter was read.ted on the Gth, and the steamer anclwreu in the afterno_on in San Pedro Harbor, in the southeast part of t11c islarnl of Chil<w. This port is uninhabited, tb1ekly wooded to the water's edge, aml, as in·c,·iom;ly ohscrYcd hy Harwin, the ,.;Jiores of Chilot> were fouml to exhibit distinct traces of glaciation and numerous erratic blocks, hnt mi well-tfollrwtl marks of the direction of the 111oye111e11t.

Steindaclrncr and -:\Ir. Blake, very extensiYc collections of irntural history. In an cxc·nrsion iu the neighborhootl, Ycry well m:irke(l glacial scratches were discon~1nl 11ear San Vicente, by Mr. PonrbtleR, trnrnling east and west uea.rly. N1·ar Poiut Lobos, Mr. rourtales and Dr. Stcindaclmcr ol>ser\-ed strata of Cretaceous sandston.es, co11tai11ing Trigonias, several hundred feet in thickness, n·sting on nearly Yertical strata of mica-slate. At the junction of the two, an irrrgular stratum, spseral feet in thickness, of :i kind of breceia, was observetl, composed of frngments of the slate, imbetlded in sandstone, and containing al::;o small quartz-pebbles, au<l rounded bowldcrs of quartzite arn.1 granitr, one or two feet in diameter, seeming to point to a drift-epoeh previous to the deposit of the Cretaceous beds. From Talcah nano, Professor and Mrs. Agassiz and Dr. Steiutiachner set out by laull. to Santin go. The Hassler left ou April 3i'i, to run a line of drcdgings aud soundings to .Juan Fernandez, and thence to Valparaiso. Tile slope of the bottom was found Yer.r gra1lnal to the hundrect·fathom line, about thirty-five miles from the mouth of Concepciou Da.1. At the distance of about fifty miles, a depth of 1,005 fathoms was reached. In latitull.e 31JO 30' soutl!, longitude 75° 11 1 west, about two-thirtls of the way from Concepcion Bay to Juan Fernandez, 2,.no fathoms were found. The surface-temperature was 5iOJj; at 117 fathoms, it was 51 o; at tlie bottom, 35°. The bottom was soft mud, anll. fragments of silicioue spouge were fournl adhering to the line. After the sounding, which took four hours and a quarter, the dredge 'ms let down with about 3,800 fathoms of line. It was left on the bott.om about an hour and a halt~ keeping it nuder proper motion by backing tbe steamer at intervals. It was the.n hauled up; but the tension was too strong for the line, which had evidently been damaged by dampness in the hold, au<l which, after haying given endless t~on· ble by stranding several times, finally parted. The dredge was lost, with 2,720 fathoms of hue. The rest of the day and the next were spent in overhauling the line, and cutting out the doub~ful or mildewed parts, the ::;teamer keeping on her way under very slow ::;peed. The weatlwr dnnng that time was not propitious for dredging.

The introduction of the chronograpl1ic registration of tran'<it'< of stars bas considerably increased their precision, remleri11g- it desirable to discuss tht' relati\·e weights of the conditional eqn:ttions rpsnltiug from the treatment by the method of least squares of obserYations made in that way. Tl1c general form of the prohahle error of a transit-obsernition is the same for the cl1rono· graphic a11 for the "eye aud ear'' rndlwd ; which latter has been long since discussed by Bessel in the Berliner .lalnlmch for 18~:1, (sec also Dr. Sawitsch's Practiscbe Astronomic, vol. 1, pp. 128, 12n, Hamlnug, 18:10.) 111 gC>nernl, there i8 a com;tant ya1ne related to the personality of the observer, and a ttwm variable with the star\, declination, tkpcnding on the apparent motion of the star, and affected hy the co11dition of the atmosphere and by the magnifying power of the telescope.

Some obserYers prefer two tapR, corresponding to tlte apparent bii.;eetion of the star by the preceding antl following edges of the threads. The rclatiYc weights of incomplete tramiits are also slightly changed, fiince the determination of instrumental errors is but little improYed, whereas the uncertaint_y in noting time. on each thread has becm consitlerahl,r climinislietl hy the chronographic method. ln Com;t Smn~y practice, two classes of portable instrumentR are employed in the deterrnina· tion of longitudes by memrn of the telegraph: larger-sized transits of about 12 decimeters (nearly 47 incl1es) focal length, ge11t·rall;y with reticules of twenty-five tlireadR; mid smaller-sized meritliantelescopes (tra11sit and zenith telescope combined) of about 6.G decimeters (nearly 26 inches) focal length, gt'llf'rally witll glass dh1pllragrns of fifteen lines. The latter instruments arc used at sta. tions of secomlary importance.

For the larger instruments, the gain in accuracy between 17 and 25 threads is Yer'! trifiinO'· anll it is ~eliev~d that the increased fatigue to the obsen·er anfl consequent change i~ his p;i:sonal equation will more thau counterbalance it. Seventeen tllreads are recommeuded which may conyeniently be disposed in three tallies; the middle one (especially for the ol>sen'atlons of clos~ circumpolars) of 7 equidistant, and the two outer tallies of 5 equidistant threads, about'.!' apart. For the smaller instruments, 13 instead of 15 lines are recommended, with 7 lines in the middle and 3 lines each in the outer tallies. For occasional ohserYatious b;y tile eye and ear, two outer single threads ma;v be added, forming, with the centrnl ones of the tallies, fj equidistant threl1ds, (about l:!' apart.) If the ohsen·er prefers, he may haye clo:se double 1ines, and tiip the star ,vhen exactly between them. Respecting the probable error of the tabular right ascensions of clock-stars, as giYen in the American EphemeriA, we may form some judgment from the table of corrections given in tlrn 'Vashington Observations for 1870 and 1871, (Table C, p. lxxx,-.) Taking the square root of the average square of corrections to these 119 clock-stars, the mean correction, referred to the equator, becomes ±0·.041. The probable error of a tabular right ascension of a fundame11tal star may be estimated at not less than ±0 8 .03, and comparatively greater for other stars. To giye weights for relative uucer. taiuty in the tabular right ascensions is generally impracticable; but we ma;r obtain as consistent nud accurate a set of results as the nature of tlle observationA admits of l>y first using the conditional equatio'ns with equal weights idth re8pect to tabular places, and tletlucing corrections to tlte assumed right ascensions for all stars not fundamental from the obsen·atious of the same star on different nights. A second formation of the numerical fjnantitics of the conditional eqnations ancl solution of the normal equations will give the final results for instrumeutal deYiations and for local time. In this method, tlie apparent right ascensions of the stars are made to refer to the equinox belonging to the fundamen ta! stars. In the i·eduction of a set of transits hy application of the method of leiu:;t squares, (for which see Appendix No. 9, Coast Snrvey Report for 1866; also Appendix No. 10, Heport for ltiGS,) it is recommended to introduce, in the conditional equations, two azimuthal deYiations; oue to apply to the state of the instrument before, the other after, re\ersal. It may also become desirable to introduce a correction to the assumed lwurly rate of the clock, especially if the ohsernttions are gre:ltly extended. . The following example, slmwiug the arrangement of the reduction of transit·ohsenatioms wlie11 weights are applied, is appe11dcd for the sake of completeness. The notation is tile same as tl,at used in Appendix No. 9, Coast Survey J{eport for 1866. It will generally be fouud preferable, on account of tlte laborious process of forming arnl soh·· iug four normal equations, determining the collimation, two azimuthal deviations, and the clockcorrection, to divide the labor into two sets of two normaJ equations, one for clamp east aml the other for clamp west, provided an imlependent azimuth can be fouml for each. 'rl1is ~reatrnent is due to Mr. James Main, astronomical computer in the Coast Stuvt'.Y· The field-computatiou, ora first rough reduction, will furnish an approximate Yallie for 1he collimatio11, and of the Lourly rate of the clock for which the observed times of the tra11sits are correcter!, leaying the azimuthal tle\'i· ation and the clock·correction to be determi ne1l by two normal eq nations ; for tlle second set, theni result two similar normal equationi;;;, nud the criterion for the correctness of the reduction will be the equality of tlte clock-correctio11s, which apply to the epoch of tlte rel'ersal o.( the ~ll8trument. S~oultl the two vulues for oT differ l>.Y a few hundredtlls of a second, the process rn easily gone oYer, mtro· ducing an improved value of c. It will rarel:y be necessary to improve the correcti?n ~or ~ourly rate· the latter being referred to the epoch of the reversal, the efieet on oT l>ecomes i~1s1gmficant· It sdmetirnes liappens that the instrument is re\·ersed t'\\ice in a nigLFs wor~, in which case the reduction may be made as above, determi11i11g a tl1ircl value for azimuthal denat10n aud demanding the identity of three value!\ dedueed for n'. . . 'J.'he example gi\eu below is drawn from the determination of t~e trans-atlantic, loug1tuileyof 1872; being the observations at Parii;, Prance, made Angus t 16: mstrument, C. S. transit No.

PRELIMINARY HEPORT ON THE DETEmUNATION OI:' TRANSATLANTIC LONGIJTDI:::S, BY ,J.E. IIILUAHD, A8SISTA"·;T.

The exact determination of the longitndt·of sonw i1oiut iu the triangulation of tlie Coast SttrYcy from tbe princi~ml observatories of Europe forms one of the most im pol'tant problems of that worl~, and all the varrous means known to science baYe lleen snccessi\'ely llronght to bear on its solution. The Coast Survey Reports from 1848 to lSGG show that the methods of moon-cnlmiuatious, of chronometer-transportation, and of lunar occultations lrnH' each in turn reccin~d a large share or attention. The latter method has not yet yieldecl tile foll results tlmt may Lie expected of it, in consequence of the ill frequency witll which corresponding obserYatio11s are ohtai11ml i11 E11rope and America, owing to the parallactic displaccmen t of the moon. It cannot be douhtml, howcn\r, that, with a suitauly-organizcd system of obsernttion, this method will, in time, gi,·e results of great exactirnss. Upon the successful completion of the Atlantic telegraph from Ireland to Xt\1,·fo1uHl"1ntl. measures were at once taken to make use of that means for tlrn deterrnmatio11 of the longit111h· between the two continents. 'l'he results of these operations, co1HluctPd hy Dr. n. A. Goultl, ha Ye been given at length in the report for 1SG7_ A !though far more certain tlrn11 tlte pre,-ious result:,;, the value thus ohtained still left a larger margin of doubt as to its precision tlrnn i,; <lesira ble iu so fundamental a dctermiuatiou. This uncertainty, wliich probably does not exceed 011t· 1p1arter-second of time, is owing in part to tue fact that, though we can measure the total time of transrni::;~iou of signals through the caule and back again, we are unable to separate the duration in opposite <lirections, and are obliged to assume it equal, an assumption which may not be exact withiil a sensible fraction of a second. \Vhen the laying of tlle French cable, from Brest in France to Duxbury in -"\fassr~clrnsetts, afforded an independe11t means of verifying the former result by ohservations under entirely different conditions, the opportunity was iirornptly seized, alld the longitndl' het\Hl'll Brest and Duxllnrs determined by G. W. Dean, assistant in tlle Coast Survey, as set fortli in the rcport for 1870. At this time, no cable was yet in operation between Brest :rnd Enghrnd, so that :\Ir. Dean was unable to carry his determination direct to tlie observatory at Greenwich. Such a callle hiwiug since been 'laid, the wanting link in the chain of longitudes was supplied, tlnring the imst summer, by J. E. llilgard, assistallt in tlle Coast Stuve,r, who temporarily gave up tlrn charge of the Coa,.;r Survey Office in order to bring this mi.:ch-desired operation to a satisfactory conclusion. ·while re-occupying Brest for that purpose, it appeared in every way desirable that the cxperimcn ts th rough the French cable should be repeated; this tillle with an intermediate station at St. Pierre, wht>1·c the long cable makes a landing. That part of the ope1·ations which connecte1l St. Pierre with Cambridge was under the immediate direction of G. "'· Dean_ · The general plan of operations was to unite, at Brest, signals from St. Pierre, from Gremmich, and from Paris, sent nearly at the same time, and compared by menus of the Brest chronograph; a111l to determine the personal equations of the several obserrnrs through 011e of them, who should ohsernC\ snccessively with all the rest. This was 1lo11e by Sullassistaut F. Blake, jr., who ably as8!,:;tpd Mr. Hilgard throughout the work. Through the kindness and assistance of Sir Grorge B. Airy, the astronomer-royal of England, and of Mr. Delau11ay, the <listi11gni8lled director of the 1':1ris observatory, wl10se lamented death occurred while the operations were in progress, all(~ throngh the generous courtesy of the French Atlantic Telegraph Company and of the Snumarrne Telegraph Company, the work was brought to a l'!nccei.;;i:;ful conclusion in the moutl1 of September, 1S'i2. Jn the course of these operations, tbe longitude between Paris and Greenwich ha8 been incideutally determined in two different ways: first, in Jnly, vi<t Ilre8t; and afterward, in September, between Greenwich and Paris direct, through tile "submarine" cable, via Calais. These two deter-

minations are not entirel,y iudependent of each otlwr, since the personal equation between Blake and the Paris obserYer enters into both; but the near satisfaction of the equation, (Brest-Paris+ Paris-Greenwich+Greenwieh-Brest=O,) or the closiug of that lm1gitude-triangle, must entitle the results obtained to great confidence. We now proceed to giYe some account of the iustrnrnents and methods before reciting the principal res11 lts.
TIREST-GREE~WICII-P ARIS.

The station at 13rest was chosen on the place d'annes in front of the Transatlantic Teleg1:aph Company'8 office, with which it was connectc>d by wires. It was found to be 811 .46 south and 08.44 east of the tower of St. Louis Clmrch, a point in the trigonometrical surv-ey of France. The instruments used were a transit-instrument by Simms, of 45 inches focal length, and 25 inches transit-a:xis, with a diaphragm of 15 lines; a circuit-breaking chronometer by Bond; and a Bond chronograph. The plan adopted for tleterrnining the clock-correctiorn,"provides for observations in both rig-ht and left position of the transit-telescope; a set in each position comprising five time-stars, and two circumpolars, one above and one below the pole. By this system, it is practicable to deduce the azimuthal deviation of the instrument independently for either position, and even to arrive at a fair value of the collimation when observations have been obtained in but one position . .A careful determination of the inequality of pivots was made by a series of levelings; and the corrections found to be due were applietl in the reduction of the observations. The chronometer is fitted with a circuit-breaking attachment, by which the current is interrupted for an instant every two seconds, and likewise at the fifty-ninth second, to mark the minute. In order to avoid the inconvenience arising from the deflagratiou of contact-surfaces, l1y the· spark developed at tbe break, a branch circuit, including a resistance-coil, was introduced according to the deYice of 1\lr. HilgarJ, bridging the break, and permitting the ready passage of the secondary current, while the resistance is too great to affect sensibly the re{:ording magnet. It will be obscrTed that the rate of this chro110rneter was not only determined by the observations made at Brest, bnt was also checked by daily comparisons with the clocks at Paris and Greenwich. Its performance was ver,r satisfactory. The obsen·ations of star-transits and the time-scale were recorded on the chronograph with the same pe11: whereby any correction for relative position of' the pens or styles is avoided, and the reading much facilitated. At the Paris obseryator,y, the general arrangements for the work were committed to Mr. Loewy, who leut a most cordial co-operation to our work. The cl1ronographic method of reco.rding timeobsen·ations, not then iu ordinary use at the observatory, was adopted for the present occasion, and the assistant astronomer, Mr. L. F. Folain, wbo made all the corresponding observations, devoted a fortnight to preliminary practice with the new method, so as to ohtain a settled habit of observiug. The large transit-instrument (lunette meri'.dienne) was employed for the work, which was prosecuted with the greatest assid11ity. The instrument was reversed twice on each night, antl two complete sets of observations were made, each comprising eight stars in eaeh position of the instrument, besides circnmpolars and micrometer-readings on the meridian-mark . .After completing tlrn observations at Brest, Mr. Blake transported hi!> instruments to Paris, and mounted his transit on a pier that had been provided for the purpose, a short distance to the soutp of the o11'3crvatory-tmnsit, very nearly in its meridian, in the garden. Each ohserver now llcterrniued the time with his own instruments and after bis own method, and compared the timekeepers in the same way as had ueen done between Brest and Paris; the personal equation thus obtained including all peculiarities that may arise from instrumental causes· .At Greenwich, the regular routine of observ-ing was followed, as described in the Greenwich Obserrntions; the ohsen'ers chaugiug in a certain rotation; two observers generally determining the clock-corrections ou each day, and their observations being referred to a common standard by the personal equations derived from the comparisons thus obtained. Wben Mr. Blake, after completing the work at Paris, went to Greenwich for the purpose of comparing his personal equation witl1 that of the Greenwich observers, his transit was mounted on

a pier erected for the purpose by order of the astronomer-royal, anrl ag;ain obsened in his accustomed way, comparing bis time-keeper telegraphically witll the Greenwich clock, and likewise with that at Paris, where .Mr. Folaiu was still keeping up his corre;;ponding observations. The Coast Survey party are specially indehted to Mr. ~William Hllis, who, uut!er the direction of the astrono· Iller-royal, aided them in every way in the prosecution of the work. The place of the pier, which bas since been marked by a slab of marble hearing tlle inscription "HILGARD," is 0°.160 west and 1". 74 south of (ireeuwich trausit-cirele. The method of exchanging signals was by means of arbitrary RignalR Rent over the lines and recorded on the chronograph at each station. These signals were SPiit for fi>e minutes at approxi· mate intervals of five seconds, but the intervals were purposely Yaried so as to gh-e different fractional readings. At 11 p. m., Greenwich began :-;ending to Brest, then Brest sent io Greenwich, next Brest to Paris, and finally Paris to Brest. Between Greenwich aucl Brest but one series of signals was excba'nged on each night, as the free use oft he cable could not !Jc granted for rnore than ten minutes. Between Brest an<l Paris, 110wever, a wire was placed at the disposal of the party from 8 p. m., for tl1e night, and, in general, two series of exchanges were obtaiued. The observations of .:Mr. Blake Lave been reducell in the following manner. Tile chronograph-sheets haYing been independently read by two persons, and readings collated, each evening's work was reduced by }\fr. Blake, ou the plan of deriving the collimation and tile azimuthal deviation of the instrument from all the obserrnd stars by means of tlie usual normal equations, giving equal weight to all the stars; the clock-correction being finally determined from stars within 600 declination, omitting the circumpolars, b,r applying the instrumental correctious predously obtained. In a more elaborate second computation, made by R. Keith, each conditioual equation was affected by a weight depending upon the star's declination according to a htw der-ived from the observations themseh'es, and, moreover, separate values for the azimuthal deYiatiou, before and after reversal, were deduced. The resulting clock-corrections, obtained by the two metholls of reduction, show a very good agreement, the average difference being only os.01 i; the sum of the residuals for each star is less in the secon<l than in the first in the ratio of twenty-six: to thirty-one ; but it should be observml that, in consequence of the introduction of four instead of three \'ariables in the equation, the observations shoul<l be better represented iu something near that ratio, and ouly a small improvement can be ascribed to the use of weigllts. This matter will !Jc found more fully discussed in the Coast Surrny Report for 1873, where the obserrntious of the American 1mrties will be "'iven in full. Those made at Paris and Greenwich will be found in the regular . . publications of those observatories. Tbe right ascensions used in these reductions are a mean of those of the \Vashington Observatory from 1862 to 1867, and of the Harvard College 01.iserntory from ,June to NoYember, 187::. They do not agree precisely with either the Greenwich or the Paris right ascensions, but the differ· ences are small. It would certainly have been desirable to use the same data in the reduction of the observations at all stations; but as Greenwich and Paris do not agree in their standard placer;, it was thought best to use the list adopted for the Coast Survey work and let the aceide~tal nir:iations be merged in the errors of obserrntion, while any systematic difference in the places would form part of the persona] equation. The longitudes cannot, ia any sensible degree, he atfocted by the differences ad\·erte<l to.

differing but very little from the preceding Yalnes.

It appears that the uncertainty of any of the above Yalues does not probably exceed o·.03. If we compare them with other determinations heretofore made, we fiud that Brest-Paris was determined telegraphically in 1863, under the direction of l\Ir. Le Verrier~ when the longitude of the " t011r de St. Loiiis" from the "meridienne de .France'' (the center of the Paris obserYators) was fonml to be 27m 18·.49, (Anuales de l'Observatoire de Paris, viii, 1866, p. 279.) In order to reduce our own result to the same point of reference, we must deduct 08 .12 at Paris and add 0·.44 at Brest, whence we obtain 27"' 188 .54, differing but 0·.05 from that fouml by the l:'rnnch operations, wllich were very elaborate, and arc published in full; or if we compare with our direct determination, the difference is only o·.03. Tlte longitude between the observatories of Greeuwid1 and Paris was determfoed in 1854, at the instance of Mr. Le Verrier. The result then obtained, !)m 20 8 .63, which is nearly half a second less than that resulting from our rece11t work, has e>er since been accepted; but the .Paris obscrnt· tions, upon which it depends, haye never been published. Partly owing to this fact, and partly because in those operations the chronographic method was not used, the Central European Geodesic Association had, at its session at Vienna, in the autumn of 1871, expressed the wish that it should be redetermined. In pursuance of this expression, l\fr, Delaunay had already entered into correspondence with Mr. Airy when tlle American pa.rty came into the field, and, desiring to refer their longitude to each obseryatory inclependently, obtained leave to determine the difference between the same as an incidental part of their operations. It is to I.Jc presumed that anotlter determination will be made uefore long to ,-erify this important datum. Another combination of the results may he made in the following manner. Hemarking that, on four occasions, observations were bad at Greenwicll, Brest, and Paris on the same e\·enings, we may deduce the longitude Greenwich-I'aris directly, without using the obserrntious at Brest, when we obtain:

It was intended that the observations at and exchanges of signals between the American stations should be as nearly simultaneous with those in Europe as the weather might allow, in order that the intermediate stations at Brest and St. Pierre should sensibly disappear from the determination of the longitude of Cambridge from Greenwich and Paris. Such simultaueons operations proved, however, to be impracticable, in com1equence of the condition of the cables. The long cable between Brest and St. Pierre was working ba!lly, and required to be repaired before it was fit for our use. When this was accomplished, it proved to have a better insulation than ever before, and transmitted the signals with great sharpness. Meantime, the cable between St. Pierre and Duxbury had been broken, and could not be repaired during the summer, in consequence of which our armngements required to be changed. Mr. Dean, who bad charge of the American part of the operations, at once proceeded to make arrangements for exchang'ing signals between St. Pierre and Cambridge, over the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick telegraph-lines, connected with St. Pierre by a short cable, and working with or!linary 1\Iorse registers, so that this part of tlie work offers no unusual fea· tures, the signals being registered automatically on the chronograph. The signals sent through the Brest-St. Pierre cable, on the contrar~-, were observe!l by means of the Thomson galvanometer, as heretofore described in the account of the 1867 longitude operations by Dr. Gould. The cable was working so well that no special battery or signal-arrangements were required; a single current at intervals of fh·e seconds giving a very sharp movement of the index, which returned to its zero before the next signal was sent. The personal equation of each observer, in perceiving and record· ingthese signals upon his chronograph by tapping a key, was frequently determined by means of a short circuit, and was found to be very constant for each observer as well as nearly equal for both· For Blake, at Brest, it was o·. 24; and, for Goodfellow, at St. Pierre, OS.23. The station at St. Pierre was in charge of Mr. E!lward Goodfellow, assistant in the Coast Sur· vey, who had taken part in the two predous detrminations of transatlantic longitude by cable. All the observations were made by himself. The observer at Cambridge was Mr. Edwin Smith, of the Coast Survey.. The instrument was mounted on a pier, one hundred and eight feet to the west of the observatory-dome, to which our longitudes are usually referred, requiring a reduction of (}·.096. Three piers were built in this temporary observatory, permitting the three transit-instru· ments used in the expedition to be mounted in the same meridian at one time. This was done after the retnrn of the observers from Europe and St. Pierre: for the purpose of determining their personal equations and some instrume11tal constants. The instruments were alike in construction, having forty-five inches focal length, twenty-five inches transit-axis, mounted on a heavy cast-iron stand, and provided with a reversing-apparatus. They differed, however, in the arrangement of the diaphragm-lines; :\'Ir. Goodfellow having preferred the usual spider-lines; Mr. Blake a s,ystcrn of double lines rule!l on glass; and Mr. Hmith single lines rule<l on glass. The personal equations were compared by each observer determining the time with his own instrument in the customary manner, using the same stars, as well as by observing at the same instrument the transit of the same stars oYer alternate tallies of lines. The results by the two methods were found not to differ sensibly.

The first datum only enters into the longitude Cam bridge-Brest, since Goodfellow occupied au intermediate position. Advantage was taken of the opportunity of placing the three transit-instrnments in the same meridian, for the purpose of testing them as to flexure of the transit-axis, by comparing in each the line of collimation as indicated by reversals, right and left, with that resulting from revoh'ing it about the axis, using the two other instruments as collimators, each being in turu placed in the middle. The collimation resulting from the observation of circmnpolar stars in the direct aml reversed positions was likewise compared with that from reversal in the horizontal direction of the telescope, using the adjoining one as a mark. The results fully confirmed that there are no sensible inequalities of fiexure in these instruments. At the request of the Superintendent of the Unite\l States Naval Ohseffatory in Washington, signals were also exchanged between St. Pierre and 'Vashington during the progress of the work, and subsequently the several obser\rers compared personal equations. Of this portion of the work, no results have yet been reported. The second and most elaborate computations of the longitudes St. Pierre-Brest and Cambridge-St. Pierre are also still in progress while this report is going to press, and the final results cannot therefore be given at this time. But they cannot differ mat.erially from those of the preliminary com1mtations given below, which were made by the observers in the field. The difference in the time between Brest and St. Pierre, as derived from eastern and western signals, including the personal equations of the operators aud the time of transmission forward and back through the cable, was, on the average, !8.19, varying five-hundredths from the mean. Deducting from this the sum of the personal equations, 0 8 .47, we find, for twice the time of transmission through the cable, o·. 72, or 0 8 .36 for a distance of twenty-two hundred nautical miles. The signal-time between St. Pierre and Cambridge was 0·.14. The following are the results for longitude :

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

We will finally compare the preceding results with those obtained in 1866 through the IrelandNewfoundlaud cables by the operatious comlucted by Dr. B. A. Gould, a full account of which is published in the Coast Survey Heport for 1867, and also in vol. XVI of the Smithsonian Contributious. The results there given lack one hnk in order to be complete, that being the personal equation between Mosman, the observer at l!'oilbommerurn 1 and the standard observer at Greenwich. This defect we have endeavored to supply, as far as is practicable after the lapse of some years, through the personal equations between Mosman, Blake, and the Greenwich observers in the following manner. The well-ascertained equation between Blake and Mosman is that Blake places himself o·.09 to the west of Mosman. He is, moreover, 0".07 to the east of the present Greenwich standard observer, (Oriswick,) who again is o·.11 to the east of the standard observer of 1867, (Dunkin.) Hence we deduce that Mosman placed himself 0".05 more east t.11an Dunkin, and the former difference of longitude between Greenwich and Foilhommerum must be increased by that amount. The figures given in the publications above referred to require some other corrections in consequence of the personal equations having been applied with the wrong sign. We therefore recite the several links of the combination as follows:

The close agreement of the three independent determinations made in different years is therefore no less surprising than it is satisfactory. We have:

1.-DETERl\HN.ATION O.F THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION. The magnetic declination at any place, being the angle contained between the astronomirml and magnetic meridians, requfres for its measure two distinct operations, namely : The determination of the astronomical meridian, wl1id1 is generally done by means of a theodolite; and tlte determination of the magnetic meridian (at a given epoch) by means of the declinometer, (or unifilar magnetometer.) The former of these planes is fixed, the latter variable, and the obRerv-ation~ mav hav-e for their object the determination of the declination at various hours of the day, or its rnea~ value for any one day, month, or year. Respecting the determination of the astronomical meridian by means of observations of the azimuth of the sun or of a star, fo11 information will be found in the paper on '· The Determination of an Astronomical.Azimuth," in the Coast Survey l{eport for 18GG, .A.ppem1ix No. 11, pp. SU-!19; the example of observations and reduction given attheend of that paper is taken from a magnetic record. It may be stated that a determination of the meridian which il'l correct within 1' folly suffices for magnetic work in general, since it is difficult to determine the magnetic meridian within the same limit, ou account of its continued fluctuations. We shall suppose that the azimuth of some mark (any conrenient distant oiJject) is known, and that we ham merely t.o find the magnetic azimuth of this mark in order to obtain the declination, which is generally distinguished by a + sign, if the magnetic meridian is west of the true north meridian, and by a - sig·n, if east of it. Adjustment of tJie IJti.clinometm·.-A station having been selected, apparently free from local attraction, the instrument is mounted, with the sides of the box containing the mag-net ~lirected nearly north and south, (magnetic,) which may be conveniently done by means of a pocket-compass; the instmment must be leveled and the theodolite or telescope a<ljusted.* In that form of construction of the instrumentt which has the magnet-box mounted over the azimuth-circle, the observer rnay face either the north or south end of the magnet; but in the more complete form of the magnetometer, with ·attached theodolite, the observer would better face the north end of the magnet, in order to admit more readily of observing the sun for time and azimuth, (also for latitude.) The change, if desired, can be made by exchanging the lens and pl:tne-glass of the collimator-magnet; but if the same magnet is also used for the intensity-determination, it must not be disturbed after the constants hm"e once beeu determined. The motion of the magnet is controlled by the observer by means of a small piece of magnet· ized steel, (a small scre1v-driver ;) its magnetism (at its free end) being the same as that of the eud of the magnet facir1g the observer, so as to repel it when brought near. It must neither be too strong, nor be brought too elose to the magne~, otherwise the position of the magnetic axis migllt be disturbed. The suspension-tube should carr,y at its top a rack aud pinion to admit of an easy vertical movement of the magnet. With a piece of cloth at the bottom of the box, the magnet can be let down, and ('.Orne to rest by friction on the fibers of the cloth, and can then he raised and quickly ste;idied b~, the magnetized screw-driver, all without opening the box, which in windy weather must be avoided.

covers to darken it, and the width of the slit facing the mirror must be specially regulated for the best definition of the scale ; the shade placed over the object-end of the telescope should nearly touch the box:, in order that all stray light may be excluded. The special adjustments to be made are the following : Suspend the torsion-cylinder, which is of the same weight precisely as the magnet, and take out the twist of the suspension-fibers, of w bi ch there should not be more than are absolutely needed to support the weight without risk of breaking-say about 4 or 6 for the heavy magnets, and 1 or 2 for the light ones. With the aid of the rack-motion and the friction on the cloth, the whole turns of twist are readily taken out, and then the line of detorsion must be placed in the magne\ic meridian, in which position the axis of the torsion-weight must be parallel with the side of the box.~ In packing, the suspension should be kept free of twist, so that at any new station only the small changes in the twist need attention. The weight should be removed, the magnet suspended, and the telescope pointed nearly to the middle of its scale, or to the axis of the magnet. The axis of the collimator and the line of collimation of the telescope should then be, as nearly as possible, in the same straight line. To render the scale distinct, the telescope must be set to sidereal focus. The azimuth-circle is then read; the reading, when pointing to the mark,t having previously been recorded. The relative position of the theodolite and magnet is, of course, invariable, both being supported by the same stand. The scale-reading of the magnetic axis of the collimator is determined by readings with scale erect and inverted, as shown in the following example:

NoTE.-lt is recommended to make these observations about the epoch of the day when the magnet is nearly stationary.

The angular value of a division of the scale is determined by successive pointiugs on the principal divisions, and noting the corresponding readings of the azimuth-circle, and repeating the operation in the reverse order. With that form of the instrument which has the box of the magnet connected with the azimuth-circle, the combination of the results will correct for change of declination during the measures, but a small correction for"torsion may be needed ; for the other form of construction the magnet may be fastened in its normal position during the scale-measures. The usual value of a scale-division is between 1' and 3', and tenths may be estimated. It is only for those instruments which give primarily the amount of deflection, in the intensity-measures, expressed in scale-divisions, that an accurate determination of the scale-value is needed. ·
*This process may require repetition lllltil the observer is assured that there is no torsion when the collimatormagnet is suspended. t The best position of the mark is near the horizon.

Henoo one division of scale=2'.797, NOTE.-If the number of pointings is odd, instead of even, the mean reading corresponding to the rniddle division must be found and subtracted from ea.ch separate value. The differem~es so obtained must be added, and their sum, (irrespective of sign,) when di>ided by the corresponding number of scale-divisions, furnishes the desired value.

For an example of the amount of torsion, as measured from four twists of 900 each, see "Observations for Intensity-Oscillations." It appears from observations of the daily fluctuation of the declination that the mean of the extreme easterly and westerly positions in any one day approaches nearly to the mean position of the day, as derived from hourly observations continued day and night. Since corrections to observed declinations to refer them to the mean of the day are generally very unsatisfactory, it is recommended to observe the declination for any one day at the epochs of the eastern magnetic elongation and of the western magnetic elongation, and take the mean position as representing the declination for that day. The epochs of extreme positions, as observed at Philadelphia and Washington, apply, with comparatively small changes, to nearly all places within the United States, and may be stated to be as follows : Referring to the north end of' the magnet, the morning eastern elongation occurs, on the average, from April to September, inclusirn, about 7~ a. m.; fr-0m October to March, inclusive, about 8! a. m.; earliest time in July and August, about 7 a. m.; latest in December or January, about 81 a. m. These epochs, however, are subject to great fluctuations, and cannot be depended upon in a.ny one case within one hour, and frequently they cannot be recognized at all, either on a.ccount of the small range of the daily fluctuation, (the amount of which in winter is but one-half, nearly, of the amount in summer,) which is easily disguised by small irregn· larities, or on account of disturbances, which reach their maxima in September and October, and generally are more predominant in winter than in summer. The afternoon western elongation occurs, on the average, a little before lt p. m. from A.pril to September, inclusive, and a little later than 1! p. m. from October to March, inclusive; also, earliest in August and September-some minutes before 1 p. m., and la.test in March-about 1~ p. m. The afternoon epoch is subject to less fluctuation than the morning epoch.

238

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The observations for declination, which consist in noting the scale-readings, must be made, say, every quarter of an hour from a sufficiently early time in the morning to make sure of preceding the eastern elongation; when this is fairly passed, and consequently the north end of the magnet has commenced its westerly motion, the observations may be discontinued, to be resumed again shortly after noon for the second epoch, as shown in the following example:

The observer's attention should be specially directed to the frequent examination of the line of detorsion, since every change iu the temperature or moisture of the air is apt. to develop twist which, if not removecl, will injure the accuracy of the obseryations. ' 2.-ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MEASURES OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE .
. It is usual, when accurate results are desired, to measure the horizontal component of the mag· net1c force by means of a portable magnetometer, and the dip by means of a dip.circle, and to derive ~he total force by combining these. In high magnetic latitudes, where the horizontal component 1s feeble in comparison with the vertical component, Lloyd's statical metl10d is to he preferred. To measure the horizontal force, two distinct operations are required, known as" Observations of Deflectiomi" and "Observations of Oscillations." Their combiuation will enable us to separate; in the observed force, that part which is due to the magnetism of the magnet from that which is due to the earth's magnetism. Eitller of these oi;erations will determine relative horizontal intensity, and, when used in connection with a base-station where the magnetic force is known, absolute results will also be obtained. In this case, the observer should return to the base-station after the completion of his magnetic surYt·y, aud again measure the magnetism of his magnet, which, in the interval, must be carefully guarded against changes, and the results must be corrected, if necessary, for loss of magnetism. Tlie magnetometer, (see Sketch No. 20.)-There are two forms of unifilar magnetometers in use: hose with a complete astronomical theodolite, or alt-azimuth, mom1ted to the magnetic north or south of the box in which the collimator-magnet is suspended, and on tlle same stand with it; and those which have the box: with suspended magnet mounted centrally over, and firmly connected with, an azimuth·circle, the reading-telescope being mounted eccentrically on supports. The ftrst form (supposed to have been devised by Gauss) is the preferable one in field use; it admits of greater expedition, allows of greater ease in observing, and is almost indispensable wllen the astronomical meridian has to be determined. With the magnet to the south of the theodolite, it readily admits of observations of the sun, for the determination of time and azimuth (also of latitude, if required) without interfering with the magnetic work proper. Deflections are read off on the scale of the collimator-magnet, and must be converted into angular measures. The second form· (supposed to have been given by Dr. Lamont) is capable, perhaps, of greater accuracy, and is better suited for a fixed observatory, especially wheu declinatiou disturbances also are to be observed, or at stations where there is a large daily range in the declination. The angles of deflection are at once read off. In order to observe the azimuth-mark, the magnet and box have temporarily to be removed, which is unnecessary in the first forrn of the instrument. \Vhen observing deflections, the bar, and consequently the defle?ting magnet, remain fixed in the magnetic prime vertical, in the magnetometer, with attached theodolite ; but, in the second form of tlie instrument, the deflecting and deflected magnets al ways remain at right angles to each other. t The operation for either construction of the instrument is essentially the same, and the simple modification~ uecessary in using one or the other form in observing and computing will be specially noted under the appropriate heads of the work. When observing for time and for duration of oscillations, a mean-time box-chronometer is most convenient for use; the observer will llimself take up the beat (half-second) and estimate fractious of seconds. For a traveler, who dislikes to be much incumbered, a pocket· chronometer is much to be preferred, but the counting of the beats, generally five in two seconds, requires rnme previous practice. It is recommended to take up an even beat-say at o, 10, 20, 30, &c. seconds-and count only the even beats, repeating the letters a b c din the intervals; thus, 10 ab~ d, 12 a b c d, 14 a, &c. The Jett ers are afterward couverted into their equivalents of time; thus, 14 c would be 15·.2.

The co-eflicient Q, dependi11g on the fourth power of r, may be neglected. The two distances rand r 1 (to be measured from the middle of the magnet) may be in the ratio of 1 to nearly; or, for convenience, the second distance may be one-hnlf gt'eater than the first, but the shorter distance should not be less than abont four times the length of the deflecting magnet.

The scale of the deflecting bar t should he examined for graduation and eccentricity errors, and corrected for them if necessary.

These two operations should, therefore, al ways immediatel;y follow each other. Observations of oscillations.-The instrument beiug adjusted, and the intensity (long) magnet t sm;pended without twist, with scale horizontal, and the copper !lamper removed, the observer will arrange his scheme for observing the duratfon of a certain number of oscillations, from which tlrn time of one oscilhttion is to be deduced. The bulb of the thermometer to indicate the temperature of the magnet i!;! put im;ide the box. Tbe mean-time chronometer,§ whose rate must be known, is placed at a safe distance below the telescope, allowiug the observer to take up the time and to bear the beat without changing his place. With the magnet at rest, the vertical thread of the telescope should point nearly to the reading on the scale of the magnetic axis, or to the center division. Care must be taken that the magnet bave no up and down vibrations; a horizontal motion is then given to it by means of a small mag· netizecl piece of steel, suflicient to make it vibrate for about twenty or twenty-fl ve minutes before coming to rest. The oscillations are counted as follows: Suppose the center division of the scale to pa-ss from apparent right to left, call its first transit over the line of collimation of tbe telescope O, and note the time, (the minute having preYiously Leen noted, the second is adtletl without taking

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT O:F

A series of not less than twelve sets of observations of oscillationR, with the magnet alternately unloaded and loaded, is to be made, each set duly corrected for torsion, rate of chronometer, anu difference of temperature, from which the value of K is deduced. These results are to be combined with a >iew of eliminating the effoct of changes in H during the observations; thus, the mean of sets 1 and 3 is used with set 2, the mean of 3 and ."i with ±, &c., the first and htst sets being alike either with magnet unloaded or loaded. As the torsion cl1angl's with the weight, observations for torsion must also be made with the loaded magnet. To find K 1, let r a1Hl r 1 represent t11e iuner and outeL' radii, expressed in decimals of a foot, and 'If' the weight of tlle ring iu grains; tlw11K1 = ~ (r 2 + rl) n· 2 The values of log r. K for di:lfereHt temperatures should be taltu1aiell. It suffices to assume the ordinary co-efficient of expansion for brass, (0.000010.) The reduction of the time of an oscillation to an infiuitesirual arc is genernlly so small as not to affect lbe magnetic results. If a antl a' express the initial and terminal semi-ares of an oscillation, (iu parts of the radius,) then tl1e corrected ,-alue for T 2 \Yi11 he( 1 -

-1it')2 T2

This correction can be ayoided by swinging only through small arcs. 'l'o reduce the measures of deflections and oscillations to the same temperature, let t = the temperature of the magnet when defiecthig; t1 =its temperature when oscillating; q =the change in magnetic moment of magnet for a change in temperature of 1 c I<'ahrenheit, then tlw co-efficient to he applied to T 2 is e<1nal to 1- (t' -t) q, as shown iu the example. The Yalne of q is not constaut, but, for a moderate rm1ge of temperature, may be taken as constaut; it must be obtained experimentally, either from oscillations or from detlections, at various temperatures, but tlie magnet should not be subjected to a greater range of temperature tlian from about ~{2C to 1000 FahrenhPit. These obserYatious must be conducted hy the alternate use of a jacket of ice and of hot water, m· b:'I' the aid of extreme natural temperatures; ample time must, bowe,·er, be given to the magnet to establish again an equiUhrium it its magnetism; all rapid changes from co1u to llot (or i 1ice i'ersa) will giYe decidellly enoneous values for q. Supposing not less than three consecutfre series of obgen·ations of deflections for finding a Taine of q, all(l the .first and third series to be at nearly the same temperature, with their resnltg combined to a. mean, and the second or intermediate series at a greatly different temperature, then q may be fonncl, with su1ficient precision, by the expressiona ncot u q =---t - to where a= the arc value of one diyision of the scale of the suspended magnet in terms of the radius; n =the difference of scale-readings corresponding to the difforence of temperature t - t 0 ; aud 11 =angle of deflection at the lower tem1Jerature t 0 · In every case, the arrangement must be such as to eliminate, as far atc1 possible, any effects of changes in <leclination and intensity during the obserYations. lf other instruments are available, it is best to correct the readings for cha11ges in declination and intensity.

The former method is more expeditious; the latter can always he I'esorted to> aml consists in four ruadings of the azimuth-circle of the instrument when placed successively in tl>e positions: face of circle south, (magnetic,) with face of needle south and face of needle north; next, face of circle north, with face of needle north and face of needle south; the mean reading + !>0° and - 900 will give the settings of the circle for the measure of the dip. A more precise value will be found if the process is repeated, with the polarity of the needle reversed. In atljusting the dip-circle, preparatory to observing, the following conditions should he attended to, and the observations should be arrauged so as to eliminate any small outstanding defects in the perfect condition of the instrument: the instrument must remain level when turned about a vertical axis; the agate or steel plates supporting the needle should have their upper surfaces level, shoul<l be of equal height, and a horizontal tangent-plane should pass below the center of graduation of the circle at a distance equal to the radius of the axle of the neeule. The zero grad nation of the circle should lie in a horizontal plane; also the plane of the suspended needle and that of the circle should be truly vertical; and, finally, the prol011gation of the axle of the needle shonld pass throug11 the center of graduation. Bor instruments provided with microscopes the following additional conditions should be satisfied: the microscopes must be focused and collimated; their threads should be 1300 apart, and if produced should pass through tbe center of graduation.

The needles, before magnetization, should balance perfectly, and those intended for the relafrrn measure of total intensity, according to Dr. Lloyd's methocl, r:rboultl be guarded as much as })Ossible against any change in their magnetism. Reversal of poles of dipping-needles.-The needles which are exclusiYel,y used for Ute measure of the inclination should have their poles reYersed at each place of ubser>ation, and the results with polarity north and polarity south must be combined to a mean Yal ne. If exceptionally the polarity should not have been reversed at a station, the difference in results between polarity north and south, as founcl at stations which have nearly the same dip, may he applied as a correction. 'l'o reven1e the polarity we may proceed as follows: fasten the needle in the reversing-blcck, and, holding a barmaguet in each hand, bring the opposite poles of the two bar-magnets close to1,;ethcr at the middle of the needle so as to touch the same on either side of the axle; the needle is supposed to be on a level plane, and the bars are to be inclined outwanl about 450 to the horizon. They are then drawu slowly and steadily over the needle, carrying them over its ends, and, after lifting them some inches above the level of the needle, bring them b:wk to the middle position, aml move them again over the surface. This process may be gone through three times, when the upper face of the needle is turned down, in which position the magnetization is repeated as before. Oare should be taken to have the motion exactly in the direction of tlte geometrical axis of the needle; the magnetizing. block usually has a ledge, along which tlle magnet can be drawn, closely touching it, which will insure a moyemeut parallel to the axis of the magnetic needle. If its north end is to be changed to a south end, place the north (or marked) end over that end of the needle when magnetizing. Tlle polarity as well as the face may be designated by means of the 11 nm ber or letter usnall.r cut on the end of the needle. The reversing-bars should he carefully handled, and should not be allowed to touch each other except with opposite poles, and when placeu in the box their ends of opposite polarity should be connected by a soft-iron armatures. If the re..ersal of the needle is to be repeated a short time after the operation, the method is only changed by using four instead of three passes oycr each face of the needle; if another reversal is needed shortly after, five passes would be required. This is done in order first to neutralize the existing magnetic polarity, and then to giYe it the opposite polarity desired; if, however, one or more days have elapsed between a reversal, enough of magnetism is lost to render any increased number of passes unnecessary. Their numher depends primarily on the strength of the bars and the relative size of the bars and needles. Should the bars have too much intensity and the ueeclles be long, an irregnlar distribution of magn,etism might be produced. Should the bars be of unequal intensity, it is recommended to exchange· them in the hands, after performing one-half of the operation of reversal, turning them at the same time end for end, aml completing the operation in the new position. 'Yhen not in use, and when observing for dip, the bar-magnetf'I should not be kept nearer to the obseryer than about six meters; but when observing for declination, they should be kept at a greater distance. The following example of a record of ordinary observations of the dip will sufficiently show t11e general arrangement. The readings in the second line are independent of those of tlle first, and between them the needle has al ways been lifted off its supports. If the position of the needle is recorded while slowJy oscillating, it is customary to record the left and right extreme excnrsions, and, in order to correct for diminution of arc, tbe mean of the reading of the first extreme and of its next return to it should be taken before combining with the reading of the Opt)Osite extreme. In this case, the mean for the first extreme positions may be taken mentally, and the second extreme is recorded under it; then follow two more such readings after the needle has been lifted off and let down again on the agate supports. It is recommended to observe the neellle while slowly oscillating in preference to noting its position at rest, in which case the equilibrium may be influenced by a small irregularity in the axle at the point of contact, which wouJd be passed over by an oscillating motion. Defects in the figure of the axle may also be recognized by irregularities in the motion of the needle. Tbe introduction of position-needles having a moYable axle, which may be turned by means of a key to different positions with a view of eliminating small defec~s in the figure of the ax~e, has, so far, not proved as satisfactory as was anticipated, from the d1~culty perfectly figurrng the axle and centering the movable arbor; if such needleR are used, their polar1t~', after the first ~e_t of observations, must be reversed, and the observations be concluded before turning to a new 1ms1tton.

But the best metliod would seem to be that of nraycr, (proposed in 1814,) which is 1ieculiarls fitted for eliminating the effect of an irregularity in the figure of the pirnts, since the di can he found on almost any part of the circumference of the axle. This method consists in loading the needle, (near its axis,) and thus clianging its direction. The new position is conditioned by the equilibrium of the magnetic force and that of gravity. The tilt may amount to 90° or more; and should the needle be t1efiected in the atljacent quadrant, the algebraic sign of the obserwd dip changes, and must be attended to. Por want of a better contrivance, a drop of sealing-wax may be applied to the side of the needle near its axle, and observations may be made with tbe needle yariously deflected by changing its quantity, or bs Jetting it act at a different leverage. The ordinary rules for observing dip are adhered to, but special care must be taken that the weight be not changed in position in the act of revert-ling the polarit,y. This method of reduction may also be followed if ordinary needles differ as much as 4° in any of their separate results, due to change of face or polarity.

CONCLUDING RE::\IARKS.-Tbe degree of accuracy attainalJle in the magnetic measures can only be estimated, chiefly on account of the almost incessant changes in the action of terrestrial magnetism. With well-constructed instruments, snch as have been supposed in tbis article, and with fair obs~rvations, the resulting declina~ion for any one day may, in our magnetic latitudes, be aftected with no greater probable uncertamty than about ::!:: 3', and correspoudiugJ~- less if the observations extend o"er more than one day. The dip may be affected with a probable uncertainty between ± 1' and ± 51, according to the perfection of the needles and the number of ohsen·ations made; and the horizontal intensity, in general, ma,y become known within about its :rh· part from any one day's observations. To find the effect ou the total force, we ha\·e tlrn relattoud F = d ll &ec o + F tan o d o.

MEMORANDUM ON THE ORDINARY ADJUSTMENTS OF THE THEODOUl'E, OR PORTABLE ALT-AZIMUTH INSTRUMENT, FOR THE MEASlJREMENT OF HOIUZONTAL AND VERTICAL ANGLES.
The various operations for placing the parts of a theodolite in proper condition for ouserving, in or<ler to eliminate, as far as possible, sourccM of error arising from instrumental defects, may be briefly stated as follows:

To aclj1tst the lei·els.-After properly setting up the stand, clampit1g it, and mounting the instrument, acljnst the most sensitive of the levels attached to it by bringing two of the foot-screws of the theodolite in line with the directbn of the level, and, after leveling, turn the aiirnuth-circle 180°, correct any defect, one-half by means of the foot-screws, (11lways working them in opposite directions,) the other half by means of the a<ljusting-scrcws of the level; tnrn the circle back to first position and repeat tl1e correction as before as often as may be necessary. If during this operation we hJl'n the circle once or twic1.> at right angles to the former position aml make.the bublJ!e play in tht> middle b:y turn· ing the third foot-screw of the theo<lolite, there may be no need of usi11g the grad11atio11 to effect the adjustment of the level, the turning of 180° by estimation being sufficient to effect the purpose. If tliere is a second le,·e1 attuchetl tu the circle at right angles to the former, it may be ndjnsted like the first, or, more expeditiously, by placi!lg it i!l the same direction as the first, (when in adjustment,) a.nd correcting any defect by its correcting-screw. Circular levels must be adjusted upon the same principles ; they are, however, generally of inferior accuracy.
TQ place the axiB of th~ azimutk-circfo -rcrtical.-By means of the adjusted level we place the vertical axis in position by leveling the instrument with the two foot-screws parallel with the direction of the level, and then turning the circle 90° and bringing the bubble again to the middle by turning the third foot-screw. The verticality of the axis is tested by the steadiness of the bubble iu the ruidclle of the tube wlien the instrument is slowly revolved in azimuth.

To ail}11Bi the threada of the teleBcope.-Place the threads in the focus of the eye-piece where their best definition is obtained, and test the positi<Jn by pointing t<J a <lista.nt well-defined object to which the focus of the object-glass is adjusted for distinct vision; and if by moving the eye sidewise the object appears to move off the thread or pointing in the same direction as the eye, the diaphragm must be slightly pushed in, and pulled ont, in the contrary case. If there are two threads intersecting in the middle of the field at rigl1t angles, tlie vertical thread may be set vertical by sighting a plumb-line suspended at a proper distance, or the vertical edge of a house may be used instead. The whole dia· phragm (after !loosening its four screws) ii; to be turned aronnd the optical axis to effoct the coincidence. The pre· ceding adjustment must not be disturbed. The horizontal thread may also be tested by pointing to an object and then turning the aaimuth-circle, previously set horizonta.1, when the object should remain bisected; it may also be eflccted by pointing on the sea-horizon. To adfeat the line of collimation of the tclesoope.-If the horizontal axis of the telescope admits of being reversed in its supports, a distant object is pointed to; and if, after reversal of the axis in its V's, the pointing remain perfect, the line of collimation is at right angles to the a.xis; if not, half of the difference is to be corrected hy tbe azimuth-screw and

254

half by the two adjt1sting-screws of the diaphragm, (its former adjustments remaining undisturbed.) If the axis does not mlmit of reversal in the V's, it must be revers!'Jl by reversal of the circle, nsing the graduation; and if the seconll reading, after reversal, should differ from it a little more or less than 180", tho difference must be corrected as before, and the process is to be repeated until the reallings, direct and reversed, differ by 180° exactly. For greater uccurncy, we may use a. collimator instead of the distant olijeet. In some instruments, the telescopes are mounted on one side instead of in the middle of the azimuth-ci~cle; their collimation may be corrected by two distal'lt marks separatetl exactly by twice the eccentricity of the axis of the telescope from the vertical axis of the theodolite. The process of adjustment is then the same as described, only changing the mark with a change of the telescope from one siue to the other. For oblique intersections of the threads, the point of intersection must be brought into the optical axis of -the telescope, the adjustment for collimation being the same as described. In tllis case, a collimator is used to advant~ge.
1'v place the horiz()11fal axis of the telescope in positio11.-Tbis axis mnst lJe at rip,ht nllgles to that of the azimnth-eircle, and if in position or horizontal the line of collimation, when revolving the telescope, must pass through the zenith of the observer. It is effected by placing an adjusted level on the axis and correcting the whole error with the adjustingscrew of the pivot. If the level is fixed 01· uncorrecteu, it must be adjusted at the same time with the axis by leveling and then turning the azimuth-circle 180°, and correcting one half of the defect liy tile pivot-screw and the other half by the level-screw. This process also rec1uires repetition for its perfection. The instrnment is now reaay for the measurement of horizontal angles, either by "directions'~ or by "angles,'' with or without repetitions, according to the construction of the instrument or the requirements of the case. In either metllod, one half of the measures must of course be maae with "circle direct,'' the other half with "circle reversed" by ieou, which process corrects the angles for any remaining defect, after adjustment, in the -verticality of the axis, in tlie height of the V's, in the form of the pivots, anll in the collimation. If the telescope is placed eccentrically, this reversal will at the same time refer the resulting measures to the axis of the circle, or, what shouhl be the same, to the vertical of the station. In repeating angles it suffices to record the readings of the circle at the commencement and at the end of the operation, the telescope being reversed after half the number of repetitions are secured. During the reversal of the telescope and the circles they remain firmly clamped until the new pointing is made. 'Vith non-repeaters, or when used as sucb, the records for telescope "D" and for telescope "R" are kept separate. The eccentricity of a circle is corrected by taking tho mean of the readings of two opposite verniers or microscopes, or the mean of tbe readings of any nnmher of verniers or microscopes, provided they are so placed a8 to 1liville the whole circnmforcncc into equal parts.
To adj11Bt lhe level requiredjtJr i·ertical niea"1ir~.-The measurco of vertical angles depend, among other things, on the accuracy of the aajnstment of the level. It is effected by leveling and reversing the azimuth-circle 180°, using one of the level-screws for correction, proviaed the former aujnstment of the vertical axis has not been disturbed. This kvel may eitbe1· be attached to the azimuth-circle or to the arms carrying the verniers or microscopes of the altitude-circle; in the former position, it 1s of course placed parallel to, or in the plane of, the altitude-circle. The instrument is now in the proper condition for the measure of vertical angles. Generally, double zenith-distances arc rneasurnd, liy means of which the reading of the zenith (or nadir) point on the circle becomes known, and consc<1ne11tly also the reading of the horizon. If there is any index-error, it may either be correctecl (most instruments admit of such a correcti 011) or it may be allowed for as a constaut when single altitudes are measured. This index-error is of no consequence if double zenith-distances are taken, (involving positions, circle right and circle left.) Owing to the great diversity in the construction of theodolites, depending upon their particular use and the degree of perfection required of tbrn, rules cannot be given to apply alike to all constructions; but the preceding notes will apply in all ordinary cases of the use of tl1e portable instrument. To test the graduation, its eccentricity, systematic and irregular errors; to atljust tile reading microscopes, (for run an:l focus;) to test the coincidence of the two horizontal axes, also of the two vertical axes in 1·epeating-i11stru.ments; to examine the perpendicularity of the planes of the circles (graduation) to their respective axes; to measure the flexure of the telescope, and other circumstances, will require the attention of the observer when engaged in the more refined geodetic or astronomical use of the a.It-azimuth. The principle of repetition applies most advautageously when the optical power of the telescope exceeds relativell· tho accuracy of the grauuation ; in other words, when the pointing-error is less than the gr&dnation-error. If the optical power is inferior, or not commenRnrate with the perfection of the graduation, we may still save time by using this method, the number of readings being less; or it may be utilized by giving pollition to the instrument, to spread the readings over the graduaticn. .Although the principle of repetition is an elegant one, in practice it has been found to introduce a new sonree of error, namely, a constant error depending on the necessary imperfection of the clamping au!l general instability of the instrument. Unless the clamps arc perfect, repeating will introduce e. constant error, which cannot be eliminated from the result. l>y the forward and backward movement of one circle upon the other, and the observer should carefully test whether or not hi11 pointing will be preserved when repeatedly clamping and unclamping; this especially applies to the clamps upon which the movement of the inner circle depends, (for repeaters.) The clamps sbonld never be at the circumference of the circle of graduation, bnt near the axis, unless for inferior instruments. Before observing its general stability, the clamping-appo.ratus should bfl examined as well as the proper amount of friction of the moving parts and the balancing of weights. Instruments with light BJ.!Okes to their a.zimuthcircles, (though they may otherwise be high or thick enough,) and having a heavy superstructure, (vertical circle and counterpoise,) frequently show so much flexure or spring ll8 to affect injmiously all horizontal mi!asures, while solid and thin pla.tes are not I iable to this defect.

In behalf of the Department of Docks, I would inquire if the aforesaid report was designed to bear the wide interpretation reflected in the order from tl.te honorable board abo\'e named, a11d, if not, whether you would be willing to designate localities where deposits might be malle without detriment to navigation now and hereafter. I would suggest that if no posith'e conclnsion cau he at once reaclled as to a proper site, those points which appear to you least o\Jjectionable might he stated, and maue use of at once by 1Yay of experiment; the action of waves and currents being studied from tlay to day, uutil positi\'c information is gained as to the disposition made hy these natural agents of the material deposited. And I will further suggest that an officer of the Coast Survey, haviug the requisite experience and :your confidence, may be selected to advise in the method of obsetTing, and report upon the results from personal inspection as far as practicallle; the expenses of the work being, of course, home by this department. If not conflicting with the rcgulatious of the service, l shall be pleased if Prof. Henry Mitchell be assigned to this duty.

NEW Yomr, Ma1·ch 19, 1872. regret fo have to inform you that, after long deliberation, the pilot-comm is· sioners feel it their duty to deny your application for permission further to deposit dredgings in the waters of the port. The i·esult of the late sm'\'ey (made at the request of this board by the officers of the United States Coast Survey with special reference to this subject) showing that shoals have been formed in the channel-ways by such deposits, admonishes the commissioners that a continuance of the i1ractice will serionslJ- damage the navigation, and enforces the conviction that theJ· would but poorly perform their duty as guardians of the navigable waters of the harbor did they permit any further inroads of this nature. They must therefore adhere to their determination, already made public, to allow no deposits of any kind to be made in the waters of the port below Spuyten Duyvel Creek on the North River, or Throg's Neck on the East H.iver, nor in the bay inside of Sandy Hook. The law requires all dredgings to be placed above high-water mark, or inside of a bulkhead constructed t,o retain them for :filling in. Respectfully, by order of the board, RUSSEI,L STURGIS, Presiclent.
GENTLEMEN: I DEPARTMENT OF DOCKS OF NEW YORK CITY. JUNE 21, 1872. DEA.R. Sm: The localities selected by Captain i~atterson and myself to offer for your approYal as trial·gronnds for the deposit of dredged materials are as follows: 1st. Shore of Staten Island, within the 12-feet low-water curve, from ono mile llelo"· 1''01 t Tompkins to one mile above (northward of) the outor point of Great Kills.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

This site is on the west side of the channel, lying between West Bank and Staten Island. In this channel the scour is northward, (as in False Hook channels general1y ;) but there would seem to be Yer~· little movement of current along shore. I think the material deposited would work shore· ward under the action of wa,·es. 2d. Owl's Head, opposite quarantine, between the para11cl of quarantine and a point in Gowanus Bay, oue mile northward. I know Yer_y little of this s11ore, and would recommend a little examination before making deposits, e1en for trial. 3d. East side of Lawrence Point, (below Hell Gate.) The deposits to be made on either side (eastward or "·estward) of Barrian's Island, within the 10-feet line at low water. 4th. Sites may be found near Sunken .Meadow (below He11 Gate) and near south end of Hiker's Islanu, but would require preYious examinatiou. In recommending the alloYe, we haYe considered only physical conditions, and know nothing of the interests of shore-proprietors. The site first named seemed to us the most unobjectionable. Of course, we mention only those sites where inclosures would not seem to be necessary; there are seYeral flat spots where complete reclamation would be harmless if bulkheads were constructed. Very respectfully submitteu. H. ~HTOHELL, Coast Survey. Prof. BENJAMIN PEIRCE, Superintendent of tlie United States Coast Survey.
COAST SURVEY OFFICE, Jwne 25, 1872. in New York Harbor was a simple statement of the facts of obseryation, and I cannot be responsible for the inferences which other parties may have drawn from it, or their action in consequence of it. But I am glad at the prompt and decided action of the Board of Commissioners of Pilots for the preservation of the harbor, and it would be unbecoming in me to advise them to relax the stringency of their resolutions for any small or private enterprise. The docks are, however, essential members of the harbor, .and we must strive to relieve your department from the embarrassing position in which it is placed. It is to be regretted that any obstacle should ha\e been put in the way of your depositing your material in the locality indicated in my report, and where it would have been of such public benefit. When I heard of the decision of the Commissioners of Pilots, I anticipated the difficulties of your position, and requested Professor Mitchell to make a preliminary examination, in order to "designate localities where deposits might be made without detriment to IWYigation," which is in exact accordance with your present request. I send you a copy of his report, which reached me at the same time with your letter. Iu all other respects I shall be happy to meet your wishes, and to assign Prof. Henry Mitchell to the duty proposed by you, for which I consider him to be eminently qualified. I hope that tl1e confidence which has already been rnauifested by the Board of Commissioners of Pilots in the Coast Survey will be extended so far that they will relax their resolution so as to permit the deposits of your dredgings to be made in the localities imlicated, until there may be positive evi<lence that they are injurious and should be discontinued. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Resolution of the board of commissioners of pilots, p<Uised in New York City July 3, 1872. Resolved, That this board will not object to the deposit of dredged material by the depa.rtineut of dock>i within the 12-feet low-water curve, from one mile below Fort Tompkins to one mile northward of the outer point of Great Kills, on the west side of the channel between West Bank and Staten Island, being the place recommended by Professor Mitchell, and marked No. 1, in his communication to the Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey of June 21, 1872.

APPENDIX No. lG.
THE MIDDLE-GROUND SHOAL, NEW YORK HARBOR.

SIR: Gowan us Bay, as a feature in the Jlhysical geography of New York Harbor, owes its existence to causes which antedate, perhaps, all those in action at this day. It appear8 to be the submarine inolongation of a depression which may be followed back some distance into the uplands. It is, in fact, a little .f)cn-d, and, like all similar basins, it has been filling up with dcl>ris waslied from tlm bills by the rains aml brought in from the outside by waves and tidal currents, for, nobody knows, how many centuries. A glance at our earliest surrnys shows that tlle more slleltered portions of this bay had been already converted into salt-marsh, and all of it had received enough deposit to conceal the original form of tlrn bottom, aud to replace all irregular features by a smooth covering of mud and sand. This bay is naturall~- sheltered from the currents which ftow in and out of the North and East Rivers, but not equally so as respects the ebb and flood. The ebb is turned off by Hed Hook much more effectually than the flood is by Owl's Head, so that the latter sweeps farther into the bay than the former. The consequence of this is, that a shoal appears t·xteuding southward from the Yicinity of Red Hook, which occupies the neutral ground betweeu tue main channel, wllere the ebb pre,·ails, and the Gowanus Bay Cltannel, where the flood bas tile stronger flow. This shoal, which is known as the Middle Ground, belongs to a large class whose existence we have everywhere observed to be due to the 'ariation in the paths of ebb and ftood, to which we have referred; and this -shoal is an appendage to Rell Ilook in precisely tLe same sense that the west bank is an appendage to the point of Staten lslanrl, or as the False Hook is to Sandy Hook, or as the Middle Ground of :\Iartha's Vineyard Sound is to 'Yest Chop. That our observations might show the conditions under which the shoal f\xists, we arranged our stations in pairs at the upper, middle, and lmce1' parts of the l\liddle Ground, in each case placing one station inside and the other outside of the shoal, (see Sketch No. 22,) and made the obsen·ations simultaneously. The three tables given below are compiled from the excellent observations of )fr. ·J: B. Weir and his associates, forming the party of the schooner Bassler. We have arranged all the velocities according to lunar hours, so that pairs of stations of different dates may be compared. I especially ask your attention to these tables, and the illustration of the first of them, which appears aR Fig. 2 upon our sketch. · Let us begin with the upper pair of stations, a1 and 02. Each of them shows ebb and flood currents of very unequal velocities, but, in the pair, relatively ret'ersed-i. e., at the outside stationthe ebb is the stronger, while at the inside station it is the flood that predominates. If, for instance, you trace off one of the curves of Fig. 2, and a1)ply it, re\·ersed, to the other, you will be struck by the correspondence : you may almost replace the ebb of one of the stations bj' the flood of the other, and vice versa. The mean velocities of Table No. 1 stand, for the outside station, 0.86 ebb against 0.40 flood; and, for the inside station, 0.37 ebb against 0.74 flood. Could anything, dependent upon obser,ations from the deck of a vessel, come out closer~ The miudle pair of stations, being farther apart, do not present so close an agreement by inversion: the outside station gh·es 0.86 ebb, against 0.48 flood; while the insil1e station gives 0.44 ebb, against 0.51 flood. The third pa.fr gives \·elocities slightly favoring the ebb at both stations; this portion of the shoal, however, lies below the wateM;tratum observed npon. (We employed logs drawing about ten feet.) Now, for all materials which are not suspended by the currents, like sand for instance, the currents obser'"ed during a half tidal day may be regardetl as simultaneous forces, because a grain of sand during au entire ebb is not rolled so far as to fall among drifts that essentially differ from those which. started it; therefore we should expect to find-and, as far as I know, 1ce invariably do find-a shoal wherever the ebb and flood are equal and opposite force!'!.

REPOHT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

.As long ap;o as 1857 I showed that the shoals of New York lfar la,Y iu districts where tbe resultants of the tidal currents composed for a tidal day from observations made every fifteen minutes were zel'O. Tbe only difficulty I had in i·edncing the whole har to a mere inoblem in mecbauics lay in the fact that I had HO means of measuring tl1e forces of the waves, which at some exposed poiuts played apparently a prominent part. To return to onr proper subject: between the stations of our "upper'' and "middle" pairs, respectively, there must in each case be a point where the ebb and flood currents are exactly equal, i.e., where there is no resultant force to carry away the material which is prone to roll along the bottom. 'l'hc Middle Ground Shoal may be a deposit-it has that general appearance-but its existence would be quite as well accounted for by the currcnt-obserYations giycu allo,·c, if we considered it the remainder of a wasted island. 'l'he pier extended southward from Red Hook by the Erie Basin Company has not, th~,t I can discover, disarranged the proper order of the currents; but I think any extension from this structure to the westward would bring about considerable changes, which, while they might not be generally injurious to the harbor, woulcl change the accustomed paths of vessels seeking the docks, &c., of Gowanus. Since, as we have said above, the Middle Ground is a tlepeudence upon Hed Hook, which creates the shelter under which it has formed or continued to exist, you should oppose, I thiuk, any extension of this Hook, fearing tlrnt an increase of the shoal, aml a consequent diminution in the width of the main channel, might be the result. The o:urvey of Gowanus Bay, which I trano:mit, was executed during the pasJ, seaRou, principally at the expense of your board, by Mr. F. F. Nes and Mr. F. "~. Dorr, assistants of the Coast 8urvey; the former having ~xecuted the hydrography, which was very much the more laborious part, aml the latter the shore-lines. As both of these gentlemen are accomplished officers of the service, I feel a good deal of confidence iu the chart they haYe made. I regret that I ha,-e no draughtsman to make a fair copy for your use. Yery respectfully, sours, HBNRY .MITCHELL, Chief of Physical Hydrography, United Slates Uoast Surrey. Prof. BENJAMIN PEIRCE, Supe1·intendent of the U11ite<l States Coa.st Surve.IJ.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX :Yo. 17.
REPOHT ON SHORE-LINE C'IIAXGES AT EDGARTO\VN HARBOR, MASSACHUSETTS, BY H. L. WHITING, ESQ., .ASSISTANT IN THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

BOSTON, 1\IAss., .Tanuary, 1873. Sm: In compliance with your iustruct,ions of 18th of July last, I proceeded to Edgal"to'lfn, J\Iartlia's Yineyard, to make a survey of the changes in the topography of the harbor for the purpose of comparing the results with those of my former surveys of this locality, and, in connection with the physical surveys of Professor l\Iitchell, to ascertain, if possible, the eftect of these changes upon the barhor. The comparison of the sun-eys just made with those of pnffious dates, 1846, 1854, 1855, aud 1856, gidng interntls of fifteen aud twe11ty-five years, affords data for most interesting study, and gives an accmate exhibit of the action of waves and currents along this section of the coast. In his former and late report:;, Professor :Mitchell bas stated the p!lculiar physical relation of the tides of the Yineyanl and X antncket Sounds to those coming upon the south sllores of the islands of Martha's Yineya.rd a11c1 Nantucket, and the circulation of currents through Edgartown Harbor, and the former openiug in Cotamy Beach. I will uot, t!Jerefore, disruss these snl\iects in my report, lmt merely give their effects as they appear. At the time of my first sun·ey iu 1846, the opeuing through Cotawy .Beach was at the eastern corner, so to speak, of the ha.,y, hut not beyond the southwestern point Of Chappaquiddick Island; in fact, the inlet mts formed by this point of' Chappaquiddick and the east eml of the heacb, and was about ~,ooo feet in width. ·within the opening, however, were two small sand-islands, with channel-wass bet"·een a11d on eitber side of them. This condition of the inlet corresponded, in its general location and width, to that suown on the maps of Des Barres of 1776. In 1856, I was onlered by Professor Bache to make a resurvey and examination of this same locality, in order to determine the position and dimensions of the new opening which was reported to have been made b;r a then recent storm. By tuis suryey I found great changes bad taken place since 1846. The old inlet had worked about one mile to the eastward of its former site, aud the point of the beach had lapped by the end of Chappaquiduick oYer lialf a mile. The shore of this island, along its southwestern face, hail washed awa.'- to the extent of ahout 2,300 superficial feet. Thi8 action had changed the charact!'l" and capacity of the inlet from a broad opening of' 2,000 feet, directly opposite the waters of tile bay, to a much narrower channel confined lletween tile fast land of Chappaquiddick and the beach. This water-way between the ocean and the bay was about 3,000 feet in length and about 500 feet in width. The new inlet had hroken open about opposite the middle of the bay, and was, at the time of my survey, (1856,) about 1,400 feet in width; thus restoring the total inlet-capacity, i:;o far as widtll was concerned, to nearly that of the old inlet of 1846. Since 18M, we have had no determination of the lleach until the surveys made last summer, when it was found to extend across the entire south front of the bay with no opening into the ocean. We have, howe"\er, quite reliable local information concerning the intermediate changes, from which we have obtained the following general facts. Soon after the "\Vest Opening," so called, of 1856 was formed, the" East Opening'' closed, anil the new west opening, following the law of motion which seems to govern all the inlets on the south side of the island, began its movement eastward, continued until it reached the site of the former inlet of Des .Barres, and of tbe Coast Sur\'ey of1846, passed on to the site of the inlet of 1856, an<l still continued working eastward, until the point of beach forming its outer chop reached a point in line with the general trend of the east shore of Chappaquiddick. Here the rapid tidal currents of Muskeget Channel checked its further progress. For a time the tidal currents into and out from

Uotamy Bay battled with the sea-dash upon the shore, the latter gradually gaining ground upon tlte current-power, crowding the beach farther and farther toward the mainland of Chappaquiddick, and narrowing the water-way between them, until, at the occurrence of a storm and tide, fa\·oring the action, the most easterly portion of the heaclt was beaten in upon the island by the ocea11-wayes, aml the inlet closed. This happened in 18G!I, since which time the beach has remained intact, and all the action and influence of a southern inlet connecting the waters of the ocean and the sound t!Jrongh the channels of Edgartown Harbor and Ootamy Bay bas ceased. There is the tradition of a continuous beach, and the closing· of all inlP!R, as at present, in Urn early part of thi,.; century, and that people passed with teams from thl' main island to Chappaquiddick, but that the link was only temporary, a n~w opening breaking through the beach again i11 a few months after it was closed. \Vith this exception, tl1cre is no record or tradition of the 11011. existence of an inlet through Uotamy Beach since thi,.; section of the coast has been known. It is an interesting and important fact that we are ahle RO accnratl'l_y to 1ld,c·rmiI1c Urn exteut and nature of the cl1auges which have occnrre<l iu this locality within the last twenty-five years, particularly in this lwiwh, which is a type of many others along th(· sandy portions of our sea-coast, and presents much t!Je same harrier against the encroachment of tl1e sea, preventing the wasting action of storm-wa,·es from extending into hays, lagoons, antl ponds. The length of Ootamy Beach from east to west is about three and a half miles, aud its ayerage width about 450 feet. As shown h.r m,y first and last snn·eys, this beach Jrns l>eeu beaten hodil.r northward a 1listance about eqnal to its width. As this beach has re-formell its general 11atnral slopes while changing its position, we find a present depth of al.Jont 8 feet below high water owr the area occupied by the beach itself in 18!6, aud also a corresponding deptb in tl.te insi!le of tlrn beach; so that in determining the amount of sands which liaYe beeu mo\-ed we must take them from a,bm·e the plane of about 6 feet below high water. 'l'he average hl'igl1t of the bench ahO\'e high water is aliont 8 feet. This gh-es a gross amount of aliout 11 G/i00,000 cubic feet. In otller words, a bank, or mole of sand, 18,1300 feet in length, 4li0 feet wide, aml 14 feet high, containing 116,550,000 cubic feet, has been beaten iu upon the bay and sbOl'e hy the steadil.v encroaching action of the ocean-waves in a period of twents-fixe ;\·ears, a distm1ce of 4.:JO feet. This is not, a case of any great convulsion, or powerful current-action. It is but, a, fair illnstratfon of the gra!lnal but increasing 11,aste which is going ou upon such sltores. Tbe island of Martl1a's YinP.yard was probably Yisited, and even Rettled upo11, bs the early colonists. How great must be the contrast of the present shores with tbost~ they then explored, when we consi1ler that, according to the ratio of change, Cotamy Beach must then have been 4).JOO feet to seaward of its present line! In extending my surve;\· west'IYard from Cotamy, along the main shore of the island, I found the same encroachment of the ocean going on. Two ponds of some acres in extent, and ha,ving local names, were, at the time of my survey of 1846, about 450 feet back from the shore-line. These ponds are now entirely ohliterated. The site of one is now occupied by the sand-hills of thti heacL, wllile a small tract of marshy ground marks the inner borders of tlie otlwr. 1 found no important changes in the inner shores of Ootamy Bay, or at points not under the immediate inflnence of the ocean-forces. With regard to the question of opening Cotamy Beach by artificial means, and thus restoring the former regimen of the bay and harbor, there seems bnt one answer to be girnn: it should be done at once. The great value of Edgartown Harbor is for shelter, and tbe only pei:frct shelta, within reach uf the crowd of ·essels sometimes caught by bad weather in the dangerous approaches to Cape Cod. The importance cannot be questioned of an inlet or passageway from the harbor soutl1ward for the smaller: piiot-boats, which in ce-rtain winds and storms can safely and quickly reach vessels needing a pilot oft' Muskeget Channel, through a soutfiern inlet, when it would be impossible for them to rouncl Oape Poge, or reach the ground of danger by any other route. The \a1uable fishing-interests of Edgartown and its vicinity, now seriously affected by the loss of this safe and direct pathway to the fishing-grounds; call for action and relief in the matter of thiR closed inlet.

IrnPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The most fa>orable point at wl1icl1 to re-open Ootamy Beach seems to be at or near the west cnu or head of the bay. The arguments in favor of this location are as follows: 1st. The greater length of time that the inlet will probably remain open, assuming that it will move from west to east as faRt, and close aR soon after reaching its eastern limit, aR in former instances. !ld. 'fhe fact that this contracte(1 spctiou of the bay, by confining the tidal currents between the mainland of the island and the beach, as the currents fl.ow to and from the actual inlet, f~vors the formation and maintenance of a channel through the shoal ground bordering the beach, into tbe deeper waters of the bay. 3d. Bconomy in catting through the beach, afl the cross-Rection at this point is about the minimum. Although an ope11ing through the hmch sufficient to merely start the water, if made at tbe time predicted by Professor Mitchell, may, and probably will, create a natural inlet, for the physical demands required by tidal circulation through the harbor; still, the uncertainty of a single tide doing tlie required work. aml the contingency of au inten·ening storm or ocean swell preventing the contitrned a('tiou of the succt>eding tide, renders the scheme of depending upon the scouringpower of the tiilt> alone, a questionable oue, unless accompanie<l by a prepared patl1way for it as far throngl1 the heach as practicable, and of snch a width as shall at once secure, when opt>m"d, a stream of comdderahle ,-olume. Apart fro!ll the ph,vsical importance all(l effect of opening an inlet through t.lrn ontf'r beach, there are difficulties of naYigation, which such an inlet, only, would not relieve. A.s seen 011 the map, or sketd1, (No. 2.1,) wbieb Professor Mitchell and myself jointly append to our reports, there is a range of shoal g-round bordering the heach and extending from east to west along tbe entfre l'ionth front. of th·~ hay. Proi'Pl'il'ior l\litehell bas stated in his report that this Rhoal gronu<l has inl'rt>ased witbiu the la>it fifteen rears hy t11e amount of abont 1,000,000 cubic ~-ar<ls. Tl1isi coi11ci1lPl'i with the popular opinion of the constant accumnlation of material upon tbiR ground, which i;.; now so extensi\'e aud RO shoal tliat it is difficult for tbe peculiar class of boats n·qnirell for the outside fishing and pilotage to cross it; in fact, they cannot do so, ex:cppt by one or t"·o tortnou8 and irn1wrfect channelR. If a channel-way through thi;.; shoal gronncl were made in connection with a new inlet through tlle hPach, it -would. of course, give gmat relief to the boating-interests, both for pilotage and fishing. Here, again, Urn \\·estern se<'.tion of tl1e bay, before alluded to, presents naturally favorable ground for such a channel, h;y improYing what was probably once a natural channel leading to some former inlet. The question of how mnch thiR pilotage and fishing-interest is worth, or what the value of the former may be to the general Recurity of na>igation, I will not presume to answer. It is not, however, an unrea11onable 111npposition that within one year from opening an inlet and making such a channel-way a vessel in distress outside may be sa>ed by a pilot reaching her through this channel, and that t11e value of the Yessel and her cargo may be worth as much, or more, than the amount it will cost to make the channel-way. This is apart from the que:stion of the saving or loss of life. In contrnction with this view of the harbor-question, and in conclusion of the general subject, I have made some estimates concerning sucl1 a channel and inlet as I have named, which I submit for yonr consideration as snggesti>e items. As a basis for the general dimensions ancl character of a channel and inlet as proposed, I have taken a width about equal to the narrowest section of the natural passage-way between the harbor and bay, which is about 300 feet. This fa not wider than desirable for a beating-channel. The depth is regulated b~" the class of boats in general use, which require about four feet atmeau Jow water. As before stated, there are, iu this part of the bay, the traces of a. former channel through this shoal. By following the general course of this old channel, and removing such portions of the shoal as in places now block it up, a passage-way 300 feet wide and 4 feet deep may be obtained by the excavation of about 4.1,000 cubic ;yarcls of the material of the shoal.

A corresponding excanition through the beach, to the leYel of mean high water only, which is probably all tbat will be needed to insure a ;::uccessfnl inlet, will require the removal of about 14,000 cubic yards of sand. As the excavation through the lJe:wh will lJe dry digging in common sand, allll the dredging through the shoal be in light sand and mud, I have assumed that the whole work will hr. below the average cost of ordinary dredging. Estimating it at 30 cents per cubic yard, it will cost $1G,500. As it m:ty be expensive to bring dredging-machines and other appliances to this rather remote locality, :tnd to gnard against contingencies which may iuterrupt the work, or ernbarraf\s its success, and thns cause incre:ised expense, I wouhl suggest as an estimate to cover and insure all tlte improvements th:tt it may lie desirable to make, in com1ection with the pn,\ject under consideration, a snm not less than $20,000. lTpon the map before referred to, which accompanies Professor Mitclteil's arnlmy report, I ha Ye sbown the outlines of the beach and inlets as they have been det.ermined by the several survess which I have made. These sun·e;rH have all been based upon the original triangulation, and referred to the same base-lines, so that the changes shown are absolute. The last survey. although not involving much detail, required considerable time aud labor in its execution. The very changes which it was its purpose to determine had canl'ed tlw. loss of all points and laud-marks aloug tile outer shore of the island, so that a new series of points, based upon the light-house and spires of Edgartown and the station on Sampson's Hill, had to be extended to the south shore of the island and to Chappaquiddick before the survey could be made. I had but a small party-organization, and am indebted to Professor ::.\Iitchell and l\Ir. l\Iariudiu for many fayorH and much assistance in the execution of my field-work.

JMPROVEMENT ON THE HIPP CHRONOGRAI'll, BY WILLIAM EL\IBECK.

SAN FHANC1Sco, CAL., October 4, 18i2. Sm: l forward to ;yon a letter and drawing of' a <levicc' by Snbassistttnt Eimbeclt for regulating the spe«'d of the Hipp ch1·0110grapl1. The adjustment of Hipp is crude, very limitcll in range, uncertain, not adjustable with i1rntrnment in motion, awl Yery annoying. This improvement is ingenious, has a wide range, and admits of adjustment while the chronograph is iu motion. I suggest liis description and drawing for an appendix to your report. I hope to further irnproYe the chronograph by placing springs iu the wheel instead of' the teeth npon which the governing spring strikes. Yours, very respectfully, GEORGE DAYID SON, Assistant in the United State8 GoW3t Survey. l'rof. BEN.TA!>IIN PEIRCE, />/uperintendent of tltc United State8 Coast Sttrvey.
DEAR

SAN FRANCISCO, UAL., September 21, 18i2. Upon experimenting with the Hipp chronograph at the observatory, station \Vashington Square, San Francisco, and finding that the adjnRtment for speed by the means pro,ided was attended with much uncertainty, trouble, and sacrifice of time; anu, that if npon repeated trials such an adjustment was finally attained, no reliance could be placed upon its constancy, it occurred to me that a better adjustment could be more readily effected if it were practicable to control the period (or number of Yihrations per second) of the governing spring. There are doubtless many contrivances for effecting this object; but of the two I ball in mind, the one represented in the accompanying diagram has been thoroughly trietl and tested, and seems to answer the intended purpose admirably. The principle inYolnd is a lengthening or shortening (within certain limits) of the governing spring. By reference to the diagram it will be seen tluit this shortening or lengthening is protlucl'd by pressing upon the goveming !:-1pring at a point, to be determined experimentally, near its fixt>d end, causing a flexure or tension something greater than that produced by tbe \'il:Jrations. Tltf', pressure upou the governing spring is effected b:( pressing from one end of a bent lever, of which half iH another spring, and the end of a fine screw, with milled head, presses upon the spring-end ol this lever. The whole of this lever and appendages are upon a frame movable along the govem· iugspring by another screw. That the period of vibration is thus rendered controllable and adj1rnt able is in a marked degree audibl,y demonstrated by the varying pitch of the note of this Rpring ao;cending or falling as the prellsure is increased or decreased. By nlr,ring the position of the pressing point, the period of the governing spring is similarly effected, as by an increase or decrease of the pressure itself, and a desired adjustment may, therefore, thus be likewise efl'ected. But upon trial it is soon found that for a certain ampijtude of tile governing spring there exists but one point or position at which the note of the spring is rendere(l clearest, and the gearing runs smoothly and with scarcely any noise. ·with tl1is device for adjustmeut of speed attachfd, the spring-regulator, as I have called it' niay be said to be a very pert'ect one. Its action is prompt and reliable1 and can be readily made

without auy interference with the motion of the chronograph-gearing. The very disagreeable arnl disturbing, humming noise produced by the working of the Hipp g·oyernor, which has fn'que11tly and justly been pointed out as an objection or disad rnntage, is likewise greatly diminished, esp('cially for the greater speed, (one and two revolutious of tlte cylinder per minute,) where the running becomes admirably smootb 1 and the note of the governing spring clear and audibly distinct.

The inclose<l sample-sl1cets arc i11 a measure illustrative of the spe e<l controlllng 11owe1· of the device. No. 1 repreRents the speed at which the chrouograph jg usua11.\- run, or one revolution per minute. No. 2 shows two difterent s1weds, one aml two re\·olutions per minute, passing from one into the other and from tl1is again to the first. The pressure upon the gm·erniug spring requires increasing for a greater speed, and in this particnlar case two and one-quarter turns of the mille<l-heiul screw are sufficient to perfect the adjustment. The position of this screw once determined a 1111 known, any desired speed may be set, for at once. Sheet No. 3 is a doubl-speed sl;leet, or two re;·olntions of the c,Yli11der pel' miunte, used h.Y l~rofessor Davidson in receiving telegraphic signals in longitude-works. It will be obsern·d tliat all the sheets are continuous, and that the ;·arious adjustments were made without the slightl'st p1terference with the running of the chronograph. The slight periodic irregularities in the motion, indicated l\y the curvature of a line tlrrnrn through corresponding second-breaks of each minutf\ is douhtlPsH due to defect in the wheel-work. Indeed, the marked accordance existing between the time-length of each wan·, as it wem, a11Cl the time of revolution of the pulley to wbich the driving--weight is suspended, would seem to indicate that the source of this irregularity of motion lies in this 1mlle,Y, amt is probably due to eccentricity. I have not had time to -inYestigate this pulley. The point of pressure upon the goYerning spriug, when once adjusted, should remain perfectly constant. In the experiments so far made, this condition was not wholly fulfilled. Respectfully submitted by your obedient servant, WILLI.AM EIMBECK, R'llbassistant fa tile United Statf,s Coast Sui-1,ey.
