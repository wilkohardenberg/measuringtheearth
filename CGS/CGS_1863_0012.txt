REPORT.

CoAsT SnRVJ<:Y 0Fr'If'R,

lVashiwgton, D. C., December 15, 18G3. Sm: I have the honor to submit, in acc01·dance with the law and rc>gulations of the Treasury Department, my i·eport for the surveying year ending November l, 1863, and with it an engraved map showing the general progress of the work, and a manuscript map prepared at the office, in accordance with the act of Congress of March 3, 1853. The survey has been in progres8, in its field or office work, in all the States of the Atlantic and Pacific coast, upon the diminished scale of the previous year. The officers liave been. a~ hen~tofnre, detailed where they could render important sen-ice in the ~rmies and fleets of the Union, ancl in reply to application,; from the officers commanding, and of the departments. A condensed statement of the whole of the operntious of the survey and its officers will be given in the prefatory chapter of the repmt, part I, and a more detailed statement in part II of the report. The estimates for the next fiscal year are made to conform to those of the past, as haYing received the apw·oval of the 'Treasury Department, of Congress, and of the ExecutiYc. The policy of the departmeut to press forward the survey on the more exposed portions of the coast, and ·in the rivers connected with the blockades, has been carefully followed up, and aid has been rendered by reconnaissance and other operations whenever the \Var Department or the Navy Department indicated that it was desirable. These subjects will be treated in detail, and some of the acknowledgments received will he produced as showing the inciclental advantages of tl1e survey, (Appendix No. 26.) In the plan for conducting the survey, furnished by the act of Congress of l\Iarch 3, 1843, the surveys of the rivers were required to extend as far as needed by commerce or defence. The importance of the military and naval operations upon the rivers has been fully devc>loped by the war, and I have called the attention of the honorable Secretary of tl1e Trl'asury to the matter. The letter of the Navy Department, with the applications of the distinguished admiral8 who serve in North Carolina, and on the Mississippi and its tributaries, has been an additional stimulus to this undertaking. 'l'hc usefulnc88 of the rh"cr maps of the survey, though their extent towards the sources was in many cases quite inacl1·quate, has b!'en acknowleilgcd in the strongest terms by distinguished authorities and officers both of the military ancl uaval service. I should not omit to state that tl1e officers of the survey have rendered other incidental services in regard to lights, beacons, and buoys on the coast, and to certain of the tax commissioners of the Treasury Department. The regular operations have, meanwhile, been assiduously carried on, making the estimated progress in the Eastern and Middle States, and also at the South, wherever adequate protection could be had from our military or naval forces, or such protection was not needed. 'l'he Superintendent of the Coast Survey has continn!ld to serve on the Light-house Board, in the permanent commission of the Navy Department, to whom inventions submitted to the department are referred; and has served also upon several committees of the National Academy of Sciences, whose services have been asked by the departments of the government, as upon the Committee on "\Voights and Measures, and on correcting compasses of iron or iron-clad vessels-of-war. Other officers of the survey have in this connexion rendered similar services. The maps compiled at t.he Coast Survey Office for illustrating the movements of the war have been kept up to date, and their sale has reimbursed us for tl1e gratuitous supply to officers of the army ancl navy, and of the government generally.·

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

I must enrnestly comm!'nd the officers of the Coast Survey who have thrown themselves into dangerous service at tlie call of their country, and have yielded effective service in surveys and i·econnaissances, and

in cases of exigency in engineering. 'They ha Ye already received the commendation of those in who;ie regular duties and se;vices they have a~sistcd as volunteers. The city of l'hiladel1ihia, in the time of supposed danger, was indebted to several of the officers for ready, zealous, and djsinterested service, the value of which, had not the gallantry of our army relieved the city by distant operations, would have been inestimable, and which, in fact, was so termed at the time by the general in immediate command.

DIVISION OF THE REPORT.
Of the report, the first part or introduction contains a general summary of the progress of tlie year, the estimates for the next fi8cal year, and generally remarks on portions of the field and office work of particular interest. The H'ccmd dh·i:oion of the rqrnrt describet', under tlrn lieads of Rections, the work done in eacl1, its character, the 111~1·sons and vessels em11loyed, and the particulars of each survey. This part is closed by a chapter Btating in a general way the cl1aracter of work done in the office. 'l'l1c Appendix contains geueralize<l lists of the surveys of the year, of tlie developments in hydrogra11hy, and special liMs sl10wing the details of work in the office. Besides these, are included in it articles of scientific import. 'l'he items are classed under different heads, and the title of each given u_nder its proper heading in a 8eparate index. · An abstract of the contents of the report and an alphabetical index are given as usual.
GENEl:AL STATEl\IENT

OF PROGRESS.

The general progress made in the survey is shown by the sketcl1, No. ~9, which accompanies this report. The progreos of the iwesent year in field and office work will be here presented in a condensed fh, the statements in detail being given in the second part of the report as heretofore. In the northern sections of the Atlantic coast the regular work of triangulation has been carried on, reaching from l\facl1ias into Passamaquoddy bay, on the coast of Maine, under Sub-Assistant Webber; from Blue Hill bay towards :\ft. Desert, by Assistant Fairfield; and above the mouth of }>enobscot river, by Assistant McCorkle. For the connexion of primary bases, it has been continued by my own party on the coast of Connecticut; additional work to connect with it bas been done by Assistant Blunt, east of the Hudson; ancl the verification work, on the coast of New Jersey, has been extended to the vicinity of Mana8quam inlet, by Al515i11tant Farley. 'l'be detailed topography of Eastport liarbor has been prosecuted by Sub-Assistant Dennis; that of the coast of Maine, from Winter harbor eastward, by Sub-Assistant Rockwell, but discontinued to meet the call for senice near Chattanooga, 'l'ennessec. 'l'he topography of the western side of the entrance, and that of the western shore of l'enob~cot bay, near Camden, by Sub-Assi.itants Ferguson and Dorr; that of the passages between the Sheepscot and Kennebec rivers has been nearly completed hy Sub-Assistant Iardella, and the detailed eurvcy of the vicinity of Harpswell Neck, Maine, continued by AHRistant Longfellow. Assistant Harrison lias extended the triangulation required, and continued the plane-table snrvey of Narragansct bay. The shore·Iine survey of the Hudson river has been completed_ by work between Coxeaekie and Nt~w Baltimore, by the party of Messrs. Harding and Strausz, and repeated examinations have been made of Handy Hook and its vicinity fo1· physical changes, by Assistants Whitiug and Mitchell. 'l'he hydrogrtq1hy of tlrn year in the northern sections has embraced additional lines of deep-sea soundings, and the development of rocks and ledges near Portland entrance, and off the coast of Maine, by Lieut. Commander Phelps, with the steamer Corwin; that of Rockland harbor, by Assistant Edwards, (now in similar service at Cl1arleston bar, S. U.;) the in-shore hydrography, which includes the approaches to Muscongus bay and Penobscot bay, (western approach,) by Acting Assistant Cordell, with the steamer Vixen; that of the northern part of Casco bay, by Assi~tant Gerdes; that of the Hudson river, completed by the party of l\lessrs. Harding a.nd Stcauez; a development of ledges off the eastern end of Long faland, and re-examination of part of New York harbor for the pilot commissioners, by Lieut. Commander Phelps; one near the Delaware breakwater, for the engineer department, by Capt. Patterson, hydrographic inspector

of the Coast Survey; and soundings off the coast (}f Maryland, and completion of the bydrography of the Potomac river, by Lieut. Commander Phelps. Under directions of the Boston harbor commissioners, Assistant Mitchell has continuec1 the observations of tides and currents in South bay and Fort '}Joint channel, and in tho outlet~ of the Cliarles and :Mystic rivers. As during tho year previous more than the customary number of parties has worked this season on the Coast of New England and that of the Middle States, all of them having been on duty in the earlier part of the year, with but two exceptions, either in the 8ections of the coast now under blockade, or in surveys for the use of the 1umies of the Union. One of the parties not so engaged waH employed in the survey of Sandy Hook. The other had assisted in the survey of the Potomac, within the present fiscal year, fo1· the Navy Department. 'l'he several examinations made during the year at Saudy Hook are to keep in view the important changeR going on there, and which may develop into dangerous circumstances. These surveys have been furnished to the engineer department, the operations of which keep steadily in contact with the changes from time to time going on. Services having a bearing on defensive purposes, rendered to that department by three of the assi1<tauts of the Coast Survey while working this season on the coast of :Maine, have been acknowledged in communications addressed to me by the chief eugineer. The regular work has gone forward on the Pacific coast of the United States, though on a scale somewhat reduced by the peculiar circumstances of the currency there. On the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, of nineteen assistants, fourteen sub-assistants, arnl twenty-two aids engaged in field-work or in hydrography, twelve assistants, sc\·en sub-assistanti<, and ten aids have r!'ndcrml service in connexion with military and naval operations, and most of those who have so co-operated have also been employed in duty on parts of the coast where the regular operations of the survey have lrncn advanced during the latter part of the season. The work done in the vicinity of the capital, and along the southern coast, having been performed under the immediate orders of' military or naval authorities, will be briefly reviewed under a separate head.
SERVICE WITH THE ARMY AND NAVY.

Of the surveys which were steadily carried on in the vicinity of Washing ton city until the end of June, that of the banks of the Potomac near Alexandria, though specially ordered for purposes of defence, and executed by Assistant Harriwu, combines with the rf'gular work of the survey, as does also the triangulation of the river between Alexandria and Georgetown by Sub-Al:lsistant Boyd. The topography of the eastern approaches to the District of Columbia has been extended by Assistant .Adams, Suh-Assistant Ferguson, and Mr. Donn, and the survey near Fort Lyon by Assistant C. M. Bache. Suh-A11>1iRtant Boyd made a triangulation, and Mr. Donn took up the topography of the approaches to Baltimore, in the latter part of June, at the special Mii of the authorities charged with the defences of that city. This work has been suspended within a few days by the emergency which requires topographical service near Chattanooga, but will be completed as soon as practicable, as will also the. plane-table surveys in the neighborhood of Washington. The lieights of all the field-wo1·ks near the capital have been determined and furnished to the chief engineer of defences. The services at Port Royal and at the mouths of the Mississippi, referred to in my fast report, have been followed up this year in the military department of North Carolina; on the coasL of l::louth Carolina. and Georgia, particularly near Charleston, and at Tybee and W assaw; in Louisiana, west of the Mississippi; and in the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers, during the sieges of Vicksburg and Port Hud::mn. In the firstnamed department, besides the triangulation of part of Neuse river by Assistant :Fairfield, reconnaissance maps were made by Assfatant West and Sub-As1:1istant Rockwell, while the enemy threatened Newbern and Little Washington. Charleston bar was surYeyed by night, and lighted and buoyed by Assistant. Boutelle with the steamer Bibb, just previous to the naval attack of April last. Port Royal bar was res'Urveycd by his party, and the buoys needtid there and at the other entrances on the coast of·South Carolina arid Georgia wefe set, and have been properly marked on the charts which ai;e supplied from the office for the blockading squadron. A hydrographic reconnaissance was made by the ·Bibb,. in· :t>eeember, of the channel into 1Vinyah bay, under the orders of Admiral DuPont. In returning from duty at the same station, in February, the Bibb took in tow one of the steam transports of General Foster, which had· burst her boilers within twenty miles of the hostile shore, and delivered the vessel at Hilton Head. Mr. Boutelle also accompanied the

4

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDEN'I' OF

engineer of the Light-house Board for determining the aids to navigation needed for the naval service bctwc<'n Port Uoyal and St. John's river, Florida. A;,sistaut Edwards, in this section, sounded out two important brunches of the inland passage between St. Helena and Port Royal sounds; examined the channels into Tybee roads; and pushed the hydrography of \Vassaw sound, for which shore-liuc was f'urni~lied by a party under Sub-As~i~tant Dennis. J\fr. Talcott, of the topographical party, nanowly escaped capture while working on Little 'l'ybee island. Six parties were actively aud co11stantly engaged during an average pcriocl of about six months of the present surveying year on the coast of North Carolina, South Carolina, aud Georgia, and their labors arc warmly commended in communications to me from Major General Foster and Admiral DuPont. At the request of the tax: commissioners of :Florida, one of the most active of the Cuast S11rvey topographers was assigned to serve under their orders at Fernandina and St. Augustine. His services during the ensuing winter were 1irospectively called for by the commissioners, but, under a pressing call received from Chattanooga, within a few days, lie has been assigned to topographical duty for the army of :Major General Rosecrans. Three others, Assistant 'yest, Sub-Assistant Rockwell, and J\Ir. Donn, are under orders for duty there, in compliance with the application. Sub-Assistant Dorr, while in service with the tax commissioners, supervised tlJC erection of additional earthworks at Jacksonville, Florida, when that place was reoccupied by the government forces in .March last. Under the protection afforded in the vicinity of Admiral Bailey's blockading vessels, the hydrography ont~ide of the Florida keys l1as been completed within the year by a party under Acting Assistant Cordell, with the steamer Vixen. 'l'he same party sounded the main entrance and approach of Charlotte harbor. Both these surveys are in continuation of previous work, and fall into place with the regular progress of the Coast Survey. In connexion with the military and naval operations on the l\Iississippi river and in Louisiana, three topographers have served with the a1·my of Major General Banks, (A8sistant Oltmanns, Sub-Assistant Hosmer, and Mr. Lyman,) and two, Sub-Assistant J<'cndall and Mr. Strausz, under the direction of Assistant Gerdes, with the fleet of Admiral Porter, and subsequently with the army of Major General Grant. A minute topographical survey of the west bank of the Mississippi opposite to New Orleans for defensive purposes; reconnaissance maps of the middle districts of Louisiana and of the Red river as far up as Alexandria; the topograpl1y of the approaches to Vicksburg while the siege was in progress, and the survey of those of Port Hudson after tl1e surrender of that post, are part of the results of their labors. The high terms of approval used by Admiral Porter in reviewing the arduous duties and progress of the parties assigned to service with his fleet have i11duced me to renew the surveying force on the Mississippi during the coming season. Both -of the topographers before assigned kept the field until entirely disabled by sickness in the latter part of July, after the surrender of Vicksburg. Their work had been repeatedly pushed forward in the presence of the enemy, as was also that of the parties witl1 the army of General Banks. Assistant Oltmanns, on reconnaissance duty before Port Hudson, had his horse killed by a rebel shot, and previously, himself and l\ir. Lyman being on board of the gunboat Kinsman, were in imminent peril when that vessel snagged and went down in the Atchafalaya with a number of the soldiers on board. Mr. Oltmanns has continued in service in the military department of the Gulf during the entire year. l\fr. Ho~mer, having closed surveying duty assigned at the north, has been reassigned to service with the army of General Banks. These and similar arrangements are detailed in my report, together with the changes in disposition in the transfer of officers of the survey from the east and north to the south. The transfers are also shown by li:;ts in the Appendix, Nos. 27 and 28. The minute survey of the approaches to the defensive works near St. Louis, and of the ground which they occupy, has been completed, and the sheet turned in, by Assistant R. 1\1. Bache. · · During the invasion of tlie State of Pennsylvania last summer, and in view of the possible danger of the city of Philadelpl1ia, I volunteered my services, under your authority, to the governor of Pennsylvania, and, by his request, was associated with the military and civil authorities in charge of the defences, as chief engineer. The exigency was pressing, as was proved by the efforts to procure regular engineers for this work, and by the failure even to obtain officers for consultation. The character of my as~ociation, first with Major Geueral Dana, and, since August, with Major General Cadwalader, in command of the post of Philadelphia, was such as to add a relish to the labor. The circumstances of alarm, too, occasioned by the progress of the enemy, though soon passed, were attested most substantially by the number of volunteers for active tiervice from the citizens, even the reverend clergy taking part, enthusiastically, for their home defenu;

retired officers of the regular army and of the volunteers came forward with officers of the Coast Survey, those of the railroads centring at l'hiladelphia, officers and members of the municipal bodies of the city, and graduates of the institutions of learning. 'l'he surveys made under my immediate direction for the defences of Philaddphia have occupied Assistants H. L. Whiting, George Davidson, R. :M:. Bache, and C. :M:. lhche, and at th~· outset of the work, Assistants C. 0. Boutelle and P. C. :E:. \Ye,;t, the laet-nanwcl having bePn just pn~viougly in military sPrvice with the division of General W. F. Smith, at Carlisle, Peumylvania; SuL-Assi,;tant:; Il. E. Halte1·, Cleveland Rockwell, and J. S. Bradford, also assisted in the work. Having occasion to discuss the river maps extending to tide-water with one of the generals-in-chief of our armies, I received the ·gratifying assurance that he could not hav~ arranged the plans for the operations of the army without the use of those maps. This strnng expression wae coincided in by an admiral of high distinction then engaged in the interior of several adjacent States. I would propose t.o make this network of ihe rivers more complete by passing above tide-water, and by the help of obsern1tions of latitude and of telegraphic longitudes, effected partly in past years, to lay the basis for a connected map. During the progress of the year new and highly grati(ying testimonials have been spontaneously 'rendered by officers in the military and naval service to the value of the maps, charts, and memoi1·s prepared by the Coast Survey, in facilitating the important operations with which they have been charged. Naval commanders have pronounced these aids to be invaluable in promoting the efficiency of the blockade and in securing the safety of the blockading vessels; and the commanders of military departments and generals in the field have, directly and through thek engineer officers, repeatedly expressed to the Supe1;ntendent their high sense of the usefulness to their commands of the maps of their several fields of operations, which have been prepared at the office of the survey. Besides the regular publications of the survey, maps of the localities of the different expeditiom;., sieges, &c., have bmm }lrepareu for popular use. The operations just meutioned have Leen executed by the civilians of the Coast Survey; all of the naval officers but one, and all the army officers, having been detached from service wiLh us. As during last year the means of usefulness, and not the opportunities, have limited the range of our parties. No losses of vessels or other property, excepting by ordinary wear, have been encountered during the year. The two vessels seized at Charleston in the winter of 1860-'61 have, however, been destroyed; the schooner Petrel by a broadside from the United States frigate St. Lawrence, and the tender }'ire Fly by fire at Savannah.

THE UNITED STA.TES COAST SURVEY.
MAPS AND CHARTS.

7

The maps and charts published by the ·coast Survey Office, as has been explained in several of my previous reports, are of two general descriptions, which may be distinguished as preliminary and finished. The preliminary charts are those which are issued as soon after the several surveys as is consistent with accuracy of general deJineation, and are designed to supply the immediate and pressing demands of navigation. The finished charts embody all the itJformation furnished by the survey, including the minutest details, and embrace not only the bydrograpby, but the topography likewise. The two classes of charts differ in regard to the amount of the information which they furnish, but not in regard to the correctness of that which is given. The charts are various in character, according to the objects which they arc designed to serve. The most important diistinctions are the following : 1. General charts ef tlie coast, on a scale of 400\rno· for off-shore navigation. These rPpresent the shore-line, and in its characteristic featnrPs, so as to be readily recognized by tl1c navigator approaching it. The entire Atlantic and Gulf coasts will be comprehended in sixteen charts of this class. 2. Preliminar.lJ . .sea-coast clwrt.f, on a scale of :rmocf' for in-shore navigation. These will all be ultimately superseded by the more complete charts next to be named. 3. Coast charts for in shore navigation, on a scale of 80 i oll' exhibiting with minute accuracy every natural and every permanent artificial feature, above or below the water, which can be introduced without occasioning confu~iou. They exhibit, also, the topography for some distance from the shore. 4. Olwrts ef harbors, bays, anclwrages, "c., on various scales adapted to the subject; also, sketches of local dangers, &c. To the above there has been added, during the present year, upon the requeRt of the Superintendent of the Naval Observatory, a serieR of sailing charts, upon a scale of 120 i 000 , embracing tlie largel"t area of any, and designed to enable tl1e navigator to protract his course. Four of these embrace the entire Atlantic coast of the United States, with the adjacent British possessions, for the delineation of which the British admiralty charts have been made use of. 'l'he Gulf coast is contained on two similar sheets. The ;mrveys being still incomplete in some localities, the present edition of these charts, all of which are appended to this report, is necessarily a preliminary one. (Sketches Nos. lS-23.) A like series for the J'acific coast, on the same scale, in three sheets, has been published since 1855, under the title of "Reconnaissance of the "\V es tern Coast." The whole number of charts which have been engraved upon copper for publication, and which arc now in use, is three hundred and twenty-six. 'This is exclusive of twenty-four copper plates containing the progress sketches, and thirty-five plates of diairamll. Seventy-five sheetll have been worked upon in the drawing division dnring the year ending October 31, 1863. Of this number five are the sailing charts above spoken of; three are general, or off-shore charts; two, preliminary sea-coast charts; eight, finfohed coast maps and charts; twenty-six, harbor cliarts; twenty, sketches; two, sheets of diagrams; nine, maps and sketc11es for engraving on stone, or for lithographic transfer. Fifty-four sheets have been completed, and twenty-one are in progress. Of those com1lleted, six are finished harbor charts, and the others preliminary charts and sketches. In the engraving division six first clase maps and charts have been completed within the year, and nine plates of second class charts and sketches, exclusive of "three diagrams. Preliminary editions of eleven, in outline and hydrography, preparatory to their final completion, have also been engraved. Thirty-three plates are now in progress, of which twelve were commenced within the present year. 'l'ltis gives a total of eighteen plates completed, 1md thirty-three in progress, or of fifty-one plates worked upon during the year. 'l'here are, besides, in the division, seven plates in various st11ges of forwardness that have received no additions during the year, having aheady received all the material which the field-work·has yet furnished. In the lithographic division twenty-four maps or charts have been engraved or drawn upon stone; considerable additions have been made to others previously lithographed, and £fty-nine transfers for lithographic printing have been made from engravings or lithograph drawings. All the details in regard to the production and distribution of rn11ps and charts will be found in the report of the assistant in charge of the office. (Appendix No. 14.) The following list contains the titles of the maps, chart.a, and sketches, the material for whicl1 is in the office, and which are h1tended to accompany this report, with the exception of such of their number as the

DISTRIBUTION OF MAPS AND ANNUAL REPORTS.

During the year there lias been a total distribution of volumes of the reports on the Coast Survey, amountiug to 6,124 copies. Thie embraces reports of all years from 1851 to 1861, inclusive. .A. limited foreign distribution haR been made of t11e volumes for 1859 and 1860, through the Smithsonian Institution. Tlte total number thus sent abroad amounts to 33:.J for each year. It is proper to remark, in making this statement, that the maps and sketches originally designed to be appended to the volumes mentioned, in so far as they relate to portions of the coast under blockade, have been withheld from the copies distributed. There remain on hand at present, of the report for 1861, only 137 copies; of that for 185.5, 344 copies; and of that for 1857, 252 copies. Of the reports for other years the numbers exceed five hundred each, and for the last three years are upwards of two thou1:1and. During the year there have been distributed to libraries and other permanent institutions in different parts of the United States more than fifty copies of the volumes, of which tlie impressions are now most nearly exhausted, in order to complete sets which may be accessible to the public, at as many convenient points of the country as possible. Of maps, charts, and sketches, about forty-six thousand have been distributed within the year. In this aggregate are embraced not only the publications strictly nautical, bnt also those maps and sketches of portions of the coast, and .occasionally of the interior, as were likely to promote the successful prosecution of the important operations in which tlie navy and armies of the country l1ave been engaged. The details in regard to the distribution of reports, maps, charts, etc., will be found in the report from the miscelianeous division of the office. (Appendix No. 14.)

ESTIMATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1864-'65.

The estimates for the present fiscal yt>ar, to which the appropriations corresponded, were much diminished from those of 1860-'61 and 1861-'62, being $306,000 for all the branches of service on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts. 'l'he estimates now submitted agree with the sums appropriated last year, and will enable us to continue the field and office work on the same reduced scale; to keep up the organization of our trained officers in field and office operations ; to put into practical form, for the use of the departments and officers of the government, the infonnation already collected; to continue the office compilations for use by the fleet~, armies, and expeditiorn;, and the publication of such maps as gf'nf'ral public interests may render desirable or expedient, and to provide for the assignment of special parties, as heretofore, with your concurrence, when such parties can be useful, as the experience of the past two years shows they have been, in service with the fleets and armies. The estimates for progress on the .Atlantic, Gulf coast, Florida reefs, and western coast of the United State8, are given as usual, in separate items, and are exclusive of the aid formerly, but not uow, extended for the work, by the detail of officers of the army and navy.

DEVELOPMENTS AND DISCOVERIES. Closer research than would be probably required for the in-shorn hydrography of any part. of the Atlantic coast south of New England, has developed the positions of a number of rocks near the approaches to Portland harbor. These, with other determinations of the same kind, a.re referred to below in geograpl1ical order. The general list of developments and dii;coveries, made in the progress of the hydrography in previous years, is given in Appendix No. 4. Those for the present year are as follows: l. The examination of the channels leading into Carver's harbo1", (Penobscot bay,) with reference to the positions of rocks and Rhoa.ls dangerous to navigation. 2. A dangerous ledge, determined in position, with only eleven feet at mean low water, two miles west of the north end of Metinic falanil, month of Penobscot bay. 3. Determination in position and depth of ten rocks near the approaches of Portland harbor, and of a spot with only fourteen feet water on Bulwark shoal; on Witch rock, twenty-four; on Corwin rock, twentyfour and a half; on :Mitchel rock, thirty-one; on Willard rock, thii-ty-one and a half; on Bache rock, thirtytwo feet; on Round rock, thirty feet; on Old Anthony, or Vapor rock, twenty feet; on the Western Hueand-Cry, twenty-seven and a half feet; on West Cod ledge, thirty-four feet; and on East Cod ledge, fort.ynine feet. 4. Several dangerous rocks and ledges developed in the approaches of Sippiea.n harbor, (Buzzard's bay,) and others inside of the harbor. 5. Development of a ledge, (Great Eastern ledge,) off Montank Point, having at one point only tweutyfour feet at mean low water, and at another twenty-seven feet. 6. Development of shore-line and hydrographic changes at Sandy Hook, with reference to the effect of the great storm of January, 1863. 7. The alteration of shore-line and sea encroachment near AhE<ccom light-house, coast of New Jersey. 8. Development of hydrographic changes at the Delaware breakwater. 9. Special survey of part of League island, Delaware river, and comparison of changes with previous eurveys. 10. Examination of soundings eastward of Winter Quarter shoal, to determine the alleged existence of a second shoal. IL A shoal found with only fourteen feet of water, S. by E. J1 E., and distant ten and a lialf miles from Cape Lookout light-house. 12. Development ·in position of the point, with only twenty-one feet at mean low water, of Noonday

SPECIAL SURVEYS.

1. The surveys of Boston harbor, under the United States commissioners, and at the expense of the city, have made good progress, the resurvey of the outer harbor liaving been completed by ~Ir. Boscl1ke and his assistants, and the survey of the South bay being now in l1and. The subject of drainage of the city and districts adjacent has been investigatecl, with results which will lay the foundation of an excellent system. 'l'he maps are now drawing by Mr. Boschkc . .Assistant Henry Mitchell has completed his useful series of experiments on tides and currents in the upper harbor of Boston, and has continued his investigations in Fort Point channel and South bay. 2 . .Assistant Henry L. Whiting made special examinationR, for the United States engineer department, of several islands and sites along the coast, from Rhode Island to Maryland, and a report, all of which was acceptable to the chief engineer. 3. Resurveys, including the shore-line and hyclrography of the Yicinity of Sandy Hook, were mil.de; the former, by Assistant H. L. Whiting, in November and December, 1862, and the latter by Aesistant Henry Mitchell, in June and July of the present year, the great storm of January last having inundated a considerable part of the surface of the hook. The hydrographic resurvey em braced the False Hook cliannel north of the Oil spot, and about a mile ancl a half of the main sliip channel abreast of the hook, including also Flynn's knoll and 1mundings along the western side of the hook. 4 . .An examination was rnacle by Lieutenant Commander Phelps, United States navy, commanding the steamer Corwin, at the request of the pilot commissioners, to ascertain whether the material from the dredging of the slips at New York had caused any changes in the main ship channel. .5 . .A special survey of Absecom inlet, on the shore of New Jersey, has been commenced at the request of the president of the .Atlantic Railroad Company, and in reference also to the safety of the light-house at Absecom inlet, which the changes of the entrance were supposed to have, perhaps, endangered. 6. Hy request of the United States chief engineer a resurvey of the Delaware Breakwater harbor has been made, and the chart has been furnished to the engineer department. A few changes in the depth of water were found. These, though not sufficient to alter the chamcter of the harbor, may be of great importance in regard to the permanent condition of the breakwater itself. 7. The upper part of League island, in the Delaware, was surveyed for purposes of comparison last winter, and the channel which passes behind it sounded at the reqnPst of the Navy Department. 8 . .A special reconnaissance of the approaches to the city of Philadelphia has been macle, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, on the north side of the city, from the Delawotre to the Schuylkill, by .Assistant George Davidson, of the Coast Survey, and on the west side, from the Schuylkill, near Conshohocken, to the mouth of the river, by Asi:dstant H. L. "\Vhiting. A portion of the latter district, from the Falls of Schuylkill to Fort Miffiin, near the river bank, was examined by Assistant R. M. Bache, who also planned and erected several small redoubts and batteries; aided by :i\>Ir. R. E. Mc:l\Iath. Assistant C. 0. Boutelle also planned an earthwork near Hestonvi11e.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Mcintyre. Sub-Assistant R. E. Halter made a survey along the Schuylkill, near l<'airmount, connecting with another made by Mr. Edwin Hergesheimer, of tl1e drawing division of the Coast Smvey Office. Mr. Hergesheimer was aided by Mr. W. E. Weber. I was in charge of tlie surveys and works under the general direction of the mavor and Committee of Defence of the councils of. Philadelphia; first under General X . ·T. T. Dana, major· general commanding the post under Major General Couch, comnrnn<liug the military department, and next under J\Iajor Geneml George Cadwalarler. To both of these officers I feel mucl1 iuclchted for their interest in the matter, and for their courtesy to me personally, and to my assistantB, and their kind aid rendered on every occasion.
TIDE TABLES FOR MARINERS.-TIDES AND CURRENTS.

The tide tahles for the use of mariners are contained in Appendix No. 12. Eastport, Maine, has been added to the list of stations given in Table I. Tidal observations have been continued at four rpgnlar stations on the Atlantic coast, but have not been resumed at either of the stations of the coast no~· under blockade. :From the officer who is now provost marshal at Brashear City, Louisiana, it has been ascertained that the tide-gauge which was delivered to his predecessor, and who had advised us of the delivery, cannot now be found. The probable conclusion is, that the instrument was destroyed or carried off in the summer, when that post was temporarily in possession of the enemy, whose advance was made soon after the provost marshal had been requested to forward the instrument to Washington. Some special remarks on the character of the currents of New York harbor will be found in the second part of the report, under the head of Section II.
INFORMATION FURNISHED.

The information furnished from the office in reply to special calls, and generally in the form of tracings from the original sheets of the survey, is !ltated in the form of a list in Appendix No. 2. Since the commencement of the rebellion, much the larger part of the matter so furnished has been for the use of the army and navy. The applications from civil life are complied with under the sanction of the 'l'reasnry Department, and on the condition that due credit is given to the government in any publication of the material obtained from the office.
STATISTICS.

The table of statistics has been added to so as to bring it up to the present surveying year, and is given in Appendix No. 3. Up to 1862, inclusive, the triangulation has covered an area of about sixty-two thousand six hundred square miles, extending along a general coast-line of nearly forty.seven hundrnd miles, and developing a shore-line, reckoniug the river indentations, of twenty-four thousand miltes, by the determination of nine thousand nine hundred geographical positions. ]for latitude observations one hundred and twenty-nine stations have been occupied, for longitude eighty-five, and for azimuth eighty-six station8. The topography had extended over an area of seventeen thousand three hundred square miles, having a general coast-line of forty-two hundred miles, and a shore-line of over forty-three thousand three hundred. The hydrography extended over an area estimated at forty-six thousand five hundred square miles, in which nearly two hundred and five thousand miles were run in sounding, six million seven hundred and eighty-four thousand casts of the lead were taken, and over eighty-four hundred specimens of bottom collected. Tpe number of manuscript maps and charts was twenty-two hundrtd and seventy-four, and of engraved maps, charts, and sketches, five hundred and seven. The combination of several for publication in one sheet, a11d transferc of material for new editions, have considerably lessened this aggregate of the engraved plate 5 ·
TOPOGRAPHICAL AND HYDROGRAPHIC SHEETS.

The titles of the topographical and hydrographic sheets registered at the office since 1861 are given in Appendix Nos. 15 and 16. Of the entire number l!eventy-one are plane-table sheets, and sixty-one are origin4l hydrographic charts. 'I'he list containing the titles is in continuation of previous ones which have been published with my report biennially since 1857. The scale of each survey is stated in the lists.

During the past year the q>hemcridcs of the moon for all the occultations of tl1c Plciades, from 1838 to 1842, have been complctccl by Profeiisor Benjamin Pehcc, and verified by a duplicate computation by :M:r. C. S. Peirce. The remainder of the work has also been completed for three occultations, t110sc of April 13, 1842, of January 21, 1842, and of St~ptember 6, ] 84 l. All the other oceultations'Will be finiEhcd in the course of the coming year, at the rate of about one in a month. The report of Professor Peirce, on the occultations of 1841-'<12, is given in the Appendix, (Xo. 17.) A part of the computations connected with the mctl10d of <letermining longitmlc hy occultations of the Pleiades l1as been made in the office, under the charge of A~sistant Schott, two computers being ~o engaged since the 1st of November. The series undertaken comprise the observations made between the beginning of tl1e year 1856 and the end of 1861, and are to be reduced 11ceording to the plan lnid out by Professor Peirce, 11nd under his supervision. The necessary revisions arc made by the chief of the computing division.
COllPUTATIONS OF LONGITUDES.

Tlie computation of the longitudes obtained by telegraph observations has been continued by Dr. Gould tluough the last year. The longitudes of i>eYen places have been deduced from observations made at stations on the line 1-Vilmington-New Orleans. The details of results are given in Appendix No. 18. A curious series of facts in regard to a diurnal movement in azimuth, of the transit instrument, was noticed in Dr. Gould';: last report, and is discussed in Iii,; report for tbis year. The labor expended on the determinations of right ascensions appears fully justified by the observations of the past year, in which these results were used. 'l'he preparation of a list of declinations for the time stars has made considerable progress.
:M:AGNETIS'.1:1.

The series of papers on the results of the di8r:ussion of magnetic observations made at Girard College, Philadelphia, from 1840 to 1845, and now beiog publi8hcd by the Smithsonian Institution, is continued tliis year by the insertion of Parts V lI, VII I, and IX, which contain the investigation of the vertical component of the magnetic force. As these discussions arc very similar to those of the horizontal component given last year in Part!" IV and V, but little adilitional explanation is needed in regard to their method. l'art VII commences with the discussion of the effect of temperature UJJOll the readings of the magnetometer, and the reduction of the observations to a uniform temperature, (66° Fahrenheit,) and then the progresaive and apparently irregular changes in the readiugs of the instrument are inquired into. Peirce'i:l criterion was applied, as in the former papers, for the recognition and separation of the disturbances. The limit found was thirty scale divisions. 'l'h<' existence of the eleven-year period, iu the amplitude of the diurnal variation of the vertical force; is prnved, and the force found greatest between 1 p. m and 2 p. m., and lea.'lt between 8~ p. m. and 10~ p. m. The investigation proceed8 with a general analysis of the disturbances, showing their dependence in number and amount on the eleven-year period. Their annual and diurnal inequality are also shown. 'l'he months of greatest disturbance are :March and September, the least disturbance being in June. 'l'he greatest number of disturbances occurs about 1 a. m., and the least number at 10 a. m. There is, however, a secondary period in each case. In these inquiries, the disturbances which increase the force, and those which diminish it, are separately examined. The paper concludes with a classification of the disturbances according to their magnitude. To this paper is added a discus8ion of the effect of the brighter auroras upon the magnetic declination, and upon the horizontal and vertical forces. Each account of an aurora is specially collated with the corresponding observations of the magnetic elements. The apparent effect of the aurora upon each of the magnetic elements is stated in tabular form. Part VIII treats of the solar diurnal variation, and of the annual inequality of the vertical force: also, of the semi-annual inequality of the diurnal variation, and of the diurnal range of the same. The greatest diurnal variation occurs about I:! p. m., and the lea.st about 10 p. m. with indications of a B\'eondary maximum and minimum. At 5! a. m. and 7 p. m. there is no change in the diurnal variation throughout the year. 'l'he force nlso u11peart1 to be greatest in May, June, July, and August. 'l'lH' results arc expm::1scd in part analytically, and in part graphically.

The full papers will be found iu the Appendix Nos. 19, 20, and 21, and the illustrative diagrams in Sketch No. 30. Part IX contains the investigation of the lunar influence upon the vertical force, and on the inclination and total force. Tl1e method of iuvestigation being precisely the same as that purrnecl in the investigation for the horizontal force, uo furthe1· explanation is here required. In tracing out the lunar effect upon the vertical force, we have to contend with greater irrPgulm·ities tlian were experienced in the preceding case of the other component, a large share of which is probably due to the great ternpmature reductions required for the magnet. ln all, 19,1513 obscr,·ations have been diseusse<l and arranged for inquiry, 9,7Hl belonging to western, and 9,794 to eastern hour anglecl of the moon. A separation of the results for winter and summer season was found impracticable owing to the shortness of the whole series. The lunar diurnal variation, pre~ented analytically and graphically, shows a double crested curve, with a principal maximum a little before the upper culmination, and a principal minimum, about 3~ hours after the lower culmination of the moon; the average epoch of the vertical force tide is, therefore, about 1;! hour apparently iu advauee of the culminations. 'l'he secondary wave is very feeble, its greatest value happens about nine hours, westeru hour angle, and its lca11t value about three hours before, giving a range of nearly a tenth part of the principal range, which fa 0.000027 part~ of the force. The suhject of the epochs of the lunar diurnal variation is yet very imperfectly brought out, and mnre obHerYatiom< are tle8irable. 'l'he 'I'oronto and Philadelphia curves are also examined and their accordances or differences stated. Tlie lunar dfect upon the inclination and total force is olitained by a proper combination oft.he horizontal and vertical components of the force. For the ineliuation we have maxima at 8!t. and 20/t. (prineip1tl ;) minima at 31t. (principal) and 13?ilt.; total ran~e, :1. 116. The l'hihdclpbia and Toronto curves arc remm·kably accordant. J<'or the total force we have maxima at -:F/,· (principal) and l lh., minima at 7,pt. and 177t. (principal;) total range, 0.000026 parts of the fo1·ce. The ordinary observations for the determination of the magnetic elements along our eai;tern Atlantic coast have been prosecuted by Assistant Charles A. Schott, who occupie<l nine stations in .July last. Assistant G. '\V. Dean also observed at two of tl1e primary stations. 'l'he results found arc presented in Appendix No. 22. Observations bave been continued at Eastport, Maine, and at Key '\Vest., Florida. As heretofore the observations arc made near the middl<~ of each monLh of the year for the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. At Key '\Yest, in addition to these, a continuous rl'corcl of the three magnetic elements is kept up by photographic self-regiHtering instruments. At the request of the Navy Department observations were instituted last spring, by a committee of the National Academy of Science, on the deviation of compasses on iron and iron-clad vesi;els in the government service. The following is a brief account of work done under my immediate direction for the compass committee since June last. Four magnetic surveys were made of two vessels, viz: of the Unit.ed States steamer Roanoke, (iron plated and turretted,) and of the Ericsson battery Passaic, (iron vessel with turret.) Another ve8sel, the llfurwdnock, was also visited, but was only partially examined, as only part of the armor was in place. Four reports l1ave bemt submitted by AsEistant Charles A. Schott, to whom this work was intrusted. 'l'he special points embraced in the rqmrts are the following: First, the local deflections of the needle on board of the Roanoke (at tlie Brooklyn navy yard) were aiicertained at nine stations of equal elevation above deck, and a curve of no deviation was located. Some experiments were made as to the height above deck and above turret, at which the local deflection woulcl disappear. At the same deck stations the horizontal magnetic force was measured, afao the total force, both in connexion with the same elements at a shore station. The distribution of magnetic pol1irity on the outer and inner surface of the turrets (gnu auJ steering turrets) was traced ont graphically. 'I'he second paper reports on th.e compasses of the Roanoke compared in two opposite headings of the vessel, additional observations haYiug been made as to the extent in altitude of the local deviations. The heading of the Yessel being opposite, a new set of observations of deflections at the dcc.-k stations was made, also a re-examination of the polarity of the turrets. 'l'he experiments for relative horizontal and total intensity were extended to the Rhip's cabin, and to the interior of the tnrreti<. The magnetism of armor plates, some in situ, and others in the yard of Mr. Webb, intended for the" Dnnderberg," was examined. The third report treats of experiments and investigations wliich were made on the "Passaic,'' similar to those above stated. Thesll include the polarity of the turrets, and of side armor, the horizontal, and total force below and above deck, and within the turret; also tl1e local deflection of the compaee. together with

'l'he deviatious of the latter being thus dct··nnined were talmlated, autl steering tables were made out. 'l'liese results were also shown gn'l]Jhieally. A design for mounting and using compasses on board of turreted iron-clads was also submittcll.
EXPEUDJENTAL INQUIRIES.

Careful experiments were made in the early part of the present year by Assistant George W. Dean, at the office of the CoaRt Survey, on two forms of the relay magnets w;ed in long telegntpli lines to r0pent the signals, which led him to the conclusion that the scientific p inciples invoh·ed in the construction of tlw im,trumcnt had not bel'll suiiiciently considered. In one 81't of instruments the ti:'IP lo~t liy breaking the circuit ("induction time") varied from 0.0:2 of a second to 0.0G of a St:coll(1, wliile in another tht: time lost varied from 0.0G to 0.016 of a scconil. Tlie:;e variations would Le cucountcrecl in u:<ing rday magnr,t,.. in clctcrrninations of differences of longitude. The subject is still nuder <lbcu:;:;iou expcrim:~11tally, by l\fr.

war from service on the Coast Survey, maintained a most active interest in its welfare and progress, and in the E<ul\jPdH embraced by or contributing to its operntions. His sudclen death was appalling to us, occurring as it dic.l at the very time we were about to call upon liim for services which were so much in his line that tl1ere was no douht he would clwcrfully lia>e rendNed them, had his professional duties permitted. He was oc"cu1iicd, .ir1deed, to the full extent of the capahilitics and physical power of an ordinary man, but l1is great mental activity and bodily i>trcngth made it ap1war as though there was 110 limit to l1is power of undertaking congenial work. As an officer of engineers, he had occupations connected with the defence of New Haven, of New L<mdon, of tl1e western entrance into Narragansett ba.y, and of tl1e city of Providence, R. I. As an experimentalist, he was engaged, under the auspices of the Navy Department, in perfecting his sea-miner or , submarine projectile, for operations offensive and defensive against vessels in harbor defence. Major E. B. Hunt was born in Allegany county, New York, in 1822, and entered the J\Iilitary Academy ut \,\Test Point in 1841. He graduated first in his class, and was commissioned in the corps of engineers, in which lie rose to the rank of major. 'l'he habits of study which belonged to his youtl1 ailhcred to him in manhood, and the powers of l1is mind were alway~ kept alive by close reading-, aud by original researches in mechanical and physical philosopl1y. General speculations were more conge11ial to his mind than cletailed investigations, and while occupied with manifold profossional duties, he was especially at home on tl1e meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, to which he eontrilmterJ nnrnernns papers. He found a congenial field of operations in the office of the Coast Survey, where lie servPd during three years, (1851-1853,) always eager for improvrment, and contributing libcmlly his ideas towards progress in its various departments. His love of system incluced him early to prnpose an index of the scientific papen; published throughout foe world, and he lmd made, when the absorbing duties of the war took him to other fidrls of labor, consiilerablc progress in a special index for the subjects embraced in tl1is work. 'l'he extensive plan mRtured by the Royal Society ut the suggeetion of the Smithsoniim Institution of the lJ uitcd States, and of the British Association for the Promotion of Science, had rendered this work comparatively of little moment, and I suppose 1Iajor Hunt had yielclec.l, though with reluctance, to this necessity of the case. Clnssification was such a favorite mental occupation with him that he was tolerant of labor which is generally found to be disgusting to men of his mental calibre and success in original investigation. It may trnly be said of J\Iajor Hunt that he never changed his place or opportunity of obsexvation without producing something on the factf', relations, and causes of things observed. 'I'his general habit of invl'stigation won for him the acquaintance of a large circle of scientific men who have shown their appreciation of his mental culture and original thought by the expressions of their profouud regret at his decease. 'I'he melancholy terminatior:i of a distinguished career is thus st:ited on the authority of Colonel Iticliard Delafield, of the corps of engineers, by Professor Alexander C. Twiuing, who atienuerJ, as a uelegate from the Connecticut Academy of Sciences, the funeml of Major Hant, at "\Vest Point, on the 5th of Oetober, 1 SG3, a few days after he had breathed his last at the New York navy yard. "J\fajor Hunt was practicing, at a place about five miles below the navy yard at Brooklyn, in experiments upon his new invention for breakiug through the armor of iron-plated ships. His gun had just been fired from the upper deck-being itHPlf on the deck beneath. Perceiving an effect that was Wl'Ong, Major Hunt passed part way down a ladder into the apartment below, but soon made his way back and lifted his hmul for hel1J. 'l'he fact appeal's to have been th;1t the mi~sile had been thrown backward, instead of forward, out of the gun, and the gun-room, from which the experimenter was esca1iing, had become full of an irrespir11ble gas from the burning composition. '.rhe lifted hand was caught by one of tl1e laborers on deck, but could not be held, and Major Hunt fell into the hold with his face down and immersed in water. He was followeu by the laborer, who turned his face upward, but could do no more. Afterwards a fresh hand went down and fastened a rope around the body, but not ~ecurely, for in the aft~r lifting, when partly accomplished, Major Hunt slipped through with a second fall. He was not brought up until the gas was dispersed or absorbed by water thrown down. Then he was taken to the navy yard, but in au insensible condition, and surgical aid was obtained not till then, and then in vain." In Appendix No. ~5 will be found a list of the scientific papers published by Major Hunt. A monument of hi>' labor is ii1 the ten-years index of the annual reports of the Coast Survey, published in the volume for 1854. It has not been reserved for him to repeat this onerous task a second time, a task for which he was probably better qualified than any otlrnr man living, and which we were about to ask him to undertake when the shock of his death came suddenly upon us.

P. \Vebber, has embraced the Letite Passage and Deer i,;land, and completes that rcquirccl for tlw survey of Passamaquoddy Lay. On the British side of the northeastern Loundary points were detenninecl sufficient to s1ww in connexion the shore and islands of the bay and the adjacent shore of the proviuce of N"w Brum·wick, as far from the coast us St. Andrews. :From the Passanrnrp10dcly entrnnetc J\Ir. IVeLber has also com11leted the secondary tria11gulation of the coast going southward and westwmd to ~Iachias, as sl10wn on sketch No. 2, which accompanies this report. 'I'he secondary work was kept in connexion with the primary triangulation by taking in the firnt order stations Howard, TreRcott Hock, and Cbmneook, 1tnd observiug on their signals from the stations occupied this Sf!ason. The party of Sub-Assistant "'-ebber took up this duty in the middle of J nne, liaving the schooner Hassler for trnngpnrtation. At Rtation TI1·ll, marked on the Fketch, a tripod anu Ecaffold signal forty-five feet liigh was required to connect the points on J'lfad1ias bay with l:'tations intenclecl to be ob.,;erved on in Passamaquoddy bay, the country in the intrTvening rrgion being made up of heavily wcoded hil1s. In passing along the coast, between Trescott Rock and .!\lad1ias, a tertiary triangulation was made, and points determined for the surv<'y of Little Kennebec rin!r. At six of tlie 8ti.tions occupied by Mr. C'bber vertical nngles were measured on twelve otl1ers, a11d recordetl, with descriptions of the stations observed on. 'The records in duplicate of the horizontal angles, descriptionR of the signnl.,; used, notes for identi(yiug the stations, and the computation of results by Sub-Assistant 'Yeblwr, have been received at the office. The fielil-work he reports as having been much hindered by the prentleucc of fogs. Beginning at the northeaf'tcrn boundary of the United States, the secondary triangulation of the coast of Maiue is continnomt, and complete to the vicinity of l\lount Deeert island, as nrny be seen by reference to the progress sketch.

Trianf?i!lation <?.f Blue Rill bay, Maine.-This work was continned by the party of Assistant G. A. }'airfield, after the completion of measurements at the end of July, at station l'atterson, (sketch No. 2,) on the weRt side of the Penobscot, which b in connexion with the triangles carried last seaRon over fole au Haut bay, and aho in crmnexion with tbe work laid out for the present sea~on. The party used the schooner James Hj!ll for transportation. Nine eignals were erected, ten stations occupied, and one hundred and sixteen angles measured by seventeen lrnndred and forty-nine observations with the ten-inch theodolite, Ko. 91. It will be sePn by the progress 8ketch that the triangulation already done, requi~ite to define this pttrt of the eoa;,;t of )faine in ontlin!:', and the islands lying off the coast in position, is in full connexion with the primary Wol'k. Assistant Fairfield continued the triaugnlation iu the vicinity of Blue Hill bay until tl1e 10th of October, and then returned the vessel to New York. He had emplop·d the first part of the surveying year in Section IV, in which duty, as abo in that on the coai;t of Maine, he was aided by :Mr. Horace Anderson. This party rendered effective a::i~istauce to Captain CaePy, of the Engineer department, a& did several others in the section. Their services in furnishiug information connected with the question of defences at Belfast and Eastport have been l1ighly commended by the ehief engineer. Triangulation of Penobscot rii:e1·, .Maine.-Assistant S. C. McCorkle took up this work on the 23d of .Tnly, with a party in the schooner Torrey, st>irting at the line "Patterson-Oas tine," shown on the progress sketch No. 2. He had preYiously-;;:;c·tcd some of the Eignals nece~sm·y, ancl in the court<c of the season, wl1ich krminated on the 12th of Octolier, 1wt up fourteen in all, of wbich nine were tripod sig·nals.

been organized for this work early in the summer, but was soon after disbanded in consequence of the emergency for the services of Mr: Rockwell near J>hiJadelphia, where he was engaged until the 18th of August. The Rchooner Qaswell was then without delay fitted arnl sent to 'Viutm· harbor, (~ketch No. 2,) to complete tlie plane-table survey, and extend the coast topography eastward. Mr. Rockwell completed the surYcy of the harbor and that of Schoodic I'oint, and the i8land8 in its vicinity, by the 8th of October, running ten miles of shore-line, and filling in with details an aggregate of four square miles of area. He was then reassigned to duty in the military clepnrtment of Virginia and North Carolina, where he had been in service during the early part of the year. At the rer1uest of l'tlajor General Foster he is now engaged in topographical duty with the army corps in Tennessee. The previous service of Sub-Assistant Rockwell will be stated under tlie l1cad of Section IV. Topograplty ef Camden Ji arbor and Roclport lwrbor, llfe.-The ]>lane-table survey of the western side of Penobscot bay was resumecl by Sub-Assi~t>int F. W. Dorr, on the 1st of ,July, at Clam cove, to w11ich point the detailed topography of that side of the bay hacl been carried in previous seasons by Sub-Assistant l:'ergnson. 'l'he following is an extract from the report of .l\lr. Dorr, who continued the survey until the bt of October: ":From Clam cove the topograpliy was e:xtencled northward to a point about two miles north of Camden harbor, and was carried back from the ~lwre of Penobscot bay, an average distance of a mile and a half. Many of the prominent. \'levations, as Beach Hill, ~fount Beattie, and J\lonut J\Icgunticook were thus includct!, ranging in height from five lmndn:d to fourteen hundred feet; alw, the village8 of Hockport and Camden, with their approaches.

Before taking the fidd in July he attended to their repairs, and as called for, turned them over to the parties to which they were assigned for the :field-work of the pre::mnt season. The schooner Meredith, mied Ly hi;; party, is now lai<l. up at J>ortland. During March, April, J\Iay, and June, of the present year, ]\fr. Longfellow kept records of the temperature of the air, and also of the water of Portland harL01·, at dcptLs uf three, six, nine, and twelve foet, recording mostly at high water. Three obsm·vatious were made daily, including readings for the Rpecific graYity of the water.. Plane-table survey ef l\Tarragansett bay, R. L-The preliminary survey of Narragansett bay has been completed by the party of Assistant A. l\l. Harrison. 'l'be wmk done this season comprises Providence river up to the city of Providence, and the sho1·es of Greenwich and \Yickford b;iys. l:'or the shore-line survey, J\fr. Hanisun laid out and measured a triangulation taking in the greater part of the ground which was to Le passed over by the plane-taule party. Sketch No. 1 shows the limits of the work done in thtc present year. The party began their wmk on the 29th of June with the schooner M. L. Stevens, and closed on the 15th of October. · Snb-Assistant Charles Hosmer and J.Ir. Ii. "\V. Bache were attached to the plane-table party. Mr. Hosmer, who had been prCYiously employed in Sections VIII and lX, was reassigned in the latter part of September to duty for tlw a1my uf Major General Hanks. Assistant Harrison had in the early part of the season made detailed surveys for engineering purposes on the Potomac. He is now employed in inking the sl1eets of his :rnrvey of Narragansett bay. J.Ir. Bache has been assigned to field service in Section II. On closing the work in Narragansett bay, the vessel used by this party was laid up at New York. In his triangulation, Mr_ Harrison occupied nineteen stations, aud determined eighteen points by the measurement of eight hundred and thirty-two angles_ The topographical statistics are as follows: Shore-line surveyed. _ .··· _____ ·· _ ..· _ · _____ · __ . _. __ . __ · _ ·· _.·· _____ · _ _ _ _ _ 81 Creeks and ponds. _ . _ . _ . _··.. ____ ·. __ · _______ .. _____ . _ ·· ____ . __ ·. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 7 Roads- - - - . ____ . __ ···. _. _____ . ___ .· _ · _ .··. ___ . _ .· __ .·· __ · ________ .· ___ · 13 Area of topography, (square miles) ___ · __ · __ . _____________ . _ . _·.. _ . ______ - - · 5 The shore-line from Narragansett ferry to vVickford bay was furnished for the use of the Engineer department at the request of the late Major E.

S. Phelps, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, in the steamer Oor;wi:q. He was able, however, dm·ing a few days of August and September, to make soundings at the north and south ends of Jeffrey's ledge, and to run a line with soundings between the t1Yo localitiHs. The depth fouml on the ledge, which seems to be a prolongation of Cape Aun, varied between twenty-two and thirty-tliree fathoms. Lieutenant Commander Phelps i·eports that the tide sets strong over it both at flood and ebb, the former to the northward and eastward, and the latter to the southward and westward, though varied somewhat in direction by the wind.

the approaches to Ca1·ver's harbor. Of the very large number of vessels that pass through the channole, three hundred are employed in carrying granite under government contracts. I at once issued instructions to Mr. ·Edwards, and the needful examination was made without delay. Twelve positions were selected by him, and the pa1·ticulars concerning them communicated in his report, a copy of which was tranemitted to the dminnan of the Light-house Board in September, togetlier with recommendation that buoys be placed in the !leveral positions ai;i;igned. A list of the aids to navigation thus recommended is comprised in Appendix No. 29. Assistant Edwards was accompanied in this service by C11ptain .J. K. Thoma!', of Rockland, Maine, by whose intimate knowledge of the locality and effective co-opei-ation the work was greatly furthered. The position of the harbor, being an indentation of one of the islands which lie between Isle au Haut and Owl's Head, at the entrance of Penobscot bay, is shown on Sketch No. 2. Hydrographir; dei·elopments in the approaches to Portland harbor.-SpeciaI examinations made this season by Lieutenant Commander Phelps, with a party in the steamer CgnFin and by Acting-Assistant Cordell, have developed a number of rocks and ledges, the existence-;;£ which has been generally but little known, though most of them lie near the direct approaches to Portland harbor. Of these, the firat one examined was "Old Anthony," near which a second rock was supposed to exist called" Vapor Rock." Separate searches made by the two parties show that the two names in lli\e should properly apply to the same rock. It has, therefore, been marked on the engraved chart of the entrance to Portland harbor " Old Anthony or Vapor Rock," being locally well known by the name now appended. The least depth on it is twenty feet at mean low water. About a mile to the southward and eastward of Vapor Rock, Lieutenant Commander Phelps developed the Western Hue-and-Cry, :finding on it twenty-seven feet at mean low water. To the northward and eastward, and about two miles from the last mentioned, Corwin Rock was developed in position and depth, (twenty-four and a half feet at mean low water,) and named after the steamer which carried the hydrographic party. About a mile further in the same direction Lieutenant Commander Phelps sounded across lVest Cod Ledge, finding in one place tliirty-three feet of watt'r. In a subsequeut examination as little as twenty-six feet was found. Bulwark Shoal, lying further out, but in the same course, was thoroughly sounded by }Ir. Cordell, who reports fourteen feet at mean low water as the least depth. This return is confirmed by the linc15 incidentally run by Lieutenant Commander Phelps while verifying former soundings in that vicinity. Nearer to Portland entrance, and not more than a mile and a lialf eaRtward from Portland light, Lieutenant Commander Phelps determined in position lV1:tclt Ruck, with ouly twenty-four feet, and to the south ward and westward of it Pine Tree Ledge, with as little as twenty-one feet, and fVillard's Rock, with thirty· one and a half feet at mean low water. 'l'hcsc recent developments have all bccu included on the eng1·aved chart. The particulars concerning them, as to bearing and distance from points well known, were published collectively in a Notice to Mariners in September. Pine Tree Ledge, having been sounded subl\equently, was named in a separate notice. The bearings from the other are given in Appendix No. 5. In making these several developments eight hundred and twenty-nine angles were measured, and two thousand three htmdred and twenty casts made with the lead. In subsequent examinations made in the middle of October, ]}[itckd's Rock was developed off Cape Elizabeth, and a depth found of thirty-one feet; also East Cod Ledge, with a depth of forty-five feet at mean low tide. The sea breaks on this ledge during Leavy gales. In running in the vicinity of Corwin Rock, at the same time, Lieutenant Commander Phelps found and reported in refel'ence to a sharp point on which there was as little as twenty-one feet. Round Rock, a little to the eastwal"d of Bulwark Shoal, was found to have twenty-nine feet of water, and a rock midway between that shoal and West Cod I..edge as little as twentyfive feet_ Hydrograpky ef Ca.co bay, .Me.-The soundings made this year by the party of Assist.ant F. H Gerdes in Maquoit bay and Middle bay, (see Sketch No. 2,) complete the hydrugl"aphy required for the finished chart of Casco bay. As already mentioned, under the head of topography, the necessary shore-line was run and furnished by Assistant Longfellow. .Al!Bistant Gerdes resumed duty atloat on the 1st of July with the schooner G. M. Bache, and returned to New York in the latter part of September. Sub-Assistant C. T. Iardella was atta.chcd to his party. Sub-Aiisistant Fendall, who had been on field duty, which will be stated under the head of Section VIII, joined the party in August, and assisted during the remainder of the season. Mr. T. C. Bowie served as aid, having been previously employed in Section HI. The soundings made thia year, as will be seen by the

At another station consecutive observations were made for seven days to determine the plane of reference for the soundings. Bad weather and prevailing fogs hindered the work of this as of other parties on the coast of Maine. The Eheet containing the results of soundings in Middle bay and l\laquoit bay has been inked, and is, now at the office with the records wbicl1 pertain to it, of angles and soundings. Assistant Gerdes and Sub-Assistant }'endall are preparing to resume duty on the Mississippi, in continuation of the service which was done last year in Section VIII. The last named pa!'lsed the greater part of the month of October in surveying duty for the army near Chattanooga, but early in November again rejoined Admiral Porter. jj;fagnetic observations.-In continuation of the series of determinations commenced several years ago, Assistant C. A. Schott was temporarily detached from the charge of the computing division of the office, and occupied several stations on the coast of Maine in the month of July. At Portland two stations were occupied, one near the observatory, and the other on Bramhall's Hill, the declination, dip, and magnetic intensity being determined at both. Proceeding eastward, the three cl~mcnts were in like manner ascertained at Harpswell and }'reeport, on Casco bay, at Bath, on the Kennebec, and at Rockland and Belfast, on the Penobscot. The magnetic dip and intensity were determined also on Thomas's Hill, at Bangor, which bad been occupied by my party in the course of the primary triangulation in 1857. For his observations Mr. Schott used the magnetometer No. 3 and the Barrow dip circle No. 8. Time was recorded on the Hutton chronometer No. 211. 'l'he astronomical azimuth was determined by observationl'I upon the sun. Mr. E. H. Courtenay accompanied Assistant Schott as aid, and recorded the observations. The results are given in tabular form in Appendix No. 22. At Eastport, Maine, the series has been kept up regularly of observations during foui· days about the middle of each month of th1; year. As during the three years preceding, the observations have been 1·ecorded lrnlf-hourly for the three magnetic elements. The station at Eastport has been in charge of Assistant Edward Goodfellow during the entire surveying year. Similar observations are made at Key West, Florida. Physical 11un1ey <if B>stn'JI. harbor.-In August and September Assistant Henry Mitchell carried forward the physical examination of Boston harbor, under the direction of the United States commissioners, but at the expense of the city government of Boston. He also made similar examinations in South bay and its approaches, the expenses of which were met by the commissioners on harbor!! of the State of Massachusetts. The results of these investig-ations will appear in the reports of the United States commissioners. Assistant Mitchell was aided in the work at Boston by Messrs. C. P. Dille.way, A. M. Wetherill, and .J. W. Brown. Mr. H. ,V. Longfellow, who had formerly aided in this party, resigned on the 6th of June. Currents ef Vinl'yard sound, 111a.ss.-The hydrograpbic party of .Assistant Mitchell, after the completion of dut.y in Section II, made some special current observations in Martha's Vineyard sound for the purpose of ascertaining the curve of velocities for tidal currents at different depths. This locality was chosen on account of its strong tidal drifts and absence of river outflows. Mr. Mitchell reports th~t he found a uniform motion at all depths to ten fathoms, a result quite in contra8t with those obtained in harbors and rivers. 'l.'he value of such experiments is great, for it enables us more easily to distinguish among the complications in New York harbor and elsewhere the comparative parts taken by the river aud the tidal currents in bringing about the observed· hydrographic changes. Ilydrography ef Sippiean lwrbor, ( Buzzard'11 bay, ~Ia.ts.)-'l'he harbm of Sippican and its approaches were sounded in the latter part of October by the party in the schooner~ In the approaches from Buzzard's bay several dangerous rocks and ledges were carefully developed, and some of more or less importance in Sippican harbor.

Tidal obaer·vationa.-The series of tidal and magnetic observations at Eastport, Maine, was kept up by Mr. R. H. Talcott until November, 1862, when he was assigned to field duty with a surveying party on the coast of Georgia. Assistant Edward Goodfellow has had charge of the station during the .year just past. At the Charlestown navy yard, lflassachusetts, Mr. 'I'. E. Ready has continued an unbroken scriei! of observations on the tides with an ordinary box-gauge. Meteorological observations have been recorded regularly at both of the permanent stations in New England.

SECTION II.
FROM POINT JUDITH TO CAPE HENLOPEN, INCLUDING THE COAST OF THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANLA., AND PA.RT OF DELA.WARE.

The following work has been executed in this section: 1. The primary triangulation has been extended from the Epping base, in Section I, to Long Island sound, by observations at Ivy Hill and Tashua, in Connecticut, for connecting that base with the one on Fire island. 2. Triangulation has been made in extension of that on the eastern side of the Hudson river, and a connexion across to the primary work bas been effected. 3. Verification work has been done at stations on the coast of New Jersey in the vicinity of Shark river and Manasquam inlet. The same party has also commenecd a triangulation of Ahsecum inlet for the plane-table resurvey. 4. Examination of the llhore-lines of New Haven harbor, Connecticut, for comparison with the engraved chart of 1846. The comparison shows that no material changes have taken place in the natural featureB of the harbor shores. 5. Plane-table resurvey of Sandy Ilook, for comparh<on, and to determine the progress and cause of the alteraLions there going on. · 6. Surveys of sites, contour of ground, and general reconnaissance under the direction of the superintendent, as chief engineer, have been made for the military defences of Philadelphia. 7. The position and general dimensions of the ledge upon which the steamer Great Eastern struck in 1862, and the depth of water upon it, have been determined. The same hydrographic party resurveyed part of the main channel of New York harbor to determine a question which had been referred by the pilot commissioners. 8. Completion of the hydrography of Hudson river by soundings between Coxsackie and New Baltimore and between Albany and Troy. The shore-line of the river was traced within the same limits. This work suffices for the issue of a chart of the entire river from New Y 01·k to Troy, in preliminary form. The dett.iled topography of the shores of the Hudson from below was advanced last year as far up as Croton river, on the eastern side, and to a point nearly opposite to Tarrytown, on the western !'ide. 9. Examination of tide_!l and currents at the entrance of New York bay, with reference to their effect in changing the shore-line and hydrography of the vicinity of Sandy Hook. 10. Plane-table survey of part of League island, (Delaware river,) and soundings in its vicinity, for the Navy Department. 11. Hydrographic examination of the vicinity of the Delaware breakwater. This work was for the Engineer department, and to determine the extent and nature of the changes which have taken place in tha.t locality. 12. Tidal observations continued in New York harbor. 0FFICE-WORK.-Sheet No. II, of a general chart of the Atlantic coast of the United States, scale 1: l ,200,0-00, from Nantucket to Cape Hattera~, has been drawn and engraved; the engraving of outlines and hydrography of coast chart No. 21, New York bay and harbor, (resurvey,) has been completed, and that of the topography of the same has been commenced; the drawing and engraving of Hudson river, sheet No. 2, Haverstraw to Poughkeepsie, and No. 3, Poughkeepsie to Glasco, in a. preliminary form, have been completed; that of Hudson river, No. 1, New York to Haverstraw, as a finished map, bas been continued; a hydrographic sketch of Phelps's ledge and Great Eastern Rock, off .Mont.auk Point, has been engraved, and additions have been made to the prog1"eSs sketches of the section.

REPORT 01<' THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Geodetic observatiQ'ftS at Ivy Hill and Tashua IIill, Conn.-The party under my immediate direction for the work of this year wae organized early in June. In extending the primary triangulations southward toward!! Pire island, for connecting the primary base line there with the one measured on Epping Plains, in Section I, Ivy Hill, in Litchfield county, Connecticut, was occupied. The preliminary arrangements, such as the erection of signals to be observed on from that station, and posting the heliotropers, were executed by Assistant G. W. Dean and Sub-Assistant R. E. Halter. Mr. Thomas McDonnell, as heretofore, attended to the transportation of the iustruments and to the preparation required for the use of the geodetic party. Assistant Dean, on the 19th of June, adjusted the thirty-inch theodolite in position on Ivy Hill, and commenced measuring the horizontal angles to join that station with those which had been previous]) occupie~A few days after personally joining my party, I was summoned by telegraph to Philadelphia to assist in the defence of that city against the apprehended approach of an invading rebel army, which was then crossing the southern border of the State of Pennsylvania. Having previously tendered my services to the authorities of the State, their call was at once responded to, after obtaining the authority of the department. Sub-Aasistant Hslter was recalled from the station to join me for service at Philadelphia on the 28th, and remained on duty there until the 7th of August, when he reported to Assistant Dean, at Ivy Hill. The measurement of horizontal angles at Ivy station was completed on the 14th of .August. Four primary and five secondary signals were observed on, and eight hundred and twenty-five observations were recorded. The vertical angles requisite for determining the heights of six of the outlying stations were measured and recorded by Sub-Assistant Halter and Mr. S. H. Lyman. Three hundred and seventy-five measurements were made with the eight-inch Gambey vertical circle No. 57. "\Vhile my party was on duty at this station arrangements were made for observing and recording the phenomena of meteors in the early part of August, and more especially on the evenings of the 8th, 9th, and 10th of that month. 'l'his was designed to be in co-operation with a series of observations suggested by Professor H . .A. Newton, of Yale College, himself and other observers intending to record the same phenomena at New Haven and Hartford, Connecticut_ A few meteors were seen between passing clouds from Ivy station, and recorded on the night. of the 10th, but not satisfactorily. Clouds with rain prevented observations on the previoUB evenings. On the 15th of .August the instruments and equipments vf the geodoetic party were transferred to Tashua Hill, in ]<,airfield county, and after the needful preparation and adjustment, .Assistant Dean commenced observing there on the 1st of September, at which date I rejoined the party. The observations were made, as heretofore, with the thirty-inch theodolite. By the 1st of October seven hundred and fifty observations of horizontal angles were made, four primary and two secondary signals being observed on. For ascertaining the heights of stations connected in this work with Tashua, three hundred and fifty measurements of vertical a.ngles were made by l\:lr. Halter. In this seasou's work the most distant signal observed upon was fifty-three miles from the theodolite statioo. Pive of the lines of the triangulation were between thirty and forty miles in length. The position of the trigonometrical station on Tashua Hill, being favorable for determining its height above the sea with the levelling instrument and target, a line was run hy Sub-Assistant J. A. Sullivan, stai1ing at the station and terminating at bench-marks at Bridgeport, and on the light-house at Black Rock. He repeated the observations in returning to 'l'ashua, and recorded one thousand and seventy-six measurements with the instrument, the two lines makiug an aggregate of about twenty-five miles. At Bridgeport a tide staff was set up by Mr. McDonnell, and arrangements made for the requisite number of tidal observationg, The zero of the staff graduation was referred to the bench-mark established by Mr. Sullivan, and the mean level of the sea was ascertained from one hundred and fifty readings of the tide staff, near the times of high and low water during seven days. A preliminary reduction of the tidal and level observations gives for the height of Tashua Hill geodetic station six hundred and eight feet above the mean level of Long Island sound. The geodetic records were kept in duplicate as the field-work advanced, and the volumes containing them are now in the office. Sketch No. 1, accompanying this report, shows the scheme of primary triangulati\ln for connecting the Epping base with the base on Fire island, in Section II. Magnetic observations at I1Jy Hill and Tashua, Conn.-While the geodetic work wa.s in progress at Ivy Hill, Assistant Dean made experimental observations with the dip-circle, and finding no unusual loca.l attraction, se]el"ted a station near the summit f·>r the customary series, to determine the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. The fust-named element was ascertained from one hundred and forty-six readings of the

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

29

magnet scale on three days, with the declinometer No. 1. The horizontal intensity of the bar, and moment of inertia, were determined from three sets of vibration and deflection. For the dip, four complei.e series were observed with dip-circle No. 4, three days being given to the determination of each of the elements . .At Tashua, the foot of the western slope of the hill appearing most favorable, the observations were made at a spot about one hundred and twenty-five feet below the summit, and about a quarter of a mile from the geodetic station. Mr. Dean determined the declination by one hundred and ninety-six readiugs on four days, and the dip and horizontal intensity in the usual way, employing two days in the series. The results deduced from the observations made at Ivy Hill and Tashua are stated in Appendix No. 22. Mr. Lyman aided in the magnetic observations, and made the computation of results . .As before intimated, pressing official duties separated me from my party during part of the present season. Its operations, however, were efficiently conducted in my absence, by Assistant Dean, and were closed at Tashua on the 26th of October. Meteorological ohaervationa.-The meteorological journals were kept at Ivy Hill and Tashua by Mr. F. W. Perkins, who also served as geodetic recorder. The aggregate of entries for readings of the barometer, and for temperature by the wet and dry bulb thermometers, was six hundred and thirty. '!'he direction and force of the wind were recorded as usual. Triangulation eaatward ef Hudaon river.-The triangulation laid out by Assfatant Edmund Blunt, to extend along the east side of the Hudson, has been continued to the southwestern corner of the boundaries of Massachusetts, and kept in connexion with the preliminary work done in passing up the Hudson. In the latter part of the season, Mr. Blunt joined his work with stations which had been occupied by my own party in this section, for which the observations necesS&ry at Tashua station were made by .Assistant Dean. This triangulation joins with the primary work on the line Tashua-Wooster, (see Sketch No. 1,) the connexion being at Good Hill. .Assistant Blunt took up field-work on the 6th of June, and will probably continue the triangulation until the end of November. Sub-Assistant A. ·r. J'ifosman has been attached to his party throughout, and Sub-Assistant J . .A. Sullivan since the 5th of October. 'I'he following are statistics of the triangulation : Stations occupied ... __ ... _ ... _ . _ .. __ . _ . _ . _ .. __ .....·.. __ .. _.· _ .. __ ..· _. 12 Stations observed on (with signals) ...... - _ ..·.· _ ...·.... - ... __ .... - - ... _ . 23 Angles measured ·... _... _ ......... _ ......·. _ .... _ ..... _ ..··.... _ . . . . . . 127 Number of observations._ ··.. - . - - ... _ ...·. _ ...... _ ·.. _ ....·. _......... __ . 8,158 The area comprised in this triangulation is about five hundred and eighty-one square miles. Triangulation ef the coast ef New Jersey.-In his reconnaissance of September, 1862, .Assistant John Farley reached the vicinity of Squam village, having revised the triangulation of the coast southwards from Sandy Hook in the previous season, and brought his measurements to stations in the neighborhood of Shark river. The work was resumed early in July, and that and the following month passed in efforts to connect the stations near Shark river with others at the head of B11.r11ega.t sound. 'I'his has proved to be a matter of much difficulty, the direction of the lines being shut in by forests or other obstacles to sight. In extending the triangulation about Shark river, southward to Squ.am village, Mr. Farley occupied nine stations, and recorded about thirteen hundred obseryations with the theodolite. In the vicinity of Sqnam l't:Ir. Farley found two of the stations which had been used in 1839, and made some observations in September for connecting them with the stations which he had occupied in the earlier part of the season. These it is expected will materially facilitate the revision work in passing through Barnegat bay. E;paminatian ef slwre-line in Neto Hdven harbor, Conn.-A few di{ys before his death, the late and much lamented Major E. B. Hunt, of the corps of engineers, who had just fixed his residence at New Haven, and whose interest in the progreos of the coast survey had been unremitting, notwithstanding bis detachment from the work, suggested the expediency of comparing the present shore-line of that harbor with the outline shown by the engraved chart of 1846. I at once detailed Suh-Assistant Halter, who was then on duty in my party, to make the examination. He visited the harbor on the 1st of October, and reported very few other than artificial changes as being noticeable on the western shore. Near the mouth of West river, Whl:lre the ground is of alluvial character, the alterations were more preceptible, but were thought to be due in part to the eifect {)f the causeway built there since the survey was made. Slight changes were noticed also at Sandy Point.

30

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The eastern shore of the harbor was found uuchanged, except by the addition of wharves, houses, and other adjuncts of the increase of population since the year 1837. Having completed this duty Mr. Halter rejoined my party, and remained with it until the close of the season. He is now preparing for active service in the waters of North Carolina. Resurvey ef Sandy Hook.-During Jhe past three years the point of Sandy Hook has been rapidly extending, and the east and west shores suffering encroachments from the ocean. In order to ascertain the character of these changes, .Assistant Henry Mitchell was instmcted in November, 1862, to make a preliminary examination. '.I'his was done promptly, and the account furnished convinced me that resurveys were necessary to ascertain the extent of the alterations . .Assistant H. L. Whiting made a new topographical survey of the Hook in November and Decem her, and promptly forwarded the sheet to the office. He was assisted in the £eld by Sub-Assistant I!'. P. Webber and .Mr. J. W. Donn. The scale of the survey was such as to admit of ready comparison with sheets of the former surveys. .Assistant l\Utchell, with a party in the schooner Dana, executed the hydrographic reEOurvey in June and July, and at once plotted and sent the new chart to the office. The following are statistics of this work: Miles run in sounding. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 89 .Angles measured ................... , ................................... l, 447 Number of soundings................. . ....·........................... 6, 263 .Messrs. C. P. Dillaway, .A. M. Wetherill, and J. W. Brown served as aids in the hydrographic party. Currents ef NP11J York harbM.-I have referred hi former reports to a nortbwardly sub-current underrnnning the tidal drifts at and above the Narrows, discovered while the survey of the harbor was in progress for the Commissioners on Harbor Encroachments, and allude to the subject now to mention a further development of the causes of this singular phenomenon. In a letter received from .Assistant Mitchell, he states that the occasion of his passage to and from Peekskill for arrangements connected with bis vessel and party was improved to make some experiments on the specific gravity of different strata of water, in the hope of finding a clue for explaining the observed fact. The aids of the party made trials of the water from point to point in the Hudson, both in the spring and in the autumn of the present year. In the spring the water was found to be fresh at the surface, even as low down as the Battery ; but, near the month of the river, the lower water stratum was found to be salt. In the autumn, the river at all deptht1 was found to be somewhat salt as high up as Yonkers, and to increase in density with the depth. From inquiries, it was ascertained that in the fa.ll of the year salt water had been known to extend as high up as Poughkeepsie. The probable inference from these facts is that during the wet season the fresh-water rise causes the expulsion of sea-water from the river, but that during the summer, the kead of the river becoming much reduced, t11e denser sea-water flows up along the bed of the stream, displacing the fresh water. The levelling by .Assistant Mitchell from the city of New York to .Albany, in 1857, shows that the bed of the river lies below the level of the sea, and that the half tidal surface of the stream had but about three feet fall between the two cities. It may be seen, then, that the contrast of densities, taken in connexion with the variable fresh-water head, renders the theory plausible that the lower part of the Hudson may be alternately a river and an arm of the sea. That the sea-water may underrun the fresh water when the vertical column of the former is equal to or greater than the latter, is not only admissible in theory, but is confirmed by observations made in several localities where movements of this kind actually go on. Mr. Mitchell attributes the northwardly subcurrent which he has observed during the dry uason of the year, to the advance of the sea in order to occupy the bed of the river. · A.sour experience gains, the causes of physical change in New York harbor are gradually revealed; but I deem it prudent to await the development of investigations in other harbors now under inspection, before attempting to make any final deductions. A.n inquiry growing out of a trial for murder committed at Brooklyn, Long Island, in October, 1861, and which involved the qnestion of set of current and the state of the tide at a certain hour of the night on which the crime was perpetrated, was referred to me in March last hy S. D. Morris, esq., district attomey for Kings county, New York, while the trial was pending. The conviction which followed was strengthened in the mind of the prosecuting attorney by the facts furnished from the office record, and his acknowledgment state!! explicitly that they materially aided in the course of justice.

Defensive works and surveys near Pltiladelpnia.-In anticipation of the movement of the rebel forces into Pennsylvania in June last, I offered my services on the 16th of that month to the governor of the State and to the mayor of Philadelphia, through Benjamin Gerhard, esq., with the consent of the Secretary of the 'l'reasury. After the receipt of a telegram from Major Gc'leral N. J. T. Dana, in the following termi!: "I am advised by some of your friends here of your offer to make a reconnaissance for the construction of defensive works at this place. We have no engineer, and your aid would be invaluable if you,,Are still able to renew your kind offer and could eorntt at once, with such of your corp::i as you can bring,"~ proceeded to Philadelphia without delay, reaehing,,(hat city on the 27th of June. Assistant George DaMson, who had volunteered for the service, was directed to make a reconnaissance of the environs for military purposes, to embrace the northern approaches of the city. The site of Fort Dana having been approved, its construction was begun on the 2d of July by a party of sixty men, detailed by J. C. Ureeson, esq., fr~ the city gas-works. The work was completed as soon as possible, under the direction of Mr. Da~son. Several gentlemen not connected with the survey had volunteered with alacrity for the occasion, and were assigned to his aid, and he was thus enabled to carry forward the reconnaissance, in some detail, of the ground deemed most important. Feasible lines of defence having been developed and examined, I then minut?ly inspected them, and also the proposed sites for field-works, being accompanied in thi8 duty by Assistant~~vidson. A map of the reconnaissance, upon a scale of eight hundred feet to the inch, ha" been furnished. It includes an area of eighty square miles, of which rather more tl1an half was minutely examined for defensive purposes. '1'hc map gives the general features of the country with as much :fidelity as the means and time afforded. Mr. Davidson's report points out the necessity of a close and detailed survey for the proper study of a complete system of defences. In his report full credit is given to all who volunteered and were assigned to him for field duty. He makes acknowledgment also for valuable data received from the North Pennsylvania Railroad Company, for plans and profiles of part of their road. Similar information was furnished by the connecting railroad company and by Messrs. S. C. Ford, Jesse Lightfoot and Jacob P. Tyson. The assistance of James Rowland, esq., who was familiar with the localities, and who kiud,Jy accompanied the party and furnished his own horBes for the service, was very acceptable. . j Of the members of the Coast Survey, Assistant C. l\L 'Vache made a plane-table survey near the city, and was then transferred to a point on the outer line of approach for similar duty. His work embraced an area of about two and a half square miles, and included thirteen miles of roads and eight miles of watercourses. These and other surveys were reduced to the proper scale as they came in for the general map. Assistant BalJie, after turning in the two plane-table sheets, returned to the work in Section III which he had left for the duty near lthiladelphia. Assistant P. C. ~West reported in July and made a plane-table survey of part of the northwestern approach. During the military operations near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, he had been attached to the staff of Brigadier General_"J F. Smith. Mr. Rober~ E.M<W:ath commenced work with .Assistant R. M~ache, but in the latter part of the season aided Mr. Da-...ilson and made a reconnaissance of one pf the ridges near the city. His aptness a~d capacity for field-work at·e warmly c~mfiended. i Sub-Assit1tants J. S. Bi'ij#iford pd Clevdand ~kwell reported, the first on the 29th of .Iune, and the latter on the 1st of .July. Mr. Br~ford wa1 employed a short time in contour work, and was then assigned to duty with .Assistant Boutelle. Mr. Roc~ell when called was about to take up plane-table duty in Section I. He commenced work near Philadelphia, but was taken ill. After recovering he reported to Assistant 'Vhiting, and made topograph~l reconnaissance of sev9al localities west of the Schuylkill. Mr. .A.. R. Fa1'#'tleroy joined Mr. Davi&i'on as aid on the 26th of June, and has been steadily and actively engaged, either in the field or in reducing and plotting work for the large map. He surveyed about sixty miles of roads, ran a number of lines of level, and contoured part of the ground occupied by the inner line of defence, and is commended iu the field report for the prompt and intelligent discharge of all the duties assigned to him. , The department of surveys of the city of Philadelphia having volunteer,tl their service8, several of the surveyors and regulators of the dift'erent districts were referred to As!!ista.nt D{..vidson and took up duty in the field. The early part of July was rainy and unfavorable for progress, but all worked with commendable zeal and without charge for their party expenses. A preliminary survey around the site of Fort Dana was made

32

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

by Messrs. Jesse Lightfoot and J. F. Wolf, and they subsequently assisted with their party in the general
survey. Mr. Lightfoot was for Sl)me time in charge of the map, and directed the proper arrangement of the materials furnished by the other parties. He generously placed at my disposal a large office, in which the field-work was rr,duced and plotted. Messrs. D. H. Shedaker and James Keily assisted with a transit and levelling party until the 20th of July. :Mr. Keily also furnished data for the map in plans and profiles. Messrs. J.P. Davis, Andrew French, Joseph Mercer and Jacob M. Seads, with a similar party, traced part of the ground of approach and the roads intersecting it. This party was from Kensington, and worked assiduously under many disadvantages during the first week of July. Another, with transit and level, under Mi.. Alfred Young, was engaged about a week in the same neighborhood. Several of the railroad companies promptly sent their engineers to the assistance of the city. The Reading Railroad Company placed at my disposal the services of Messrs. Charles McDonald, Richard McCaiFrey, Henry Stout and William C. Cleveland, who werP. during the month of July steadily engaged in extending the survey outward from the city. The Broad Mountain Railroad Company at the same time sent Messrs. T. Gui1ford Smith and Chauncey Ives, who continued in :field duty until the 20th of August. They made levellings of a large extent of ground. Mr. ~dward Sloau, of the Polytechnic Institute at Philadelphia, was assigned to this party, and after they were relieved continued levelling for the contour work until the 10th of October. The Mine Hill Railroad Company sent Mr. T. R. Stocket, who contoured portions of the ground from data furnished by the surveyors and engineers. He also plotted details for the map after the departure of Mr. Lightfoot. One of the first volunteers for surveying duty was Joseph Lesley, esq., of the Pennsylvania Central Railroad Company, who remained two weeks with Assistant Davidson, and further.eel the work by his knowledge of the environs of Philadelphia. Mr. J.B. Atkinson offered on the 2d of July, and assisted until the 21st of October, showing great aptness in contouring. Mr. W. G. Neilson came at the same time, and continued until the latter part of August, part of the time aiding in the party of Assistant C. M. Bache. Mr. E. D. Hallowell reported among the :first, and remained with Assistant Davidson until the close of :field-work, giving very important aid. Captain J. B. Williams was among the first volunteers. After assisting in reconnaissance, he was placed in charge of one of the forts. Mr. Charles Perkins was on duty a Bhort time with this party. but will be mentioned again as connected with another. Mr. James Steele volunteered and assisted iu the field until prostrated by sickness. Mr. W. T. Gummey aided for a short time in compiling for the map. M1·. ,V. E. Weber volunteered on the 2d of July, and worked efficiently at several periods throughout the season. E. 'I'. Hyatt, esq., offered his services on the 1st of July, and took charge of the men detailed from the gas-works for the erection of defences. He remained with failing health until the completion of Fort Dana, but, to onr deep regret, hie energy and usefnlne11s were cut short by his death in October. llr. L. R. Walton t!lok service on the 2cl of July, remained for nearly a month, and performed some good service after his return in October. Professor George Franck, of the Polytechnic Institute of Philadelphia., reported early in July, and assisted until tho middle of September in reconnaissance. Messrs. J. F. Clark, Albert L. Kern, H. Mcintyre, George S. Bethel, S. Brandeis, L. H. Steele, A. L. Massey, Benjamin Allen, and W. H. Clarke, joined about the same time, and were efficient and useful during the time which they were able to devote to the public service. :Mr. W. H. Bennett a~sisted in reconnaissance until the 3d of October, and Mr. W. C. Gatzmer until the middle of September. Many of the gentlemen whose names have been mentioned in connexion with the work of this party were recent graduates of the Polytechnic Institute. __ During the time referred to in the previous notice, a general reconn!li!J\ance of the sooth, the southwest, and the northwest approaches to Philadelphia was made by Assistant t!I/ L. Whiting. His map and report presented in Angnst was accompanied by local sketches of the most important sites for works of defence, and by remarks on the advantages of each of the por1·ions. This reconnaissance took in all the approaches by southerly ranges from Fort Miffiin westward, and t the northwest approach joined with the surveys made by Mr. Davidson. As in the first instance, Mr. W ing specified in his report the field-works and redoubts deemed requisite within the area of the reeonnais!lanee.

In summing up his report, .Assistant Whiting says: "The country was examined with as much care, and the positions, di5tances, bearings, and connexions of the different works were studied with as much discrimination, aH tlw time allotted, and the nature of a preliminary recommi~~ttnee would allow. An elaborate and accurate survey of the country embraced within the natural limits of defence f;r so large a city would be most desirable. Such a survey would settle all questions of position, distance, bearing, elevation, intercepted or open fire, and the nature of the intervening ground, and "\vould probably lead to the modification of the present project for defence." It is indispensahle for a complete study of the question in regard to suitable defences. \ Mr. W. B. l\icMi/rtr~, of the Coast Survey office, was on duty with .Assistant Vn1iting lls draughtsman . .Assistant R. M. B~he, who had been steadily employecl in Section VIII, reached Philadelphia on the 27Lh of June, from St. Louis. On the 29th he volunteered for the surveys needed near Philadelphia, and made topograpyical sketches of the point8 deemed most suitable for immediate occupation. llis ai<l, Mr. Robert E. Mc¥ath, mapped in !I,< preliminary way the grounds adjaee11t to thm;e pointH. This service being completed, the duties of Mr. Mhe were changed to reconnaissance and construction, field-works heing commenced at suitable positions for guarding the western approaches of the city. Besides these, he bad selected and staked out several other sites for defensive purposes, and, with the aid of gentlemen who volunteered for the service, qui.,kly gave shape to the works which were first put under construction. " Captain Charle8 H. Gibson, second cavalry, joined himself to the party of A;;sistant 'l..fiache for the surveys, and in selecting the site for one of the earthworks, and also assisted in its construction. He was aiding in the work when a call was made for his services elsewhere. Captain H. C. Ulman, formerly of the volunteer service, also joined the party early, and aided in the service. Mr. J. W. Walker, a graduate of the Polytechnic Institute, volunteered and acted as engineer of site at one of the field-works. He was very assiduous in the performance of that duty. Captain Benjamin H. Smith, formerly of the volunteer service, was engineer of site at one of the works, and aided materially by his practical knowledge. . After its completion he took charge of the works at another fort which was then in progress. Mr. Charles Perkins, a graduate of the Univernity of Penn~ylvania, was making favorable progress on the work last referred to, as engineer of site, when he was obliged to relinquish the charge and resume Lis regular duties connected with one of the State railroads. Mr. II. Mcintyre, of the water department of Philad~phia, acted as engineer of site, and rendered very effective service in that ca~acity. ; Of his aid, Mr. Mcl\4Jith, .Assistaht R"tche makes special reference in his report, both in reganl to the good judgment shown in projecting the defensive works that lay within the scope of the reconnai1:1l!anee, and as to 11is care and industry in prqsecuting the details. The report of Assistant ~he, made at the end of .August, sp~cified the details of size and position of each of the works projected and constructed by his party under my direction, and furnished ahm careful notes of the milita-ry advantages of each of them for defendipg the western approach to the city of Philadelphia. One of the forta; was planned and con~tructed by jt\s!!istant 0. 0. Boutelle, who had volunt~ercd for the work of defences of the,eitg. Sub-Assistant J. S. ~ford assisted in this duty. Sub-Assistant R. E.~alter, who had been in service in my own party on the coast of Cgunecticut, was recalled, having volunteered for duty at Philadelphia, and reported to me there on the 30Nf of June. He was first detailed to throw up an earthwork for defending one of the western lines of approach. After its completion, he started with a party of five men and made a plane-table survey, inchuling both Lanks of the Schuylkill in the neighborhood of the city. On the west side of the river, ¥is map was extended as fft as the junction of Belmont avenue. This work was completed by the 5th ~.August, after which Mr.-Ualter returned to the party in Connecticut. From the drawing division o/ the Coast Survey office Mr. Edwin Hergesheimer reported at Philadelphia, under my instructions on the 2fJ'IJll of June. He at once made reconnaissance maps of parts of the northwestern approaches to the city, and during July and part of .August, a map of the mo:it important ground in the flame vicinity. This survey ineludeaj a district of about eight square miles. llr. W. E. \Veber, of the Polytechnic College of Philadelphia, voluntjlered and gave cheerful and valuable aid in the field-work. 'l'he details of Mr. Herge».eimer's maps show decided aptitude and facility in reconnaissance. Hydrograpkic development l!.ff Montauk Point, N.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Section I with the steamer ~n, Lieutenant Commander Phelps examined the eastern approach to Montauk, in the immediate vicinity of which the steamer Great Eastern had struck in 1862. Several days were passed in establi~hing positions, and in running lines of soundi11gs, the result of which was that the Corwin was finally anchored 011 the rock by which the great steamer was <lamaged. Lieutenant Commander ~ Phelps reports as follows respecting it : "'l'his rock Las twenty-four feet water. on it at low tide, and is a mile and a half (nautical) from .Montauk Point light-house, and bears from it cast 14° 45' north (true.) It is apparently the southern point of a ledge extenaing to tl1e northward about a mile and a quarter. This, on being developed, gave from four to six and three-quarter fathoms on a genernl course N. by W. ~ W._and S. by E. g E. (true.)" "About half a nautical mile, and N. 35° 30' W. from the Great Eastern rock, is another, (or a projecting point of the ledge,) on wli.lch there is twenty-eight feet w.ater at low tide. This rock bears from Montauk light-house E. 34° 41' N. (true,) and is about a mile and three-eighths from it. 'I'wo points of the rock give only twenty-eight feet, with deeper water between." The party of Lieutenant Commander Phelps determined positions by one hundred and thirty-two angles, and recorded thirteen hundred soundings in making the examination. A copy of the report, accompanied by a sketch ehowing the soundings, was forwarded to the Light-house Board in September, with recommendation that a buoy should be placed on the southern eud of the ledge on which the Great Eastern had struck. Hydrographic examination in l'lcw York lwrbor-In a communication addressed to me at the end of April, by Russell Sturgis, esq., president of the Board of Pilot Commissioners of New York, it was stated that, by order of the board, all matter excavated or dredged from the slips along the city front since 1859 had been deposited on Oyster island, or in the channel near it. Request was made at the same time for such an examination as might determine whether or not the deposits had affected the capacity of the channel. The examination deBhed was made in June, by the party of Lien tenant Commander Phelps, with the steamer Corwin. Soundings were made between GovernOl''s island and Robbin's reef, and additional boat lines we~on the Jersey Flats. The results of this survey were obtained under such adverse circumstances as strong currents, high winds, and smoky weather; but, as reported, a comparison with the soundings made in the same vicinity in 185;) Rhows no material change. The probable effect of the deposits with reference to the action of the tides and currents will be made the subject of further study. The statistics of the work done in New York harbor by the party in the Corwin are as follows: :Miles run in sounding .·····.....·...·....··....···. , . · · . . . . · . · · . . · . . . . . 61 Angles measured ·.......···...·.·..··.·..·..··.·....···.. , · · · · . . · . · · · . 327 Casts of the lead . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . · . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,382 The chart of this resurvey ha8 been inked, and a copy of it fur:nisl1ed to the Pilot Commissioners. Hydrograpliy ef l'ludson river, ].;. ¥.-This work has been completed by soundings made this year above Hudson city, and extended to New Baltimore, where the work of recent seasons joins a survey which was made in 1855, and by soundings between Albany and Troy. The work of this season in the Huds·m was taken up by Mr. W.W. Harding, on the 1st of July, with a party in the schooner Caswell. .As last year, and previously, arrangements were made for keeping the shore-line survey even with the hydrography. Mr. Harding revised some of the soundings made last year in the neighborhood of Malden, and then continued the regular hydrography up the river, to a point above Coxsackie. Mr. Alexander Strausz, who had served with I,ieutenant Commanding Wainwright in the survey of the Hudson above New Baltimore, where the soundings of this year were to join with the work done in 1855, took charge of the hydrographic party in the middle of September. He was aided by Messrs. 0. S. Hein and H. G. Ogden, who had served in the work of this season near Coxsackie, and by Mr. P. l<'razcr, jr., the last two transferred from the party of Assistant Edwards, as was also the schooner A~o, whfoh had been used by him in Section I. By the 1st o.f October M1·. Strausz had defined the channel between Coxsackie and Stuyvesant, which is made intricate by the Kinderl1ook Flats, and by the middle of that month joined soundings above Stuyvesant with the previous work at New Baltimore. He then proceeded to Albany, and sounded the river between that city and Troy, closing the hydrography early in November.

The original chart of the work is now in the office, with the journals of soundings and angles. Mr. Strant'Z had pa8sed the former part of the surveying yem in active duty, which will be ~tated under the head o~ Section VIII. l\Ir. Harding was employed during the same period in Section V, and fo now preparing to resume duty there. Mr. Strausz will be engaged in hydrogrnphic service in Section IV. Survey ef League island, Delaware rii·er.-In the latter part of January, at the rerpw~t of the Navy Department, Assistant Davidson was directed to make a plane-table survey of the north end of League i~l:md, and to sound out the narrow channel which passed behin<l tl1e island. He repOl'ted the i·ef'ults early in February, and with his topographical sheet turned in a comparative map, on wl1ich the changes which lmve taken place since the first survey arc clearly shown. The topography was basecl on twenty-two points, determined for the purpose by trianguhi.tion. For reducing his soundings to mean low water, l\fr. Davidson -transferred the bench-mark at Red Bank ferry. His full and explicit report demonstrates the causes that are concerned in the change of the hydrography. H.11drography around Delaware Breakwatcr.-Thc vicinity of the harbor at the DPbware breakwater was sounded <luring the :first two weeks in Augmit by Captain C. P. Patterson, hy<lrographic inspector of the Coast Survey. 8inee the completion of this hydrograpl1y a comparative chart has been made at the office for the Chief Engineer of the army, at whose request the survey was made. Captain l'atterson reports that the point of Cape Henlopen has extended two hundred and fifty yards to the northward since 1842. A few changes in the depth of water were noticed, which, although not such as to affect navigation or to make the harbor;;less available, are of much importance in reg9"rd to the permanency of the breakwater. The statistics of tiie hydrography are as follow: Miles run in sounding. . . . . · . . · · · . · · . . · · . . . . . . . . · . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . · 70 Angles measured........... . · . . . . · . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 265 Number of soundings .·..··.................................·..........· 3, 417 The expense incurred in this survey was defrayed by the Engineer departmeut. Tidal ohsrn1ations.-'l'he self-registering tide-gauge at Governor's island (New York harbor) has been very successfully kept in operation during the year by Mr. R. T. Bassett, there having been fewer interruptions, probably, than in any other year. }'or comparison with the record at Governor's island, the observations with a box-gauge at Brooklyn have been regularly continued in the day-time. Meteorological observations have been steadily recorded at the permanent tidal station. SECTION Ill.

A preliminary edition of Potomac river, sheet No. 4, from Indian Head to the Chain bridge, and a military map of southeastern Virginia, have been engraved on stone, and considerable additions havo bcm mnde to the genera} map of Virginia in colors. Triangulation qf tlte environ.s ef Baltimore, ll:ld.-This work was takep. up by Sub-A~lfistant C.H. Boyd, on the 1st of August, and WflS done under the direction of Colonel Ra~olds, chief engineer 8th army corps, in order to furui~h the basis for the plane-table survey of ground that would be commanded by the military defences of the city of Balti11Jore. The triangulation, 11.S for as dcaired for that purpose, was concluded on the 2'ifth of the month. Mr. Bo~ was aided by a working party of soldiers which he had employed in similar duty in the vicinity of 'Vashington, and which were transferred for the service at Baltimore by an order from the commander-in-chief. At one of the stations near that city a tripod was required, with a scaffold thirty feet high, for observing with the theodolite.

C.-At the request of Major Gooeral Bar'!tbrd, in charge of the fortifications, who desired to have notes of the elevation of each fort above the tide. level of the Potomac, Assistnnt C. A. ~hott was directed in January to make such horizontal and vertical measurements as would ·furnfal1 tl1e required data. This was done at ii1tervals in the course of the spring, when the range of duties in the computing divhiion of the office concurred with favorable weather for the use of the thcur!olite in tlw field. The nperati ms concluded at the end of May were carried on under the general direction of Lieutenant Colonel J. Macomb, United States engineers. Some of the positions and heights were furnished immediately to the plane-table parties then engaged in completingJ'he survey of the environs of the District of Columbia. No signals were erected by the party of Mr. chott, but liB the flagstaffs were in all eases observed on as signals, each station was of necessity occupied eccentrically. The labor of computation was thereby increased, but outlay for materials and fixtures was avoided. Each of the stations was visited but once, the measurements of horizontal angles being repeated three times, and the vertical measurements four times, and in some cases more. The statistics of the horizontal or triangular measures are as follows:

I have referred elsewhere to his co-opcration_in the expe1·iments designed to settle the qnestiun as to the proper treatment of magnetic needles on iron vessels. Notes giving the geographical positions, the heights, and the distances intervening between the fortifications, were furnished to General Barnard in March, and further information of the same kind as the results were reached. 'l'opograpliy ef the suburh.s ef Baltimore city, 11-ld.-The advance of the rebel army in the latter part of June seeming to threaten the city of Baltim·n·e, application was made to me for the services of topographers to map the ground which it was intended by the military authorities to occupy with defensive works. 'l'lie calJ of Colonel J.jH . .Ale~nder, acting chief engineer of defences, wa11 immediately met by the assignment of Mr. .A. Lindeiliiohl from the Coast Survey office. For the rapid reconnaissance then needed, Sub-Assistant J. W. Donn was also detailed. On tlie return of the chief engineer of the middle department, Colonel W. F. Il~nolds, wl10 at the juncture was at Harper's Ferry, it was deemed advisable that a full topographical survey should be made of the ground extending three miles beyond the city limits of Baltimore on that part of the northern and Wef!tern sides of the city which were to be defended. This survey was taken up by Mr. J\'nn, and was prosecuted during the month of July as far as the triangulation points allowed. .As already stated, additional points were furnit1heil hy;Sub-Assistant Boyd in .August; aft?1" which time the topography was steadily continued. Sub-.Assistant rMm was withdrawn early fo October tj meet a call for topographical service near Chattanooga, Tennessee, and yas relieved byJ Sub-Assistant Iani/>lla, who is still at work in the pnvirons of Baltimore.

For joining the contour lineH which lrncl been run by the topographers before engaged, Mr. Dlfun determined the position and height of several points under the direction of Colonel Macomb, and then took up plane-table work in the vicinity of Fort Meigs, for extending the District survey, as already stated. Topograph.y of R·Mier's Blvjj, Md.-At the request of the Engineer department, a minute survey has been made of tlte Maryland bank of the Potomac from Oxen Hill to Broad creek, and from the shore two miles back, or to the bounds of the valley of St. Philip. The,ground surveyed includes Rosier's Bluff and its vicinity, or about four miles of the eastern bank of th~ ftver opposite to Alexandria. This work was commenced early in December, 1862, by Assistant A. M. l'ilJirrison. In contouring the topography of the bluff, the horizontal curves were carefully levelled and drawn in to represent successive eleYations of ten feet. '!'hose of other pa11:s of the ground show heights of twenty feet. All the surface details are comprised on the sheet that could be callccl for in military purposes. i '.rhe survey was made on a large scale, and when com pl etc, a tracing of it was fumisl1ed to General Ba¥rd, chief engineer of the defences of Washington. 1\fr. Harrison, being in cl1arge of tlJP drawing divi8ion of the office when called on for this survey, occupied at intervais, parts of the first three months of the ye.ar in its execution, bis aid, Mr. H. W. Bache, continuing the field-work when Assistant Harrison was neceRsarily abRent. The closing of this survi;y waR followed by a fort.lier request from the chief engineer for a special topographical map of tl1e ground around J<~ort Lyon, on t;hc south side of Hunting creuk, below Alexandria. It was also thought advisable that a close1· delineationj should be made of the shore-line of the Potomac between Alexandria and the "Clmin bridge." ,Mr. HiM-ison, with these objects in view, organized a second pmty, to be in charge of Sub-AssiRtant C.H. W>yd, as already stated, intending, in person, to make the survey around Fort Lyon. The work was beguu, but was deferred by a request from General Bar~rd for a planetable survey of Jone~'s Point, which juts out into the Potomac below Alexandria. Tl1is duty was immediately taken u11, and was completed on the 27th of April. A map of the point, showing the character of all the objects then on it,/nnd the surface contour for elcYations of two feet, was furnished to the chief engineer. Assistant Ifarr:ilin then took up the levelling rcqui1·cd for the topography about Fort/Lyon, and continued that service until the 11th of Ma,y, when bis party was transferred to Assistant C. liq Bache. All the requisite points of triaugulation and level r¥"a.rks covering the area to be mapped, as also a carefully prepared projection, had been provided by Mr. Har'li!'son, who was soon after assigned to plane-table duty in Section I.

A tracing frum the topographical sheet has been furnished to the chief engineer of defences. Triangulation between Alexandria, Va., and Georgetown, D. C.-Points being desired for extending the plane-table survey of the vicinity of Alexandria beyond Fort I... you, in accordance with the wishes of the chief engineer of defences for the city of vVashiugton, the angular l]leasurements necessary were taken up on th.e 1st and completed by the 28th of April. Assistant A. M. ~rrioon had the general direction of the work, the plane-table surveys being also in his charge. Major General~~unard fumi~hed details of men, aJ_Jd the Quartermaster's department the requisite means for moving from station to station. Sub-Assistant ~d conducted the field-work, and after completing the determinations near Alexandria, ex:tended the triangulation up the Potomac to Georgetown. In doing so, the positions of the hydrographic signals used by the party of Captain Patterson in sounding that part of the river, were determined, and also points for a resurvey of the shore-line. Thirteen stations were occupied, and twenty-seven points determined by eleven hundred and four measurements with the theodolite. Slwre-li'Tte survey ef tlu{ Potomar:, betweeu Alexandria a'Ttrl GeorgPtoum, D.

This duty occupied his party until the 26th of July. Thirty mifos of shore-line were traced. An aggregate of five miles of wharf-line is shown on the plane-table sheet, and ten miles/of road and canal. The resulting map has been inked and is now at the office, with the records of anguiaJ determinations on which it depends. Topograpltical service 'Ttear Fredericksburg, Va.-Assistant C. 11r/ Bache, who had continued the topographical work.near Bladensburg, under the orders of Colonel Macomb, :ifter the close of the previous surveying year, was ass~ned to duty with the left grand division of the army of the Potomac, and r<.'ported to l-Iajor General }'ra'\iklin on the 9th of Decembf'r, 1862. Ile crossed the Rappahannock with the army on the 12th, and after its return to the north bank was employed in making surveys, with tlw compass and chain, of the road to King George Court House, and of the lateral roads between that and the Potomac on one side and the Rappahannock on the other. General service was also r~dered by reconnoitering and reporting the eondition of other roads in the vicinity of Fredericksburg, with jreference to their fitness for the passage of artillery and infantry. The road surveys were plotted in .Jam;iltrY and made over to the military authorities for the use of the army. In the previous season Assistant Bache had executed the topography of the nortl1 bank of the Rappahannock opposite to Fredericksburg, and had then extended his examiuation of roads in two directions as far as the Potomac. He was employed during the summer iu the surveys for defensive works near Philadelphia, in Section IJ.

the head of Section VIII. He was employed in Section I during the summer, but in September proceeded again under orders to join the army of the Gulf. The subsequent occupation of Assistant vVest will be referred to in the notices of work in Section IV. He was also engaged in Section II. Examination near Winter Quarter &lwal.-lt having been brought to my notice that tl1e steamer Baltic had struck, or was supposed to have struck, on a shoal off the boundary-line between Maryland and Virginia, in the autumn of 1862, Lieutenant Commander T. S. l'helps, United States navy, was directed to make a thorough examination of the locality with the surveying steamer Corwin. No sucl1 feature to the eastward and near to vViuter Quarter shoal existed when the chart of that part of the coast was published. The examination by the party in the 22;,~n was made in April last, and the result is stated in the Appendix (No. 6.) It will be seen by reference to it that careful soundings, made under favorable circumstances, gave no indication of the existence of a shoal outside of the Winter Quarter shoal. The conclusion of Lieutenant Commander Phelps relative to the non-existence of the supposed danger was published in 1\fay.. Hydrograpliy ef tlw Potomac rioer.-The steady labors of Lieutenant Commander Phelps, with his party in the steamer Corwin, as stated in my report of last year, had far advanced the survey of the Potomac towards completion when my report was handed in. 'The soundings were continued above Indian Head during tl1e winter of 1862-'63, and joined at Alexandria with the hydrography of the party of Captain C. P. Patterson, who had closed work in the stretch between Alexandria and Georgetown in the previous autumn. Lieutenant Commnnder Phelps, before taking up the plotting of bis chart, made additional soundings in the "Kettle Bottoms," and thus remarks on the character of that part of the work: "The soundings on the "Kettle Bottoms" were made very close, six hundred and fifty-two miles being run in developing the shoals, or between Lower Cedar I~oint and the neighborhood of Cob Point. I believe that we succe<ided in finding most of the lumps, but they are abrupt, and apparently cone-shaped, and some are so very small that it is possible others may have escaped between casts of the lead. They seem to be composed principally of oysters and sand. Ten feet was the least water found on them." Of the Nanjemoy Reach of the Potomac, Lieutenant CommandGr Phelps states that the shoal~ appear to be formed of sand, gravel, rocks, and oyster shells. Further up the river they are of sand and pebbles. The southern bank of the Potomac.: was traversed by bands of rebel soldiers while the party in the Corwin was prosecuting the hydrography; but, though often within gunshot, the boat parties were in no instance molested. These bands were supposed to be concerned in receiving and aiding the contraband traffic across the river. In his progress up the Potomac the place chiefly used for crossing with contraband articles became known to Lieutenant Commander Phelps, and was promptly reported to the naval authorities. Between Blakistone island and Indian Head eight tidal stations were occupied. The mean rise and fall of the tide was found to be about one foot and five-tenths. The aggregate statistics of the hydrographic work below Alexandria show the thoroughness of the survey. They include those given in my last annual report, which was turned in while the party was still on dnty afloat: Miles run in sounding. · . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . · . . 2, 44 7 Angles observed .. _... _ ................ _...... . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10, 551 Casts of the lead. . . . . _....................... - _..·. _...·.. _. . . . . . . · 165, 048 Length of river course sounded, (miles)....... . .. - _................ _... 77 The chart of the Potomac, in four sheets, was spe<idily issued, and has been largely distributed for the use of the naval and transport service. In the middle of February Lieutenant Commander Phelps, on learning that Major General Hooker, then in command of the army of the Potomac, needed information as to the soundings and landings on the Virginia shore to the southward and ea11tward of Aq_uia creek, supplied what was desired. In April the steamer Corwin proceeded to New York, and was there employed in duty which has been mentioned under the head of hydrography in Section II. Later in the season the party was employed in Section I. The recommendations sent in by Lieutenant Commander Phelps for additional buoys in the lower part of the Potomac, and in r('gard to changes desirable in the position of some already placed, are contained in the Appendix (No. 29.) ltiag'lftttic observatims.-After his return from Section I, in which he had occupied a number of stations,

FROM CA.PE HENRY, VIRGINIA., TO CAPE FEAR, NORTH CAROLINA, INCLUDING PART OF THE COAST OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA.

The three parties sent to this section worked under the orders of Major General J-1. Foster. In the triangulation of the Neuse river, which was executed by one of the parties, the regular progress of the survey in Section IV has been advanced. The two topographical parties moved and acted at special call for military purposes. Their work between the Neuse and Tar rivers, and in the vicinity of Washington, North Carolina, as well as that of the triangulation party, is referred to in a communication from General Foster, which I have placed in the Appendix, (No. 26.) 0FFICE·WORK.-The drawing and engraving of preliminary charts of Hatteras inlet and of Oregon inlet, North Carolina, have been completed. Progress has been made in the engraving of coast chart No. 37, Cape Henry to Currituck sound. The drawing of coast chart No. 47, Bogue inlet to Barren inlet, North Carolina, has been continued, and the engraving of the same, and that of coast chart No. 48, Barren inlet to Lockwood's Folly inlet, embmcing Cape Fear and approaches, has been commenced. A lithographic edition of the latter, in a preliminary form, aud also of general coast chart No. V, Chesapeake entrance to Ocracoke inlet, have been produced for the u~e of the North Atlantic blockading squadron, Admiral S. P. Lee; and a map of the mountain region of North Carolina and Tennessee, including also parts of the States of Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, Georgia arrd South Carolina, has been drawn and engraved on stone for the use of the armies in the field. Trianqulation ef Neuse river, N. C.-F'or t:fiis work a party was assigned to the charge of A~sistant G. A. Fahfeld, and the use of the schooner JameJ fuJJ,Jor transportation. The vessel left York on the 2d, and reaehed Newbern on the 12th of .February. In the course of a few days Mr. Fail'lield reported to Major GeaJaI l<~oster, who had just returned to the department, and tendered the services of himself and his party for special duty. No occasion immediately arising for their employment in military surveys, the triangulation of the Neuse river was commenced, and in the course of the season completed from New,bern downward as far as Goose creek. The site of the preliminary base which was measured by Mr. Fai~ld in }larch is at the forks of the Neuse and Trent rivers. The measured line was found to be 1,592.09 metres in length. Every facility requisite for this work, and for that dependent upon it, not afforded by the outfit of the party, was supplied by General l!~oster. Brigadier General Prince also made kind offers of assistance to further the survey. / Sub-Assistants P. C. F~fost and Cleveland . ckwcll, who were to be employed directly in connexion with the army of General p..ytcr, aided Mr. Fai eld, the last named in the base line, and the former in erecting signals for the triangulation.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Mr. Horace AndJon aided in th triangulation, and accompanied .Assistant Fairfield in duty which has been noticed under Section I in this report. Eervice m the military departml"lit of North Carolina-Besides the regular work of the survey aeoomplished this season in the sect.ion, and 11oticed under the precedi11g l1ead, the circumstances of the military sep\rice in North Carolina at the openinfi of the present year led to a very effective co-operation bJ' .Assistant l'. C. "Mv est and Sub-Assistant Clevelanl\ftockwell with the forces under command of Major Gen¢1 Foster. Mr. Rockwell reached Newbern on the 2d of February, just after the departure of the general. On being advised by Bi;igadier General Prince of the neecl of a topographical survey of the approaches to the city, that work was immediately commenced, a11d was for a short time steadily prosecuted. Frequent calls, lwwever, were made in th~ following two months for :Mr. Rockwell's services in reconnaissance, and for the compilation of such maps as rapid tours would afford. On the 16th of March he was ordered to make a thorough reconnaissance of the roads and of the country generally on the northern side of the Neuse. For this purpose the 85th regiment New York volunteers, Colonel Belknap, was assigned as escort. Mr. Rockwell was engaged in this service until the 1st of .April, and brought back with him material for a reliable map of the district within a circuit of teu to twelve miles. Some time after, when General Foster was still at Washington, on the''l'ar river, and during the siege of that place, Mr. Rockwell accompanied General Prince to the Tar river at his request, to reconnoitre the battery of the enemy at Hill's Point. The garri.llon of Washington was relieved soon after by a force led by General Foster in person. Under his direction Mr. Rockwell accompanied the detachment and completed the map of the road between the besieged town and Newbern. At 'Washington he sketched the grnund held by the enemy, their batteries and field-works, arid also the lines of defence ellected to repel the attack, and the country adjoining, and furg(shed copies of the map to General Foster and General Prince. Early in May Sub-Assistant RockM;n was sent on a reconnaissance with four companies of cavalry, with direction to pass through Pollockvillc, Young's Cross-roads, Pelatier's Mills, and by White Oak river, to return by way of Newport barracks. Lieutenant Colonel Lewis, of the 3d regiment New York cavalry, was in command of the escort. One of the enemy's mounted videttes was captured at Young's Gross-roads. On learning soon after that a compauy of rebel cavalry had passed down the same road, the purpose of the expedition was changed to a pursuit. 'l'he enemy was taken by surprise at Pelatier's Mills. Sub-Assistant !Wckwell rode in the.cavalry charge, the result of which was the capture of thirteen prisoners with their arms, and thirty-five horses with their accoutrements. '!'hough the rapidity of the march ou the enemy's camp did not admit of gathering local information, Mr. Rockwell noted that the command had passed .over the more elevated part of a great swampy trnck between the Trent and White Oak rivers, and th11t the railroad to Beaufort could be approachf'd from the southward for a stretch of about twenty-seven miles, only by a few swampy roads branching from the main road which runs along White Oak river. Mr. Roekwell had previously added to his map of the upper side of the Neuse by attendiag the command of General Spinola in a movement towards Washington hefme it was relieved. In .June he was .relieved from duty in this section .and assigned to service in Section I. The sense of Major General !foster of the aid afforded in his department by the parties sent t!iere is given in a communication which he addressed to me on the 1st of June, a copy of which will be foui#d in the .Appendix, (No. 26.) Sub-Assistant Rocl~ell took up work in Section I at the opening of the summer season, and after an interval in .July employed in surveys for defences at Philadelphia, returned to the coast of Maine, and was there engaged until the close of the surveying year. He is now on duty in the military department of Virginia and North Carolina. / ,; Sub-Assistant P. C. F. w}:t reported to Major General\roster on the 18th of March, but a movement beh1g then on foot in the military department, there was no immediate occasion for his assignll1I1t to duty in reconnaissance outside of the ground held by the United S&ates forces. He therefore joined the party of Assistant }'airfield, and assisted in the triangulation of the Neuse river, as already stated. While this work was advancing, Mr. West was called on for a reconnaissauce of Wilkinson's Point, near the mouth of the Neuse, and for an examination of the northeast bank of the river up to Fort .Anderson, opposite to Newbern. This was done before the garrison at Washington, North ~lina, yaa relieved from the siege of that )>ost by the rebel forces in April. Soon after the return <Tf General F . .r to Newbern, Sub-Assistant West was directed to map the country along the railroad above Morehead City, and, if practicable, a stretch of four miles on each side of it, but other calla from the military authorities intervening, but litde pr<:>gress was made ill this special survey. He continued in general reconnrusaance duty until relieved by General Foster. At the end of J nne, and beginning of July, Mr. ~twas in a-0tiv-e military duty on the 1tatr of General

W. F. in the vicinity of Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He was, later in the season, engaged in topography near Philadelphia, but the application of General Smith for his services being renewed in September, he reported to that commander for duty at Chattanooga, Tennessee. At the request of Admiral Lee, a party has been assigned to work under his orders in Albemarle sound.

SECTION V.
FROM CAPE FEAR, N. C., TO ST. MARY'S RIVER, GEORGIA, INCLUDING THE COAST OF PART OF NORTH CAROLINA, AND THE COAST OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA.

In three localities of this section the regular work of the survey has been advanced by the assignment of three parties. One has made a eomplete hydrograpl1ic resurvey of the channels into Port Royal sound, and a special survey inside for the use of the blockading squadron. 'l'he northern part of Hilton Head island, with the defences and structures put up in 1862, has been surveyed and mapped. The same party mapped the part of Beaufort island now occupied by field works, and on the coast of Georgia made a topographical survey of the shores of W assaw sound. This work was extended to the limits usual on the coast of Georgia, though the preBence of the insurgents in Borne places rendered its prosecution somewhat dangerous. A considerable part of the hydrography of the sound was executed by a third party. In addition to the regular work just alluded to, the party acting more immediately under the orders of Admiral DuPont, made special reconnai8sances which will be described in this chapter, and performed also essential duties connected with the light-house service between 'Vinyah bay and the mouth of St. John's river. Amongst theBe was the sounding of Charleston bar in advance of the attack made upon the rebel defences in April. General despatch service was rendered by this party in addition to the regular work to be mentioned in the body of this chapter. The testimony of .Flag-Officer L'uPont has been explicit in regard to the assistance offered in the operations of the blockading squadron, by the assignment of the party to its usual site of work. Appendix No. 26 contains also a testimnnial from Major General }~oster for incidental service rendered, in bringing into port one of his transports which had been disabled and was in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy in the vicinity of Winyah bay. The arrangements for work in the section were substantially the same as were made last year, the larger party of the former season being divided into three, all working as before, with three vessels. The parties returned north in June. One of them was reassigned for the smvcy of Charle!' ton bar in the beginning of October, and the others are now about to follow. O.ffice-work.-Tbe drawing and engraving of sheet No. III, of a general chart of the Atlantic coast, Cape Hatteras to Mosquito inlet, and of Calibogue sound and Skull creek, forming the inland passage between Tybee roads and Port Royal sound, as a preliminary chm·t have been completed. 'l'be drawing ()f coast chart No. 53, Rattlesnake shoals to St. Helena sound, has been continued, and the engraving of the same commenced. Progress has been made in the drawing and engraving of a chart of Port Royal sound. with Beaufort, Broad, and Chechessee rivers, and of Wassaw sound. A map of the coast region of South Carolina and Georgia, from Bull's bay to Ossabaw sound, and a map of James island and Stano river, have been eng11aved on stone, and a map and chart of Charleston haroor has been lithographed on the scale of the original .tiurYeys for use in the 8iege operations. 'drograpkic reconnaissanct: in TVinyah. hay, . C.-This was the £rst service called for by Admiral the arrival of the party of Assistant outelle at Port the 27th of November. The steamer Mb sailed for Winyah bay on the 1st of December. Mr. Bou)(:Ue examined the Bottle channel, and reported it as being then the best entrance t() that harbor, but the stormy east wind that prevailed during the limited time given to the work allowed only a partial reconnaissance. The party returned to Port Royal ()n the 5th. An additional buoy was set for leading through the Bqttle channel into Winyah hay, and a tra.cing showing the soundings was forwarded to the office. Sailin~d-ctiona for the entrance of Georgetown J;iaroor were at once furnished to the admiral. On tho/'12th of January, and under the order of the admiral, Assistant telle, with his party, in the etee.mer ~~·accompanied the engineer who had. been detailed by the Light-house Board to examine and report in reference to the aids for naviga.tfon between Port Royal and the St. John's river, Florida. The p&l'ty ha.cl previously delivered imP.ortant despatches to Captain GOOon, the senior naval officer off Charleston, and' on the return had, by order ()f the admiral, called at Stono entrance and at North Edisto.

OF

On the ht of February the Btbb delivered despatches and ordnance stores at Georgetown entrance, South Carolina. Leaming thel'e that the army steamer Pilot Boy, of General Foster's command, had burst her boilers, aoo was at anchor near the hostile shore, about twenty miles northeast of the mouth of Winyal1 bay, Mr. BoiMlle proceeded at once to her anchorage, took the vessel in tow, and delivered her at Hilton Head. This service was formally acknowledged in a letter addressed to him by order of General :Foster, a cupy of which will be found in the Appendix, (No. 26.) Rec1mnafssa11ce ef Cliarlnt'f'l liarhor, S. C.-On the 30th of January, under special orders from Admiral D\t'Pont, the steamer Wib was anchored inside of the stations occupied by the blockading vessels, near the bar of tlie old shiI, channel of Charleston harbor. Assistant Boutelle then procee<led in with his party in boats, and returned on two nights without diEcovery, after accomplishing the service required. The' results were at once made known to the flag-officer, and were adopted in passing in the iron-clads for the attack which was made early in April upon :Fort Sumter. This examination, though it was made at night, satisfied Mr. Boutelle that the "Pumpkin Hill" clial'nel was the best, and that view was confhmed by the soundings made on t.he bar on the lith of April. l\lr. 1flatt and Sub·~<\.ssistant Bradford, in the steamer Keokuk, assisted in placing the buoys just previous to the attack, and the party in tlie Bibb kept the bar lighted at night to facilitate the movements of the gunboats. '!'he rniling lines then cl108eu differ very little from those drawn by Mr. :Boutelle as the result of the night reconnaissance at the end of January. His special knowleclge in regard to the harbor of South Carolina, and his fitness for the service being unq11estionable, he lmd been much employed in piloting. In that line of duty he had taken the frigate 1Vabash, and all the heavy vessels of the South Atlantic blockading squadron into Port Royal in the autumn of 1861, and detachments from that squadron over the bars of all the Atlantic harbors between Charleston and St. Augustine. Mr. Boutelle's offer to pilot in the flagship for the attack on Fort Sumter, was declined by the admiral, on the ground that it might be attended with greater hazard than had usually attached to similar service perfortjied for the squadron. M1·. RolM-t Platt, the executive officer of the Ribb, was permitted to pilot the Weehawken, (monitor,) Captain John Rodgers, to the position selected for trying the effect of her guns on l!'ort Sumter. Mr. Platt had been long attached to the Coast Survey, and was known as an excellent pilot. After the attack at Charleston entrance he was retained by Admiral DuPont for further service in the squadron. On the 13th of April the Bibb Teturned to Port Royal, taking with her in tow from Charleston bar the monitor Montauk. It was then found that the state of the Bibb'8 engine would not permit the use of the vessel in active co-01,eration with the naval squadron. With the consent of the admiral, therefore, the party resumed the ordinary duties of the survey. From copies of several communications of similar tenor from Admiral DuPont, which were sent to me with the report of Assistant Boutelle, I have placed in the Appendix (No. 26) the one which refers to the sounding of the channels of Charleston harbor. , During the action at Fort Sumter Mr. Plc'tt was knocked down in the turret of the Weehawken, and was temporarily disabled by the breaking of a bolt under the concussion of a heavy shot from one of t;he rebel batteries. He was again at his post bef/Jre the withdrawal of the vessel. 'rhe· mention made of his conduct by Captain Rodgers, of the W echavken, in his report to the admiral, led to his appointment as acting master in the navy. It was clearly ascertained by Mr. Boutelle, while working, in December, 1862, on the coast of South Carolina, that the rebel privateer which was sunk by a broadside from the United States frigate St. Lawrence, early in the course of the war, was the schooner Petrel, ·belouging to the ~1'.ItlY· The particulars of her seizure by the State authol"ities of South Carolina, in December, 1860, were given in my annual report

The small steam tender Fire Fly, alw belonging to the Survey, and seized at Charleston in December, 1860, was mmd for some time by the insurgents on the Savannah river. In October, 1862, she accidentally took fire at her wharf in Savannah and was consumed. This fact was communicated to Mr. &utellejiy one of the Savannah pilots, who came within the federal lines in the following month. j Hydrograpliy ef Port Royal sound, S. C.-Assistant Boutelle, with a party in the steamer B~, aa.iled from New York on the 23d of November, 1862, and arrived at Port Royal on the lillifh, where he reported to Admiral DuPont for duty similar to that which had employed the Coast Sjtrvey parties in the preceding year. After a short visit, under orders, to Winyah bay, from which the Bibi\ returned on the 6th of December,

a survey was made of a Rite at Bay Point, suitable for a coaling station for the navy. This work included the determination of the depth to which piles must be driven to give stability to the wharf. A comprehensive report was ma<le to the flag-officer ou the 12th on the topographieal and hydrographie facilities of the sit-e, accompanied by a plan for the structures and full details respecting the current at Bay Point, the rise and of tide, the location of timber, saw-mills, and the like. The topography was executed by Mr. W.W. H~ng· Soundings in the vicinity of the proposed wharf were carried out to a depth of five fathoms. Mr. Boutelle at the same time presented a plan for lighting and marking the southeast channel into Port Royal. suggested by the use of elevated platforms which he had found necessary in the primary triangulation of the coast of South Ca1·olina. Before completing the survey of the coaling station, it was found that the southeast channel had shifted somewhat to the southward iu the course of the year. This change, though nowhere considerable, required a transfer of the buoys, and that duty was at once taken up. As a preliminary, soundings were commenced on Martin's Industry shoal on the 12th of December. The pressure tide-gauge, invented by Captain (now Major) E. B. Hunt, United States engineers, was at the same time put in use at the light-ship. Mr. Boutelle observed that the depth of the south channel into Port Royal had somewhat increased during the year. The examination included part of the Gaskin Bank, and, generally, the approaches to Port Royal entrance. Bad weather hindered progi-ess somewhat, but the work was pushed by the use of the steamer and two boats, and was rapidly advanced in January. While thus engaged, assistance was also rendered in forwarding to her destination, for duty on the Florida reef, the steamer Vixeg. which needed coal. The elastic bag of the pressure tide-gauge at Martin's Industry light-ship was sunk in nine fathoms water, with about one hundred and fifty feet of flexible tube attached. On the 23d of December the registering dial of the instrument indicated a tidal rise of nine feet and a half. Frequent calls for the services of the Bibb in delivering despatches, and in other duties incident to the naval service, protracted the completion of the hydrography at the approaches to Port Royal entrance. It was at the same time known that important changes had taken place in the depth at some places, and that a revision of the chart was very desirable for the use of the deep draught-vessels of the squadron. At the end of January, and in the beginning of April, the party was again recalled to Charleston entrance, as has been already mentioned. Returning to Port Royal after the attack of the 7th of April, Mr. Boutelle sttrveyed and buoyed the northeast channel and reported sailing directions. The concluding work off Port Royal was the sounding and setting buoys in the channel west of Fishing Rip, and the marking by buoys of the middle ground of the harbor and of other dangerous spots in the approaches. The statistics of the hydrograpl1y are here appended: Miles run in sounding ··..·......·... _ ·....··..·....·...·...·....· _ . _ . 1,409 Casts of the lead ..·....·. _ ...·.....··.. _ ...···.··. _ ...·.··.... _ ..·· 57,000 Besides the tide-gauge at the light-ship, Assistant Boutelle had constant observations made at Station creek. In reference to results, as bearing on the reduction of the daily soundings to "mean low water," he remarks: "The difference of time and of rise and fall of the tide at these two stations (about twelve miles apart) a.re frequently very great, and apparently depend much upon the state of the wind and sea.. The mean difference in time is about one hour." The duties in eonnex~·on ith the light-houses of this district which ,were performed by Mr. Boutelle occupied much of his time in e latter pa.rt of the lea.son. . j Sub-Assistant J. S. ford, Mr. W. W. In/ding, and Mr. P. Plazer, jr., were attae4ed to the party in the st.ea.mer Bibb. Assistant B-lle returned to New York with the vessel on the 11'1. of June.

party in the schooner CasJil, reached Port Royal on the 3d of Jiuaxy, and after reporting to Admiral niont, proceeded to Wassaw and took up the plane-table survey. A party )Was at the same time assigned to piake
soundings while the shore-line Will! being traced. Sub-Assistant lWfunis was aided by Mr. R. H. 'Moott. 'l'he topogl'Rphical survey was continued until the increased activity on the side of the insurgents made it necessary to desist. The rebel steamer Naakville, destroyed by the fire of the United States gunboat Montauk, in the lower part of the Ogeechee river, and the Fingal, (or Atlanta,) since captured by the Weehawken, (monitor,} were then preparing to run out, either for the destruction of government transports or for adventures at sea. {Both of the surveying parties at work in W assaw sound closed only when notified to do so by Admiral Dflliont, in coqseqnence of the state of affairs to which I have alluded. , The sheet executed by Mr. D\binis comprises the coast of Georgia from Savannah river southward and westward to Odingsell's river. It includes the whole of w·assaw sound, and the mouths of the rivers which fall into it; the greater part of Wassaw island; Great and Little Tybee islands; part of Cabbage island, and Cock!!pur and Long island, in the Savannah river. From the coast line the plane-table survey was carried towards the interior at an average of from four to five miles. Besides the discovery of a schooner /Which had grounded in attempting to run the b!Ockade of Savannah river. and of which the party in the CaWvcll took possession and turned over to the naval authorities, the oply epecial incident attending the work was a demonstration made by the enemy towards the capture of Mr. TaNott. In the latter part of March he camped out a few days to complete the topographical survey of Little Tybee island, having an escort of seven pickets detailed by Colonel Barton, commandant at Fort Pulaski. On the night of the 26th the pickets observed a rebel boat reconnoitring the position used by Mr. Talcott, but without discovering themselves. On the following night the surveying party was driven in by the approach of three hostile boats towards the dyke behind which they were concealed. Mr. Talcott kept his boat in Little Tybee creek, and on receiving the alarm hi.s papers and instruments were at once moved to a place of safety. He camped for the night on the sand-hills, and in th~ morning returned to the Ca.swell, having accomplished the object sought in the separation of a few days from the party on board of the vessel.

The plane-table sheet containing this work was inked and turned in at the office early in April. The party then returned to fort Royal, and there made a supplementary survey, which bas been already alluded to. Sub-Assistant DQmis and Mr. TBWott passed the working season at the north in duty in Section I. Special mention is made in the field report from Section V of the obliging kindness shown towards the party in the Caswell by Captain C.R. P. Rodgers, U. S. N., and by Colonel W. S. Barton, 48th New York volunteers, while the party was on the coast of Georgia. Hydrograpliy ef Story'11 river and Stati<m creek, S. G.-The hydrography of these and of other passages which connect the waters of St. Helena with those of Port Royal sound was taken up on the 1st of :May by a party in charge of Sub-Assistant W. S. Edwards, with the schooner .Arago. The result will afford very desirable facilities for the transport service in a thorough knowledge of that part of the Inland Passage of which the link between Savannah river and Port Royal sound was developed by the same party last year. Mr. Edwards was aided in this service by Mr. A. R. Fauntleroy and Mr. F. H. Dietz.

.Assistaut Ed wards is now preparing to return to the blockading squadron, in order to resurvey the bar of Charleston harbor. Hydrograph.y ef T11bee entrance, Ga.-It was incidentally noticed in the middle of December, 1862, shortly aft.er the return to this section of the party of Assistant Boutelle, that the depth along the sailing lines at the ,entrance of Savannah riv'ilr ha.c.I decreased about two feet within the year, giving only eighteen instead of twenty feet in the channel. This was, at the time, referred to a probable movement of the channel to the southward, 11.s had been remarked at Port Roya.I. On the 2d of March Sub-Assistant Edwards, who had previously been at work in Wallsaw sound, commenced an examination of Tybee roads and of the channel of the Savannah river, including the bulkhead which stretches from it across to Calibogue sound. The main channel of the river above the "wrecks" was also sounded at the request of Colonel Barton, then in command of the United States forces at Savunnah entrance. This work was completed before the close of .April.

Hydrography ef Was.aaw sound, Ga.-With a favorable prospect that opportunity might hold for the completion of the hydrographyinside of Wassaw sound, the party of Sub-Assistant Edwards was despatched with the Arago, and commenced work on the 17th of January. The hydrography was prosecuted until the 1st of March without interruption, though it was g~nerally known that the enemy was preparing for offensive operations afloat. In consequence of this, the soundings were discontinued at the last-named da.te by advice of Admiral DuPont.

The shore-line for the intended chart was taken from the plane-table sheet of Sub-Assistant Dennis. Messrs. Fauntleroy and Diet:i: assisted Mr. Edwards in the hydrograpby. 'l'he incident already mentioned, concerning the captnre of the schooner Pembroke, occurring near where the Arago was at work, a boat with the party of Mr. Ed wards reached the prize a few moments after the one sent from the Caswell. .After assisting to get the prize afloat, the Pembroke was delivered to Captain Scott, of the United States gunboat Marblehead. In the latter part of the working season Sub-Assistant Edwards was engaged with bis party in sounding the passages 'between St. Helena sound and Port Royal bay. Hydrography ef Oa.rabaw aoimd, Ga.-To render of effective use the chart of this sound, derived from the hydrograpby completed just previous to the breaking out of the rebellion, and the engraving of which has since been completed, Assistant Boutelle went there in April last and placed the buoys necessary to enable the naval and transport vessels to cross the bar.

The circumstanees of the war have not interfered with the completion of a work of much importance in this section, the bydrography of the Florida reef's. Some additional work yet remains to be done between Key West and the Tortugas, but the soundings are now continuous from Cape Florida, a1oug the outer side!! of the keys southward and westward, to the Marquesas. The regular work has been added to, also, by the hydrography of the north entrance bar, and approaches of Charlotte harbor, the execution of which was int.ended by my instructions of 1860-'61.

Bailey. At his request the position of the buoys of Key West harbor were examined, and sailing directions made out to suit the changes At the requef'lt of the tax commissioners of Florida, one of the topographers, who had in previous years worked in 11everal parts of the section, was assigned for their service. By forcr, of circumstances only partial opportunity offered for the intended co-operation. Ample testimony as to his qualification for duty has been giveu in a. communication from the chairman of the commission. An extract from the same letter, relative to engineer duty performed at Fernandina, will be found in the notice of field-work in this chapter. 0FFICK-WORx.-The drawing and engraving of general coast chart No. X, Straits of Florida, and of col\st chart No. 71, Newfound Harbor key to Boca Grande key, have been completed. The drawing of sheet No. IV, of a general chart of the Atlantic coast from Mosquito inlet to Key West, including the Bahama Banks and Straits of ]<'lorida, has been completed, and the engraving of the same commenced. .A new edition of the chart of Key West harbor, with improved sailing directions, has been lithographed, and the preliminary chart of the northeastern part of the Gulf of Mexico in two sheets (scale 60-&000 ) has been engraved on stone. Service with tax commissioners in Florid1.-The assignment of Sub-Assistant F.'W. Dorr to duty in connexion with the Florida tax commission was alluded to in my report of last year. He left New York with the commissionerron the 21st of December, and after staying a few days at Port Royal, arrived with them at Fernandina on the 4th of January. Here it was expected that his services as topographer might be called for in aiding the labors of the commi~sion, but an accurate plan of the city being found, it was necessary only to make transfers, and compile a map for the use of tl1e members. Later in .T annary, Mr. Dorr made a reconnaissance of the middle and lower part of Amelia island, at the request of the commander of the post, Colonel Hawley, of the seventh Connecticut volunteers. Early in February Sub-Assistant Dorr accompan~ed one of the commissioners to St. Augustine, in the hope of finding official maps and records of the Florida land office that might further the object of the commission, but on ascertaining dmt all such material had Leen sent to Tallahassee Lefore the occupation of St. Augustine by the forces of the governmeut, the search was discontinued. With the same object Mr. Dorr went to Key West in one of the public vessels, and was on the return passage landed at Hilton Head, from whence he rejoined the commissioners on the 7th of March, at Fernandina. Jacksonville being reoccupied a few days after, Mr. Dorr, by request, accompanied the sixth regiment of Connecticut volunteers to superintend the construction of some earthworks for the defence of the place, additional to those constructed by the tr<>ops under the command of Colonel Higginson. The intended fortification was nearly completed when an emergency arose which called for the services of all the forces then in tl1c vicinity, and Jacksonville was in consequence evacuated. Mr.Dorr again reached Fernandina at the end of March. In the following month he was assigned to duty at St. Augustine, and was several weeks occupied in compiling a map of that city for the use of the commissioners. He reported to them at Fernandina :in the 7th of May, and, as they had previously re1!0lved to defer further operations until autumn, was then relieved from duty. During the summer Mr. Dorr was actively engaged in plane-table duty in Section I, and was in readiness to rejoin the commissioners according to the understanding expressed by them in the order which relieved him from duty in Section VI. In October, however, a pressing call for such duty as he had been accustomed tu i-ender, in eonn(lxion with_military operations, led to his assignment to service ~ith the army of General Grant, near Chattanooga. The chairman of the tax commission for Florida thus concludes a letter which he addressed to me in May lMt, after Mr. Dorr had been relieved for the season : "Mr. Dorr unhesitatingly volunteered to encounter the hazard of arms, without rank or emolument, to plan and superintend the construction of the defences of Jacksonville, prompted solely by a desire to serve his government. I deem it fortunate for the safety of the post that an officer of the Coast Survey was at hand, willing.to undertake a difficult and dangerous trust, and so competent to its execution as Mr. Dorr proved himself to be." \ Hydf:ograpky ef the Florida :reef.r.-For the completion of the hydtography outside of the line of the Florida r~fs, a party was assigned to t\le charge of Acting Assistant Edw'llrd Cordell, and re.ached Key West on the 1&1 of January, in the steamer \"'ken. Of the two gaps that remained to be sounded, that below Key Rodtiguez (see Sketch No. 13) extended about fifteen miles to the southward and westward; the other embraced only about ten square miles off the south shore of Boea Chica ii>land, near Key \Vest. 'l'he steamer lltarted in a few days after her arrival, to commence work in the larger interval, but was met by a southeast gale, which somewhat strained the vessel before the anchorage was reached, off Indian key. This and the

boisterous weather of the following week caused an accident fao the machinery, making it impracticable to liegin the soundings until the 21st. Sub-Assistant C. T. Ia.Jcll:1 was attadH'tl to the party, mul acted as pilot of the Vhi:en. The hydrogrnphy of thi~ part of tlie reef waR cnrnpl.,tt'd l1y the li't of' April. A full development was made of the outer reef betwe<m the previ<Jus work of Captain T. A. Craven and that of last year by AssiBtant Davidson, including also the slwals, and the clmnnels iJJside of them. Lim:R of ~ound ings were c11rried out two miles to seaward from the outer reef, and to a dc11th of forty fathoms, and the a11proaches from the gulf stream were carefully examfru~d. With refore11ce to t11e method pursued in closing the hydrogmphy of this part of the l'!ection, Mr. Corr1P11 remarks : " In prosecuting the work I endeavored to adhere as much as prncticable to the admirable Fy~tern adopted by Captain Craven in the survey of other parts of the re('f. The soundings were extended out rat11er more than six nautical miles from the outer shore of the keys, and the sheets containing them embrace the SW. end of French reef, Pickle reef, Conch and Little Conch, Davis's reef, Crocus reef, and the bank north of Alligator reef." Along this line, the sheet now in the office exhibits a stretch of about fif'tePn miles, of which the main peculiarities are described in the Appendix Ko. 8, in extr11.cts from the report of :Mr. Cordell. In the early part of l\fay, the party in the Vixe11 sounded out the unfinished Fpace at the 8nuth end of Boca Chica, and connected tlrn work of Captain J olm Rodger" with that of Captain Craven. This sheet with the one already mentioned furnishes material for completing the chart of tlie .Florida reef, the engraving of which has been waiti11g the executio11 of the final hydrograpl1y. The rnuudings added by J'i1r. Cordell extend from Boca Chica channel, along the south side of the idand, to GeigPr's signal. A number of coral heads running in a line nearly parallel with the shore, and about half a mile from it, was closely examined, and their positions ostaLlished. The efI;ectivoness of the party in tho steamer Vixen was secured by the aesignmenf of frve aids, ROvtral of whom hafl previous experience in hydrographic work. These were 1"1c~srs. T. C. Nliwio, L. L. NichM'son, L.A. Sen~ller, H. l\I. Dl"Wees, and A . .M. W\Jberill. Besides bc>iug engaged in the work which will be next noticed, all of them have been eince employed in duty on other parts of the Atlantic mast.

The charts of the two localities are now on file, with records in duplicate of the angles taken, and registers of tidal observations. In February Rear-Admiral BM1ey, to whom Mr. Cotdell had reported, directed that the position of the buoys for entering the harbor of Key 1\Test should be examined, it having been suggested by the pilots that one or more of them might be more advantageously placed. This duty was discharged at once, and the results of the examination communicated to the fhtg-officer, with sailing directions. Only one buoy, that on the "west triangle," wa8 moved, and was set about thirty yards from its former position in twenty feet water. The "Western Head," to which attention had been called in the instruc' ions to Mr. Cordell, was examined, and is thus mentioned i11 his report to Admiral Bailey: "About one-third of a mile S.SW. of Mississippi buoy is the 'WeE1tern Head,' with eighteeen feet of water upon it ; and three l1undred yards to the northward and westward of it there is another head of rock, wW1 only sixteen feet. These heads being dangerous to vessels of heavy draught beating through the cha11nel, a third-class can-buoy, painted black, was placed on the one first named. Black buoy No. 3 was placed on the middle ground, in sixteen fePt water." The report of Mr. Cordell was accompanied by a map showing the position of the buoys as now established, and notes giving the bearings from each of them. "Mr. Whalton, the light-house inspector of the district, placed the schooner Florida at our disposal for carrying out Admiral Bailey's instructions, the sjeamer Vixen being at the time disabled. He also furnished the buoys, and assisted in placiug them." In the course of the winter, Assistant George Davidson, who had prosecuted the reef hydrography last year, completed and turned in his chart, with duplicate records of the soundings, angles, and tidal ohscrYations. He has also forwarded a view of Indian key, drawn under his direction by Mr. W. B. l\foYurtrie, which will be engraved for the chart of that part of the reef. 7cs

REPORT OF THE

SUPERL~TENDENT

OF

Hprlrograpliy of Charlotte lwrbor.-The circumstances which have delayed the completion oftbc survey, anrl tlie i:;sue of a chart of this harbor, were explained in my report for 1861, timely provision having been made in all the nE>cessary preliminaries for the work. In April last the approacbes ancl bar, the entrance and the anchorage inside of Charlotte harbor, were sounded liy Mr. Con1ell with tlw working party uf the st<.,lmr'r Vix<on. 'l'he folluwing is an PXtrnct from bis report: "The outer bar, and channel leading into the bay, were thoroughly sounded out, and a full development ·made of the banke on either side. Soundings were carried oY.t six miles from shore into seven fathoms water, aud extended over a space of about nine miles in length abreast of the entrance, including rather more than four miles of tlie shore of La Costa island to the southward, and as much of Gru<parilla jsland to the north ward of the entrance. The hydrography was extended into the Gulf of Mexico nearly three miles outside of the bar." Mr. Corddl found that the bar gave sevPnteen feet of watPr at low tide. 'l'hc capacity of tlrn channel, and directions for entering the hnrbor, are stated in further extracts from his report which will be found in Appendix No. 9. Day and night ob~ervations of the ti.Jes were made for tlrn last twenty days of April, at the inside of the point of Boca Grande. 'l'he currents were observed at four stations in and outsicle of the harbor, one of them being beyond the bar, and another about midway between it and the entrance.

Tl1c manuscript chn.rt is now at the office, with duplicate records of the work in the usual form. Soon after the rc:turn of the Vixen to New York, the party was assigned to hydrograpliic duty in charge of Mr. Cordell in Section I, the details of which have been stated in a previous chapter of this report. Sul1-Assi~tant Tarddla, at the close of the working season at the south, was trnnsft-rred to the party of Assistant F. II. Gerdes for service whicl1 has been referred to under the head of Section I. Tirlal Obscrvation.~.-The series of observations intended to be secured at I<'ernandina was interrupted by the breaking out of' tl1e war, as explained in my annual report for 1861. It was at first thought that the tide gauge (se!f~registering,) wl1ich was left there, had been destroyed, but there is now reason for believing that it was sent to Tullahassee, J<'lorida, when the forces of the government took possession of Fernandina, in :March, 1862.

SECTIONS VII, VIII, IX.
FROM ST. JOSEPH'S BAY, FLA., WEST.WARD TO THE mo GRANDE, lNCLUDING PART OF THE WESTERN COAST OF FLORIDA, AND THE COAST OF ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, LOUISIANA, .A.ND TEXA'l.

Of the six parties sent for duty in the Gulf of Mexico, and on the Mississippi river, three were attached to the army of' Major General Banks, two served with the squadron of Admiral Porter, and one was engaged near St. Louis, Missouri, in completing the survey for the defences of that city. By their labore a large addition has been made in topographical information respecting the ground passed over or occupied by the armies of the Union during the present year. Special surveys have been made of all the posts gained from the enemy, among which are included Vicksburg, Port Hudson, Arkansas Post, the vicinity of Fort Butte a la Rose, on the Atchafalaya, extended reconnaissances through the middle districts of Lmisiana, recon· naissancc of the Red river from·the Mississippi up to Alexandria, and a special topographical survey of the western approaches .to New Orleans. One of the parties ha.,s remained during the entire year, and is now engaged in service with the army division which is operating agaiust the rebel forces in the upper part of Louisiana. The work of all of them will be referred to in more detail in subsequent parts of this chapter. 0FFICE·WORK.-The engraving of a preliminary chart of the Southwest Pass of Mississippi river has been completed, and that of coast chart No. 93, Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain, has been executed as far as the field-work is completed. The drawing of the gulf coast chart from Key West to the Rio Grande has

Progress has been made in the drawing of genera] co11st c1111rt No. XIV, Choctawl111tchee hay to the Missis~ippi delta, and on the engraving of coaPt chart No. 100, Atchafalaya bay and Cote Blanclir.

Topograpltical service in LouiJiana.-No question being left as to the effectiveness of co-operation by the party assigned to this military department last year, I made arrangements in December for the detail of a party of three to accompany the expedition of Major General Danks. Sub-Assistant .T. G. Oltmanns with that view had preceded the expedition, and after examining the astronomical station of the Coast Survey at New Orleans, he reported by letter to Lieutenant Colonel R. B. Irwin, of the staff, directing to Ship island. These details were made in compliance with the special request of the major general commanding the department, whose requisition also for maps and charts, and for unpublished local inf'ornmtion, was met at the same time. . · Mr. Charl<'R""ilosme1· and JI.fr. S. Lyman were directed to aid in topographical or general field duty, and arrived in December and pa~sc<l on to Baton ~ougc, the former to remain for any 8ervice that might be needed in connexion with the operntions ifi Genera1o(jrover. l\lr. Ly~ returned to Xew Orleans in J111rnary, and joined tlie party of Sub-Assistant &ltmmms, who bad taken up duty under the orJers of Capta~ H. L. Abbott, chief topographical engineer. This first service comprised the survey of the right bank of the Missigsippi abreast of New Orleans, beginning at Labrancc's canal and extending to l\IcGee's plantation, below the breastworks on the west si<le of the river. The map tnrned in to Captain Abbott, accompanied by a detailed report of tl1e measurements anJ c11aracter of the various fcatureR of surface, embraces fifteen and a lmlf l'quare miles. It shows within that area every road, footpath, canal, lmyou, etc., leading either from the levee or from the railroad to the Cypress swamps, or in other directions. Mr. Lyman aided in this survey. Several reconnaissances were made in .February, and among otl1ers an examination in conjunction with Lieutenant Loring, of the staff of Brigadier General Emory, of the water-courses which connect the Atchafalaya, the Red river, and the l\Iis~is~ippi. 'l'his was accomplished by means of the United States gunboat Kinsman. Maps and tracings had fortunately been made, as well as a preliminary survey of the Atchafalaya river, before the 25th, in the night of which the Kinsman snagged mid snnk in deep water. By this accident Sub-Assi<itant Oltmanns and l:Ir. Lyman lost all that they had taken with them when thPy set out for duty in the section._ _. In :March Mr. Lyw;.an reported to Major D. C. II1""ston at Baton Rouge, and, under his direction and that of Lieutenant Harwood, made a survey for the defences along the southern boundary of the city, and rendered assi:stance in constructing the fortifications. While these were in progrc~s, Sub-Assistant Oll!iianns engaged in such local surveys and reconnaissances in the neighborhood of lhton Rouge as were called for by the direct orders of General }fanks, and in conjunction with Lieutenant Harwood, of the topogmphical engineers, assisted in all the reconnais~ances between that post and l'ort;Hudson. At the close of l\farch he was reassigned to duty in the fleet, and in connexion with General "\V e~el's command at Berwyck ba:r, and served as engineer and topographer. Mr. Lyman meanwhile ba<l completed the service assigned ~y l\{ajor Houston at Baton Rouge, and in the latter i1art of April returned to New Orleans to await fur:her orders. On being relieved by Major Houston he returned north, and was employed dming the summer in my own party in SectioiJ I. ; Mr. OltmMms joined the staff of Brigadier GeWal Weitzel at Bayou Bcrufi', made several reconnaissances in advance, and built some of the bridges necessary for the march of the division on the road to Brashear city. When the greater part of tlie army had passed Berwyck bay, be wei1t in eompany with Lieutenant Harwoqd, on the gunboat Clifton, to attend the division under command of General Grover, by whom Mr. Oltrr-'tns' personal knowledge of the country back of Bayou Tedie was thought to be of special value. He was present during the short but severe engagement at Irish Bend, and thence proceeded in advance of the army beyond New Iberia, makiug such ~ketches and reconnaissances as were desired. .A naval expedition was here determined upon. to assault Fort Butte la Rose, and to open the Atchafalaya river throughout its ~ourse. Being well acquainted with the locality of the fort and vicinity, Mr. Oltmanns was attached to the #xpedition. The Clifton being disabled in th_r successful attack which followed, he went on board of the Ee#rella at the request of Commander A. P. V"ooke, of that vessel. A few day8 after, the Estrella pushed through the Atchafolaya to Red river, and then communicated with Admiral Farragut. 'l'he

Arizona accompanied, and was followed on the 4th of May by the Albatross. The three vessefa passed on up the Red river without opposition as far as Fort DeRussy, at Gordon's Landing. Two of the gunboats of the enemy were engaged here, the result of which was the evacuation of the rebel forts; but a strong raft across the river resisted the passage of the small vessels tliat had gone in the ac1vance. 'l'he arrival of Admiral D. D. Porter with several iron-clads and rams at once openec1 the riYer as far as Alexandria, Louisiana. l\ir. Oltmanns employed the time on board of the Estrnlla in making a reconnaissance map of Red river from its mouth, for the use of the fleet. A copy of this map, and of that which he had made of the vicinity of Fort Butte :'t la Rose, were sent to the office, and, with other material of special value for the purpose, were used in the compilation of lithographed sketches of this military department. Mr. Oltmanns also furnished a reconnaissance map with soundings through Grand lake and the waters connecting with it on the north, and plarn; of the forts which wern taken from the enemy. After the surrender of Port Hudson to the forces of Major General Banks, "M:r. O\tmannR, who had given his services in the approaches to that city, returned to New Orleans and endeavored to arrange for the triangulation of the l\1is6issippi ri·'er between N cw Orleans and Fort Jackson. This being found impracticable at the time, be retll;l'.ned and made a complete topographical survey of the vicinity of Port Hudson, showing as well the defensive works as the approaches to them. 'l'he original sheet of t11is work was delivered ta the military authorities at Port Hudson. Returning to N cw Orleans on the 4th of September, ltfr. Oltn1l\ijns was at once as~igned to duty with t.he army division intended to operate above Sabine l'ass, and at that place he witnessed the destruction of the small steamer Sachem, which had been formerly in Coast Survey service, and during part of tlie previous season midor his charge in tho reconnaissance of Pearl river. Ten days after the return from Sabine Pass he reported to .l\Iajor-General Franklin, and started with the land forces for the western part of Louisiana. Sub-Assistant Cha:rles II!Jime1· was detached from duty with t11e left grand division of the army of the Potomac on the 27th of November, 1862, and proceeding under orders, reported to the chief of General Banks's staff, iu New York, on the 1st of December, for duty in the department of the gulf. He was intimately acquainted with a large part of the coast of Texas, and his assignment was made with reference to the possibility of its rooccupation by the government forces. l\Ir. Hosmer reached New Orleans on the 14th, and a few days after reported to General Gt'QVer at Baton Rouge. There a plan.~-tabln survey was made of tl1e ground im·itle of the picket lines, iucludi11g tl1e town and the defensive earthworks. Mr. I,yman ailled in this duty, and after its completion was trausfep-ed to the party of Sub-Assistant Oltmanns, as already stated, In the latter part of January .l\lr. Ho~r rep<Jrted to Captain Abbott. at New Orleans, and as1:1isted in making reconnaissance maps of the vicinity of that city in the direction towards-Lake Pontchartrain. Under the orders of Major Houston he also determined points with the plane-table around Fort Jackson anrl Fort St. Philip, in February, for the range in artillery practice. 'l'he following month was passed at Pensacola, in the ex11ectfLtion that arrangements there set on foot would have issued in the sending of a force to the coast of Texas, which Mr. Hosmer had made preparations to accompany. 'l'he design not being carried out, he returned to New Orle:o.ne on the 25th of .l\larch, and early in April again reported to General Grover at Bayou Breuff, and accompanied his staff through the 'Teche campaign. On the route, there being no occasion for the use of the plane-table, Mr. Hosmer assisted in directing the building of bridges, anll in such other service as wonlcl facilitate tlie advance of the army. During the movement up the Teche, and at the battle of Irish Bend, he a~d.d in delivering the orders of the general. .From thence on he continued with the division of General Gnqer to Thompson's plantation, seventeen miles below Alexandria, and with the staff visited that town on the 9th of May. No call arising in this part of the campaign for special surveys, he returned with the forces to Semmesport, and on the following day ptoceeded to New Orleans. A few days after he took passage for New York, and arrived there on the 2<).' of June. }fr. Hosmer has since been employed in ~ction I, but is now on his way to rejoin the army of General Banks. Services connected with tl;e 1ia1,al and military operation11 against Vicksburg, Miss.-The field which opened last _winter for the employ of to~ographers specially. qualifie~ l/y practice in army and navy movements, mduced me to place at the disposal of Rear-Admiral Dav1cr'o. Porter the serviceR of a party under the direction of Assistant F. II. Gerdes, who had acted under the orders of the admiral in similar duty in the reduction of Forts Jac¥-son and St. Philip in the 11pring of 1862. ,,uh-Assistant Clarcnc~endall and J'4.r. Alexand\J Strausz reported f>r duty at Cairo, Illinois, on the 27~ of Novemb~r. Sub-Assistant R. E~alter arrived on the 5th of D~mber, but being taken seriously ill before the cltse of tha~, month, was detached from the party in Yazoo river. Mr. Feudal.I had been

aRsigned to quarters on the flag-Bhip (Blaek Hawk,) and waR fully employed in compiling mapg of the Yazoo region, and in supplying duplicates so as to meet the needs of lioth the larnl and 1mval frirees. On the 9th of December Mr. Strausz was sent from Cairo, with tbe gunboat 'l'~t>r, to ~ketch as mueh as possible of the topograpl1y of the banks of the Yazoo. 'l'he gunboat went up tlrnt river on the 23d. Five miles from the mouth she encountered a heavy fire of musketry from both sl1orcs, but kept on up during the day, and anchored for the night. Next day the survey of the banks was resumed and cornpfoted for the purpose then held in view by General Sherman and Admiral Porter, though the enemy, as before, continued to annoy the vessel. On Christmas day, while l\Ir. StrauEz was sketching from the cabin on deck, a bullet from the enemy on shore struck the timber but a few inches from his head. 'l'he map which he brought back to the admiral, and which was immediately duplicated for use, proved to be a preliminary means for the attack made by the land forces nn the defences northeast of Vicksburg in the latter part of December. In a communication addrcseed to me early in January Admiral Porter thus alludes to the nature of the service in the Yazoo: "During the ascent of the Yazoo river, and while engaged in taking up torpedoes, our pas.sage was contested at every step by two or three thousand riflemen in pits, and behind levePs, so protected that our guns could not hurt them. The vessel~ were much cut up, the rifle-balls going through and through the light upper works. ;\fr. Strausz ac-companie<l the expedition, !lnd while under the enemy's fire produced a good chart of the river and liack country, with which we have made our advanct~s." 'l'hc following extract shows not less clearly the estimation of that energetic aml practical commander as to the bearing of special practice in topography in the attack of places very difficult of approacb: "}fr. Strausz and l\Ir. Fendall have rendered themselves extremely useful to rue in compiling maps for the use of the army and navy aud making surveys of the field of operations before Vicksburg. I sent Mr. Strausz down in a vcstlel near the front of the city to make plans and t1lke sketches of the batteries, which he did to my satisfaction, giving us information that we have not possessed before, and showing the impracticabilit,y of attacking Vicksburg by water alone. "Both of them arc very aAsiduous in making mups for future use. 'l'hey are now engaged on one of the A1·kansas, where we intend striking a blow before returning to Vicksburg, the water being still too low to operate there with any hope of success." The important capture of Fort Hindma,n and Arkansas Post, here forcshado\l·ed, took place a few days after the date of the letter from which these extracts have been taken. Just previous to the attack Mr. Strausz, by order of the admiral, accompanied a file of marines to ascertain the precise location of the rifle-pits in front of the rebel workA, and, in conjunction with Mr. Fendall, surveyed and furnished a map of the vicinity of the post aftc1· its capture. Of the sketches which up to this time had been traced to show the approaches of Vicksburg, calls for more than thirty copies made on .Mr. Fendall alone had been promptly met. Others were supplied by ]\fr. Strausz. The topography of the approaches to that stronghold was pushed steadily after the 20th of January, and at one point to within six hundred yards of the batteries, or about three miles beyond the pickets of our own forces. A guard accompanied the topographers, and on one occasion made priBoner of a rebel officer who had taken means to capture l\Ir. }--.endall and his plane-table. The work clone by him in February comprised the survey of the peninsula opposite to Vicksburg, and the town front of the Mississippi, with the positions of the several defensive works. From tracings sent to the office a lithographic sketch of the vicinity was issued soon after. The use of a boat not being always allowed by the exigencies of the naval service, the survey of the western arproaches of the city was conducted under many difficulties and privations. The tug sent down near the middle of :February, and which l\Ir. Fendall accompanied to establish the ranges, if places were selected for the use of mortars, narrowly escaped the heavy shot. It wat1 found that. mortars could not be brought within four thousand yards of the enemy's works without more than ordinary exposure to damage from tbe hostile fire. At this perfod of the naval and military operations in the vicinity of Vicksburg Admiral Porter judged it expedient to have the services of a photographer for taking views of places that might be reached, but that could not be permanently hdrl in the further reconnaissances that might "be necessary. Acting Voluntr~er Lieut.enant Julius Kroehl was sent to him by the Navy Department after taking practice in the photograph division of the Coast Survey office. Mr. Kroehl had been on duty in the South Atlantic blockading squadron, and by steadiness in service was well fitted for usefulness in the fleet near Vicksburg. He reported early in March, and, until opportunity offered for special duty, assisted Messrs. Strausz and Pendall. He, in conjunction with Mr. Strausz, accompanied the expedition through Sted's bayou and Deer creek, the object of which was to pass the gunboats, if practicable, into the Yazoo at a point some miles above the rebel works on Haines's Bluff. Mr. Strausz returned with a map of the entire route followed by the expedition. It is well known that the expedition was stopped within a few miles of the water-course which leads into the main river, only by insuperable natural difficulties. Immediately after its return the attention of the military and

navnl authorities was given to the approach of Vicksburg from the sout11ward, the preliminary to which was the pa~sing of the Vicksburg batteries by the fleet of Admiral Porter on the night of the 16th of April. A movement nearly simultaneous was made with tl1e lancl forces under command of Major General Grant. It is not here in place to trace the RPries of actionR which marked the Rnmmcr campaign in the western circuit of the State of Mis;;issippi, and wkich terminated in theisurrender of Vickslmrg on the 4th of Jnly. Messrs. ]'endall and Strausz continued work until the latt~art of the month, when both were unfitted for duty by illness, and were relieved by Admiral Porter from present service, with letters commendatory of their constant and effective labors. In the vicinity of Vicksburg alone the details were surveyed and mapped to cover an area of twenty square miles. Amongst these are shown in position an agg1·egate of eighteen miles of riflepits and ordinary breastworks and twenty-five miles of road. Twenty-eight miles of river shore-line are shown on the same sheet. The aggregate statistics of surveys made by the party at Arkansas Post, \Y alnut Layou, and along the Yazoo river, including the district about llaines's Bluff, embrace an area of six and a quarter square miles, within which were traced and mapped nearly eight miles of rifle-pits and batteries, about eighteen miles of road, an<l twenty-six and a half miles of river shore-line. 'l'he report of Sub-Assistant Fendall closes with the following remarks : "'l'he country surveyed is principally alluvial bottom land of about the average height of the Missif'sippi at its full stage. Tlie 1mrt under cultivation is kept from the river by dikes or levees, the rest covered by a thick growth of willows or cotton wood. The irregular hills about Vicksburg and llaincs's Bluff are, generally, barren of trees, and are not cultivated. 'l'hey comprise the only high land to be met with below Helena. The country waA favorable for plane-table Rurveying, tlrn only obstacleR being the current, which it waR sometimes imposRib1e to breast with a row-boat, and the pickets and scouts of the enemy, who fired on the party at every opportunity." Topography ef the military difen1:es of St. Louis, Mo.-The survey of the environs of the city of St. Louis has been completed by l#ic addition of' the topography of Carondelet. This work was steadily prosecuted by Assistant R. J\L Nche, and was closed in .Jtme. }"'or the supplementary plane-table survey be measured a suitable base, which passes through the town, and connected with it a triangulation which determined all the points to be included in the new sheet. In conjunction with the surveys of last year the sheet turned in completes the topography of all the approaches to the city of St. Louis, the defeneeR, rmuls, creeks, contour of ground, etc., and furnishes all the data that could be called for in engineering purposes.

The plane-table sheet shows the environs of Carorn.ldct eastward to the bank of the Mississippi and westward to include the river Dt's Peres, in the vicinity of the town. Assistant Bache was aided in this duty by Mr. Robert E.~cMath. The subsequent labors of both have Leen mentioned under the bead of Section JL Tidal observaticms.-It was stated in my annual rf·port for 18Gl that the series of observations with a sdf-registering tide-gauge at Last island, (coast of Louisiana,) had been continued until the month of April of that year by Mr. H.P. Wilson, and that he had been instructed to discontinue the record and box up the instruments, there being no mail communication certain between his station and the office after that time. His compliance with the directions, and success in securing thf, instruments, were made known in March last in a communication addressed to me by Captain E. H. McLafliu, 21st Indiana volunteers, then acting as provost marshal of Brashear city, to whom }Ir. Wilson had turned over the articles in good order. In the same letter assurance was given that tbe property would be safely kept until orders were received from the office· Request was promptly made that the instruments should be forwarded to Washington, if practicable; but as they have not yet arrived at the north, it is presumed that the commendable intention of the provost mar.ihal is for the time being suspended by the exigencies of the transport service in the department of Major General Banks; or el!!e that the instrument has been destroyed, with other property of the government, during the recent occupancy of the post by rebel forces.

SECTION X.
FROM SAN DIEGO, ON TUE PACIFIC, NORTHWARD TO THE FORTY-SECOND I'ARA.LLEL, INCLUDING THE COAt;'l' OF CALIFOHNIA.-(SKETCH No 24.)

The peculiar circumstances of the currency threatened in the early part of the year to interfere with the progress of tlie work in thi8 section, but fortunately the difficultic:; in regard to it have been in part averted. Taking into account with them the lessened appropriation for the work of the survey on the western coast, its continuance during the surveying year, and the progress made, have been subjects of gratification. The following is a summai·y of the operations which will be referred to further on under their respective heads: L Triangulation of the coast of California, ea;;t and we~t of Santa Barbara, and its connexion with stations on Santa Cruz and Anacapa islands, acro8~ tlu~ Santa Barlmra chaunel. 2. The topography and hydrography of Half Moon bay, nearly completing the previou8ly unsurveyed interval of the coast between Monterey Lny and San Prancisco entrance. 3. Hydrographic resurveys of Karquines strait, and of the bar in San Pablo bay, for determining questions in regard to the permanence of the channc.:ls. The party engaged in this duty also performed service for the light-house inepector, by determining the position of the buoys of San Francisco bay. 4. A thorough hydrographic development in regard to position, depth, and approaches of the Fanny Rock, near the Farallonee. 5. Tidal observations continued at tlic permanent stations San Diego, and near San Francisco. 0FFICE-WORK.-The drawing and engraving of charts of the upper part of San Francisco bay; of the Pacific coast from Point Pinos to Bodega head; and of Bodega bay, in preliminary form, have been completed. 'J.'he engraving of San Pablo bay as a finished chart has been completed. Progress has been made in drawing and engraving the charts of 'l'omales bay aud Drake's bay. Additions have been made to plates of charts previously engraved, and to the progress sketches of the section, and a hydrographic. sketch of the Fanny llhoal has been published. Triangulation.-East and west of Santa Barbara the coast triangulation of California. bm; been extended about twenty-two miles during the past Rflasnn by the party of A~si:<tant W. E. Greenwell. Santa Crnz island, lying on the outer side of the Santa Barbara channel, as will be seen by reference to the progre~s llketch, (No. 24,) has been connected with the main triangulation of the coast, and with the chain of triangles going westward from Santa Barbara. 'l'he party resumed work on this part of the coast with the schooner Humboldt on the 18th of November, 1862, and at the date last received, August 27, was still in the field.

During part of the winter, when Assistant Gl!Cenwell was absent, Sub-Assistant Julius Kinclieloe, of his party, continued its operations. The eight-inch Gambey theodolite, No. 44, was used in measuring the angles. Topograpli.y and hydrography ef Ha1f 11-.foon bay, Cal.-The plane-table survey of the gap in the topography of the coast below San Francisco entrance will probably be completed before the close of the present surveying year, Assistant Rodgers having transferred his party in the schooner Marcy to that locality. During July and August his party co-operated with the party of Sub-Assi~tant W. M. Johnson in tbe planetablc survey, so as to provide shorn-line for the hydrographic sheet. As8istant Rodgers gave attention also to the determination of triangulation points for connecting the three plane-table sheets projected for the survey with the triangulation which passes from San Francisco bay to Monterey bay. Hydrograpky.-The charge of the hydrographic work of this section devolved, by my instructions, on .Assistant A. F. Rodgers on the 10th of October, 1862. Commander B. F. Sands, U. S. N., who had previously eonducted the hydrographic operations, had been relieved at Lis own request, and was then about returning to the Atlantic coast t<J> resume naval duties. Mr. Rodgers as soon as possible completed the outstanding office-work of his topographical party, and forwarded to the office the plane-table sheets of '.l'omalcs bay, Point Reyes, and Bodega bay. He then

selected points in San Fraucieco bay and made observations on the currents, employing in that service the schoonPr ;\Iarcy anrl the l1ydrograpl1ic party. The "'iig1'it-house inspector of the twelfth district, Commander Watson, not having at immediate command the means of making an inspection of the buoys of San Francisco bay in November last, requested tliat this service might be done by tl1c party in the cutter l\Iarcy. Assistant Ilo<lgcrs, having himsl"lf previously furnished the bearings by which the buoys were pl1tccd, examined those set upon Rincon Rock, Blossom Rock, and Anita Rock, and those upon Southampton shoal, and 'Vhiting nm1 Invincible rocks, and found them as near the dangers intended to be marked as the nature of the ground upon which they were anchored would admit. He examined also the buoy on the shoal at the entrance of l\Iare Island strait, the growth of which was ilcvelope1l l1y Commander Sands in the last season of his service on tlle Coast Survey. '!'his was found in the proper position. For the spar buoy on Commission Rock, in 1Uare faland strait, Mr. Rodgers recommends the substitution of a spindle, the rock being bare at extreme low water, and lying directly in the channel-way to the navy yard. For the rock knovl'11 as "Little Alcatraz," off the northwest enil of Alcatraz island, and awash at low tide, it was recommended that a buoy should be provided, or a spindle set to mark it permanently. This is believed to be tbc only rock in San Francisco bay not distinguished by a mark. 'l'he position of the wreck of the ship ":Flying Dragon," which sunk early in the year 1862 in the track of vessehi passing between Shag Rock and Bird Rock, was determined by l\1r. Rodgers in February, and published a~ a notice to mariners. 'l'he bearings for the imsition of the wrPck are given in a copy of the notice contained in the Appendix, (No. 11.) This wreck has been lying in the channel-way for nearly a year, and, its true position being unknown, has been a cause of apprehension to pilots and others in navigating the bay. During Man:h and April the party in the Marcy was occnpied iu running test-line~ of the soundings previously found in Karquines strait, and on the "bar" off Point Wihon, in San Pablo bay. It was a gratifying result that the examination of the bar this year by Assistant Rodgers, though made at an interval of Elix years subsequent Lo the survey of Commander Alden, (in 1857,) developed no change in depth, there being still twenty-two and a half feet at mean low water. The mean rise of the tide is six feet. Only a small increase in the length of tlie bar was fonnd in comparing the two surveys. These results are fully confirmed by the internwdiate survPy of Commander SandA, in 1862, made soon after the occunence of the heaviest floods ever known in California. The conclu8ion drawn from comparison of the several sheets of soundings in this locality was communicated to the honora1le Secretary of the Navy in June, as favoring confidence in the stability of the channel through San Pablo bay to the navy yard at Mare island. The survey of Karquines stra.it liy Mr. Rodgers, compared witl1 that of 1857, shows that quite material changes have occurred, none, however, affecting navigation, as reported on by the hydrographic inspector of the office, exceptiug the change in position of tl1e middle gmuud. In reference to this, Captain Patterson eays: "The eighteen feet, (seventeen in 1857,) middle ground was S.SE. from the steamboat wha1'f in 1857, but in 1863 is due south from the same wharf. It has separated into three lumps, and moved during the interval between the surveys two hundred and eighty metres to the southward and westward." The engraved chart of Karquines strait will be ref'ised in accordance with the reRults given by the ~urvey of this year. While A>l8if'tant Rodgers was engaged in the vicinity, some additional soundings, requested by Commandant Selfridge, were made on the San Publo side of Mare island, and furnished for use in the projected clefonces of the navy yard, which were deemed to be necessary at the opening of the present surnmr1-. Mr. Rodgers held his vessel and party at the disposal of the naval authorities for any emergency, and rcpmted cha11ges of position as the work went on, so as to be at command, if occasion should arise for Lis co-operation. Fanny Rock, near the Nortlt Farallon.-To the short list of dangers to be guarded against in approaching San Francisco entrance, is uow to oe added the Fann,y Rock, reported by the pilot-boat of that name. It lies outside of the limit required by the regular coast hydrography, and several miles to the northward and westward of the North Farallon. Being, as shown by Assistant Rodgers, after full examination within the present season, very small in extent, not more than ten feet long, and a foot wide across the top, and having on the ridge about twenty-two feet of water at low tide, with steep, smooth sides, it might readily be missed by th1> lead in the c1osc8t ~ystem of examination that could have b1~en undertaken without some knowledge of its approximate place. The reputed position, moreover, has lieen found to be several miles wide of the true, the determination with only ordinary means by any single vessel not being at a11 practicable. From these circumstances, or from the fact that it could be dangerous only to vessels of deep draught, the

report in regard to itf' existence had been for several years discredited by many at San FrnnciRco whose interests would otherwise have prompted a call for its precise determination and developm.,,nt. The itnmediate occasion was an unfortunate event that occurred on the 2d of January. 'l'he ship X oonday, drawing at least twenty-one feet, struck at 1 o'clock p. m. of that day, and within two hours sunk in forty fathoms. Iler po8ition at the time of the disaster was thought to be eight miler; from the North Farnllon. Assistant Rodgers, having taken immediate steps for enabling him to fix the position of the rock or ledge, spent two days in the middle of January in running ranges, but without finding the object of sca1·cl1, his party being driven in by thick and stormy weatlrnr. He had, in addition to hii' own vessel, (the cutter Marcy,) chartered the schooner Naiad, of San Francisco, and towai·ds the end of the month reeumed the examination with morn success. The result wa" the devdopmPnt of a rock of the dinwnsions already given, in a direction northwest, and rather more than three miles from the Xorth Faro1lon. Uespect.ing it lw says: "The rock, in apparent size and shape, may be described by compming it to a smnll boat bottom up. Its sides seem to be very Fmooth, and the lead could.only be kept on it by liolding the line taut, fm if allowed to run, it would slip off into deep water of twenty fathoms or more in a boat's length." TheRe particulars, and others giving the bearings of the rock from known points, (Appendix No. 10,) were fully verified by Mr. Rodgers in an examination of the locality in June. In his report acknowledgment is marJe of the earnest co-operation of Mr. W. G. Bloomfield, of the schooner Naiad, and of the efficient service renderc"d by Acting }laster A. S. Hussey and Acting :Masters Mates J. T. Pitman and A. F. Askin, of tl1e cutter :\larcy. Though the rock found differs in the distance a~signed from the Faralloncs, the co1-respondPnce of the bearings, and the general search made of the locality by Assistant Rodgers, thus far satisfy the shipping interest at San Francisco that it occasioned the los:> of the Noonday, and that no other d;wgcr of like charaeter exists in its immediate vicinity. It is, however, but common prudence to admit the possibility that this present conclusion may hereafter be set aside, the sharpness of the point found, and t11e deep water arouml it not being peculiar even to this paTt of the coast of California. Mr. Alexander Chase, the aid in the hydrographic party, while engaged about the Fanny Rock, made sketcl1es of the appearance of Point Reyes and 1\Iount St. Helens, and also of the grouping of the North and South Faxallones. These have been approved by Assistant Rodgers as true and characteristic, and will be engraved for the entrance chart of San Frauci~co 11arbor. The existence of red coral within six miles of the Fara1lones was discovered by one of the San Francisco pilots in January. Assistant J. S. Law.~on was then in port, and having his attention drirn·n to the fact, took to Professor Whitney a specimen which had been brought up from a depth of twenty-eight fathoms. Similar coral is said to have been found at the bottom of 1\Ionter<'y bay. Further examination will he incidentally made with reference to the nautical interest attaching to this discovery. The report of Assistant Rodgers relative to his examination of the Fanny Rock, and given in the Appendix, (No. 10,) bears upon the question. On the 8th of April .Assistant George DJ.vidson made a full and detailed report of the prospects of telegraph work across the continent for the determination of longitude between the Atlantic and Pacific stations of the Coast Survey. Full details were furnished of the rouw and distance travfwsed, the mpporting p:llcs, methods of crossing streams, forests passed through, size and kind of wire, different kind of pole in~ulators used, insulation, batteries, repeaters, supply of materials, and repairs. The present condition for tmnsmitting through messages is stated, with the best time and season for longitude operations, and the prospect of connecting the different portions of the Pacific coast. l<'rom Mr. Davidson's acquaintance with the shores and waters of the struit of Juan de Fuca, Admiralty inlet, Puget's sound, &c., he has been able to fi:trnfoh, with the con8ent of the Treasury Department, much valuable information in relation to projected telegraph routes in that region. Tidal ohservations.-Under the supervision of Captain G. H. Elliot, of the eorps of engineers, U.S. A., the tidal stations at San Diego and San l<,rancisco have been kept up with success during the prl$ent year, and no delay has occurred in the receipt of the records at the office in Wauhington. The self-registering gauge at the first-named station has been, as heretofore, in charge of Mr. A. Oassidy, and that at San l~ran cisco in charge of Mr. H. E. Uhrlandt. The usual meteorological observations were also recorded by tl1ese ohservers, and have been regularly forwarded with tlw tidal records. 'The third permanent tidal station of tlie western coast will be referred to under the head of Section XL s cs

The fidd-wmk in this section, by the only party working there, has been confined to the extension of of Koos bay, Oregon. OFFICE-WPRK.-The drawing and engrnving of a preliminary chart of the bar of Koos bay has been completed and publishecl, as al~o a preliminary chart of the entrance to Gray's harbor, 1Vashington TenitorySupplementary tria11gulat;on qf Koo .. bay, Orcgon.-The survey of Koos bay was resumed on the 25th of J unc, by the party of Assistant J. S. Lawson, with the brig Fauntleroy. The material procured in addition to that of laRt. year, which was presented in the form of a preliminary chart of the entrance, will probably suffice for the completion of the plane-table eurvcy and the hydrograpl1y. :Mr. 0. B. Boutelle joined the party of Assistant Lawson as aid in April. Tl1e vessel returned to San :Francisco on the 28th of October. Entering Koos bay in .June, 2\:lr. Lawson found at the first quarter of flood tide lG feet of water. He reports that during the pricceding winter "the channel had undergone one of its deepening changc8. It still remains so that at high water twenty-two feet can be found. The ranges for .entering remain very nearly the same." In extending the triangulation, thirty-two of the signals previously used were examined and adjusted, and ten adc1itional signals were erected. Over twenty points were determinecl in position, and marked for hydrogrnpliic pmposes- Seventeen stations were occupied at which was used the 10-inch Gambey theodolite No. 20. Mr. Lawson reports the statistics as follows:

CO.A.ST SURVEY OJ:o'FICE.

The office in Washington has 1·cmained under the charge of Assistant J.E. Hilgard. Profe£sor F. A. P. Barnard has discharged the duties of general assistant since June. The report of the assistant in charge (Appendix No. 14) contains the names of the pernons employed, and, in summary form, the work done in each division. Referring for the particulars to that appendix, I will here briefly review the report of Assistant Hilgard, to show the organization of the office. The several divisions remain as in previous years. 'l'he lithographing division was added two years ago, to meet the increased demand for charts. I£y<lrograp!tic divis;on--'l'he duties in this division, which has remained in charge of Captain C- P. Patterson, include the verification of original charts, and the preparation of notes, sailing directions, &c., for the engraved charts. Under his direction, also, the vessels used in the survey have been refitted, and turned over to the parties to which they were assignecl for the work of the season. Of the two draughtsmen attached to the division, 11-fr. Artku.r Balbach has been employed in verifying original sheets, and the reductions from them previous to engraving, and in examining engraved proofs before publication, in preparing comparative m:ipi< and miscellaneous work. Mr_ L. Karcl;er made the projections used by the hydrographic parties this year; plotterl hydrographic sheets from the original notes, and made some reductions and hydrographic sketches. He also assisted in verifying the original and engraved work. Tidal division.-The number of persons attached to the tidal division of the office has gradually diminished as the work on hand has been disposed of, leaving the force sufficient to attend to the current work as it comes in from the stfltions yet in operation. Under the direction, as heretofore, of Assiatant L. ]". Powrtales the force now in the division has been thus employed : lifr. R- s_ Avery has discussed the

aiurnal tiacs of the western coast, and has completed various series of reductions; ]}Ir . .7. Downes reduced the observations from self-regi;.;tcring gauges until the bt of ,June, wh<>n he was i·lacec1 in charge of the archives of the imrvey. Since that date tlie self-registering observationi' have b<·cn n·<luccd by J.tlr. P. II. IJonegan, who has also made other tidal reductions. ]II. Tltomas and S. D. Pendleton haYe made ordinary reductions and transcripts-the latter until the 1st of .August, and F. R. Pendleton siuce the 15th of Sc;ptember. Computing dii·ision.-This division has rem:iiued under the effecient direction of Ass;stant C. A. Schott. During winter and spring, at the opening of the prei'ent year. J\Ir. Schott was engaged in fielcl-work in the vicinity of Washington, and later in the season in Section I, mention of which has been made in the corresponding chapten; of this report. Ile abo made oLservations ont of the office, Cl·nnected with the study of the distribution of magnetism in iron vesselR. A statement of the current wo1·k of the computers is given in the report of the assistant in charge, .Appendix No. 14. Assistant T. TV. l'Verner has computed triangulations; Jtlr. E. J.Yulty, the ohRen·ations of time, azimuth, latitude ancl longitude. ]}Ir. J. ]}Jain revised astronomical observations, and made geodetic and astronomical computations, and others from recorc1,; of magnetic observations. lYir. G. Rumr.f has attended to the insertion of geodetic results in the register of geographical poBitions; revised geodetic calculations, and has also computed triangulations. JJ,Ir. E. H. Courtenay has performed tbe clerica.l duties of the ili\·ision, and aided :J\Ir. Sdwtt in field service. 'The transcripts of the recorcls have been nrnrlP, as u"ual, by R. Fueman. Drawing didsion.-At the date of my last annual report Assistant A. III. IIarrison was temporarily iu charge of the drawing division, and BO remained until l\Iay, when he took field service again in Section I, aB stated in a previous chapter of my report. Since that time the work of this brnnch of the office has been directed by .Assistant Edgard, in acldition to the general overnight of the other office diviBions. In this supervioion of details he wns aided by Jlir. TV. T. Bright. The di.-triLution of work amongst the draughtsmen has been as follows : Assistant JJI. J. Mr:Clery ha~ added details from plane-table sheets to the photographs intended for the cugraver, and has drawn the hill topography for the first cfass maps. llir. E. riergesllimrr has generalized the sheets intended to be photographed, and lettered the maps ancl chartfl that have been engraved during the year. In the summer he engaged in field-work in the survey for defences near Philadelphia. JJ1r. A. Lindenkold has made topographical and hydrogrnphic rcductiom; projections on copper; maps for military purposes, an cl also made additions to the sketches of progress. He was employed in fi<Jld-work during part of last winter, and is now engaged in similar duty. .llir. L. D. JJ7illiams was employed on reductions of various kinds, in verification work, and in making projections for 11lane-table sheets until October, when he left the office. IYir. H. Lindenl.:ohl has made reduct.ions for engravPd charts antl sketches, and has engraved some of them on stone. ]}fr. F. Faii:fnx has been employed on reductions generally; ]}fr. F. Engel upon copper-plate projections, others for field parties, aml in drawing diagrams. JJir. TV. B. ~IcMurtrie and ltlr. E. JVillcnbuch.er, during part of the season, wme employed in making tracings. The first has been on service since June, at Philadelphia, in connexion vdth the surn·ys for defences. Both have been also engaged in plotting hydrograpbic WOl'k. JJfessrs. T. Petingale, T. R. Smith, B. ~Ho"e, TV. Faiifax and .T. II. Logan have been employed on tracings, in compiling statistics, and in other miscellaneou8 duties. JI.Ir. J. TV. 1J.Iaedel has made traci11gs from the original sheets for use in the photogrnph division. Mr. Petingale resigned on the Hth of March, and Mr. Smith on the 22d of May. Engraving division.-The details of work done in this divi,;ion liave been co11tinncd in charge of Alr. Edu·ard TVh.arton, who has been assisted in the clerical duties by JJir. G .·T. Pinckard. The system of engraving figures by means of punches, in place of cutting them with the graver, haB been further perfected during the year,'and has been fully adopted for second class charts, with a great reduction of expense of the maps accompanying this· report. 'l'hc series of "sailing charts," (Nos. 18 to 23,) and other;<, have had the soundings engraved in this wa.y. .Another advance in lessening the expense of engraving, hy the application of mechanical means, has been made in the use of a pantograph of supc1·ior construction, adapted to engraving outlines upon copper, on a red11ced scale, by direct copying from the drawing. .A reduction in the number of engravers was made at the end of the last surveying year. Of the number retained, Mr. G. lricCoy until ,June, and JJicssrs. A. Ro1lti, and J. E1it!tqffer dming the year, liave been cugnged in engraving topography from photographic reductions; JJ[cssrs. Jolin [(night and E. A. ]jia,,dcl in lettering and engraving figures on first class charts; Jllessrs. A. Sn1gtdler, TV. Pl1ilbjM. G. B. 11ff'f::croth., and Ii. C. Evans in engraving topography and sanding; llir. A. 11-Iaedd in topography; lllr. II. S. Baruard in sanding; Mr. J. C. Kondrup in engraving outlines; Mr. A. Petersen in lettering and engr:n·ing :figures; '/J.fessrs. R.

Thompson on letters and to11ogrnphy; am1 ]}Jr. A. Buckle in punching figureH to reprei;f'nt sounding~ on engravecl plates. Photograph and electrotyping division.-The details of the work done in this and the other divisions of the office are stated in .Appendix No 14. The division has remained in charge of 111r. George Mathiot. ltlr. Da nid Hinkle was attached to the division until April 1, when he resigned and was replaced by Mr. A. Zumbrocl.:. 'l'he photographic process is now the principal means used in the office in preparing reductions for the engravn. Tlw facility it affonhi, too, in duplicating has made it an important auxiliary in cases wherein the press of time for sketches, military maps, &c., would not admit of making even the lithographic transfer. The use of Harrison & Schnitzer~" globe lens," of the performance of which an account is given in .Appendix No. 24, lrnB materially aided the succesB of tl1e photographic operations. Litlwgrapliing division.-This division, which was organized two years ago as a measure of necessity to meet the largely increased demands for charts, was, during the first part of the year, under the charge of IYlr. lV. L. Xiclwlaun. Since his resignation (May ] ) the details have been directed by Prefessor F . .A. P. Bar71ard. The number of hydrographic charts printed from stone during the year has been nearly twelve thousand. Of maps and sketches, exhibiting the fields of operation of the national forces, or illustrating particn1ar localities connected with the .Progress of the war, there have been printed an aggregate number of about eighte!'n tltoumnd. Many of these have been found very serviceable by our military commanders in the field Some of the sketches have been improved by data contributed to us by the commanders through their engineer officers. The distribution of the memoirs of the coast now under blockade has been continued to military and naval commanders. JUiscellaw'nus dinision.-'l'his division was al8o in charge of Mr. Jt.~iclwlson until May, when he was succeeded by Prifess01· Barnard. The distribution of maps and charts of all descriptions during the year has been nearly forty-seven thousand, of which about thirty tl1ousand copies were nautkal charts. The map-room has been under the charge of Mr. 11l. T. Johnstone. Of the annual report of the Superintendent for 1861, thirty-six hundred copies have been distributed, and of the reports of prnvious years, at home and abroad, since the date of my last annual report, more than six thousand copies. lJ!lr. J. J. Hendricks until his resignation (July 26,) Mr. L. A. Sengteller until September, and 1Ur. H. C. Saxl01t since that period, have served a8 clerks in the division. lllr. John Rutherdale, aided by Mr. I. Fries, has carried on the copper-plate printing. Mr. W. Mertz, until October, and subsequently JI.fr. G. lV. Francis, have prepared the paper used for topographical and hydrographic sheets, and attended to the other duties of the folding·room. ltlr. T. J. Hunt, principal instrument maker, and JYlr. A. Yeatman, master carpenter, have discharged their various duties satisfactorily and promptly. I have, as heretofore, to acknowledge the useful and acceptable services of Captain C. P. Patterson, hydrographic inspector, whose zeal continues without abatement. The discharge of the duties of general disbursing agent of the survey by Samuel Hein, esq_., has, as heretofore, given great satisfaction. 'l'be clerks in my office, W W Cooper, esq., and J. T. Hoover, esq., have continued to discharge their duties most acceptably. Upon Mr. Hoover devolved important and difficult duties connected. with my work at Philadelphia, which he has discharged with zeal and fidelity. Respectfully submitted by A.D.BAOHE,

Sm: 'I'l1e principal reefs coming within the limitB of my work of this season are as follows: Frerich Reif-The southwestern extremity of this reef, situated about half way between French Reef Beacon and the beacon on Pickle's Reef, is one of the most dangerous points on the Florida range for vessels intending to follow tl1e line of the Beacons. It projects half a mile to the eastward of a straight line between the two Tieacon~ referred to, and has as little as one foot of water upon it. Pickle Reef is marked at its middle by beacon F. In a NE. and SW. direction its extent is about a mile and a quarter, with a foot of water at its shoalest part. Between the north encl of it and French Reef i;; an opening three-quarters of a mile wide, through which sixteen feet can be carried. The southern portion of tlie Reef deepens gmdually to twelve feet, that depth being a mile and a quarter from the Beacon, hut there is a narrow cut of deeper water at less distance in the same direction. Thence on, and to within three-quarters of a mile from Beacon E, on Conch lleef, there is an opening of a mile and a half which has three and four fathoms of water. Concli Reef has as little as eighteen inches of water on it. It is a mile and a quarter long, lying NE. and S"\V., and separated from Little Conch Reef by a narrow c11t of four and five fathoms. 'l'he shoalest water on Little Uoncb is six feet, and breaks in moderate breezes. Davia Reef is about half way between Little Conch and Crocus Reef, with four feet of water, which breaks generally at low tide. This is a small reef running NW. and SE. There are openings of a mile and a half on either side of it wliicb give three and four fathoms of water. Crocus Reif extends ab011t three hundred yards NW. and SE., and can be approached within one hundred and fifty yards. On its sh<>alest part the water is two feet deep. Beacon D, which marked this reef, and Beacon C, set up on Alligator Reef, were both destroyed in the gale of August, 1861. It is very important that these marks should be replaced at the earliest moment practicable. Between the Florida Reefa and the line of Keys there are two channels; one, known as the Hawk Channel, extends all the way from Cape Florida to Key West. Two of the buoys which mark it come within the limits of this season's work, the sheet embracing a stretch of about fifteen miles .· These are 'l'riangle Shoal buoy, :rncl the buoy on Hen and Chicken. The other channel is not buoyed out, and i.s very seldom used except by wreckers f,,miJiar with its bends and intricacies. It runs inside of the outer reef from Cape Florida to Alligator Bank. Vessels that drift on the reef, and succeed in getting over into deeper water inside, may avail themselves of this channel to make their way to the nearest opening between the reefs, and through it into the Gulf, by means of the chart, and by using tbe lead and observing the shaded color of the water. · · Very :respectfully, EDW.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

We sounded in 3~ fathoms at llli. 52m., June 11. This will, at extreme low water, reduce to less tlian fathoms, and sets at rest the question of a ship striking it without regard to weather or sea. 'l'he battered end of the lead used gave good evidence of the hard character of the bottom in the vicinity of the Rock, which is either itself of coral, or encrusted with some coralline form11tion, as detached particles were driven into the lead so as to inlay it thorouglily and change its color. 1\'ith our means no pieces large enough for specimens could be procured. There are no indications of the vicinity of the rock to be relied upon. Any vessel near enough to be warned by her lead would be too close to it for safety. The length of the ledge seems to be in the direction of a line to the North or South Farallones, and not more than twenty yards iu extent, within twenty fathoms of the surface of the water. The top of the rock is an edge in three and a half fathoms, just large enough to hold a lead, and no more. I believe that the determination in poeition of the Noonday or Fanny R<Jck need no longer be considered approximate. The bydrograpbic draughtsman, Mr. Farquhar, was statim1ed at Point Reyes and observed upon the vessel while she was at the rock; and although the weather was not so clear as I wished, the limit of errors shown by a series of angles from the vessel and Point Reyes is so small as to satisfy me that the first determination was conect. I have now ranges by which, in clear weather, the rock can be found without difficulty. l\It. St. Helena, Coast Survey station, is conspicuously prominent, open about two ship-lengths to the westward of Point Reyes head, while a peak of the high land to the southward of Pt. San Pedro affords an excellent cross bearing. This lust could not be seen sufficiently long to identify it by name while we were at the rock. Very respectfully, yours, AUG. F. RODGERS, Assistant Coast Surz·cy. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent United States Coast Survey, TVasltingt{Yft, D. C.

TIDE TABLES FOR THE esE OF NAYICATOR8, PREPARED YROM THE COAST srnYEY OBSERVATIONS,
8Cl'EIUNTENDENT.
[l'urnbhcd by authority of the Treasury Departrn~nt to E. nnd G.

Tl1e following tables will enable navigators to ascertain the time and height of high and low water in E'Ome of the principal port8 of the United States. 'l'he results are approximate, the observations being still in progreELs, and the time <luring which many of them have been made are steadily on the increase as the coast survey advances. Tbe tides on the const of the United Stntes, on the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific, are of three different clasFel'. Tho8e of the Atlantic are of tlie most ordinary type, ebbing an<l flowing twice in twenty-four lwurs, and having but moderate differences in height between the two successive high waters or low water1>, one occurring before noon, the otlicr after noon.

THE UNITED STA.TES COAST SURVEY.

85

Those of tlic Pacific coast also ebb and flow twice during 1wcnty-four bonri<, but the morning and afternoon tides differ very considerably in height, so much HO that at certain periods a rock which has tl1ree fe;~t and a half water upon it at low tide may be awash on the next succeeding low water. The intervals, too, between successive high ancl succes1dve low waters may be very unequal. The tides of ports in the Gulf of :Mexico, west of Cape St. GL'Orge, ebb and flow, as a ru1c, but once in twenty-four hours, or are single day tides. At particular parts of the month there are two small tides in the twenty-four hours. The rise and fall in all these ports is small. East of Cape St. George the rise and fall increases; there are two tides, as a rule, during the twenty-four hours, and the daily inequality referred to in the Pacific tides is large. Th~se peculiarities require a different way of treating the cases, anc1 in some of them separate ta blea. I propose to enable the navigator to finc1, from the Nautical Almanac and the following tables, the time and height of high arnl low water at any date within the ordinary Tange of difference proc1uccc1 by winds and other"variable circumstances. I will endeavor to divc~t the matter of unfamiliar technical expressions as far as practic"able, though, for shortness' sake, some such terms may be employed after defining t11em. 'l'he discus;,;ion of the Gulf tides has not been carried 8U far a~ to enable me to pre~cnt the results in as definite a form as the others. .As is.well known, the interval between the time of the moon's crossing the meridian (moon's tmnsit) and the time of bigh water at a given place is nearly constant; that is, this interval varies between moderate limits, which can be assigned. The interval at full and change of the moon is known as the establishment of · the port, and is ordinarily ma1·ked on the charts. As it is not generally the average of the interval during a month's tides, it is a less convenient and less accurate quantity for the use of the navigation than the average interval which is used on the Coast Survey eharts, and is sometimes called the "mean" or "corrected establishment."* The following table gives the principal ticlal quantities for the different ports named in the first column, where they are arranged under specific heads. The third column of the table gives the mean interval, in hours and minutes, between the moon's transit and the time of high water next after the transit; the fourth, the difference between the greatest and the least interval occurring in different parts of the month, (lunar.) A simple inspection of this cnlumn will show how important it is to deteTmine these changes in many of the ports where they amount to morf~ than half an hour, or to more than fifteen minutes from the average interval. 'l'he fifth, sixth, and seventh columns refer to the height of the tide. Tlw fifth gives, in fe et, the average rise and fall, or average difference between high and low water; the :-;ixth gives the greate;<t difference, commonly known as the rise and fall of spring tides; and the seventh the least difference, known as the rise and fall of the neap tides_ The average duration of the flood or rising tide is gin~u in the eighth column; of the ebb or falling tide in the ninth; and of the period during which the tide neither ril:'cs nor falls, or the "stand," in the tenth. 'l'he duration of the flood is measured from the middle of the etand at low water to the middle of the stand at l1igh water, so that the whole duration from one high water to the next, or from one low water to the next, should be given by the sum of tlie numLers in the eig·hth and ninth columns. .At most of these places given in the list a mark of reference has been estalilished for the height of the tide_ I have omitted the description of these marks, (except in the following localities,) as of no particular interest in thi8 com1exion.

'"'Sec remarks on page 92, and followhig.

Note.-Thc mean interval in column 3 has been increased by 1271.. 26m., (half a mean lunar day,) for some of the port~ in Delaware river and Chesapeake Lay, so as to show the succession of times from the mout11. Therefore 121;. 26m. ought tu be subtracted from the establishments which are greater than that quantity before using them. The foregoing Table I gives thf' means of determining, roughly, the time and height of high water at the several ports named. The hour of transM: of the moon prcccdiug the time of high water is to be taken from the Almanac, and the mean establishment being added, the time of high water results. Thus: Example 1.-It is required to find the time of high water at New.York on November 5, 1854. Tlie Americ:m Almanac gives Olt. Om. as the time of transit of the moon on that day. The mean interval for Kew York, from Table I, column 3, is SJ,. l 3m., which, as tl1EJ transit was at Ok., is, roughly, thEJ time of high water. The moon being full, the height is tl1at of spring tides of column 6, viz., 5.4 feet. If the soundings on the chart arc reduced to low water spring tides, 5.4 foet arc to be added to them to give the depth at high water. If the soundings are reduced to mean low water, the rise and fall of m<'an tides being 1.1 foot less than for spring8, the rise or incrnase of depth will be half <Jf this, or 0.6 of a foot less than 5.4 feet, which is 4.8 feet, or nearly four feet ten inclll's. Example II.--Rcquired, tlic time of high water at Boston on ,January 23, 1851. From the American Almanac we find the time of the mr1on's southing or transit on that day Mt. !Sm. a.. m., and from Table I the mean interval at Bo8ton dry dock is l llt,. 27m. 1.Ye have then 571. I8m., time of transit. 'l'o which add 11 27 mean interval from Table I.
16
45

time of high water, or 4h. 45m. p. m.

If the Greenwich Nautical Almanac is used, add 2m. to the time of transit of Greenwich for every hour of
west longitude, and its proportional part for less than an hour. It will suffice to take the half liour which may be over any number of hours, as the c~rrection for less than this would be less than one minute, and

need not be taken into account. 'I'hus, B0ston is 4li. 44m. west of Greenwich. The correction to be applied to the time of transit of the moon is, for the four hours, eight minutes, arnl for the forty-four minutes, one minute. The time of transit on the date assumed in the preceding example is l"llt. 9m. of the 22d, or 5h. 9m. a. m. of the 23d, to which add nine minutes, the correction just found, give~ .SJ,. 1 Sm., as before ascertained from the American Almanac. ln usi11g the U uitcd States X :mtical Almanac, in tlw aRtrnnomical part of which the transit~ of the moon are given for the meridian of 'Yashington, the corrections required may, in this first approximation for the Atlantic cmrnt, be negl<~cwd. 'l'o find the time of the next following low water, add, from TaLle I, the duration of ebl1 tide. This gives 4.iL 45m. p. m., time of high water. 6 13 duration of ebb from 'l'aule I.

3~m. a. m., i·ecollecting that 4h. 45m. p. m. is the same as lGlt. 45m. reckoned from midnight. The height of this tide, corresponding to the tranc'it of 51&., will bring it nearly to a neap tide, and the rise and fall obtained from column 7, Table I, is 8.5 feet. The next following high water may be had by adding to the time of low water the duration of flood from Table I. Thus.: 10/i. 58m. p. m., time of low water January 23. 6 13 duration of flood from Table I.

10 58 p. m. By 8Ubtracting the duration of flood tide we obtain the time of the prceecling low wate1·, lOlt.

Sum 1 "I 11 or 51.. llm. on Jauuary 24. Or, having found the time of high water, the time of the next follnwiug high water mny be founu l,y aclding the duratwn of flood and e.bb together, and their sum to the time of high wetter found, thui': 6lt. 13m., duration of ebb tide, from Table I. · 6 13 duration of flood. Sum 12 26 duration of whole tide. p. m., ,Tauuary 23, time of high water.

4

45

Sum 17 11 or 5lt. llm. a. m., January 24, time of the next sueeeeJing high water. Subtracting the same quantity will give the time of the prececliug- high water, thus: 4lt. 45m. p. m., or lG!t. 45rn. from midnight, it> the time of high water. 12 26 duration of flood and ebb tide. 4 19 a. m. of the 23d for the preceding high water. The duration of the flood and tlie ebb b(~iug reckoneil from the mic1c1le of one 8tand or slack wnt<·r to the middle of the next, the timP of brginning of ~Janel of ebb or flood will be found by tinbtrncting half the durn.tion of stand or slack water given hy colnmu 10, Table I, from the time of high or low wakr, nncl the time of the end of the stand of ebb or flood by alldiIJg the same. A nearer approximation to 't11c times and heights of high water may be obtained by the use of Tables II and Ill. 12 cs

In these the variations in the inten·al between the mo<?n's transit and high water are sh,nn1 for some of the principal ports contained in Table I. These variations of intervals depend upon the age of the moon, and, as they go through their values in h~f a lu11ar month, arc k11own as the half-monthly inequality of iuterval. 'l'he table extends from the Oli. of transit, midnight of the calendar day, 01· full of the moon, to 112 hours. The numbers for change of the moon correspond to those of Oh., and for 13 hours (or llt. p. m. of the calendar day) to 1 hour, and so on up to 23 hours. The ports for which the number& are given are designated Ly the heading of the column. The mean interval, it will be seen, does not occur at full and change, but nearly two days afterwards, on the Atlantic coast. At Key West it occurs more nearly at full and change, and at San Francisco still more nearly, The same remark applies to the heigh ts; spring tides occur about two days after the full and cliangc of the moon, and neaps two days after the first and last quarters. 'l'he use of thi~ table of nearer approximation is quite as simple as that of Table I. Rule to.find tke time ef higli water.-L:iok in the Almanac for the tin1c of the moou'B traui'it (or southing) for the date required. In the table corresponding to that time will be found th1c; number to be a<l<led to the time of transit.

REPORT OF THE

SUPERI~TENDE~T

OF

Example Ill.-Rt?quired the time of high water at New York October 1, 1866. Using the United States Nautical Almanac, we find tbe time of the moon's transit lh. 24m., astronomical reckoning, or lli. 24m. p. m., calcnda.r time. From 'Ta1ile II we have, under the heading of New York, for lh. 30m. (the nearest nurnhcr to lli. 24m. in the table) 81t. lOm.

'l'hus, to lh. 24m., time of moon'~ transit, Add 8 10 intcn-al found in Table III.

p. m. is tire time of 11igh water on the 1st of October, 1856. 'l'he sum 9 34 lf the sum of these numbers had exce1'rlecl twelv_e, the tii1e would have belongcerl to October 2, and we must have gone back to tl1e transit of the day before :md computed with it to obtain the ticle of October 1. Rule to find tlie ltei'gld ef lngli water.-Enter Table III, column l, with the time of moon's transh. In the column headecl with the name of the place, and mmked A, will be found the rise and fall corresponding to the time of transit; in column B the number to be added to soundings on the c1rnrt, where the soundings are given for mean low water; in column C the number to be added to charts of which the soundings arc given for low water spring tides. In the foregoing example, (III,) the time of tram it beiDg between l and 2 llllnrs, we find from Table III the 1·ise and fall of tides on the 1st of October, 185G, between 4.9 and '!.7; the number to be added to sounding8 given for menu low water 4.5 feet, (column B,) and for low watCl' spring tides (column 0) 4.H feet. lfaving found tlie time of high watf>r, that of low water may be obtained, nearly, by adding the dnrntion of ebb from column 9, Table I. The tinw of tl1e 1Jext prPce1ling low water may he found Ly subtracting the duratinn of flood from column 8, Table I. The time of the next following high water may be found by acldiug the duration of both tloo<l. and eLb; and of the next preceding high water by subtracting the same duratiun of the whole tide. Example 1 V.-'l'o find t11e next high water following that of Example II I. TLc duration of flood, column 8, Table I, for New York, is Gh. Om., and of cub, from column 9, is Gll. 25m.; tLe 8UID is 12h. 25m. To fJlt. 34m. p. m., October 1, time of high water found, AdJ 12 25 dmation of flood and ebb.
Sum 21 59 or 9li.. 59m. a. m of October 2, the time of the next high water.

TIDES OF THE PACIFIC COAST AND OF PART OF THE COAST OF FLORIDA.
On the Pacific coast there arc, a>' a general ruk, one large ancl one small .tide during the day, the height of the two ~uc.ee~~ive high waterE occmring one a. m. the other p. m. of the same twenty-four hours, and tlie interval~ from tl1c next preceding transit of the moon are vPry different. '1'hc i11equalities t1epem1 upon the moon'rl declination; tbl'y lli~appear rJPar the time of the moon's declination being nothing, arnl are gl·eatest about the time of its being greatest. The inequalities for low water arc not the same as for high, though they disap1ienr and lrnve the greatest value at nearly the same times. 'l'he ticles of the southern part of Florida au cl of the western coast of that peninsula, as far as St. Mark's, are of tlw same charader. In l'ugd':-1 stmud tl1c inequalities for the iutcrval of high water and for the height of low water follow this rule; but those for tlie interval of low water an(l height of high·water disappear about one day before the moon's cleclination is greate8t; and are greatest about four or five days before the greatest declination. \Yhcn the moon's declination is north, the highest of the two tides of the twenty-four hours occurs at San l'rancisco ab0ut eleven and a half hours after the moou'R southing, (transit;) and when the declination is south, the lowest of the two Ligh tide~ occurs about that interval. 'I.'he lowest of the two low waters of the day is the one which follows next the highest high wate:i:. The nature of these tides will probably appea:i: more plainly from the annexed diagrams. In them the height of the tide is set off at the side on a scale of feet, and the hours of the day arc at the top. At 12 noon, for examvle, the tide-gauge marked 6.7 feet. Joining all the. heights ohserveil in the twenty-four hours, we have a curve like that marked in thr figure. The two high waters are a ancl c, the two low waters b and d. If a is the high water which occurs about twelve hours after the transit of the moon, when the declination is south, the ebb a b is quite small, and the high water, a, is mush lower than the next high water, c. If the moon's declination is north, it ie the large high water, a, of the second diagram which occurs next after the transit,

If we disregard the daily inequality, the column heFtded SFtn Franci~co in 'l'able II would give us, as in the examples on tl1e Atlantic coast, the means of determining the time of high mtter. Example V:-Ifoquired, the time of high water at North Beach, Sau Francisco, UaL. on the 7th of February, 1853. 1st. 'l'he time of the moon's transit at Greenwich, from the Nautical Alm·mac, is lllt. 4lm.; tlic longitude of San Francisco Bk. l Om., rf'rp1iring a correction of 16rn. to the time of transit for Sciu J.'r:uu,is,·o, which is thus found to be 1111. 57m. 2d. 'l'he ruoon'~ decliuation is south, and at the time of transit about two days after the greatest. Entering Table IV we fiwl l~h. (or Oh.) of transit, the ncarc:Jt numuer to l lh. ;,1 m. which the t:ilJle gives; and following the li11e hmiznutally until Wl' comp to two clay' af1.1;i· the gn>.atl,,;t dedim1tion, we foul l~M.

If we desire tht> ri,Ic, of Fc!Jru:iry 7 we must go back to tlH: moon'o trnn~it of tbe Gth. 'I'he example was JHHpo~<"ly aFFUnwrl to ~how thiF ca~<'. 117'.

The" d,·clination Leing south, diagram I applies, and this high water is the emall one. To obtain the foll of the next low water or small low water, we enter Table IX, fol' San Francisco, witl1 Oh. of moon'~ tran8it, and two days aftc1· the greatest declination in the :first part of the table, and find 1.9 foot, whicl1 will be the difference in the height of this .high and low water. Entering witl1 the same transit and day in the second part, we fm11 3.0 ft'et, which i1' the rise of tl1e large high above the small low water; the differenct· between l.!J arnl 3.0, or 1 .1 foot, is the difference of height of the two successive high waters. lt is easy to see how, in thi:,; way, the soundings of a chart can be reduced to what. they wouiJ be approximately at all the successive higl1 and low waters.

TIDES OF THE GUU' OF MEXICO. On the coast of Florida, from Cape Florida around the peninsula to St. Mark's, the tides are of the orrliuary kind, but with a daily inequality which, small at Cairn 1''l01·ida, goes on increasing as we proceed W·:~twanl to Tortuga~. From the Tortugas to St. l\Iark's the dnily inequality is large and sensibly the surn1"

giving the tides a great resemblance to those of the Pacific coast, though the rise and fall is much smal1cr. Between St. !lark's anil St. George's i,;land, Apalachicoltt cutnrnce, the tiileil change to the single-day class, ebbing and flowing but ouce in the twenty-four (lunar) hours. · At St. George's island there arc two tide,; a clay, for tlirec or four days, abont the iimc of the mo011'8 declination heing zero. At other times there ii< but one tide a day, wit11 a long stand at high water of from six to nine hours. From Cape St. Blas to and including the mouth of the :'\Iis8issippi, the singk-<lay tides are very regular, anil the small and irregular double tides appe:tr only for two or three <lays, (aud frequently even not at all,) about the time of zero declination of the moo1i. The 10tancl at high nnil low water is comparatively short, 8eldom exceeding an hour. 'l'o the west of the mouth of the ::Uiseissippi the double tideF reappear. At Jslc Demien; they arc distinct, though a little irregnlar for tlirf'e or four tlays 11Par tl1c t.imc of th1· rnoon'~ Z('nJ fkdiuatiou. At all otlwr times tJ1e single-day type prevails, the double tides modifying it, however, in tlw ~hape of a long stand of from six to ten hours at high water. This stand fa shorte~t at the time of the moon'~ p:reatef't declination, sometimes being reduced to but one hour. At Calcasieu the tides are distinctly double, but with !l large daily inequality. The rise Rnd fall being small, they would often present to the ordinary ob~erver the same appearance as ·at lslc Dernii1rc. At Galveston the double tides are 1ilainly perceptible, though emall, for five or six days at tlrn time of the moou ',,; zero Jcdination. At otl1er times they present thP ~ingle-day type, with the pcculLirity that, after standing at high water for a short time, the water falls a small <linance, and stands again at that height for several hours, then continues to fall to low water. Sometimes it falls very slowly for nine or ten hours following high water, and then acqui1·cs a more rapid rate to low water. At Aransas !'ass and Brazos Santiago the single-day tides prevail. Small, irregular, double tides are only perceived for two or th1·ee days at the moon's zero declination. At all other times there is lmt one high water iu the day, with a long stand of from six to nim~ ho11n, during which there an: often Rrnall, irregular fluctuations or a very slow fall. In the following table the mean rise aml fall of tide~ at tbe above stations are given. The highest high and the lowest low water occur when the greate:;;t declination of the moon happens at full or change; the least tide when the moon's declination is nothing at the first or last c1uarter. 'l'he rise and fall being so small, the times and heights are both much influenced by the winds, and are thus rendered quite irregular. TABLE X.

REPORT 01'' THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

TO DETERMINE TEE RISE

A~D

F ALI" OF THE TIDES l<'Oll ANY GIVEN TIME FROM HIGH OR LOW WATER.

It is sometimes desiralile to know how far the tide wm rise in a given time from low water, or fall in a given time from high water, or to approximate to the time which bus elapsed from low or high water, by knowing the rise and fall of tlie tide in the interval. If the proportion of the rise and fall in a given time were the same in the different imrts, this would easily be shown in a single table, giving the JJTOportional ri8e and fall, which, by referring to Table I, showing the rise and fall of the tide at the port, would give the rise and fall in feet and decimals. The proportion, however, is not the sam<l in different ports, nor in the same ports for tides of different heights. The following Table XI shows the relation between the heights above low water for each half hour for New York anr1 Olrl Point Comfort, arnl for spring and ueap titles at each place. Units express the total rise of high water above low water, and the figures opposite to each half hour denote the proportional fall of the tide from high water onward to low water. For example, at New York, tliree hours after high water, a spring tide has fallen six-tentl1s (sixty-hundredths) of the whole fall. Suppose the whole rise and fall of that day to be 5.4 feet, (Table T;) tl1en three hour~ after high watm, the title will have fallen 3.24 feet, or three feet three inches, nearly. Conversely, if we have observed that a spring tide has fallen three feet three inches, we may know that high water has passed aliout three hours.

TIDES IN COASTING.
By observing the time of high water and low water along the coast we find the places at which they are the same. 'The map of co-tidal lines (Sketch No. 65, C. S. Rep., 1857) shows that it is high water nearly at the eamc hour all along the coast from Sandy Hook to Cape Canaveral; of course not in bayfl and harbors and up the rivers, but on the outer coast. It is high w11ter exactly at the same hour all along the line marked XII, sren on the chart, near Sandy Hook, and north and south of Hatteras, and, with small interruptions at Cape Lookout and Cape :Fear, all the way to near Cape Canaveral. The same line extends eailtward to near Block island, and south of Nantucket, and then passes away from our coast. At full and change of the moon, along this line, (approximately,) it is

high water at twelve o'clock, Greenwich time, the local time of high water depending upon tlie longitude of the place; or, to speak more correctly, in the average of a lunar month it is bigh water so mauy hours after the time of the moon's passing the meridian of Greenwich. .By these lines, called co-tidal lines, we can determine what tidal currents the navigators must expect to meet in coasting; and for th:s purpose we divide the ports of the coast into two sets, those south and those north of New York. The sailing lines of coasters, bound to southern po1·ts this side of the straits of Florida, are marked upon the map, and also those bound through the sounds to eastern ports, and outside to Halifax aud European ports.

PORTS SOUTH OF NEW YOHK.

South of Sandy Hook, New Jersey, the line of XII hours is nowhere more than 18 miles from the coast; that of Xli nowhere more than 35 miles; that of XIz nowhere more than 48; and XI nowhere more than 110. The distance of these lines of XII to XI hours (corresponding within four minutes to VII and VI of New York time,) for different parts of the coast, is shown from Table A, where the firat column gives the name of the place, and the second, third, fourth, :fifth, respectively, the distances of the co-tidal lines of XII, XI~, XI~, and XI hours. The distances are measured from the ports on perpendiculars to the co-tidal lines. '!'hey may be taken as if measured on tho parallel of latitude at all the points for the line of XII hours, and at all between Sandy Hook and Cape Hatteras for the lines of XI~ and Xlj! hours.

The co-tidal lines are in such directions that at 10, 20, and 30 mileo from the coast, between Sandy Hook and the St. John's, there is but a variation of seven minutes, and even to Cape Canaveral only of eight minutes. Keeping ten milee from the shore th11 coaster would pass from 12 hours at Sandy Hook to 11 l10ars 45 minutes at Hatteras, and increase again irregularly to 12 hours 7 minutes at the St.. John'~, as shown more explicitly in Table B. These three tracks of IO, 20, and 30 miles are inside of the cold wall of the Gulf Stream, and generally in the cold current, except at Cape Canaveral. 1.5 c s

It follows, then, as a general thing, from these two tables, that the coaster, in passing from Sandy Hook to the St. John's, would have the tides the sarn1e, within some :fifteen minutes, as if he remained at Sandy Hook; so that leaving, for example, at high water, he would, according to the elapsed time, have the ebb and flood alternating every six hours and a quarter, nearly, as if he had remained near Sandy Hook. As the flood tic1e sets in generally to the northward and on shore, and the ebb to the southward and off shore, he would know by tlie time that elapsed from his departure and the period of the tide at which be started, what tidal currents he might expect to meet as he passed along the coast. This, of course, is not peculiar to Sandy Hook as a point of departure, lmt would be true for any of the entrances given in the table, taking care n0t to mistake the time of tides within for that at the entrance. By referring to George W. Blunt, esq., I have ohtained the tracks .of sailing and steam vessels passing from New York to ports to the south of it, as shown by the lines on the chart accompanying this paper. (See Sketch No. 65, 0. S. Rep., 1857.) Tracing these on the map of co tidal lines, I have determined how the navigator would :find the tides as he passes from port to port. The results are shown in the annexed table, (C,) in which the port between which and Sandy Hook the mariner passes is at the head of the table, and, at the aide, the place off which the co-tidal hours will be found, 8.l! stated in the table.

Thus from Sandy Hook to Delaware bay, f'tarting with 12 hours 5 minutes, off Barnegat there would be, at the same instant, 11 hours 57 minute:<, and off Cape May 12 hours 10 minutes, so that the navigator would haYe the same succession of tides whether he remained at Sandy Hook or passed onward to Delaware bay, or whether he came from Delaware bay to Sandy Hook. So from Sandy Hook to Charleston he will :find, at tl1e same instant, 12 hours 5 minutes at Saudy Hook, 11 hours ,57 minutes off Barnegat, 11 hours 45 minutes off Cape May, and so onward upon the parallels of latitude for the scycral points. J<or all practical purposes, then, ef cQasting, tke succession ef the tides, and, ef CQUrse, ef tlie tidal current.s <!f ffow anrl ehb, will be th,e same as if tlte nanigator remained stationary. Leaving at low water he will meet the flood for G hours 15 minutes, and then the ebb for another 6 hours 15 minutes, and so on. It is the simplest of all rules that has thus come out of this investigation. '£hat remarkaLle change of thG temperature between the water~ of the in-shore cold current and the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, occurring in so short a distance that Lieutenant Bache called it the "cold wall," takes placG at distances off the coast of from 170 to 29 miles· (see Table D,) between Sandy Hook and Cape Canaveral, measured, from the several points named in the table, at right angles to the direction of the course, or measured along the parallels of latitude of tbe points, at distances from 195 to 28 miles, between Assateague and Cape Canaveral, (Table D.) The points where the parallels north of Assateague meet this division line have not been accurately determined. The annexed table shows these distances measured at right angles and on the parallels.

In paesing from New York to an eastern port the first great change in the tides and tidal currents fo between the East river and Long Island sound; the difference between Governor's island and N pgro Point, on Ward's island, at the eastern entrance to Hell Gate, is two hours and forty-five minutes. Between this point and Throg's Point the change is E!mall. The mariner is now in the foll tide of the rnund, and between 'l'hrog's Point and Fisher's island there is a difference of time of but two hours and twenty minutes, the greatest part of which is at the head of the sound and at its entrance-that is, near Throg's Point and Fisher's island. From off New London to off Sand's Point tl1e difference is hut one lrnur and forty minutes; so tl1at if the mariner, instead of remaining at Tlirog's Point, passes onward to Fi8her's faland, he would lose but half a tide in the whole passage. Jn other word~, he would have the same succesl:'ion of rise and fall, according to the time elapsed, whether stationary or passing onward, witl1in two 110urs and a half, or less than half a tide. The tidal current lines show that even a less allowance is to be mcide for t.hc cliange of current tlian for the change of tide; thf\ difference in the change of current between 'l'hrog's Point and Fi,;her's island, along the middle of the sound, being of no practical importance. Passing out of Long l8land sound the tidal hours grow earlier, until off Block island that of Sandy Hook is again reached. The co-tidal line of Sanrly Hook and Block island being the same, it is the struggle of the same tide through New York bay and the narrow East river, and obstructed Hell Gate, and through Fisher'..i island and Long Island sonrnl, and to 'Ihrog's Point. The tidal currents meet near Throg's I>oint, The lower part of Narragansett bay has the co-tidal hour twelve hours, nearly. Buzzard's bay has nearly the same co-tidal hour, the tide wave reaching the shore at nearly tbe same time all around the bay. It would be impossible to give in a small compass a minute account of tlie tideE< of ?ilartha's Vint>yard and Nantucket sound, In general it may be said that as far as Holmes's Hole and Wood's Hole they resemble those of Block Island sound, and afterwards those of 1\Ionomoy, at the eastern entrance; but this generalization is unsatisfactory without more dctail8 than there is space here to giYe. In these sounds takes place the remarkable cha11ge of between three and four hours, the greate8t clrnnge of our coast, dislocating, as it were, the times of high water at places south and west and east and north of Nantucket. The whole of this change takes place between the eastern entrance of N:1ntucket sound and the we,;tern of l\fartha's Vineyard, giving rise to quite a complex condition of both tides and currents, which it ha~ occupied much time to unravel. The dominant co-tidal line of our coast, from Block i8larn1 to Cape CafrnY1eral, is tliat of 12 hours of Greenwicli time; that of our eastern coast, from Nantucket to Passamaquoddy, is, in gmieral, 15 hours. Passing out of Nantucket sound, coasters carry nearly the eame co-tidal hour to Cape Cod, and thence vary tlieir time about half an honr in passing to Doston, to Portsmouth, to Portfand, or to Passamaquoddy. It has long been known that the tidal almanac for Boston might practically be m1ecl for 1·asLern ports. V Pi'sels from New York to Halifax, and New York to EuropP, which keep outside, and should keep well off the Nantucket shoalB, and off George's, as shown by tlw track on thn chart, vary their co-tidal hour but little, keeping between the lines of 12 and 11 :! until quite well on their course, and beyond Cape Sable. The same rule will apply to their case as has been given for vessels bet,yeeu New York and a southt:rn port.

REPORT TO THE SUPERINTE"DENT RY ASIUSTANT L. F. POL'RTALES. IN CHARGE OF THE FIELD AND OFFICE WORK, RELKl'ING TO TIDAL OBSERYATIONS.

CoAST SURVEY 0Ff'ICE, Ortober 1, 1R63. SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field and office work performed by the tidal party under my charge during the past year. Field-work.-The tidal stations occupied during the past year have been the same as fltated in my last report, viz: Eastport, Jlfe, Boston, Mass., New York, Old Point Comfort, Ya., San Diego and San Francisco, Cal., and Astoria, Oregon. All of these stations are permanent ones. No temporary stations were established or occupied, with the exception of those connected with the hydrographie parties, but which do not come under the charge of this division. The station at Eastport remained in char~ of J\fr. R. H. Talcott until November 1, 1862, when he was ordered to tlie field. His place was supplied by Assistant E, Goodfellow, wbo is still in charge of the station. Ile continues also the magnetic observations at that stat.ion. During some severe weather in the past winter,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

the protection afforded by kerosene oil in the float-box of the tide-gauge proved insufficient; the oil by becoming thick impeded the motion of the float. The experience of former winters proves, however, that this will occur only in exceptional cases. The obseTvations in Boston have, as usual, been carried on with the greatest regularity, and have offered no incident wortl1y of notice. 'The same may be sai1l of the stations at Governor's island and Old Point Comfort, though in a less degree, as the self-registering gauges in thm;e places are now liable to be interfered with by the numerous vessels landing at the wharves. The observations on the western coast lrnve been very satisfactory. They are still in charge of the same observers, under the supervision of Captain G. H. Elliot, of the corps of engineers, U. S. A. Information was received last spring from the provost marshal of Brashear city, Louisiana, that the selfregistering tide-gauge formerly in use at Last. island, and supposed to have been seized by the rebels, had been turned over to him by the former observer, H. P. 'ViLmn. A reply was sent requesting the provost marshal to forwanl the tide-gauge to this office, and to inquire into t11e loytilty of \Vilson, so that a balance due to him since the bl·ginning nf the rebellinn might be paid. No answer was received, probably on account of the military movements in that neighborhood. Further steps have, however, been taken in the matter. The following table gives a recapitulation of the observations received at the office during the years exclusive "f those taken by the hyurngraphic p'.l.rties:

REPORT OF ASSISTANT J. E. HILGARD, IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE, AXD SCH-REPORTS OF THE CHIEFS OF OFFICE DIVISIONS.

COAST SURVEY 0PFICE, 1Vashington, ]!\"ucember 1, 1863. SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith the annual report of the operations of the Coast Survey office, which has remained under my charge during the past year. From the detailed statements of t11e work done in its tieveral branches, it will appear that w}1ile no effort has been spared to meet the extraordinary demands fo1· information and special maps and charts arising from tlie military and naval operations of the national forces, the regular progress of the office-work l1as been kept steadily in view, although prosecuted with a reduced forct;, and a correspondingly lessened expenditure. In the general direction of the office, I have been ably assisted since June by Prof. _F. A. P. Bamai·d, general assistant, who has besides had the immediate charge of the lithographing and miscellaneous divisions, upon which branches the burden of the calls arising from the present war mainly falls. I have received acceptable aid from Assistant A . .:\{. Harrison, who during the intervals of field-work relieved rue in t.he immediate direction of the drawing di,·ision, and from Sub-AE<sistants P. C. I:'. West, J. S. Bradford, and C. H. Boyd, who at different times during the year ha;·e been temp0rarily attached to the office, and have aided in preparing information for the use of other departments of the public service. The clerical duties of the office have been f'fficiently performed by .Mr. V. E. King, assisted at different times by .Messrs. J. A. Sample, H. Ogden, and 'Vm. GadBhy, jr. My acknowledgments are due to Samuel Hein, esq., tlie disbursing officer of the Coast Survey, and to Joseph Saxton, esq., the assistant in charge of the office of weights and measures, whose experience and advice lias at all times bel'n freely available; and to the chiefs of divisiouR for their prompt co-operation in the direction of the work under their charge, a detailed account of which is now presented. Yours, respectfully,

HvDROGRAPHIC DIVISION.-The operations of thiR division, wl1ich embrace the planning and preparation of sheets for hydrographic surveys, their verification when the work has been plotted, the verification of the reduced hydrograpby for engraYing, the preparation of sailing directions, and all l1ydrographic notes for charts, and all other matters pertaining specially to l1ydrogr11phy, have continued to he under the efficient direction of the hydrogrnphic inspector, Captain 0. P. Parterson. Two draughtsmen have been employed under his immediate direction, whose occupation during the past year may be thus :etated: ]}fr. Arthur Ba1"ach. has made verifications of original hydrogrnpl1ic eheets, examined and corrected proofs of maps and charts to be publiEhed, brought up to date chart!' published showing additional survPys, and has examined original hydrographic records with reference to discrepancies on original and publiehed charts. He has selected soundings for reduction of original sheets to repreEent the character of the bott<>m; verified and corrected reduced hydrographic drawings; has laid down sailing lines and current stations on tlic various charts preparin.g for publication. He has, besides, compiled comparative maps and sketches, and prepared tables showing the depth at certain inlets, bars, etc., of the coast of the United States. ltlr. LouiH Karcnf"r has been engaged in making prnjections for liydrographic 11arties in the field; lias plotted original hydrographic work; made reductions of that of the Potomac river for engraving-; assisted in the veriftcation of original charts and rednced drawings; made tracings of parts of the coast for tbe use of the navy, and is at present engaged upon the reduction of the hydrography of a part of the Florida reef!'. TIDAL DIVISIO:v.-This division has been, as heretofore, under the charge of A~si;;tant L. F. Pourtales; its operations, relating to general discmsions of tides, are carried on under the immediate direction of the su~rintendent, while the office derives from it the data required for surveys and charts. The following i~ a report of occupations of persons employed: JJ;Ir. R. S. Avery was engaged in the discussion of the diurnal tides of the western coast. He afterwards took up the reduction of the permanent stations to deduce the :final results of those of which tlie series 11as been interrupted on the eonthern coast, and to revise and bring up to date those made by different computers. Mr. John DotNU!& was engaged i11 reading off the o:heets from the self-registering tide-gauges and reducing the results until the 1st of June, when he was put in clu1.rge of the archives.

120

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

l'rir. P. H. Donegan made ordinary reductions of tides and miscellaneous work until the 1st of June, when he took up the reading off of the 8elf-registering tide-sheets made up to that time by .Mr. Downes. M. Thomas was chiefly engaged in copying the readings of the self-registering tide-gauges, according to a uniform system, for preservation in the archives, and has also done mi~cellaneous copying. S. D. Pendleton continued to make tho reductions of tlie tides of the western coast until August 1. The continuation of that work was put in the hands of F. R. Pendleton on the 15th of September. CoMPUTING DIV!SION.-Under the continued direction of Assistant Charles A. Sdwtt this division has kept up its usual efficiency. 'The force has been diminisheil by the discontinuance of the services of Mr. J. Wiessner. 'l'he computations of current work have nevertheless been kept up, and while some of the more refined adjustments of geodetic work have been postponed, the astronomical work has been kept up to date. The perfect organization and system of work in this division has allowed Mr. Schott time to render valuable services in other branches of the survey. Under instructions from the Superintendent, dated January 21, he commenced a trigonometrical survey of the fortifications of the District of' Columbia, both for heights and positions, in the last week of January, and completed the work before the close of May. Early in June, anrl again during the last week of that month, he wa~ engnged on magnetic t'urveys of certain iron vessels, and afterwards made magnetic observations in the State of Maine, under instructions from the Superintendent, dated June 20. The statistics of his :field-work are given elsewhere in this report. In the office he has computed and discussed the results of the experiments for length and expansion of the standard bar; submitted three reports on the magnetic survey of iron-clad vessels, and one on local deflections of the plumb line at astronomical stations in Sections I, II, Ill. All calls by observers for office information connected with this division have been attended to. The duplicates of records of the astronomical, geodetic and magnetic work of the survey are under hio immediate care, and numher 1,485 volumes, kept in 49 cases . ·~ detailed statement of the work done by each computer is herewith presented. A.·sistant Tlteodnre W. lVerner completed the computation of the new triangulation up the Connecticut river; supplied L. M. Z. computations to l\Ir. Ferguson's triangulation, near Washington, 1862 ; and made progress with the new triangulation on the sea-coast of Kew Jersey of 1861. He also prepared an abstract of the primary angles at stations Sandford and Mount Tom, 1862; completed the reduction of the triangulation eaet of' Mount Desert, 1860-'61-'62, by ~ir. \V cbber, and calculated the heights as far as data permitted; computed the triangulation of Assistant Boutelle, in the vicinity of East11ort, 1861, and that of Asllistant Greenwdl. of the island of San Clemente, 1860-'62. ]}Jr. Eugene 'f'ITulty reduced the transit observations at stationH Mount Torn and Sandford, and brought out tl1e iw;imuth and latitude for those places ; deduced the longitudes for some stations on the western coast from the observations of the solar eclipse of' May, 1854; and made progress with the computation of the triangulation of Penobscot bay by Assi8tant l\lcCorkle, in 1862. ll'Ir. James lrlain revised the time and azimuth computations at stations Azimuth Point, on Monterey bay, Point Hudson, Mount Tom, Sandford and Lummi island, and the latitude computations of stations Wachusett, Humboldt, Point Hudson, Lummi i8land, Mount Tom aud Sandford; introduced improved starplacea into the latitudes of Cape Florida and Sand key; made a preliminary reduction of longitudes of Coast Survey stations from observations of the solar eclipse of July, 1860; made a second computation of the magnetic observatiuns at Apalachicola, Eufaula, aud Barkley No. 2; attended to some miscellaneous magnetic and geodetic computations; and completed the reduction of the magnetic observations for horizontal force at Key '\Vest, from February, 1860, to date. He was on leave of absence during July. Dr. Gottlieb Rumpf attended to the preparation of the annual statistics of the geodetic work, to the insertion of the new geographical positions in the regi~ters, and to miscellaneous geodetic information required for the field parties; made an adjustment of the primary triangulation from Kent island to the moath of the Potomac, and of tlte triangulation of that river as far as Blakistone light; adjusted the geographical positions of Sections V and VI to a continuous series; computed Mr. Schott's observations for heights and position of the fortifications of the District of Columbia of 1863, and computed a new series of L. M. for points of the primary triangulation for a special investigation between Sections I and II. Mr. Jolin 1Viessner made progress with the least square adjustment of the primary triangulation, near the Epping base, and assisted on the adjustment of the Potomac triangulation, (upper part.) His services were discontinued on the 19th of November last. He had been connected with the computing division since January, 1853, and especially commended himself to this division by his mathematical acquirements, uniform industry, and close attention to business.

Mr. E. H. Courtenay attended to thfl clerical duty of the division, and supplied duplicates of original records, princjpally of work prior to 1843. He accompanied .Mr. Schott as recorder on his triangulation of the fortifications of the District, and on his magnetic survey in June and July in Section I. R. Freeman attended to the copying of the records of the geodetic survey. DRAWl~G DrVISIOJ\'.-This branch of the office has been under the immediate direction of the assistant iu charge, relieved at times by .Assi,;tant A. M. Harrii;on, when not engaged in field-work. :Much credit is due to the iutelligent zeal of l\fr. \V. 'l'. Bright, clerk of the division, in arranging the details of the work. The occupation of the several draughtsmen, whose number has i·emained the same as last year, is given below, followed by a synopsis of the ~cveral maps, charts, and sketches th11t have been worked u11on during the year. Seventy-five sheets haw' been in hand, of which forty-four are map,; and cl1arts of the regular series of public'ltion, twenty sketches or di~grams, and nine maps for lithographing. Assistant M. J. McClery has drawn the hill topography on pbotographed outlines of coast maps No. 7, 1\Iuscongus bay to Portlaml, Me., and No. l J, l'lymouth to Hyannis, l\1ass., on a scale of :rotroo· to be reduced by photography to that of sotrillf· He has also drawn the hill-work for the finished map of Barnstable harbor, l\Iass., scale 20 J 00 , and is now engaged in filling in the detailii upon a photographed outline of coast map No. 53, Rattlernake shoals to St. Helena sound, S. C., scale 80 00 · lJfr. E. Hergesheimer, as heretofore, ha,; bad charge of the preparation of tracings from plane-table sheets for the photographic reduction with generalized details adapted to the reduced scale, and in that department of the work has been engaged upon the following coast maps and charts of the regular so kin> series, viz: No. 7, Muscougus bay to Portland, l\Ie.; No. 8, Seguin island to Kennebunk Port, .Me.; No. 10, Cape Ann to Plymouth harbor, Mass.; Ko. 21, New York bay and harbor; No. 47, Bogue inlet to Barren inlet, N.

I., scale n><}00 , and has drawn a sketch of photographical signs for the use of plane-table parties. He has generally verified the engraved tol:Jography, arranged the general lettering for all the maps in process of engraving, and has been engaged upon diagrams, prnjections for field parties and projections on copper, and superintended the drawing of a map, on a scale of 10.;i. 00 , of the environs of St. Louis, Mo., for tlie military authorities. :From June to August Mr. Hergesheimer was in the field, engaged upon the special survey for defences at Philadelphia. Mr. A. Lindenkoltl has drawn the preliminary chart of part of the western coast of the United States, from Point Pinos to Bodega Ilead, including the Bay of San }~ranci8co, scale :r001000 ; continued the hydrography upon general coast chart :No. X, 8traits of" }'lorida, scale 400'tJ 00 , and that of' the topography of No. XIV P<'nsacola hay, to the Mississi11pi Delta, La.

E:"IG RA VIXG D1YI:ilO:"l.-This llivi8ion lias remained urn1er the charge of 'Mr. Edward \Vharton, assisted in clerical duties by Mr. G. J. Pinc.kard. The engraving of the regular series of maps and charts has made steady progress during the year, although prosecuted with a diminiHhed force. The number of engravers, whic11 was twenty-three during the preceding year, has been reduced to nineteen. A detailed statement of the occupation of each will be f~und below. '.rhe practice of engraving from photographic reductions of large scale drawings has been continued wiil1 increased satiofaction and success. The greater portion of the charts, and particularly those of' the series of finishPfl coast charts on 80 ~ 00 scale, are now engraved in that way. The system of engraving figures by means of punches, in place of cutting them with the graver, has been further perfected during the year, and has been fully adoptd for second-class charts, with a great reduction of expense. Of the maps accompanying this report, the series of" sailing charts" No. 18 to 23, and others, have had the soundings engl'aved in this way. Another advance in lessening the expense of engraving, by the application of mechanical means, bas been made in the use of a. pantograph of superior construction, adapted to engraving outlines upon copper on a reduced scale by direet copyiug from the drawing. During the year ending October, 1863, the engraving of the following finished maps and charts has been C')mpletecl, viz: PortlauJ harbor, M.e., 20 ~ 00 ; Dutch Island harbor, Narraganset bay, R. I., T~; coast chart No. <!6, Chesapeake bay, No. 6, from the bay entrance np to York river, soioo; coast chart No. 71, .Fl01·ic1a reefo, from New-found Harbor key to Boca Grande key, 8"oiio~i San Pablo bay, Gal.,

ELECTROTYPE

DIVISJON.-This branch of the work has been, as heretofore, conducted

by Mr. George ]}Iathiot, ably assisted by Mr. D. Hinkle until April, and since then by Mr. A. Zumhrock.
The application of the electrotype process to the duplication of the engraved plates, and to the formation of large-sized plates by joining the separately engraved parts, has been continued with the usual success. Thirty-two plates, of which twenty were "bassos" and twelve "altos," have been produced during the year. The use of photography for the reduction of the original surveys to the scales of publication has become a settled practice, and has been successfully employed throughout the past year. The acquisition of a new "globe" lens, of Harrison & Schnitzer's construction, affording a great amount of light, with sharp definition and geometrical correctness of image, has materially aided the success of our photographic operations. .A report of the tests to which it was subjected is given in .Appendix No. 11. Besides the reduction of maps and charts for engr_1tving in the office, the copying of maps for other branches of the public service has been part of the work in the photographic room in cases when the press of time or the limited number of copies required would not admit of the employment of the lithographic process. During the year forty-seven glass positives, one hundred and Etixty-eight glass negatives, and nine hundred and eleven paper prints, many of them of very large size, have been made from one hundred and thirty-eight different maps, drawings, &c. Of this number of subjects photographed, seventy-nine have belonged to the regular work of the office, and fifty-nine had reference to the military and naval operations of the government. The appended tables state iu detail the work performed iu this division.

LITHOGRAPHING DIVJSI01';.-The operations of this division have been conducted nnder the supervision of Pr<!f· F. A. P. Barnard since June, haviug been p1·cviom,ly in eliarge of JI.Ir. JV L XiciuJs n, wl10 with<lrew upon beiug appointed topogrnphcr in the General Post Office. llesidc8 directing th0 details of this and the miscellaneou,; <livision, 1\fr. Nichohon rendered valuable service by cnllectiug ancl supcrvioiug the compilation of materials for a map of the mountain region of N' orth Carolina and Tennessee, which hal' proved to be very useful to the armies in the field. Prof. Barnard gives the following summary of the operations for the year. Two lithographic presses brLYe been kept in constant operation throughout tlw year, and such has occasionally be>en the pre5sure on the division that it has been found necessary to employ other lithographic establishments in the execution of special jobs. During the first part of the year, tl1e printing was executed by JJ[r. D. B. ~'llorgan and .JJir. TValter Renner. JYlr. A. Brown subsequently took lUr. JYlorgan's place, and upon JJlr. Bl'Jmer's withdrawal in June, l1i;.; place was supplied by .Mr. James Rultl. J.l;Ir. C. G. Krebs has been employed throughout the year, as drn·ing; a eonFidera.hle portion of the preceding, in engraving 011 stone. He lias been assisted by lJir. H. Lindenlwlt1, detached from the drawing <livision from time to time for the purpose, both in engraving and drawing; and occasional aFsistimcP has been rendered in preparing autogra1ih transfer~ by 1Jlr. TV. B. JJldllurtrie and 1llr. J JV. )J]aedd, of the drawing division, and by lrir. E. ]}Io1itor and lllr. A. Iiausman, temporarily cmploy.:;d for the purpo~e. It appears from the records that there have been printed on the lit lwgrnphic pres~c~ belonging to this division twenty-eight thousand two hundred and twcnty-uiuc Bhects during tlw year. There han· becll nlso printed during the same time for the office ten thousand three hundred aud fifty-two 8beets by other lithographers, making the total production for the year thirty-eight thou8and fiye hundred and eighty-one Eheets. ln this total are included 80me maps for miliuuy purposes pn·pared or printed for the Engineer lJtJreau, a ·sketch of Gettysburg and the hospitals in the vicinity, engraved and printed for the Sanitary Cornmi~sion, a map showing the i~ogonic magnetic lines in the State of ]'enmyh·ania, a circular for tlie Secretary of the Trea1rnry, and several circulars and other foi-ms for the office of the ~utTey. The number of different bydrographic charts printed on stone rluriug the year has bPcn fifty-nine; the aggregate number of impressions taken of these amount,; to eleven thousand nine hundred and sixty-seven. 'The number of different maps and sketche~ which have been prepitred to illustrate the operations of the war is twenty-four. SeYeral of these maps have Leen issued in suc.ccssive editions, with such a<lditio1rn, improvements and corrections afl have been suggested by engiaeer ufficers sen·iug with the armies in tlH'. field, who lmve kindly and very freely communicated to the office of the survey such valuable information as their personal observations had enabled them to gather. ThP total number of impressions tak.eu of all these mrrpR and sketches amounts to seventef'lt thousand nine hundred and sixteen. In the case of nine or ten of the maps above nwntioncd, color 1winting ha~ heen cmployerl for the purpose of making the indication~ more distinct. This, while it has much improved tlw u~efolnes~ of tlie maps, has rendered their production more laborious and lees rapid than it would otherwi"e have been. Yery many copies have been eupplicd to officers of the army, who have found tlwm very servic('ablc in the field. Large numbers have also been called for by book.sellers, and have met with ready rnle in f,ur principal cities. The returns from this source have defrayed for the mo~t part the expense of production. The hydrographic notes or memoird of the coa~t have been kept up. Copies have been distributed among naval officers at< required, and others held in readiness to meet any new demand. In the summary appended will be found a stat.cmen~ of the priaci11al drawing,;, tran:sfers and engrnvingr; on stone which have been executed during the year.

The charge of the map-room has continued tl1rough the year in the hands of JYir . .ltl. T. Joltnstone, who hHR Rhown great Pfficie11cy in the management of the business. The copper-plate printing has Ul~en executed principally by l'ilr . .Tolin RutllcrdaTe, who for RPVPr:il years has had charge of this branch of inilustry, with the occasional assistance of 1llr. E. II. Sipe. The exigencies of the office have rendered it necesRary, however, during a conRiderabk portion of the time, to employ outside flssiRtance. 'l'liis has been furnished by llir. IIetiry Benner, of Washington. Mr. TV. 1lfertz continueu to be employPd in the preparation of b;1cked chart paper for plane-taule work and for hydrographic partieR; and also in joining eha1-ts, in repairing sheets in ll'!C), and other analogous occupations until September 1, when he withdrew, and was succeeded by 1J,Ir. G. TV: Frands. The total number of sheets printed by the copper-plate presses during the year has been sixteen thousand eight hundred and ninetHcn, (16,819.) lf to thi~ number we add thf' total production by the lithographic presses, (viz : 38,581 sl1eets,) we l'hall hav·~ an aggregate of 55,-100 ;;heets. Of this number, forty-five thousand seven lrnndred and :fifty-;icven, (45,757) have been il3sueu from the office, of whic!1 29,274 havP. been hydrographic charts, distributed as follows: To the navy ...........·................................·............

Of the charts distributed to the navy, 10,894 lmvc been distributed through the Naval Obsen·aLory. Under the general head "miscellaneous" arc included all those which have been sent to light-house engineers, inspectors, aud superintendents, on the requisition of the Light-house Boai d; all those required by Coast Survey assistants in the office or at their stations, or when accompanying naval or military expeditions; all those furnished to public libraries, Union leagues, and other useful or patriotic a.~sociations, and also the very considerable number called for by members of Congress. The remaining sheets distributed, six.teen thousand four hundred and eighty-three (16,483) in number, have been maps of the coast prepared for tbe immediate use of the blockading squadrons, or of commanders conducting military operations on the coast; maps of the most impmtant fields of operation of the armies in the interior, and sketches of more limited extent illustrating the operations of attack and defence of important points. In this number are not includcil the maps printed for the Engineer department, the Sanitary Commission, or any other branch of service not connected with the Uoast 8urvey. The total distribution falls about two thousand ;;}1eets short of that of tl1e preceding year, for which the report covered the period of thirteen months, and which was stated in thP annual report for that year to have been double that of the year ending November 1, 1861, and more than five timeR the average of formc>r year,;. In the report for that year the distinction between hytlrogrnp1ic charts and othe1· maps and s!.,..etches is not observed, and hence the number of these several classes distributed in each cannot be directly compared. It appears, however, that the demand for hydrographic charts during the year which has just closed has not been so great as in the year preceding, a circumstance arising from the fact that the number of additional vessels brought into the public service during the year has not been so great as in the former year, while those which have been alreauy impplied have for the most part continued to operate in the waters to which they were first assigned. Every new movement of the navy is, however, attended with demands for charts of particular portions of the coast to be supplied promptly and abundantly, and care is constantly taken to keep such a stock on hand of every important point on the coast of the Atlantic or of the Gulf Ril to meet any sudden requisition. The report of the superintendent of the Coast Survey for tl1e year 18Gl l1as been distributed to individuals and institutions in the loyal States only to the extent of 4,551 copies. In the month of ::\lay a foreign distribution of the report for lt.'59 and 1860 was made through the Smithsonian Institution, amount-

In the month of September there were also presented to the Imperial Royal Institute for 'Military Geography, at Vienna, through the Engineer Bureau of the United States, copies of all the reports of the Coast Survey from 1851 to 1861, inclusive. There remain on hand an aggregate number of 13,716 copies of the reports of all years. 'The numbers are quite unequal for different years, and of some of the early reports the stock is very nearly exhausted. At tl1e close of liis last annual report, the chief ~f this division states that a circular had been isrned to the principal public libraries in the United StateA, and to tl10se of universities, colleges, &c., inquiring into their deficiencies in regard to these reports, with a view of supplying them while it remained possible, in order that complete sets of these important record~ might be within reach in every part of the country. 'The responses to this circular have led to a considerable distribution of the earlier reports, so that, in respect at least to the loyal States, it is believed tbat the object aimed at has been secured. It gives me plcasme, in conclusion, to bear witness to the assiduity and attention to duty of the various employes in this branch of the service since it came under my supervision.

Carpenter slwp.-JYir. A. Yeatman stiil remains in charge of the shop, assisted by one workman and an apprentice. The work executed during the year consists of seventy-four rough packing-boxes for the transportation of instruments and records, thirty-eight fine cases and thirteen new stands for instruments, four new boards for plane-tables, one vat, fourteen frames, and twelve clamp clocks for the electrotype divi~ion, three large water-troughs, six printing frames and one large sash for photographic purposes, four paper-wetting boards for copper-plate printer, cornice and rollers for thirty-two maps, eight book and map cases, six frames for charts, four map stanrh, one large derrick for hobting lithographic stones from the basement to the printing rooms above, one andrometer, and two ilynamometers, and one hundred and twentyfive tin cases for holding original sheets of the survey liave been paintP,d and numbered. A large amount of miscellaneous work has been done, and the wood-work of instruments returned from the field have been carefully repaired.

N<>. I.
CAMBRIDGE, Noveml1£r 7, 1863. Sm: I have the honor to communicate Hie following report upon the observations of the occultations of the l'leiades of April 13, 1842, which I des~gnate as No. 1, because it is the last of the group of the Pleiades occultations, ( 1838-' 42.) The immersions were on the moon's dark limb, and were observed at Edinburgh by Professor Henderson. DEAR RECORD OF OBSERVATIONS.

The observations were made by Professor Henderson with the Sheepshanks Equatorial, and are published on page 273 of the Edinburgh Observations.

The latitudes ancl longitudes of the places are taken from a manuscript table which will be smt to the office at another time. It is sufficient, for the present, to state that the assumed longitude of the observatory of Washington is 5lz. 08m. 12s. lY. of Greenwich, to which all American positions are 1·eforred. The computations are contained in the accompanying sLr:ets marked B. P. 1-7, and C. S. P. 1-14, and they are partly in duplicate and partly in quadrnplicate.

REPORT OF DR. B. A. GOTTLD, ON THE COMPUTATIONS CONNECTED WITH OBSERVATIONS BY THE TELEGHAl'HIC METHOD FOR Dll'FERENCE OF LONGITUDE.

CnrnRIOGE, November, 1863. Sm: The work under my direction during the past year has been of the same character as during the year preceding, consbting in great mensure of computalions and reductions of the field-work of former years. The determinations of six differences of longitude have been completed, and the former reductions repeated, wherever the new and more accurate data now at our di~posal promised any apJ>reeiable improve· ment in the accuracy of the main result, or of any important collateral ones. The subsidiary resultii continue to offt:r new inducements to further research, and but for the smallness of the force a1 my drnposal many of the yet unexplained indications would have been further investigated. But my primary duty was manifestly to complete the definite determinations of longitude, and the greater part of our laLor h.3 Leen directed exclusively to this end.

The campaigns upon which the longitude work has been completed since my lust repoTt, or so thoroughly revised as to lead to the adoption of a new value for the results, are : "\Vilmington-C0lumhia; ColumhiaMacon; Macon-Montgomery; ]')fontgomery-Peach Tree; Peach TrPe-~r olJile; Mobile-New Orleans: so that only five campaigns now remain for discussion; from all of which provisional results wcrn long since attained. The reductions now in band will be c11iefly of a mechanical character, and but for the difficulties arising from our national troubles would have been long since completed. As the further proRecntion of the fieldwork seems not yet near at hand, I have felt justified in dire· ing some p rt;on of our time and effort to the preparation of a catalogue of standard declinations for the time star list, to accompany the investigation of Hight Ascensions, of which the fiual values were printed in 1862. It may perhaps be well to enumerate in tl1is place those determinations of differences of longitude made by my party which may fairly be regarded as final. They are as follows, the po:5itiou:; referred to being in all cases the astronomical stations of the Coast Survey :

During the Calais-Bangor campaign one nigbt was devoted to an exchange of i,tar-gignals with the observatory of the college at Fredericton. Only three stars were sati~factorily exchanged, but the obscrvatirms for determining the illBtrumental corrections at Calais were so full, and the positions ol" the iustruments at both places have been so carefully investigated, that I think the resultant longitude cannot he in errOl" Ly so much as two-tenths of a second, and that we may adopt the value :

night carries the western end of the axis southward. The exceptional cases are, however, HO incon><irlerali1c ~18 but little to modify my conviction of the generality of tl1e law, and this inference has received an interesting and important corroboration from the observations at the United States Naval Observatory. The Superintendent iuformR me that this motion, in the same direction, lias been found very manifest in the large meridian instruml~nts. And the reduction of the observations in former years, which has been made nuder my supervis:on, exhibits the same motion, both in the Transit instrument and in the murnl circle, to a markPd rlegree. A carf'ful scrutiny, moreover, of the published observations of the fate Professor Henderson, at Etliuhurgh, has led me to the conviction that irn·gularities, to which he freque11tly refers, were attriLutable to the same phenomenon. There is room for much further inquiry in the same direction, auJ I look forward with great interest to the oppmtunity of prosecuting the research. Those recent observations of stars in our standard Right Ascensions which have reached me during the year seem to warrant great confidence in the results, aud to show that the laLm expended on their preparation was not lost. The cases are very few where the discordance during the last year seems to have amounted to the tenth of a second; anrl for the prinei pal stars of the Tinw-Star Li8t, the agreement of observations with the computed place has be(!n very much closer. For some years to come it will probably lie difficult to improve the great majority of these Right Ascensions. The preparation of a list of <leclinatio.ts for the time-stars on the principles previously adopted in determining the Right Ascensions has been nearly complete<l since my last i·eport. The determination and discussion of the ;;ystematic corrections due to the several catalogues l1as been e8~e11tially completed, and the observations have been collected, ~crntinized and tabulated. Nothillg remains but to r<olve the equations of condition, the mechanical labor of wl1ich can be performed from time to time, as a relax:ition from the monotony of other routine work. In case of need, the remits coul<l be furui8het1 at shmt notice, bnt tl1e final solutions have been of late postponed for more pre8sing duties. Soon after tlie <late of my last rq)(}rt I had t11e mii;fortune to lose tile valuable a:d of Professor Searle wlrn was transferred to a wider field of usefulness at the l::nited States Kava] Academy. The loss of so excellent an assi~tant was no small drawback to the work in hand, and only the conviction that science might ultimately be the gainer recouciled me to parting with this gifted astronomer, whose whole scientific life had been passed in my immediate party. I have, however, to thank .M:r. Cleveland Alibe for as,;iduous, conscientious, and most serviceable aid, and during tl1c last two months have been assisted alw by Ur. vV. H.

PAitT VII· INVESTIGATION OF THE ELEVEN-YEAR PERIOD, AND OF THE DIS1THBANCES OF THE VERTICAL COMPONENT OF TUE MAGNETIC FOIWE, WITH A SlTPPLEMEKT ON THE EFFBCT OF AUH0UAL LIGHTS, BY A. D. BACHE, LL.D. [From the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.]

The observations of the vertical component of the magnetic force were commenced in June, 1840, and continued, with an exception in ,January, 1841, without intcnuption to the last of June, 18-!5. To keep np the continuity of the !'cries a £1aily reading was taken at 2h. 17m. p. m. during the months of January, February, and l'tlarch, 1843. lip to October, 1843, the observations were bi-hourly, afterwards hourly. ]'llstruments.-}'rom J urn;, 1840, to the end of the year, the observations were made with a balance vertical force magnetometer of Lloyrl's pattern. It was at first mounted in the ecLstern building of the college, but was removed to the observatory in the latter part of ,July. \Vhile in the coll"go an increase of the readings corres,ponds to a decrease of vertical force; nt the oliservato1y iuereasing readmgs denote increasing force. 'l'he instrument was made by Robinson, of London; the magnet, the axis of which was mounted as nearly as possil1le transversely to the magnetic meridian, was 12 inches in length, having at itB ends cross

wires set in copper rings. For a full description, see Dr. Lloyd'A account of the .:lbgnetical Observatory of Dublin, and the preface in volume I of the record of the Philadelphia observation~. ln January, 1841, the Lloyd instrument was replaced by a reflecting vertical force magnetometer, made at my suggc;tion by Mr. J. Saxton. The bar of this instrument was two feet and one inch in le11gth, two iudtc~ wide in the middle, one and a half ne1Lr the ends, tapering to 1wthing at the ends, and a quarter of an inch tl1il'.k. The magnet was of steel, and hardened as perfoctly as the maker coul<1 eff<~d. By uwan,; uf a ball modng on a fine scn~w, its eq uilibl'ium could be changed. The mirror projected outE<ide the Lox, an<1 the motion of the bar was ob~ervetl hy means of a telescope. At the top of the Lox was a piPce of plate g·lass, through which a thermometer (of Fraucis's make) could be read. For further pnrticulan: see p. YII of the prefac.e to YolumD I of the record. l'or some time (bc>tween three and four months) after being put up, the bar ]'.1st consit1emLly of its magnetic force, and after being in use for four months, a movement of the a<ljustiug ball upon the screw was require<1 for placing the readings again near the middle of the scale. By this ar1justment the seusiLility of the apparatus was not interfered with. The value of a scale division of the Lloyd iu.;trurnent, expres8ed in parts of the VCl'tical force, was carefully determined and found to be =0.0000165, both in the college builcling and at thr' observatory. 'l'his v11lue !wing kno"·n, I consider that the value of the scale of the new reflecting magnetometer could Lest be ascertained Ly eornpari~rm with the former. The n'sult of thi~, continued at intervah<, was that two divisions of the new scale were eqnivalcut to one of the old, or that a change of one r1ivi~ion of the Teflecting instrument concsponded to a change of vertical force of 0.0000:.l:.l parts. This was after the imstrument Lad been finally adjusted. 'l'hc only disadvanfogc in the new instrument was the large effect of changes of temperature upon it; by direct observations it was found that a chang" uf 1 ~ ( F.) of ternpemturp produced a corresponding change of 13.5::1::0.25 scale readings, wherea~ in the Lloyd inst1·umeut the correspornliug clrn1q;e was but 3.12 scale divisions. '\Ve have accordingly for tlw Lloyd instrumeut q=0.0000;)15, and for the reflecting instrument q=0.00044G. The values actually used in the reduction of the ob8erved reading to a standard temperature will be seen further on. The import;u1ce of ascertaining tlie mo~t correct am1 ~nitnh1c eodneients of tempei·ature for the two series of observations, demands a more detailed statement and ebLorat1~ di~cussion of the ohsr·rvationB themse1ves, independently of the special trial~. Experience has shown that the value for q tleduced from tlu~ diffcrentia1 intensity observations tbcmsdvcs, with the m:1gnet suliject gcnernl!y to gradual and small changes of temperature, is smaller by a considerable fraction than the \·alue found lly clirect aud Fpecial oLscrvation, during which the temperature changes arc neccssmily more violent. There is no doubt that iu the reduction to a staud1trd temperature, that value of q sl10uld be used which was obtained while the magnet was under its ordinary influoncefl an<1 condition. The same view is taken by Gencrnl Sabine, and waf' also carried out in the discussion of the horizontal component of the magnetic force; for which see the precedi11g paper (Part IV.)

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Before putting the reflecting vertical force magnetometer in its place in January, 1841, observations were made for its correction for temperature by means of deflections; the result, however, was not satisfactory, owing to the small difference in the deflections at high and low temperatures, and the necessity of keeping the bar at a proper distance from the declinometer to prevent the possibility of a permanent c11ange of magnetism. The weight of the mirror and otlier fixtures of the bar rendered the method of horizontal oscillations impracticable without their removal, and it was finally decided to determine the value of q by means of a subsidiary instrument kept at a uniform temperature in a separate building, while the vertical force instrument at the observatory was 1rnbject to considerable fluctuations of temperature. The subsidiary instrument consisted of a small dipping needle mounted on a knife-edge, and rendered horizontal by weighting it. The indications, however, did not prove very satisfactory; 14 scale divisions were indicated as the correction for 1"' change in temperature. Subsequently an inclinometer, according to Prof. Lloyd's plan, was mounted as a subsidiary instrument, and observed twice a day with the vertical force inst.rument at the observatory. The mean values, expressed in scale divisions, thus found between February, 1843, and January, 1844, are a,; follows: 13.3 14.3 14.4 12.3 12.2 13.l a.ml 15.4. Average value 13.56::1::0.25. In the first reduction the value 13.5 was used. (B.) Investigation of the temperature coefficient from the regular Eeries of observations. We will first examine the principal series obgerved between 1841 (February) and 1845 (J unc,) with the reflecting magnetometer. In J<'ebruary, l\Iareh, April, and J\fay, l 841, the readings gradually increased and approached the end of the scale, n'quiring a readjustment of the instrument after ;\:fay 22. It was supposed that-529 scale divi;<ions would be an approximate correction for referring the observations to the indications of the scale subsequent to :May 22, the uninterrupted sc1·ies of. observations commencing with June 1, 1841. 'l'he following table contains the uncorrected monthly means of the vertical force magnetometer, together with the observed mean mouthly temperature, taken directly from the record. The tabular means for January, :B'ebruary, and :March, 1843, 'when the im;trument was read only once a day (at 2li. 17m. p. m.,) were obtained as follows: 'l'he difference between the daily mean and the mean at 21t. 17m. p. m. was ascertained for each month, from t11e records of the preceding year ( 1842) and the following year ( 1844.) The mean correction to the average reading at 2h. 17m. p. m., to refer tlie same to the mean of the day and month, is+ 18.6, +I-1.4, and + 11.2 scale divisions for the months of January, February, and 111arch, ref'lpectively. These corrections have b. en applied. TABLE I.

The scall~ \'aluc 1.: at Toronto i:< 0.0000628, ne:uly twice as large as at Philadelphia. The comparatively large value for 'I. at Philar1el1ihin i, moKt prnba1Jly dne to the large size of the bar, which prevents a thorough liar<leniug-a circum:<ta11cl~ which umlnnl1teL1ly alw contributes to the difference exhibited hy the resulting value of q as found by tl1c direct and indin·ct rrwtl10d~. 'l'he magnitude of tl1e temperature coefficient requires that. the standard temperature should lie tl1e mean ternpPrature at all tlie n~a<lings. 'I'lw nvernge temperature between February, 1841, and June, 184.5, is 66°.0, which has heen adopted as tho standard temperature to which all the vertical force readings, taken with the reflecting magnetometer, have been i·efoITed. A close examination of the record of the Lloyd balance magnetometer, w11icb wus used in June and ,July, 1840, in the College, and afterwardR at the Observatory during five months, proved that in point of accuracy it would not compete with the reflecting magnetomlctcr mounted in January, 1841, nnd continued in use for four years and a half. Owing to some imperfection in the first-named instrument, its indications were very unsteady, and at times fitfully clrnngoablc; thus in September, October, and December, there arc differences in the d11ily means (deduced from tweh·e l"eadings and referred to 32° Fahrenheit) of adjacent days of more than 200 sc~alc divi,;ions, and iu one instance, (October 19-20,) amounti11g even to 256 divisions. In .August there is a change of 389 scnlc divi~irms in three consecutive days, and in October, (17th to tlie 20th,) one of 477 divisions iu the mf>uns dming the rnme interval. 'l'l1cre is, besides, a large progressive change, showing that the instrument. wa8 in a very unst11Lle equilibrium; tl1is change amounted in thn first month to over 30(1 scale divi8ions. .An attempt was alM made to deduce a temperature coefficient by compadng mean daily readings of short and specially ~elected periods of a few <lays each, with average high and low temperatures, but it failed for want of sufficient uuiformity in the indicatiom of the instrument: In such a series the disturbed indications could not be recognized and separated from the regular readings. It was finally concluded to make no use of the observations prior to .January, 1841. ·

Redur:tion ef the observations, between February, 1841, and June, 184D, to a uniform temperature.-A table has been constructed, with the observed temperature as the argument, ,(j"idng the reduction for difference of temperature from the normal temperature (66° Fahr.); by means of thi,: table eac11 obsPrvation has 11een
referred to its corresponding value as the standard temperature. Talile X 0. 2 contains the monthly mean readings for eacl1 oh~erving hour; the time is local time, and recko1wd from midnight to mirlnig·ht to 24 hours. 'l'he tenths in thie record have been omitted, as of no special value, since rm error in the recordctl t<·rnperature of only O".l a±focts the rrntgnet.ometcr reading by more than a scale divi~ion. An incr,,aB(' of scale readings corresponds to a decrease of vertieal force, aud one did~ion equals 0.000033 parts of the force. Accidental irregularities in the record arn specially referred to in foot-note;;. The tabular values are directly taken from the manuscript tables containing the siugle reduced readings, and their monthly mean;;. In the present state of our kuow1edge regarding tLe occurreuce of the <li~turhancP~, it is not safe to make any interpolations in the magnetometer record in ca,,;e of an accidental owis~iou; a rule which has been strictly adhered to.

The monthly mean for January, February, and Mrtrch, 1843, was obtained by adding 14, 10, and 8 divisions to the readings at 14h. 7m., reRpectively. 1hese corrections were found by comparisons in 1842 and 1844.

Correr:tions for prngrcuivc and irregular ckanges.-'I1 he difficulty of fully eliminating all effects of changes of temperatUl'e and adjustment, particnlarly dm·ing the first year, ( 1841 ), demandea the application of a Hecom1ary process analogous to that usPd in the reduction of the horizontal force for progressive change. The progreHt!ive change in the readingR of the vertical force is less decided and more iluctnating than in the horizo11t<1l furce. llnlf-monthly menns, and in Rpccial cases, means of even less periods of time, have been tak·~n and were comparer! with the monthly mean; the d.ffercnces were appl.ed either progressively (increaoing or diminishing) or a:; constants, as the casf) ~cemed to rlem:uul. SP\-enteen mouthi' required no sucl1 correction, ana in many months it was applied very sparingly. The proct'8S lean·s the diun111\ Ytu-iation, rehttively, undioturbed, and prepares the series for the applica· tiou of l\·irc"'~ Uritniou fi·r the reeognit iou of the dioturbance.,.

the following Ol'der: July Oh., August 2k., September 4k., October 6h., Novembel' 8'1.. , December lOk., January, ( 1842,j 12lt., etc. The odd hours were selected from July, 1844, to the close of the series, thus: July lh., August 3h,., September 5lt., etc. The following limits of eeparatiou, iu scale divisions, have been found for each year: .,July, 1841-Junc, 1842, limit, 52 184:d1843, 46 184:J1844, 40 18H1815, 33 Arnrage limit, 43

As this limit would only separate one in every 34 oL~crvntirms, and wrmlil not fnrni~h a imfficient number of disturbance~ to investigate their laws to ac1vautage, it wa,; nec;·ssary to eon tract thr· ahovp limir, and 30 Reale divisions were finally ~eledcc1. Th..,re can be no doubt that the limiting number as founil Ly the URI' of the criterion is too high, owing to the unavoidable preo;ence of irregularities ascribable to imperfection in the currccLions for temperature in some cases, and in others duC' to a11par·.·ntly fitful changf~~ in tlH' instrument. 30 scale divi~ion =0.00099 parts of the vertical force =0.0127 1 iu absolute measure, adopwd a~ limit of tlevia· tion of any ob15ervation from it~ conesponc1iug mean monthly value for the same hour, will furnish an average value for the ratio of the number of disturbanceR to thew hole number of obscrvatiom3. The ratio of a di~turbauce to the whole force is also nearly the same for the horizontal and vertical component. AU deviations over :>O divisions from the mean were marked, and a new mean wa~ taken; the hourly observatious were again compared with this new mean, and the process was repeated, if' uecessary, until all deviations above 30 had been separated; the final hourly means fo1· each month, thus found and known as the "normals," are given in the following taLles:

The normals for 1''t>brunry, March, April, and l\fay, have been diminislwc1 by 198, 278, 333, and 361 scale divisions respectively; the uncorrected monthly mean,; are 856, 9:JG, 99 l, auil 1019, which cau be exactly represented by the expression r= 966 + 54.4 6.t-12.8 612 , where r = monthly reiiding, and t, exp1·e~sed in units of a month, counti; from Ap1·il l 11.s the epoch. It shows that the monthly increaF<c i>' uniformly retarded. The mean reading from the four succeeding mouths is 658; the corrections to .February, March, April, and I'l'fay, as applied, will produce the same mean. The rapid change in the monthly means for 8ome adjacent m·Jnths makes a small correction necessary to the monthly mean~. viz: of plus one scale division to the .February, )larch, anu December meanR of thl'

The epochs are given to the nearest quarter of an hour.

The cun·eR exhibit al~n a differencto in the amplitud<·; at Toronto, Vol. III, the diurnal rang(· is 0.00019 parts, wherem; at l'hiladdphia we found it much larger. 'l'he special study of the solar-diurnal variation of the vertical force is re~erved for Part YIII. The minimum diurnal i·ange occurred in 1842-' 43; on the average, therefore, we m11y assume l'1[11y, 1843. as the epoch of the minimum range in the e.leven (or ten) year period, resnlting from the discussion of the declination, horizontal, anrl vertical forC'e observations.

This seems to indicate the end of the year 1844 as tl1e epoch of the minimum numhPr of disturbances · in the eleven year period, taking the numbers collectively for declination, horizontal and vertical force; the minimum probably took place in the spring of 1844. If we take the monthly aggregate amount of the disturbances, all referred to a uniform series of bihourly observations, and form a table of these values for each year (Table VIII,) the mean aggregate amount for each year is as follows :

ThiP again points to the end of the year 1844 for the <'poch of the minimum amount of disturbances; ana comi<le1·ing the three clemc11ts, declination, horizontal, and vertical force, the spring of 1844 might be assumed a~ the time of the minimum magnitude of the mag1wtic disturbances.

The months of nrnximnm diRturbance are :M:areh and September, (the higl1 value in January and the low one in October apJJcm· anomalou8, and would no doubt disappear in a longer series of observations.) The minimum occurs in June; there is 110 well-expressed 1<econd minimum, (Sketch No. 30.) The horizontal force and declination ratios, as well as the ratios of the tlnee elements at Toronto, give the maximum number of disturbances at the Pqninoxes and tllf' minimum number at the sohtices; and as the winter solstice minimum only is wanting in the l'hiladelphia vertical force ratios, it is prnhalily rlne to the small number of observations, and the diffin1lty in keeping tlw instrument in adj11,-trneut and allowing for its irregularities. I have, tlicrefore, gi\-en the mean ratio of the Philadelphia disturbances in the last column of Table VII, and comcomparetl tlw result, graphically, with those deduced by General Sabine for Torcmto.* If WC HPparnt1; the distm·bances into two parts, tlH>i:<C increasing aua those decreasing the force, we obtain the 1mrnhPr,,of Tahlc VIII. A positive sign indicates disturbances increasing, a nc>gative sign those decreasing the vertical force. 'l'he law of the annual variation seems to be the same ai:t shown by the ratios iu ti 1e last two column~; this accords with the rrn!nlt at Toronto.

'l'he magnitudes of the disturbances, as before, do not appear to follow any law. The disturbances which incmase the force prepumlerate over those which decrease it; the ratio of the annual means i8 1.3 to 1.0. At Toronto tlie reverse was found; the disturbances which decrease the force preponderate over those whicl1 increase it, in the ratio of 1.4 to LO. JJiurnal inequality ef the disturbances.-In the bi-h<Jurly combination of the disturbances we make use of the series of observations extending from February, 1841, to June, 1845, omitting only the single.daily observation in January, :February, and March, 1843.

The greatest number of disturbances occur about Oli. a. m., (at Toronto at 3 a. m.,) with the least number at 10 a. m., (at Toronto at 11 a. m.;) the secondary maximum and minimum occur about 2 p. m. and 7 p. m., (at Toronto the hour~ are 5 p. m. and 9 p. m.) On the average, therefore, tl1c maxima and minima occur llt. 40m. earlier at Philadelphia than at Toronto. At neither station do tlw t.hre;' el1emm1ts ~lurn· the same law; they agree ouly in so far as to exl1il1it a Hystematic increase and dPcrease with the solar hom·s, and in having two maxima and two minima.

The laws which regulate the diurnal occurrence of the number of disturbances, increasing and decreasing the vertical force, are evidently not the same, yet they are by no means the converse of one another, as has been found to be the case in the disturbances of the declination and the horizontal force. At Toronto, also, where the horizontal force and declination curves were exactly opposed, t11at of the vertical force is not Ro, and at Philadelphia rather favors an agreement between the increasing and decreasing disturt>anc!!s than an opposition. Principal maximum of increasing disturbances ~ p. m., principal minimum 9 a. m., (at Toronto 5 p. m. and 5 a. m., respectively.) Secondary maximum at midnight; this may possibly be the principal maximum; .secondary minimum at 8 p. m. Principal maximum of decreasing disturbances 4 a. m., principal minimum 8 p. m., (at Toronto 3. a. m. and 6 p. m., respectively.) The secondary maximum at. noon is less distinctly marked; secondary minimum at 8 a. m. Thus the epochs of the curves for increasing and decreasing force seem to be 12 hours apart.

'I'he magnitude of the disturbances, either increasing or decreasing the force, apparently does not vary with the hours of the day. 'I'he disturbances which increase the force preponderate between tbe hours 2 p. m. and 2 a. m.; those which decrease the same occur in the other half of the day. The average ratio of the preponderance of increase over decrnal!e is as 4 to 1.

The action on the dee1ination magnet appears to be that of alternate deflections either way from the normal position; in five cases the deflection wa~ west; in two cases east; more frequently there were one or two successions of west and east deflections (or the reverse); in one instance even three; these alternate excursions appear to be a characteristic sign. In five cases the tendency of the deflection was easterly, in six cases westerly, and in the remaining eight cases in both directions. 'l'he average amount of deflection is 17'. 1-Vith but one exception the uniform effect upon the horizontal force was to decrease it. In the exceptional ca.se a decrease followed the increase; in another case the reverse took place; during one aurora there was at first a fall in the force, then a rise, and again a fall. The average depression of the horizontal force below the normal value was 0.005 parts of the force, (0.021 in absolute measure). The effect upon the vertical force is small; in nine cases no disturbance occurred; in general the force is less than the normal; tl1ere are two exceptions to this in the 13 eases. The average depl'ession of the vertical force below its normal was 0.0007 parts of the force (0.009 in absolute measure). or, irrespective of sign, 0.0013 parts of the force. If we wish to compare the tabular differences in declination and horizontal and vertical force with the magnitude of the recognized disturbances, the latter a.re 41 and 0.001 (parts of the force) for either the horizontal or vertical component. Of the auroras noted that of May 29, 1840, was in many respects the most remarkable, and the best observed both as to its appearance and as to its magnetic effect; its study can be recommended to those who have occasion to test their theoretical views in reference to this phenomenon, and to terrestrial magnetism. Its appearance at New Haven, Conn., has been described by E. C. Herrick, (Sill. Jour., 1840, Vol. XXXIX, p. 194). It was seen over a great portion of the United States, in Canada, and England. Sec, a.lso, description in the volume of the TorontCJlt observations; also an extract from the proceedings of the British .Association, (Sill. .Tour., Vol. XL, p. 337); also (p. 338, ibid.) Il()te on the same by the astronomer royal.

The total number of auroras which occurred at Philadelphia was much greater than the number given above, as has already been stated. At Toronto the annual distribution of the phenomenon over the same period of time, and for three years beyond the close of the record at Philadelphia, is as fo1lows: In " '' " " " "

These figures seem to indicate the exiBtence of" a period of frequency, probably of eleven yeai·s, as conjectured by Prof. vVolf; the least number probably occurrecl in 1843, if we make an allowance for inviRihility of the phenomenon either by daylight or by cloudy weather. Between June, 1840, and July, 1845, (inclusive,) there were seen, according to the Toronto record, 109 auroras. The dietmbauces at Philadelphia on the dates of their appearauce have been classified as follows: The numbers give the rclativo proportion to the total number, which latter is expressed by 100; the aYerage numbers are given resulting from the examination of the disturbances of the declination, the horizontal and the vertical force.

The number of unusual disturbances is, therefore, less than one-fifth of the total amount and in fully ouehalf of the cases the magnetic elements were either not at all or but very slightly affected.

APPENDIX No. 20.
DISCl.TSSION OF THE MAGNETIC AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS }fADE AT THE GIRARD COLLEGE OBSERVATOBY, PHILADELPHIA, IN 184ll, 1841, 1842, 1843, 1844 AKD 1845.-PAHT YIU. IXYESTIGATION O:F THE 80LAR-DIURJ\AL YARJATION AXD OF THE ANNl-AL TRREGl,,AHrry OF THE YERTlC.AL COl-fPONENT O.F THE MAGNETIC FORCE.-BY .A. D. BACHE, LL.D.
("From the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledgt>.)

THE necessary data for this investigation are given in the preceding part (YI!), which contain~ thP normals resulting from the reduction of the obi:;ervations to the same tPmperature (66° Fab.), from tl1e allow:mce for irregularity in the progreseive change, and the. ex!'.IUP.ion of all rccognizeil clisturliances. Owing to the greater irregularity in the indications of the vertica1 force instrument., and the comparatively small number of observations at oild hom·s, the normals are giYl'll for the !'Ven 110urs only; till' observations at odd hours, l10wever, are used to improve those taken at the intermediate even hours by means of a suit.able process of interpolation. The tabular ·numbers are expresged in scale diYi!'ions-one diYi~ion bPing equal to 0 000033 parts of tlu: nrtical force, or equal to 0.000423 in absolute mea~nrP. Increasi11g numbers denote decrea~c of forl'f'. The hours count from midnight to midnight to 24 hours ; the number of minutes the obsen-atious are made latPr than the full hour are given in the last eolumn fo1· each month.

Annual inequality in the diurnal rariuti.on (if tli.e nertir·aT .fr1n·e.-If we examine the average curve of the diurnal variation as observed throughout the year, and shown ou diagram A, (~ketch No. 30,) by a foll black line, we find the principal maximum value about 1 P- rn., and the principal minimum value about !J~ 11. m.; besides these characteristic values there is an indication of a secondary maximum about 2 a. m., and of a secondary minimum about 4 a. m. Dividing the year into rt summer and winter sPason, tliP dir1gram exhibits the diurnal Yariation in summer to be It curve of but one maximum and one minimum, occurring 11liout. noon and midnight, re~pectively; whereas in winter the double feature of the curve becomes very conspicunuH, the secondary maximum and minimum occurring about 2 and 6 a. m., respectively. The pheuomenou, in the two seasons, changes, therefore, from a single to a double crested curve.

Tht next diagram E (Sketch Xo. 30) exhibits the general feature of the diurnal inequality for the year and its summer and winter sea:o"on, as computed liy means of the preceding formula). The greatest difference between the olrnerved and compute9 values at any one l1our is but 2?1 sc'.lle divisions at 2 a. rn. in the winter season, and 11 divi~ion~ at t.he same hour in the annual curve. The absence of the secondary wave in the early morning hours dming summfl is as conspicuous as its presence in the winter season; in the annual curve there is barely a trace of it left. 'Ve also recognize again the earlier occurrence of the maximum and minimum values in winter and their later appearance in summer. If we examine the resulting curves at Toronto* we fiud there the secondary moruing fluctuation equally well marked in summer and winter; and if we inquire into this feature for each year separately, we find great irregularities between the hours 14 (Toronto astronomical time) and 22 ;. in 1843 the secondary maximum and minimum is plainly devdopecl; in 1844, and especially in 1845, it cannot be traced. Diagram J<' (Sketch No. 30) exhibits the curves for Philadelphia for each year. In 1841 and 1842 the curves_.are smooth, in 1843 the wave appears well marki<d. in 1844 it is just perceptible. These apparent irregularities are probably due to imperfections in our instruments; on the other hand, if we take the Philadelphia series, there may be a cyclic appearance and disappearance of this waYe. 'l'able YII exhibits the computed times of the principal maximum and minimum of the vertical force, together with tho amount of difference from its average daily value at these epoch!', expressed in scale divisions; al:;o the time and amount of the early moruing seconda1·y fluctuation traceable only in the winter months ; for these lust values the diagrams have Leen made u~e of.

'l'he extreme variation in the time of the maximum in the course of a year is 31' ism, and of the minimum 4h 11m. At Toronto the occurrence of the maxima and minima is later than at Philadelphia; from Table LXVIII, Vol. III of the Toronto Observations, we find the maximum at 5h, a secondary minimum at 141t, a secondary maximum at 1811 , and the minimum at 22h; the maximum is therefore apparently delayed at Toronto 4\ the minimum 4jp'. the secondary wave is likewise retarded by about 4 hours. This epochal difference I take, most likely, to be a distinctive feature due to the localities; there is also a remarkable difference in the amount of the diurnal range, as will presently appear. The degree of sensibility in the adjustment of the centre of gravity of the instrument affects most the latter difference, whereas the epochal difference may be supposed to depend, in a measure. upon the sensibility of the magnet in regard to changes of temperature and consequent changes of magnetism. The change in the adopted value of the correction for 1° of change in the temperature (expressed in. cale divisions) as used in present reduction ( 10.8), and as used in four volumes of record and reduction (13.5) 8 gives us the means of a partial test of the effect on the epochs : we find from the plates in Vol. IV the time of the maximum 1~ Jl. m. and of the minimum 11! p. m., which, though somewhat neare; to the Toronto epochs, still leave a large discrepancy.

'l'he diurnal range at Toronto is very much less than at Philadelpl1ia; in 1841-'42 the range was but one-half of that observed at Philadelphia, and forlater years (see 'l'able LXVIII of Vol. III of the Toronto ObservationR) the ranges compare as follows: Toronto 0.00019, Philadelphia 0.00071. In diagram G (Sketch No. 30} the diurnal range for each month is exhibited (expressed in parts of the force.) Table IX contains the times wl1en the mean value of the vertical force is reached each day, arranged for monthly averages. In some months the average daily value is attained four times, but generally only twice.

A graphical representation of the above tabular numbers is given in diagram H, (Sketch ~o. 30,) based upon the three variables: the hour of the day, the month, and the difference of vertical force from the normal monthly value. The contour lines of the magnetic surface differ 0.001 of vertical force (in absolute measure.)

Annual inequality ef tlLe vertirnl farce.-The minor and irregular disturbances in the adjustment of the magnetometer, as well as the effect of the progreso;ive and Sf\cular changeH, tend to mnke tlw determination of the annual inequality in the vertical force a task of some delicacy, and the results deduceu from our series of observations should be consiuered as approximate. Taking the monthly normals of the years 1842, 1843, and 1844, tlic only years which could be made complete, and correcting the monthly means for 42 scale divisions of annual increase, the following table was formed:

DISCUSSION OF THE MAGNETIC AND :METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS MADE AT THE GIRARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY, PHILADELPHIA., IN 1840, 1841, 1842, 1843, 18H, AND 1845. PART IX, INVESTIGATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOON ON THE MAGNETIC VERTICAL FORCE. BY A. D. BACHE, L.L. D., SUPERINTENDENT UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

The method of discussion of the lunar effect on the vertical component of the magnetic force in no way differs from that employed for the horizontal component, which latter has been explained in Part VI. The series of observations available for the lunar discussion extends frov:i February, 1841, to June, lSM». inclusive. From February, 1841, to October, 1843, the obse1·vations are bi-hourly; from October, 1843, to the end of the series they are hourly. 'rhe record of May, 1841, is not quite complete, and in January· li'ebruary, and March, 1843, but one observation a day is l'ecorded. As increasing numbers denote a decrease of force, a positive sign of the tabulated differences between monthly normals and each individual undisturbed reading (at the normal temperature) indicates a greater force than the normal value, a negative sign indicates the reverse. 30 scale divieions being the limit beyoud which difference au observation has been considered as belonging to the class of disturbances, all differences here recorded are below tl1is limit. One scale division is 0.000033 parts of the force. The tabular numbers arc expressed in scale divisions. In tracing out the lunal' effect upon the vertical force, we have to contend with greater irregularities than was experienced in the case of the horizontal force. The vertical force magnetometer is more subject to changes, and the correction for temperature far exceeds that of the horizontal force. The total number of observations and differences formed in the inquiry of the dependence of the force upon the moon's hour angle is 19513, which distribute themselves over the months and years as follows: 'l'ABLE I.

Before we combine the above results of years and parts of years, it is dcsirnbk to inquire into tLe -variability of the lunar effect in summex mid winter. Considering the months from April to Scpt('mber (inclusive) as summer months, and those from Octobe1· io Marcl1 (h1cluEiYe) as winter months, and combining the differences from the monthly normals in each year iwconling to the umnher of obocrvations, we obtain the following resultii : -

These numbers are sufficiently inegular to indicate that we cannot hope to deduce any separate results for the seasons, tlie number of observationF (about 0800) being altogdher iusufficient. We can, the1·efore, in our general combination of tl1P annual nwanF, give Prprnl wPight to the results from the six months of hourly obf'ervationF in 1845, and to the re~ult~ from the twdve m011ths of bi-hourly observations in 1842; compared with these results, those of 1844 haYe the weight two.

If we re111·eRent tl1ese values graphically, we find the general shape of the curve to be similar to tl1at of the horizontal component; it is double crested, with a principal maximum a little before the upper culmination, and a priucipal minimum about 3~ hours after the Im.Yer culmination of the moon; the average epoch of the Vl'rt.ical force tide is, therefore, about one and a half lionr apparently in advance of the culminations. The seconclnry wm·e fa very fed1le, its greatest vallle happens about 9.i., western hour angle, and its least value about three hours hefore, giving a raugP of nearly one-tenth part of the pri1~cipal rnnge. The observed values for the hours 8, 9, 10 (west), however, seem to indicate that tl1e s<:condary wave is really lai-ger, but in the present ease apparently reduced by the accidentally low values at the hours l l and 12. The following expression has been deduced to express the lunar-diurnal Yariation of the vertical force:V <1~-0.04 +0.27 sin ( 0 + 72°) + 0.20 sin (211 + 134 °) 0 counts from the upper cl1lmination, westward; Ver is expressed in scale divisions.

This range is so small that the correction for temperature due to a change of but 0°.08 would surpass it. "\Ve have already seen that we cannot bring a suffici<:nt number of ob' rvations to bear upon any part of the entire series, and am therefore not in a cond1tion to pnrnue thi;; ;.ut.ject of :·1e lunar effc,ct to any gre;1ter length. At Toronto tl1e curve is also rloublr,-crcstnil with maxima th1·cl' and :1 half hour~ after the moon'~ transit~, but compared with Philadelphia the principal and secoudm-y waves appear exclrnnged. The range at Toronto is 0.000012 parts of the force, nearly one half of the Philadelphia range; we ha vu alreaoly noticed a similar difference of range in the solar-diurnal vaTiatiou, the Toronto range of which was also ahout one-half of that at Philadelphia.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Th<' numbers in column 2 arc deduced from observations between 1841 and 1845, those in column 3 from observations between 1840 and 1845; the difference, however, is immaterial as far as it refers to the dip and total force, the lunar variations being the same for a few adjacent years. The total number of observations employed in tlie combination is 41558. 'I'he lunar-diurnal variation i" the dip is well represented by the formula, O<r = - O".t'G + 0"-85 sin (0 + 1;)6°) + 1 11.30 sin (20+ 206'); t11e corre;:ponding curve, as well as the obRerved values, me exhibited in diagrnm B (Sketch No. 30.)

REPORT ON PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS MADE RY ASSISTANT GEOHGE W. DEAN TO DETERMINE THE Y ARIATIONS OF "INDUCTION TIME'" IN RELAY MAGNETS NOW IN USE.
FALL RIVER, :MAss.,

April 29, 18G3.

DEAR Srn: The results of the experiments which I have recently made at the Coast Survey Office with

several relay magnets, indicate tlmt the telegraphic instrumc:ute now in gencrnl use are not constructed in accordance with any defiuite rules. Two of the relay magnets were each 2}-/r inches in length, and inch in diameter, with 2,200 feet, or 0.4 of a mile of No. 30 copper wire, 0.015 inches in diameter. The results obtained for "induction time" in the first-named magnets varied from 0."02 to 0."06, while the "induction time" in the latter varied from 0.'06 to 0."16, the size of the battery being the same in both cases. These results appear to indicate that the relay magnets would be improved by constructing them of minimum length and diameter, and further experiments will enabll; us to judge within what limits we may expect to obtain the mrnit satisfactory reRults. As you arc also informed, Prof. Henry lms suggested that, perhaps, the "induction time" might he diminishcJ by making the cores of the l1clices of the best iron 1vire of small size, each wire being insul11teJ by a coating of vm=nish or silk covering. :My plans having met your approval, I have arranged with Mr. Hicks, the inventor of the "Hicks Repeater," for the construction of one of these instruments, with rnoclifications which have been suggested by the experiments thus far made. I propose to lrnvc one relay constructed, with two small bcliccs, each about 1 !f inch in kn gt h and 1! inch in diameter. One of these helices to be adjusted abol'<' the armature axis, the other to be at an equal distance below the axis, and upon the opposite side of the armatnrc from the first-named helix. It seems to me that, by this arrangement, we shall obtain a maximum tensioll upon the armature, with a minimum int<'nf'ity and rcsistanc<' iu the coilR; but further experiments must ~how how far this opi11icm is well founded. I have also authorized l\Ir. Hicks to have two extra helices constructed for further experiments. One to be 2!! inches in length, ljf inch in diameter, and the copper wire, No. 30, ( 0.015 inches in diameter.) The other coil to be similar, except that the wire is to be a little larger, (0.020 inches in diameter.) The wire upon each coil is to be accurately measured and arranged in sections of six layer~ each, the ends of the several seetion wires to project at one end of the helix for the purpose of cletcrmining the relative force of the magnet by increasing or diminishing the size of the coils. Several helix cores are to be made of small annealed iron wire, in accordance with the plan suggested by Prof. Henry. At the earliest opportunity, after these instruments shall have been constructed, I vropose to proceed to the Coast Survey Office and test the several helices in the following manner: · 1st. '.ro ascertain the intensity of the current through each coil with a galvanometer. 2d. '.ro determine the force (magnetic) by adjttstiug each helix in a vertical position, and from the armature below suspend a small vessel, into which water 1rn1y be poured until itA W(~ight sh:1!1 he just sufficient to break the armature contact. 'l'he exact wcig11t of the ve~sel and water to be ascertained upon a delicate balance, which I hope to obtain for thi,; purpose from the office of weights and measures. 3d. 'l'he "induction time" of each helix to be determined with the Kessel clock, and the apparatus which has already been constructed and successfully useJ for this purpose. Very respectfolly submitted,

Sm: I have tlw honor to submit the following report of t11e examination made of Harrison's and Scbnitzer's "Globe Lens," prerious to its purclrnse by thi~ office. 'The want of a lens which would in dull weather produce good negativPs of a size approaching twenty-four iuches Rquare, without sensilile distortion, had been seriously felt dnring tlie past year. It was elaimed tlrnt a globe lens of the largest class-fom· inches diameter and sixteen ind1es solar focm;-wonld in a great degree satii!fy those requirements; and the Harri~on Leus Company agreed to furnish one for trial. In riew of the higli price of two hundred dollars demanded, it wai; deellletl proper to have the most stringest tests of its performance before making the purchase. The lens received is formed of two achromactic meniscuses, each a little over four inches in diameterthcir conYex sides turned from eacl1 other, and measuring six iuches from front to back; the surfaces apparently forming the segments of a globe of that diameter. The solar focus of the combination measures sixteen inches from tl1e b11ck lens. Between the two lenses is a revolving diaphragm, containing five openings, the ~mallest openi11g being three-eighths of an inch in diameter, and the largest seven-eigliths. Tlw advantage of this lens in light was immediately made manifest by its producing very dense negatives in copying line drawings within doors in very dull and hazy weather. Under such cir.·.umstances a map nearly a cPntury old, the paper of which hatl turned quite yellow, produced a perfectly satisfactory negative, which printed a full black line on a white ground, presenting a surprising renovation of the work. In 01·der to te8t the lens for extent of .field, defining power ar1d correctness of .figures, a system of squares and circles was constructPd with geometrical exactness on a drawing-lioard; the outside figure was thirty-two inches sqnare, divi<lccl by fiue liues into square inches, and from the centre six circles were described at distances from ten to sixteen inches. The drawing was placed before the camera, and the distance adjusted to make a reduced copy of near twerity-two inches square. Wet collodion was used. The aperture was the smallest. '.rhe weather fair. The focus was adjusted on the rery centre, in order that the full aberration might he exhibited at the edges of the copy. The time of exposure was three minutes, (in doors.) 'l'he ret-mlt was a plate of such density as would be satisfactOl'y for printing after it had been intensified. The plate after being dried and varnished was submitted to very colsc measurement of the four extremes, and two middle lines, with the following result in metres. Metres. Perpendicular Lines.

It is also seen that the lines are slightly curved outwards, or the figure is "pin cusioned shaped." Comparing the mean of the extremes with the middle line, the difference is seen to be six deci-roillimetres in one direction, and five in the other, or an average five and a half deci-millimetres; one half of this, only, or rather less than one hundredth of an inch, is the measure of the curvature of the outside lines. In definition, this plate is clear and bright without variation from the centre out to the first circle, or through a disc of about fourteen inches diameter. In looking from line to line of the circles not much varia· tion is discernible; but in comparing tlie outermost circle with the inner one, the inevitable widening of the line is seen with its attendant mistiness. From this to the corner, the. widening and mistinel?S increases, but the lines are good for printing out to the very comers.

A. second test of the lens was made by copying, in its own size, of PO much of the drawing as would go on a 24 X 24 inc11 plate. This time the weather was dull, and the middle opeuing (nearly five eighths of an inch) was used. The time of exposure was three minutes, (in doors,) and the result satisfactory as to density. This plate gave the followiug rnea::.urernents: Perpendicular Lines. Metres.

In this plate tlrn e:flect of prolonging the focus, is immediately oeeu in its flattening the field, for the difference between the mean of the outside and the middle lines is only 3 deci-miliimetres in the horizontal lines, and 2.1) in the perpendicular line's, in the mean 2.75 deci-rnillimetrcs, giYing only about 2 /10 th of an inch aR the mea,,nrf' of grPa teBt curvatnr<' in thP out;idr, 1i1ws-an inappreciablf' r1n:mtity in opPrations of thi,; sort. The lens may tl1erefore be said to copy free from distortion. The latter plate, like the former, ·was focussed accurately for the centr<'. Yet only the very corners C'Xhibited a sensible widening of the line and the consequent mistiness. It may be remarked, however, that hy focusing for a good general de£nition of the whole field instead of it,; central portion a better definition of the lines near the edgus woulcl liavc heen obtained. 'l'he performance of the globe lens l1aYing thus not on1y bepn proYcd very safo,factory, but giving results far superior to those we had been able to obtain with our orthoscopie lC'nS of twenty-two i11ches so1ur focus, it was with your consent purchased for the government. Since t11en it has been in e.tmstant use dm·iug thrPf' months of unusually dark and mi:;ty weather, a11d the !'c;o;ults have abundamly Bhown its great advantage in the quantity of light, enabling the photographer to work at timc8 whcu with our former a]lparatus the attempt would have seemed hopeless.

Srn:
llfr. StraUEZ and Mr. Feudal! of tl1e Coast Survey l have rendered tl1emselvcs extremely useful to me in compiling maps for the use of the army and na,·y, and making surveys of the field of operations before Vicksburg. I sent 1\Ir. Strausz down in a ves8e] near the front of tlie city to make plans and take sketches of the batteries, which he dicl to my satisfaction, giving us information that we have not possessed before, and showiug the impracticability of attacking Vicksburg by water alone. We might otherwise have run om heads against a stone wall. During the ascent of the Yazoo river, and while engaged in taking up torpedoes, our passage was contested at every step by two or three thousand riflemen in pits and behind levees, so protected that our guns could not hurt them. The vessels were much cut up, the rifle-balls going through and through the light upper works. Mr. Strausz accompanied the expedition, and while under fire produced a good chart of tl1e river and back country, with which we have made our advances. I could not have got along very well without these maps. Both Strausz and Fendall are very assiduous in making maps for future use. 'l'hi:y are now making one of the State of Arkansas, where we intend striking a blow before returning to Vicksburg, the water being still too low to operate there with any 11ope of success. It is all swamp now, except in front. "rhen the water rises our vessels can get near to dry land, where they can cover the troops. I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant, (Signed,) DAVID D. PORTER. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent Coa1;t Sun-ey.
