COAST SURYEY OFFICE, H'"asld11gton, D. C., October 15, 1875. S1R: In accordance with law, I lrn\·e the honor to present my report showing the progres!l 1 during the year from July 1, 18U, to July 1, lSi;J, iu the surl'ey of tlle Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts of the United States. Field-work has been well ad\·ance<l in triangulation and topograpby, as will be seen by the synopsis in Appendix No. 1, which states the number of surve,riug parties and their distribution aloug the coast. The insbore hydrograpL.r, fa-.;ored by provision made in the last and the preceding Congress for the construction of se\·eral vessels, has been pushed as actively as the means allowed. 1\Iore are, however, needed, as was exphtined iu my report of last year, the laud-work being yet in advance of the inshore hy<lrography, and much remains to be done in the marine development off shore. On the Pacific coast, we ha\'e only one sea-going steamer; but the energetic naval officer in command has already decreased the nrrearage in coast-soundings which was outstanding at the opening .of the year 1874. It is gratifying to record also that bydrographic progress on the Athmtic coast has profited by able discrimination at the Navy Department in the assignment of several accomplished officers. As yet., the provision for tllem in nssels adapted to the work is inadequate, but it will be kept in view as a duty to urge the construction of a few vessels in addition, to insure the completion of hydrography in all cases in the season in which provision is made for it by land. operations. ..Apart from tliis aim, and as explained in previous reports, most.of the smaller vessels used for prosecuting the coast-triangulation aud topography am wom out. Nine, used for several :rears merely as quarters, have been disposed of within the present year. The one last offered for sale, under the !'auction of the Treasury Department, was twenty-nine years old. Of the class of vessels here referred to, and all of wi.Jich ha\·e become useless by long service, none were built under the control of tlle Hydrograpllic Didsion of the Survey. l\[ost of them, unseaworthy for years, have served as nucomf-0rta0Ie quarters for parties workir.g near the.ports at which the bulks were laid op. The first direct provision hy Congress for means of transit at sea adapted to the requirements of the service took effect at the end of tbe year 1871, when two steam-vessels were lrnilt in accordance with plans furnished by the hydrograpltic inspector. Both of these vessels have justified my expectation in their construction. Snbsequent appropriation provided for the construction of seve1·al steamers and schooners, each of which, in i>lan and arrangement, bas been the sul!_ject of careful study in the office, based on foresight of the work in which the ve::;sct was to be employed, whether in deep-sea soundings, ordinary inshore hydrography, or in the development of comparatively shallow bays and sounds along the southern coast. For efficiency in prosecuting the hydrography of the. Pacific coast, oaesteamer and two schooners a.re neetled, and two others are requisite to replace schooners that have been worn out in ser".iee on the Atlantic and Gulf coast. On the 1st of Octob~r, detailed estimates were submitted for continuing the field-work and hydrogra.phy of the coasts of the United States dnl'ing the fiscal year 18i6-'77. As heretofore, a oopy will be included in this report, preceded by a brief recapitulation, to show the assignment of Farties in the operations of the year ending June 30, 1875. In the botly of the report, more extended Jnention will be made of the several items of work prosecuted in the course of the year under the fol!owing heads: Sonntlings in the Gull of Maine; also, on Jeffrey's B:ink, Oashe's Ledge, and JefH.

DISCOVERIES AND DEYELOl'.}IEN'l'S.

Particulars in regard to most of tlrn items which belong under this head were published as Notices to ]llariners in the con rse of the present year. As special results, tl1t>y are reported from the chiefi! of parties without delay, and the notice in each case issues immediately after tLe receipt at the office of snfficient information in regard to the danger. Under the beads of Se~tion I, Section V, Section VI, and SGction X, in this report, further mention will be made of the items here recapitulated: 1. A. bank found off the coast of Maine (Platt Bank), 10 miles !oug and 5 miles wide, and l1aYing at places on it only 29 fathoms of water. 2. Shore-line chauged by sea encroachment at the north end of Hunting Island, coast of Soutll Carolina. 3. Increased depth of tbe channel into Saint Augustine Harbor, Fla. 4. Water in 21 fathoms at a spot off l\Iatanzas Inlet, Florida, frequently agitate(], and when turbid appearing as a shoal. 5. Southwest entrance to Tampa Bay, Florida, sounded, showing 19 feet on the bar at mea11 low water and a straight channel. The notth channel into that bay bas 21 feet. G. A large rock found two miles southwest of Gadsden's Point in Tampa B:iy, Florida, with }leaks, having only 4 feet of water at low tide. 7. Snbmarine canon oft the Pacific coast, southward of S<mta Cruz Island, Cal. 8. Tbree 1mnken rocks, dangerous to navigation, near Point San Luis, Cal. !), A rock off the South Farallon. 10. A very dangerous rock inside of Blnnt's Reef off Cape Mendocino, Cal. 11. A sunken rock off the Pacific coast and opposite to the boundary he tween California and Oregon. 12. A harbor of refuge deYeloped near Mack's Arch on the coast of Oregon . .Appliances in marine engineering have recently gh'en promise of tbe remo\·al, by blasting, ot the upper parts of isolated rocks that are now dangerous to navigation. Amongst these is "Roon· day Rook" in the Pacific, and more than 30 miles southwest of S;1u Francisco Entrance. In regard to its remo\'al, arrangements have been made by Lieut. Col. C. Seaforth Stewart, Uuited StatN3 Corps of Engineers, under whose direction Lieutenant \Veedcn employed a diver to search near the buoy set by the hydrographic party, and found two additional sharp pointR of rock, one of them ha·ing on it only, 14 feet of water at low tide. Specifications embodying full information ba\·e bel'n issued since by Uentenant-Oolonel Stewart, and it is hoped that the pinnacles of "Noonday Rock'' that were dangerous to large vessels may be blasted awity before the close of the present year.

ImPOHT OF TilE SGPERINTENDENT OF

Tbc ship Noonday, on the 2u of January, 18G3, struck on one of tlrn sharp points, and in less than two hours r.ank in 40 fathoms. Continuous watching off shore by one of the Janel-parties, while working near Cape J\fendocino, without seeing any break, even in stormy weather, in water iu which the same party subsequently found sharp rocks, renders it extremely probable that on some of the most dangerous points of rock the sea may ne\-er break at any time.
TIDES OF NEW YORK HARBOR.

The continuous tidal ohservations recorded at the station in New York Harbor, between the years 1856 and 1874 inclusive, embracing a complete series of nineteen year.s, lfa\-e been recently discussed by Prof. \Villiaru Ferrel, of the Coast Survey. Tile amplitudes and epochs of all of the principal inequalities in tile heights and luuitidal intervals, found nee«lful for either theoretical purposes or for practical application in forming tables for the predictions of the tiaes, 11an~ been determined. The result of the discussion sllow8 that tile same general type of tides pre,·ails here which is found at Boston and alo11g the New Euglaml coast. This consists in a very small solar tide and declinational inequality, aml a proportionally large lunar parallactic inequalits, and likewise a very small diurnal ti(le. The most interesting result reached by Professor Ferrel, and having a bearing npon the theory of the tides; one, moreover, which seems peculiar to the station, is that the lunar diurnal tide at New York does not vanish when the moon is on or neat' the equator, lmt is a minimum, and still about one-third as large as the maximum at the times of greatest declination. Practical tables have been formed from tile results of the discussion, to be used in computing the heights and times of high water in N!-'lw York Harbor, and tllese are now being applied in computing them for the ;year 1877. Tile results of the discussion, and also the practical tahles for computing the tides, are gh-en in Appendix No. 12.
'l'R.A.NSIT OF VENUS.

At the date of my last annual report, two parties of Uoast Survey assistants, organized nuder the auspices of the commission which was authorized. b,y Congress to arrange for olJserviug the transit of Venus in December, 1874, had left our shores, one of the parties destined for Japan, tlle other for Chatham Island in the South Pacific Oceau. In forethougllt and preparations by the commission, nothing was omitted that could a.<ld to eflicieucy in tlle arrangements desirable for snccess in the observations. Witk reference alone to the parties of Coast Survey observers, the stations selected and approved by the commission were such that, with clear weather on the day of transit, a fair value of the 1:1olar parallax might be deduced from observations recorded nt these positions. To tlris end, provision was made for· obsen-ing by two methods :-Halley's, depending upon the observed duration of the transit; and the photograpl11c method, which is relied on to give a record of the apparent path of Venus across the sun's disc. The instrumental equipment included also means for determining the latitude and longitude of each of the stations,' so that, iu the event of partial success in observing the transit, the computer might introdnce a conditional equation for any single observation ofingress or egress in connection with the general system of comlitions derived from observations at all other stations. From the detailed reports of the two parties, gh-en in the Appendices Nos. 13 and 14, it will be seen that in Japan the transit was observed with some measure of success. Unfortunately, clouds and rain prevailed at the critical hours on Chatham Island, all(l permitted little to be recorded bearing directly on the object of the expedition. Assistant George D~vidson, ac!}ompanied by Subassistant 0. H. Tittmann and Mr. W. S. Edwards, aid in the Coast Survey, sailed from San Francisco on the 29th of August, and reached Yokohama. on the 23d of September1 1874. Nagasaki, in Japan, having telegraphic oommnui~ tions with European observutories, was chosen by Mr. Davidson as tlie station for observing the transit. The astronomical instruments were m'lunted on a. hill ab:mt one mile south of that city.

In ail vance of the period for final observations, the Japanese offich1ls took deep i11terest in the sultiect, anu detailed several intelligent Japanese to aid in the succes8ive steps of the work. These 8ubscquently reported to their government on the use of the instruments with which they had practice under tlie direction of Pl'ofessor Davidson, and on the operations performed. Nag-asaki connects by telegraph·cable to the north with 'Vladivostock, and to the south with the coast of China. Professor Hall, of the United States Xaval Obser>atory, with a party at \Vladivostock, by previous arraugement with Professor JJaddson, exchanged se\·eral lrnndred clock-signals with the Coast Surn·y obsen·ers at Nagasaki on three favorable nights of October and November, and thus was carefully determined the difference of longitude between those two stations. Tbe telegraph-station at Nagasaki was connected by triangulation with the point at which 1\fr. Davidson suhsequeotly observed the transit of Venus. Observations for latitude, others on the occultation of stars, and practice by the astronomical aids and photographers occupied the month preceding the 9th of December. .On the 8tb, good observations were recorded for local time, and another series for the same purpose was obtained early iu the morning of the day on which tbe planet crosse(l the sun's disc. As these last observations were closing, elands began to form an11 to thicken nntil sunrise. At the first contact of the planet, which Professor Davidson 01Jse1·ved persona Hy, the sun's limb was much obscured by clouds. 'l'he second contact was Yery satisfactorily observed by Professor Davidson and l\fr. Tittmann, though the face of tbe sun was at. the time covered by thin clouds aud haze. After the first exte· rior contact, the clouds partially cleared, and micrometl'ic measurements were made of the separation of the cusps of the planet. After the first interior contact, Professor Davidson securell, by m icrometric measurement, records of the distance between the limos of the sun and planet, and at the meridian-transits of the two bodies lie observell the pa.ssages of their limbs for their cliffereuce in right ascension. His assistant, l\Ir. Tittmann, at the same time measureil for their diff·~rence in declination by recording micrometer differences between the sun's upper limb and the upper and lower limb of the planet. Before culmination, and a few minutes after noon, Professor J),n·idson cbtained a fine series of measures of the diameter of Venus under various degrees of brightness, usiug the double-image micrometer, the value of which had been previousl;y determined by transits of the pole·star. Soon after, the face of the sun wa,; agrtin ob,;cnred, and no otlter ob;;en'ations seemed possible; but, fortunatel.Y, a momentary break occurred in the clouds, and tho third contact of the planet was satisfactorily ouserved by Professor Davidson and also by )fc·. Tittmarrn. Deuse clouds shut out of view the fourth contact, and rain fell quickly afterward. During the tran~t, the photographers attached to the party at Nagasaki exposed one lrnntlreil and sixteen plates, about half of them prollucing fair negatives. For clock-correction, a final set of star-transits was recorded on the evening of the 9tll of December, the observations being made through breaks in the rain-clouds. Between Professor Davidson and the officials of Ja1)anese departments, cordial intercourse was maintained during the stay of the party in tllat empire. In Section X of this rpport, mention will be made of subjects to which the attention of Mr. Davidson was given incidentally before his return to the Uoiteu States. Subassistant Edwin Smitb, accompanied by Mr. A.. H. Scott, aid in the Coast Sun·ey, arrived at Wba.ngaroa Bay, Chatham Island, in the United States ship S1Vatara, on the HHh of October, 1874. For detNminiug t.he longitude of the pl<ice, the transit-instrument taken by the party was immediately mouutetJ, and the cllronometers were compared with the results obtained for local time. Up to the 6th of Decemuer the weather continuetl fine at Chatham Island; the party was drilled in the use of instruments, and was in com1>lote readines~ for observing the transit of Venus. On the 7th, a storm set in, and prevailecl while the planet was crossing the sun's disc. Tue first 01· outer contact was entirely hid by a clouil, but, through a momentary break soon after, a few cuspmeasurements were recorded. The second or interior contact was also bid from view IJy clouds The sun shone faintly at intervals afterward, and a few measures with the eqnatori.al were recorded. The photographers exposed twenty plates, all the points of wl1ich sl10w the presenee of clou1]A. or tl1e plates, about two-thirds will IJe of no value, in conscqncuce of the cloudy obscuratiou of the suu.

OBITUARIES.

During eight years preceding the untimely death of Prof. Joseph Wiulock, director of the Cambridge obsenatory, on the 11th of Jnne, 1875, the work of the Coast Survey had benefited by his r<>sources and expedients in practical astronomy, and by personal co-operation in our most important longitude-determinations. At the observatory, his tenure was made effective to us by the activities of a strong intellect, that centered only on the attainment of desirable results. His extended list of Standard Time Stars is specially valnahle. Amongst instrumental improvements and inveutions resulting ft-om bis studies are the break-circuit chronometer and the horizontal photographic telesoope, already1.n use for special purposes, and much valued by observers at home and abroad. That device was particularly serviceable in recording observations on the recent transit of Venus. Large prospectfre value attaches also to uis labors in providi11g methods aud means for precision in astronomical observations and records. Fortunately, studies to such ends were the bent of this able man of science, aml so was lrn occupied on the last tlay of bis life. In plan and effect, 80me of llis ingenious devices have been realizecl to the advantage of science; of some, the appli· eation pertains to tlrn future. Tbe important results due to them will be ga t bered hereafter by other men. Professor Winlock, though resen·ed to an unusual degree in manner and sprcch, was widely known. In the social circle, he was also warmly regarded. There his genial thoughts and feelings were quietly aml evenly manifesteu t()IVartl all, aud by all wllo knew him cou l<l be readily interpreted as the promptiugs of a fervent nature. In the Engraving Dh·ision, the work of three skillful hands has been closed by death since the date of my last report. Of these, John Knight, who diell on the 28th of November, 1874, bad rendered thirty years of faithful service as engraver of titles and lettering on our principal chart!'~ It will not be forgotten in the division that empleiyment was llis daily pleasure, a cast of mind which had early become habitual iu this gentle, intellig.ent, conscientious man. Though not excelled as a letter-engraver, some of the last working-time of Mr. Knight was ginn to the application of forms for the improvement of style, and recently issued charts show that beyond thY.:1ge of seventy-one years bis hand retained its forme,r skill. Only a few months after their completion, and in great debility, but without any apparent disease, he resignecl life, exchanging in his last honr cheerful greetings and leave-takings with his relatins and many friends. John C. Kondrup, Danish vice-consul for Wasbin~ton City, joiuecl the office as engra\·'Cr in l\'lay, 1855, and, afte1· continuou$ and acceptable service, died at bis residence on Capitol llill 011 the 10th of December, 1874. Be was valued for skill in rendering the even outlines required on charts of the first order. J:<'or some years, the health of Mr. Kondrup had been impaired by the pulmonary rlisorder that caused his death in bis forty-sixth year. To the last, however, he manifested before all who silently grieved in view of the inevitable issue tho same manly fortitude, friendly courtesy, and generous qualities of mind which at an early period had gained for him the esteem of a large circle in Wash· ington. Henry S. Barnard, an engraver of special talent in the branch of delineation known as "sanding" on charts, died, after a short illness, at the age of sixty yeaPs, on the 23d of Seph~mber, 1874. As a. worthy and indnstrious man, Mr. Barnard fulfill<>d tlie expectations which attended his call to the Engraving Division in April, 18:;6.

PART II.
In this part of the re1~ort, short abstracts, arranged iu geogr:ipliical order, will be gi\·en, to sbow the essential particulars of work done hy eacll of the field and h~;drographic parties. !<'or the Atlmitic coast, tlie order of arrangement will be from north to soutli, aud, as heretofore, the work on thf' Pacific coast, will be noticed in the r·e\·erse order. The ab,,;tmcts will he, as usual, recapitulated in tabular form, to accompany this report as Appendix Xo. 1. Wide!~· distributed as the snr. ve_ying parties have been off the coast and on the land, and subject to all the \ariations of weather and of climate between the \Vest Indies and Alaska, it is gratifying to record that no serious accident within the year has been superadded to hardships that are in many (llaces incident to the ser-dce. Much rough weather pre\·ailed when parties were transferred last autumn for fiel<l-work and hydrography on the southern coast and in the Gulf of Mexico, !mt by cautions navigation all disasters were m·oided. On tue Atlantic side, some little delay was allowed in consequence of ,yellow fe,·er, bnt the only seizure by pestilence occurred in a party on the Pacific coast. The sick ltautl, when sma1J.pox appeared, was prompt.Jy removed to some distance, cared for properly by the chief of the party, and in due time was allowed to rettun, the work meanwhile not luwing inte1·111itted. In gerwral, the notices of work done wilt be restricted to the mention of dates and limiti:, tlte names of tlie persons employ('(], aml tile rn~ults in statiRtics; but, in a 1ew cases, collateral incidents, either of. pPrsonal moment or of local interest, will also be mentioned. l·'or i>e,·eral mouths after the opening of the present year, I had the able co-operation of Capt. K. R. Breese, U.S. N., wlio accepted and effectively discharged the duties of hydrographie.inspector in the Coast Survey until tlie end of May last. The intelligent interest, personal cordiality, aurl rNldiness of tlrnt officer in applyiug the rf'sults of matured experieuce iu maritime details made it a matter special regret to sever an associatiou so prornisiug for the fotnre benefit of tile Sun·ey. In May, however, fortunately for the serYice, Commander ELI ward P. Lull succeeded in the vacau t position, and to him 1 am already indebted for valuable assistance in providing for the tranS(lOrtation of field and bydrographic parties, and in other important details of the division, amongst which are plans, i;ipecifications, and estimates for the construction of vessels; arrangements for their repair and outfits; all(l, ou tl.Je return of hydrographic parties, inspection of the manuscript charts in a(h'anee of their acceptance for· registry and deposit in the archives. In general duties ]>ertaining to the Hydrographic Division, including the selection of sailing-lines, preparation of notes for tbe engraved charts, and revision i11 regard to the marked positions of aids to navigation, <Jorumander Lull is assisted by Lieut. H. E. :N"ichols, U. S. N. I~ieut.. C. A. Bradbury, U.S. N., after service in the hydrograpbic party on board the steamer Blake, daring the summer of 1874, off the coast of New Englaud, was temporarily attached to this branch of tbe service. While he was at the office, exceptionally cold weather, after the opening of the present year1 so much iuterrnpted navigation along the eastern coast as to make a record desirable of peculiarities in the ice formation. At my request, he visited the ports of New England, and from pilots and others collected and reconlcd particulars at places uear which ice was then regarded as dangerous to vessels in approaching the coast, and at others in which it had ueeu or was then a ·biuderance to navigation. Inquiry was made also with reference to periods of recurrence in excessirn ice formation; the elates at which navigation had been closed in preceding ;years; the effect of ice on saili11g·co11rses here aud t,here; aud whether or not well-set buoys had been displaced by moving ice in the course of the winter. · As results of the in>estigatioo, it appears, from the detailed report of Lieutenant Bradbury, that the extensive local formations of ice in January broke up, and in tlw fir.st week of .February accumulated as drift-ice along the shores. Twelve days of severe cold follo1Ved, aad in that period the local formations were renewed l>y ice: some of which remained in place until ~he middle of March. l\feanwhile, the <hift ice, by subsequent freezing, had formed exten<led masses, as in the lower parts of bays along the coast of Maine; also, in Cape Cod Bas; and as far to the son th ward as Long bland Sound thefroze.u drift was fuuntl in connection ,\>ith ice, which remained where it

On the coast of Maine, only a few of the buoys were displaced; but, as beiug more exposed to the.sweep of large bodies of drift-ice, the displacement of buoys was general iu Nantucket Sound, Vineyard Sound, Long Island Sound, Cape Coil Bay, Buzzard's Bay, and in the barhors adjacent. Lieutenant Hradhury's report was accompanied by a series of eugra\·ed charts, ou which he indicated the extent of the local and casual ice formations in each of the localities. The unusual impediments recorded as affecting nayigation s~em to be due to the sudden cold that formed into fixed masses the ice wuich was liberated at the end of January. The substance of Lieutenant Bradbury~s report will be embodied in the Coast Pilot. SECTION I.

Deep-sea s01mdings.-At the encl of June, 187 4, J_,ieut. Commander John A. Howell, U.S. N., assistant in the Coast Snney, left Provincetown with his party in the steamer Blake, aml was engageu until the middle of September in running off;;hore lines of soundings between George's Bank anu the Bay of Fundy. In the latitude of Yarmouth, two lines were run across that bay, and one to the southward from Grand l\lanan Island. Further westward, several courses were steered, anll soundings were recorded in crossing Jeffrey's Bank and Cashe's Ledge. The least depth fouud on that ledge was 7} fathoms. Before the close of the season in this quarter, Lieut. Commander C. D. Sigsbee, U.S. N., who subsequently succeeded to the command of the Blake, joined the party witli improved appliances and means for deep-sea soundings. These were put in operation by LieutenantCommander Howell, worked satisfactorily, and were subsequently used by the party in tbe Gulf of Mexico, of the work in which notice will be taken under the head of Section VIII. With the apparatus de>ised by Sir vVilliam Thomson for dee.p-sea soundings, and modified by Commander Belknap, U.S. N., tlie party on the steamer Blake readily brought up specimens of bottom from a depth of 2,144 fathoms in the Gulf of l\faine. The work in the steamer Blake was prosecuted with the assistance of Lieutenants \V. II. ,Jacques, E. S. Jacob, Hicliard Ru::;b, and C. A. Bradbury, U. S. N. At the end of the season in this section, the first three of these officers, who had renderell acceptable service during several preceding season!!, were detached from the Coast Survey.

Commander Howell, at my request, kindly retained charge of the steamer Blake until after the arrival of the vessel at New Orleam;, and the organization of a pa,1 ty for bydrographic work in the Gulf of Mexico. After the close of the season in th<it section, in June last, Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee returned with the steamer Blake to the coast of New England, and will prosecute the offshore bydrography until November of the present year. The term of service of Commander Howell on Coast Survey duty was closed by his assignment by the Na"Vy Depart;meut to the responsible position of instructor of gunnery at the Naval Academy, Aunapolis. Topography and liydrograpky, Mount Desert Island, llte.-Resuming field-work in tbis section at Hull's Cove in Jnly, 1874, Assistant J. W. Donn traced the remaining shore-line of the northwestern part of Mount Desert Island_, and joined with the limits of a previo~s plane-table sheet at Pretty J\larsh Harbor. The interior topography was then filled in to join tbe limits of topography completed in other seasons. Nol'th of th(} Mount Desert Narrows, the shores were traced to include Eastern Bay, ·western Bay; the island shores in that vicinity; and further to the south warJ the islands in Bartlett's Narrows.

During heavy gales, it is not possible to Jam] a boat anywhere at the rock in safety. The work in this section occupied the party of .A.ssistant Donn until near the end of October, 1874, when preparation was made for resuming operations in Section III, nuder whiclt head mention will be made of the work done during the winter. Topography of Eggemoggin Reach, Me.-The plane-table sun-ey of the coast of Maine, in the vicinity of Eggemoggin Reach, was resumed by Assistant \V. II. Dennis on tile 17th of June, 1874. After completing work to include the northern part of Deer Isle, the party was transferred to tlrn opposite shore of the reach, where a fringe of the usual width in topography was mapped from Sedgwick southward and eastward to Naskeag Point and from thence northward to the month of Illue Il ill Bay. The shores of Herrick's Bay are shown on oue or tlte t!Jree plane-table sheets which were worked ou in the course of the season, as are also the islands, rocks, and ledges that exist within tbe working limits of the season.

Hydrography of .I'enobseot Bay.-Early in July, 1811, the schooner Silliman, with the party of .Assistant Audersou, left Portland to prosecute sonudiug-s at se,·eral lucali ties near l'euobscot Entrallce. The numerous ledges between Cnpe Hosier and the Fox Islands were developed. Iu August, Mr. Anderson found, south of Islel.Joro', and sounded out, a shoal 011 which the revennecntter Dou bin llad grouuded. In Penobscot Hiver, soundings were extended urnnml as far as \Yi1:terport. Assistant Anderson remarks of that part of the rh·er that a middle groun<l is forming opposite to Fort Knox. Se,·eral ledges in Belfast Ilay were den·loped by sounrlings. Tile work between Cape Rosier and the Fox Islands was referred to a tide-gauge at Castine; tbat iu tlle reuol>scot to a tide-gauge on the steamboat-wharf at Bucksport.

As stated in my Inst report, the self registeriug gauge at that station is furnished wit11 all requirements for the pn:servatiou of a continuous record. Among these is tbe apparatus for heating, which 1>rovetl efl'ectiYe last winter, no tides being lost even w!Jen the cold was excessive. Occasionall,r, wheu the gauge, is stoppeJ. for repairs, 1\lr. Spaulding has continued the record by staff-observations, so that from the beginning of the series each high and eacL low water is given iu the record. Co-efficient of refraction.-The party of Assistant F. ,V, Perkins was ready for work at Hagged Mountain, a station of the primary t1'iangulation near Camden, Me., in the middle of July, 187!, but operations were hindered for i;evernl weeks by fog, haze, and rain. Duriug that interval, however, as throughout the season, the requisite meteorologicnl observations were reeordeil hourly ou the mountain, and for periods of ten days each at }fount Desert and White llead light-house. The heights above tide-water of the geodetic stations -0n !lagged .Mountain and .Mount Desert, of a point on Tennant'8 Harbor and of the light-houses at \Vhite Head, 011·Fs II0;1d, and Matinicus were determined by lines of~ leYels run by tlie aids of t!Je party, :Messrs.

Perkins closecl work on tbe 1st of September, and later iu the season nsumed the surYey of the Gulf coast in Section VII. '1.'rianyulation in Neu Hampshire.-Early in June,_ 1874, Prof. E.T. Quimby took the field, aml by reconnaissance determined the practicability of a scheme of triangulation to 1rnss from the valley of Connecticut RiHr, or western boundary of New Hampshire, westward to the Green Mountains. Tile detailed work: was then trikeu up at Obsen-atory IIill near HanoTer, N. II., a station in the R~-stem which connects with tlrn primary triangulation of the coast of New England. Azimuth was determined at Ohservatory Hil1, and Dartmouth College obserrntory was connected witil that station l>y the measurement of horizontal angles. Kearsarge Mountain was occupied with the theodolite early in July, 1874, and Cube l\Iountain before the end of' that month. The obsernttious were continued at all fa\·orable interrnls until the close of' the season in August.

Professor Quimby again took the field on the 1st of June, 1875, commencing tlie operations of tl1e season at Croydon Mountain. The details of work done in the course-of the present fiscal year will appear in my next annual report. Isles of Slwa 1-s.-The hs drographic party of Acting Master Robert Platt, U. S. N ., in the steamer Ilacbe, was in 1eadiness for duty in this section in the middle of .Tul~., 187-i, having made final iireparntions for work while at anchor in the harbor at Isles of Shoals. In steamiug out by tlie clrnnuel lletween Ilalf 'Vay Rock and Star Island, the Yessel passed very near to a rock, which was fonml, on examination, to have only seven feet of wat_er on it at low tide. Notice was promptly giYcn of tLc existence of tllis danger, and, at interYals when weather was unfavorable for ofl'shore work, the Yicinity of tbe rock and of the ledges adjacent to the islands was carefolly sonntled. The chart has been rnvise1l in accorua.nce with the results of this examination, amongst which is a tlm·elopment of the channel between Star Island and Cedar Island, showing a depth of only nine feet at mean low water. Je_ffhy's Ledye.-A.cting Master Platt sounded out this letlge in August, and found no depth lc>ss than has been heretofore reported. Working, l10wever, with a steam-\·essel, and under circumstances otherwise fa\·orable, the coutonr of the ledge was defined with greater accuracy than has heen hitherto practica\Jle. The chart was plotted from records which showed the angles taken simultaneously lly theodolite obserYations from White Island light-bonse, and lly the sextant while soundings were in progress. Cashc's Ledge.-In reference to his work in tbat vicinity, Acting l\Iaster Platt reports as fa]. 1ows: "The deep-sea lines running oft' to the le<lge depend of necessity ou the logs and cbronometer-obserYations, our <lepitrturc being al ways from shol'e points wbieb hncl been well determined The direction of the ship was followetl by sextant-angles on the different light-houses, and the eud. of each liue was determit1ed as carefully as possible by taking angles and bearings on prominent objects as soon as they became Yisible." The soundings recorded by the 1mrty on the steamer Bae.be showed no depth on Cashe's Ledge Jess than twenty-four fathoms; but, as the existence of less water is not at all doubtful, it seems probable that future soundiugs may denlop spots having as little as seven fathoms between the lines of soundings recorded in this examination. Platt Bank.-Ontside of the currn of 100 fathoms, and between .Teffre;y's Ledge and Casbe's J~ellge, Acting Master Platt founll a. bank the existence of which was hitherto unknown. lfo reports that, unlike most of the shoals in this section, the soundings showed it to be eompoaed of

sa111I, gravel, and broken shells, but without any mnd. Tlie bank was carefully clevclopctl, and proYe<l to be about 10 miles long east and west, and 5 miles in breadth, withi11 the curve of 50 fathoms. The least water on Platt Bank found iu the survey here noticed was :!!l fatlloms. Specimens of tbe dredgings taken while soundings were in progress were forwarded to Dr. A. S. Pack· ard as having probahly some bearing on the researches now pending under the direction of Prof. Spencer F. Baird, United States Commissioner of .E'ish and Fisheries. Jejfrey's Bank.-Tbis bank was reached in the hydrographic operations by deep-sea lines started from well-determined points on suore. Acting Master Platt found the bottom very irregular, but the general depth as developed by the soundings does not vary from the depth heretofore reported. Early in September, Dr. Packard aud two assistants were taken on board of the steamer Bache at Salem, and the next fortnight was passed in dredging and in instrumental tests on sea-water. Specimens of sea-bottom taken at forty different localities were procured in that interval by the observers. Temperatures of the water were recorded at sixty-three positions in tbe course of the operations on the several banks and ledges.

Late in October, the steamer returned to Norfolk, and was there refi.t.ted for bydrographic service, of which mention will be made in Section VI of th"is report. )\;fr. J.B. A.damson was attached as aid to the bydrographic party on board the steamer Bache. Tidal obsen·ations.-At Boston navy-yard, the self.registering tide-gauge of the old form, although provided with heating apparatus, became clogged with ice duriug the severely cold weather of last winter. Several breaks in consequence appear in the tidal records. The observer, Mr. H. Howland, reports that ice formed in a large mass arouud the :float-box. This seems to have been a consequence of the accumulation of mud, and resulting want of depth in the water around the lower part of the box. The apparatus will be r~fitted for service at this station. Hydrog1·apfty icestward of jjfono1noy, Mass.- '\Vitll bis party in the steamer Endea,·or, Subassistant F. D. Granger resumed work near Monomoy on the 10th of July, 1874. Soundings were prosecuted to include, in the northern part of· Nantucket Sound, part of Handkerchief Shoal, Chatham Roads, and generally tbe waters westward to the vicinity of Bishop and Clerk's lighthouse. Along the north shore of the som1d, a space was not reached iu the operations predous to the date at which it was most expedient to withdraw the vessel for service during the winter in Section VI. The space referred to was therefore included in plans of work to be prosecuted in the autumn of 1875. Much bad weather was experienced in the summer of 1874. The work in deep water was frequently interrupted, and boat-work was impracticable during the stay of the party. Bydrograpbic operations were discontinued for the season on the 20th of October. Tidal observations were recorded during three months at Monomoy, and for part of the season also at Hyannis. On a separate hydrographic sheet, Subassistant Granger plotted soundings which were made by his party at favorable intervals iu the vicinity of Nantucket Jight-honse, to develop the pres· en.t character of Great Point Rip, and to fill space near it and farther eastward. The aggregate statistics of work are: Miles run in sounding. _. __ · _____ ···.. __ · __ . __ · ___ .. _. _. _......·.. - . - .... 701 Angles measured ................ _······ ___ ...·. _····.·. __ .....·. _-....· - . . 5, 649 Number of l!Ouudings .. _..· __ . _..··...· ___ ..· _.. _. __ .

REPORT OF TIIE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Survey of Taunton River, Jlfass.-For the determi11ation of points on which to fot:nd tbe plane. table survey of tl1e sborns of Taunton River, Assistant A. M. Harrison took the field on the 1uth of July, 1874.. The triangulation was joined with stations previously occupied on the shores of Mount Hope Bay, and was extended ahout twenty-two miles upward. along the course of the rh'er. Rapid advance in local improvmnent, the extension of city-limits, and the opening of new roads bad, by consequent alterations of the ground-surface, displaced the station-marks iu the vicinity of ' l!'all River, which positions were relied on at tbe outset of the season for a prompt beginning in plane-table work. Points were determined, however, sufficient in number for a topographical sheet, by the 20th of September, when :}Ir. Harrison commeuced the plane-table survey at a station almut three miles above the mouth of the riYer. The triangulation was continued a month beyond that date, in charge of Mr. ·w. H. Stearns, one of the ai<ls in the ])arty. On the topographical sheet, which was completed b;r the 6th of November, details of survey were shown for both banks of the river from poiuts below Steep Brook Village, to stations above Somerset. The features generally within about one-third of a mile from the water-line are included in the survey. Io joining with the limits of work <lone in 1861, Mr. Harrison noticed that great alterations had been wrought in the interval, not only in respect of artificial features, but also in regard to tlie shore lines. The completed sheet represents the town of Somerset, and the villages of Steep Brook, PottersYille, and Egypt, t11e Old Uolony anc1 Newport Hailroad, with deep cuttings and higl1 embankments, its course across the river, and the high embankment opposite to Somerset. Above that town, the roints already determined will suffice for extending the plane-table sur\·ey to the vicinity of Taunton. Assistant Harrison was aided iu tbe topographical survey by Mr. Bion Bradbury. In the survey here noticed, the amount of detail relative to tbe area representefl is unusually large, hence the general statistics, as reported at the end of the season, do not properly measure the degree of labor requisite for the results.

Physical surz,ey of Pr011idencc Harbor, R. I.-This work, prosecuted during the autumn of 1874 in connection with a careful shore-line survey, was undertaken at the reqt1est of the city authorities of Providence. All the running expenses of the two i}al'ties engaged under tbe direction of Assistants H. L. "Whiting and Henry Mitchell were defrayetl by tbe municipal government. The question presented in the call for this special survey, as made known by previous conference with the chairman of the harbor commissioners, W.W. Uickard, esq., is expected to result in the assignment of limits in encroachments upon the harbor and its tributary basins, or lines beyond which the water-space could not be encroached on without injuriously affecting the natural order of its tidal and river streams that maintain the present channels. Anchorage~of course, a.nd winding-room, in present use, or likely to be required hereafter by vessels visiting the port and wharves of the city, necessarily make parts of the question involved. As a basis for the special hydrography, .Assistant Whiting carefully traced tbe shores of Providence Harbor a.nu Seekonk Uiver, and subsequently mapped the results in triplicate. Two of the sheets represent the results of the pl1ysical survey, aud on two others the proposed lines as limits of encroachment are traced. The six sheets on a scale ample for any future purposes of the city authorities were delivered to the harbor commissioners in March last. · For the S}lecial hydrograpllic work, the party of Assistant Mitchell left New York in the schooner Uesearch on the 3d of September, and, without delay, took np soundings and continued obsel"rntious on the currents of Providence Harbor until the 12th of Oct;ober. The resnits appear

Tidal observat-ions.-Tl.ie city engineer who commenced the series of obsen·ations at Providence, R. I., has been furnished with a supply of paper for continuing the record by means of tile selfregistering tide.gauge. This series, if well nrnintained, will in time be useful for the investigation of tides in Narragansett Bay. Pendulum observat.fons.-The series of obsen·ations commenced last _year was contiuuell duri11g the present season at Hoosac Mountain, near North Adam~, l\Iass., by Assistant O. S. Peirce, under the general direction of the com;ultiag geompter of the survey, Prof. Benjamin Peirce. Other stations will be occupied in order to procure means for inYestigatiug tllelaws of variation iu the intensity of gra\'ity, aud thus to aid in determining the figure of the earth. The firnt will ue kept iu view that in many places gravitation has l>een found at the sea·level on islands, greater than on n10untains far from the sea. Assistant Peirce was aided in the observations at North Adams by Mr. \V. E. l\fcOlintock. Under sanction from the Treasury Department, Mr. Peirce proceeded in April last, in accordance with my instractions, to repeat experiments at various stations in Europe. The objects sought are, to compare, by swinging at the foreign stations the non-invertible pendt1lum and the in,·ertible pendulum belongiug to the Cnast Survey, with penctnlnms used in the geodetic operations of the great European surveys. This work is yet in progres;;;, aud will include all the tests needful for determining relations between our own ana the foreign instruments whieh ha\'e l>eeu heretofore used for ascertaoiuiDg the force of gravity and of local attraction. The results of the work will be given in my next annual report.

fS.'Urvey of TJmrnes River, Gonn.-For ,coutinuing the sun'ey of the Thames uliove the naval statiou, a party was organized on the 8th of July, 1874, and prosecuted work in the field, under the charge of Assistant H. G. Ogden, until the 2d of October. In order to provide points for the plane-table work, l\lr. Ogden extended a tertiary triangulation from the vicinity of the naval station upward along the course of the river to Norwich. Tbe to·pographical survey was resumed at poi11ts above Gales' Ferry, and was cont.inned along both sides of the Thames as far up as the junction of the Shetucket with Yan tic 1'1.iver. Parts of both of 'these streams appear on the hydrograpbic sheet, which contaius also the soundings made in the Thames between Norwich and the naval station. The topography of this season joins previous work on the east bank at a point sometimes designated as Mount Decatur, and embraces a strip about halfa mile wide to within one mile of Norwich, bot is restricted to the river road in approaching the city. Oa the west bank, the survey by Mr. Ogden was begun at Mohican, and includes the tract between the river and the New Loudon turnpike from Mohican to the vicinity of Norwich, narrowing near the suburbs. Tides were obsen·ell \Vith a gauge near the naval station, and also at a wlta1·f near Norwich. It is notCll in his report by Assistant Ogden that the records of obsenations stendily iudicatcd a rise and fall at tile city

Sun'ey of New Ha11en Harbor, Oonn.-The work of Assistant R. M:. Bache in the survey at New Haveu bas resulted in the completion of thirteen plane-table sheets, showing the <letails of topography along the shores above Oyster Point ancl Fort Hale. During July and August, 1874, and uncler his immediate direction, the sun·ey was continued ab°'·e New Haven by a party of volunteers from the Sheffield Scieutific School, and, until November, by two others, maintained at the expense of ,the city, for mapping details desired by the harbor commission. 1\Ir. E. O. Savage, graduate of the Scientific School, conducted one of the parties, the members of which bad been instructed in the use of the water-level on the plain near the city. In progress eastward, contonrlines were traced in as the--party ascended the range ot' hills in that direction. The details are full io nilation to the area, the ground passerl. over being largely cov-ered by extensions from the former limits of the city. Twenty-four miles of roads and streets, and all artificial improvements in that quarter, appear on the topographical eheet. The two working-parties furnished by the city were conducted by Messrs. Horace Andrews and Neville B. Craig, both gratluates of the Scientific School. Seven large sheets, each three feet square, having been completed in the preceding seasC?n, the parties took in hand field-work for the eighth, and closed after comphlting the thirteenth sheet. Tbe g1·ound features and artificial objects were mapped with great precision, on a large scale, on drawing-paper attached, in the manufacture, to tbln metallic plates, by a special process developed by Assistant Bache. Twenty-one miles of water-line were miuutely traced for the five sheets. The aujostment of these and other features required the determination of twenty-two additional points by triangulation, and the measurement of sixty-eight horizontal angles. _.\..dditional to the work ah'eady noticed, Assistant Ba.che made a special survey of Dmmrnond's Bank in the Quinnipiac, and closely determinecl the differences in depth, to enable the harbor commission to decide on exceptions whiclt had been filed against the line marked as a harbor limit. In this survey, eacll sounding was located by an angle measun"d by simultaneous determinations with two transits. For the Rdjustment of soundings in the harbor, special care was taken. in the establishment of a bench-mark and in recording the tides. In the course of the winter and spring, the large amount of details mapped in the fiehl in pencil was inked, and the sheets have been delh-ered to the harbor commission. · Triangulation, Long Island Sound, N. Y.-Near the end of July, 1874, Assistant J. A. Sullivan took the field in this secticm, in order to co-operate with Assistant Cutts for the triangulation near the boundary between Counecticut and New York. In the course of a week, Mr'. Sullfran 1mt up signals at Wooster, Mount Tom, and Good Hill stations, but on an emergency be.was then transferred to the eastern end ()f Long Island Sound, and was there engaged until the 1st of December. Thirteen. light-houses were determined in position. These include the old and tl.ie new structnre on Block Island, and those at Montauk, Mystic, Hace Point, North Hummock, Gull Island, Oedar Island, Plum Island, Long Beach, Gardiner's Island, Faulk net's Island, Pnnquogne,.and the derrick which gives an approxima.te.centt!r for the fottn<lation <tf a light-house under oonstructien at Race Rock, near the west end of Fisher's Island. The beacon in Plum Gut was .also delermiued iu

position. The triangulation done in this Yicinity availed for the uses of the bydrograpbic party, the operations of which will lJe mentioned preseatl.r. Iu onlee to complete the determinations of position, it will be requisite to occupy additional stat.ions, and, in July of the preseut ~·ear, Assist· ant Sullivan will take the field for that serdce.

H. Stott, esq., ,-ice-commodore of the Brooklyn Yacht Club, who was then cruising in the vicinity. In the course of several weeks, the party was transferred from station to station by tliat gentleman in his own yacht; the aid being, moreover, made specially acceptable by the earnestness' of Mr. Stott in repeating his invitations, and by his cordial expressions of interest in the work of the party. Hydrography near Pluni Island, Long Island Sound, N. Y.-Sonndings which have heretofore appeared on the published chart of this part of Long Island Sound were made in the year 1838, and the vicinity has not been subsequently examined until within the present surveying year. In July, 1874, my attention was asked for the development, bJ· special soundings, of tbe channel which leads west of Plum Island from Gardiner's Bay into Long Island Sound. As soon as practicable, the work was taken up by .Assistant J. S. Bradford, who completeil the bydrography of the entire channel between Oyster Pond Point and the west encl of Plum Island. His party, in the schooner Palinurus, was engaged in this work until the 21st of August, 1874 . .A fow days after, Capt. K. H. Breese, U. S. X, then cruising with the United States ship Constellation, reported that Jiis ship had touchell on a rock or shoal between Gull Island and the entrance -to Gardiner's Day. .Assistant Bradford, being near by, commenced search immediately, but many traverses were patiently run in the cJurse of se\·en d;tys before any rock was found on which a deep-draught vessel could have touched. .A spar-buoy was placed by the party in the Palinurus to mark the danger. .A.mongst the expedients for linding such rocks, ~Ir. Bradford used a sweep, weighted in the usnal manner, aml which, in operation, made it plain that some of tlie many rocks in that locality are large bowl<lers that merely rest on the bottom near the eastern eud of Long Island, and that the rocks may be easily overturned. The drag used haYing 70 fathoms of line, and towed by the gig and cutter, finally caught ou a large bowlder, the depth on which was found to be 23 feet at mean low water, the depth around it ueing 5 fathoms, as was fonnd when the Constellation touched. The ship, however, was drawing not more than 21 feet, and her position was well determined. Hence, although from observation, in regard to other uowlders iu the Yicinity, it might be inferred that the Constellation, on tonchiug, overturned a rock, many of the bowlders havi11g been o'·erth10wn in the search by a force not comparable with the impact of a Jarg~ ship, the difference in positions makes it plain that the rock found by llr. Bmdford is not the l>owlder which was struck by the Constellation. The search for that rock wiII be renewed, and it will doubtless be identified. When the chart of this vicinity was issued some years ago, tho requirements in graphical bydrography were not such as they are uow. In order that the close supplementary souuding made by the party in the Palinurus might anil at once for the engraved Chart, positions on shore in the Yiciuity were carefully determined by the triangnlatiou-party of Assistant Sulli'\"an. Before resuming the work to which his party had been assigned for the season, Assistant Bradford made a survey of the" Ea.st Ground" off Block Island and found i fathoms. This shoal lies about five and a-half miles eastward of Block Island, and by a vassing vessel had beeu report.e<l as having shoaled to 6 fathoms. After completing the reconnaissance, a survey was made of Block Isla.nd·B~in, tbe breakwater.constructed b.r the United States engineers being then nearly finished.

The resulting hydrographic sheet shows Beebe Rock with only 8 feet of water on it, near North \Vest Point, and a shoal with 17 feet about midway between Pine Point and the spindle on OyRter Pond Reef.· Ju reference to alterations along the shore, .Assistant Bradford says: "Oyster Pond Point and the west shore of Plum faland have changed very much and are rapidly being cut away. At the nortbwe!'t point, tlie Hght-hoase site is defended by Hues of heavy bowltlers, that, falling, when washed out b.v the actiou of the water, now form a natural break water, wuich protects the face of the cliff. What was formerly Oyster .Pond Point is now a mass of bowlders with threads of water between them; hut, where there are no bowlders, the point is gradually giving way." Coast Pilot.-Tbe work noticed under the last head was done at intervals of the time allotted between June and December for compiling notes for a second volume of the Atlantic Coast Pilot. In previous years, .Assistant Bradford ha<l personally examine(! all the harbors Lietwcen Eastport and Point Judith. The larger part of his notes gathcrell in that work were printed last year, giving descriptions of dangers and sailing-directions for entering ti.le harbors of the coast of New England north of Boston. Assistruit Bradford, in the schooner Palinurus, resumed the special examinations in July, 187'!, uml in the course of the summer and a1.1tumu prPpared descriptions and notes relatiYe to Long lslaud Sound, Block Islaud Sound, and Fisher's Island Sound; and of the harbors of Stonington, New London, SayLrook, New II~weu, Napeagne Bay and Gardiner's Bay, Greenport, Peconic Bay, llem1)stencl, Oyster Ba,Y, Huntington BaJ', Bridgeport, and Black Uock; the harbors at Sheffield Island, Cawkins Island, Ca{\taiu's Island, Sachem Head, Hart and City Islands; the passage through the sound at Hell Gate; the courses of na\'igation in the waters of New York Bay; and notes respecting Newark Bay, Elizabethport, Perth Aml>oy, and the south coast of Long Islan(l. The Yessel and party were engaged in this service until the 20th of November, when the l'alinurus returned to Norfolk and was laid up for the winter. l\Ir. Bradford was· aided throughout the season by 1\lr. J. R. Barker, whose skill in graphic representation is well illustrated by the sixteen views, taken from the deck of the Palinurns, of approaches aull harbor-entrances that are mentioned in the notes of the year. In March last, after adapting, for a chMp and effective process of reproduction, the series of Tiews drawn by the late \V. B. Mc~Inrtrie, as illustrations in a fiual edition of the first Yolume of the Coast Pilot, Mr. Bar ker etcl1ed tlie views on glass preparatory to tlleir transfer to stone for printing. .Assistant Bradford occupied the winter in compiling and arranging notes for the second volume of the Coast Pilot, the preparation of which is now well advanced. During the summer and autumn of the present year, Lieut. C. A. Bradbury, U. S. N., will be associated with the party on board the schooner Palinurus, for revising work in advance of a second edition of the Coast Pilot. · Survey of Port Je;tfersan, Long Island, N. Y.-The party of Assistant F. H. Gerdes was organized for service with the schooner Dana, and early in July, 1874, was at work in the vicinity of Staten Island. For determining in position the new light-house near Fort Tompkins, a short base was measured, an<l connected with several triangles that were laid out between it and the position of the fort. Azimuth was determined for the line joinicg one of the stations with Trinity spire, the relath-e place of which, iu the triangulation of New York Harbor, was previously well known. On the completion of this work, the party was transferred to Port Jefferson, on the north side of Loug Island. Mr. Gerdes identified two of the stations which had ueen occupied for the triangulation of Loug Island Sound. From these, points were determined sufficient for a plane-table surYey, which vnis made in the course of the season to include Port Jefl'ersou, Setauket Harhor, and Con.science Bay. The waters included within the topographical Jimits were sounded carefully. Outside oft.be entrance, the hydrograpby was extended about a mile beyontl the shore, and close soondings between Oldfield light-house and Mount :Misery were plotted on a separate sheet. Subassistant O. P. ])illa.way was attached to the party in the schooner D,ma.

The survey of Port Jefferson was completed on the 4th of October. A few <l::lys after, the party engaged in work which will be mentioned presently in tliis section. Triangulation.-The ~ew York boundary-triangulation, commenced by the late Edmn111l Ulu11t, assistant in tile Coast Survey, for determining the exact geographical position of monu~ents on the line between that State and Connecticut and Massachusetts, starts from a line of the primary triangulation at Tashua and Ivy Stations, and ends at tlrn line joining Perry's Pl'ak and Yellow l'iue Stations 1 near the parallel of Castleton. For extending this scheme northward, and thus connect the survey of Lake Cham11laiu witll the primary series, and also provide a basis for meetiug prnspecti,·e requirements in regard to the determination of points in the interior, Assistant Uiclrnrd D. Cutts took the field at the end of June, 1874, and first occupiecl Perr_y's Peak, a point very little eastward of the boundary-line between Massachusetts and New York. As soon as practicaole, signals were erected Ly his aid, Mr. J. F. Pratt, on Greylock, on Yellow Pine Station, and on Mount Rafiuesque, but, owing to a succession of rainstorms, aug-ular measuremeuts with the theodolite were not completed at Perry's Peak until the 18th of August. Tue party was immediately trausferred to Yellow Pine, where the requisite observations were closed on the 21st of September. A few days after, tlie instruments were in position on l\ionnt Rafinesq ue. The summit was cleared to aiford an open horizon, and l\ir. Pratt was detached to set up signals at the outlying stations. By the 8th of October, observations to the southward ant.I westward were complete, lmt the signals on Mount Equinox, Greenwich, and Corinth Hills, which, by reason of distance, could be seen only under circumstances exceptionally fa\'orable, were entirsily hidden from view after tlw 20th by tlie haze of Indian summer. On the 23d of October, Assistant Cutts closed fiehl-operations for the season. Twelve signafs were erected and ohsen·ed on, and thirty-two horizontal angles were measured by lines of from 18 to 35 miles in leugtll. The heights of four stations were determined by vertical augles. The records, since rleposited in the office, include angular measurements made from the stations which were occupied, on prominent church-spires, for determiuing, in relati{'e positions, Troy, Ballston, Saratoga, Scl.Juylerville, and other towns and villages tllat could be seen from the mountain-stations. · At intervals when ti.le observing instruments were in transit, l\Ir. Cutts conferred personally at Cube Mountain iu reference to the interests of the work in progress at that station under tue charge of Professor Quimby, and also with Assistant Perkins, wllos<l work at Ragged :'.\fountain, on the coast of Maine, has been a subject of mention under tue llead of Section I iu this report. Arrangements are 11ow in band for completing the observations reqnisite at Mount Uafiuesqne. Latitude and azimuth at Rouse'1t Point, N. 1':-In the course of . the summer aud autumn of 1874, astronomical observations were made by Assistant G. ,V. Dean, at several stations between the United States boundary-line near Lake Champlain and Catskill Mountain I!ear the Huuson River. His party took the field early in August, .and first occupied ''Astronomical Hill," one of the stations used in the triangulation of Lake Champlaiu. The station is not far froin one of ti.le points occupied in 1845 by Major Graham, U. S. A., for establishing the bonudary-liue between the United States and Canada. :Finding in place several of the granite blocks on wllicll tbe astronomical instruments were adjusted in li!5, Assistant Dean made careful measurements, and noted the distances between them and l.Jis own station on Astronomical HilL 'l'ilere the latitude was determined from 176 observatious on 23 sets of stars with .zenith-telescope ::So. 4. Niue nights favorable for observing were occupied in this work. The am-value of the micrometer was found from 147 observations during three nights on Polaris near eastern elongation. Azimuth at Astronomical Hill was ascertained from the record of 86 ollservations with the 46-inch Transit No. 4 on lJ Ursre Minoris near its upper cuhninatiou, and an equal number on 51 Cephei near lower culmination, with lamps east and west. These observations iu the course of six nights were referred by 116 pointings apou a meridian-mark, which hatl been set up about half a mile north of the astronomical station. .A. meridian-line was traced 011 the G0\ erument reservation I amt Mr. Dean carefully marked th~ ends by drill-boles in. the tops of granite posts, . . which w.ere sunk four feet into the ground. The station occupied for lat.itude is about midway rn the meridian·line, and the position occupied by the zeuitb-telescope was marked by a gramte post similar to those plaood at the ends of the line.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

For local time at the station on Rouse's Point, Mr. Dean recorded 5V observations on 12 standard stars with the transit-instrument. The augle between the meridian-line and Windmill Point light-house was carefully measured with the 10 inch Garn bey theodolite No. G3 by means of 432 readings of the horizoutal augle. ()apt. David White, civil engineer, who was at .Fort :Montgomery while astronomical work was in progress, extended all the facilities at bis command to further the operations at House's Point. · Cheever Station, auout two miles north of Port Henry, N. Y., was occupied by Assistant Dean, in the middle of September, with the instruments which lrnd been used for latitude and azimuth determinations in Augnst. For latitude at Cheever, 168 observations were made on 21 sets of stars during th·e nights, and 9! observations were recorded for arc-value of the micrometer. Azimuth was determinecl as usual by an aggregate of 172 observations on six: nights; 120 pointings on a meridian-mark and 372 measurements of the horizontal angle were made for referring the azimuth-determinations to Station Whitford on a line of the triangulation. For local time, observations were repeated on seven nights. The work at Cheever Station was closed on tl.ie 6th of October. Ai;, soon as practicable, Mount Merino, near Hudson, N. Y., was occupied by Assistant Dean for similar determinations. There the latitude was found from 146 observations on 18 pairs of stars on six nights, and 135 observations were recorded for the value of micrometer-di visions. For azimuth, 77 observations were made on .t Ursro Minoris near upper culmination, and 60 on Polaris; and 16± measurements were made for connecting the azimuth-determinations with the mark. A signal-pole was set up on Catskill l\Iountain; but, tbongh the distance from Mount Merino was less than 12 miles, the signal was commonly obscured in the latter part of October and early in November by the haze then prevalent along the Hut.Ison Valley. ·Mr. Dean, however, ultimately referrell the azimuth.mark to the triangulation by 69G measurements of the horizontal angles between the mark and the signal-poles at Catskill Station and Mount Merino. Mr. A. G. Pendleton served as aid iu the astronomical party, and subsequently was engage1l in Section VII. Assistant Dean closed the work at Monnt Merino on the 14th of November. The original records of bis-observations ba\'e been duplicated iind deposited in the offict>, and the computation of results is now well advanced. The proprietor of Mount Merino, Capt. William J. Wiswall, afforde1l many facilities for the service of the party while the work was in progress at that station. Shore-line survey of Lake Champlain.-This shore-line survey was completed before the approach of winter, in 1874, by two plane-table parties, the work of which wasjoiued at a point not far below Ticonderoga. Assistant C. T. Iardella took the field early in May. After ma1iping in outline the islands known as "Four Brothers," he joined with previous work: on the east side of the lake at Paxton's Point and on the west side at Ligonier Point, and from thence extended the snrvey suuthwar<l. His work is on five sheets, which show the several harbors of the lake between Burlington and Crown Point. Amongst these are McNeil's Bay, Arnold's Bay, Gray's Basin and Rock Harbor, Northwest Bay, and Whalon's Bay. The roads in the immediate vicinity of the lake appear as details, and also the ·illages that adjoin the water-line. After completing the general sur·.-ey to the point designated at the outset of the season, Mr. Iardella made a detailed topographical survey of the vicinity of Crown Point on a scale sufficient to admit of marking in position the outline."! of all the fortifications and defensive lines that could be identified. Remembering that while interest in such remains is deepening, the objects the~Relves are wasting away and must soon disappear, it will be deemed a duty to include in topographical operations the mapping of localities that have been famous or noteworthy in our early history, when the places chance to be within the projected limits of work, as in the case here mentioned. Subassistant H. W. Bache was attached to the party of Assistant Iardella. Subassistant Andrew Braid, with a separate topographical party, took the field on the 1st of June. Beginning at a point agreed upon in conference, below Crown Point, the shore-line survey was extended from thence southward to include Whitehall. In the course of the operations, numerous points were determined for use in the hyd.rography, and tracings of shore-line were furnished as the work advanced. At Ticonderoga, Mr. Braid made a special survey, on a large scale,

of tlJe old fort and its vicinity. Traces of all the c]pfensfre lines and red-0ubts were carefully sought for and deli11eated. Contours of such as could lie identified were traced to show the grountl-elenttion as it now exists. Tbe walls of the ohl fort are crumbling r<tpidly, and, as the fragments arn passing awa,y in the bands of tourists, the spot must soon be left without any trace either of the ruin or of its foundation. l\fr. Braid fomlll that tile old French lines of 1758 were toleral.Jly well preserved in places; but, at the eastem limit of the works, the lines ba\·e ueen nearly oliliterated by tile plow.

Assistant Iardella during the winter conducted a plane-table party in Section IV. Subassistant Braid was at the same time in service which will ue mentioned under Section VIII. Hydrograplty of Lake Okamplain.-Within tbe plane-talile limits of the present year, the bydrography of the lake has been completed by a party under the charge of Mr. Charles Junken, working with the steamer Fa tho mer. Soundings were begun in Shelburne Bay in tbe middle or J Ulll', and were finished on the Gth of July, 1874· .After completing work in ·wmsboro' Bay, J\fr. Jun ken proceeded to Crown Point, and tllere resumed the general h;rdrographic snn·ey, all the waters north of that point haviug been pre\'iously sounded. Weatber being favorable, the work in going southward reached Ticorn.leroga by the Sth of August. During seYeral wf'eks succeeding that date, the charge of the hydrographic party de\·olved 011 Mr. E. H. \V_yvill, in consequence of the illness of Mr. Junken. Mr. G. A. Morrison served as aid. \York was steadily pushed until lbe 10th of October, when the sounding party bad passed Whitehall and completed tile b;5·drography of the Jakf', including at its southern limit the expansion known as South Bay, below Whitehall.

The results there found will be mentioned in Section V of this report. Survey of Hackensack Rfoer, N. J.-As far up as Hackensack, and in the lower part of English Creek, soundings were made in the river in 187::1, and the shores bad been previously traoed. In the middle of October, 1874, Assistant Gerdes commenced a plaue-table survey of the grOUDLl along both sides of the Hackensack, and extended the detailed topography eastward to tbe New Jersey Nortliern Railroad, which passes aloug the western edge of the Palisade Ridge. Most of the area surveyed is marsh, but it includes many patches of well-cultivated land, and is crossed by plank-roads, turnpikes, and railroads. This work was completed early in November.

survey of tlrnt region, Assistant Edward Goodfellow was directe!l to search for tl1e marks whiclt had lwen set in the grouml, aml thus to identi(v them as poiut.s used iu the general tria11gulatio11 of the coast. 'Vith t11e requisite office-daLa a111l descriptions or the stations, l\fr_ Gtiodfellow took the field in August, 1874, and, from a preliminary station ou lleacon Hill, o\.Jsen,ed upon five known points of tlte secondary triaugnlatiou. From one of these, at Elm 'J'ree Beacou, angular measurements were also made, tlrn purpose being to identify the pomt which had been occupied by the·, theodolite in a former year on Beacon HilL Having ascertained within close limits the locality iu which the early signal must have stood, Mr. Goodfellow next proceeded to Weasel, to search for the grourn}.rnarks. TLei;e he readily found Ly clearing the rock of eartL and moss which had gathered 011 it in the course of years since tlrn station was first occupied. After adjusting a signalpole over the point to be obsen'ed 011 from Beacon Hill, l\Ir. Goodfellow visited. that station, and, applying results gathered from angnlar measurements at the otllers, found, after due search, the stone cone which had lJeen burid there by Superintendent Hassler. This work was completed on the 18th of September, when descriptions applicable to the present condition of the stations were filed at tl1e office, with sketches to facilitate identificatiou of the points in future. l\Ir. C. A. Ins aided in the field-operations. In December, Assistant Goodfellow was assigned to duty under the direction of the assistant in charge of the office in ·washington. Plt:1Jsical si1r-rey o_f Ne1n rork Ha~·bor.-As far as practical purposes have demanded, this work has been pursued systematically. The harbor bas uudergone some changes since the early surveys were made, :md these alterations, with their causes, make the sul1jects of operations and studies at tllis time. IuciuentalJy, llowever, an investigation of the relations of the channels to lbe streams that traYcrso them is continued by Assistant Henry Mitchell, and is expected to show.at what points the old l)ier-lines are at fault, and the proper location for uew ones, not onl.v where faulty ones exist, but also in localities not yet occupied. The deepening of the Hudson below Castle Point, referred to in a previous report, naturally suggested an iuquir.v iuto the causes of the excavation and the disposal of the material removed. A glance at the earlier harbor-chart shows that this part of the river was originally of adequate depth for a11 the possible wants of navigation, and that the deepening is uot only no improvement, but im1llies injury elsewhere, since a very large volume of matfl'ial must ha>e been deposited in other parts of the harbor. It seems probable that the general occupation in later years of the New Jersey shore, and the erection of numerous wllarves, etc., on that side of the riYer, have restricted the former tlow, and that increased· scour has been thus induceil. The utilization of hitlierto worthless flats, even if some such consequenceR as those referred to must follow, is not necessarily inexpe.dient, but in the case under question a proper study of the natural conditions in advance of the erection of structures might have secured the community against undue sacrifices. The commission of UniteP, States oflicers, requested by the State authorities of New York to rectify the pier-lines of Brooklyn, owes its origin primal"ily to complaints against the extension of wharves beyond the pre\'iously adopted harbor-lines. That board, having no power to remove the extensions, which seem to have been made without any pre,·ious study or consultation in regard to their probable effect on the cbannels, was constrained to locate a new pier-line, more advanced than the old one, in order to mitigate the injurious eflect of the obstructions. Rei,earches iu the ph,Ysical survey ha,·e had direct bearing on the conclusions reached, and at times the obsen·ers in the party of Mr. Mitchell have rendered immediate service to meet the req nests of the board. Immediately after his return from Central America, Professor Mitchell arranged a projt>ct for farther operation~ in New York Harbor. The schooner Research was equipped anti ready for work· on the 8th of Jul~-. Assistant R. L. Marindin took charge of tbe party, and Mr. J.B. Weir sen·ed as aid. · In East River, Rix transverse curves of velocity were determined, both for maximum ebb and maximum floocl. These were compared, each with the profile of the section sounded out at the same time, and connected by tracing free floats, the courses of which were determined by many three-point positions.

Snbsequently, work in Hudson Hiver antl along the western part of the main channel of the h;ubor was taken np; four transverse CLu,·es were determined, ant! these were connected and extende<l by twenty.nine trips with free floats. Peculiar difficulties are offered. in tbe lludson. J\'fany stations are needful to give the tnw»verse curves of ''elocity, and, if not observed on simul· tancously, corrections cannot well be applied for yariations in the river.outflow. Part of the design in view is to draw isodsnamic lines thronglt tbe harbor.chart, and exhibit their relation to the submerged contours, especially where the bottom is yieldiug, but also where the flow is snlJOrdinated to the form of the channel. It is obvious that such a chart, if satif'faC· torily made, would show directly where artificial improvement of tbe channel will accord with, aud where it would violate, natural rules; which of the shoals were antecedent to the existence of the present currents, and which of the shoals resulted from these mo·ements-t!Je first belonging to the class of obstructions that can l>e permanently removed, the last· to the class of shoals that will at some future time re.appear. In the course of the work in New York Harbor, it bas become eYideut that observations in summer and autumn, which have been our working.seasons there; must be supplemented by obser. vations made in the spring, in order to find co efficients for the flood periods. Earnest call haYing been made for similar observations in Providence Harbor, notice of wbicll h:is been taken under the bea1l of Section I, the work near New York was closed on tl.ie 1st of Sep· tember, 11574. SulJsequently, the party was employed in special observations at the JHississipp delta. Hydrography of New York Bay.-During the month of Jllly, 1814, the party of Assistant F. F. Nes, in tbe steamer Ar~1go, was employed in sounding the parts of the lower bay which had not bePn reached in the operations of the preceding season. While that work was in progress, my atte11tion was asked to determine whether the barbor·dredgings for the final deposit of which cer· tain locaJities had been indicated were moving so as to lessen the depth i11 the adjaceut chanuel, an inquiry based apparently on the supposition that the barges of many contractors were all towe1l in accordance with the "permit" to the designated sites, an<l dischJ.trged withiu ti.le limit of deptli specified when the dumping.grounds were selected. Assistant )farindin being then in the Yiciuity, aud knowing the re<1uirements which were carefully inserted in each permit, soon observetl that barges were discharged elsewhere. ·while poiutiug out to Assistant Nes the signals used in th11 suney of 1873, which resulted iu selecting the place of deposit, Mr. Mariudin saw some barges depositing material in the cliannel at a positiou less than three.quarters of a mile f1om tlie .Fort Tompkins light·bouse. Tlieir movements in reaching the place, moreover, made it very likely that the "permit" to dump material orily in depths greater than six and less than tweh·e feet had been generally disregarded. Inquiries Ly some of ti.le members of the Board of Commi,.sioners of Pilots led to the same conclm;ion. 'Gnder tlie adYicc of Professor Mitchell, a resnrYey was made of \Yest Bank channel and dumpiug·ground by the party in the Ar::igo. Mr. Nes completed that work on the 24th of August, and then sent to the office the reconls of tbe bydrograpby and specimens of the bottom. Soundings were resumed in tbe ,-iciuity of Southwest Spit, and there the operations of the party were continued until the 10th of October, when the Arago returned to port, to be refitted for bydrograpbic service which will be mentioned hereafter. l\'faster H. 0. Handy, U.S. N., joined the ,·essel on the 13th of August, and assisted in the work in New York Bay.

Pidal observatimis.-The self-registering tide-gauge, though of the old form, in charge of l\Jr. I~. T.

ice, the observer foand it impossible to reach the tide-gauge. As heretofore, Mr. Bassett recorus the tides also with a box-gauge at Hamilton avenue in Brooklyn. Places have been selected at Saudy H0ok aml Throg's Neck for the estal>Iisbment of self.registering tide-gauges, and it is hoped that series of observations may be commenced at an early day. In the following extract, Lieutenant Hrtchcock mentions an act of noble daring by a member of bis bydrograpbic party, of the steamer Endeavor, at Jersey City, on the 25th of June of the' present year, when arrangements were in progress for transferring the parliy from that vessel to the 8teamer Gedney, and which is here cited as specially commendable: · "While on shore, Henry Rynders, seaman of this vessel, noticed a crowd, and on inq airy found that a boy in playing ball had accidentally fallen into a sewer, and that be had been swept under the street and beyond the reach of a rake, the only means tried in the course of nearly twenty minutes for his recovery. Rynders procured a rope, lowered himself into the sewer, found the boy, almost lifeless, about 15 feet from the opening, and brouglit him up." The rescue of the boy by a humane imriulse stronger tha11 any sense of personal risk was promptly noticed by the American Benevolent Life Saving Society of New York. The sih'er medal of the society, suitably inscribed, and a substantial token in money, awarded by the society to Henry Rynders, seaman, have been transmitted by its president, Ellwood Walter, esq., with a communication expressing the exalted motives that prompt such awards. Survey of Great Soutli Bay, Long Island, N. r.-This work was resumed by Assistant Charles Hosmer on the 23d of June, 1874, at Islip. In the CClurse of the season, the detailed topogr11phy was extended eastward along the upper shore of Great South Bay as far as Howell's Point.. Conformable to the same limits east and west, the strip of land bounding the south side of the bay was mapped on tlle plane-table sheet. Soundings were taken up at Nicboll's Point, where hydrographic work had closed in the preceding season, and were extended eastward to Howell's Point. Un the north side of tlrn bay, the survey includes PatchQgue and all artificial improvements now existing between the water-line and the railroad.

Snlmssistaut Il. M. De 'Vees was attached to this party, and l\Ir. J. J. E\·ans aided in the field-work. As nwans for transportation, Assistant Bache used a barge, which bas JlrO\·ed to be well adapted for conducting plane-tal>le operations in tlrn vicinity of shallow waters. It is expected that in the coming season the detailed topographical· sun-ey of the coast of New Jersey will t.e made continuous from Saudy Hook to a point below A.bsecom Inlet. Hydrography of Barnegat Bay, N. J.-Early in July, 1874, the party of Subassistant \Y. I. Vinal was transferred to the schooner Biuu. The vessel left Norfolk 011 the lltli of tllat month; but, owing to adverse winds, five days were spent in reaching the working-ground on the coast of New Jersey. Notice will be taken presently of the survey, which was immediately taken Ull, but in geographical order mention must be made of the work which was commenced on the 20th of .August iu Barnegat Bay. Duriug au entire month from the outset, sou11dings were prosecuted under great disadvantage, tile air being clonued by smoke from extensive tract;; of burning forest. By the Sth of October, howenr, the entire bay, which is abont 12 miles long and from 2 to [j miles wide, was completely sounded out. Ten stations ou shore were occupied for determining the positions of signals.

Snbassistant Vinal took up the bydrograpby of the entrance to Little Egg Harbor 011 the 20th of .July. The lines of soundings required, being outside, could be run only at intervals, during which the irregular "dry northeaster" was not \:>lowing on shore. No opportunity for advancing the work was lost, and by the 13th of August the llydrography of the entrance and approaches to Little l!Jgg Harbor was completed. While the work was in progress, the officers engaged in light· ltouse sel'vice renewed the buopi an<l mo,-ed several of them in position. All the positions, tl1irteen in number, were carefully determined hy Mr. Vinal, and are mnrked on his bydrographic-sheet. In this vicinity, he determined also the positions of three life-saving stations.

In going northwat·d in the steamer Bache, for service which ha;s been stated under the head of Se-Otiou I, Acting i\faster Platt passed, on the 19th of July, 1874, off Barnegat, a large spar, wl1icll seemed to projrct from a sunken wreck. Near the spar, the depth of water was tliirteeu fathoms, the light-house bearing north-northwest, and distant about nine miles. Prompt notice was given thl'ough the press in regard to this obstacle, which, for any period that tlrn wreck might hold the spar in place, would be highly dangerous to navigation. Triangulation, topography, and hyilrograpliy -in Delaware Ri1Jer.-This work was prosecuted at the request of the Light-Honse Board, to meet the requirements of that service for tile proper location of range beacons as aids to nal'.ig;ttion in the Delaware, near Liston's Tree, and also for entering the rnollth of tile Schuylkill. Of necessity, the hydrography of the channels was redseLl in both places, the channel into the Schn,ylkill having !men recently altered by dredging, wllile that near Liston's Tree was represented only by the soundings made many .rears ago. Ju order to provide the points requisite on laud, Assistant .J. A. Sullivan took the field on the 26th of April, and, with tile aid of l\ir. O. L. Gardner, soon identified the station.mark which bad been placed iu the ground at Port Peun as one of the points in the triangulation of Delaware Bay. Tile li1Je to Reedy Island light-house serv·ing as a base, suitable angular measurements were interpolat.ed, and

twenty-seven additional points were furnished for the use of the hydrographic party. These were determined by 1,440 observations with the theodolite. After providing the requisite projections, .Assistant F. F. Nes proceeded to Delaware City on the 19th of .April, and set up a tide-gauge there, and another at New Castle. At Collins' Beach, tidal observation were also recorded. "Lntil the 4th of May, the party was employed in erecting signals, uuller the disadvantage of continuous bad weather. The light-house steamer Violet,-, assigned as means for transportation, was soon withdrawn umler an exigency of the service, but was replaced a week afterward by the cutter Rose. During that interval, Assistant Nes prosecuted soundings with a small boat. Progress in the work was very sati1>factory after tl1e middle of May, and, in the course of the following week, the hydrography of the channel was compl~ted. Positions for range-lights were then selected, tripods were erected oYer the points, and lines. of soundings were run between the tripods on tLe selected ranges. The least depth found on eithe1· side of the range was twenty feet. In this service, ::\fr. Nes erected twenty-two tripod·signals, and carefully determined tho positions of seven buoys.

The party assigned for revising the hydrograpby at the mouth of Schuylkill River was placed in charge of Mr. Charles Junken, who conferred immediately with General· ltaynolds, the lighthouse engineer at Philadelphia, and commenced work on the 30th of April. Mr. Junken used tlle plane· table for tracing the shore-lines of the lower part of the Scbu;ylkill and of the adjaceut p~ut of League Island. By the same meant>, he determined in position a number of poles placed at low· water mark, each being the end of a subsequent line of soundings. As the work advanced, tlie soundings reduced to mean low water were plotted on the chart. The result shows that a depth of 19~ feet can be carried into the month of tlle Schuylkill and up to Penrose Ferry Bridge. Positions for the range-lights were then nmrked by tripods on the grouncl. On the lltb of May, General Raynolds went on board of the Iigl1t-bouse cutter Rose, and passed into tlle Scbuylkill by the ranges as marked, finding a depth of 20 feet on the bar. Sound. ings above tlle bar, however, developed the existence of some obstruction, which subsequently proved to be a sunken coal.barge, and near it a pile of stone, probably the discharged ballast-of a ·vessel. These obstructions were marked on the chart, copies of whicll have been furnished for the uses of the Light-House Board.

Special .~un-ey of Cta11ey bla.nil, Yff.-,Yhile Assistant J. \Y. Donn was yet engaged in arrangements for resuming fidd-work on the James Uiver, request was made l>.r the chief of the Orduance nureau of the Navy Department, Capt. \V. N. Jeffers, for a minute topograpliical surve.r of the ground of Craney Island, abm·e tlie low-water shore-liue. This and similar calls of course ha·e in view such delineations of surface as will meet all possible requirements in engineering operations. At Craney Island, tlie earthworks thrown up iu 1861 were fouud by Mr. Donn, in December, 18i4, as broken irregular mounds, hillocks, and ridges. He developed tbe entire surface of the island by contours, to show each successhre foot in verticfll height of the ground abO\·e the low-water line, an(l mapped ti.Jfl features on a scale suitable for engineering purposes. The Ordnance Bureau ba\·ing defrayed the expenses incurred in this special survey, a copy of tlrn resulting map was transmitted to Captain Jeffers for the archives of the Navy Department. Field-work at Craney !&laud was concluded by Mr. Donn in the tllird week of December. His party then took up service whicb will be mentioned under the next head. Suppleme11tary 7ty(lrog1·apliy.-I~or the completion of the cbart of Elizabetb River, the si.Jallow passage between Craney Island and the mainland was sounded ont in August, 1874, and several Jines were added, giving additional soun<liugs in Elizabeth Hi 1-er near the western eud of' tlrn island. l\Ir. James B. Ba~·lor, who was detailed for this service, promptly turned in the resulting sheet, on which is the following synopsis of statistics:

Mr. Ba~·Ior had been pre\'ionsly engaged in Sections YI and VII. Tidal observation.~.-A self.registering gauge of the uew form, with large interchangeable cylinders, reading-box, and clock with a ualance-wheel, is now in operation at Fortress Monroe, in charge of the observer, Mr. \V. J. Bodell. The record of tides at this station bas been much irupron~d by substitutiug the time-keeper now in ns8fo1· tlie pcndnlum-clock, which, in rough weather, was liable to stop, aud thus occasion hreaks in the tidal register. Burney of the Oltickahominy Rfrer, Ya.-In the preceding season, this work i.Jad beeu extendc(l from the mouth of the river upward to 81.Jip Yard. Assistant Donn there resurneJ the survey in the latter part of December, 1874, with bis party, in the schooner Scoresby; roughness of the weather making it inexpedient to undertake operations in the broad waters of J amcs River at that period· The triangulation of the Chickahominy was continue.a from the point gained in the general work of the previous season, and was carried to the head of navigation. Sttbseqnently, the topography was mapped to represent a margin about one mile wide on either bank, and as far up the stream as the old English cut or canal at Forge Bridge. The river was sounded within the same limits. 1\Iuch inclement weather and the unusual thickness of ice in the ri"ver made this service difficult, but.the work was finally accomplished in March within tlle limit ot' time assigned for its completion. The Scoresby was then immediately passed into the James Ri,·er for further service. In the Cbickabominy, the tides were recorded at Mount Airy and Window Shades for short }leriods; and, for an entire month, all the high aird low waters were recorded by means of a tide-gauge at Graves' Landing. Surt~ey of James River, Va.-When the work described under the prect>ding head was closell, the severity of the season had remitted. Good weather fo1lowcd iu April and .M:ay, and, under fa'l'"orab1e circumstanceB, .A.ssistant Donn resumed the detailed survey of the James l{irnr at Sloop Point. As the work advanced toward Uity Point, the details of topograplly were mapped to rl'present a margin of the usual width on eacll side of the river; and, of the several branches of the ri'l'"er within tile limits of the survey, the shore-line and adjacent topography were included. .All

tlrn creeks not too shallow at the P.ntrance to admit the boats of the Scoresby were sounded generall~· by lines along the axes of their channels. The t.Tork was extended up tlie James Ith' er as far as means aYailable for tbe season won Id allow, and was closed for the fiscal year on a line from the middle of Eppes Island to the terminus of the railroad ou Cit.Y Point. The tides wer<' obsen·ed by means of temporary gauges at Brandon Point, Dunmore Wharf, and Wilcox's \'\'harf. At Jordan's Point light-house, ench recurrence of high and low water was recorded during twenty-six cousecutiye days. The datum-planes of the gauges from Brandon to Jordan's Point were connected by a line or levels run at intervals during ~pril and May. Assistant Donn was aided in :field-work in this section by Messrs. F. C. Donn, F. H. Parsons, and C. A. Ives, and, after February, also by Mr. D. 0. Hanson.

JJ!.agnetic ob.~erMtions.-At the standard station, on Capitol Hill, Washington, D. C., observa tions for the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were made, in June of the present year, l>y Assistant Charles A. Schott. This is the eighth year in the series of determinations by the same observer. 'Ibe uiscussion by Mr. Schott, and conclusions reached in regard to the magnetic elements at the station on Capitol Hill, were given in my last annual report. Triangulation in Virgiltia (Sketch No. 8).-For extending southward the primary triangulation which crosses the Potomac in the vicinity of Washington City, Assistant A. T. Mosman took the field on the 10th of Juue, 1874, and occupied Mount Marshall iu Rappahannock County, Va. The month of June was spent in Yisiting and adj t1sti11g signals at the stations of the main triangulation as the-y were left in 1871. Observations for horizontal angles were begun with a new 14-iuch theodolite at Mount Marshall early in July, l>nt progress in the work was much hindered by haze, so that angular measurements from that station on eight primary, two secondary, and twel\'e tertiary signals were not completed until the 8th of September. Vertical angles were measured on eight of the outlying stations. The summit of Mount Marshall is 3,850 feet above the sea, and is so difficult of access that· Mr. Mosman of necessity pitched the camp of bis party about six hundred feet below the observing-station. The close of operations there was followed by several weeks of rainy or thick weather, in the course of which the party and instruments were transferred to Fork Mouutaiu in Madison Oounty. Between the 12th au<l 21st of Cctober, a few observations were secured an<l recorded at that station ; but generally then, and continuously afterward until the 20th of NO\·ember, the atmosphere was so smoky that monntains o~ly ten miles off could not be seen in outline. The party, however, though under much hardship, remained, and recorded angular measurements at all favorable moments, until the 26th of December. For some weeks, Fork Mountain and the neighboring summits had been covered with snow and ice, and communication between the party at tbe station and the lower country was cut off for days at a. time. The field-records show that angular measurements were made from Fork Mountain on ten primary, three secondary, and twenty-one tertiary signals, and that differences iu height \Vere measured by the micrometer on twenty-one outlying stations. Pour heliotropes were used for determining the direction of the longest lines in the triangulation. The party was disbanded on the 31st of December. During the next three months, Assistant Mosman, and his aid, Mr. D.S. ·woleott, were employed in computing results from the records of field-work, April and May

The party was tlien transferred to Spear Mountain, at which the work prosecuted will be made the subject of notice in my next report. At Humpback, the differences in lleight between that and four other stations were determined by means of the vertical circle. Owing to tile difficulty of access, the observer's tent was of necessity four miles distaut from the station, a cowJition adding mucl1 to the labors of the party in this region. Reconnaisimnce.-For the extension of a chain of triangles westward from points in the series which passes southward along the Blue Ridge in Virgiuia, Assistant S. C. l\IcCorkle took up the work of reconnaissance in the middle of July, 1874. TI ump back Mountain and the primary station at Fork ]\fountain being apprornd as st,u·ting-[Joints, M:r. l\IcOJrkle visited Elliott's Kuo\); in connection with it, afterward selected a station in Rockingham County at State Spring; and from thence passing into Pendleton County, he examined the country from tile summit of Panther Knob. Several mountains in Ilighland <Jount.r were visited, and Paddy's Knob was selected as a station. Tllis is on the Alleghany Range, and near the corner of Bath and Highland Counties. Subseqnent1.v, positions were examined near Covington, and others in the southwest part of Pocahontas County and on the borders of Summers and Greenbrier Ouuuties. Iu the region of the Kanawha, points were examined on Sewall Mountain and Ganley Mountain. In F1iyette Connty, Payne's Mountain was selected, aml, visible from it, a point in ~icholas County, west of Smnmers\·ille. Toward the Ohio River, the elevations arc less, some being twch'c hundred and others uot more tlrnn e1gbt hundred feet above the general level of the regiou. The results of this reconnaissance make it probable that a good scheme of triangulation is praeticable between the Shenandoah range of mountaius and the Oltio Ri\·er. Assistant McOorkle's report was accompanied lJy a sketch showing the approximate positions of stations which had been found intervisible, atul notes iu rega.rd to loc.tl facilities and means of transit from place to place.

Triangulation of Pamplico S.>und, N. C. -A'i mentioned in my report of last year, this work l1as been prosecuted continuously lJy the party under the charge of Asi>istant G. A. Fairfield, and is now completed. Early in the fiscal year, the station at Stumpy Point was occupied, but observations there were long delayed in consequenca ot' the volume of smoke brought from the bumiug pines of the Dismal Swamp. Mr. Fairfield completed tlte angular measurements at that station on the 25th of November, 1874, and then transferred bis party in tbe steamer Hitchcock to G11H Island, where observations were continued until the l!.lth of February of the present year, through the coldest and most stormy season yet experienced in the sound. In tlrnt interval, a ho:tt's crew, sent to Newbern for the mail-matter which had accumulated, nearly perished; but, though coated with ice an inch thick, the men were safely landed at the mouth of Ne11se Ri\'er by tho energy of l\ir. T. G. Dixon, sailing master, who was in charge of the cutter. While observations were 1n progress at Gull Isfand, Mr. B. A. Colonna, aid, was sent to Cape Hatteras, and there determined the position of the old light-house, and chained the distance between it and the new strncturt>. The positions of both, relative to the beacon-light, were determined by angular measurements. On the 20th of February, a station on the eastern side of Pamplico Sound was prepared at Pea. Island. Assistant Fairfield visited the light-house at Roanoke Marshes, but found the structure H. Ex. 81--5

an<l the ground anywhere near it too unstable as a place for the theodolite, and of necessity established a station on the west margin of H.oanoke Island, at a point nearly three miles northeast of the light-house. Angular measurements at the st~Ltion (named Sand Island) were completed on the !..l5th 0f l\Iarch. Subassistant Colouna and 1\lr. W. B. Fairfield, aid, were then detailed to make the observations at Pelt Island, an<l completed work there on the 19th of April. The only anchorage for the steamer in that vicinity lJeing much exposed, the party Ii ved in camp while at-, l'ea faland. .Next in order, the· north and south ends of the baso lino at liodie's Island were occupied with the theodolite by .Mr. Colonna, and horizontal angles were measured upon the three signals in view, connecting that base with the triangulation of Pamplico Sound. One of the granite monuments set to mark the south end of the line had been overturned and broken within the past teu years, but was again replaced by Mr. Colonna, and securely marked. After completing the triangulation, Mr. Fairfield determined the positions.of two of the new light-houses erected within a few years as aids to navigation in the waters north of his locality of work. A signal was erected, and three stations were occupied for ascertaining the position of Uroatan light-house. The structure now in course of erection at Currituck Beach was also determined in position. 11'inding by examination that known points were not available for determining the lights at 'Yade's Point, North River, aml Pasquotank River without additional fieldwork, the party in the steamer Hitchcock was recalled from this section in the middle of June, and proceeded to Baltimore, where the vessel will be refitted for other duty.

To1io!J1·aplty of Pamplico Sound, N. C.-Iu the field operations of the fiscal year 1874-'75, the shore-line survey of Pamplico Sound was completed by a party nuder the direction of Assistant C. T. Iardella, who resumed work in this section with the schooner Daua on the 7th of December, 1874. Commencing at Long Shoal signal, and as data for the immediate uses of the hydrngraphic part.y, in the steamer Arago, the shore-line was carpfu]Jy traced as far as Hog Island. In the same direction, the survey was then prosecuted to a junction at Juniper Bay, with the field-work done in a previous year. Resuming again at Long Shoal signal, l\lr. Iardella extended the survey northward, and joined on the 14th of May with a plane-table sheet of the year 1864, showing details of the shore in the vicinity of the light-house at Roanoke :Marshes. The three planetable sheets returned to the office by Assistant Iardella show several small bays on the west side of Pamplico Sound. In reference to their importance as harbors for local trading-vessels, the following remarks are made in the field-report: "We8t Bluff Bay, two miles wide, with good anchorage in ten feet, is a safe harbor for small vessels in all except southwest winds. East Bluff Bay is also a saf'e harbor, excepting in heavy southeast weather." "Yesocking Bay, the entrance of which is sheltereu by Gull Shoal, receives vessels drawing eight feet, that load with corn and cattle brought down in scows through the canals that traverse the adjacent country." "Long Shoal River is two miles wide at its entrance, and four miles long. Vessels can anchor in twelve feet and be safe in an winds; but as yet the shores are not occupied, the nearest habitations beiog fifteen miles from the river."

Finding that the islands near Roanoke lHarshes light-house had been waslled ancl lesaencd hy
the action of the wat-0r in the course of the last teu years, Mr. Iardella resurveyed their shore-lines,

and mapped them in relation with the shore-line of his upper plane-table sheet. The abrasion observed principally affects the islands on the side which is exposed to the open water of the sound. Hydrograplly of Pa.niplico So1md, N. 0.-The progress made in the course of the fiscal year by J,ieut. IL 0. Ilandy, U. S. ~.,has advanced toward the completion of the hydrography of Pamplico Sound. His party, in the steamer Arago, left Baltimore early iu December, 1874, and by the middle of that month reached '\Vashington, N. C. Signals were set up without delay ou the shores of Yesocking Bay, the shores of whicll had been traced by the plane-table party, as stated nnd<>r the last head. Lieutenant Handy established a tidal station at Pamplico light-honse, and there bad observations recorded while the soundiDgs were in progress. The work closely occupied the party in the Arago from the Uth of January until the 27th of l\fay, when operations in this section were closed for the season. The steamer Arago then sailed for New York, and made preparation for prosecuting supplementary soundings on the coast of Xew Jersey. For hydrograpllic work on the west side of Pamplico Sotrnd, opposite to Hatteras Inlet, eighteen large signals were erected, and nine stations on shore were occupied.

Topograplty of Burrs Ba:y and vicinity, S. C.-In continuation of the work of tl1e preceding season, Assistant W. II. Dennis, with bis partJ·, in the schooner Caswell, resumed field-operations on the 20th of December, 1874, at a point about a mile below Cape Romain. From tbeuce the cletailed survey was extended southward and westward, and at the close of the working-season itt this section was joined at Sullivan's Island with the limits of a sun1 ey made in 1854. Soundings were made as the topography a<franced, and these, plotted on separate sheets, show the bydrography of the inside water-passages within a stretch of thirty-two miles eoastwise. The two planetable sheets represent the shores of Bull's Bay, including the surface· features adjacent to Harbor niver and Five Fathom ()reek; Bull's Island, Caper's Island, and J>rice's Inlet, wl.iich separates them; Dewees' Island a.nd Long Island, separated by Dewees' Inlet; and generally the topographical feat1ues between the coast-line and the main public road passing from Georgetown to Charleston, S.

Sea-encrorwhment at Hunting Island, S. 0.-The topographical features of the north end of Hunting Island, which were mapped in the careful survey of 1850, could all be recognized some years after that date. Altout the year 1Sli7, however, the sea, urged by a violent gale, broke through the beach opposite to a small creek near the site of tile old light-house, and during f\ubseqnent years the encroachment has not ceased. Iu order to determine the amouut of change, Mr. Charles Junken was detailed at the end of Jmie of the present year to make a careful resurvey of the north end of the island. The results show that since 1850 the ii.rm land of the north end to the extent of two-thirds of a mile has been washed away, and a channel with six feet of water at low tide now tra'\erses a part of the island tliat was thea covered with large trees. This channel, moreover, being bounded by au extensive saud Nhoal, that replaces what was formerly the north end of the island, is now the outlet of Johnson's Creek. · Mr. Junken found by examination that tlie other channels into Saint Helena Sound haYe not been influenced by the wearing-away of the north end of Hunting Island. Some changes ha'\e occurred in the main ship-channel, but only such as to make it expedient to re-arrange the buo,vs. As soon as practical>le, the llydrography of the vicinity of Bunting Island will be examine(]. Rydrograpliy of Savmmah River, Ga.-In my preceding report, mention is made of ·the shoreline snnrey of Savannah Hiver, and of an examination of tlle currents, made at the request of tlle city authorities of Savannah, and important as the basis of plans for impl'oving the channel. l\leans not being available for conducting the hyc.lrographic resurvey at the same time, that wol'k was deferred until the present season. Lieut. J. l\I, Hawley, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, with his party, in the schooner G. M. Bache, sailed from Brooklyn, N. Y., on the 19th of December, 1874, but, in consequence of much bad weather on the passage and continuous rain after reaching S<tvannah, found it impracticable to commence operations until the 20th of January. A tide-gauge was established at the outset, and the record of high and low water was ke1lt up until the 8th of May, when the soundings were completed. The limit of the hydrography abo·e is the upper end of Elba Island. From thence, down the stream, the river was sounded thoroughly to the bar; the bar was developed and souutlings were extended eastward to a line about a mile outside of Tybee light-house. The weather until April was very uufavorable, seldom affording an entire day for lJydrographic operations. In refen~nce to the changes revealed by his soundings, Lieutenant Hawley remarks: "I found the channel of the river in general but little changed since 1866, as shown by tile Coast Survey chart of that year. The shoal off the lower end of Elba. Island, between Basket Beacon and South East Beacon, bas increased slightly, and, as a result, the width of the channel is there somewhat reduced." ''The large shoal off Oockspur Island bas grown in the direction of the channel." H In the channel uredged east of Oyster Reef by the United States engineers, the depth at mean low water this season is between twelve and thirteen feet." "During tl1e spring, owing to freshets, the current was so strong as to overcome the flood tide entirel_r, and it w:is noticed that vessels did not swing to the flood, except when at anchor in Tybee Roads." "Many of the pile obstructions placed in the river during the late war still remain, r.nd impede the downward passage of alluvial matter."

Coast hyilrography near Saint Au;JUstine, Fla.-In previous operations by the party in the steamer Endeavor, the inshore h.vdrography of the eastern coast of Florida h ·Hl been advanced to a line about miclway between Fernandina and Saint Angnstinc. At the opening of the workiugseason of the last fiscal year on the northern coast, Lieut. R. D. Hitchcock, U.S. N., assistant in the Coast Sun'ey, after passing a short period at the office in noting methods and processes applicable for hydrograpbic work, joined the party iu the EndeaYor, and assistetl in ser\·icc alloat, as was stated under the head of Sectiou I in this report. In December, 181±, the vessel was refitted at, New York under the supen·ision of that officer, and, l.Jefore the close of the month, his party was in elfoctiYe working order on the coast of Florida. Aoove Saint Augnstine Entrance, souudiugs were resumed on tbe 2d of February, a11d the work was extended southward until the 10th of Jun!', when operations were closed for the season at l\latauzas lulet. From t,he shore-line to seaward, the coast-approaches were developed to an aYerage distance of about uine miles. In crossing the approaches to SaintAngustine Harbor, whicl.J. \¥as about midwHy in his project of work, Lieutenant Hitchcock found that the channel leading into that harbor had i1nproYed. A cart>ful examination was made and a depth of ten feet at mean low water was found on the bar. The course of the channel at the entrance changes in accordance with the direction and force of the storms in that vicinity; 11ence the sa!ling-directions pre.pared by Lie.a tenant Hitchcock, and which were issued from the office iu January, enjoin that strangers should not attempt to cross the bar without a pilot. For prosecnting the inshore hydrography, se,·e.nteen signals were erectccl at iuter\'als aloug tlie coast above and below Saint Augustine. Four stations were occupiecl on shore while soundings were in progress. Surface-currents were obserrnd generalls within the limits of work, an<l the tides were re.corded at Saint Augustine while bydrogra.phic operations were in progress. The general Rtatistics are :

C. Nye, and J. I,. IIansicker, U.S. N., were attached to this h_ydrographic party. In March, Lieutenant Hitchcock, noticed from the deck of the steamer Endeavor, when about two miles and a half off shore and a little to the nortllward of }fatanzas Inlet, a curious agitation at the surface of the water, which seemed to indicate the existence of a spring issuing from the bottom at a spot where the depth was fountl to be 21 fathoms. Near by ancl all around the place at which the action was so violent tliat the ship was tbrowu off, the depth was 9 fathoms, and the agitation at the surface was noticeable only within a circle of about 30 feet in diameter. Tile specimen of bottom brought up by a cast of the lead showed very clean, brolrnn, small shells, but, 110 instruments being at hand for special obserrntions at that time, the steamer passed on ber course. On the 8th of A.1>ril, the Endeavor was anchored at tl.Je same place, but no sign of ag-itaiion appeared in the water. It was noticed, bowever, t.hat, at interYals of a few minutes, the water within the space of a fow square feet, became bright yellow, and coincidentl_y gare off a ,·ery strong

odor of sulphureted hydrogen. Blue mud and shells were found in twenty fathoms near one of the _yellow patches, all of which took color quickly, [Jud, after liberating gas as quickly, disappeared. Next day, the surface was found iu motion like boiling 1vnter, all being yellow within a circle of 30 feet, and giving· off sulphureted hydrogen. The yellow water seemed to rise as in clouds from the bottom. Owing to haze, which obscured the signals on shore, the exact position of tlrfl spot could not be detnmined at either of the visits so far noticed; hut, on the 30th of April, several hours of continuous calm and clear weather sufficell for its accurate determination and for :securing :specimens of the water and of the bottom. The odor emitted and the great agitation were on that day the same as had been previously observed, but the water was not in the least discolored. It was flanked to windward by white caps, giyiag it the appearance of a shoal, and it now appears that the place has been sometime avoided as such. While the water is agitated from the bottom, pieces of shells are t.hrown up from tile center of disturbance, wbich seems to have a greater depth than any other spot in that dcinity. Tile surronmliug lines of soumliugs, crossing the place in all directions, give an average depth in the vicinity of 9 fathoms, with 21 fathoms in the small "boiling SJlot." Sun1ey of Halifax River and eastern coast of Florida.-At a point ten miles below Mosquito Inlet, the detailed survey of the eastern coast of Florida was resumed in November, 1874, b.v Assistant Charles Hosm(~r, with a party in the sloop Steadfast. Above that point, the field-work was then continuouis to Saint Augustine, but soundings had not been made to include the lower part of Halifax River and Hillsboro' I~iver. l\Ir. Hosmer completed the hy<lrograplly of botll, and pushed the detailed surve.r from Turtle }fouud soutllward abont twenty-five miles along the Atlantic coast, including, in bis limits of work, the shores and wide expanse of water at the bead of Indian Hiver and the adjacent part of Mosquito Lagoon. The body of water last named was sounded out, and the detailed survey includes also the topography of its shores. Finding it impracticable to pass the sloop Steadfast through the " H atdover,'' a short canal projected :some )"ears ago for connecting Indian River with the inland water-passage to Halifax River, tile vessel was transferre<l by land oYer the barrier at reasonable cost, and was laid up at the end of May in Iudian River, to be available for .prosecuting the work southward to Jupiter Inltit. As a check on the triangulation done by his party, Assistant Hosmer measured a base of verification on the neck of land which divides Mosquito Ijagoon from Indian River, and immediately north. of the Ilaulover Canal. The line is near!_}' 2,300 meters in length, and tlle measurement was found w be in near accord with the length as computed through the triangulation. 1:5ubassistaut L. B. Wright was attached to this party, and mainly conducted the soundings. Assistant Hosmer was aided also by Messrs. J. De \Volf and T. A. Ilarrison.

of l\farch, a base-line was measured on Loggerheall Key, and from it angnlar measurements were recorded 011 te11 signals, to include in position all the ·keys aud the reef to the soutlnrnrd of the light.house on Garden Key. The triangulation. was close(l at a check-base on East Key. In this work, Mr. Ogden noticed that, although tlle theodolite was mounted as usual on stubs of wood driYeu eigllteen inches deep in the coral sand, the instability of the sand was such that an:y lateral movt'ment by the observer caused a perceptible change in the pointing of the telescope. Observations were recorded by .Assistant Ogden for azimuth, bnt under c1isadvautages arisingfrom the prevalence of high winds during the short period a'rnilable for tl.1e work at the Turtugas j J>oJaris beiug, moreover, at elongation near sunset and sunrising. The plane-table sheet returned by Mr. Ogden shows in detail the seven islands in the Tortugas group, of which Loggerhead Key is the largest. Fort Jefferson, on Garden Key, affords a good landmark, and the harbor is well protected by tile outlying reefs. Nor th Key, Northeast Key, and Southwest Key, as represented on old maps, have no existence now, not being bare even at low water. Bird Key, East Ke.r, and Loggerhead are partly cornred with a growth of cedar. The others, excepting Garden Key, are merely sand banks, of whicll the outlines change with almost ewry gale. Acting Master Platt, with his hydrographic party, in the steamer Bache, effectively co-operated. iu means for the triangulation and topography. :For the uses of the sounding party, l\Ir.

The work conducted by that officer will be noticed in my next report. Survey of Tampa Bay, Fla.-For extending the triangulation, and prosecuting the topographical and bydrographic survey, Assistant II. G. Ogden bad his party iu readiuess earl.Yiu November, 1874; but, as yellow fever then prevailed along the \Vest Florida coasi;, the schooners Speed well and Agassiz were not moved into Tampa Bay until the midule of the mont!J. following. The last-named vessel was placed in charge of Sabassistant Joseph Hergesheimer, and was pro,·ided with means for sounding the waters within the limits of field-work. The triangulatiou was resumed at Point Pinelos, and was extended northward to include old Tampa Bay and Hillsboro' Bay. Of old Tampa Bay, the shore.Jines were traced and the planetable survey was completed, leM·ing for the operations of another season the detailed survey of the shores and soundings in Hillsboro' Bay. In preceding seasons, the hydrograpby of the main body of Tampa Bay had been advanced aboye the entrance on the Gulf, ancl upward to Gadsden's Point. Mr. Bergcsbeimer took up in February the hydrography of Palmasola. Bay, Terraceia .Bay, Little Manatee River, and Bishop's Harbor, and in those waters completed soundings by the middle of March. After that date, and

until the close of the season, his party was employed in the bydrography of Tampa Bny, in whicl1 soundings were also completed. Assistant Ogden left Egmont Key on. the 1:!th of :March for service which hns been noticed nuder a 1ncceding hea<l. Heturning in the latter part of April, he conducted the se>eral branches of work in the survey of Tampa Bay, and closed operations on the 31st of May. The two vessels were then moved to Manatee, and there the bands who bad been, employed in the vicinity for the season were discharged. Tlie schooner Speedwell was di~patcbed on the 10th of Juue for Baltimore, and was there refitted for other work. Assistant Ogden was efficiently aided in the triangulation by J\Ir. B. F. North. The plauetable work was prosecuted by Mr. D. B. 'Vainwright, and is contained on four sheets. Subassistant Hergesheirner was aided in the byclrographic survey by Messrs. G. A. Morrison and W. B. French. At the outset of the season, this party assisted in erecting signals 'for the triangulation. Tides were obser\'ed at five stations wllile tbe sounding8 were in progress, the results found by each of the tide-gauges being referred to a bench-mark at Egmont Key. Soundings made this season de\·clop in position a number of shoals and rocks in 'l'ampa Bay. About two miles south· west of Gadsden's Point, the steamer H. M. Cool was wrecked, in the season preceding the survey, on a ledge of rock which Assistant Ogden's sun·cy proves to be several acres in extent, and marked by a number of sharp 1>eaks, on one of which the depth is only four feet at low water. The existence of this ledge was not known previous to the wreck here mentioned. During the early part of tlle season, tlle weather was very unfavorable for field-work in this section. After the 1st of May, squalls aml showers recurred almost daily, bnt less impeded the progress of the parties, as the boats were started at da_yligbt, and the min commonly foll only in the afternoon.

Field-work previously done by the party of Assistant Ogden l1as been mentioned under the bead of Section- II. Hydrography of Tampa Entrance and its Gulf approaches, Fla.-This work was commenced by Acting Master l{olJert Platt, U.S. N., with a party iu the steamer Bache, on the 18th of December, 1874, and was completed in the middle of the followiug March. Bad weather generally prevailecl while the survey was in hand. The steamer was very often stopped and anchored in consequence of fogs. Smoke along the coast and frequent winds also impeded progress in the 1:;oundings. The b,ydrograpl1ic sheet shows the depth of water and character of the Gulf approaches for fifteen miles abreast of Tampa Bay, and from the coast-line westwa1·d to a limit of about five miles. The two channels were developed, and also the outlying dangers. Acting Master Platt found on the North Bar 21 feet of water at low tide and 19 feet on the Southwest Bar. The channels are straight and plain, and the anchorage is safe an<l well protected from heavy gales. During the period occupied by the party in this surveyr there were no local pilots about Tampa Entrance, and no fresh water was to be bad nearer than Manatee River. Renewing supplies from a. point so far from the ground of work, of necessity delayed the prosecution of the hydrograpby. The statistics are:

Tbe stretch of coast included within the working limits of tltis party is low and marsby. On the ]and-side, the line of woods in some places is ouly a quarter of a mile from tlrn water-line; in others, tLe forest is a mile distant, and, except at J.Jigh tide, great mud flats impe<le the approach to the coast in boats. At scYeral places, four miles off sl10rt>, the depth is ouJ~· six feet at mean low water. Difficulties encountered by the party in prosecnt.ing tliis work are thus referred to in tl1e fiual report from the field: "The low flat woods, deroid of prominent feature8 distingnisbable at a tlistance, and consequent restriction in the placiug of signals fur angular weasurements, a witle barrier of deep, soft mud impeding at low water the movements of the sounding boats as well as transfers of the plane-table party, a11d the necessity of working waist-deep on the ornrflowed marsh, have called for the employ of uian,Y expedientis, lmt most of tlle lliudrnnces were such as to be oyercome simply by perseverance and endurance in tile party." As the first two mouths of tbe season were Yery unfaYorable, being, rainy, stormy, or foggy, tbe results of the work are eYidellce of constant energy. I<'our topogrnpltical s!Jeets returned from the party represent about seYenty miles of the Gn1f coast, aud, within a belt of Re\·eral wiles, the courses of numerous streams, amongst which are the Steinhatche~ River, :Fenhollowa~· River, Eco11feuee l~iver, and Ocilla River, the roads adjacent t-0 the shore, aud in detail the.intervening firm laud, wooded areas, and marsh.

Perkins reports that anchorage is goo(l in the offing, and, except near the points and capes, sullicieutly smooth for the Rafety of vessels in almost any weather. Shore-si:rnals being impracticable for the hydrography, tripods about thirty feet long were made of scantling, launched from the ve8sel at suitable position,; off shore, and properly weight,ed. Se\·eral signals of this kind were set in a day, aud determined by angular measurements, while the, soundings were in progress.

J. F. Pratt, F. W. Ring, and A. G. l'endleton. Jiydrograpliy 'llear Cape San Blas, Fla.-On the 8th of November, 1874, a b;ydrograpbic party, in the 8Choouer Silliman, was organized under the charge of Master Kossuth Niles, U. S. N., assistant in the Ooa8t Sune,v. As soon as practicable, the vessel was refitted at Jersey City, and arrived at .Apalachicola late in December. Continuous fog during seven days deferred active operations until the :.!d of Jammry. Insliore of Saint (}eorge faland, a tide-gauge was established at a station opposite to the ligbtbouse and another at West Pass. Mr. Niles, noticing a slight differe.nce in results, determined mean low water by day and nigilt observations for one month at the last-mentioned station, and applied the resn\t, as best suited for the adjustment of soundings to be made by his party. Two sheets were projected, to represent, when filled, the hydrography of the Gulf coast from Saint George light-house northward and westward to Saiut Andrew's Point, and including the Yiciuit_y of Cape San Blas and the sounding of Sai11t Joseph's Bay. Signals for the work were set up and determined iu January, when the weather was unfit for operations afloat; but, in the frequently recurring fogs of that and the mouth following, it was found expedient to observe with two theodolites at shore-stations while soundings were in progress. For the survey off the shoals off Cape Saint George, one theodolite was used at Cape Saint Heorge light-house, aud the second at a station 011 Saint Vincent Island. Subsequently, for de,,eJoping tl1e shoals off Cape San Blas, the instruments were used in conjunction at the cape light-house and at Iudian Pass. By taking ad\"antage of all favorable times, the hydrography was extended to Cape San Blas by the middle of April, and, with improved weather, the vessel was then anchored under the cape. Two observers were placed on· shore with theodolites, aud the shoals off the cape were surveyed. :May was favoraLle for hydrographic work, and dudng that month Saini Joseph's Bay was sounded. The level of mean low water there was derived from day and night observations, continued through two weeks at a tidal station on the west shore of the bay. Early in J nne, the bar was developed by soundings, and the bydrography of the Gulf coast was afterward extended to include the approaches of Saint Joseph's Bay, between Cape San Blas and Saint Ant'lrew's Point. The schooner Silliman returned to Apalachicola on the 26th of June. Masters H. 0. H.ittenhouse, .A lex. McCrackin, and H. W. Schaefer, U.S. N., rendered effective assistance in the hydrography, and their zeal and intelligence in the service are specially commended in the conclmling report on the operations of the season by Master Niles.

some days' hindrance from haze and smoke, were resumed on tbe 10th of Odobl'r, for the determination of latitude as well as for advancing tlw triangulation. On sm·en nig!Jts l'resious to the 4th of November, 161 obsen·ations were recorded with twenty-eight pairs of stars. Azimuth-observations were made s11bsequently, thirty sets of tweh·e repetitions, each being rPcor<lc!l for the value of the angle between Polaris and a signal at Coosa Station. Mr. J. H. Christian, ail1 in tlie part.y, made time-observations. Magnetic observations for declination, dip, and intensity were made at Pine Log Mountain by l\Ir. Christian and at La.-en<ler l\Iountaiu by Mr. Charles Tappan. The measurement of horizontal angles was completed at I,an·nder on the 31st of ,Tanoary. "\Yhile that work was in progress at favorable intervals, tlle time unsuitable for obsen-iug was occupic1l in computations for latitude, time, and azimuth, and iu duvlicating the field and astronomical records. .After the opeuiug of October, this season proved to be particularly unfavorable for operations, the prevailing haze of autumn being succeeded by continuous rains auu cold weather. Early in February, l\lr. \Vebber stored his camp-fixtures at R_ome, Ga., in ''iew of resumiug field-work with as little delay as possible in the spring. John's "Mountain, to the northward and eastward of La.-ender Station, was occupied hy the party early in .l\Iay of the present year, aud tbe obsenations were completed there in time to admit of the transfer of the party to Indian Mountain by the middle of June.

The advance of tlle work westward to a liue \Tithin view of Lookout .Mountain is there met by some difficulty in tbe likelihood, tbat, in order to pass that high ridge, it might be neces;;ary to occupy another station at its eastern approach, for the determination of Gulf Point and Brandon, two positions on the Lookout Mountain Raug e. a like difficulty was to be e:iq)eeted on t!Je western side of the ridge. Tbe question thus pending at the opening of the present season was committed to .Assistant S. C. Mccorkle, whose wmk will be mentioned under tbe next head. While employed at Lookout Mountain, Mr. Christian, aid, when overtaken by a tornado in June, was seriously injured by an uprooted tree wbicL was hurled against bim. Pri1nary triarig11lati-On (Sketch No. 9).-As stated in my report for last year, tbe party of Assistant c. 0. Boutelle was encamped in .lune, 1874, at Grassy Mountain, in Pickens Counts, Ga. The theodolite-station there being about 3,300 feet bigb, and thirty-five miles distant from any railway-station, arrangements for observing involver! much personal discomfort, and the labor incident to the construction of a road several miles long. Magnetic observations were recorded at Gras8y Mountain between the 12th and 31st of July. At the :same time, angular measurements were made on sen·n distant signals with the uew :.mci11cn theodolite, which Mr. Boutelle reports aR being sati!lifactory in regard to precision, and as saving much time in easy adjustment, due to the facilities afforded by the pecnliar construction of the iron stand of the instrument. Observations by zenith-distances for differences of level were made in the usual manner. .At Skitt !Iountaiu, which was next in order occupied, eastward of the preceding station, the measurement of horizontal angles and observations for magnetic declination and iuteusity were recorded between the 14th and 31st of August. Vurtical angles were measured for determining the relative heights of the outlying stations. .At this station, Mr. Boutelle noted also the approxi· mate direction of e.aclt of the prominent mountains that could be identified as means for correcting in future the State map. Twenty-six points, chiefly mountains, were thus added for such revision, exclusive of the stations occupied by his party for actual triangulation . .Assistant Bontelle transferred his party in the first week of September to Currahee }\fountain, Habersham County, Ga., and there established also an astronomical station. O!Jsen·ations for horizontal and vertical angles were begun at Currahee on the 17th of l::leptember, but their comJ>letion was delayed hy smoke until the 21st of ~o,·ember. Ten signals were obscrrnd ou. Thirty-

For latitude, 44 pairs of stars were ob8erved ll.Y the aids, Messrs. H. \V. Blair and J.B.

The three stations selected, mHl the signals at which were observed on from Ourrahee, are Paris, ..Mauldin, and Pinnacle in the mountain region of South Carolina. Iu May, the triangulation-party transferred the instrurneuts to a station on Blood l'l'Ionntain, whel"e observations were in prngress at the close of the fiscal year, June 30, 1875. Reconnaissance in Alabama.-In ad\·auce of resuming triangulation for determining points westward of those last occupied in the, vicinity of the base-line near Atlanta, Ga., Assistant McCorkle was assigned to select statious that would connect properly with the work of Assistant 'Vebber at Lavender and John's Mountain. Crossing the State boundary of Georgfa, the examination for stations was continued in Northern Alabama as far as Aurora in the northwestern part of Etowah Oounty. 1rhis point is more than a hundred miles distant from the Atlauta base-line. Signals are now iu place on Brandon and Gulf Point, intermediate between Aurora and John's Mountain, which last-named point was occupied by the party of Assistant \Yebber in the latter part of the present fiscal .Year. Assistant H. Andersc.n accompanied Mr. l\lclJorkle on the reconnaissance. The region through which he passed affords no facilities for comforts in tra\·el, and the service has in consequence been prosecuted under mnch personal discomfort. Ry the end of ,June, the examination was pushed as far west as La.Grange in the vicinity of Tennessee River. 'Vei;t of Lookout Mountain, and through the entire tract between the Tennessee line and a line near Montgomery, 1\ssistant McOorkle noticed evi· deuce of mineral resources. Mineral spl'ings were found in De Kalb, Saint Clair, and BlountCounties, and a white-sulphur spring noted for its qualities at Val Hermosa in Morgan County, Ala. Reconnaissance.-To meet requirements in the State of Kentucky for geographical points on: which to base the geological survey now in progress, Asiiistant R. E. Halter was assigned to the . field early in July, 187 4. After a personal conference with Prof. N. S. Shaler, State geologist, the examination was begun near Cincinnati. In adva.ucing up the Ohio Hiver, the country on both sides was included, but is reported as unfavorable for triangulation. Mr. Halter readily found a site suitable for a base-line, but no distant points were in view, and no scheme of triangles with sides of ordinary ll'ngth was found practicable. In exceptional cases, a line of sight ten or twelve miles long was found, coincident with the course of a valley; but, in general, the connecting-points wez:e only three or four miles apart. The reconuaiRsance was extended through Jackson, Pike, Scioto, Meigs, and Vinton Counties; and then south of the Ohio in the vicinity of Big Saudy Uiver, in parts of Carter, Boyd, and Lawrence Counties in tbe State of Kentucky; and through Wayne and Uabell Oonntfos in West Virginia. 'fbe region tran·rsed is hilly and heavily timbered, especially in KentucJ.y and West Yirginia, and affords no facilities for.tl.Je rea<ly transfer of instruments from station to station.

Mouths of the Mississippi.- With the Tiew principally of furnishing information for the commission appointed to examine plans for improving the outlet.s of the :Mississippi River, subsequently replaced by a boarrl of engineers appointed by the rresident of the United State!i, and of which board Prof. Henry Mitchell, .Assistant in the Coast Survey, is an associate member. bis party in the schooner lfosearch reached Pass a Loutre on tbe 12th of December, 1874. The illness of the sailing--mastflr, however, delay in the arrival of a substitute, calms on tbe passage Routh of Norfolk, and adverse winds, had consumed much of the time during which tbe commission awaited the co-operation of the party. Under advice of !\fr. Mitchell, who returned north when p1·eliminary deliberation was closed at tbe delta, Assistant H. L . .Marindin, and the aid, Mr. J. B. Weir, remained, and prosecuted physical resear(1hes during tbe early months of the present year with the party in the schooner. These operations, as far as then practicable with the means at hand, were closed in March, and the schooner Itesearch returned to New York. :Meanwhile, a special appropriation had been voted by Oongress for deepening the South Pass of the J\lississipi)i, and, to meet the prospective reqnircments of the board of engineers, Assistant Marindin was detailed to proceed immt>diately by land to the delta, and to hasten the return of bis vessel. Pending the arrival of the Researcu, tue physical hydrograpby was resumed and prost>cuted by 3fr. Marindin, with assistance afforded by Mr. Boyd, who detached from bis party the schooner Varina and a working force in charge of Subassistant .Andrew Braid. The schooner Research arrived at the delta on the 30th of .April, nnd, the party being thus re-enforced, observations upon currents, tides, and densities of water at the river-outlets were·pushed without intermission until the end of .June. Good observations were obtai11ed at the three passes, and notably at; South Pass, which will be valuable for comparison with series recorded as t_he work advances in the construction of jetties. These records, it is hoped, may furnish data for a physical history of the effects artificially wrought by expedients for deepening the water on the bar of the Mississippi. The preliminary report by Professor Mitche11 (Ap[lendix No. 11) describes the method by which he proposes to formulate the results of observation. At the Head_of the Passes, observations were made in order to show in what mauner the main stream separates as it approaches the passes, and the relation of the mud bank at the bead of South l:'ass in this distribution of the main stream into several channels. While weather was mifovorable for boat-work in the spring, .Assistant l\fariudin, aided by ~Ir. Rion Bradbury, occnpied the time efl:'ectively in setting up signals along- the shores of South Pass. After bis return, the shore-lines were carefully traced throughout, and subsequently the bed and channel of that pass were thoroughly developed by numerous souudings. An abstract appended to the field-report shows that the density of the water at the junction of the ~Iississippi with the Gulf of Mexico was testt>d by 203 observations. Amongst the details of the ph:ysical snrHy were determinations giving six profiles of sections, and currents along lifteeu lines were determined by free floats.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTEXDENT OF

Marindin employed, by tlrn courtesy of Capt. Ed. A. Freeman, the steamer John A. Dix, and a launch, temporarily assigned by the Navy Department, for lines of soundings off the bar. These lines radiate from the delta, and connect as inshore bydrograph:)· with soumliugs made off the delta by Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee. Under the immediate direction of Assistant Marindin, the special hydrographic survey at tqe Bead of the Passes was prosecuted by a party in charge of Subassistant lfraitl. As the prospective operations in engineering required, the ratio of discharge was determined by obsen·ations at the junction of Bayou Grande and South Pass witlt a view to the closing of the first-named outlet. )[r. l\Iarindin measured sections above Bayou Grande in South Pass, ah;o in tlie bayou, and in the pnss below it, and at each ascertained the discharge of water per hour on the 4th of June of the present year. The result showed tbat the diRcbarge through Bayou Grande' was twenty-two per cent. of the volume emitted by South Pass above the ba;you. In the pass below the bayou, observations were made also for set and drift of current. Sections were measured on the 22d of Juue at Cubitt's Crevasse and the Jump. The former is a breach 2,700 feet wide, and with a maxim um depth of 132 feet; but the water quickly shoals beyond the mouth of the crevasse, t11e depth in the course of a few hundred feet not being more than fixe feet at au average. When these observations were made, the surface of the river was about two feet above the extreme low-water stage. At the Jump, the section across measured 642 .1cet, and the maximum depth was 5Cl feet. The shore-lines of the pass with those of the Heacl of the Paeses, and the outline of lumps at the bar, were traced by means of the plane-table, and the statistics show an aggregate of thirty-four miles. At the Head of the Passes, Mr. Mariudin made sets of free-fioat observations on fifteen different lines, to determine locations for tbe spur-jetties proposed in the engineering operations of l\lr. Eads for diverting part of the water from either the Southwest Pass or Pass a Loutre into South Pass. After the close of work at the mouth8 of the Mississippi, at the end of June, the schooner Research underwent repairs, made necessary by exposure to the extreme heat in that month, and was then dispatched for New York. Assistant Marindin immediately eugagetl iu the computatioQs aud other office-work pertaining to the several operations of the physical survey. T1·auscripts of all tl1e data gathered in tl.Je physical survey will be forwarded at an early day to the War Department. HydrograpJ1y, Gulf nf Mexico.-Commander .John A. Bowell, U.S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, with the hydrograpbic party in the steamer Blake, left New York on the Gth of November, 1874, and in the course of a fortnight arrived at New Orleans. Under the direction of a board of commissioners, appointed by the President of the United States, to consider plans for improving the navigation at the mouth of the Mississippi, several weeks were emplo:)·ed by the hydrograpbic party in work outside the bars of the several passes, and in co-operating for tbe advancement qf the physical survey, respecting which an outline was given under the preceding bead. Commander Howell having been transferred by the Navy Department to duty in the Naval Academy at Annapolis, as stated under Section I, Lieut. Commander 0. D. Sigsbee, U.S. N., Assistant in the Coast t::!urTPy, succeeded to the command of the steamer Blake on the 12th of December. After that date, and until the 26th of April, the party was engaged in running lines of soundings outside of the :Mississippi delta in depths varying from ten to fifty fathoms. This work supplements the hydrogmpby which was prosecuted in the course of the ph_ysical survey. Twenty-seven lines in all were ruu, anraging 120 miles in length, and radiating into the Gulf from the shallow water of the approaches to the delta. The temperature of the water, and also its deusity, were recorded at each of about five bun<lre<l soundings. At iutervals until May, the party in the steamer assisted in the various operations of the physical surwy at the mouths of the Mississippi, mention of whicll service was made in the notice of that work. Early in May, Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee ran a line of" soundings in the Gulf or Mexico from Soutl.Jwest Pass to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and another from the mouth of that river to the Tortngas. Wire and the Thomson apparatul', which, for bis immediate purposes, bad been modified

by Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee, were used for deep soundings, and the results pro>ed to be entirely satisfactory. 111 reference to the lines run in the deep water of the G11If, it is mentioned in the summary report that the specimen of mud brought up from a depth of 583 fathoms emitted a strong odor of sulphureted h,Ydrogen. This was on the line uetweeu the Southwest Pass and the Rio Grande. On both of the lines, temperatures were observed, and specimens of the bottom soil, and of the water there and at the surface, were taken at intervals corresponding with the determinations of depth. The greatest depth found was 2,119 fathoms, ou the line ue.tween the Hio Grande and the Tortu gas. In the hsdrographic registers, se>en hundred observations for temperature are recorued, and three hundred for densities of the Gulf water. The temperature.observations so far made lead to the inference, that, in general, the normal temperature of the Gulf water is about 3H2"° Fahrenheit, that temperature Leing reached at 350 fathonrn, and remaining apparently constant to depths of 2,000 fathoms.

At the close of the fiscal year, I,ientenant Hutchins and Lieutenaut Grimes were assigned to take charge of separate hyclrogmphic parties for work on the coast of New England, near which Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee will also be engaged iu deep-sea soundings. Survey of the Missi.~sippi River at New Orleans, La.-Tbc schooner Varina was refitted at New Orleans for the scn·icc of the party of Assistant U. H. Boyd early in Nornmber, 1874; but as yellow fever prevailed then iu the city, the vessel was not moved until the end of that month, when the topographical survey of tbe vil.linity of New Orleans was t:1ken np. Two plane-tahlt>s were employed; and, with frequent weather-interruptions, the work advanced upward from a station about three miles below the city, where the detailed surrny h:td stop1)ed in the previous year. In the course of the season, the plane-table ope.rations included the city of New Orleans and the towns of Algiers, Gretna, McDonoughville, and Uarrollton, and both banks of the river from stations near the battle-grouucl to Keunen·ille, or about nine miles above Uarrollton. Tbc triaugulation was extended from the town last named to stations several miles aboYe Kennerville. All the field-operations in this quarter were retarued during Decemher and months followiug until the 1st of March. The field-journal noted rain during some part of every day in January. Late in March, Assistant Bo;yd, under special instructions, uetached from his party Subassistant Braid, and co-operated also in person at the outset, for a miunte survey of South Pass, refereace to which was made under the last bead. A triangulation then conducted through the pass determined in position forty-two points for guiding in the detailed plane-table survey. Be· turning to the site of his own field-operations, Mr. Ho_yd closed the river-triangulation for the season at the eud of April, and made a reconnaissance of the Amite River region for stations that might serve to connect the survey of L<ike Pontchartrain with that ()f the Mississi1)pi above X<.'w Orleans. Assistant Boyd also ran lines of level (fourteen miles in all) to connect the Carrollton bench-mark, established in the survey of 1858 by the Uuited States Corps of Engineers, with the bench-mark at the mint in New Orleans, to which last are referred the tidal records of the Coast Survey. :Messrs. O. H. Van Orden and W. E. McClintock were attached to this party as aid.~. The work was discontinued on the 23d of June. Few soundings bad !Jeen made in the river :tbo\·e New Orleans, as, when arrangements had boon completed for such work, the emergency arose for the services of Mr. Braid in South Pass.

Triangulation in Missouri (Sketch No. 15).-Tllis work was resumed by Assistant Boyd on the ltith of August, 187 4, at a station ou the south side of the Missouri River, about thirty miles west of Saint Louis. The cl.lain of triangles laid out westward extcuds the work to the vicinity of Gasconade Hiver. Signals have been set up in eight connties of Illinois and Missouri; and, of the stations alread;r occupied, eight. are in the immediate neighborhood of the parallel of latitude that passes tbrougb Saint Louis. The triangulation done this year previous to the middle of October, when the part,r resumed work in auother part of the section, extended the determination of points westward thirt~· miles, through a country thinly settled, and offering some obstacles tllat are not commonly met aloug the seaboard. All the ridges relied on for stations are densely wooded with hickory aud oak, and, being nearly of the same height, their identification at a distance is difficult. Ulearing liues for sight proved to be very laborious, and no lumber could be p1·ocnred in the .region for signals. In cross· ing the fifth principal meridian of the United States land-surveys, Assistant Boyd occupied a subsidiary station, and connected one of the marks on that meridian with bis scheme of triangles. Another corner was identified eastward aud northward of that line, and was brought into connection with bis scl1eme of geographical points. The latitude and lougitmle of Saiut Louis baviug been well determined since the 1ieriod of the land-surveys in that part of the State, the two points referred to, as might be expected, do not accord on tbe local maps with results grveu by the geo· detic work.

Van Orden accompanied Assistant Boyd as aid in this work and in that noticed under the preceding head. Reconnaissa11Ce in 1fisconsin.-In order to provide for the systematic determination of points in the State of "Wisconsin, a reconnaissance, conducted by Prof. J.E. Davies, was commenced at the opening of the :fiscal year, as \Tas mentioned in my last annual report. Dnriug the season, until October, 1874, and at intervals in the course of the winter and spring, the work was vigorously prosecuted through the region included between the Wisconsin River, below Grand Rapids, and the east bank of the Mississippi, between .Black River and Prairie du Chien. Three chains of triangles wP.re laid out, bounding that region, and making in the aggregate a belt of about 225 miles iu linear extent. Some of the lines iu the scheme are thirty miles long; but, in places where obsta· cles intervened, the lengths lessen to six and eight miles. The practicability of some of the lines is yet uncertain, but the scheme as presented, results from the patient examination in person of ground, in traversing which, Professor Davies traveled abou tnine hundred miles over rough or sandy roads, the stations desirable being of course in parts the most elevated and the farthest from social comforts. '"\Vindfalls, marshes, and uuiuhabited traftts fully tested, but they have not lessened, the interest of the intelligent observer who has enlisted in this work. In the spring of tlte present year, and in advance of the appearance of forest-leaves, Mr.. Davies again took the field, witb a view of improving the scheme of triangulation, which was provisionally .marked out for including the region of Black River at a time when foliage bad not fallen from the trees.

arrangements for snch work include as conditions for ultimate success, tJ1at sites for 11ase lities slwultl be a\·ai!aule at snitallle inten·als in the triang11latiou. The grotind to IJe measu re1l, if not leniI, should !Jc such tlrnt the measuring-oar shall in no case have an inclination of more than 6°, and the line should be so related to the ue11rcst geodetic stations as to a<lmit of corwection witlt them b.v large angles. At inten·als in the scheme of triangulation, it is desirable also that qnadrilaterals should appear, if tue reconnaissance shows that a chain of successive quadrilateral11 is impracticitble. The conditions here mentioned were kept in view in the operations of Professor Davies, and will !Jc met as far as the difficulties of the ground allow. As now pro\·isionally mark ell out, the three connecting chains of triangles will require as many bases of verification, determinations of azimuth at four stations, aud of latitude at two points of the triangulation. The longitude of the university at Madison bas been already determined. Early in June of the present year, 11 rofessor Da,·ies perfected arr:rngementB for resuming field-work at Spring Green, near wuich, iu the >alley of the \Yisconsiu Hiver, the plain seemed favorable as a site for a base-line about three miles in length. In the middle of the month, Assistant Richard D. Cutts reached .i\fadison, and proceeded with Professor DaYies to Spring Green. A Rite for the line was selected, the a<ljacent countr.r was examined with reference to its connection with station-points, and reconnaissauce was made for conducting the triangulation out of the valley. Assi;;tant Cutts co-operated in the movements of the party during several da_ys, and gave detailed explanations in regard to all the requirements for field-work, iu particular the scheme of lines for emerging from the confined valley, and for connecting the base with the main triangulation. "'When be left Madison, at the end of June, to arrange for the operations of his own party, in Section I, l'rofessor Davies was in readiness to occupy stations for the measurement of horizontal angles in the vicinity of Spring Green.

Hyilrography of Aransas Bay anil Afasrptit Bay, Tex.-For this duty, tbe schooner Bibb: after ser1ice which has been mentionell u11der the head of Section II, was re1itted, and sailed from :Nor· folk on tlie 3d of December, 1874. The party reached Indianola, Tex., after a run of three weeks. As soon as practicable, Subassistant ,V, I. Vinal 1 who was in charge, proceeded to San Antonio Bay, and sounded a space near the western end to complete an interYal in the operations of the preceding season. Stormy weather preYailed through the month of January. This hindrance, and the fact that by reason of her draught of water the schooner conld not be used in extending the \vork further, constrained the engagement of a lighter of fifteen tons, !Jy means of which Mr. Vinal completed the supplementary work in San Antonio Bay on tbe 21st of .March. I·'requeut and heavy "northers," the extreme scarcity of fuel and of fre;;h water, and sickness amongst the crew retarded the operatious.

No><. 17, 18, ID.)

Good progress has been m~ule h,r the land-parties working in Lliis seetion, aml a large au;-anc(I in hydrograpby. During the greater part of the fiscal J·ear, tlw tielll-a:;;sistants, who haYe hitherto' made the astronomical o\Jsci·vatious at stations on the Pacitlc eoast, were absent lts meml>ers of several expeditious sent IJ,\· oul' Go\·erumeut to Asia and the South Pacific Ocean fm observing the transit of Veuus in Decem lJer, 187-!. The junior obsen-crs, mentioned in my report of last year as on that special astronomical service, returned in the spriug anll resumed their accustomed fieldwork. Assistant George D,widsou, tlrn principal observer in J:ipau of the December transit, was requested to improYe the opportunity afforded by ti.Jc dista11t voyage for recording magnetic observations while crossing the J>acific Ocean. As arranged, also, with that experienced obsen·er in personal conference preYions to his departure, be passed some weelrn of the present year in India, carefull.r examiuing systems of irrigation, with reference to provision for an ackuowle<lgd want in some of our great western >alleys, Professor Daviilsou being himself a member of the commission appointc<l by the President of the United States to devise plans of irrigation for California. At the same time advantage was takeri to note the methods in field-work for the geodetic sur>ey of India, aml generally the appliances. and expedients as compared witll 0t1r own resources for prosecuting the work of triangulation. In Egypt and el:;ewhere, Assistant Da\-idson gave a,ttention to results gained in marine engineeriug, and has recorded the metllods adopted in successful works of that character. The scarcit.y of harbors on the upper coast of Oa!ifomia aud on the coast of Oregon, must at an early clay, in view of tlie iuerease of settlements, call for the construction of breakwaters at plaees capttble of beiug so sheltered an·d affording good anchorage as harllors of refuge. l'or such prospective requirements, information has lJeen gathered from all available sources in Europe, and, incidentally, the methods pursued there in the reclamntion of title-lands. The comprehensive report presented by Profes!ior Daddson, iilcludes the result8 of his iuspectiou of insteuments of precision now used by European obsen·ers, a branch of research for which be is specially qualified. Ju the introductory part of this report, allusion bits hmm ma<le to the results obtained by Professor Davidson at the station occnpie1l in Japan by himself and his aids for obserdng the transit of Venus. The details in regar<l to his overatious for that service are given in Appendix No. 13. Of the several Japanese officers who visited tbe transit-station of tl1e Coast Stn'vey observers at Nagasaki, Capt. Nawo-Yoshi Yan1igi, chief of the huroan of ltydrography of tile imperial navy, is regarded a.s one of the most learueu men of Japati. From tile ILM"al station 11t 'I'okio be made the trip to Nagasaki for the sole purpose of witnessing and studying t!Je operations of the party. After 1rnrsonally noting the processes for determining tlrn ditt"i:;rence of longitude by telegraph between Nagnsaki and Tokio, the captain consulted Professor D:1Yi<lson in reference to instruments, 11ml requested him to procure and forward such an outfit for an oliservatory as would include means for rating the chronometers of the naval vessels of .Japan, anu serve for general purposes in astronomy. This first observatory in .Japan will be erected in the extensive grounds of the imperial mwy dep:trtment at Tokio, and on· the site occnpir.<l b.r J\lr. Dadd son for longitude-observations. At the joint request of C<tptain Yanagi and other high officials of the goYernment, the longitude-station at Tokio was connected by telegraph with the transit of Venus station at Naga.saki. In passing through Europe, JUr. Davfdson g:we the orders of Captain Ya.n{Lgi for an astronomical clock with break-circuit attachments, at Berlin, and for the Hipp cllronograph. A break·circuit chronometer wiH b3 sent from ~e\V York; and. a meridian instrumeat, of the form devised by Davids011, ancl made by 1Yiirdeman11, will be forwarded from 1Vas!Jington. Mr. Da,·idson has co~ sented also to arrange all tlw. neetlfnl telt1graphic apparatus, test the instrnments as they are delivered by the maker, an.d furnish copies or papers descriptive of the lfold-nses of the several iitstruments, and in regard to methods of reducing the olJsen·ations.

The operations of parties working near aud along the coast to the soutllward of Sau }'raucisco were inspected in A11ril last b.r As:,,istant Uichard D. Cutts. 'Yith some, then at work with the plane-table, special conferences were held in regard to the delint>ation of the abrupt and 1Jig-l1 elenitious that mark the topog1·aphy of the coast acljacent to the Santa Barbara Channel, and for which the methods employed on tlw less rugged coast of tlte Atlantic would pron~ both too labori· ons and expen:,;ive After general consultation at Sau Francisco, iu reference to these aml other details of field-work, 1'\Ir. Cntts left early i11 .l\1ay to return to \Yashington, but, at my request, remained a few da;ys at Salt Lake Uit,y.

At tlle end of April the hydrography of the approaches and cl!:wnels, the triangulation of the Yiciuity, and two })lane-table slieets of the d<>tailed surn'y had been completed.

His party. was re-organized as early as the weather would permit, and resumed the detailed survey. Owing to the scarcity of fresh water in tile region to which the work had extended early in the spring, temporary camps were used at sites near small springs in the interior of the island, and from these ns centers of work the topogmpby was advanced and joined with the details of previous seasons. Before leaYing the west end of the island, Mr. Forney selected and marked a station at which signals on all the outl~·ing islands of the Santa Barbara group will be in view untler favorable circumstances. Along the shore at Prisoner's Harbor, on the north side of the islanu, changes wen} obsen·ed, to which is probably due the loss of the poiut occupied for astronomical obserYations in 1852. The shell-mound on which tile instruments were placetl bas been washed awa~- b~· subsequent wintert"reshets, The field-report states that on the northwest and nortl1east ernls of Santti Cruz Island ter· races, supposed to mark old sett-beaches, are yet distinctly defined. Snell features in. topography have beeu frequently noticed on the main; and within tile limits indicated fur plane-table work along the coast the terraces there and elsewhere will be mapped as details of special interest in researches relati\·e to the geology of the coast of California. Santa Cmz Island is nearly twenty.five miles long, and has an average width of about four miles. The surface, though exceedingly rough, is well represented in the plane-table sheet by cur\'es drawn for each 200 foet of successive elevation above the water.line. The highest point of the island is 2,410 feet above the level of the sea. On the lower parts of the surface, grass is a bnnilant, and for iwme ~ears has sustained a stock of sheep so considerable that :fifteen to twenty thousand head haYe been taken from the island annually. The detailed slll'v~y has developed several good anchorages and boat-landings additional to those heretofore resorted to, and the exact location of each of the fresh-water springs, some of which, when more generally known, will doubtless be of account to sea-going vessels.

At the close of the fiscal year, Subassistant PorneJ'- made preparation to take up the detailed sun-ey of Santa Catalina Island. Hydrography arotmd Santa Ornz Island, Oal.-The work done in the summer of 1874 by the b,rdrographic party of" Lieut. Commander H. C. Taylor, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in the steamer Hassler, will be mentioned nuder a subsequent head in tltis section. When the season closed for operations abreast ·Of the ooundary-lipe between California am] Oregon, the steamer returned to Sau Fraucisco, was promptly refitted, and commenced soundings in the vicinity of Sllnta ()ruz Isl0nd on the 12th of November, 1874. The work was steadily pushed until tlie 19th of December. · During the winter, Lieutenant-Commamler Taylor and bis officers completed and forwarded to 'V ashiugton the charts and records of the season passed on the no:rthflrn coast. The bydrograpby near Santa Cruz was resumed on tlte 19t,h of Mareh of this year, and was Eiteadily prosecuted onward and througllout June, when the work was essentially finished. Near the west end of the island, soundings were made la.st season by the party in the Hassler under the direction of Commander P. C. J obnson, aml near the east end the approach bad been developed previously in connection with the hydrograpby of A.oacapa Passage. Joining with the lunits of completed work, Lieutettaut-Commander Taylor sounded the approaches of the north and of the south side of the island, making in the aggregate a belt of forty-eight miles in leugth and nearly six miles wide. Of the features developed, two of the most important are the well-marked submarine plateau extending from the north face of Santa Cruz Island, and a remarkable submarine canon oft' the southwest co1·ner

of the islam]. Commauder Johnson, in sounding Santa. Cruz Channel, found 100 fathoms with 40 fathoms on each side, and snpposed the vessel to be directly over tile head of a cafion that stretched (lirectly to seaward, but time did not then allow of the development. lu the course of the present year, Lieutenant-Commander Taylor found exceptional depths at places southward of Santa Cruz Island and some miles to eastward of tbe Santa Cruz Channel. Followiug the course indicated by large variations in depth, the cafton was traced to its head, and that was fouud at the position in which Commander Johnson llarl recorded tlie soundings before mentioued. In furtl1er reference to this remarkable depression in the sea-bottom, Lieutenaut-Commauder Ta~ !or says: "Commencing at about the middle of tile southern part of Santa Cruz Cllaunel, the caiion turns at once to the eastward and sweeps aloug parallel to the south shore of Sauta Cruz Island for some miles, when it again turns southward and goes to the deep sea at a point a little east of Gull Island. It ayerages 300 fatLoms iu depth for tbe greater part of its leugth, witlJ 40 and 50 fathoms on its seaward side. Tile bottom is rock and shells as far as the turn to seaward, where tile ooze of the deep i;:;ea begins to show.

Heliotropes were stationed on San Miguel Island and on Santa Cruz, and angular measurements were mnde on them in con11eetion with a signal at Santa Barbara, until June of the preseut year. The season was unfa,·orable, and the signals were consequently often invisible from the obsen'ing-station. Several partial series of horizontal angles were, howeYer, measured, and astronomical obsen'ations were recorded succeiss!'ully on four nigbts. Mr. W. S. Edwards was attached to this party as aid. In the course ol' a continuous spell of foggy weather, l\Ir. Edwards ran a line of lcn~ls from Gaviota Station down to the beach.

cn·nce. In tbis duty, Mr. Seugteller was busily engaged during the winter. Fiutliug· himself ahlc to take the field iu tLe latter part of February, a party was organized, and prosecuted under his direction the hytlrography of San Luis Obispo Bay. In that ·work, three sunken rocks were \liscoYered and repo: ted as dangerous to ua'l'igation. One of these, in fourtern feet water at mean low tille, lies a mile io the Ronthwanl of Hock.}· Elnft'; the others are in eighteen fic·et water, arn, about half a mile apart, :md lie about a mile aml a lrnlf' soutliwest of \Ylrnler Island, at the extn·mity of Point Sau Luis. All were carefully determined in position; raug:es for aYoidiug· the dangers were promptl;'I- furnished, and in l\fay a "Notice to Mariners," in the usual form, was issued frnm the office. TLe hydrography of San Luis Obispo Ba;y was developed to a line about thre<>. miles west of l'oiut San Luis) so as to include the approacl1es to the bay from the northward. Souuding·s were extemle<l to abont tho s:1mo distance eastward of tbe point. The cur>e of t\'l'Cnt.r fathoms was traced 011 the chart after its completio11, and appears at varying distances from the line of mean low water, in some places being a mile and a half allll at others f'om· miles off shore. Mr. :F. \Yesttlahl sened :ts aid in the party of Assistant Sengtcller. Soundings were rnrnmeuccll ou the 1st of J\larch an(l were completed at the end of April. The general statistics are:

Seugteller completed Liis ofiicc.-work by the end of June, aud then made preparation for resuming ficl(l-du(y on tlie coast between Bodega Ilead and Point Arena. Topogropli.I/ of Point S11r.-This surn'y for the uses of the Light-House Board was committed by mv instructions to Assistant C. Itockwell in the latter part of Ja11uar_y, and in expectation that 11 ;ea11~ or tranl5it could be readily Lad. Finding, however, that the light house temler was laid up for repairs, aml wishing to a\·oid delay, a small Yesselwas engaged to move tlie party to the workiug-grnuntl. Tbat vessel proving unequal to the service, l\fr. Hockl'l'ell engaged the Rtearner Sau I,nis to put himself and tbe party and instrume11ts ashore on the uext trip of the vessel to Sau Diego. A storm from tbe south ward detaiucd the vessel two da:ys in l\lontere.r B.t;r, but she was off Point Sur on the morning of the .Uh of March. The San Luis lay off all day uuuer steam; but, finding it impossible to land the carnp-fixtmrs :rn<l son\e of the instruments and tools, she i)assed on to San Dit>go, lea\ing Assistant Hockwell, \'l'llo lrn<l 'gone at-1hoi-e in the oul_y boat that it was found practicahle to laud ou tbe point. Two hands belouging to the party werc.canie<l off hy tlie steamer. \Vith the remaining hands, Mr. Hackwell took shelter in a deserted dairy-shanty, and, pemliug the retnrn of the Yessc1, comrnence<l next day and continued field-work with sucb instm!ll(~nts as be had taken ou shore. Ile sele<.;t\'d a site for a base-line, aud marked points as stations for the triangulation. Ou the 17th of lllarch, the steamer Sau J,uis, on the upward passage, was again off Point Sur, hut a northwest, gale matle it impossilJle to n.·store to l\lr. !tock well what was on l.Joar<l belonging to his party outfit. The articles 'o/erc consequently left at Monterey, and ftnally were delh·ered on Point Sur by a small SC'a-going lrnat hired for the purpose. Unfortunately fur the owners, while moored under the rock, after landing .her cargo on Point Sur, the boat l.Jroke from bcr moorings mid was clashed to pieces on the l.wacb. A111sistant Hackwell measured a baseline with a twenty-meter drniu, and made a triangulation sufticil·nt for the desired plaue-table survey, which iucltHles sm·eral miles of the coast adjacent to the point. 'fhe journal of occupation sbows that at Point Sur tbe wind blew illccs:rnntly from the 10th until the 22d of March, aud vei·y fre<1nently for shorter periods in the course of the season. The result of this topographical survey is a valuable map on a scale sufficiently large for an~· purpose of the Light-House Board. Ee;uings up and down the coae;t to m1merous points in Yiew were taken by :Mr. Hock well, an<l such details were included as were decrncll iudispeusahle for the selection of sites proper for a light-house an cl fog-signal. Owing to its 1wculiar ishayw, the hill preEeuts ditlicult f'Pat,ur<>s with reference to t110 coast-lines of Yisibility. ""hile the triangulatiou was iu ha111l, two of the monntain-pcaks hack of

Blwal o_ff South Parrillon L~land.-Late in June of the present year, Lieut. Commander JI. C. Taslor, U.S. N., assistant in the Coast StuYey, in charge of the steamer Hassler, while takiug in coal at Sau Francisco, was informed of the existence of an nnm:nked rock near South Farallon Jight-lwss<>. Defore resuming regular work near Santa Ornz Island, search was made, and the _shoal was found at tlJC reported bearing, but only about half a mile from tl10 light house. 'l.'hc tlepth found was six and a lialf fathoms, an(I, as reportNI, the sea breaks 011 it only in exceptionally heaYy weather. }{oonday Rock.-In October, 1874, Lieut. Col. 0. Seaforth Stewart, Corps of United Stat<'S Engineers, prn\·ided means for increasing the (lepth of water on :Noo1Hlay Hock, the i10sitio11 of wLic.h was <letenuiued some sears ago by Asi:;istaut A. F. Itodgers of the Coast Suney. Tliis danger was eighteen miles from the coast of California, and about three miles northwest of tho Nortli I<'arallon. As Fanny Shoal, its exi~tence had been known; llnt there was much nncertaint.v in regard to its whereabouts pre\ ions to 186:3. On tile 2d of Jauuar,v, in that year, the ship Xouuday, wllen the n'ssel by her reckoning was eight miles from the Xorth Faralldn, strnck on the roek near midday, and within two honrs sunk in forty fathoms. When arrangements were com11lete for tl1e operations proposed in submarine enginl·eri11g, no suitable H'Ssel could be procure1l nt Sau Fraucisco, and· the cntter Shubrick con!tl not be spare<l from pressillg clutiPs in tlie light·liouse Rcrvicc. Untler these circnrnstances, applicntio11 wa:-; made to Lieutenant-Commander Taylor for tlie co-operatiou of bis party in the steamer Hassler. The vessel accordingly left San Francisco on the 30th of October, and by nightfall a buoy was plact·:l on the top of the rock, where tLe deptll was found to be 20:! foet at low water. Subseqneutly, I . . ieutemmt Weeden, of the Corps of Engineers, in close "examination, h.r tl1t; aid of a dh·er, discon>rctl that the rock did IJOt terminahl in a single })oint, but in three, aml that the depth on one of the pt>a ks was only fourteen f<>et at mean low \\'ater. .J\lensnr<'meuts made hy Lieutenant 'Veeden were embodie1l by Lieuteuant-Colouel Stewart in a published notiee i11viting 1}ro11osals for the remO\'al of the. upper part of Noonday Hock, to insure an average depth of forty-five feet at mean low water. As tl.te terms require the completion of the operation within the ;yenr 1875, and all the comlitions are well known, the early remonil of this obs.t~1cle in the seaward approach to Sau Francisco Bay is not a matter of douht. Hydrograpliy of 8an Francisco Bay.-At the opeui11g of tl1e fiscal year, work was rt'SllllJPd in San l!'mncisco Bay by the bydrngraphic party in the schooner nfarcy, under diarge of Assistn11t Gershom Bradford. Soundings wern made between the shoal north of Yerba. Dueua Islaucl and

the Oakland Flats, and, compared with pre\'ious results, these give evidence of both deepening and widening of that clian nel. Sonth of Oakland 'Wharf, aml near the mouth of San Antonio Creek, where close soundings were recorded, no <cry cousiderahle change is apparent. The twelve feet and eighteen feet curves coincide nearls with those tf:wed twenty sears ago_. A'lsistant Bradford notes that Blossom Rock_ at the lowest t.ides may hav-e on it a depth of only about twenty-one feet, and that some of the' vessels that resort to San Francisco as a port draw twenty-six feet of water. In a previous report, mention was matle of the wreck of the ship Flying Dragon as a danger in navigation. The party in tbe schooner Marcy carefnlly examined, by means of drags, the spot in which the obstruction had settled, but no part of the wreck remains there. Numerous observations were recorded on the currents of the bay. Those at the surface were determined by a pole reaching down about tweJye feet, so that results might a11ply for vessels of average draught. In the snhcurrent obsernttions, the number of sets recorded were proportioned to the deptll of water. Mr. Bradford used for results below the surface the connected cans first proposed by Prof. Henry )Iitchell. Of three current-stations in each series, one was in the fair-way of the channel, and 011e on ea~·b side of it, but near the edge of the clJannel. About SoutlJampton Shoal, tlie stations were increased iu number, with a Yiew to results that may aid in developing the causes of its formation. In regard to it, Assistant Bradford mentions as a significant fact "that the sand of which tbe shoal is cbiefly composed was, at one of the stations, found to be underlaid by mud at the depth of seven feet." This was noticed on raising a screw-pile wbich he had used there as a tide-gauge. For stations at the surface and below it, the currents have been plotted in diagrams, slrnwing velocity aud direction, and also the corresponding tidal curYe at the nearest station. :From these, current-tables were constructed in which the large flood and large eub were separated from the small ones, the mean of the two differing, for practical uses, too much from either. In tb.e course of the work south of Bird Rock a great difference was noticed it1 the slacks of ebb aud flood. Assistant Bradford and his aid, Mr. F. 'Vestdahl, recorded upward of 6,000 obsenations for determining the direction and velocity of currents. In pecember, 1874, the party sounded out the space between Peninsula Point and Point Cavallo, and developed the character of the bottom from that line upwards abreast of Saucelito a11d into Richardson's Hay, as far as the transverse line of soundings showed a depth of seven feet. Opposite to Sa.ucelito, the eighteen feet curve includes a space somewhat more than a hundred ~-ards in widtll, and for tl.Jat vicinity the cha1·t shows some soundings in five fathoms.

Bradford continued the series of observations on currents. As the time approached for resuming hydrographic work near Humboldt Bay, the party was transferred from the schooner Marcy to the i;choouer Yukon, the former being no longer serviceable for work along the coast.. Tidal observations.-Under the immediate direction of Colonel Mendell the series of tidal and meteorological obser~ations at 1''ort Point, Cal., have been kept up by the observer, Mr. E. Gray. As usual, tbe observer tabulates the high a.ud low waters and the hour)~- ordiua.tes as derived from tho curve of tidal rise and fall. Recomiai11sanae.-In order to adjust the preliminaries for a chain of large triangles to pass east· ward from points near the Pacific coast, Assistant William Eimbeck took the field on the 20th of April at Mount Diablo. After several days passed there in expectation of determining the' practic!lbility of a line of sigbt to Mount Shasta, the party proceeded to Fairfiel<J, and from thence to Vaca Station, which was reached on the 1st of May. The mountains in this locality being very rugged and densely covered with brush, many hardships were endured. In successive ascents from one to another of the points deemed fa\·orable for seeing the distant !Stations which bad been marked for recognition, the issue was not promising, but after seven days and passing several nights at ditferent places on the highest part of the mountain, Mr. Eimbeck recognized the crest of the Sierra.

At the snme point, ltow<wer, tho snmmit of Shasta was i11\·isible. Proceeding eastward, tltc partJ' traverst'd the country to 1\1onticello and K11ox\·ille. At Lakeport, arrangm1Jl·.11t.s wen· mat!P for occnpyi11g Snow l\1onutain for rcco11naissance purposes, and the southel'n summit was J'('nche1l 011 the 14th of ~fa,r.

The station i>'I :~,000 feet high and extremely difficult of access. In tlte middle of l'tfay, the partJ' ou the summit found tlw air so col<l as to require a constant ftre near the shelter-tent. After comtlleting the preliminary observations at Vaca, l\Ir. l<Jimbeck left for Marys\·ille Butte hy wa.y of Colusa. The summit of the South Bt1tte was reached on the 24th of May, and the practicability of a line to Mount Shasta was quickly decided. H.eturning to l\faryS'ville on the 26th of l\Iay, Assistant l1Jimbeck plottetl the points which had been determined by reconnaissance as interdsible, and studied for perfecting the scheme with additional points in the chain of triangles. Early in June, ~fr. Eirnbeck made repeated examinations from the summit of Pilot Hill atHI also from points on Pine Hill. Other localities wrre examined in the course of an extended journey by way of Promontory Spur and through Auburn and Colfax to the summit of the Central Pacific Railroad, where all the members of the party rf'joincd Assistant Eimbeck in the middle of .Tune. A few days after, the summit of Lola Mountain was occupied, and·witl1iu a week a peak of Mount Shasta was reoognized. From l\fonnt Rose, that high summit 1iot being visiUle, l\lr. Eimheck went t 1 Castle Peak and spent a d:iy in making observatiou8 from tlrn snm 1nit of its eastern prong. His party was in that vicinity at the end of ,Juue, when tlie last field·report was dispatched by Assistant Einrbeck. Dangerous rock o:fl Cope Mcndocino.-At intern1Is, in past years, many rocks lla\'e been determined in position in the vicinity of Cape Mendocino. On most of these, however, the water breaks in ordinary weather 1 and being thus commonly known, the,Y are probably not reckoned as dangers by mwigtitors who pass and repass the cape frequently. The usage of vessels along this part of the coast, iu going inside of known dangers, has heen repeatedly meutionecl in the field-reports. Assistant Hodgers, while the topography of the aujacent coast \Yasin progress, provided, as far as practical.Jle, against resuJt,iug disasters by watching, in stormy weather, for breaks that had uot shown under ordinary circurnstauces. .Assistant Bradford, in charge of the hsdrograpbic party, early in 1Si3 garn special attention to the de,·elopmeut of unknown dangers that might exist between Bluut's H.eef and the cape, aud several spots at wlticll the water broke were then approximately detcnnined l>y the hydrograpllic aid, Mr. F. Westdahl. To his careful observation at that time, is mainly due the discovery, wllich was made in April last, of a dangerous sunken rock southwest three-fourths west by compass, and distant a mile and three-quarters from t,!Je !ight-house ou Cape Mendocino. The rock has onl.r six feet of water on it, is not more than three feet iu diameter at the top, and is uot marked by kelp. Soundings alongside giwc nine and ten fathoms, and near by, the water ra1·idly deepens to fifteen fathoms. In reference to tltis danger, t!Je IO!fowiug remark is made in the repo1·t of Assistant Bradford: "The development of the r~k settles auy question in regard to the danger of this passage without a pilot, for it is eYideut ihat a stranger could only make moderately sure of safety by keeping clos1~ inside of Blnnt's J:,eef, and the gain of barely onr. mile in tbe run, between Point Gorda and ~'alse Cape, would not compensate for the risk incurre1l in passing midway between Blunt's Ueef and Cape l\Ie9docino. Moreover, the water on a rock of sncb peculiar shape will lncak only under very exeeptional conditions; and, though so near the surface, the <!auger rarely shows any sign of its existence." Of the particular point of rock found and determined in position by Mr. Bradford, there was 110 pre"Vi-0us knowledge, or even a hint, unless .it be taken as the rock mentioned !Jy Assistant Davidson in his Directory, as seen in 1857, under tlw wlwel of t!te steamsl1i11 Oommorlore. Such da11· gers are likely to lmfile1 in tile search for them, all ordinary expedients. Pilots, of tried skill and experience, have repeatedly run their tug-uoats througlr this passage without seeing the rock in f}ue!!lion. While setting Utt signals on shore, in l8i2, Assistant Bradford carefully inspected the reef from a station on high land, located many breaks, and afterward found the rocks which occa. sioued the brea.ks. At that time, he also brought into requisition a drag, about sixteen feet-long, anu reaching well below the surface of the water, and tha.t was constantly in use while the party H. E:x. 81--8

worked near Cape Mendocino. It is evident that the e:d;;tence of r<)cks so sharp as to elude detection when such mean8 are applied. makes the passage ins1de of Hlunth-1 Heef un;.;afo for naYigation. The risk will lie only in a degree lessened when all the hidden dangt>rs are found and accurately marked on a chart showing their relatiYe positions. Hydrography l!ct1cccn Point Gor111i wul Bocl.:y l'oint, coast of California.-In the course of the preseut _year, additional sounuing,,;, to develop the coast hydrography, ha\·e been made between these limits hy A;;sistant Bradford, with a party, in the scl10011er Yukon. l~al'ly in April, he OC'~ll· pied some of the stations, at which signals had been previousl:y erected, to inelu<le about 1ifty miles of coast-line. Tlie work wa8 coutiuued tlirongLout l\lay aud June, aud was joined with tlrn bydrography of 1872, completing the inshore soundings l>etween Hocky Point and t,lie limit, two miles below Cape Mendocino. As means additional to the facilities afforded by the sehooner, a steam-tug was chartered, aml was effectually used iu prosecuting the imshore hydrography.

'l'he hydrography done this season, clmiing with the 30th of .Tune, is represente11 011 three RheetR. Humboldt Bar was examined by .Assistant Brad· ford on the 12th of April. He remarks iu· reference to it: "I found a great al tcration in the direction of the chaunel, though the change mnst have occurrerl previous to l\la;i.·, 1872, for the !'\}tme ranges are in use now as we often used for m·oRsing the bar while so1l!Hling on Blnnt's !{eef off Cape 1\Iendocino. The depth, however, is about two foe.t less at the present time. At favorable times this season, lines of soun<1ings were run across the bar, showing that depth only bad ueen affected, and uot the direction of the channel, which is straight, of good width, and in the direction of the swell, so that, with a steady, fair wind, and moderately smooth sea, there is little tlifficnlty in entering with a sailing-vessel, the ranges being known and Yisible. At meau low water, the average depth is nine to ten feet." The coast hytlrograpby was extended seaward to an a\·erag-e dist<tnce of rather more than four miles from the water-line, tlte work terminating gcnerall~' at the depth of thirty fathoms. \.Yhere 1idlleu rocks were suspected, the soundings were increased in number; and a drag was kept in consbint use, while the hydrography was in progres!'l, between Itocky Point and Pilot Hock. The approach to Trinidad Mr. Bradford found to be exceptionally free from dangers. The sunken rocks in that vicinity being qnite near to the rocks in Yiew are readily avoided. "The general character of the bottom is fine gray saud, looser and with black specks off' the bar at Humboldt; and, receding from shore, the sand becoming gradnally mixed with mud. Iu depths of thirty to thirtyfive fathoms the bottom fa wholly of mud, and that mm1·1iue (well defined by soundings made in 1872), will, if sought for, be found of benefit to vessels when apprm·ching the coast.11 For the adjustment of sonnuings, made by the pa.rty in the schooner Ynkon, the tides were observed at Hed Bluff, near.the entrance to Humboldt Bay, and at Trinitla(l. By a pre,·ious comparison of tidal results it wa8 found that the difference iu time was not appreciable bet,wccn Cape Mendocino and Trinidad. Coast topography north and south of Ten 111.ile Rii,ei·, Cal.-At the opening of the fiscal year, two })laue·table sheets were pr~jected to receive the details of topography yet ummrveyed between Shelton Cove and Point Cabrillo. For prosecuting the field-work, tlrn )larty of Assistant .A. F. Rodgers was dispatched from Sau Francisco on the 22tl of July, 1874. l\ir. I<J. F. Dickins, the aid, took up the coa8t topography at Abalone Point, and concluctell the work southward, while l\fr. Rodgers was engaged at San Francisco in computing the positions of several light-houses from obsenations recorded earlier in the season. '\Yhen he joined his party, the plane-table survey had been ad\-anced to a poiut about seventeen miles ·northwarrl of Noyo Hi>'er. Early in September, the working-camp was moved to Belobida Creek, from which station the sheet tben in band was conveniently fiuis.hed, and work was commenced on the remaining sheet. Meanwhile, Assistant Uodgers examined the region, aud se1ected a site on the beach at Ten Mile River, with a view of

discharged his party, and reached San Francisco on the 8th of December. Of'Ucc-work, includiug the computations and inking of tletails on the plane-table sheets, was completed in ti.Jc course of the winter. · On the 10th of )farch, Assistant I~odgers took the temporary direction of details in tbe office at San Francisco, and provided the requisites in data antl projections for .tbe intended field-work and hydrograpuy of the present year. Snbassistaut G. Farquhar, at the same time, joined tlie office, and made tracings of pnn-ions work, which was to be joined by tlte operations of tbe season in bydrograpby. Early in April, Mr. Rodgers, at my request, ascende(l Mount Shasta for special reconnaissance, mention of which will be made before closing notices of work iu this section. Redding's &ck.-\Vhen my report of last year closed, Lieuteuant-Commarnler Taylor, and, in co·operation, Assistant A. vV. Uhase, were awaiting a favora\Jle opportunity for landing on this rock, to erect a signal for nse in determining its exact position. The steamer Ilassler, on the 19th of September, 1874, was anchored off the upper gold-blnff:;, ll<'arly opposite, at the clo~e of a severe northwester; but the continued heavj' sea and <lense fog prevented all attempts to l.an<l until Urn 21.st. when a boat from the steamer was safely moored a.t the rock. It was found to IJe an imrueu~e mass of quartz, gray and white, cont[liuing mineral of some kind, the summit of the rock being merely a narrow iidge. Holes were drilled to aclmit a sigual-pole twenty-seven feet i.u l1eight, and its requisite supJlOrt. 'While the ·hands of the topographical puty were so employed, LieutenantCom mander Taylor aud Mr. Chase applied tlte plumb-liue at the western side of tue rock, and found that it stood ninety-four feet out of water. Retlding's Rock is about five miles off tlrn coast of California, and about miclway between Iiocky Poiut and Klamatil River. The bottom all around is rocky, and the a\'erage depth is twenty fathoms. l·'ogs prevailed during all the time allottel1 for operations; and, although the signal was set and ~cured, none of tbc signals on shore were viBible from the rock duriug the Atay of the party. Angular measurements were of necessity deferred, as the steamer could not be detainecl at that time to admit of determiuing the exact position of the rock. Assistant Chase returned to his working-ground on tbe mainlan1l, and completed the coast-triangulation between Klamath Hiver and Rocky Point, connecting at Big Lagoon with the sur\"ey which had beeu extended northward by Assistant Rodgers. Several attempts to land on Sister Rock were pre,·ented by stormy weather; and that station, like Redding's Rock, remaius to be occupied as the apex of a series of triangles, the bases of wilich connect with each otlter from point to point along the coast. The following are statistics of the triangulation in this {jll[lrter: Signals erected . - ........··.·........... - _.. _ ...... _.......... _..... _. _. _. 12 Stations occupied ... ___ - _..................... _...·. _. . ... _....... _. · . . . 11 Angles measured ·... _...................... _.... __ .. _.......... _.. _. . . . . 43 Number of observations_ ............... _. _.. _.. ,. _..·. _...... _· . _....... 768 After l1is return to Crescent City, Mr. Chase made, for the nses of the Light-House Board, and furnished to Lieutenant-Colonel Williamson, a tracing from the plane-table sheet of the survey of Point Saint George. The tracing shows the arc of visibilit~· from a proposed light-house location which is 156 feet above the water-level, and was marked also "iith t.be height of each of the prominent rocks iu that vicinity. Subsequently, Mr. Chase proceeded to San Francisco, and tliere, by the middle of .Tannary, completed the computations resulting frmn.his field-work. Inshore hydr<>grapky from False Klcrniath, Cal., to Mack's Arch, Oreg.-Lient. Commander H. C. Taylor, U.S. N., assistant in the Ooast Survey, with the steamer Hassler, left Sau Frauciscc> on the 10th of June, 1874. A few days after, his party took np and prosecuted until the end of September the inshore bytlrograpby of the Pacific coast above and below the boundary-line between California. and Oregon. The stretch of coast-approaches, developed by soundings in the course of the season, is about fifty-five miles, and, seaward, the lines were extenderl to an avemge dista11ce of six nautical miles. One of the sheets shows, in connection witk inshore soundiugs, the depths in JJfike Earl aud Lake ToUawa, and another, the channel at Smith's River entrance. In the reach included within the working limits of the party in the Hassler, four dangers to navigation were discm·ercd, ai1d, as cu:st-omary, reported immediately. On a rock found in the

TIIE UNITED STA'l'ES COAST SUHVEY.

Gl

anchorage of Crescent City Harbor, Lien~enaut-Commander Taylor maintained a mark pendiug the arrangements for placing a bnoy. Of tllese dangers, two of which were mentioned in my last report, one was found off the False Kia.math, and oue in the anehorage of Chetko CoYe. Abreast of the California and Oregon State line, the inshore sonruliugs lleveloped the character of a danger well-off shore. Information concerning these rocks, and other matters of interest in naYigatiou, was com rnunicated from the san·eying-steamer directly to captains of steamers and sailing-, CS8els, as they passed t.o aud fro. In this vicinity, Lieut.enaut-Commander T<iylor met earnest inquiries in regard to anchorages, the best being sought as the terminus of a wagon-road 120 miles long, to lead from Jacksom·ille to the coast. Crescent City Reef ha>ing been thoroughly sounded, a tracing of the chart was fnruishcd at tlJC request of an agent who was searching, witil a party of t1ivcrs, for property lost by the wreck of a >essel some years ago ou one of tile rocks of that reef. As state<l under the last head, tlie operations of the laud-party, w!Jeu working uear lteddiug':s Hock, were assistetl by tlie temporary use of the Hassler, and the personal co operation of Lientenaut-Cummamler Ta_ylor. In the time gh·eu to aid of tile wo1·k iu charge of Assistant Chase, soundings were made in the ,-icinity of tbe rock. The depth immediately arouud it is eiglttecu fathoms, but the water deepens to twenty-three fathoms mid way hetween Reudiug's lfock and the main, and from that depth the er shoals graduall.r to the beach. On a review of the b,rdrographic work, Lieutenant-Commander Tt:ylor thus obscnTes, in hi:1 report, at the end of the season: "Ileginniug at the south, the water deepens off shore ahout 1in1 fathoms per mile, and this appears to be unaffected by tlw outl_ying I'Ocks wllich, ir1 this -section, fringe the coast almost everywhere. 'Vi th tlle exception of Crescent City Reef, where the bottom is broken anu il'regular, this average deepeuiug per mile off shore continues as we proceed northward to Chetko Cove. Abo\Te that, a much more rapid de::ipening beuomes well marke:l off ll<trnacle Itock, and reaches a maximum (as far as yet knowu) ahreast of l\iack's Arch, where fonrtceu fathoms per mile off shore is the average increase of deptL. \Ye there fiml se\'ents fathoms, but off tile False Klamath oul,y thirty fatlloms at the same distance from the beach." On the important subject of ancl.10rnges, it is remarked by tile same oflicer: "lncreasi11g commerce makes orrly more distinct ihe lack of sllelter 011 this coast. At an early day, doulit]ess, measures and means will be sought for making artificial improW\meut. lleuce, it seems proper to put on record sucli relial>le information as can he bad in adrnuce in regar<l to the few existiug anchorages. One of these, which I haYe named J\fack's Shelter, may be said to L;ixc been hitherto unknown. Some swell rolls in, bnt not much; the place is uudou btedly a gootl northwest lee; and, judging from the small amonnt of was!1 a.ppareu t on the cliff, a111l from the urnlisturbed kelp in tlle upper part of tue shelter, I conclmle that there the violence of "'ind and sea i11 the southeast{lrs of winter is consi<lembl.Y reduced, and that a tolerable southe<\st lee cau be here obtained." The following remarks bear on the capahilit.y of this anchorage for artificial imprornment: "A breakwater, extending from t!Je beach to the reef, or only part of the way, would girn excellent rei;:ults. If built; across in fiye fathoms, it would afford good accommodatiou for scLooncrs, small steamers, and ti.le coasting-trade; if in eight fdthoms, it would gh'e anchorage to all clas;;es of vessels, and ample room for all pro!Jable needs; wllile, if built in ten fathoms, the result woul(l be a most admirable and capacious harhor. There is no village, and the nearest settler Ii 1·es some miles distant; but the problem of a harbor on this stretch of coast will be soh·cll in the interest, not of tbe scanty population of the vicinity, but in that of the busy and rapidl.v-increaisiug popnlation of the valleys in the interior of SoutlJern Ort>gon and :Nortlleru Ualifornia." The hydrogmphic sheets sent to the office by Lieutenaut-Oournn1Hle1· Ta,rlor were accompanied by sailing-directions for entering Mack's Shelter, for tlie channel of Smith's Ui\·er, anu also for uavigatiug a.t Crciscent City Heet'.

COAST OF ALASKA TERlUTORY.-(Snc'l'cII No. 21.)

Coast of Alaska.-"When my report of last year was closed, Acting Assistant W. H. Dall liacl not returned from the coast of Alaska. The schooner Yukon, '>l'ith bimself and hi~ party, arriYed ut San Francisco ou the 12th of October, 1874. On the 3d of May preceding, l\fr. Dall took up tlie coast reconnaissance at Sitka, and from thence in passing up tbe coast recorded current and tempernture obsen'ations and plotted soundings. Vertical angles were measured to determine the heights of mountains in that region that serrn as landmarks at sea. OLsen·ations for time, azimuth, aud latitude were made at Lituya Entrance, and the position gh-en on most charts found to be erroneous. 'rhe chart of the inner bay, by La PeronsP, was tested, and prm'ed to be generally accurate. Here the varty on the Yukon bad much difficulty in preventinp; the persistent attempts of the natives to board the vessel, but fortunately they were kept oft without blood11bcd. It is added in the report that these natives distil their own rum, :md are well supplied with the !.>est kinds of fire arms. Before leaving the place, obscn·ations were made for correcting the positions heretofore assigned to Mount ~afrweather and Mount Crillon. It is n1cor<led that except at slack water the sea breaks quit.; a.cross the entrance to J,ituya Bay, even in calm weather. A few days following the 20th of May were occupied in hyllrographic work at Dry Bay, in reaching wllicb the Ynkou passed the seawarcl face of the Grand Plateau Glacier of La Pemuse. l\Ir. Dall procured data for a corrected sketch of the bay, and for n general cbart of the coast southward as far as Lituya Entrance. Of the region inland, lie says: "The scenery is gran<l; tl;Je mount· ains, reaching 16,000 feet above the sea, are bed<led in forest lowlands, and are scored l:>y enormous glaciers."

Here the party in the Yukon found evidences of the murder b.r natinis of a boat's crew supposed in 1870 to have been lost at sea, but wbicb in that ;rear went ashore from a whaling-vessel commandf'cl by Captain Herendeen, the present sailing-maste1·of the Yukon. In regard to a small trading-vessel from Sitka, the arrival of the surveying-party was timely, iu averting rough usage 1.J:;· the sin·ages .. Late in l\fay, soundings were tried on the so called Pamploua Bank, hut no bottom was found with 575 fathoms of line. Elsewhere on thi8 bank, to which attention has beeu drawn by the report that a rock with kelp existerl, it is beliernd that the depth nrny be no more than 7'5 fathoms; but no search has yet de\'eloperl the existence of a danger to na,·igfltion. At the end of l\fa.y, l\fr. Dall aud his afrl, l\fr. l\:larcus Baker, recorded observations at Port Etches for latitude, tillle, aud azimuth. The vessel then passed ou to Mi1ldletoo Island, where similar observations were made, and a sketch of the ishrnd for transfer to tbe general chart. Kadiak was reached on the -!th of June. After rating the chronometers of the Yukon and observing for azimuth and the magnetic elements, Mr. Dall sailed for Uhirikoff Island. Soundings were made of the space used as anchorage, and the position of the place was determined by astro· nomical observations. On the 12tll of June, the vessel anchored near the Semidi Islands. A.zimuth and latitude were determined, and a sketch was made for the general chart. Sailing next <lay, a safe anchorage was sought for in Chiquik Bay. Here the vessel was detained ten days hy bad weather, bat, at favorable intervals, latitude, time, and azimuth were ohtainerl, the anchorage was sounded, and also tl1e northwest bight of the ba~·. Mr. Dall next proceeded to the vicinity of some rocks that exist about sixty miles west of the Semidi group. Ohsen·ations were recorded for position, which, however, must be regarded as merely approximate, there being no landing-place at the rocks, nor anchorage for the schooner, the least depth found near the rocks being 45 fathoms. On the 25th of' .June, a spot was selected on one of the Uhiacbi Islands, anrl observations were recorded for latitude, time, and azimuth. Proceeding to the Shnmagins, the Yukon was anchoreil on the 1st of July in Northwest Harbor, Little Koniushi Island. Iu that vicinit;r, l\fi·. Dall completed the triangnlation of the harbor. Latitude, azimuth, and time were determint>d, and the survey of the group was extended by the tracing of shore-line and the record of soundings. se,·eral days were passed in the vicinity of the Sannakh Heefs, where numerous observations were made for:detennining in position and extent that danger to navigation. The Yukon reached Unalashka on the 1:.Hh of July. Currents were obserrnd constantly when the vessel was not in port. After due preparation at the anchorage, the party left for Saint Paul Island, of the Pribyloff group, and there arrived on tbe 22d. A sketch of the island was made, and observations were recorded for azimuth, time, and latitude. The position of the island, as given on the existing charts, was found to be six miles too far to the eastward, and the form as represented on them is also erroneous. At Nunivak Island a reconnaissance was made of the ancborge a111I determinations of latitude, time, and azimuth. This island is much in error as represented on all previous charts. Lea\'ing on the 2d of August, the Yukon was next anchored under Hagmeister Island, between Cape Constantine and Oape Newenham. Observations were made for geographical posit.ion, but the extraordinary mirage which prevailed prevented any trustworthy tdaugnlation on the neighboring islamls Ol' adjacent mainland. Hence, sailing for Port Moller, a reconnaissance was made of that harbor, })roving that it has been heretofore inadequaooly represented on charts. Ou the 16th of Aug118t ~ after a period of good weather, the Yukon steered for Saint George, but by heavy seas and wiacls wa~ unable to I.and until the 22d, when series of observations were recorded for time and latitude. The position of that island is reported by Mr. Dall as being about thirteen miles in error, and that in form it diffet·s greatly from the view of it given on charts. As bad weather continued, .i\fr. Dall returned to Unalashka, and there at favorable intervals extended the survey of Captain's Bay, which work had been begun by a party under his charge in 1871. The shore-line of the WPst side of the bay was traced in September, and determinations were made of the magnetic declination, dip, and-intensity. These indicate that the declination is decreasing. H.

HEPORT OF THE SUPERIX1'ENDENT OF . Wiuter set in early at Unalasbka. A hravy fall of snow on the uplands, and constant rain, nn1le it muHlvisable to nnuertake further operations. On the ::l9th of SBptem'Jer, the Yukon sailed for San Francisco, and there arrived after a storm.'· passage of thirteen days. Tile following is a synopsis of statistics from the final report of l\fr. Dii.ll : Latitude-observations at twenty-one stations_ ..........·.............. , . . . . . 864 Time-observations at thirt,y-one stations ..... __ ..... __ .... _.... _.........· .,. 2, 099 Azimuth-observations at sixteen stations .................. _................ 680 ::\Iagnetic-observations at fifteen stations .............. - _. - ..·.. _. . . . . . . . . . . 884 Horizontal and vertical angles.............. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . 7:!8 Number of soundings plotted ....................................... ·...... 1, 259 Amongst interesting results derived from the records of observations by Mr. Dall is that which proves the height of -:\loLrnt Saint Elias to have been heretofore unllerei!timated. D' Agelet, of the JJa Perum;e expedition, assigns an ele\·ation of only 12,u73 feet; and amongst several other authorities that vary from each other the greatest elevation hitherto stated is 17,855 feet. Mr. Dall's observations, made with care and umler circumstances favorable for accuracy, have been carefully tPsted in the Oompnting Division of the Office. The result is for lfotrnt Saint Elias an elevation of upward of rn,ooo feet. As proved from the samp, series of observatiorrs, Mount Fairweather and 1\lount Crillon have each an elevation exceeding 15,00.0 feet. Mr. D,tll's obsen·ations are confirma tory of the position marke(l by the eminent navigator, Captain Cook, for )fo11nt Saint Elias; and also of the positions assigned by the La Perouse records for Orillon and Fairweather, both of which have been erroneously marked on some subsequent charts. In Appendix No. 10 will be found an interesting paper by J\Ir, Dall on the determination of heights, including that of Mount Saint J<Jlias on the coast of Alaska. When in command of the United States ship Saranac, Capt. Thomas S. Phelps, U.S. N., formerly an officer on the Coast Survey service, and of large experience in hydrographic operations, had freqnent occasion to traverse the interior waters of the southeast coast of Alaska. Bis constant interest in such details prompted a communication iu "October last, which was gratefully accepted as containing suggestions fo regard to the relatiYe importance of the channels in that quarter, and which will have special value when means are available for giving effect to the suggested plan of work. COAST SURVEY OFFICE. The charge of the Coast Survey Office has remained with Assistant J. E. Hilgard. To his long experience, eminent ability, and thorough comprelrnnsion of the requirements of the work is due the effective co-operation of the office-operations with those of the field. In executive details, Assistant Bilgard bad the aid of Assistant F. W. Dorr, until increasing ill health made it desirable that he should be transferred to field-service in December last, since which time the same duties have been performed by Assistant Edward Goodfellow. Oomp11ting Division.-Assistant Charles A.. Schott bas continued in charge of this important diYision, and has kept it up to the high standard of exactness and efficiency maintained by him during many years, this abstract being based upon his twentieth annual report. The computations, according to their character, are distributed in general among the computers, as follows: Assistant T. W. Werner, though iu very feeble health, has computed the current simple triangulations. Dr. G. Rumpf attends to the secondary triangulations, their adjustment and revislon, furnishes all needful data for field-parties, and, where opportunity offers, attends to the bringing up of the older secondary triangulations. Mr. J. Main takes charge of the revision of the astronomical latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths, also of magnetic observations, and furnishes mean places of stars for observing-parties. Mr. E. H. Courtenay has charge of lea.st square adjustment of primary and secondary triangulations, of measures of vertical angles, and miscellaneous geodetic work. Mr. l\f. B. Doolittle attends to the least square adjustment of primary and secondary triangulations, spirit-levelings, and miscellaneous geod4:ltic work. Mr. B. H.Gerdes att~nds to the clerical duty of the division, sup1llies copies of records to field-parties, and inserts geographical positions in registers. During the year, the following temporary comput~rs were engaged:

THE U.XITIW STATES COAST SUUYEY-. Prof. R. Keith, on telegraphic longitude-wol'k, fol' three and a half months; Mr. J. H. Laue, temporari1y transferred from the Weights and Measures Department; Mr. F. Hudson, on reductions of latitudes and azimuth: Dr. C. Powalky, on astronomical latitudes; Mr. C ..Ferguson, on corn[Hl· tations of triangulation and love lings; Mr. J. B. Baylor and Mr. B. Caperton were employed a few days upon miscellaneous computations. Assistant Charles A. Schott personally examines and reports upon the work done under his charge, attends to the office-correspondence referred to him, and to such special discussions and computations as his time allows. He made the usual magnetic-observations in June la8t. The following reports submitted by him deserve special mention: JJiscussion of the magnetic-observations, both absolute and differential, made at Key ·west, Fla., between 1860 and 1866; aud the computation aud discussion of the three measures of the Atlanta base-line of 1872 and 1873. Under his direction, the factors for tbe computation of geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths have lmen extended from latitude 500 to latitude 6.P. With the addition of the similar table of factors from latitude 23° to latitude 50°, already pulJlisbed, and a preface prepared by the assistant in cll<Hge, this appears in A1>peuclix No. 19. Tidal Division.-Tbe inspection of the tidal and meteorological observations receivetl at the office, the correspondence with the observers and others relating to tides, the furnishing of tidal data when wanted, the superdsiou of the constrttction and repair of tide_-gauges aud of the computations relating to tides have been kept by n.. S. Avery, who bas been assisted in the computations by A. Gottheil, Mr. J. Downes, Mr. !J. P. Shidy, and Miss M. Thom as. A considerable amount of information respecting tides has been furnished for office-use, for o\Jservers and fie Id11arties, and also for engineers and others not connected with the survey. To do this, the ordinary reductions of all the observations received are made as soon as practicable, aud the results talrnlatecl, so that they can be furnished for charts or other nses on short notice. A particular acQOunt of ·what bas been done at each pe.rmanent tidal station has been given in the general statement of progress in tbe section in which it is situated. The predictions of titles for 1876, for both ea8tern and western coa8ts, are nearly completerl, and will soon be published. For some of the places, these ban been improve<! by using· the results of new discussions based ou longer series of obsen-ations 1 and such discussions form au important part of the labors of the tidal division. Hydrographic Division.-Capt. K. R. Breese, U.S.~., served as bydrographic inspector from December 27, 1874, to June 3, 1875, when he was relieved by Commander E. P. Lull, U. S. :X. Lieut. Henry E. Nichols and Acting Master Robert Platt, both of the Navy, are on duty in the office. Mr. E. Willenbucher has been employed as principal hydrographic draughtsman; 1\fessrs. W. C. Willeubncher and J. Sprandel as assistants. Their work includes the iu~pection and verification of hydrographic records and sheets, the plotting and drawing of sheets from the original notebooks, the preparation of projectioos for the hydrogrnphic parties, and various miscellaneou8 tracings and drawings. The hydrographic inspector acts as the immediate assistant of the Superintendent in uirectiug aud inspecting the construction, repairs, outfit, and presen-ation of the vessels of the Coast Snrvey. Drawing Dii1ision.-To this division is intrusted the preparation of all pn-tiections foi- fit>ldwork, the consideration of llrojects for charts, the reductions of the original topographic and bydrographic sheets, and the arraugement of the reduced drawings for the engraver or lithographer. The immediate direction of the details is in charge of Mr. W. T. Bright, whose experience and assiduity are constantly called into service. The information furnished from the office in reply to special calls, and consisting principally of · tracings from original sheets, is given in Appendix No. 3. Tbe charts completed or in progress, arranged in geographical order, arc given in Appen. dix No. 4. Of the persons employed, Mr. A. J,indenkohl has been, aR heretofore, engaged upon the more elaborate bydrograpbic reductions as well as upon the small scale of offshore charts. Mr. H. Lindenkohl, upon fine topographical reductions for harbor-charts and pbotolithograpbic maIJS and sketches. Mr. L. Karcher, principally in making tLe uumerous projections called for by the

EngraDilig Dim:sion.-The charge of this division has been continued with Assistant 1<1. Hergesheimer. Its labors are shown in detail in the table (A.ppendix :No. 5) of plates begun, in progress, and completed uuriug the period iudicater1. The distribution of work among the persons employed has been as followR: 1'rfessrs.·r. Enthoffer, S. Siebert, Il. C. Evans, A. Sengteller, W. A. Thompson, A. 1\-1. Maerlel, and R'. F. Bartle have been classified as topographical engravers; Messrs. E. A. l\Iaedel, l<'. Conrtena_y, and A.. Peterson as letter engravers; Messrs. H. M. Knight, J. G. Thompson, J. J. Young, E. H. Sipe, "VY. H. Davis, and W. H. Knight as miscellaneous engravers. The pantograph for the transfer and reduction of outlines has been used by Mr. E. 1\folkow. Mr. L. C. Kerr has performed the clerical duties of the division. Careful study has been given by Mr. Hergesheimer to the introduction of such improvcmc11ts iu desigtt anll execution as have seemed best adapted to advance the artistic character of the work in bis division. Electrotype and Photographic Division.-Dr. A.. Zumbrock has remained in charge, as1:1isted by Mr. Frank Over. His report, which will be found in Appendix No. 6, gives an iuteresti11g account of the improvements in methods and apparatus introduced by him in the course of the year. A very successful application of the recently-discornred process of st-0el-faciug c9pper plates has been made to the fiuely-engrnved plates of the centennial certificflte of stock for the Treasury Department. Since October 1, 1874, there have been prepared twenty-four altos, a.ml thirty-six bassos or printing-plates. Nine positives, twenty negatives, and fifty-four prints have been made for the mie of the <lraughtsmen and engravers. .Division of Charts and Instrume11ts.-The work of this division, which includes, besides the safekeeping of the archives and instruments, the printing of maps and the distrilmtion of charts and reports, the management of the instrument-shop and the carpenter-shop, has been directed by Mr. John T. Hoover, who has also kept the accounts of the office and made disbursements for the assistant in charge. The duty of registering and filing for convenient reference the original maps and charts, and records of obserYations m~de by the field-parties, and of keeping an account of the same as they are used temporarily in the office, was performed by Mr. G. A. Stewart. A period of ten sears having elapsetl since the publication of lists of the original topographic and h,ydrographic sheets, forming part of the archives of the sur\·ey, arranged in geographical order

from the date of their earliest registry, it has been deemed ad vi;.;aule to repuulish these lists (Appendices Nos. 7 and 8) with the addition of the original sheets which have been uepositetl in the archives since the year 18G5. During the :rear, the copper-1)1ate printer in the office, Mr. Frank Moore, has rendered 1.'3,319 copies of charts ready for issue. Mr. H. ~issen has prepared the backed drawiug-paper for field and office work, and also tlle miscellaneous duties pertaining to the folding-room. The map-room has remained under the care of Mr. Thomas l\faDonnell. An aggre-gat.e of 14.,000 copies of charts llas been issued during the year, and 532 copies of the annual reports of various years have been distributed. The work in the irnitrument-shop was done, under the supervision of Mr. John Ulark, by John Foller, ,V. Jacobi, G. N. Saegmuller, W. Suess, and E. Eshleman. The wood-work of in:strnments, their packing for transportation, and all carpentry work required in and about the office was done by Mr. A. Yeatman, assisted by F. E. Lackey and James Hess. Since the resignation of Mr. Y. E. King, in May last, the duties of clerk in the office of the assistant-in-charge has been satisfactorily performed by Mr. Charles H. Fitch. In the office of the disbursing-agent, Samuel Hein, esq., Mr. H. L. Hawkins has remained as priucipal uookkeeper and accountant. l\Iessrs. W. A. Herbert and W. I. Flenner have performed the clerical duties. In the <listrilmtion of means available for fielU and office work many details are inYolved, the adjustment of which, by the foresight and large experience of the disbursing-agent, Samuel Hein, esq., has invariably secured promptness in the operations. Under my immediate direction, Assistant W. ,Y. Cooper has also rendered, as heretofore, acceptable service. Respectfully suumitted. C. P. P ATTEHSOX, Superinte1ule11t irnited States Coaat .8urvey.

APPENDIX No. 6.
REPORT UPON ELECTROTYPING AND PHOTOGRAPHING, BY DR. A.. Z UMBROCK.

It lJecame necessary during tlie year to replace the old vat, used in the electrotype room for holdiug the copper solution, by a new one. The new vat, twenty inches wide, forty-two iuchcs deep and fifty.two inches long, lwl<ling about one lrnmlred and ninety gallons, is ma<le of tlJree· inch white-pine boards, tongued and grooYcd. Botll sides were covered with two coats of coal-tar, and just before being pnt together all of the joints were !'!en·ed with a hot cement of rosin, aspha1t, and coal-tar; when finished the sitme cement was applied boiling hot to all of the joints on the inside. The first trial of a.1ifatc in t!Jis new vat was made with tlte copper solution whicli had always worked well in the old one. Tt was foun1l that the copper was deposited iu regular vertical streaks or ridges, most of tile ridges running from top to bottom of the plate, others stopping short at different heiguts, as thougll a viscid fiui<l l!ad ruu dowu the plate. Some of tl!e ridges were oueeighth of au incl! wide, an<l there were often as many as five in the brea<ltli of one inch. vYeakeniug and strengtheniug the copper solutiou, filtering and boiling it, had no effect npoa tuis unusual :iction ~ neither bad a stmnger or weaker electric cnrrent. When the paper, throngh which some of tl.tc copper solution had IJeen filtered, was digested with alcohol, tile alcohol IJecame brownish, and left, after e,·aporation, au oily :Buid of an empyrenmatic odor. J~ther shaken with the solution, left, after evaporation, a similar fiuitl. A new copper solution acted in the same way. The effect was uudoubtellly due to the fact that the copper solution had dissolved some of the cement. A box of thin sheet-copper was then made to fit loosely in the ,·at, the narrow space betweea this copper case and the vat was fillell with melted paraffine, and with this arrangement the solution has worked very well. Last ~·ear Congress made au appropriation for the engraving and printing of the plate of the Uentennial stock-certificate by the Engraving and Printing Bureau of the Treasury Department. In order to print the number of impressious required for one million shares of stock, the Treasury Department rl'quested the Coast Survey Office to have ma<le twenty electl'Otype copies of the origi· ual plate. Tllis plate is twenty-two by twenty-six inches, weighing a!Jont fifteen pounds. To make so large a number of plates in additfon to our own work it became necessary to put up new batt~ries. The number of goocl sharp impressions which can l>e taken from a copper·plate Leing limited to ahout twelve hundred, it is evident that the required number of impressions could not be taken from twenty copper-plates; it was therefore desired to hani the plates 1' steelfaced ''-that is, covered with a thin layer of electrotype iron. After a number of experiments I succeeded with a solution recommended many years ago by Professor BOttger. I used a strong solution of one part of protosulphate of iron au,9. one-half part of chloride of ammonium; a. J>late of the best boiler-iron was employed as an anode and a weak electric current. In spite of tlw most careful cleaning of the copper-plate there were always some spots which woL1l<l uot take the iron unless the plate was removed from the solution and cleauecl very frequently. If during the deposition of the iron there should be the slightest evolution of hydrogen on the copper-plate, the plate would be spoiled, for each little bubble of gas will cause a minute hole or pit which takes the ink and spoils the impression. This evolution 'Of hydrogen must be prevented by the proper proportion between the strength of the solution, size of the plate, and battery-power. As soon as the proper amount of iron is deposited, the plate must be washed and dried rapidly or it wouhl immediately rust. This is best done by pouring hot water over the well-washed plate and drying it by means of a. soft cloth while yet hot; it should then be covered IJy a film of paraffine. The electrotype iron is quite hard and becomes a permanent magnet, tl!e eud of the plate which is lowt>st in the process becoming a north-pole. The amo11nt of iron deposited I found to be

88

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

2.56 milligrams for each square centimeter, equal to a thickness of 0.033 millimeter, or about oneseven-hundredth part of an inch. The iron deposit can be dissolvcll from the copper by acids with the greatest ease and without injuring the engraving in the slightest degree. After ten tlrnusanll good sharp impressions had been taken from one of these plates, the iron deposit seemed as perfect as ever. But sl10uld it at any time show signs of wearing off, the iron coul<l l.Je removed and a new deposit made upon the same copper-plate; and as this process could be repeated over and over again, there is, by the method of "steel-facing,~' practically no limit to the number of impressions which can be taken from one coppPr-plate. In the operations for photographing, several improvements llave been made in the large camera and its stand i I also constructed an apparatus for measurin_g- the photographic image on the wet plate. In consequence of these improvements, Jlhotographic reductions of charts are now made with much more expedition and accuracy than heretofore. The collodion, varnish, anu some of the other chemicals used in photographing and electrotyving were made by me. During the autumn of 1874 some experiments were made in transferring drawings upon a copper-plate by photographing aml etching by perchloride of iron. A tlolished copper-plate was silvered, exposed to vapors of iodiuc in the dark, exposed to the light under an inverted urgative, fixed by byposulphite of soda and ni.rnished witll a tongh transparent varnish. The drawing was then engraved with a dry point and etched with perchloride of iron. In the opinion of experts this process is quite a success.

HEPORT ON THE TELEGRAPHIC DETERMINATION OF THE LONGITCDE OF KEY WEST, BY CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANT IN THE COAST SURVEY.

DEAR SIR: In compliance with your direction, a second computation and redsion of tile difference of longitude between 'Washington and Key West bas been made, and the following report on the results is herewith respectfully submitted:
INTRODUCTION.

The trigonometrical survey of tLe islands and reefs skirting the southern shore of Florida has depended, since 1849, for its standard longitude on a number of moon-cu1minations and on a chronometric determination-means which it was desirable to have superseded by the more accurate method of employing· the electric telt.>grapb. This would afford a check on the old work, and furnish a precise determiuation of the longitude of an extreme southern point of the triangulation, both for the immediate use of the Coast Stlr\'ey as well as, prospectively, for the extension of the telegraphic SJ-stem of longitudes over the regions of the Gulr aud Cariubean Sea. The telegraphic determination of tl1e longitude between \\'ashington and Key \-Vest was executed jointly by the United States Coast Survey and the Cuited States Naval Obser,·atory, and under the direction of their respective superintendents. The observations at the Naval Oln~ervatory were made by Profs. W. Harkness and .J. H. Eastmau, U. S. N., and Assistant Ohserver E. Frisby; those at· Key \Vest by Subassistant Edwin Srnitl1, United States Coast Survey. Professor Eastman made the computation of the transits at \Vashitq~ton, the results of which were communicated by Rear-Admiral C. H. Davis, Superintendent, uuder <late of November 6, 1874; a second computation was made by myself; the first computation of the transits at Key \Vest was UJade by the observer and by Prof. H,, Keith, of the 'Gnited States Coast Survey, and the second computaf'ion by Mr. James l\laiu, of the Compnti11g Division, Coast. Surwy Office. The arrangement for the telegraphic connection of the two stations was made by G. W. Dean, .Assistant in the Coast Survey. Tbe Survey is indebted to General Thomas T. Eckert, general superintendent of the Western Union Telegraph, for facilities given while nsing the Jin<' . .Automatic an<l arbitrary sigrmls were t.ransmitted by means of break-circuit arraugements. Exchanges took place on seven nights between the dates December 24, 1873, and January 11, 1S74·
DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVING·STATIONS AND OF
L.~STRUMENTAL

OUTFIT.

The station at Washington is the site of the transit-circle, 77.8 feet, or 0·.066, west of the center of the dome of the Obser\·at.ory. Tl.tis instrument is in latitude + 38° 53' 3811 .8, and in longitude 51i osm 12·.16 west of Greenwich, as determined, by means of transatlantic cables, in 1866, 1870, and 1872. A description of this transit.circle, made by Pistor and Martins, of Berlin, is contained in the Washington Observations for ISM; a briefer account of it is found in the introduction to the Washington Observations for 1873 (p. xviii aud following). It suffices here to state that the tele· scope has a clear aperture of Sk inches, and a focal length of 145 inches nearly; the magnifying power habitually used is 186 diameters. Of subsidiary apparatus connected with it, there are a pair of collimators mounted in the meridian of the instrument and plaeed within the observingroom. The position of the axis is reversed at the beginning of eaeh calendar year, and the line of C91limation is determined at suitable intervals. During 1873, the clamp.end was east; during 1874, it was west; a reversal therefore took place while the longitude work wat> in progress, a circmn·

sta1rne which could only be favorable to the accuracy of the result. The standard sidereal clock, made by Kessels, of Altona, is in electric connection with a barrel-chronograph, the speed of which is regulated by a Hipp vibrating spring. The beats of the clock are registered in consequence of the pendulum making contact through a globule of mercury. The chronograph works with one pen, recording automatic and arbitrary signals, and revolves once each minute. The electro-mag~ netic apparatus used for sending and receiving longitude-signals is entirely automatic. (See uescription in the Wmlbington Observa.tions for 18()7, Appendix 1.) At Key West, Fla., the Coast Survey established a temporary observing-station in front of the United States naval depot. It is marked by a brick pier, 24 feet north and 6 feet west of the center of the soldiers' monument in Clinton Place. The pier was left standing; it is capped with a :flagstone having a cross-cut marking its center. This site is also 471.50 feet south and 295.04 feet east of Tift's Observatory, or lookout, one of the trigonometrical stations of the Survey, hence position of astronomical station, in latitude 240 33' 26".5 and in approximate longitude [)h 27m 13·.84 west of Greenwich. The transit-instrument was one of the pattern known as meridian telescope (No. 13 of the Survey); it bas a clear aperture of 1~ inches, and a focal length of 26 inches. The maker, Mr. W. WU.rdemann, states that, with the diagonal eye-piece, the magnifying power is about 70 diameters. The eye-piece has no para1lactic motion, in consequence of which only the three iuuer tallies of the glass diaphragm were used at Key West. The horizontality of the axis was ascertained by means of a striding-level; the pivot inequality is very small. In connection with the im;trument, there. was used a Hipp fillet-chronoiiraph, Coast Survey No. 5, using one pen, and two break-circuit sidereal chronometers, Frod:-;ham No. 3477. as standard chronometer, and Parkinson & Frodsham ~o. 2795, as an auxiliary instrument. No. 3477 beats half-seconds and breaks every second; No. 2795 beats four-tenths of a second and breaks every even second. The observer remarks that the instrument did not prove quite as steady as expected; it is ascribed to the immediate proximity of the sea, and to its smaJI (a few feet) elevation above its level.
RELA'.l'lVE PERSONAL EQUATIONS.

The observations for personal equation are meager, and not of a very satisfactory character. The preparations which were then in progress for observing the transit of Venus were interfering, to a co11siderable extent, with a more precise determination of the personal equations between the t:ieveral ol>serveL·s. The observers are indicated by the initial letters of their names. The following three equations were taken from the volume of the V{asbington Observations for 1873, p. Iii ot' introduction. Since they refer to clock-correction, I.he signs of the constants bave been changed, in order to refer them directly to clock-time, which is tlie thing actually observed or noted: July 30, 1873, 0 = + o·.18 +II - F Sept. 30, 1873, 0 = - 08 .06 + E - F Nov. 5, 1873, 0 = + 0·,16 + H-E The following equation was derived from transit-observations at the United States Naval Ob8l'I'vatory, eacb observer using his own instrument.· A correction for small difference of meridians was appli~d, an(l the personal equation refers, as above, to clock-time: April 27, 29, May 3, 11, 1874, 0 = - 0".11

+ E- S

Observations made by II about this time led to no o;atisfactory results. The following two equations are the results of comparisons made with a portable persona.I. equation apparatnst at t11e Coast Survey Office: May 20, 1874 .·· 0 = 0".07 + F - S May 20, 21, 1874 0 = - 0·.01 + E-S - - - - - - - ---·------·

+

*Tb is method has two clrawhacks: first, its excessive labor, both of observing and oemputing; sooondly, its indirectness, by necessarily including or mixing up with th0 '}Uantity soa.ght a numb0r of so-called inst.roment.al constant!!. 1 Observations ma.de April 8, 9, 10, 187'.4, with an inferior apparatus, are not int.-udnoed.

Reforriug, in ge.neral, for notation and method of reduction of transits to Coast Sun·eJ· RPports for 18G6, 1868, and 1872,t it suffiees to state. tllat, for the obse.n·atious with the 'Vasliington transit-circle, the corrections to the observed clock-time for level, collimation, a11d persomtl equation were :tpplicd at once. Conditional equations and normal equations we.re then formed for the determination of the clock-rate, the azimuthal de,·iation, and the final clock-correction. 'Veights were int.roducPd, depending on the number of wires observed, and upon the star's declination.

To determine the clock-correction 6 T 0 for au assumed middle epocl.J T 0 , the azimuthal de\'iHtion, and tl.Je clock-rate, we obtHin, from the general expression a= T + L. t + r (a-T0 ) +a A+ b B + c C, by putting t = T + b B + c C and 6.

T + ;; T, where ;; T is a correction to an approximate '\'alue c::, T, tl1f\ form of the conditional equations: <1 T +a A+ r (a -T0 ) =a - t - 6 T Besides the weights introduced from number of wires observed, each of these expressions is specially weighted, depending ou the declination of the star. These latter weights, p, are taken from the table given in Appendix: No. 12, Coast Survey Report of 1872 (p. 223); they are deduced from the expression of the probable errors of observationz

In the case of the Key West observations, they are reduced by the method explained in the Heport of 1872 (p. 225); tl.Je stars observed with clamp W are treated by themselves, and furnish two normal equations determining;; T and a,; similarly the stars observed with clamp E give two normal equations determining 11'l1 and a, 11 ; now for the same middle epoch T 0 , the two values found for aT must be identical; if not, small changes in assumed values of rand c must be introduced until they .become identical. Each night's work, therefore, furnishes two sets of normal equations. The conditional equations were weighted as before, but, to save space, are not given here. The correctioQ for dinrnal aberration is introduced by itself. The equatorial intervals of the lines of meridian-telescope No. 13 are as follows: For clamp west

The above probable error to the clock-correction does not include the uncertainty arising from variation in personal equation. Apparently, the rate of the Kessels clock undergoes very rapid changes, especially noticeable January 9 and January 10, when the daily rate was almost zero, yet the hourly rate at the time of observation was large and of opposite sign on the two nights. 1Vhetller all of this is real or attributable in part also to dinrual changes in the condition of the instmment, especially in collimation at n. time when the temperature changes rapidly, or to a diurnal variation in the obser,'er's personal equation, cannot; be decided from the present observations. The subject has received attention at the United States Naval ObservatoQ .·
"Tl.le rtiadtir may be referred to Appendix: III, Wasbington OlJ;ervations for 1867 (printed in lt-<70). Seo also Appendix I, W&Shington Observations for 1867, note, p. 25. Iu the manuscript oontainiug the rooults deduced at tbc observaoory, bonrly rates greater than those given above have b~en admitted.

.APPENDIX No. 10.
HEPORT ON MOUNT SAIN'f BLIAS, MOUNT FAIHWEATHER, AND SOME OF TIIE ADJACENT MOCNTAINR BY WILLIAM H. DALL, ACTING ASSISTANT IN THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

1.-HISTORIOAL NOTES.
On the 20th of.July, 1741 (old l'lt;de), Ilering aud hi1< nssociatN1 marlt> the continental shore of Northwest Anwric11, aml, iu whiit tl1P~ estimated as latitude ;"IHO 15' aml longitude 1240 40' west from Ferro, the.v saw a great mountaiu, aud uuder it a point, wliicb tl1ey named after Saiut Elia><, tbe patron saint of the day. It is probable tbat U1ey saw about tlw Ha me time all the otller high peaks of t.he adjaC1lt region, though the fact is uot mentioned iJJ the imperfect records existi11g of thiii expeditiou. On the 3d of J\fay, 1778, Capt. James Cook, in sl:'arch of a northeast pasRage, saw a beautiful peak, which he named l'!Iount Fairweather, ;iml I\ Lif'L lw placed i11 latitude 58° 52' north and longitude 1380 we:,;t from Greenwich. The next tla.v, Im raised it grPat peak to the uorthward, am!, helil'ving it to he that St>en by Bering, be placed it on his chart as )fount Saint Elias~ in latitude Goo 27' and longitude u10 west. Considering the great advance iu nantkal i11Rtrnme11ts and tables since the days of Cook, tliese re8ults are extremely cretlitable. Cook did not attempt to measure the heights of either of these mountains, as far as we can learn from the anthorizf'd edition of his vo.vage. In 1786, the celebrated La Perouse saw Saint Eliai:s 011 thP 23d of June, and his iistrouomer, <l' Agelet, essa,\"ed to ineasure it with sext:rnt :mgles from tlte \"Pssel. The heigltt resulting from bis observations was 1,890 toises, or about 12,600 foet. As the lati tulle assigned for the Yessel's poiiit,iou, however, was indubitably ten or twelve miles in error, no Wt<igbt can be assigm·d to bis result. His assumed base-line was hardly less tbau fifteen miles too short. Shortly afterward, he saw Mount Fairweather, and anotlwr high mountain, which he named Mouut Crillou, after the French ministe1· of marine; I.mt it does not ap11ear from his uarratirn tliat the height of either was determined by his part_\'. The positions he as8igued to them are, 1w,·ertbeless, quite near to the latest determinations. In 1787, Douglas saw Mount Saint Elias, on tlie 2d of Augu1o1t; an1l in this ~·ear the first Hus_ Rian Pxploratious of this part of the coast. were ma<le hy Becharf'ff and 1"111yloft'. Tb~~- me not recorded as passing to the 80uth of Lituya Ba_y, where tl1ey liatl al reads hePn preee(lt>d hy La Perouse. About this time, DUID('J'ous English and A merica11 trndiug-\-essels were fitted o_ut for commercial operations in this region. Though much iucidental gPograpl!ical information was thus obtained, I have discovered nothing of importance relative to the pl'Psent suhj<'et. On the 19th of June, 1791, Sefior Don Alessandro Malespina iiaw SHint Elias, and attempted from on shipboard to 111pasure lt8 height. Ile found it to be 17,851 ft>.et, which in the rouud uumbers of 1 i,800 aud 17,800 feet has been ado11ted ou ma.uy charts, and is 11earel' the truth than the estimates of an_\· other uavigatol" which ha\·e l>eeu published. l<'or Fairwe<1tl1er he obtained a height of 14,695 feet, which is also not ver·y far from the truth. On tbe 28th of June, 1794, Van<>,ouver saw Saint Blim1, aud givt'8 in his vo.yage the first vi''"" of it whieh was e'\"er published. · This was taken from the "\'iciuit~- of Icy Bay, and bears some r~semblance to tbe roouutain, though 1111rnh seems in the plate to have been i;iacrificed to artistic effect. Vancouver placed the peak in latitude ooo 22'.5 and lougitude 140° 3!!' west, bt'iug ,·ery near the 1·ecent determinations in latitude, but too far to the e,ast ward. The same may he said of his position for Mount Fairweather, which he located July 25, 1794, in latitude 58° 57' aud lougitude 1370 13' west. Be appears to have made uo attempt to mPas1ne tbe ele\'ation of either

peak.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Sir Edward (now Admiral) Belcher, iu 1837, w:u; the next navigator of impnrtauce to visit this region, and from his narratfre it wonld i;;eem that he placed special importance on the iletermination of the position a11d beigbt of 8aint Elias. He failed, however, to get observations of pre· cii;;ion from on shore at Point Hiou, as he ha<l intended ; and that his resnlts were satisfactory we . ma:y doubt, as be does not give any elevation or position for the mountain in his narrative, and even omits it entire!,\· from hi,; drnrt. This, notwithstanding bis mention of baviug obtaiued sat. isfactory observations. \Yhate,·er the results may have been, most unfortunatels they do not appear to have been made public n11der his name, exceilt a view which be gives of the mountain, which is hardly more satisfactory tha11 that of Vancouver. Tebeukoff.vhiited thrn regio;1· in 1847, and from his hy1lrographic notes we learn that he placed the peak in latitude (JOO 2~'.G and longitude 1400 54' west, with a height of 17,000 feet. Ile mentio11s that Vasil ieff from his n·ssel determined the height of Mount 11'airweather as 13,946 foet, and placed it in lat,iturle 58° 57' and lo11gitnde 137° 27' west. Since that time the coast baR beeu annually visited by wh;ilers aml traders; lmt their ohservations, if any, have not been made public; and it bas been reserved for the Coast Survey, through one of its parties, to make the latest, and, we have reaRon to believe, the most precise contribution to onr knowledge of the subject. 'fhe United States Coast Surve,y schooner Yukon, under my charge, with Mr. Marcus Baker as astronomical observer, left Sitka on the 11th of l\Iay, 1874. \Ve rated our eight chronometers on the 5tu by mea11s of very slltisfactory ob,;ervations of equal a. m. and p. m. aHitudes of the sun. On the 13th, we ubtaiued forenoou sPxtaut altitudes from a sea-vosition on :Mounts Fairweather aud Crillon; similar observations in the afternoon anti 011 the following day. On the 15th we entered Lituya Bay, where we remained uu til the morning of the 19th. Here an astronomical position and azimuth we1e well determi1wd ou 8hore with the sextant, n·rtical circle, and theodolite, and con nected with a triangulatiou iududiug Mounts Fairweather anti Crillon. Vertical ang-Jes for the altitude of these mountains were obtained with the tlwodolite. Ou leaving I-'ituya Ba;, while beclllmed in its immediate viciuity, and wit.b our positiou well fixed by bearings on known 1,oiuts of the shore, additional sextaut-alt.itudes were obtained on Mounts Orillon, Fairweather, atHl Saint Elias. 011the20t!J, iu the vicinity o1 Dry Bay, with a po8ition well fixed by a large series of observations for time and latitude, additional ob8en-ationii with the sextant were obtained on Mount Saint Elias. On the. 21st, we entered Port l\folgrave. On the 2~d, a series of observations similar to those mentioned at Lituya were obtained, and completed on the 23d, together with the rernaiuller of the triangulation ou ~fount Fairweather, and a portion of oue on tlaint Elias. A lull and carefol series Qf double-zenith distances, on Mounts Saint "Elias, Fairweather and several other mountains, was obtained and connected with the astronomical azimuth line. On the 24th, additional astronomical obsen·ations were made-the 25th being occupied with a reconnaissance survey of the port-and on the 26th we sailed from Port Mulgrave. 011 our way out, intersections on Mounts Cook and Vancouver were made by compasa-beariugB, from a position fixed by bearings on the land. At the same time a ski;tcb was obtained of Mount Saint Elias. On the ~7th, from a µosition at sea determined b_y sextant-observations for time and latitude, we obtained a series of sextant-altitudes 011 Mount Saint Klias; and au azimuth was observed directly between the mon11taiu au1l the sun with the same instrument. On the 7th of Juue we were enabled to rate our chronometers again with good success at Saint Paul, Kadiak. From tbe material thus obtaiued, the rmmlts, tabulated with previous measurements, below hM'e been arrived at.

Mount Cook aud Mount Vancouver are two high peaks of the Saiut Elias Ranµ;e, to the 1<011~· ward and eastward of Mount Saiut J<:mas; and by the authority of the Superintendent of the United States Coast Sun"ey, as tlwy ba-rn been hitherto wiUiout distinct appellations, are 11ow named iu honor of those dist.inguished navigators. In like manner, to a high peak near the sea at Icy Cape, just south and east of Lit11ya BaJ, is 11ow applied the 1111me of La Perouse. Of this, we. were only able approximatel,y to fix the position and height. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. The elevation heretofore assigned to Mount Saint Elias has \·aried gre.atly.

inaccessible, and in most cases onl_v the result of the ol'iginal computations was preserved, it is hardly worth while to attempt any further reconciliation of these discrepancies. It is possible, boVl"eYer, that part of them may bf'. due to a hitherto unsusµecwd cause, uamely, that of mistaken identity. Off shore, Mount Saiut Elias ios unmistakable. Risiiig above the fogs, which at some oseasous en·elop its bnse, it may be f'!el'n when all other lund is far below the horizon. But in appronching the coast at Port Mulgrnve, it is often loi1t sight of before its position, relative to the port, can be recognized. This was the case 011 the occasion of our visit. After being a fow bourR in port,'the fog cleared up considnahly, a11d we saw a very Ligh peak in about tht' direction in which we imppm;ed Saint Elias to bt>al'. l\ly sailiug-mastt'r ideutified it as that mountain, as he bad seen it for several weeks on a previous vi,;it. ,Judge, tl.1e11, of our surprise when, later, the distant haze disappeared, and the majeostic peak of the true Saint Elias \.Jecarne visiblt>, He then declared that during his previous stay at Port .i'ilulgrave, hazy weather prevailing, he had never sel'll the real mountain at all, and had ascribed tl1e difference in it:s appearance from that of Saint Elias, as seen from the sea, to his different point of dew. The error might easily occur, as tlw St'COllll 111ou11tain (Mount Uook) seems to be upward of 16,000 feet in height. It is al,,;o uearer Port MulgTave, and its position mm·p, easterly than thnt of Mount Saint Elias, as is the position gh·eu hy some of the authorities for the great peak, to the eastward ot its true positiou. Some details as to the appearance of :\lount Saiut Elias and l\lonnt Fail'weat her, and the characteristics of this great uplift, may uot be out of place here. Mount Saiut Elias, from the entrance of Yakutat Bay, as rt>preA.euted in the accompanyiug sketch, (No. 22), rises from a confused mass of broken rnountaius behiml an elen1ted table-laud.· This plateau is a.ppan·ntly two or three hundred feet iu Leight, and, as mentioned by La Perouse, in some places the sea breaks agaiust its base, ;.ill(l i11 others a low and narrow strip of flat beach, formed by streams cutting through t,be escarprnl'nt, iuttcrvenes between the cliff and the Rea. These flats are greeu, and ofteu covered with spruce aud alders. The top of the table-land appears quite destitute of vegetation, resembling a plowed .field, with heaps of bowlders and gravel irregularly distributed upon it. This is probably J!,facial detritus. The face of the cliff on the northwest shore of the Ba~' of Yakutat is evidently composed of nearly horizontal i:itratified rockR. These we supposed to be similar to the horizontal Tertiary strata fourul at various points near Port Mui grave, on the opposite side of the bay. Large patches of clean, undisturbed snow lay in various ph1ces 011 the top of the table-land; but we saw nothing rest>mbling a glacier there. The surface of the platt>au rise8 a little from the edges of the cliffs, and then falls to the axis of a \·alley pan1Uel with the .trend of the mountaini;, wtich is interposed between the table-hmd and the bai,;e of the range. In this valley Revera! small glaciers terminatt', having their sources on the lower part of th"' mountain-sides. A considPrable l'tream, the waters of which are probably cle,.ived from the melting of the glaciers, falls b1>11ce into the bay. At the head of the Bay of Yakutat is a small inlet caI:ed Diseuchautmeut Bas, where glaciers come down to the st'a, aud send tbeir floating fragments, lade11 with t>arth and stoiws, out into the sea. But from the mountains which border on the Bay of Yakutat itself 110 such icti comes down. To the eai;t of the pt·ak the rnui:i;e iH continuous with Saint Elias, and also apparently to the northwest of it, read1iug to at least twu-thircls the height of the peak itself. t;eparatt>d from Elias by a deep trough, in which two large beds of suow and ice lie, one somewhat below the 0U1er, and with their axis in a northwesterly direction, some small, rather rounded mountains descencl toward the plateau. Toward the bottom of the e111't·8ontheast tlauk of Saiut Eliais is a great rocks amphitheater, with bigl1, ragged sides, 01w11 to the south and east. ln this is a simllar snow-b<'d. These beds, beiug destitute of latern.l or other moraines, and apparently 1iuable to move, from the peeuliari.ties of the topograph:r, we 811pposed wtire 11oc true glacier1:1, and, ind1·ed, from our 1>0sitiou we oould see nothiug on the flanks of the peak which was unmistakably a glacier. The great amphitheater may he the crater of an extinct volcano; \mt the fact that bedded strata, without the curves mmal in beds of igneous rocks, were plainly visible iu the face of il;s cliffs, and conformable with those 011 the adja{~ent rock:-foce of Elias, rendered this doubtfal. The impression it left ou our minds was that it was not a crater.

Pre-eminent in grandeur is the southern face of the mountain. With few and but im1ignificant foot-hills, it rises abruptly from the valley; and~ at about five thousand feet above its base', the entire side of the mountain is for med of an im~nense rock-face, incli11ed at an anglu of 4;')o tu the sea, rit;ing eight or ten thousand feet without a ureak in its continuity. It terminates somewlta,t irregularly above, and the upper contours of the peak remind one of the granite peaks of the Californian Sierras. The apex is pyramidal, sharp, and clearly cut, leading to the inference that it is precipitous on the invisible northern side. The whole of the great l'Ock-face is marked by straight, rigid lines of bedding, which are inclined uniformly to ·the eastward, at an angle of about ten degrees. There seemed to be but little snow on th"' upper portions of the mountain, though the lower peakR to the eastward were of a uniform white. We ascribed this to the topographical features which afford the wind every facility for carrying away any snow almost as rapidly as it falls. At the apex, there was no crater, nor any appearance of one; nor did an,y sign of smuke or steam appear in the vicinit_y of the mountain during the whole time it was visible to us. Mount Fairweather presents somewhat similar characteristics. Like Elias, it is separated from the sea by a plateau, with a valley behind the latter parallel with the shore and the trend of the range. But the upper surface of this table-land is more irregular, and is covered in parts with a · dense forest, which creeps up the side of the rnountaiu for four thousand feet, and fades away near the snow-line. The mountain is more extended east and west than Saint Elias, and consists of a. small, angular peak, with a. long, high shoulder on either band. The sides are seamed with rifts and valleys of denudation iu whose lower parts at least tunr large glaciers were evident. The angular cliff-forming structure so marked in t'1e Yosemite region of California, seemed especial!J· to characterize this and its adjacent mouutaius. Their upper portions were abunaantly supplied with snow; but here, again, was nothing which, by any stretch of the imagination, could be taken for a crater. · By a reference to the map, it will be seen that the portion of the range iu which these great elevations occur is at the apex, so to speak, of a deep curve in the shore of th~ coutine11t, forming what has been termed by the Coast Survey the Gulf of Alaska. The m1rve of the range is sharper than that of the coast, as lowlands intervene between the mountains and the shore. The greater pressure occurs in the region of sharper curves in all mountain-building, and here we have, as might naturally be expected, the greatest elevations on the continent in the region of unsurpassed mount· ain-folding. The extraordinary roughness of the topography is, in a general way, the result of two systems of plication, subsidiary to the greater flexures of the rang'· as a whole. One, the primary system, is of i;Mications parallel to the axis of the range; and the other, a secondary system, with plications at right angles to that axis. The fissure valleys of the second series are less conspicuous than the more extensive but proportionately shallower folds of the first series. The main direction of the coast-line is coincident with the primary series. The chief features of the local topograph_y are determined by the secondary series. Only the strongest of the!!e cross, from the mountains, the inner primary folds, and form bays in the shore-line beyond. Most of the glaciers for which this region is remarkable take origin in the snows of the higher elevations; are molded in the upper portion of the secondary valleys, and arriving at the first primary valley, are turned aside, and for the rest< f their course run parallel with the axis of the moulita.ins a.nd the· trend of the shore. A few, 'nvariably the largest, find a path ready hewn for them in the stronger secondary valleys above mentioned, which conducts them across the first primary fold to tho sea-shore. None of those on the main coast, betwen Cape Spencer and Point Riou, appear to cross the beach. When the terminus of the secondary fold is sufficiently pronounced to form a deep uay, then the glacier may reach the water, and its cast-oft' fragments appear as mimic bergs. In these cases the slope is always much steeper and sharper than when the furrow is t-00 wide to form a marked indentation of the shore-line. In front of all glaciers which reach the sea, white discolored water is to be observed, butexteusive shoals are not formed, the detritus being too fine to sink before being widely distributed. 1Vbero only H.

the torrents from the island glaciers are discharged, shoflls are invariably present. This generalrzation is of wide application, and important in its bearings on the question of glaciation in general. The character of the topography is such that it is inconceivable that a continuous glacier, moving in any direction, could have ever coYered the western slope of these mountains. That it did not, we have abundant proof, which may more pro1)erly find a place elsewhere . . We are able t-0 contribute some facts of importance to the knowledge of the material of which tLis range was built, and to the character of ih; peaks. Wherever we were able to reach tlle bed-rock of the range, as at Lituya Bay and T>ort Muigrave, we found it to be syenite, often associated with garnets. Here and there, as at Point Fairweather, apparently at points of greatest lateral pressure, were small, low craters, rarely conical, usually partaking more or less of the character of fissures, from which basalt and recent red lavas have been sparingly emitted. These small vents are near the bases of the mountains, and seldom greatly disturbed the horizontal Tertiary beds of sandst( nes and conglomerates which border on the mountain masses of syeRite unconformably. The bare lowland which has been formed by subaerial and glacial wear, is often tinged with red by the lavas. The detritus overlies the Tertiary ~trata, but where the bed-rock of the range comes down to the sea, volcanic material is entirely absent from the talus. At Port Mnlgrave, the lower portion of the foot-hills contains beds of limestone, meta,morphosed into coarsely crystalline marble, such as was found farther south by the · Coast Survey party of 1867 under Assistant George Davidson, and is not infrequent in the Sierras. There are also quartzites, much metamorphosed, undt Tlying the nearly-horizontal and sparinglyfossiliferous Tertiary beds. The conclusions, then, to which these facts would seem to lead us are as follows: That these Alps are, like the high Sierra of California, mainly composed of crystalline rocks, and in their topography, their small, pustular, basaltic vents, their associated marbles, quartzites, and later conglomerates, exhibit a close parallel to the Sinras; that parallelism in structure and composition implies parallelism in age and method of formation ; and, finally, that the volcanic origin of the high peaks is opposed not only by analogy, but by the known facts. A glance at the accompanying sketches will lead any one familiar with the types of mountain structure toward the conclusion that these peaks are not of the volcanic type, and, even without confirmatory evidence, would lead to the snspicion that they were composed of crystalline rocks. I do not doubt that small eruptions have taken place in comparatively recent times from the vents alluded to, which may have led unscientific observei s to suppose that the peaks themselves were -volcanic, eE·pecially if they examined only the detritus, which in some localities is largel,y composed of basalt and lava. With regard to volcanic activity, I find no recorded oJservations of any relating to thesil'!leaks, except Saint Elias, and that only as foUows. In a manuscript translation of Tebenkoff's hydrographic notes on this region (most of which, by the by, are incompatible with recent observations), I find this statement: " In 18:39, Saint Elias pe!lk began to send forth, occasionally, smoke and ashes from a crater on its northeast side. Accordiug to reports collected by Tebenko:ff, -during the earthquake in Sitka, in 1849, the peak of Saint Elias sent forth flame and ashes."-tNotes 011 Chart VII.) Now, uo civilized mau has yet beheld the northeast side of Mount Saint Elias, and, therefore, if smoke and ashes appeared from that quarter, it could not have been determined whether they came from that mountain, or some lower peak beyond. But as there were a~ that time no civilized inhabitants at Yakutat, I agree with Grewingk, who bad all the material before him, in placing n-0 credence in the statements above quoted. After thorough search, I have been able to find no trust worthy account of any eruption. I was informed by one Russian that he had, on a voyage fromSitka, seen smoke and flame issuing from the peak of Saint Elias, and he gave a glowing account of the magnificent spectacle it presented. Another person, a passenger on the same voyage and vessel, afterward told me that indeed he had seen the mountain very plainly, but that the story of an eruption was a complete fiction. It is, therefore, not impossible that Tebenkoff might have been similarly deceived. Grewingk, discussing the same question, argues that since no trustworthy account exists of an eruption, it becomes unsafe to assert tliat it has occ11rred, and suggests that it may be placed in the same category with a volcano reported by 8pani.t:1h navigators on Oiipe Mendocino, which bas 1011 g

since been provecl to l.Ja\·e no existence. He says: "Though Saint Elias stands in the volcanic line of Iliamna, Nnnfrak, and Saint l\fathew's Tslancl, nevert,beless we believe its ¥olcanic natnre may justly be dou!Jted, since the absence of a crater or conical form, aml its ragged crest, make it >ery probable that it has never been penetrated by a volcanic cbimney. 11 · · · "The proximity of the active volcano of \Vrangell to Saint Elias renders it improbable that the subterranean fires would seek, so near, an indubitably difficult egress thro11gh the giant of American mountains." The great height of Saint Elias is also opposed to its asserted volcanic nature, aml the recent determination of the sedimentary (Cmtaceous) structure of Aconcagua and other high peaks of South America, which have always hit.1erto ranked among volcanoes, i~ worthy of being noted in the present connection. . We may, therefore, say, at least, that the presumption is in favor of the non.volcanic c!Ja.racter of Saint Elias, and that the burden of proof rests with those wllo may still be inclined to assert its volcanic origin.

IL-DISCUSSION OF THE DATA.
Jn the computations accompanying this report are given, first, all the data necessary to the ·computer, followed by the computations of the positions of the peaks in question; and, lastly, the computations of the beights, resulting from the vertical angles and double,zenith distances meas· ured on the several peaks, aud their computed distances from the points at which tbe obsen·atious were taken. · Ilence, any one, with the data here fornisbed, can pursue the computations according to the method be may prefer, and have all the material necessary for forming an independent jndgment on the value of our results. The mountains referred to are Mount Crillon, Mount Fairweather; two peaks of great height in the range to the eastward of Mount Saint Elias, now first named by the United Stat~s Coast Survey Mount Cook and Mount Vancouver, respectively, and Mount Saint Elias itself. The means by which the positions of these mountains were obtained are of different values. Mount Crillon was determined by a triangulation from Lituya. B:i.y, connected with a measured hase and an m;itro. nomically-determined azimuth line. The angle at the peak was of course unobserved, and being very small, I regard the results as of only secondary value. Mount Fairweather was determined by ..iorizontal angles, referred to an astronomical azimuth from the astronomical stations at Lituya Bay and Port Mulgrave. The angle of intersection, t.11ough not observed, being not far from a rigb.t angle, the included error cannot greatly afr"ect the compu· tation for position, and I believe the result'\ to be as satisfactory as the method will allow. The positions of Mounts Cook and Vancouver were determined by horizontal angles, referred to the azimuth line from the astronomical station at Port Mulgrave, and intersected by bearings taken from the vessel when in a well-determined position in the western portion of the Bay of Yakutat. The intersecting angles are moderately large, but the method is much less satisfactory than if both angles had been measured with the theodolite, and I regard the results as approximate only. The position of Mount Saint Elias was fixed by horizontal angles connected with the azimuth ine at Port l\lulgrave, by azimuth obsen·ations taken directly on the peak from a weJJ.determined sea-position, aud by confirmatory bearings from a very well determined sea-position at Dry Bay. The latter, however, bave not been used in the computations. The unobserved angle beiug nearly 600, the liability to error is reasonably small. Our position for tbe mountain is within a t.hird of a mile of that assigned t-0 it by Captain Cook, and is, in my opinion, sufficiently sati&fa.ctory to remove any doubt as to the probability of serious error arising in the results from uncertainty of position. The vertical angles for elevation are also of different classes. The ~rst of these eo1r1prises sextant-angles.' Except under the most favorable circumstances, antl especially unless within a comparatively ~hort distance of the object measured, I do not consider tbese as being of any great value.

UEPOHT OP THE surEmNTENDE~T OF

The uncertainties of position and refraction are so great as to render the result in most cases off only the most general character. I ha Ye, therefore, r1,jected a large number of these olisenatiom. Thol'e which I baYe admitted, in most. cn8es, I do not cm1sider of !mfficient precision to unite with the results of vertical circle or tbeo11o1ite observatious for the 1rnrpose of obtaining a mean. In one case only-that of Mount Fairwt>ather, where the elevation was measured from welldetermined positions close to the base of the mountain, and not far from the stations at which the other class of obserYations were obtained-have I ·Tentmed to use them in snch a manner. I have inserted some computations of such observations in separate columns; but, with the exception already noted, rather as a matter of curiosity than as a source of reliable information. Mount Crillon was measured from five or six-different points with the sext:oint. I bave given the best of these observations, but place no confidence in them. It was also measured from Lituya Bay with the theodolite, and were it not for the ertremely small angle of intersection, which throws some doubt on tho 11osition, I should be tolerably well satisfied with the resulting height. The impression made ou our minds from viewing this mountain from a multitude of positions was that ·it is slightly higher than 1\fount Fairweather. I think it probable that when better observations are practicable it may be found a few hundred feet lower than our theodolite-determination. Mount Fairweather was m.easured from I..ituya Ilay by theodolite and from Port !Iulgmye by vertical-circle observations of double-zenith distances; also, from a number of points close to Lituya Bay by sextant-angles .· The The The The mean mean mean mean of all the Lituya Ba,v observations is._ - . - - - - -.. - - - - - . - · - - . of all observations with sextant is - _. _. _ - .. - .. - - . - - - - - - - - of vertical-circle and theodolite obsenTations is. __ . _____ ... of all obsenations is. - - - - - .... - - .. - .. - . _- - - - .

. A.nd this result, I am convinced, is not far from the truth. The altitudes of Mounts Cook an(l Vancouver were determined b;y a series of double-zenith distances, observed at the Port Mulgraye astrouomimil station, and the resulting heights are regarded by me as approximate only, becaus<) of the doubt resting on the precision of the compassbearings, by which, partly, their positions were determined. Mount Saint Elias was measured by a particularly large series of double-zenith distanceR from Port Mulgrave, and also by a large nnmbm· of sextant·obsernttions from various localities. Part of the latter have been computed for the sake of 1>howi1ig that all the observations point to a greater height than bas been previously claimed for the mountain. I give them no weight in the result, as they were all t:tkeu at great distances from the peak, and subject to various disturbing influences and uncertaiuty in most of the positions. It has occurred to.me, in view of the unanimity in the Litnya Bay observations, that we might apply the difference between the height of Mount l·'airweatber, as there obtained, and that obtained from Port Mnlgrave, in the ratio of the square of tlrn distaJJces, as a correction for the undetermined error of the refraction in the case of Mount SaL1t. Elias. · All the Port Mu1grave obsernttions were tak<'n about the i;:ame time, at the same place, with the same instrument, and subject to the same iniluences. As the mean of' the Htuya observations on Fairweather is greater than the result of the Port ~lulgrave ohser.vations, the correction for Mount Saint Elias would be additive. The ratio being 147,907.242 : 111,212.P : : 192 : 108.5, which is the resulting correction for Saint Elias, 192 feet being the difference between the two series on Mount Fairweather. The height. of Saint. Elias, as obtained at Port J\1ulgrav~, being 19,464 feet, when corrected it would be 19,572 feet. Unfortunately, Port Mulgrave is so completely encircled by land as to have rendered it impossible tO obtain a back sight at the opposite sea-horizon, which would have gh'en us au approximation to the true refraction. In the following compctations, 0.08 has been taken as the cot!fficient, which is nearly tbe average found in the ordm nee survey of Great Britain, with a not very dissimilar latitude and climate. Tile observationti of all kinds have been computed by Ooast Survey methods. The heights have been compute!l by a special formula supplied by Assistant C. A. Schott, chief of the computing uiyision. The formul11s for the computation of distances are from Appendix

(IE09), having partofthedA.tn nsed by Malaspina, hae come to band since this memoir was first published, and enabled us to recompute on bis b"8is th<' height of Mount St. Elias. Thoni:h working; with approximat.e formulre and the imperfoot instruments of the time, be appears to ba.vo been well qualified for his task.

We do not know .exactly where his a.atr-onomical station W&8 situated. Hjs results ,~ould point to a. position somewhat north amd fut of the United State8 Cua.et Survey station, but in any case the: distance between either- .his or- our own aetrouomieal station and the moanta.in would be Dea.rJy the &&me.

APPENDIX No. 11.
REPORT CONCERNING RECENT OBSERVATIONS AT SOUTH PASS BAR, MISSISSIPPI RIVER, DY HENRY MITCHELL, ASSISTANT IN THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY. BOSTON, j}farch 10, 1875. The original programme for this work contemplated the determination of transverse and vertical curves of velocity, from point; to point, along the course of each pass and out o\·er the ban; to the sea. These observations were to be, as far as practicable, simultaneous from section to section, and were to be repe1tted at dilferent periods of the tide. Among other questions we hoped to answer by this course of inquiry were the following: l11t. In what maimer does the outflowing stream expand as it approaches the sea, and how is this expansion related t.o depth and velocity~ 2tl. How does the meeting of fresh and sea water densities affect the channel depth, or how are these related'¥ 3d. Is there any indication of a littoral current beyond the bar~ The observations at the mouth of the South Pass have been made somewhat in accord with the pre-arranged plan, and appear to have been made under favorable coudltions; but they are few in number, so that our conclusions are by no means fi.nal. Mr. Marindin, the assistant of the Ooast Survey having immediate charge of the party, and Mr. Weir, his principal observer, as well as several other members of the party, were familiar with our methods, having had long pre\-ions experience elsewhere. I, therefore, have full confidence in the work done, although I left the locality before the party were fully engaged. I shall refer to the statistics of the work hereaftr in some detail. § 1. ExrANSION.-As the stream approaches the sea after passing the contraction in the neighborhood of the South Pass light-house, it expanrls at the expense both of its depth and velocity. The banks, on both sides below the light-house, are covered with thick growth of reeds wl!icll extend much further seaward upon the right than upon the left shore. If we view the scene at high water, we find the right bank exposed to \"iew for a distance of 9,430 feet below the light-house, while the left bank is visible only to a distance of 1,987 feet below a point opposite the light-house. But at extreme low water the flats are exposed quite out to the bar and the two banks are seen to be essentially of the s811kle length. At the time of our observations the low banks above referred to were mostly submerged and there seems to have been some escape of the water O\er them. In a distance of 8,000 feet below the light-house the river increases its superficial width five fold, i. e., from 712 feet at section A (see sketch No. 24)to 3,400 feet at section B. Section.A. represeuts the pass just within its visible mouth, and section B the outlet·chaunel just within the crest of the bar. 'Ihe area& of these sections show an increase of 36 per cent., i. from 18,270 square feet at A to 24,600 square feet at B. The mean depth has diminished from 24.44 feet at A to 8.03 feet at B, or in much less ratio than the width bas increased. As the velocity (mean) should vary lu-versely as the section, and as the depth (ri>presenting scour) should vary as the squares of the velocity, we shoultl expect, under ordinary circumstanct>s, that the depths should be inversely as the squares of the sections. Bat from the figures above you wil1 observe that the depths from section A to section B vary as 3 is to 1, while the squares of the sections vary as 2 is to 1. We might argue from thiR that some lifting force has been at workthe denser water of the sea, for instance-and thus discover in our results a confirmation of the statement upon page 445 of the Phy-sic.sand llydrau1ics of the Mississippi Wver, that" this lifting force of the salt-water must widen the river-current.." But from the best reductions we can mako of the velocities in the two sections which were not occupied by current·statious simultaneousls, except for the axis of the stream, the mean velocities were l.3U feet per second against O.GG, gi dug for the ratios of their squares ~Hw to 1, which is not widely di!fereut from the ratio of mt·au tle):lths.

e.,

REPORT OP THE SUPERINTENDENT 01<'

.Again, if we compare tlrn vertical curves of velocity siinulta.neously obseryed in the thread of the stream for both sections, we find the axial scour at (1. 71 )2 : ( 1.09)2 = 2.4(i : 1, and the channel-depths to which they correspond 29: 11.5 = 2.52 : 1, from which I think we must conclude that as far as our evidence may cover the case, the depths vary with the squares of the velocity, leaving no room for the interference of any other element. .And our curves of specific gravity taken at the same time indicate only a slight intrusion of sea-watec- at the seaward section B. ·when it is considered that our observations were made at the low stage of the river, it will be admitted that for the permanent order of things our sections must be regarded as those of fresh-water conduits, and since the levels alter but little, from low stages to flood, we may conclude that the axial velocities will preserve much the same ratios. Thus far 1 am inclined to regard the expansion of the stream as primary antl the loss of depth dependent. This granted, the incc-ease of sectional area is seen to be a necessity growing out of the iucrease of wetted perimeter, wllich reduces the ·rnlocity by friction. At other periods of the tide than that at which we observed the sections, brackish water was found higher up the stream, but to no great extent. § 2. I submit that the exclusion of the sea-water from the South Pass at the time of our obserYations was due mainly to the presence of the bar as an antecedeut obstruction. The velocity of the outflow at the light-honse corresponded to a fall in space of 0.03 foot, and the ele,-ation of the actual ri\·er surface abo'°'e the sea could not have been measured, probably, because so small. The d;y11a11]ic pressure due t-0 the impulse of the issuing stream cannot exceed t.wiec the weight of the Jiead dne to velocity; so that a stratum of sea-water having a thickness of 7 feet (the depth ou the crest of the bar) would by its greater specific weight have very much o\-erba"lanced tlrn river as Pt flowed through the light-house section. One may easily see that if at the time of our observations the bar had been taken away, the sea-water would have poured in along the bed of the pass with a n·locity near the bottom very much greater than that; of the surface outflow observed. We must couclude, then, it seems to me, that the bar had been bullt by floods when the river was issuing at a l1igher wlocity aud at a higher sutface elevation, so that it overmastered the sea, aucl that the oflice which the bar filled in the low-river season, when we made our observations, was that of a l.mlwark holding back the sea. We may expect that so long as the proposed jetties serve to dissipate the bar there will be an influx of the sea during the low-river season, and some tendency to fill np the pass, but the mate 1·iul brought in must be small; and since the surface fresh-water velocity must be increased at some stages of the tide, and will be scarcely diminished at any other stages, deposits of much sediment need not be anticipated. I call your attention to the vertical curves of specific weights given irl, our table and sketch, aud also to tl.ie diagram (sketch 24) sl10wing a "section of South Pass along the chanuel-wa,r." Our ol>:,;ervations made shortly after low tide probably give the minimum of sea-water for the day. § 3 . .At the same time that the transverse curve of vefocities was being determined at section B, another trans\·erse curve was being determined just outside the bar. Tilis outer curve depends upon three stations, and unfortunately the maximum velocity falls upon the most western instead of upon the central station (as was designed); in other words, our curve is too far to the eastward, so that its apex does not fall iu the middle, leaving some doubt whether the position of the thread of the stream was reached. Nevertheless, for the purposes in view these three stations are highly important, since they reveal the presence of a current in excess of the discharge from the South Pass. Assuming that the section in motion is limited by our extreme stations-which, of course, it is not-we find the passing Yolnme nearly 107,596 cuhic feet per second, or over four times the discharge given by our corrected curve at section A, off the light-house in the South Pass, and over five times the volume passing ovtir the bar as given by the simultaneous observations at sect.ion B. At this outermost section the depth is not only greater in the arnrage from side to side thau at the sections above, but the iwt·.rage velocity from Rurface to bottom is some 30 per cent. greater than at the light1.Joul:le section, aud the maximum velocity of the 6-feet-surface stratum is double that found at the i;ection just withiu tl.Je \Jar. l\loreover, a change in the direct,ion of the current is observed

deflecting to the westward; so that no doubt exists in our minds that at the time of our olJsen-ations there was a strong littoral current, or race of the sea, along the outer slope of the, South Pm;H bar. In our sketch, (No. 24,) wlJich accompanies this rep()rt, we llan~ not gi\'Cll the" outer" curve of velocities above rnentionetl, becau;;;e it was incomplete, as we ha·e stateu, and because it was not transverse-the currents beiuJ:!: deflected from tlJeir anticipated conr;;;e. The weather at the time of these observations was quiet; the wind, being light from north and northeast, could not ham had any measurable influence, but for several days previous the weather bad been windy, and considerable sea was running on tlie day of the obsen·ations. The water issuetl from the South Pass in a southeasterly direction, hut after crossing the bar was turned to the southward and southwestward. At one of the outside stations occupied on the same day but at a different honr from those which formed our curve, tbc observer, ~fr. "~eir, made a special note in his record to the effect that the submerged floats moved to the westward, while the line upon the surface was carried southward. Whether this mO""rnment along tbe outer slope of the bar is a race of the sea or a littoral current, we have not enough data to determine; suffice it to say, we fouu<l it steady at the depth of 2± feet, and have no adequate reason for supposing that it was the result of anomalous or unusual circumstances. South Pass bar is not salient to the general sweep of the delta fro.utage. I called attention last year to the fact that a circle could be drawn which would pass through four of the bars, Yiz: Southwest Pass, South Pass, Southeast Pass, and Pass <t Loutre, and fall oul.r 2,300 feet within a fifth bar-that of Northeast Pass. This circle ltas a radius of 21~ statute miles, and its center lies about 2-!r miles to the southward of the Jump, in htitude 2!)0 1±' 20", longitude soo 2(1115", and 8! miles above the heacl of the passes, as found upon the printed cbart of the Coast. Snney. Ne-vertheless, the South Pass bar lies nearer to those deep contours of the Gulf, which seem not yet to have been reached by the aproning of the delta, than any of the others, and rnusl> therefore be regarded as the salient zJoint of the delta as regards the Gulf and its movemeuts. This is among the reasons why the experiment of jetties at this pass seems to me more likely to be 1mccessful than at the others, and within a reasonable cost. Tbe new deposits, after the jetties are built, are likely to be swept away to some extent by the coast-current and tlte race of tbe sea. It does not compare favorably with tl.Je two other passes in width, depth, and previous good character, as regards freedom from obstructions. Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 12.
DISCUSSION OF TIDES IN NEW YORK HARBOR.
UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, June 30, 1875. DEAR SIR: I have the honor· to submit the followiug report of the dhicussion of the tidal
observations of Go,-ernor's Island in New York Harbor. 1. The observations used embrace a snies of 1!) years, from 1856 to 1874, inclusive. There are some interruptions in the continnit.v of the series, especially in the first part of it, arisi11g frnm the freezing-up of the tide-gauge and from storms; hut these are mostly of sliort duration, and do not Rerionsl_y impair the value of the ohRervatio11s, or affect sensibly the accuracy of the results deduced from them. In this diRcussion, the first rednetions of the observations made by the Coast Snrvf'y were furnished to me for the purpose. These comprise the times and heights of the high an1l low waters of the ti(fo, together with th<· apparent times of tbe moou'l:l weridiau transit immed 7ately precedi11_!! the times of high water, and the corresponding ltrnitidal intervals.
THE GENERAL PLAN AND IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF THE DISCUSSION.

2. The geut>ral plan adopted in this discnssion is the same as that of the discussion of the tidal ol>servations of Boston Harbor, the deviations being merely in some of tlie details. This plan is found to work well aud give very accurate resnlts. It is not claimed, however, that, by methods inYoldng a mnch greater amount of labor, a slight improvement in the accuracy of the reRults might not have been obtained. By the method used, the probable error in the mean amplitude of the tide, or in the co-efficient of any of its inequitlit.ie,., depending upon abnormal disturbances, errors of observations, and imperfect.ions in the methods uf reductions and of the discussion, i8 not more thau one-twentieth of an inch, and, in the Calle of the luuitidal interval, not more ti.Jan one-quarter of a winute. Of course, nrors of these ord1~rs are of no cousequenee in any practical applications of the re!\ults; and even in the 11iue8t comparisons between theoretical relations and those de1lucecl in the discussion of the observations, these errors are so much smitller than those of auy tidal theory "hieh we 111,w have, or can ever hope to havt·, that it wouhl hardly seem to be worth while to expend a great amount of additional lal1ur in order t-0 diminish very slightly these small probable errorR. 3. The imme<liate object of the discussion of the obsen·atious is the determination of the mean amplitude and lunitidal interval of tile tide, an1l tbe co-efficients and epochs of their principal ineq1ialities, and the first step in the plan a·loi)tell cousists in grouping all the observations of the luuitidal intervals autl of the heights of high and low waters wit.It refereuce to the argume11ts of the inequalities taken two and two, so tuat each grnup shall give the averages of the obt>ervations within certain small ranges of eaeh one of these twu arguments; as, for instance, the twenty-fourth part. of tlle arguments correspo11<ling to the periods of the i11t>qualities. Frow these averages, the effects of all abnormal disturbances of the winds aud of barometric press11re, aud also tbe other no¥· 1nal ineq nalities, arl~ very nearly eli miuatecl, siuce in both the Illus and mi11 ns effects must, very nearly counteract each other, and we have sirn1>ly the 1wer1J.ges as atfectt>d lor the rnost part b)· the two inequalities merely sought to be determined. The an·rages of tlwr1e groups being entert>d into t:ables with double arguments, antl being summed each way, we get other aYerages, affected by only one of tbe inequalities. This method shortens ,·ery much the amount of' work, since the observations can be ~Touped with retereuce t-0 two argument,; in very nearly tho same titue that they could

with reference to one simply; and thus, when we have obtained the averages as aff~cted by onl' inequality, it requires but little additional labor to sum the averages of the groups, and obtain average8 affected onl,\· by the other inequality; and we thus 8a\·e the tmuble of grouping all the observations again witli referenct> to tbe argument of the second ineqnalit~·. When the avenq~t·s have been obtained, affected ouly by the inequalities haYing the ,;ame argument, b_y comparing these avt>rnges with t,heir knowu form of expression, we mm 111ake ont as mans equations of condi. tion as we han· avPrages, for determining the unknown amplitudes and epochs of the ine1prnliti<>s, as will be explained as we proceed.
ADOPTED NOTATIONS.

·i. The notation of the arguments adopted in this di:;i.cnssiou is the same as tha.t nse1l in the dcYelopmeut of the tidal force:s in § 19 of Tidal Researches, published as a11 appPrnlix to the Coast Survey Report for 1874; and that of the l1rnititlal i11ten·als and heights of high and low water is the same as that a1lopted i11 various parts of those Reserl.rckes. The uotatiou i:s as follows:-

9 1 =the angular di11tance betweeu the moon a.nd sun, expressed either in are or iu time, being, in tl1e latter case, ·lenotell U_\' the a,p[Jareut time of the moo11's meridian transit; '1'2 =the moon's mean anomaly; '/'3 = 2 1", in which i. is the moon's longitude; 'f· =the longitude of the mooi,'s ascenrling uodc; 'fs = the sun's true anomaly ; <p7 = the sun's true longitude; 'fll = 2 'fl; \012 = 2 '1'2· The other argumentR not given here helong to ver_y small inequalities, wl1ich we 11a.vr not attempted to determine in this c\iscnRsiou, and which consequently we have had no occasion to use. We also put=the height of the first high water after the moon's upper tranRit, anti the correRponding lunitidal iuterval, resvectively; H2, 1. 2 = rlle same for the following low water; H 3, A 3 =the beigllt of the high water 1wxt followiug the moon's lower trausit, aud the correspouding lunitidal iutR,rval; H4, i. 4 =the same for the following low water.

6. The observations were first grouped with refPrence to the arguments ~ 1 and ~2, each group comprising obser,,.ationR belonging to onf' of 24 equal cUvisionR of each argument. The divisions of 'Pl! ex:presAed in tirnf'S of transit, were from Oh om to Oh aom, from Oh 3(Jm to lh om, &c., so as to make the averages correspond to the values of Oh rnm, Oh 45"', &c., or very nearly. The divisions of <p2 wer.e Emch as to make the middlt' of the divisions correspond to J5o, 300, &c.; and it was assumed that these medium values of the argume11t-B in the case of so many observations would correspond so noorly with the actual average values that they could be adopted instead of the latter without any toensible error. It should be remarked that the values of ~h used in the discussion, were thoSA of the moon's tra11"1it over the meridian of Washington, instead of the ' meridian of the port, as is usual; and consequently the values belong to that time, and not to the time of high or low wat-ers, and that a correction must be iutrodu(,>ed into the epochs of the results on this a.coonut, where the argument is taken for the time of transit over any other meridian, or

for the time of high or low water. The ntlues of <p 2 nsed were those corresponding to the times of high water. B_y summing the averages of the groups in two ways, so as, first, to eliminate the inequalities depending upon <p 2 , and, isecomll.r, so as to elimivate tbe iue<iuality depending upon \"i, the aver. age values co11tained in Tables I and II, belo11gil1g to the correi<pouding values of the arguments, were obtained. 7. ln the secornJ place, the observations of each year were grouped witl1 reference to the moon's longitude, with a view of determining tbe inequalities in the semi-diurnal tide depending upon the moon's longitude, and a!i;o the amplitude of the diumal tide, which likewise depends upon the moon's longitude. The ouservations of each Jl'ar were grouped separately, in order to determine the int>quality in the semi-diurnal tide depending upon v 4 , t.he longitude of the moon's asceu!ling node. TLe value of '/'~ belongiug to the middle of the year was take11 as the value for the groups embraciug each year. 'l'be value of the moon's lnug·itude, i., in Tablei,; IH and IV, are tltose belonging to the transit C over the Washi11gto11 meridiau, according to Lul.Jbock's notation; that is, to the fourth transit, preCding the time of higlt water. Tliis arrangement was adopted i:;o that the arguments of longitude which bad bef'n u8ed in the discussioti of the tidal 01Jservatio11s of Boston HarlJor, in wbicb the Junitidal i11terval8 were referred to trausit O, could I.le also used in this di8cust:1ion. All that will be necessar.Y to correct for this will b<> to introduce a correi;ponding change in the epochs of the angles in the final results obtained. In ordt>r to obtain the amµlitude of tue diurnal tide, it was necessary to keep the obi:;en·ations of upper and lower transits separate in this Cflse. By first summiug and taking the aYerage of the groups lielonging to each of the years for each value of;., the averages in Tables Ill and IV were obtained; and by summing a11d taking the an'rage of all the observations belonging to each ;rear, the results of Table V were obtained. 8. The results in Table VI are the averages of all the observations for the whole series belo11gi11g to each month; the values of ~ 6 and <p 7 , being those belonging to the middle of each month. These results are to be used in determining the inequalities depending upon the sun's longitude and true anomaly.
SEMI-DIURNAL '.l'IDE.

9. We sha·ll now determine from tlm preceding tabular results, t11e unknown co-efficients and epochs in t,he theoretical tidal exprPssions of tbe amplitucie and lunitidal interval of tl1e semi· diurnal tide, and show with what degree of accuracy these expressions, with the unknown cou. stants thus determined, rei>re!:'ent the obsen·ations. These expressions are (Tidal Researches (97)
and (9Y) : -

Az =Ao::, R, cos (tp, - a,) { L; = B, sin (tp, - s,) in which A 2 is the amplitude of the tide aud L; the ltmitidal interval, the subscript 2 in the gen· eral t'xpression common to all the several oscillations being the characteristic of the semi-diurnal tide; also Ao is the amplitude of' tbe mean tide, and R, is the ratio betweeu the coefficients of the iuequalities of A 2 and tbe mean amplitude. The expression is put in tbis form for the imrpose of comparing these ratios in the tidal expression with the correspondi11g ratios in the fo.rces denoted by P,. the values of which are gi\'en in Tidal Researches. § l\}. 10. Half.monthly inequality.-Iu the a\'erages of Table I, the eficct of the diumal tide is eliminated, and the eftect of the ter-diarnal deep-wate,r tide is always extremely :;mall. The mean Yalne, therefore, of (J.'2 - .l.') in Table I, if the results were not affected by a qnarteNliurnal and other tidel'I of shorter period, arising from tlle shallowness of the water, ancl therefore called shallow-water tides, would be exactly the fourth part of a rupan lunar day, wliich is 6h rnru.6; and t.be inequalit.r in these values depending upon the values of Sl'i would be Yery small. It is seen, however, that the mean in the table dillt>rs from the fourth of a lurwr da,Y about 10 minutes, and that this ditlereuce for 11Hl"N·ent values of the argument <p 1 is very differeut. In 1leep-water tides altso the value of Bo, which is the mean sea-level as determined from the means of ti.le heights of high and low w~ter, would be constant since there is no half-mouthly iriequality iu this mean height in such tides. 'Ve see, however, from the oolumn headed oHo that this is not the case. The tides of New York Harbor are therefore affected by large shallow-water components, so that the usual

formnhe, based upon the theory of deep-water tides, cannot hA userl in determining, from the results of Table I, the semi-diurnal tide and its half-mouth!~- inequalit.v without incurring some risk of having the results slightly affected b~· these shallow-water compouents. The mean diflerence of nearly 20 minutes between the intervals from high to low and from low to high waters is caused mostly hy the supposition of a quarter-diurnal upon the semi-diurnal tide, which, it is readily conceh·ed, must cause a diff'ereuce iu these intervals, unles;; the epochs of the semi-diurnal and quarter-diurnal tides are such as to make one of the high waters of the quarter-diurnal tide coincide with a high water of the semi-diurnal tide, in which case tlie. intervals from high to low and from low to high waters would he exactly eqnal. This is the case in the tides of Boston Harbor, although there are indications of a small quarter-diurnal tide, as shown l>y a small differem;e in the mean level of the sea at the times of the syzygies and quadratures as determined from the averages of the heights of hig·h and low water. It is seen (Tidal Researches, 360) that there are six of tbt>se shallow-water components, thrMof which are lunar, solar, oi- lnnisolar quarter-diurnal tides, and one mie-sixtk diurnal, which have periods which are commeusurable with the period of the half-monthly inequality; and hence they cause not only the mean difference between the iuten·als from high to low aud from low to high waters, but also a half-montbl.Y inequality iu these diffe1·euces. 11. Wit.h the observations of the times and heights merely of the resultant of a-ll the sballowwater terms combined with the diurnal and semi-diurnal tides, it is impossible to so analyze these tides as to determine the amplitudes and epochs of each one, aud thus to dP.termine the effects of tile shallow-water tides upon the values of A, and L 2 iu Table I, from which we deduce the amplitude and lunitiual interval of the semi-diurnal tide and their half-monthly inequality. If the heights of higb and low water were observed exactls at the interval of one-fourth of a lunar da)·, the effect of the quarter-diurnal tide upou A 2 in Table I would be elimiuated, but it would still affect the value of H 6 , but where a high water of the quarter-diurnal tide does not, coincide with a high water of the semi-diurnal tide, these intervals, we have seen, are not exactly one-fourth of a lunar day, and hence the differnnce between H' 1 and H 12 , \Vhich is the value of A2, may be slightly affected from this cause. Tb.e best we can do, however, in this discussion i>1 to neglect the considera.tion of these effects, which we have reasou to think are very small. We here see, however, the importance, at least in shallow-water tides, of using the harmonic aualysis in the discussion of ti<lal observations, by means of which all these small compo11entt1 cau be detcl'tnined from the observations. 12. \Ve have (Tidal Researches, 333), for the exµressions of A 2 in (l),-

A2=! (H1-Il2

+ 93-H{)=~ (lI'1-H'2)

In this expreRSion, 11owever, the values of H 1, H 2 , &c., being functions varying with the time, must be taken for the same time; hut the values of H' 17 in Table I, a.re for high water, and of H 12 for low water; but, instead of reducing them to the same time, we can take the \'alue of A. 2 , givt>n by the expression above, as belouging to the intermediate time half-way from high to low water, tlle corresponding lunitidal interval of which is L2 = ~ (i.' A12 ), given in the ta.hie. The values of .A 2 and L_,, in the table, then, ca.u be regarded as tlae averages of the amplitudes of the tide at this intermediate time, ~nd Li, those of the corresponding lunitidal iuten-als. Where the averages are for short inten·als of the arguments, these averages can be taken as the true value of the functions belonging to the mean values of the arguments without sensible error; but where the intervals are large, a <',orrect.iou is required. If the values of .A.2 , in Table I, could be taken as the corrt~ct values belonging to tlrn corresponding average values of ~ 1 , we should have, from the first of ( 1),-

In these last expressions, '!',and <p 11 are the values of the argument at the two limits uf the group of observations, and the space between these limits may be of any extent whatever. The angle 2 sci = 'f11, in the notation of § 5, being a multiple of l"i, the inequality corresponding to it has not been eliminated from the averages of Ta,ble I, awl hence this term must be retained. It would likewise be necessary to include, in the expression, terms having the angles 31" 1 , 4 Soi, &c., if there were any sensible terms having such arguments. But we know from theoretical considerations, as well as from an inspection of the residuals where the results belonging to the expression where only two terms are retained are compared with observation, that all terms beyond the second in the expression are insensible. Of course, sensible co-efficients are brought out in the discm1sion where such terms are retained; but these are merely of the order of the probable errors of the averages used, and do not indicate real- terms. If we had 24 average ·values of A 2 , and should retain so may terms in tue expression of (2) that the number of co-efficients and epochs in the expression should amount to the same, we should probably get sensible co-efficients for every term; but, instead of this expression being more correct, it would be less RO than where fewer terms are retained, for it would evidently be an expression wllich would represent all the errors of observation. A too great attempt at refinement, therefore, in this direction, only leads to error. 13. The preceding expression of A. 2 may be put into the form(4)

Mean lunar deelinational inequality.-In the averages of Table IV, the diurnal tide and all the inequalities of the semi-diurnal tide, including the inequality detlending upon the moon's node, are eliminated, except that depending upon the moon's longitude, A..

To the terms, therefore, in the general expre3sions of ( l) depending upon the moon's- longitude, the principal term of which has the argument '(1 1 = 2 ..l., we must also add a term of which the argument is .i., to represent the term depending upon the fourth power of the moon'" clistauce.

If we· compare these residuals with those of all the preceding cases, we find that, while an the others are nearly of the same order, these are about three tim~s larger. By comparing also the values of Lz in Table V with thosf1 of the other tables, it is found that the former are much more irregular. These irregularities must be caused by errors in the time used, which causes the averages of the different years to be several minutes in error fo some cases. A part may also be due to personal errors in making the reductions, wbich were probably made by different persons in different years. All such errors would be eliminated mostly from the averages iu all the other tables, and would show themselves only in the yearly averages. By applying Peirce's criterion to the residuals, it is found that it rejects two of the yearly averages, regarded as one observation; and, from the remaining 17, we then get, instead of the above values,-

There is no sensible correction of the epochs in this, as in the former cases, on account of the very slow rate of change of the angle 50, in this case. 19. Solar declinati-Onal and parallactic inequalities.-The an~rages of Table YI contain two inequalities; the one depending upon the sun's anomaly, and the other upon its longitude, or declination.

20. Mean sea-level.-The average.of high and low waters, denoted by H 01 in the tables of averages, are not the heights of the true mean sea-level, as bas been stated, when the tides are affected by shallow-water terms. Theory does not give any half-monthly inequality in the height of mean sea-le\'el in det:p-water tides; and aJJ the other inequal;ties, depending upon parallax and <fficlination, are so extremely small that it is impossible to deduce them from the preceding tables Of averages which are afteQted by large shallow-water terms. There is a theoretical shallow-water component, with a half-monthly period, which would affect the mean level, and this may, in some cases, be sensible; hnt the column in Table I headed ~ H 0 does not represent this inequality, but is the effect mostly of the quarter-diurnal components which are not eliminated in the averages of high and low water. The column headed H 0 in Table V shows that there was a change of more than three feet in the zero-plane of the tide-gauge between the beginning and the end of the series. An abrupt change of about 1.1 feet seems to have been made abollt the middle of the year 1861, and another of nearly two feet some time during the year 1871. On account ot' these changes, we cannot determine whether there has been any secular change of sea-level during the time of the series of observations.
DIURNAL TIDE.

21. The diurnai title can be determined from the averages of Table IV, which are given separately for each of the high and low waters of a lunar day. If there we.re no ter.diurnal tide, or quarter-diurnal and other shallow.water components, we sbonld have, for the mean values at the bottom of that table, 11 = ;.a, ).2 = 14, Hi = H3, and Hz = H4. In obtaining the values, there· fore, of Ii ().1 - ..l3), t (A2 - A4), ~ (Hi - H3), and i (Hz - H4), due to the eft'ects of the diurnal tide alone, we can correct in a great measure for the effects of all the other components of short period by subtracting from each of these differences the differences of the means at the bottom. For instance, we must diminish each of the 24 values of (J-1 - A 3) by - 4m,O; and so of the others. Since, moreover, the averages belonging to low waters belong to a time equal to six lunar hours later than those of high waters, and it is uecessary, in determining the amplitude of the diurnal tide, to have these quantities for the same absolute time, we have applied a small eorreetion by means of proportional parts of the differences to those of the low waters, in order to reduce them to the times of high waters. WiLh the preceding corrections or reductions applied to the dift:erenees or Ttlble "IV, we obtain those of Table VIL

ences, a very small systematic difference is observable between the observed and computed values, which was to be expected, since the correctiont:i for the shallow-water components wei·e necessarily only partial and imcomplete. 22. The nllues of 11f1 in the preceding tal>le give au extraordinary result, which has never been brought out before in the discussion of the observations of any tidal station. The lunar diurnal tille has always been snpposetl to vanish at or near the time of the moou's crossing the equator; but the result obtained I.Jere shows that, in New York Harbor, the diurnal tide never vanishes, but that there is a minimum diurnal tide, with an amplitude of about two inches, near the time of the moon's cros»ing the equator, while the amplitutle of the maximum tide near tlie time of greatest declination is less than six inches. The theoretical explanation of this ·will be given farther on. If, in Table VII, we putJlit

=Ao+ Ai sin (2 A. - a,j

+ Az sin (4 J. -

a 2)

and determine, by methods heretofore adopted, the most probable values of the constants, we getAo= .306 ft.

A1

= .141 ft.

Az = .018 ft.

With these values, the preceding expression represents the observed values of Al, in Table VI, with a mean residual of .011 foot and a maxitnum one of .030 foot. This is the usnal order of the residuals, depending upon the uneliminate<l irregularities of the observations; and both the sm;i.llness of tlie residnah1 and the small value of A 2 show that the above expression represents very accurately the true values of M,. Since the ''alues of l in Table VII belong to the transit C over the Washington meridian, which is 451.i 42w before the time of high water next following the moon's upper transit, to which time the values of Jlf1 belong, the preceding epochs must be increasetl by the amount by which the angles change in that time: which, for 2 A, is 500.2, and, for 4 J., twice that amount. With the pre· ceding values of the constants, and tltese corrections in the epochs, the preceding expression of M1 becomes, in feef,}f1

= .306 + .141 sin

(2;. - 710,8)

+ .018 sin (4;. -

1290)

This expression gives JI, = .429 foot for the maximum value, and M, = .147 foot for the minimum value. From the epochs in this expression of M" it is seen that the maximum of the diurnal tide occurs before the time of greatest declination, which is another nnusnal result in connection with this tide; for generally the maximum of the tide follows the time of the maximum of the force upon which it depends. The first and principal periodic term in the expression above is a maximum when A.= 80°.9; and hence, as J. changes l30.18 in a day, we have900 - 800,9 13°.18

= 0 690
·

for the time in the decimal of a day by which the maximum occurs before the greatest declination, that is, before the maximum of' the force; and the eff~t of the other small term does not change sensibly the time of maximum of the whole expression, since the epoch is such as to make it either a maximum or a minimum almost at the same time that the other is a maximum. From an inspection of the values of .d in Table VII, it is seen that the high, water of the diurnal tide at the time of maximum and near the time of greatest declination, occurs very neady at the time of high water of the semi-diurnal tide, but that near the time of the moon's crossing the equator, when this tide is a minimum, it occurs near the time of tile low water of this tide; and hence it bas a range of about six hours with regard t-0 the time of the moon's transit.

The expressions of' N 2 and A 2 , it is seen, are simllar in form, and R, expresses the ratios between the co-efficients in the inequalities of A 2 and the mean constant amplitude, .Ao, as P, expresses the corresponding ratios in the forces. The values of a, indicate the differences in the epochs of the angles of the inequalities in the fol'ces and those of' the corresponding tidal expressions. The values of R, and u., belonging to the principal inequalities in the preceding expression bave been obtained for New York Harbor, and it will now be int.cresting to compare them with the corresponding values in the forces; the values of P, being given below, and the epochs to wbich a, corresponds being 0. As the tidal observations of Boston Harbor aud of Brest ham also been discusse<l upon the same principle, and the values of R, and a, have likewise been determined for the principal inequalities, it will be interesting to have all in the same connection, for the sake of com· pal'isons with each other and with the corresponding quantities in the forces. We therefore gi\·e the following values of P 1, belonging to a mass of the moon equal to .012ti, with the corresponding values of R, and for New York, Boston, and Brest; those of New York being collected from the preceding pages, those of Boston being taken from the Coast Survey Report for 1868, aml those of Brest from Tidal Researches, p. 184.

The values of the epochs, of the principal inequalities beiug positive, indicate tbat the maxima of the inequalities occur after the corresponding maxima in the inequalities of the forces. By dividing the values of a, by the daily change of the corresponding angles, we get the amount of this delay in the times of the maxima of the inequalities in the tides, from which it is seeu that this is very different in the different inequalities of the tides of the same place, as well as very 1lifferent iu the same inequality for tides of d~fferent places. This amount of retardation, in the case of.the first and principal inequality, has been called the retard, and, by Dr. Whewell, the age of the tide, upon the hypothesis that our tides are derived from those of the Southern Ocean, and that this delay in the time of the maximum is simply the t.ime required for it to arrive as a free tidal wave to the ports of the North Atlantic. The great difference, however, in the retard of Boston and New York, now shown by the preceding results, entirely disproves this hypothesis. 24. The theoretical relation between R, and P, for deep-water tides, neglecting terms.of the third order, is (Tidal Researches, (97))-

This value of 11 we know is mnch too large, and its error is not due to errors of observation, but arises from the preceding conditions, which hold only for deep-wa.ter tides, not being applieable to the New York tides, which we have seen are aftected by large shallow-water components. The large value of F, also, which is obtained in some 11\aces; is due to the effect of the shallow-water components; for it has been shown in Tidal Researches that the effect of these components is to smooth down in.some measure all the inequalities, which effect is represented by Fin the preceding e:x:pression when it bas a negative value. In deep-water tides the valne of Fis, perhaps, insensible, and it is very small at Brest. The declination-inequality at New York Harbor, upon which the third of the preceding conditions is based, is very small, being little more than an inch; and the probable error(§ 17), as deduced from the observations, amounts to une thirts-fiftb part, and this would afl"ect the determination of the moon's mass in about the same ratio; so that the probable error in the preceding determination from this source is probably not vers large; and in ports where the declination·ineqnalit.y is six times as large, as it is at Brest, the error in the determination of the moon's mass, arising from ~rrors of observation, would be 1)roporti<>nally decreased, and hence would be q11ite small.

the whole weight of the determination iR thrown upon this inequality, anu it i1< little affected by small errors in the ,·alues of R 1 and R 1 obtained from ohsen·atiou. We have reason, therefore, to think tl1at tlie moon's masR would be accurately given by the preceding conditions, in the m.tHe of deep-water tides, having a large amplitude and eomiequeutly a large declination i1u>qnalit;q for the absolute amount of the probable error of this inequality as obtained from obst·n·ation does not depend much upon tl1e amplitude of the tide. The shallow-water components affecting the preceding conditions are so numerons, and their rela.tions to each other and to t,he components depending directly tipon the forces, with regard~ amplitude and epoch, ma_y be so different in different ports, that we do not know what their general tendency is; liut it seems to be to make the moon's mass too great genl.'rally, though they may no cloubt haYe the contrary effect sometimes. The preceding value of Eis large, as in the case of the Boston tides, and haR the same sign. The effect of this is to diminish the first and tb ird i neq uali ties, i11<lic~at.ed by the values of R 1 and R 3 , and to increase the lunar parallactic inequality, of whieh the ratio to the mean tide is R 2 · The value of Fis negative, as in the titles of Boston Harbor, but mncb less. The effect of thiN is to diminish all the inequa1iLies in the same ratio; but it does not diminish the parallactic inequality as much as it is increased by the term depending upon E, and the difference leaves the value of R 1 a little greater than P 2 · In the case of the first and third ineq nalities, the effects of the terms depending upon E and Fare both in the same dii·ection, and heuee R 1 anll R 3 are very mueh less than P1 and P 3 · The ,-alue of F, as 11as been stated, dependR most!~-, if not entirely, upon the efft>ct of the shallow-water terms, and represents in the preceding expression of R; only approximately the effect of those terms; and hence the preceding conditions, from the theory of !leep-water titles, in the case of the New York tides, affected by shallow-water components, are best satisfied with a mass ot' the moon which is too large. The value of F, obtained from the first three of the preceding eq nations, substituted in the l:tst one, gives R 4 = - .0300 instead of - .03!3, as obtained from observation. Tile difference corre· sponding to .0043 A0 in the absolute co-efficient of the iueqnalit~', being about only one-eighth of an inch, ma_}' be regarded as falling within the limits of the possible errors of observation. 25. The values of tbe epochs, a., being positin· in the first tl.tree principal inequalities indicates ti.mt the maximum of the ticle follows some time after the maximum of the forces. The daily rate of increase of the angles cp, being respectively 2!0 .38, 13°.18, 0260.:w, by dividing the prececliug values of a 1 , "2· and a 3 by these qnantities, we get, respectively, 1.922, 1.45, and 0.61 da.ys for the times that the maximum of the several inequalities in the tides follows that of the forces. These times ditler very much among themselves, and are all much smaller than in the case of the tides of Boston Harbor, in which, on the average, they amount to about two days. By the equiliorium-theoQ·, these times should vanish, and by the theory of deep-water tides, neglecting quantities of a third order, which must be generally very small, tliese times should be the same for all the inequalities. Thc·se CLlochs, then, as well as the co-efficients of the inequalities, are no doubt much affected by the shallow-water components, and the large clifferences observed are not due alone to these neglected quantities ot a third order in the theory of deep-water tides. The Yalue of a~ should be sensibly o, on account of the very long period of the fourth inequality; aud the small value, - 4°.8, obtained from observation, falls within the limits of the possible errors of observation, for the epoch cannot be very accurately determined on account of the smallnesH of the inequality. · 26. In the case of the sixth and.seventh inequalities, the values of R 6 and R 7 dift'er but little from those of P 6 and P 7 , all being very sma11; but when we consider the epochs which iu these inequalities of long }leriod should by theory be sensihly o, we see that there is 110 correspondence between theory and observation; and this bas been found to be the case generally at aU tidal stations. The results obtained from observation have been supposed to be due in a great measure to meteorological causes connected with the different seasons; for, since the very small theoretical inequalities have a yearly and half-yearly inequality, the effects from meteorological causes would ~ot be eliminated from the results in the discussion of the ob~ervations; but still it is not very clear how tlte mere range of oscillation of the tides should be affected sensibly by the different seasons.

By referring to the column headed iJ H~ in Table VI, it is seen that the height of the mean level of the sea is greater during the summer than the winter. Tliis same annual inequalit~· in the heigllt

of the sea-level has been obtained in the case of the tides at Boston and at Brest, except that the maxima at the latter places seem to come later in the fall. A &imilar result has been also obtained iu the case of the tides at Key \Vest, Fla. Tbe obsen·etl anuual inequality in the atmospheric pressure accounts for only a >ery small part of this iueq uality of the lwight of sea-level ; but the balance is prolmbly caused by annual changes in the winds and in the ocean-currents, which hM·e an effect upon the mean sea-level. 27.

The value of Bi. which is tbe coefficient of the half-monthly inequality, is very nearly the same at New York as at Boston, but is very much less than the value at Brest, which is very nearly the value for European ports generally. By comparing the value of ai, given on a preceding page, with that of 121 above, it is seen that the former is little more than half as great as the latter.; and hence what has been called the age of the tides from the heights is much less tqau the age from the times, the former being, as has been fouuu, 0.922 day, and the latter may be readily found to be 1.48 days. A like difference is seen in the case of the tides at Uoston and Brest, but it is much less. We have the following theoretical relations, expressed in minutes, for the first three inequalities of ~(Tidal Researches, (132,) (133)), which should be satisfied by observation:B 1 cos (e1 - a1) = - 53.7 B2 cos (< 2 - a2) = B 3 cos (e 3 - aa) = - 2.2

With the preceding values of B., e., and a,, obtained from observation, and also the preceding values of E and oµ, obtained from the theoretical relations of the inequalities of the amplitudes of the tides, these equations arc satisfied with the residuals annexed. But these relations, based upon the theor.v of deep·water tides, as those in § 24, require too large a mass of the moon to satisfy them. From the values of B4 and e4 above, it is seen there a small inequality in the lunitidal interval, depending upon the moon's node, both at New York and Boston, and that the co-efficients and epochs of the inequality do not differ very greatly at the two places. There is no corresponding inequa1ity in the theoretical expression, unless it depends upon friction, which is as a greater 1>ower than tbe first power of the velocity; and, even upon this hypothesis, the epochs of the ob· served inequality, especially in the case of the New York tides, are not what t,heory would require. This int.>quality, therefore, which seems to be clearly brougb.t out from the observations both of New York and Boston, does not seem to be satisfactorily explained by thoory.

Prom the values of BG an(l <G, it is seen that there is a considerable annual inequality at both X ew York and Boston in the Junitidal interval; while, in the theoretical expression, the annual i11equal1ty is scarcely sensible, and the epochs do not at all correspond with those of observation. This i1n·q nality, therefore, as the corresponding one in the amplitude of the tides, must depentl in some way upon meteorological causes. The theoretical semi-annual inequality is also very small ; but for this, obsenation giYes likewise a \'ery small inequalit.y. The values of Bn at New York and Boston are small, wllile at Brest its .-alue is four times as large. This is merely an inequality of the second order, iuclnde<l under the same argument with that of the half-monthly inequality, and the values of B 1 and Bn show that the expression is much more convergent at New York and Boston than at Brest. 28. In the averages of Table III, the effect of the solar diurnal tide is eliininate(l, and the diurnal tide obtained belongs entirely to the moon. Neglecting the parallactic and nodal inequalities, which are also eliminated from the iwerages, the potential of the luuar force producing the diurnal tide may be rnsolve<l into two uarmonic components of the form K cos it and Ji. cos i' t, to which correspond tile tidal components (Tidal Re&eareltes, (164))A. cos (i t - ·) and A' cos (i' t - "')

In these expressions, the origin of t must be takeu so as to make u t = - i ,. when the moon's longitude,;,, equals O, or u t = 0 wlleu the moon has its greatest 11 ortheru declination, and u = .!i3U in terms of tbe radius, has sucli a value that the periotl of ii t is equal to tbe period of tbe moon's tropical revolution. The values of A.0, Lo, E, and 0 cau only be uetermined from observation. 29. By corn bining the preceding tidal components by means of the general formula (Tidal Jlesearcltes, (22) ), we get, by putting JJ! 1 for the resultiug arnplittule of the uiurnal tide,A cos (it - ·)+A' cos (i' t in which, since (it - ·) <:

The value of 1ll1 is a maximum when u t = u Gort= G, and a minimum when u t - u G =!JOO The maximum of the tide, therefore, occurs at a time t = G after the maximum of the forces. It has been fonud (§ 22) that the value.of G is negative in tbe New York tides, allll equal to O.Gtl of a day. From the preceding expression of M1 we get, for the maximum, 1111 = 2 A 0 , anti for the rniuimum, when 2 (u t - u G) equals :l:: 180°, ?11 1 = ::I: 2 u E A 0 · This occurs G da,ys after the moon has passed the equator, which, in this case, is before it has passed, since G is negati\'e. The di urn al tidl', therefore, never vanishes when circumstances are such as to give a value to E, which makes the term 2 u E Ao sensible. The general expression, therefore, A,, in Tidal Rese.arcltes, (Hi), when applied to the diurnal tide, is not strictly correct, since it neglects this quantity of a second order, and assumes that the tide vanishes when the moon is near the equator, as has always been i;mpposed. This term, howe\'er, must gene:ally be very small, if not entirely insensible, and it was so found to be in the case of the tides of Boston Harbor. Peculiar local circLUm;tances, howen~r, may be such as to give Ea very large.value at some stations, and this must be the case in New York Harbor.

30. It was found from observation (§ 22) that the maximum ·alue of the amplitnde of the lunar dinrual tide is M 1 = .'163 foot, aocl the minimum value is Af1 = .185 foot. IJence we have 2 Ao= .429 foot and ± 2 1t E Ao= .147 foot. These, with the value of u = .230, already given, give Ao= .214 foot and E = ::l:: 1.50, which is very much greater tbau the value of e in the semi-diurnal tide of New York Harbor; and this latter value is very much greater tbau the value belonging to Europeall ports generally. The preceding conditions do not determine the sign of E, and consequently they do not determine whether A or A' is the greater amplitude. This can only be determined by comparirig the epochs denoted by A in Table VII with those of the preceding expression, .il11 cos (it - " + E), the resultant of the two harmonic components of the lunar diurnal tide, to which the results of Table VII belong; the solar diurnal tide and the inequalities of parallax, &c., having been eliminated from the averages by tbe groupiug of the observations.

putting for ?t t its equivalent l - ~ 7'. In these expressions, the true longitudes nia.y be used instead of the mean without sensible error where the observations belong to true longitudes. The value of A given by this expression should agree with that in Table VII, given by observation. The value of L 0 in timP, which is the mean lunitidal interval of the semi·diurnal tide, bas been found to be Sh 7m,2. It is found by trial that the results given by this expression of A above cannot correspond with those of Table VII unless A> A' in the preceding expression of tan E, which miters into 4; and hence that the preceding valne obtained for E must be positirn. B.r putting L for the constant part of the expression of .:J, we have-

If vre now compute the vafups of Eby means of the preceding expression of tan E for each of the 24 values of A. gfren in Table VU, putting E 1.liO, and substitute them in the preceding expression of .J, a11d compare the results with the 24 values of .J in Table VII, we obtain 24 equations for determiniug the value of the unknown quantity L; and this being determined, each of the 24 values given by the precedin~ expression of A should agree with those in the table within the limits of the possible errors of obsenation. In this manner, we obtain L = 710,3, With this value of L, and the computed values of E for each of the 24 valnes of ). 1 we get the computed values of .:1 in Table VII. Tbe values of J. to be used in these computations are those of Table VII, corrected for the time from transit O, to which those in the table belong, to the time of l1igb water, which, as shown 1n § 22 1 is 2:3°.1. It must be remembered, also, that in tbe values of u t = ). - ~ w' this corrected value of J. of Table VII must be used in both the expr!"asions of M 1 and tan E preceding. With the value~= 1.50, before det~rmined, and the other known quantities in the prece<lingexpression of M1, we get, for the 24 values of " t = J. - ~ ,., tbe 24 computed values of A in Table VII. 31. By compariag the values of M1 and A in Table VII, computed from the preceding formula, witli those which had been obtained from. tile differences of tbe observed times and heights of upper and lower transits, the differenoos between these values of M1 and .4 are mOl'Jtly thoso only depending upon the nnelimioated errurs of observation. In the com11arisons of the two ~ts of values of ..d, a small systematic difi:erence is disc.ernible, with a maximum of about 20. This, no doubt, depends upon small errors in A, as determined from observations, resulting, as has been stated, from the effects of the shallow-water tides not having been completely corrected for; for

an error of 2° in the epoch of a tide, with an amplitude of only about three inches in tLe mean, implies an error only equivalent to about 0.1 inch in amplitude. The result completely verifies the truth of the preceding theory of this singular tide of New York Harbor, as well as the correctness of all the formulre used in the preceding development and explanation of it. With the preceding values of Ao and E, and the known value of u, we get, from the cxpres sions of A and A' (§ 28),A

= .214 ft. (1 + .230 x 1.5) = .288 ft. A'= .214 ft. (l - .2:-JO x 1.5) = .140 ft.

32. The value of E = 1.5, determined from thfl lunar diurnal tide, enables us to determine the solar diurnal tide, which bas not been deduced from the discussion of the observations. In the case of one harmonic component of the solar diurnal tide, the value of u is the same as in the lunar, and the two exactly coincide. The value of u for the other component, on account of the very slow motion of the sun in longitude, di1fors but little from it, and is .196 (Tidal ResearchcH, § 28). Denoting, therefore, tbe amplitudes of the two solar components by a and a', and putting the ratio between the lunar and solar forces equal 0.45, we shall havea

a'= .214 (1

= .214 (1 + .230 x + .194 x

1.5) x 0.45 = .130 ft. 1.5) x 0.4a = .124 ft.

" of the sun's greatest declination, we have a When the two components coincide at the times solar diurnal tide with an amplitu<le of a + a' = .25! ft., aml a~ the time, or very nearly, of the sun's crossing tile equator, a diurnal tide with an amplitude only of a - a'= .006 ft. The solar diurnal tide, therefore, sensibly vanishes when the sun is on t,hc equator.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS.

33. We have now, in the preceding tables of average quantities, and the constants determined from them in the preceding pages, all the necessary data for constructing tal:lles for the computation of a tidal ephemeris of the lleights of high aud h)w waters and the times of their occurrence. We shall give here, however, only tables for the high waters, since the heights and times of high water merely are given in the tidal ephemeris published by the Coast Survey. In constructi11g these tables, we shall neglect the most of the small inequalities of the second order, since these inequalities are always very small, and are e,;peclally so in New York Harbor, since the amplitude of the tide there is small, and these inequalities are proportional to the whole amplitude of the tide. Neglecting these numerous inequalities, and giving tables for high waters only, we shall be able to make the tables and the whole method of computing the tidal ephemeris very much more simple than that which has been given for th.e tides of Boston Harbor. In the latter cal'le, a method of computing the tidal ephemeris as accurate as possible was needed for making accurate comparisons between theory and observation. The following tables and method being designed merely for computing a tidal ephemeris for practical purposes, the neglect of the small inequalities referred to above, which, in the <Jase of New York Harbor, can rarely, in the aggregate, amount to more than one inch in the heights of the tides, or to more titan one or two minutes in the times, can be of no consequence, especially as the abnormal inequalities of winds and changes of barometric pressure, which cannot be taken into account in the predictions of the tides, frequently amount to ten times these neglected quantities. 34. The following tables are so arranged as to include in the same table the inequalities iu both the amplitude of the tide and the changes of mean level, and likewise the effects of the shallow-water terms, so far as they affect the heights and times of high water. Tiley also include all the inequalities of a second order depending upon the same argument. in the tables of single entry. The principal inequality of the second order iu the lunitidal interval depenrls upou the moon's transit and parallax:. This is an inequality of about three minutes at, the maximum, anll this has been taken into account by means of a table of double entry ~Table I, .Appendix). By making the lunar parallax: and declination the arguments iu the t,abl&i, we are enable<l to including a great number of terms of a second order of the inequalities which arise iu de\·elopments into ex:p:ressions with. circular a.rgumeuts. In this way, the effects of all the terms in the expression

216

OF

of the lunar parallax are inclu<led in tile tables having the parallax for an argument; and the effects depending upon the longitude of the moon's node are included in the tables having the declination for the argument. In these convenient arrangements, however, some sliJht sacrifices of theoretical accuracy have to be made; but they are too small to be of any cousequence. 35. In the tables given in the Appendix for computing the tidal ephemeris,Arg. I is the apparent time of the moon's transit over the meridian of Washington next preceding the time of high water; Arg. II is the moon's parallax one lunar day preceding the time of the moon's transit, used as Arg. I; Arg. III is the moon's declination one lunar day preceding the time of transit,- as in Arg. II; Arir. IV is the moon's parallax 1.5 lunar days after the time of transit, used as Arg. I; ~<\rg. V is the moon's right ascension at the time of transit, as taken in Arg. I; Arg. VI is the moon's declination 1.5 lunar days after the time of transit thus taken. 'I'he mean height of sea level used in the following tables is 4.45 feet, which is the average given for the last four _years in 'ral>le V, and therefore corresponds to the zero·plane at the close of the series, supposing that it remained unchanged these four years.
DIREC'l'IONS FOR COMPUTING A TIDAL EPHEMERIS.

Directions for computing a tidal ephemerfs will be best understood in connection with the example given in the Appendix. The column headed A, is the mean time of the moou's transit over the meridian of Washington, taken from page 330 of the American Ephemeris. The column a contains the equation of time for the time of transit, taken from page 324 of the Ephemeris. A- a= Arg. I, omitting the days, is the apparent time of the moon's transit. Arg. II is the moon's parallax at. the time of transit, obtainell by 'nterpolatiou from page 337 of the Ephemeris, and entered in the column one Jay in advance; that is, the parallax belonging to la 3h 5P1.6 is entered in the next place opposite 2a 4h 40m.7, and so on; so that the parallax used is that belonging to the time preceding the Lime of transit by one lunar clay. Arg. IV is the parallax:, taken ~.5 lunar days in advance, as it is entered in the 0olumn headell Arg. II; that is, one and a half lunar days after the time of transit. This is obtained with sufficient accuracy from Arg. II by means of interpolation, taking into account first differences only. Arguments III and V are the moon's declination and right ascension at the time of transit, taken from page 6 of the American Ephemeris for Greenwich, adding 5h to the time of Washington transit use<l as an argument, for reduction, approximately, from '\Vashington to' Greenwich time. Tilus, for the first date in the example, in the column A adll 51>, and we have, approximately, ld 9h, corresponding to which, we get from the Ephemeris, page 6, the declination and right ascension in the columns headed Arg. UI and Arg. V; but the declinations are placed one day in atlvance, as in the case of Arg. II. Arg. VI is Arg. III taken 2.5 lunar days in advance, as in the ca~ of Arg. IV with regard to Arg. II. With Arg. I and Arg. II, take a from Table I; and with Arg. IV and Arg. V, take from Table Il the parallactic and declination inequaliti'es, denoted by b and c in tbc headings or the columns in the example. With the month as an argument, then take from Table H the annual inequality, and place it in the column headed d. The uumbe1·s in the table are for the middle of the mouths, and, for other parts, small corrections can be made by means of the differences. Then take the sums of A+ a+ b + e + d + 1911 = S, and enter tllem in the column headed S, leaving intermediate spaces for the interpolations to lower transits. The 19b is composed of 121i, to reduce tl.Je astronomical time in A to civil time, and of 7h, which, together with. the constants in the table:'!, milke out 31i zm.2, the mean hmitidal interval. The column S, therefore, is civil time; anJ, when the bours exceed 12, the time is in the afternoon. The larger figures in .:::1 1 and .:::1 2 are the differences by means of which the interpolations are made. The interpolated numbers are outained by aduing (~ Ll 1 - ! 2.J} to the preceding number. The smaller figures in J 1 and Ji are the two terms of the preceding expression m1ed in the interpolation. The columns headed o are the differences after interpolation. In these di1forences, the day and the halfda.y, or 12\ are not writteu in the example of computation, but borne in mind in making the interpolations.

From the latter part of Tallie II, with Arg. \'now take the effect of the luuar tliurtrnl tide, and enter it in the column m; and., from Tallie IY, witl1 the hour of transit as one arguuHmt and tiw month as the other, take the ett'ect of the solar diurnal tide, au<l enter it in the cohtmn n. The sum of m + n = s is then interpolated for the intermelliate \':ll ues belonging to the lower transit, an<l tl1ese, it must be borne in mind, must be taken with the contrary signs; tliat is, wheres is added to 8 for upper transits, it must be subtracted for lower transits, and t·icc rasa. lu this way, the column beaded t. h. tc. is obtained, which, taken in connection with the days and h()urs of 8, is the time of high water, the decimals of a minute being neglected. Iu precisely the same manner are the accented quantitie~ taken from the same tables, usiug tli<' columns hf'aded "Heights': instead of ",Times", except that n' is taken frum Table llI iu,,;tead of Table IY. \Ve then enter a'+ b' + c' + <1 1 + 5.00 ft.= S' in tlie column headed 8', and then pr,)ct·1·1l with the interpolations for lower transits, and with the corrections for the effect;o of the diurnal ti1h·, in the :same manner as in the case of the times. Tlle const:rnt 5.00 ft., together with the cm1sta11to; in the tables, is the mean height of high water above the zero-plane. Tlrn final rnsult, in the column beaded h. h. w., is the height of high water above the zero of the tide-gauge, as it stood at the clo:m of the seriN1 of observations. Of course, no tidal theory or tide-tahles can take into account the abnomml meteorological disturbances of winds and changes of barometric pressure, which are freque11tly quite large, and differ very much in (liffereut ports for the same meteorological changes. The results obtai11c1l, t,herefore, by the preceding directions, althongh designed to be uear approximations to the trne times and heights of the tides in an undisturbed sea, will necessarily diftcr considerably frow tlic observed times and heights in individual cases.

APPENDJX No. 13.
REPOlff ON THE TlUN8IT OF VENUS EXPEDITION TO JAPAN, BY GEORGE DAVIDSON, ASSISTANT JN THE UNITED STATES COAST SliRVEY.
UNI1'ED S'l'A'l'Es COAST SURVEY SERVICE, SunOPFICE, SAN FRANCISCO.

DEAR Sm: la compliance with your re111iest, I make the following report. to ,you in relation to my work on the Transit of Venus Expedition to Japan iu December, 1874. I was ready to lea\"e San Francisco by the second steamer of July, but, in accordance with .'·our irn;tructious to leave a plan of operations for all the parties on this coast during my absence, I was detaiued nntil the end of August, awl reached Yokoliama on the 24th of September. Thi11 dela;v compelled the al.Jandonment of m.r project to ohsen"e the transit from a high mountain and iu a locality where tlle chances for good weather were the greatest, an(l I determined to occupy a ,;tatiou at ~agasaki, where I could immediately connect with one end of the cable between Nagasaki all(l \YladiYostok, for the determination of the telegraphic difference of longitude. The organization of the party was a>-1 follows: Prof. George Davidson, United States Coast Survey, eliief astronomer, in chargl' of the party; Mr. 0. H. Tittma.nn, United States Coa8t Survey, first assistant astrouomer; Mr. ,V, S. Edwards, United States Coast Survey, second assistant astronomer; Mr. S. R St'ihert, United States Treasury Department, chief photographer; Mr. H. J<J. Lodge, Boston, first assistant photographer; Mr. F. H. \Villiams, Boston, secontl assistant photogmphcr; :\fr. Uyeno, of Nagasaki, third assi8tant photographer; Mrs. George Davidson, recorder; :\Jaster George F. Davidson, recorder. The three last named were in addition to the origillal organization, as I was too short-handed. To the Japanese government I had proposed that sevcml of the younger Japanese officers or students should accompany my party to witness the opemtions and study the methods and means employed in sucb work. The following gentlemen were appointed to accompany me: Lieut. K. Otomo, Imperial Japanese Navy; Midshipman K. lsono, Imperial Japanese Navy; '~Ir. T. :\fagome, Mombusbo, Tokio. It was also arranged that Prof. David Murmy, LL.D., Chief Councillor of the Bducational Department of .Japan, and Mr. Y. Ilatakeyama, director of the Imperial College, should join the party December 1. Previous to that date, Capt. Narvo Yoshi Yanagi, Chiflf of tlm Bureau of Hydrography of the Navy Department, came from Tokio to witness the transit and longitude-experiments. Captain Yanagi is est~emed one of the most learned men in Japan. Messrs. Yanagi, Murray, Ratakeyama, and Magome were J:e(}Uired by their government t-0 w11ke special reports of the ob11en-ations of our work ; and f'rom Captain Yanagi I received authority to procure for his department the instrument!! necessary for a small observatory at Tokio. Through the kindness of Dr. l\furray, I readily obtained the necessary authority from the goverumeut to examine and locate my station in any part of the empire, and to use the telegraphic lines for the business. I arrived at Nagasaki October 6. Here the cable connects with Wladivostok and the southe1·n parts of China. The previous three months had been characterized by continuous rains and heavy typhoons, one of which was very disastrous; but the weather seemed changed for the better. .After an exa1t1ination of the hilly country immediately surrounding the bay upon which Nagasaki is situated, I selected a stoop hill, 850 foot above the bay aud a.bout one wile south of the 1>outher11 part of the town. I obtained permiss10n from Miyagawa, Kenrei of Nagasaki district, to open a ruatl tu the top of the bill. The records contain the detailed descri1ltion of the locality, and the chart shows it8 general relation t-0 the bay of N agasa.ki.

I put eighty-five men at work upon this road under tbe direction of .\fessrs. Tittrnam1 and Edwards, and so soon as it was completed the houses and instruments were carried up. Piers for the transits and equatorial were built, and the iron piers for the photographic apparatus plaeetl in position. The utmost care wa>1 exercised in building the foundations. Although my instructions contemplated the execution of the telegraphic work after the tran-;it, I cheerfully assented to the request of Professor Hall, at \vladivm3tock, to undertake it in ad\ance, as otherwise the lateness of the season might cause him to be frozen in all winter. For reasons not necessary to enumerate, I selected a transit-station for this longitude-work in the ground occupied by the telegraph company. l was informed that no arrangement bad been made with the company for this work and no plan of operations bad been proposed or agrePd npou. Upon representing the whole matter to .:\fr. Th. Russell, the manager of the Great Northern TelPgraph Company, be promised me the free use of the cable and placed me in communication with Mr. Carl Nielson, the electrician. I urged upon him the advantages of sending the clock-signals; through the cable; and upon examining the instrumental connections and methods of work he reported favorably, and I was enabled, through the insulated armature of the clock-beli:s:, to break circuit directly on the main line. But as the clock-signals were too :,;hort for transmission, the armature was held back at certain de.finite breaks in each minute. \Vith more time and a.J.ditio11al means I should hM·e been aule to leugtllen the break through the instrument itself. Of course, there were many little incidental difficulties in the way; but within ten days three uigbts were obtained wherein seYeral hundred clock-signals were successfully sent and recein·d from each station. I should have preferred two nights more, but Professor Ilall expressed himself satisfied. Mr. Russell, ou behalf of the COUJRany, gave me the use of the line for one or tvrn hours each night; and Mr. Nielson, when not on tluty, ga\·e his time wholly to our mssistance. To the otlil'r gentlemen of the company we are also indebted for kind assistance in our operations. Tlte telPgraph longitude-work at this station was done with the Unite\l States Cna'1t Surn~y merillin,ninstrument No. 2 (Davidson's) by "\Yiirdemann, and the double-pen chronograph 4848, and relays used by me in the San :Francisco-Cambridge longitude-work of 18t:m hy the Coast Sun·ey. Without these duplicates, I should luwe been compe\l~Ll to ex:ecute tilis work afGer the transit. The operations were completed 011 the 7th of No\·ember, and on the 8th I transferred all m.'time to the transit of Venus station. Subsequently, this telegraph-station was connected with the transit of Venus station hy triangulation, which also embraced the French transit station; but Professor .Janssen ne,·er made any request to connect our stations, &c. Up to November 14, fifteen observations of occultations of stars by the moon wen; rna<lP to compare with Pekin, but there was a blank in the list furnished from that date t.o Decem her ~. However, I soon found the labor of the day and the regular work of preparn.tion, practice, a1ul observing was as much as could be <lone. In order that I might be familiar with the phases of V{'ntu~, I had large painted boardR plnce(l on the Meridian Hill, three miles to the north of the transit-station. These phases were to repre-

really appear in the telescope. I recorded the practice upon these objects in the regular "daybook '', observing upon tl1em wlrnnever practicable in all sorts of weat.ber. The regular obsenations for latitude and time were wade by Mr. Tittmann, assisted by 1\fr. Edwards. Some <le>lay was occasioned in this work by disco-vering that the levels of' the Stackpole transit-instrument l;)ll7 were useless from inferior workmanship; but., fortunately, I had the UnitPd States Coast Survey meritlian-instrumeut with extra level!:;, which, after much trouble, I fitted iu the transit. I determined the valne of the micrometer of this instrument, and also the equatorial intervals. Mr. Edwards determined the inequality of the pi ,·ots of the transit-axis, wltich was fonnrl excnpti01ially large. The photographic apparatus was in good working order early in November, but for nearl,> two weeks there wtt8 not suflicieutly clear weather for drill and practice. Upon the first favorable da_y, experiments were made for the bes-t focus, and satisfactory results ga,'e us a focus one inch sl10rter than that assigned to the lem1. After this adjustment, the lens and reticulated plate ne\·er required changing. The value of the level-scale on the reticulated plate, and that of the engineer's level, were determined by )Ir. Tittmanu. For tbe quick photographs proposed near I and IV contacts, I had mad·~ frames for holding half a dozen plates, each to obtain lrn.lf the sun's disk. It would give six pictures per minute, but witb pt·oper mechanical means wonld gi\'e twPlve pictures per minute. Mr. Seibert devised a method of getting a small part of the suu'l:l border and the center, and to this I added means to get the electrical record; by this arrangement we could get a photograph every secoud. Messrs. Lodge aud \Villmms- etliciently aided all these prep~trationx. '£0 make this branch of tbe 'transit labors a success, I directed l\Ir. Seibert to spare no means for its accomplishment. The observatory was enlarged, photographic matt~rial was procured, and additional photographers for the day of transit. Upon the arrival of Dr. Murray, he cheerfully assumed the duty of recorder iu the photographic room, heside8 assisting in other operations. I<Jverything \\·as in good working order before December, and 1 felt that, so far as the meaIJs at our disposal wern coucerued, nothing had been overlooked or slighted. The instructions had been carried out as systematically as practicalJle. The ouly d1n·iation I made was ict not taking down the heliostat every night of transit-work aud <lirectiug the middle transit-thread 011 the reticulated plare before and after testing transits. The vei·y act of removing and replacing such a heaYy and unwieldy mass was, in my judgment, riskiug the safety of the reflector, and was nearly sure to jar the iron pier, if anything would. But the transit was always referred to the meri1lian-ma1·k before the examination of the photographic-plate adjustments, and e>ery (Wening and morning it was referred to the mark, so that we must know its deviation from the meridian very closely. Notwithstanding my being in readiness, we had many annoyances to hinder uniformly smooth results, in the character of the instruments. With the heliostat I had constant trouble, and was compelled to alter it and to clean it several times. The chronograph ran irregularly in spite of attention and care, aud was a source of constant annoyance with its frightful noise; but on the day of transit both chronographs weie running well. The spring governor of the equatorial broke, and no spare springs had been furnished with it; no instrument-maker was to be found in Nagasaki, and I took the instrument apart and replaced the broken spring. After running a short time, I had to take it apart and clean a second time; then the second spring broke, and again I replaced it, obtaining my springs from a Chinese watch·dealer. Aft13r more trouble from the spring, and another cleaning, I got it running well about two weeks before the transit. ' The value of the screw of the double-image micrometer I determined by the trausits of Polaris And here it may be mentioned that there were several nights when the equatorial with the double: image micrometer and highest power would not show the companion of Polaris; and at a.U times the star was irregular and deformoo.

"\Yheuever the sun was visible. I examined it; to judge of the geucral character of the limb antl of the spots, with reference to their apparent sharpness of definition and steadiness, aud for tlie faflulrc, in comparison with my observations upon it i11 the Sierra Ne1ada in the summer of 1873. The conclnsions from those observations are folly >erified and confirmed. A few <lays before tlie 9th, the weather was tbickeuing-tlrn uights were partiall_y clear, the days heavy and threatening. Ou the 8th, I outaine(l good transits for tinrn, and repeated them at 4 a. ui. on the morniug of the 9th. Suddenly, the clear bright s·arligllt morning was wholly co\~ere<l with clouds, that grew denser until sunrise, and continued after it. Abont 8 hours a. m. all the adjustments of the photographiC' apparatus were examined, the llistance between the objective aud rcticnlated plate measured, and soon after, through a break in the clouds, the re,·ersed pllotographs were successfully malle. Then the weather changed; two strata of clouds were seen to form, an upper stratum of cirrus aml cirro-stratus forming a tolerably homogeneous screen; below that, and resting on the mountain-top, two or three miles south of us (aud 1,HiJO feet ele.-ation), was a tleusri stratum of cnmulu-stratns coming up from tlie southward with slow, steady mo\·ement. At H.ao a. m., this lower stratum bt>.came dense an<l tlestroyed onr hopes; but about 10 minutes after 10 o'clock a break occurred in it, aml the sun Wl\S visible through the upper stratum with variable distinctne8s. At interrnb it was too bright to observe with the unprotected e,re at the efjnatorial, and, unfortunately, the shades of coloretl glasses were too fe1v, and at every change luid to he unscrewed, &c. I hatl au extra set fnrnished by the Coast Survey, but on preliminary examinations three had been cracked by the sun's heat. l used the li~htest shade furnished with the instrument (not the thin ones), and when I com· me.need steady watching, about two minutes before tlie predicted time ("o as to include the time of the English prediction aml to watch if Venus were visible off the sun's limb), the outline of the snn was moderately stea(ly, yet not sharply cut and defined; and I would have liked a great deal more light. As I kept up the beat of the chronometer, I felt sure that tlle predicted time was long passed, wlrnn the clouds suddenly thickened, and the faintest outline of the sun was visible; yet I hail no time to unscrew the colored glass, and before I could ha,·e done so the suu's limu brightened, and the limb of Venus was seen just entered upon the sun at the exact spot which I had been steadily wat.ching for over three minute!". From my (lracticc with the artificial Venns I judge the planet was two seconds on at the time noted; at any rate, .Mrs. Davidson made the record of the time I announced, with the necessary remarks. .About 7 or 8 secon1ls thereafter I called to the photogra· phers to commence. The sun's limb was quite unsteady just before the tirst contact, and at the brightest intervals I could not see any approach of Venus nor ans different indications at the poiut of contact other than existed at adjaeeut parts of the limb at which I occasionally glanced. The epoch noted after the first coutact was 11" 36· later than the predicted time. 1\Ir. Tittma11u was ouserving with the Coast Survey Hassler telescope of 3.1 inches aperture, au1l when I ciilled out to the photographer, he noticed that Venus was already on the sun's limb, alltl then noted the time. Captain Yanagi, with the United States Coast Survey reconoitering telescope Ko. 35 of 1~ inches objective, took his e;yc from bis instrument as if he had not seen the planet. I prepared to obtain measures of the tlistance of the phmet from the sun's limb. a,s I hall practiced, lmt, though visible, it wait then too faint to aumit of obser>ations of precision. I tried agiti n, as I had before the first contact, to observe with the unshaded eye, but sudden openings in the cloud-; rendered this too full of risk to my e~'esight. \Vhen about half the image of the planet had entered upou the sun':> disk, the images length· ened, a.ml I made fourteen micrometer·readings of the cusps under var,Ying conditions of brightness. The cusps were not so bright as I could desire; a lighter shade-glass or other means for regulating the amount of light would have enabled me to get more certain aud more numerous measures.. When near the second contaet, I turned the do11blo-im:~ge micrometer to zero for that observation. Re-00nd oontact.-This I obtainetl as weH as such au observation can be made, and altho11gh 1 thiuk

it was noted exactly, yet I feel satisfied that it has not an error of 2 seconds; it occurred about 2 minutes after the predicted time. There was no black-drop or true ligament or band, only slight distnruauce of the limbs that prevented such a sharp separation as I had observed in the total solar eclipse of 1869 in Alaska. But this disturbance was exactly similar to what I have been accustomed to meet with in twenty-nine ;years' experience on the Coast Sur\'ey at small elevations. It was similar to the disturbance that I had noticed in the artificial Venus; but UtlOU this subject I will add an appendix. Mr. Tittmann reports that he obsened the second contact wen. The sun was seen through the 11aze or thin clouds of the upper stratum, aud the limb was not disturbed. The liue of light broke clearly and in an apparent true continuation of the limb of Venus. He reports that when be took his eye from the telescope to catch the tens of seconds 011 tl1e chronometer, Oa.ptain Yanagi called out" time" to his assistant, thus noting it about four seco11tls later than Mr. Tittmaun. After the second contact, I commenced measures of the separation of the limbs of the planet and sun, and with var_ying phases of brightness and unsteadiness until the images were too faint. I obtained se\'ent_y-eight micrometer-readings. I bad mounted the United States Coast Survey meridian-instrnment No. 2 to observe the passage of the sun and Venus at meridian transit, and also arranged for Mr. Tittmann to obserye the difference of declination of the upper limb of the sun and of the limbs of Venus tn transit-instrument No. 1507. Near culmination, the snn was 1nutially obscured, and I used the light shades of the sextant, gh·ing a light-orange image of the sun. The record was made on the fillet of the Coast Snrvey chronograph 4848 umler the watchiug of George F. Davidson, and I observed the first limb of the sun o\·er 9 threads, the first limb of Venus over 8, and second limb over 8 threads, and the secoud limb of the sun over G threads. l\'Ir. Tittmann made nineteen micrometer-readings of the sun's ap1mreut upper limb and the upper and lower limbs of Venus, the time being noted by Mr. EJwar<ls. Clouds again intervened; but at ten minutes after meritliau I commenced measuring the diameter of Venus with the double-image micrometer with varying phases of visihility. In this work I ohtaiued forty-four micrometer-readings, and good results. Mr. Tittmann made nine measures aml Dr. Murray six, when the clouds obscured the sun completely. The observations for the meridian pasMage of the sun, and of Venus when projected thereon, for diflerences of declination aud for the diameter of the planet, are not mentioned in the instructions of the commission. The clou11R increased, and nothing now seemed possible. There was a slight break when Venus was one diameter from the third contact; tbeu more clouds. Third contact.-A t the third contact there was an opening in the clouds, and ten or fifteen St'conds before contact I saw the clear separation of the limbs with litt-le or no unsteadinesshetter even than at second contact; no ligament or band-when clouds suddenly covered it at the time of contact, and again broke away just after contact. But I felt that contact bad not 00011rred more than five seconds, and noted the time of tbe reappearance of brightness, with proper remarks. There was a clear, sliarp outline; no disturbance. The sharp points of the cusps were almost touching, and were very delicately-pointed objects. This t'poch is only eighteen seconds from the predicted time. For this observation I was m'!ing the unprotected eye, and in the sudden gleams of brightness was almost compelled to desist. Mr. Tittmann observed with the unshaded eye, and noted the contact, but recorded that" clouds passing interfered with the exactness of the determination, but apparently the clouds caused the only uncertainty. Observer 68nnot form an estimate of the error of' his observation." .After the third contact there was a sHgbt opening in the clontls, and without sttnshRde I trietl to get measures of the cuspsi but succeeded in obtaining only three mierometer·readiogs with cusps' points. FO'Urth cPntact.-At the time of the fourth contact the sky was hidden by dense clottds, and about 4 p. m. rain commenced. During the obserYations at the equatorial I was sssisted by Mr. Tittmann, yko noted the times for the micrometer-measures. Mrs. Davidson and George F. Davidson a8$ieted in recording ot.her obaerYations and atten<Hng to the chronograph.

PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK.

After I uotified the photograpliers to commence, the plates for frequent exposures near fi1·;;t contact were run through, but no indentation of V cnus is exhibited. This was when I foiled to get measures for the cusps. \Vhen the sun came out sufficiently bright for me to observe, impressions were obtained, aud the negath~es were exposed wl.JeU1er there was su11 or clouds; of course, nmny plates show nothing whatever; but by this plan views were obtained at intervals when there was an opening of a minute or two. IIa.d there been a clear day, the operations were so systematic and consecutive, from my employment of extra photographers-J;tpauese-that not less than four hundred plates could have been ~ade. About one hundred and sixteen plates were exposed up to the time when the sun wholly disappeared, and probably one-half of that number fnmish as fair photographs as could. be o\.Jtaiuecl under the circumstances, and with collodion films. Mr. W. S. Ed wards remained at the heliostat throughout the day to direct it in case of derangement. He had been well practiced to have taken Mr. Tittmann's or my place in case of oar illness or of accident. Time-observotions.-A t dark, after the transit, there was a narrow break in tlle rain-clouds for half an hour or more, and I fortunately succee(led iu getting a good set of transit-stars for time. Then the night shut in, thick and raining. Having been informed by the Secretary of the Commission that t11e funds of tlle Commission were low, that the telegraph-work hence to Melbourne was abaudonetl, and that I should clo!'e operations as soon as practicable, I made my preparations aceordingly; but carried on photogral)hic experiments for 011e week longer, as instructed. The instruments were dismounted, and such as were ordered home were shipped, while others were deposited in the United States naval storehou;ie, as directed; but a receipt for the same was refused me b.Y the United 8tates naval storekeeper. The work of preparation and observation had given me a fair opportunity for judging of the capacity of the instruments and methods, outfit, and personnd for working, and I proposed to the Commission to make a special report thereon. Some of my views of the iustrnments ha\"e been embodied iu my general report to you. On bebalf of the members of my party I can speak with freedom, becauoo there has \.Jeen no jar, want of harmony, or shrinking from duty, and they gained the respect of the Japanese officials and people. And it J..lil a pleasant duty to report my gratitude and hearty thanks t<> the Japanese authorities for assistfng my labors and intercourse with the people, for affording me use of the government. telegraph from Nagasaki to Tokio for subsequent telegraphic lo11gitmle-work, and for assigning officers of rank, positi()n, and qualification to accompany ths expedition allll assist in the final work, and to report upon its appliances and methods, &c. In connection with the transit-work, a short series of magnetic obsen·ations was made to include the declination, horizontal force, and inclination. And to connect tile telegraph and transit stations, as well as to include the :French station, a short base was measured, signals erected for triangulation, and azimuth-observations made sufficient for the purpose. The records of a.ll the transit-work and the day-books were duplicated and forwarded to the President of the Commission, before my leaving Nagasaki. You will recollect that I appealed to yott and to the President of the Commission for permission to determine the telegraph difference of longitude between Nagasaki and Tokio, at the expense of the Oommiasion or of the Coast Survey. At the request of Captain Yanagi, Dr. Murray, aud others, and the promise of their assistance, I determined to bear the cost of this undertaking myself after all tlie transit-work was done. Ou their return homeward, Messrs. Tittmaun and Edwards voluntarily offered to give their services at Tokio, instead of taking a ~hort leave of absence which I bad granted them.

ltEPORT OF TilE SUPERINTENDENT OF

.For this work, a small ollsen·atory was erect.ell in the extensiye grounds of the ltnllerhtl NaYy Department at Tokio, aml a loop of the maiu telegraph-line was run from the telegraph main station. A 1001) was also rnn iuto the l\Ie:xieau transit of Venus station at Yokohama, whereby Sefior Don Dias Corrubias was enabled to receive my signals passing betweeu Nagasaki aud Tokio; and some of the details of my plau were made to accord to his wislles, a.,; lie was not in reality prepared with instruments for this work. · My signals passed through the main Ii ue at Ko bi (Hiogo ), whel'e the second French stntiou was located; but Professor Janssen was enga.ge!l for st.weral weeks in determining the telegraphic difference of longitude between Nagasaki station and Kobi. Every assistance was rendered to the party at Tokio, Lis Captain Yanagi, Chief of the Burt\au of Navigation, and hy ~Ir. Tanaka, Vice-Minister of Education, secomlell by lUr. Morris, the Chief of the Telegraph-Hues. At Nagasaki, I recd\·cd thl1 hearty support of the Japanese superintendent allll his native and European assistants. Vor recorder in this work I had the services of my sou, George F. Davids011. This. hearty co-operatiou at both ends of the line, aud moderately good weather, euabled rue to obtain tlie transmission of clock-signal,; o,n se\·en nights ht>tween December 20, 18';«.t, and January 2, 187i:i; with a fiehl-curupuleu result of 3!)m 30·.~ for the difference of longitude instead of 39m 40· from the charts. This result I communicated to Ua.ptain Yanagi. \Vant of time has prevente.d my further reductiou of this special work. In this work, tue weakness of the 8iugle-pen d1ruuograph was made eYident. A two-pen chrouograph was nsetl at Tokio, and a one-pert chronograph at Nagasaki. Upon two nights the Tokio clock urokc so 11early coincident wit]J miue that I con1d ha'l'e gotten only an approximate result if I hall not resorted to unusual expedients. Had a mean-time chronometer been availahle at one end of the line for the trausmission of signals this trou!Jle would have been olJYiate(l. My letter to you of January 14, 1875, mentions this and correlatiYe matters. 1'Thile I was engaged in this work, Dr. Valentine, the chief of the German transit-party at Uhufoo, China, arrirnll with chronometers on a German man-of-war for the determination of the tlifterence of longitude between that station and Nagasaki. I gave him the use of my observatory when I sbould finish; but before that be compared with my chronometer for time. Ile did not move his chronometers from the vessel, but compared his pocket-cht·onmJ,1.eter with my obs(lrving-chrouometer and then compared with the chronometers on the vessel. During the '.£okio telegraph longitude-work we obsen·ed for personal eq nation. I may here mention that upon the twenty-four day rnyage from San Francisco to Japan I made observations for magnetic ,-ariation, an"ll in midoce<m the steamship was swung to correct my observations. Having no special instruments, I used tlie ordinary Schmalkalder compass. I also observed the uip daily; but, unfortunately, the axis of the observing-needle w~s broken tbe day before arriving at Yokohama.
OBSERVATIONS AT GREA'l' ELEVATIONS.

Bdore closing this report I desire to add a few words of my experience on the subject, of direct interest in the transit of Venus observations. The judgment which I expressed about four 3·ears since of the importance and necessity of great (l}evations from wllicil to make astronomical observations of prech..,ion, and subsequently, of the importance of observing tbe trausit of Yeuus at great elevations (Special report and letter to the late Superintendent), was amply confirmed by m.r experience at Nagasaki. At uo time whate~er bad I been al>le to see with the Clark 5-inch Xo. 862, the limb, spots, })enumbrre, faculre, &c., of the sun with the same definiteness with which I daily observed it with the 3-inch Hassler, and a smaller telescope, on the Sierra Nevada at an elevation of 7,250 feet. I did not see a silar1) llorder to the sun at Nagasaki up to Jan nary 41 187J5 (elevation 850 feet); was uot able to trace the apparent inflowing toward tbe centers of the sun spots; and did uot see the faculre on any part of the sun. The limb of the sun was always blurred and unsteady. On some nights the seeing was occasionally almost as good with this equatorial as with the II assler on the Sierra; the serrations of tbe moon's limb and all the irregularities were well defined;

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURYEY. the border was exhibited with sl.Jarpness, and the fiue points of the cu::;p8 were ge11erally good objects. The divhiion of Saturn's rings was better here upon one or two uigltts with the CLlrk .).inch than 011 the Sierra with the Hassler 3-inch, according to m:r recollections of the latter. So was the companion of Polaris at times, when I used the highest-power astronomical eye-pieee. Black drop, cfc.-Ilaving also expressed the conviction that the ligament, or Llack drop, of Yeuus was due to the same cause that produces Baily's beads, I am induced to gi\·e you a short account of my experiments before the transit of Venus. Referring to the rough sketch already giYen to illustrate the artifieial Veuus on )leritlian Hill, at ~agasaki:-these were made of tile same size as the planet woL1ld actually appear in the telescope, and I practiced upon the different measures under nearly all conditions of weather, and made the record as if it were actual transit-work. In these experiments I CXJ)el'ienced a]l}>earancc;; such as occur to us almost daily in the geodetic work of the survey, and wuieh iu astronomical obsen·ations have been designated the "black drop," &c. Upon some cloudy days, when the atmosphere was quiet, the outlines of the artitkial Venus were comparati-vel.v sharp aud steady; but when the suu shone out fiercely after a rai11 the outline:,; wen· confused and tlie objects unfit for obsen-ation. Early in the morning or late in tl.Je afte1·noon was the period when the objects were best suited for good work. \Yllen they were very unsteady and confused the border of the sun and the spots of the sun were ali!o unsteady, boiling, au d blurred and nnfit for observations of precision. After such a dtty the moon frl·qneutly had a <'1.'111· fused Lorder and the ragged edge was ill defined and unsteady. I had two meridian-marks for the transit-instrument neiir the artitici<d Yen us, autl on 011P of them was a Loanl pierced witb. several holes. Under ordinary circ1urnsta11ces, the atmo:sphL·re was so uusteadJ·, and the mark apparentl.Y so unsteady, that the holes conld not be distinguished; but when the atmosphere became steady so tllat the artificial Venus arnl sun were moderately good objects for observation, then the boles in the meridian-mark could be seen distinctly. Dnring the state of unsteadiness the sides of the adjacent holes were in fact apparentl.)' connected liy the so. called ligament. Lest there be doul>t about that effect of the unsteadiness, I ma.Y mention that in my experienee in geodetic work on the Pacific coast I lrn-,·e sometimes bad my signal, as seeu from certain directions, apparently almost touching a light-colored tree (say a dead, barked troe) nea.r it. \VlleneH'l' the atmosphere was steady, there was no doubt in tbe observer's mind about the separation of tlie two objects, but wllenever the atmosphere became unsteady the two objects woulU uecome so confused as tQ,. apparently coalesce and separate throughont their lengths, and also join aad S('paratc in parts of' their lengths. .Again, pole:> standing out clear of surrounding ohjectR become, when the atmosphere is unsteady, unusually diffused and broad, and frequently they can be seen flying away in parts as the unequally disturbed (refracted) atmospheric waves break np tile image. Similar phenomena are seen with heliotropes, and especially when the objects are much elougated YCl'tically. A similar phenomenon is exhibited by objects on the bottom of' shallow wate1· whose surface is greatly agitated by the wind. ·what I witnessed in the experimeuts with the artificial Venus and snn I have experienced through thirty-two years' work. A,nd ou tile 9th of December similar appearances, in a moderate degree, were exhibited between the limbs of Venus and the snu. There were to me no new phenomena., allihough I wa.s a.cutely alert to_ uetcd such, and l had no more difficulty in deciding than I ba\-e daily iri geodetic work, or in transits of the snn or moon. 'fhere was a slight disturbance between the limbs of the sun and Venns exactly similar to the disturbance in the artificial Venus and sun, and of the same character that gh·cs rise to tlrn Baily's beads, and to the confusion of the images of double stars upon nights w b.en the atmospliere is unsteady. There was a. ligament at this station as depicted and described by some of tile OOSN\"CTS of the transit of Venus of 1761 and 1769; and even reported by ollservers at Yokohama, in 1874. C<!rtainly there was no such phenomenon as black drop. Nor was there to my vision any diiltortion of the planet's disk. At the third contact, or rather about 5 or 10 seconds after it (for a cloud hid the actual contact),

230

the sun and planet were o!JserYed witl10ut colored glass; the atmosphere wafi! then quite steady (threatening rain), and the cusps were very sliarply defined. During these obser\·ations, I was obserdug through two strata of clouds, the upper one of which seemed to prevent the passage of heat. rays so that the lower !Jody of air was not disturbed, i. e., unequall_y and irregularly refracted. I had a somewhat similar experience in obserying the total solar eclipse of August, 1869, in .Alaska; the day was cloudy and at times rainy, the atmosphere was exceptionally qniet, and the disappearing limh of the sun at totality (seen through a rift in the cloud:;) was a liue of the sharpest, clearest character, withont a wave or a break in it. ( l';ide report to tbe Superintendent.) In conclusion, from these and other observations and experiences, l ha ye no hesitation in saying that all the phenomena of IJlack-drop, ligament, &c., IJetweeu Venm;; and the sun, .as well as the plleuomena of Baily's beads at total solar eclipses, are due to the unsteatliness of the atmosphere at the time and place of observation. Aud it appears to we highly proballle that tlJe phenomenon wllich I have twice observed and reported, of Antares being }ffojected upon the bright body of the moon for 2~ seconds after apparent contact '\\1.th the limb and before the sudden disappearance of the star, may be due to the same cause-the moon's bright limb being so disturbed by irregnlar atmospheric refractions as to become blurred, coufused, and apparently enlarged. Therefore, to obtain the best results in all astronomical observations, we should make them at g-rcat anll isolatell eleYations, where the atmospheric disturbance is a minimum. But if the high eliwation ue a plateau or only on the general level of the surrounding mountains we cannot expect so good results as on peaks or ridges risiug high above them. Guder such favorable conditions, and with equatorials of 8 inches, I believe we shall 8ee Venus at the next transit long before the iirst and long after the last contact with s~fficient definition to measure her distance from the sun, and that at contacts sharp limbs will be exhibited and closer times be observed. Moreo\'er, I suggest at the urxt transit of Mercury, in May, 1878, observations be macle at gt·eat altitudes, as well as at low, with similar instruments, to obtain further results in this examination. During the coming season, I hope to make test-observations upon the high sum.mits of the Sierra :Nevada, when occupying them for the geodetic irnrposes of the Coast Survey.

REPORT ON THE TRANSIT O~' VE~US EXPEDITIO~ TO CHATHAM ISLAND, BY EDWL\i ASSISTANT IN THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.
S~IITH,

SCB-

IYASHINGTON, D. .lune 30, 1875. SIR: I 11ave tbe honor of submitting the following re1lort of my duties undel' the Transit of Venus Commission, in conformity with your instructions, dated April 21, 1874:

o.,

I reported to the Honorable Secretary of the Navy, April 22, and received instrnctions to report to the President of the 'l'ransit of Venus Commi.s1'ion for further or<lers. I reported officially to the President of the Commission at the Naval Observatory, \\-ashing-ton, D. U., April 25, but bad already been at work there for several days. l\Ir. Albert H. Scott, of the Coast Survey, who had received instructions to report iu the same manner as myself, but aR assistant in my party, had done so, and was also at work at the observatory. From this time to June 1, the time was occupied in testing the instruments, becoming familiar with the methods of observalion, and iu organizing the party. During this time, I also obsc1Ted for personal equations with the '»arious obserrnrs at tlw olJservatory, for tbe longitude-work in the South, of the past winter. On Jnne 3, I received instructions from the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation to report to the Vice-Admiral at the navy-yard, New York, which I did, aml recei\·ed orders to, report to Commander Ualpll Chandler on board the Swatara, which I also did on the same date. l\Iy party alw reported to me on board the Swatara, on June 3, in conformity "Witlt their instructions from tLe President of the Transit of Venus Commission. \Vhen we left Washington, the organization of the party was as follows, viz: Edwin Smith, Subassistant in the United States Coast Sun·ey, chief of the party; Albert II. Scott., Uuited States Coast Sun·ey, assisbu1t astronomer; Iionis Seebohm, chief photographer; Otto Hnel1ler, fir:-t assistant photographer; \V. IT. Hau, second assistant photographer; and Sumner Tainter, intstrument-maker to the expedition, althoqgh attached to the party of Prnf. \Villiam llarknesl'i, IT. 8. N., was to remaiu at Chatham Islantl. On June 6, tbe party was on board the United States sloop of war Swatal'a, under the command of Commander Ralph Chandler, lI. S. N., Ising off the Ilattery at New York. In :Xev York, Mr. Louis Seebobm appeared to be in good health, but we had scarcely left the harbor when lw began to suffer from sea-sick11es8, and continued to get worse. \\'hen we reached the equator, July 4, be was barely able to walk without assistance. 13y the ad\·ice of Captain Clntn(llt·r aml the surgeons of the Swatara, Drs. Kershner and Kidder, Mr. Seebohm was left at Bahia, Brazil, with money and instructions to return to th'il United States. Mr. Seebohm died at Baliia, of ;rellow fever, about ten da;ys after the Swat.ara sailed. B,v instructions afterwar<l rccei\'ed from tlie pre;.;ident of the commission, Mr. Buehler was made chief photographer, and Mr. Han first assistmit photographer. At Hobart Town, Tasmania, agreeable to Captain Chandler's instructions from the Iiouorable Secretary of the Navy, I took charge of the twenty chronometers for longitude, on board the Swatara. Their corrections on Hol.iart Town time had been determined and furnished me by l'rof. William Harknl\ss, U. S. N., chief of Hobart Town party. The Swatara s:iilccl October 10, aud frequent comparisons of the chronometers were made while at sea between Hobart Town alld Obatham Island. On the evening of October HJ, the Swatara anchore(l in Wh~garoa (I,ong Bay) Harbor, north side of Petre Bay, Chatl1am Island. The next day, t11e sites for the station and camp were selectecl, and work immediately begun. On the evening of October 21, camp was settled and tbe transit pier and bonse built ready to mount the instrument. The weather, however, did not admit of satisfactory observations till October 25, wheu tlte chronometers on board the Swatara were compared,

and tnrned over to Lieut. G. P. Wilkins, U. S. ~.,navigating officer of the Swatara. The Swatara sailed from \Yhangaroa at six o'clock on the morning of October 26. Chatham Island is of small extent, being included in a circle of abont tbirty-ffre miles iu diameter. The southern, western, and northern shores of the island are rocky, and rise abruptly about tliirt:.' or forty feet; the eastern shore is a long, low sand-beach, near which hea:vy seas continually break. Petre Bay is a large open bay on the western side of the island, and Whangaroa Harbor, a small bay on the uorth side of Petre Bay, is tlrn only harbor on the island. lt is small hut perfectly safe for two or three vessels. (See sketch.) In the northern part of the island, sPvt·ral liills rise to the height of fhTe allll six hundred feet, the most prominent of which are l\fannganui and hrn Kawa, or Mount Dieffenbach. 'l'he latter is about fi\·e milef;) from "\Vhangaroa, a11tl lrn<l been selected for tile station before leaving tlle United States, but it was impossible to get the instruments there and monntl'd iu the limited time we had before the day of transit. The rocks are mostly basaltic, and pumice is found in considerable quantities, indicating tbe volcanic origin of the h1land. The soil in many places is very rich, and produces fine vegetables and grain. In other places it is clay covered with a peaty earth, which yaries from a few inches to se,·eral feet in thickness. In the low parts this peat seems to be floating on water, and after a heavy rain it is impossible to cross it for several da;ys. In some higher portions this peat has been burning- for·some thirty year:;;. The grazing is very good in most parts of the island, and many sheep aud cattle are raised. Few trees are found, mul these only near the shores. Tile Chatham Islmul lil_y is a plant peculiar to the island. A great number of seeds and bulbs were brought to the liuited States, but were destroyed in transportation. Their are from two hundred and fifty to three hundred inhabitant.'l on the island, about one· half of wborn are Emopeans. Of the remaining number about one-half are l\Ioriories, the aborigi· nes of the islan\l, and the other half Moaries, from New Zealand. Several skulls of' lloth these races were hrought to tlie United States, and the most valuable sent to the Smithsonian Institn. tion. The Europeans are mostly English and German, who performed various kind offices for us.
ST.A.TION.

The instruments wt>re placed quite near the top of the hill, on the west side of \Vhangaroai Harbor, thus being protected from tbe strong westtlrly winds which prevail at Chatham Island, and still allowing a good view of the sun at the time of last contact, the sun then heing only about 10 degrees al'OVe the horizon. They were nearly in the same meridian, the eqnatorial being 228 feet south of tile transit·instrumont. The transit and photographic instruments were about 65 and the rquatorial about 8."J feet above the level of the sea. (See accompanying sketch No. 25.)
FOUNDATIONS.

The soil in which the foundations were made is of clny. At the point wbore the photographic plate-bolder pier was set tho chty :was so hard that the bole was made with eonsi<lerable difficulty; but at the points where the photographic objective and transit piers were set the soil was so soft a11d wet that deep holes were made, drained, and foundations of stone and cement of over two feet n thickness made for the piers to rest upon. With the photographic objective, particularly, we bad much difficulty. A bole more than :fi-ve feet square about the pier was filled to the surface with stone and cement. The transit-pier was built of brick above the foundation, and capped with a single brownstone brought from America. Having i10 rain for two or three weeks, the soil all about hecame very bard. Owing to our small foree and the difficulty of getting the material to the station, the work progressed slowly. Not a moment was lost, but still the equatorial was not ready for work till November 13, and regular practice iu photography not begun till November 1 i.
llllSTBU:M:ENTS.

The following instruments were used at Chatham Island: Stacli;pole transit No. 1506. Ulark & Son's equatorial telesoope No. 861.

Cllronometer Bond & Son No. 387, sidereal time and break circuit (Uuiie(l States Coa~t Survey}. Zenith-telescope No. 6 (United States Coast Sur>ey). A clock was furnished, but not used. l"hotograpbic apparatus with plate-holder No. 2. Objective No. VII, reflector No. 1, heliostat Ko. 1. Measuring-rod and an engineer's level. Set of magnetic instruments, magnetometer No. 5, and dip-circle Ko. 105. The records of each particular class of work contain all necessary information about the instruments used. The Hipp cylinder chronograph and the levels of the transit were not satisfactory.
OBSERYA'l'IONS.

Previous to December 8, all the astronomical observations were made by myself; but after that date they were mostly made by l\Ir. Albert H. Scott. All observations for latitude and errors of chronometers were made with the Stackpole transit No. 1500. For errors of chronometers, 172 observations were made on 59 stars on 21 nights. For latitude, 80 observations we.re made on 16 pairs of stars on (; nigllts. The value of one revolution of the micrometer-screw was determined by four sets of obsen·ations on B. A. C. No. 47!IO, L. C., and p Octantis, L. C., on two nights. The value of one divisiou of the level-scales and the inequality of the pivots had beeu determined at \Vashiugton. The chronometers were compared twice each day, and, near December 8, three times. They were carefi1lly protected from great changes of temperature, and their temperatures always recorded . .AJter the transit, the value of one revolution of the screw of the double·image micrometer with highest power of the equatorial was determined from 38 obsen"ations of fl Hydrre and 10 observations on r Ilydrre on three nigllts. The weather wouid admit of no occultations L>eing obsen·ed. The United States Coast Sarvey zenitil-telescope No. G was mounted, and an attempt made to get observations of equa,l altitudes on the moon and a star, bat on one night only were wo successful. Tllis makes the longitude of Chatham Island depend entirely upon the chronometers on board the Swatara, which were compared twice at the island, on Octobur 25, 1874, and January 3, 1875.
PHOTOGRAPHY.

The adjustments of the apparatus were frequently examined, and their errors determined. These observations show the instruments to have remained very steady. \Vhen practice was first begun, the imag~ of the sun was very much blurred. It was soon discovered that both the reflector and objective were held t-00 firmly in their cells, and by loosening tlle inner ring of the cells we obtaine<l a much sharper image. A contrivance was made to make twenty exposes on one plate of those small portions of the sun's limb where Veuus should enter and leave the <lil$k. It worked well, and we expected to get twenty such plates at both the beginning and endiug of the transit. For some reason all the photographs obtained at Chatham are much thinner than is desirable. I endea>ored to iwpress upon the pl1otographers the necessity of the uegatives being more dense, and for this reason, together with climate, some slight changes were made in the chemicals. A statement by Otto Buehler, cllief photographer, to be found in the record, will explain.
DAY OF 'l'RANSIT.

The duties of the members of the party on the day of the transit were ns follows: Mr. Albert H. Scott, assistant astronomer, kept the record, and had general cllarge of the photographic operations; ,V. H. Rau, as8istant photographer, prepared the plates and put them into the holder; l\ir. Sumner Taiu te.r, i11strnmeat-rnaker, made tho exposures and- read the le\'el ; l\Ir. Otto Buehler, B. Ex. 81--30

chief photographer, developed and finished the negatives, and was responsible for the good working of the chemica.ls; one of the men, 11amed 'l'uruer, looked out for the beliostat and chronograph; assisted by :J\lr. W. Bouke, a Germau resident of the island, I observed with the equatorial. On the 6th of December, fine obser>ations for time were obtained and the azimuth of the photograpl1ic telescope careful].'~ examined. The>e were the last observations previous to the transit. December 7 was a dark, dull, rainy thty. The morning of December 8 was still cloudy. The instruments were carefully examined, however, and everything put in rnadiuess for work. About noon, a few clear places were seen. At 1 p. m., one hour before first contact, every man was at his post in the photographic house. A moIPent later, on going to the equatorial, the spring governor of the driving clock was found broken. I immediately sent for ~Ir. Tainter, and by his skill and coolness the clock was taken off, spring repaired, and the instrument again in order at 1 h 40m p. m., twenty minutes before first contact. Anxiously we now waited, hoping the contact might be seen through some of the thin clouds flying about. A.bout sixteen minut<>s after first contact, a thinner cloud passed o,·er the sun, and I obtained nine readings of tbe micrometer for measurements of cusps, though Venus and the sun could scarcely be seen, no shade-glass being used. At the photographic lwuse, no reilectiou could be seeu during this time. Had the reflector been silvered, perhaps we mig-ht have obtained contact-pictures. Nothing more was seen of the snu till fourteen minutes after second contact, when 1 outained nineteen readings of micrometer to measure the shortest distance between the limbs of Venus and the sun. During this time a number of plates were exposed in the }Jhotographic house, lrnt few are good. About twenty-eight minutes after second contact the sun came out bright, but not perfectl,Y clear. Ten more micrometer-measures were made, aud several very good photographs obtained. About forty minutes later the sun again appeared faintly, and eleven good measures of the diameter of Venus were obtained and more plates exposed. About one hour aud sixteen minutes before third contact heavy clonus passed over the sun, and, shortly after, it began to rain. lfain ceased shortly before third col):tact, and when Venus was about half-way off the sun, J had a glimpse of her for about one second. Thirteen minutes after last contact tl1e sun came out for a fow minutes, after which it was not again seen from Chatham Island for several days. No more obsen'ations were possible till Dece:n her 20. In the photographic operations twenty plates were exposed, thirteen of wliicll show an image, bat only eight are good. At no time was the sun perfectly clear of cloudt>, and in all the exposures the slid0 was moved by band.
WORK AFTER THE TRANSIT.

A s1uyey of the station and l'>lll'roundings was made by ID,\'Self, and afterward by Mr. S. Tainter, to include the entire harbor of \\Thangaroa. We bad not the means of doing the hydrographic work necessary to make a complete chart. The tides, however, were <;>bserved. It is to be regretted that the h~·drograpllic work was not done by tbe officers of the Swatara. This survey has hcen plotted and the map pbotolitbographed by the United States Coast SnrYey, a copy of which accompanies this report. A complete set of magnetic observations was made by Mr. Albert H. Scott; and after the transit the ob~ervations for intensity were repeated by ms self. 'l'he Swatara anive<l on the morning of ,January 3, 1875. Observations for time were obtained, and the chronometers ou board the Swatara compared for 1ougitude that same nigbt. By noon on Jan nary 5, all the Chatham Island party and instruments and cq uipage were on board the Swatara. The Swatara sailed a secon<l time from \Vhangaro<l Harbor on the morning of January 6. The Swatara arrived at Port Chalmers, Xew Zealand, 011 January 10, and a copy of the Chat· ham Islan<l records was immediately sent to Washington. The party remained together on board the Swatara till she arrh·ed at l\Ielbourne, February 19. Here, in conformity with instructions reeeivml through Captain Chandler, I advanced to each member of the party a sufficient sum of money to return to their homes l)y t11e mail-route, Yia San Francisco, wi.tb instructions to report by letter to the president of the 'l'ransit of Venus Uommissiou. I left l\lelbourne ou February 25, and arrived, Yia Europe, at New York, June 15, but a short time after the Swatara. Soon after my return, the original records of the Chatham party were sent to the commission.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

~35

On June 21, I reported in person to you at the Coast Survey Office, after which a few days were passed in settling my accounts and other work with the cow!llii,;sion. A colllplete copy of the Chatham Island records bas been deposited at the Uoast Surve:y Oftice, in conformityf.with your wishes.
COMPUTATIONS A.ND RESULTS.

Preliminary and partial computations of the observations for time, latitude~ lougitude, and magnctios were made while at Ohatham Island. In consequence of my going on duty in the Coast Survey very soon after my return to the United States, these unfinished computations were sent to the office, where the latituue and magnetic observations have been recomputed. These results art' given in this report. It is impossible to give the final result for longitude at present, as it depends upon observations at other stations and data whicll I have not at baud. From the preliminary computation of the first comparison of chronometers on boanl the Swatara at Cllatham Island, the longitude of the station is 1760 39' 50" west. ·
LATITUDE· OilSERY.A.TIO NS.

The fol1owing observations for latitude were made witb the Stackpole transit No. 1506. Tllis Jnstmment has a focal length of allout thirty inclJCs and a clear aperture of two and a half inches. A prism is placed in the axis and the eye-piece at one end of the axis i.imilar to the Hussian portable transits. The power used was sixty (very nearl.y). Tlie micrometer has three parallel wires, called I, II, III. The distances between tUese wires in revolutions of the screw were accurately determined. "\Vire 11 was generally used. \Yl.ienever either of the other wires was ut>ed a 11ote was made-a small correction being required to reduce it wire IL The value of one dh·ision of the level·scales was determined with the Coast Survey level-t,ricr in ::\fay, 1874, llefore lea,·ingWashington. The 'Value of one division of scale of level 0 used in these obsern1tions is 1".-US This level was very unsatisfactory. The value of one revolution of the micrometer-screw was determined by the following series of observations:

The proper wotiom1 given in the B. A. C. of many of tlie stars observeu are derfred from a c.:omparison of their places in Lacaille's Catalogue (reduced to 1750) with their pl:tces in Brisbane's Oa.talogue (1825} and Taylor's Catalogue, and are little l'l:'liable. This appears from the wildness of several of the results for latitude where the places of the stars ba\·e only tlte H. A. C. authority. By omitting the proper motions altogether of such stars, results for latitude are obtained much more acoordant with those obtained frow pairs of stars, the places of which are found in the l\1.elhourae and Washington Catalogues. A correction has therefore heen applied to several of the results for latitude based on tbe omission of prope.r motion.

0 .16 probable error of final result.

The final result for latitude is satisfactory, and far within the limit of accuracy required. The probal>le error of a single. observation ( ± O" .8) is about double that I usually get with the Coast Survey meridian-telescopes, made by 'Wiirdemanu, which have a focal length of only 26 inches and a clear aperture of only li inches, with a power of abont 60. The large probable error with the Stackpole transit was probably due to the bad level.,}'
MAGNETIC ODSERVA.TIONS.

The following determinations of the maguetic elements were made at a point SW. by S. from the camp, about 200 feet from the shore of Whaugaroa Bay and just at the foot of a low hill covered with a dense growth of coarse grass aml heath. Jn all this part (western) of Chatham Island, the rocks are hasa1ts and micaceous clay-slat('S; this Jatter being largely veined witb quartz. There are no rocks in the immediate vicinity of the magnetic station, tbe nearest being the micaceous slates which crop out along the shores of the bay. Latitude of magnetic station . . . . . . · · . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . · . . · . 430 49' 03" Longitude of magnetic station .........·.··........·.... 12i. 13m 21° east of Greenwich. The instruments used at Chatham Island have already been mentioned .. They are very similar to the instruments that have been used by the Ooast Sarvey for many years. They were new, and had ue\'er been tested before being used at Chatham Island. The magnets had been badly magnetized, and we had no means of properly correcting this fault. Magnetometer No. 5 was furnished with two collimator-magnets, marked T. V. No. 9 and T. V. No. IO. They were both about three-quarters of au inch in diameter, No. 9 being one and nine-t.eutbs inches and No. 10 one and four-tenths inches long. Both magn~ts have scales divided

from 0 to 160. During the observations for aeclination the value of one division of the scale of each magnet was determined to be as follows: For No. 9, L division= 2'.374; for No. 10, 1 division= 2'.728. At the same time, the reading of the axis of magnet No. 9 was found to be 114.63 divisions. Observations to determine the temperature co-efficie11t (q) of ma~net )fo. 9 were made, but the changes of temperature were too rapid to give reliable results; q bus been assumed to be
0.0003.

Inertia-ring No. 5 belonging to this instrument wal'l weighed and measured at the Coast Survey Office April, 187 4, but the temperature was not given.

APPENDIX No. 15.
DESCRIPTION OJ<' AN APPARATUS FOR RECORDING THE MEAN OF THE TIMJ<~S (}FA SET OF OBSERVATIONS, BY C. S. PEIRCE, ASSISTANT IN THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

The object of the coutrivance is to enable an observer, after he bas touched a key at each OIJP of several obsen'atiom;, which succeed at a constaut interval of a few seco11ds, immediately to rl'ad off on a dial the mean of tlie times of the observations to hundredths or thousandths of a Sl·1m11d, thus avoiding the delay, labor, and error involved in reading cllronogmph-shcets. Suppose the number of observations in a set is n. Then, if t, is the time of the ith observat:on the mean time is-

I,et S, be double the trnmlwr of wl!ole sticmHls in

t,, aml lets, be the fraction
S-

of a second.

Then-

l 1 n 2, t, = n2, s, + J:,-;;.

The problem thus divides itself into two, to determine e:~ch term of the second member of this equation. This division of the problem constitutes the first esseutial character of the metho1l he1e to be described. If the observations occur at irregular and unkuowu intervals, the observer may separately note S, for each obsen·atiou, without any particular apparatus, and so calculate the first term. But if tlie observations occur at inten·als approximately known, the first term can be determined with less trouble. Suppose, for instance, that the observations, like transits of stars, are knowu to occur at mtervals nearly symn1etric1tl about the middle one. Then, if there exists any easy means of determining tl1e time of tllis one accurately to the one nth part of a second, this will be equal to the first term, provided the observations follow one another with 1;ufficie11t reg111l~rit.r. But if n be too great for this, or if it be a.11 even number, t,he observer may note, by any simple means, the times of the first autl last observations. These times need then only be noted to two ntlls of a second, and so for any larger numbers. A transit-observer may conveniently use seven wires, aud note the times over the second and sixth wires to a. quarter of a second. 'Vlleu n is gre<Lter~ a marking.watch may be conveniently used. In using this instrument, the obsen·ei· need not 1>ePk to distinguish the diti'erent obsen·ations of a set, as their order does not affe.et the mean value. I have now to describe the means uy which I wouhl determine the value of the second term-

Supposing that we have the me.tus of registering the sum of the fractions s,. Then to register, nstead, their mean, we may use one of the following methods: First, we may regulate the registering apparatm:i by a "regulateur Vilhtrceau." This ma._y be made t-0 run at any dt-i;irP<l rate within certain limits with grea.t ammracy; and it should !Je made to run at 011e nth of the rate required for the registry of the sum of' s,. 8ecou<l, we ma.y have a frict.ioual co1rnectio1_i bet~een two solids of revolution. Third, we may p0rform the required division by the gra.dua.twu ot the dial by ehangiug from one dial-face to another. But the sim1>le di\'ision of 2-'s by 1i is so ver_y easily performed that it would hardly be worth while h> make the necessary adjustment of ~he appa.ratus to put any of these methods into practice. I will, therefore, proceed at once to describe a contrivance for registering I1.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

We require for this purpose t,hree special pieces of apparatus be:sides the usual break-circuit chronometer. The first is a Hipp's chronoscopc. Only, it would generlllly be better to have an instrument on a si1Uilar pLin bnt registering hun1ln·11ths instea.d of thousandths of a secorul, and running for fini minutes at least. The essence of the instrument iR ft t1·ain of clock-work, rnmiing rapidly and regulari.v, and a dial with a h:m1l cnn11e1~t,e1! wit,h wheelR, which are thrown into gear witb the train when a certain gitlvauic circuit is ma1le (or broken), and which are thrown out and stopped when the dee nit i,; broken (or rna1le). 'l'hL~ secn11tl im;trunrnnt needml is au ob8erving-key, made something like a piano-forte key, with a metallic hammer, for making a very !'lhort galvanic couueetion. Tbe thinl instrument, is a peculiar relay, constructed as follows:

0 is a fixed axis, abont which turns a lever, A. B, which is provided with a vertical arm, 0 C. Upon this arm, there is a movable counterpoise, D, for raising or lowering the mass. On the arm A there is another weight, E, to adjust the ba.lanee of the lever. At the eml B there is a platinum point, which dip8 into a mei·curs-cup, the. Ii.eight of wl.Jich is adjustable by a screw. At F and G are armatures, arnl below each a small electro-magnet. The lever will turn to a limited extent, and is so bal:tuce(l that it will remain with either end dowu when it is thrown from one position to the other. Fonr batteries are now to be arranged in three connections, as follows:· 1st, Copper; mercury-cup ; chronoscope; zinc. 2d, Copper; electro-magnet G; key; zinc. 3 d f C?pper, first battery;} electro-magnetF· f chronometer; zinc, first battery. ' ( Zrnc, seeond battery ; ' ( eopper, second battery. Before the ob1-1en·a.tions begin, the A. em! of tlw t>ela.y will be down, and there will be no cnrrent through the cbronoscope, and the hands will be still. \Vben the key is tonehed, the eleetro magnet G is made effective, the Bend of the lever .goes down, the first eur1·ent is made, and the chronoscope-hand moves. This continues until the next chronometer-second, when the circnit through the first battery of the third oonnectiou is broken so that the soooud battery is no longer neutralized as it should have been at" first; th..., eleetro magnet F is ma.de, the Il end of the relay goes down, the circuit through the mercury-cup ii'! broken, and the cbrouoscope stops. By reading the dial of the chronoscope before and after the 80t of observations, we have the quantity-

The interference of the observer's signal with the chronometer-second may produce either of two effects: it will either add one second to the recorded sum or will cause the omission of one observation. Hitber effect is easily detected in the result. I have bad constructed a relay 6f the sort described above, only replacing the magnet F by an agate which cau be struck by a pend11lum for dett>rmining gra,Tity. In the COMt Survey Report for l870, 1)age 212, I have shown th~ ex:istenoo of a correction to the times as given by Hipp1 s chronoscope, owiug to the inertia and friction of the wheels connected with the hands, in consequence of which, as soon as they are gee.red in, the movement begins to be retarded and they move slower a111l slower during tbree.foartbs of a second. A.s tbe
· A still better arrangement would be to ba.ve a ma.ke-eireuit chr9oometer.

Here t tlenotes the time ands the reading of the cbronoscope. The exist.ence of this correction is also shown by attentively listening to the note of the reed, which is distinctly l.ieanl to be lowered when the hands arc geared in. It must be confessed, however, t,Jiat. the measure,d times of known intervals are not accounted for by this correction; for example, at Berlin, in 1 H7G, May 10 and 11, I experimented on the fall of a ball. Tb.e length of the seconds' pendulum at Berlin, according to Bessel, as stated by Bruhns, is orn.!)!142318. This i;;; for the level of the sea.; fo1· my point it is .99422:i. Tl!e reciµrocal of this, or 1.00581, is the squa.re of the time iu mean seco11il1' of the vihration of a 111etre·1lendulurn. The sqmtre root of' this, or l.00290, is the time itself. l\lnlti· plying by~~~ we get 1.00565, the time in sidereal secont,Jil. The square of this, or l.Oll:33, is then to be multiplied by

~ 2 or,

.10rn21 to get the velocity square in sidereal seconds after a fall of one

metre. This is .10:!469. If, therefore, the true squares by the chrouoscope of a fall tluough r. centimetres be divided by .Ol0246H, we get the square time by the chronoscope clividml by tlw sidereal seconds.

+ 50 cen. with the record of 1 second, we have 54.01 x Hence the difference of time is 0.6709 sidereal second. The difterence of the chronoscope results is 0.659, and the ratio is only .982. That there really is a retardation is certain both 1wiori and from the sound; and it is shown by the rates from the clock-seconds. But this can hardly account for the discrepancy between the measures with the clock and fall-apparatmi, for the last gh'en rate connecting the two is too small. I am inclined to think that tbere may be a correction of the fall-experiments, proportional to the momentum at impact, and, tlterefore, to the time. Experiments should be made with pendulums of different lengths. Tb.e relay aborn described, with the addition of a circuit-reverser, will render such experiments easy. Iu regard to the accuracy of Hipp's chronoscope, I may mention that the chronoscope-times given above for the falls are the means of ten observations eacb. It may, then, be calculated from tbe agreement of the resulting ratios iu the last column that the probable error of a single observation but slightly exceeds one thousandth of a second. In using the instrument for the automatic record of pendulum-transits, then, it will be quite sufficient to have ten observations in a set. This will give the intervals accurately to a thousandth of a second, or as accurately as the met.bod of coincidenc&"l. Let us now briefly consider the effect of the resistance of the lever shown in the plate upon the motion of the })endulum. Owing to the elasticity of tlle material, we may consider the impact to bt· instantaueouR and to produee a reduction of the velocity of t!Je pendulum in a fixed ratio. Let t be the variable time which is occupied by the pendulum in swinging from the vertical position to one haviug an angle, 9 , from the vertical; let v be the angular velocity at that instant; T, the period of oscillation; rJ!, the amplitude of oscillation; a, the ratio of the circumference to the diamIf we co1npare the time of falling .A.

TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.
INSTRUCTIO~S

FOR :MAGNETICAL OBSERVATIONS. RY CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSTSTANT IN THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

[Reprinted with additions from Appendix No. 14, Report of 1872.]

The measure of the magnetic force at any place on the earth's surface comprises the determination of its direction with reference to tbe planes of the meridian and of tile horizon and of the value of the intensity with reference to a fixed standard adopted as the unit of force. Observations of this kind are known as absolute measures, and are made with instruments specially designed for the purpose. The~· are the only ones here considered Some remarks will be made on relative measnres. For differential measures; usually made at permanent or fixed obsernttories, and employing instruments altogethn different in principle and constnrntion from those mentioned above, the reader may be referred to observ-a,tions made at Girard Collt>ge, Philadelphia, between 1840 and 1845, by Dr. A. D. Bache,· and at Ke:v West, Fla., between 1860 and 186li, by Prof. W. P. Trowbridge, assistant in the Coast Survey, and Mr. S. W:-tlker.t To the scientist, the measures of the direction and of the intensity are of equal importance; in fact, they me closely connected in theory. To the surveyor anti navigator, however, the horizontal direction or magnetic declination (variation of compass) is of special interest. Surveyors are frequently called upon to retrace old magnetic courses, which requires a knowledge of the present declination and of the law of secular change.t Navigators are constantly nmler the necessity of converting proposed true bearings into corresponding magnetic bearings, or vice versa. ·we shall here consider only those instruments and methods of observation designed for use on land, and which admit of far greater accuracy than any observations which can be made on board ships. Iu the latter case, moreover, the intensity observations' are not absolute, but relative to some shore station. We shall first exhibit the measure of tht~ two components of the direction, viz, the dooliuation (or the direction of a horizontal magnetic needle) aud the inclination or dip (or the direction ot' a vertical magnetic needle), and conclnue with the measure of the horizontal aud vertical eompo. nents of the total magnetic intensity.

1. DETERMINATION OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION.
The magnetic declination at any place, being the angle contained between the astronomica1 and magnetic meridians, requires for its measure two distinct 01>eratious, namely : The determination of the astronomical meridian, whiclt is generally done by means of a theodolite, and the determination of the magnetic meridian (at a given epoch) by means of the declinometer (or unifilar magnetometer). The former of these planes is fixed, the latter variable, and the observations may have for their object the determination of the declination at various hours of the <lay, or its mean value for any one day, month, or year. Res1lecting the determination of the astronomical meridian by means of observations of the azimuth of the sun or of a star, full information will be found in the paper ou " The Determination of' an Astronomical Azimuth," in Coast Survey Report for 1866, Appendix No. 11, pp. 86-99;§ the

example of observations and reduction gi-ven at tbe end of that paper is taken from a n·con1 made in connection with magnetic work. It may be stated tllat a determination of the meritlia11 whicu is correct withiu 1' fully sutlice8 fo1· magnetic work in general, since it is difficult to dl'terudue tlw magm·t-ic meridian within the same limit, on account of its continued fluctuations. "' t' shall 1;up. pose that the azimuth of some mark (au:'' com·enieut <lbtant ol~ject) is known, and that we han-' merely to find the magnetic azimuth of this mark in order to obtaiu the declination, which is gen emlly distinguisht>d hy a + sign if the magnetic meridian is west of the true north meridiau, and IJ3· a - sign it' east of it. Tbese signs apply to the northern as well as the southe.rn hemisphere. Adjustment of the dedinmneter.-A station uaving bee11 selected, :tpparently free from local magnetic attraction, the instrument is mounted with the sides of the box, co11 taining the magnet, directed nearly north and south (magnetic), which may lie COll\'e11iently done li.Y means of a pockt>tcompass; the iustrurnent must be leveled and the theodolite or telescope :uljusted.* In tliat form of coustruction of the instrume.rrt t whieli bas the magnet-hox mounted ovPr the azirnutlr.eircle, the obser\"er may face either the north or 80Utb eml of the magnet; but ill the more compll'te form of the magnetometer, with aUached tht>odolite, the obHerver would better fa~'.e the north 1>1Hl of the magnet, in order to admit more readily of obsnving the sun for time and azimuth (also for latitnde if 1wedecl). The change, if desired, can be made by exchanging the lens and plane-glass of tl1e collimator-magnet; but if the !'lame magnet is also used for the intensity-determiwttion, it must not be disturbed after the constants have onct: bt"en determined. The motion of the maguet is co11trcilled by the obt1erver by means of a small piece of mrignPtized ste«>l (a small screw-driver, for instance), its magnetism (at its free end) being the same a.;; tlmt of the end of the magnet facing the cllserYer, so as to re1wl it when brought near. It 111n;;t neither be too strong, nor be brought too close to the magnet, 0U1erwise the position of the ma.gnetic axit1 might be disturbed. The suspeusion-tnhe sliould carry at its top a rack and pinion to a.omit of an ea8y vertical movemut of the magnet. ·\'\'ith a piece of cloth at the bottom of th1· box, the magnet can be let down, and come to rest, by friction, on tlle fibl·rs of the cloth, autl car1 then be raiseo and quickly steadied by the magnetized screw-driver, all without openiug the box, which in windy weather must be avoided. The sides of the box, if of glass sliding in groove"', must have pasteboard covers to darken it, and the width of the slit facing the mirror mu;;t bu specially regulated for the best definition of tile scale; the suade placed over the oltiect-mul of tlrn telescope should nearly touch the box, in order that all stray light may be excluded. The spceial adjustments to lie made are Hie following: Sns1,e11d the torsion-cylinder, which is of the same weight precisely as the magnet., and take out the twist of the suspension-fibers, of wllicll thero should not be more than are absolntely U('t\tkd to suppor·t the weight without risk of breaking-say al>out 4 or 6 for the older he1wy nrng1wts, a11d 1 or 2 for the light ones. With the aid of the rack-motion and the friction ou the cloth, tlie whole turns of twist are readily taken out, and then the line of detorsion must be placed iu the magnetic meridian, in which position the axis of the torsion-weight must be parallel with the side of the box.t In packing, the suspension should be kept free of twist, 1:10 that at any new station 0111,y the small changes developed in the twist need attention. The weight slloulll be removed, the magnet suspended, and the telescope pointed nearly to the middle of its scale, or to the axis of the rnaguet. The axis of the collimator and the line of collimation of the telescope should tllen be, as nearly ns possible, in the same straight line. To render the scale distinct, the telescope must 1'e set to sidereal focus. The azimuth-circle is then read; the reading, when pointing to the rnark,9 nadng previously been recorded. The relative position of the theodolite and maguet is, of course, inrnrial>1e, both being supported by the same stnno. The scale-reading of the magnetic axis of the collimator is determined by readings witli scale erect and inverted, as shown in the following example:
·See annexed paper on "The Adjustment of the Portable Alt-azimuth Instrument." t Known as the Theodolite Magnetometer. t This proc888 may require repetition until the ob86rver is a.ssured that there is no torsion when the collimator· 111agnet is suspended. §The best position of the mark is in or near the horizon.

NoT.1t,.-lt is recommended to make these observations about the epoch of the day when the magnet is nearly stati<mary, between 7 and 8 a. m., from May to September, inclusive; in March, April, and Oc*<Jber about 8 a~ n1., and in January, Ftibruary, November, and Decem. her about 9, also about 1· p. m. in any month and in any part of North America.

·.rhe angular valuf' of a division of the scale is determined by successive pointings on the princi1>al divisions, and noting the corresponding readings of the azimuth-circle, and repeating the operation in the reverse order. With that form of the instrument which has the box of the magnet connected with the azimuth-circle, -the combination of the results will correct for cl1ange of declination during the measures, but a small correction for torsion may be needed ; for the other form of comitruction the magnet may be fastened in its normal position dnring the scale-measures. The nsnal value of a scale-division is between 1' and 3', and tenths may be estimated. It is only for those instruments which give primarily the amount of deflection, in the intensity-measures, expressed in scale-divisions, that an accurate determination of the scale-value is needed.

Resulting magnetic declination, June 15, 1871. ...... . We have, also, on this day the daily range 15'.1, and the turning hours about 7h 30m a. m., and ]h 05m p. m. Unless time be wanting it is customary to observe for declination, as abov.-, on th1ee, generally consecutive, days. The observer's attention should be specially directed to the frequent examination of the line of detorsio11, since every change in the temperature or moisture of the air is apt to develop twist, which, if not removed, will injure the accuracy of the observations.

MEMORANDUM ON THE ORDINARY ADJUSTMENTS OF THE THEODOLITE, OR POR'l'ABLE AL'l'AZIMUTH INS'.l'RUMENT, FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL ANGLES, AND FOR ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS.

The variomi operations for placing the parts of a thecdolite in proper coudition for observing in order to eliminate, as far as possible, sources of error arising from instrumental defects, may be briefly stated as follows: To adjust the levels.-After properly setting up the stand, clamping it, and mounting the instrument, adjust the most sensitive of the le,·els attached to it by bringing two of the foot-screws of the theodolite in line with the direction of the len>l, and, after Jernling, tnrn the azimuth-circle 180°, correct any defect, one-half by means of the foot-screws (always working them in opposite directions), the other half by means of the acljusting-screws of' the level; turn the circle back to tirst position and repeat the correction as before as often as may be necessary. If, during this opera· tion, we turn the circle once or twice at right angles to the former position, and make the bubble play in the middle by turning the third foot-screw of' the theodolite, there may be no need of using the graduation to effect the adjustment of the level, the turning of 1800 by estimation being sufficient to effect the purpose. ~f there is a second level attached to the circle at right angles to the former, it may be adjnsted like the first, or, more expeditiously, by p1aciug it in the same direction as the first (when in adjustment), and correcting any defect by its correcting·screw. Circular levels must be adjusted upon the same principles; they are, however, generally of inferior accuracy. To place tlte a.xi.~ of the azim1tth-mrcle vertical.-By means of the adjusted level we place the vertical axis in position by leveling the instrument with the two foot-screws parallel with the direction of the leveJ, and then turning the circle ooo, aud bringing the bubble again to the middle by turning the third foot-screw. The verticalit.y of the axis is tested by t.he steadiness of the bubble in the middle of the tube when the instrnment is slowly revolved in azimuth. To adjust the threads <>f the ttlesoope.-Place the threads in the focus of the eye-piece where their best definition is obtained, and test the position by pointing to a distant well-defined object to which the focus of the object-glass is adjusted for distinct vision; and if by moving the eye sidewise the object appears to wove off the thread or pointing in the same direction as ·the eye, the diaphragm must be slightly pushed in, and pulled out in the contrary case. If there a.re two threads intersecting in the middle of the field at right angles, the vertical thread may be set vertical by sighting a plumb-line suspended at a proper distance, or the vertical edge of a house may be used instead.

The whole diaphragm (after loosening its four screws) is to be turned around the optical axis to effect the coincidence. The precediug adjustment must not be disturbed. The horizontal threatl may also be tested by pointing to an object, aud then turuing the azimuth-circle, pre\·iously set h Jrizontal, when the object shonld remain bisected; it may also lJe effected by pointing on the seahorizon. To adjust the line of collimation of the telescope.-If the horizontal axis of the telescope admits of being reversed in its supports, a distant object is pointed to ; and if, after reversal of the axis in it~ V's, the pointing remain perfect, the line of collimation is at right angles to the axis; if not, half of the difference is to be corrected by the azimuth-screw and half 1Jy the two adjusting-screws of the diaphragm (its former adjustsments remaining undisturbed). If the axis does not admit of reversal in the V's, it must be reversed by reversal of the circle, using the graduation ; and if the second reading, after reversal, should differ from it a little more or less than 180°, the difference must be corrected as before, and the process is to be repeated until the readings, direct and reversed, differ by 1soo exactly. For greater accuracy, we may use a collimator instead of the distant object. In some instruments the telescopes are mounted ou one side instead of in the middle of the azimuthcircle; their collimation may be corrected by two distant marks separated exactly by twice the eccentricity of the axis of the telescope from the vertical axis of the theodolite. The process of adjustment is then the same as described, only changing the mark wit.h a change of the telescope from one side to the other. For oblique intersections of the threads, the point of intersection must be brought into the optical axis of the telescope, the adjustment for collimation being the same as described. In this case, a collimato1· with a vertical thread is nsecl to advantage. , To place the horizontal axis of the telescope in position.-This axis must be at right angles to that of the azimuth-circle, and if in position or horizontal the line of collimation, when revoking the telescope, must pass through the zenith of the observer. It is effected by placing an adjusted level ou the axis and correcting the whole error with the adjusting-screw of the pivot. If the level is :fixed or uncorrected, it must be adjusted at the same time with the axis by leveling and then turning the azimuth-circle 1soo, and correcting one-half of the defect by the pivot-screw aml the other half by the level-screw. The process also requires repetition for its perfection. The ia,strument is now ready for the measurement of horizontal angles, either by ''directions" or by "angles,'' with or without repetitions, according to the construction of the instrument or the requirements of the case. In either method one-half of the measures must of course be made with "circle direct," the other half with "circle reversed" by 180°, which process corrects the angles for any remaining defect, after adjustment in the verticality of the axis, in the height of the V's, in the form of the pivots, and in the collimation. If the telescope is placed eccentricall.r, this reYersal will at the same time refer the resulting measures to the axis of the circle, or, what should !Je the same, to the vertical of the station. In repeating angles it suffices to record the readings of the circle at the commencement and at the end of the operation, the telescope being reversed after half the number of repetitions are secured. During the reversal of the telescope the circles remain firmly clamped until after the new pointing is made. With non-repeaters, or when used as such, the records for telescope "D" and for telescope" R" are kept separate. The eccentricity of a circle is corrected by taking the mean of the readings of two opposite verniers or microscopes, or the mea.n of the readings of any number of verniers or microscopes, prodded they are so placed as to divide the whole circumference into equal parts. To adjust the level required for 'Vertical mea.mres.-The measures of vertical angles depend, among other things, on the accuracy of the adjustment of the level. It is effected by leveling aud reven;ing the azimuth-circle 1soo, using one of the level-screws for correction, provided the former adjustment of the vertical axis has not been disturbed. This level may either be attached to the azimuth-circle ol" to the arms carrying the verniers or microscopes of the altitude-circle; in the former position it is of course placed parallel to or in the plane of the altitude-circle. The instrument is now in the proper condition for tl1e measure of vertical angles. Generally, doub"le zenith-distance8 a.re measured, by means of which the reading of the zenith (or nadir) point 011 the circle becomes known, and consequently also the reading of the horizon. If there is any index-error, it may either be corrected (many in.-\trumeots admit of such a correction) or it may be

260

UEPOUT OF TEIE SUPERIN'l'ENDEXT OF

allowed for as a constant when single altitudes are measured. This index-error is of no consequence if donble zenith-distances are taken (involving positions, circle right and circle left). Owing to the grea.t dfrersit~' i11 the construction of theodolites, depemling upon the particular use and the degree of perfection required of them, rules cannot be given to apply alike to all constructions; but the preceding notes will suffice in all ordinary cases of the use of the portable instrument. To test the graduation, its eccentricity, systematic and irregular eITors; to adjust tlle reading-microscopes (for rnn and focus); to test the coincidence of the two horizontal axes, also of tile two vertical axeR, in repeating-instruments; to examine the perpentlicularity of tbe planes of the circles (graduation) to tlieir respecfrn~ axes; to measure tlie flexure of tho telescope, and other circumstances, will require the attention of the observer when engaged in the more refined geodetic or astronomical use of the alt-azimnth. 'l'he principle of repetition applies most advantageously when the optical power of the telescope exceeds relatively the accuracy of the graduation; in otl1er words, when the pointing-error is less tuau the graduation-error. Jf the optical power is inferior, or not commensnrate with the perfection of the graduation, we may still save time by using this method, the number of readings being less; or it may be utilized by gh'ing position to the instrument, to spread the readings over the graduation. Although the principle of repetition is an elegant one, in practice it bas been found freqnently to introduce a new source of error, namely, a constant or slowly variable error dependi 11g OD frictio11, the imperfection of the clamping, and general instability of the instrument. Unless tbe clamps are perfect, repeating will introduce a constant error, wbicb cannot be eliminated from the result by the forward and backward movement of one circle upon the other, and the observer should carefully test whethel' <JI" not bis pointing will he preserved when repeatedly clamping and unclamping; this especially applies to the clamps upon which tbe movement of the inner circle depends (for repeaters). The clamps sbonld never he at the circumference of the circle of' gratlua. tiou, but near tlrn axis, unless for inferior instruments. Before observing its general stability, the clamping apparatus should be examined as well as the proper amount of friction of the moving parts and the balancing of weights. Instruments with light spokes to their azimuth-circles (though they may otlierwise be higl1 or thick enough), and haviug a heavy superstructure (vertical circle and counterpoise), frequeutly show so much ilexure or spring as to affect injuriously all horizontal measures, while full thin plates are not liable to this defect. Azimuths iu connection with the magnetic declination, where an accuracy of a fraction of a minute suffices, may he obtained with a small alt-azimuth instrument (say of four or five inches diameter). Supposing the latitude given, but the time ouly approximately known, the sun's zenitbdistance and azimuth may be observed as follows: reading of mark, three readings of the sun's upper and fir.it limb, uoting the cJ1ronorneter-time at contacts; instrnment reversed, three readings of the sun's lower and second limb, reading of mark. I~et h = altitude, corrected for refraction, parallax (semi diameter and dip, if necessary), and p =the sun's or star's polar distance, th!'ntan2 .!. A= sin (s - sc) ;;in (s - h) 2 cos scos (·' - p) ' in which expression s = ~ ('f' + It+ p). If the time should also be desired, it may be compnted by

The following table will be roi:ind usefnl for correcting or reducing an observation of the declination taken at any time between 6 a. m. and 6 p. m. to the mean of the day (or to the mean of :!4 hourly observations). It is, however, only approximate, since the tabular values are slightly variable in the eleven-year or solar-spot cycle; moreover, they arc varying irregularly from day to day. For interpolation for any place in the United States we may consider that, roughly speaking, the greater the horizontal force the smaller the tabular values, or the range of the daily variation is inversely proportional to the horizontal force. \'Ve have the horizontal force H at Toronto 3.50, at Philadelphia·4.16, and at Key West 6.74, nearly. No notice is taken of the annual inequality, which may amount to about one minute and a half, in maximo.

2. DETERMINATION OF THE MAGNET IO INCLINATION. The inclination, or dip, is measured in the vertical plane passing thro11gh the magnetic meridian of the place, and is the angle contained between a horizontal direction and the direction of a magnetic"needle moving freely about a horizoutal axis directed east and west maguetically. It is measured by means of a dip circle, and is considered when the north end of the needle dips below the horizon. Thus in the north magnetic hemisphere the dip will he+ and in the south magnetic hemisphere -. In a plainly-oonstructed circle, the gl"a.dua.tion, which is directly read off at the ends of the

nt>edle is generally uot closer than quarter-degrees or ten minutes, and snl.Jdivisions are to be estimated.· In the more elaboratl\ instruments,+ as used at Kew, for instance, tbe needle tloes uot swing iu the plane of the graduated eir'clc, and the pointing at end marks on the needle is done by the aid of two microscope8, with threads iu tlie focm;;, and the circle is read off to the nearest minute or half-minute hy m·\ans of two verniers. ·rhe latter construction is advantageous only with we11-balanced nee<lles, uaviug as perfectly cs liuclrical axles as c:rn be made. To place the dip-circle in the plane of the magnetic meridian, we haxe two ways, either by the aid of an ordinary long compass-needle, which is supported between the agate plates, or by means of the dipping-needle, which will point vertically in tbe plane of the magnetic 11rime vertical. Tbe former method is more expeditious; the latter c:rn al wa;vs be resorted to, and consists in four readiugs of the azimuth-circle of the instrument when placed snccessi.vely in the position: face of circle south (maguetic), with face of ueeclle south and face of needle north; next, face of circle north, with face of needle north and face of needle south; the mean reading+ 90° and - !JOO will . gh:--e tl1e set.ti11g8 of the circle for the measure of the dip. A more precise value will be found if tb~ process is repeated, with the polarlty of the needle reverserl. In adjnsting the dip-circle preparatory to observing, the following conditions sho·uld be attended to, and the obserYations shculd be arranged so as to eliminate any small outstanding defects in the perfect condition of the instn;ment; the instrument must remain level when turned ahout a vertical axis; the agat1c~ or steel plates supporting the needle should have their' upper snrfaees levd, sbould be of equal height, and a horizontal tangent-plane sboulu pass below the center orgratluation of the circle at a tliE>tance equal to the radius of the axle of the needle. The zero graduation of the circle should lie in a horizontal pl;rnf\; also the phtne of the suspencled needle and that of the circle should be truly vertical; and, fiually, the prolongation of the axle of the needle should pa:ss through the ceuter of graduation. For instruments provided with microscopes, the following additional conditions should be satisfied: The microscopes must be focused and col· limatetl; their threads should be 1soo apart, and if pr0<luced should pass through the cenkr of graduation. The needles, before magnetization, should balance perfectly, and those intended for the relative measure of total intensity, according to Dr. Lloyd's method, should be guarded as mucl1 as possible against any change in their magnetism. Reversal of poles of dipping-needl.es.-The needles which are exclmiively used for the measure of the inclination should have their poles reversed at each place of observation, and the results with polarity north and volarity south must be combined to a mean value. If exceptionally the polarity should not have been reversed at a station, the difference in resulb3 between polarity north and south, as found at stations which have nearly the same dip~ may be applied as a correctiou. To reverse the polarity, we may proceed as follows: fasten the needle in the reversing-block, and, holding a har-maguet in each band, bring the opposite poles of the two bar-magnets close togeth~r at the middle of the needle so as to touch the same on both sides of the axle; the needle is supposed to be on a level plane, and the bars are to be inclined outward about 450 to the horizon. They are then drawn slowly and steadily over the needlt>, carrying them over its ends, aud, after lifting them some inches above the level of the needle, bring them back to the middle position and move them again over the surface. This process may be gone through three times, when the upper face of the nt>edle is turned down, in which position the magnetization is repeated as before. Oare should be taken to have the motion exactly in the direction of -i;be geometrical axis of the needle ; the magnetizing-block usually has a ledge, along which the magnet can be drawn, closely touching it, which will inRure a movement parallel to the axis of the magnetic needle. If its north end is to be changed to a south end, I)lace the north (or marked) end over that en<l (If the needle when magnetizing. The polarity as well"'as the face may be designated by means of the number or letter usually cut on the end (If the needle. The reversing-bars shonld be carefully handled, and should not be allowed to touch each other except at opposite poles, and when placed in the box their ends of opposite polarity should be connected by a soft.iron armature. If the reversal of the . n1>edle is to be repeated a short time after the operation, the method is only changed by using four

instead of three passes over each face of tbe needle; if another reversal is needed shortly after, five passes would be required. This is done in order fint to neutralize the existing magnetic polarity, and then to give it the opposite polarity desired; if, howen'r, one or more days have elapsed between a reversal, enough of magnetism is lost to render any increased m1 m ber of passe:s unnecessary. Their imm ber depends primarily on the strengt!J of the ha rs and the re la ti Ye size of the bars and needles. Should the bars ha>e too much int(·usity aud the needles be long, an irregular distribution of magnetism might bo produced. Should the bars lie of unequal inteusity, it is recommended to exchange them in the harnfa, after peifunniug one half of tht· 01wratiu11 of reversal, turning them at the same time end for end, and completing 1lie op1:Tation in the uew position. When not in use and when obsening· for dip, the bar-magneto-; should not be kept 11Parer to tba.-Observer than about ten meters; I.mt when ohserviug for df'clination they should he kept at a greater distance. The following example of a record of ordiuarj observations of the dip -will sufficientl:r show the general arrangement. The readings in tlrn secoud liue are imlepm1dent of those of the :first, and between them the needle has alway8 been lifted off its supports. If tlie position of tl1e nt'C'tlle is recorded while slowly oscillatiug, it is customary to record tl1e lt>ft atJd rigl1t extreme excun·ious, and, in order to correct for diminution of arc, tLe mt>an of the readiug of the first extreme aud of its next return to it should be taken before comltini11g 'With tbt> reading of the opposite extreme. In this case, the meau for the first extreme positions ma.v lie taken ment.ally, and the second extreme is recorded under it; theu follow two more snch re<!diugR after the needle has been lifted off and let down again on tbe agate supports. It is recommended to observe the needle while slowly oscillating in preference to no:ing iti-: position at rest~ in which case the eq uilibriurn may l>e i11fitH'ucerl IJ_y ally small irregularity in the axle at the point of contact, wLich woul(l be passed over by an o>-;cillating motion. Defects in the figure of the axle may als-0 be recognized by irregularities in the motion of t!Je needle. The introduction of position needles ha\'ing a movable axle, whieh may Le tunietl by means of a key to different positions with a view of eliminating small <letect:s iu the figure of the axle, ha::;, so far, not proved as satisfactory as was anticipatetl, owiug to tile t1ifticult.\- of JH='rfectly figuring tile axle and centering the movable arbor; if suCJ!.1 needles are used their polarity, after the first ::;et of observations, must be reversed, and the ouservations be couclude<l before tnruiug to a. uew position.

For the purpose of testing the regularity of the :figure of the axle of the noodle and the freedom of the metal of the circle from any magnetism, we may observe dips in various azimuths; if o.. observed dip in magnetic azimuth a, then the true inclination is found bytau 8 =tan e. cos a The values of a may be successively changed by intervals of about 100.

We may also obtain the true inclination, wit110ut the knowledge of tbe magnetic meridian, by observing the dip in any two >ertical planes at right angles to each other, and find the inclination by the formulacot2 O = cot2

o, + cot2 On

But the best method would seem to be that of .Mayer (proposed in 1814), which is peculiarly fitted for eliminating the eftect of an irregularity in the figure of the 1frrnts, since the dip can be found on almost any part of the circumference of the axle. This metl1oll cousists in loading the needle (near its axis), and tbus changiug· its din'ction. The new· position is conditioned by the equilibrium of the magnetic force and that of gra\·ity. The tilt may amount to 900 or more; aud should the needle be deflected into the adjacent _quadrant, the algebraic sign of the obl!erved dip changes, and must be attended to. For want of a better contriyauce, a drop of sealing-wax may be applied to the side of the needle near its axle, arnl observations may be made with the needle variously deflected lJy chauging its 11uantity, or by letting it act at a different leverage. The ordinary rules for observing dip are adbered to, !Jut special care must be taken that the weight be not changed iu position in the :wt of reversiug t!Je polarity. This method of reduction may also be followed if ordinary needles differ as much as 30 or 40 in any of their separate results, dne to change of face or polarity.

The record, as given in the following example to this method, shows that the dip was noted while the needle was oscillating, and that between the second and third horizontal lines the needle was lifted off the agates and let down again.

3. ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MEASURES OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE.

269

It is usual, wl1en accurate results are desired, to measure the lwrizo11tal component of tbe magnetic force by mea11s of a portable magnetometer, and tlrn dip by means of a dip-circle, and to derive the total force by combining these. In high nrngnetic latitude!", wliere the horizontal component is feeble in comparison with the Vt>Ttical component, Lloyd's statical nwthod is to be preferred. To measure the horizontal force, two distinct operations are requfred, known as "Observations of Deflections r. and ''Observations of Oscillations." Their combination will enable us to separate, in the observed force, that part which is due to the magnetism of the magnet from that which is due to the earth's magnetism. Either of these operations, but especially the latter, will determine relative horizontal _intensity, and, when used in connection with a base-station where the magnetic force is known, absolute results will also be obtained. In this case the observer should return to the base-station after the completion of his magnetic sur>ey, and again measure the magnetism of his magnet, which, in the interval, must be carefully guarded against changes, and the results must be corrected, if necessary, for loss of magnetism. The magnetomet,er.-There are two forms of unifilar magnetometers in use: those with a complete astronomical theodolite, or alt-azimuth, mounted to the magnetic north or south of· the box: in which the collimator-magnet is suspended, and on the same stand with it; and those which have the box: with suspended magnet mounted centrally o-.;-er, and firmly connected with, an azimuthcircle, the reading-telescope being mounted ecceutrically on supports. The first form (supposed to have been devised by Gauss) is the preferable one in field use; it admits of greater expedition, allows of great-er ease in observing, and is almost indispensable when the astronomical meridian has to be determined. With the magnet to the south of the theodolite, it readily admits of observatious of the 1mn, for the determination of time and azimuth (also of latitude, if required) without interfering with the magnetic work proper. Deflections are read off on the scale of the collimator· magnet, and must be converted into angular measures. The secontl form· (supposed to have been given by Dr. Lamont) is capable, perhaps, of greater accuracy, aud is better suited for a fixed observatory, especially when declination disturbances also are to be observed, or at stations where there is a large daily range in the declination. The angles of deflection are at once read off. In order to observe the azimuth-mark, the magnet and box: have temporarily to be removed, which is unnecessary in the first form of the instrument. \)\.'hen observing deflections, the bar, and consequently the deflecting magnet, remain fixed in the magnetic prime vertical, in the magnetometer, with attached theodolite; but in the second form of the instrument the deflecting and deflected magnets always remain at right angles to each other.t Improvements have been made at the Coast Survey Office in the construction of magnetometers, with a special view of making them more portable than the older instruments, which were found unnecessarily large and heavy. In 1871, a three-inch Oasella theodolite was utilized for this purpose. The magnet (3 inches long and i inch in diameter) and light box, with glass tube, were first attached to the upper frame of the theodolite; afterward to its stand, by which greater steadiness was secured. The relati\7e horizontal intensity only could be measured by means of oscillations. In October, 1874, a similar instrument was fitted up with 2 magnets, inertia-ring, and deflecting bar for absolute measure, the magnets being ouly about 1~ and 1~ inches in length. In the present year several instruments were constructed with 4-incb theodolites and magnets, 1.50 and l.S4 inches in length, respectively; diameter, 0.3 inch. One of these instruments is presented in the accompanying plate. The upper part of the theodolite can be removed and the magnet-box: placed on its azimuth.circle. The operation for either construction of the instrument is t'ltlsentially the same, and the simple modifications necessary in using one or the other form in observing and computing will be specially noterl under the appropriate beads of the work. When observing for time and for duration of oscillations, a. mean-time box-chronometer is most convenient for use; the observer will himself !take up the beat (halfsecond) and estimate fractions of seconds. For a. traveler, who dislikes to be much incumbered, a pocket-chronometer is much to be preferred, but the counting of the beats, generally five in two

seconds, requires some previous practice. It is recommended to take up an even beat-say at o, 10, 20, 30, &c., seconds-and count only the even beats, repeating the letters ab c din the intervals; thus, 10 ab c d, 12 a b c d, 14 a, &c. The letters are afterward converted into their equivalents of time; thus, 14 a would be 15".2. Obseri,ations of defiections.-The instrument being adjusted as for observations of declination, attach the deflecting bar, suspend the shorter of' the two magnets generally supplied for each instrument; the line of detorsion having been placed in the magnetic meridian, insert the copper damper, raise tbe suspended maguet to the horizontal level of the deflecting (or long) magnet, put the carrier at the proper distance on the bar, and, after placing the intensity (or long) magnet· centrally on it, commence making the observations as indicated in the following scheme:

The preceding forms are arranged for determining the angle of deflection (u) by wbicb)be intensity-magnet, acting at a given distance, r (expressed in feet), deflects the suspended maguet from the magnetic meridian, and for determining the ratio of the magnetic force (m) of the deflecting magnet to that of' the earth's horizontal component (H). For the case of the deflector remaining in the magnetic prime vertical, we have, with sufficient precision-

The first form requires the torsion of the suspension to be measured and to be corrected for;; in the second form, no twist is developed. The co-efficient P, depending upon the distribution of magnetism within the defiecting magnet, must be ascertained experimentally by means of deflections at two or three distanees, and at least twenty-five independent measures should be made for its numerical value; it will generally be found to have a negative sign, provided the magnets bave their proper proportions of' length, viz : short magnet to long magnet, as 1 to 1.22±.

The cm-efficient Q, depending on the fourth power of r, may be neglected. The two distances rand r 1 (to be measured from the middle of the magnets) may be iu the ratio of 1 to ,/?,nearly, but not to exceed 1 to 3; or, for convenience, the second distance may be one-half greater than the first, but the shorter distance should not be Jess than about four times the length of the deflecting magnet. The correction for induction in Form 2 may be neglected in all cases where extreme accuracy is not required. In observing with the magnetometer and attached theodolite, we may eave time by noting tLte two extreme scale-readings of an oscillation, instead of waiting for the magnet to come to rest; and, in Form 2, we can also reduce the time of observation by setting the azimuth-circle beforehand nearly to the reading corresponding to the particular position of the magnet, and afterward perfect,ing the pointing on the middle division by the azimuth-screw. The scale of the defiecti.11g bart should be examined for graduation and eccentricity error,., and corrected for them if necessary. When using a magnetometer with theodolite, the angular value of the scale of the deflected magnet must be ascertained with great precision, and, in general, special attention is to be paid to the temperature of the intensity-magnet, which must be the same, or be reduced to the same, temperature during the observations of deflections and oscillations. These two operations should, therefore, al ways immediately follow each other. Obser.vations of oscillations.-The instrument being adjusted, and the intensity (long) magnet f suspended without twist, with scale horizontal, and the copper damper removed, the observer will arrange his scheme for observing tbe duration of a certain number of oscillations, from which the time of one oscillation is to be deduced. The~bulb of tbe thermometer to indi<>.ate the temperature of the magnet is put inside the box, the stem projecting :outside. The mean-time chronometer,§ whose rate mast be known, is placed at a safe distance below the telescope, allowing, however, the observer to take up the time without changing his place. With the ma.gnet at rest, the vertical thread of the telescope should point nearly to the reading on the scale of the magnetic axis, or to the center divisiou. Oare must be taken that the magnet have no up and down vibrations ; a horizontal motion is then given to it by means of a small magnetized piece of steel, sufficient to make it oscillate for about twenty or twenty-five minutes before coming to rest. The oscillations are counted as follows: Suppose the center division of the scale to pass from apparent right to left, call its first transit over the line of collimation of the telescope 0 1 and note the time (the minute having previously been noted, the sooond iis added without taking the eye off the telescope); its next transit will be from left to right and is called 1, the next following one from right to left is called 2, and so on until the tenth transit is observed, when the time

·For greater aeeuraey, the values of A and A1 require also to be correeted for effect of induction in that form of instruments giving the drflevtio11-angle directly. See" On Induction," Collllt Survey Bepart of 1869, Appendix: No, 9. t A wooden bar 'is preferable to one of brall8, 011 account of its grea.ter llghtn- and. lllll8 variability in length with change of temperature. i Thia magnet generally serves also for obeervationa of declination. ~If sidereal, we simply consider it as a mean-time chronometer with a large rate, and correct for it accordingly.

is again noted, for which purpose the beat of the chronometer bas t-0 be taken up in the usual manner. The duration of ten oscillations being thus approximately known, the intervals aud whole number of oscillations t-0 be observed can be properly arranged. With the light maguets now in use, two fibers, and for those used in connection with three-inch Casella theodolites, e\~eu ~1 siugle fiber suffices for the suspension. The !Jest arraugement yet ue\·isetl for ordinarily ouserYing oscillations is the following: Begin with apparent motion of the maguet, Ray, from right to left, and note the times of, say, three transits; then take an equal number from left to right, to be followed, after an interval of a few minutes (of rest to the observer), in order to get the duration for, say, one hundred oscillations, by a similar set of' transits from right to left; and conclude finally with an equal imrnber of transits from left to right. It will be noticed that for even numbers of oscillations the apparent motion is from right to left, for odd numbers the reverse. We thus provide experimentally for any effect of a change in the declination during the observations, the final mean duration of one oscillation being unaffected by any such change. It is adviHable not to extend the entire time consumed in a set of obsen'ations beyoncl a quarter of an hour, and to make the inte1·val between any tw-0 consecutive observations (the magnet swinging in the same direction) hetween one-third and two-thirds of a minute. '1-'his giYes ample tirne to take up the beat of' the cluonorneter, which is clone, say, ten seconds before the expected time of transit, and to await it deliberately. The arrangement for a particular case is shown in the form given below; here the three inten·als (rough ones only) of 39·, 4B 0 , and 3m 12· are known beforehand, and must be mentally aclded to the observed time in order to be prepared for the next following transits. "''ith the time of ~"transit only roughly known, the observer will not be biased in his estimation of the obser»ed fraction of a second. For each particular magnet, depending mainly on its mass an.d magnetic intensity, a special scheme must be devised, guided by the principles as explained above; but the same scheme may be adhered to for a number of stations, unless the survey extends over a space within the limits of which the earth's horizontal force has widely different values. Special attentiou is to ue paid to the correct noting of the temperature, and the observations must be accompanied l>y measures of the torsion. The correction for induction may be omitted except when great accuracy is demanded; it arises from the fact of the magnet having greater force, by inunction, wheu sus pendecl in the magnetic meridian, than in the position at right angles to it (as in ucflections). On the subject of induction, see Coast Survey H.eport of 18(j£1, Appendix No. 9.

Let H = the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic force; m =the magnetic mome11t of the intensity-magnet; K = its moment of inertia (inclusive of stirrup and balancing-ring,t if any); T =the time of one osDillation: then, from observations of oscillations, we have the expres11ion for the productwhere "'
duct

= 3.14159

The observations of deflections give the ratio ~ and the observations of oscillations the proni

H; m and H cau therefore be eliminated from the two equations, as shown in the prcced-

i ng example.

To determine K, a truly-turned brass or bronze ring of known dimensions a11d weight (about equal to that of the magnet) is placed on the magnet. It is correctly ceutered by means of two centering-blocks, and when suspended must remain in a horizontal plane. The number of suspension-fibers must be doubled for the purpose. In this position a set of oscillations is obsen'ed similar in arrangement to that already explained; anrl if T 1 be the time of one oseillatiou of the loaded magnet, and K 1 the moment of inertia of the i·ing, thcnK =
K1

(1\ 2 ~T2 )

A series of not less than tweh-e sets of obsen'ations of oscillations, with the magnet alternately nn loaded and loaded, is to be made, eacl1 set duly corrected for torsion, rate of chronometer, and difterence of temperature, from which the value of K is deduced. These results are tD be combined with a view of eliminating the effect of' changes in H during tl1e ohser"ations; thus the mean of sets 1 and 3 is used with set 2, the mean of 3 and 5 with 41 &c., the firi:t and last setR being alike either with magnet unloaded or loaded. As the torsion changes with the weight, observations for torsion must also be made with the loaded magnet. To find K1 let r and r1 represent the inner and outer radii, expressed in decimals of a foot, and w the weight of the ring iu grains, thenK1 = 2- (r 2 + r 12 ) 1c The values of log rr2 K for different temperatures should be tabulated. It suffices to assume tbe ordinary co-efficient of expansion for brass (0.000010).
t'fhis small bala.ueing-ring_ most remain in the same position ns in the observations for intens!t.y; lmt itR use should be avoided, if nt all po88ible.

REPOR'f OF THE SUPEJtlN'l'ENDENT OF

The reduction of the time of an oscillation to au infinitesimal arc is generally so small as not to affect the magnetic results. If a and a' express the initial and terminal semi-arcs of au oscillation (in parts of the radius), then the corrected value for T 2 will be( 1 - n a/)2T2
16

This correction can be avoided by swinging only through small arcs. To reduce the measures of deflections and oscillations to the same temperature, let t = the temperature of the magnet when deflecting; t 1 =its temperature when oscillating; q = the change in magnetic moment of magnet for a cbange in temperature of 10 Fahrenheit, then the co-efficient to be applied to T 2 is equal to 1 - (t' - t) q, as shown in the example. The "alue of q is not constant, but, for a moderate range of temperature, may be taken as constant; it must be obtaine<l experimentally, either from oscillations or from deflections, at various temperatures, hnt tile magnet should not be subjected to a greater range of temperature than from about 320 to 1000 Fahrenheit. These observations must be comlucted by tlie alternate use of a .iacket of ice and of bot water, or by the aid of extreme natural temperatures; ample time must, however, be given to the magnet to establish again an equilibrium in its magnetism; all rapid changes from cold to hot (or vfre versa), will give decidedly erroneous values for q. Supposing not less that three consecutive series of obsenatious of deflections for finding a value of q, and the first and third series to be at nearly the same temperature, with their results combined to a mean, and the second or intermediate series at a gre,atly different temperature, then q ma;y be found, with sufficient precision, by the expressiona ncot u l/= t--to where a= the arc value of one division of the scale of the suspended magnet iu terms of the radius; n = the difference of scale-readings corresponding to the difference of temperature t - t 0 ; and u = angle of deflection at the lower temperature t 0 · In every case the arrangement nrnst be such as to eliminate, as far as possible, any effects of changes in declination and intensity during the observations. If other instruments are available, it is best to correct the readings for observed changes in declination and intensity.

If it is clesirahlc to check tlie. preceding result, we can also ti ml the value of q from three or more consecutive series of oscillations (always combined in accordance with the principle o~limi nating changes in intensity) at different temperatures.

CONCLUDING REMARKs.-The degree of accuracy attainable in the magnetic measures ca.n only be estimated, chiefly on account of the almost incessant changes in the action of terrestrial magnetism. With well-constructed instruments, such as have been supposed in this article, and with fair observations, the resulting declination for any one day may, in our magnetic latitudes, be affected with no greater probable uncertainty tbau about ::!:: 1' to :1::3', and correspondingly less if the observations extend over more than one day. The dip may be affected with a probable uncertainty between ::!:: 1' and ::!:: 5', according to the perfection of the needles and the number of observations made; and the horizontal intensity, in general, may become known witbi11 about its 4 Ao part from any one day's observations. To find the effect on the total force, we have the relation-

APPENDIX No. 17.
METIIOD OF CLOSING A CIRCUIT OF TIHANGULATION UNDER CEHTAIN GJVEN CONDITION!:l, BY CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANT, AND M. H. DOOLITTLE, UNITED STATES COAST SlJHYEY.

It has beeu deemed desirable to preface this paper by some general and explanatory remarks on the adjustment of triangulations by application of the method of least squares. First, with respect to directions or angles measured at any station. Such measures will cxhiliit small discrepancies, which are caused by the unavoidable imperfections of measure. They are indicated by the want of identity in the value of any angular space resulting from the difference of it;; two directions when deduced in more than one way from difierent combinations or series of measures.· If angles are measured directly by means of repe<iting-instruments (now only used in subordinate triangulations), we find discrepancies in the sum of two or more angles given separately when compared_ with the whole space measured.+ To this kind of comlitions also !Jelongs tllat of
·;~or method of treatment and example, see Coast Survey lfoport for 11'E>·1, Appendix No. :~:i, pp. 71to7G, Art. A; and for the uctermination of tbe probable error of a resulting dirnetion, Coast Snrvey Report for 1004, Ar·peu<lix No. 14, pp. 120 to 124, Art. 3. t For treatment and example, see Report for 1854, Appemlix No. 3.1, pp. 76 to 7!J, Art.. 13; and the briefor method with tho aid of correlations, in the Report for ltl6tl, Appendix No. 8, pp. 141, 142. 'fhe t>roballlc error of each anf(le is deduced in the nsual way; but, as triangulations aro now generally adjusted " by directions,. and uot "by angles," we require to know tho probable error aml weight of ea.ch direction. Tho process given in the l~eport for 18G4, l'P· 124, 125, Art. 4, bas been superseded, since 1868, by the simpler one of trt>A'lting an angle as the rlitfercnce of two directions; and since no example ha.s yet been given, the following one will suffice to indicate the process. Suppose but t\\'O angles measured, and each individual measure to consist of an equal nnmher of repetitio11s, "'" subtract tho mean (or resulting angle from adjustment, IM! the CIM!e may be) from each measure, antl arrange as fol lows:

closing the horizon, or the requirement that the whole measured angular space around the station equal 36o:i. Existing conditions of this kind, either among directions or angles at a station, may be termed" local comlitions ;" and the equations established for dispersing the errors ma,y be termed "local equations/' A second source of discrepancies is found iu the fact that certain geometrical conditions existing in the fignre of the triangulation remain unsatistied. Thus, the sum of the ang"ies in each triangle must equal two right angles plus the spherical excess. Also, all directions intended to radiate from or to converge to certain stations must really do so. The former conditions give rise to what h:we been called angle equations; tlle latter, to side equations. If both kinds of conditions are satisfied we shall find the same length and direction for any side, no matter through what seri~s of triangles it may be computed. These equations are, in a measure, exchangeable; thus, in the adjustment of a quadrilateral, for which fom· conditions are necessary, we may employ in the process three angle and one side equation, or two angle and two side equations, or one angle and three side equations; but all four equations cannot Le of the same kind. Tllese geornetrical conditions may be called "internal conditions" of a trhmgnlation.* Theoretically, the local and internal conditio11s should be satisfied together; lmt practicaily the number of equations is, in nearly all cases, so gi·eat that they must be solved separately. The internal conditions, especially, rise rapid.I;)· to an unmanageable number, when primary series or chains of tria11gulation ha>e an extent of several hundred miles. A third kind of errors, to which the title of this article specially refers, involVes those external conditions which, for instance, req nirc a secondary triangulation to jit exactly in the space left for it by a primary triangulation, or those conditions for any tria,ngulation forming a circuit and returning into itself, which are needed for idenUty of posU·ion of the starting and terminating Hues. These conditions have been termed "extemal conditions;" au<l these demand now our special attuntion. Thuy exist in all cases when a triangulation forms a circuit or returns into itself, and

incloses au area bounded by a spherical polygon; also in cases where a giverr triangulation joins two others, relatitely .fi:x:ed; also, when a given tri~ngulation is required to terminate on a giYeu line or at a girnn station, fixed (say astronomically) in position. In general, a point on the earth's surface, iu order to be fixed, requires the knO\dedge of two co-ordinates. Hence a gh·en line, to lie determined in length and position, will require four data. In any single circuit, the number of "external conditions" therefore cannot exceed four. To fix: our ideas, we may refer to the case of triangulation presented in the surTey which, starting from Cape Henlopen, proceeds up the Dela.ware Bay to near the head of Chesapeake Bay, arnl thence down its whole extent to Cape Charles, from which a tertiary triangulation skirts the sea-coast, and finally re.enters at Cape Henlopen.· The distance through the axis of the principal triangulation from Cape Henlopen to tl1e head of Chesapeake Bay and down to Cape Uhal'les is 283 statute miles, and the distauce between the capes connected by subordinate triangulation is l'.!7 statute miles. Tue whole circuit, therefore, extends o\·er 410 miles. Iu this case, the errors must be di,;· persecl over the subordinate work only, the principal triangulation being relath·ely perfeet. The geodetic position of the line Cape Charles to l'Jast Smith is fixed by the principal triaugulatioD, and after eomputing successively the latitudes and longitudes of the trigonometrical points along tll,j sea-coast, tbe geodetic position of tile line Cape Ilenlopen to Lewes Entrance is reached, and the condition to be satisfied is to make the position of this line i1le11tical with that, assigned to it in the principal triangulation of Delaware Bay. The four co11ditionR to lm :satisfied for clo:sing a circuit may l.Je rE1presented h,Y the follo\\·iug equations: (1) The length e11natio11, which sec1ireH the reproduction of the original len.qth of the jnnction line, after c0tnputi11g through the circuit; (~)the aztrnutb equation, which secures the identity in direction of the line; (3) the latitude equation aud (4) the lougituue equation, whid1 secure the identity in geographical position of one terminal point of the junction line, and eonst·quently, by preYious conditions, also of the oqier terminal point, and hence of the whole line. The equations (1) aud (2) have been frequently employed, especially (.1), whicl1 enters whAnHer two or more base-lines have to be brought into accord, and is referred to in the Heport for 1854 (p. *81 ).t Equation (2J, which comes into use when azimuths are to be adjusted, is folly explained and illustrated by an example in the 1-teport for 1868, Appendix .N'o. 8, pp. HO to 14:3. lu all cases where e:xtrenie accuracy is uot 11eeded, and after equations (1) a.nd ('.?) llave bean satisfied, together with all the "internal" conditions of a re-entering triangulation, it is quite sufficieut, espeeiall,,· when the outstanding differences in latitude and longitude or constant,s of' equations (3) and (4) are small, to make simply a proportional distribution of these respective discrepanci{1s; tliat, in latitude a&cordiug to the longitudes of the intervening points, and that in lougitudeaccor<ling to the latitudes of the intervening points, or it ma~· lie done as in the case referred to in the li.eport for 1868. \\'hen such an approximate process is not admissible, the four external equations must be treated together with the internal equations.

Doolittlt>, together with his methods of facilitating the joint solution of all the equations, is as follows: "The latitudes and longitudes of the points l, 2, and 8 6 are supposed to be estalJlished; and those of the internwdiate points to require adjustment, the computed position of 8 differing from the established position. "The corrections in latitude and longitude required to be made to the computed position of the terminal l'ltation may lie regarded as functions of appropriate corrections 8 to the logarithms of the lengths and to the azimuths of the portions of a broken line connecting the terminal .z point '"ith the initial basP. These corrections to the logarithms of lengths and to the azimuths are functions of corrections to olJserved directions.

OBSERVATIONS ON CERTAIN HARBOR AND RIYET~ IMPRO\-EMENTS COLLECTED ON A VOYAGE YIW:\1 IIONG-KO"NG, YlA SEEZ, TO KEW YORK, BY GEORGE DAYIUSON, ASSISTANT 1.:\ THE CNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

:N"OTE.

The following papeL' re;rnlted iucideutally from the assigumeut of Prof. George DaYidson, assistant in the United States Coast Sun·ey, as chief astronomer of the part.r sent by our Goyernmeut to obserrn the transit of Venus in December, 1874, at a station in Japan. V\'ith the sanction of the Secretary of the Treasnry and by his own consent, :i\[r. Da,·idson, in returning home, i1assed along the coasts of Asia and Europe, and examined iucidentally the chi!:'f' public works on the routr, such more particularl.1 a:; bad been devised for promoting the interests of agriculture, or to further the purposes of commerce a!ld navigation. His observations on some of the great structures for land reclamation a!l(.1 fer irrigation ha,,-e lJeen printed by order of the United States Scnatt>. The notes on harbor allll rin·r imp1·0,-ement which here follow were reconlec1 during the SfUne iwriml, in conformity with the following items in tlle instructions which issued from the Coast Survey Office, addressed to l'rofcssor Davidson, iu JnlJ, 1874-: ''..c\..s the construction of lJrcakwatcrs on the westrrn coast of the United States is of growing importance while commerce i11crPases, yon will examine such works of that class as you can couveniently visit on your jonme;r, and obtain such personal information and uewl:y-publii<hed facts as may have beari11g in the descriptions for prnspectin· works of the kind. ''Examine the hydraulic conditions of the Sue;r, Canal, especially at the Mediterranean end; note what changes, if any, haYe taken place, aud the causes of change: also collect information in regarcl to littoral tlrift along the coast, and i11qnire particularly in reference to the progress of material accumulating on the west side of the great pier of Port Said.'' In the Uuitet1 States practical interest, especial!.'· in wl1at relates to facilities for commerce in transit from place to place and concerning the impron~rneut and preservation of harbors and ri\·ers, cannot lessen. The review on that subject, which follows, is tlwrefore teuclered in the belief that it is well to hiwe the means for comparing our own couditiou ou similar 1ine15 of al1nu1cement with the expedients fouud necessary, aud which have been brought iuto requisition, in older nationalitief'. C. P. P ATTERSO:N, Superintendent United States Coast Sui-roy.

On certain J1arbor and rit'er improroncnts in China, Em;pt, lfoly, Holland, and Great Britain.
The drawbacks are such in foreign ports that travelers journe_ying aronntl the world will liar<lly timJ, aftel' leaving the United Statei<, a harbor where the ocl·an-steamshi11 cau at mice go clirPctly to a wharf or leave !>ne, to di8emba.rk or embark passengers. Leaving San Francisco from the wharf the steamship, after tra\·ersiug the Pacific Oc1·au, is compelled to anchor off Yokohama, in tlie Bay of Yeddo; again, off Kobi, in the luland Sea; and off Nagasaki, in the bay of the same name. Bnt the Amel'ican and some of tlie. coasting steamers proceed directly to the wharf at Shanghai. r.eadng there, hmn"YCI', hy the Eugli15h or Freuch mail-steamers, passe11gers must find the vessel in the stream; they anchor in the Bay of Hong-Kong; go to the wha.rf at Singapore, and anchor at Penang, Point du Galle, off the surf-landing at :\Iadras or any other coast port, and anchor in the Hoogly at Calcutta. Againr at Bombay, at Suez, and even in the canal at Port Said, they do not go to the quay. The steamer anchors in th_e bay at Alexandria; so, also, iu the Bay of Naples and at Trieste; and

by small l>0ats only <lo pal'sengers enter tlrn ports tl1ence cai,;twartl to Constantinople. Even in leaving England or Irelauu the steamer must be boartle<l in the stream at Lh·erpool, or in the Cove of Cork at Queenstown, no matter bow boisterous the weather. .A.t New York, Pltiladelphia, or other American ports the steamer lands its passengers at the wltarf under coYer. And yet in many other respeets the harbor impro-·cmcnts in most of tbc European ports are far superior to those in America. At Yokohama ti.Jere arcJrnt limited improvemeuts along the water-front, yet a11 of them have been built by the foreign commnuity. Yessels lie in the ba.'·, and all passengers and freight are landed and embarked by means of small boats arn1 ligl1ters. In t;yphoons, vessels are torn from their anchorages and much damage is llone. ~-agasald.-T'be harbor of Nagasaki h; very fine, and capable of sheltering a moderately large fleet, except when tniboons blow from tbe southward. In .·January, 1875, the city bad not recovered from the destructiYe effects of the typhoon of August, 187±. Vessels lie in the bay, and passengers and freight are landed and cmbarkcu by means of sampans and lighters. There is an excellent bund or quay 011 the east or city side, and several luitoba.~ for landing and customs inspection. The principal and most <·ommodious one is well np the !'astern side of the ba.r, above the foreign settlement. Shanghai.-Tlie. ri n'r is not Yery wide and the currents are mo9.erntely strong. There are 11uays along tlte left bank below the principal part of tlle foreign settlement, and quay-landings for the rh-er-steamers bigllcr up toward tlte native town. Shanghai lias rhade considerable progress in the last twent)- years, and the improvements along the riYer are creditable under the adyerse circumstan~·es which attend any progressive moYements in that country. Ho11g-Jl..m1g.-Yt·ssehi. anchor in the roads, and passengersaml freight are landed and embarked bs boats and lighters- Quay accommodatio11s for landi11g, &r·., and for smaller vessels, and tLe steamers for :l\Iacao, Cantou, &c. Cantvn.-Up the Pearl Hiver there are 110 improveme11ts; the oltl forts remain as l1ismantled by the British men-of.war, ancl steitmships of light rlraugbt go as high as Canton and anchor or moor in the stream abreu;;t the upper part or the city. Singapore has tirnher quays, where steamships land and embark passengers and freight. Pena-11g.-Vessel,; lie at anchor off the town. One_modern quay for boats and lighters. Culeutta.-I:npron·ments in the river are such tl1at \·essels do not now anchor in Diamond Harbor, but proceed dit·ect to Caleutta. Toward that cit_v the ba11ks of the riYer are protected where de5tructh·e actiou by tl!e currents takes place. All vessels are moored in <loulJle or triple lines along tbc left bau k, and lauding :rnd em barlrntion are effected by lighters. A great d~sideratnm llas been a bridge across t11e river aboYe the city. The principal difficulty seems to be the want. of gootl foundation,as tbe depth of diluvial deposit is Yery great. They have now a very large ponton-bridgc for all ordi11ar~' traffie, but foars are expressed for its safety if any of tbc shipping should break away from its moOI'ings dming cyclones and be driven upon the bri1lge. Neyertbeless, it appears quite feasible to protect it from snch danger by powerful booms. The improvements in the drainage of Calcutta and its water-supply have been quite eflecti\·e; and the deatll-rale is now almost as low as in the most favored European cities. Bombay.-Yessel:; anchor in the bay, a11<l are loaded aml unloaded hy a class of large boats. iwculiar to this region. The quays are of stone and very substantially_ built, but -vessels do not come up to them. Tliere are sl:weral large dry-docks, in which everything is cont1tructed in the most substantial and enduring manner. Suez mid the Suez Canal.-The want of a good chart for courses through the l{ed Sea is a dmwha.ck to its secure navigation. The town of Suez,_. on the southern edge of the desert, which stretches thence to the Mediterranean Sea, is so low as to be not distinguishable until nearly up witb it. MonutAltaka, however, on the west, is easily recognizable, having au elevation of2,2{)0 feet. It is a good landfall, and visible from the canal when well north of Kantara. Some of the harbor improvements of Suez can be seen from the usual anchorage. .A long jetty of pierre perdtte has been projected from the eastern shore just south of the entrance to the canal and crossing its prolongation. From the large and readily-distinguished de(losit of sand on its southern face, it would 11ppear as if there was a preponderance of fitooral drift along that shore from the southward, and therefore its temlency is detrimental to the entrance of the canal.

Tl!e channel near Suez aml at the tnrus is too uarrow, unless Yer>- skillful pilots aml reu<lily-mai;;igP(l \'essels are used. Of course, tbe difficulty of steering is increased toward low water.

Certainly it is not a hundre·1tb of the UJO\'ement of tlie sand on the pPuiusul:i of California or ai: any otlier point on the California or Oregon coasts. Ju the uext twenty.three or twenty.four miles the liue passes through rite small and L1rge lrnsins called tl1e Bittl'r Lake. For nine mi!Ps through the Grand Basin, bet\Yeeu the two irou light-houses, there was needed no exca\'atiou, as the level of' the bottom of the basin was below the bottom of the canal. It is assertt'd that since the admission and flow ot' water i11to nud from the basin, the <lepth has increased on tlie line of the steamers, the bottom of salt lrn»iug heeu carried away in sol11tio11.

HEPOH'J' OF THE SUPElUNTENDENT OP

·

Even in this cut the signs are well marked of the fine clay anu sand stratification ; and the narrowness and slope of the surface section int1ieate that the least possible aggregate of material was removed. With this high cut and apparently contracted section it is fortunate that the prevailing wind is nearly parallel with the line of the canal, which, howen"r, has a direction, at this reach, of about ten <legrees east of north, so that the west side is the one lialJle to encroachments from driving san<l. But the adjacent desert is not wholly sand; in many places the surface appeared to be of heavier material that hail been left during centuries in which the Jighter material had been blown away. There were foca]ities of sand.)' surface, and of course tllere is mncl1 sand to he blown from the spoilbanks thcmse1 \'es. - Lake Ballah is reached at about the seventieth mile from Suez, aml thence the canal passes through the shallow lake and in its course for ele\'en miles it is cut through several low points and islets. Thence by a very low cut of two miles to Kantara, on the line of the old caravan-route from Cairo to Syria. Herc the spoil-bauks arc already hard, and the sand so indurated in layers with the clay that pieces of it cannot readily be broken Ly the hand. It appeared to have chemical constituents, which, when acted upon ur the air, were favorable to the solidification of the mass. At the water-line this was not the case, but abo\·e it there was little loose sand to he drifted. Prom Kantara to Port Said the 11il'ltance is ~8 miles, or a total of 111 miles from Port Suez. In this last reach the canal was excaYated beneath the surface of the water, lmt there is now no water visible on the east side of the canal, and the fast laud stretches several hundred yards towanl the westward; about halfway to Port Said this strip is three-quarters ofa mile wide. .Aud toward Kantara a mile or two of low, fiat, rich aUuvfal soil borders the cana1 and needs only the water of irrigation to make it yield good crops. Along the last stretch of twenty.five miles tlie land slopes away so gradual!.)' from a ]ow, narrow spoil-bank, that the question naturall,Y suggests itself, where the excaYated material has been placed. Throughout this line tbe canal, as a rule, has apparently its full section, and the channel is marked on each side by a series of lmoys, wbich haYe chains leading to the shore, so that their position can be chiu1ged. It is said that ab-0ut the seventh or eighth mile from Said there is frequently a difficulty experienced in the channel shoaling, and the po1mlar opinion is, that it arises from the bottom of the canal pressing in; but elsewhere reference will be made to another probable cause. 'l'bere are one or two points of contraction of the canal section, notably between posts tllirty-three and thirty.four, but the banks are bard indurated clay and steep to below water. At se\'eml points the spoil·l>ank is i1111urated and the sand is crawling in from the westward over it.. In some places there are a few hushes, but evidently no persistent effort is made to cultivate them. At the different stations, where the canal is widened so that vessels may pass, the piles at the landings a.re eaten by small worms upon the outside. No action of the teredo was observed, but destrnction by the worm is great, as some of the new piers have the piles covere(l with zinc. JJestructfre action by 11essels passfog through the canal.-All of ohe day was spent, and part of another, in passing through, at a rate of fi rn and a half statute miles per hour. Apparently, a current was against the course of the vessel thrtughont, hut was very slight toward Port Said. On this long line of low bauks and full width of section, the action of the waves of displacement caused by steamers was marked and destructi\-e. Parties "'ere at work in laying low, dry, vertical :walls. 1Vith large vessels, and especially of greater draught, the action must be mnch greater. The small blocks of soft stone were brought down the canal by ~ile boats. This was about all tile repairs going on throughout the length of the canal. Two or three small dredges were at work, and one at Port Said; and one of the Jargest class was being put in working order just south of the port. . The extreme width of the canal at the surface of the water may be taken at 130 feet; it con· tracts to a width of 77 feet at 5 feet below the surface, so that its cross-section would represent about 1, 750 feet. But this is not the cross.section in the heavier cuts, where the surface breadth is smaller. The vessel in her progress continuously displaces a body of water, in the aggregate equal to

her own displacemeut; uut t!Ie primary action of this displacing is forward of tl1e midishi p section of the -vessel, wl1ich acts as a piston in forciug a part of the water ahead. The ril'e ot thh; part of the displacell water is not readily detected from tile vessel, uuless well-marked ob,iects are 011 tlie line of water; at a point abaft the mius!Iip-section, about two-thirds the length of the n·ssel from the bow, there is a distinctly-marked rush of water aft on both sides the sliip, from th·e bigl1er level in front to tue lower level aft, to supply in part the volume of displacement. Tue c1iflererl<'e of level is ,-ery marked, and is of course more wuere the canal is contracted. From this higl1Pr level the water rushes strong!,) down and along the sideR of the lmnks until it is met b,1: a waYe advancing asteru the vessel, a,IJ(l following her to suppl,\ in part the -volume of <lis1ilacemL'llt. This wa1·e rose from two to three or eYen four feet high from the lowest part of t.he trougli, allll, curling aud breaking a8 it strm~k th1~ ba11 k, it 1lid far more clam age than the preYious receding wan-. Aloug the canal between Ka11tara and Port Sa.i1l, wliere the section exhibits a broad band of :o;hoal \Yater un1ler either bank, the 1le;;tn1ctiYe action of thi;; \Ya\~e was uotetl. Tltere was a RerieR of the descending aud retreating and five of tlte ascending aml returning w:l\'e;;, uot reckoning the tirst w:we in front of tue -vessel. From the fir4 (or second, if we include the wave preceding thP vessel) to the last waYe the distance was about two hundred feet, or O\'er two-thirds the ;:liip's lengtu. There is uo difficult.) whatever iu deciding 'wl.Jich wave is the most destrncth"e; where the bank was sand, there would be a heavy wasbiug away along the whole bank, except where the small \'ertical stone wall bad been built; but even this was in many places wasued down, doubtless by being undermine<l, and wherever the bank was fairl.Y prot<'cted by rushes or bs bushes, tlie destructive effect was very small. lu returning from Port Said to Isma'ilia in a small Rteamer sixty fePt in lengtl1, t-iimilar effects were produceu whenever she ran close under eitlier bank; but when she was in mi1l-cha1111el there was little or no damage <1one to the hanks. The <lestrnctive effect of the water tlistnrhed b;r the screw may he regarded as noUdng; compared with tbat of the wan·s of displacement. These observations are noted in 80lllt' tlPtail, because they exhibit a constant aml uestrncth-e agt>ucy at work far greater than tJip drifting of tbe sand uy the wind, aml in every case aiding it. Tt1ey may he in.-estigated by decrenfiing the ><ph·d of the steamers, which are now permitted to rnn ten kilometers (tin\ and a half statute mile.s) jl\'r hour, whatever their size. Either a much smaller speed should be established or the "l'"l'll nia1h· to depend upon the displacement; in which case the larger vessel would go tlirongh at a low1·r speed than the smalk\r vessel, and _yet produce as injurious effects upon the banks. Current through the canal; saltness of the ica.ter; tideN.-The rise and fall of the tide at Suez is about three feet, and at Port Said about ouc foot, the latter dependi11g in large mea,;me upon the wind. And when the north wiu<l blows Yery strongly down the Gulf of Suez and Red Sea continuously for a week, as it did upon our trip, the water is driven ont quite :4eHsib1y. Fortunately, tlie basin of the Bitter Lake is a great reservoir to equalize tlle effocts of the conflicting tides and currents. N everthelcss, there appeared to be a general movement to tbe soutl1ward, and as we approached the north end this was verified hy the presence of tlie decayed veg·etahle matter from the Nile along the banks of the canal. The littoral current along the shores of the Delta, or at least from t11e Darnietta moutb across the mouth of the canal, toward the Gulf of Pelusa, is four kilometers per hour. The engineer of the company at Port Said gave reiterated assurances that such was the result of Jhrir' obscrvatiom1. This current carries with it vast quantities of deca:ying vegetable matter from the Nile, and wlwn the dredge was at work near Port Said, the excaYatcu material contained abundance of large and small roots, branches, leaves, &c., and the odor was quite offensive. Along tlie canal-banks the line of the lighter decaying vegetable matter is well marked. On the return to Ismallia, aml at every station, th same material was noticed for many miles \fithin the canal. At Port Said and off that mot1th the presence of tl1e fresh water from the Nile is ver.r readily detected hytbe salinometer. The engineer of one of the Austrian Lloyds states that l1is numerous determinations of the quantity of salt in solution gave the following results with great uniformity: In the Red Sea, eight -OUll'}0S of salt to the gallog of water; in the Suez Canal, eight and a half ounces; and at the Port Said mouth of the canal, seven and a half ounces. The increased salinity II. Ex. 81--38

of the canal is readi.iy accounte(l for by the excessive evaporation going on, and by excess of salt from the bottom of the Bitter Lake, &c. Brealorater at Port 811id; <fred!Jing.-The western mole or break water at Port Said indicates that no Yiolent storms ocenr in that locality. A few hours~ action of the Pacific coa1't i-;well would spread that ureakwater ornr the Lottorn of the sea. This west mole is a long line of beton blocks dropped at random, so as to form a pier with a cross-section, liaYini! tile side slopes of 4iJCl, with the top fise meters in llreadth and two meters aboYe the sea. About one-third the way ont upon the pier the water was washing through the wicle interstices in many places, from the westward. Many blocks are broken across and irregularly; all arc more or less worn, say two and a 11alf inches de!'p, an<l exhibit sand and shells in tlie material as if from the beach. The wash of the sand through the whle interstices of the mole is so great tlmt a drP,dger i11 con:;;tantly at work remoYing it. From the inuer end of the pier the formation of the saud-heacb, now aLout three feet above the water, bas progressed outward six hundred yards, and is constantly working to seaward. Prom the regnlar observations of the company, it appears that tlie westcm point of this formation is at the hcach; three miles from the pier, and the e~'e plainly traCP8 the line of disturhe'l water, with it8 load of Nile matter in suspensiou, from a point apparentl.r l1alf a mile off the beach in tlmt direction tu tl1e extremity of the pie1·. The law of deposit seems regular, and already the pier bas been prolonged, anu will be farther carried seaward as the necessity arises. The sand of this new beach, when dry, is drifted by the northwesterly winds into the canal, because there is no elevated line of hnlk-liead or fence continued landward oil the line of the pier. This drift has formed so large a deposit within the canal that the mass above the water is gathered in heaps and sold as ha.lla1't to the outgoing coal-ships. Although there was uo dredger at woTk at the mouth of the canal, tl1e engiueer stated that tlie littoral drift carried the Nile matter across the extremit_y of the pier and formed a bar, which is removed by dredging to thirty feet of water. The material dredg<'d from the canal is carried six miles eastward of the month and dropped into the sea. The machine obs!'rrn<l at work takPs np 1,4:30 cubic yardA per day, and each steamscow ca.rrieR away 150 tons. Tiu~ dredger at work was bringing up only two-thirds of the buckets full of material. The east em pier is 11ot. parallel with the western, nor is it so long. It appears even of less dimensions than the other, and there is no intention to increase its length or size. So far as can be judged from the present effects of the littoml drift, and from the prevailing moderate northwest winds, there is no absolute necessity for this eastern mole. Beton blocks,; manitfacture; clwraeter; size; eost.-Tbe engineer of Port Said attended at a Yisit to the Beton \\' orkR, which are on the east side of the canal, nearly opposite Port Said. The sand and cement are incorporated iu a seri<'s of large iron arastras, each with four iron wheels for thoroughly mixing the material. rower is transmitted by slrnfting from steam-engines under a large shed. 'Vhen the sand and et·urnnt arc sufficiently incorporated, two closed rectangular openings in the bottom of each arastra are opened, and the contents are dropped into a wooden box about four feet square by two fret deep, placed on a truck, which is moved about twenty or thirty feet to a position wlH're its contentR are de})osited iu the mould. This mould is on wheels, and mo\·es by rail parallel with the 8t·ries of arastras, so that it may be moved under each of the boxes and recei\·e their conte11ts, until the n·quired amount is in the monld. Tlie blocks, when a little worn, ~how lines separating the layers, and these appear to be about ten inches thick. The beton blocks contain 3:>3 cnhic feet and weigh 20 tons. Tlwy are a little more than 10 by 6~ feet in length and breadth, and 5 feet thick. Tbe material "sets" at once, and then the blocks are parked ready for use. When they are needed a Jarg~iron bridge on two 11ets of rails is run over the block, which is hoisted in 11lings by 11ydranlic power on the bridge, and then moved to another rail at right angles, on which runs a heavy truck. When this truck is loaded it is moved to the shipping-point, where similar hydraulic power on a second iron bridge lifts it and deposits it on the vessel. At first, these blocks were made out of beach-sand, &c., but they were found to disintegrate badly, and now the company obtains the sand from Kantara, because it contains so great a percentage of silica, and no salt. As elsewhere mentioned, the sand excavated from the ~anal at Kautara bad become hardened in the spoil-bimks by simple exposure.

These beton blocks cost 340 francs each ($03. i5) when laid on the mole. T:"p to :\Jay 12, 18i5, the company had made 13,0UO, and had a stoek remaiuing on hand. The total cost of the tlrn pieris at this rate would tlierefore l>e $828 1750. The light-house, near tlle inner eud of the weste1 n mole, a graceful octHgonal i:.tructure about one hundred feet Ligh, is built of beton of the 11at11ral colur, and is surmounted b;y au electric light, on a range for entering the canal between two moored lights in the canal.

Estimate of cost.
~.\s a grt>at artery of commerce, the canal is a isucce!:-s. The largest class of steamships and men-of-war pass through it; ou an aYerage, seyen vessels are i11 tran.~itu_at one time. It has given rise to new forms of vessels resembling enormous caual Loats, aml known to the profeission as "canallers." Financially, no opinion is here iutended upon tbe subject, hut so far as could be learned, the tonnage transit duties average $37.3,000 per month. As an engineering work, and putting aside unlrnown qnestions of diplomacy aud fi1iance, there haYe been 110 extraordiuary difficulties to overeome. The question of ronte was ·within >ery narrow limit:;;, aud the surn·ss HPcPs_ sary for deterrntning tlic most feasible line could nut admit of doubt in the location. Tue southern part, from the Bitter Lake to Snez, follows the liue of earntl of the l'haraobs, and does not diverge much from it to Lake 'l'irnsah. The northeru terminus may or may not be in exactly the best location. The direction of the littoral drift wonld greatly affect that question. Tbe material through which the canal has lwen carried is of a yer,y favorable character, for facility of removal, formation of spoil-banks, and the presernttion of the section.

Alcxandria.-The new breakwater protects the harbor from all wiutls from the northward and eastward. It i;i constructed of" 11ierre perdue" apparently without, with a sufficient section to withstand such seas as arise here. Dut the efficiency of the whole harbor is reduced by the old mole which runs out northward from the southern shore of the harbor, aud giYes an area mnch too limited for the present demandl!I. This mole stretches so far tuwanl the north shore of the lrnrbor as to crnmp the passage between them for long Yessels. Tue new mole, if projected farther to the northward, would have given a Ja1·ger area for t!Je harllo1". If heitvy seas should eYer attack the mole, it is, perhaps, too high to withstand them. The bottom was of )-ielding material, as miµ:ht readily be supposed. Naples; Ge11oa.-Nothing need he saill of the former, with its small mole. At Genoa, the new great breakwater affords a good anchorage for a large bo<l:r of shipping i11 deep watPr; hut tbe vessels principally crowd inside the inuer or old mole, and are moored in tiers very close together. Passengers and freight are landed and disembarked by small boats and lig'11ters. I.arg·c vessels also li~ moored un<ler the shore heuce to the light-house, whieh is situated at the inner eu<l of the outer breakwater. The breakwater is finislied with mai-lom·_y on the top alld inside, aml when visited there was a very strong breeze aml rnoderatul,r larg·ti swell rolliug in: which threw its spray over the breakwater. From the light-hom;;e a view was obtained of the new aud old "breakwaters, and of the coast line to the east and westward. The uew mole might luM·e been located farther out, with its western end anchored upou tlie extremity of the promontory upon whieb the liglithouse is built. The light-house is a plain substantial structure of stone upon a roek, alld perhaps not less than three hundred feet above the sea. The light is of the first order of Fresnel. 8U'inemutide; breakwaters; improi'enients in cham1el.-Stettin lies on tlJe Oder, thirty miles south of Swinemunde, with which it bas water communication for yes:;;cls drawing sixteen feet. The line of steamers that had been rnnuing fo1· a short period thence to ~ew 1 urk was withdrawn on account of a lack of patronage. The Oder at Stettin is quite nanow; nevertlieless, it admits of a large Baltic trade. Tbe stream in many of its cJ;aractl'riistics be;1rs a strong resemblance to the larger bayous of Texas, especially toward its month, which opens not <iirectly upon the Baltic, but into the Stettiner Haff, a fresh·water souutl about seventy-five miles in circumference, and bearing much the same rehttiou to the coast-line as Pamplico and Alllemarle

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Souuds bear to the coast of North Carolina. This body of water is divided into the Grasses Haff ou the east and the Kleiues Haff on the west; and the water of the Oeler and of other streams tiu<ls three passages l1e11ce to the Baltic, hy tlie Dienow at tile eastern extremit,y, the Swine in the middle, and the Pune Oil the west; the :som1d months of the extrPme passages are thirty miles apart, and their courses are long, lmt the course of the Swine is only auout tweh·e miles. Swinemunde lies direetl,\' upon the Baltic, Oil the left bank of the Swine, and is a modern sea-port, where lleaYy and deeply laden \essels for Stettin receive and discharge their cargoes. For the desirecl examinations, kind and prompt assistance was re11dered by Mr. Pante!, tbe Unitetl States consular agent. The irnproYement in tlle depth of the narrow entra:uce, ll:->' artificial means, is very noteworthy. Fonnerly, the entrance to the chanuel was protected lly short moles coustructed of blocks of stone thrown upon a base-work of fascines. These were destroyed b.r the gales of every heavy winter. The uepth of water on the bar was tlien (1828) six feet, and there is no rise and fall of title except what may be occasioned by the prevalence of stroug wind8, which, in northeast storms, bank the water m·er the streets of i::lwinemuude. But there is a constant current out from the Stettiner Sound, whicll is mainl;v supplied with fresh water from the river8 Otler, lhna, and ITckcr; but the current here is not strong on account of the other outlets already mentioned. The narrowest part of the artificial passage is 3JO yards, bnt this does not rt'pre:,;ent the chanuclway, which is not quite llalf that \Yidth between the 24-foot curves. As nearl_y one-half of' tlrn western side of the pa:ssage has less than six feet of' water, it is iutentled to construct a new bulwark ovtr the shoal line, and Urns coutract anu doubtless improve the artiticial channel. Within the '..l'1-foot lines, two ocean-steamers can pass each otlier 'll'ithout difficulty. The artificial channel is fonued of two nearly pamllel moles of unequal length, l'Unniug out, not in a straight line, but curving well to the westward. 111 fact, the outer or eastern mole, and the shore-line inside, is 115 degrees of a circle having only 2,000 ;yards radius; and for two miles the deep water scours dirtwtly under its wall. Tht. mouth of the channel is thus caused to open to the northwest by 11ortli (true), and Yessels running for refuge, in northeast 8torrns, must run under all sail for the extremity of the pier, rouud it within a ship's leugtll, and haul up sharp on a soutlleast by south course, or go upon tlw western point of sands and be lo;;:t. Last winter there were four vessels lost by not conforming to these requirements; one losing all hands, because neither the tug nor life-boat coulll reach her. .From the East :Fort on the right bank the distance to the light-llomm on the extremity of the east pier is 2,600 ;yardR, of which the onter two-thirds is the recent stone pier extending from the present beacb -line. The extremity of tlrn we8tern pier (built in the same 11Hu111er, hnt without parapet) is 60tl yards inside the eastern pier, bnt the line of shoal water extends on the line of its prolongation far heyoud the extremity of the eastern pier. The section of the easfrrn or priucipal pier is fairly illustrated by the accompanying sketch (illnstratiou No. 30, sketch 3). It has to withstand the heavy northeast gales, is (1uite small, and very low; but the blocks of stone arc laid securel,Y iu cemeut. The swell broke completely over it in winter, and it was decided to huild the the and a half foot parapet all along the pier, on the seaward face. Notwithstanding the masonry of this wall was very good, its section proved too sµiall, for the gales of 1874-'75 carried 250 feet of' it bodily into the channel. The piers have been prolonged several times as tbe <leposits haYe taken place off the ueacli, which was formerly inside the prei;ent brick forts. Tbe beach has, therefore, made not less than 11050 ~'ards to seaward; and the indications from the soundiugs are that it is merely a question of time wben additional length shall be given to the piers. A study of this case indicates that tbe prolongation of tbe west pier is not necessary, but that the prolongation of the east pier may be necessary, and slioul<l be carried out in a straight line, or rather in a curve of gradually-increasing radius. 'Vhat littoral drift there is seems to prevail from the eastward, and the deposit on the prolongation of the west pier is partly from the sound and partly from the littorat drift. But the increased depth of water in tile channel is not wholly due to tile piers, but in part to the constant use of a small dredger. The cost of main· te1mnce of the piers aud of the dredger is quite moderate, and the results are the fill}St favorable as yet seen npo.u a coa.st subject to very heavy gales.

The greater part of this area was not <:>uly solid ground, but tlie hill:; to t!Je eastward have been cnt down 95 feet to bri11g them to the level of the work;;;. Then' are 10 lie two large basins for construction, repairs, mid outfittillg.

The graYing-docks htffe inYertt>d arch bottoms and sol ill brick walls between each other. The foundation for the walls is good gran.>l, and requires 110 piling, although sheet-piling was being driven for tile sitles of the cro,,;s-walls Getween the two lari;l~ IJasius. These walls are 15 feet thick. Ornr the gravel is laid beton to g·in· a le\'el continuous surface for the wall, which is coped with stone. The IJricks used arc slig-htlT larger th au Arnt'rit:an bricks; yellow, very h1tnl, well burned, and, when strnek, emit a metallic riug·. T!Jey are brought twenty-five miles by water. Hamburg; docks.-N o notcwortily impron·meuts. 011e 01· t\\'o :;mall dre(lgers were noticed iu the river between Hamburg and Blankeuese. 'l'lw right bank of the river i:; a bluff alrnut sixty feet iu elevation; the left bank low, and tlte eonntry between the north atHl south brnud1es of tl1e Elbe is flat, low, swampy, a.ud cut up lly many broad slouglts. \Vhen there is any teudeney to cut away the right bank, frequent narrow~ low lines or stakes aud stoHes aw carried ont at right augles to the beach for twenty to t.hirty-Jh-e ~yards, and they appear to he snfticieut. 'L'he ,-es:·wls alo11gtue rnaiu qnay of Hamburg are arranged in tit·r:s of two and three det·p, with passages for lmrgt·i< to load and unload. These barges receh-e aud discharge freight at craBes alm1g the qtrnJ·-Jrout, or at the warehouses ou the numerous cauals ruuning through the city. Iu the latter case, t!Je1e is no pavemeut bordering the canal. 'L'be "Sandthorl1afen" had onl.r la'rge stl'auwr.s, priucipalls English, loaded with coal. There is a great line of brick shed$ with iron roof" down each whart; with the fronts toward the water open; but; 011 the onter or street side the.'· :trn elotit·d \rith grt>at doors. Between (Jach line of sheds anu the dock there are lai<l two lines of rails; the outer quite broad for carrying movable steam-cranes, the inuer one, of tlJC ordinary IJreadth, for cm·;,;; but apparently none are used, as the freight is discharged by the cranes directly irito the shed, and ti.Jenee it is l:lbipped into the OOr8 OU the outside of the shed, where there are four line:,; of track between it and the street, which is railed off by an iron-wire feuce. Bremerhafen; old and new doch.-'rhere ueing nothing of iuterest at Hn·rnPn, t!Je mute was continued to Bremerllafen, to exami11e the great ducks alreat1y built and those i11 progT1·,.;.s. There are two docks at Gestemunde openiug into the small stream GPst1', where it dehotH:!JPs into the Weser with a rapid current on the eulJ-tide. Below the Geste are tlte t1rn linisLPd docks of Bremerhafen, and the third one under construction. These are all ou hwd suhjPct to on·rtlow at high water, but diked in with the material excavated. The soil hi a stiff l1lue clay sixty feet thick over sand aad gravel. Piles are driven sixty feet, or until they penetrate two feet iuto the gravel, when they can be driven no farther. Over the piliug is laid a grillag-e, and npon that the walls of brick are laid in cement. The bricks are red and go01l, but not equal to tho:;e at Kiel. The walls are coped with stone. The depth of water over the sills of the docks is tweuty-sHeu feet; and there are two sets of gates a.teach entrance; the outer one is the higher, to kc<:·p out tlood-waters. The docks of Bremerl1afen open up stream, but those of Gestemuude open into the Ge.ste. This arrangement of the lower docks is made because the vessels enter at three-quarters tloo<l, and the

pilots can therefore better handle the vessel against the current. But this form is particularly farnrable for the deposit of silt, especially as the river brings down a very large amount of material in suspen8ion. The deposit in the entrance is two inches each ti_de, or four inches daily; of course, there is not so much inside tlie gates, as they are only open one and a half hours before high water and for a short time after. This deposit is removed every eight days, when it bas reached a depth of two to three feet, by scouring. '\Vb en the water on the outside is six feet below the surface of the water iu the docks, the inuer gates are opened, and the scour cleans the entrance, which is a smooth flooring of ma:,;ourr laid over grillage and piling. . In wiuter, the ice forms to an aggregate thickness of six feet, and is kept brokeu in the docks by small steamers plyiug constantly. '\Vhen it bticomes too hea\'Y it is carried o'ut in the same manner as for scouring tile entrance. }fr. lhlder, the United States consular agent, states that the river-ice has not damaged tlie pier-heads (of timber) at the entrance to the docks, but what seems to be a local e1ld,v is noticeable in that vicinity, that sweeps the ice away from the diking and the piers; otherwise, th(';y woul\1 offer a cousta.nt obstruction to it. This, however, instead of an eddy, may be the outpouring el>b-waters of the Geste, opening at right angles to the river just above tlw first or upper dock, which tlirows the ice off the immediate shore-line. The 'Neser does not become frozen fast in winter at Dremerlrnfen, but ahout two miles above Gestemunde it does, and thenee there is sleighing on the ri-,er to Bremen. Rremerhafen is a great entreprJt for petroleum, and vast shed:s are stored with it beyond tlie tliird or lower <lock. In the second dock, sixteen of the large steamers of the Brnmeu Line were laid up on account of depression in commerce. Willtelmshafen; German naval dock-yard.-This is the new German na.val dock-yanl upon the .North Sea. It is 11citlrnr so extensi>e nor so important as that at Kiel. The site is on the reclaimed land near the Yillage of HeppenR, on the west point at the narrowest part of the ,Tade Bay. The iuuer harbor is 400 yards by 240, and has three dr,y-docks and two slips for the construction aud repair of iron-clads. '!'his harbor is 700 yards from the extreme point of entrance; and the canal and recei\'ing-barbor are executed in heavy granite masonry. Iu the eutrance-harbor was lyiug a dredger, evidently needed to keep the required depth in the approaches. Additional reclamation 1s being made to giYe more dockaglj on the southwest side of the entrance. The soil is a stiff black clay, and is used for forming the dikes without the use of fascinage or other helps. The railroad connects vVilbelmshafen, which is quite a pleasant place, with Oldenburg; am1 a large caual is being opened close under tbe embankment. Tlte Amsterdam Canal; enlargement; protection of banksj North Sea Harbor; 1fretlgingj ln·eak1catcrs.-1'here are already two or more printed descriptions of the details of this work, so that reference here need be made only to some of the cl¥tnges deemed necessary, and to the points that more especially attract attention. The canal west of Velsen and the North Sea Harbor were visited with Mr. Dutton, the executive engineer for the contractors Of the party were also Messrs. Waldrop, lfose, and Siemens. l<'rom .i\ir. Dirks, the chief engineer, copies were received of all the specifications of tbe work, and the maps exhibiting the lauds reclaimed, &c. The sand-dunes, bordering the coast-line for an average breadt.h of two miles, are about fm'tyfh·e feet above the sea; and from Velsen westwal'd the heaviest and only cutting of importance has been effected. These dunes are not naturally covered with vegetation. Tlie cut through these dunes was finished 203 feet wide at the surface of the water; but as new projects for a great central railroad-station were commenced at Amsterdam, and the city needed material for filling, it granted a subsid~ of' $!.l,400,000 to the Canal Oompany for sand, upon the condition tllat the surface width of the canal should be increased to 230 feet; the depth to be 27 feet for a bottom width of 115 feet, giving a slope of one to one for the sides. This widening is now in progress along the south side of the canal. To prote{lt the banks against the destructive effect of the wave of displacement of the steamers, they will be pitched below and above the snrface of the water with blocks of one, two, or three cubic feet dimensions, of hard limestone, or of basalt from the Rhine. They will not be smooth laid; tbe illea is that rough pitching will break the wave and retard it; but unl~ss the stone is deep, the sand will pl'Obably be washtid from between a.nd from below the stones, as may be seen at some parts of the newly..;made wall on the Suez Canal. At present, the protection is a

.wooden bulk-head, which is about two feet above the surface of the water. Engfocer 'Yaldrop says the best defense is a ree<l, that is indigenous. Near Amsterdam it Vias obserYed that a fringe, four feet wide, of this reed, 1iYe feet high, completely smoothed the top of the principal adrnncing wave, which had been combing and tearing along that part of the bank of one of the canals protected by stone. Among the reeds the wave was as high as along tLe sloping stone wall, but it bad little or no bank-destroying power. The med was then (August 27) nearly in RCe(l, and looked like a carcx. It is not, however, propagated for this work liy seed, but transplanted, and in a sandy soil, on the edge of the canal, is put 18 inches deep, in a muddy soil about 10 inches. It would be evf'n better than the tule of California, because it grO\YS much like a tall, coan·P grass or millet, with a stalk half au inch in diameter, and witl1 many leaYes. Alon~ the cmial, tlirougli tlic dunm;, these reeds are planted inside the present wooden bulk-head. The dune,; for a good distance on each side of the canal, and the slopes of the canal, are plaute<l with a coarst' grass, 2~ feet ltigli, which grows well, and,.. cffectnally protccti-; tlrn sand from driftirig. 1t will grow from the seed, but in that case tho sand may be dri~·en awa~-, and lean~ the seed exposc>{l. The transplanting costs one cent per square yard, and the growth is thick from fallen !'eed. Ji'rom this thick matting, the plants nre taken for tran.~planting. 1t seeds at the end of Angn.o.;t. The slopes of the canal-banks aboYe the water are one to one and a balf, and tbis grass !Jolcls them perfectly. It would be a capital coYeriug for the sauu-dunes of Califoniia and Oregou. It is locally known as t!Je trelm. The dredger, costing from $1fi,OOO to $17,000, pfaces in the scows an rn-erage of behrreu 700 rmd 800 tons of material dail,v; but 1,500 Lave been removed in one day. Each scow carries from 100 to 110 tons, aud is to\·rnd seaward to 1.-; fathoms of water and <lischargetl. Tl1e m('ans of' closing t.!Je six shutters of each scow, so that each shall lrnn:1 the same strain to keep it closell, i1> f]Uite simple and ingeniom1, and Yery effective. Iuside t!Je canal the 8mall dredgl·rs, of the or!linary scoop form, were removing 011ly 400 tons (l;\ily; but the. dredgers are quitP small. Tlw sand is raised to the top of t,he south bauk, and carried hellce hy tram-way to Amsterdam. Tim deptb of water now (August 27, 1875) in the canal is reported at 16 fert, and the com. pan~- a.re under contract to ha Ye that depth through the harbor and the canal by April, 1S7fi: to be increased to 27 feet (8 meters) throughout by 18i7. Tltc entrance looks and sluioes.-The two locks and the sluices near the seaward t>utrancP to tbe canal are simple, 1iue-looking })ieces of' brick-work, without the least iu<lication of cracking or settling. The lougest lock will recei\'e lL ,.e8Sl'l of the largest class. It has three gates (for protection) built of iron, witb air-chambers, and is balanced so as just to be bnoyaut. Thl' 1irst gate, toward the sea, is the strongest aud highest, as a guard against st-Ot·m .fiotlds, and 'yeigfo;; 57 tons. The middle one is lower, and weighs 45 tons. .The Inner is the lnwest, :rnd wcigfoo; 33 tons. The brick walls separating the locks decrease in height with t!Je gates. These ]lien,; are built upon a grillage, resting ·on pile.s, and no difficulty was experienced with the side piers; but some trouble was encountered with the central one, where a stream of 10 inchl'" 1iad to be led off until the work was nearly done, when it was closed up without difikulty. The bottom of the lock-chambers and the aprons, and the bottom of the side channels, C(msist of foscinage, broken bricks, and basalt.rock pitching. Tlic beton blocks.-It is claimed that the beton works are the most extensi.-e )n the world. The concrete is composed of sand, shingle, and cement, in proportions specifieil in tLe contracts. Tl1e sand here does not make good bet.on, so it is brought a distance of 100 miles. The blocks range from 4 to 10 tons, with size,s 3! feet thick, 4 feet wide, and from !J to 13 feet in leugth. .At the contractor's office it was intimated that they hall been fonnd too small, c>speciall_y aloug the exposed faCBs of the piers, where the he.ivy waYes tended to lift them up. 1t was in contemplation to increase t:he size of some of them to 20 tons. '"'hen brought from \'elscn, they arc tirRt stored on the north side of the canal near the shore. Suhseqnentl,r, they are carried by rail acrrnss a wooden trestle-work to the inner end of the south pier, where they lie until neeiled. Thence tliey are moved on a tram.way laid on a pier, in pairs, and stored near the outer end until needed, when they are lifted by the crane and placed in situ. · North Sea har-l>or breakwaters; design; method of buildillg.-While landing on tho inner side of the south breakwat~r ~r pier, a swell was running square on the line of the pier, from the

effects of the last gale. TLe work is out to 4,723 feet (1,440 meters), and the foreman stated that he was working in 3G feC"t of water (11 meters); alt.hough the piers are intended to go out to only 27 feet (8 meters). The experience gained in the construction of these piers is valuable. Tbe original design appe.ars to have het>n somewhat similar, if not identical, with that of the Admiralty pier at Dover. This consists, at the inshore end, of a solid sea-wall (having a hearting of concrete) with a slight lrntj:er on each side, but changing to nearly -vertical sides as it progresses outward, and almmlouing the hearting of concrete. This (the Dover) pier rests upon the hard, chalky bottom which is not torn away by storms; but the case is wholly different at the North Sea Harbor, where the bottom is coarse sand liable to shift, and -very quickly carried away when any large body i,; placed npon it, around wbich irregular currents are generated. Therefore, when this Dover plan was mlopte(l here, the saud was washed away from the base of the breakwater, which hr its weight ag·;iin pressed out the sand beneath it; and this was in turn wa11hed away, so tl1at the pier settled and ga\·e way. Y\,'ithout abandoning this method, the lowest layer of bcton hlocks was allowed to settle until it was emuedtled ·in the sand; it settled irregularly, but was leYeled off near the low-water line to sen·e as a foundation for the upper courses. This was necessaril_y slow and expeusi \·e, and it is doubtful whether it was not, in great measure, liaule to subsequent nnderwashiug in great stonns. Tht>11 two outer an<l boundary lines of concrete blocks were laid with the iutnspace filled with basalt blocks; a pierre perJne as a foundation. But it is eYident that the procmis of uuderminiug the margiual blocks is identical with that attacking thP. pier itself, aud then the loose basaltic foundation must ;deld. After ahando11ing- this, a base has been formed us throwing in basaltic aud limestone rocks upon the sand to the depth of one meter, for a breadth of :~.'3 feet on each side of the base of the breakwater; beyou(l that, they take tlrn natural slope. These rocks are approximately leveled by a <liver, wbo then spreacfa a layer of spall (of pieces 13 by 2 inches, or thereabouts) so as to fill the interstices of the larger blocks. The leveling of this riprap is done by means of au iron bar swung horizontally from the eud of the crane lJy a double chain. The b.:tou block is then lowered to its position over this leveletl pnrt, and trial rnalle of it.s horizontality by means of an irou disk, 15 inches in diameter, snspeudetl by a chain from the crane. This disk is moYcd O\'cr different parts of the block nutil the n~quired accuracy is attained. The work is quite tedious, because the seeing is always difficult on :iccount of the discolored water. After the lower hlocks are laid, basaltic blocks similar to those of tl1e foundation are laid along each side of the breakwat<>r to the top of the first course. It is found that there iA a heavy: scour at the eud of the ln'Pakwater as it is being carried out, so that the foundation-bed of riprap is really placed on a depression of 3 or 4 feet, if not more, thereby giving some advantage to the found a ti on. Some of tlle ablt>st Dtltcb engineers express grave doubts about the foundation of the breakwaters, and insist that it shouhl have been made of fascinage. The beton blocks are carried up to tlrn low.,water line without cement; and it is found that the blocks are, at that height, generally leYel, as required hy specification. For the joints at the low-water line a quick-setting hydraulic cement is used; aboYe th<lt., Portlaml cement. Iu examining the wlwle length of the pier, the surface was found to he irregular and apparently sunk in places, and cracked across quite frequently. In fact the first crack across was within 20 or 30 yards of the pier end, and was continued below the watcr-liue. The general appearance of the pier is unfavorably light and not of superior material; 2~-inch iron rods had been laid in grooves of the upper end outer course of blocks about:!~ feet from the seaward edge, and then covered with concrete; but frequently the concrete was gone, and the rods exposed and badly oxidized. The damage, or danger of dislocation or fracture of the outPr blocks, increases toward the slwre end, and cross iron tie-rods, round and square, have been introd11ced to meet emergencies caused by fracture. The introduction of this cramping is a new article in specification No. 5 .<J, being the seventh modification of the original plan, August 6, 1873. The surface blocks a.re ba(lly weathered. About half the way out to the breakwater a continuous concrete parapet witll has been built along the south edge of the south pier. It is about 5t feet high and 6 feet wide; but the material is already badly worn, and in places is broken through. No examination was made at the north pier, but specification No. 5 g says that both breakwater&

shall be similar in construction. It will be recollected that an attempt was made to construct this north pier by commencing seaward and working toward the beach, and that the plan failed on account of the scouring away of the bottom from around and under the pier, and between it and the shore. This scouring process was so destructive that it endangered and finally carried away the Rcaffolding for the rails, by washing away the sand from around the screw-piles. The breakwaters are each to be 5,058 feet in length, and at the extremities the breadth of the top of the north pier will be 272 feet (8.35 meters), and that of the south pier 261 feet (8.05 meters). The dredging of the North Sea Harbor, formed b~- these two breakwaters, will he completed by the first of April, 1876, to give tbe following bottcm widt!Js and depths along the center line of tbe harbor: At the entrance, 28~ yards wide; 2C\1 feet water at low tide : At 550 yards inside the entrance, 909 yards wide; 24! feei water at hw tide : At 1,090 yards inside tlie entrance, 305 _yards wide; 20:! feet water at low tide: At 1,210 sards inside the entrance, 82 yards wide; 23 feet water at low tide : and thence the same depth through the canal to .A.msterdarn. As alrearty mentioned, it was originally intend;)d to carry ont tlie breakw<\ter as a solid wall, l>ut in addition to all the modifications which ham been Sj_)eciticd, it has been fouml necessary to protect it by a line of heton blocks thrown ill a pierre perilnc along the south or seaward face of the south pier to the level of the water, in order to break the force of the southwest swell upon the wall, and probably to proteci the base. But it seem8 not altogether irnprouable that in very ,·ioleut gales the southwest seas may dri,'e these loose blocks against tlie wall and parapet to ftheir lllJUry. Specification No. 39, of April 25, 1875, pre>icribes t!Jat these" wave-breakers'' shall be carried for certain named distances along the sea-face of each pier, and around the pier-heads to the inner facing. The cross-section of this loose material is fourteen feet on top, at ten feet above low water, with the outer slope of one to one; and the material comprises 162,000 c11bic yards of concrete and basalt blocks, the latter beie.g in comparatively small mas;ies, aud some of the former condemned material. The tides rise 4 feet, and it is said that by a peculiarity of the tides meeting here, littoral drift is prevented; but in the green water a well-marked line of current rips was noticed, which indicated a current then setting to the northward, while the discolored water wa.s only hctlf a mile out from the south pier, b11t spread out much farther to the north ward of the harbor. That mas have been on account of the previous day's strong son th westerly wi11d, which raised sufficient swell to prevent the laying of a,ny blocks. Dam at Scllellingwonde ; the ea.~tern e.rtremity of tlte Amsterdam Gar1al; <lifficnlties of construction; how overcome.-A description of the work of Urn Amsterdam Canal and the North Sea breakwaters would be incomplete without reference to the dam across the Ij (or Y) at Schellingwonde, near Amsterdam, although it comes partl.r within the subject of land-reclamation. When the Great North Sea Canal .(the Amsterdam Canal) was originally proposed there was a multitude of objections to it, among which was the liability of the canal to fiuctuatiom; of waterlevel from storm-changes in the level of the Zu,rder Zee. Then also it was demanded that tlie adjacent waters of the "\Vijkermeer and the Ij, which are t!Je south westerly termination or arm of tht> Zuyder Zee, should be drained iu order to make the undertaking commercially (financially) sue cessful. But after some years of waiting and discussion this project was considered essentially a part of the scheme. To overcome the first objection it was decided to dam the Jj just east of Amsterdam, and between Schellingwonde on the north side, and Paardenhoek, near Leelmrg, on the son th. The hostility to this essential feature of the great idea was ernuttrnlly overcome, and this remarkable dam was constructed under unusual difficulties. The dam or embankment is 1,482 yards in length, and is built upon fascinage iu depths from 5 to 215 feet, upon a bottom of soft mud about 40 feet deep, resting upon santl. The usual rise and fall of the tide is 14 inches, but storm-tides reach 10 to 15 feet, at which times the current through this channel-way is two and a half miles per hour. The breadth of the base of the dam is 140 feet, except the closing part which is about 150. Tile assumed settlement of the center line of the d.a.m was 13 to 14 feet, and the line of the crown is 15 feet above ordinary low water.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The first operation in building the dam was to co\"er the entire site with a strong fascine-mattress, worked in pieces of 200 feet in length, 30 inches thick, and overlapping each othP.r about 3 feet. Then upon each edge of this floor-mattress, long narrow mattresses, at first 25 feet broad, are laid at low water, each superior mattress being narrower, and receding from the lower edges of the one below, so as to gi\"e a sharp slope on both sides of these parallel lines of marginal mattresses. These are brought up to high water. Between these rows of fascine.work the space is filled with sand and clay, rPsting upon the floor-mattress. As the work sinks in the soft mud, the marginal fascinage is added and the sand and clay filled in. Above the high-water line, the proper cross-section is given to the work both with fascines and filling. The details of the manufacturing of these mattresses and other fascinage are not necessary.to The substratum of mattresses, wlien loaded, sinks in soft; mud with moderate regularity and gradually, unless .the mattress is weak, and becomes ruptured lengthwise, as happened in the Schellingwonde dam. In th is case, the mattress split longitudinally, and the halves separated. The only remedy was to fill the cavity with clay and sand until the settling ceased. It was originally intended to use a doublefioor mattress, but tlte plan was abandoned, lest water should penetrate the dam through such a thickness of fascinagt-. Iu sandy soil there is little or no danger of this, as in a few days the sand finds its way in the interstices of the fascinage and makes a solid mass of the whole. But it would appear reasonable to suppose that when the floor-mattress was laid in this case, a thin layer of sand might have worked sufficiently through it, and then a second mattress over this might ham been similarly treated; or they might have been separated by several feet of sand and clay, and thus have given a Rtro11g fascinage flooring that would necessarily have sunk, but woult.1 not have beu rupture1l. There is one great advaut:ige in the nse of fascines in such an umlertakiug, and that is in closing t.lie >Yater-way. In the Schellingwontle dam the opening was 328 feet, and this wa;; closed o\·er the whole width simultaneously; but of course the sma11 rise and fall of tide aud weak current were favorable circumstances. The principal difficulty in the construction of this 'lam was in building the foundations for the sluices and locks near the north side, now called the ''Orange sluices." 'J'be north wing at the dam stretches three hundred and twenty. eight yar<ls from tl1e Schelliugwonde sitle; and tlien the abutments for both sides of the sluices, the drainage·sluices for the pumps, the three locks for 11avigatiou, and the outlet-sluice occupy 136 yards. For the coi1struction of these sluices and abutments an immense coffer-dam, 175 yards in diameter, was ma<1e of two concentric rows of heavy sheet-piling, each pile being from 75 to 80 feet in length. lt was misnccessfo1; various failures were overcome, and it required three years before the work was completed. The ma8onr.y works rest upon grillage laid upon a forest of 9,000 piles, averaging 75 feet in length, and which have heen driven into the sand. Memoranda conct>rning the pumps, &c., will bt' found under the head of land-reclamation. Chabourg; commercial a11d naral ilock~; l>rcakwater.-This artificial haruor was visited under letter from "le Ministre Secretaire de la 1\Iariue et des Colonies." The entrance-dock and the commercial dock at tl1e mouth of the small stream on the east front of the towu showed good masonry, in large Llocks of granite, with 110 signs of settling or breaking joints. The docks are badly silted. The large naval docks, workshoµs, magazines, and arscuals are well constructed. The docks were, in part, cut out of the rock, and have bern walled with granite. A1>art from this fine naval dock· yard, which has an extreme length of ~,000 yards and an average breadth of 850, tbe principal object is the great breakwater, which stretches across the roads about 2,000 yards north of the dock-yard, but 3,300 yards north of the piers at the entrance to the commercial dock. This breakwater is laid in water from 33 to 46 feet in depth, with a good passage at either extremity. The western passage is 2,500 yards in width, and tbe eastern passage is 1,050. The ]engtb of the brea.kwat;er is 4~120 ;yards, or two and one-third miles. It prot;ects the anchorage from all winds coming from the northwest to the northeast~ and a large fleet may lie un<ler it in safety. The construction was commenced abont 1784, by placing large wooden caissons, filled with rocks, on the line of the breakwater. This was found to be unsatisfactory, too expensive, and too slow; and after four or ftve years the system of a breakwater made of riprap, or "en pierres perdues," was ~opted. This appeared to have been successful, especially when coped with a thin line of masonry; but in February, 1808, during a heavy tempest, one part of the breakwater, upon which was the "Batterie

Napoleon," was torn away, and over two hundred S()ldiers were drowue1l. The strength of the work was subsequently increased until the breakwater had a base about 300 feet in bread!11; a11d in 1838 it was decided to build a wall of masonry along its crest. \Yhetlter thhi was absolutely necessary as a protection against storms or to sustain the water-batteries that exteml its whole length, is not certain on casual observation. The work was finished in 185:~, an1l t.lie total cost of the breakwater proper, excluding the four casemat ti forts, is reportecl at nearl,\· $17 ,ooo,ono. This is one and a half times greater, per linear yard, thau the Holybeacl breakwater; two and a half times greater than that at Portland; but onc-quarter less than that at .Alderney. It is 011!;1· one· sixth less, per linear yard, than the Admiralty pier at Do\"er. 'I he breatltlt of the llase of the ltreakwater is about tbe same as that at Portland and Holyhea1l, :rntl it prohal·ly '"ould ha\"e suffered less than it hai; done from the destn1cl he ac1 ion uf the Reas h:ul it been coustrncted in deeper water; but as the whole idea of Napoleon was solely to vrotect a naYal a11d not a commercial port, it is more than likely that the position was made sub:<crdeut to tlrn protection afforded by tlle adjacent forts on the east and "·est of the passages aud on the snrroumling heights. The four forts on the breakwater itself mount 174 guns, aud the intermediate water-batteries add 9G more. Brest; naml and cmnmerciaf docks.-The nantl docks and c1epots of Brest on eacll side of the Penfeld ha·e an average width of llO yards. The. rise of tlle hanks is f]llitc sharp and ahout 100 to 150 feet aboye the water. Both sides of tue stn·am, which i8 really a Yery narrow arm of the sea are occupied on the banks and lleights with arsenals, work1-1hop:>, tlock;;, s\Jip-lrnildi11~ slips, depots, llospitals, casernes, &c., of the secontl Ila val dock- yard of Fra11ce. Tbe high iron liriclge-the Pout Imperiale-o\~er tlte Pe11feld, is thP first special object to attract attentioll. It is composed of two flying wings, each pi \'otetl upon a to l\"('l' or pillar of masonry about SO feet above the water. The distance between supports is about 4 L! feet, aud the a.pproaches to carry the counterba!ancing weight each about lOOreet. The breadth is:!::> feet. It is a ligllt, graceful structure, easily moved by three men at each wiug, all(l although the vibration of a few persons passing it is felt, the weight is 750 tons, antl its strength has heea amply tested ; nevertheless, in the form of the angle-iron of the lower chord, there appears an erroneous application of material. The iron-work oftlte bridge cost $282,000, and the masoury, buildings remo,-ed, approaches, &c., cost nearly an equal amount. Another object of intere8t was the economy-crane, for lowering the heaviest machinery and masses direct1y into the vessel from the workshops 011 the heights above (he right bank. A viaduct has been carried owr a single arch of 100 feet span to the pillar containing the machinery for modag the crane. The largest dry-<lock is situated one and a half miles inside the entrance to the Penfold, on the right bank. It is 715 feet in length and 80 feet in width, divided into two parts by a middle gate so as to be used as two do;.;ks, if necessar.r. All the gates are of iron, and are so constructed as to be floated and mo>e<l about in a Yertical position. The condition of the masonry of the quays along both banks of this naval port indicates that the foundations are not good; and at two of the ship-building slips the foundations hatl, at one time, actually slippe1l away in part; but by going to the " I.led-rock" for foundation 110 difficulty is experienced. But the most instructive work visited was for the improYement of the commercial harbor and docks just eastward of the Penfold, and founded in 18::>8. The road of Brest not being capacious, jt has been deemed necessary to build a breakwater in front of tlle new commercial quays and docks. But this protection is crowded so close upon the quays, that at the western head there is a passage.way of only ninety yards between it and one of the quays. The passage at the western head is bot a little wider, and the dockage for vessels is very limited in extent. The bottom of the road or bay under the shore-line is mud of several meters in depth, as marked on the accompanying rough sketch (illustration No. 30, sketch 4 A.) In constructing the front -wall of the quay, a considerable depth of this mud was dredged away, but a depth of 10 feet was left above the hanl bottom. Upon the inner line of this dredged section a base of riprap was _laid, having a breadth of 33 feet and a height of 12 feet. Upon this was then built the masonry wall, as shown in the same sketch, which exhibits a cross-section of the work. Earth was then filled in behind this retaining-wall to the required level. The mu<l nuder tbe earth, yielding to the superinefimbent mass, was forced against and ullder the retaining-wall and carried the wall forward with it.

At one place, part of the wan V1as 325 feet from its position. The progress of this movement was regu1arly observed and measurements were taken to exhibit the canting of the wall and its actual change of place. To remedy this mistake, the mud was dredged to the solid bottom of the bay, and a riprap laid having a breadth of base 131 feet (illustration No. 30, sketch 4 B) and a greater depth than the first one. The retaining-wall was then built upon the outer edge of the upper part as before. To the end of 1873, the total cost of improvements bad been $3,072,000 (16,383,000 francs). According to the plans, the present works exhibit 3,380 yards of dock and quay frontage, and at the foregoing rate of expenditure will certainly reach $1,000 per yard of frontage before the work is closed. lt is the most expensive piece of work examined in Europe; but it has already been proposed to enlarge the scheme, and to continue the docks and quays to the eastward, without a prolongation of the breakwater. Along the quays railroad-tracks are to be laid, and turn-tables at every change of direction, and large store-'honses are to occupy the quays. '.l'lie Admiralty pier, Dover; a breakwa.ter of masonry; how constructed; illustrations; oost.A t DoYer, Mr. Druce, the resident engineer of the Admiralty pier, exhibited sections of the pier as modified during the last twenty-five years. The pier, as it now projects from the western part of the old contracted barlwr-pier, is but one part of a ;ret undetermined project to build a great artificial harbor. In ordinary south westerly winds, small steamers find protection on its northeasterly side; but in heavy 11ortbeasters they must seek shelter under the southwesterly side. The main idea in building this breakwater is that it shall be of solid masonry, and present a nearly vertical wall to the action of the waves. It is constructed in the very best manner, and at the close of e:lch season's work the unfinished extremity of the pier is left without special protection until the next spring. The first section of the work has au outer shell (A) of grau_ite (illustration No. 30, Sketch 5), of which shell the blocks below low water were not cemented; next inside this is a line of rubble (B), and within that a hearting of concrete (C), all carried down tothe hard chalk. The plastic chalk overlying the bard, although so tough as to make its removal comparatively expensive, was cleared away. The batter of the walls was l foot in 4, and has been gradually changed until it is now 1 foot in 12, with more satisfactory results in regard to the action of the water; practically, the walls may be considered -vertical. The form of construction of the three parts, A, B, and C, was modified as the Ilier advanced; and the rubble (B) was replaced by solid masonry, and the inner faces toward the hearting were made vertical. As the work advanced, the hearting was abaudoned, and the whole pier is being carried out with solid blocks of sa·ndstone, but faced with granite. The wor!r was advanced during winter below the low waters, so as to be beneath the reach of the heavy wave-action. During summer, the upper part is carried forward; but at present the work is suspended. Divers in armor are only employed incidentally on aecount of the turbid waters and the strong current from the northeastward, especially during hea\'Y weather. All the blocks are set, and nearly all the work is done by the aid of the diving-lJells, which are of such size as is found by experience to be the most advantageous, and the blocks are of such size that they cau be readily managed from the diving-bell. Bven iu heavy weather the work can be carried on in this way at the greater depths by ftrst rapidly lowering the diving-bell with the men and the blocks through the troubled water, and then lowering more slowly toward the bottom. I11stead of large blocks the engineers especially favor smaller aml more readily handled blocks below the water-level. They can be better set and cemented. The cement is one part Portland to three of lime, and is very hard. The scaffolding from which the bells and blocks are lowered has been gradually increased as the pier advanced so as to be above the reach of the waves; since the abandonment of the work, the scaffolding has been removed. The extremity of the pier is now 700 yards out, and just includes the enlargement on the inner face for an iron turref-fort with two heavy guns. It is iu 45 feet water at low tide, and there is not a. sign to indicate settling or rupture. The top breadth is 45 feet, and the top of the parapet is 40 feet above the level of low water, the tides rising 19 feet. The parapet, which was to be -solid masonry, has been modified so as to admit traffic in <iombination. with the two railroad termini upon the pier; it now has the general aeetion indicated in illnstra.tion N0. 30, sketch fi. The uppet' footway of stone flooring upon iron plates is supported on one side by the wall,

and on the other by a line of iron pillars; and the space l>eueath is open for traftic. There is an iron railing on the inner side of the parapet footwalk, and also upon the edge of the pier. This open spaee was to have been solid, but the engineer thinks the modification qnite strong enough. The parapet is finely dressed granite from Cornwall, tllis extra fiuisll being added by order of the Admiralty. It is estimated that tile ordinary smooth work on the inuer edge and the top of the blocks adds only 2 per cent. to the cost of ordinar.Y work; but the additional expense upon the parapet must be mucit greater. The roadway is in Belgian blocks of about 3 inches by 12 on the surface; tltey are well laid, and the interstices small. The be.ton works arc at the inner edge of the pier. Uost.-The work is unquestionably good, but the cost is very great. Exclusive of $120,73ti paid for work on the fort, the 700 yards already completed to Mi feet at low water has cost $3,36I,4:l3, or $4,802 per linear yard." According to a scheme presented to Parliament, in the session of. 187 4, for the completion of tlrn whole Dover harbor-works, piers of a total length of 2,311 yards additional am required. Should they cost at the sarne rate as that alreatly built, the whole work would demand an expenditure of $14,500,000. Although the wa\es aud heavy driYing spray frequently cover the parapet in southwesterly winds, it is never exposed to such seas as are experienced on the Northern Pacific coast in winter, or even to the heavy groundswell of northwesters. Portland breakwater j riprap ; description; WustmtionR of aoss-section ; co.l't.-This work differs totally in character from that at Dover. Tllis is a great dike of pierre perdue (riprap) dumped upon a given line until raised above the le>el of tlle sea, anll ha,·ing its cross-section shaped by the action of the waves. Tlae first impres8ion reuei\'ed is that the seas which fall upon this breakwater are uot such as fall 011 the Northern Pacific coast in winter, or eYen like seas raided by our strong northwest winds; because the comparath·ely small blocks would be toru away and driven or rolled over into the harbor, and the very pillitr-scaffoldiug, which remains just above the stones along tlie water-edge, would be broken off, notwithstanding their shortness; and yet it is said at Portland that a very heavy swell does break upon and over, and at times lifts the !.>locks. On the seaward face, exposed to the southeast or line of greatest exposun'l, the finer material of the breakwater is driven out; but on tl.ie inner slope this is packed in with the larger. The irregular mas8es of rock appear to average barely cubic yards. As taken from the quarry, they range in weight from one ton to five tons. The breakwater stretches from the northeast part of the Great Heall of PorUaml toward tlle eastuortheast into 10 fathoms of water, and then stretches to the north in about the sa1ue de1ith. The total length of the outer breakwater is 6,500 feet, and of the inner 1,900 feet, with a 9z-fatlwm p:isSllge 400 feet in width between them and just inside of the curve. It is a succes8ful work. The original project contemplated the building of a line of masoury and parapet 011 the inner edge of the breakwater, from low water to near!;y 30 feet above high water. Bnt there is only a line of this parapet-wall on the inner breakwater, and it is not intended to add anything to the onter length. Upon the inner side of the wall of the inner breakwater there is it coaling-station for men-of war, but it is not now used. So far as the lines of scaffolding remain in the line of the breakwater, aud as the cross-sections show, there has been very little change in the pier; but additions were made to the sea-fa<ie as the whole cross-section fell into shape. A good proof of stitbility is seen in the small amount of yearly expenses, the pa.r of men, repairs, and maintenance being only $'..l,425. The annual appropriation for "storm-repairs" is only $900. .At Plymouth breakwater the auuual repairs cost from $25,000 to $30,000; and they are much more at Alderney. Along the inner side of the breakwater a tram-way is to be laid abo,·e !ugh water to perm it a movable crane to readily traverse its length and replace blocks that may be drirnu inward by the storms. The heaviest effects of the gales are upon the bend of the outer length of the break water, but no special widening bas been found necessary. The walls and the rnasoury foundation of the fort have been badly cracked, but the plans show that this heavy mass of masonry, 100 feet iu diameter, was built upon the riprap deposits made between April, 180:3, arrJ June, 18ti3. The riprap is 20 feet thick under the masonry at low water. Cost of breakwater.-The breakwater was 'l'"irtually completed a~~~-t IS65,_a~<l_'1_1_J___t~1869 ~s

eost had .been $4,478,000, or $1,742 per linear yard. This is a little more than one-third that of Dover pier and two-thirds that of the Holyhead breakwater. Ilut it should be borne in mind that the stone was qnarried in the hill directly over the works; that the loaded damp-cars were carried down by gravity, and the empty ones drawn up by those descending, and that a large amount of convict-labor was utilized, as it is there to-day. Two cross-sections are here given of the breakwater (illu11tration No. 30, sketches 7 & 8), exhibiting the satisfactory manner in which it has maintained its form. That numbered one hundred is taken near the bend where the heaviest seas break upon an cl over it; that numbered two hundred and sixty is very 11ear the fort. At both points, the depth of water outside the breakwater is 10 fathoms at low tide. These may be advantageously compared with the cross-section of the Hol_yhead breakwater. The noteworthy, almost identical, form indicates that the same general laws have been at work shaping the masses, notwithstanding the latter has·slightly the larger cross section and the wall of masonry. From these aud other examples it maj· be possible to deduce the law of cross-section for riprap breakwaters, and the most favorable depth of water for building, under varying conditions. Refuge.- While examining this structure, a count showed thirty-three large vessels at anchor from the bad weather outside; on t~e day before, there had been about one hundred and fifty craft of all sizes. Holyhead breaku:ater; riprap and icall of masonry; description; cost; illustration.-Tbis great breakwater is similar to that at Portland, except that it carries a wall and parapet of masonry its entire length upon the harbor side. .From a full description of the work by Mr. Harrison Hayter, for the institution of civil engineers of London, only the main features of the work and a tracing of the cross-seetion will here be gh·en, as kindly furnish eel by that gentleman (see illustration No. 30, sketch 9). The break water bas a total length of 7,860 feet, and em braces a sheltered romlstead of 400 acres, besides the in11er or" New Harbor" of 267 acres. The original conception of the work was due to Rendel, and al thong b em bracing only the 267 acres just mentioned, was con side red a very bold and even wild undertaking. Yet this was found inadequate for the necessities as a harbor of refuge for which it soon became invaluable. The original breakwater stretched 5,360 feet into 8 fathoms of water; the recently finished prolongation ~f 2,500 feet runs into 9 fathoms of water. Ver~- fortunately for such a great undertaki11g the stone used in the construction of the work was obtaiued as at Portland, from an adjoining hill, and was readily conveyed to the line of the work. The material is a quartz-rock. The operations in quarrying, among the 1argest aml most interesting that bad been umlertaken, 11eed not be detailed here. The stone was dmnped into the sea from 250 iron tipping-cars, running over a temporary wooden scaffolding. The inclination giveu to the foreshore was 1 iu 7, and this was supposed to continue 10 feet below the low-water level, after which the material would assume a slope of 1 in 2 for the next 15 feet. of depth; and then 1 in lJ! to the bottom. On the harbor side, the slope was 1 to 1. At the lower-water line the breakwater was to have a breadth of no less than 250 feet; aml in 50 feet of water the breadth of the base was 400 feet, or 80 feet more than that of Portland in 60 feet of water. These conditions have become somewhat modified, and the existing foreshore slope between high and low water is 1in12. The breakwater contains 7,000,000 tons of rubble-stone, and after it had become consolidated the superstructure was erected. The main object of this wall is to shelter the inner harbor more effectually, and to pre\"'ent the loose rocks from washing into the harbor. Of coarse, the seas cannot be so great here as at Alderney, where rooks of 10 tons are lifted over the 40 feet wall and deposited inside. Th*' wali bas been designed so that jetties may be thrown out therefrom in order to afford convenient wharfage space if this is ever needed. It is a solid central wall of masonry built or quartz-Atones, many of them of very large size, some weighing upward of 15 tons, and the work is set in Has lime mortar. Tile foundations are laid at the level oflow waMr, for which purpose the rubble had to be excavated ; and it was built as near the inner ooge of the breakwater as practicable in order to alluw as long a foreshore as po1<sible. This solid barrier is carried to a height of 39 feet above low wa.tet; npon this is a handsome promen!l.de, protected on the seaward side by a massive parapet. At a lower Jernl, 27 feet above low wat-0r, there is on the harbor side of the main wall a terrace or quay 40 feet broad, formed by an inner wall built a.t a di.sta.uee from the maitt wall, and the interspaoo is filled with suitable material. The bead of the breakwater is a massive stru.ctnre 100 feet Jong arid 00 feet. ~. ~Ii i,;

founded upon the rublile at a level varying from 20 feet to 28 feet below water, and is built of ashlar masonry. The blocks composing it are of limestone, and were laid by divers with helmets. Upon this bead is placed a red revoking dioptric light of the tllird order. An average of 3,uOO vessels yearly seek this harbor for refuge against storms. l<'ew harbors possess greater facilities for entering and lea>ing; and the holding-ground is good. The cost of this north breakwater and the works connected therewith, including land, has l>een $6,~32,250, or $2,608 per linear yard, being nearly $1 per ton of rock i11 the rip rap. There are no extensive repairs required, and there has been very slight wear up to date. TlJere is a slight littoral movement to the northeastward along the line of the extension. The present Holyhead and Dublin packet-ser>ice leaves the pier at the old harbor, where there is only 14 feet of water, but the western part of the inner or" new harbor n has 30 foet at low tide. The geueml cross sedion of the breakwater is very nearly identical with that of Portland; lmt there are certainly heavier and more violent seas at Holyhea<l, as indicated by the necessity for the masonry wall and br the flattening of the foreslJOre, from which part of the material has been driven to the wall, and part washed dowu into deeper water. Alderney brealw:atcr.-Iu regard to this breakwater the general opinion of engineers is that the whole riprap has settled or sunk irregularly, so that the superstructure which was built upon it bas been broken. This result lrns been partly aided or llastened by the peculiar shape of the cmss·sectiou, but the lower courses of masonry in the wall were laid without cement. Drawings of tue cro8s and longitndiual sections (illustration No. 30, sketches 10 and 11) exhibit the peculiar form of the bottom upon which it was laid, and 'the exceptional form and relative smallness of the cross-section. Even when the wall was under construction, "subsidence was the inevitable result of setting e>en a single course on the top of ~his great embankment. The walls l>y their weight compressed like a sponge the mass of loose stones below them."* Bnt the form of this wall is singularlydefective; ''the part of the superstructure above low water is_ solid; tlie part below low water consists only of two side-wans, the sea-face of which batters at a very considerable angle." "Between these walls is loose rubble not consolidated i:iven by the action of the waves." "There is, therefore, a solid wall standing upon two props, as' it were; and these props rest on a spougy mass."* Not only did the settlement of the ripra.p tend to split this wall vertically in its length as well as crossways, but, as if to accelerate the destruction, it appears that the large stones intended to form a covering to the dike of stone upon which the wall is laid, as well as to other additions to the dike, were thrown from the top of the wall into the sea, and in falling struck the proje~ting courses of the wall, cemented and uneemented, and loosened them. It only required the destructive action of the sea to hasten the dislocation of the whole wall. The manner in which the great dike of rubble-stone W'ls laid was wholly different from that at Portland and Holyhead. Here the stone was of all sizes, from four tons to less than an ounce; IJrought in "hopper barges" from the quarries on the island, and dropped ou the line of the breakwater. From reliable data, the resident engineer calculates that the interstices in the great mass are equal to one-third of the whole volume. From the manner in which it was dropped 1 tbis material took the natural slope from a surface breadth of 15G feet, at a depth of 12 feet below tlie low tides. At this beiglit it remained until it was snpposed to be consolidated by the sea. This height for the rnbble embankment was decided upon from observing that the heaviest seas rarely disturbed the surface of the rubble. Upon this surface the masonry was laid and built as described, and the effoct of ihe superstructure has oeen to sink an average of 4 feet into the loose mass beneath it; and the irregular subsidence bas brokoo the wall in every direction: At the same time it must not be overlooked that the position and locality of the breakwater are particularly and peculiarly expm~ed. The whole ground-swell of· the Atlantic breaks fairly and squarely upon it with great fury, and for months at a time it bas been impossible to carry on any work. For fonr hours nea.1· high tide the greatest weight of the green se:ts comes over it, bat the damag.e to tbe wall does not then take place, as they pass clean iuto the harbor with a.

leap. For four hours toward the last of the low tide the heaviest blows are given to the wall; the waves throw sl1eets of water a mile in length and 300 feet high as they strike the wall. And such is the power of the down-falling mass of water that the rails laid upon the wall, with only one inch Pxposed, are torn away. I.arge blocks are "drawn out" of the seaward face of the wall, and the heaviest stones are swept bodily o>er the parapet into the harbor. The action of the sea upon the rubble embankment, when it was carried 600 ,yards in ad\·ance of the wall, was wholly difforent. 'Yhen the ground-swell (even without wind) was heavy 1 the rollers began to comb in 50 feet of water on the west slope of the breakwater, and they broke in 30 feet from end to end. But the breakers on top of the embankment, when its level was 12 feet below the surface, were overhanging walls of green water from 12 to 15 feet in Height, and they died out gradually from 100 to 150 yards to the eastward o.f the termination of the wan. Various projects have been proposed to remedy the inherent defects of construction, but none bas b11en decided upon. Tlrn principal remedy is doubtless more material to the foreshore, up to the height of the top of the wall, until it acquires the natural slope under such circumstances: the removal of the parapet and additional material to the inside. The {irincipal stress for this failure has been laid upon the settling of the rubble embankment aml the weak section and construction of the wall and parapet; yet the longitudinal section must not be overlooked, showing the irregular slope of the bottom, and the extraordinary depth of 13'.! feet at low water (and 150 feet at high water), to which it has been carried with such a minimum of poor material. In the Holyhead and Portland breakwaters, the depth may be said to be nearly uniform; here the grade is larger, and there are irregularities of bottom. In the latter cases, the wa\'e-acbon must be more uniform in character; iu the former, the reverse will be the case. The present breakwater appears to be one of six schemes proposed, the fifth and sixth carrying the work to great depths; but progress was arrested, and only such additional work done as to preserve what had been built. In order to provide greater strength at the extremity of the pier, the masonry for 60 feet in length bas been founded 30 feet below the low-water line. It is faced under water with granite headers round the extremity and on the harbor side, with backers of I'ortland cement blocks, built solid across, between the sea and the harbor walls. The total length of the breakwater is 4,827 feet, and, so far as could be learned, it had cost not less than $8,500,000, or $5,480 per linear yard.
CONCLl:SIONS.

The practical question that naturally suggests itself after an examination of the foregoing harbor works, and looking at them with special reference to the construction of harbors on the Pacific Coast, is: What is the best and most readily-applied form ot breakwater for the smallest amount of money 'I Those who know tlie Pacific coast can readily understand that a perfectly safe breakwater of any form that would satisfy the conditions required for a breakwater in the Bay of Sau Peclro would not fulfill the conditions demanded at Crescent City or Port Orford. At the first-mentioned ro:1dstead, the only disturbing gales are from the southeast during the rainy season; and very moderately-sized vessels with good ground-tackle can ride them out with safety. In that latitude the gales are not severe, nor are they of' ,·ery long duration. A.t San Pedro, or at almost any point south of San Francisco, the form of breakwater at Portland would suffice, and it could be readily constructed. But -at Port Orford, where very heavy December storms prevail from the southeast of one and two weeks' duration, the· proper form would he that of the Portland breakwater, developed to a much greater section and of larger materials; or tllat of Holyhead, also of larger section and with its expensive superstructure of masonry. And in case a wall were necessary, no vertical face whatever should be exposed to the sea-front if the wall is Ii.able to rupture. Without considering the matter of cost, if the foundations were perfectly reliable, in almost every case the nearly vertical solid masonry wall, as at Dover, would give the greatest degree of safety for the least amount of material. Bllt when questions of expense and of facility and rapidity of execution are involved, the riprap forms have great claims to be oonsidered. For instance, there is hardly a southerly·exposed anchorage on the Pacific coast of the United States that is not commanded by high, rocky heads, from which material can be readily and cheaply obtained, and transported by gravity to the works. There is a comparative scarcity of granit.e and lime·

And it shonld not lrn overlooke1l tlrnt the peculiar c1ualities of the rock, including- the forms it t;d~es in quarrying·, lrnn\ an impn!'ta11t bearing upon tbe wear and tear of the foreshore, and especially tlw liability of the blot;k8 to be rea<hly torn away. The foundation for solitl wa1ls must he perfect, otherwi,.;e they shoulll ne,·er be use1l in g-reat works. The piers of t11e North Sea harhor of Amsterdam demonstrate the weaknes,;; of tlie solid Yt>rtical pier when the foundation is uureliablt>: the pier at DoH~r :show1; its full ad nrn t age,; \\hen over a satisfactory bottom. The North Sea lmrhor piers have become merel~- a rPtaining--wall for the ripra(> of coucrpte blocks upon the seaward face; and should their integrity be further injured, they will become, in time, part and parcel of tlJe rubble-work it,,.;elf. If the predictions of compett·nt engineers be weighed, the wall upon the Alderney breakwater, unless protected and consULIJtly repaired, will, in time, also be so broken and dislocated as to become part of the picrre perdue formation. Theitem of expense is vital upon such an extcnsi\-e seaboard as that of the United ::Hates, and especially upon the exposed coast of the Pacific; so that althongll theoretical demonstrations might point to the nearly vertit0al solid pier as the best, yet if two safe bre;tkwaters of riprap, or riprap properly coped, can he built for tlrn cost of only one like the Don~r pier, there ca11 bt» no hesitation wbiob form to adopt. It should not be fiwgotten that the piers mentioned and partially described, ha\·e, in ernry case I.Jut, that of Clieruourg, one end anchored to the shore. This does not include Brest, because it partakes more of the character of au inside.harbor work. Although that is a great ad\·:rntage in the execution of the work, it cannot always be adopted along the Pacific coast, because tlrn littoral drift carries its load of sau<l im-ariabl.r to the northwarll, as has been pointed out in a discussion of the law go,·erning the formation of the bars aud channels of the harbors aud rivers on tbe Pacific, from latitude 24 to latitude 49. Tbe depth of water in which breakwaters should be built is a very imporlaut question in regard to their stability, and in the wear and tear. For instance, a breakwater in 5~ fatlwms, 011 tbc bar of Sau Franeisco, or on·tba.t of the Colnmbia River, would bt> almost impracticaule. It could hardly be made of sufficient strength. In 7 fathoms of water it would be on the liue of the heaviest breakers on the coast, altllongh very heavy northwesterly and southwesterly grnurHl· swells have been known to break in 9 fathoms. L1>0king also to the future, wheu onr commerce will have larg-ely deYeloped, the safest and most ad vantageons depth in which to found a ureak· water of the first class, is probably not less than 1() fathoms at low tide. Fascino.ge for breakwater foundations.-Tlle fascinagc-work of the Dutcll eng-incers ha<; IH'CCS· sarily played an important part in all their works of' reclamatiou, and has been introduced i11 tiJe foundations for moles, &c.; but it must be recollected that it has uot been adoptetl from dwicH, but from necessity. The Netherlands is a vast al!m-ial lleposit, in many places below tlw le\·el of tile Rea. Stone for works of construction cannot be had except at immense e:-qwn,;e and time; and timber is not found in sufficient; quantity 01· size to be emplo;\·ed so hHi!lhl,1 all in the United States. Basalt is IJrought from the Rhine, granite from Norway, limestone from HPlg-ium, and timber from the shores of the Baltic. Thus ti.re engineers h:we been co111pdlecl to u"e fa.;ci1mge, and with gre11t success, too, iu many of their undertakings; but it is yet an open question how it will last in extensfre works of engineering, such as that carried on at the mouth of the ~ehetn· to connect Rotterdam with the sea by a channel capable of allmitti11g the largest ocpa.H-Ycssels. ·where they become tlloroughly silted up with sand they may not be liable to destruetiou by animal life, but they are liable to decay. And we han>. .i:et to leitru the effoct" that may be wrought on them by great storms with heavy ground-swell, and b,Y strong currents. As foundations of great works projected into the sea upon the Pacific coast, little or no faith would be accorded to fascinage, except as partially preventing scouri11g during the laying of foundations under peculiar circumstances. No wall could be built upon it without cPrtai11ty of fracture.

United States; but they are there necessitated by the limited harbor area and by the excessive rise and fall of the tides. J'lie structures seem built for a thousand years, and the cost of their repairs is surprisingly low. In 1865 it was stated by the chief engineer of the Liverpool docks, that with a yearly expendirnre of $3,600,000 for new works, the annual outlay for repairs upon all the existing docks was less than $5,000. Bach and every proposed change or addition to a harbor or water-course undergoes the severest scrutiny of a go\·ermnent commission before it is sanctioned by .Parliament; and whatever is in the least detrimeutal to tbe integrity of the harbor or stream is rejected. Rii·er improvements.-Opportunity did not offer for examining the great improvements at the mouth of the Danube or of the Rhone. In the former, the system of prolonging the natural banks by artificial means is reported successful; at the Rhone, similar means were unsuccessful, and the system of side canals has been substituted. 'l'he two rivers arc esPentially different in their constitution. The Danube is not a river that forms deltas rapidly; with its course of 1,700 miles, and a drainage area of 300,000 square miles, it has formed a delta of only 1,000 square miles, and it discharges into a tideless sea. Moreover, the works of the Sulina are chosen upon that ramification where there is but one mouth, through which only one-fourteenth of the Danube waters pass; so that even if the materials in suspension were brnughl. down this branch, very little would be deposited in the month Compared with large delta-forming ri,·ers, the material in suspension is very limited in quantity, and the bars appear to be the combined effects of the littoral drift and the river detritus, as in most of the harbors of CJalifornia. Part of this bar material is brought from the Georges branch across the Sulina mouth by the drift from the southward. On the contrary, the Rhone is emphatically a delta-forming river like the Nile, tl!e Ganges, &c., as demonstrated by the rapid progress which the bar made seaward when the moles were projected beyond its mouth. On this account, the prolongation of the natural banks by artificial means was abandoned, aud the side canals adopted with success. Throughout the countries visited, evidence was everywhere present of the systematic endeavor to preserve the riYer-courses within their legitimate bounds. On the Po, on the Ticino, Sesia, and other torrential streams of Italy, and even among the mountain-streams, provision has been made to prevent the wearing away of alluvial banks, and as fa.r as practicable the overflowing of arable lands. So through Austria and the German Empire. Even where the Danube is little more than a creek, its banks are in many places revetted with stone; and in some cases the bottom is paved roughly with stone to prevent erosion where the fall is considerable. From IAnz to Vienna the banks are well protected wherever there is danger of abrasion. At Vienna, a few months after the official opening of the improved channel, the engineer-in-chief was preparing a full set of plans and models to illustrate the improvements and works, for the Austrian section of the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. On the Elbe, the Moldan, and the Rhine, on the Oeler and the Weser, tile integrity of the banks and the preservation of the channels are paramount objects of solicitude to the government and to the people. The improvements (corrections) have evidently been made at comparatively small expense, and yet with such good judgment and foresight as to lead to the happiest results. The improvement&_ of the Seine at Paris and of the Thames at London, more especially the embankment upon the latter, are not only works of utility, but are also public ornaments. Throughout all no timber iR used where permanency is demanded.

APPENDIX No. 19.
FORltIULLE AND FACTORS l'OR THE COMPUTATION OF GEODETIC LATITUDES, LONGITt:DES, AXD AZIMUTHS.

·when we know the geographical co-ordinates of latitude and longitude of a point on tlrn earth's surface, an<l the distance and azimuth to another point, we may treat the problem of computing the latitude and longitude of the second point and the reverse azimuth in two different ways. We may either solve the spheroidal triangle formed lJy tue two points aud the pole as a whole, arriviug at trigonometrical functions of the sought co-latitude, azimuth, and differeuce of llmgitude; or we may seek expressions for the differences of the sought from the given data. The former or direct method has the incon venieoce of requiring the m>e of teu places of decimals in the computation, in order to give the positions with a degree of exactness corresponding to that of the known distance between the two points, while the second leads to very c011ve11ient expressions, on account of the smallness of the differential arcs in most cases of triaugulation. When, however, the arc between the two points reaches seYeral degrees in length, the direct method must be resorted to. This solution has been ver,y completely 'and elegantly performed by BESSEL, and is given in Astronom. Nachrichten, No. SG, 1826. Adopting tbe second method, we follow in the main PUISSANT ( Traitc de Geodcsie),* in the development of the difference of latitude of two points on the spheroid in terms of the distance, azimuth, and latitude of the given point. It will be convenient first to recall tbe expressious of several lines of an ellipse in terms invulYing the latitude, L, which is the angle that the normal to any point on the ellipse makes with the major axis. Designating the major or l"quatorial semi-axis by a, the minor or polar semi-axis lJy b, then the ellipticity or ratio of their difference to the former is-

The radius of cnrvatnre, H, and the normal, N, are the principal functions used. in geodesy. It will be observed that radii of curvature for uifferent latitudes do not intersect uule;;s produced, and that when they lie in uiff,~rent meridian planes on ihe spheroid they will not interRect at all. A, B, in Fig. 2, are two points on a spheroid of revolution, having the latitudes L, L', and joined by the geodetic line .AB = s, making the angles with the meridian, PA B = 180° - Z, PB A = Z' - 1800. The azimuths, Z, arc reckoned from south around by west in consequence of the latitmles being reckoned from the equator toward the poles, by settled custom, without which the meridional co-ordinate of a point would be more properly measured from the pole, and the azimuth of a line reckoned from the north. The angle APB, between the two meridiomtl planes passing through A and B, is the difference of their longitudes, :\I, M', which heiug reckoned positive to the westward, we ha,·e l\[' - :\[ = 1ZJ\I. Furthermore, An, Bn', Ar, Br', indicate the normals N, N', and the radii of curvature in the meridian, H, H', at the points ~1 and B. This being premised, and the latitude L of the point A Ji.'irf', 2 ~ being given, as well as the length K of the geodesic line AB, and its azimuth Z, we propose to find the latitude L' of the point B, the angle dl\1, and the reverse azimuth Z', by solving the geodetic triangle AB P. Writing A., A.', for the co-latitudes, .; for 1800 - z, ands for the arc AB, referred to radius = 1, we have, in a spherical triangle, for J.' the following equation : cos A.' = cos .i. cos s + sin .i. sin s cos .; Observing now thats is always a small arc, rarely exceed· ing 1°, and generally less tLian 30', we can develop the incre· ment of ;, with reference to that of sin a rapidly converging series, and will have, by Taylor's theorem-

It will be readily seen that the first term expresses the distance on the meridian PB from B

parallel passing through A; white the third term is a further approximation, and so on. Referring now our case to an imaginary sphere, having the radius equal N, or its centre at the point where the normal An intersects tile polar diameter of the spliernid, we have,_K s -- N

This difference of latitude is, however, referred to a sphere whose radius is N, and requires still to be transformed by referring it to one whose radius is the radius of curvature in the meridian for the middle latitude, Rm. Since we do not at first know the middle latitude, it is more couYenient to refer to the radius of curvature R of the starting-point, the latitude of which is known, and then seek the small correction 1lue to tl,le ratio of R to Rm

Multiplying, then, equation (c) in seconds of arc, we get-

which formula, although of a somewhat complicated derivation, is very simple and convenient iu practical computation, with the aid of the tabulated factors, B, O, D, E. (1 ) The term (a L) 2 D is here interposed between the second and third terms of the series proper, because the latter is frequently not required, being insensible when the distance K is less than about 10 miles, or log K in metres less than 4.23 The term (a L} 2 D should be used whenever log h exceeds 2.31, and h2 may be used for(<~ L) 2 in all cases where log K does not exceed 4.93 The term depending on the fourth differential co-efficient, neglected in equation (a), never exceeds 0".001 for s = 1°, or K = 100,000 metres, and may therefore l:>e safely neglected in practice. For secondary triangulation, and when the sides do not exceed about 12 miles, or 20,000 metres, the formula (1) may be advantageously reduced to the following:

The tables are based upon the supposition that the earth is a spheroid of revolution, having its equatorial semi-diametera = 6 377 397.2 metres its polar semi-diameterb = 6 356 079.0 metres and, consequentlya : b = 299.153 : 298.153 as derived by BESSEL, in Astronom. Kachrichten, Nos. 333 and 438, 1834, from the arcs measured up to that 1;me. All geodetic computations hitherto made in the Coast Survey have been based upon those elements. Very considerable additious have, however, since been made to our knowledge of the figure and magnitude of the earth. Their latest combination is that made by Col. A. R. Clarke, R. E., of the British Ordnance Survey, and' published in "Comparisons of Standards of Length, made at the Ordnance Office, Southampton, 1866." He fiudsa

He also finds, by elaborate comparh1ons, tbat1 metre = 39.370432 inches

which may well be taken as the most accurate value now known. The tables of the factors A, B, C, D, E, may be readily conformed to the Clarke spheroid b~· applying the corrections given on pp. 366 and 367; and ditferenc~s of latitude and lougitude may at once be transformed to the same by the nse of tlie subsequent table.

U.EPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

THE INVERSE PROBLEM.-There are cases when it is required to compute the distance and azimuth between two points that are gi\·en by tlleir latitudes and longitudes. Thi8 problem is of comparatively rare occurrence, and it has not been fouml necessary to construct special formulre and blank forms for it since it can readily be solved by using those provided for the case heretofore treated. This is done by dividing d l\1 = K sin Z . A' by the first term for d L, h = K cos Z - B, when we get, tau Z = d ~-!,which would gh·e us the azimuth at once if we knew h, d l\1 being given. vVe therefore seek to compute the smaller terms for the difference of latitude, in order to obtain h by 8ubtracting them from the known d L. The only addition to the usual form is the term, log tan Z =log (K sin Z) - log (K cos Z). K will best be taken from the term h when sin Z is greater than cos Z, and from the term d M when the reverse is the case. vVhen the distance K is large, as in primary triangulation, it wm be necessary to introduce the correction for d :M due to difference of ratio betwee11 siue and arc, using the form for primary L. M. Z. inYersely, as indicated above.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
FORMULA .AND TABLE FOR COMPUTING THE SPHERICAL EXCESS OF TRI.ANGLES.

In every spheri<1al triangle the excess of the sum of the three angles over 1soo bears the same ratio to eight right angles as the area of the triangle bears to that of the whole sphere. Putting

. r for radms," for the excess, we have h"

= 4area r2 r.'

hence e

area = ---;::;;-·

1n ord er to express" in sec-

onds of arc, we must divide the expression by sin 1 11 · The area of the triangle, when it is small in relation to the whole sphere, as is the case in all geodesic triangles, may be expressed with sufficient accuracy for this purpose by ~ A B sin o, where AB are two sidmi, and c the included angle. We have then AB sin c " = 2 r2 sin 1" In estimating "in a triangle on the terrestrial spheroid, we can refer it to an osculating sphere, the radius of which is taken as the mean of the radii of curvature in the meridian and prime vertical at the center of the triangles. These are respectivelyR a (l - t 2 ) N _ a - (1-e2 sin 2L)i' - (1 - f? siu 2L)t using the notation of the L, M:, Z formnhe. The mean of these two expressions developed, but embracing only terms below the fourth power of e, is ~ (R + N) =a ( 1 - ~ e2 cos 2 L + ..) We have, therefore, for the spheroidal triangle, A B sin o e= 2 a 2 (1 - 2 e2 cos 2 L) 2 sin l" 1 L 2 . 11 , for which we write"= AB sin c x m, and tabulate the logarithms of m = , 2 .z ~a (1-2 c cos~ ) ::;;ml for different latitudes.

l'REFA'.rOHY NOTE.
UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY 0FI<'ICE 1

lVasltington, D. C., July 21, 1877. The great storms which yearly traverse with terrible entugy some portion of tLe vast exteut of s1~a.coast that bounds the United States on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico have caused in the aggregate the loss of mauy tlwus;wds of lives and the destruction of au immense amoimt of property. The most violent of these storms are the c_yclones that origiuate commonly in the Atlantic Oceau near the equator. They pass over the West ludies, carve around by the Gulf of Mexico and Florida, and then sweep the entire coast of the Atlantic iu a northeasterly direction. The freq ueuc_y of' recurrence, and the marked force exerted along the same general conrse, suggest that these cyclones result from the operations of laws that. cout.rol tbe geueral motious of the atmosphere, antl that some understanding iu regard to the mtuse aud time of their occurrence might be gained by research, extended so as to include an area commeusurate with the (hweloped phenomemt; but, until now, it is belie\'ed that uo attempt directed to that euu bas been made. Any knowledge in advance respecting the direction aud rate of uwtiou of these storms would be of incalculable lJenefit to commerce and na\·igation, a.,; well as to the people living along the sea· coasts. Their investigation has, therefore, l>een undertaken in tbe hope that the exact knowledge of the configuration of the coast and of its dangers, giYen to the mariner in the Coast Pilot, may in time be supplemented by iuformatiou concerning the atmospheric disturl>ances to which tlie same region is subject: Mr. William Ferrei, to whom this discussion bas been iutruste<l, and whose pre,·ious i>tudies and special ability peculiarls qnalifY him for the proposed research, presents, in the following paper, the results of an investigation of the mechanics aud the general motions of the atmosphere. This preliminary inquiry will be followed by his investigation of the effects of various disturbances that arn local, as compare<l with those upon which general motions depend. Such d>sturb;lnces give rise to local cyclones, due to uueq ual distributions of temperature in the northern and southern hemispheres. It will be shown also that local disturlJances of equilibrium are the occasion of progressive cyclones. The principles and results developed in the leading part of the discussion will, in a separate paper, be applied for perfecting the formulre and methods to be used iu the determination of baro· metric heights; and, as all the general principles applical>le to atmospheric motions probably apply also to those of the ocean, the discussion will be supplemented by a chapter on the subject of ocean currents. These researches will embody conclusions from the most important parts of a memoir published by Mr. Ferrel in 1859 and 1860 in the "Mathematical Monthly." The memoir appeared necessarily as small detached papers, separated by other matter, in two volumes of that jonrnal, and hence the views of the author attracted little notice u11til extracts from his memoir were quoted in the publications of the United States Signal Service. The reader of the first paper by Mr. Ferrel upon this subject will notice a few slight changes; but it. was to be expected that, in a matter so complex, additiona.l years of study would offer both uew and improved views.

PART I.
ON THE MEUllANIOS -'\ND GENERAL MOTIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.

CHAPTER I.
GENERAL EQUATIONS OF THE MOTIONS AND THE PRESSURE OF '.!.'HE ATMOSPHERE.

1. In making out equations of condition for the motions and pressure of the atmosphere or the sea, where the part under consideration comprises the whole or a considerable part of the earth's surface, it is very importau t that the rotation of the earth on its axis should be taken into account. 'fhis C<tn be most conveniently done by referring each particle at any time to three rectangular co-ordinates whose directions are fixed in space, and thus making out equations between the motions, forces, and pressnres for each of these directions. These co-ordinates thus become a fonetion of the earth's rotation and the motion of the particle relati \'Cly to the earth's surface; and by transforming the rectangular to polar co-ordinates, and expressing the equations in functions of the latter, we obtain equations containing very important terms, depending upon the earth's rotation on its axis. 2. Let x, y, and ;: be three rectangular co-ordinates having their origin at the center of the earth, x corresponding witll the axis of rotation ; also letV = the potential of the attractive force of the earth ; P = the pressure of the :tluid; and k = its density :

then D., V, Dy V, and Dz V are the accelerating forces arising from the earth's attraction, aud

iD.,P,

iDYP, and iDzP those arising

from the pressure of the fluid in the reverse directions

respectively of x, y, and z; an<l hen ~e we have, for the equations of the absolute motions of the fl.aid, regarding the center of the eai,th at rest,-

6. In these equations, there are several terms which are so small that tuey may he neglected in all cases without sensible error. The value of the term D, 2 71 is of the same order, in comparison with g, as the rate with which an ascending or descending particle of air is accelerated or retarded in comparison with the rate with which a falling body iu vacuum is accelerated; since, putting P = 0 in the first of the equations (8), we get g = - D,2 h. In all ordinary conditions of the air, tht> vertical velocities are so small, and these velocities are accelerated or retarded so g-radually, that the value of D,2 k corresponding to these accelerations or reta.rdations, iu comparison with tlie rate of acceleration of a falling body, is so small that it may be neglected. In the case of a toruado, the value of tllis term might be sensible through some part of the height of the atmosphere; but, as the velocity of an ascending body cannot be accelerated in one Jlart of its asce11t without being retarded in another part, the integration of this term through the whole height of the atmosphere would be naught, and hence it would not affect I' at the surface of the earth. If any part of the atmosphere has a vertical acceleration or retardation of velocity e<i nal tog in 100 seconds, or a little le!'ls than two miuute,s, then the pressure or value of P arising from this part of the atmosphere is affected the one-hundredth part; and, in such a condition of the~ atmosphere, in determining heights from barometric Jlressure: the results would be serionsly atlected. But such conditions could onl.'> take place under some extraordinary disturbances of the atmosphere, when any such determinations would not be attempted. It is seen from the first of (8) that the pressure is diminished when the ascending velocity is accelerated or descending velocity retanlml, and 'l'ice i:ersa. 7.

in connection with the latter. siu 2

The value of the term (D, r u) is evidently verv · mucl.1 smaller than

D, 11, and hence its effect is always entirely insensible. In the last two of equations (8), the terms containing D, Ji as a factor may llotb b£> ueg1£>cterl _in comparison with the terms which follow them, since the vertical velocity D, h is always ver,r much smaller than the horizontal velocities D, u or D, i·, where these latter are such a:> to gin· a sensible value to the terms containing them as factors. 8. Tile density of dry air is as the pressure and inversely as the amount of absolute temperature. But the atmosphere always contains a certain amount of aqueous vapor which is lighter than air, and affects the density of the atmosphere in proportion to the amouut of this vapor cm1tained in it. This effect is expressed by (1+/( e)) in the denominator of the expression for the density, in which e is the relative amount of aqueous vapor contained in the air. We therefore put(9) k =a P in which, putting ao for the value of a when t = 0 and e (lO)

This latter expression of a may be used in all cases in which the preceding equations are applied to the atmosphere generally, iu which local and temporary deviations must be neglected; lint, in local applications, the former must be used, the value of e being determined from observation for the particular time an<l loca.lity. 9. So far we have 1wglected to consider the e:ffect of friction, which is an important element entering mto equations where the motions of fluids, either elastic or inelastic, are concerned, and one which is most difficult to treat. In the preceding equations, therefore, we must have a term to represent the resistance which each particle suffers from friction, and this term cannot be expressed by any function of the velocity simpl.v, as is sometimes supposed, but it depends rather upon the differences in the velocities of the different strata, and upon the differences of pressure. If a stratum lie between two other strata, all having the same velocity, it suffers no resistance from friction, howe,~er great the velocity may be; and the same is the case where the relative velocities of the strata are such that the action of the stratum above upou the intermediate stratum is exactly equal to the reaction of the lower one upon it in the contrary direction. This may require the relative velocitie8 of the different strata to be different on account of the differences in the amount of pressure, and it, no doul.Jt, requires them to increase as the pressure diminishes, that is, with the height. The amount of resistance, therefore, which any particle suffers, requiring extraneous forci~s to overcome, is generally an unknown quantity, and all that we can do, therefore, is to introduce unknown functions into the equations representing the resistances from friction in the direc· tions of the co-ordinates, and leave these to be determined approximately, where it can be <lone, from a comparison of the final results deduce<l from the equations with observation. If we, therefore, put F,, and F, for the forces acting in the directions respectively of u and 1~ necessary to overcome the resistances of friction, and substitute for k its value in (9), we get from (8), neglecting the insensible terms pointed out in§§ 6 and 7,-

In the case of a homogeneous fluid, it is readily seen that we must pnt 1~ for log P and k instead of a. The value of g is nearly constant; but, when great accuracy is required, it must be regarded as a function of h and o, and we may put(13)

in which P 1 and a' are the values of P and a respectively at the earth's surface, and/ (h) is a small function of h depending upon the decrease of temperature with the height, which may always be neglected, especially when h is small, except in accurate bypsometrical determinations. Where common tabular logarithms are used, the last number of this equation must be multiplied into the modulus M = 0.4342945. The preceding expression gives the difference of the pressure between any two assumed points. If these two points are in the same vertical, the terms depending upon D, u and D, v vanish, and the expression is confined to the first term ; but, it' these points are in verticals a considerable distance apart, the integration of the last two terms, depending mostly upon the earth's rota;tion and the motions of the atmosphere relative to the earth's sorfa.Ce, may give a considerable difference of pressure at the sea-level, or for any two assumed points at equal heights above it.

of cos o. Hence, in whatever dfrection a body moves upon the surface of the earth, there is a force arising froin the earth's rotation which tends to deflect if to the right fo tlw northern hemisphere, but to the left in the southern heuii:phere. This important principle, useful in explaining so many of the relations between the motions and the barometric gradients of the atmosphere, was first published in my former paper on this subject in the "Mathematical Monthly" in the year 1860. It is a generalization of the principle upon which the theory of the trade winds has been hased, according to which this deflecting force, arising from the earth's rotation, takes place only in the case of motions nortl1 or south. But, by the true and more general priociple above, it is seen that this deflecting force is cxa·ctly the same for motions in all other directions. Influenced by the usual theory upon this subject, observers have imagined tliat they have seen e\'idences of a tendency iu rivers running north and south to wear away the banks, and also to deposit drift-wood ou the right- rather than on the left-hand side, and likewise a tendency in the cars of railroads extending north and south to be thrown off the track on the dght- rather than the left-hand side, while in the cases of rivers or of railroads extending iu other directions no evidences of such effects conld be seen. But we now know that if auy sensible effects of this sort arise from this deflecting force in the case of rivers or of railroads running north or south, the very same effects must take place whel'e they run in any other direction. The. amount of tllis force as deduced above, from the true principles of mechanics, is exactly doullle of that which has been obtained from the erroneous principle adopted by Hadley, and brought down through text-books to the present time. This latter principle assumes that the moving body in approaching or receding from the earth's axis must retain the same linear motion east or west, whereas, by the principle of the presenTation of areas, which must hold in this case, the linear motion east or west must be increased iu the formel' case and diminished iu the lattel' in such proportion as to make the deflecting force double of that given by the principle of equal linear east or west motions for all distances from the earth's axis. This matter has been explained in detail in "Nature," vol. Y 1 p. 384. 14. The acceforating force in the direction of q which is adequate to produce a gradient repre· scnted by D" P is1 , (18) }D I:

'"v-ith D, s = 13.889, which is equal to a velocity in the direction of s of 50km per hour, and with 45°, correspondiug to the parallel of 45°, we get 68\ 9 g for the accelerating force in the direction of q arising from the earth's rotation, and hence the lateral pl'essure of a body moving with the assumed velocity in any direction on that parallel is equal to 681:ni of its weight. In the south· ern ht~misphere, where cos o is negative, of course the lateral press1ue is in the contrary direction, that is, to the left of the direction of motion. Where a body is free, this deflecting force produces motion in a curved line. In the case of a tluid, as air or water, this force causes a disturbance of the static level surface, and the amount of gradient resulting from it is expressed by the coefficient of gin (18). For instance, with the assumed velocity above and on the parallel of 450, the gradient woulll be one meter in the distance of 6839 meters. If a river has a velocity of 51tm per hour, the ascending gradient to the right of direction in the

northern hemisphere is one meter in 6839 meters; and hence, if the river is one kilometer in width, the water stands about 6\r of a meter higher on the right than on the left bank. 15. In the case of the atmosphere, in which the gradient is usually measured by the differences of barometric pressure, we get from (9) and (18) for this gradient(19)

D. P

In order to have a numerical expression of the gradient in terms of the pressure and tempera-

ture, and independent of the dem;ity, it is necessary to determine the value of a,, in (11), from which we thus obtain the value of a corresponding to any given temperature t, and that of a'
corresponding to the value of a at the earth's surface, which occurs in most of the preceding expressions, and of which, therefore, it is iruportant to have a determination. The value of u 0 is the value of a in (9) 1Jelonging to dry air, with the temperature at zero (320 F.). If we put l equal to the heiglit of a homogeneous atmosphere of temperature 0°, and pressure, measured by the height of the barometrical column, of om.76, we !Jave for sucll an atmm;phereP = g ko l = g k' X Om.7G

17. Besitles the preceding equations (15) and (23) showing the relations between the motions

and pressure of the fluid, there is still another condition, which must always be satisfied in the case of motions of the atmosphere, which is, that the volume of air which oce11pies an.v given space mast be the same, and the amount of air directly proportional to its density, and the motions of the
atmosphere mt1st always be sucP. as to sa.tis(y these conditions. The m:1.thematical expression of this condition iu any case where 1mch can be formed, is ca1led the equation of continuity.

CHAPTER II.
THE TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AT THE EARTH'S SCRFAC'E OilTAINED FROM OBSERVATfON.

18. In most of the equations of the preceuing chapter there are found two functions, a' at1d it is n1>cessary to determine for all parts of the earth's surface from observation. lt is seen from ( 11) that a. is a function of t the temperature, a' being the value of a corre1;pondi11g to the tempera tu re of the atmosphere at the earth's surface. With the value of t, thereforP, for a 11 parts of the earth's surface, we obtain from (11) the expression of a' in a function of o and ~' and corrneri nentl.v of u and v. from which we obtain the fnnctions D., log,,, and D,. log ,,'. Tile general equations of motion aud pressure of the atmosphere contained in the preceding chapter are of such a chttracter, on account of their complexity, and the unk11o)vn friction ternrn entering into them, tuat they do not ad1uit of a complete solution, and it is therefore importaut to obtain from ohserv<ttion as many as possible of the functions ent<'ring into those eqmitions. If the genernl eqnations co11l1l he completely l'loh-ed, we should ured only the temperature from obsen·a· tion, aml the solnticrn of the equations wonld tlw11 givP the atrnosplieric pressures for all parts of the earth lwlonging to tl.Jis temperature, and we should not 11eed the pressures from Ol)servation, except for a ,-erification of theory. But as it hi, we also need the observed pressures iu the differeut parti; of the earth's suf'face, in order to enable us to ohtai11 other unknown 'tniwtities di'pending upou the:;:c pressures, which cannot be obtained from the solution of the equations. The following tables, I and 11, of approximate temperatures for the two extremes, January and July, ha¥e been obtaine1l b.v interpnlation from Buchan's Charts of Isothermal Lines, with some corrections first applied, to make them agree wit!J recent o1'servations. 'l'he anthorit;r for these corrections is derived mostly from tbe "Contributions to our Knowledge of the Meteorology of Cape Horn and the \Vest Coast of South America," published by the authority of tlle Meteorulogical Committee of London. These contributions gi¥e temperatures generally from four to six degrees higher for these parts than those iudic~ted by Buchan's isothermal lines for July, a111l three or four degrees higher than those indicate1l by his lines for January. As the temperature of the latitude of Cape Horn must IJe very nearly the same for all longitudes, the temperatures of the extreme southern latitudes in the following tal>les have been inc~ease<l ?.ccordiugly all armrnd the globe. The last columns of these tables contain the means of the temperature for all the dif. ferent longitudes. Although the numl>ers given for the difforent longitudes are only appl'Oximatl', alH1 may in some instances IJe cousiderably in error, yet the means of so many longitudes must gfre \'Cry nearly the aveniges of the differeut latitudes of tlie glo!Je, au<l will be sufficieutly accurate for our purpose. Aud the local variations of temperature independent of latitude will !Je only Heeded approximately for explaining in a geneml way the pbeuomena <letlending upon them, awl not for any ac<mrate comparisons of tlrnory with ol>sen'ation.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Tables Ill and IV give the approximate mean annual temperatures for each tenth degree of latitude and longitude and the approximate mean annual range of temperature, and likewise the means of all the longitudes. Tue former have been obtained by taking simply the mean of the extreme mean temperatures of January and July, and the latter by taking the differences of these
extremes. Any one must be struck, from an inspection of Table IV, with the great differences between the mean annual ranges of temperature of the northern and southern hemispheres, arising from the unequal distribution of land and water in the two hemispheres.

Tbe numbers in Tables I aud II being averages for tbe mouths of January and July, aud uot the extremes of the average mean daily temperature, the resnlts of this table require a small correction, which is the difference between the a\"erages of the month and the extreme of the ayerage mean daily temperatures, in order to obtain the absolute mean range of temperature; lJut this correction is quite small.

we get from this equation, with the tifteeu observed v-alues of t, and the corresponding values of o in t!Je first column, fifteen equations of condition for determining, by tbe method of least squares, the values of t0 , a, b, o, antl d. With the values so determined, we get(25)

l·'rorn this expression of t we get the computed values of t in the third column of the preceding table, which satisfies the observations with the residuals contained in the last column. .Although this expression may represent the observations best for the latitudes for which they have been made, yet it cannot be regarded as representing the temperatures very accurately at or near the poles, especially the south pole. 20. In order to obtain the mean temperature of the earth's surface, we must integrate the expression obtained from (24) by multiplying it into sin o am] integrating with regard to o, by which~we get-

The mean of these two results gives 150.67 for the mean temperature of the whole surface of the earth. From Do\'e's Charts of isothermal Lines, which do not extend beyond the middle latitutles in tlte sontlwrn hemisphere, it has been inferred that the southern hemisphere is colder than the northern, aml this has heen the accepted view e,·er since his charts were first published, in the year 1852; but, from the results obtained above, it is seen that the mean temperature of the southern hemisphere is the greater of the two. If, however, we compare the values of t in the precediug table for the two hemispheres between the parallels of 300 north and south, we find that the south· eru hemisphere is the colder of tile two between these parallels; but beyond t.be parallels of ahont 350 t!Ie temperatures of tile southern hemisphere become greater than thmie of tue correspondi11g latitudes of tbe northern hemisphere, so that the average t<'mperature is also greater, as shown ahove. The cause of this is fou11d in the u11equal 11istrihution of land and water in the two hemi· sphert's; for we now know, both from theory and observation, that tllere is a constant, though very slow, interchange of the water of the ocean between the equatorial and polar regions, which tends to diminish in some measure the difference of temperature between these regions, so that iu the southern hemisphere, where there is mostly water, the temperatures of the !Jigher latitudes must be greateor than those of the same latitudes in the uortberu hemisphere, and the reverse for tl1e lower latitudes. The small ditfereuces abo\'6 hetween tb.e mean temperatures of the t-vo hemispheres is perhaps only of the order of the possible errors of these r<'sults, so tllat we can11ot iufer that there is any real d1ffere11ce in the averages of the two hemispheres.· 21. We now come to the subject of atmospheric pre:;sure on the different parts of the earth's surface, upon which t.!1e ''alues of D,, P' and D, P 1 iu the general equations of the preceding chapter depend. This pressure caunot be determined from theory, ou account of the complexity of the equations and the uncertain element of frictiou entering int-0 the:n, and we shall, therefore, endeavor to determine it, so far as possible, from observation. The very valuable aud exbaustin=' paper by Buchan 011 this subject, the "Mt>au Pressure of tile Atmosphere and the Prevailing Winds over the Globe, for the Month aud for the Year," published iu the :\·ear 1869,t left nothing undone which could have been done at the time in the way of dett·rminiug the atmospheric pressure from observation 011 the different parts of the globe; but since that time there has been so great au accumulation of barometrical observatious from almost all parts of the world, that it does not seem proper, in onr present researches ou the subject, not to avail ourselves of these observations, at least in some measure, iu determining this pres!'mre still more accurately for all places from which additional aud more recent observations have heen obtained. It is also thought that the knowle1lg11 which we now have of the relations between the barometric pressures and the velocities and directions of the winds, obtained from tbeor_y and corroborated by observation, can be now nsPd in laying down isoharic lines for those countries and the vast expanse of ocean from which we have none, or at least only a very few, observations, much more accnrately than bas bp,en done heretofore,
*See two papers on this subject by Dr. Ha.no in the" Zeitschriftderiisterreichischeu GesellscliaftfiirMetoorologi'e," Band vii, S. 2tl1, a.nd Band xii, S. 100, which were not seen until a.fter the preeediug results wPre obtained, and in which these results a.re corroborat.ed. If, however, the observations upon which the results outained by Dr. Hann am based h!l.d been on hand at the time, the values oft in '!'able V woultl most probably have been diminisbed a very little in the extreme southern latitudes, and then the results obtained fol' the average temperatures of the two hemiMpberes might have been abont eqnal. t Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xxv.

sincf" much may be inferred with regard to the barometric pressures from the known forces and directions of the winds. We shall, therefore, undertake to make out new charts of isobaric lines, not for e1tcb month, but simpl_y for the mea11 annual pressures of the globe, aull for the two extremes of January and July in the 110rtlwrn hemisphere, using for this purpose all the observations ou band, except iu some parts of Europe, where there is so great an accumulation of them that all were not considered necesi,;ary for our purpose, since, in a general system of isobars for the whole globe, in which, from the scarcity of observations in many parts, there is much that is necessarily hypothetical and co11jectuml, it is not worth while to aim at extreme accuracy in certain cornparative1y very small parts of the surface of the globe. We shall also make out charts showing the aI)nual variation of the atmospheric pressures over all parts of the globe, so far as this can be determined from observation, so that, with the mean :rnnual pressure and the annual variation, the mean monthly pressures may be readily obtained, even with greater accuracy than they can be obtained from charts laiu (lown from monthly averages, for it will be shown that all other neglecte>d inequalities are generally eitht>r insern~i ble, or at least smaller than the probable errors of monthly averages. These charts will be girnn on polar projections of the two hemispheres, since each hemisphere contains a complete system of WilJ(lS nntl barometric pressures which are similar, aml because in such projections there is k8s distortiou of tlrn parts in the higher latitudes, where, in the northern hemisphere, there are some features in the winds and barometric pressures, aud their annual variations, which it is desirable to have more accurately represented than they can be in the usual projections. 22.

\Vitb the values of M 1, Mz, N 1, and N 2 , given by these formulre, we get from the preceding of B 1 , B2, "h and ·2 · 'rbe preceding expression of P is simply a transformation of what is usually called Bessel's formula, in which sines are used, instead of the cosines in the form of expres8ion here adopted. This form is preferable to the other, since from the values of e1 and e2 the times of the maxima of the inequalities _are more readily obtained, and this is made still more convenien· by having tlie constants t 1 arnl s 2 of the angles in the expression negative, as is usual in a.II tidal expressions of this sort, for in this case we have merely to add to the assumed epoch of the timc-angle8 the time which i:s reqnir(·d~for the angles to change by the qnantity <1 or 22 in order to haYe the time of the 111aximm11 of the i11equality. For the annual inequality, we tliYide ' i , expressed in dt>gret·s, hy :m, and for the semi-annual inequality £z by 60, in order to get the time iu months by which the maximum follows the assumed epoch of the middle of December. Thc:preceding formnlro for obtaining Mi, M2 , N 1, and N 2 follow direct!~' from the determination of these quantities by the method of lf\ast squares iu thi> special case of twelve equal dh-isions of the period of the principal inequality. The values, therefore, of the constants B 1, B 2 , 2 1 , and s 2 tlins obtamed are the most probable '>'alues of these constants. The form of (26) can likewise he applied to represent the temperature of the earth or atmosphere itt any place, in which case tlie principal iuequality has an annual period. 111 the case of both atmospheric pressure and temperature, more than two int>qualities need not be considered; for if those of a lower order have sensible coefficients, they are of an order much smaller than the probable t>rrors of the constants determined from obser'>'ation, unless the period of ohservatiou em braces a very long series of years. 23. :\fore conrnnient formnlru for tue rletermination of the constants in (26) may be obtained upon the principle of averages, and the reimlts obtained upon this principle, though differing ~t little from the most probable results ginm by the preceding formul:e, are snfficientl.r acm1rat{.' in all meteorological researches, and tue differences between the rcsult8 of the two 8ets of formula' will generally be _found to be much less than the prolmble errors of tile determinations. If we puta = the a'i'erage of all the observations of P within the limits of 'I' = <p, and 'I' = <fm rp' = the mean value of <p between the limits <p' and 'f", by considering:only the first two inequalities in P (26), ancl supposing tlte obsen·ation t t·quall.r distribute<l in time, we have(27) a= Bo+ k Br cos (<p 1 - <1);+ k' B2 cos (2 rp' - <2)

In this case, the half-period of the angle embraces only three months; and, in order to obtain the value of M 2 , we must use intervals of two months only, so as to have rp' foll in the middle of the interval, and we thus get, since cos 2 <p' = 1 and sin 2 'f' = 0,8 a = 8 k'

If we now take the limits of the alternate intervals "''and <p,,, so that <r' of the first falls on the middle of February, we shall have sin 2 <p1 = 1 in (32) and cos 2 'P' = o, and consequently~ a =~~~=~+~+Sa-~-~-&.+S,+~+~-~-~-~

We therefore get from the preceding expressions of 8 k' M 2 and 12 k' Nz, witlt tlie corre;;pondiug values of k' for each,(33)

Mz = 0.1511 [(81 - 83) + (86 - S,) + (:31 - 89) { N 2 = 0.1309 [(A+ C) - (B + D)]

+ (812 -

810)!

With the values of l\f2 and N 2 given by (33), we get, by the formulrn in§ 26, the values of B 2 and
£2·

It is yery con"enient in practice to obtain by (31) and (33) tlte values of M 1, N 1, and :\I2 , N 2 , from observation, and the values so found arll very accurate when the expression of P ('.!6) is so co11vergent as to make tlte inequalities after the first. two very small or entirely insensible, as is the caRe in meteorology. In a comparison of the values of 13 1 for thirty cases, obtained from series of metPorological obser·ations by uoth of the methods which have beeu g-iven, the average of the differences by tbe two metllods, taken without reg-ard to signs, was only ().13mm, the maximum being 0.39'"m, and in the case of the values of B, the diftereuces were of the same order. Even in cases iu which it is desirable to use the former more accurate formulm of tbe preceding section, these latter will be found a very convenient check within ver,Y narrow limits. '\Vhere the range of angle <f" - <[,, uelonging to a group .of observations of which the average a is taken, is small, the values of k and k' (28) do not differ sensihl.) from unity, :rnd, hy comparin~ (26) with (27), it is seen that the average can be used as the value of the function bclougiug to the middle of the interval, in which the value of cp is <f'· If, l;owever, the range should be considerable, this average must be corrected in order to obtain the value of the function for the middle of the group of observations. From (26) and (27) we get(34)

P

=a+ (1- k) B 1 cos(cp' -

et)+ (l - k') B2 cos (2<f' - cz)

The last two terms, therefore, will ue small corrections to the aYerage a in onler to get the value of the function P for the middle of the g-roup, for which <p = cp'. For instance, if we llad monthly averages, we should have <p 11 - <f'i = 30°, and (28) would give 1 - k = 1 - O.!J886 = 0.0114, and 1 - k' = l - 0.9549 = 0.0451, and tile correction is-

The last term, on account oftbe smallness of n 2 , i8 generally very small in monthly averages. When the range cp,, - cp, is larger, of course these corrections become of more importance. 24. The constant8 in the last columns of the following table ha>e been deduced, by means of the preceding formulm, from the mo11thly means reduced to sea-level and tile gra,·ity of the parallel of 4,50, contained in Rikatchelf's paper entitled " La Distrilmtion de la I'ression Atmospheriquc dans la Russie d'Europe," published in the Hepertorium fiir Meteorologic, Band fr, Heft 1, H. 46, 47.

25. The results coutaiued iu the following table ha\·e been deduced iu the same manner as those of the preceding table from the monthly means of observations given from time to time in the "Zeitschrift der osterreichischen Gesellschaft fiir Meteorologic." These observations have been, iu most cases, collected, re\'ised, and discussed, and, iu many cases, corrected, by Dr. Hann, wi10 has spent much time and labor upon them, and to whom, thereforn, much credit is due, and the references in the following table are to the "Z~it;;chrift f'iir Meteorologie" alone, where references will be found to the origiual sources from which the observation's have been obtained, aud due credit given. These observations include many of those used by Buchan, and also most of the observations made in all parts of the world since the publication of Buchan's paper, alreads referred to. These observations as given were not reduced to sea-level, nor to the gravity of the parallel of 45°. For the former reductions, we have used mostly t,he table on page 91 of Gu_yot's II,n>sometrical Tables; but for all places of considerable altitude, the reductions have been made by the following formula:·
(35)

log P' - log P = 18428 (1

+ o.ou~ t + 0.00001 hJ

in which the coefficient of the temperature tis taken so as to include approximately the effect. of moisture, and in which the temperature is supposed to decrease oo.5 for each 100 meters of altitude. The altitude h in the formula must be expressed in meters. Iu a few cases, the altitudes were not given, and·, where given, there was some uncertainty with regard to the mauuer in which they may have been obtained. If obtained barometrically, as is sometimes the case with altitudes thus given, then the reduced pressures to sea-lewl are simply the assumed pressures at sea·level used in determining the altitudes, and hence are worthless. 111 drawing isobars Oil the charts, however, those results obtained from observatiolls at considerable altitudes, in which there was considel'able uncertainty in the reductions, were not allowed much, if any, weight. Instead of reducing the monthly means to sea-level, this reduction was applied merelJ to tlie mean of tbe barometl'ic pressures Bo given iu the following table, using the mean temperature. This leaves an inequality in the reduction to sea-level, depending upon the annual ineq1mlit.r of temperature, uncorrected, which requires a correction to be applied to the coefficient B1. Tl..ie formula for this correction, as deduced from (35), is(36)
.J, P = .1 B1

= f8428 x

.Jt

x 0.4343 = 2001280

P

Ph .Jt

in which L1t is the variation of the extreme of the mean monthly temperatures iu January or July from the mean temperature, and in which the value of Pat the height

of~ h should

l>e used when

Ii is great. The col'rections given by this formula under the head L1 B 1 in the following table must be applied to B 1, in order to ha.>e the coefficient of annual inequality at the sea-level.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

28. With the values of Bn in the preceding tables, Charts I and II have been constructed, showing the mean barometric pressure, reduced to the gravity of the parallel of 450, for the northern and southern hemispheres, by giving the pogitions of the isobars for each !:!mm, These isobars represent the mean pressunis very accurately in Europe and the United States of America, the greater part of the North Atlantic, and many other plaees where the observations suffice to lay them down accurately; but throughout all the interior of Asia, Africa, and South America, and the greater part of the great oceans, where there are bat few observations, and these not reliable in many cases on account of the uncertainty of altitude above sea-level, and the lack of comparisons of the barometers used with any standard of comparison, of course the true positions of these lines are uncertain, but now here:. entirely conjectural, since we can derive mncb aid from theory and ana1ogy in laying down tbese Jines for tbose p:u·ts of the earth's surface for which we have few or no observations. As reliable observations multiply, and are obtained for those parts of the earth for which we have ,yet no uhservations, of course the positions of the lines as laid down in these charts will be fourHl to be somewhat in error for all places for which we hM·e not yet sufficient observations to determine them; but it is thought that the errors in general will be found to he small. The arrows on these and the following charts denote the prevailing directions of the wind 'J'hese are given, not from ob1:1ervation, but from theoretical co11siderations of the relations betwee11 the gradients and the directions and velocities of the winds, to be explained in a subsequent part of this work. The winds, as represented on these charts, are the resultants of all the winds for the whole year, which can now be laid down more accurately from a knowledge of the isobaric lines than from observations, which in most parts of the earth consist merely in the observation of the relative frequency of the winds from the different points of the compass. The prevailing direction of the wind, as obtained from such observations, may be very different from the resultant obtained b;r Lambert'"' formula from observations of the true velocities and directions of the wind through the year. 29. With the values of B 1 in the preceding tablPs, reduced to sea level by means of the values of J B 1 where the monthly means of the observations were not given for sea-level, Oharts III and JV have been eoustructed, representing the coefficients of tbe annual inequality of barometric pressure over the whole globe. These coefficients are accurately represented by the charts for all portions of the eartl.J where the observations were sufficient for their determination; but, of course, there is tl1('1 same uncertainty with regard to them where few or no observations have been made which tl1ere is with regard to the mean pressures. vVhere the signs of these coefficients as given on the cha,rts are positive, the maximum of the barometric pressure occurs in the winter and the minimum in tbe summer. It is seen from the chart of the northern hemisphere that the.'le signs are mostly positive mi lan(l and negative on the ocPan, especially on the middle parallels of latitude. This arises from the higher temperature of the air in summer and lower temperature in winter ou laud than on tue ocean. The line of no annual inequality of barometric pressure passes over Norway and Sweden and a little east of Lon· dou, touching upon France aml Portugal, having its most southern point in the middle of the Atlantic, a little south of the parallel of 20°, and then, curving northward, p.i.sses over the eastern part of New England in America. On account of tlie great extent of contim·nt aud the great extremes of temperature in the interior of Asia, this coefficient of the annual inequality amounts to about 1omm, or a range of20mm between \'finter and summer, while in America it amounts at the maximum to only about oue·third as much. This difference between .Asia and North America does not depend so muclt uvon the difference in the extremes of temperature of the two countries, which is inconsiderable, as upon the difference in the extent of the two continents. The lines on Charts III and IV represent the gradients which iu winter have to be added to the gradients given on Charts I and II to obtain the gradients for that sea.son, and these in summer al'e completely re'\ersed, and beoee the steeper these gradients the greater are the monsoon influ. ences in the different parts of the globe. These, it is seen, are very great in the southern part of Asia. In the sout.hern hemisphere, on ~ccount of the small extent of land and the small range of temperature between winter and summer, the coefficient of the annual inequality of barometric pressure is small and negative so far as we have observations to determine it, and nearly the same in all longitudes on the same parallel of latitude. Its being negative shows that the maximum

occurs in winter, that is, during the summer of the northern hemisphere. About tue parallel of 55°, this coefficient seems to vanish, heyond which it probably becomes positi·'e, making the maxim nm of pressure in the summer as in the northern parts of the Atlantic and racific Oceans of the northern hemisphere. 30. The values of c1 in the preceding tables are very various, depending upon the want of sufficient observations in many cases to eliminate the abnormal inequalities and bring out the true value, especially in such cases ai:; give a small value of the coefficient Bi. which is often less than the possible error of observation, when the valne of e 1 is of course inrleterminate, and may have any value whatever. Taking the average of all the values of ·i in Table VI uelougiug to coefficients greater than 3.omru, we get e1 = 9°, which makes the maximum of barometric pressure iu Europe occur about the 9th of January, a little earlier than the minimum of temperature. This is perhaps the most probable Yalne of '1 for all stations in Europe, the variations from this value of <1 i11 the dilforent stations being merely possible errors of observation, though the.y may possillly dt>pernl in some measure upon local causes. To this value, the values of ~ 1 for other pJa.ces in Europe in the other tables seem also to point in cases in which the coefficient is sufficiently large for the values of e 1 to be determined approximately from observation. Where stations have great altitude above sea-level, as in the case of Hohenpeisen hnrg in Table VII, the value of · 1 is such as to make the maximum of the barometric pressure occur in summer inst<'ad of winter, in which case we can change e 1 by180°, and consider the value of B 1 as negative. Appl_ying the correction then in the column headed by J B 1 to reduce this coefficient to sea-leYel, it becomes positive, aucl makes the maximum of pressure fall in tbe winter. In the case of Iliihenpeiscnburg, we get - I.9 111 m + 3,3wm = r.4mm for the coefficient of annual inequality, with the value of .- 1 = 228° - 180° = 48°, making the maximum occur after the middle of February. In applying the reduction to sea-level, J Bi, it is supposed for convenience that the maximum of pressurn coincides with the minimum of temperature, which, we have seen, is not strictly correct, l>at the errnrs in these small reductions arising from tuis cause are generally very small. In all cases in which the values of .- 1 are such as to throw the maximum of uaronwtric pressnre into the time of summer of the northern hemisphere, as in the northern parts of the Atlautic and Pacific Oceans and in the southern hemisphere generally, the values of B 1 as entered in the Uharts III and IV are considered negative, and in all such cases the values of .- 1 must l>e dimi11isl1eil hy 18007 or the negative sign of the coefficient on the chart changed to the positi\'e sign if used with the average value of e-1 given by the tables in such cases, which does not generally differ urnd1 from 2000, throwing the maximum of barometric pressure in July. If we take the average of all the values of .- 1 in Table IX, de1luced from the ousen·ations of the Sigual Service of the United States, giving them weights in proportion to the magnitudes of Bi, au<l exclndiug the stations on the Pacific coast, we get 001 = 353° for the stations uort,h of the 1mrnllel of 400 and 2 1 = 3510.1 for the stations south of that parallel; and hence we may pnt for the Uuite<l States, except the Pacific coast, e1 = 352°. ThiS makes the maximum of barometric pressure occur about the 23d of December, and about sixtet'U days earlier than in Europe, aud in both places considerably earlier tllan the tiwe of tbe minimuill of temperatnre. This is most probably caused uy tbe greater amount of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere in the spring than in the fall, which causes the mHximum of baromdrie pressure to be earlier. 31. In addition to the minual inequality of barometric pressure, there is also a ''ery small semiarrnual inequality, as may be seen from an inspection of the columns in the preceding tables beaded by B 2 and e2 · The values of.B 2 as given are mostly of the order of the probable, or, at least, possible, errors of tue results, as may be seen from the scattering values of' and hence <lo 11ot indicate real terms; but if we examine all the larger values of ll2 , we find that tbe corresponding values of ezare such as to indicate real terms, and give a maximum of inequality in the middle of winter and summer, and a minimum in the spring and fall. The coefficient of this inequality seems to be generally less thau I.Omm, but in some places, especially toward the north pole, it appears to be much greater. The average of these coefficients in Table IX, from the obsen·ations of the Signal Serdce of the United States, excluding the stations on the Pacific coast, give for the stations south of the parallel of 350, B 2 = 1.02mm, and the corresponding average of the values of ·2, giving each weight in proportion to the magnitude of the coefficient, is so, indicating ma.xhna about the 4th of January and July. In the same manner, we get for the stations between the parallels of 35° and 40°,

B 2 = o,53mm, and c 2 = 190.6. For those stations north of the parallel of 400, we get B 2 = 0.4Smm and ez = 45°.4. The coefficient, therefore, seems to diminish in the United States with the increase of latitude, and the times of maxima to become later, being, in the northern part of the United States, about the 23d of January and July. 32. lf we take from Charts I and II the mean barometric pressures for each fifth parallel of latitude and each tenth degree of longitude, and take the averages with regard to the different longitudes, we g·et the results contained in the first column, headed B 0 , in Table X, which are the mean pressures for the corresponding latitudes in the first column. It is seen that there is a minimum pressure about 6° north of the equator, a maximum in the northern hemisphere near the parallel of 35°, and in the southern hemisphere near the parallel of 2so. There is also a minimum ;-it, tl1e parallel of 65° in the northern hemisphere, arising from t.be two great depressions of barometric pressure in the northern parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. From the differences of B 0 , with the irregularitif's a little smoothed off, the gradients in the column beaded Gare obtained, which express, in millimeters, the differences of barometric pressure, correapouding to a distance of one degree of a circle having the mean radius of the earth, or 111111 ml'ters. By taking the average~ of all the values of Bil taken from Charts III and IV, for each tenth degree of longitude, we get the icsnlts contained in the fourth column of Table X, from the diffl'rences of which, smoothed off a little, we g·et the corresponding gradients in the column headed b~' g. The8e latter result11, a(lded to those of the mean pressures, give the pressures and gradients for Jan· nary, ancl subtracted give those for July. From what we have seen in § 30, the maxima and minima for the average of all longitudes occnr about the first of these months, and before the maxima and minima of temperature.

With the values of G in this table, the ''alues of D,, P contained 'in Pquations (15), and in expressions deduced from them in tlwJollowiug chapter, are readily obtained. 33. OIJan V shows, b,y isobaric lines, the mean pressure of the atmosphere in the 11orther11 hemisphere for January, in millimeters, reduced to the gra,·ity of the parallel of 45°, anJ, lJy arrows, the prevailing directions, or rather the directions of all the resultants for the month. These latter are iuserted, as in the case of Charts I aud II, from theoretical considerations of the relation" between the winds and the isobars, and not from results deduced from actual:obser .... ations. Chart VI shows the same for the month of July. The epochs of maxima and minima on tile earth's surfa<;e generall_y, from what has been stated, are nearly the 1st of' January and July respectively, and not at the times of the least and greatest temperatures. On the first of these charts there are two areas of great barometrical depres8io11s over the northern parts of the great oceans, and two areas of high barometer over eacb:or the co11ti11e11ts, and consequently having the isobars mostly crowded closely together, with corresponding strong prevailing winds. On the la.st of' these charts, for July, in conse(1ueuce of the re .... ersal of the annual inequality, it is seen that these areas of low and higll barometers are very much smoothe(l off, :uHl consequently the isobars are mnch separated, with corresponding 8mall velocitieR of the pre .... ailing or resultant winds; for the winds in the same latitudes are very nearly inversely aR the distances hetween the ilmbars, as will be explained in the second part of this work. As tne barometric pressures given on the chart are the observe1l pressures reduced to thosl· of the gravity of the parallel of 45°, in comparing obserrnd pressures iu any rmrt of the wor!J with those giYen by the charts, the same red action must first be.111a1le. ~.,The pa.rt of gra\·ity llcpendi ug upou latitude is expressed hy the last term in the expression of g iu (13). Tbe effect upon the height or the mercurial column is im·ersely as that upon gravity, and hence the ol>serYe<l colunm is too low toward the poles and too high toward the equator. The correction, therefore, to Le applied to the observed height for the 1~ressure of o.rn·· is 0.76"' x 0.00284 cos 2 o. wbich cau Le used for all parts of the earth's surface without material error.

CHAPTER

III.

THE GENERA.L MOTIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.

34. U mler the head of "The general motions of the atmosphere" are included all those motions which extend as a sy1;1tem oveL' the whole globe, and depend upon differences of temperature between the equatorial and tlte polar regions at all seasons, and hence they comprise not only the mean motions of the atmosphere, but likewise the changes in these motions depending upon the seasons; but they do not include those motions or disturbances depending upon permanent differences, for the time, of temperature in different longitudes, upon local disturbances of temperature or of density from any cause, or upon tbe irrt>gnlarities of the earth's surface. The conditions to be satisfied in this case are tliose of equations ( 15), in which, since differences of temperature in longitude arc not considered, D,. log a' vanishes, and consequently the last term of the second equation. The complete solution of these equations is im11ossible, both on account of their complexity and the uncertain element of friction entering into them, the laws and the amount of which arc unknown. Many important results, however, may be deduced from their consideration and solution in special cases, from which. approximate results may be obtained lly neglecting the effects of friction, and the latter, with the aid of observation, may be shown in most cases to be very small. If tlie temperature and amount of aqueous vapor upon which a depends were the same over all parts of the earth's surface, D,. a 1 and D. a 1 in (15) would vanish, and it is readily seen that the con· ditions of (15) in this case are satisfied with D, u = 0 and D, v = O, and consequently with a state of re8t and of uniform pressure over the whole globe. And if the atmosphere were set in motion by any exterual impulse, this motion, in tl.Je case of friction, would lie speedily destroyed, and a state of rest ensue. There can be no winds, then, without a disturbance of the static equilibri1lm by means of a di:fference of temperat!tre or of aqueous vapor in different parts of the atnwi;phere. 35. In the case of no friction, where a is independent of longitude, it is evi<lent that P' is likewise independent of longitude, and the first member of the second of (15) must vanish, as well as the last two terms of the second member, and the equation is reduced to-

Since we hM'C 1l = t·

If the initial state of the atmosphere is that of rest relative to the earth's surface, we have i·, and consequently v', = 0. The first member of (37) expresses in terms of the earth's radius the sum of all the ar<>as described in a unit of time hy a line drawn from the earth~s axis to each particle of the atmosphere, and this sum must al ways remai11 tb.e same since no mutual actions of the particles upoi1 f'ad.1 other cau clrnnge it, and the ''elocity of each particle at tb.e same distance from tb.e earth's axis, that i~, upon the same latitude, must always be the same after they have been brought to thii; state liy their mutual iLctions upon each other. We shall then have2 n (n + v') (38) (n + D, r) = 3 siu2 o
Tlie first member or t!Jis equation represents the angular velocity of a particle of atmoi;pliere around the eartli's axis depending upon tlte velocity of the earth's rot.ation n and tlie angular velocit,y D, cp relative to the earth's surface, aIHl this 'relocity, it is seen, as the particle llloves toward or from the pole, must be inversely as sin 2 o, and consequently inversely as tLe square of the dif;tauce from the axis of rotation, and this is independent of any law gov1m1iug the rnotiou Iowan] or from the pole, just as in tbe case of the planets, or the motions of an;r free body co11trolletl liy a central force, whatever may he the hiw of that force. :M:.ultiplying both rnemliers of (38) by r sin o, it becomes the expression of the linear velocity. From (38) we get, in the case of a state of initial rest relative to the earth's surface, iu whiel1 case v' = 0,(3!1)

The first of these expresses the angular and the second the linear velocity of eastward motion relative to the earth's surface. If we put D, 9 = O, the first of (39) gives-_

This limit depends upou the value of P", tlte pressllre or the height of the fluid a.t the equator, and the greater this is the higher the latitude, where h, the height of the flllid, becomes 0.

With the value of r n (§ 14), and the value ot a'= a 0 given by (20), which is the value belong· ing to the temperature of 0°, we get Ma' r n 2 = 1.1946. 'Vi th this value, and the special value of sin2 O =~in (40), belonging to the latitude where the pressure is a maximum, we get-log P' = log P" + 0.0663(;
If we suppose P", the pressure or value of P' at the equator, equal to 0.76"', we get for the maximum p1·essure near the parallel of 350_

log P'

= 9.88081 + 0.06636 = 9.94717

Hence, at this parallel, P' = 0.88545m, or o.12545m greater than at the equator. There is, therefore, in this case a great depression or diminution of the pressure at the equator, an accumulation hav· ing its maximum near the parallel of 35°, and almost a vacuum near the poles. With the value of r n in § 14, the second of (39) gives at the equator, where sin o = 1,-

D, v

=-

154.76m

for the velocity per second of the atmosphere at the equator in this case, or a westward Yelocity of about 557 kilometers per hour. Toward the poles, where sin o in the tlenomina tor of one of the terms iu the expression of D, v (.'l!.J) becomes small, the eastward velocity becomes very great. 36. We know from obsernttion that in the case of nature in which there ii; friction, tlw value of D, \l', the angular \Telocity of the atmo11phere relative to the earth's surface, is \'ery small in com. parison with n, the angular YelociLy of rotation, and hence may be neglected in comparison with it. In tlie case, therefore, under consideration now, in which the first member of the sticond of (Hi) vanishes, and also the last term of the second member, we have very nearly(4~)

2 n cos

o D,u = -

(F,.

+ D,2t')

The first member expresses the deflecting force depending upon the earth's rotation 011 its axis, and upon D, it, the velocity along the meridian, and it, is this force alone which ornrcomes the fric· tion and inertia of the air representell by the two terms in the second member. At tho equator, where cos o = o, we haveD,2v = - F" or D,v = - F,,t As F, is negative, it tends to destroy all motion which the air might have at the equator, and hence there can be no east and west motion there in the case we are now consiuering, in which only differences of density between the equatorial and polar regions are considered. Since D, u in (42) becomes very small toward, and vanishes at, the poleB, we must for the same reason have a ealm about the poles. 37. If the motions of tlie atmosphere were not resisted by the earth's surfacP, the ri·sults of the preceding section for the case of no friction could be at once applieu to them without ans moclifications; hence toward the poles there would be a very rapid motion of the atmosphere eastward and in the equatorial regions toward the west, and the atmosphere would be l'ery much depresse.d at the equator, and almost vanish from the polar regions, and become very protuberant about the parallels of 350. Although these results, when applied to the atmosphere, must be very much modified on account of the resiBtauces of the earth's surface, yet they will be of great ad van~age in explain· ing its general motions; for as there can be no resistance until there is motion, the atmosphere must have a tendency to assume, in some measure, the same motions and figure of outline as in the case of no resistances. Hence toward the poles, the general motions of the atmosphere at the earth's surface must be toward the east, and int.he torrid zone toward the west; but as these motions, in consequence of the resistances, are small iu comparison with those in the case of no resistances, instead of the atmosphere having a great depression at the equator, and almost entirely receding from the poles, there are only comparatively small depressions, as represented in Ohart VII, in which the outline of the part representing the atmosphere must be regarded merely as a stratum of equal tlensity in the upper regions. That there are really such depressions at the equator and the poles is shown by the barometric pressures given in Table X, for the pressures are less at the equa· tor and toward the poles, especial1y the sonth pole, than in middle latitudes, although the density of tlae atmosphere at the poles is much greater on account of the lowness of the temperature, and hence there must be considerable polar depressions in the strata of equal density.

rt VII is intended to represent the mean annual vertical or horizontal surface motions of
tlw atmosphere in tbe case of a homogeneous surface o\·er the whole globe, ot eitlwr all wat,er or

all lan<l of the same unevenness, and with the same temperatures at corresponding parallels of the two hemispllercR. Hence the equatorial calm-belt coincides with the equator. and tlw other two calm-belti:; are found 011 corresponding parallels, and the whole· system of the wiuds iu tlie two hemi· spheres is exactly similar. Ou account, howm·er, of the unequal distribution of lau1l a11d water in the two hemispheres, the:se calm-belts are somewhat cli,;placed, being all mon1<1 a little toward tlw north pole; and on account of the unef1ual distribution of temperature in the llill'neut l011gitudPs corresponding to the same parallels of latitude iu the same hemisphere, arising from tlrn unequal distribution of laud and water, these calm-belts and the geueral system of the winds are n1ry rnuc!J deranged, especiall.\" in tlrn northern hemisphere, as represe11 tcd iu Charts I and IL 38. As the moticm of the atmosphere is east toward the poles arnl west near the f'I) uat-0r, somewhere between the equator and the poles tbere must be a parallel of latituue where there is no east or west motion. This, in the case of no resistance, and upon the hypothesis of au initial state of rest, we have found to be nearly the pa.rail el of 3i'i 0 ; but, in the case of nature, i 11 which theri' a re frictioual resistances at the earth's surface to the motions of the atmosphere, this parallel depe[](ls npou the law of the resistances am1 the Yelocities of motion, and !Jenee it cannot be acenr:1tely determined from t!Jeor,Y. It is e\·ident, howe,·er, that tlie east and west motions of the atmosplwre at tlie earth's surface must be such that the surn of the resistances of each part of the earth'.- surface multiplied into its distance from the axis of motion must equal O, else the velocity of the earth'H rotation would be continually either accelerated or retarded, which cannot arise from any mutnal action between the earth's surface and the surronnding atmosphne. ::S-ow, as the part of the eartli's surface where the motion of the atmosphere is west is much farther from the axis than the part wl1ere it is east, it is reasonable to suppose tliat the parallel of no east and west motion must bl' nearer to the equator in this case than the parallel of 350, unless the eastward velocities toward the poles were very much greater than tbe westward velocities toward the equator. This is known to be the position cf this parallel from observation. Iu s1waking of the east and west motions of the atmosphere, of course only one component of the real motions is understood. 39. Since there is an eastward motion of the atmosphere in the polar regions anrl a westward motion nearer the equator, the protuberance of the outline of the atmosphere and the incrpase of pressure in the middle latitudes, with a maximum near tile parallel of 3lJO, is readily PXplaim·<l oy the principle gfren in § 13; for, according to tbis principle, the eastward motions in both liellli· spheres give rise to a deflecting force, arising from the earth's rotation toward Lhe equatnr, a11d tlw westward motions nearer the equator to a deflecting force toward the poles, and hl'llee there 111 n,,;t be an accumulation of atmosphere having its maximum hetween these east aml west motions. 40. Thfl increase of pressure arising from the accumulation of atmosphere near tlw parallels of 30° gives the atmosphere at the earth's surface a tendency to flow from beneath this accumulation both toward the equator and the poles, since the motions, and consequently tlie deflecting forces arising from these motions, and causing this accumulation, are much less near the surface, where friction is greatest, thau in the higher strata. But on account of the greater density of the atmosphere toward the poles, it has a tendency also to flow, at the earth's surface, from the poles toward the equator. Between the parallel of greatest pressure and the equator these tendencies combine and pmduce a strong surface-current which, combining with the westward motion there, give;; rise to the well-known northeast wind in the northern and southeast wind in tbe southern hemisphere, represented on Chart Vll, called the trade-winds. But between the parallels of greatest pressure and the poles, tbe-se tendencies are opposed to each other, aud the oue arising from the accumula· tiou of atmosphere being the greater in the middle and polar latitudes and near thP earth's surface causes the atmosphere there to flow toward the 1 oles; and this motion, combining with the general eastward motion of the atmosphere in these latitudes, gives rise to the south west win<ls in the northern and the northwest winds in the southern hemisphere, which prevail iu these latitudes, as rep. resented ou Chart VII. 41. Since the atmosphere at the parallel of greatest pressure bas no barometric gradient, it can have no north or south motjon there at the surface, and consequently D, u in (33) vanishes, and there is no force arising from the earth's rotation to overcome the friction at the surface ; and hence

406

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

there can be no east and west motion there, and we have what are called the tropical calm-belts. These calm-belts, therefore, must coincide with the belts of maximum pressure, which, for the average of all longitudes, it is seen from Table X, is near the parallel of 350, being a little farther from the equator in the northern hemisphere than the southern, on account of the unequal distribution of land and water; the land with high mountain-ranges diminishing the east and west motions in the northern hemisphere, upon which the positions of these calm-belts depend. From what precerles, the mean motions of the atmosphere, unobstructed by inequalities of surface, such as continents and mountain-ranges, would be at the earth's surface nearly as represented iu Chart VII, and the calm-belts have positions ve1-y nearly as there represented. 42.

\\'ith regard to the value of D,2 u arising from the inertia of the atmosphere, we know that in all the general motions of the atmol'lphere it is very small. The interchanging motions of the atmos. phere between the equatorial and the polar regions arising from the disturbance of static equilibrium 011 account of a difference of temperature consist, except near the earth's surface, of a motion in the upper regions toward the poles, and in the lower regions of a motion from the poles, the whole circuit of t!Jis motion being performed in a long period of time. Hence the rate of increase or decrease of velocity in any part of the circuit, upon which the value of D, u depends, is ver.v small. 'l'he gl'cateRt velocity of t!Jese motio11s is per!Japs not more than 10 kilometers per hour, or 2.77801 per second, and if we suppose all this velocity to have been generated in 24 llours, or 86400 seconds, we shall have, !Jy putting G for the force required to overcome the inertia,G = D,2u and
2.77Sm

D,u =Gt

With the value of D, n = 2.77Sm, above, and t
G

= 86400 seconds,

we get-

=

8ti400

Now we have g, the accelerating force of gravity, e<1ual to 98Umm, and hence we have-

~ = 0.00000032775 g
This is the ratio between tlw horizontal force required to overcome the inertia of the atmosphere and the vertical force of gra·ity, and corresponds to a gradient in the atmosphere of 0.364m in the distance of one degree~ or llll1Jn 1· Tbis multiplied into the ratio between the density of air anti mercury,

roin, gives

a barometric gradient of nearly o.0035rum, a quantity which might

generally be neglected in comparison with the gradients upon which velocities generally depend. With the preceding value or G, if we put J D,v for the effect of this term upon D, v, we getJD v 2.778m ' - 86400 x :.>, n cos o With this expression, we get, on the parallel of 450, with the value of n in § 14, JD, v = 1.126km per hour. Even this quantity would be of little consequence in estimating the approximate velocities of the genera.I motions of the atmosphere; but the eftect of the term in question must be very much less than this, siuce, in the slow interchanging motions between the equatorial and polar regions, the time in which a particle at rest in its extreme northern or southern position arrives at its maximum ·elocity must be ·ery mnch more than 24 hours, as supposed above. The effect of this term then must be extremely small. Of course, this applies only to the slow general motions between the e11uatorial and polar regions, and not to those belonging to cyclonic disturbances of the atmosphere. For the same reaso11s, the term D,2 vis always very small, and in the general motio11s of the atmosphere may be neglected without sensible error. Equation (42) therefore furnishel'I us with a measure of the amount of friction when we know the value of D,u.

In the case of no friction, or where tbe effect of friction iB neglected, we must put cos i = l. When the direction of the wind, or, in other wor<h1, the value of i, is known from observations, the effect of friction in the precelling expressions is known ; but when this directio11 is not known, we must neglect this effect, and put cos 'i = 1.

44. Since h vanishes at the earth's surface, the first term in the expression of D, v in this table represents the surface-velocity of the east or west component of motion at the surface. This is a little less than what is usually obtained from the gradients; for the barometric pressures having l>een reduced to the gravity of the parallel of 45°, the gradients in the middle latitudes are diminished on this account about o.01rn, which, by (21'), for the temperature of oo, corresponds 011 the parallel of 450 to 2.l 6km per hour. Tliis shows the importance of' having all harometric pressures reduced to a fixed measure instead of being expresse<l in measures which vary with the latitude. Since h va11isbes at the earth's surface, the easterly component of the velocity of the wind there is represented by the firRt term in the expression of D, v in Table XI. Between the parallels of 360 and 660 in the northern hemisphere, and south of 290 in the southern hemisphere, as far as baro· metric observations have been made, the winds, according to the results of this table, have an easterly component, and between the parallels of 360 N. and 290 S. there is a westerly component. North of the parallel of Ci6° N. there is also a westerly compone11t. By a glance at Plate 8 of the late Prof. Coffin's great work on the" Winds of the Globe,:? it is seen that this is exactly in accordance with observation, except that the dividing line between the two systems of winds in the southern hemisphere is a little south of the parallel of 29°. But the observations in this zone are not sufficient for determining the position of this line very accurately, and the position obtained from the barometric gradients is, without doubt, the more correct one. Again, according to the authority of Mr. Laughton,· "In both hemispheres to the north or south of the parallels of35° or 40°, a strong westerly wind blowfl with great constancy all around the world.
* Physical Geography in its Relation to the Prevailing Winds and Cnrrents, p. 101.

THE UNITED ST.ATES COAST SURVEY.

In the southern hemisphere, more particularly, it blows with a persistence little less than that of the trade-winds, but with a strength which, although fitful, is very much greater. From a fresh, strong breeze, it rises frequeutl.v into a violent gale, and, as such, blows for days together, the mean direction being nearly west, from which it seldom varies more than a couple of' points on either side. South of the Atlantic, south of the Iudian Ocean, south of Australia, in the higher latitudes of the Southern Pacific, and to the soutlnrnrd of Cape Horn, we find it still the same, a westerly gale, whose st.rength and constancy combined ba\'e enabled Australian clippers to make passages which seem to border on the fabulous. In the northern hemisphere, it bas not the clear range which it has in the southern; but there, too, it prevails in the most decided manner." From the results of Table XI, it is not only seen that the velocities in the higher latitudes of both hemispheres are eastward, but that they are very much greater in the southern than in the northern hemisphere, which is exactly in accordance with observation according to the preceding quoted paragraph. The smallness of the eastward components of velocity in the northern hemisphere compared with those of the southeru is due to the greater amount of land and mountain-ranges in the northern hemisphere than in the southern, which increases the resistances to the eastward motions, and consequently the greater eastward motions of the southern hemisphere, by means of the deflecting force arising from the earth's rotation, causes a greater depression there, and a great part of the atmosphere to be thrown into the northern hemisphere. This also accounts for the mean position of the equatorial calm-belt being, in general, a little north of the equator. For the same reason, the tropical calms of the northern hemisphere are farther from the equator than those of the southern hemisphere. The easterly components for the northern hemisphere are known, from observation, to be very small; but estimates of the actual velocities have been made but for a very few places around the globe. Prof. Coffin obtained· for the average velocity for the whole of the United States, estirnateu by the Smithsonian scale, 2.0 miles (3.2km) per hour, with a resultant direction nearly from the west, making the eastern component sensibly the same. This result agrees almost precisely with the result given for the mean of the year in Table XI for the average latitude of the United States; bnt it must be remembered in these comparisons that the theoretical results are those of the average all around the globe, and that various disturbing causes, to be considered hereafter, may cause considerable deviations from this average in different longitudes on the same latitude. The eftect ·of friction at the surface, which has been neglected in the formula (43), is to make the actual veloci· ties less than those give11 in Table X1 by the formula. The westward velocities in the trade-wind zones, as given in Table XI, are greater in the southern than the northern hemisphere. This is in accordauce with observations of the trade.winds of the Atlantic Ocean, on which the southeast trade-winds are observed to be mucll stronger than the northeast ones. The theoretical results, however, in these zones are probably considerably too large on account of the neglect of the friction term in (4.3), which in these zo-'les is very much magnified near the equator from the smallness of cos o in the denominator of the formula. The parallels of 3130 in the northern aud of 290 in the southern hemisphere, being parallels on which there is no east or west motion on the average around the globe, and where, on account of there being no barometric gradient, there can be no north or south component of velocity, represent the mean position of belts in which calms abound, called tropical calm.belts. 45. From a comparison of the eastward and westward velocities at the earth's surface in both hemispheres, contained in Table XI, it is seen that the winter velocities in each hemisphere are greater than those of summer. We have but few results deduced from observations to confirm this result, but it is completely confirmed so far as they go. From Prof. Coffin's" Wiuds or the Globe" (pp. 648-653) 1 we extract the following mean directions a.ud true velocities in mean direction for wint.er and summer, and have computed the corresponding components of velocity contained iu the following table.

By comparing the east components of winter and summer above, it is seen that throughout the United States, except on the Pacific coast and in the extreme southern States, and at the Orkney Islands, the winter component is in e>ery case greater than the summer component. The extreme southern States are so near the parallel of the calm-belt that the velocities in the direction of the resultant, and the direction itself, are so uncertain t.hat the ratios between the components for winter and summer are very various,. and the sign8 of the components even change in some cases. · 46. The effect of the second term in the expression of D, v in Table XI is to increase very much the velocities of the eastward motions in the upper strata of the atmosphere over those at the surface in the higher latitudes; and, in the trade-wind zone, the westward velocities near tho surface are at a very moderate elevation changed to eastward velocities. Thns, on the parallel of 450, and at an elevation of 5 kilometers, we have, for the mean temperature of the year, D, v = 4,9km x 8.8h = 48.9km per hour, and at greater elevations this velocity becomes still much greater. On the parallel of 250, we have D,v at the surface equal to 14.4km west, and at the elevation of only 3km it becomes 13.8km east, and hence at the elevation of only about 1.5km there is no motion east or west. These results are in accordance with observation, for travelers have experienced a strong westerly wind, at great elevations, on Manna Loa, on the passes of the Rocky Mountains and the Andes, on the top of Pike's Peak and )fount Washington, on the Peak of Teneriffe, and at every very elevated position in either hemisphere all around the globe, except in the calm-belt near the eq11ator, Hen when there is an easterly wind in the same latit11de in less elevated positions. It is seen from Table XI that in the trade-wind zones, where at the surface the wind is easterly, at a very moderat:e elevation there is a very strong current from the west; and this is especially the case in the winter. This accounts for the transportation of volcanic a.shes through long distances eastward when in the trade-wind belt at the surface there was a strong c11rrentfrom the east. On the 1st of May, 1812, the island of Barbadoea was suddenly obscured by a dense cloud, and its snrfaee quickly covered by a shower of ashes from an eruptive volcano of St. Vincent, more than a hundred miles to the westward. .Also, on the 20th of January, 1835, the volcano of Coseqnina, lying in the belt of the northeast trade-winds, sent forth great quantities of lava and ashes, and the latter were borne in a direction just contrary to the surface-wind, and lodged on the island of Jamaica, 800 miles to

the northeast. This latter happened at a season when, according to the results of Table XT, the upper currents have a very great easterly tendency, and hence at a time very favorable for the transportation of the ashes to so great a distance. The great eastward velocities of the upper currents are also established by the observations of the clouds, especially of the cirrus clouds, which are supposed to have an altitude generally of 7 or 8 kilometers. The eastward velocity of these clouds has been estimated at times to be as much as 120 miles (193km) per hour, and it rarely happens that they have no eastward tendency. The average, therefore, according to this somewhat uncertain kind of observations, may be put at nearly lO{Jkm. This eastward velocity is a little greater than that given by Table XI at the height of the cirrus clouds in the rniudle latitudes for the mean temperature of the year, but corresponds with that belonging to Januar.r. The eastward motion of the atmosphere in the latitude of the trade-winds is also coutinned hy observations made on the directions of the clouds at Colonia Tovar, Veneznela, latitude 100 '.!W, as given in the Report of tbe Smithsonian Institution for 1857 (p. 254). While the motion of the lower clouds was in general from some point toward the east, the obsen·ed motion of nearly all the higher clouds was from some point toward the west. 51. From a comparison of the expressions of D, v in Table XI, for .Tanuar.'l and July, it is seen that the eastward veloeities of tbe upper strata of the atmosphere are very much greater in winter than in summer. On the parallel of 45°, in the ·northern hemisphere, we have for au altitude of 5km D,v equal to 06.Jkm in ,Ja.nuary and equal to only 29.Pm in .Jnly. RP,snlts dedneed from t.ltt' discussion of observations made at ele>ated places for both seasons are needed for comparison with this theoretical result. On the parallel of 250, in the northern hemisphere, the beigbt at wbicb there is 110 east or west motion of the atmosphere by Table XI is 1.Pm in January, but 3.4km iu July. North of this parallel, the~e heights, where there is no east or west motion, gradually diminish until at the parallel of 360, the parallel of the tropical calm-belt, this plane touches the surface. Hence there is an oscillation with the seasons of the height of this plane divirli11g the west or southwest from the mrnt or southeast winds. This explains the winds oft.he Peak of Teneritfe, which at the top blow in general from the southwest, while lower down they blow alternately from the northeast and southwest, changing with the seasons. In the summer season, the dividi11g plane between the two systems of winds blowing in nearly contrary directions, is highest, aurl is found on the Peak of Teueriffe from observation to be abont 1.5 miles high. Prof. Piazzi Smyth, who )'pent Revera! mnntbs 011 the JH·ak making astronomical observations, on leaving bis station at Alta Vista, at the height of 10, 700 feet above the level of the sea, on the 25th of August, exrJerienced a southwest breeze, but at an alti· tnde of 6,7UO feet it changed to one from the nortLeast. Returning again on the :lOth or .August, he experienced a similar change at the same height, the strength of the wi11d increasing as he ascended, and blowing from the southwest at Alta Vista, as when he left. 47. Since each upper stratum acts upon the one beneath it by means of friction, and that upon the next one, and so on, down to the earth's surface, the force which 0\-ercomes tlte frictinn between the atmosphere and tbe earth's surface is the sum of all the detleding forces depeuding upon the earth's rotation and a1>on inertia, and putting F,' for F. at the earth's surface, we ger from (33)F,.'

atmosphere are much greater above than below, and hence, as the atmosphere of the upper currents approaches the poles, it gradually sinks down, to return, toward the equator, nearer the surface, and D,v, in order to satisfy the conditions, must gradually decrease, and in this case the last member of (45) is positive, that is, the sum of the forces tends to overcome the frictional resistance at the earth's surface to the eastward motion of the atmosphere, and the observed amount of motion depends upon these forces. In the equatorial regions, where the atmosphere ascends, of course the reverse of this is the case, and we have these forces tending to overcome the frictional resistance at the earth's surface to the westward motions there. The force, then, which overcomes the frictional resistances, at the earth's surface, to the eastward motion of the atmosphere, depends upon the sum of the moments of inertia, or of the amounts or velocity lost, of the particles of atruosphere, in passing toward the poles, in the upper regions, where the eastward velocity is gi·eater, and returning toward the equator uearer the earth's surface, where the eastward velocity is less. The force, likewise, which overcomes the resistances to tho westward motions at the surface in the zones of tlie trade-winds, is the moment of inertia lost in the decreasing westward velocities of the atmosphere as it ascends and commences to return in the upper regions toward the poles. 48. The eastward velocity Duv in '.l'able XI is that which satisfies the conditions of the problem in the case of no frictiou, in which case D,u, the interchanging velocity ootween the equatorial and polar regions, vanishes, and consequently the deflecting force overcoming friction in the case of friction. Where there is friction there must be a force to overcome it, and hence D,u must have a value, that is, there must be a gradual interchange of atmosphere between the equatorial and polar regions, a·nd this motion must be just sufficient to give rise to a force sufficient to overcome the friction and the inertia of the eastward motions. If the velocity of the motion of the upper strata of the atmosphere toward the poles were a little too great, it would give rise to au increased eastward Yelocity, which, by means of the deflecting force depending upou the earth's rotation (§ 13), would at once diminish the velocity, and reduce it to that which satisfies the conditions of the problem. The difference between the atmospheric pressure at the equator and the poles, at the earth's surface, depends almost entirely upon the eastward motion, or value of D,11, at the earth's surface, as may be seen from the first of (15), since kin the last term vanishes at the surface, and consequently this difference is entirely independent of the difference of temperature, which affects only the last term of this equation. Hence, in the northern hemisphere, where there is a difference of 300 or morEt in the higher latitudes, between winter and summer, the difference of barometric pressure amounts to onlJ' about 2mm. The reason of this is that the increased eastward velocities in winter, as shown in Table XI, give rise to a force depending upon the earth's rotation by the principle of § 13, which tends to prevent the flow of the atmosphere in the upper regions from the equatorial to the polar regions, as the volume them is contracted by diminution of temperature, and the height of the atmosphere is decreased toward the poles, nearly in the same proportion that its density is increased by the diminution of temperature, so that there is scarcely any change in the mass of the atmmipbere, and consequently in the barometric pressure, between winter and summer. If the earth had no rotation on its axis, this deflecting force depending upon its rotation would not exist, and then, if this great difference of temperature between the equator and the poles could be maintained, there would be a very great dift'erence of pressure and a very rapid interchanging motion between the equatorial and polar regions.
