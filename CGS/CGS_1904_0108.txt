THE WORK OF THE VEAR.

It is gratifying to announce the completion of the determination of the difference of longitude between San Francisco, Cal., and Manila, P. I., thus connecting the longitude circuit around the earth. This work was made practicable by the generous cooperation of the officers of the Commercial Pacific Cable Company, who placed their cables and operators at the service of the Sunrey, during the short periods needed for the transmission of time signals between the stations for comparison of chronometers. Incidental'ly, during the progress of this work, the longitude of Honolulu, Hawaii; of Midway Island; and Guam Island were determined. The details of this work are given in Appendix 4. The triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian was extended toward the north and toward the south from the portion already completed, the total extension amounting to 500 kilometers along the meridian, and the work was in progress at the close of the year. The location on the ground and marking of the boundary between Alaska and the British possessions, as la{d down by the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, was inaugurated under the direction of the Department of State by the Superintendent as Commissioner of the United States, in cooperation with the Commissioner of Great Britain. The various operations of the magnetic survey of the country show a gratifying progress during the year. The determination of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity was made in, 327 localities, embracing 367 stations distributed o\·er 24 States and Territories, and 2 foreign countries. An extensive investigation was made of the marked local disturbances in the Yicinity of Juneau, Alaska, 45 stations being occupied for thh; purpose. In cooperation with the Louisiana geological survey, the magnetic survey of that State was completed. Effective cooperation was secured with an expedition sent to the Bahama Islands by the Baltimore Geographical Society, and valuable results were thus obtained without expense to the Survey.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

Excellent progress was made in securing magnetic observations at sea during the voyages of the ships of the Survey to and from their fields of work. In the Atlantic and Pacific oceans 92 results of magnetic declination and 33 results of magnetic dip and intensity were thus obtained, nearly all of them derived from complete swings of the ships, forward and back. Continuous records of the variations of the magnetic elements were secured throughout the year at five magnetic observatories situated at Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Sitka, Alaska; near Honolulu, Hawaii; and Vieques, P. R. During the year a large number of magnetic storms were recorded, the most remarkable one occurring October 31-November 1. It is interesting to note that within this year a bureau of international research in terrestrial magnetism was created by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, with an officer of the Survey, the inspector of magnetic work, in charge as director. A continuous record of tide observations with self-registering gauges was obtained during the year at 8 stations, including 1 station in Hawaii and 1 in the Philippine Islands, and for a portion of the year at an additional station which was established on the Gulf of Mexico, at Galveston, Tex. The electric tide indicator installed in the Maritime Exchange at Philadelphia continued to give satisfaction. A similar apparatus was installed during the year in the Maritime Exchange at New York. The tide indicators, established for the use of mariners in New York Harbor, in the Delaware River at Reedy Island, and in San Francisco Bay continued in operation during the year. Compass deviation ranges were established by marks.placed on the inner Delaware Breakwater, which will prove of great value to shipping, as any vessel can now determine the corrections to her compass while swinging at anchor in the National Harbor of Refuge. The field work necessary for the revision of two volumes of the United States Coast Pilot, covering the coast from Point Judith, Rhode Island, to Chesapeake Bay entrance, Virginia, was completed. Hydrographic surveys were made in r6 States and Territories; topographic surveys in 9; triangulation in 14; and leveling in 6. The primary triangulation along the Pacific coast north of San Francisco was c01itinued. In Alaska, a survey was made of Davidson Inlet, work was continued in Prince William Sound, and two vessels were dispatched to make a survey of Kiska Harbor, Aleutian Islands. In Porto Rico, hydrographic work was continued in the harbors and bays and offshore. The director of coast surveys in the Philippine Islands, an officer of the Coast and Goedetic Survey (with a detail of assistants), in cooperation with the insular government, has continued the important work of charting the imperfectly known waters .of the archipelago. The largest vessel belonging 'to the Survey was engaged on this duty during the entire year. Detached surveys based on astronomic determinations and including base measurement, triangulation, topography, hydrography, and tide observations were made at

REPOR1' OF THE SUPERINTENDE::s'T.

various points, and a connected triangulation already extends over the greater portion of the \yest coast of Luzon Island north of Manila Bay. Two additional telegraphic longitudes were determined; magnetic and tide observations were continued. Fifteen new charts were prepared and published at the Manila suboffice, and four volumes of sailing directions (includii1g new editions of Parts I and II) were published. In the Office the current work was kept up to date and satisfactory progress mts made in the \·arious branches of its work, including computation, reduction, plotting, and discussion of results of field work, and the preparation of the results for publication by chart or otherwise. A considerable amount of work was clone for the Department of State in connection with the preparation of maps of the Alaska boundary for publication. Satisfactory results were obtained during the year at the latitude observatories maintained under the direction of the Superintendent at the expense of the International Geodetic Association, at Gaithersburg, Md., and at Ukiah, Cal., for the purpose of measuring the variations of latitude. I attended the Fourteenth General Conference of the International Geodetic Association at Copenhagen, Denmark, as the delegate of the United States, and continued the work of re-marking the boundary line between the United States and Canada from the Rocky Mountains westward, as Commissioner of the United States, two officers of the Survey being detailed for work in the field. I was detailed to report to the United States agent at London, England, for duty in connection with the presentation of the case of the United States to the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, and performed that duty. Another officer of the Sun'ey was also detailed on this duty. As Commissioner of the United States on the International Delimination Commission, I inaugurated the wor~ of marking the boundarj\ between Alaska and Canada as laid down by the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, and one officer was detailed for work in the field. One officer continued on duty as a member of the Mississippi Ri\·er Commission. The survey of Mason and Dixon's Line, the.boundary between the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania, was completed and progress was made in the preparation of the report and maps showing the results of the work. The survey of the natural oyster heels and reefs in the State of Louisiana was continued in cooperation with the Louisiana Oyster Commission by an officer of the Sun·ey detailed for this purpose. One officer remained in charge of the triangulation of the city of New York, which is in progress hy the city authorities. Officers of the Sun·ey with their vessels were called upon 'to patrol racing regattas upon three occasions and performed this duty to the satisfaction of the parties concerned. An exhibit was prepared and installed at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis, and an officer was assigned to duty in charge of the exhibit. The amount appropriated for the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year 1904 was $968 025,* of which $210 245 was for manning and equipping the vessels of the Survey, f,120 ooo for building a new vessel, $38 100 for repairs and maintenance of vessels, and $50 ooo for office expenses. The remainder. of the appropriation was about equally divided between expenses of parties in the field and salaries of the field and office forces.

At the beginning of the year this vessel was at Baltimore, ::Vld., fitting out for a cruise 011 the coast of :'.\Iaine, for·which she sailed on August 13. En·route an examination was made for a reported shoal in the vicinity of the \Vintcr Quarter-Shoal, and magnetic observations were made during the trip and at Delaware Breakwater. The work of the season included examinations for a number of reported changes and dangers and their determination, on the coast of 1\fainc, Massachusetts, and off Sandy Hook, and the season finally closed at the latter place, the vessel sailing for Baltimore from New York on November 25. On her arrival at Baltimore she was fitted out for a season's work in Porto Rico, and sailed for San Juan on January 27. Her work for the season included the continuation of the hyclrography of Porto Rico on the west coast and extended from Point Guanajibo southward to Cape Rojo. A shore party in charge of Mr. J. C. Landers, Aid, worked under the directions of the commanding officer of the Bache, using the launch Rud)', and made the survey of Boqueron Bay and also the inshore hydrographic survey off Cape Rojo. On the completion of this work on the west coast, the Bache sailed for San Juan and made a hydrographic reconnaissance of the entrance to Sau Juan Harbor, at the request of the War Department, and, on finishing that work, sailed on May 28 for Baltimore, Mel., via Hampton Roads. At the close of the year she was at Baltimore, Md., fitting out for her season'swork on the coast of Maine.

At the beginning of the year this ship was at Norfolk, Va., fitting out for her season's work on the :New England coast. She sailed on August 6 for her working grounds in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, where she continued the development of shoal spots in the bay which was left incomplete last season. En route from Baltimore an examination for a reported shoal off Winter Quarter Shoal and the usual magnetic observations were made. In the latter part of August the work in Buzzards Bay was suspended and the party took up an examination of the waters eastward and southward of Nantucket Shoals. On the completion of this work, the party was engaged in examinations for reported dangers and shoals until the close of the season. She sailed for Baltimore on October 22, where she was fitted out for her winter's work in Porto Rico. Owing to unforeseen delays and especially to an accident in the yard where

she was being repaired in which she was seriously damaged, she did not sail for Porto Rico until March 5. During the season she made a number of special examinations, a development of the passages off the north and east coast of Porto Rico and in Vieques Sound, and verified a portion of the work done by the schooner J:.'agrc in that locality. Work was closed and she sailed for Baltimore, via Hampton Roads, on June 2, and at the close of the year was in the hands of the contractors undergoing repairs and fitting for-her summer's work on the New England coast.

THE STEAMER ENDEAVOR.

Assistant F. A. Young, Commanding.

At the beginning of the year this vessel was at work making a survey of the Kettle Bottom Shoals in the Potomac River. 1'his work was interrupted from July 6 to 12, when she went to Norfolk for some minor repairs, and also when assigned to patrol duty for the regatta on the Potomac at \Vashington on September r 2, and was suspended for the season on November 8, when she sailed for Baltimore, Mel., to fit out for a season at Key \Vest, Fla. She sailed on February 2, via Fort l'vlonroe, and during the season made a close survey, using the harbor sweep, of an area about 2 miles square, southwest of the Key West Light. \Vork in this locality was closed and the vessel sailed for Port Royal, S. C., on June 5, where the position of the new Hilton Head Front Range was determined and a line of soundings run to determine the deepest water over the range. On completing this work, the vessel sailed for Baltimore, on June 17, and at the close of the year was still at Baltimore making arrangements to fit out for a season's work on Nantucket Shoals.
THI;: STEAMER GIWNEY.

Assistant E. F. Dickins, Commanding.

At the beginning of the year this vessel was fitting out for her summer's work in Alaska, sailing for her working grounds on July 1 2. En route, she made a determination of the new Mary Island Light-house, and examined and located a rock at the southern entrance to Tongass Narrows. During the season she took up the survey, including the triangulation, topography, and hydrography, of the approaches to Davidson Inlet, Iphigenia Bay. Work was closed and the vessel started for San Francisco, Cal., October 10. The launch Cosmos and launch No. r 17 were assigned for the use of the party on the Gcd1ze) 1 during the season, and at the close of the season were left in the Survey storehouse on Japonski Island. After the return of the vessel to San Francisco, on November 17, she was put out of commission and laid up in Oakland Creek in charge of shipkeepers. On April 16 she was again put in commission and fitted for her summer's work, sailing on May 8. En route, she completed the survey in San Juan Channel, Washington, which had been started by a shore party under Assistant Dickins, and made an examination for a reported shoal spot on Hein Bank. She sailed on June 6 from Seattle and continued the work of the previous season in Iphigenia Bay, and was so engaged at the close of the year.

On the completion of the repairs, August 18, she sailed for Jersey City, and on August 24 the party 011 board took up the field redsion of Parts IV and V of the Atlantic Coast Pilot. By direction of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, this work was suspended and the vessel and party were assigned to patrol duty during the regatta of the New York Bay Regatta Association 011 the Kill von Kull on August 29 and again on September 2, after which she resumed her regular field work. OJ1 November 4 she sailed for \Vashington, and on November 21 sailed for Hampton Roads, where she was fitted out for a season at Key West, Fla., and sailed on December 1. During the season she was engaged in a close development of the Sand Key and Southwest channels with the harbor sweep, and special examinations for reported clangers in Key \Vest Harbor. On the completion of this as.'iigmnent she proceeded, on June 10, to St. Catherines Sound, Georgia, and made a development of the channel at the entrance to the sound, which was completed by the close of the year.

At the beginning of the year this vessel was engaged in running a line of deep-sea soundings from Juan de Fuca Strait to Sitka Sound, arriving at Sitka on July 3. This work was undertaken at the request of the Chief Signal Officer, United States Army. She left Sitka on the 7th and continued the deep-sea soundings to the entrance to Chatham Strait. She sailed for Juneau on the 17th to deliver the results of the soundings to the chief signal officer on the U. S. S. Burnside (cable ship) and started on her return to Sitka on the 19th, via Icy Strait and Cross Sound. She left Sitka on the 27th and continued the deep-sea soundings as far as Cape St. Elias. She then took up the survey of Controller Bay, which was continued until September 19, when this work was stopped and the vessel sailed for Orea, continuing the deep-sea soundings from Cape St. Elias into Prince William Sound. She left Orea for Dutch Harbor on September 23, en route for Kiska Island, Alaska. After her arrival at Dutch Harbor on the 29th it developed that one of the furnaces to the boiler was so seriously damaged that it was necessary to return to Seattle, \Vash., for repairs, and she sailed on October 10, arriving 011 the 20th. New furnaces were installed and the vessel sailed for Honolulu, Hawaii, on March 30. About 800 miles out the furnaces again became disabled and she returned to San Francisco, Cal., arriving there on the 17th of April. Two new furnaces were again installed and the vessel sailed for Kiska, via Dutch Harbor, on June 10. The schooners Quiel~, SPJ', and Transit were laid up during the entire year at Madisonville, La., in the charge of a ship keeper. Some slight repairs were made to the Transit during the year.

III. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF GEODETIC WORK.

J. F.

HAYFORD,

Inspector.

The duties of the Inspector of Geodetic Work were performed at the Office in Washington, except for the period between July r6 and August 12. The Inspector left Washington on July 16 and proceeded to Green Rh·er, \Vyo. He spent one day with each of the leveling parties at work in this vicinity under charge of Aids H. D. King and R. L. Libby. He then inspected the primary triangulation party, under charge of Assi8tant O. W. Ferguson, at work on the triangulation along the 11i11etyeighth meridian in the vicinity of Lake Preston, S. Dak. Several clays were spent watching the observations. Six clays were spent with Assistant \V. H. Burger, who was engaged in extending the reconnaissance for triangulation in ::Vlinnesota. \Vhile with the triangulation party a 60-foot wooden observing tripod was tested by observations made on distant objects to ascertain how much twist should be expected in such tripod from the action of the sun. The Inspector also visited the work on the Lake Sun·ey in the vicinity of Mackinac Island, Mich., to obtain infonnation in regard to the iron signals (observing tripods and scaffolds) erected there as a substitute for wooden signals. These iron signals were designed by Asst. Engineer H. F. Johnson with a view to their use at other stations after having served their purpose where first erected, and they are constructed of sections of gas pipe with iron rods to sustain all tension strains. The examination was made for the purpose of determining whether it was desirable or practicable to use such signals at the triangulation stations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. As at present advised the cost of using these iron signals would about equal the present cost of the wooden signals now being used on the ninety-eighth meridian where new lumber is purchased as near as practicable to the stations where it is to be used and the signals are abandoned after they have served their purpose. As a result of the inspection of fieldwork, as above, the Inspector keeps in closer touch with the work and observers, and the value of his recommendations to the Superintendent is correspondingly increased. During the remainder of the year the necessary supen·ision was exercised by a careful examination of the correspondences with field parties and of the records of observations sent to the Office from time to time, and hy an inspection of the computations and results.

Inspector.

The duties performed by this Office during the past year consisted, as heretofore, in the following: Inspection of field and observatory work in terrestrial magnetism; the preparation of the necessary directions and information required by the various parties and ships engaged in magnetic work; examination of the observation records received; the controlling of the constants of the various instruments employed, and the testing and derivation of constants of newly acquired instruments. The Inspector personally inspected the work of the field parties operating in ::-.rew Jersey, Louisiana, and South Carolina, and at various times the observatory work at Cheltenham, Md.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

The entire activity of the Survey in magnetic work during the fiscal year may be summarized as follows: A'1ag11clic worl~ on land. -The determination of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity in 328 localities, embracing 368 stations distributed over 24 States and Territories and 2 foreign countries, as exhibited in the table. Special mention should be made of the extensi,·e examination of the marked local disturbances in the vicinity of Juneau and Douglas Island, Alaska, about 45 stations having been occupied for this purpose during July and August, 1903. Successful cooperative work with .the Louisiana geological survey was carried on, so that with the valuable assistance rendered by the State geologist, Dr. G. D. Harris, the magnetic survey of the State was completed. Effective cooperation was secured with the expedition to the Bahama Islands sent by the Baltimore Geographical Society under the leadership of Dr. G. B. Shattuck. A complete instrumental outfit was loaned by the Coast and Geodetic Sttr\'ey, but all expenses incurred in securing the observations were defrayed by the expedition. Important results were obtained by the observer, Dr. 0. L. Fassig, at six stations. At two of the stations results had been predonsly obtained, so that the secular change can be deduced.

Also some intermediate compass obsen·ations were made on and near the ship's course. During the winter she was provided with a gimbal stand and a Lloyd-Creak dip circle for ship and shore work. On her cruise from Baltimore to Porto Rico and return she was swung completely, securing the three· magnetic elem en ts (declination, clip, and intensity) going and returning, at Norfolk, \'a., at Mayaguez, P. R., and also at six intermediate places at sea. The /Jla/.:c on the cruise last summer from Baltimore to Buzzards Bay, ::VIass., swung ship completely for compass deviations and declination, twice at Hampton Roads, three times in Buzzards Bay, and once in Chesapeake Bay. During the last swing in Buzzards Bay and the one in the Chesapeake observations of dip and intensity were also made with the Lloyd-Creak dip circle. Some observations were also made at sea on the return trip from the New England coast to Baltimore. On the trip to Porto Rico and return she was swung completely, securing declination, dip, all() intensity observations in the Chesapeake (at the mouth of the Patuxent River), at Korfolk (going and returning), at Fajardo Roads (twice), and at seven intermediate places at sea. The Endeavor swung ship completely at Fort Monroe for compass cle\·iations and declination, and made some compass observations between Norfolk and Key \Vest. · The GcdnCJ' made some compass observations on a range course in Gastineau Channel, Alaska, to assist in the further development of the local disturbances existing in that locality.

REPORT OF TIIE

SL'PERINTE:\DE~T.

There were thus secured, incidentally to the regular surveying duties of the various vessels, 105 results of magnetic declination (variations of the compass), nearly half of which are dependent upon complete swings of the vessels, forward and back, and, hence, possess an accuracy of about 1o' to 15 1 ; also 33 results of magnetic dip and intensity of magnetic force, nearly all of them derived from complete swings, forward and back. ,llag11clic obscrvaforJ' work.-Continuous records of the variations of the magnetic clements were secured throughout the year at five magnetic observatories, situated at Chelten!1am, :Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Sitka, Alaska; near Honolulu, Hawaii; and Vieques, P. R. At the Sitka, Honolulu, and Vieques observatories some records of earthqnakes were obtained, and at the Cheltenham observatory some incidental obsen·ations in atmospheric electricity were secured. Registrations of the magnetic variations on the rapid (two-hour) rate were made simultaneously at all the observatories on the 1st and 15th of each month. During the past year a large number of very notable magnetic storms were recorded, the most remarkable one being. that of October 311\ ovember 1, which disturbed the telegraph and cable lines for several hours and disturbed the compass by a degree and a half and more, according to locality.

The disbursement of the funds of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is made not only by payments directly from the Disbursing Age1it, but also largely through the medium of its Assistants and other officers when acting as chiefs of parties. These officers, on approval of the Superintendent, receive advances of puhlic funds from the Disbursing Agent in lump smns, under authority of an Executi\·c order dated March 26, 1886. In conformity to this order there are now 64 officers of this Service bonclecl in the sum of $2 ooo to $5 ooo each. When acting as chiefs of parties, these officers recci\'e from time to time such advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent as are required to meet the necessary current expenses of the work in hand. A ledger account is kept in the office of the Disbursing Agent with each chief of party receiving an ad\·ance, each one being charged with all ach·ances made to him, and, on the other hand, receiving credit for all proper expenditures made by him when presented on regularly supported vouchers after such accounts ha,·c been audited in the office of the Disbursing Agent and found to be correct. All of these accounts, with their supporting vouchers, are then sent to the Auditor for the State and other Departments for examination and audit by him.

NECROLOGY.
Gc01;r;c ,-1. Faz'>jicld, for many years an Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey and at the time of his death the Assistant to the Officer in Charge of the Office, died at the home orhis son, in Saco, Me., Oil Friday, July 17, 1903. Mr. Fairfield was born at Saco, Me., 1\farch l, 1829. He was a graduate of Bowdoin College, Maine, and entered upon his iife's work on June 23, 1849, in his twentyfirst year, when he was appointed an aid in the field force of the Coast Survey. He remained in office until death ended his long career of fifty-four years of faithful public service. His first service was under the late Assistant C. 0. Boutelle on triangulation on the coast of Maine and Massachusetts, and four years later he was made chief of an independent party. In 1853-54 he inaugurated and was in charge of a comprehensive series of tidal observations along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. In the spring of 1855 he was assigned to duty on the Pacific coast, relieving the late Gen. Richard D. Cutts of the charge of the triangulation north of San Francit;co. He returned to duty on the eastern coast in 1 ~58, and during the civil war served under Gen. J. G. Foster and Admiral S. P. Lee, 1863-64, on the coast of North Carolina, where he made surveys required by the United States Army and Navy to facilitate their operations. His work extended over a large portion of the Atlantic seaboard, and during the years 1 880-1890 he was in charge of that portion of the transcontinental triangulation lying in the States of Illinois and fodiana, a most difficult country for such work, where it was necessary to use the highest observing tripods and scaffolds ever used in geodetic work up to that date. On August 16, 1893, he was assigned tu the charge of the work of furnishing points for State surveys, and continued on this duty until May 17, 1895. During this time he also had charg-e of the Tidal Division for a short period in 1894

COA!'>T AND GEODETIC SlJR VEY RBPORT, 1904.
I

and of the Engraving Division June l l, 1894, to June 30, 1895. He returned to field duty in July, 1895, and remained so employed until lVIay 5, 1898, when he was assigned permanently to the Office, and sen-ed in the Computing Division and in the Office of the Assistant in Charge nntil the date of his death. Mr. Fairfield was more fortunate than most men in having served his country faithfully for more than half a century, and the record of his work in the archives of the Sun·ey forms an enviable mo11tm1ent to his 1:1emory. At a meeting of the memhers of the Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey held at the Office on July 20, 1903, the following resolution was one of those unanimously adopted:
That in the death of our late associate, George Albert Fairfield, the public service, and especially the Bureau of which he was a member, hiL~ been deprived of the services of a man whose honesty of purpose and faithful performance of duty have always been beyonc! question. All duties intrustecl to him were conscientiously performed, and he ha~ left an enduring monument in the archives of the :Bureau in the record of his large share in the "Survey of the Coast" during his fifty-four years of continuous serdce. His methodical nature and painstaking habits re11<lcr the reconls of his work standanls well worthy of emulation, and his uniform goocl nature caclearecl him to all who knew him.

J11arJ' A. Gran/, \Vriter. died on December 29, 1903. She was horn in England, Noyember 6, 1836, and was appointed in the Survey from \Visconsin 011 :May 26, 1898. J_;'d7ein Jloralio Fowler, Chief Draftsman, died on l\farch 11, 1904. l\Ir. Fowler was born in South ).l°ewberry, N. H., October 20, 1856. He graduated from the Chandler Scientific Depart111eut of Dartmouth College in l 878, and on July 9. l 879, entered the Coast and Geodetic Survey as Draftsman. He served in that capacity until l 897, when he was made Chief Draftsman, and held this position when he died. During the period l 897-1904 the work of the Drawing Section was ad111irably systematized under his immediate direction, all chart corrections being arranged on ''History sheets,'' under the card-catalogue system. The process of transferring to original sheets the notes, titles, and general lettering which are common to all was adopted so that the work of preparing these sheets for approval and registration is reduced to a minim nm; and sheets of standard letters with a self-spacing device were prepared and resulted in a method of building up titles which will e\·entually insure uniformity in the titles of all the field sheets and all the charts published by photolithography. ::\fr. Fowler was an accomplished draftsman, and the work executed by him and under his direction forms an enduring record of his energy and ability during his many years of 1 faithful service to the Government. JJmri J,ouis Fran~ois .llfarindin, for many years an Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Smvey, and a distinguished member of the field force, died on l\:Iarch 25,
2, 1843, and recei,·ed his early education in the Swiss schools. He came to the Cnited States before attaining manhood, and finished his scholastic education in the Owego Academy at Owego, K. Y., . 1860-1863. He entered the Coast Survey as aid on November :W, 1863, and was soon assigned to duty in a party engaged in the survey of Roanoke Ri\·er, North Carolina, made at the special request of Admiral S. P. Lee, flag officer of the :Korth Atlantic blockading squadron, the party being quartered 011 the gunboat .C,cJ1mollr for that purpose. In 186..J. he served in a topographic party at work in the vicinity of Bermuda Hundred, \'a., under

the orders of ::\fajor-General Butler, with Brigadier-General \Veitzel in immediate charge of the work; and later in the same year, and in January, 1865, he sen·ecl in a topographic party engaged in work along the Potomac River under the direction of Maj. C. S. Stewart. He thus began his service to the nation of his adoption by aiding in the perpetuation of the Union, and continued to serve his country faithfully until death ended his long and honorable career. In 1865 he was engaged in special surveys for a canal route through Nicaragua, and in 1870 he was engaged in a similar work on the Isthmus of Darien. His special work in the Coast Survey was in the field of physical hydrography, and many important features in the currents and in the development of harbors and bars along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the L'nited States ha,·e been made known to commerce as the result of his systematic and careful investigation of the complex problems presented as the result of th!! action of winds and tides on the waters of the sea. He spent more than eighteen years in command of vessels of the Sun·ey while engaged in this work. On ::\larch ::q., 1897, he was appointed by President McKinley to represent the Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey on the Mississippi River Commission, and after that elate devoted much time and attention to the duties thus imposed upon him, but continued his regular work on the Sun·ey whenever it was possible to <lo so. His particular ability was recognized by numerous special assignments to duty in connection with harbor boards to establish harbor lines, and in the establishment t>f speed-trial courses for vessels of the Navy, and is shown in several scientific discussions of various physical problems relating to hydrography which ha\'e appeared from time to time as appendices to the Annual Report of the Superintendent. At a meeting of the members of the Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey, held at the Office on March 25, 1904, the following resolution was one of those unanimously adopted:
Hr it rt'so/z1cd, 'fhat the mcm hers of this service desire to express their sense of the irreparable loss sufTcre<l hy the Survey in the cleath of so able and efficient an officer, who, in the course of his scn·ice of more than forty years, ha<l distinguished himself in many branches of their common labors, aml their own sorrow in thus parting from a fricnrl cmlcarcd to them hy many charming traits of drnracter and respected by all for his steadfast clcvotion to duty .

.-Jdolp!t Lindcnko!tl, the Senior Draftsman in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, died on June 22, 1904, after a faithful and distinguished sen·ice CO\'ering the past fifty years. Mr. Lindenkohl was the son of George C. F. and A. E. Lindenkohl, and was born at ~iederkaufnngen, Hesse-Cassel, Germany, on l\farch 6, 1833. He was educated at the Realschule (Cassel, 1844-1849) and the PolyteclmischeSchule (Cassel, 1849-1852), graduating at the latter institution in l 852. Soon after graduating he came to the United States and engaged in teaching for two years. In 1854 he became a citizen of his adopted country and was appointed draftsman in the Coast Survey, and held this position with distinguished ability until the day of his death. He spent much of his leisure time in studying the \'ast physical problems relating to the earth, devoting himself especially to physical geography, oceanography, and deepsea temperatures, densities, and currents. Numerous articles upon these subjects were written hy him and have been published as appendices to the Coast and Geodetic Survey Reports, in Petermanns Mitteilungen, and in the American Journal of Science. He was always much interested in geographical exploration and spent a good deal of time in compiling maps from original sources, unofficially. His ahility was rewarded in the Coast Survey by rapid promotion through all the grades of his profession until be

became a recognized authority on chart publication. Being endowed with a remarkable memory for facts and dates, his intimate acquaintance with the chart work of the Survey during the fifty years of his service was of Yery great value in all matters concerning the compilation of charts from the older records, and the numerous drawings compiled and made by him during the last half century bear witness to the skill and fidelity which distinguished his career. His work was always rapidly executed and characterized by accuracy. During the civil war, in 1862-1864, he was detailed to serve with the Army as topographer, thus aiding in the preservation of the Union. His first service was in aiding Assistant A. M. Harrison in the topographic survey of the northern bank of the Potomac River in the vicinity of Rosiers Bluff in December, l 862, under the direction of the Engineer Department of the Army. In the following summer he was assigned as topographer under the direction of Col. J. H. Alexander, acting chief engineer of the defenses of Baltimore. At the request of the chief engineer of the Military Department of West Virginia, Lieutenant :\1eigs, Mr. l,inclenkohl was detailed in October, 1863, to as.o.;!st in compiling the data which had been collected at Clarksburg from army surveys and by expeditions of the cavalry forces. Other material, proc11red from the records of surveys at Annapolis and Baltimore, ::\1<l., and from the Engineer Bureau, was made auxiliary to the preparation of a military map of the department. Mr. Lindenkohl also assisted in the construction of a large map of the em·irons of Cumberland and computed the longitude of a number of places in the State, from sextant observations by Lieutenant Meigs. He was employed in West Virginia until the 16th of February, and then returned to duty in the Drawing Division of the Coast Survey Office. Mr. Lindenkohl wm; a member of the following Societies: The American Association for the AdYancement of Science, the Washington Academy of Sciences, the Philosophical Society of Washington, and the National Geographic Society.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

Hydrography: 152 miles lines sounded. ro 700 soundings made. 12 tide stations established. 15 hydrographic sheets completed.

Hydrographic examinations on the coast of Maine were assigned to Assistant Boutelle, commanding the steamer Bache. The vessel left Delaware Breakwater on August r7 and proceeded to Bar Harbor, Me. Field work began in that vicinity on August 20 and was continued until August 26, when the vessel left for New York under instructions for special duty in connection with the patrol of the first annual regatta of the New York Bay ~egatta Association. (See Special Duty.) Field work was resumed on September 4 and continued without forther interruption until November 4. During this time hydrographic examinations were made in the following lo~alities, viz: Eastern Bay, White Ledge, Winter Harbor, Mouth of Blue Hill Bay, vicinity of Green Islands, Harrimans Ledge, Blue Hill Bay, York Narrows, Penobscot Bay, vicinity of the Sloop and Barred islands, Muscle Ridge Channel, Hurricane Sound, Muscongus Sound, Johns River, mouth of Kennebec River in vicinity of Bath and Richmond, Casco Bay in vicinity of Stave Island, and two ledges in Saco Bay off Old Orchard Beach. The iield work of the party under Mr. Boutelle closed on November 4, when he transferred the command of the ship to Assistant P. A. Welker. Further details of the work are given under Mr. Welk er' s name. Mr. Boutelle states that all the officers, except the Chief Engineer, took part in the. surveying operations and in the navigation of the vessel, and testifies to the willingness and efficiency with which they performed the duties assigned them, and Mr. Atkinson receives special mention as a very able and efficient navigator and seaman.

COMPASS RANGE MARKS.

DELAWARE.

J. B.

The erection of marks on Delaware Breakwater, entrance to Delaware Bay, to serve as ranges in the determination of the deviation of ships' compasses, was assigned to Assistant Boutelle. _ The exact location of all the marks had already been determined by Assistant H. L. Marindin, who had also ordered the marks, and Mr. Boutelle found them at Lewes, Del., when he arrived on May 13. These marks are galvanized iron tubes 14 feet long and 5 inches in diameter, set about 3 feet in the stone forming the breakwater, in the proper positions to indicate, when used in connection with a single back range, angular changes of r 0 in the lines joining the ranges. The zero mark, or range indicating the true north and south line, has. an iron triangle bolted to the top of the iron post, and the posts indicating the line of 5° west of the zero mark and the lines of 5°, 10°, 15°, and 20° east of the zero mark have circular targets bolted to their tops. These targets are formed of iron rings filled with wire netting with large white figures at their centers indicating the proper number of degrees from the zero mark which the line joining them and the back range makes with the north and south line. The other posts marking the degrees up to 5° west and up to 20° east of the zero mark are without targets. A house 011 the breakwater prevented the use of posts to mark the line of 7° and 8° east of the zero mark. The back mark to be used in connection with all the marks on the breakwater is the east one of two tall chimneys to a fish-oil factory at Lewes, and on this -chimney a white band, 12 feet wide, was painted near the top. Ships anchored off the breakwater can determine the compass corrections by noting the bearings of the ranges as the ship swings with the tide. The work was completed and Mr. Boutelle reported at the Office on June r.

Hydrographic examinations on the coasts of Virginia and Maine '"ere assigned to Assistant Faris, commanding the steamer Bla/,:e. On August 7 the vessel, with Assistant E. B. Latham temporarily in command, proceeded to make magnetic observations afloat in the vicinity of Old Point Comfort by swinging the ship, and in the afternoon sailed for Winter Quarter Shoal. Several hours were spent in sounding in this vicinity without developing any indications of the reported shoal. The ves.'iel reached ~ew Bedford on the 10th, and magnetic observations were made the same day hy swinging the ship. A tide gauge was established, signals were erected, and hydrographic work began on the 12th and was continued until the 20th, when Assistant Faris came on board and relieved Mr. Latham of the command of the ship. \Vork in Buzzards Bay was then suspended and preparations were made to take up the examination of Nantucket South Shoals in the vicinity of Nantucket light-vessel. Soundings began on August 27 and were continued, whenever the weather permitted, until October Io. In the development of Phelps Bank a notable change in the depth

of the water was found. Most of the shoal spots reported by passing ships were found to exist. The execution of this work was difficult and unsatisfactory 011 account of the fog, haze, and windy weather that prevailed and the irregularity of the tidal currents in this locality. Continued bad weather made it desirable to close work on Nantucket Shoals at this time. On October 12 the de,·elopment of certain critical spots in Buzzards Bay was resumed, and was completed on the 15th. On the 19th Rhode Island Rock, near Cottage City, Mass., was located, and magnetic obse;Tations were made at a station on shore near Kew Bedford. On the 20th magnetic observations were made afloat by swinging the ship, and on the same

This closed the hydrographic work for the season, and on October 22 the ship sailed for Baltimore and reached there on the 26th. Durin.g the voyage such magnetic observations as the weather permitted were made daily, but a complete set could not be made until the 25th, in Chesapeake Bay. Assistant Faris states that all the officers on board, ~xcept the Chief Engineer, assisted in the general survey duties assigned to the ship, and expresses his hearty appreciation of the way in which they cooperated with him in carrying out his instructions.

On July 1 the continuation of the resurvey of the Severn River was in progress under the direction of Assistant Flower, commanding the schooner 1lfatcliless. The topographic work was done hy Mr. Lat'1ders and Mr. Maupin and was completed within the limits assigned on July 22. The hydrographic work was completed on the 25th and the vessel sailed for West River, via Annapolis, for supplies, and resumed work in that locality on July 29. Nearly all the hydrographic signals built during the previous season were down. These were rebuilt and others were constructed for the work in hand. Mr. Maupin was placed on shore at West River with a plane-table party to continue the interior topographic work while the vessel completed hydrographic work oi1 the eastern shore. On August 8 the vessel returned to \Vest River and completed the hydrographic work on the west shore from Franklin Point to Thomas Point, including \Vest River, Rhode River, South River, and the shoal water offshore to a depth of 5 fathoms on October 14. This compkted work of the party under Assistant Flower, and on October 15 the vessel proceeded to Baltimore. Mr. Flower states his pleasure in commending the officers of the vessel for their valuable and efficient services and for the zeal and cheerfulness with which they performed the duties assigned to them.

and Belfast on the 31st. After considerable delay a suitable launch was hired for the work. Several of the old triangulation stations were soon reco\·ered and signals were erected by using poles cut by the party, as it was impracticable to obtain sawed lumber. A plane-table triangulation was extended from the old work up the Medway and Belfast rivers to a point 1 mile above Belfast. The shores of the river are formed of marsh, which is covered at high water, and consequently it was nes:essary to build platforms as supports for the plane table. The shore line was surveyed between Sunbury and a point 1 mile above Belfast, and the hydrography covered the same region. The work w.as completed, and on April 18 Mr. Forney started to the Office.

DETAILS OF FIELD

OPERATIO~S.

Hydrographic examinations and surveys in the Yicinity of Key West, Fla., were assigned to Aid \V. E. Parker, commandiug the If_ydro.[rrnpl1cr, and he reached Key \Vest on December r 3. The signals in use during the previous season were found in position and only needed slight repairs. The tide-gauge station on Saml Key was recovered and a gauge was installed. From December to March unfavorable weather prevailed aud slow progress was made. Lines of soundings were made at intervals of 50 meters in two directions, nomial to each other, and these distances were subdivided whenever the soundings iudicated that this was desirable. A considerable portion of the area was coyered with the channel sweep in use. The Southwest Channel was sounded for a width of one-fourth of a mile, from the Middle Ground to and across Satan Shoal, by lines a1ong the channel, and wherever the width of the channel made it practicable to maneuver the yessel these lines were crossed by others. Dangerous localities were covered with the channel sweep in use, to determine the greatest depth which could be carried over them with safety. In addition to the work mentioned above, an examination was made of several shoal spots in this vicinity. A channel was developed between Satan and Vestal shoals, and its limits and depths were determined by using the channel sweep. The hydrographic work was completed on June 3, and a topographic sun'ey was then made of the water front at Key West. On June IO the vessel sailed for St. Catherine Sound, Georgia, and reached there on the r 6th. Two tide gauges were established and the positions of signals were determined for use in the hydrographic survey of the entrance to St. Catherine Sound. This work was completed on June 30.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

The hydrographic examination of the Hudson River in the vicinity of Peekskill, K. Y., was assigned to Aid Quillian. He arrived at Peekskill in the launch Inspector on August 5 and made all necessary preparations for the work, under the direction of Assistant J. B. Boutelle, who had accompanied the party for the purpose of starting the work. In the vicinity of Stony Point lines of sounding were made along the ri\'er be<! and cr~ssed by a system of lines normal to the direction of the river, all lines being 200 meters apart. Off Jones Point similar lines were sounded at intervals of r 40 meters, and these were crossed by other lines oblique to the direction of the river. Off .triangulation station Gra\'el the distance between the lines of soundings was decreased to r 20 meters. From August 28 to 3 r the work was temporarily suspended while the party assisted in patrolling a regatta held by the Kew York Bay Regatta Association in the Kill von Kull. The work was completed 011 September I I. On September I 7 the launch, with the party on board, left New York via the Delaware and Raritan Canal and Cape !\fay, and reached Beachhaven, N. J., on the 23d. Signals were erected at old triangulation stations and the positions of other points were determined. Necessary repairs to the launch and unfavorable weather delayed the beginning of the work until October 19. The hydrographic work consisted of the sur\'ey of Kew Inlet, outside from a point opposite 1'ucker Beach Light to a point a short distance south of Little Beach Life-Saving Station, and offshore to the 3-fathom curw; and inside, the main channel to the northward was surveyed to the head of Tuckers Island, and the Shooting Thoro up to Se,·en Islands. Two systems of sounding lines were nm normal to each other with intervals of from r 50 to 200 meters. A survey was mnde of the shore line of Little Beach and the islands inside, and also of the changes at Tuckers Beach since the previous survey. The work was completed in the latter part of Kovemher and the launch was taken to Atlantic City and stored. The party disbanded on December 5.

Hydrographic examinations, off the coast of Maine, off the coast of Virginia, and off the coast of New Jersey, and magnetic observations at sea were assigned to Assistant \Velker, commanding the steamer Bache. The vessel left Baltimore on August 13 and proceeded to Winter Quarter Shoal, off the coast of Virginia, where several miles of lines were soui1ded without discovering any uncharted shoal. At Delaware Breakwater, on the 15th, observations were made to determine the magnetic variation in this vicinity. For this purpose two complete sets of observations were made by swinging the ship and noting the deviation of the standard compass. One set was made in the morning and the other in the afternoon, the deviation being noted on the sixteen main points of the compass by swin~ing the ship in each set with the starboard and with the port helm. From August 16 to November 4 Mr. Welker was <tbsent from the ship on other duty, and the account of the work of the party during this period is given under the name of Assistant J. B. Boutelle, who was temporarily in command. An attempt was made to discover a shoal reported in the vicinity of Boon Island Light-house, Maine, but without success. This work was completed on the 9th, after several days' delay on account of unfa\'orable weather, and the ve~sel then proceeded to New York to make a special examination

in the vicinity of Sandy Hook Light-ship, where a shoal had been reported. The shoal was found and developed, the entire locality being thoroughly covered by sounding and by going over the area with a channel sweep. The work was ag-ain delayed by unfavorable weather and was not completed until November 25, when the vessel sailed for Baltimore, arriving there on the 27th.

On July 1 the hydrographic resurvey of Kettle Bottom Shoals in the Potomac River was in progress by a party on the steamer E11dca-vor under the. command of Assistant Young. 'rhe work was continued whenever the weather and other conditions permitted until November 8, when the work closed for the season, and the vessel sailed f~r Baltimore. The work consisted in developing the shoal spots, which are very numerous in that portion of the river between Cobb Point Bar Light and Lower Cedar Point Light-house, and the progress was slow, as the shoal spots are generally small and difficult to locate. A small buoy was placed over each spot selected for examination, and radial lines of soundings were made from it as a center in various directions, covering the area in its vicinity. A hydrographic survey was also made of Mattox Creek and Munroe Bay, and tide observations were made at Colonial Beach the· entire season. Between Julv 7 and 12 the vessel was at Norfolk having repairs made, and the launch was absent on special

duty August 27 to September r 1. From September 6 to 8 the Endeavor was detailed to patrol duty in the Potomac regatta, under direction of Assistant D. B. \Vainwright, and 011 the 9th was hauled out at Alexandria, Va., to dean her bottom and paint the propeller. The Yessel arrived at Baltimore on November 9. On February 15 Assistant Young, commanding the Endeavor, sailed from Norfolk, Va., for Key \Vest, Fla., with Mr. Charles H. Lewis on board as pilot. The vessel reached her destination on the 23d, and some necessary repairs were made. The hydrographic work began on March 2, and systems of lines normal to each other were sounded at intervals of 30 meters. The greater portion of this work was done with the channel sweep in use, and many shoal spots were discovered in this way which were not indicated by the soundings, in spite of the fact that they were uuusually close together. A shoal in the southeast channel on which the U. S. S. Jfo11tgome1y touched iu entering the harbor was located and its pos;tion determined, and it was found that the channel buoy \\'as 200 meters away from its proper position. Necessary repairs to the boilers of the vessel were made between April 26 and :'.\fay 7. The hydrographic work was completed on May 3 r. In his report Assistant Young expresses his appreciation of the courtesy and kindness shown him by Capt. G. A. Bicknell, U.S. Navy, commandant of the naval station at Key \Vest, in supplying the ship with coa~ and water and in allowing the use of the machine shop to make repairs to the ship. He also commends the proficiency and zeal displayed by the officers in perfonning the duties assigned to them. On June 5 the ship sailed for Port Royal, S. C., and reached there on the 8th. The geographic position of the new Hilton Head front range light was determined, and a line of soundings was made on the Hilton Head range from the bell buoy to the sea buoy, a distance of about 2 miles, which completed the field work for the Eeason. The vessel was detained in Port Royal until June 17, and reached Norfolk on the 19th.

303 kilometers of line completed. 76 bench marks established.

The extension of the standard levels in -Texas was assigned to G. C. Baldwin, Aid, Coast and Geodetic SurYey. He reached Taylor, Tex., on November 3, 1903, completed the necessary preparations for field work, and began observations on November 5. The levels began on bench marks previously established at Holland and ended at New Braunfels. The route followed the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway to San Marcos, via Smithville, and the International and Great Northern Railroad from that place to New Braunfels. From Elgin a branch line was leveled along the Houston and Texas Central Railway to Austin, and thence 1 3 kilometers across the country to station Barton of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian. From New Braunfels another branch line was leveled 7 kilometers across the country to station Seguin \Vest Base of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian. Seventy-six permanent bench marks were established during the season; 49 of these were new and 27 had been pre\'iously established by the United States Geological Survey. One of the monuments marking the longitude station in the grounds around the capitol at Austin and the monuments at the triangulation stations Barton and Seguin \Vest Base were used as bench marks. The usual method of work was followed and the line was leveled at least once in each direction. Temporary bench marks were established at intervals of 1 to 2 kilometers for the purpose of comparing the results obtained from the forward and backward lines. The extremely rough character of the country between Austin and triangulation station Barton caused some delay in the work, but no other serious obstacles were encountered during the season. Mr. Sewall shared in the work of making the observations during the entire season. Velocipede cars were used as the means of transportation, and the thanks of the StirYey are due the rail way companies mentioned for their courtesy in granting the privilege of using these cars on their tracks.

On July I, 1903, the reconnais.o;ance and signal-building parties under the direction of Assistant Burger were acth·ely engaged in field work, as stated in the preceding Annual Report, in the Yicinity of Felton. The work made rapid progress, and the reconnaissance was completed to the boundary line between the L'nited States and Canada on July 31. The work follows the valley of the Red River of the :·forth 011 the east side of the river, and the triangulation· stations 011 the west side of the scheme are all near the Great Northern R\ilway. The use of the grain elevators at the railway stations materially aided in the progress of the work. On August r the party proceeded to Stephen, Minn., and selected a site for a base line a short distance from the town. After marking the ends of the base line, the party and outfit went hy rail to Fergus Falls, Minn., for the purpose of extending the reconnaissance east from the vicinity of that place.

The work then follows the Missis.-;ippi River to the vicinity of Aitkin, where the work stopped for the season. The work was again connected with the triangulation of the Mississippi River Commission at Brainard station, and other stations are available for this purpose. A base line was selected and marked near Rice, Minn., and on October 7 the field work closed for the season. The progress of the reconnaissance, July r to October 7, equals 480 kilometers, measured along the axis of the scheme . .:\fr.

The extension of the triangulation northward along the ninety-eighth meridian, in Miimesota, was assigned to Assistant Burger. A signal building party was organized at Brown Valley, Minn., on May 10, in charge of J. S. Bilby, and signals were erected at six triangulation stations before the end of June. The observing party was organized at Brown Valley on May 24, and the measurement of angles began at triangulation station Drywood on May 30. Stations Layden, Enwiller, Hankinson, and Oscarson were then occupied in the order named, and the observations at Oscarson were in progress at the close of the fiscal year. Mr. E. E. Torrey died in camp on June 19, 1904, after many years of faithful service as foreman in various parties of the Survey. Unfavorable weather caused some delay in the work in the early part of June.

The triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian northward in South Dakota was in progress on July 1 under the direction of Assistant Ferguson, and the party had reached station Crane. The following primary stations were then occupied before the work closed on October 17, viz: Caldwell, l'l'liner,· Drakocola, Brock, Hansen, Jeska, Larson, \Vciss, Oakwood, Lake, Horswill, Olson, Elfring, Franklin, Helgen, :Mottnd, Boating, \Vaubay, Pickerel, Preachers Hill, Drywood, Layden, Brown Valley :Northwest Base, and Brown Valley Southeast Base. In addition to these stations, six auxiliary stations were occupied. All the necessary obsen-ations were completed on October I 7 and preparations were immediately made to continue the triangulation southward in Texas from the vicinity of Lampasas. A portion of the outfit, which was not needed in Texas, was stored at Brown Valley, and the rest of it was shipped by rail to Texas. The party started south on October 22 and reached Lampasas on the 25th. Repairs were made to the outfit and all other preparations were completed to place a signal-building p;:irty and two observing parties in the field. The si~nal-building party started to work on K ovember 4, under charge of Signalman J. S. Bilby, and on :November 10 the light keepers were in place and the observers were ready to begin observations. Assistant W. H. Buq.~er had repoTted for duty as chief of the second observing party and remained with. Mr. Ferguson during the occupation of the first two stations, May and Gabriel, and the observations at these stations were divided between these two observen;. On :November 19 Mr. Burger began work with a separate party and from that date ttntil the close of the season the two observing parties were at work continuously whenever the weather and other conditions permitted until January 1 I, when the obsen·ations were completed for the season. The following triangulation stations were occupied, viz: May, Gabriel, Post, Buzzard, Travis, Shovel, Shingle, Barton, Cedar, Carpenter, Loneman, Krueger, Hugo, Gus, Bear, Mission, Tieken, Seguin East Base, Seguin \Vest Base, l\lott, Herndon, Central, Thomas, Lavernia, Serita, and Stockdale.

He reached Gah-eston on November 18 and immediately visited the office of Capt. Edgar Jadwin, Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, in charge of the harbor improvement at Galveston, for information as to the best available site for the tide gauge. The officer in charge of the office offered the use of a tide-gauge house at Fort Point, the best available situation for the gauge. The necessary repairs were made and a self-registering tide gauge was mounted and placed in running order. The tide staff was referred to permanent bene:h marks by leveling and the work was completed on November 29.

A self-registering magnetograph was in continuous operation during the year, and absolute observations for the determination of the base lines were made once a \Yeek and of the scale values once a month. On the 1st and 15th of each month, the magnetograph was run at a rapid rate for two hours to cooperate in the international programme of observations undertaken June r, 1903. Two hands, D. C. Sowers and J. P. Ault, were employed at this observatory and performed such duties as were assigned to them. Mr. H.

159 kilometers of line completed. 46 bench marks established.

The extension of the standard levels eastward from Seattle, \Vash., was assigned to G. C. Baldwin, Aid, Coast and Geodetic Survey, and he reached Seattle on May 1. A party was organized and preparations were made for the field work, which began on the 7th. The line began on the reference bench marks for the tide gauge at Seattle and was extended along the Northern Pacific Railway to Auburn, and thence eastward along the same railroad to Clealum, where the party was at work on June 30. The work was done in the usual manner, and all portions of the line were leveled at least once in each direction. Instead of establishing temporary bench marks, as usual, a nail driven into the woooen posts erected by the railroad company at nearly all mileposts to support extra rails, was used. The rods were supported at turning points on the rails of the roadbed, except that foot pins were used as often as possible when trains passed and during very windy days. In the progress of the work it was carried through the Stampede Tunnel, 2 miles long. While working in the tunnel, small electric reading lights were used by the observer and rodmen, and the rods were illuminated by using acetylene gas lamps. The work in this tunnel and the steep mountain grades over a portion of the line retarded the progress of the work considerably. The officials of the Northern Pacific Railway were unwilling to grant the privilege of using velocipede cars on their tracks, but they generously placed a freight car at the disposal of the party and hauled this car from place to place as requested. No charge was made for this service, which greatly facilitated the progress of the work in the sparsely settled region over which a portion of the route passed. The thanks of the Survey are due the company for the above and other courtesies extended to the party. The chief of the party commends the service of all the members, and especially mentions the efficient work done by Mr. George W. Myers, Recorder.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

Rodgers, in charge of the suboffice at San Francisco, Cal. Ile reported to Assistant Rodgers on October 9, and the work in the field covered the period from October 23 to January 6, A self-registering tide gauge was established on October 23, and a continuous record was obtained for two and one-half months. A short base line was measured with a steel tape, from which a triangulation covering the area to be surveyed was extended to a connection with the triangulation of San Francisco Bay. Crosssection liues were run at intervals of 25 feet by leveling, from the line of mean low water to an elevation of 40 feet, and the elevation was determined at each intersection. From these ele\·ations contour lines at intervals of 2 feet up to 30 feet were determined with a plane table. The lines of mean high water and of mean low water were also determined. The cross-section lines were extended offshore to a depth of 50 feet. A line marked at intervals of 25 feet was fastened on shore and then stretched over the water, and the soundings were made at the points indicated by the marks, and the time was recorded at intervals of five minutes, in order to correct for changes of the tidal level. This system of doing the hydrographic work was suggested by Assistant Rodgers, and was entirely satisfactory. The progress of the work was slow on account of unfavorable weather, which delayed the completion of the work until January 6, when the party was disbanded.

The determination of the longitude of Chinook, ::\font., from Helena as a base station was assigned to Assistants Eimbeck and Preston, who were placed in charge of cooperating parties. Mr. Eimbeck reached Chinook on September 11, 1903, and immediately selected a suitable site for the longitude station. A pier was erected to support the astronomical transit, and a small observatory was constructed for temporary use. After considerable delay the observatory was connected by wire with the \Vestern Union Telegraph lines at the railroad station, but the preliminary test of the line connection with Helena could not be made until September 20. Further delay was caused by cloudy weather, and the observers were not ready to exchange stations until October 7, when the first part of the work was completed. Mr. Eimbeck waited in Chinook until :\fr. Preston arrived, and went to Helena on the 11th. It was cloudy on the 12th, but observations were obtained on the 13th, 14th, and 15th, thus completing the determination of the difference of longitude between Helena and Chinook. . While at Helena :\Ir. Eimbeck measured a short base line and connected the longitude station with one of the triangulation points of the United States Geological Survey, and determined the geographic position of three church steeples at the request of the officer of that Survey who was extending the topographic survey in the vicinity. Mr. Eimbeck left Helena on October 24 en route to \Vashington. Mr. Preston reached Helena on September 14 and immediately began preparations for the work. There was some delay in securing workmen to build a pier and to connect the astronomic station with the main line of the \Vestern Union Telegraph Company, and the station was not ready for ast.ronomic observations until September 23. \Vhile waiting for the cotnpletion of this work, observations were tnade to determine the elements of the earth's magnetism. On September 23 preliminary observations were made, but bad weather prevented regular observations until the 28th, and the necessary observations were not completed until October 7. On the 9th Mr. Preston proceeded to Chinook to exchange stations with Mr. Eimbeck, and made magnetic observations on the 12th and I 3th, and again on the 19th and 20th. The astronomic observations at Chinook were completed on the 15th. On October 24 he went to Glasgow, Mont., and made observations to determine the elements of the earth's magnetfsm at that place. He completed the work on the 26th. and closed field work for the season on that date.

The extension of the primary triangulation in Oregon was in progress on July r by a party under the direction of Assistant French, and on that date the observing party was ready to mo\·e from station Roman to station Spencer. The following stations were then occupied in the order stated, viz: Spencer, Peterson, Mary, Yam, Hult, Barnes, Larch, Rocky Butte, River, Oregonian, Warren, Harney, Rauch, South Base, and University. Rocky Butte, River, Oregonian, and Harney were occupied as secondary points to connect the Columbia River triangulation and the bench mark and astronomic station at Portland, Oreg., with the work in hand. University was used to connect the bench mark and astronomic station near Eugene, Oreg. Four additional secondary stations were occupied to connect a general land survey monument in the vicinity of Portland. The astronomic azimuth of a line in the main scheme of triangulation was determined at fotir stations, viz: Spencer, Mary, Yam, and Barnes. It was necessary to erect signals at 6 out of the 19 stations. Heliotropes, lamps, and signals or targets were used on this work. In spite of these precautions the work was considerably delayed by unfavorable weather conditions. The observations for horizontal angles were made in the afternoon and at night until midnight whenever the lights could be seen. The signals or targets were rarely available for observations except on lines less than 20 miles long, and then only under favorable conditions. The light from the lamps was too indistinct for good observations on lines over 40 miles long unless the atmosphere was fairly clear. The positions of a number of mountain peaks were determined. At Portland connection was made with a bench mark established by the United States Geological

At Eugene connection was made with a bench mark of the United States Geological Sun·ey and with the old obser\'atory on Skinners Butte. The \\'Ork of preparing the stations for occupation, of opening trails, etc., was done by a sul>party in charge of the foreman, D. A. I.,ewis, who did his work in a thorough, expeditious, and complete manner. There were only three stations where it was necessary to use pack auimals. Observations were discontinued on October 14. and the party proceeded to Eugene, where the property was stored and the party disbanded. ::\fr. French started on the r 8th to extend the reconnaissance to the southward from the line Yellow to Fairview, and continued the work until Koyember 20, aided by Foreman Lewis. Fourteen stations were visited on this work and a scheme of triangulation was selected which extends the work 350 miles southward to a junction with the transcontinental triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel on the line :\fount Helena to Marysville Butte. \Vork on the primary triangulation north of San Francisco was resumed in April by Assistant French. He reached Tacoma, Wash., on April 2, and began the work of reconnaissance immediately. Stations were selected to connect the Tacoma longitude station with the triangulation and a site for a base line \\·as also selected. Five days were spent at Eugene, Oreg., putting the camp outfit in order and completing the organization of the party. On April 12 the outfit for the building party was sent by rail to Corning and for the observing party to Marysville, Cal, while Assistant French yisited two stations on reconnaissance. The building party in charge of D. A. Lewis, Foreman, started from Corning on April 2 r, and prepared the following stations for occupation before June 30, viz: Kent, Round, Bally, Redding, Astronomic Station, Mears, Spur, Boliver, Gazelle, Sterling, and Soda. At Round, the lines to the other stations were cut through timber and at two of the stations the construction of trails was especially difficult. At Mears station, it was necessary to build ladders for use in reaching the station. Mr. Lewis is commended by his chief for his faithful attention to his work and for accomplishing so much in the face of so many difficulties. The observing party was left at work preparing Marysville Butte station while Mr. French visited Snow Mountain to verify the reconnaissance and post a heliotrope. He returned to Marysville Butte on May 2, and the observation of angles began on the following day. There was considerable delay at this station caused by unfavorable weather, failure of heliotrope to show, etc., and finally a severe storm destroyed the tent and injured the instruments by rolling some of them off the low signal on which they were mounted to the rocks below. Deep snow was encountered at Snow Mountain, and the wind was very strong nearly all the time. The observations at Lyons were made by l\fr. J. S. Hill, Aid, while Mr. French was on reconnaissance in the vicinity of Mount Shasta. Mr. Hill also made the observations at station Bally while l\Ir. French was on reconnaissance near the California-Oregon boundary. The following s'tations were occupied in the order named: Marysville Butte, Snow Mountain, Kent, Lyons, Round, Redding,

On July l, the standard levels were being extended westward in \Vyoming by a party under the direction of Aid H. D. King, and the work had reached a point l 3 miles east of Greenriver. The leveling instrument was accidentally injured on July 8, and this caused several days' delay, but with this exception the work proceeded without interruption until July 31, when the levels joined the line from the westward at a point about 2 miles west of Azusa, Wyo. The route followed the Union Pacific Railroad and the usual method of leveling was followed, all portions of the lh1e being leveled at least once in each direction. On August r, the party proceeded to Pocatello, Idaho, a station on the Oregon Short Line Railroad; and on August 3 began leveling northward from that place. This region is more favorable for leveling operations than western \Vyoming and the wind does not blow so continuously. The track is laid on the ground without ballast, and portions of it have been sprinkled with oil. In addition to this the trains were not so numerous as on the Union Pacific Railroad. In September a change in the method of supporting the level rods was introduced. On the previous work the rods were al ways held on '' foot pins'' or '' foot plates''

made stable for the purpose, but in this month the observer satisfied himself that the use of the steel rail as the rod support was desirable from the fact that more progress could be made and that no loss of accuracy would result from its use. The rods were placed on marks made on the rails, and the use of the rails became more and more general as the season advanced until a point was reached where the ''foot pins'' were ''only used in emergencies.'' The observer recom111ends this method in regions ''where the rainfall is light and comparatively few trains nm.'' The work was continued to Owyhee, Idaho, where the field work closed for the season on October 26 and the party was disbanded. The usual methods were followed except as noted above, and all portions of the line were leveled at least once in each direction. Permanent bench marks were established at suitable intervals, and numerous temporary bench marks were used as the means of comparing the results obtained in the forward and backward lines. Velocipede cars were used as the means of transportation throughout the season, and the thanks of the Survey are due the Union Pacific and Oregon Short Line Railway companies for their COJtrtesy in granting the privilege of using their tracks.

302 kilometers of line completed. 33 bench marks established.

On July r the standard levels were being extended eastward from Ogden, Utah, by a party under the direction of Aid R. L. Libby, and the work had reached a point in the vicinity of the Aspen Tunnel on the Union Pacific Railway. This tunnel is more than a mile long and repairs were in progress in the tunnel (with a construction train running in and out) making it i111practicable to level through the tunnel, and the line was carried over the top of the mountain. Heavy grades on the railroad and strong wind also delayed the work and slow progress was made. On July 31 the levels joined the line from eastward at a point 2 miles west of Azusa, Wyo. The route followed the Union Pacific Railway and the usual method of leveling was followed, all portions of the line being leveled at least once in each direction. The party then went to Ogden, Utah, and extended the levels northward from that place along the Oregon Short Line Railway to Pocatello, Idaho, where the work closed September 30 on bench marks established earlier in the season by Aid H. D. King. In August the use of steel '' foot pins '' as rod supports was abandoned and the rods were held on the rails of the railroad, a mark being made on the rail to indicate the exact spot. The observer satisfied himself after several trials '' that the rail returned to its former position after a train passed.'' \Vi th this exception the usual method was followed and all portions of the line were leveled at least once in each direction. Velocipede cars were used as the means of transportation, and the thanks of the Survey are due the railway companies, mentioned above, for their courtesy in granting the privilege of using their tracks.

The suboffice of the Survey in San Francisco was continued under the charge of Assistant Rodgers, who attended to numerous duties, many of them matters of routine, as the representative of the Superintendent on the Pacific coast. All matters referred to the suboffice were promptly attended to. Various officers were temporarily attached to the suboffice during the year, and others were on duty there completing the records of the field work done under their direction. Assistant Rodgers had general direction of a special sun·ey in San Francisco Bay near California City, made by Assistant H. C. Denson at the request of the ='l'avy Department. A continuous record of the tides at the Presidio station was obtained, with H. S. Ballard as Tide Observer. Mr. Ballard is commended for his faithful attention to duty. Mr. James Sullivan, Chief Engineer, is also commended for his useful and efficient service while temporarily attached to the suboffice. Robert E. Carson served as messenger until January 4, when he became ill. He died on June 26 and was succeeded by Henry Bernhardt, who held the position until April 7. Peter A. Thomasen and George A. 1vlcEldowney held th.e position at different times during the remainder of the year.

The extension of the standard levels westward from Owyhee, Idaho, was assigned to F. H. Sewall, Aid, Coast and Geodetic Survey. He reached ~ampa on May 4, and began leveling the next day at Owyhee, Idaho, starting from bench marks established at that place during the previous fiscal year. The route followed the Oregon Short Line Railroad to Huntington, Oreg., and thence along the line of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, and reached the vicinity of Durkee, Oreg., by the end of J tme. Velocipede cars were used as the means of transportation, and the thanks of the Survey are due the corporations mentioned for their courtesy in granting this privilege. All portions of the line were le\·eled at least once in each direction and temporary bench marks were established at frequent intervals, to afford the means of comparing the results obtained by the lines in opposite directions, in addition to the number of permanent bench marks stated above.

the lau:nch in tow, arrived at the working ground on the 6th. :Next day a tide gauge was established and a reconnaissance was made for a safe anchorage, which was found in an arm or bay on the south side of Davidson Inlet just inside the entrance, and this body of water was named Port Alice. On the night of the jth it began to blow and by morning it was blowing hard and a heavy sea was rolling in, which washed away the tide gauge in the forenoon. The ship and launches crossed Iphigenia Bay and found a safe ~nd quiet anchorage in Port Alice. On September 1 I another tide gauge was established, and on the 24th the topography and hydrography were begun. The topographic work was done by Mr. Morford with Mr. Stiles as his aid, and the hydrographic work by Mr. Stanford, \Vatch Officer, and Mr. Miller, Aid, with Doctor Ballard as recorder, both parties using launches, while the commanding officer extended the triangulation up the Inlet, toward the Holbrook Fishery, using the Cosmos. There was great difficulty in keeping the signals up, and so field work was closed on the 30th of September. The vessel then proceeded to Sitka, via Fort \Vrangell, and stored the Cosmos and Launch No. I Ij. ()11 October IO the vessel sailed for Seattle, and reached that place on October 23. On October 13, while passing the light-house on Five Finger Islands, a signal was received desiring to communicate with the ship, and a boat came off containing the first officer and five men of the steamer Fara/Ion, with the information that this yessel had broken her shaft and lay anchored in an exposed position in Frederick Sound. The Gedney proceeded to the locality and towed the Fara/Ion to a safe anchorage off Tonka Cannery, in \Vrangell Narrows. The GednCJ' left Seattle on October 29 and reached San Francisco on November 4, after passing through a southeast storm lasting four days. Mr. Dickins states that the officers of the ship all attended to their duties faithfully and well, and were always ready and willing to perform all duties assigned to them. He reports that the pilot, Capt. A. C. Jansen, was an exceptionally good man for the place, being well acquainted with all parts of southeast Alaska and taking a great interest in the work. Captain Jansen's advice was often of great assistance, and he is thoroughly trustworthy an<l reliable. \Vork in Davidson Inlet was resumed in June hy Assistant Dickins, commanding the steamer GcdneJ'. The vessel sailed from Seattle on June 6 for Alaska, yia Union Bay, British Columbia, for coal, and reached Sitka on the 12th. The Cosmos and I.,aunch Xo. 1 lj were put in order and the ship reached \Varren Cove on the 23cl, and the erection of signals began the same day. A tide gauge was erected and tide observations began on the 28th. The triangulation work commenced on the 29th, and all the work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

On July r the party on the steamer Patterson, with Assistant Pratt in command, was engaged in running a line of deep-sea soundings from Juan de Fuca Strait to Alaska to obtain information desired by Gen. A. V·l. Greely, Chief Signal Officer, U. S. Army, to be used in laying a cable from Seattle, \Vash., to Alaska, as stated in the previous Annual Report. The line of soundings reached Sitka Sound on July 3, and was extended to the entrance to Chatham Strait on the 8th. Soundings were made in the lower portion of Chatham Strait on the 1 rth, 13th, and 16th, and the relative positions of Hazy Islands, off the e1itrance to the strait, were determined by sextant angles. The ship then proceeded to Juneau to furnish information to the cable ship Burnside, and returned to Sitka on the 2 rst. A reconnaissance was made between Cape Bingham and Cape Edgecombe for the purpose of determining the position of objects on shore to he used in connection with the deep-sea soundings off this locality. On July 27 the line between Sitka Sound and Prince \Villiam Sound was begun and continued until August 7, when the work was sw;pended off Cape St. Elias. Magnetic observations \Vere made at a station on Yakutat Bay. The survey of Controller Bay was begun on August 8 and continued until September 19 whenever the weather was favorable and other conditions permitted. The triangulation was extended from a line already established in the Copper River Delta to the eastward as far as the northeast corner of Kayak Island, and a base line was measured on Octalee Spit. The topographic work consisted of the survey of a portion of Kanak Island and a small portion of the shore line at the moqth of Bering River. Hydrographic work was done in the lower portion of Octalee Channel. On September r9 telegraphic orders were received to close work and proceed to Kiska, Alaska, for work in that vicinity. The vessel went to Orea for coal and then sailed for Dutch Harbor, and reached that place on tl}e 29th. En route, on the 25th, a crack developed in the outer corrugation of the port furnace, which proved to be too serious to permit the voyage to Kiska. Eight clays were spent in making temporary repairs, and 011 October IO the vessel sailed for Seattle, and reached that place on the 20th.

On July 1 the survey of Prince William Sound, Alaska, was in progress under the direction of Assistant Ritter. A brief statement in regard to the work, :tvfay 18 to June 30, appears in the previous Annual Report, but the following general statement refers to the work of the whole season, May 18 to September 30, while summary of results applies only to the work between July 1 and September 30. The hydrographic work extends along the eastern side of Prince \Villiam Sound from the southern end of Bligh Island, across the entrance to Fidalgo Arm, and thence to Knowles Head. The soundings extend offshore to deep water, 200 fathoms or more. The area sounded includes the waterway between the mainland in the vicinity of Knowles Head and Goose Island and that portion of Fidalgo Arm extending from the entrance inland as far as Fish Bay. The soundings also covered the minor bays in this region known as Fish, Landlocked, and Bowie bays, and Snug Corner Cove. Tide observations were made in Snug Corner Cove. They began on June 1 and were continued until September 19. From June 1 to July 14 they were made continuously, day and night, and coesisted of hourly readings, with readings every ten minutes from thirty to sixty minutes before and after each high and low water. After July 14 the readings were made only during the day. Whenever the steamer Taku was at Orea for coal or stores, simultaneous readings were made on the staff at that place and at Snug Corner CO\·e. Current observations w~re made at a number of stations during the season in the vicinity of Knowles Head and Goose Island, and at the entrance to Fidalgo Arm. The topographic work augmented the work of previous seasons by extending it some distance inland. The c~untry thus mapped embraces the northern shore of Valdez Ann from Point Frcmantle to the vicinity of Saw Mill Bay; Bligh Island; the area between Tatilack Narrows and Celena Bay; the vicinity of Copper Mountain; vicinity of Knowles Head; and both sides of Fidalgo Arm from the entrance back to Fish Bay. In addition to this the shore line on both sides of Fida Igo Arm and in the adjacent bays, from the entrance to Fish Bay, was surveyed. The small steamer Ta!m and a launch were used by the party during the season and the party li\'ecl in camp on shore. The work for the season closed on September

The trigonometrical connection of the island of Niihau with Kauai, Hawaii, was assigned to Assistant Alexander. He made preparations for the work and reached Kauai on December 4. Mr. S. :\1. Kerns of the Sur\'eyor's office was detailed by his chief, ::\fr. 'J..l. ll. \Vall, to assist in the work, and he went at once to Niihau where he measured a base line and occupied se\'en triangulation stations which he established on the island. He also observed the magnetic declination at Nonopapa and at Kii. On Kauai the distance from Pun Lani to Pnu o Papai, previously determined was' used as a base from which to extend the triangulation necessary to furnish the positions needed in the connection. Dr. A. C. Alexander assisted in this work and occupied the two stations Pun ka Pele and Puu Opae. An azimuth was obser\'ecl on Kauai. Acknowledgement is made to Mr. B. D. Baldwin, manager of the Makaweli plantation, to Mr. A. F.

S. A. DEE!,.

The work at the Honolulu Magnetic Observatory in Hawaii was done by Magnetic Observer Deel, under the direction of Assistant Fremont Morse, J nly 1 to October 31, and on Ko\·ember 1 the charge of this work was transferred to 1\fr. Deel. A practicaJly continuous record of the relative changes in the magnetic elements was obtained on the self-registering magnetograph throughout the year. The absolute values of these elements were determined once a week. Observations to determine time were made three times in each month. A new recording apparatus was installed on January 5 and the work of testing it began immediately, and was in progress on June 30. The seismograph was kept in operation during the year except for eight days (April 16 to 22) when no suitable photographic paper was available. Meteorological observations were made throughout the year. A small building was erected to be used for office work and quarters.

The survey of Hanapepe Bay, Kauai, Hawaii, was assigned to Aid H. D. King. He reached Honolulu on February 8, and after making the necessary preparations to begin the work, proceeded to Eleele on the r 2th. A tide gauge was established and some of the o.Jd triangulation stations were reco\·ered. The lines between these were used as bases to determine the additional hydrographic signals needed. The topography was limited to the delineation of the shore line. The hydrographic work was done from a boat not suited to the work and with a native crew who understood ,·ery little English, as the only means available. The weather was yery unfa\·orable and the person engaged as recorder proved to he incompetent. In spite of these conditions the work was continued until :'!larch 9, and on the r 1th the party returned to Honolulu. The continued rough weather made it advisable to close operations as soon as the absolutely essential work was completed. Magnetic obsen-ations to determine the declination were made at two stations, and the correction for the compass declinomder used was determined at the Honolulu Magnetic Observatory. J. \V. Milburn, Aid, assisted in the work enumerated above.

FREMONT MORSE.

As'!'RONO;\IIC Ons1mv ATIONS.

On July 1 the work of extending the longitude connection across the Pacific Ocean was in progress, with Assistants Smith and Morse in charge of cooperating parties. On that date Mr. Smith sailed from Honolulu for Guam, while Mr. :Morse remained at Honolulu for the purpose of determining the difference of longitude between these two stations by joining the cable temporarily at Midway Island. Mr. Smith reached Guam on July I 4, and in the afternoon of the same day went ashore at Soumaye, where the cable had landed, and through the courtesy of Mr. Daniel Coath, the superintendent of the Guam cable station, was enabled to bring his outfit ashore the next day and establish himself near the proposed longitude station. Mr. Coath was instructed by Mr. George G. \Vard, vice-president and general manager of the Commercial Pacific Cable Company, to facilitate the work of the longitude party in every way in his power, and the assistance rendered by him was most important and necessary to the success of the work. Mr. Smith called on the governor of Guam, and he also courteously offered to do everything in his power to facilitate the work. The work was greatly delayed by rainy weather, but everything was in readiness on the 27th, and on that date the cables were joined at Midway Island and signals were exchanged with Honolulu, but they were not suitable for use in the longitude work, and the attempt to eliminate Midway as a longitude station was abandoned. Mr. Morse then proceeded to Manila, and reached there on August 31. The officers of the cable company at Manila did everything in their power to expedite the work of preparation, ·and Maj. \V. A. Glassford, Signal Corps, U. S. Army, had the observatory and cable office connected by telegraph and telephone wires. The thanks of the Survey are due these gentlemen for their courtesy and kindness, and especially to Major Glassford for the promptness and energy displayed in erecting the wires mentioned above. Observations were made and signals exchanged between Manila and Guam on September 8, 12, 14, 15, and I6, thus completing the work at Manila. Transportation .from Guam to Manila was easily obtained, but there was no regular communication in the opposite direction, and consequently the plan of having the observers exchange stations was abandoned and Mr. Morse sailed from Manila on September 19 for Honolulu, via Hongkong, en route to Midway. He reached Honolulu on October 15, and was fortunate in securing his passage to Midway on the U. S. S . .Iroquois, which sailed from Honolulu on October 29 and reached there on November 3. There are no facilities or supplies at Midway except those of the cable company, and everything needed for an indefinite stay there was procured in Honolulu and carried on the Iroquois. Everything was ready for observations on the 13th, but clouds prevented work until the r6th, when the observations began and were continued on all available nights until December 5, when _the ten nights' work desired was completed. While at Gaum Mr. Smith made magnetic observations at five stations, viz, Agana, Dano Island, Merizo, Soumaye, and Umata. Mr. Smith sailed from Guam for Manila on January 10, en route to Honolulu. He re~ched Cavite about 5 p. 111. on January 15, and fortunately found the Pathfinder anchored near by. A steamer was due to sail

the next morning for Hongkong, and Assistant Gilbert, commanding the Patlijindcr, made it possible for Mr. Smith to take this steamer by transporting him and th<.:. outfit to Manila the next morning, thus enabling him to make close connection with the steamer for Honolulu. These details are stated to show the difficulties in the way of prompt transportation in this region, which greatly delayed the work. Mr. Smith reached Honolulu on February 8 and promptly prepared for work; but bad weather interfered and no observations were made until February 22, and the necessary work was not completed until March 24, as Honolulu proved to be an exceptionally unfavorable place for astronomic observations. On the date mentioned, March 24, 1904, the determination of the difference of longitude between San Francisco and Manila, begun during the previous fiscal year, was completed, except for the detennination of the personal equation of the observers, and the observers deserve credit for the manner in which the numerous difficulties and obstacles encountered were overcome. Mr. Morse returned to Honolulu on the U.S. S. Iroquo£s on April 16, but transportation to San Francisco could not be obtained until April 26. An effort was made to obserye for personal equation of the observers, but bad weather prevented work except on two nights, and the results were unsatisfactory. Messrs. Smith and Morse reached San Francisco on May 2, and the observations for personal equation were completed on May 9, and the field work closed on that date. In closing his report, Mr. Smith expresses the highest appreciation of the attention and kindness shown the observers by the officers of the cable stations, and of the generous cooperation of Mr. George G. Ward, vice-president and general manager of the Commercial Pacific Cable Company. Without this aid the work would have been extremely difficult if not impracticable.

The important work of surveying the coast of the Philippine Islands was continued under the direction of Assistants Putnam and McGrath, July 1 to April 30 and May 1 to June 30, respectively, who represented the Superintendent in all matters requiring immediate decision. In performing this duty they adopted plans for field operations, issued instructions for field work, compiled all data secured, and prepared and published charts of the waters surveyed. Notices to Mariners and Sailing Directions were prepared and published. 1'hey were aided in this work by such advice and instructions issued from \Vashington as became necessary. The work continued under the plan of cooperation between the Philippine Commission and the Coast and Geodetic Survey adopted in 1901 and stated in the Annual Report for 1 902. The field parties were at work in various localities, as shown in the following statement and in the following abstracts from the reports of the chiefs of the parties.

FIELD WORK.

Nortlz coast ef Luzon.-The triangulation and topography was extended from Bontolan Point to Bolinao, where the field work was suspended at the beginning of the rainy season. This survey shows the actual shore line and correct representation of· all towns, roads, natural features, and prominent landmarks. The triangulation stations on which it is based have been carefully marked and will supply bases for extensions of future caclastral surveys and for studies for works of public improvement. Point Dile to Culili Point.-A hydrographic survey was made of this section of the coast of Luzon, including surveys of Port Currimao and Salomague Harbor. ,1fani!a Ba;'.-An inshore hydrographic survey was made of the waters of :Manila Bay from Malate to a point 4 miles SW. of Sangley Point, including a large scale survey of Bacoor find Canacao Bays; the topography was completed from Cavite to a point on outside coast clue we-;t of Cavite Viejo; a topographic su·rvey was made of the coast line around Malabon; and an examination was made for a shoal off the east encl of Caballo Island, marked doubtful on recent charts, but no such danger was found in the position hitherto given. Danao River and approaclzcs.-The lower part of this river, to the highest point serviceable for navigation, and the coast line around to Escalante, was surveyed. This embraces the only protected harbor on the north coast of A'cgros. North coast ef Pana)'.-A complete survey (triangulation, topography, and hydrography) was made of this coast from Capiz to Fort Batan with the exception of topography and hydrography of Sapian Bay, the change of monsoon pre\·enting the completion of Sapian Bay. LagonOJ' Gu((.-A complete survey was made of Lagonoy Gulf and 'fobaco Bay, embracing the triangulation, topography, and hydrography. This includes south coast of Catai1duanes Island from Point Nagumbuaya to Sialot;. Luzon from Point Bungus to Bagacay, and from northwest point of San Miguel Island to northeast end of Batan Island. The shape of the coast line of Catanduanes Island was materially changed by this survey, but the most important result was the proof of the freedom of the waters of the gulf from large areas of shoals hitherto shown on the charts. Jloilo Strait and approaclzes were surveyed on a large scale. The triangulation was extended from a line joining Dumangas Point, Panay, with the northeast point of Guimaras Island, to a line joining Point Dolores, Guimaras Island with Talisaya Point, Pana)'· The topography was extended from Dumangas Point, Panay, to Tigbauan and from northeast point of Guimaras Island to Point Dolores on west coast of Guimaras Island. A detailed survey was made of Iloilo River. The hydrography extended from a section 8 miles east of Siete Pecados Light, including the Iguana Bank, to a junction with the work of the Navy in Iloilo Harbor, the navy work being supplemented hy the survey of a section extending from Lusaran Light-House northward, which includes Ports Santa Ana and Igan. This survey removes the doubt felt as to the practicability of the use of the eastern approach to Iloilo by large vessels, and shows that a good safe passage for vessels drawing 30 feet exists. Guimaras Strait. -The survey of this strait was begun on January ro, and continued until March 27, when the steamer had to return to :Manila for docking and repairs. The triangulation was extended from center of the strait to its southern end;

the topography was embraced within the same limits and the hydrography co\'ers almost ai1 equal area. In the course of the work Rosario Rock was found to he three-fourths mile northwest of the position shown 011 the charts, and a very much more dangerous condition was found to exist on Pandan Shoal. The snrvey also shows considerable changes in the appearance of the coast line and in the area covered. Gcograp!iic j>ositious. -The latitudes and longitudes of Cu yo ( 011 Cu yo Island) and San Jose de Buena\'ista, Panay, were determined during the year, thus completing the list of desirable points for which necessary telegraph connection could be secured at the time. 11-fagnclic obscrvations.-To secure information necessary for charts, magnetic obser\'ations have been made at eight stations. Meridian lines have been laid out at the astronomic stations, and azimuth determinations in connection with all the triangulation work, to enable surveyors with ordinary instruments to readily lay off true meridians from any two intervisible triangulation stations. Tide obscr<:atious were made at ten stations. Nine of these were in connection with the various hydrographic operations. At :Manila the tide record is a continuous one for the year; at Iloilo a similar record was obtained for ten months. These supply valuable data for the predictions in the annual tide tables published by the survey for the Phil. ippine Islands. Pcrsonnd.-The field work has been executed by the following chiefs of parties: J. J. Gilbert, Assistant CJ uly 1 to January 3 r), and Fenlin:rnd \V estdahl, Assistant (February r to June 30). general sttr\·cy work with steamer Patlijiudcr; John E. McGrath, Assistant, astronomic determinations; \ \7. B. Fairfield, Assistant, astronomic, magnetic obsen·ations, topography, and triangulation work; \Villiam Bowie, Assistant, general sun-ey work; H.

Derickson, Assistant, general survey work with steamer Rcsearr/1; John Bach, Obsen·er, triangulation and topography. Steamers. --The Coast am! Geodetic SmTey steamer Patlijiuder was employed in surn:ys in the archipelago previous to May 27, when it was found necessary to send her to Hongkong for repairs. The steamer Rl'st:ard1 was acti\·ely employed throughout the year, with the exception of the period between :\larch 27 and Jnne 10. During this time she returned to l\Ianila for repairs, and then went back to her working ground. Fi,·e clifTerent shiplrnikling concerns submitted tenders for the construction of the new steamer which was provided for by the Commission, ancl the terms of the Hongkong and \\'hampoa Dock Company proving to be the best, a contract ,\·as made with them 011 January 27, which was approved by the civil go\·ernor. On Febrnary 3 I\Ir. Charles C. Yates, Assistant, proceeded to Hongkong to act as the inspecting officer of construction and the progress 011 the vessel was very satisfactory; two-fifths of the contract price has already been earned. The steamer is framed, engine, bed plates, and cylinders are cast, crank and propeller shaft forged, small boats framed, and ship's fittings are well under way. According to the terms of the contract the steamer should be ready for her trial trip ou October 15, 1904.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904. OFFICE WORK.

The scheme of organization of the Manila suboffice continues the same as heretofore reported, and its detailed operations are as follows: In November extensive changes were made in the quarters in the Intendencia Building, enlarging greatly the space assigned to the computing and drawing sections, improving the light and air conditions ·and placing an admirably situated chamber at the disposal of the office as a store room for instruments and general property of the Survey. Computing.-The Computing Division conti1iued in charge of Mr. E. R. Frisby, who was regularly assisted by Mr. F. F. Pangan, Junior Computer, and l\Ir. Ignacio Cruz, Junior Clerk. Messrs. McGrath, Ferguson, Fairfield, Flynn, Assistants, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Mr. Staples, Aid, Coast and Geodetic Survey, and Mr. Bach, Observer, were employed in the division at different times on computations necessary ·for the completion of the field work executed by them and while awaiting orders for the field. The following is a statement of the work executed in this division during the time covered by this report:

Tabulations of hourly tide readings were made from records with self-registering gauges at the following stations for the periods stated: Manila, Io months. Iloilo, 9 months. Capiz, 2 months. Inampulugan Island, 2 months: Puerto Galera, 2 months. Mangarin Bay, 2 months. Port Sual, 8 months.

The regular list for issue of the Notices to Mariners now calls for 734 copies'of each edition, and 11 numbers were published in the period covered by this report. Drawing.-The chief duties of the Drawing Division are: the inking of topographic sheets and the plotting, inking, and verification of such hydrographic sheets as can not be completed in the field; the preparation of projections for field parties; and the preparation of finished drawings for chart publications. At the date of the last report the force of draftsmen comprised Messrs. P. B. Castles and J. P. Keleher in charge of th.e subdivisions of the division, and IO native draftsmen. In January the force of native draftsmen was increased to 15, and on the departure of Mr. Castles the entire charge of the division devolved upon Mr. Keleher, who is still in charge, Reduction of tide staff readings and comparisons with a principal station were made for Siete Pecados, Santa Ana, Batan, Dagupan, and Bvlinao. Reductions of soundings were made as follows:

Duplicates were prepared and verified of all records not completed in field and of all computations and abstracts of results prepared or received in the suboffice. Information in the shape of descriptions of stations, instrumental constants, and triangulation sketches was supplied to field parties and in reply to requests from various sources. ·The local values for magnetic declination and standard geographic data were prepared for charts in process of construction. Sailing Diredions.-In th!'! nautical information section, Mr. J. C. Dow, Nautical Expert, in charge, continued the preparation of the "Notices to Mariners,,. wherein the earliest information of all changes of which reliable information can be secured and which are of importance to mariners is communicated to the public. In addition to this work Section II, Philippine Island Sailing Directions, southwe8t and south coast of Luzon from Manila to San Bernardino Strait, was revised and published; Section III, Sailing Directions for the coasts of Panay, Negros, Cebu, and adjacent islands, and Section IV, Sailing Directions for the coasts of Samar and LeJ1le and the east coast of Luzon were revised, rewritten to a large extent, and sent to the printer. The prepa-

ration of the Sailing Directions necessitated trips of inspection to the sections noted and actual verification (where no recent surveys have been made) of all new material that had been collected. The nautical information section in Manila offers all the cooperation within its power to the maritime interests and every possible assistance that lies v..ithin the capacity of a hydrographic office is always at the service of shipping interests. The demand for the Sailing Directions is evidence of the importance of the work. The work of verifying every step in the production of the charts which insured the independent checking of e\'ery sounding, position and feature which they contain was clone by the Chief of the Bureau, the Chie( Draftsman, :t\-Ir. Charles C. Yates, Assistant, July r r to December 31, and l\fr. \Villiam Bowie, Assistant, April 23 to June JO. The work of the native draftsmen is surprisingly excellent and their services are worthy of great praise, but as only two of them ever had experience in the class of work on which they are now engaged, scarcely anything can be left to their initiative and the work of supervision has to be incessant and untiring.

The Sun·ey is indebted for many favors to the bureaus and offices of the general and insular governments, and particular acknowledgment is made of valuable information and material help received from the bureaus of coast guard, transportation, and engineering, from the chief quartermaster, the chief engineer officer, and the chief signal officer of the United States Army in the Philippines, and from the masters of the merchant marine, and who attest by their ready response to requests for cooperation, their appreciation of the efforts being made to improve the charts and Sailing Directions of the Philippine Islands up to the requirements of modern standards. The cost of the Survey, as in the past year, has been met by a division of expenses between the United States and the insular government. The United States has defrayed all the expenses for the field officers and experts detailed for service in the islands, the lithographing, engraving and publishing of charts, and furnished the instrumental outfit and supplies from the United States. The insular government has defrayed the local field and office expenses, maintained the steamer Researc!t, and is paying for the construction of the surveying vessel now being built at Hongkong.

graphic survey was made of the Iloilo River and of the approach to the United States Army pier and landing at Buena Vista, Guimaras Island. The topography included the details visible from the shore line. Current observations were made at fi\'e stations, at one of which, in Iloilo Harbor, the observations were continued for twenty-four hours at spring tide. A continuous record was obtained on the self-registering tide gauge during the progress of the work, and it was left in operation in charge of a native under the direction of the provincial supervisor. For reduction of soundings distant from this gauge, observations were made on staff gauges established at Siete Pecados and at Port Santa Ana. The field work closed on February 25 and the party returned to Manila. Mr. John Bach did the triangulation work and assisted in the hydrographic and topographic work. Mr. Sparrow did topographic work and ::\fr. Staples assisted in the hydrographic work. Mr. Bowie reports that all these officers did their work faithfully and well.

On July I the survey of the entrance of Danao River, Negros, was in progress under the direction of Assistant Derickson, commanding the steamer Research. The old triangulation stations were recovered and the topographic survey was extended 6 miles up the river and along the coast to Escalante. A traverse line was run across the -land between Escalante Bay and Danao Ri\'er and the survey of the shore line was extended around Point Ocre. The hydrographic survey was made in connection with the other work. The difficulty of obtaining fresh water delayed the work considerably during the season. This work closed on August 5. The necessary preparations were made, and the survey of Capiz Roads on the north coast of Panay began on August I7. A triangulation was extended from the geographic station at Capiz to Port Batan and a survey was made of the shore line between these places. A hydrographic survey was made of Port Batan and of Capiz Roads, but the shifting of the monsoon prevented the completion of the hydrographic survey connecting these two places and the development of the outside reefs. The work closed on December 12 and the vessel proceeded to IloilJ. The survey of the south end of Guimaras Strait was resumed on January 10. The triangulation was extended across Guimaras Island and Strait to the west coast of K egros from the points previously established in the survey of Iloilo Straits. A short base line· was measured on Susan Island for immediate use, and this was subsequently connected with the main scheme of triangulation. The topographic survey included both shores of Guimaras Straits and the intermediate islands, the south end of Guimaras islands, and the Unisan group of islands, the work being done by Mr. F. B. Loren. A )1ydrographic survey was made of the main channels and the banks and reefs were developed. The work was suspended on March 27 and the Research proceeded to Manila for repairs. On June 10 the work on the north coast of Panay, suspended in December on account of the monsoon, was resumed and was in progress at the close of the year.

The steamer Patlz.finder, with Assistant J. J. Gilbert in command, left Manila on July r 5 for the purpose of running a . line of deep-sea soundings from a point off Lingayen Gulf to a point northeast of the island of Formosa. The reel holding the sounding-wire had been immersed in oil since 1900 and should have been in good condition, but the wire parted in attempting to make the first sounding when the sounding-rod was a short distance below the surface of the water. The wire was then tested by attaching a sinker, but the wire parted again after reaching bottom in 2 roo fathoms in the attempt to reel in. An unsuccessful attempt was made to refill the reel at sea and the vessel then proceeded to Amoy, China, to have her

The first sounding was made at r r a. m. with the Tanner machine at a point 45 miles northeast from Agincourt Island. The vessel ran S. ro 0 E., sounding at intervals with the Tanner machine until 7 p. m., when the use of the Sigsbee machine began in r 100 fathoms of water. Soundings were made at regular intervals, except when delayed by a break in the wire or some other accident, until 5.30 p. m. on the 29th, when the last sounding was made off the coast of Luzon, P. I. Courses and distances were recorded until the position of the ship was secured off Capones Light. The vessel returned to Manila on the 30th of July.

Preparations were made for the survey of Lagonoy Gulf, and the vessel left Manila on August r 1 and reached the field of work on the r 3th. Signals were erected and the triangulation, topog-rarhy, and hydrography began and progressed as rapidly as the conditions permitted. By the end of the month the work was brought up to Tabaco Bay, and three clays later the tmsurveyed portions of the topography arou!1d the bay was completed. After some delay in securing coal and other supplies, the triangulation was cxt~ndecl tp the head of the gulf and the topographic and hydrog:raphic surveys of the gulf were completed. On October 30 the last sounding was made and the vessel started for ?lfanila. The next morning a line of sounding was started from a point near Maraud uqui Island and continued at hourly intervals until night. The vessel reached :Manila at 11. 30 p. m. the same day. In the sun·ey of Lagonoy Gulf the topographic work began at East Point, Batan Island, and was extended all around the gulf to ~ agumbuyan Point, including several miles in Tabaco Bay to fill in gaps in the previous work in this vicinity. The hydrographic work with the launches was extended out to the 100-fathom curve except to the cast of Calanaga Bay, where it does not extend out .quite so far. A self-registering tide gauge \Vas maintained at Tabaco during the prngress of the work, but no other tide observations were made. On December 14 supplementary survey work wa~ taken up by the party on the Patltfindcr in :Manila Bay, vicinity of l\falabon, while some necessary repairs were being m::ule, which kept the ship in the dcinity of ?lfanila. This work included the topographic survey of Canacao Bay and the coast southwest from Sangley Point for a distance of 3 miles and the hydrographic survey from a poif1t near Paranaque to the limit of the topography. Special work was clone in Canacao Bay at the request of the commandant of the Cavite ~avy-Yard. The positiom; of all mo0ring and wreck buoys within the area surveyed were determined. The work was completed on January 27.

that caused by the exceptionally unfavorable weather. From September to November a great deal of rainy weather is usually to he expected at Iloilo, hut during this period in 1903 an extraordinary amount of bad weather was encountered, and the observations to determine the difference of longitude between Iloilo and Cnyo were not completed until November 20. Observations were made at Iloilo to determine an azimuth for use in the triangulation in the vicinity. On December r the station at San Jose was ready for a)l exchange of signals, but the necessary observations to determine the longitude were not completed until December· 13. The weather continued bad until the r 7th, when the attempt to secure more observations was abandoned, and on December 2 r Mr. McGrath sailed for Manila and reached there on the 24th. The character of this work rendered it necessary to make many demands upon the officers of the Army and Philippine Constabulary for facilities and assistance at various points, and Mr. McGrath states his pleasure in acknowledging the unvarying courtesy and kindness with which all his requests were granted. At Ormoc, Manila, and Iloilo, the aid desired was instantly granted by the officers of the Quartermaster's Department, and the cooperation of the Signal Service could not have been more generous or more thorough. Mr. Fairfield sailed from Manila for Cuyo, Cuyo, on August 23 and reached there on the 25th. He was ready for work on the 28th, hut rainy weather prevailed and it was not possible to make observations for time and exchange signals with Iloilo on any night during the remainder of the month or during September. In October almost the same unfavorable weather conditions prevailed. Observations were made on a few nights, but until the 29th it was either rainy or cloudy at Iloilo. A complete set of observations were made on the 29th, and the weather was clear on the 3 rst, but the telegraph line broke down and_ no signals could he exchanged. Broken sets of observations were made on October 3, 11, 14, 15, 19, and 20, when the necessary observations were completed. Observatiops to determil1e the latitude and magnetic observations were also made at Cuyo. On November 29 Mr. Fairfield went to San Jose de Buena·>ista, Panay, and on December l was ready for ;)hservations, but bad weather prevailed until the r 2th and 13th. On these dates good sets of observations were obtained. Bad weather again prevailed until the 19th, when the attempt to secure other obsen·ations was abandoned in order to take advantage of an opportunity to leave this unfrequented port, and Mr. Fairfield sailed for Manila, where he arrived on December 27. Obsen·ations were made to determine the latitude at San Jose and magnetic observations were also made. The stations were marked in a permanent manner.

The hydrographic survey of the west coast of Luzon, hetwee11 Point Candon an Currimao, was assigned to Assistant Westdahl, commanding the steamer Patltjindc; The vessel sailed from Manila on March 8. A stop of two hours was made at ti: entrance to Manila Bay, and an examination was made for the purpose of locating shoal reported off the eastern encl of Cavallo Island, but no shoal was found. Only general examination was possible, as no signals were available. The ship reached tl1 working ground on March 9, and a self-registering tide gauge was established ~ Salqmague, where observations began on the 15th. Tha triangulation stations we1 recovered and signals were erected from Salomague Island to Pinguet Island to tli southward, the positions of additional stations being determined whenever necessar) To the northward a boat could not be used on account of the heavy swell, and so party was sent overland under a military escort provided by the insular authoritie: Soundings were made from the boats whenever the heavy swell permitted, and wit the ship offshore at such times as the work inshore was not practicable. The wor was interrupted once in order to permit the vessel to return to Manila for coal. 0 the return trip the vessel experienced the effect of a northerly current of two miles pc hour in the vicinity of Salomague. \Vhile sounding off point Culili the heavy swe was breaking on all reefs dangerous to the ship, and consequently soundings could 1: made close to them and to the sandy shore between Point Culili and Currimao. A hyclrographic survey of Currimao anchorage was made on a large scale and ab a resurvey of the shore line. A tide staff was erected in the mouth of a small lagoo in a sheltered part of the bight and continuous observations were made during tile tw days the sounding was in progress. This work was completed on ::Vlay 14, and on th 16th the ship went west to Pinguet Island and took up the work in that vicinity.

Hydrographic work on the east coast of Porto Rico and magnetic observations at sea were assigned to Assistant Faris, commanding the steamer Blake. The vessel left Baltimore on March 5, and magnetic observations were made the same day in Chesapeake Bay off the mouth of the Patuxent River, by swinging the ship, and on the following day in Hampton Roads. l\fr. D. L. Hazard, Computer .in the Division of Terrestrial l\fagnetism, assisted in this work and then landed at Norfolk. The vessel sailed from Norfolk on March 9 for San Juan, Porto Rico, and reached there on the 15th. During the voyage magnetic obsen·ations were made by swinging the ship every day when the weather was suitable. The vessel reached Vieques Sound on the r 7th and on the r 9th magnetic observations were made in the usual manner. From March r 8 to May 30 the hyclrographic work proceeded without material interruption. Almost half the work of the season consisted of reexaminations of passes and channels, leading into Vieques Sound, with the channel sweep. The previous work was extended offshore to deep water (over 350 fathoms) along the whole of the north shore of Vieques Sound from Virgin Passage to a point 7 miles to the westward of Cape San Juan. All this work was done with the deep-sea sounding apparatus except the development of the western part of Cordilleras Reef, which extends about s miles west of Cape San Juan. About 3 miles of this reef was examined closely with the . channel sweep. A number of spots in the vicinity of Culebra and Culebrita islands were specially examined and additional buoys and ranges were charted in the vicinity of Culebra Island. About 20 square miles of area lying immediately to the eastward of Arenas Point bell buoy was closely and carefully resurveyed, by using two systems of lines and the channel sweep. Tide observations were made at Fajardo during the season and temporary tide gauges were established at Target Bay and l\fangro,·e Harbor and simultaneous readings were made on these gauges and on the gauge at Fajardo for purposes of comparison. On May 30 magnetic observations were made on board and on shore at Obispo Cay, and the vessel proceeded to San Juan. On June 2 the ship sailed for Hampton Roads,

Virginia, and reached there on the 8th. Dnrini:; the voyage magnetic observations were made daily, if the weather permitted. The ship was swung twice at sea and once at Hampton Roads on the day of arrival. All the officers exce1:it the Chief Engineer and the Surgeon performed navigation duties and stood regular watches at sea. The officers all assisted in the general survey duties as.<;igned to the ship. Assistant Faris expresses his appreciation of the willingness and zeal displayed by the officers in assisting in the hydrographic and magnetic work. He also makes special mention of the uniform kindness with which Capt. Andrew Dunlap, U. S. Navy, commandant of the San Juan :Naval Station, treated the party upon all occasions.

was obtained on .the self-registering magnetograph throughout the year. Observations to determine the absolute value of the declination and horizontal intensity were made twice every week and once a week to determine the vertical force. A seismograph was installed in August and observations began September 4. Fourteen well-defined seismic disturbances were recorded. A small building was erected in December as an observatory for the absolute measures, and observations were made in it after January 4. Meteorological observations were made every day and obsenrations for time were made once a week. Special rapid registrations of the magnetic elements were obtained on the 1st and 15th of every month. Mr. Keeling reports his appreciation of the faithful and conscientious service rendered by Mr. Eustaquio Morales (employed in the observatory) in performing all duties assigned to him.

Hydrographic work 011 the southwest coast of Porto Rico was as..'>igned to Aid Lan.ders. He left Baltimore with his aid, Mr. Miller, January 27, 011 board the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Baclie, and arrived in Mayaguez February 13. The launch Rudy was taken from storage and put in order, under direction of the commanding officer of the Bac!ze, Assistant P. A. Walker, but was not ready for use until March 2. 'l'he members of the party as.-;isted in this work until February 23, when Mr. Miller and three men were established in camp at Guaniquilla Point, on the north side of Boq ueron Bay, and began building signals at the triangulation points already establii;hed for use in the hy<lrographic work. Soundings began on March 8 and were continued whene\'er the conditions permitted until March 30, when the work in the bay was completed. Inside the bay lines of soundings were made east and west at intervals of 100 meters, and north and south at intervals of 200 meters. Outside the reef at the mouth of the bay the work was extended to cover the area not previously sounded, the lines forming a rectangular system, with intervals of from 100 to 150 meters. After finishing the work in Boqueron Bay, the party was movecl to Point Jagucy and preparations were made for the hydrogrnphic work off Cape Rojo. The launch broke down and much of the otttfit was moved in the whaleboat, which caused great delay, as only small loads could be carried. Signals were erected at old triangulation · points and additional positions were determined. 'fhe hydrogrnphic work began ·on April 15, bat the launch was in bad condition and was sent twice to Mayaguez for repairs. In spite of delays from this and other causes, the work in the vicinity of Cape Rojo was completed on May 13. South and east of the cape a rectangular system of

lines were sounded, with intervals of 200 meters. To the west the work was done in a way to form a proper extension of the survey made in 1901, covering the area between that work and the shore. After completing this work, the outfit was moved to Mayaguez and stored, and the party, except Mr. Miller, then proceeded to San Juan and reported for duty on board the steamer Bache on May 2 r.

Hydrographic work 011 the coast of Porto Rico was assigned to Assistant \Velker, commanding the steamer Baclie, and he was also instructed t-0 make magnetic observations at sea on the voyage to and from the island. The first set of these observations were made in Hampton Roads, Virginia, on February 2, and on the 4th the ship sailed for Porto Rico, ancl arrived at San Juan on February IO. Magnetic observations were made every clay during the voyage. On the 13th the vessel procee<led to Mayaguez an<l the field work began immediately. The triangulation stations between l\fayaguez and Caho Rojo were recovered and additional positions were determined for the hydrographic work. The launch Rttd)' was put in order for Aid J. C. Landers, in charge of a shore party, and he was assisted in establishii1g his camp on Boqueron Bay. On February 25 the sounding work ofI the coast began, and was continued without interruption whenever the weather conditions permitted, the ship and two launches being used in the work. From Febrnary 28 to April 22 the work was done under the direction of Assistant J. B. Boutelle, who was in command of the ./Jad1e during the absence of Assistant \Velker on other duty. The channels between the reefs were sounded with the channel sweep in use, and munerous special examinations for shoal spots were made. Lines of soundings from one-half to 1 mile apart were run, and intermediate lines were sounded whenever they appeared to be necessary. In the vicinity of the 100-fathom curve the channel sweep was set to a depth of 4 Yz fathoms, and lines were sounded at inten·ah; of 100 to 300 meters. By :\lay 14 all of the work inside of the roo-fo.thom curve from Tourmaline Reef to a junction with the work finished during the previous season, about 2 miles to the westward of Magarita Reef, was completed, and on that date observations to determine the magnetic elements were made on board ship and on shore at Mayaguez. This closed the work in this locality and the vessel proceeded to San Juan.

During this season the weather was almost continuously fair, with occasional rain squalls. The sea was generally rough as a result of the trade winds, but the work with the steamer was kept up continuously. On May 18 the work off the north coast of the island to the westward of San Juan Harbor began, and was continued until the 26th, when the work in Porto Rico closed for the season. The trade winds were strong and the sea was usually so rough that only the morning hours could be used for sounding. A reported obstruction was located

On August 7, 1903, under authority of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, Assistant Baylor was detailed to duty with the joint special committee of the general assembly of Virginia, appointed to in\'estigate the present conditions of the State oyster lands. This detail was made in compliance with the request of the chairman of the committee, Hon. W. D. Cardwell. Mr. Baylor made a survey of these oyster lands for the State authorities l 892-1895. and his assistance was especially valuable to the committee. He joined the committee at Norfolk on the date mentioned, and about two weeks were spent in making a personal inspection of the oyster lands.

BAYLOR.

The survey of the natural oyster beds and reefs in the State of Louisiana begun during the previous fiscal year, at the request of the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, was continued, in cooperation with the Louisiana Oyster Commission, by Assistant Baylor, who reached New Orleans on January 27. The determination of geographic positions by triangulation was continued until April 22, when field work closed for the season. Eighteen triangulation stations were occupied and twenty-four geographic positions were determined. The positions of numerous subsidiary stations were also determined within the 75 square miles of area covered by the triangulation. The work extends over the region between the mouth of the Mississippi Ri\'er and Quarantine Bay, and along the east bank of the river and the shores of the bays to the eastward. In their annual report, the Louisiana Oyster Commission acknowledges the value of this work in controlling the sur\·eys made in subd.ividing the oyster bedding grounds, as it is possible to connect the division lines with one or more of the triangulation stations.

J. B. BOUTELLE. In response to a request from the New York Yacht Club, a speed-trial course was established in Hempstead Harbor, Long Island, New York. The work was assigned to Assistant Boutelle, and he completed the work between June l l and 25. A line, 1 nautical mile long, was measured along the shore with a tapeline, and the distance between the marks so established was then determined by triangulation from. old stations which were recovered in the vicinity. Front and back ranges were established at both ends of the course.

Copies of the rules governing the race \\'ere distributed to the commanding officers, who had authority to enforce them. In spite of very unfavorable weather, rainy and with the wind blowing at a velocity of 20 to 25 miles an hour, the regatta was held, but many of the races failed. The 1-lydrographcr was anchored at the starting line and the Bache at the finish line, while the boats were distributed along the course. Each boat of the patrol flotilla performed the duty assigned in a most satisfactory manner. The two whaleboats were ordered back to the Bache after being on duty one and a half hours, as the water was too rough for their effective use. Thirteen men were taken on board from swamped boats, and nine boats were recovered and taken to the clubhouse. The assistance rendered by the light-house officer in charge of the electric launch and her crew deserves high commendation. At 6 o'clock further attempts to race were abandoned, and the vessels of the patrol fleet returned to their respective duties. It was afterwards determined to have the unfinished races on September 12, and Mr. Ross was again placed in charge of the work of patrolling the course.

Tittmann, Superintendent Coast and Geodetic Sun-ey, and C. D. \Valcott, Director United States Geological Survey, as Commissioners representing the United States. Mr. \V. F. King, Chief Astronomer of the Canadian Department of Interior, represents the British Government on this Commission. The Commissioners had each assigned officers of their Bureaus to have charge of the work in the field, and Assistant C. H. Sinclair was detailed for this purpose from the Coast and Geodetic Sun-ey. Three parties continued the work under l\Ir. Sinclair's · direction, as follows: Assistant John Nelson, in charge of a triangulation party, began work on the east side of the Wigwam River, in Montana, in July, and extended the work toward Gateway. A base line was measured on the railroad track south of Gateway with a steel tape laid along the top of the rail. From this base line the triangulation was extended to the mountains east of Gateway and the work was transferred to the west of the Purcell Range beyond the Kootenai River. By the end of October the work had been extended nearly to Porthill, at the west crossing of the Kootenai, an<l the party returned to occupy a station northwest of Gateway to strengthen the triangulation in this vicinity. Before the station could be cleared a prolonged storm early in November forced the suspension of the work, and the party was disbanded on November 20. 1'o the east of Porthill the work joined the triangulation of the United Stat~s Geological Snn·ey extending north from Spokane.

74 miles of triangulation completed. 592 square miles area covered. 21 stations occupied.

A line party in charge of :Mr. Reinert Hanssen was at work on the line between boundary monuments Nos. 7 and 8, a distance of 13 miles, at the beginning of the fiscal year. The line clearing was completed on September 5, a great deal of this time having been spent in building 18 miles of main and side trails, to make it possible to get the pack animals with supplies near the field of work. The party was then moved to the Yaak River and began work on September 16 on the line between boundary monuments Nos. 6 and i8, a distance of 24 miles. On September 18 Mr. F. A. Camp succeeded Mr. Hanssen as chief of the party, and continued in charge until the close of the season. The work of clearing the vista and of building trails continued whenever the conditions permitted until the first week in November, when the snow began to fall and continued to fall from day to day until it was 2 feet deep on the 18th, compelling the return of the party to Gateway, where it was disbanded on the 21st.

Mr. Nelson began the work of reconnaissance on May 17 in the vicinity of Laurier, Wash., and extended it to Midway, British Columbia. Signals were erected at the stations covering a distance of 30 miles, and the triangulation was completed for a distance of 20 miles. A base line was m·easured on the railroad track south of Grand Forks. Mr. Nelson was assisted in this work by Mr. E. R. Martin, who made nearly all of the observations at the triangulation stations. Before joining Mr. Nelson on May 25 Mr. Martin traced the line between monuments 10 and 1 r, a distance of 3.6 miles. and located the positions for two intermediate monuments. He also extended a stadia line from monument 11, 3 miles toward monument 13, and then joined Mr. Nelson's party. Mr. F. A. Camp, transitman, traced the line between monuments 8 and 9 and located the position of three intermediate monuments. He also located the position for an intermediate monument 1 mile east of monument 8 and then completed the stadia line between monuments 1 r and r 3 as far as Purcell summit, in spite of the deep snow. The lines leading from Kootenai Mountain were cleared and the observations were made at this station and at several other stations near Gateway which were necessary to connect Kootenai Mountain with the triangulation along the boµndary. The trails between monuments 7 and 8 were then cleared and the work of verifying the line between these monuments was in progress at the end of the fiscal year.

My detail and that of Assistant Hodgkins to the State Department for duty in connection with the preparation and presentation of the United States case before the Alaska Boundary Tribunal at such times as our services were required, referred to in the previous Annual Report, were continued after July r by the Secretary of Commerce and · Labor. The preparations were made in Washington under the direction of Gen. John V.7. Foster, Agent of the United States, and we proceeded to London, England, and reported to General Foster in the latter part of August. We remained in London during the sessions of the tribunal, September 1 to October 24, and Ot)r service in connection with the tribunal terminated on the latter date. On February r 1, 1904, at the request of the Secretary of State, I was designated as Commissioner to represent the United States on the Delimitation Commission to trace and mark the boundary between Alaska and Canada as laid down in the award of the Alaska Boundary Tribunal at London in 1904. Mr. V/. F. King, Chief Astronomer of the Canadian Department of the Interior, was appointed Commissioner to represent the British Government on this Commission. The Commissioners were further empowered by their respective Governments to make recommendations in regard to the marking of the whole line, and the actual work in the field was begun by officers appointed by the Commissioners for this purpose. On May 4 Assistant Fremont Morse was assigned to the charge of one of the United States parties, to cooperate with a similar party representing the British Commissioner on the Alaskan boundary work in the field between Mount Whipple and Castle Peak.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1904.

He made the necessary preparations in San Francisco and Seattle, and sailed for Alaska from the latter place on "June 12, accompanied by L. Netland and Adolf Mosheim, Surveyors, and a party of 12 men. The Canadian party, under direction of Mr. White-Fraser, was found at Wrangell, and on the 16th both parties proceeded to the working ground on the Stikine River. The preliminary work to be done was divided ·by mutual agreement, and progress was made whenever the favorable weather conditions permitted. It was found to be impracticable to climb the mountains from the lower camp in time to do any work and return the same day, and consequently a light camp was established ab~ut 2 500 feet above the river, near the timber and snow line, and the remainder of the month was spent in opening a trail and packing outfit and provisions to this upper camp. The work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. Early in May Mr. J. A. Flemer, formerly an Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was engaged as surveyor to the Commissioner and assigned to the charge of one of the United States parties, to be engaged in locating and marking the boundary at the headwaters of the Chilkat River. He made preparations in Washington, and on May 16 proceeded to Seattle, Wash., where he had a consultation with Mr. C. A. Bigger1 Engineer to the British Commissioner. At Seattle Mr. Flemer completed his preparations, and on May 31 sailed for Haines, Alaska, accompanied by Messrs. J. M. Donn, Edmund Polk, and D. W. Eaton, Surveyors, and the necessary party employees. The party reached Haines on June 8 and went into camp at a point near the provisional boundary at the junction of the Tlehini and Chilkat rivers. Stations were selected and signals erected for the purpose of extending triangulation up these rivers to the peaks defining the boundary in this locality. Observations began on the 28th, and the work was in progress on June 30. The cooperating Canadian party under direction of Mr. Bigger was at Pleasant Camp in this vicinity, and the peaks defining the boundary were identified by the joint action of chiefs of the two parties as the representatives of the Commissioners.

The duty of representing the United States, as delegate to the Fourteenth General Conference of the International Geodetic Association, at Copenhagen, Denmark, was performed by me. I reached Copenhagen on August 3, and the opening session of the Conference was held the next day. I attended all the sessions of the Conference, covering the period from August 4 to 13, and presented a printed report on the geodetic operations of the United States, 19001903. The proceedings of the Conference have been printed at Leyden, under the title, "Comptes Rendus des Seances de la Quatorzieme Conference General de l' Association Geodesique Internationale, reunie a Copenhague du 4 aux l 3 Aout, 1903.'' I desire to make special acknowledgment of the many courtesies extended to me as the delegate of the United States by the Director in charge of Geodetic Operations in Denmark and his officers, as well as by the Ministers of War and State.

WAINWRIGHT.

By direction of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor officers were detailed to patrol the course of the Middle States Regatta Association on the Potomac River at Washington on September 7, 1903. Assistant Wainwright was placed in charge of this work, and was authorized by the Secretary to enforce the regulations of the Department adopted for the prevention of accidents. The steamer Endeavor and launch No. 515 were assigned to duty under Mr. Wainwright's direction. Assistant F. A. Young, commanding the Endeavor, and R. McD. Moser, \Vatch Officer, and B. D. Barker, Aid, officers of the Endeavor, were placed in charge of two rowboats and the launch for patrol duty, and the police patrol boat Vigilant also cooperated in the work in a most effective manner. Mr. Wainwright was on board the Vigilant during the time when the· patrol work was most troublesome, and reports his appreciation of the courtesy extended to him by the superintendent of police and by the harbor master, who were on board. The patrol duty was performed to the satisfaction of all concerned.

CABLE TO ALASKA.

F.

WESTDAHL.

In response to a request from the Chief Signal Officer, United States Army, for an officer of the Survey to be detailed to accompany the cable ship Burnside while laying the military cable in Alaska, Assistant \Vestdahl was assigned to this duty. He pr<?ceeded to Sitka, Alaska, and on July 6 reported to the signal officer in charge of the Burnside upon the arrival of the ship at Sitka. He remained on the ship until December 31, and during this period aided in every way in his power in facilitating the work of laying the cable. His services were especially valuable in consequence of his local knowledge of Alaskan waters, acqt~ired while in command of one of the surveying vessels of the Survey engaged in charting these waters.

The Miscellaneous Section is a part of the immediate Office of the Assistant in Charge, and the manifold and arduous duties pertaining to it were perfonned by Messrs. H. C. Allen and C. W. Jones. The details of the work in this section are given under the heading ''Miscellaneous Section'' in this Appendix. The duties of the other members of the personnel mentioned above were of the usual routine character. Mr. George A. Fairfield died on July 17, 1903. A biographical notice of this officer is given under the head of Necrology. The following extracts are taken from the report of the Assistant in Charge:
I have the honor to submit the Annual Report of the Office for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1904, accompanied by the annual reports of the various divisions, namely: Computing Division, Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, Tidal Division, Drawing and Engraving Division, Chart Division, Instrument Division, Library and Archives Division, and Miscellaneous Section.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

The Computing Division continued under the charge of Assistant J. F. Hayford, whose report gives in considerable detail a statement of the work accomplished during the year. The force of the Division, as heretofore, has been augmented from time to time a..<> opportunity offered by the temporary detail of Assistants and Aids, and Deck Officers who were available between the field seasons. Among the special works accomplished during the year the following may be mentioned: I. The computation of the primary triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian has made considerable progress. 2. The computation of precise leveling work has been kept up to date, or nearly so, continuously. 3. The reduction of the triangulation of California to the United States Standard Datum has made excellen~ progress, and is now nearly completed from the Mexican bOlmdary to about latitude 37° in the vicinity of Monterey Bay.' These computations were begun in August, 1902, and at the end of the last fiscal year were completed as far north as Point Conception. 4. The computations connected with the new computation of the form of the geoid have progressed steadily during the year. The revision of the general fornml~ for the treatment of very large areas has been a slow process, but is now nearly completed. The topographic corrections to observed deflections of the vertical to take account of the topography for a' radius of more than 4 ooo kilometers around each station has been c0111p1eted for about 180 astronomic stations. About 300 additional stations are now available for similar treatment. 5. The computations of determinations of gravity at the surface and at stations r 200 to 4 600 feet, respectively, below the surface at the North Tamarack mine near Columbia, Mich., has been completed and a special report relative thereto has been llrcpared. 6. The computation of the tests made in March, April, and l\Iay of the transit micrometer fittecl on one of our portable transits, and proposed to be used in telegraphic longitude work hereafter, have been completed and a report relatiYe thereto submitted to the Superintenuent. 'fhe routine work of the Divi~iou has received, as usual, prompt attention. The demands upon the Division in this respect have been \'ery great, both for the field parties of the Survey and for outside persons desiring special information, particularly in reganl to geographic positions and descriptions of stations. During the ye11r the manuscript for two appendices entitled, respectively, "Precise Leveling in the Cnited States, !90<>-1903" and "Triangulation Southward along the Ninety-eighth !\Ieridian in 1902" were completed and the proofs read in cooperation with the Bditor. The proof of "Report of Geodetic Operations in the l'nitecl States," which was presented to the International Geodetic Association, was also rear!. Mr. Hayford commends highly the skill and efficiency of the various computers under his charge. 'fhe Division of Terrestrial Magnetism continued under the charge of Assist.ant L. A. Hauer, who, a..~ Inspector of Magnetic \\.ork, is also charged with the supervision of the field parties engaged on magnetic work. Much of his time while at the Office was necessarily occupied with his duties in the latter capacity, involving the planning of .fiel<l work, p reparatiou of estimates and instrnctions, testing instruments, and the preparation of the necessary reports, etc. The Cheltenham Observatory required his presence for one or two days each month. l\lr. D. L. Hawrd acted as chief of' the Division during l\lr. Bauer's absence, and had immediate charge of the Office computations throughout the year. 'The routine work, correspondence, and the furnishing of magnetic i11fon11ation in response to numerous demands have recei,·ed prompt attention. The revision of the field magnetic computations has been kept nearly up to date; progress has also been made in the tabulation of the absolute observations at the various magnetic observatories; the results of the magnetic obsen·ations for the previous year were completed and submitted for publication in the Annual Report for 1903; the magnetic observations of the Bahama Expedition of the Baltimore Geographic Society were discussed and a report thereon submitted; a report was made on the magnetic survey of T,ouisiana, carried on under the joint auspices of the Coast. and Geodetic .Survey and the State Geological Survey; good progress was made in the tabulation of resull~ at repeat stations, for t1se in future secular change discussions; and a discussion was made of magnetic observations at sea, etc.

Observations for standardizing various instruments were made as occasion required, and 11ewly appointed magnetic observers received necessary instructions in the use of instrumenl~.and methods of computing results. The Tidal Division continued, as heretofore, under the charge of Mr. L. P. Shidy, whose report gi\·es the usual detailed information in regard to the work accomplished during the year, the tidal obsen·ations and data received from the field parties and from outside sources, and the information and data furnished to field parties and the public. Mr. R. A. Harris has continued the study of tidal phenomena, and has prepared an appendix on the subject of cotidal lines for the Superintendent's Annual Report, illustrated by cotidal maps for the world. The Drawing and Engraving Division, continued under the charge of Assistant W. W. Duffield, whose report shows in detail the work accomplished by each of the five sections of the Division and gives other statistical infonnation. In the Engraving Section, 8 copper plates were completed, 5 were begun, and 20 remain unfinished; 19 copper plates were completed for new editions, 22 were begun and 17 others remain unfinished; also 4 heliogravure plates were completed ready for electrotyping, and 663 plates had corrections of more or less magnitude applied. In the Drawing Section, under the immediate direction of Mr. E. H. Fowler until March 11 and subsequently under Mr. George L. Flower, the usual amount of work has been accomplished during the year. Fourteen drawings have been completed for photolithographing or engraving and 10 others are in progress. In addition to the above 658 charts were revised, corrected, and \'erified for new editions or new prints. This number, however, in some cases includes the second and thin! revisions of the same chart. Fourteen topographic and 40 hydrographic projections for use of the Office or field parties and 13 projections were made on copper plates. Two hundred ancl ninety-one topographic aml hydrographic sheets were inked, lettered, plotted, re\"ised, and made ready for the approval of the Office. A large number of illustrations for the Annual Report were prepared, and miscellaneous work of \·arious kinds has received due attention. A large commercial map of the world prepared for the use of the honorable Secretary of Commerce and J.,abor, and a bromide copy of the same for the use of the President, were completed. Considerable work in connection with the Alaskan boundary maps has also been done and the increasing work necessary for keeping up the Philippine charts, which in number are increasing rapidly, has added much detail work to the section. The Drawing Section suffered a heavy loss by the death of two of its chief members, Mr. Edwin H. Fowler and Mr. Adolph Lindenkohl, the former on the 11th of March and the latter on June 22. In the Printing Section, under the immediate direction of Mr. D. N. Hoover, the usual large amount of work has been accomplished, over 79 ooo impressions having been printed from copper plate and 14 500 from stone. The new lithographic plant was not in operation until the second half of the fiscal year and some difficulty was experienced in having the proper adjustment made of the electric motive power, but it is now working very satisfactorily. Sixteen new charts, 8 new editions of charts, and 13 new prints have been issued, a total of 37 charts, the editions averaging from 300 to 6oo copies. The work done compares favorably with any we have had performed by contract. The contract work during the year amounted to 53 charts, of which 8 were new charts, 8 new editions of charts, and 37 were new prints. In the Photograph Section a large amount of work was done and it was found necessary to detail an assistant to the photographer on account of the increasing demands upon the section. Mr. C. F. Tllacklidge has been in immediate charge of the photograph section, as heretofore. The Chart Division, composed of the Chart and Hydrographic sections, continued under the charge of Assistant Gershom Bradford, Inspector of Charts. In the Chart Section, under the immediate direction of Miss L. A. Mapes, the work of coloring lights and buoys, the application of hand corrections to charts, from recent information, the general issue of charts, etc., to the public and to the Navy and other Departments, received due attention, as did also the voluminous correspondence relating thereto, and the keeping of the accounts of 190 chart agencies. The sales of charts during the year ha\·e been !,'Teater than for any previous year.

COAST A::\'D GEODETIC SCR \'EY REPORT, 1904. In the Hydrographic Sectioi1 duties in connection with the preparation of the monthly Notice to Mariners, the verification of original hydrographic sheets and of charts and drawings, and the indicating of chart correctirms have been promptly ancl efficiently performed. Mr. Bradford has also prepared proof for a new edition of the Chart Catalogue, and during the absence of the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography, April Ir to June 20, performed the <luties of that office. The Instrument Division continued under the charge of Mr. E. G. Fischer, except during his absence in Europe, from July 1 to September 16, when he was relieved by Assistants \\'illiam Eimbeck and J. B. Baylor, the former serving from July 1 to September 4, am! the latter from September 5 to September 16. The usual amount of work has been accomplished during the year, consisting of repairs of instruments, the construction of such new instruments as are not obtainable 011 the market, the issue of instruments, camp outfit, and general property to field parties, the keeping of the accounts relative to issue and receipt of instruments and general property and the miscellaneous correspondence rclativ£ thereto, etc. :\Ir. Fischer's report gives in complete detail the work of each class accomplished rluring the year, Among the special items mentioned in his report arc the construction of two vertical collimators, the remodeling of an electric tide indicator and an astronomical transit, the progress made in the construction of the new tillc-predicting machine, the further use of aluminum alloys to obtain greater lightness in portable instruments, and the efforts and experiments made to secure the most suitable aluminum alloy for this purpose. The preparation and shipment of the Coast and Geodetic 8un·ey contribution to the 8t. J,ouis Hxposition added largely to the regular labors of the Division. 'l'hc Library and Archi\·cs Division remained nominally under the charge of i\Ir. E. L. Burchard, who was actually engaged in the work of organizing the I.ibrary of the Department of Commerce and Labor, having been detailed for that purpose until December 30, when he resigned to accept a position in the Library of Congress. Since that date, and pending the appointment of a Librarian, Assistant \Villiam Eitnbcck has perfonned the duties of Chief of the Di,·ision and has prepare<! am! submitted its annual report. This report gives the usual statistical information in regard to the acquisition of books, maps, periodicals, and charts, donated, purchased, or rccei\·ed in exchange, and the original topographic and hydrographic sheets and field records of every description receive<! from field parties. The .::\Iiscellaneous Section, under the illlmediate direction of l\Ir. H. C. Allen, has, as heretofore, attended to the ordering and distribution of supplies requirc<l for the Office, the keeping of the accounts relating thereto, the making of requisitions for printing and binding, the issue of stationery to field parties and office divisions, the custody and general domestic and foreign distribution of publications of the Survey (other than charts), an<! the kcepi11g of the records relating thereto. The report is submitte<l in the usual statisticai form. He was assiste<l by i\Ir. C. \V. Jones. The preparation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey exhibit for the 8t. I,ouis Exposition has already been mentioned umler the head of I11strulllent Division, but it may be stater! here that other divisions also co11trihutcd to the general results. The heaviest demands were, 110we\·er, made upon the Instrume11t Divisio11 ancl the Drawing ancl Engravi11g Division, hoth of which were also required to detail metnbers of their force to assist in the installation or to aid in the running of the exhibit. The details made up to the close of the fiscal year were as follows: D. N. HoO\·cr, April 26 to :\lay 18; G. \V. Clarvoe, April 11 to May 14; C. J. Harlow and E. :\I.

The work of furnishing information to the field parties of the Stir\·ey and to persons outside the Survey occupied ahout 1 o per cent of the time of the reg-itlar force of the Division. The mam1script of Appendix Xo. :;. Report for r903, "Precise Leveling in the United States, 1900-1903" (623 pp.), and of Appendix Xo. 4, Report for 1903, "Triangulation Southward along the Xinety-eighth Meridian in 1902 '' ( l 20 pp.), \\'as completed and the proof was read. The computation of the precise le\·eling work was kept np to date and the results were preparecl for publication. Considerable progress was made in computing the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian. The recompntation an<l reduction of the triangulation in California, from the southern boundary to Monterey Bay, to the United States Standard Datum was nearly completed and much of the resulting materia] was prepared for publication. The computations connected with a new im·estigation

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

of the fonn of the geoid made steady progress during the year. The reduction of the observations made to determine the force of gravity at the North Tamarack copper mine, near Calumet, Mich., at stations on the surface and at points 1 200 and 4 600 feet below the surface was completed, and also the discussion of the tests made with a transit micrometer fitted to a portable instrument. Mr. A. L. Baldwin acted as Chief of the Division October 22 to 24, and Mr. Duvall July 17 to August 12. Mr. Baldwin was absent on special duty under the State Department in connection with the Alaskan boundary for about one month in July and August. A considerable number of the aids mentioned above were appointed during the year, and were assigned to the Division for instruction in the methods of making computations before being sent on field duty. In addition to the persons named in the personnel, various typewriters were assigned to the Division from time to time for short periods to assist in handling the routine work. The average effective force of the Division engaged in making computations during the year was 12, in addition to the chief, and varied from 8 in September to 15 in ¥arch. In his report Mr. Hayford makes special. mention of the work of the members of the Division, as follows:
l\Iuch of Mr. Baldwin's work required the use of rare good judgment and it was done in an excellent manner. Mr. Doolittle rendered very valuable sen·ice in solving the difficult theoretical questions encountered in the revision of the formula! concerned in the detennination of the figure of the earth. Miss Pike had charge of the computations relating to precise levels, the preparation of manuscript for the printer, and the proof reading done in the Division. Her work was handled with rare and increasing skill. Miss Harvie assisted in revising the fundamental fonnulre involved in the detennination of the figure of the earth from astronomic observations scattered irregularly over a large area. She showed great ability and efficiency in verifying the theory involved and in the orignal investigations necessary to correct certain inaccuracies in the published theory and fonnulre, which have apparently been accepted heretofore without question. Mr. Mitchell spent much of his time in the computation of corrections to observed deflections of the vertical to take account of the known features of the topography within 4 ooo kilometers of each astronomic station. The rapid progress made in this work was due to his skill and good judgment.

The revision of the field computation of the current magnetic determinations was kept as nearly as practicable up to date, and the results for the fiscal year are published as Appendix 3. Progress was made in the tabulation of the observations for absolute values at the magnetic observatories. The results from magnetic o!Jservations, July 1, 1902, to June 30, 1903, were prepared for publication as an appendix to the Annual Report for 1903, and the proof of this appendix was read. The computation of the magnetic observations made by the Bahama expedition of the Baltimore Geographical Society was completed and a discussion of the results was furnished to the society. A report was made on the magnetic survey of Louisiana, made in cooperation with the State Geological Survey. This involved a new discussion of the secular change of the magnetic declination in the State and in the adjoining States. The results were reduced to January I, 1904, and an isomagnetic chart for that date was prepared. The discussion of the record obtained at the Cheltenham Observatory with the Eschenhagen magnetograph for a month was made and it shows in a most satisfactory manner the characteristic features of the lunar diurnal variation of the declination and horizontal intensity. In connection with the discussion of the magnetic observations at sea on board the vessels of the Survey a summary of all available results of magnetic work at sea was prepared. Good progress was made in the work of tabulating results of observations at stations where the observations have been repeated from time to time for use in the discussion of the secular change. Observations were made as required to standardize various magnetic i.nstruments and the recent additions to the force of magnetic observers were instructed in the use of the instruments and in the methods of computing. Most of the men assigned to the Division for short periods required

instruction and consequently did not aid materially in advancing the progress of the regular work of the Division. In his report the Chief of the Division testifies to the faithfulness, industry, and devotion to duty shown by the members of the Division. The duties assigned to Assistant Bauer as Inspector of Magnetic Work occupied much of his time in the office and required his presence in the field from time to time for short periods. In his absence the duties of Chief of Division were performed by Mr. D. L. Hazard, Computer.

Harmonic analyses were computed for 11 stations, with an aggregate length of years and 4 months. Nonharmunic reductions were made for 272 stations, with a total length of 58 years. 1'he plane of reference for reduction of soundings was determined for 57 stations. Tide notes were prepared for 370 stations upon 100 charts and 43 original hydrographic sheets. Tidal information was furnished to the field parties, and in response to requests from indi\·iduals not connected with the Survey in 286 instances, involving the preparation of 451 descriptions of bench marks, tidal data for 705 stations, and current data for 86 stations. About 18 years of self-registering tide gauge records, from 37 stations, were tabulated as high and low waters, and also as hourly heights of the sea. There wen: receiYed, examined, and registered in this Division an aggregate of about 20 years of record from self-registering gauges at 38 stations, together with about 7 years of record from box and staff gauges. Tidal records from outside sources were receiyecl as follows: ( 1) The ~avy Department loaned to the Sun·ey about 4y; years of records from . self-registering tide gauges at 23 stations. and 1 y; years of staff obsen·ations at 20 stations, or a total of about 6 years of record at .+3 stations. These stations were distributed as follows: 18 in Cuba, 2 in Panama, 7 in :.fexico, 8 in the Philippines, 2 in China, and 1 each in Haiti, Porto Rico, Yenezuela, ~icarngna, :\Iidway Island, and Guam Island.

(2) About a year of self-registering gauge record has been received from Nassau, New Providence Island, Bahamas. The gauge and paper were furnished by the Survey, but the station was established and maintained by the Bahama Expedition of the Baltimore Gee graphical Society, under the direction of Mr. George B. Shattuck. ( 3) From various publications received in the library the following tidal information has been obtained: About 5 f2 years of record at 64 European ports, 3 ,V;; years at 14 Arctic stations, r year at Cape Horn, and nearly 2 years at 16 scattered stations, chiefly oceanic islands, making a total of about 1 2 years of record at 95 stations. Copies of the predicted tides for \Vellington and Port Russell, New Zealand, with tidal differences for So ports, were prepared and furnished in response to a request from the Secretary of the Marine Department of New Zealand. Cotidal maps of the world were constructed and are published in Appendix 5 to this report. The tide tables for the year 1905 were prepared for printing and the proof of the first So pages was read before June 30. A current diagram for Georges Bank, Gulf of l\Iaine, and twilight tables were added to the volume. In closing his report Mr. Shidy states his pleasure in testifying to the general industry, faithfulness, and efficiency of the members of the Didsion.

A~sistant;

The Division is divided into five sections-the Drawing, the Engraving, the Printing, the Photographing, and the Electrotyping sections. Each section executes the work indicated by its title, and the combined result is shown by the charts published and issued by the Survey. During the year 353 requests for information were received and answered in the Division. These involved the measurement of areas and shore line and distances between various points, the preparation of tracings from original topographic and hydrographic sheets, copies of old and canceled charts, and the construction of special maps.

t Prepared for the States of Louisiana and Mississippi.

In addition to the foregoing, 658 charts were revised (inclnding second and third editions of the same chart), corrected, and verified for new editions or new prints. Fourteen projections for topographic sheets and 44 hydrographic sheets were constructed for the use of field part!es or the Office. Two hundred and ninety-one topographic and hydrographic sheets were inked, plotted, revised, or made ready for the approval of the Office. The illustrations required for the Annual Report of the Superintendent for the year r 903 were completed and the usual number for the Report for r 904 were prepared. A very large commercial map of the world (colored) was prepared for the use of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, and a smaller one was completed for the use of the President. A large amount of work was done for the Department of State in preparing maps relating to the Alaska bouudary for publication. The work in the Drawing Section continued under the immediate direction of Mr. E. H. Fowler, Chief Draftsman, until March 1 I, 1904, when he died. (See" Necrology" for biographical notice.) On March 12, Assistant G. L. Flower was assigned to duty as Acting Chief Draftsman, and as such performed the duties of that position during the remainder of the year. On June 22, 1904, the senior draftsman, Mr. Adolph Lindenkohl, died. (See '' Necrology '' for biographical notice.) The Chief of the Division in his report commends the efficient service rendered by all the members of the section.

The total number of impressions printed from copper· plates was somewhat less than during the previous year, but the number of charts (including new charts, new editions, and new prints) published by photolithography during the year was 50 per cent greater. Proofs on bond paper were made of all new charts, of new editions, and of all charts that were extetisively corrected. A new lithographic press was installed before the close of the calendar year and worked successfully during the remainder of the year. 1'he prints from this press already compare favorahly with those obtained by public contract. The Chief of the Division commends Mr. D. N. Hoover for his successful management of this branch of his work.

The Chief of Division supervised the work of the two sections in which this Division is divided, and gave personal attention to the inspection of the work on ne\\' charts and on new editions of charts in its various stages of progress. Progress was made in the preparation of a new edition of the Chart Catalogue, and Mr. Bradford served as Acting Inspector of Hydrography and Topography from April 11 to June 20.
Chart .'>ection.

In this section all letters relating to the sale of charts, tide tables, and coast pilots were prepared; the accounts with the sales agents were kept; the buoys on the charts were colored, and other routine work was done. Editions of 20 new charts, 18 printed by photolithography and 2 from copper plates were issued during the year. Forty new editions, 19 printed from copper plates and 21 by photolithography, were also issued. Charts were received as follows:

A comparison of the total issue of charts for the fiscal year with the issue in previous years shows the total to be 32 per cent larger than the average and I 9 per cent less than during the previous fiscal year, this falling off being accounted for in the decrease in the demand from the Navy Department and others to whom the charts are furnished free of re:ost. The Chief of Division particularly commends the efficient service rendered by Miss Mapes and Mr. Garland.

The work of indicating the chart corrections and preparing the monthly Notice to Mariners was efficiently performed by Mr. \Vyvill, and he also performed a portion of the duties of the Chief of Division during the time Mr. Bradford had additional duty assigned him, so that the current work was kept up to date. Mr. Watkins, assisted by Mr. Earle and :Mr. Proctor during theit: temporary detail to the Division, did the other work assigned to this section, as shown in the following

In this Division an account was kept of all instruments and general property owned by the Survey or purchased during the year; 1 165 instruments of various classes were put in order, adjusted, and sent to the field. :Minor repairs were made to the Office buildings and furniture, and considerable progress was made in constructing a new tidepredicting machine. A suitable alloy of aluminum for use in construction of instruments not being on the market, ~Ir. George T. Ennis, of \Vashington, D. C., made a number of experiments, at the suggestion of Mr. Fischer, and succeeded in obtaini11g an alloy combining a low degree of density with great rigidity and toughness, and this alloy is being used in constructing all portions of instruments for which it is adapted. A tapestretching apparatus and two. 50-meter tapes made for the Brazilian Government were inspected and accepted at the request of that Government. Two vertical collimators were constructed and sent to the field. An electric tide indicator was purchased, moclifiecl, and installed in the hall of the ::'vlaritime Association of New ,York. In connection with the tide gauge at Philadelphia, a tide staff was constructed with a device which is very useful in places where it is difficult to read the staff correctly on account of its position or where the water is rough. A glass tube was mounted on the face of the staff, with the lower end cemented in one encl of a U-shaped brass tubular fitting with a valve at the other end. When the staff is lowered into position, resting by a shoulder on a fixed point, the ,·alve can be opened to admit the water into the tube unaffected by wave action. By closing the valve the staff can be removed and the height of the water in the glass tube accurately read. From a description and illustration of the Repsold & Sons' transit micrometer, one was made with certain modifications adapted for use on the portable transits in use in the Survey, which has proven satisfactory in every respect when tested by numerous observers by observations made in the small observatory at the Office. From a design furnished by Assistant J. F. Pratt, an instrument called a dip sector was constructed to enable the mariner to determint~ with accuracy the actual dip on board a vessel whenever observations are made with a sextant, and this instrument is in use at present.

The increased amount of work done in this section, reported in the previous fiscal year, was maintained during the year without increase in the personnel hy means of better working facilities and some slight changes in the methods of work. The publicatioti.s received were issued promptly and all current business was kept up to date. A card record was kept of the receipt and issu~ of ail stationery, which renders it possible to see at a glance the total issue from month to month and for the year. This record has already been of value in estimating the amounts required for iuture use. The following publications were received from the Public Printer:

I::\'TRODl-CTIO:N.

The present publication contains the results of the magnetic observations made on land and at sea by members of the Coast and Geodetic Stirvey in the prosecution of the magnetic sun·ey of the United States and outlying territories during the period July 1, 1903, to June 30, 1904,* including some results obtained at sea during the period January 1, 1903, to June 30, 1903. The detailed results of the observations made at the five magnetic observatories, ·j· at present in operation, will be contained in a separate publication now in preparation. The;1ew feature in the present paper is the inclusion of the results thus far obtained at sea by the Coast and Geodetic Survey vessels in the course of their regular sun-eying duties.

COAST AXD GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1904.

tions of the Inspector of 1\'lagnetic \Vork in 1900, was made during July and August by ::..1r. S. J. Barnett, Magnetic Observer. The results of this work at 45 stations in the vicinity of Juneau and Douglas Island will be found in the tables under Alaska. The magnetic survey of Louisiana, under the charge of :\fr. L.B. Smith, Magnetic Observer, was completed this year with the effective and zealous co-operation of the Director of the State Experiment Station, Dr. \V. C. Stubbs, and of the State Geologist, Dr. G. D. Harris. The latter secured, with an outfit loaned him by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, a successful series of obsen·ations at 20 stations. The results of this detailed work in Louisiana have been extremely interesting. First, it has been clearly demonstrated that there was a reversal in the expected course of the secular variation which took 1)lace about 1898. Past observations made in the ,·icinity of New Orleans show that the magnetic declination, which is east, reached a maximum amount of about 8 Y.i'. 0 near the year l 830. It then began to diminish, and, in accordance with the laws of the secular variation pertaining north and east of the agonic line, i. e., in the Atlantic States, where west declination is known to be increasing at present on the average about three minutes per year, a turning point was under ordinary conditions not to be expected before some time about the middle of the present century. Instead, however, it was reached about 1898, so that east declination reached a minimum value of 5 Yz 0 in about seven decades after a maximum value-the shortest interval between a maximum and a minimum value thus far revealed anywhere on the earth. East declination is now increasing in Louisiana at the rate of about one and one-half to two minutes per annum. The total change between maximum and minimum at New Orleans, as abo\'e stated, was about 33'{ 0 · The early reversal produced a larger annual change between the years 1860 and l 870-about six 111inutes-tha:1 has Kenerally been experienced in the United States, although elsewhere., as, for example, England, such large annual changes and even greater ones occur. Values of the magnetic declination secured four to five decades ago, if referred to the present time \\'ith the aid of secular change yalucs as were expected, in accordance with the experience in other parts of the United States, would be in error one-third to one-half degree. Observations in other States near Louisiana show that this change in the course of the secular variation is manifesting itself in greater or less degree, according to locality, likewise in these States. How permanent the present change may be, i. e., whether it will continue for but a comparatively short period, so that before long another reversal may be expected, after which east declination will begin to diminish once more, can not be stated at present . . 'fhe magnetic sur\'ey of Louisia'na has re,·ealed other most interesting features, as shown by the lines of equal magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal intensity, drawn in conformity with the observations. There were noticed marked relations with well-known physiographic features. The curvatures and bendings of the lines of equal magnetic declination appear to conform with courses of principal streams and shore lines of certain bodies of water. Also a marked difference manifested itself in the general direction of these lines in the middle of the southern part of the State, just where there is a dividing line between the newer and older geologicl!l formations.

RESUL1'S OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

It is especially interesting that the irregularities in the distribution of the earth's magnetism, as exhibited by the three sets of lines, occur chiefly in the regions of the alluvial deposits brought clown by the Mississippi River. Owing to these irregularities the compass needle is deflected from the direction it would ordinarily have assumed by amounts varying from about o 0 · 1 to o 0 .5. They are not local disturbances of such amount, which ordinary instruments would readily reveal, but they are of such a magnitude as only approved instruments and methods would indisputably expose. This point can not be emphasized too strongly for the sake of geologists who undertake to discover relations between magnetic disturbances and geological formations, employing crude instruments, and using imperfect methods. Quite likely these irregularities are to be referred to small local deposits of iron ore brought down from the upper states hy the Mississippi River. The table below gives a summary of the results on land which appear in the present publication. \Vi th but few exceptions they were obtained during the fiscal year July .1, 1903, to June 30, 1904.

It is thus seen that results are given for 384 stations, of which about one-sixth were in old localities, for determining the secular change. 'l'he stations were located principally in Alaska, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee, the remainder being distributed over 16 other States and Territories and two foreign countries.
*Includes results in preYious years not heretofore published.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR YEY REPORT, 1904.

The stations in the Bahamas were secured by co-operation with the expedition of the Baltimore Geographical Society under the leadership of Dr. G. B. Shattuck. All of the observations were made by Dr. 0. L. Fas..,ig with instruments loaned by this Survey. Upon the completion of five years' work since the formation of the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism in I 899, it may not he amiss to take a retrospective glance of the work thus far accomplished. Observations embracing in general the three magnetic elements-declination, dip, and intensity-have been made at I 636 stations, of which about one-eighth are "repeat stations "-i. e. points at which observations had been made previously by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. · The average distance between the stations is generally about 25 miles, although in regions of pronounced local disturbances the distances are much less. The area covered is about one-third of the entire area of the United States and its outlying possessions, or over one-third of the area of the whole of Europe. About a dozen States have been practically completed except for special im·estigations and ''repeat'' observations for ascertaining the secular change, and some others are nearing completion. The results of this entire work have been reduced at the Office and either have been published already or appear in the present paper. Observatory work has been carried on at five stations already enumerated, the length and completeness of the series obtained at each varying from one to four years, according to time of establishment of the obsen-atory. The results are in process of preparation for publication. Magnetic work at sea on the vessels of the Survey was begun in February, 1903, and various results obtained, which will be found in the present publication. In addition, a variety of investigations of a miscellaneous nature, relating to instruments, constants, local disturbances, etc., have been made. While the work achieved during these past five years is gratifying, it is hoped that the next five years may witness even greater progress, as the greater part of the timeconsumiug initial work im·olved in the procuring and testing of outfits, establishment of base stations, training of observers, etc., has been accomplished.
OBSERVATIO:-.S AT SEA AND THEIR DISTRIBUTIOX.

The results obtained at sea must be secured incidentally to the regular surveying duties of the vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. It is, therefore, not possible to make rapid progress, nor can the accuracy attained be such as would he reached by vessels especially designed for magnetic work and continuously engaged therein. The problem is to secure the best possible results under the conditions i1woh-ed. All of the ships are provided with the usual standard liquid compass and azimuth circle of the Ritchie or Negus pattern, sufficiently accurate for purposes of navigation, but not especially designed for magnetic work. It was the belief, however, that with proper methods and skilled observers and favorable conditions of sea and weather nearly the same degree of accuracy could be obtained in determining the magnetic declination at sea with such compasses as hitherto has been reached with special standard compasses of the liquid or of the dry form. This.belief has been strengthened

by the results thus far accumulated and compared with those published by other nations. If the dry compass is to be regarded as superior to the liquid compass for scientific work, as some believe, then its possibilities may not yet have been fully determined. The question of prime consideration, of course, is the elimination of the ship's own magnetism, and the problem of doing this completely depends upon the construction of the vessel and her equipment. All of the vessels thus far engaged in the work are steamers, the Blake, Endeavor, Hydrograp!1er, J/:lcA rtlmr, and Pattenon being of wooden construction and the Bache and Gedney of composite construction. The instructions issued to the commanding officers of the ships, for obscrrntions to delcr111i11e the magnetic declination, call for complete swings (by steaming in a circle) of the vessel, on 16 equidistant headings, forward and back, whenever the conditions permitted, observing the magnetic and solar bearing of the ship's head on each course, holding the vessel long enough on each heading to secure good results, and spending, on the average, about two hours in all for both swings. Special attention is paid to the disposition of all articles likely to affect the compass. The constant A depending chiefly, for the cases considered, on the placement of the lubber's line of the compass in the central fore and aft line, is controlled by observations in port or waters where the magnetic declination is known from accurate shore observations, the endeavor being made to select places free of local disturbance. In accordance with the directions, these check observations arc made at ports of departure and of destination, both on the outward and the return trips and elsewhere, if opportunity permits. Xot only has the same ship been swung at the same place at various times and under different conditions, but also various vessels were swung in the same locality with different degrees of compensation of compass. In each case the vessel was swung by steaming in a circle. The results thus derived warrant the statement that when the conditions api)roximate those near port, a value of the magnetic declination can be obtained the absolute error of which need not exceed 5 to 10 minutes of arc. For the results obtained out at sea, using the methods described, it is believed that under favorable conditions an absolute accuracy of about 10 to 15 minutes may be secured. \Vhen time did not permit complete swings over 16 points, 8 were permitted, and the accuracy reached from this number was nearly the same as with the larger number. Some results have been obtained also from observations on and near the course-e. g., on course, one point starboard, two points port, and back again on course. However, the inaccuracy of such values is, in general, too great to warrant their indiyidual publication. \Vhen results in the same locality have been accumulated as deriYed under various conditions and from different vessels, their mean may have sufficient \'alue for utilization. . The general experience has been that it is better oyer the deep waters of the sea, where local irregularities need not be feared, to observe less often, but secure each time a value dependent on a complete swing, with port helm and with starboard helm, on 8 to 16 equidistant beadings, under as favorable conditions regarding sea, weather, and time of day as possible. For securi11g results o.f magneti; dip and intensity o.f magnetic force three vessels have been supplied with a Lloyd-Creak dip circle, known as the L. C. dip circle, and the

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1904.

accompanying gimbal stand, with which outfit dip and intensity observations are secured at sea. The sea work was begun first on the Blake, on a trip from Baltimore to Porto Rico in February, 1903. Observations were made daily by the commanding officer and the writer under varying conditions and trying various methods. During the early part of 1904 similar instruments were mounted on the Bac/1e, working in Atlantic waters, and on the Patterson, operating on the Pacific coast. At the time of writing two additional instruments have been received to be supplied to other vessels of the Survey. So that, although the magnetic work at sea is merely incidental to the other duties of the vessels, all arrangements have been made now to procure a steady l'l.ccumulation of data with all accuracy attainable. under the conditions imposed both in the Atlantic and in the Pacific oceans. Such desultory work can not, however, satisfy the actual demands. It is most gratifying, therefore, that the Carnegie Institution of \Vashington, through its Department of International Research in Terrestrial Magnetism, proposes to. co-operate in securing systematic magnetic surveys of oceanic areas. The following summary includes only the results derived from complete swings of the vessels :

The Lloyd-Creak dip circle replaces the old Fox instrument, used for about seven decades in making dip and intensity observations at sea, and represents a great improvement upon it. Briefly described, the new instrument applies the method of Lloyd's needles for the purpose of determining the absolute dip and the relative total intensity at sea. The improvements were devised by Capt. Ettrick Creak before his recent retirement from the Superintendency of the Compass Department of the British Admiralty, and the expenses of the initial experiments were defrayed by the British Admiralty. Such instruments were used by the recent Antarctic expeditions. Illustration No. 1 shows this instrument· mounted on a tripod for shore observations. The coun"terpoise shown attached· to the base is only used for balancing the instrument when mounted on board ship on the gimbal stand. The illustration also shows a compass attachment, added by this Survey for land work, as described later. The back circle and other parts o( the .Fox circle are in this instrument omitted and replaced by thick ground glass. There is, therefore, only the one graduated vertical circle for reading the inclination of the needle, the circle being graduated to every 10 minutes. At the request of this Survey the recent instruments have the vertical circle numbered every two degrees instead of every five as formerly, counting continuously from zero to 360° instead of from zero to 90° for each quadrant. The microscopes for reading the position of the needle are faced with ivory and contain a single central thread, the microscope being turned until the thread is set on

the point of the needle, whereupon the degrees and minutes (by estimation into tenths of a ten-minute space) are read directly upon the circle. It is not absolutely necessary, however, to set the thread directly on the point of the needle, but instead, the reading ca11 be taken by noting the position of the poii:it directly on the circle ; in the deflection observations of the intensity determinations, however, in order to secure perpendicularity of the two needles to one another, it is essential to set the thread on the point of the suspended needle. The great improvement over the Fox circle consists in the construction of the needles and removal of the upper halves of the jewels in which the pivots of the needle work, so as to permit making observations in all of the positions employed for securing absolute results on land and the ready removal and replacing of the needle. The dip needles ~an, therefore, have their polarities reversed for elimination of error due to eccentricity of center of gravity, just as for land work. A lifter is provided and an ivory scraper, to be used in rubbing or slightly tapping the vertical brass point shown on the top of the instrument (below the compass attachment). With this ivory scraper, sufficient vibration· is imparted to the pivots of the suspended needle to overcome the friction between them and the sides of the jewels, so that the needle is made to drop down to the lowest point. The horizontal circle is so numbered that when the instrument is mounted on the gimbal stand previously placed with its lubber's line in the vertical plane passing through, the central fore-and-aft line, the arrow on the vernier shall be at zero. If, then, the ship is heading to the magnetic north and the circle is set at zero, the plane of suspension of the needle will be in the magnetic meridian. So that from the course, as shown by the standard compass, with deviation corrections applied, if necessary, the instrument can readily be placed with sufficient accuracy in the magnetic meridian without resorting to the magnetic prime vertical method. In the recent instruments constructed, as requested by this Survey, the horizontal circle was graduated continuously from o 0 to 360° in the direction of counting azimuths (S. W. N. E.) instead of the usual quadrantal (0°-90°) graduation. This was done especially to facilitate the determination of the declination on land with the aid of the above-mentioned compass attachment. The brass shield shown at right angles to the microscopes is for the purpose of protecting the deflecting needle from injury to the pivots and changes of temperature during intensity observations. The gimbal stand is solidly constructed of brass, the upper part consisting of two gimbal rings of which the inner one has three radiating grooves for receiving the foot screws of the dip circle; the brass balancing weight is adjustable in height by a screw cut in the rod passing through it, so that the period can be regulated to suit the conditions. These gimbal rings, in the recent stands, move on knife-edges. For readily placing the gimbal stand in the required position on deck, a lubber's line is cut across the outer fixed ring encircling the gimbal rings. When this lubber's line has been placed in the vertical plane passing through the central fore-and-aft line of the ship, the stand is firmly bolted down to the deck. To overcome the ship's vibration somewhat, a solid sheet of rubber about three-fourths inch thick was put under the base of the stand in each case. The stand was further-

more surrounded by a brass railing, not touching the stand, against which the observer could lean while observing. (See illustration No. 2.) For shore observations a special nonmagnetic tripod is provided. As stated, for securing also declination results, a compass attachment has been added with which observations are made, as later described.
GENERAL METHODS OF
OllSERVI~G.

LAND \VORK.

The same general method has been followed as described in the previous publications. Observers regularly and continuously engaged in magnetic work are supplied with a complete magnetic outfit, consisting of theodolite-magnetometer, dip circle, halfsecond pocket chronometer, small accessories, and an observing tent, whereas those who are expected to get magnetic results incidental to other work; e. g., geodetic or astronomic work, are supplied with more or less complete outfits according to circumstances. \Vhere only declination results can be secured under the conditions involved, a compass declinometer is supplied; but to those who can attempt more, a dip circle with compass attachment is furnished, with which compact outfit, knowing the azimuth of some mark from triangulation or other source, the declination, dip, and total intensity (Lloyd's . method) can be obtained with a very fair degree of accuracy. It has been demonstrated that with care and a good instrument, the results derived from this dip-circle combination instrument will not be much below in accuracy those derived from the more complete outfits. In all in.stances scrupulous care is taken to secure standardizations and control of instrumental constants of all outfits as often as possible during the season's work. Comparisons are secured also not only at the magnetic observatories, but likewise in the field, under the actual local conditions-a matter of importance when observations are distributed over as large an area as here concerned.
SEA AND SHORE \VORK.

For the determination of the deviations of the standard compass and the magnetic declination, the ship, as has already been stated fully, is swung forward and back through the complete circle, steadying her on each of 1 6 or 8 equidistant headings. (See previous sections.) The observations made near port yield values of the constant A and an analysis of the vaTious swings furnish the coefficients B, C, D, and E. Knowing A and swinging completely over equidistant headings, the declination will be the mean compass error with the constant correction, A, applied. The magnetic dip and intensity are obtained on board with the Lloyd-Creak dip circle described in a previous section; this instrument, mounted on a gimbal stand, is placed on the upper deck of the vessel at the most suitable spot, and not far from the standard compass. The dip observations can be made with the needles I and 2 provided for this purpose, in the same manner and nearly with the same facility as with the i11struments for land.work. The only difference is that the ivory scraper must be continuously used to

cause needle to settle on proper bearing surface of jewels and a reading, owing to the large arc through which the needle swings on account of the ship's motion, must be quickly estimated (not attempting, of course, to get minutes), and the extremes of the arc must be read and recorded instead of the mean position. If the observations be extended over the same time as on land, 45 to 60 minutes, the errors due to the various motions of the ship are, apparently, effectually eliminated. From the comparath·e observations made by the commanding officer of the Blake (Assistant R. L. Faris) and the writer on the trip to Porto Rico, the conclusion was reached that the relative accuracy attainable is about 51 · The range in the results, the observations having been so arranged that the mean time of observation and position of ship was the same for both observers, rarely exceeded 1o'. 'fhis statement is borne out by subsequent results derived from complete swings and it would appear as though under favorable conditions and in a wooden ship, for which the deviation coefficients can be readily and safely controlled, the absolute accuracy may likewise he of about the same order (5'). This .statement even applies to the dip obtained with needle No. 3 fron1 the deflection observations involved in getting total intensity as described below. Since this needle can not have its polarity reversed, the dip derived from it requires the application of the correction due to eccentricity of center of gravity of needle-a correction which it has been found can be quite well controlled. The relative total intensity is obtained by Lloyd's method, which involves, first, the determination of the angle of dip with a loaded needle (designated No. 4), and second, a determination of the angle through which another needle (No. 3) is deflected by the loaded needle, when the latter is placed at right angles to it in the place provided between the reading microscopes and protected by the brass shield. Let Tif''=total intensity, !=the dip, u,=the angle of deflection, 17=the dip with loaded needle and u=f-17=the angle through which the loaded needle is turned from its normal position by the load, then U7= C v cos u, in which c is a constant determined as frequently as possible by similar observations at stations where l.V is known from standard magnetometer and dip observations. (See Appendix 8, Report for 1881, p. 24.) . As the determination of total intensity by this method is rclatbe, it is necessary to avoid as far as possible any change in the magnetism of the two needles 3 and 4. Their polarities are therefore never reversed, and they are guarded from close proximity to disturbing influences and to the bar magnets when these are used for reversing the polarity of the regular dip needles. Since a complete determination of dip and relative intensity on each of 16 headings of the forward and back swings would consume too much time, the following scheme of observations was provisionally adopted as the result of the experimental work 011 the Blake. This scheme has been found exceedingly satisfactory in all of the subsequent work and no change appears warranted at present. ( 1) Observe deflections alone while swinging ship in one direction, and dip with loaded needle alone while ship is swinging in the reverse direction. Besides the total intensity derivable from the combination of these observations, a value of dip also results from the deflection observations, since the suspended needle is deflected first in one direction and then in the other from its normal position.

ii-cosec 11:-cosec

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904..

( 2) On each heading observations are made in only one position of circle and needle, so as not to require more than 3 to 5 minutes. In the deflections the position for the first four headings will be Circle East, needle face East; for the next four, Circle West, circle face West; for the third four, Circle West, needle face East; and for last four headings, Circle East, needle face West. The position of circle and needle in making observations of dip with loaded needle will be the same as for the corresponding heading in the deflection observations. (3) As the gimbal stand is set so that the zero of the horizontal circle corresponds to the ship's head, the dip circle may be placed in the magnetic meridian with sufficient accuracy by means of the ship's hearl by standard compass, applying the deviation correction if large enough to warrant it. (4) As the motion of the ship will, in general, make it impossible to reduce the swing of the needle to as small an arc as is usual on land, the circle readings for both extremes of a swing are read and recorded in each case. (5) For each position of the circle two readings are taken of each end of the needle. ( 6) The time of beginning and ending of observations for each group of four headings and the corresponding temperature is recorded, also facts relating to weather, sea, etc. The programme outlined above can be carried out in about the same time as requisite for the compass observations which are made simultaneously by an independent observer. The successful determination of declination, dip, and intensity at sea requires, first, that observations should be made with the dip circle at a base station on shore at the beginning and end of the cruise, to determine the relative intensity constant for the particular 'veight used at sea and the correction to the dip as derived from the deflection observations; and second, that the ship be swung at the beginning and end of the cruise (and if possible in the highest and lowest latitude reached) at a place near shore where the declination, dip, and intensity are known with reasonable accuracy from shore observations, in order to determine the deviations of the standard compass and of dip and intensity at the dip circle position. As the compass deviations are, in general, not the same at the dip circle position as indicated by the standard compass, especially if the latter is compensated, it is desirable at the beginning and end of a cruise to steady the ship successively on each of 16 equidistant headings by means of the standard compass and determine the magnetic prime vertical by means of the dip circle. These observations combined with known deviations of the standard compass will give the compass deviations at the dip circle position and complete the data necessary for an analysis of the ship's magnetism. The present indications are that with the method above described, swinging ship completely forward and back, the total intensity has been determined within about 1 part in 300. For s/zore observations t/ze declination is determined (if the ship has no magnetometer) with the compass attachment alluded to above. The general scheme of observing is as follows: The observations are made preferably under a tent, or certainly in a spot sheltered from wind. After the compass has been mounted on the dip circle and the instrument leveled, and adjusted if necessary, shift the weight on the south end of the needle so. that the latter will lie horizontal, and see that the center of the agate rests on the supporting pivot; then clamp the needle and point on the mark through the azimuth sights

with vertical circle right, passing the eye up and down the slit to make sure that the mark has been accurateiy pointed upon. Read the vernier of the horizontal circle and record. Then turn the instrument 180° in azimuth, the vertical circle now being to the left, and again point on the mark and read the horizontal circle. Next, turn the instrument until the needle points approximately magnetic nortl! and south, release the .needle, and, with aid of tangent screw, turn the instrument antil the north encl of the needle exactly cuts the zero of the graduated arc of the compass, using a pocket magnifying lens, and holding the eye directly over the needle to avoid parallax. Before making the fiual setting, disturb the needle slightly with a bit of steel-as for example, a pocket knife or adjusting pin, being careful to remove it to a safe distance afterwards before needle comes to re.st. Then quickly set the south end of the needle before it comes to rest at the zero of its arc and read and record both readings and the time of observation. Next, disturb the needle slightly and repeat the pointings in the reverse order-that is, first south encl and then north end. In a similar manner make four readings with the north encl of the needle pointing 5° east of zero, or the south end 5° west of zero; then four readings with the north encl 5° west of zero or the south end 5° east of zero, and finally, four more with the ends pointing at zero. Record the time of ending, clamp the needle, and again make two pointings on the mark, as at beginning. If the compass box contains no impurity affecting the needle and the pivot is in good condition, the mean of the second and third set of four readings will correspond practically with the mean of the first and last four. When impurities or imperfections were thus detected they were removed. The difference between the readings on the mark and the magnet gives the magnetic azimuth of the mark, and knowing the true azimuth from other sources (triangulation or astronomic observations) the declination is found. A correcti011 must be applied which depends partly on the relative position of the vertical plane of the sights and the vertical plane passing through the opposite zeros of the graduated arcs of the compass box and partly on the relative position of magnetic axis of the needle and a line passing through the ends of the needle. The error due to the first source may be regarded as constant, whereas that due to the latter source is variable, depending upon the fluctuations of the magnetic axis within the blade of the needle. However, repeated tests have shown that 'V'ith a fairly thin, slender, vertical blade and a good initial magnetization of the needle, any variations to be ascribed to fluctuations of magnetic axis are on the order of the error of observation, so that the total correction may be regarded as a constant, pro1·ided proper care is bestowed upon tlze compass. The value of this constant is controlled whenever a station is reached where the absolute declination is known from some reliable source. The experience has been that with proper care the declination can be secured with this simple arrangement, using above method, correct within 2 1 , and that it can certainly be obtained as accurately as with the compass cleclinometer, which has a needle constructed so as to be reversible on the pivot. If desired, and in regions where the magnetic prime vertical method is not sufficiently accurate, this compass attachment can serve also to set the plane of the dip circle in the magnetic meridian for the dip and intensity observations.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1904. GE:\'ERAL ACCURACY OF RESULTS.

The endeavor, in general, is to secure on land declination and clip observations whose absolute error (including everything- in\'olvecl-crror of observation and reduction) shall not exceed 2', and that the horizontal intensity be determined within I part in 1000. The experience of the Coast and Geodetic Sur\'ey has been, that under all of the conditions involved in a campaign of field work co\"ering a large area, including the standardization of instruments and the determination of the reduction errors, this accuracy can not be much reduced. In ohsen·atory work, with special instruments, or when special investigations are made under the best conditions by special observers, there is no difficulty in reducing these limits of error. But in a large organization, where results must be secured from all kinds of observers, under all conditions, and at times under great physical difficulties, and when all the errors are considered before results can be utilized, the degrees of accuracy stated must be regarded as satisfact0ry and sufficient. It happens, of course, that these limits, for one reason or another, are occasionally exceeded, and there may be a few isolated cases in which the errors are two to three times the amounts given. Some preliminary statements regarding the accuracy reached in the determinations of the magnetic elements at sea have been made in the previous sections.
CO:\IPARISON 01·' IXSTRUl\IEXTS.

The absolute instruments at the Cheltenham Observatory, comprising declinometer, magnetometer, earth inductor, and theodolite, have been adopted as the standard instruments to which all other instruments are referred. During the year special observations were made at Cheltenham to standardize the three Lloyd-Creak clip circles, :N" os. 28, 32, and 33, for use on shipboard. Other instruments were standardized as circumstances required, and numerous comparisons were obtained as the result of the occupation of the same station by different observers with different instruments. . These observations show that few changes are required in the instrumental constants adopted last year. The various dip circles used and the corrections which ha\·e been applied to the results by each a.re given in the following table. The figures after the decimal point indicate the particular needles to which the correction applies; thus 15.24 means clip circle 15, needles 2 and 4.

Index corrections ha\'e been applied to declination results obtained with compass dedinometer or compass needle. Numerous comparisons with other magnetometers during the past four years show that declination results with magnetometer Ko. 19 are systematically in error by about 1 1 · 5. Declinations determined with that instrument have therefore been corrected by 1 1 .5, decreasing west declinations and increasing east declinations. The same correction should be applied to results with magnetometer No. 19, published in Appendix 5, Report for 1903.
REDUCTION OF THE OBSERVATIONS.

(a) Referring the magnetic declination results to the mean of the particular month in which the observations occur, by the aid of the continuous magnetic observations at the magnetic observatories nearest to the station. \Vhere there is much difference in magnetic latitude, allowance is made in accordance with the general law of the increase of the diurnal variation with increasing dip and decreasing horizontal intensity. (b) Applying, for the present, to the dip and intensity results merely the corrections necessary for referring them to the adopted standard instruments. In accordance with the methods of observation the reduction-corrections for dip and intensity are usually of the order of the error of observation. When the observer has reason to suppose that a magnetic storm was prevailing at the time of his observations, as judged either at the time or from a careful scrutiny of the work before leaving the station, his directions require the repetition of the work. Experience shows that the laws of change both of the periodic and a-periodic magnetic fluctuations over as large an area as the one under consideration, must be much better known than at present before it will be safe to apply reduction-corrections to observations made at considerable distance from a magnetic observatory. It was deemed best, therefore, to defer these corrections, since they are in general of the same order as the error of observation; they are, moreover, considerably smaller than the station errors due to irregularity of distribution of the Earth's magnetism. It is very much questioned whether as far as investigations of distribution of magnetic elements are concerned, it will really pay to spend the time necessary to determine the small reduction-corrections as it is rather the multiplication of stations that is desired than the highest refinement. For certain special investigations as, e. g., the secular variation, it is necessary to apply all reduction-corrections known with certainty. The office work involved in the reduction and revision of results and preparation for publication was intrusted principally to Messrs. D. L. Hazard and C. J. Houston, Computers, of whose efficiency and faithfulness the writer takes pleasure in making acknowledgment.
ARRANGE:\IENT OF THE TABLES.
LAND OBSERVATIONS.

The values of declination, dip, and horizontal intensity presented in Table I are arranged by States alphabetically, the results for each State being given in the order of increasing latitudes. The latitudes and longitudes are in most cases the result of solar observations made with the small theodolite which forms a part of the magnetometer. In default of observations the geographic position was scaled from the best available map, either the United States Geological Survey topographic sheets, a Post Route map, or a Rand & McNally State map. In such cases only the nearest whole minute of latitude and longitude is given. The horizontal intensity is expressed in terms of the one hundred thousandth part of a C. G. S. unit of intensity of magnetic force. The unit used represents the limit of accuracy attainable in the determination of the absolute horizontal intensity with the most refined instruments. There appears no hope that this accuracy, in absolute measure, will ever be exceeded. This unit is therefore a very practical and convenient one, and the late Professor Eschenhagen about eight or ten years ago suggested that the Greek gamma (y) be used as the symbol to

COAST AND GEODh"TIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS.
Magnetic observers are instructed to mark every station in as permanent a manner as pos.<>ible, either with a stone or a post of some durable wood, so that it may be available for future occupation. They are also required to furnish a detailed description, so that the station may be located even if the marking should he destroyed, and to determine the true bearing of two or three prominent objects in addition to the one used as a reference mark in the azimuth and declination observations. The information is given in abridged form on the following pages for each of the stations occupied during the year. Further details can usually be obtained on application to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The usual method of marking a station is by a stone post about 3 feet long and 6 or 8 inches square set so as to project an inch or two abo,·e ground and lettered on top .U. S. C. & G. S., with a drill hole in the center to mark the exact point. Whenever the local authorities desired and were willing to bear the expense, a second stone was set to denote the true meridian. The descriptions of stations are arranged alphabetically by States and by name of station.

Clarence Town, Clarence Harbor, Long .Island. The station 1s m the Government Residency, and is marked by a ¥-inch copper bolt, set in bed rock, between the portico of the residence and the flagstaff. It is about 40 feet from the flagstaff and about 6o feet from the portico of the residence. The mark used was the rod on top of the light staff on Gaspin Point. The true azimuth of this mark was found to be 28° 441 .4 east of true north. Cockburn Town, Waitings .lsland.-The station is on the premises of the government residence and hence on Crown land. It is about 40 feet east-southeast from the southeast corner of the residence and is marked by a pint bottle buried in the ground to the depth of 3 or 4 inches.

The exact location of the station occupied is marked by means of 5 copper nails driven into the bed rock on the premises, about 75 feet west-northwest from the northwest corner of the building. These nails are covered by means of a slab about 1 foot square, with the inscription "Bahama Expedition, 1903." The loc11tion of the station is further fixed by sighting upon three points, Hog Island Light-house to the north, the obelisk to the west, and the northwest edge of the priory building, about 75 feet to the east-southeast. The mark used was the tip of the obelisk at Fort Charlotte. Its true azimuth was found to be 86°47'.4 west of true north. Nassau, PublicSquare.-The station is at the southern extremity of the meridian line established by the surveyor-general, Mr. Miller, from north star observations. This point is marked by a bolt in a stone slab a few feet to the north of the abandoned well between the library building and the customhouse.

TELEGRAPHIC LONGITUDES: THE PACIFIC ARCS FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO MANILA, r903-4, COMPLETING THE CIRCUIT OF THE EARTH.
By EDWIN SMITH,

Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Sttrvey.

GENERAL STATEMENT.

·

Preparations for the determination of the difference of longitude by telegraphic methods between San Francisco and Manila begal'i in December, 1902, in anticipation of the completion of the trans-Pacific cable, which was announced for the year 1903, and on the 20th of that month the writer began to prepare plans for the work. In February a visit was made to the New York office of the Commercial Pacific Cable Company for the purpose of obtaining information in regard to the best method of recording time signals automatically. A method had been successfully used by the Canadian and English observers in determining the difference of longitude between Greenwich, England, and Montreal, Canada, in 1892, but no description of this method was available. Fortunately, the superintendent of the cable station at Canso, Nova Scotia, Mr. S.S. Dickerson, was in New York, and could describe the apparatus. Based upon the information thus obtained, a simple apparatus for recording automatically time signals sent over cables was designed and constructed at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, wpich proved entirely successful in use in the field. Mr. G. G. Ward, vice-president and general nianager of the Commercial Pacific 1 Cable Company, generously granted the privilege of using the cables of his. company in the exchange of time signals and in making the necessary communications between the observers during the progress of the work without charge, and issued instructions to the superintendents of the cable stations at San Francisco, Cal., Honolulu, Hawaii, Midway Island, Guam Island, and Manila, P. I., to do all in their power ~o facilitate the progress of the work. The writer arrived in San Francisco on March 17, 1903, fully equipped for the work, and was joined the same day by Assistant Fremont Morse, who was to co-operate in the longitude determinations. The following plan of operations was adopted: ( 1) Testing of apparatus and special observations for relative personal equation at San Francisco. ( 2) Determination of difference of longitude on five nights with Smith at Honolulu and Morse at San Francisco. ·

(3) The same number of determinations with Morse at Honolulu and Smith at Sau Francisco. (4) Special observations for relative personal equation at San Francisco. (5) To take up the other stations when the cables should become available. The recording apparatus was tested and found to be more satisfactory than was anticipated. Observations for personal equation were made in San Francisco, and on April 14 the observers were ready for observations at Sau Francisco and Honolulu. Several days of unfavorable: weather followed, but the necessary, observations were obtained April 20, 22, 26, 27, a1id 29. Mr. Morse then went to Honolulu and observations for personal equation were made, before the writer left for San Francisco, at which place be arrived on May 19. Unfavorable weather again prevented observations until June 2, when observations were made, and also on June 4, 6, 1 l, r 2, and r 3, thus completing the work between San Francisco and Honolulu, the first step in the transPacific longitude work. In May it became known that the cables between Honolulu and Manila would be completed by the Fourth of July, and it was decided to advance the work as rapidly as possible. There was 110 regular means of transportation to and from Midway, and it was therefore desirable to leave this station out of the scheme if possible. There seemed to be a possibility of getting signals directly between Honolulu and' Guam with the cables joined at Midway, and, the cable company having consented to make the attempt. the writer went to Guam by the first available means of transportation. In accordance with the plan adopted Mr. Morse remained at Honolulu for the purpose of going to Manila upon the completion of the work between Honolulu a1~d Guam. It was intended that the writer should join him at Manila and again make observations for relative personal equation. It will later be seen that this excellent scheme unfortunately could not be carried out. The·writer sailed from San Francisco on the U.S. S. ::,olace June 21 and arrived at Honolulu ou the 27th, where he was able to again 1.:onfer with Mr. Morse, and observations for personal equation were made. The Solace sailed from Honlulu July 1 and I reached Guam Island July 14. Here the writer met with many unexP.,ected difficulties, but with the very generous and kind assistance of the superintendent of the cable station they were overcome. The governor of the 'island, Commander W. E. Sewell, U. S. Navy, offered any assistance he could give, and some very necessary supplies were obtained from the naval station. The cables were not ready for signals on July i4, but by the time the observatory and instruments were ready, July 27, the cables were at the service of the longitude parties. The tests made 011 that day failed to give satisfactory signals, and it became evident that no satisfactory signals between Honolulu and Guam with the cables joined at Midway could be obtained, except possibly by the use of a voltage so great that the cables would be endangered. It was quite out of reason to ask the cable company to take, such a risk and the attempt to eliminate Midway as a longitude station was abandoned. The Superintendent of the Survey being informed of these conditions, Mr. Morse proceeded to Manila, arriving there on August 31. The difference of longitude between Guam and Manila was determined on nights of September 8, 12, 14, 15, and r6.

There is no means of transportation from Manila to Guam except by the na\'.y vessels. The U. S.S. Solace makes two trips a year, and occasionally some other veS5el stops there on the voyage to the United States. The army transports stop at Guam on the voyage from the United States to Manila, but not on the return voyage. So, whereas it is quite easy to get from Guam to Manila, it is very difficult to get from Manila to Guam. The exchange of observers had, therefore, to be given up. It was learned that the U. S. S. Iroquois would sail from Honolulu for Midway about October 16, and in order to reach Honolulu by that date Mr. Morse would have to take the steamer from Hongkong Septetnber 26, and that necessitated his ieaving Manila 011 September' 19, and so no further deterrt1i11ation of the difference of longitude hetween Guam and Manila could be made. Mr .. Morse reached Honolulu Odober 15,.and found the trip of the U. S. S. Iroquois had been given up. While Mr. Morse was seeking other means of transportation, there occurred a wreck on the reef at Midway, which led to the Iroquois making the trip and taking Mr. Morse and outfit there. He reached Midway on November 3. The difficulties at Midway were eyen greater than at Guam, as Mr. Morse was entirely dependent upon the cable staff for assistance and their force was limited. Their. generous assistance and great interest were ~nost important in advancing the work. Longitude determinations between Midway and Guam were made on nights of November 16-17, 17-18, 18-19, 22-23, .23-24, 26-27; December 1-2, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6. It now became the question how the writer could most quickly reach Honolulu. An army tr~nsport lV.~s due at Guam December 22, and would reach Manila December 28, just too late to get to Hongkong in time to take the steamer due to sail January 2. The next st~atner would sail January 9 and reach Honolulu January 30. The cable company'.s ship Scotia was expected at Guam January 4, and would probably reach Ho.nolulµ about January 23. Transportation on the Scotia was secured, and word came ft:<>m.Mf.: Ward. that she would reach Guam about January IO. This made it desirable ~<=>; t~~~~ i,~i:~ ~rmy transport Logan to Manila, but when sht: arrived it was fotmd impracticable. On January 8 word came from Mr. Ward that the Scotia was still further delayed, an.d as t:qe U. S. S. Solace was due on January 10 it was decided to risk no further. delays. The So/are sailed on the 10th and reached Manila January 15. A steam~r sailed the next day for Hongkong, where the writer caught a Pacific Mail stc:;a1µer and arrived at Honolulu February 8. It turned out that the Hongkong Maiu, \vhich sailed from Howgkong January 9, was held up at Yokohama in anticipation of the war, At" this season the weather was very unfavorable at both Honolulu and Midway, ~ut especjally,rat the fonner place. Detenninat1ons of the difference of longitude l·,, .:.J. . . bet'1'8~Rct1m~e places was made on nights of February 22, 25; March 2, 8, 9, 10, 19, and_, 24, .. a,~il. ~urther attempts were made up to April 8, but the very cloudy weather prevented stic<;:11ss. The failure of the army transport Buford to land provisions at Midway March 28 led to a trip of the U. S. S. Iroquois to the island, and Mr. Morse returned on her to Honolulu, where he arrived April 16. · Observations for relative personal equation were made before the observers sailed for San Francisco, on April 18 and 21, the only available nights. They reached San l;"randsco May 2, and made further observations for personal equation on May 6, 7, 8,

and 9. This closed the field work for the determination of the difference of longitude between San Francisco and Manila. It will at once be understood that the chief cause of delay in the prosecution of this work was the difficulty of transportation to and from the islands of Midway and Guam. Mr. Morse was at Midway five months and seven days, while the writer was at Guam six months less four days. Acknowledgment is made to the cable company and to Mr. G. G. Ward, its vice-president, for the many facilities and courtesies extended to the observers. without which the work would have been impracticable; and also of the assistance rendered by the cable staffs at the several stations, and especially in the cases of t~1e superintendents, Mr. H. F. Harrington at San Francisco, Mr. J. D. Gaines at Honolulu, Mr. B. W. Colley at Midway, Mr. D. Coath at Guam, and Mr. E. Desnouee at Manila.
DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS.
SAN FRANCISCO S'l'ATION.

The present longitude station in San Francisco is on Drill Plain Knoll, in the Presidio Military Reservation. It is about 130 meters southwest of the terminus of the Union street-car line. The observatory is T-shaped, and contains three roo~s. The observing room is in the stem of the T and to the east of the other two. It contains three piers of brick, capped with massive sandstones. A clock is mounted on the west pier. Upon the middle pier was mounted transit No. 3, and this pier is the longitude station. The east pier was built for the zenith telescope. This obsetvatory was built in 1896, under the direction of Assistant A. F. Rodgers, who was in charge of the suboffice at San Francisco. The same year the difference of longitude between this station and the old station at Lafayette Park was determined by Assistants Fremont Morse and 0. B. ·French on ten nights, the observers exchanging stations after the first five nights. The results of this determination will be found on pages 820 and 826 of Special Publication No. 4, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1900, "The Transcontinental Triangulation.'' Transit No. 19 could not be conveniently mounted on the middle pier, and was therefore mounted on the east pier, which is 1.47 meters, or o".063, or o·.004, east of the _111iddle pier or longitude station. This station is about 4 miles from the office of the Cgmmercial Pacific Cable Company, and as signals could not be sent on the cable from thecbservatory, a break-circuit chronometer was placed at the cable office, and by a land-line connection this chronometer was compared with the break-circuit chronometer at the observatory hoth before and after the signals were exchanged between San Francisco and Honolulu. A land line already existed between Presidio and the Feland Building under the control of the Army Signal Corps, and this was connected with the obserYatory by direction of Colonel Allen, the officer in charge. The Postal Telegraph Company very kindly furnished the land connection between the cable office and the Feland Building. The Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company also furnished telephone connection between the observatory and cable office. The latitude of this station was determined in 1896 by Assistant 0. B. French, and js 37° 47' 48 11 .22±0" .05 N. (See p. 724, Special Publication No. 4, U. S. C. & G. Sun·ey 1900, "The Transcontinental Triangulation.")

HONOLULU STATION.

All former observation stations at Honolulu were unavailable, and a new one was selected. A site at the navy station was :finally chosen and pennission to occupy it was granted by Lieut. Commander Hugh Rodman, the acting commandant. This is probably the best location within the limits of Honolulu. It is on Government property, and will be preseryed. An excavation was made to the solid coral rock, upon which was built the concrete pier 14 by 26 inches, extending 3 feet above the surface of the ground. This pier is in the center of a wooden observatory 8 by 12 feet. The sides of the building are only 6 feet ·high and the ridge of the roof is but 2 Yz feet higher, so the distance between the objective of the transit and the outside air is about as short as it is practicable to have it. The opening in the roof is 14 inches wide. North of the center of this pier I 1. 27 feet was placed a mark consisting of an iron pipe 2.5 feet long set in cement, with a copper bolt marking the center. This mark was set by the Territorial Survey, under the direction of Mr. W. E. Wall, and coni1ected with the main triangulation of the island. The latitude of. the longitude station was thus found to be21° 18' 23".7 north.
0

The station is about one-half mile from the cable office, and was connected with it by a land line and telephone line in the same manner as at San Francisco. The land line was put up by the Territorial government, and the telephone was furnished by the Mutual Telephone Company of Honolulu.
GUAM ISLAND.

This s(ation is on the Orote feninsula near the north limits of the grounds of the Commercial Pacific Cable Company station. The pier and observatory are similar to those at Honolulu. The pier is built upon the solid coral rock near the edge of the bluff, about 330 feet nearly northwest of the temporary office of the cable company. It is about 80 feet above sea level. It was connected with the cable office by a loop of No. 12 insulated copper wire. The record at the cable office was made by the chronometer at the observatory. A room was built on the west end of the observatory for the accommodation of the observer. This station was connected by a small triangulation with the Navy Survey of the island and its latitude thus determined from the navy observations made at Fort Santa Cruz in 1899. The latitude of the longitude station is13° 26' 22".27 north.
MANILA STATION.

The Coast and Geodetic Survey astronomic station at Manila was established in under the direction of Assistant G. R. Putnam. By permission of the military authorities the station was located in the walled city of Manila in the block occupied by the foundation of a projected Government building (Spanish) opposite the pla:ia in front of the principal public building, commonly called the ''Palace.'' In a quadrangle formed by the foundation wall and open toward the plaza a frame observatory building

10 by 15 feet was erected. Two massive granite blocks were set for the instrument · piers, their centers being in an east and west line and 5.5 feet apart. These pierq are 19 by 24 inches and were 32 inches in the ground and 28 inches above the ground. The east pier is the longitude station. By triangulation this station was connected with the center of the cathedral dome, which is the point of reference for astronomic work at Manila. The latitude of the astronomic station as observed by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1901 is14° 35' 31".68 north. Cathedral dome is east of the astronomic station l00.67 meters, or 311 .36 (o".224), and south 46.98 meters, or r" .53. This station is about r ~ miles distant from the ' cable office and was connected with it by both land telegraph line and telephone, as at San Francisco and Honolulu, for which Mr; Morse states that he was indebted to Major Glassford, Chief Signal Officer, U. S. Army.

ISLAND.

The station is located on a prominent sand dune about 15 feet above high water and about 240 feet northeast frpm the temporary office of the Commercial Pacific Cable Company. It is marked by a bottle about 3 feet below the surfa.ce of the ground. The pier and observatory are similar to those at Honolulu, a room being added to the west end for the accommodation of the observer. The station was connected with the cable office by a loop of No. 12 insulated copper wire, as at Guam. The latitude of the astronomical station at Midway, as determined by Mr. Morse with a sextant and artificial horizon, is28° 12' 52".1 north.
THE AUTOMATIC RECORD OF CABLE SIGNALS.

The five stations of the Commercial Pacific Cable Company arc fitted out with the same character of instruments. The Muirhead siphon recorders are exclusively used and a descripton of them can be found in ''Submarine Telegraphs,'' by Charles Bright. The record is made upon a slip of paper by a siphon pen. The slip is made to move by an electric motor at the rate of about 2 centimeters per second. The siphon pen is a very delicate glass tube which is attached to a bit of metal about r centimeter square fastened to a horizontal thread held on a horizontal frame in front of the magnet and coil of the receiver. By two threads the bit of metal is attached to the coil of the receiver in such a manner that the turning of the coil by the cable current gives the lower end of the siphon pen a motion parallel to the plane of the paper and at right angles to the direction of motion of the paper. The electric current which is u~ed on the cable is so weak that this siphon pen would not be moved by it ~f the pen were in contact with the paper, and it is therefore kept in constant vibration at right angles to the plane of the paper. In order that the paper and pen may have. the proper relative positions the rollers over which the paper passes are attached to a stand capable of a vertical and two horizontal adjustments. It was necessary that all signals should be received through this instrument and recorded on the slip of paper at the cable office. The end of the cables are brought into the office and no land-line attachment whatever

is allowed. The problem was to refer the record of a signal received on this slip to the time as recorded by a break-circllit chronometer, and it was solved in the following very simple manner: A magnet as nearly as practicable like the magnets of the chronographs was provided and to the armature was fastened a sr'n all horizontal arm of aluminum. This arm carried a siphon pen exactly like the one on the cable receiver. A stand was provided for this mag~ethaving a vertical and two horizontal adjustments so that it could be placed in front of th e cable receiver and be adjusted to record on the slip alongside of the ·c able pen, taking ink from the same well. This is called the chronometer cable recorder. The chronometer and local battery were in circuit with tl1i s

magnet. The record of the chronometer was made on the s lip by the pen attached to this magnet, and that of any sig nal corning over the cable by the cable pen parallel to it. The record of the cable pen could 'be brought verticall y down to the record of the chronometer pen and read with the ordinary scale: On account of the impracticability of always adjusting the pens exactly opposite each oth er the cable sig nal has a correction the determination of which will presently be expla ined. This chronometer record is made on 't he slip in e4actly the same manner that it is made on a chronograph. The signals were sent by a key such as is used in correspondence over the cable. In fact, the two keys used were obtain ed throug h Mr. Ward from the cable company. They are double keys, by which a positive or negative current can be sent to the cable.

APPENDIX NO. 4.

An attachment to these keys was made at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office by which the circuit through the chronometer recorder would be broken at the instant the current was put on the cable and thus record tµe chronometer time of the 'signal sent. \Vhen sendin g sig nals the local cable receiver was generally disconnected but by so arranging a shunt that a small portion of the sending current would pa s throug h the coil of the local r eceiver a sharp record was also made by the pen of the cable receiver, and thus th e relation of the two siphon pens to each other was obtained from the signals u sed in the longitude work. This was clone in all the work except between San Francisco and H onolulu. This cable is duplexed-that is, it is so connected that messages can be sent in both directions at the same tim e.

must be so perfect to accomplish this that the equality of the transmission times of sig na ls must be more certain than in any other ca ·e. In thi s particular longitude the balance of the cables wa slightly disturbed, both 'before and after exch anging sig nals, in order to send special sig nals to get the demble local record to determine the relation of the pens. At th e st ations San Francisco, Honolulu , and Manila the observatories \\'ere so far from the cable stations that the chronometer recorder at the cable office co uld not be placed in circuit with th e chronometer at the observatory.

These were closed circuits, containing at each end a 50-ohm Morse relay and a Morse key and necessary battery. :r'he chronometers were compared just befor~ and just after the exchange of cable signals, and the method of the comparisons. was the same as in a determination of longitude over any land line. Between 20 and 30 signals were sent in each direction, those sent from or received at the cable office being recorded on the cable slip by the siphon pen of the chronometer recorder and those sent from or received at the observatory on the chronograph. At stations Guam Island and Midway Island the observatories were near enough to the cable office to admit of the chronometer recorder at the cable offices being placed in the observing circuit with the magnet of the chronograph, and so the cable signals

were recorded by the same chronometer used in making the time observations. The three sketches show the arrangement of circuits as above stated. The plan for exchanging signals was as follows between San Francisco and Honolulu: ( 1) The corrections to the cable pens were determined at each station by about 20 signals. ( 2) Chronometers at observatories and cable offices were compare~ by about 20 signals in each direction. (3) San Francisco sent 40 signals to Honolulu. (4) Honolulu sent 80 signals to San Francisco.

It also appears that there might be personal equation between the ( observers in readin'g these signals, but there is. evidently no I such equation between the observers in this work. This has i been settled at the office, where the writer has reread many of I the signals read by Mr. Morse without developing any personal equation. So far as the exchange of signals is concerned, the errors that affect the several differences of longitude determined over the Pacific cables must be considered to be about ! the same as those found to affect the differences of longitude determined over the best of land lines whe.re no repeaters are in circuit. The signals were made by a negative current to cable and then a positive current as soon as possible, and in the next signal the positive current was sent first; and so on. The wave is above the o line for a positive current and below the o line for a negative current. The very first deviation of the signal from the o line is taken for tbe time of the signal received.

( 6) Chronometers at observatories and cable offices were compared by aboµt 20 signals in each direction. ( 7) The corrections to the cable pens were determined at each station by about 20 signals. It. was found that so many signals were unnecessary, apd consequently between the other stations only half the number of cable signals were exchanged. After the San Francisco-Honolulu work the corrections to the cable pens were determined from the regular cable signals sent, as previously stated, and no chronometer comparisons were needed at . Guam and Midway. The eastern station always sent 20 sig~ ·o nals, then the western station sent 40 signals, and again the <l E eastern sent 20. This plan served to eliminate the effect of rate of the chronometers and to determine the transmission times of the cable signals. In the comparison of the chronometers there seems tO have been no appreciable transmission time over the short land lines. The transmission time of the cable signals on the several nights in each determination of difference of longitude is more uniform than that derived from previous longitude determinations over cables, and this is undoubtedly due to recording the signals automatically and to the accuracy with whfoh they can be read ..

the lower line is the time of the signal sent, and the difference between this time and that of the corresponding part of the record on the upper line is the correction to be applied to the signals received. The signals were read with the diagonal scale here illustrated. The reading of the signals sent and recorded on the lower line needs 110 explanation. In reading the signals received on th!! upper line the scale was placed so that 2 seconds on lower line were included between the extreme lines of scale, the horizontal line of scale being parallel to the record line, and was then moved horizontally till the middle line of the scale was on the beginning of the signal, and the fraction of a second between this . middle line of scale and the adjacent second's mark to the left was read. The accuracy

with which these signals were read has already been mentioned. No difference was found between the positive and negative records, and the two kinds of signals were sent . to insure a more perfect discharge of the cable and to guard against the possibility of any difference between them. The following information concerning the four cables between San Francisco and Manila was very kindly furnished by Mr. G. G.

INSTRUMENTAL OUTFIT.

Transit No. rS was used at Honolulu and .Ko. 19 was used at San Francisco by both observers in the work at these stations. During the rest of the work No. 18 was used by Mr. ::VIorse at Manila and Midway and No. 19 by Mr. Smith at Guam and Honolulu. These two instruments were made at the Office of the Survey in i887-88, and a detailed description of them can be found in Appendix' 9, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1889. They are as nearly alike as it was practicable to make them. The focal length of the telescopes is 94 centimeters (37 inches); the aperture of the objective is 7.6 centimeters (3 inches). The diagonal eyepiece is of the Airy fonn and gives a magnifying power of 100 diameters. The diaphragms are ruled as follows:

Lines r to r r were used in all. the time observations. The short intervals are about 2.5 equatorial seconds and the long intervals 5 equatorial seconds. The divisions on the stride levels are 2 millimeters long and !lave a value of r".674 for No. 18 and of 1".850 for No. 19. The correction for inequality of pivots is -o·.038 band west for No. 18 and o".ooo for No. 19. Near one end of the axis is a bright band, and the position of the axis is designated by this band. Chronographs Nos. 784 and 785 were made by Fauth & Co., of Washington, D. C. The former was used in connection with transit No. 18 and the latter with transit No. 19. Each party was furnished with three chronometers, one for the cable office when necessary, one for an observing chronometer, and one for general use. Four of these chronometers were break-circuit, made by T. S. & J. D. Negus, of New York; one, a break-circuit, made by Frodsham, of London; and the other, not a break-circuit, was made by Parkinson & Frodsham, London. All kept sidereal time. They all had comparatively small rates at the beginning of the work, but their rates gradually increased, though they were uniform at each station. At Honolulu the Frodsham chronometer had to be used for observing, as it was the only one available at the time. It is one of

the first break-circuit chronometers made for the Survey, about 1869. The breakcircuit apparatus gave trouble, and it finally had to be replaced by one of the Negus chronometers.
PERSONAL EQGATION.

It was known in the beginning th~t the difficulty of eliminating the effect of person·a1 equation in this work would be the greatest source of error. German observers had settled the fact that the registering micrometer attached to their transits practically eliminated personal equation, and the attachment of such micrometers to the instruments of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was considered. It was found that this would be impracticable in time for this work, and that the instruments on hand would have to be used. The observers could exchange stations between San Francisco and Honolulu, but only by such a sea voyage as might be expected to affect personal equation, and it was not probable such an exchange could take place between the other stations. It was therefore decided, in addition to the exchange of observers between San Francisco and Honolulu, that observations to determine personal equation should be made at the beginning and end of the work and at such other times as possible. It was also intended to so place the observers at the several stations that the personal equation would be eliminated between the extreme stations as well as possible. The observations were made with each instrument by one observer noting the transit of a star o\·er the lines A, 1, 2, 3, 4, and the other observer over lines 8, 9, 10, II, B. Oi1 the next star the order of observers was reversed, and so on. About 20 stars were observed on each of ten nights. The results of all determinations of personal equation are given below. From the exchange of observers in the determination of the difference of longitude between San Francisco and Honolulu the result is:

April 20-29 and June 2-I3, S. - M. = +o".062±0.008.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

This personal equation is applied to the differences of longitude between HonoluluMidway, Midway-Guam, and Guam-Manil~. The difference of longitude between San Francisco and Honolulu is corrected by the personal equation determined from the exchange of observers only. The range of these re~ults is no greater than should be expected from the computed. probable errors, and may therefore be due to errors of · observation rather than to variation of personal equation. The observers were so placed that personal equation is eliminated in the final longitude of Guam and enters only once in the final longitudes of Midway and Manila, so it does not seem that these longitudes can be seriously in error on account of personal equation.
DETERMINATION OF THE INSTRUMENTAL CONSTANTS AND CHRONOMETER CORRECTIONS.

The difference of longitqde between the stations was so great that the same stars could not be observed at both stations without depending upon the rate of the chronometers for a length of time that V\'Ould probably introduce an error greater than any that would arise from errors of the right ascensions. Each observer, therefore, selected his own lists of stars from the star list given in the Berl.iner Astronomisches Jahrbuch and supplemented from the American Ephemeris when necessary. A time determination was made at each station before and again after the exchange 'of cable signals. As far as·the weather would permit, each determination depends upon a group of four stars near the zenith and one star about 60° north of the zenith, band east, and a similar group, band west. The level constant was determined four times for each group with the stride level. The.collimation and azimuth constants were determined from the time observations. The chronometer times of transit of the stars over the mean of the 11 lines were corrected for aberration, level, and rate, and then each star gave au equation.

L1 T= ( a-t )-Aa-Cc The mean of the four zenith star equations was taken, or, in case the far north star was lost, the mean of the equations for the north and for the south stars. For each set of time the four following equations were obtained, in which the' indicates the equations of the north star or stars.
East West

L1T=(a'-t')-_A'ae -C'c LlT=(a-t)-Aae-Cc L1T=(a'-t')-A'aw-C'c LlT=(a - t )-A aw-Cc

(1) (2) (3) (4)

By subtracting 1-2, 2-4, and 3-4 the middle one of the three new equations contains both ae and aw. These equations may be directly solved, but when the coefficients . of ae and aw are small, which is generally the case, a very close approximation to the true value of c is at once obtained from the middle equation. With this value of c, the values of ae and aw are obtained from the other two equations, and if the values of L1 T obtained from the east and west groups do not agree a correction is found for c and new values for ae and aw. If in the equations three decimals are used the values of ..1 T obtained from the east and west groups will now agree within o".002. This method of reduction of time observations by Mayer's formula was used by the writer in 1872, and was adopted for the field reduction in the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878. Practically

nothing is gained by an elaborate least-square reduction, and this method was used in the final reductions of this work. (Seep. 285, Appendix 7, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1898, for an example of this niethod.) A first computation of all the obsen'ations was made in the field by the observers, and a revision or recomputation, where necessary, was made at the Office by the writer, except in the case of the personal equation, which was recomputed in the Computing Division under direction of Assistant J. F. Hayford. On the following pages are given the results of the cable signals, and of the time determinations and the resulting difference of longitude for each night, the four pieces of work being given in chronological order.

The mean probable error for a single star is as follows: Transit Transit Transit Transit No. No. No. No. 19 at San Francisco, 19 at San Francisco, 18 at Honolulu, 18 at Honolulu, Morse, Smith, Smith, Morse, ±o".045. ±o".036. ±o".023. ±o".034.

The weights given to the following results for difference of longitude are the means of two weights. One is computed from the number of stars observed at both stations by the formulap 2 a.b =;z· a+b where n is 20 and a and b the number of stars observed at the eastern and western stations on a night. The other is computed from the mean of the probable errors of the ~hronometer corrections at both stations.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904-

PREVIOUS DETERMINATIONS OF LONGITUDE.

Jl:fanila.

In 1881-82 officers of the United States Navy determined a number of differences of longitude between Vladivostok and Madras, including Manila. The results can be found in a publication of the Hydrographic Office of the United States Navy, No. 65b, "Telegraphic Determination of Longitude in the East Indies, China, and Japan,
1891--g2."

The observers were Lieut. Commanders F. M. Green and C. H. Davis and Lieut. J. A. Norris. No personal equation was applied to the differences of longitude, and on page 18 of the publication it is stated:
By means of the repeated use of the personal-equation machine of Professor Eastman at the Naval Observatory it was found that the habitual errors of the observers engaged in this measurement had all the same sign; that is, they habitually observed the transit of a star a few hundredths of a second after its occurrence, but their respective differences were so small that it seemed evident that to introdu.:e results so minute as corrections would not increase the trustworthiness of the result. In order to avoid as far as practicable the errors arising from difference of personal habit in ~bserving, it was sought to place each observer, in making the long chain of measurements, alternately east and west of the other.

In the results taken from the publication and given below it will be seen that the differeru:e of longitude, Vladivostok-Manila, remains uncorrected for the personal equation (N.-G.), and the difference of longitude, Manila-Madras, remains uncorrected for twiee the personal equation (N.-G.).

In "Telegraphic Determinations of the Difference of Longitude," by Norman Pogson, Madras, 1884, and in the Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 2486, of 1883, are given accounts of a determination of the difference ot longitude between Singapore and Madras in 1871 by Doctor Oudemans and Mr. Pogson. No personal equation was determined, and Doc;tor Oudemans has himself accepted the result of the United States Navy observers. This detennination is therefore not used in this discussion. The above results must necessarily be used at present to connect Vladivostok and Madras with Manila. The longitude of Madras has been determined by five independent series of observations, and a resume of all of them is given by Captain Burrard in Appendix No. 2, Vol. XVII, of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. They are as follows:
/1. m. s. s. Series A 5 20 59.750 ±o. 155 1874-5 and 1881-2 B S 20 59.010 ±0.163 1874 c 5 20 59. 137 ±0.022 1876, 1881, 1892-4-5 D 5 20 59.223 ±0.127 1874-77 E s 20 59.421 ±o. 123 1874-77

Series A is by the way of Moscow and Vladivostok, and thence by the w'ork of the United States Navy officers. As this series is used for the direct detennination of the longitude of Manila, it will not here be considered in determining the longitude of
M~u.

,
The fol-

Series B is by way of Berlin, Teheran, Isfahan, Karachi, and Madras. lowing is taken from the appendix above mentioned:

An account, written by General Addison,. of series B is to be found in Vol. XXXVIII of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and the resulting longitude of Madras is there 10277-04--20

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904· given as 5b 2om 59'.65 .. But in Die Venus-Durchgange 1874 and 1882, published at Berlin in 1896, Doctor Auwers discusses this series of longitudes and considerably modifies General Addison's results, decreasing the value of every arc. [Th~ result given above is that of Doctor Auwers.] A constant error of about ten seconds of time runs throughout the observations at Karachi. Mr. Pogson writes "an error of exactly ten seconds in General Addison's time determination is the only possible explanation," but Doctor 4uwers states the error to be "nearly eleven seconds." General Addison, the observer, attributes it to his neglect to obtain the pivot error of his transit instrument, and is of opinion, though the resulting longitude of Karachi may be wrong, that "the difference between Isfahan and Madras remains unaffected, the errors on the east and west sides of Karachi correcting each other." Mr. Pogson considers that "no conceivable pivot correction nor any other instrumental error could account for so large a difference,'' but, on the supposition that the observer mistook the time by ten seconds, he agrees with General Addison that the effect would be reversed east and west of. Karachi, and would therefore be eliminated in the final difference between Greenwich and Madras.

In this series no determination of personal equation was made between Madras and Isfahan observers. Series D is by way of Berlin, Malta, Alexandria, Suez, Aden, Bombay, Bellary, and Madras. Captain Burrard states in regard to this series:
This series is discussed by Doctor Copeland in Vol. III, Chapter XXIII, of the Dunecht Observatory Publications, and by Doctor Auwers in a paper on "The longitude of Aden,'' published in the Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 318o, dated August 15, 1893. Doctor Auwers's discussion is reprinted in Die Venus-Durchgange, 1874 and 1882. [The result given above is by Doctor Auwers.] In vol. 1 of the Annals of the Cape Observatory, Mr. David Gill, who was one of the observers of this series, writes: "In case of Lord Lindsay·s·expedition (i.e., of series D) the observers lay no claim to high refinement. They were made throughout in the open air with small portable instruments, which, in the case of Alexandria, were placed on the roof of a hotel, where the observer had to abstain from movement during each complete observation; otherwise the level was disturbed ·by the change of his position. At Aden and Alexandria the chronometers bad to be carried a long distance between the observing station and the telegraph office. The observers were without personal assistance, and the crucial observations for time had often to be made under conditions of extreme fatigue, amounting on one or two occasions nearly to exhaustion on the part of the observers engaged. In fact, the character of the work was only such as it was possible to organize and execute en route, and the results fully realized the accuracy expected from them."

Series Eis by way of Mokattam, Suez, Aden, Bombay, Bellary, and Madras. this series Captain Burrard says:

Of

In the Annals of the Cape Observatory Mr. Gill points out that this series E was not executed with such refinements or precautions as are necessary for the determination of fundamental longitudes, and Mr. Hunter, the Suez observer, in his report to Sir George Airy, states that the micrometer screw was "decidedly drunken " and that he had to apandon its use, and "to trust to observing the polestar in both positions of the instrument over the fixed wires for collimation '' ( p. 322 of tl].e Account of Observations of the Transit of Venus, 1874, by Sir George Airy). The personal equation of the Greenwich and Mokattam observers varied from o".025 to o'.655 (p. 288, Transit of Venus, 1874).

From the above statements it will be seen that the three series, B, D, and E, can scarcely be considered in deriving the fundamental longitude of Madras, though they served their puq)ose at the time they were made. Series C wa.S executed by the English with the greatest care, and at present must be considered the only reliable determination of the longitude of Madras. ' Nine differences of longitude ente.r into it and will be giv~n in a table later. The observers were Captains Burrard and Lenox-Conyngham in 1892-4-5, and Captains Campbell and Heaviside in l876-188x. On the arc Potsdam-Greenwich the personal equation of the

observers was eliminated by an exchange of observers. On the other arcs there was no exchange of observers, but their personal equations were determined by special observations, and the observers were so placed at the several stations that in the final longitude of Madras personal equation would be eliminated as well as possible. In the table the differences of longitude l to 6 are taken from VoL XVII, Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, and the full details of the work will be found in that volume. The differences of longitude 7, 8, and 9 are taken from Table IX, pages 440 and 441, Vol. XV, Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. These three differences are in the longitude net of India, and the values given are the adjusted values. The details of the difference Bolarum-Bombay will be found in 'vol. XV and of differences BombayKarachi and Madras-Bolarum in Vol. IX of Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. The arcs Berlin-Greenwich 1876 and Berlin-Potsdnm 1901 give the difference of longitude Potsdam-Greenwich o".236 in excess of the difference given in the table. In 1903 the Geodetic Institute undertook a new determination of this ·arc and the full details of the work will be found in the publications of Des Konigl. Preuszisschen Geodatischen Institutes, Neue Folge No. 15, "Bestimmung der Langendifferenz Potsdam-Greenwich im Jahre 1903." The work was conducted by Doctor Albrecht. In the observations the Repsold registering micrometer was used. On each evening three complete time sets were observed and four independent exchanges of signals. The star programme was so arranged as to eliminate to the greatest possible extent any uncertainty in the right ascensions of the stars. Midway in the determination a change of position of observers and instruments took place. This determination with a probable error of only ±o".003 will supersede all previous ones. It gives the difference of longitude Potsdam-Greenwich o".098 :in excess of the difference given in the table for series C, and this amount will be added to the longitude of Madras from this series for a final result.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

The difference of longitude between Valdivostok and Moscow was determined in 1874-'75 by Generals Schamhorst and Kuhlberg of the Russian army. It includes 12 arcs. The difference of longitude Moscow-Pulkowa was determined 1872 by Kortozzi, Kuhlberg, Bonsdorf, and Switzki. These thirteen differences of longitude can be found in vols. 35 and 37 of Memoirs de la Section Topographique de l'Etat Major General de la Ru~ie, and the results given below have been taken therefrom. The difference of longitude Pulkowa-Greenwich given by Captain Burrard in his report is superseded by more recent determination 1901-1903 by the Germans in two arcs Pulkowa-Potsdam and Potsdam-Greenwich. The latter arc is the one used in deriving the longitude of Madras. The former was also determined by Doctor Albrecht with the same instruments and methods, and can be found in the publications of Des Konigl. Preuszischen Geodatischen Institutes, Neue Folge No. 7. "Bestimmung der Langendifferenz Potsdam-Pulkowa im Jahre 1901 ". The following table gives all the results used to determine the longitude of Vladivostok.

APPENDIX NO. 4.

TELEGRAPHIC LONGITUDES.

On account of the differences of longitude of Manila-Madras and VladivostokManila not being freed from personal equation, proper weights can not be given the values for the longitude of Manila derived from them, to combine them with the Coast and Geodetic Survey determination. The strength of the determination of the difference of longitude between San Francisco and Manila may be judged from the result~ given in this appendix. The longitude of San Francisco depends upon the Longitude Net of the United States and its connection with that of Europe, which includes 72 differences of longitude between 45 points. Four of these differences of longitude are trans-Atlantic, three by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and one recent result, 1892 (not yet published), by the English and Canadians.

Honolulu.
In September, 1874, Capt. G. L. 'i'upman, Royal Marine Artillery, in charge of the British Transit of Venus Expedition of that year, arrived in Honolulu and established an observatory on Punchbowl street, near the shore. No pains were spared to ascertain the longitude, by lunar observations, and the latitude, by zenith distances of stars measured with an altazimuth, and the accuracy of the work has since been fully confirmed. The observations for longitude were continued through the months of October, November, December, and January. During this time were obtained 7 results from occultations of stars by the moon, 52 results from the observations of moon culminations, and 60 results from the observations of zenith distances of the moon combined with the observed culminations and zenith distances of well-known stars. The result officially communicated to the Hawaiian Government Survey was 10 h. 31 m. 27.2 s., and upon this all the L. M. Z. computations and maps since then have been based. In March, 1875, Captain Tupman made an attempt to connect Honolulu With Sa~ Francisco by transportation of chronometers. Accordingly twenty chronometers were carried by H. B. M. S. Reindeer, Commander C. V. Anson, from Honolulu to the United States navy-yard, Mare Island, and compared with the local time at both stations. Unfortunately the Reindeer was blown out of her course by a northerly gale, which lengthened her voyage seven or eight days and lowered the temperature in the chronometer boxes as much as I5° F. Hence the resulting determination of the longitude of Honolulu, viz, Io h. 31 m. 33.2 s. ± 3.0 s. W., has ·very little value. Again, in August and September, I884, an attempt was made by the Hawaiian Government Survey, with the cooperation of Professor George Davidson and Mr. Fremont Morse in San Francisco, to determine the longitude of Honolulu by comparing the -chronometers on board the Oceanic Steamship Company steamer Mariposa with the local time at each end. This was done for two round trip~, giving a mean result of 10 h. 3I m. 25.8 s. In view of the above facts the Hawaiian Oovernment adopted IO h. 3I m. 26.0 s. as the most probable value, in rating chronometers arid furnishing standard time, until the recent telegraphic determination made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

As it was impossible to connect the Coast and Geodetic Survey observatory at the naval station directly with the transit of Venus station, which is now a lumber yard, the Territorial Survey connected it with the Harbor Light-house and three principal trigonometrical stations by triangulation, which gave for the new longitude of the transit of Venus station

differing from Captain Tupman's value only o".036, a remarkably close agreement. The Harbor Light-house is 1 8 · 166 west of the Coast and Geodetic Survey station, which gives for its longitude Midway Island.
In 1900 a survey was made of the island by officers of the United States Navy on board the Iroquois, under the command of Lieut. Commander C. F. Pond. The Hydrographic Office Chart No. 1951 is based upon this survey. The position given for the point marked Observation Spot is Lat. 28° 13' 15" N. Long. 177 21 30 W. l lh 49m 26" W. This Observation Spot is 192.4 feet west of the longitude station of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, which makes its longitude, based upon the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Long. 177 22 46 .4 W.

Guam Island. In 1899 the officers of the U. S. S. Yosemite made a survey of the harbor of San Luis d' A para. A concrete pier was built on Fort Santa Cruz and its geographic position determined. Near the town of Soumaye a base was measured and a triangulation of the harbor was made. In 1901 the officers of the United States Navy extended the triangulation over the island. The following is taken from notes furnished by the Hydrographic Office of the United States Navy: "The geographical position of the observatory, as obtained by meridian-transit observations and the transportation of eight chronometers back and forth from Yokosuka, Japan, is *Lat. 13° 26' 22".28 North Long. 144 39 21 .45 East"

'l'he mark at North Base was found by the Coast and Geodetic Survey longitude party in 1903 and was connected with the longitude station by triangulation. 'l'he Coast and Geodetic Survey longitude station is 59.09 meters north and 276.27 meters west of the North Base. Hence the longitude of North Base derived from the Coast and Geodetic Survey longitude station is 9h 38m 36" .07 East, giving a correction of 1".38 to the longitude of the pier in Fort Santa Cruz given above, or longitude of Observation Spot is 9h 38ru 38".81 East.

PREFACE

Part IV A, "Outlines of Tidal Theory," appeared as Appendix 7, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1900. The aim of that appendix is to obtain through theoretical considerations, rational so far as they go, a first approximation to the times of the principal ocean tides. Part IV B aims at a system of CfJtidal lines which, while conforming to all reliable data, shall reasonably well meet the requirements of the theory alluded to, and so, for most regions, constitute an essentially true representation of the tides. The labor involved in the construction of these lines has been so great that many matters relating to the subject have, of necessity, either remained undeveloped or, if appearing in the accompanying text; have been but scantily treated.

MANUAL OF TIDES-PART IV B. COTIDAL LINES FOR THE WORLD.
By ROLLIN A.
HARRIS.

CHAPTER I.
ON THE COMBINATION OF LONG WAVES.
1. The combination of long waves under several conditions has been briefly considered in Chapters III and VIII, Part IV A, and some similar questions for ordinary waves have been treated in Chapter II, Part I, and Chapter IV, Part IV A. A few questions relating to this subject and which have important bearings upon the construction of cotidal lines will be considered in this chapter.

2. The combination ef two progressive waves. Suppose the space origin to be situated at any convenient point and suppose one progressive wave to move toward +x and the other, at some angle to this direction. Suppose the time to be reckoned from Greenwich or any other given meridian. Let T' denote the time of high water of the first wave at x=o and T" that of the second wave at the origin. Then the vertical displacement may be written

C=A' cos (at-lx-aT')+A" cos (at-(y-aT") =A' cos ( 8-lx- E' )+A" cos ( 8-ly- E" )

(1)

where the axis of y is generally oblique to the axis of x. When the direction of the second system is the same as the first, or opposite to it, y should be·replaced by x or by -x. If A" =A' the lines of no tide are given by the equation

If A";z:!A', then there must be some rise and fall at every point of the surface covered by either or both of these wave systems.

which determines the position of high or low water for this case at any given time. The time is referred to the time of high water of the first wave at x=o if E'=o, and to the time of high water of the second wave at y=o if E"=o. The amplitude of the tide at any point x, y is obtained by substituting for 0 in ( 1) its value from (2 ).
3. The combination of a stationary and a progressive wave, both lying /n the same direction. Suppose the space origin to be situated at a loop of the stationary wave and suppose the progressive wave to move toward +x. Suppose the time to be reckoned from Greenwich or any other given meridian. Let T' denote the time of high water of the stationary wave at x=o and T" that of the progressive wave at x=o. Then the vertical displacement may he written

The time is referred to the _time of high \vater of the stationary wave at x=o if E' ==o, and of the progressive wave at x=o, if c"=o. The amplitude of the tide at any point xis obtained by substituting for {fin (4) its value from (5).* In case the progression is toward -x, replace l x by - ! x. Since for natural bodies of water the end boundaries at the loops of a stationary wave are seldom such as to turn back the approaching particles simultaneously because of irregularities in the shore line, extensive shoaling, or more especially breaks in the ~alls, it is evident that progressive waves must often accompany stationary ones. t Here no attempt will be made to determine what the relative positions and amplitudes of the two waves must be. In fact it must generally happen that the amplitude of the progressive wave diminishes as we go from the locality giving rise to it, to points from which it appears to come: (Cf. § 8). Although such combinations are quite common in the oceans, waves from other causes frequently so obscure them that it is seldom worth while to actually perform the computations necessary for making the combination. Some fairly good instances may be cited and which will be referred to in the description of the cotidal lines of the several localities: The northeastern cqrner of the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, the Pacific Ocean west of the South

Shetland Islands. See Figs. 6, 7, and 28, also Fig. 23 of Part IV A. Other instances are the Bay of Bengal, Adriatic Sea, English Channel, Irish Channel, Baffin Bay, Long Island Sound, Gulf of California, and Gulf of Georgia. In most of these cases the progres"sive wave is rather small, it being due to the shoaling and irregularities of the body of water and not to an opening in an end boundary. ·But, as will be noted in Chapter III, the earth's rotation often sensibly modifies the tide in the vicinity of a nodal line, apparently increasing the range of the progressive wave on one side of the channel and diminishing it upon the other. The general tendency of the progressive wave is to obliterate the nodal line of the stationary one; the larger its amplitude, the less crowding up there generally is of the cotidal lines at the nodal line. This combination of waves applies .only to regions of water where the oscillatory motion is nearly rectilinear. Progressive waves in the ocean are generally direeted toward openings in the shore. line, espedally if the r.ise and fall of the tide be there considerable. Consequently it seldom happens that in rthe ocean the particles oscillate in the same direction in both stationary and progressive waves.

4. Tile combination ef one statiomzry wave witlz anotlier lying transversely to it. Suppose the space origin to be situated at a loop of each wave. Suppose the time to be reckoned from Greenwich or any other given meridian. Let T' denote the time of high water, at x=o, of the stationary wave whose motioµ is parallel to x, and .T" the time of high water, aty=o, of the stationary wave whose motion is parallel toy. Then the vertical displacement may be written '=A' cos lx cos (at-aT')+A" cos ly cos (at--aT") ( ) 7 =A' cos Ix cos (0-e')+A" coi;; ly cos (0-e")

This ratio appears indeterminate at x=o, y=o and of course at such points as x= µ7t, y= r7t, µ and r denoting integers. The. value is, however, ±1. For the lines x=o or x= µ7t, ddy becomes zero, and for y= r or y= Y7t it becomes infinite. x . Hence: · The cotidal lines are normal to the real or virtual boundaries of a square oscillating area excepting the two lines which coincide with the diagonals of the square.

which gives the direction of the cotidal line through any point iu the area. This does not depend upon the amplitudes or the phases of the two waves. Hence if we have a drawing covering the square completely with cotidal lines based upon a simple assumption like A"=A' 1 and £" -E' ±go 0 , E' or E"=o, the cotidal lines for any other assumptions can be immediately traced therefrom as soon as we have identified or computed one point in each line.

'l'he fact that two stationary waves of different phases are combined together shows that high water must occur at the middle points of the sides of the square area at times given by the waves when considered separately. And it is readily seen that the times of high water change successively through all values of a period as we proceed around the square. The distribution of the radiating cotidal lines will, however, be quite uneven, as expression ( 10) shows. Cotidal lines, whose numbers progress through all hours (i. e., form a complete cycle of values) around a no-tide point, may be called amphidromic, or the locality concerned may be said to be amphidromic. It has already been noted that the center of gravity of the surface of a deep lake is a no-tide point, and that around this point the. cotidal lines are what is here called amphidromic. For a more· extended body of water the corrected equilibrium theory still gives a no-tide point, about which the cotidal lines are amphidromic. But the determination of the point and the radiating lines is more difficult than in the case of a small, deep body of water. See § 40, Part I; §§ 49, 50, Part II; and §§ 3, 4, 92, Part IV A. If a large island lie near the theoretical no-tide point of a body having equilibrium tides the cotidal lines will, because some wave motion is always present, probably radiate from its shores rather than from the exact theoretical point. E. g., the island of Crete, Fig. 19. Amphidromic cotidal lines depending upon still other causes will be noted in §§ 5, 12, 13, 15, and in the description of cotidal maps. From expressions (3), (4) Part I, we see that the amplitude of the resultant oscillation ( 7) is

5. Tlze combination of a progressive wave witIi a stationary wave lying transversely to it. Suppose the space origin is so taken that x=o at a loop of the stationary wave and suppose the progressive wave to move toward y, a direction transverse to the motion in the stationary wave. Suppose the time to be reckoned from Greenwich or any other given meridian. Let T' denote the time of high water of the stationary wave at x=o, and T" that of the progressive wave aty=o.

The time is referred to the time of high water of the stationary wave at x=o if E'=o; and of the progressive wave aty=o if E"=o. By assigning a value to 8 (i.e. to at), this equation gives a relation between x and y, which is the equation of the cotidal line for the assumed time. From (16) we have ·

dy -tan 0 (A' sin lx cos E')+A' sin Ix sin E' dx= tan 8 (A" sin ly+E")+A'' cos ((y+E")
which gives the direction of the cotidal line whose characteristic is 8 at any permissible point x, y. . · . All cotidal lines intersect the line x=o or x= µ7t perpendicularly. At a point defined by the equations

there is no rise and fall of tide because I'; then becomes zero. At this point tan 8 is indeterminate, and all cotidal lines radiate from it. Along the nodal line of the stationary wave the tide is due to the progressive wave alone; therefore the cotidal lines divide

the nodal line into equal parts or segments whose lengths each represent the distance over which the progressive wave moves in one hour. Along the line

A' cos lx=±A"
the value of the cotidal hour at any point (y) is the arithmetical mean between the honr there given by the progressive wave and the hour of the stationary wave at .x=o; the times at the given point are always so taken as to not differ more than 6 hours from each other. Referring to the coordinates of the no-tide point, it will be seen that such a point can not exist unless the amplitude of the stationary wave at the loop exceeds the amplitude of the progressive wave.

CHAPTER II.
ADDITIONAL LEMMAS.

6. In Chapter VII, Part IV A, a number of lemmas are given which seemed to be of chief importance in attempting a partial explanation of the tides. It is convenient to here lay down other lemmas more or less related to those there given, assigning to them numbers which shall form a continuation of those already used. (26) Two areas which have a considerable stretch of latent or imaginary boundary in common will generally oscillate together and form parts of one and the same system. (See § 29, Part IV A.) Many of the areas forming parts of the systems shown in Fig. 23, Part IV A, will serve as illustrations. If, however, the dimensions and locations of the areas are such that the virtual work of the tidal forces upon the system is always small, no considerable tides will result even if the free periods of the areas agree well with the period of the forces; e. g., a short and shallow canal one wave length long (two half-wave lengths placed end-to-end). (27) If two hypothetical systems, each capable of independent oscillation in a period of 12 hours, overlap, the two motions will generally coexist with little interference; but if their individual periods differ from 12 hours more than does the period of the two when combined together, synchronization will generally take place. This lack of interference is evident in the case of two systems in a square area whose edges are 76 A. in length. (§ 26, Part IV A.) Consider next an L-shaped figure whose extreme length in either direction is ~ A.. Now if the.Lis slender, it is probable that' the two oscillations will synchronize because the free period of both branches of the L differs but little from the free period of either branch. To see this, imagine it to be high water at the angle of the L on account of an oscillation in one branch, and suppose little or no oscillation exists in the .other branch. This implies a slope, and so accel~ration, along the direction of the second branch (eq. (92), Part IV A); that is, when it is high water in the angle of the L the surface slopes away from the angle in both directions. After several periods the whole body will oscillate as one system. Of course a better oscillation would be obtained by taking the extreme dimensions of the L-shaped figure a little greater ·than ~ A. so that the virtual lengths of the two trapezoidal areas would each be ~ A in length. (Cf. § 43, Part IV A.) If the L is no longer slender but broad, then although the oscillation in one branch produces a simultaneous slope, and so acceleration, in the other branch, yet if we draw such lines of motion as a synchronization of the two systems into one would imply, it ·becomes evident thatthe periods of the res~lting trapezoidal areas will be sensibly less
327

COAST AND GEODETIC .SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

than the period of the forces. Since the surface slope belonging to the oscillation in one branch produces a simultaneous slope in the other branch, the resulting stationary oscillation in the second branch, if there be any, must synchronize with that in the first branch. But, by hypothesis, the dimensions are such that one system can not be formed out of these two branches. The transverse acceleration due to the first branch may affect an existing and sustained oscillation in the second branch, especially if the width of the first branch approaches the value Ji i\.. Synchronization may therefore generally be expected in a slender L-shaped figure provided either its external dimensions or virtual lengths equal Yz A., but in a broad L-shaped region only when its external dimensions exceed Yz i\. by such an amount that the virtual length of either arm equals Yz A.. Other cases of overlapping systems can be studied in a somewhat similar manner. Examples of overlapping areas are shown in Fig. 23, Part IV A. It is probable that the North Indian system does slightly accelerate the half-wave area extending from Mozambique Channel to Baluchistan and India, also that the South Atlantic system accelerates the North Atlantic system. In each of these two cases the effect of the smaller system upon the larger may be safely neglected. The two Pacific systems must be practically independent of each other, and the same is true of the South Atlantic and South Indian systems. 7. (28) High water occurs remarkably late along the inner side of capes which guard the entrance to a bay or broad passage. Several cases in which an inner body of water derives its tides through a strait from an outer body have been briefly considered in§§ 102-113, Part IV A. In most of these cases it can be readily seen that in the strait and in its immediate vicinity the time of tide must change rapidly, and so the time of high water on the inner side of capes partially inclosing the bay or broad passage must occur remarkably late. It is here proposed to caU attention to the lateness of the tide at the inner side of the capes in comparison with the time of tide in the near-by channel or axis, the bay being broad enough or so situated with reference to the incoming water that transverse propagation is possible near the capes. In the first place it may be noted that if the distance between the capes is so great that a wave can be transmitted at approximately the rate due to depth, the crest of the wave will be convex inward and retarded at the capes on account of the lesser depths at and off the capes than in mid-char..nel. In this connection see§ 36, Part IV A. But even if the depth were as great at the capes as in mid-channel, the tide would still be retarded. At the time of high water between the capes, the neighboring inner waters are at a less elevation. Now, whatever these inward accelerations and resulting velocities may be, the phase of the horizontal velocity in the direction taken by the incoming flood must be in advance of the phase of the horizontal velocity in the transverse direction. For, the longitudinal velocity is generally near its maximum value at the time of high water between the capes, because of the assumed motion transmitted from without, whereas the transverse velocity depending upon the transverse slope pr acceleration can hardly have begun-provided the bay is large enough to rermit of transverse progressive wave motion. As a matter of fact the incoming flood streams are not all directed parallel to the axis of the bay, but spread out considerably toward either shore of the bay. But high water along the inner side of the cape can not occur until the

APPENDIX NO. 5.

flood current along this shore reaches its maximum velocity. Hence we may expect delays of various amounts according to the sharpness of the capes and trend of the shores. Examples: Cape Chidley, Labrador, Fig. 12; Cape Charles, Virginia, Fig. 14; northern part of New Zealand, Fig. 40. In most bays, even if wide and shallow, there is no great opportunity for transverse progressions because the shores generally are such that transverse stationary waves would be formed. In such case no considerable delay will occur. The most conspicuous delays, however, are due to incomplete wave eddies, § 14. Examples are Shantung Promontory and each end of Formosa Island. 8. (29) If a progressive wave is developed at an opening in a rigid boundary of an oscillating area or over a submerged boundary, an antecedent 'lllave is necessitated; that is, there must exist a progressive wave moving toward the opening or shoal. For, the periodic, horizontal, and vertical displacements of water in the opening or over the shoal will entrain displacements far out at sea, whose phases must agree with those in the opening or over the shoal as this part of the coast is approached; e. g., the waters south of the Sunda Islands, and west of Cape Horn. (30) A stationary wave in a strait involves no antecedent wave. Three cases of stationary wave motion may be noticed. See§§ 35, 102, 103, Part IV A.

Case I.-Wlure one

ef the bodies connected by the strait has no tiae.

At tbe end of the strait joining the tided body, high water occurs at the time of elongation of the particles in the strait toward that body. Hence no progressive antecedent wave can partake of this motion; e. g., no progressive wave approaches the strait of Gibraltar from the west.

Case 2.-Where the two connected bodies have tides

ef opposite pl1ase.

At the time of high water in either body the particles in the strait will be at elongation toward that body. For example, no considerable progressive wave approaches the strait between the Faroe Islands and Iceland from the south; the same is true for North Channel.

Case 3.-Wlzere tlze two connected bodies have tides

ef like phases.

·At the time of high water in either body, as well as throughout the strait; the particles in the strait will be at their elongations toward the middle of the strait, or, rather away from the tided bodies. Many narrow channels between islands are examples of this. 9. (31) If the lines of motion of the water particles off a given part of the shore can be seen to be normal to and directed toward this part of the shore while the lines of motion off a neighboring stretch of shore are parallel with or oblique to the shore line, then, other things being equal, high water will occur earlier in the first-mentioned locality than in the second. From the first locality a stationary wave will extend seaward, and this, combined with whatever local progression there may be, causes the tide to occur remarkably early as judged from its time of occurrence at neighboring places where the motion of the off-lying particles is oblique or parallel to the shore line. (Cf. lemmas 12, 15, and 16.) Severru cases may be noticed.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1904.

Case I.-Stationary wave connected with an oscillating area. ·Instances of stationary waves along the shore line are very numerous. In fact, they almost always exist to a greater or less degree immediately at the shore line. They, however, become conspicuous in localities where they cause the tide to occur not only earlier than would otherwise have been expected, but nearly simultaneously over a considerable stretch of ·coast because the offshore deep-water tide is very nearly simultaneous over an extended region. (Cf. lemma 15 and§§ '99, 112, Part IV A.) Examples: The northwestern coast of Australia, the outer coast of Scotland north of Ireland, the Atlantic coast of the United States from Rhode Island to Florida, and the eastern coast of Nova Scotia. For many miles out from any of these shores the water is less than 100 fathoms deep, and yet no great amount of progression occurs. Case 2. - Tide wave progressing toward a large island or a corner ef a continent. As the wave approaches the land the tidal streams will no longer be normal to the direction of its crest at an earlier epoch; but will be deflected as soon as the shore line is felt. In one limited locality, however, the .streams may have the direction normal to the crest. This point is therefore characterized by earlier tides. Examples: On the eastern coast of Madagascar, southwestern coast of Sumatra, southeastern coast of Kiusiu, and eastern coast of Formosa, Figs. 7, 36. Lemma 22 should now be dispensed with. Case 3. -On and just off the open coast not far from the mouth ef an e,stuary or bay up which the tide progresses. Consider first a point on the coast some distance from the tidal inlet: High water will occur early on account of the stationary character of the wave, the flood setting shoreward and slack water occurring soon after the time of high water. As the inlet is approached, the flood just offshore is not directed normally to the shore line of the inlet, but gradually approaches parallelism therewith; hence, the incoming particles are not reflected back from the shore line and do not produce any considerable stationary wave, and so the hastening of the time of tide from this cause does not occur to the extent that it ocourred at a point of the coast farther away from the inlet. This explains why the cotidal lines may be somewhat convex outward otf the mouths of tidal rivers, estuaries, etc. In some instances shoals and channels among islands may resemble a tidal estuary or bay in ddaying the time of tide at a near-by point of the shore line, the essential thing being a transmitting medium. Examples: The mouth of the Gulf of Cambay, the mouth of Delaware Bay, of Rio·de la Plata, off the Golden Gate, off the Loo Choo Islands, and off Spencer Gulf. Case 4.-At the capes or mouth ef an estuary or bay up which body the tide progresses. Tlie set ef tlie currents in the main or outside tz'dal wave is supposed to be parallel to the general shore line. Suppose that two capes or bends in the shore line mark the mouth of the tidal estuary or bay. By placing flood arrows just off these capes, the one following the general direction of the outer coast and the other that of the bank of the estuary, the resultant arrow will show that the flo~d stream must be directed toward the cape on the far side of the estuary and away from the cape on the near side. High water will occur unexpectedly early on the far cape or unexpectedly late on the near one. The maps of cotidal lines for_ the North Sea show several instances where the cotidal lines are suddenly broken or recurved at or off the far capes or forelands. The

Case 5.-A broad reflective bay the direction the main body.

whose axis is transverse to the

direc~

In a broad reflective }?ay leading off abruptly from the general shore line parallel to which the off-shore tislal currents set, high water may occur earlier along the axis of the bay than at certain shore points nearer to the mouth. For, the off-shore flood has the general direction of the shore line, and the flood well in the bay must be comparatively weak and be directed toward the 11ead of the bay. The wave being practically stationary along the axis, it will be high water at the head of the bay as early as at its mouth. This tongue of water, having remarkably early tide, gradually produces high water along the shores of the bay in the same manner as a stationary wave in off-shore deep water generally controls the tide at the shore. These small delays may be due to the trend of the shore line of the bay, to shoals, to tidal rivers branching from it, etc. The fact that the off-shore tidal current is supposed to.set in tbe general direction of the shore prevents the water at and outside of the mouth of the bay from all flowing toward the bay and filling it practically instantaneously as a perfectly stationary off-shore wave would have done. That is, the paths of these particles differ somewhat from what the paths would have been had the tide in the bay been simply a stationary wave connected with some oscillating area of the ocean whose direction of motion coincided with the direction of the axis of the bay, Cf; lemmas 9, 28. The Bay of Biscay tide occurs earlier at the eastern part of the northern coast of Spain than at the \vestern part of the coast. High water occurs earlier at Cadiz than at ·Cape St. Vincent. It occurs earlier in the Cromarty Firth than along the coast extending eastward. The locality of earliest tide on Cape Cod Peninsula is about the middle of the western coast. See Figs. 15, r8, and 2r. ' · ro. (32) In going up a tidal river the rate of propagation at any point is usually somewhat less than that given by Lagrange's formula ../gh, where Ii denotes the mean depth of the cross section. ·R!'!asons for this will be considered in Part V.

The deflecting force

ef the earth's rotation.

From equations (116), (117), Part IV A, we have as the components of the force which a unit particle moving on the earth's surface is capable of exerting because of the earth's rotation, Southward force = 2k,v, cos 0= -2k,vw cos 0 Eastward force = -2k 1 v8 cos 0= 2k,vn cos 0 Total force (20) (21) (22)

= 2k,v cos 0.

The direction (from the south via east) of action of this force is given by the equation

and the direction (.x) of the path of the moving particles by tan

v,

v,

The force therefore acts at right angles to the instantaneous path of the ·particle and is therefore a deflecting force. The moving unit particle has a tendency to crowd, or slightly move relatively to the earth's surface, to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in· the southern, the force representing this tendency being 2k 1 v cos 0. This deduction from Laplace's equations of motion is known as Ferrel's law. It was demonstrated and published by Ferrel in 1859, in Runkle's Mathematical Monthly. The paper containing the demonstration has been republished by the Signal Service of the United States Army in Professional Paper No. VIII. In order to show that the earth's axial rotation must affect the tides, recourse is often had to the case of a body moving in a north-and-south direction at a given latitude but gradually altering its local direction as other latitudes are reached. However, this restriction to north-and-south motions is wholly unnecessary, as equation ( 22) shows; and, moreover, the results of even these motions are not always understood and correctly presented. Ferrel thus states the law, and comments upon it:
Hence in whatever direction a body moves on the suiface o.f the earth, there is a .force arising .from the earth's rotation, wlzich deflects it lo the rig/it in tlze northern lzemisphere, but to the le.ft in the southern. This is an extension of the principle upon which the theory of the trade winds is based, and which has been heretofore supposed to be true only of bodies moving in the direction of the meridian.* * Runkle's Mathematical_ Monthly, Vol. I ( 1859), p. 307. 332

It is of interest to quote here from Prof. G. H. Darwin's recent book on tides. Of course, the author's purpose is illustration rather than comprehensiveness or extreme accuracy; but the statements are somewhat misleading in that they impress one with the necessity of north-and-south motion in order that a deflecting force shall arise. Moreover the second sentence is misleading even for north-and-south motion. In fact, the east-and-west acquired component velocity relative to the earth's surface is not simply the difference between the absolute velocities of two points fixed on the surface of the rotating earth. From D' Alembert's principle we readily obtain

which equals zero because gravity, being the only impressed force considered, passes through the axis of rotation. For one particle we have

That is, the total eastward velocity - times r remains the same for all latitudes. In these equations the coordinate axes are fixed in space and r denotes the distance to the axis of rotation.
\Vhen, in the northern hemisphere, water moves from north to south it passes from a place where the surface of tht! earth is moving slower, to where it is moving quicker. Then, as the water goes to the south, it carries with it only the velocity adapted to the northern latitude, and so gets left behind by the earth. Since the earth spins from west to east, a southerly current acquires a westward trend. Conversely, when water is carried northward of its proper latitude, it leaves the earth behind and is carried eastward. Hence the water can not oscillate northward and southward, without at the same time oscillating eastward and westward.*

That a particle moving upon the earth's surface with an eastward velocity tends toward the equator, while a particle having a westward velocity tends toward the poles can be readily seen from the fact that the ellipticity of the earth's meridian is chiefly, directly or indirectly, due to the motion of rotation. Therdore an addition to the absolute eastward velocity increases the ellipticity while a diminution in this velocity lessens the ellipticity. t Since the earth rotates 36o 0 in one sidereal day, its angular velocity (k,) 1s o.ooo 072 921 radian per second, and so the deflecting force becomes

Amphidromic regions in straits and canals.

In§§ 4, 5 amphidromic regions due to two systems of free waves in the same body have been briefly considered. Mention is there made of the fact that small, deep bodies of water which obey the corrected equilibrium theory constitute such regions. This section deals with those dependent upon the deflecting fore~ of the earth's rotation. If a channel or strait of sufficient length be so narrow that its free transverse oscillation period be several times less than twelve hours, the flood and ebb streams will give rise to the transverse slope just indicated. · This transverse oscillation may be combined with longitudinal oscillations, either stationary or progressive, in ways analogous to those given in Chapter I. Of course,. this treatment will be only approximate because the character of such motions, when influenced by the earth's rotation, has never been fully ascertained. However, if the transverse motions are small, this treatment must be nearly correct. Allowance must be made for the variation in velocity at different parts of the channel, as the value of the transverse slope depends directly upon the velocity of the stream. In a strait connecting two bodies of water whose high waters differ in tiine of · the strait, occurrence by six hours, and so indicate the existence of a nodal line across the alternating transverse slope will reduce the nodal line to a no-tide point around which the cotidal lines will be amphidromic; the progression, i. e., sequence of tidal hours, will be counterclockwise in the Northern HemiSphere and clockwise in the Southern. Similarly for a stationary oscillation in a canal more than }{° A. in length. Examples of this are North Channel, Strait of Korea, Norton Sound, arm of sea between Holland and England (Figs. 20, 22, 34, 36). In a narrow canal or tidal river up which the tide wave is propagated at the rate due to depth, the range of tid~ will be increased upon that side toward which the flood stream crowds and decreased upon the opposite side. The times of the tide will, however, not be altered. In a canal-like body having both a stationary and a progressive wave, the no-tide point will either disappear or be transferred from the position given by the stationary wave. The effects can be seen by combining all waves, as in Chapter I. Suppose high water of the progressive wave falls upon the nodal line of the stationary wave at the time of maximum flood stream; then for a small amplitude of the progressive wave the no-tide point will be moved fron'l the center of the stream toward one side, and for a large amplitude the no-tide point will cease to exist, but a crowding up of the cotidal lines will occur on the one side and a spreading out on the other. Examples are the English Channel, Irish Channel, Gulf of California, Gulf of Georgia, and Adriatic Sea (Figs. 19, 20, 3 I, 32).
13. Dependent landlocked wave eddies.
In § 115, Part IV A, a brief account is ,given of ordinary eddies; i. e., eddies in which the flow is everywhere steady for a time at least. We are now to consider

APPENDIX NO. 5.

335

eddies in bodies of water which are largely surrounded by land, and which are so large and shallow that various phases of the tidal streams exist simultaneously. Comparison may be made with cases 2 and 5 of the section just referred to. The motion may be assumed to begin at a point of the coast of the embayment (or body of water covered by the wave eddy) where the rise and fall is comparatively large. This can be inferred from the rise and fall of the neighboring waters, upon which the derived wave eddy depends. The wave proceeds thence along the shores of the embayment, but gradually decreasing in amplitude, until it again joins the main or outside body of water or passes into some other arm of the sea. Through the greater part of its course the rate of the shore wave is about that due to depth; but there may be much crowding together or spreading apart of the cotidal lines where the wave finally joins the main body. Generally speaking, the nearer this shore wave comes to agreeing in phase with the main body where the latter is finally reached, the more likely are such wave eddies to exist. The point of beginning of the shore wave is often a cape or headland where the coast suddenly recedes from the general direction of the tidal motion in the outside body. (Of. Lemma 19.) Examples are the southern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Fox Channel, southern part of the Gulf of Pechili, the waters between Borneo and Malacca Strait, and the main body of the North Sea. The first three are twelve-hour eddies, the fourth a twenty-four-hour eddy, amt the North Sea may be regarded as an incomplete eddy, since the final progression passes into the Skagerrak. There may, however, be a small wave from the Naze toward Stavanger, thus completing the twenty-four hours. (See Figs. 7, 13, 21, 22, 26, 36.) . · Suppose that for some distance the main body of water rises and falls simultaneously, but that the amplitude decreases from the cape at which the progression of the eddy is supposed to originate toward, but not generally as far as the other cape or corner of the embayment. This diminution is generally due to the failure of any considerable transverse wave motion to set out from the tide of the main body across the central or some other part of the opening of the embayment because of the deflecting influence or shielding effects of near-by capes and lands. . It is sometimes drie to there being a nodal line of the main body abreast the center of the opening. In this case an island situated near the center of the opening will facilitate the formation of the wave eddy. Consider the low water of the shore wave a short time after leaving the first cape. The surface slope from the region of the main body where the amplitude is small, toward the locality of low water just mentioned, will then have its maximum value. Tne maximum radial velocity will, because the motion is·oscillatory, occur three hours later, and so high water from this cause will occur six hours later; i. e., will coincide in time with the high water of the progressive transverse shore wave. The causes which produce transvers~ motion at the cape do not exist to any great extent near the region of small rise and fall, and so the apparent transverse progression in the embayment is governed hy the progression along the shore. The cotidal lines radiate from some point or locality where the range of tide disappears or becomes very small. If the circuit requires 24 hours instead of 12, it is probable that the range of tide nearly disappears over a region of considerable size; because radial flows in nearly opposite directions for opposite points of the eddy are in this case necessitated at one and the same time.

COAST AND GEODE'l'IC' SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

In all of these cases the cotidal lines may be spoken of as amphidromic. Each of the wave eddies referred to in this section is dependent upon the tide of an outside or main body of water with which it is connected. But dependent wave eddies are not always landlocked. Suppose the tide wave to be progressing from open water toward the coast through shallow waters. Suppose a broad gulf in the shore line converts the incoming wave into a stationary wave of large range at the head of the gulf and of small range 1-(A. seaward from this point.* Now suppose that from one of the capes marking the head of the gulf the adjacent shore line so recedes that a progressive wave sets along the coast and even ot;tward. "f For a while it will have a greater range than has the incoming tide. But as it must finally join the latter there will be much crowding up of the cotidal lines soon after leaving the cape; consequently there will be little or no progression at the rate due to depth, as was assumed to characterize the shore wave of a landlocked eddy during a portion of its course. Two such eddies are situated off the eastern coast of Patagonia (see Fig. 29). In all these cases the effect of the earth's rotation, although of course present, is probably insignificant, notwithstanding the fact that the order of the cotidal lines is generally counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern.
14 . .incomplete eddies, and islands.

Incomplete eddies more or less landlocked may be formed in a similar way. Referring to Fig. 36 it will be noticed that at Shantung Promontory the range of tide is only 4 feet, while at the cape on cpposite Korean coast it is 7. 7 feet. The shore wave follows the Korean coast and governs the time of tide in the shallow sea between the Yellow Sea and Pechili Strait. Shantung Promontory is a turning point for the tide around which the cotidal lines are crowded together. Lemma 28 applies to this case, but it also applies to many capes at which the range of tide is even greater than in the offing. The southwestern corner of the Falkland Islands is a turning point for an imperfect wave eddy, whose sustaining shore line extends from Staten Island to Port Santa Cruz. Cape Chidley and Ungava Bay form another example. In channels of moderate width incomplete eddies may result from the deflecting force of the earth's rotation. Examples are given at the close of§ 12. If near one end of an island in the ocean there is a much larger tide than prevails off the other coasts of the island, the tide wave may appear to progress completely around it and the tidal hours form a complete cycle of values. The cotidal lines are made to radiate, as it were, from the island from two causes-the first, that given under lemma 28, depending upon the curvature and trend of the shore line, and the second that given in § 36, Part IV A, and depending upon the shoaling around the islana. Examples are New Zealand and Iceland. Generally, however, the wave which passes around both ends of an island is so nearly alike in range and in phase that although some of the cotidal lines radiate from the island (both causes just mentioned being operative) only certain tidal hours will be represented. Examples of this are the Falkland Islands, New Caledonia, Formosa, and Franz Josef Land.

15. Amphidromic regions in the ocean. If au ocean be conceived to oscillate in more than one system it may happen that around a certain point or region the theoretical hours of the tide; i. e. those given by the tidal systems, form a cycle ·of values. In § 4 the cotidal lines for two systems in a square body of water haye been discussed. An irregular progression from the points representing the middle of the loops of one system to similar points of the other system was shown to exist-the direction of the progression being such that the time difference between any two adjacent loops is less than six hours. But if a nodal line of one system, whatever its form, crosses a nodal line of the other there must be a progression about a no-tide point, or point where the nodal lines intersect; for, these lines may always be regarded as right lines for some distance from their intersection, and the particles of each system there oscillate as if near the nodal lines of two rectangular areas.. Upon referring to Fig. 23, Part IV A, it is evident that one such progression must occur along the coast of Somali Land and another along the coast of California. Antecedent waves which move toward openings in the coast. line (or toward suddenly· receding parts of it) at approximately the rate due to depth, often govern the time of tide in certain parts of amphidromic regions, especially near the nodal lines and the free boundaries of the oscillating areas, where the range of the direct tide is small. Such a progression, due to the openings and shallow seas into and around the British Isles, to .Qenmark Strait, and to the opening between Cape Farewell and Labrador, extends across the northern part of the North Atlantic Ocean (Figs. 6, 12, 18, and 20). The southwesterly progression toward the Fiji Islands and :New Caledonia influences the time of tide in the northwestern half of the amphiclromic region whose no-tide point is situated northwest of the Society Islands. According to lemma 25, between two not too distant nonsinmltaneous regions, the time of tide will gradually change from the value belonging to the one to that of the other; i. e., the tide wave will seem to progress, but not as a free wave at the rate due to depth. That this must be true is self-evident; but how the change takes place between two regions belonging to different: systems has not been ascertained. · If two bodies of water having tides of their own, which differ in time by six hours, are connected by a strait, the wave of the strait is stationary and there will be no progression from the one to the other, and a nodal line will extend across- the strait.* If now on one side of the strait a progression exists it will obliterate a portion of the nodal line, and a very rapid progression between the two bodies will be observed. The horizontal motions of the stationary and progressive waves may be supposed to agree in phase at the nodal line. Similarly, for a progression which may exist on the other side of the strait. If both progressions are in the same direction the cotidal lines will simply bunch up in the strait. If the progressions take opposite directions on opposite shores the strait will constitute an amphidromic region. The cotidal lines will either radiate from a no-tide point, or, if the amplitudes of the progressive waves become zero not far from the shores, they will branch off from the nodal line. In either case there will be at each end of the strait a region of nearly simultaneous tide, while along the shores the time of tide changes rapidly.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, r904.

Examples: The broad strait between Iceland and the Faroe Islands has at its Iceland side a southerly progression due to the considerable tide passing through Denmark Strait and following the northern and eastern coasts of Iceland; at its Faroe side it has a northward progression due to the fact that these islands form a part of the broken boundary adjoining a good rise and fall.* In a similar way is explained the amphidromic region between the Faroe and Shetland islands. As noted in the last section, islands or capes accompanied by gradual shoaling of near-by waters often have the effect of turning or deflecting toward themselves progressive waves. The reasons for this are obvious in case of a solitary wave advancing at rates due to depths. The phenomenon is analogous to refraction. "I" Other means of accomplishing deflections are given under lemma 28. Amphidromic regions in the ocean generally have one or two broad spaces or sectors of practically simultaneous tides. Over such sectors none of the three causes just mentioned as giving rise to apparent progressions are more than barely discernible. They are regions in which progressions from other quarters of the ocean lose themselves or in which progressions to distant quarters begin to appear. According to circumstances the range of the tide may be considerable or it may be small. That the deflecting force of the earth's rotation materially assists in the production of amphidromic regions in the ocean is doubtful; moreover, the one in the Indian Ocean lies under the Equator and the one around Tahiti lies comparatively near to it.

COTIDAL LINES.

7. Remarks on cotidal dzarts.

Definite suggestions concerning cotidal lines· were made by Dr. Thomas Young about a century ago. In the Philosophical Transactions for r 831, Sir John W. Lubbock marked upon two charts, one for Great Britain and one for the world, the Greenwich and local times of the tide at the time of new or full moon. In a few instances he indicated the positions of cotidal lines. Dr. William" Whewell drew cotidal lines for Great Britain, the coasts of Europe, and the world at large, although attempting little in the Pacific Ocean. A few years later, Sir Geo. B. Airy gave in his Tides and Waves a chart for Great Britain and one for the world based chiefly upon the charts of Whewell. A map of the world showing the establishments, Greenwich times of tide, and spring ranges is given in a book entitled "The Tides" published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London, 1857. A chart of the coasts of Europe, showing the Greenwich times of tide, the spring ranges, also the character of the tide waves, whether progressive or stationary, accompanies the text. No attempt is there made at drawing the cotidal lines. In the U. S. Coast Survey Reports for r 854 and r 857, Superintendent Bache gives a sketch of the cotidal lines for the Atlantic Coast; a similar sketch is given for the Pacific Coast in the Report for 1855. In the Report for 1856 a sketch is given for the diurnal wave of the Gulf of l\'Iexico, and in the Report for 1862, maps for both diurnal and semicliurnal waves around the Gulf coast of Florida. Many other maps of cotidal lines for limited areas have been published at various times. The most recent cotidal chart of the world is one by Berghaus, constructed in 1889-90, and which accompanies his Physikalischer Atlas; it is reproduced as Fig. 25, Part IV A. He also gives a chart for western Europe, reproduced as Fig. 26, Part IV A, one for the East Indies and China, and one for the \Vest Indies and the Atlantic coast of the United States. Van der Stok, in his book entitled "Wind and Weather, Currents, and Tidal Streams in the East Indian Archipelago,'' gives two maps around this archipelago, which are reproduced as Figs. 29, 30, Part IV A. Generally the cotidal charts have been constructed for the purpose of showing the Greenwich lunar time of high water on the days of full and change of the moon; that - - - - - - - - - ---··------- --

is, tlle vulgar establishment is cdnverted into lunar hours and to it the west longitude, expressed in hours, is added or from it the east longitude is subtracted. If harmonic analyses were sufficiently numerous, the establishmeut obtained py dividing M.° by 30 could be used to advantage; the chief drawback to this proceeding would be the fact that the mean time of high water is affected by the higher harmonics M 4 , M 6 , M 8 , · · · In the charts accompanying this paper, the mean or corrected establishment has been used. While this may, from a scientific point of view, be less desirable than the M. establishment, it has the advantage of referring to actual high water instead of to component high water. The difference may be considerahle in rivers and other shallow boc\ies of water. \.The Roman numerals denote the Greenwid1 lunar time of mean high water. The side ef the line upon wliich a numeral is written indicates the direction in which the wa·ve appears to progress. J Of course in most oceans and deep bodies of water simple progressions of free waves at rates due to depth seldom occur by themselves; and reasons for this fact have already been given. For convenience the word ''progression'' will be constant~y used in connection with any sequential change however irregular o.r complicated this may be. At most localities the vulgar establis11ment is about one-fourth of a lunar hour greater than the corr~cted. The approximate cotidal hours from the values of M 2 intervals are gh'en in§ 97, Part IV A;§ 19, Part IV B. The values of the true mean intervals, which alone are supposed to be used in the accompanying charts, have not always been determined. Many are given in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Tide Tables. The Arabic numerals scattered over the cotidal 'maps indicate mean ranges of the tide in feet at the points or localities to which they refer. If the values are estimated from spring and neap ranges they are generally given to whole feet only; if, however, a somewhat closer estimate is attempted, common, and not decimal, fractions are used. The latter fractions generally signify that the mean ranges have been determined either by computation from harmonic constants (according to rules given in Part III) or have been deduced directly from observations. If the diurnal wave is so large that only one high water and one low water occurs daily when the moon is near extreme declination, the diurnal components are omitted from the computation of the mean semidaily range of tide, and the resulting ranges are bracketed. Charts of ocean depths are given as Figs. 19, 20, Part IV A, but in actually constructing cotidal line~ many detailed charts are required. A few of the more interesting localities are given as Figs. 31-39, Part IV A. In shallow bodies there may be progressions at rates due to the depths. Table 50, Part II, may be adapted to such cases. Table 5 r, Part IV A, is for deeper bodies. Time and data are wanting for comtructing cotidal lines for the diurnal tides, but this work may be undertaken in the future. It is hardly necessary to say that the accompanying charts have cost much labor, and still leave much to be done.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1904.

20. Note on the measurement

ef tides at sea.

The measuring of the rise and fall of the tide at sea has seldom been undertaken because of the difficulties connected with such operations. By ancho~ing a boat from either end and frequently measuring the depth of the water (about 20 fathoms) over an even bottom, Captain Hewett, R. N., ascertained that there was practically no rise and fall at a point between Holland and England. This has been taken to be a no-tide point in Fig. 22, and it agrees well \Vith the location inferred from the tide along the coasts.* More recently, attempts have been made to ascertain the rise and fall in shallow bodies of water by means of pressure gauges. The gauges have generally been placed upon the bottom. It has be~n suggested that a suitable anchorage and several guys might be arranged which would allow the gauge to be floated just below the action of the storm waves, thus reducing the total pressure of the superincumbent water column. If the gauge is not too far below the surface, the pressure may be exerted upon a tube of merct:ry closed at one end. · In the Surveyor (Sydney, Australia), Vol. 16 (1903), pp. 25-28, Mr. G. H. Halligan describes a gauge designed to be submerged in small depths, and in which the pressure is measured by a column of mercury. Capt. Adolf Mensing, of the Imperial German Navy, has designed an elaborate self-registering tide gauge which works in depths not exceeding 100 fathoms. The instrument does not measure the total pressure, "but the difference between the total pressure and the pressure for an assumed depth, which does not quite equal the actual depth of water. In 1903 Captain Cust of the Triton secured tidal curves by means of a pneumatic tide gauge in the North Sea, on Brown Ridge, Swarte Bank, and the northwest corner of Dogger Bank. "f It seems to be worth while to point out the difficulty of getting a good instrumwtal range when the pressure is exerted upon a column of air contained in a pipe closed at the upper end. Let l denote the length of the pipe and J' the distance from. the upper end of the pipe downward to the surface of the water which enters it, i. e., y denotes the length of the air column. Let n denote the number of atmospheres which measure the pressure at the mouth of the pipe. c·onsequently, when the pressure is n atmospheres, the length of the air column will be In (=;1)and the depth of the mouth of the pipe below the surface will be

The most reliable means for measuring the tide away from the coast appears to be a sounding apparatus consisting essentially of a piano wire attached to a heavy weight composed of material of little value, such as a box or bag of stones or gravel. The weight when once cast is to remain immovable on the bottom and is not to be recovered. The wire when drawn taut will indicate whether or not the vessel is directly over the weight. The aim of the observers on board is to so maneuver the boat that the wire shall become approximately vertical as many times as possible throughout the period of observation, and at each such time to note the depth of the water. There certainly can be no serious difficulty in measuring tides in a few hundred fathoms where the surface of the water is reasonably calm. For, the tension can be made' sufficiently great for eliminating the errors caused by the sag of the wire resulting from its own weight combined with the impulse of the tidal current. By aid of this apparatus ancl suitable floats it is probable that permanent currents can be measured at sea in any depth of water.*

r. A 7ote concerning tl1e .fundamental SJ'stems.

The principal systems upon which the semidiumal ocean tides depend are shown in Fig. 23, and described in §§ 72-78 of Part IV A. These constitute a rational scheme with reference to which observed facts can be arranged and, in a measure, interpreted; in fact, they make it possible to estimate the time of tide in various parts of the ocean itself. By aid of the cotidal lines and ranges as now shown in Figs. 6-4 r, it would doubtless be possiole to modify the systems in. some details. This, however, would require considerable time and study; and the results obtained by aid of the modified systems cou.ld hardly differ much from those depending upon the original. · The following are a few suggestions: · The half-wave are·a extending from Mozambique Channel to Baluchistan and India has in§ 73, Part IV A, been described as if belonging to the South Atlantic system. It will be noted in § 26 that it is mainly a dependent area having tides sustained by the South Atlantic and South Indian systems and modified by the North Indian system. . The southern nodal line of the North Atlantic systems should probably have been drawn more nearly parallel to the coast of South America, thus bringing its eastern end nearer to the Cape Verde Islands. By referring to Figs. 35, 36, 37, and 39, it appears that the nodal line from Japan might be extended southward to the equator, and that the northern shores of Celebes, Gilolo, and New· Guinea might be regarded as forming a portion of the southern boundary of the North Pacific system. It seems probable that. the South Pacific system should be considered as comprising little, if anything, besides the L-shaped figure shown.on the chart of systems. With this view of the case the nodal line south of the Hawaiian Islands and· belonging to the northern branch should be moved southwesterly, or toward the Fiji Islands. The southwesterly ·progression toward these islands probably helps to explain the tides in the vicinity of this line. It is probable that the nodal line near New Zealand should be moved southeasterly.

Remarks on tidal problems.

While I believe that all candid readers of Parts IV A and IV B will recognize therein a partial and approximate explanation of the tides, I also believe that more comprehensive modes of treatment will be desired and undertaken by the analyst. It is here proposed to show what are some of the difficulties to be encountered. For many years after the time of Laplace, nearly all writers on tidal theory followed closely in his footsteps and laid great stress upon the tides in an hypothetical sheet of water which either covers a rotating globe or constitu~es a zonal sea, the depth being assumed to depend upon the latitude but not upon the longitude. More recently it has been recognized that an important step toward the complete solution of tidal problems is the determination of the free periods of the bodies of water upon a rotating globe. The hopelessness of this undertaking can be easily seen upon recalling the fact that the mode and free period of a plane rectangular body of water rotating about a vertical line have never been determined. The free oscillation of a circular sheet rotating about a· central line can, however, be found by aid of Bessel's functions.* Laplace succeeded in finding so.lutions of his tidal equation for a rotating globe covered with water. But the possible modes of free oscillation for an ocean covering a globe uniformly has only recently been investigated by Mr. S. S. Hough in the Philosophical Transactions. If the effect of rotation be ignored, spherical sheets of water bounded by meridians or parallels of latitude or both can be treated by aid of general spherical harmonics. These results are, to say the least, not very encouraging. · The real tidal problem presented to us by nature is concerned not so much with the possible free oscillations of an ocean as a whole as with those oscillations which may exist across certain parts of the ocean and whose free periods are nearly equal to the period of the tidal forces. Consider for the moment an oscillation between two opposing walls placed in a broad tank of water at such a distance apart as to best respond to the impressed periodic forces. If one or both of the lateral boundaries be wanting, the deflecting force caused by rotation at a moderate rate about any vertical axis can have little to do with the oscillation because its effect can not accumulate. Even in the case of a rectangular body of water bounded on all sides by rigid walls, the deflectfog force due to rotation would not, excepting for certain critical widths, seriously alter the mode and period of oscillation. The approximate effect upon a narrow rectangular body can be seen from § 1 I, making (j = o for the case of .a plane sheet of water. In nearly all cases of tidal oscillations rigid lateral boundaries are incomplete. The problems seeming to require first attention are those relating to the free oscillations of such bodies disregarding in the first instance the deflecting force of the earth's rotation. It is probable that similar problems relating to . plane sheets of water if capable of satisfactory solution cquld be readily extended to sheets upon a sphere. A somewhat analogous subject is that of the vibration of a stretched membrane where a portion of the rigid boundary is wanting; but the analogy is obviously incomplete, because we are in this latter case concerned only with the membrane itself. The problem of an open organ pipe is in some respects more nearly analogous to the one in question, for account must be taken of the motion of the air outside of the pipe as well

as of the air within. It seems probable that experiments, if carefully made by aid of suitable apparatus, can throw much light upon the movements of the water particles, especially along the free boundaries of imperfectly inclosed areas. Many tidal problems of minor importance require attention. One intimately connected with the problem just referred to is the law of transit.ion of the times of the tide between two nonsimultaneous areas in the open ocean (lemma 25). Another is the transition or sequence' of the times experienced in passing through a strait connecting two independently tided bodies; or bodies whose tides are not independent of each other. Another problem relates to the possibility of equilibrium tides in a gulf or partially inclosed sea.* Questions relating to the resistances in liquid motion and to the nature of flow at various depths will be considered in Part V. · The resistance referred to in Chapter VI, Part IV A, is assumed to be small and to vary as the first power of the velocity of the moving particles. This assumption generally permits the character iJ.nd period of the motion to remain the same as it would have bee1i had no resistance (and so no sustaining force) been involved. The amount being kept in abeyance leaves the absolute value_of the amplitude of tide undetermined. Even if the amount of resistance were known, the fact that the free period of the body differs somewhat from the period of the forces will directly affect the amplitude of the tide. Many important conclusions respecting tides in canals, where friction (proportioned to the velocity) is taken into account, have been reached by Airy.i" For simplicity such matters have not been brought into Parts IV A and IV B, although a complete explanation of the tides in shallow bodies of water must depend largely upon them. For instance, Airy shows that in a canal stopped by a barrier the tide can not consist of a stationary wave alone, but that the resistance encountered necessitates a wave progressing inward and up the canal._ 'Observations show that, however suddenly terminated a shallow bay or river may be, the stationary wave is always accompanied by a progressive one, although it is hard to find examples in which other causes are not also · operative. It is not probable, however, that progressions found in deep bodies often owe their existence to the frictional resistance experienced by the bodies themselves. The effect upon the tides of the attraction of the water in its disturbed state can be safely assumed to be small.

CHAPTER V.
!·THE SEMIDIURNAL TIDES IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.

23. The Indian Ocean north of the thirtieth degree of south latitude is, with one exception, but little influenced by the tides of other waters. The exception is due to the fact that there is a good rise and fall around southern Africa and in Mozambique Channel, where the tide depends upon two systems of oscillations which are determined by boundaries l:'.lrgely outside of the North Indian region. These systems, styled South Atlantic and South Indian, are described in Chapter YII, Part I\' A. It may be noted h~re that observations indicate about I.5 as the Greenwich lunar time of high water in Mozambique Channel, and that this is about the theoretical time of the tide, for it is a mean between XII or o and III; see Fig. l, which is taken froin the chart of semidiurnal systems in the Part just referred to. Extending from l\fozambique Channel to Baluchistan and India is a half-wave area whose time of tide, as will be noted later, is largely governed by the tide in the channel. 24. The North Indian SJ'stem.

This system consists of the canal-like whole-wave area extending from the northwestern coast of Australia to the coast of Somaliland and Arabia, and of a dependent fractional area, viz., the Bay of Bengal. Since the eastern part of the whole-wave area has much greater depth than the western, there are some advantages in regarding the whole strip as two half-wave areas. First of all it is required to ascertain the theoretical times of high water at the loops (i. e., ends and middle) of this strip by applying thereto arrows which denote the intensity and direction of the tidal forces at as many points as we find it necessary to take. In this instance the two points where the axis or central line crosses the two nodal lines will probably be sufficient. The positions of these points are about latitude 12,Yz~ south, longitude 103° east, and 3.Yz 0 north, 67U 0 east, respectively. The trend of the axis of the eastern half of the canal is about south 75 ° east and of the western half, north 58° 401 west. The free period of this body of water being reasonably close to a half lunar day for a binodal mode of oscillation, therefore the elongation of the particles, and the high or low water, must happen when the virtual work of the impressed periodic forces becomes zero.* ·For, as will appear from the inspection of Fig. 2, the length and position of the canal are such that the forces tend to incite a considerable oscillation; that is, their effects are not continually neutralized, At various assumed Greenwich lunar hours reduced to the local time by adding the east longitude, project the force arrows upon the axis of the canal. t Considering J;irst the canal as uniform throughout its length, and supposing the forces to act upon equal masses undergoing equal but opposite displacements at the two nodes, the virtual work at any

given time may be represeuted simply by the sum of the forces applied to the two nodes provided we regard those as positive which urge the water, say, toward the ends, and as negative those urging it from the ends toward the center. In Fig. 2 the forces being applied only at the two nodes, are gh·en equal weight; those acting on the western area are written to the left of the ordinate, and those acting on the eastern arc placed to the right. Forces directed westerly are represented by broken lines and easterly by full lines. The curve in Fig. 2 may he regarded as representing the virtual work in the

present instance for all hours because w.e can assume that at various times the magnitude of the arbitrary time element is so taken that at a given point the absolute length of the corresponding virtual displacement remains the same for all times; in other words, that the numerical \·alues of the Yirtual displacements are inclependei1t of the time and depend only on the positions of the points considered. They are comparatively large at nodal lines and zero at the loops. Fig. 2 shows that high water at the ends should occur at III.36, Greenwich lunar time, and so at the middle at IX.36.

will be noted that for a uniform canal the displacements are equal and opposite in the two half-wave lengths. Hence the sum of the products of the impressed periodic forces by the virtual displacements must be zero at the hour III.36.* If two half-wave rectangnlar areas of different depths and widths meet end-to-end at a loop and are othenvise completely surrounded by rigid walls, the above rule for - - - - - - - - - - - - - -· ---- - · - - - · - · · -----·--------------··

finding the time of tide by means of the virtual work can be carried out in almost as simple a 1'11anner as in the case where both are uniform; for, considering each area as being divided into the same number of elementary slices, the product mass X force X displacement, in the two areas, is proportional to depth X \~·idth X force. In other words, instead of giving equal weights to the two sets of values, as was clone in Fig. 2, one set is to be given greater weight than the other. Again, and this probably has more bearing upon the actual strip under consideration, it is reasonable to suppose that, because of the numerous straits eastward from Java, and the obliquity of the northwestern coast of Australia to the general direction of the strip and the shoaling along this coast, a greater percentage of the forces acting upon the eastern half-wave area will be lost than of those acting upon the we~tern. · In other words, the set of values in Fig. 2 belonging to the west~rn part should have a slightly greater weight than the set belonging to the eastern. For this reason it appears that III is probably about as good a value for the times of high water of the stationary wave at the two ends as can be readily estimated from theoretical considerations. Immediately connected with the whole-wave. area is the Bay of Bengal. \Ve can con::;ider the water extending from the head of the bay to some distance southeast of Ceylon as a dependent area somewhat canal-like in form with a nodal line extending from Ceylon to the western coast of Sumatra at a distance from the virtual head of the bay of ;1 A., or one-quarter wave length. This area synchronizes with the remainder of the system of which it forms a part, and the two together constitute the north Indian system.*
25. Tlte waters nort!t and nortltwest

ef Australia.

The eastern half of the whole-wave area has, besides the stationary wave, whose high waters occur at III and IX, a progressive wave, clue largely to straits or openings between the islands. Of special importance is the strait south of Timor Island. From this opening to the Gulf of Carpentaria, especially where the water is shallow, the tide is chiefly progressive, a? shown by the cotidal lines. The progression due to this and other openings is felt halfway or more to the African coast. On account of .the great depth of the Banda Sea and of the shortness and considerable depths of the passages around Timor Island and vicinity, the tide is nearly simultaneous over this sea. It is somewhat later and a trifle smaller than the tide around Timor. The maximum eastward velocity through Ombay Passage north of 'fimor must occur between the time of mean sea level rising (for western Timor) and high water. The progressive wave due to this short strait, approaching from the west, must have its maximum velocity, or high-water phase, northwest of Timar at about the time of maximum velocity in the strait; consequently it must be in advance of what it would be were it to reach tl,ie Ombay Passage at the time of high water of the stationary wave. In other words, the tide just west or south of this boundary, pierced by short straits, is a little earlier than it would have been had the straits been broad and the area beyond shallow. It seems reasonable, therefore, to suppose that the progressive wave at the eastern extremity of the one-waye area (say about along the meridian of Ku pang) should be about half an hour in advance of the stationary wave. Assuming that the

amplitude of tl~e progressive wave along the axis of the eastern part of the whole-wave area is equal to the amplitude of the stationary wave at the loops and that the former is half a lunar hour in advance of the latter at the loops, we have, by § 3, the distribution of the coti<lal lines shown on ·the map alo11g the central line of the area. At first sight it seems strange that the amplitude of this progressive wave could be ,more than a small part of the amplitude of the stationary wayc at the loops. But it should be noted that the energy coming through the tidal forces into the oscillating syste~n is mainly consumed in overcoming the resistances experienced throughout its various parts. If, now, a part of this energy be lost to the system because of breaks in the boundary near a loop or because of extensive shoaling, the resulting progressive wave traversing a region small in comparison with the whole system may, for some considerable distance westward from the opening in the boundary, have an amplitude comparable with that of the remaining stationary waye, and the system will oscillate ni.::arly as it would in the case where no energy were thus lost; but, of course, the amplitude will be somewhat diminished. It is reasonable to suppose that the southern extremities of the cotidal lines west of Australia and numbered IX to II turn eastward, somewhat as shown upon the map, because of the progres.<;ion directed tpward Timor Island.
26. Tile liaif-wa1Je area.

'l'his area extends from Mozambique Channel to Baluchistan and India, being largely a dependent one whose tide is governed by the rise and fall in and just south of the channel. It has already been remarked that observation and theory give about I.5 as the time of high water in the channel. The bracketed values XII or o and VI, shown in Fig. r, are intended to refer only to the South Atlantic system; that is, they indicate the theoretical time of tide as it would be without the North and South Indian systems, and not the times of the actual tide. Assume now the existence of the South. Indian system without the North Indian; the tides in this area will, as was assumed before, synchronize with those in the channel, and so instead of o and VI we shall have about I.5 and VII.5. If, on the other hand, a wall were built across the charinel, the theoretical times of tide produced in this half-wave area would. then be II. r and VIII. r. But the L-shaped region extending from Mozambique Channel toward India, thence to northwestern Australia, can not have twelve hours as its free period because the virtual length of either of the two trapezoids into which the region can be divided is too small, being in each case less than that of the original rectangle. It is, therefore, fair to assume that the Mozanibique-India half-wave area does not synchronize with the Australia-Arabia whole-wave area; for, although each has a free period approximating twelve hours, the period of the combination reganled as an L-shaped figure is much shorter.* \Ve can, therefore, by lemma 27, suppose. that the oscillations of the north Indian system and that of the :rviozambique-India area are nearly independent of each other, although it is probable that the latter is. accelerated a few minutes by the former because

Before proceeding further, let us consider the case of two systems of oscillation in a square area. For simplicity, let the two amplitudes be taken as equal. Suppose the phase of the north-and-south oscillation to be 60° in advance of that of the east-andwest oscillation.

that the cotidal lines are crowded together near the nodal lines of the component oscillations. The crowding will differ from that shown in Fig. 4, if we use another amplitude ratio and phase difference. But this figure will give a general idea of how the cotidal lines should be drawn for a square area. In all cas_es where the phase difference is not zero or ;:80° there must be a no-tide point around which the numbers of the cotidal lines progress, but not uniformly or at the rate due to depth. \\There the phase difference is zero or I 80 ° there will be a nodal line and no progression.*

Returning now to the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters we note that the conditions are far from having the simplicity of a square. Nevertheless, considering the superposition of two independent systems, it can hardly be doubted that there exists a point near the intersection of the nodal lines (Fig. 1) where the range of tide is very small. It is almost certain that the cotidal lines should approximately radiate from this point being crowded together in the vicinity of Cape Guardafui and spread apart in the

Arabian Sea and toward the Mozambique Channel. Moreover, the progression around this point should be clockwise and apparently irregular. Instead of the complete square, Fig. 4, imagine a region having nearly the form of a square, but deprived of a portion of its boundary, as shown in Fig. 5. The half-waye area occupies the greater part of the western half of region. The western half of the whole-wave area covers a little more than the northern half of the region. The eastern boundary, although imaginary or latent,* is as good as rigid so far as producing the tide is concerned. Although, as will be noted in § 31, the cotidal hour for the region

lying between the central loop of the North Indian system and that of the South Indian system is not far from VIII, and so the hour for the whole of the eastern encl of the hypothetical square differs but little from IX, it is impossible to have an east-and-west oscillation across the southern portion of the square because no whole-wave area is possible immediately south of the North Indian system, and so the li1tent boundary of the eastern side of the square-can not extend beyond the southern limits of this system. At the India end of the :Mozambique-India region the east-and-west or whole-wave oscillation is probably as important as the north·and-south or half-wave, while at the south encl the east-and-west oscillation is not directly felt. Hence, at India the tide occurs between the hours III and VII.5. lti the Mozambique Channel, on the contrary, it occurs at I.5, or probably a little earlier (say at I), because of the slight influence of the north Indian system already referred to. Around the southern Maldive Islands, and especially around the Chagos Archipelago, the half-wave oscillation does not exist. From the Arabian Sea to the loop south of Ceylon the tide is small, and there an irregular progression occurs, as is usually the case between two nonsimultaneous regions not too far apart.* There is also an irregular progression from the loop south of Ceylon to northern Madagascar. The direction of these progressions is clockwise, as was that inferred at the close of the preceding paragraph. In the Gulfs of Aden and Oman the tide consists chiefly of stationary oscillations, although there is some progression on account of the inner waters beyond. Each of these two gulfs constitutes a dependent canal-like area whose length is a small fraction of the wave length A.. i· The Persian Gulf being a large, shallow body of water connected with the Gulf of Oman by a large strait, has a tide which progresses at about the rate due to depth. There is some retardation :,i.ncl therefore some crowding up of the cotidal lines in the strait.

27. Tile Red Sca.t

The tide in this sea .is composed of a stationary wave caused by the tidal forces acting on its.waters and a progressive wave produced by the outside tidal disturbances acting through the Strait of Bab el Mandeb. The force arrows applied to the nodal line of this sea, regarded as a simple canal-like area whose period is about a half day, give IV.5 and X.5 as the cotidal hours of the north and south ends, respectively. Because the ra1ige of the outside tide diminishes rapidly in passing through the strait, it is difficult to ascertain where a wave progressing at the rate due to depth will be established. But observations made at the north end of the sea indicate that high water of the resultant or combined wave occurs there at about III. 7 5 hours, whereas, according to what has just been said, the high water of the stationary part should occur at IV :5. If now we assume the amplitude of the progressive wave over the Reel Sea to be constantly equal to the amplitude of the stationary wave at the loops, and assume the phase of the progressive wave to be 45° in advance of the phase at the loops of the stationa'ry wave, the result of combining the two is as shown by the cotidal / lines, the extreme soutk.rn encl of the sea being excepted (§ 3). On account of the extreme narrowness of the strait, these assumptions concerning the progressh·e tide seem to be reasonable. In making the computations the depth of the sea was assumed

to have a certain constant value over the region north of the nodal line and a slightly smaller but constant value over the region south of it. The manner in which .tl:e cotidal lines should be distributed in and near the strait is somewhat uncertain because the theory underlying such cases has not yet been worked out.* As indicated hY the map the tide in the narrow but deep Gulf of Akabah is chiefly a stationary wave, whose high water is about simultaneous with that at its mouth. The tide in the much shallower Gulf of Tor is also chiefly a stationary wave with a node at Tor Bank. ·r However, as the ending of the gttlf is not extremely abrupt there must be some small progression upward. Assuming the coticlal hour of both stationary and progressive waves to be III. 75 at the mouth and the constant amplitude of the progressive waYe to be one-third of the maximum amplitude of the stationary wave, we obtain the cotidal lines shown on the map.
28. No large wa<x progresses .from tlie South .Indian Ocean into the North Indian, producing the tide of tlzc latter.

An harmonic analysis of the tides at Freemantle, Swan River entrance, western Australia, shows that the average range of semi<liurnal tide is there only 0.4 foot. A similar analysis at Port Louis, :\fauritius Island, gives for the mean range of tide 1. 1 feet. Upon examining any chart of the Indian Ocean which shows the depths approximately, it will be seen, upon making a few measurements, that the region of small range extending from Freemantle to Mauritius Island can not indicate a true nodal line. Again, observations do not indicate that nearly the whole of the Indian Ocean belongs to one system, as such an extended nodal line would imply. \Ve are therefore led to believe that there is a region of small semidiurnal tides extending from Freemantle to Mauritius Island, and that the absence of a good tide is <lue to the fact that the distance between western Australia and Madagascar does not approximate to A or to one-half A, as an east-and-west stati01iary waye would require. Some tide, however, exists, and for reasons which will be given in § 31. By referring to the table given in § 97, Part I\T A, it will be seen that for Freemantle (690), Kupang (614), Banjuwangi (561), and Port Louis (870), the ratio S M, is larger than the corresponding ratio of the tidal forces, i. e., than 0.465. The same is true of Port Darwin (681.5), given in § 19, Part IV B. This indicates that the length of the whole-wave area of the North Indian system, especially of this area when joii1ed with or influenced by the waters between Australia and Madagascar, corresponds better to a solar-·wave length than to a lunar. This accords with inferences made from known distances and depths by aid of Table 5 I. Again referring to the same tables it will be seen thaJ: the ratio O,· K, is considerably less than the corresponding ratio of the forces ( = o. 71 I), not only for the stations just mentioned but for the Indian Ocean generally. This shows what might have been inferred from Fig. 24, Part IV A, that the Indian diurnal system responds better to the period of K, than to the period of 0 ,. There is some inward progression from Rodriguez northwesterly toward the Farquhar Islands and Cape Amber, but it is to some extent mixed up with the

stationary wave around northern Madagascar. In fact the tide between Rodriguez Island and Cape Amber is due chiefly to the rise and fall at the north end of Mozambique Channel; that is, a species of dependent transverse oscillation, part stationary and part progressive, is maintained by this rise and fall. A somewhat similar effect 111fJY exist off Korthwest Cape, Australia. The cotidal lines must change from VIII to I in going from the early region east to Reunion Island to the northern end of l\fozambique Channel, and from VIII to III in going from this early region to the loop northwest of Australia.*
29. Jlfisccllaucous remarks.

Upon referring to Fig. I it will be noticed that because of proximity to nodal lines the range of tide around Ceylon and southern Hindustan must be small. For the same reason the tide along the outer or southwestern coast of Sumatra should be small. The tide at the western encl of the southern coast of Java should be smaller than is the tide farther east. All these requirements accord well with the observed facts, as can be seen upon referring to the large map, Fig. 7. . The distribution of the cotidal lines through each of the nodal lines respectively located east of Ceylon, off the Malabar coast, and off Somaliland has not been made upon the map in accordance with any assumed mathematical law. The lines are chiefly conjectural, although in accord with the observations. Upon measuring the dimensions of the oscillating areas, it may appear that the actual lengths are a trifle too short for the existence of large tides, although no definite criterion has been laid clown in such matters. There are difficulties in the application of Lagrange's rule to even a canal-like body of variable depth. It seems, however, upon comparing the times required for the eruption of Krakatoa to have been felt at ports in India, Arabia, apd Africa, that the areas as laid. down on Fig. 1 must ha\'e a free period sufficiently long to permit good stationary oscillations. t The map shows several cases in which a derived wave is produced at a sudden shoaling. For example, the Gulf of Martaban, the vicinity of the mouths of the Ganges, the Gulf of Cambay, and off the Gulf of Kutch. The progression north of Australia is due largely to such sudden shoalings as the Sahul Bank. A dependent stationary wave is apparent in the Gulf of Kutch, and some traces of dependent stationary waves, shown in the acceleration of the times of the tide, can be seen at the So-mile beach (on the northwestern coast of Australia) and near and in the mouth of the Hugli River. Sokotra Island and neighboring shoal have some influence upon the distribution of the cotidal lines in that locality. A similar remark may be made concerning the Laccadive and Maldive Islands. In passing through Sunda Strait, the range rapidly diminishes, while the cotidal lines bunch up. t A somewhat similar statement is true of the narrow straits farther east.**

30. h'vidcnrc obtained .from tidal stn·ams.

The directions of the observed tidal streams as gh-en in the Admiralty Pilots afford some clue to the chara~ter of the tidal oscillation, especially in localities whee the motion is rectilinear. Around the l\falcli\·e Islands the floocl stream sets easterly and around the Chagos Archipelago it sets southeasterly.· In the northern end of :rviozambique Channel the flood sets southerly and in the southern encl northerly. Moreover, we find that flood slack occurs soon after high water in the channel, as a stationary oscillation requires. These facts could have been inferred from Figs. 1 and 7. On the southern coast of Cape Colony, from Table Bay eastward to Port Alfred, 110 sensible tidal stream exists, although there is a moderately large rise and fall. 1'his is in accordance with the lines of motion terminating at the shore which nms nearly perpendicular to them. See Fig. r. The southern shore of Halnchistat~ lies at tht.0 loop of the half-waye area as also of the whole-wave area. Consequently the tidal streams should there be weak, and observation shows this to be the case. Across the shoals and around the islands east and northeast of Madagascar there are strong tidal streams. According to the map of coticlal lines, this is a region where the tide varies both in time and in range; such conditions always imply large accelerating forces for the water masses and generally large velocities, especially over shoals. In the short straits which separate from one another the islands east of Java, the currents should be swift. This statement is confinned by observation. But whether or not the time of maximum flood velocity is an hour or so before the time of high water at the southern ends of the straits has not yet been ascertained. Strong tidal currents occur among the Nicobar Islands and generally among the Andaman Islands. At Table Island the ;;treams turn at about the times of high and low water. The streams in the Gulf of Suez accord well with the notion of a stationary wave, the times of slack water very nearly coinciding with the times of the tide at the head of the gulf.*

The South Indian system has been briefly considered in § 77, Part IV A. It extends from the south coast of Australia ioouthwesterly Yz A to where it is supported by the Antarctic Continent; thence northwesterly Yz A to Madagascar and South Africa. By constructing a diagram similar to Fig. 2, it will be found that the theoretical coticlal hour for either encl is about III, and for the middle IX. According to Figs. 6 and 40, the cotidal hour for the south coast of Australia is about III. By referring to Fig. 6, it will be noticed that there exists a region north of Kerguelen Island, from which the numbers of the cotidal lines increase in whatever direction one goes. The approximate time of tide of this region can be seen from theoretical

considerations, viz.: It should be not far from IX, because this is the time for the loop of the systems lying to the north and to the south of it.* On account of the magnitude of the space between the two systems, it is reasonable to expect to find small ranges between Australia and Madagascar. Farther south the range is greater; the mean range at St. Paul Island being 3.0 feet, and at Betsy Cove, Kerguelen Island, 3. 2 feet. According to Fig. 6, the hour for this region is VIII. Figs. 6 and 7 show a number of progressions in various directions whose antecedent waves extend to this region t and have the effect of causing its tides to occur a little earlier. Just westward of this early region, particularly of its northern part, a great crowding up is necessitated because the tide south of Africa and Madagascar occurs at I, Greenwich time, and its range is there considerable. Spencer Guif.-According to Fig. 40, the· tide is partly progressive and partly stationary. The same is true of the Gulf of St. Vincent. Tliis can be seen by using the depths given in Fig. 34, Part IV A, and Table 50 or 5 r. The-tides off Kangaroo Island are delayed by openings on either side of the island. t Bass Strait.-The Pacific tide joins the Indian tide near the western encl of the strait. The range of tide is somewhat greater at the eastern encl than at the western. In Port Phillip the tide is delayed and its range diminished by the narrow entrance. (See Figs. 34, 35, and § 105, Part IV A.) South of Tasmania there is a large region whose cotidal hour is about X. The tide is largely clue to the Pacific acting through the channel between :New Zealand and Tasmania. But upon referring to the South Pacific system (Fig. 23, Part IV A) it will be seen that the loop marked XII lies near the Antarctic Continent sontheast of New Zealand, while the loop marked IX of the South Indian system rests upon the Antarctic Continent southwest of Australia. Hence the time of tide along the Antarctic Continent changes from IX in this last locality through X south of Tasmania to XII southeast of :N"ew Zealand. From this X region to the loop marked III just south of Australia the time of tide changes rapidly, as is indicated by the crowding up of the cotidal lines just west of Tasmania.

THE SEMIDIURNAL TIDES IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.

33. Character

ef Atlantz'c tides.

The tides of the Atlantic Ocean are remarkable for the smallness of the diurnal wave, a circumstance due to the absence of oscillating systems whose free period approaches 24 hours.* As the small tides of the :Mediterranean Sea caused the civilized nations of antiquity to pay little attention to the semidaily rising and falling of its surface, so in later times the small diurnal inequality in the Atlantic caused the western nations to regard as remarkable the tides observed in other seas where this inequality becomes prominent. But when Newton calculated its theoretical amount by his equilibrium·hypothesis he saw that the forces indicated an inequality in the tides several times greater than any which had been observed on the coasts of Europe. This led him to an erroneous explanation of the phenomenon. The error was pointed out by Laplace. But he in turn makes the erroneous suggestion that the smallness of the diurnal rise and fall in the Atlantic may be analogous to its total absence in case of a globe uniformly covered with water. t The semidiurnal tides of this ocean are due chiefly to twb oscillating systems, which are described in §§ 72-73, Part IV A. By referring to Fig. 6, it will be seen that there is one conspicuous amphidromic region southeasterly from Newfoundland, the center being placed at 40° N. and 40° Vi.'. It will also be seen that there is, generally speaking, a northerly progression in the time of tide from the Antarctic Continent south of Cape Colony, through the main body of the Atlantic. The progression from South Africa northward led to the .once common belief that the tides of the Atlantic are largely, or even chiefly, derived from the waters farther east. It is true that unaccountable irregularities in the rate of this progression and great variations in the range of tide caused many students of ihe subject to doubt the derived-wave hypothesis. The reasons for a general northward progression along the western coasts of Africa and Europe ar.e not difficult to find, nor are its irregularities surprising. ' Given several regions of high water, such as would be producerl hy two oscillating systems, it is clear that in going from one region to another the times of tide for all intervening points will be forced to assume all intervening values. The change may be made suddenly, causing a crowding together of the cotidal lines, or it may be made in such a way as to distribute them more equably. t Progressive waves in the ocean are generally caused by openings in the shore lines at or near the loops of the oscillations where the rise and

fall is considerable. A similar cause is the sudden receding of the shore line from a part of it which supports a good rise and fall. t The openings around the northern part of the North Atlantic generally favor northward progression; so do the sudden recessions of the coast and changes of depth near Cape Frio, South Africa, and between Sierra Leone and Cape Verde. But even in this ocean there are progressions taking other than northerly directions. The tidal hour for the waters around southern Greenland lies between VIII and IX, and for deep water off the eastern coast of the United States it is about XI~. Some kind of southerly progression from the former region to the latter must, in consequence, take place. t The tide progresses southwesterly from a region west of the Cape Verde Islands to the northeastern coast of Brazil. This is largely due to the overlapping of the two systems ( § 4). However, on account of the general tendency of the progressions of the times of tides, we shall begin with the southeastern corner of the ocean and gradually work northerly and westerly. The tides of Patagonia and Argentina will be described in. connection with the South Pacific system, from which they are derived.
34. · Sout/i Atlantic Ocean.

*

The first half wave of the South Atlantic system (Fig. 23, Part IV A), extends from the Antarctic continent to latitude about 27° S. The southern coast of Cape Colony is therefore less than ~ A distant: from the Antarctic continent, and so the intervening region responds to the solar forces more readily than to the lunar. The east-and-west extent of the Cape Colony coast line is not, however, sufficient for the establishment of an independent solar system of large rang~ of tide. II Doubtless the South Indian system, taken in connection with the adjoining waters to the north of it, also favors the solar forces. Hence it .is not surprising to find that the ratio S 2 iM 2 is 0.55 for Durban, Port Natal, and 0.47 for Port Elizabeth, Algoa Bay. Cape Town being less influenced by the South Indian system, the ratio S 2/M 2 becomes somewhat smaller, viz., 0.42. The considerable progressive wave over this half-wave area is necessitated by the progressive wave generated near Cape Frio, as mentioned in the preceding section, and which is chiefly responsible for the tides in the Gulf of Guinea. Between the loop marked XII, west of South Africa, and the eastern coast of Brazil is a branch of the next or second area of the South Atlantic system. The great distance between the lines V ~ and VI, east of Brazil, Fig. 9, indicates the stationary character of the oscillation. The decrease of range in going from Pernambuco to Rio de Janeiro indicates approach to the free southern boundary of this branch area. The Admiralty Tide Tables give 2 feet as the value of the spring range at Ascension Island. This indicates that the nodal line of the area probably passes not far from it.~

35. From Liberia lo the Windward Islands.

The tides of Liberia and Sierra Leone are not much affected by the North Atlantic system, but belong chiefly to the South Atlantic system. Hence, unless delayed by shoals, the tidal hour should be VI. A nodal line of the North Atlantic system probably passes just south of the Cape Verde Islands. Hence it happens that from a region south of these islands or even from Liberia to the Barbados the time of tide changes by scarcely more than half an hour. There are extensive shoals west of Sierra Leone and around the Bijonga Islands. The northeastern coast of Brazil forms a portion of the end boundary of the North Atlantic system, and so the theoretical time of tide for the greater part of this coast is about VIII.* The southern lateral boundary of the South Atlantic system is situated some distance out from the coast of Guiana and Brazil, somewhat .as indicated by a heavy line in Fig. 23, Part IV A. Hence the theoretical time of tide off this coast lies between VI and VIII (§ 4). The extensive shoals off the Amazon and Para rivers cause a considerable progression, and delay the time of tide for this part of the coast. In going up the shallow delta of the Amazon, the tidal hour is much incre::sed; but tidal data and even soundings are so meager that cotidal lines can not be drawn far up the river. A bore occurs when the range of tide and stage of the river are fa,·orable. t The tides around Trinidad Island belong almost entirely to the North Atlantic system. The range is much greater on the south side of the island than on the north side, the oscillatioi1 in the former locality being better supported than in the latter. Hence the strong currents experienced by Columbus in the Dragon's Mouth.t From Trinidad to Guadeloupe the semidiumal range of the tide diminishes rapidly. The tides in the southeastern part of the Caribbean Sea are derived from the loop marked VIII of the North Atlantic system influenced, however, by the loop marked VI of the South Atlantic system.//
36. From Guadeloupe lo the United States.

The range of the semidaily wave on the south coast of St. Thomas Island is a little less than 0.3 foot, and the mean range of tide San Juan, P.R., is I.I feet. These indicate that the nodal line lies not far east of St. Thomas. Figs. I 1, 14, 16, show how nearly simultaneous are the tides along the greater part of the Atlantic coast of the United States, the Bahamas, the northern coast of eastern Cuba, the northern coast of Haiti, and of Porto Rico. ··Moreover, the range steadily increases in going from St. Thomas to Savannah River entrance where it is 6.8 feet. All these facts point to a stationary oscillation, and Fig. 23, Part IV A, indicates that it forms part of the South Atlantic system. Here we have one of those rare cases where a nodal line of a system is not obscured by progressive waves or by the overlapping of another system. Upon cdnsultin~ the charts of soundings, Figs. 19, 20, Part IV A, and making use of Table 51, it will be seen that the length of the South Atlantic system is a little more than 312 A.. Hence unless neighboring waters alter the mode of oscillation for the solar wave it follows that the ratio S_;M must be less than the ratio of the corresponding ·-·--- ---- - - - - - - - - --- ---- - - - - ·t ~ 15, Part I. * Lemma 9.

forces. The quarter wave length here considered is almost free from sttch mfl.uences. Hence the remarkably small value of this ratio for tides along the Atlantic coast of the United States. See table in § 97, Part IV A, Nos. 32-w5. 37. The Caribbean Sea. The tide along the coast of Panama agrees well with the corrected equilibrium theory both as to time and range (§§ 2, 3, Part IV A). The tide in the northern portion of the sea is due chiefly to the tide north of Cuba and Haiti acting through the Windward Passage. Farther west the effect of the tide in the Gulf of Mexico becomes apparent. See Figs. 1 r and 17. As already noted, the tide in the southeastern corner of the sea depends directly upon the tide in the ocean j ttst outside. The northeastern corner of the sea can have only very small ranges because a nodal line exists in the outside waters, and because the numerous openings between islands which bound the sea on the north and east prevent the formation of an equilibrium tide. The hour of tide changes rapidly, increasing toward the north. Very little is known of the tides along the southern coast of Haiti or along the opposite coast of South America.
38. Tile Cuif ef St. Lawrence.

The tides of the Gulf and River of St, Lawence are interesting in several respects, but chiefly on account of a large, stationary oscillation, a landlocked waYe eddy or amphidromic region, and a wide variation of range at different points of the river. The first of these features has been noted in § 91, Part IV A, and the other two are shown upon Fig. 13, Part IV B. A map of soundings covering this region is given as Fig. 31, Part IV A. . North of the Magdalen Islands the range of tide is small while in the channel off Cape Rosier or Gaspe the range is 4 or s feet. The shore line here suddenly turns off from the direction of the main channel, forming the western boundary of a broad, shallow embayment. Hence, by lemma 19, a southward progression takes place following the general direction of this shore line. Section 13 deals with cases of this ki11d; what is there referred to as the ''outside body'' is here represented by the channel between the Magdalen Islands and Anticosti Island. The range of this progressive shore wave diminishes as it proceeds. The part entering Northumberland Strait from the west meets the wave from the east at Cape Tormentine. Upon referring to the cotidal chart of this region as well as to the chart of depths, it will be seen that progression in the river at the rate due to depth does occur below the mouth of Saguenay River. The greatest range occurs off the lower end of the Isle of Orleans, where it is nearly l 7 feet; the tide disappears at Lake St. Peter. As might be expected, the duration of fall in the upper part of the river considerably exceeds the duration of rise; at Quebec the difference is two solar hours. The tide of Chaleur Bay is chiefly stationary. A branch of the main channel extends northeasterly \x:tween Newfoundland and Anticosti Island. The tide in the center of this branch is nearly simultaneous with that at the point where it .joins the main channel; but some delay occurs in reaching

372

either shore. Moreover, the gradual narrowing and shoaling of this area between Newfoundland and Quebec causes the range on either side to be considerable, viz., 3 or 4 feet. The tidal hour off the eastern end of Anticosti Island being II 76 and off the western end a little more than Vy;;, the cotidal lines must crowd together in the strait north of this island. The Strait of Belle Isle has little influence upon the tides of the Gulf. The tidal hour is probably between XII and XII 76 for the eastern coast of the Magdalen Islands, and probably assumes all values from ,Y:; to XII along the remainder of the coast, but no data are available for verifying this conclusion.*
39. From Nova Scotia to Rhode Island.

Along the greater part of the Atlantic coast, extending from Nova Scotia to Florida, the time of tide is but little delayed on account of the strip of shallow water which borders it. (For depths, see Figs. 19 and 31, Part IV A.) This is an application of lemma 9, since the offshore flood and ebb streams are probably nearly normal to the coast line. We can imagine canals leading from deep water to or into the coast line, each having a stationary oscillation. G'enerally such canals are less than ,UA. in length. The Gulf of Maine has a shoaling at Georges Bank which causes a progression to there be formed; that is, the Gulf of Maine can not be considered as forming part of the large body of water to the southeast or even as being a dependent area synchronizing with it. The virtual length of the Gulf of Maine and the Bay of Fundy being nearly 3(A., there must result large tides for the inner waters, sustained by the progression, and occurring three hours later than the tides outside. This has been explained in . ~ 34, Part IV A and alluded to under lemma 12. A similar explanation applies to Long Island Sound, but instead of a shoaling at the mouth we there have a contraction. In case of tidal rivers, the tide wave is generally progressive, so that there is no tendency to synchronization with the tide outside. Off the mouths of large rivers, antecedent waves become noticeable. Large as is the tide in the Bay of Fundy, it doubtless would have been a little larger, in the bay proper, had there been no Basin of Mines. For reasons similar to those just referred to, the oscillation of the bay is interfered with by any dependency which can not synchronize with it. As it is, this branch implies an antecedent wave, and so there must be some progression up the bay from this cause. The converging shore line and lessening depths increase the range in either stationary or progressive waves. For this reason the largest tides of all occur near the head of the Basin of Mines and up the Petit Condiac River, the range in the former reaching about 43 feet and in the latter 40 feet. t At Boston the range of tide is 9.6 feet and at St. John it is 20.8. The smallest known mean range of tide connected with the Gulf of Maine oscillation occurs at Tom Nevers Head, oti the south coast of Nantucket Island, and amounts to only x. 2 feet. (See Figs. I 4 and l 5.) ;

The tide north of Nan tuck et Island comes from the east and its hour 1s about IV~. The XII-hour line passes a short way south of Nantucket Island and meets the land at the western end of Marthas Vineyard. Hence the change of four hours in going through Muskeget Channel and the rapid currents. The change is also rapid between Mar:thas Vineyard and the mainland. The tide wave in Buzzards Bay is almost stationary, the time of occurrence being less than half an hour later at the head than at the mouth. The tide reaches the southern side of Sable Island about one hour .before it reaches the northern side. This shows the delaying effect analogous to that ·referred to in lemma 28. (See also Fig. 13, Part IV A.) In going from the Greenland loop of the North Atlantic system to the United States loop of the South Atlantic system, the tidal hour must change from VIII to XII. The manner in which this change takes place depends largely upon the depths encountered and upon the presence of antecedent waves which are necessitated by the progressive waves, the latter being due to openings in the shore line or to off-lying shoals, lemmas 10, 14; e. g., Cabot Strait, the submerged strait south of Nova Scotia, Georges Bank, Browns Bank, and Florida Strait. 40. From Rlzode Island to Flon'da. The tidal hour for this stretch of coast is about XII. The earliest point is Cape Lookout, where the hour is XI~. The tides in Long Island Sound are analogous to the tides in the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy, and so at the western part of the Sound are three hours later than the tides outside and upon which they depend. There is, however, some progression. The range varies from r.9 feet at Montauk Point to 7 }i feet at the western end of the Sound. On the outer or southern coast of Long Island the tide occurs remarkably early, for reasons given in connection with lemma 32 (case 3). This is so notwithstanding the existence of Fire Island Inlet and other smaller straits leading to Great South Bay. For, the flow through the inlet being simply a hydraulic effect, the tide just south of the inlet will be accelerated rather than retarded. (Cf. § 25 and statements under lemma 29.) The tides in New York Harbor and the lower part of the Hudson River have nearly the same range as the tide at Sandy Hoo}{, where it is 4.6 feet. At Governors Island the tidal hour is XII.72, while at Willets Point it is III.66. This in a general way explains the strong tidal currents in East River, as was pointed out in § 37, Part I, and § 106, Part IV A. The tides of Peconic, Great South, Jamaica, and Barnegat bays are chiefly due to hydraulic effects, the rising and falling of the waters qutside causing a rapid flow through the connecting straits or inlets. For Great South and Bamegat bays the range is much reduced and the time of tide delayed, as shown in Fig. 15. (See §§ 104, 105, l l l, Part IV A.) (In the formula there given for K, the words ''amplitude of tide outside" should be stricken out.) Up the Delaware Bay and River the wave progresses at nearly the rate due to depth. The values of Fig. 14 show that the range increases considerably above its

374

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

value at the capes. The difference betv·:een the duration of rise and fall at Philadelphia is 2 h. 35 m. _ While the funnel-shaped Delaware Bay favors an increasing range of tide, Chesapeake Bay, with its contracted entrance and subsequent expanse and connections with dependent tributaries, tends to reduce the range. The tide prog-resses up the bay, but in a somewhat irregular manner, as shown in Fig. 14. Near the mouth the high water occurs on the western shore of the bay before it occurs in the western shore of Cape Charles; this is a case coming under lemma 28. Up the numerous tidal rivers the wave progresses reguiarly. However, by lemma 32 the progression is slower than mean depth would call for. The tides in Albemarle Sound, Pamlico Sound, and in New River are very small, owing to the narrow openings connecting them with the sea. For South Carolina, Georgia, and northern Florida the range of tide is laq{er than for the outer coast farther north. Here the last loop of the South Atlantic system :finds a good support; moreover, the distance to the free northeasterly boundary of the system is considerable. The tide in the St. Johns River is greatly reduced in range at Jacksonville, where there is a constriction in the river. As the Strait of Florida~ approached the range decreases.
41. Tlze Gulf ef Mexico.

Upon referring to § 3 and Fig. 23, Part IV A, it will be seen that the tidal hour for the eastern part of the Gulf should be III, according to the corrected equilibrium theory-, and the hour for the western part should be IX. Upon referring to the chart of co tidal lines for the Gulf, Fig. 17, this will be seen to be the case; but it will also be noticed that, excepting the eastern part, the hours generally progress in going westward, and so the cotidal lines are not amphidromic, as the equilibrium theory requires. Hence arises evidence of a progressive wave from the Strait of Florida. A little west of the center of the Gulf the hour increases rapidly in going westerly, indicating that the amplitude of the progressive wave must there be small; for, if its amplitude were zero, the tidal hour would change suddenly from III to IX in crossing the center of gravity of the equilibrating surface. Consider the derived wave front extending from Yucatan to the Dry Tortugas. Suppose its center to progress through deep water toward the Mississippi Delta. The eastern wing of this wave crest will approach parallelism to the coast of Florida on account of the rapidly decreasing depth found between the deep water and this coast. (See Fig. 14, Part IV A.) The wave will reach the coast of Louisiana remarkably early or at about the time indicated by the depths of the Gulf. The range in deep water will become smaller as the distance from the source of disturbance increases, because of the ever-increasing length of the crest of the wave, which disperses the motion more and more widely. Hence the range continually diminishes as we go northward parallel to the coast of Florida. The eastern wing of the crest, by moving eastward over continually shoaling water, will cause the range to be much increased by the time the Florida coast is reached. Of course, a somewhat similar east-going progressive w~n-e results from the equilibrium tide, and the range of this derived wave will also increase. toward the coast.

The tides between Cape San Blas and the Mississippi Delta can be approximately determined by considering both the progressive wave and equilibrium tide near the edge of deep water, and adding the time of transmission to the shore. As the eastern wing hinges upon Florida Keys so the western wing hinges upon northeastern Yucatan.* The range diminishes in going from the northern coast of Yucatan northwesterly. Consequently the tides in the southwestern part of the Gulf should.be eventually equilibrium tides, and obser\"ations indicate that such is the case. Small as the progressive wave is, its range is greater than that of the equilibrium tide in the deep water south of the coast of Louisiana, thus causing a westerly progression, instead of an easterly one, in this part of the Gulf. From Fig. 23, Part IV A, it is seen that the equilibrium tide off Port ].fads, Mississippi Delta, is only o. r foot; this, however, increases to 0.4 foot off the mouth of the Rio Grande. The time of tide for the edge of deep water off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas can be estimated by giving greater weight to the derived wave off Port Eads and by gradually increasing the weight given to the equilibrium tide as one goes toward the Rio Grande. If to the times tlms determined be added the time of transmission to the shore, the tides of Texas and southern shore of Louisiana will be nearly explained. As already noted, the equilibrium tide controls the tide in the southwestern corner bf the Gulf. Between Galveston and Tampico no ·data arc available concerning the semidiurnal tides. The table given under § 97, Part IV A, shows that throughout the Gulf the ratio S ,' M 2 is considerably increased over its value for the Atlantic coast, indicating that the equilibrium tide of the Gulf is generally comparable in magnitude with the tide derived from the ocean. This is also indicated by the fact that the age of the phase inequality, as shown by the value of S 2 °-:M.0 , is much less for the Gulf than for the outside ocean. The broad simultaneous region in the eastern half of the Gulf is in a general way explained by the fact that the deri\·ed and equilibrium tides do for this region approximately agree in phase, while the crowding up of the cotidal lines in the western half results from the two waves being in approximately opposite phases. The time required to tranimit a disturbance from the western approach end of Florida Strait to the deep water line off the Rio Grande is about 2 Yz lunar hours. Some account of the tides of the Gulf has been given in §§ 89, 90, 92, 96, Part IV A.

42. Nortl1western A.frica and Soulliwcstcrn Europe.
In passing northeasterly through the Cape Verde Islands, the tidal hour increases rapidly; this indicates proximity to a nodal line of the North Atlantic system, as well as proximity to the free boundary of the South Atlantic system. A tongue-shaped region of early tide extends, as alreacl~· noted, from south of these islands to the Barbados. · South of Cape Verde Islands the hour is VI, while at the loop off Morocco it is II. The general reasons for a northward instead of a southward progressioi1 ha,·e been given in §§ 8, 33. The wide distances between the cotidal lines north of the Canary Islands and the increased range indicate a loop of the system.

Upon inspecting Fig. 18 it will be seen that the range of tide decreases from 9 feet near Cape St. Vincent, to 4.Yz at the eastern Azores and to 2 Yz feet at Flores, the most western. This shows that the tide is approaching zero range in going westward, and, taken in connection with the fact that all these places have nearly the same tidal hour, throws much light upon the position of the no-tide point. By comparing· the times and ranges of Nova Scotia, Sable Island, and the eastern coast of Newfoundland, some evidence of the existence and location of the no-tide point can be obtained. The early tides at the Strait of Gibraltar and at the head of the Bay of Biscay have been noticed in~ 8 and§ 9 case 5.
43. The ll1editerranean Sea.

The tides of this sea have been discussed at some length in §§ 84-88, Part IV A. The conclusions there reached appear to be mainly correct, with the exception of one concerning the Adriatic found near the close of § 87. The tidal hours for the eastern part of the sea nearly obey the equilibrium theory, as a comparison of Fig. 19, Part IV B, with Fig. 23, Part IV A, will show. The cotidal lines are probably amphidromic, radiating from the Isle of Crete. High water on the coast of Syria occurs at the time of low water off Tripoli. The tide from this part of the sea joins that of the western part through the straits on either side of Sicily. The cotidal lines are crowded closely together in the straits because the time of high water off the southeastern ends of the straits is II and off the northwestern a little more than VII. The tide in the Adriatic is partly stationary and partly progressive. The Adriatic constitutes a dependent oscillating area whose length is nearly Yz A.. The crowding together of the cotidal lines indicates proximity to the nodal line. The effect of the earth's rotation is. shown by the tendency to radiate from a point on the Italian shore. This body of water is quite analogous tu the English Channel, as has been noted in§ 12. The tides. of the JEgean Sea being in part derived from those of the Mediterranean near the Isle of Crete are probably small. The tide in the western part of the Medite;ranean is of nearly opposite phase to that of the Atlantic just outside. This accords with the theory of a strait leading from a tided ocean to a near-by but deep tide less sea of moderate dimensions. (§. 103, Part IV A.)

of the sea is nowhere more extensive; that it carries many currents in this direction and in that; and its ebbings and fiowings are not confined to the shore, but it penetrates into the heart of the country, and works its way among the hills and mountains, as though it were in its own domain.* The fourth summer [A. D. 81] was spent in securing the country which had been overrun; and if the valour of the army and the glory of the Roman name had permitted it, our conquests would have found a limit within Britain itself. For the tides of the opposite seas, flowing very far up the estuaries of Clota and Bodotria [Clyde and Forth], almost intersect the country; leaving only a narrow neck of Janel, which was then defended by a chain of forts. Thus all the territory on this side was held in subjection, and the remaining enemies were removed, as it were, into another island. t

The tides around Great Britain and in the North Sea are remarkable in many respects. They are best described by constantly referring to the cotidal maps of these regions (Figs. 20-22). The cotidal line IV extends from the northwest corner of France to the southwest capes of Ireland, and thence to Rockall Island. The ranges for these three places are 14, 7, and 4~ feet, respectively. This line shows how the tide approaches the land. The diminution of range gives some indications of the nodal line of the northern half of the North Atlantic system, although it is covered up by the northeasterly progressing wave. Depending upon the incoming wave are the tides of the English and Irish channels. In these bodies of water the tide is partly stationary and partly progressive, much influenced by the deflecting force of t~e earth's rotati9n. (See §§ 3 and 12.) The oscillation in North Channel is stationary, because high water at the south end of the channel occurs at very nearly the time of low water north of Ireland § 35, Part IV A. Instead of a nodal line extending acros.:> the channel, tl1e deflecting force of the earth's rotation causes the cotidal lines to be amphidromic about a no-tide point, off the Mull of Cantire, § 12. Along the northern coast of Scotland to the Orkney and Shetland islands is an easterly progression. Between these two groups of islands and through Pentland Firth, . the tidal hour changes rapidly and the flood and ebb streams are strong. The motion thus transmitted, together with that of a wave rounding the Shetland Islands, is the chief cause of the tides along the eastern shore of Scotland and England. However, a part of the wave passing north of the Shetland Islands proceeds northeasterly along the coast of Norway. Evidently the coast line at the south end of Norway is not touched by these waves, unless the progression up the coast of Norway entails a sensible antecedent wave, which may reach southward toward the Naze. Down the eastern coast of Scotland and England the wave proceeds at about the rate due to depth. All accounts agree that there is very little tide between the Naze and Stavanger. Now imagine lines drawn from this region to the Shetland Islands, Orkney Islands, and northern Scotland, and we have reasons to believe that the large wave going down the coast of Scotland and England as far as Nor folk will control the tide over a sector of the North Sea, and that the cotidal lines will radiate from a point a little way off the southwest coast of Nornay. (See cotidal maps of the North Sea, Figs. 21, 22, and§ 13.) The main progression· from the northwest turns to the east off eastern Norfolk and proceeds along the north coast of Holland and Germany to Holstein and Schleswig. From this locality northward the range of tide rapidly diminishes.

The tidal streams in the arm of the sea between Belgiun1, Holland·, and England indicate that it is essentially a stationary \Vave about J3 A. long with a maximum north.easterly stream occurring at II, as one would expect from the fact that the tidal hour in the strait is XI and the range in the North Sea is comparatively small and of nearly opposite phase. (§§ 102, 103, Part IV A.)* The earth's rotation should therefore cause the tidal hour at the Holland end of the hypothetical nodal line to occur at II and at the England end at VIII. This agrees fairly well with the observed facts. The stationary oscillation in this arm of the sea is sustained chiefly by the rise and fall at Dover Strait, and so the effect of the main body of the North Sea is little felt excepting where the arm joins it. The theoretical time of high water being II on the Holland coast, and the wave on this coast progressing northeasterly as the amphidromic requires, it will be seen that much crowding up of the cotidal lines must occur just south of Texel. Moreover, the influence of the amphidromic wave causes the tides off Texel to occur earlier than the time indicated by the Korth Sea tides alone. An opposite effect is produced on the English side. Hence the crowding up of the cotidal lines in the vicinity of Yarmouth and the broad space in the North Sea between the cotidal lines VIYz and VII. The cotidal lines shown in Figs. 2 I, 22 have a striking resemblance to the scheme proposed by \Vhewell (Phil. Trans., 1833, 1836), and which Airy discredits in Arts. 525-528 of his Tide and \Vaves. As stated elsewhere, the point at which Captain Hewett observed tides and found no rise and fall has been taken as the no-tide point for the amphidromic region between England and Holland. In passing up the Zuider Zee the tide is much retarded at the narrows near the middle of that body. South of the narrows the range of tide is diminished to about I foot. The form assumed by the cotidal lines at the mouth of the estuaries of the Forth, Humber, and Thames has been explained ·ins 31, case 4. In going up the estuaries and funnel-shaped bays of England and Scotland the range of tide generally increases. Much might have been said concerning the peculiarities of the tides of Europe, especially the want of simplicity of the wave manifested in double high waters, long stands, short stands, etc.; also the want of equality betw~~1 the times of rise and fall. But no explanation will now be attempted, for such phen~nienon can better be treated in Part V. t One curious feature of the tides of Europe, and probably of those along the Atlantic coast of Africa as '~ell, is the great variation in the ratio of 0,<'K 1 , and the large value, positive or negative, of K, 0 -0, 0 · (See Nos. 900 to 995 of the table given under§ 97, Part IV A and Nos. 910 to 1011, § 19, Part IV B.) Upon consulting the same table it will be noticed that S. 0 - :M, 0 , and so the age of the phase inequality, is negative for Arendal, Oscarsborg, Christiania, and Copenhagen.

By consulting the chart of soundings, Fig. 19, Part IV A, it will be seen that a broad strait exists on either side of Iceland. Now, if a wa\'e of uniform range were progressing northerly up the northern Atlantic Ocean it would be reasonable to expect to find a wave transmitted northward through both of these straits. But upon referring to Fig. 23, Part IV A, it will be seen that the strait between Greenland and Iceland is at the loop of the stationary oscillation while the strait between Iceland and the Faroe Islands is much nearer to the nodal line. Hence, the waye transmitted through Denmark Strait being of much greater amplitude than that \Yhich would be transmitted through the other strait, it is easily seen that it might proceed along the northern coast and govern the tides to the northeast of Icelahd. As a matter of fact the tides in this last-mentioned region are almost opposite in phase to those just south of the strait. Consequently, § 35, Part IV A, the oscillation in this strait must be chiefly stationary. However, there is some southward progression down the eastern coast of Iceland and some northward progression up the western coast of the Faroe Islands, the direction in the first case being governed by the preceding motion along the northern coast of Iceland and in the latter by the fact that the range north of the Faroe Islands is smaller than the range south of them, so that these islands form a part of a boundary, along the southern side of which is a good rise aud fall. Again referring to the chart of soundings and to the chart of systems, it becomes evident that the range of tide for the western coast of the Faroe Islands must considerably exceed that of the eastern. Observations indicate about 7 3-6 feet for the former and 4}6 for the latter. The motion thus set up causes the hours to progress southerly down the eastern coast of these islands; that is, the wave is turned or refracted, as it were, around the northern end of the islands because of the shoals and deeper off-lying waters. The oscillation in the strait between the Faroe and Shetland islands is, in deep water, nearly stationary, since the waters to the southwest of it are nearly opposite in phase to the waters to the north. However, along the northern coast of Scotland and the western coasts of the Orkney and Shetland islands the tide consists chiefly of a wave progressing northeasterly at about the rate due to depth. The short length of the walls or sides of these two broad straits makes the effect of the earth's rotation, if sensible at all, of secondary importance. Between Rockall and Labrador there is a considerable progression, due chiefly to the opening between soutl~ern Greenland and Labrador.

The range of tide at N ennortalik, near Cape Farewell, is 6. 3 feet and at St. Johns, 2.6; for the coast of Labrador it is 4 or s feet. These values indicate something about the position of the no-tide point. The tide in Hudson Strait is unexpectedly large. The range at Port Burwell near the eastern end being 15. 1 feet; at Ashe Inlet, Big Island, 23.5 feet, and at Port Laperriere, Digges Island, at the western end of the strait, 6.6 feet. The lateness of the tide on the southeastern shore of Ungava Bay has been explained in§ 7. In the northern branch of Hudson Strait, constituting the southern portion of Fox Channel, the range is large, being 9.5 feet at Winter Island. , The cotidal lines of Hudson Bay, as shown in Fig. 12, are little more than conjecture. The lack of reliable observations for the southeastern portion of the bay, and the uncertainties connected with the geography of Southampton and neighboring islands, cause inferences to be of little value. The range of tide is probably about 3 feet on the eastern side of the bay and more than twice that amount 011 the western. It may be well to here point out some evidence which goes to prove that the northwestern corner of the North Atlantic Ocean, together with its tidal dependencies, belongs to the North Atlantic system. Upon referring to Fig. 23, Part IV A, it will be see11 that the loop off Gibraltar is not overlapped by any other system, and that the same is true of the loop between Labrador and Iceland. Hence the JIIagnitude of the phase inequality, as well as its age, should be comparable at the two ends of this area. That such is the case can be seen by comparing the values S)M,, S, 0 -M, 0 for Nos. 6-28 of the table given under § 97, Part IV A, with similar values for Nos. 932-990 of the same table. As has been already noted, the ratio S / M. is much smaller for the coast exte11ding from Nova Scotia to Florida Strait, showi11g that the tides of this coast belong to a different system.

CHAPTER VII.
THE SEMIDIURNAL TIDES IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN.

46. Indications

of land near tlze pole.

Before attempting to draw cotidal lines for the Arctic regions, some assumptions have to be made as to the distribution of land and water; but in making such· assumptions observations upon the tides and surface drifts form the principal guides, as the matter which follows will show. By considering this question in detail, an estimate can be made of the relative merits of the cotidal lines as drawn for different parts of the Arctic Ocean. Except for slight alterations, the remainder of this section is as it recently appeared in the Nati on al Geographic Magazine.* It is a well-established fact that there are two important surface currents (or drifts) in the Arctic Ocean. One of these flows easterly along the northern coast of Alaska, through the Arctic Archipelago, finally reaching the Atlantic Ocean through Davis and Hudson straits. The other starts in the neighborhood of Herald Island, northwesterly from Bering Strait, and thence flows northwesterly, passing to the north of New Siberia; thence to the north of Franz Josef Land and the Spitzbergen Islands, and through Denmark Strait to and around Cape Farewell. Therefore these currents are near together when north of Bering Strait and again when in the vicinity of southern Greenfand. Some evidence of the American current may be cited. The ships Advance and Rescue, of the first Grinnell expedition, were for awhile carried northerly in Wellington Channel by the drifting ice; but when near the northern end of the channel the current reversed, and thereafter they were carried southerly and easterly through Barrow Strait, Lancaster Sounu, Baffin Bay, and Davis Strait, to latitude 65° 30' N., where they got themselves free from the ice. The. amount of southeasterly drifting measures about x ooo nautical miles, and required a little more than six months, extending from N ovember, 1850, to June, 1851. This gives an average rate of 5 miles per day. In May, 1854, the British ships Intrepid and Resolute were abandoned off the western end of Barrow Strait. The Resolute was picked up off Cape Mercy, in the south end of Davis Strait, in September, 1855. During these 16 months l 100 miles were covered, making an average rate of 2 0 miles per day. Strong easterly currents are encountered in Fury and Hecla Strait and in Bellot Strait. Northeasterly currents off the northwestern coast of Alaska have been noted by Captain Collinson, t and easterly currents along the northern coast by Captain McClure. t

Collinson noted an eastern set in Dease Strait far to the east,* and McClure found a large quantity of American pine, almost certainly from the Mackenzie River, drifted into Prince of Wales Strait."i" McClure Strait is constantly filled with ice, probably coming in chiefly from the west. The existence of the current far to the north of Russia is pretty well established by the drifting of the steamship Jeamzette from Herald Island to a point northeast of New Siberia, where she was.crushed in the ice, and by the subsequent drifting of some papers and clothing from the sunken vessel across the polar sea to J ulianehaab, near Cape Farewell. TheJeamzettewasfrozen in the ice September 6, 1879, and was crushed June l 2, l 88 l, having made good a distance of 600 miles. During the last five of these 2 l months much more than half of all the distance made good was covered, and during the last 26 days almost one-sixth. The relics were picked up in 1884, or three years after the sinking of the boat, having gone a distance of at least 2 900 miles. (See Fig. 24.) Before undertaking his famous voyage in the Fram, Nansen adduced, as further evidence of this current, the finding on the coast of Greenland of an implement which almost certainly came from the Alaskan Eskimos in the vicinity of Bering Strait; also the prevalence of driftwood on the Greenland coasts and the north coast of the Spitzbergen Islands, the species indicating that a large portion of this wood came from northern Siberia. The voyage of the Fram verified his previous calculations in a remarkable manner. That vessel became fast in the ice at a point northwesterly from New Siberia, September 22, 1893. It thence drifted to a point north of the Spitzbergen Islands, having passed about midway between Franz Josef Land and the North Pole. It was released from the ice June 14, 1896, thus having drifted for 33 months, the distance made good being 900 miles. At the beginning of the drifting the rate of the current was a little n1ore than half a mile per day, and increased to l mile near the end. Having established the existence of these two prevailing surface currents, and noting that both eventually flow to southern Greenland, the question arises as to why the Jeamzet/e did not drift almost due north instead of bearing off to the west. The Fra11Z went almost directly toward the eastern coast of Greenland. It is true that after the loss of the Jeannette Commander De Long and his party found themselves on ice drifting rapidly northward. As already noted, the last 26 days' drifting of tbe boat covered abont one-sixth of the entire distance. These facts suggest a broad strait north of Bennett Island, beyond which is the corner of a large tract of land dividing the deep Arctic channel traversed by the Fra1ll from the shallow sea through which the Jeannette drifted. The final accelerated rate and northward direction of De Long's drift seem to indicate proximity to this strait. This sea extends from Bennett Island to Banks Land. It is about 30 or 40 fathoms deep along the track of the Jeannette, and perhaps from 100 to 200 fathoms west of Banks Land, where it is known as Beaufort Sea. That land probably extends to the north of Beaufort Sea can be inferred from the fact that the ice found here is very old, the sea seeming to have no broad outlet through wl...ich the ice can escape, as it does north of Siberia. The openings to the east are long

and rather narrow channels. This does not argue against a tolerably broad expanse of water extending westward, for the currents setting eastward pre\·ent the ice from escaping to the west. It seems probable that land, continuous or nearly so, must extend far westward from off Banks Land, for this supposed land and the eastward currents might well explain why it is that the ·ice never recedes far northward from the northern coast of Alaska nor westward from Banks Land. Osborn thus speaks of the ice encountered by McClure in Beaufort Sea: "Ice of stupendous thickness and in extensive floes, some 7 or 8 miles in extent, was seen 011 either hand; the surface of it not flat, such as we see in Baffins Strait and the adjacent seas, but rugged with the accumulated snow, frost, and thaws of centuries.''* Such are the arguments for the existence of a tract of land extending from near the northwest corner of Banks Land, or from Prince Patrick Island, to a point north of New Siberia, based upon the drifting of the ice 011 the one hand and upon its age and comparatively slight movement on the other hand. Let us next consider what are the indications from the tides. In the first place, the tide at Point Barrow is semidiurnal in character, with a mean range of 0.4 foot, the flood coming from the west. This can not come through Bering Strait, because the ...tide immediately south of the strait has scarcely one foot range, with a large diurnal inequality, and at a short distance north of the strait, at Pitlekaj, where the Vt;i;a wintered in 1878-79, the range of the semidiurnal tide was carefully measured and found to be only o. 2 foot. \Vhence comes the Point Barrow tide? It can not come from the north or east, because all observers agree that the flood comes from the west, and that it is high water on the western side of the point considerably earlier than on the eastern. -j- De Long's party made careful observations upon the tide at Bennett _Island, and these show a range of 2 feet. Such a range, diminished by the broadening of the shallow sea to the east of this island, might well be reduced to that found at Point Barrow, provided one considers that the range generally diminishes off headlands and capes. On the ot!Jer hand, if no land exists north of Point Barrow, how can the tide there be much less than that found at Bennett Island, and how can the flood come from the west? For practically all of the Arctic Ocean tide is derived from the Atlantic, chiefly through the Greenland Sea, and without land near the Pole one of these stations would be reached about as well as the other. The reasons for not drawing the boundary straight from the Bennett Island corner to the Banks Land corner, but deflecting it to the south, are, first, the apparent necessity for such a bend in order that the direction of the flood may better accord \\'ith observation, and that the times of the tides of northern Alaska may be consistent with those at Bennett Island, and, second, the small north-and-south movement of the ice north of Alaska indicating that the sea is here probably narrower than it is farther west, or north of Siberia. In the extreme north this land can not extend much beyond the Pole toward Franz Josef Land, because this would undoubtedly have there caused a bend in the track of

the Franz's drift. Furthermore, the undiminished range of tide at Bennett Island perhaps indicates that the Nansen channel does not greatly broaden at the Pole. Between this supposed land and the islands recently discovered by Sverdrup may be other islands, forming a continuation of the Arctic Archipelago and separated from one another by channels of moderate depths, or perhaps this land appro,aches the Garfield Coast and Grant Land. At any rate, the range of tide diminishes from 2 feet at Cape Sheridan to 116 feet at Northumberland Sound, Penny Strait, and Lockwood and Brainard judged the tide to be small at Greely Fiord. These indicate that the· access of the tide from the north is not altogether unrestricted; in fact, part of the tide at Northumberland Sound comes from the east through Belcher Channel. We come now to another question. A few tides have been observed along the northern coast of Alaska by the explorer Thomas Simpson.* They show that the tide on the outer coast occurs nearly simultaneously from Point Barrow to Camden Bay and Siinpson Cove. But as the international boundary line is approached a great change takes place; the tide at Demarcation Point, not 100 miles farther east, is about seven hours later in its time of occurrence. Observations are not sufficient for showing how this change takes place, but it certainly occurs. A few tides in Mackenzie Bay and eastward were observed by Captain Richardsont and Commander Pullen. t The set of · th~ flood along the outer coast is given as easterly for all points where it has been observed from Point Barrow to and beyond Cape Bathurst; but such observations are very meager, probably on account of the smallness of the tide. This would seem to preclude the possibility of the principal part of the tide coming from the north or east; hence the probable approach of the polar land to Banks Land, or to Prince Patrick Islanc~, or to Grant Land. · Suppose an island about 100 miles in diameter to be separated from the coast by a shallow strait about 75 miles wide in its narrowest part. By assuming that deeper water exists to the west of the strait and island, and that the tide comes from the west, it seems possible to account for the sudden change in the time of tide; for the main wave, going north of the island, would control the time of the tide to the northeast of it, and deep water west of the island and shallow strait would cause the tide at Camden Bay and westward to occur remarkably early, just as if this coast were at the head of a deep, suddenly terminated canal extending northwesterly.· Immediately eastward from this supposed strait both Simpson§ and McClurell found that the waves became more like those upon a sea of some magnitude, and the latter, sailing a little north of east, found the depths to rapidly increase from 9 to 32 fathoms, and soon to 195 with no bottom. Now the question is, Why this more sea-like appearance unless some huge obstruction lies immediately to the west? It may, of course, be partly due to the open water caused by the influx of the Mackenzie.

It will be of interest to note that several Arctic authorities have at various times suspected or inferred the existence of land near the Pole. Richardson says:
The Eskimos of Point Barrow have a tradition, reported by Mr. Simpson, surgeon of the Ploz·t'r [in 1832], of some of their tribe having been carried to the north on ice broken up in a southerly gale, and arriving, after many nights, at a hilly country inhabited by people like themselves, speaking the Eskimo language, by whom they were well received. After a long stay, one spring in which the ice remained without movement they returned without mishap to their own country and reported their adventures. Other Eskimos have since then been carried away on the ice, and are supposed to have reached the northern land, from whence they have not as yet returned. An obscure imlication of land to the north was actually perceived from the masthead of the Plover when off Point Barrow.··

On August 15, 1850, Captain McClure, anchored off Yarborough Inlet, about half way from Point Barrow to Demarcation Point, writes;
The packed ice to-day, as far as the eye can reach, appears solid ancl heavy, without a drop of water discernible. The refraction has been considerable, gidng to the edge of the pack the appearance of a continuous line of chalk cliffs, from 40 to 50 feet in height. From the light shady tint, which, in different parl~ of the pack, is distinctly \ isible, 1 should be inclined to think that there may be many of the same kind of islands as those we ha,·e met with, extending to the northward, and impeding the progress of the ice, thereby keeping this sea eternally frozen.t

Captain Collinson, who wintered at Simpson Co\·e, 1853-54, actually undertook a sledge journey, in the spring, northward, one object of which was to see if land would not be reached. The roughness of the ice caused him soon to abandon the project. He writes:
I therefore returned, and with sorrow gave up an attempt which * * * I had looked forward to with much interest; thinking that, with anything like a favorable road, I should reach 73° north latitude, and settle the question with regard to the open sea, which certainly docs not appear to exist here in the same manner as it does to the north of the Asiatic continent. t

In 187 3 Admiral Sherard Osborn read a paper before the Royal Geographical Society, in which he predicted the existence of an archipelago or land extending from near Prince Patrick Island up very near to the Pole and thence to Wrangell Island, thus forming the northern boundary of a nearly inclosed sea.§ A probably less happy prediction was made by Petermann, who contemplated land extending northeasterly from Greenland, thence across the Pole to Wrangell Island. Sir Clements Markham is quoted as having said, in November, 1896;
Personally, as I do not believe in any land near the Pole, or on this side of it beyond Franz Josef Land, I trust an attempt will be made to explore another portion of the Arctic regions. I believe there is land, probably in the fonn of large islands, between Prince Patrick Land and the New Siberia Islands.II

Prentiss discredits there being much land north of Bering Strait, but his reasons for so doing can hardly be regarded as convincing. The following quotation is from a paper by Marcus Baker, in volume 5 of the National Geographic Magazine, entitled "An Undiscovered Island off the Northern

Coast of Alaska.'' He sugge~ts that the supposed laud be called Keenan Island. The following statements are there furnished by Capt. Edward P. Herendeen, who for many years was engaged in whaling:
It is often told that natives wintering between Harrison and Camden bays have seen land to the north in the bright, clear days of spring. In the winter of 1886-87, Uzharlu, an enterprising Eskimo of Ootkeavie, was very anxious for me to get some captain to take him the following summer, with his family, canoe, and outfit, to the northeast as far as the ship went, and then he would try to find this mysterious land of which he had heard so much; but no one cared to bother with this venturesome Eskimo explorer. So confident was this man of the truth of these reports that he was eager to sail away into the unknown, like another Columbus, in search of an Eskimo paradise. The only report of land having been seen by civilized man in this vicinity was made by Capt. John Keenan, of Troy, N. Y., in the seventies. He was at that time in command of the whaling bark Stambottl, of New Bedford. Captain Keenan said that after taking several whales the weather became thick, and he stood to the north under easy sail, and was busily engaged in trying out and stowing down the oil taken. \Vhen the fog cleared off, land was distinctly seen to the north by him and all the men of his crew; but, as he was not on a voyage of discovery and there were no whales i.n sight, he was obliged to give the order to keep away to the south in search of them. The. success of his voyage depended on keeping among whales. The fact was often discussed among the whalemen on the return of the fleet to San Francisco in the fall. The position of Captain Keenan's ship at the time land was seen has passed from my mind, except that it was between Harrison and Camden bays.

It will be noticed that these statements would ~lace the island a little to west of the position shown in Fig. 24.*

47. Character of Arctic tides.
An inspection of the tidal forces (Fig. 1, Part IV A) shows that the semidiurnal equilibrium tide, even if possible, would be very small, because the forces vanish at the pole. Again, the dimensions are probably such that no free period of the tide is approached. For these reasons the· semidiurnal tide observed in the Arctics must be almost entirely derived from other waters. The cotid11l lines indicate that nearly all of the disturbance producing the Arctic tides acts through the waters of Greenland Sea. The small mean range of tide ( o. 2 foot at Pitlekaj) and the smallness of the diunw 1 wave at Point Barrow show that the influence of the Pacific extends but a very sh.ort di~. tance northward from Bering Strait. The shallowness of Barents Sea prevents its inflnence as a channel of transmission from being of much consequence to the east of Franz Josef Land and Nova Zembla. In fact, it is probable that the tide!-1 around nortllc;·:1 Nova Zembla are derived from the wave north of Franz Josef Land. (See ·Figs. 23. ;:5. 1 The northern half of the North Atlantic system (e. g., western Europe a::1i southern Greenland and Iceland) possesses a good phase inequality which has an ''age·' generally of about 30 hours along the outer coasts. In the Arctic the phase ineqtl'.liity is of a similar character, with an age varying from 30 to 60 hours. t The tropic range of the diurnal wave is about 2 feet for the Arctic Archipelago, diminishing toward the west, and about 0.3 foot for Franz Josef Land and Bennett Island, and scarcely 0.2 foot for Point Barrow.

48. Greenland Sea branch.

From the north end of the North Atlantic system where the range is large (the mean range at Reikiavik being ro feet) the disturbance acts through Denmark Strait. A smaller disturbance comes chiefly from the loop off Portugal, passing up the outer coast of Ireland, Scotland, and Norway. The result is that the tide is about simultaneous over the deep Greenland Sea, having a range at Jan Mayen of 3 feet. The tide proceeds from this sea toward the Lena Delta, probably at a rate due to depth. The mean range is 2.0 feet at Cape Sheridan and at the southern part of Bennett Island. Northeastern Franz Josef Land is a turning point of the tide and beyond which the sea suddenly widens; the range of tide at Teplitz Bay is only r .o foot. The tide is of about this magnitude on the southern coast (at Cape Flora) probably because the wave passing between Norway and the Spitzbergen Islands is reduced in amplitude in the northern part of the somewhat expanded Barents Sea. From Bennett Island toward Alaska the wave proceeds at about the rate due to depth, the range diminishing because of the breadth and shallowness of the intervening waters. Judging from the few tidal observations made along the northern coast of Alaska_ and eastward, aud which have already been referred to, the tide appears to progress in an easterly direction somewhat as shown in Fig. 26. If the assumption of a hypothetical island separated from Manning Point by a shallow strait is correct, it is probable that nearly all of the tide between Cape Bathurst and Dolphin and Union Strait-, is due to the wave passing north of the island. At Coronation Gulf the semidiurnal tide practically disappears. At Cambridge Bay, Dease Strait, the tide is felt and doubtless comes from the east.* The flood in Prince of \Vales Strait has the appearance of setting northeasterly. 'f Having traced ·the tide from Greenland Sea to where it disappears at Coronation Gulf, it will now be well to note that one branch of probably considerable width passes north of Greenland, causing a tide of 2.0 feet at Cape Sheridan, the same wave going southwesterly produces the rather small tides at Greely Fiord, the western coast of Ellesmere Land, and among the islands to the west. The range of tide at Northumberland Sound is r.5 feet, a part of which doubtless comes from Jones Sound through Belcher Channel. Another branch from the main channel passes around the northeastern corner of Franz Josef Land, producing tides in the Yenisei Gulf, Gulf of Ob and the Kara Sea, the tide being in general small, probably about r foot on the outer coasts, but less up the gulfs and rivers. The tides of the White Sea are worthy of note. At th1: southern end of the entrance the time of tide changes rapidly-from IX to XII-in a very short distance. The north side of the sea is much deeper than are the gulfs of Archangel and Onega on the south side; the tide in the former locality is nearly simultaneous, but there is progression in the gulfs. The range of tide is probably about 3 or 4 feet. A great crowding together of the cotidal lines appears to occur in the strait between Kolgoniev Island and Kanin Peninsula.

It is probable that the small tide in the Gulf of Ob progresses at the rate due to depth. No tidal data for the coast of Siberia, extending from the Yenisei Gulf to Pitlekaj, is available, and so the cotidal lines for this coast are only conjectural.
49. Baffin Ba)' branch.

We come now to the Baffin Bay branch of the Arctic tides. This covers much less area than does the Greenland Sea branch, but the amount of the rise and fall is in general much greater. The waters south of Davis Strait, in Davis Strait, and in Baffin Bay are characterized by a stationary wave, but everywhere there is a considerable rise and fall. The cotidal lines are crowded together in the northern portion of the strait and spread apart in the northern portion of Baffin Bay. A stationary strait wave exists in Robeson and Kennedy channels, Kane Basin being the body of greater range and Lincoln Sea the body of smaller range. The mean range for Kane Basin is nearly 8 feet, for Fort Conger 4.3 feet, and for Cape Sheridan 2.0 feet. The fact that the tide at Cape Sheridan occurs about 1 ~ hours earlier than at Kane Basin proves that the tide of Lincoln Sea comes from the north. The known tides of this locality gave strong evidence in favor of Greenland being an island some years before that fact was practically established by Lieutenant Peary.* The Greenwich time of· tide for Kane Basin is a little more than III, the cotidal hours increasing toward this body both from the south and from the north. The range of tide at Cumberland Sound is unexpectedly large, the mean value being 15.9 feet for Kingua Ford and 14.7 feet for Ananito Harbor. The tide progressing up Lancaster Sound soon divides, one part going westerly through Barrow Strait, the other going southerly through Prince Regent Inlet. The former produces the tide in Wellington Channel, Melville Sound, Franklin Strait, McClintock Channel, James Ross Strait, Victoria Strait, Dease Strait, and probably Coronation Gulf; the latter, the tide in the Gulf of Boothia. The tides of Fox Channel are produced by the Hudson Strait tides. They appear to be amphidromic, so that the flood goes northward on the cast side and southward on the west. The cause is probably the sudden eastward trend of the coast of Fox Land at Capes Dorchester and Willoughby, which turns a wave of large amplitude toward the northeast. The geography is but imperfectly known on the east side of this channel, and no tides or depths have there been measured. In the straits of Fury and Hecla, t Bellot, t and Simpson§ the tidal streams are strong, because the tides at either end generally differ in range and in phase.

THE SEMIDIURNAL TIDES IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

5 l. Character

ef Pacific tides.
1

Upon referring to the chart of diurnal systems (Fig. 24 Part IV A) it will be seen that large diurnal tides can not originate in the South Pacific, and observations show that the diurnal inequality is comparatively small in these waters. The two systems for the semidiurnal tide have been described in §§ 74, 75, Part IV A. By referring to Fig. 6 it will be seen that there are three principal amphidromic regions, the positions of the no-tide points being taken as 30° 24' N., 141° 25' W.; 14° 7}6' S., 153° 13' W.; and 51° 30' S., 172° ro' W. The first lies between California and Hawaii, at the intersection of two nodal Jines; the second, northwest of the Society Islands, near two nodal lines and a free boundary; the third, southeast of New Zealand, near a free boundary. Some progression is inherent in the overlapping of the systems, as has been pointed out in § 15. This applies to the first amphidromic region mentioned, especially to the coast of Lower and Upper California, and also to the second. But openings in the coast line have a widely spread influence. Important openings are between C'ape Horn and the South Shetland Islands; between the Peninsula -0f Alaska and Kamchatka; through the Kuril Islands; between Japan and Formosa; between Formosa and Luzon; through the Sulu Archipelago; between New Zealand and Australia. The shoaling found to the north and northwest of New Zealand, together with !he Fiji and neighboring islands and North Island, New Zealand, form an imperfect boundary which gi\·es rise to westerly and southwesterly progressions. The central portion of the American coast line is farthest removed from openings of this description. Hence it is not surprising to find no progression toward the waters off Panama and Colombia, and very little up the Bay of Panama. We find what would be expected, viz., small progressions outward from the vicinity of the Galapagos Islands. The following are localities .of rapid change of time of tide, due to the fact that , regions ha\'ing good ranges but different times of tide lie near each other: Coast of Peru, connecting the Panama loop to the loop at Chile; western coast of southern Chile, connecting the loop at Chile with the Cape Horn loop; straits through the Aleutian Islands, connecting the northern Pacific and Bering Sea. (See lemma 25.) Owing to the great extent of the Pacific Ocean, the large number of islands, and the considerable variations in depth, it is not difficult to believe that forces of slightly different periods may be responded to by modes of oscillation quite different in some cases. The land boundaries here are not sufficient for necessitating one particular mode

391

of oscillation· for both the lunar and solar forces; there are many chances for the portions of the sea best responding to the lunar forces to annex or discard neighboring masses of water which islands and shoals may partially define. (See § 47, Part IV A.) Hence we can not generally infer by the equality of S)M. or S 0 °-M~ at two distant loops that the loops form or do not form parts of the same system. Of course between neighboring places either of these quantities will generally vary but little. The ratio s. M. for the Pacific is, as a rule, less than the corresponding ratio of the forces. The cases where it is greater, like Tahiti* and Mazatlan, are so near the nodal lines that they little affect the generality of this rule; they simply indicate that the modes of the solar oscillation do not exactly agree with those of the lunar, and so at the nodal line of the lunar tide there might exist a sensible solar tide. Even Japan is too near to a nodal line for having the fact that S)M. there approaches its theoretical value seriously affect the generality of the rule. On the other hand, the ratio s.'M. is unusually small at Wellington, Port Russell, anq Port Chalmers, New·Zealand, a)ld even at Apia, Samoan Islands.

52. From the Galapagos Islands to Cape Horn.

The change of tidal hour from the Panama loop to the Chile loop, and thence to the Cape Horn loop, has been noted in the preceding section. But the law of the change is influenced by the antecedent wave made necessary by the progression through the strait south of Cape Horn. (See Figs. 6, 27, 28, 30, 41.) In the deep water surrounding the Galapagos Islands the tidal hour is a trifle less than VIII, but amongst these islands it is a trifle more than VIII. The tidal hour changes rapidly along .the coast of Peru. In latitude about 28 °, on the Chilean coast, the time of tide appears to be about an hour earlier than in latitude 23 ° or 24 °. This anomaly is probably due to the directions taken by the tidal streams of the oscillation and the progressive wave, causing a dependent stationary wave at the first-mentioned locality; lemma 32, case 4. In latitude about 41° there is a crowding up of the cotidal lines at the coast. This is a species of turning point of the tide and is to be regarded as analogous to a cape guarding the entrance to a broad bay; lemma 28. The direction of the tidal streams-say loo or more miles offshore-are, at this latitude, probably nearly parallel to the shore instead of being normal to it, as an early tide requires. ·The crowding up of the cotidal lines near the western end of Magellan Strait is explained in a similar way. In Corcovado Gulf is a dependent stationary wave having a 12 or 13 foot range at the head. This produces strong currents (4 to 5 knots) in Chacao Narrows. (Cf. ~ 106, 'Part IV A.) The range of tide is 3.0 feet at Valparaiso and 4.3 feet at Cape Horn. The axis of the southeastern half-wave length of the South Pacific system may be supposed to terminate in longitude 69° W. The theoretical tidal hour is VI at this Cape Horn loop. Now, superimpose upon this stationary wave an easterly progressing wave of equal amplitude and whose tidal hour is VIII t at longitude 69° W. (§ 3); the result will be the irregular progression shown in Fig. 6 along the axis of the area. Here A. is taken as 84 ° of a great circle. ------·-· '

53. From Cape /lorn to Urug·uay. Upon referring to the chart of semidiurnal systems (Fig,_ 23, P~rt IV A), it will be seen that a loop of the South Pacific system has southern c;'.hile and. 9raham Land for its eastern boundary. The intervening strait, const_ituti1~~ an openiu~ ip thi_s boundary,. causes a large wave to progress into the Atlantic. Fig. 29 shows th.at the disturbance thus transmitted. produces the tide on the eastern coast of South America up to and including the tide in the Rio de la Plata. North of this river the tide becomes Yery small, especially at Rio Grande do Sul, and a cro·,yding together of the cotidal lines is there necessitated in order to coalesce with the Brazilian tide due to the South Atlantic system. The tide occurs earlier on the southeastern coast of the Falkland Islands than elsewhere in this group. One branch of the tide swings around to the north, going rapidly in the deep water northeast of the islands. The other branch appears to progress slowly along the south coast. In reality this rapid change in the tidal hour is due to the fact that the times are here governed by the large tides between Staten Island and Port Santa Cruz. (See~ 14.) The two branches are united into one off the western extremity of'°the group. The tide enters Falkland Sound from both ends and meets near the center. For most of the inland water between \Vest Falkland Island and Pebble Island the tide progresses easterly, the larger opening being to the west. Three stationary waves, existing because the resultant flood is in certain localities largely directed shoreward, occur along the eastern coast of Patagonia. The head of the first extends from Magellan Strait to Port Santa Cruz. The length (to the 100-fathom line) may he considered as being close to){ A., and therefore favorable to the production of large tides. The second includes the Gulf of St. George, with off-lying shallow water; its length lies between ~ A. and ~ A.. The third includes the Gulf of San Matias and immediate approach; its length lies between o and ~ A., but nearer to ~ A.. The tide in the first is caused by the tide between the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego. The shore line receding at Port Santa Cruz a progressi\·e wave moves northward (lemma 19 ). This combines with a wave coming from the east, causing the tide which sustains the stationary oscillation in the Gulf of St. George. At Cabo del Sur, marking the northern limit of this gulf, the receding shore line gives a northward progressive wave. On account of the early arrival of the wave coming from the east, the resultant tide must change its tidal hour rapidly between this cape and Delagada Point, Valdes Peninsula. Similarly, the tide east of this peninsula sustains a large oscillation in the Gulf of San Matias and Port San Jose. Hence the greater range of tide on the north side of the peninsula and its connecting isthmus. At Point Raza the shore line suddenly recedes, giving rise to a northerly progression, which follo~vs the shore line around El Rincon until it meets the wave coming from the southeast. Thus we see the necessity for two wave eddies such as have been referred to in the latter part of § r 3. It is probable that § 5 may be of some assistance in explaining them. The positions assigned to the no-tide points are 45 ° 18' S., 63 ° 37' W., and 40° 55' s., 600 45' v..T. The tide in the Rio de la Plata is a progressive wave, advancing at about the rate due to depth. Although this estuary is funnel-shaped and of decreasing depth, the

irregular shoals so impede the progress of the wave that the range of tide remains about constant. It is 2 feet at Montevideo and 1.8 feet at Buenos Ayres. Here the tide occurs eleven hours later than in the deep water off the mouth of the ri\'er. The range of tide in the eastern portion of Magellan Strait is about 30 feet; after passing the first narrows it is about i6 feet, and in Broad Beach, beyond the second narrows, 4 feet. The tidal streams in these narrows are strong and due to hydrau:lic effects, §§ 9, 105, Part IV A. The tidal hour increases southward and westward. The hour increases from Froward Reach to Cockburn Channel along either end of Clarence Island and coalesces with that of the tide which progresses eastward through the strait between Cape Horn and Graham Land, thus completing a cycle ·of values. The branch of the tide which follows the strait proper from Froward Reach westward meets the tide from the west near the eastern end of Desolation Island. One branch of the tide from Froward Reach produces the tide in Otway Water.
54. From t!te Galapagos Islands to Britis!t Colunibia.

The Panama loop of the North Pacific system, marked IX in Fig. 23, Part IV A, is made possible by the fact that the trapezoidal branch of this system has a loop not far away also marked IX. Hence by the latter part of lemma 25 the tidal hour for the intervening waters should be IX. The Panama loop may, therefore, he described as having a large portio11 of its southern boundary latent (§ 29, Part IV A). Only at th~ extreme eastern end is there a rigid southern hotmdary. Observations indicate VIII instead of IX for the tidal hour of this loop. (See Fig. 30.) This discrepancy is probably clue to the progressions (antecedent waves) setting out from this loop both southerly and northerly. Some inward progression occurs in the gulfs along this coast. How the tide is delayed at the mouth of a bay. and how the far side of the mouth of a bay is sometimes reached as early as the near side have been explained under lemma 31, cases 3, 4. The nodal line terminating just above Acapulco is remarkably well defined both by the small range and remarkably sudden change in the tidal hour. The tide in the Gulf of California is chiefly stationary, although there is enough inward progression to prevent there being a no-tide point from which the cotidal lines would radiate. On account of the low latitude and the obstructions due to islands, the effect of the earth's rotation in crowding together the lines on the Lower California side and spreadini:; them apart on the opposite side is probably less marked than in the. case of the English or Irish Channel. 'l'he range of tide at Mazatlan is 2 .6 feet au cl at the head of the Gulf about 20 feet. Strong tidal currents due to hydraulic effects(§ 106, Part IV A) occur between Tiburon Island and the mainland. The progression along both Lower and Upper California is due to the overlapping of the two Pacific systems (§ 15). The curved nodal line of the North Pacific system terminating at Point Arguello is obscured by a loop of the South Pacific system. From this cape northward to Alaska, the range of tide increases. It is 3.6 feet at Point Arguello and 7. 7 feet at Sitka. Ranges varying from IO to 15 feet are usual for the inner waters of Alaska. (See Figs. 32, 33. )

394

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

The Gulf of Geo:rgia, including the Juan de Fuca Strait, has a large. stationary wave whose nodal line is near Discovery Island Light. There is, however, some progression, so that the influence of the earth's rotation is to cause the cotidal lines to crowd together. at the Vancouver end and to spread apart on the Washington side, where, as is usual in such cases, the range of tide is considerable. The tide entering Queen Charlotte Sound reaches the vicinity of Discovery Passage several hours before the time of tide in the upper end of the Gulf of Georgia. The range of tide in the first locality is somewhat larger than the range in the second. The hydraulic effect is a current in Seymour Narrows of from 4 to 8 knots (§ ro6 and Fig. 32, Part IV A). Upon referring to the table given under § 97, Part IV A, Nos. 2 l 5-2 l 9, it will be seen that the ratio S/M, for Mazatlan and near-by stations in L<>wer California is larger than the ratio of the corresponding forces. For all other parts of the Pacific coast of America from Cape Horn to Bering Strait the tidal ratio is less than the ratio of the forces.

55. Alaska and Bering Sea.
The north angle of the large triangle forming the greater part of the North Pacific system is bounded for a considerable distance by the coast of Alaska. Iu § 74, Part IV A, it was pointed out that the range of tide should here be large and that its theoretical hour should be not far from IX. Upon referring to the charts of cotidal lines, Figs. 31, 33, we see this to be the case. The chart covering lower Alaska, Fig. 33, shows that the tides in the numerous canals seldom occur more than half an hour later than do the tides outside. The range, however, is considerably increased. These facts show that the tide in these canals consists largely of a stationary wave a moderately small fraction of a wave length long. (See also§ 91 and Fig. 32, Part IV A.) The small difference in both time and range of tide throughout these canals and straits prevents the tidal streams from becoming as violent as the large range of tide and the peculiar formation of the coast might indicate. But hydraulic effects are not altogether wanting; in Clarence Strait, northeast of Prince of Wales Island (Fig. 33, Part IV A) the tidal current is 5 knots. Strong currents are likewise found in Sergius Narrows, Peril Strait. Throughout most of the canals and straits tolerably strong currents are necessitated for carrying. in and out the large tidal volumes. The large tides in Cook Inlet probably indicate that the virtual length of this body is about 7-( A.. The diminution of range of the Pacific tides experienced in going west from the Gulf of Alaska indicates the existence of a nodal line farther on. But the Bering and Okhotsk seas are bodies of water which permit extensive progressions, and so it is not strange to find an antecedent wave as far east as the Gulf of Alaska, and to find the nodal line off Rat Islands much obscured in consequence. · Tl~e tides of Bering Sea are derived from those of the Pacific. (See chart of soundings, Fig. 19, Part IV A, and chart of cotidal lines, Fig. 34, Part IV B.) The Gulf of Anadir, although shallow, is characterized by a stationary wave, and so by nearly simultaneous tides. Between St. Lawrence Island and Alaska the tidal hour changes rapidly and the range diminishes in going northeasterly through this st:·ait.

At the mouth of the Yukon River the range of tide is r.4 feet; 60 nautical miles up the river, the range is 0.4 foot. Norton Sound is an amphidromic region, the no-tide point being about Ji A. from the head of the sound. Without the deflecting force of the earth's rotation, this body of water would constitute a dependent fractional area with a nodal line running nearly north and south. But this deflecting force, on account of the narrowness of the sound, causes the water to pile up on the south side and to recede from the north side when the eastward motion across the nodal line prevails. The reverse is true for the westgoing stream. On account of the relatively large diurnal wave in Norton Sound there is generally but one high water per day when the moon is far from the equator. Around St. Lawrence Island the time of the tide probably assumes all values, asshown on the cotidal chart, but no observations for establishing this supposition are available. The range of tide is probably about I foot at the east end and somewhat greater at the w~st end. The range of tide in the deep water south of the Pribilof !Stands is about 2 feet; but the extensive shoaling and favorable configuration of the shore line cause the range to become 20 feet near the heads of the estuaries terminating Bristol Bay. There is undoubtedly considerable tide in Kuskokwim Bay. From the Peninsula of Alaska westward to Umnak Island are numerous passages leading from the Pacific to Bering Sea. Through these the time of tide changes rapidl~·. The tidal streams are swift, particularly in the narrow passes, and are, in the main, hydraulic effects (§ 106, Part IV A). The range of tide is much greater on the southern side of these islands than on the northern <>ide or in the passes.

The cotidal charts covering this region are Nos. 3 I, 35, 36. The progression for waters lying easterly and northerly from the no-tide point situated between California and Hawaii has just been explained as being due to the overlapping of systems in the one case and the broken northwestern boundary of the Pacific in the other. The question now arises as to what may produce a southerly progression for the waters lying to the west of this point. By referring to the chart of systems it will be seen that north of this point is a region marked IX and southsouthwest of it one marked XII. But XII or o combined with III, \vhich number covers a very wide region, gives an intermediate value, say IYz. We should therefore expect to find a change from IX to IYz for the western side of the amphidromic region, especially if there exists a favorable progressive wave in the vicinity of the nodal line west of the no-tide point. Such a ·wave is the antecedent wave moving toward the Fiji and New Hebrides Islands and involved in the progression caused by the shoaling and openings north and northwest of New Zealand, where the rise and fall of the South Pacific system is considerable (Fig. 20, Part IV A). It extends northeasterly to and even beyond the Hawaiian Islands, giving to the tides of all intervening waters a tendency to progress southwesterly. South of the no-tide point is a region over which the time of tide changes but little, that time being between IYz and II, which is, of course, intermediate between XII and III. In this region progrt!ssive waves, if felt at all, are small in comparrison with the resultant stationary wave.

West of the Hawaiian Islands a general westerly progression is apparent because of the small range of the stationary wave over the extensive region marked III on the chart of systems. This is caused in part by the antecedei1t wave jnst referred to, hut chiefly by similar waves entrained by the tides of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Yellow and China seas. In the western angle of the North Pacific triangle (between the Philippines and Guam) this progression is no longer apparent, partly because of the directions and limitations of ti1e antecedent waves and partly because the range of the stationary tide becomes great as the angle of the triangle is approached(§ 27, Part IV A).

57. From Kamchatka to Japan.
The tides at Petropaulovsk, although not different in character from the tides of British Columbia and Alaska, have some historic interest because they were observed as long ago as 1828 and found to possess a large diurnal inequality, especially in the low waters. Very little is known of the tides in the Sea of Okhotsk and comparatively few soundings have been made. The tide is probably large in gulfs of Jijiginsk and Penjinsk; the range for the western and northern shores of the sea is probably 7 or 8 feet. Upon referring to Fig. 23, Part IV A, it will be seen that a nodal line passes through the Caroline Islands just east of the Ladrone Islands and terminates off the eastern coast of Japan. On account of the progression up the Yellow Sea, and into the China Sea, it is probable that the northern end of this nodal line will be somewhat obscured by the antec~dent wave. However, Fig. 36 shows a sufficient crowding up of cotidal lines to prove the existence of a nodal line. The fact that the tide reacl1es the eastern coast of the Philippine Islands within less thaM an hour after the time it reaches Guam, and that the range in the former locality is several times greater than in the latter, shows clearly the existence of a nodal line and loop. Along the eastern coast of Japan to about the latitude of Tokyo the range of tide is about 2 feet. Going thence westerly along the coast the range continually increases, being 6.2 feet at Nagasaki. The tide, entering from the south, progresses up the Inland Sea as far as the most northern point of Sikok Island, where it is met by the tide from the northern entrance. The tidal hour changes rapidly from IXYz to I}lz and from X to IYz in the southern and northern straits, which connect this sea with the northern entrance, or Kii Channel. The tide reaches a point on the eastern coast of Kiusiu Island remarkably early for reasons given under lemma 32. The tide which progresses westerly through Bungo Channel coalesces with that of Korea Strait a short distance west of Simonoseki. The tides in the Sea of Japan are caused mainly by the disturbance acting through the Strait of Korea, where the cotidal lines are amphidromic. It is high water nearly simultaneously over the southern half of the sea, and this happens at about the time of low water for the southern end of the strait. The case is one of a tidal body producing tides in a nearly tideless sea. Hence § 35, Part IV A, the greatest inward velocity occurs three hours after high water at the south end of the strait. The extreme south end of the sea being narrow, the deflecting force of the earth's rotation causes it

to then be piled up along the Japanese coast, while it recedes from the Korean coast. The reverse occurs on the outgoing stream. The table given under § 97, Part IV A, and continued under § 19, Part IV B, shows great activity on the part of the Japanese in obser;ing and analyzing tides. The ratio S,' ::VI, has here generally about its theoretical value; but as the nodal line is not far away, the value of the ratio here can not be expected to compare closely with its value in other parts of the system. 58. Philippine Islands and C!tina. The cotidal chart of the Philippine Islands, Fig. 3 7, shows that the tidal hour for the Pacific coast of these islands is about IX Yz. The tide of the Celebes Sea is almost simultaneous with the tide east of the islands. The tide is delayed and its character somewhat altered in passing through the Sulu Archipelago into the Sulu Sea. In passing through the channel north of Luzon the tide is much retarded. Over the deeper portion of the China Sea the tide is nearly simultaneous and the range small. Somewhat similar instances to this are Denmark Channel and the basin extending then<::e to Spitzbergen, also the strait south of Cape Horn and the deep waters towards South Georgia and the Sandwich Group. As the tide enters the China Sea it is delayed at the coast of Luzon, lemma 28, and the cotidal line becomes nearly parallel to the western coast of Luzon and Palawan. Which part of the tide comes directly from the Pacific and the Celebes Sea and which part from the China Sea can be seen upon the map. It will be noticed that the tide ranges of Sul u Sea comes mainly from the south. By observing where bracketed occur, localities which at times have but one high water daily can be inferred. In the southern part of San Jacinto Strait the time of tide changes suddenly from XYz to II, and in San Bernardino Strait from IXYz to II. The tide passes up the Yellow Sea at nearly the rate due to depth. Between Shantung Promontory and Korea there is some crowding together of the cotidal lines. By lemma 28 the northern shore of Shantung Promontory should have very late tides, and observations at \Vei-hai-wei show that such is the case. (See also§ 14.) The wave advances northwesterly through the waters connecting the gulfs of Pechili and Liaotung, to the northwestern shore near the terminus of the Great \Vall. One branch passes northeasterly up the Liaotung Gulf; the other follows the western and southern shores of the Gulf of Pechili, finally coalescing with the incoming waves, thus forming a wave eddy (§ 13). The chart of cotidal lines (Fig. 36) shows the range to be generally large for the eastern coast of China, and especially for the western coast of Korea. The range at Wei-hai -wei is, however, only 4.5 feet. Some observations made upon the bore of the Tsien-tang Kiang are shown in Fig. 19, Part I.* Lemma 28 applies to the northern and southern ends of the island of Formosa, and the cotidal lines finally become parallel to the sides of Fom10sa Strait.

In passing up the Gulf of Tonkin the small semidiurnal tide from the China Sea becomes very small toward the head of the gulf, while the diurnal tide suffers no such diminution. The tide here is of historic interest, having been observed by Francis Davenport and discussed by Dr. Edmund Halley and Sir Isaac Newton.* From the deep portion of the China Sea an extensive progression extends to Singapore and to the Gulf of Siam. This gulf causes an increase in range as Bangkok is approached. t The progression to Singapore coalesces with that of the Strait of Malacca and continues southeasterly for a short distance along the coast of Sumatra. At Banca Island it turns east, and reaching Borneo turns northerly, finally coalescing with the incoming tide. This is a species of wave eddy, mentioned in§ 13, whose period requires 24 instead of 12 hours. It resembles the one occupying the greater part of the :North Sea. It is probable that for considerable' distance around the no-tide point the range of tide is very small. The tides of Gillolo Passage, Molucca Passage, and Macassar Strait are shown in Figs. 7, 36. They coalesce with the Pacific tides at the northern ends of the passes. In case of the first two some crowding up of the lines is required, w'lile the northern portion of Macassar Strait is characterized by simultaneous tides. (See§§ 35, 102, Part IV A.) By means of a large-scale chart of soundings the apparently irregular arrangement of the cotidal lines in the Banda and Java seas are easily accounted for, at least in a general way. The tide progresses westerly in the Java Sea because the range of the ocean tide upon which it depends is large near the loop and small near the node of the North Indian system.

The sequence of tidal hours around the no-tide point near the Society Islands can be obtained from the following considerat.ions: According to the loops of the oscillating systems (Fig. 23, Part IV A), east of the point the hour should be IX; north of the point it should be I and II; west of the point it should be VI; south of the point there should be little or no tide. The antecedent wave involved in the progression resulting from the shoals and openings north and northwest of New Zealand indicates that northwest of the no-tide point there is a progressive wave moving southwesterly. Southwest of the point is a sector over which there is little progression, as the tidal hours for the Samoan and the Hervey or Cook Islands go to show. South of this point the range of tide.is small, but an eastward progression is necessitated because the tidal hour for the Cook Islands is VI while for Rapa or Oparo Island it is IX~ and for Tahiti between X and X ~. East of the point there is a northward progression, as observation made in the Low Archipelago and on the. Marquesas Islands prove. Observations made on the Marquesas, Caroline, and Penrhyn islands prove a westerly progression to exist north of the no-tide point. :Northeast of the point, the change in tidal hour is yery slow, as might have been inferred from the chart of systems. All these considerations agree in
*See H 85, 88, Part I. t Since Fig. 36 was drawn, new constants for several places in Cochin China have become avail. able through the French colonial tide tables for the year 1904. They indicate that the tidat hours for Nha-trang and vicinity should be increased by an hour or more; also, that between Cambodia Point and Hatien the tide is much delayed in accordance with ~ 7.

giving an amphidromic region similar to the one shown in Fig. 38. The position of the no-tide point is quite accurately fixed by the ·known tides at Tahiti, and Tonga-reva or Penrhyn islands; at these two places the range is small, and when it is high water at the one it is almost low water at the other. It may be well to note that no observations appear to have been made for the central portion of the loop marked IX. The tides at Pitcairn, Hend~rson, and Ducie islands would probably be little influenced by those not belonging directly to the system. Between Easter Island and Sala-y-Gomez a rapid change takes place in the tidal hour. This crowding up of the cotidal lines is due to the proximity of a nodal line modified by the wave antecedent to the Cape Horn eastward progression. The Kermadec, New Hebrides,, Fiji, and Ellice islands all lie at or near the western loop of the South Pacific system. Their theoretical tidal hour is VI. However, the southwesterly progression started by the·imperfect character of the outer boundary of this loop has the effect of making the number of the hours increase southwesterly. The tide on the southwestern coast of New Caledonia occurs 2 hours later than on the northeastern. (~f. lemma 28.) In going westward from the Gilbert and Ellice islands to the northern coast of New Guinea t:he range of tide continually decreases, indicating approach to the nodal line which passes just east of the Ladrone Islands. The progression from the Marshall and Gilbert islands through the Solomon Islands, thence across the Coral Sea to the Australian coast, seems to be the result of two neighboring regions having tides at different hours. In the first region the tidal hour is about V and in the latter IX. Thus the tide in the Coral Sea comes from both the north and the east, the tide from the east being the controlling factor. The extreme shallowness of Torres Strait prevents the Pacific tide from exerting much influence on the tides in the Gulf of Carpentaria.
60. New Zealand and eastern coast of Australia.

The westward and southwestward progression resulting from the imperfect support of the western loop of the South· Pacific system constitutes the tides along the eastern coast of Australia and in the adjacent waters. One portion going southwesterly through the broad passage between New Zealand and Australia has the effect of producing, with the aid of the South Indian system and the XII loop of the South Pacific system, a region south of this passage over which the tides are nearly simultaneous. The progression extends completely around New Zealand, the portion found east of North Island being an antecedent wave. The tidal hours thus form a complete cycle of values (§ 14). The tidal hour at the south end of Cook Strait is IV~. The hour increases in going northward to X on the southern shore of North Island and to IX~ near Cape Farewell, where it meets the tide progressing clown the western coast of the islands. The range at the south end of the strait is considerably less than at the north end. The motion in the strait is largely a stationary oscillation. The maximum velocity occurs about 3 hours after the maximum surface slope through the strait. (Cf. §§ I 1, 35, 102, Part IV A.) In many parts of this strait there are strong tidal currents.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1904.

A no-tide point southeast of New Zealand appears to be required for the following reasons, although its exact location is, of course, doubtful: Observations show a sequence of hours, I to VI, to the west and northwest of the assumed point. To the north there must be a crowding together of cotidal lines because of the proximity to a nodal line. For the Chatham Islands the tidal hour is IV~ and for Rapa or Oparo, near the loop marked IX on the chart of semidiurnal systems, it is IX ,76, indicating that the tidal hour increases in going northeasterly from Chatham Islands. East of the point the theoretical considerations indicate th~t the tidal hour must be XII (Fig. 23, Part IV A). Hence the southeasterly increase from IX 76 to XII.' This change is probably helped along by the antecedent wave of the Cape Horn progression. To the south must be a wide sector of nearly simultaneous tide, because observations made at Auckland and Campbell islands, west of the point, give a tidal hour but little different from the theoretical tidal hour southeast of the point.

PRECISE LEVELIN.G FROM RED DESERT, WYOMING, TO OWYHEE, IDAHO.
By JOHN F. HAYFORD, Inspector of Geodetic Work; Assistant, Coast and Geodeti'c Survey.

This line was leveled in four sections, namely, from Red Desert to Azusa, Wyo., by Harold D. King, Aid, May 20-July 31, 1903; Ogden, Utah, to Azusa, Wyo., by Ralph L. Libby, Aid, May 2-July 31, 1903; Ogden, Utah, to Pocatello, Idaho, by Mr. Libby, August 5-September 28, 1903; and Pocatello to Owyhee, Idaho, by Mr. King, August 4--0ctober 24, 1903. The line follows the Union Pacific Railroad from Red Desert to Ogden, and the Oregon Short Line from, Ogden to Owyhee. This line is connected at its eastern end at Red Desert, Wyo., with the precise level net shown in Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903. "Precise Leveling in the United States, 19001903.'' It is expected that the extension of this line will connect with Pacific sea level at Seattle, Wash., and thus furnish the first connection by precise leveling between the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico on the one hand .and the Pacific on the other.
lNSTRUMaNTS AND

Rons.

Mr. Libby used precise level No. 8. Mr. King used precise level No. 7, except as noted below. Both these instruments are of the most recent type and are fully· described in Appendix 3 of the Repcirt for 1903, pages 200-211. On July 8 level No. 7 was accidently dropped from the railway bridge into Green River, at Greenriver, Wyo., and the telescope broken. Level No. 5 of the intermediate type described on page 418 of Appendix 8 of the Report for 1899, "Precise Leveling in the United States," was immediately sent from Washington to the -party and was used from July 17 to July 31 over the line from Greenriver to Azusa, Wyo. The value of a 2-millimeter division on the level vial of either instrument, No. 7 or No. 8, is slightly less than 2". The telescope of each of these instruments has a clear aperture of 4.2 centimeters and a focal length of 41 centimeters. Mr. King used rods T and U. Mr. Libby used rods R. and S. These rods are of the type described on pages 418-419 of Appendix 8. of the Report for 1899. The rods are of the direct reading type and carry a centimeter graduation on which readings are made to millimeters by estimation. The lengths of the 3-meter interval marked on each of the rods, by a fine graduation on metallic plugs in its face, as determined by the Bureau of Standards, before and after the field work, and reduced to o° Centigrade, are as follows:

COAST AND GEODb'TIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904-

Each rod was measured with a steel tape at least twice each month while in the field. The readi11g of the rod thermometer was always noted in connection with these measurements and care was taken that t):ie rods and tape should be at the .temperature of the. atmosphere ·~;o th.at· reliable comparisons could be made. These measurements were made in order to detect, if possible, any change in the lengths of the rods during the season. t'hey do not give the absolute lengths of the rods at any time, as the error of the tape with which the measurements were made is not known. The field measurements tabulated below i11dicate clearly that the change in length of rods T and U indicated. by the measurements at the Bureau of Standards took place at about the time Mr. King moved from Azusa, Wyo., to Pocatello, Idaho, August 1. These were well-seasoned rods which had been in use since 1899 and a change in length was unexpected .. These rods T and U were, in 1899, before being sent to the field for:the.first time, 3m+o111 m.7 and 3m+o"'m.4 long, respectively. As is frequently .~he case with such rods, made· of pine impregnated with paraffin, they increased in. length du.ring.the .first. &eason of use to 3m+1mm.5 and 3m+1mm.3, respec.t'iv:eiy .. ~They then remained.practically constant in length until the end of July, 1903, wheQ, as noted above, they shortened to a length about midway between their original leng,th and the constant length held in 1900-1902: In accordance with· the eddence of the field measurements of the rods, the comput~tion .was made for the line Red· Desert to Azusa, Wyo., by using the lengths as determiped at.the Bureau of Standards on May 13, 1903, and for the line Pocatello to Owyhee, ~daho, by using the lengths as determined on January 9, 1904, on the supposition that the change in length occurred while moving from one line to the other. For the first line the mean excess of length of the two rods at o 0 used in the computation was 0.47 millimeter per meter and itl the computation of the second line 0.31 millimeter per meter. Neither the field me~surements nor the Bureau of Standards' measurements indicated any change iii. the lengths of R, and S during the season. The computation was made with the niean exceSs fi;om the four measurements of the two rods as shown above, namely, 0.35 millimeter per meter. The total range in the field measutements of the 3-meter interval on rod R. was o.6 millimeter, and on rod S, o.8 millimeter, after rejecting one measurement in each case which was evidently in error. The index corrections for the rods, as determined at Washington before antl after the field work, were as follows, in millimeters: for rod T, -o.6 and rod U, -0.5 on April 29, 1903; for rod T,_-o.6 and rod U, -0.7 on January 15, 1904; for rod R,, -0.4 and rod S, -0.7 on April 6, 1903; and for rod R,, -0.5 and rod S, -o. 7 on Octobet 13·, 1903.
RESULTS AND THEIR ACCURACY.

The methods of observation are stated in detail on pages 2 r l-222 of Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903. · The direct results of the leveling are shown in the following tables, in which all the permanent bench marks are given. If no distance is given in the fourth column, the bench mark is in the main line of levels. If a distance is given fn the fourth as well as the third column, the bench.mark is on a spur and the distance given in the fourth column shows the point at which the spur branches from the main line.

APPENDIX NO. 6.

PRECISE LEVELING IN WYOMING; UTAH; AND IDAHO.

407

Each short section, usually from l to 2 kilometers long, into which the line was divided by permanent and temporary bench marks, was leveled at least twice, once in the forward and once in the backward direction. On each section upon which a forward and backward measure differed by more than 4rumvff? (in which Kis the distance leveled between adjacent bench marks in kilometers), both the forward and backward measures were repeated until two such measures fell within the limit stated. The fifth column gives the total discrepancy accumulated at each permanent bench mark between the ~levation as computed from the backward lines and from the forward lines separately. The elevations given in the last column are referred to mean sea level on the Atlantic ~nd the Gulf of Mexico, and are based upon the adjustment of the precise level net as given in Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903. These are the best values of the elevations for these bench marks which are available at the date of the preparation of this report. They are given to tenths of millimeters. This does not imply that the tenths are free from error. For bench marks not more than 4 kilometers apart the difference of elevation is uncertain in the millimeters and tenths; for bench marks from 4 to 400 kilometers apart the centimeters are also uncertain, and for those a greater distance apart the decimeters are uncertain. The initial elevation for this line at Red Desert, Wyoming, may possibly be an error by 300 millimeters, but it is an even chance that it is within 61 millimeters of the truth. Expressed in more precise and technical terms, these uncertainties are as follows: the probable error of the elevation above mean sea level of bench mark B 3 at Red Desert, Wyoming, is± 61 millimeters, and of bench mark v.r. at Owyhee, Idaho, is ± 69 millimeters, and for any intermediate bench mark it lies between these two values. The probable error of the difference of elevation of any two bench marks in millimeters is r.04 v1 K, in which K is the distance between the bench marks in kilometers measured along the level line. The value± l .04 millimeters used above for the probable error of the single completed kilometer of ·leveling of this class was derived from the adjustment of the level net. See Appendix 3 of the Re~rt fo[ 1903, page 379.
RED DESERT To AzusA, Wvo., LINE.

When commencing work at Red Desert, Wyoming, in 1903, a level line was run between bench marks A 3 and B3 · The observed difference of elevation was A 3 -B3 = +r.2330 ,meters. The difference A 3 -B 3 as determined in 1902 was +r.2326. (See pages 345, 580, of Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903.) This small discrepancy, 0.4 millimeters, between two bench marks 0.5 kilometers apart was interpreted as indicating that the bench marks were undisturbed. .No change was made in the adopted elevation of A 3 indicated by the above reference, and the leveling was continued westward from B3 , using its elevation as fixed by the leveling of the preceding year. Bench marks z. and A, were also connected by leveling in 1903. The difference A 3 -Z2 from the· 1903 observations was - r.9990 meters, and from the 1902 leveling, -2.005r. This discrepancy of 6. l millimeters on 0.4 kilometers was interpreted as meaning that z. liad changed slightly in elevation with reference to A 3 and B3 during the year. Accordingly a new v.alue for the elevation of z. was adopted as shown in the following table.

OGDEN, UTAH, TO POCATELLO, IDAHO, LINE.

When commencing this line at Ogden, a level line was run between bench marks B and C. The observed difference was C-B= +0.6526 meters. This same difference observed three months earlier (see page 409) was +0.6508. This small discrepancy, I.8 millimeters, between bench marks 0.2 kilometer apart, was interpreted as indicating that these bench marks were undisturbed. The level computation was continued toward Pocatello, using the elevation for B, shown on page 409.

P.ocATELLO To OwYH.l!:E, IDAHO, LINE.

When commencing this line at Pocatello, Mr. King ran a level line between ·bench marks B3 and A 3. The observed difference of elevation was B3 -A 3 = 1 .588 r meters. The same difference observed by Mr. Libby on the line Ogden to Pocatello (seep. 410) . was +1.5878. This small discrepancy, 0.3 millimeter on the distance of 0.4 kilometer, was interpreted as meaning that these bench marks were undisturbed. The level computation was continued toward Owyhee, using the elevation for B 3 shown on page 410.

STATIS'J.'ICS OF LINES.

The principal items of information in regard to the four lines are given in the fables helm.,· in the same form as the tables on pages 224-225 of Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903, arranged in such a manner as to be conducive to comparison between lines. The number of permanent bench marks includes all with which the leveling was directly connected, regardless of whether they are new bench marks or bench marks previously established by some other party or organization. The average distance between bench marks was obtained by dividing the total length of the main line by the number of permanent bench marks. The speed was obtained by dividing the total length of the line by the interval in months from the date of the first leveling to the date of the last, inclusive. The expression ''total length'' refers to the completed line. Each completed section of the line was leveled at least twice, and in some cases four or more times. To obtain the speed in terms of single line one must therefore multiply the speed here given by a factor somewhat greater than two. The· discrepancy in millimeters per kilometer was obtained by dividing the total discrepancy on the main line by the length of the main line .. The probable error of the mean result for a section was computed by the formula
r''=o.674 /2,'{f· '\/ 4s in which dis the discrepancy between the forward and backward leveling over a section and sis the number of sections. The probable error for I kilometer,. r,, was derived by assuming that the average length of a section is to I kilometer as (r'') is to r

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.
Us& oF RAILROAD RAIL As A Ron SUPPORT.

In August Mr. Libby found on the line Ogden to Pocatello that a discrepancy (B-F) of the minus sign was rapidly accumulating. The average rate of accumulation was -o. 67 millimeters per kilometer for the fi_rst 7 r kilometers of the line, during the period August 5-26. Previous experience indicated that such a result is in general due to systematic settling of rod supports. Mr. Libby therefore determined to try the effect of placi1ig the foot of the rod on a spot marked in red on the top of the railroad rail.* He used the rail for the rod support during all the leveling done by him in September and ending at Pocatello. Up to the time that this experiment was commenced the rods had been supported on foot pins described on pages 2 r r-2 r 2 of Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903. Soon after Mr. King was informed of the experiment, he also began using the railroad rails instead of the foot pins as rod supp9rts. In their reports both chiefs of party claim that the use of the rails in place of the foot pins saved enough time to enable the party to run one or two miles more of single line per working day than they otherwise would have done. The saving results from the fact that, as the point on the rail is recoverable at any time, the rear rodman niay come forward at once \vhen the observations upon his rod are completed, whereas, if a foot pin or footplate is used, he must wait until the recorder has made certain that the observations check properly and he has received a signal to that effect before pulling up the pin or plate. Mr. Libby reported that the accuracy was also greatly increased. Mr. King reported that the accuracy was not increased. A careful examination of the office computation brings out the following·corroboration of these reports. During the period August 5-26 Mr. Libby completed 85 kilometers of line, the average speed being 11 7 kilometers per month, using foot pins. During the period September r-16 he completed 70 kilometers of line, the average speed being 131 kilometers per month, using the top of the rail as a rod support. During the period September 17-28, while the party was leveling between McCammon and Pocatello, the party was not allowed to use velocipede cars on account of possible interference with the electric block signaling system there used. This made the leveling much slower than it othenvise would have been. Nevertheless, the average rate of progress was 87 kilometers per month, or a total of 35 kilometers in the period named, using the rail as a rod support. As to accuracy it may be noted that for the continuous line composed of sections run for the first time during the period August 5-26, when foot pins were being used, the percentage run more than twice was 22; and similarly for the period September l-28 this percentage was 13. The rate of accumulation of the discrepancy between the forward and. backward lines was, during the first of these periods, -41.6 millimeters on 75.6 kilometers, or -0.55 millimeter per kilometer; and during the second period, + 18.9 millimeters on 98.8 kilometers, or +o. 19 millimeter per kilometer. The probable error of a single kilometer of completed leveling for the first of these periods was ±o. 77 millimeter and for the second ±o. 74 millimeter. Mr. King stated that he began using the rail as a rod support in September, but did not name the exact date. For the purpose of investigating the effect of the change a ----- - - - -·---·------·---------·····.,-·--------· --- - · - - · - - - - *This method of support had been, unknown to Mr. Libby, tried years Lefore with complete success on the precise level line, St. Paul to Duluth, Minn., by Mr. James A. Paige. (See Chief of Engineers' Report for 1892, part 4, pp. 3075, 3077.)

comparison is here made between the period August 4-September 15 and the remainder of the season September 16-0ctober 24. During the first period Mr. King completed 174 kilometers of line, the average speed being l 24 kilometers per month; and during the second period 189 kilometers, the average speed being 145 kilometers per month. For the continuous line composed of sections nm for the first time during the first-named period, the percentage run more than twice was 17, and similarly for the second period it was 1 1. The rate of accumulation of discrepancy between the f9rward and backward lines during the first .of these periods was - 32. 2 millimeters on 161 kilometers, or -o. 20 millimeter per kilometer; and cl uring the second period - 33. 6 millimeters on 180.7 kilometers, or -o. 19 millimeter per kilometer. It is worthy of note in this connection that the accumulated discrepancy on the last 157. 7 kilometers of the line, all run after September 23, 1903, was only-7.8 millimeters, or only -0.05 millimeter per kilometer. The probable error of a single kilometer of completed leveling for the firsl of these periods was ±0.65 millimeter, and for the second period ±o. 70 millimeter. The most prominent effect of changing from the foot pins to the rail for the support of the rods was to change the rate of accumulation of discrepancy between the forward and the backward lines. This is a clear confirmation of the theory that the accumulated discrepancy is clue mainly to systematic rising or settling of rod supports. This theory is based upon the frequently observed fact that when a change is made in the method of rod support, or in the habits of the rodman, a change is apt to take place in the rate of accumulation of discrepancy between the forward and backward lines. The evidence shows clearly that the use of the rail for the rod support increased both the speed and the accuracy of the leveling. Corresponding credit is due Mr. Libby for introducing this practice. Two uncertainties in connection with this method of rod support will occur to any one who considers it carefully, namely~ the uncertainty as to whether the rodman holds the foot of the rod for both foresight and backsight on precisely the same point on the slightly rounding and sometimes inclined surface of the top of the rail, and the uncertainty as to the recovery by the rail of its former elevation after a train has passed over it. The first of these uncertainties is very small, provided the rodman is careful. No difficulty· was found in marking the exact spot on the rail which was used in such a way, with ~ialk or kiel, that the mark was recoverable, even after a train had passed over it. Direct observations have indieated that as a rule the rail rises to sensibly its former elevation quickly after a train passes. Doubtless there are exceptional cases. The best proof available that such cases are comparatively rare for the conditions under which the rail was used as a rod support, and that the systematic permanent settling of the rail caused by the passage of the train is exceedingly small, is furnished by the above comparison of the accuracy of the leveling by each party before and after beginning the use of the rail as a rod support. A systematic settling. of the rod supports tends to produce an accumulated discrepancy (B-F) with a minus sign. This sign is found in Mr. King's leveling on the rail, but during Mr. Libby's leveling on the rail the accumulated discrepancy had a plus sign indicating a systematic rising of the rod supports between each foresight and the corresponding backsight. The foot pins were carried

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904·

along with each party during the progress of the leveling and were used whenever a train was known to be approaching, or when there were special reasons for supposing that the track was not in as stable a condition as usual. The results are not subject therefore to the possible uncertainty arising from the action of every train.
COMMENTS ON THE LEVELING.

As already noted· on page 405, Mr. King used level No. 5 during the period July 17-31 on the line Red Desert to Azusa. This affords an unusualiy good opportunity to compare the results as to speed and accuracy with two different types of instruments us~d by the same observer under similar conditions. The progress in completed kilometers during the period July 17-3 l was 41, or at the rate of 83 kilometers per month. This agrees closely with the average rate of progress for the whole season, 85 kilometers per month, after deducting the period of eight days, July 9-16, when no leveling was done because the party was without an instrument. The-comparison will be more fair, however, if.the leveling with the older instrument, No. 5, is compared with that of the newer instrument, No. 7, in the one month June 9-July 8, just preceding the accident, thus eliminating from the comparison the ·period May 20-Jtme 8 at the beginning of the season when the party was comparatively unfamiliar with its work and the rate of progress unusually slow for that and other reasons. During the month June 9-July 8 the progress in completed kilometers was 95. The percentage run more than twice for the sections which were leveled for the first time with the older instrument, July 17-31, is 31, whereas the corresponding percentage for the whole season is 28. The accumulated discrepancy for the continuous line, composed entirely of sections run with the older instrument, is +13.8 millimeters on 38.7 kilometers, or + 0.36 millimeter per kilometer. Similarly, for the continuous line composed of sections run for the first time with the newer level, the accumulated discrepancy was + 54.5 millimeters on 130.6 kilometers, or +0.42 millimeter per kilometer. The probable error of a single kilometer of completed line for the former portion, run with the older instrument, was ±0.93 millimeter; and for the latter portion, with the newer level, . was ±o. 79 millimeter. ' The superiority of the newer type of level over the older type is shown in slightly greater speed and accuracy. Mr. Libby expressed the opinion in his report on the season's leveling, in connection with the work in June through the Echo Canyon,. on steep grades, that the errors were gre::tter on steep grades than on moderate grades. This opinion has frequently been expressed by other levelmen. To test its validity all sections between successive temporary or permanent bench marks during this season on which the measured difference· of elevation was greater than 10 meters were examined. Of the four portions of the line, in order from east to west, the combined lengths of such sections were 27, 85, 27, and 40 kilometers. The sum of these is 179 kilometers, or about 18 per cent of the season's leveling. The percentage run more than twice out of these is 25. ·The probable error of a single kilometer of completed line as computed from these sections alone is ±0.81 millimeter. A comparison of these two values with the corresponding values in the table on page 415 does not indicate clearly that any greater or less degree of accuracy was obtained on steep grades than on comparatively level track.

The lini<C Ogden to Azusa, run by Mr. Libby, was one on which it was difficult to make rapid progress. The grades were unusually steep over much of the line between Ogden and Leroy, a distance of 166 kilometers. Between these points the level line rises more than 1 ooo meters and descends nearly 300 meters. Over a considerable portion of the distance the railroad is so crooked that it was necessary to use one man of the party as a watchman to warn the others of trains approaching from above. Heavy winds were encountered which made it difficult to pull the velocipede cars, especially when the wind blew down grade. Four tunnels were encountered on this portion of the line. The levels were run through two of these with sights shortened to about 10 meters in length on account of the difficulty of illuminating the rods. The leveling was done over the top of the other tunnels. To climb over the Aspen Tunnel it was necessary to rise r 27 meters and descend 145 meters in a distance measured along the level line of 3.8 kilometers, or less than 2 kilometers measured along the track through the tunnel. On the first forward line between these points there were l 14 instn1ment stations, as many as there were on the next 16 kilometers to the eastward. In spite of all these difficulties the average rate of progress from Ogden to Leroy, \Vyo., May 2July 9 1 was 74 kilometers of completed line per mo.nth. On the line Red Desert to Azusa between bench marks C3 and F 3 , a distance of · only 27 kilometers, the accumulated discrepancy between the forward and backward lines was 52. 6 millimeters, or at the rate of i.95 millimeters per kilometer. The percentage nm more than twice betwe~n these points was very large, namely, 49. The observer was diligent ih searching for the cause of the trouble. About the time when the line was completed to bench mark F 3 he reached the conclusion that the rapidly accumulating discrepancy was probably due to the systematic rising of the foot pins between each foresight and the corresponding backsight. He acted upon this supposition by taking extreme care in locating and driving the pins. The rate of accumulation of discrepancy at once became small and remained so. The number of rejections on the whole line from Red Desert, Wyo., to Owyhee, Idaho, under the rule that ''if any measure over a hection gives a result differing by more than six millimeters from the mean of all the measures over that section, this measure shall be rejected" was 42, 0r one rejection for each 24 kilometers of completed line.

PRECISE LEVELING FROM HOLLAND TO NEW BRAUNFELS, TEXAS.
By JORN F. HAYFORD, Inspector ef Geodetic TYork; Assi'st{int, Coast and Geodetic SurveJ'·

This line, together with the branch line from Elgin to triangulation station Barton, near Austin, Tex., was leveled by Mr. G. C. Baldwih and Mr. F. H. Sewall, Aids, between November 5, 1903, and February 16, 1.904. The two observers used the same instrument, alternating in the recording and observing. The main line followed the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad from Holland to San Marcos, via Smithville, and the International and Great Northern Railroad from San Marcos to New Braunfels. From the vicinity of New Braunfels the main line extends over highways (a distance of 9 ' kii.ometers) to the Seguin Base of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. The branch line follows the Houston and Texas Central Railroad from Elgin to Austin, and thence over highways ( 13 kilometers) to Barton station of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. The line is com;ected at Holland with the precise level net shown in Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903, "Precise Leveling in the United States, 1900-1903." The connection with the triangulation station Barton near Austin and with the Seguin Base near New :araunfels serves to control the elevations fixed by the measurement o,f vertical angles along the ninety-eighth meridian between the Lampasas Base net and the Seguin Base. INSTRUMENT AND Roos. Precise level No. 8 was used. It is one of the most recent type and is fully described in Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903, pages 200-211: . The value of a 2-millimeter division on the level vial of this instrument is slightly less than 2". The telescope has a clear aperture of 4.2 centimeters and a focal length of 41 centimeters. Rods R, and S were used. They are of the type described on pages 418-419 of Appendix 8 of the Report for 1899. They are of the direct reading type and carry a centimeter graduation on which reatiings are made to millimeters by estimation. The lengths of the 3-meter interval, marked on each· of the rods by .a fine graduation on metallic plugs in its face, as determined by the Bureau of Standards, before and after the field work, and reduced to o° Centigrade, are as follows:

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

Each rod was measured with a steel tape at least twice each month while in the field. The reading of the rod thermometer was always noted in connection with these measurements and care was taken that the rods and tape should be at the temperature of the atmosphere, so that reliable comparisons could be made. These measurements were made in order to detect, if possible, any change in the lengths of the rods during the season. They do not give the absolute lengths of the rods at any time, as the error of the tape with which the measurements were made is not known. The total range in the field measurements of the 3-meter interval on rod R, was 0.4 millimeter, and on rod S, 0.5 millimeter. The field measurements agreed with the measurements at the Bureau of Standards in indicating that no change took place in the length of either rod during the season. The computation of the elevations was made with the mean excess of length from the four Bureau of Standards measurements of the two rods, namely, 0.33 millimeter per meter. The index corrections for the rods as determined at Washington before and after the field work were as follows, in millimeters: for rod R,, -0.5 and for rod S, -o. 7, on October 13, 1903; for rod R,, -0.5 and for rod S, -o.8, on April 13, 1904.
RESULTS AND THEIR ACCURACY.

The methods of observation were those which are stated in detail on pages 211-222 of Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903. · The direct results of the leveling are shown in the following table, in which all the permanent bench marks are given. If no distance is gh·en in the fourth column, the bench mark is in the main line of levels. If a distance is given in the fourth as well as the third column, the bench mark is on a spur and the distance given in the fourth column shows the point at which the spur branches from the main line. Each short section, usually from 1 to 2 kilometers long, into which the line was divided by permanent and temporary bench marks, was leveled at least twice, once in the forward and once in the backward direction. On each section upon which a forward and backward measure differed by more than 4 """ ../K (in which K is the distance leveled between adjacent bench marks in kilometers), both the forward and backward measures were repeated until two imch. measures fell within the limit stated: The fifth column gives the total discrepancy accumulated at each permanent bench mark between the elevation as computed from the backward lines and from the forward lines separately. The elevations given in the last column are referred to mean sea level on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico and are based upon the adjustment of the precise level net as given in Appendix No. 3 of the Report for J903. These are the best v·alues of 1he elevations for these bench marks which are available at the date of the preparation of this report. They are given to tenths of millimeters. This does not imply that the tenths are free from error. For bench marks not more than 4 kilometers apart the difference of elevation is uncertain in the millimeters and tenths; for bench marks from 4 to 400 kilometers apart the centimeters . are also uncertain; and for those at greater distances apart the decimeters are uncertain. The initial elevation at Holland, Tex., may possibly be in error oy 200 millimeters, but it is an even chance that it is within 39 millimeters of the truth.

APPENDIX NO. 7.

PRECISE LEVELING IN TEXAS.

Expressed in more precise and technical terms these uncertainties are as follows: the probable error of the elevation above mean sea level of bench mark W, at Holland is ±39 millimeters, of Barton triangulation station, near Austin, is ±41 millimeters, and of Seguin West Bast:, near New Braunfels, ±42 millimeters, and for any intenuediate bench mark it lies between these values. The probable error of the difference of · elevation of any two bench marks in millimeters is ± r.04 ../-K, in which Ar is the distance between the bench marks in kilometers measured along the level line. The value ±1 .04 millimeters used above for the probable error for a single completed kilometer of leveling of thi$ class was derived from the adjustment of the level net. See l\.ppendix 3 of the Report for 1903, page 379.
RESULTS OF THE LEVELING.

When commencing the leveling at Holland in November, 1903, it was found that bench mark Y,, established in April, 1903, had been destroyed. Lines were run connecting W 4 with X 4 and z,. The difference of elevation X 4 - \V 4 , as observed in April, 1903, was +6.2580 meters,* and as obsen1eci in November, 1903, + 6.2628 meters. This discrepancy of 4.8 millimeters on the distance of o.8 kilometer was interpreted as indicating that these bench marks were undisturbed. The building on which X 4 is situated· had been partially burned between April and November, but the portion of the wall near X 4 had not been disturbed. The difference of elevation Z 4 - W 4 , as observed in April, 1903, was +5.8932 meters·, and as observed in November, 1903, +5.8222 meters. This large discrepancy, 7 l .o millimeters on 1.o kilometer, indicates, in connection with the leveling between X 4 and W 4 cited above, that z, had settled about 7 centimeters between April and November. The computation of elevations was .based upon the elevation of W 4 as determined in April, namely, 154.6978 meters.

The principal items of information in regard to this line nre given in the table below in the same form as the tables on ;:>ages 224-225 of Appendi:-~ 3 of the Report for 1903, arranged in such a manner as to be conducive to comparison between lines. The number of permanent bench marks includes all with which the leveling was directly connected, regardless of whether they are new bench marks or bench marks previously established by some other party or organization. The average distance between bench marks was obtained by dividing the total length of the main line by the number of permanent bench marks. The speed was obtained by dividing the total length of the line by the interval in · months from the date of the first leveling to the date of the last, inclusive. The expression, ''total length '' refers to the completed line. Each completed section of the line was leveled at least twice, and in some cases four or more times. To obtain the speed in terms of single line one must therefore multiply the speed here given by a factor somewhat greater than two.

The discrepancy in millimeters per kilometer was obtained by dividing the total discrepancy on the main line by the length of the main line. The probable error of the mean result for a section was computed by the formula -4s in which dis the discrepancy between the forward and backward leveling over a sectio~, ands is the number of sections. The probable error for 1 kilometer, r., was derived by assuming that the average length of a section is to 1 kilometer as (r") 2 is to r/.

COMMENTS ON 'l'HE; LEVELING.

Both observe!S used the railroad rails as rod supports during the greater part of the time, following the practice of Mr. Libby and Mr. King during the latter part of their leveling in the summer of 1903, as set forth in Appendix 6 of the Report for 1904. The observers were cautious in avoiding the use of the rail when a train was known to be approaching, or after heavy rains, or when the track had been tamped recently by the section men. Apparently the rather large percentage of re-running (22) was due mainly to tlJe inexperience of the two observers. Neither observer had any experience as observer on precise leveling before the beginning of this work. Mr. Baldwin had had several seasons of experience as rodman and recorder. During the last month of the leveling, over the interval from bench mark 457 S. A. to the end of the line, 95 kilometers, the percentage of re-running was 8, much smaller than the average for the season. The effect of experience on the part of the observers also shows in the rate of progress. The av.erage rate of progress for the whole season \Vas 92 kilometers of conipleted lii1e per month. During the last month of work, January 17-February 16, l 13 kilometers were completed.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY ·REPORT, 1904.

The alternation in observing furnished a good opportunity to compare the results of two men under nearly the same conditions. Mr. Baldwin ran four sections of the main line having an aggregate length of 148 kilometers, and Mr. Sewall ran three sections with the same· aggregate length, 148 kilometers. Each short section of the line which was run forward by a certain observer was also run backward by the same observer. The percentage of re-runniO:g was 24 for Mr. Baldwin and 19 for Mr. Sewall. The average accumulated discrepancy (B-F) was for Mr. Baldwin +0.03 millimeter per kilometer, and for Mr. Sewall -0.60 millimeter per kilometer. The probable error of a single kilometer of completed line was for Mr. Baldwin ±0.84 millimeter, and for Mr. Sewall ±0.83 millimeter. The conclusion from these figures must be that there was but slight difference in the habits of observing of the two men or in the accuracy of the results. The most marked difference was that Mr. Baldwin was more successful than Mr. Sewall in preventing the accumulation of discrepancy between the forward and backward lines. The number of rejections on the whole line under the rule that ''if any measure over a section gives a result differing by more than 6 millim.eters from the mean of all the measures over that section, this rheasure shall be rejected" was 20, or one rejection for each 15 kilometers of completed line.

THEORY OF THE TRANSIT MICROMETER.

The transit micrometer* is a form of n;gistering micrometer placed with its movable. line in the focal plane of an astronomic transit, and at right angles with the direction of the motion of the image of a star which is being observed as it crosses the meridian. Certain contact points on the micrometer head serve to make or break an electric circuit as th~y pass a fixed contact spring, and they record upon a chronograph the instant at which the micrometer head, and, therefore, the moving micrometer line, reached each of the positions corresponding to the contact point. The movement necessary to make the micrometer line follow a star image is given to the micrometer head either by the hand of the observer, by clockwork, or by an electric motor. · . The purp0se of the transit micrometer is to furnish a means of determining time, that is, clock errors, which shall be sensibly free from any personal equation on the part of the observer. The process of observing consists simply in bisecting the star image and in keeping it bisected continuously as it moves across the field of vision. The record made upon the chronograph is similar to that which would appear there if a series of fixed lines were in the focal plane of the telescope, and the observer recorded the instant of transit of a star image across each line as seen by him by operating an electric key in the chronograph circuit. The computation is, with a possible exception in some minor details, made exactly as if the chronograph record had been produced by the use of fixed lines and a key. The mental process of the observer is widely different in the two cases. In the first case he attempts to obsenie and record the particular instant of the transit of a star image across a certain fixed line. 'l'he result as recorded upon the chronograph sheet depends upon the rapidity of perception and action of the observer. In the other case the time element does not enter directly into the mental process of the observer. He is not trying to note the particular instant at which any7vent occurs. He is intent simply

* The expression transit micrometer is preferred over the expression registering micrometer for the reason that it is more definite. There is a registering micrometer made by the Repsolds which is used to record repeated pointings made on a star, as it crosses the meridian, to determine its declination.

upon keeping a star image bisected by a movable line which is under his control. In general he sees the star image at a given instant either slightly ahead of or slightly behind the moving line, and determines to make the line move more slowly or more rapidly,* so as to improve the bisection. After an interval which depends upon his rapidity of action, the bisection is improved, perhaps made perfect. He soon observes that the bisection is again imperfect and makes an attempt to improve it. This cycle of events, the noting that the bisection is imperfect, deciding to correct it, attempting to correct -it, and again observing that it is imperfect, is repeated at a rate which is dependent upon the rapidity of perception and of action of the observer and upon his temperament. His personal equtJ.tion of the kind which affects the key method of observation is now effective in determining the amplitude and period of the oscillation of the moving line forward and backward across the ~ar image, but not in fixing the average error in the position of the moving line. The latter is fixed mainly by a personal equation of the same form as if a series of bisections of a fixed star image were being made. The observer may be subject to a personal equation in estimating the · position of the image which leads him to habitually place the line slightly to the right or to the left of the image. Such a personal equation in estimating the position of a stationary or slowly moving image has a much smaller effect upon the result of an observation of time with a transit micrometer than the personal equation in observing the instant of transit has upon the result of an observation of time with an electric key. t This is the theory of the transit micrometer. The proof of the correctness of the theory lies in the results which have been secured with the transit micrometer by various observers. Though it has been claimed that the accidental errors of observation have been reduced by the use of a transit micrometer in the place of a key, the principal claim, and in all cases the important claim, is that it nearly, if not quite, eliminates from the results the effects of all personal equation on the part of the observer, and hence, also, the effects of variation of the personal equation, which would otherwise be present.
SHORT HISTORY OF THE TRANSIT MICROMETER.

The observations of star transits by means of a movable transit line was first suggested in 1865 by Director Carl Braun, of Kalocsa Observatory, in Hungary, in a publication entitled "Das Passagen-Mikl'ometer," 1865, Leipzig. He believed that it was necessary to have the movable line driven by clockwork. He failed in an attempt to construct a clockwork which would drive the movable line satisfactorily so as to follow the transits of stars of various declinations. Many years then elapsed during which, apparently, no attempt was made to use a transit n11crometer. Repsold, the well-known instrument maker, was the first to suggest in print,! in
*If the observer with a transit micrometer driven by clockwork gives the moving line a sudden forward movement, or backward ;novement, superposed upon the approximately uniform motion given by clockwork, instead of making the mere change of speed indicated in the text, this does not materially alter the facts as to the mental process. t These statements as to personal equation made in regard to observers by the key and chronograph method apply with little modification to eye and ear method of observation. :j: "Neuer Vorschlag zur Vermeidung des personlichen Zeit-Fehlers bei Durchgangsbeobachtungen," in No. 2940 of the Astronomische Nachrichten.

1889, that no clockwork was required, and that very good results could be secured with a hand-driven transit micrometer. He then constructed such a micrometer with which excellent results were secured. The Prussian Geodetic Institute made a series of tests of the Repsold transit micrometer in 1891, which showed that the apparent differences of the personal equation of the four observers who took part in the test were about one-tenth as large with the transit micrometer as with fixed lines and a key. The tests also showed that there are other well-marked advantages of the transit micrometer over other methods of observing star transits. The Prussian Geodetic Institute acqu~red two transits of the broken telescope type made by Bamberg, of Berlin, which were equipped with transit micrometers slightly modified from the Repsold design, especially as to the contact mechanism. From i 891 to the present time the Geodetic Institute has had these instruments in use on various occasions on telegraphic longitude determinations. Its experience constitutes a strong proof that the use of the transit micrometer is effective in increasing the accuracy of such determinations. The latest work of this kind of which the results have been p11blished at the date of this writing-, is the determination in 1903 of the difference of longitude between Potsdam and Greenwich. The transit micrometer has been tried at various times in fixed observatories, and various opinions in regard to it have been formed. The consensus of opinion as published is strongly in favor of the transit micrometer as being effective in eliminating the effects of personal equation. In the United States the transit micrometer has been used continuously for several years at the \Vashburn Observatory at Madison, Wis. It has also been used at the observatory at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich. Both of these instruments are hand-driven Repsold transit microm~ters. At the Philadelphia Central High School experiments have been made by Prof. M. B. Snyder with a t_ransit micrometer driven by an electric motor. A short summary of the literature which is the basis for the above outline of the history of the transit micrometer is given in the latter part of this Appendix. \Vhen the question of using transit micrometers in making telegraphic longitude observations was under consideration in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the facts, very briefly outlined above, were available. While these seemed to be sufficient to leave no doubt that on large instruments used in fixed observatories the transit micrometer is a complete success, and that similarly it has proved successful when applied to longitude transits of the Prussian Geodetic Institute, it did not seem safe to predict the degree of accuracy which would be attained with transit micrometers applied to the particular type of transits used for longitude determinations in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. These transits carry a straight telescope, and therefore do not have the eye end of the telescope supported so rigidly as it is in the Geodetic Institute instruments, which have the eyepiece in the end of the horizontal axis of the telescope, and therefore quite near to one of the fixed points of support. The degree of stability of the eye end of the telescope is important with hand-driven micrometers, since the observations must be

made while the observer's .fingers are in contact with the micrometer. There were also various minor points on which more information was desired before placing the transit micrometer in regular use in longitude parties. A transit micrometer suitable for use on the Coast and Geodetic Survey transits was therefore designed by Mr. E.G. Fischer, Chief of the Instrument Di~ision of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, constructed under his directions, and the tests discussed in this Appendix were made. The following description was written by Mr. Fischer.

Before considering the details of this micrometer. three points were determined upon as being essential to insure accurate and decisive action, durability, and convenience in reading the chronograph record made by it. First, it was decided that the mechanism of the slide carrying the wire should be of the form in whfoh the :Screw is mounted in bearings at the extreme ends of the box or case holding tlte sli<;le, the.-m,icrometer head being fast upon the end of the screw projecting from· the box, because this insures greater stability under the side stress of the gears connecting the. serew with tlle hand-wheel shaft than the form usually employed in theodolite and ocular micrometers, in which the screw is fastened to the slide and therefoi:e takes part of what~ver play there may be in the latter. Second, it was decided that the electric recording device of the micrometer should be of the''make-circuit form, transmitting its records to the chronograph, which is in the break-circuit of the chronometer, through a relay. This permits the use of a strong . . <;:urreti't through the contact points of the micrometer head, and therefore a minimum of pres5ure upon the latter by the contact.spring. Third, in order that the micrometer transmit no records except those made within an accepted space on either side of the line of collimation and forming the observations of the star transits proper, aJ;l.automatic cut-out must be provided. Figures 1 and 2 show the micrometer with draw tube and eye end of the telescope. The telescope has a focal length of :us centimeters and an aperture of 77 millimeters. It is of the straight type, of the same general form as that shown in illustration No. I of Appendix 7 of the Report for 1898. The micrometer box or· case is 46 millim.eters .in length and 31 millimeters wide. Within it and near to one side is mounted the micrometer screw. Upon the latter fits, by a thread and cylindrical bearing,. a rectangular fra~e forming the slide, which is 31 millimeters long and 23 millimet~rs wide .. All play or lost motion, both of the slide upon the screw and the screw in its beaiings, ·fa.taken up by means of a helical spring within the box, which, pressing from the inner end of .the box against the slide and through it against the screw, holds the latter firmly against the point of an adjustable abutting screw, without impeding its free rotary motion. Upon the slide, at right angles to its line of motion, is mounted the single spider thread, which is used for bisecting the star during its passage across the field. Two threads, parallel to the line of motion, about four time seconds apart, and mounted against the inner surface of the box, define the space within which the observations should be made. A short comb of five teeth, with distances equal to one turn of the screw between them,. is also provided

and indicates the four whole turns of the screw within which the observations are to be made. The diameter of the field of view through the Airy diagonal eyepiece, which has an equivalent focus of 12 millimeters, is something over 24 turns of the screw; thus giving a space bf fully 10 turns of the screw on each side of the four turns in the center of the field. That portion of the micrometer screw which projects through the box has the micrometer head fitted upon it, and secured in position by a clamp nut. The edge of this head, graduated at the corner nearest the box to 100 parts (g, Fig. i), also carries at its opposite corner a screw thread of three turns with a pitch of 1 millimeter and a diameter of 32 millimeters (t, Fig. 1). Sunk into the outer side of the head and fitted concentrically with it is a thin metallic shell, which has fitted upon it a hollow cylinder made of ebonite, 6 millimeters long and 26 millimeters diameter (e, Fig. 1 ). Five strips of platinum, omm.4 thick, and corresponding to the 12.5, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, and 87.5 division points* of the graduation, g, are slotted into the edge of the ebonite cylinder (see Figs. 1 and 2) and secured in such manner as to make metallic contact with the micrometer head proper, and, through it, with the screw, micrometer box, telescope and telescope pivots and the iron uprights of the transit. By releasing the clamp nut within the the ebonite ring the graduated head, with its thread, t, can be adjusted, in a rotary sense, in relation to the thread of the screw, and therefore also of the spider thread upon the slide.· At the same time the position of the platinum contact strips can be set to correspond to the zero of the graduation, g,,which latter is read by the index, z', Fig. 2. A small ebonite plate, p, Fig. 1, secured to the micrometer box, carries upon its outer end, mounted in a.suitable metal block, the contact spring, s, Fig. I. It ends in a piece of platjnum turned over so as to re5t radially upon the ebonite cylinder. Its width is 4 millimeters, and its thickness that of the contact strips, i. e., omm.4. A small screw, c, ·Figs. r Jµld 2, serves to adjust .the pressure of the spring upon.the cylinder. Against one end"ot the micrometer box is faste1ied a small bracket, upon which is cen~ tered a small worm ~heel, w, Fig. 1 1 gearing into the screw thread, t, of the micrometer head. It has 40 teeth, and moves one tooth for each turn of the micromet~r head. The rim of a cup-shaped cylinder, r, Fig. 1, which is secured. to this worm wheel so that it can be turned and clamped in any position relative .to the zero point of +:1e micrometer bead, has cut into it a notch with, sloping ends and of a length corresponding to four teeth of the worm wheel, w, or four turns of the micrometer screw. From the end of a lever, l, Fig. 1, mounted against the side of the micrometer box, projectt' a small steel pin reaching over the rim of the cylinder, r. The other end of this lever carries a small ivory tip, which rests upon the end of a spring, b, Fig. 1, mounted on an ebonite pl~te and pressing at its middle point against a platinum-tipped screw, a. Whenever the small steel pin of the lever, l, rests in the notch of the cylinder, r, the spring, b, is in contact with the screw, a, and allows the fl.9w of an electric current through the coiled wires, nt and n, to the contact spring, s. But when the micrometer has been turned two revolutions to either. side of its middle or zero position, and its motion is continued, the sloped ends of the notch in the cylinder, r, will engage the lever, l, and through it force the spring, b, away from the screw, a, thus breaking the current ..

therefore, that this arrangement permits of the motion of the spider thread across the entire field \vithout transmitting records to the chronograph, except during the four revolutions symmetrically disposed about the line of collimation. Against the inner side of the micrometer head is fastened a spur wheel, k, Fig. 2, with 36 teeth of 48 dimetral (inch) pitch, into which gears the wheel,/, with 72 teeth, mounted on the hand-wheel shaft, d. This shaft is supported by arms from the micrometer box, as can readily be seen from Fig. 2. The hand wheels have a diameter of 33 millimeters, are 116 millimeters apart, and equidistant from the middle of the telescope, allowing ample space for manipulating in either position of the eyepiece. The pitch of the micrometer screw is about 48.4 threads per centimeter, or 123 per inch. In the telescope of Transit No. 2 the angular value of one revolution of the screw is 2.4 equatorial time seconds, nearly. As the gearing of the hand-wheel shaft to the micrometer screw is as 2 to r, it follows that the hands must produce rotary motion of one revolution in 4".8 for an equatorial star.* The adjustment for collimation is made by means of two nuts upon a small screw, x, Fig. 2, fastened to the micrometer box, which in turn is mounted by dovetail slides upon a short flanged cylinder, y. The latter is fixed in position by the screws, 11, which, when loosened, also permit of a rotary motion for adjusting the transit wire into the vertical. Neither of these adjustments will disturb the rather delicate relations between the zero of the transit wire, the contact breaks upon the micrometer head, and the worm wheel with its electric cut-out attachment. As indicated in the description of the ebonite head, with its five platinum contact strips, the instrument itself is used as part of the electric conductor forming the relay circuit. The relay of 20 ohms resistance converts the make records into break records in the chronometer and chronograph circuit. From the binding post, q, Fig. ·1, the current is carried by means of a rubber-covered wire along the telescope to and into the telescope axis, within the latter to an insulated metal cylinder projecting from the transit pivot. Each of the wye bearings of the transit has fastened to it an insulated contact spring, which, being connected with an insulated binding post at the foot of the instrument, establishes the circuit whether the telescope lies in an east or west position. Another binding post, screwed directly into the iron foot of the transit, affords a ready means for making the necessary connection to begin observations.
THE TEST OF THE FIRST COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY TRANSIT MICROMETER.

The test of the transit micrometer described above was made in March, April, and May, 1904. The principal objects of the test were: ( 1) To determine whether any difference of personal equation between different observers, or relative personal equation, exists in observations taken with the transit micrometer; and if so, its magnitude as compared with that ordinarily found with the key and chronograph. (2) To determine what changes, if any, should be made in this transit micrometer to adapt it to use by Coast and Geodetic Survey field parties in telegraphic longitude observations.
*During the first half of the tests reported in this Appendix the gears were such that the dridng heads made one revolution in 2·.4 for an equatorial star.

(3) To determine how many nights of observation will be necessary to secure a given degree of accuracy if the transit mirometer is used. In a test with these objects in view it was considered desirable to make the conditions no more favorable to the success of the micrometer than would be encountered in the field. The test was made for the purpose of discovering possible defects in the instrument and method rather than to show what could be done under ideal conditions. The conditions during the test were, in the following respects, more unfavorable than would ordinarily be encountered in field work. \Vith one exception each observer concerned in the test stopped observing before securing sufficient practice to be· an expert with the apparatus; not one of the observers practiced at all with the instrument before taking part in the test; few of the observers had done any astronomic observing recently and were therefore out of practice, and some of them had never had any experience in making astronomic observations. Each time set extended over twice the interval it would take in regular work, and hence the errors due to changes in the instrument, pier, and rate of the chronometer should be greater than in the regular work. The weather conditions were no better than the average in the field, the nights on which there was no interruption by clouds being exceptional. The observations were all made at the observatory on the grounds of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office. They were made on 18 nights, commencing on March 15 and ending on May 3. The total number of time sets observed was 75, some of them being incomplete sets. A complete set consisted of ro to r 2 stars and included one reversal of the horizontal axis of the instrument at about the middle of the set. The r6 observers who took part in the work are indicated below in five classes. They will be referred to hereafter in this report by initials only. Class l. Observers having experience in astronomic observations and sufficient practice within a year in handling some instrument of precision to be in good training: E. G. Fischer, Chief of Instrument Division, 0. B. French and C. H. Sinclair, Assistants. Class 2. Observers having no experience in astronomic observations, but having sufficient practice in handling some instrument of precision within a year to be in good training: W. H. Burger and 0. W. Ferguson, Assistants, and F. H. Sewall, Aid. Class 3. Observers having experience in astronomic observations, but not having had sufficient practice with any instrument of precision within a year to be in good training: F. D. Granger and \Villiam Eimbeck, Assist:.mts, C. E. Morford, Aid, and A. L. Baldwin, Computer. Class 4. Observers with little experience at any time in handling instruments of precision of such a nature as to be in training for this class of observations: C. R. Duvall, R. M. Packard, Lelia J. Harvie, Sarah Beall, and Lilian Pike, Computers. Class 5. An observer with experience. in astronomic observations, but with little practice in observing with any instrument of precision within a year. This observer, J. F. Hayford, had the advantage over all others in that he did about half of all the observing with the transit micrometer from March 15 to May 3, and had, therefore, an opportunity which the others did not have to become thoroughly familiar with and expert in the use of the transit micrometer. The stars observed were all selected from the Berliner J ahrbuch. In the finder list prepared at the beginning of the test the stars were designated by consecuth·e numbers.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

On each night the observations were commenced as early as possible. Two observers, J. F. H. and one other, took alternate stars in the list, J. F. H. taking the odd numbers on about half of the nights and on the remaining nights the even numbers. The observers were forced to depart from the rule of observing alternate stars on some occasions on account of missed stars, or for the purpose of balancing the azimuth factors in a half.set. \Vhen each observer had secured observations on five or six stars, the horizontal axis was reversed and another half set taken and thus a complete time set secured for each observer. The stride level was read four times during the double set of ·stars. Each observer thus secured a time set of ten to twelve stars, from which the the errors of azimuth, collimatioq, and level could be eliminated with considerable accuracy by computation. The mean epochs of the two time sets were nearly the same and they were affected in nearly the same manner by any irregularity in the running of the chronometer. The difference between the two derived chronometer errors from such a pair of time sets was evidently due almost entirely to errors of observation and to relative personal equation. Each of such a· pair of complete time sets was computed independently of the other, except that the stride level readings were common to the two. In a few cases in which incomplete sets were secured, the collimation constant (and sometimes, also, the azimuth constant) was adopted from some complete set. The computations were made by a modified form of the field method of· reduction stated in Appendix 9 of the ReP<:>rt for 1896.

RELATIVE PERSONAL EQUATION.

The relative personal equation of two observers as derived from each pair of simultaneous time sets by taking the difference of the two computed chronometer errors is shown below. A plus sign indicates that the observer first named observes later (slower) than the other. The probable errors of the personal equations as given in the fourth column of the table were derived from the residuals from the separate stars in the two time sets concerned. The weights as given in the last column are made inversely proportional to the squares of the probable errors given in the preceding column.

There are 39 determinations in all of the relative personal equation. In 22 cases out of 39 the derived value of the relative personal equation from a pair of time sets is less than o·.05 and there are but 9 cases in which it is greater than o".10. It is evident that the derived values of the relative personal equation are so small that it is necessary to examine the evidence carefully to determine whether they are real values or simply the result of accidental errors of observation. If they are the latter, that is, merely residuals, it should be expected from the theory of errors that in about 19 cases out of 39 the derived value of the relative personal equation should be less than its computed probable error. The table sh.o"'s 18 such cases. Similarly in not more than one case out of 39 should the derived value be greater than 3~ times its computed probable error, if the values are residuals only. The table shows but one such case. Apparently, therefore, the relative personal equation of each pair of observers was so small as to be almost, if not entirely, concealed by the accidental errors. The different values of the relative personal equation for each pair of observers being combine&_according to the relative weights shown in Table II, the values in Table III are found. The probable errors here given correspond to these weights and therefore depend upon the residuals of the separate stars in the time sets.

It may seem that in combining different determinations of the relative personal equation for a given pair of observers the weights should be made equal, upon the supposition that the variation in relative personal equation from set to set of time observations is greaterthan the uneliminated effects of accidental errors in each set. Accordingly, Table IV has been made upon this basis. The probable errors M given in this table are computed from the residuals of the different determinations from the mean for that pair of observers, with the exception of the values, given in parentheses, corresponding to single determinations, which are merely repeated from Table III.

or are merely residuals resulting from accidental errors. In Table III there are 5, and in Table IV, 9, out of 16 cases in which the value in the third column is less than its computed probable error. This corresponds fairly well with the number, 8 in each case, which should be expected if these values were entirely due to accidental errors. There is but one case in Table III and two in Table IV in which the value in the third column exceeds 3~ times its probable error, as shown in the fourth column. This is a slight indication that the values in the third column are relative personal equations rather than residuals. It is a curfous fact, for which no explanation is apparent, that there is no value in the third column of Table IV ·which is larger than the corresponding value in Table III. The relative personal equation of J. F. H., as compared with the mean of the 15 other observers in,·olved in the test, has been computed in three different ways: First, by taking the weighted mean of the 15 values involving J. F. H. in Table III, with weights depending upon the probable errors there shown; 'second, by taking the weighted mean of the values in Table IV, with weights proportional·to the number of determinations as shown in column 2; third, by taking the indiscriminate mean of the values in Table IV. The three values thus obtained are respectively: Mean observer- J. F. H. " " -J. F. H.

It is th~refore uncertain whether there is a relative personal equation between the mean observer and J. F. H. The conclusion from Tables II, III, and IV must be that the relative personal equation between two observers with a transit micrometer is so small as to be masked by the accidental errors of observation, and that it is probably less in every case than o·.050. Two interesting contrasts may be shown between the values of the relative personal equation here derived from observations with the transit micrometer and those which have resulted from longitude observations with a key and chronograph. On pages 212-245 of Appendix 2 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1897, "Telegraphic Longitude Net of the United States," there are shown 59 values of the relative personal equation derived from observations in the field, excluding European C6nnections and certain cases in which the relative personal equation was determined 'in some unusual way. These 59 values involved 10 different observers. Each value is, in general, derived from ten nights of observation, and a total of twenty time sets by each observer, and is subject to a probable error of only from ±o".003 to ±o".020. There are but 16 out of these 59 values less than o".050; whereas, Table III shows 9 out of 16 values smaller than this limit.* Similarly there are 41 out of these 59 values greater than o".100; whereas Table III shows but 4 values out ·of 16 greater than this limit. Moreover, of these four values, three involved observers having no previous experience in this class of observations, and not one of the four is based on as much as two complete time sets by each observer.
*The contrast is still greater if Table IV is used.

APPENDIX NO. 8.

TEST OF A TRANSIT MICROMETER.

In June, 1896, the relative personal equation C. H. S.-J. F. H. was determined at \Vashington with a key, using the half-transit method on two nights and on the remaining night by simultaneous time sets with two instruments. It was found to be

ACCURACY AS SHOWN BY THE RESIDUALS IN EACH TI:ME SET.

To secure a standard with which to compare the transit micrometer observations, 19 primary longitudes observed by Coast and Geodetic Survey parties in the interval 1895-1899 were examined. Nine observers, nearly all having long experience in this class of work, were concerned in these 19 determinations. They represent, therefore, average work with the key by expert observers. The probable error of a single observation of an equatorial star (weight unity)* was computed in each of these longitude determinations from the residuals of each star from the mean for the time set. Its minimum value for any group of ten nights was ±o".022, its maximum value ±o".072, and its mean value ±o".036. If these values be reduced in accordance with the scale of weights to correspond to the average probable error of a single observation of a star, for stars of such declinations as were used in the test of the transit micrometer, thus making a direct comparison possible with the values given below in Table V, they become ±o".025 for the minimum, ±o".082 for the maximum, and ±o".041 for the mean. In the transit micrometer test all stars were givei1 equal weight regardless of their declination. The average value of the probable error of a single observation of a star for each obser.ver with the transit micrometer, is given below in Table V for comparison with the average ±o".041, shown above for key observations.
*For the scale of weights used, see p. 291 of Appendix 7 of the C. & G. S. Report for 18g8, "Determination of Time, Longitude, Latitude, and Azimuili."

For the one observer, J. F. H., who had sufficient continuous practice with the transit micrometer to become somewhat expert with it, the probable error of a single observation is about 50 per cent greater than for experts with the key. For the remaining observers, without any previous practice with the transit micrometer, and, as a rule, observing not more than two sets, it is about 100 per cent greater than for experts with the key. These comparisons refer to accidental errors only. Table V indicates that the change in the speed of the driving heads had almost no effect on the accuracy of the observations. With a key and with portable transits of the size used in the primary longitude determinations in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the slow moving stars of large declination are observed with much less accuracy than the equatorial stars. (See weight table, p. 29 r, Report for 1898, already referred to.) The errors for stars of declination 60° are supposed to be about 41 per cent larger, and for stars of declination 70° about 85 per cent larger than for equatorial stars. To determine whether such a relation holds for the transit micrometer Table VI was compiled, using all the ol:iservations made during the test. The computations were made in such a way that the residuals represent the relative accuracy correctly, with the exception of a few stars of very large declination, all stars having been given equal weight and, in general, all having been !lsed, as time stars.

Table VI indicates that the residuals of J. F. H. with the transit micrometer for slow-moving stars are much larger in proportion to those for equatorial star:; than for 'key observations. Thus, for stars of declination about 60° the residuals are fully double those for equatorial stars, whereas for key observations they would be but 50 per cent greater. On the other hand, for all other observers than J. F. H. with the transit micrometer, the accuracy is much more nearly the same for stars of different declinations than for key observations. l<:ach observer who was just beginning to use the transit micrometer usually showed by his remarks, and by the character of the record on the chronograph sheet, that he had some difficulty in keeping up a steady motion of the driving heads when observing an equatorial star, even after the change to the slow.er speed of the driving heads had been made. On the other hand, little difficulty of this kind was encountered after one became expert in the manipulation of the driving heads. This is the apparent explanation of the relatively large errors for equatorial stars of the other observers as compared withJ. F. H. For J. F. H. and with the slower speed of the driving heads the relative magnitudes of the residuals for different declinations correspond closely to a constant angular error, as shown in Table VII.
*There was but one residual in this group; hence this value is uncertain.

The residuals were also carefully examined to see whether there was any tendency for stars near to and 011 opposite sides of the zenith to have opposite signs upon the average for a gh·en observer. No such tendency could he found. Such a tendency would be produced by the habit on the part.of an observer of placing the line slightly to the right or to the left of the star image as seen by him.
ACCURACY OF BISECTION OF STAR WITH MOVING LINE.

In making the computation of the time of transit of each star, the first step was.to add together the times of the first and thirty-sixth, second and thirty-fifth, third and thirty-third, etc., records made on the chronograph sheets for that star. As each of these pairs of lines are symmetrically placed with reference to the mean of all, the eighteen sums will differ from each other by amounts depending upon the accidental errors in keeping the star bisected. The theoretically best method of measuring these accidental errors is to compute the probable error of a single such sum by taking out the residuals of each of the eighteen sums from the mean, squaring them, etc. This would involve more computation than is necessary for the present purpose. Accordingly the following much simpler method of reaching the same result was used: On each star the number of sums of pairs that agreed within o". r with the mean was counted. Call this number N. The separate records on the chronograph sheet were read to the nearest one-tenth of a second. The mean of the eighteen sums, or mean time of transit for each star, was taken to the nearest one-hundredth of a second. If this mean were 1s·.17, N= r 3 would mean that 13 out of the r 8 sums were either r 8. r or 18.2. Evidently the greater the value of N the greater the_ accuracy. Table VIII serves to indicate the relative accuracy of bisections by different observers and for the two speeds of the driving heads. Table IX serves to make the comparison for the t"wo speeds used and also for different declinations.
*The method of computation was such as to tend to make this computed mean residual too small.

For the observer with much practice, J. F. H., the accuracy is slightly greater w1th the slow' speed for the driving heads, but for the remaining observers the reverse is true. The means for all, including }: F. H., indicate that the change of speed had practically no effect on the accuracy. The table shows clearly the advantage of practice with the instrument.

Table IX indicates that for J. F. H. the slight apparent gain in accuracy when the speed of the driving heads was decreased was not confined to equatorial stars. The gain is. so slight, however, that it may be due simply to the eff~t of practice. Similarly, the apparent loss in accuracy for other observers is not confined either to slow-moving stars or to equatorial stars. It may be due simply to a difference in observers.

The mean values for N may be converted into probable errors by the use of the table on page 435 of Wright's Adjustment of Observations. The fourth column of Table IX has been so converted and is shown in Table X below. There is placed beside it in the fourth column of Table X the probable error reduced to angular measure by multiplying it by the factor ~- The fourth column indicates that for all sec u stars of declination less than 58° the bisections were about equally accurate, expressed in angular measure, but that for the extremely slow stars of greater declination included in the last two groups the bisections are considerably more accurate. By inspection of Table IX, it may be seen that ·this statement also holds good for J. F. H. with the rapid speed of the driving heads.

The mean value of N for J. F. H. with the slow speed of the driving heads is 11. 7. This corresponds to the probable error of ±o".07 I for the sum of two records. For comparison with key observations the computation was made in precisely the same manner for the forty time sets involved in the determination of the difference of longitude of Charleston and Key West in 1896 by Assistants Sinclair and Putnam, two observers of long experience. The probable error of the sum of two records was for that work found to be ±o".077. This is in substantial agreement with thevalue shown above, ±o".07 I for the transit micrometer.
MOST FAVORABLE SP:itED OF DRIVING HRADS.

If the speed of the driving heads is made very great, the observer will have difficulty in making the moving line keep up with the moving star image, and this difficulty will be greater for the fast-moving equatorial stars· than for others. The errors of bisection expressed in angular measure should be considerably greater for equatorial stars than for slow-moving stars under these conditions. If the speed of the driving heads is made very small, there will be no difficulty in keeping up with any star. A given error in the position of the driving heads at any instant will produce, however, a much larger displacement of the movable line in the field of vie~ than when the driving heads are geared to move much more rapidly. The consequent difficulty in placing the movable line in a desired position will tend to

APPENDIX NO. 8.

TEST OF A TRANSIT MICROMETER.

475

produce errors of bisection of about the same magnitude expressed in angular measure for all declinations,* and the size of the errors will tend to increase as the speed of the driving heads is made slower. In selecting the speed of the driving heads to be used the problem is, then, to avoid difficulty in keeping up with equatorial stars on the one hand and to avoid losing accurate control of the moving line for stars of any declination on the other hand. Tables V, VI, and VIII indicate clearly that the change from the relatively rapid speed of 2.4 seconds per revolution to the much slower speed of 4.8 seconds per revolution has produced a change in the average accuracy which is almost too small to be appreciable. This indicates that the slower speed is not too slow. It is somewhat surprising that so large a change in speed of the driving heads bas so little effect on the accuracy. Table VII indicates that the errors expressed in angular measure are no larger for the fast than for the slow stars with the slower of the two speeds for the driving heads, and that therefore this speed of the driving heads is not too fast. Table X confirms this conclusion if the last two groups be ignored.. If these be considered, Table X furnishes a slight indication that the speed of the driving heads should be still further decreased. The proper conclusion from this test, taken as a whole, seems to be that the speed of the_ driving heads most favorable to accuracy is slig}ltly slower than one revolution in 4.8 seconds for equatorial stars, and that a considerable departure on either side from this speed would have very little effect on the accuracy.
NUMBER OF RECORDS NEEDED FOR EACH STAR.

If one secures a large number of records on the chronograph for a star, the process of taking the mean eliminates to a considerable extent the effect of the accidental errors in the separate records, but has no effect on the errors 'which !ire common to all the records. The decision as to the number of records necessary per star depends, therefore, primarily on the relative magnitude of these two classes of errors. The probable error of the sum of two records for J. F. H. for the slower speed is ±o".07r. (Seep. 474.) The probable error of the mean of the thirty-six records for any star as computed from this is ±o".008. The probable error of this mean as computed from the residuals of each star from the mean of the set, and thus including angular errors which are common to all the records for the given star, is ±o".063. Evidently the number of records may be reduced far below thirty-six with but little decrease in the accuracy of the work. If twenty records are used the probable error of the mean as computed by the first of the above methods will be ±o".or r, and if ten are used, ±o".016. This indicates that ten lines only might be used with little decrease in average accuracy. Under very unfavorable conditions, with faint or plurred star images, or very irregular refraction, with ten lines, the uueliminated errors of bisection might contribute the major portion of the errors in the mean, although under average conditions they would not. The writer believes that for this reason, and for others which can not be briefly explained, it is best to use twenty records per star.
*The effect uf variable refraction and of instability of instrument will also tend to produce errors of the sanie angular magnitude regardless of the declination.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

INFLUENCE OF ERRORS OF RIGHT AsCENSION ON THE RESULTS OF THE TEST.

The right ascensions of the stars used in the test were all taken from the Berliner Jahrbuch, and are therefore all well determined. The total number of different stars used was large, about one hundred. Moreover, the effect of the errors of right ascension upon the computed relative personal equation was eliminated, in part at least, by the practice of having the observer, J. F. H., who observed every night, take, as a rule, stars of even numbers on the list on about half of the nights and stars of odd numbers on the remaining nights. The effect of errors of right ascension upon the results is therefore almost entirely eliminated from the mean values of the relative personal equation for those pairs of observers who observed on several nights. In general, the errors of right ascension have increased the range of the results, but have had little effect upon the means. For every star for which the residual on any night was as great as o·. 15, the residuals for all the nights were tabulated. There were fifty-one such stars. The mean ~esidual for each star, which is the best value which can be derived from these observations for the error of right ascension for that star, was less than o". 10 in a.ll but nine cases out of fifty-one. There was but one case in which it was greater than o".13. ·In this case it was o". 16. A careful examination indicates that, except for these nine stars out of about one hundred, the errors in right ascension were too small to be detected with certainty by the observations. The greatest error in the relative personal equation derived from a pair of time sets due to errors of right ascension is probably not greater than o".02, and in most cases is probably much less than this. It is a curious fact, of which no explanation is apparent, that eight of the nine stars for which a small error in right ascension was detected were stars which culminate north of the zenith.
NUMBER OF NIGHTS NECESSARY TO SECURE THR REQWRRD DRGRRR OF ACCURACY.

Let it be assumed that the required degree of accuracy is that which was obtained in the primary longitude net of the United States. In other words, let it be assumed that the future work is to be done with such accuracy that, if a longitude net were developed and adjusted, the corrections to the separate lines found to· be necessary would be of the same magnitude as those in the present primary longitude>net. The results of the test indicate that the possible relative persona:! equation between two .observers which is liable to be encountered is so small that its possible variation ·may be left out of consideration. The test also indicates that there is no appreciable systematic error of any kind involved in transit micrometer observations. The problem in hand is, then, to determine how many nights of observation are necessary to reduce the effects of accidental errors to the required limit. From the fact set forth on pages 469 and 470, that the probable error of observation of a single star is from 50 pel'. cent to 100 per cent greater with the transit micrometer than with the key, it might appear that from twenty to forty nights of observation would be necessary with the transit micrometer to secure the same degree of accuracy as was obtained from ten nights of observation with a key in the telegraphic longitude net. . ·

APPENDIX NO. 8.

TEST OF A TRANSIT MICROMETER.

477

Such a conclusion is deceptive for the reason that in observations with the key, though the accidental errors are quickly reduced to within very narrow limits, there remajns in the mean result for a night, and even in the mean result for a pair of stations, constant errors, which are apparently independent of the accidental errors and are much larger than the accidental errors. These constant errors are supposed to be mainly due to variations in the relative personal equation of the two observers. Thus* in observations with a key the probable error in the result for a night arising from accidental errors of observation, and therefore capable of further elimination by increased observation, is upon the average ±0 1 .013; while the error peculiar to each night, and therefore not capable of elimination by increasing the number of observations per night, is ±01 .022; and the constant error peculiar to each longitude determination, and· not capable of elimination by increasing the number of nights per station, is ±o".022. These are values derived from the adjustment of the telegraphic longitude net of the United States. It thus appears that the principal errors in the mean of ten nights of observation with a key are of the constant kind. The accidental errors are relatively insignificant. The probable error of the difference of° longitude of two stations connected by a land line and determined by ten nights of observation, including all three of the above classes of errors, is for the primary longitude.net ±o".025. If it be assumed that the errors in a transit micrometer determination of difference of longitude are all of the accidental class, the result from a single night's observations of 20 to 24 stars at each station will have a probable error of from ±o".020 to :::1;:0".027. The value of ±o".020 is based upon the probable error of ±o".o63, derived from observations by J. F. H. with the slow speed of the driving heads; and the probable error ± 1 .027 is based upon the probable error ±o".084 for a singl~ observation for other qbservers than J. F. H. and with both speeds of the driving heads. On this basis it then appears that a pair of observers, either experienced or inexperien5=ed, would secure as accurate a determination of, a difference of longitude from a single night of observation with a transit micrometer as has been obtained, as a rule, from ten nights of observation with a key. It is to be expected, however, that in regular longitude work the differen~e in atmospheric conditions at the two stations, the possible unknown interposition of repeaters in the telegraph line between stations, the irregular running of chronometers, and perhaps other conditions -which have not operated to influence this test of the micrometer, may introduce additional errors ~f both the accidental and the constant class. It is the opinion of the writer that such additional errors will be so small that it is· safe to· predict that three nights of observation without exc.hange of observers will give as great accuracy as has been secured from ten nights of observation with the key, including an . exchange of observers. This is a prediction of which the truth or falsity can only be proved conclusively by field experience. The writer relies upon such experiense to be gained within the next teri years to verify the prediction.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.

The principal conclusions from this test of the transit micrometer are: ( 1) That the relative person::i,l equation between any two observers with the transit micrometer is so small as to be masked by the accidental errors of observation. This is equivalent to saying that it is probably less in every case than o".050, and is as a rule much smaller than this. The relative personal equation with a transit micrometer is certainly not more than one-tenth as large upon the average as with a key. This conclusion as to the relative personal equation applies to inexperienced as well as experienced observers. (2) The speed of 4.8 seconds per revolution for the driving heads of the transit micrometer, for an equatorial star, is the most favorable for accuracy, or possibly a slightly slower speed. (3) Very li~tle loss in accuracy will result from reducing the number of records per star from 36, as in the present instrument, to 20. Such a reduction should be made to save time in reading the chronograph sheets. (4) It is predicted that three nights of observation with a transit micrometer and without exchange of observers will probably secure the same grade of accuracy as has been obtained from ten nights of observation with a key, and including an exchange of observers. Each night of observation is supposed to include two time sets, or 20 stars for each observer. Aside _from these conclusions the following items of information secured during the test are interesting and important: I. For a practiced observer with a transit micrometer, the total error for a star, includingerrors which are constant for all the records as well as the accidental errors of bisection, is for the slower speed of the driving heads nearly the same for stars of all declinations, if expressed in angular measure. This is what should be expected if the errors concerned are of the same nature as if the object pointed upon were stationary instead of being a moving star. 2. For both the speeds used and for a practiced observer, the accidental errors of bisection are nearly the same, expressed in angular measure, for stars of all declinations up to 58 °, and are probably somewhat l~ for stars of greater declination .. This is an indication that the accidental errors of bisection are of the same nature as if the image · pointed upon were stationary, the conclusion being partially contradicted by the smaller errors for stars of declination greater than 58°. · 3. Good observations can be secureJ at once with the transit micrometer without previous practice. Mo.re practice simply reduces the accidental errors by about 25 per cent. 4. One incidental advantage of a transit micrometer not commented upon heretofore in this report is that the observations may be made much more rapidly with it than with a key. With a key about ten stars per hour may be observed conveniently. With a transit micrometer sixteen stars per hour can with equal convenience be observed. The list used during this test contains sixteen stars per hour. This advantage results from taking all the observations for an equatorial star in less than ten seconds instead of scattering them over an interval, for instance, 30 seconds or more, when observing with a key.

5. Each record on the chronograph is made too soon by the interval required for the micrometer head to turn, for that particular star, through -an angle corresponding to one-half th~ effective width of the contact strips on the micrometer head. The effective contact width was directly determined at the close of the test. The half contact width was found to be, expressed in time, 0 1 .010 seco. Any lost motion in the micrometer also tends to make the record on the chronograph occur too soon. An unsuccessful attempt was made to determine the lost motion. · The attempt showed that the lost.motion is so small that it would require special devices to measure it. In conclusion the writer wishes to bear testimony to the excellence of the design of the instrument. During the test no defects of any kind have been found, even in this experimental instrument. Not a single record has ever been lost from the chronograph sheet during the whole of the test because of failure of action of the transit micrometer part of the apparatus. On account of the perfect action of the cut-out switch, which insures that none but the required records shall appear on the chronograph sheet, the identification of the record on the sheets is no more difficult than for · a key record.
LITERATURE OF THE TRANSIT MICROMETER.

In the following paragraphs is shown the literature which was used in reaching the conclusions stated in this Appendix. These are not intended to constitute a complete bibliography of the subject. They are printed here simply as an indication of the history of the development of the transit micrometer as an instrument for use in the telegraphic determination of differences of longitude, The short abstract made of each ~rticle shows simply the more important points in the article considered from this point of view. · Das Passagen-Mi'krometer, Le,:Pzig, I865, von Carl Br_aun, S. ].-This is the publication referred to on page 456 as being the first suggestion of the observation of transits 'with a movable micrometer line.

Published in Astronomiscke Nachrz'cliten No. 2940, Band I2J.-In this paper Doctor Repsold describes a hand-driven transit micrometer constructed by him, and gives the results of certain tests. The tests were ma?e by the laboratory method-that is, by pointing upon a near moving mark instead of a star, the mark being made to record automatically its true position, and the whole constituting a special form of personal-equation apparatus. Two.driving heads were used, one for each hand. The driving heads made one revolution in 3.85 seconds .. The test demonstrated that no clockwork was necessary to enable an observer to keep a mark bisected continuously with a transit micrometer with the high degree of accuracy necessary to make the instrument valuable in 'observations of star transits. The largest personal equation developed on any of the tests is 0 1 .021 and the mean of the six tests gives for the personal equation of the observer 0 1 .002. Verkandlungen der vom I5. bis 2I.

tests upon stars, in which, with six combinations of observers, the largest relative personal equation discovered with the hand-driving transit micrometer was only some hundredths of a second (hochtens einige hundertstel Secunden), wherea!? the maximum relative personal equat-i.on between the same observers with the key method of observation was 0 1 .32. The driving heads of this transit micrometer made one revolution in 5.8 seconds for an equatorial star. As to accidental errors, he stated that the probable error of a single registration was about the same with the transjt micrometer as with the key. Ueber ei1iige Versuche von Durcligangsbeobachtungen nach dem neuen Repsold'schen Veifahren. Von Prof. E. Becker, Marz, I89I. Publt'shed in Astronomisclie Nachricliten, No. 3036, Band I27.-This paper gives the results of certain tests made with a Repsold hand-driven transit micrometer mounted on a transit of 2 ~ inches aperture of the broken telescope type. The transit was furnished with a group of five fixed lines on each side of the center of the field of view, the middle 36 seconds of the field being left clear for the use of the transit micrometer. Ten of the contacts observed with the transit micrometer on each star were used in the computation. Four observers took part in the tests, which extended over four nights. On each night the relative personal equations of the four observers were determined by the half-transit method with a key in each of the 6 possible combinations of obser\rers, using from 6 to 9 stars for each determination. By the '' half-transit method '' is meant that one person observed the transit of the star across one-half of the fixed lines in the field of view, and immediately afterwards another person observed the transit of the same star across the remaining fixed lines, or across the same lines in the reverse order, after reversing the telescope. On the same night each person observed from 5 to 15 other stars (usually 6) by both the key and the transit micrometer method, and thus determined the difference of his personal equations by the two methods. From the5e observations the relative personal equations of the observers corresponding to the transit micrometer observations as well as the key observations were derived. The obser\red relative personal equations for the six combinations of observers were as follows:

The values in either the second or the third line of the table are so small as to be possibly simple errors of observation. Increased experience apparently reduced the relative personal equations with the transit micrometer as the values in the third line are each, with one exception, smaller than the correspondfog values in the second line. As to accidental errors, it was shown that the mean error of a single registration with the transit micrometer for each of the observers, B., H., K., and Z., respeetively, was ±01 .107, ±01 .104, ±01 .117, and ±01 .122; and the mean error of observation of a single line with the key method was, for the four observers, respectively ±01 .084,

±o".086, ±o".085, and ±o".092. With both the key and the transit micrometer the accuracy increased from night to night with accumulated practice, but the.increase was greater with the transit micrometer than with the key. Professor Becker concluded .that with the transit micrometer the relative personal equation was either eliminated entireiy or reduced to a small quantity. In connection with the slightly larger accidental errors with the transit micrometer he called attention to the facts that the observers were unskilled in the use of the transit micrometer, that there was an appreciable increased resistance to the motion of the micrometer head at the contact points, and that the micrometer screw had but a single driving head. He states that the transit micrometer is not well adapted to observations on faint stars. Die Anwendung des Repsold'scken Mikrometers bei Beohaclitungen im I. Vertical nack der Struve'schen Methode.

Transit II had an aperture of 68 millimeters and a focal length of 87 centimeters. The corresponding values for Transit III were 81 millimeters and 92 centimeters, respectively. The driving heads made one revolution in eight seconds for an equatorial star. Four observers determined their relative personal equations wlth a key on three _ nights in August and September, 1890. The determinations were made in all six possible combinations, by twos, of the four observers. Six determinations were made on each night, or 18 in all. These same observers similarly determined their relative personal ~quations, using the transit micrometer, in March, 1891, on three nights, making 8 determinations on each night. The resulting mean values of the relative personal equations were:. ·

In the first determination of the difference of longitude between Berlin and Potsdam two observers worked at each end of the line, so that each night's results depended upon four observers. Observations were taken on I2 nights. Three sets of I2 stars each were observed on each night. On each polar star one observer took one good revolution, or IO contacts, on the first half of the transit, and then, after reversing the instrument, the other observer took IO contacts. On the remaining stars in the settime stars-each observer took 20 contacts, or two complete revolutions, one observing before the star reached the middle of the field and the other afterwards, without any reversal of the instrument between their observations. The maximum residual of any one of the I2 determinations of the difference of longitude from the mean was 0.072 second. The probable error of the mean of the I 2 values is ±0.009 second. The relative personal-equations of-the. four observers, as derived from the longitude observations and used in tpeir reduction, were A.-B. =-o·.016, A.-G. =-o·.027, A.-S. =-o·.033, B.-G. = -o".011, B.-S. =-o".0I7, G.-S. = -o".006. These values are comparable with those shown a few lines above. · The results showed systematic di~erences in the clock errors as derived separately from the two positions of the instrument, amounting to as much as o. I I 5 second. This was attributed to a difference in the collimation error for zenith stars and for polar stars. In the second determination of the difference of longitude between Berlin and Potsdam in 189I, there was but one observer at each station. The instrument was reversed during the transit of each star. On. time stars 20 contacts (two revolutions) were observed before reversal and 20 more after reversal on the same part of the screw. On polar stars 20 contacts in all were observed, IO before and 10 after reversal. The regular programme consisted of three sets of 6 stars each at each station on each night. Observations were made on nine nights. The maximum residual of any one of the longitude determinations from the mean of the nine was o· .033. The probable error of the mean was ±o".005. The relative personal equation of the two observers, as derived from the longitude observations, was B.-S. = - o".oI 3. The difference between the mean values of the difference Berlin-Potsdam from this sour~e and from the observations earlier in the year was o".020, a quantity within the allowable limit as deduced from the computed probable errors of the two results. On the three determinations of differences of longitude between the stations Ubagsberg, Bonn, and Gottingen, I893, the methods of observations were practically the same as in the Berlin-Potsdam determination, except that more care was taken to use the same part of the screw before and after reversing on each polar star, and that on time stars IO contacts only, both before and after reversal-that is, the alternate contacts on two revolutions-were used in the computation, or 20 contacts in all. The regular programme at each station on a night consisted of two sets of 12 or I3 stars each. The observations were made on IO or I 1 nights at each pair of stations. For the three determinations the three maximum residuals of any night from the mean were o.·.044 and o".056 and o".03r. The probable errors of the mean results were ±o".007, ±o".006, and ±o".004. The closing error of the longitude triangle formed by the three determinations was o".038, almost too large to be accounted for by the computed probable errors. The closure was attributed mainly to various unfavorable conditions encountered on two of the lines.

TEST OF A TRANSIT MICROMETER.

The values of the combined personal and instrumental equation from these three determinations were o·.009, o·.019, and o".034. In the earlier longitude determinations the exchange of instruments between stations was made in such a way that each observer used each instrument a part of the time and the computation was so made as to separate the personal and instrumental equations. On the three determinations here dealt with each observer took his own instrument with him whenever he moved, and a separation of the personal and instrumental equations by computation was not possible. The following comparison was given of the mean error of observation of a single star in the 1893 longitude determination made with the transit micrometer and the corresponding value by the key method:

It was also shown that the instrumental ~rrors, azimuth and inclination, were determined more accurately with the transit micrometer than with the key method. The introduction of the transit micrometer was characterized as an important forward step in longitude determinations. Neue Mikrometer, von A. Repsold und Sohne. Von j. Repsold. 8 Juli, r896.

It was applied to the meridian circle of the Washburn Observatory and used in the observations for stellar parallax by the method of meridian transits. The aperture of the telescope of this instrument is 12.2 centimeters .. The driving heads made one revolution in 18.9 seconds for an equatorial star. The probable error of a single contact for an equatorial star was ±0.030 seconds, the same as for observations with the same instrument with a key. For bisections both a single line and parallel lines, o·. 70 apart, were tried, and gave equally good results. The double lines were adopted for regular use. Vero.ffentlichung des Konig!.

The probable errors .of the mean results were ±o".006 and ±o".005, respectively. The values of the combined personal and instrumental equation were o".034 and 0·:033 from the two determinations.

Von Prof T!z. Albrecht, Miirz, I90I. Published in Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 3699, Band I55.-This is a general critical account of the results secured with transit micrometers in the determinations of longitude by the Prussian Geodetic Institute treated in the foregoing references. Among the facts set forth in regard to the transit micrometer arei that the relative personal equations are reduced to a tenth of their former values and presumably a corresponding reduction has been made in their variations; that variability of personal equation must be regarded as the principal source of error in longitude work with a key; that with the transit micrometer the observations of separate stars may follow each other at much shorter intervals than with a key; that the accuracy of a single contact with the transit micrometer is greater at any declination than that of a single line with a key; that the instrumental errors are determined more accurately when a transit ~icrometer is used than when fixed lines and a key are used; and that, whereas the mean error. of the result for a night as computed from ,the residuals of the various nights from the mean was from ±01 .043 to ±o".o64 during ·1883:-1889 with the key method of observation, it was from ±o".020 to ±o".026 with the transit micrometer method of observation in 1893, 1898, and 1900.

The observer corrects the bisection from time to time as necessary by increasillg or decreasing the speed at which the micrometer is driven.

Von Prof. Dr. K. Oertel, Mimchen, An:fang Dezember I903. Published in Astronomiscke Nac11rickten, No. 3942-3, Band I65.-This article contains a full statement of the data in regard to a hand~driven transit micrometer attached to the Repsold Meridian Circle at the Munich Observatory, obtained during its use for five nights in determining the right ascension of fundamental stars. A detailed description of the instrument in volume 4 of "Neuen Annalen der Miinchener Stemwarte '' is referred to. All observations were made with a magnifying power of 270. The 3 089 observations, 430 by Professor Bauschinger and the remainder by Professor Oertel, failed to show the existence of a relative personal equation as large as o".001. A thorough investigation failed to discover any systematic errors depending up6n the magnitude of the star or the position of the instrument. Professor Oertel states in regard to advantages of the transit micrometer that, in contrast to the almost unavoidable nervous strain with the key, after suitable practice the screw of the micrometer is turned with absolute calmness; that more stars per hour

may be observed with a transit micrometer than with a key, and that the accurac..y of observation is greater than with a key. He states that in the winter months he has often, on several nights in succession and for six or seven hours uninterruptedly on each night, observed with the handdriven transit micrometer without experiencing any other weariness than that due to the work in general. An investigation of 224 stars by the use of a reversing prism in the eyepiece indicated a very small error, less than o".005, which is systematic with respect to the direction of motion. The mean error of a single contact, reduced to the equator, .was found to be ±o".042. The mean error of a single contact increased gradually with decreasing brightness of stars from ±o".034 for third magnitude stars to ±o".052 for stars of the seventh to eighth magnitude. These particular computed values depend upon an investigation .of 70 stars. The mean error of a single contact reduced to the equator (that is, multiplied by the cosine of the declination) decreased slightly as the . declinations increased, as shown by the following table, which is condensed from the more extensive table given in the article.

In other words, the mean error of a contact expressed in angular measures varies from about ±011 .70 for stars of about declination 45° to' less than ±o".45 for close circumpolar stars. Ergebnisse von Beobachtungen am Repsold' schen Registrirmikrometer bei Anwendung eines Uhrz!!e1·ks. Von Dr. Fritz Cohn, I2. November, I90I. Published in Astronomiscke NachricMen, No. 3766-3767, Band I57.-This is an account of an investigation made with the clock-driven Repsold transit micrometer mounted on a meridian circle telescope at Konigsburg, having a 4-inch objective. The observations were made on 14 nights in July, 1901, from 28 to 94 stars being observed each night, or about 1000 observations in all. Two observers took part in each night's work and the programme was such as · to give a strong determination of their relative personal equation. The clockwork and its counterweight weighed 3 kilograms. No evidence, although it was very thoroughly searched for, could be found that the relative personal equation of the two observers varied during the observations on any night, or from night to night, during the period July 1-22, over which the observations extended. The mean value

TEST OF A TRANSIT MICROMETER.

of the relative personal equation derived from all the observatfons was C.-P. = -o".022 ±o".002. The values from the separate nights all fell within the range -o".010 to -o".033, w~ich is fully accounted for by the computed probable errors. A special investigation was made to determine a possible relation between the relative personal equation and the magnitude of the stars observed. The relative personal equation was apparently independent of the magnitude. For all stars down to magnitude 8.3 the accuracy of the observations seemed to be independent of the magnitude. For stars fainter than this the accuracy was somewhat decreased. The author suggests that the inability to observe very faint stars is a slight defect in the transit micrometer method of observation. All these stars were confined to a comparatively narrow zone "in declination and hence no investigation of the relation be~ween the accuracy of the observations and the declinations was feasible. The mean error of the observed transit of a star, from the whole series of observation, reduced to the equator, was ±o".019. In commenting upon this value in comparison with other observations with this and similar instruments without the transit micrometer, it is stated that the transit micrometer observations must be credited with twice the weight of the best observations by other methods. The observations are remarkable for their nearly complete freedom from systematic error of any kind as well as for their extremely small accidental etrors. Doctor Cohn states that the clockwork driving apparatus makes the observing much easier than it otherwise would be. The following table shows, for the longitudes determined with transit micrometers by th~ Prussian Geodetic Institute during the period 1891-1903, the mean error of a single contact, or signal, and the manner in which said mean error varies with the declination. The table shows the values of a and bin the formula m= t'a"+b" sec·o in which mis the mean error of a single contact and a and b are constants determined from the observations.

GitNERAL STATEMENT.

The purpose of this Appendix is twofold: first, to set forth fully in convenient form the results of the primary triangulation near the western coast of the United States from Point Arena, California, to the Mexican boundary; second, to produce for the use of the engineer, and on United States Standard Datum, the. geographic positions, not only of the primary stations, but also of all stat.ions of the minor triangulations controlled by this primary scheme. and lying south of Monterey Bay. The descriptions and elevations are also printetl for all stations whose positions are here published, whether primary or tertiary, wherever available. The accomplishment of the first purpose was comparatively easy, because, at the time of his death in 1901 Assistant c!. A. Schott had in progress a complete report on · this triangulation. In addition to the assistance of Mr. Schott's notes, the Chief of tlie Computing Division and several of its members have taken part in the preparation uf this Appendix. Miss Lilian Pike, assisted by Mr. C. R. Duvall, made the least square adjustments of the primary work; and Miss Pike also directed the preparation of the descriptions. ' The engineer, intent only upon securing the necessary information to enable him to extend this triangulation or base other sunreys upon it, will find the information be desires in the latter part of the Appendix, commencing with the explanation of positions, lengths, and azimuths. The index of positions, descriptions, and elevations used in connection ~ith the sketches at the end of the Appendix will enable him to find quickly the data he desires for any given locality.

THE PRIMARY TRIANGULATION.

The earlier field work of the Survey along the western coast of the United States was carried on under peculiar circumstances. The great and sudden influx of miners and adventurers into California from about 1849 onward made it the first duty of the Survey for many years to provide for the safety of navigation, as far as its means allowed, by means of coaet and harbor surveys, the mapping of rocks, shoals, reefs, and other dangers to navigation, and the prompt publication of such intelliget,lce in the form of charts. Much of this work necessarily had to be done hurriedly, and was consequently largely of a temporary character. Astronomic expeditions were organized and the positions of many prominent points were roughly determined, particularly
495

COAST "AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904·

during the years from 1850 to 1853; besides, small or .local triangulations were made at a number of places; but it was not until a much later date that systematic surveys were attempted. The latitudes were determined by means of zenith telescopes and the longitudes by means of transits and of transportation of chronometers. The various expeditions to the northward and southward pf San Francisco were ultimately connected with that central station. The longitudes of a number of stations were determined from observations of moon culminations, collected and referred to San Francisco for the purpose of fixing upon a standard geodetic longitude to be employed for all the surveys in California. From the beginning much difficulty was experienced in getting acceptable standard geodetic values for latitude ·and longitude, owing to the diVersity in the directions and magnitudes of the local deflection of the vertical. This difficulty was eliminated by the adoption of a standard datum for the whole United States.* The treatment of the astronomic determinations will be left for some future date. At the present time the results of primary triangulation are available on nearly onehalf of the western coast of the United States exclusive of Alaska. This triangulation, at the northern end directly connected with the transcontinental arc in latitude 39°, binds together the positio'ns in this latitude and those along the line of the Mexican boundary. A primary triangulation'is now in progress which will connect the positions along Juan de Fuca Strait, Washington, with this triangulation at its junction with the transcontinental arc. The primary triangulation spreads over the crest lines of the coast ranges, which ·form the western rim of the great California baiin. At the Santa Barbara Channel . the triangulation takes an abrupt bend, and follows the coast to the Mexican boundary. T~e distance along a great circle from Point.Arena Light-house to the Initial Monument on the Pacific of the Mexican boundary is 8°21'.85, or 501.85 nautical miles (577.9 statute miles); the azimuth of ~he light-house from the monument is 141° 59'.3, and the reverse azimuth at the light-house is 318° 06'.8. The triangulation includes two primary base lines, namely, the Yolo Base, measured in 1881, and the Los Angeles Base, measured in 1888 and 1889; both. are long bases, each nearly 17~ kilometers in length, and they were found to be in excellent accord.
THJt UNIT OF LENGTH OF THE; TRIANGULATION.

This triangulation depends for its distances on the length of the Committee Meter, an iron bar standardized at Paris in 1799, one of the original French meters, and which , was brought to America in 1805 by Superintendent Hassler. It fell into disuse after the receipt by the Survey of the new national .prototype meters in 1890, t Its history, and results of many comparisons for defining. its length in terms of the International Prototype Meter, are given at length in Part I of "The Transcontinental Triangulation and the American Arc of the Parallel, Special Publication No. 4. Washington, D. C., 1900." The length of this Committee Meter, from the comparisons of .1799. 1867, 1889, 1894-g5, and 1896, is found to be equal to the International Prototype Meter, with a probable error of .about three-fourths of a micron.

A.ND LENGTH OF THE Los ANGELES BAsit ·LrN:it, CALIFORNIA,· 1888-89.

Location of tlze base line.·-The line is on the so-called L9s Angeles plains, partly in Los Angeles County and partly in Orange County, about IO miles (or 16 kilometers) from the shore of San. Pedro Bay and roughly parallel with it. The necessary reconnaissance was made in 1886 by Assistants J. S. Lawton and E. F. Dickins and SubAssistant F. Morse. The final selection of the terminal points was made by Assistant G. Davidson in 1888. Southeast Base is about 173 miles (or 2.7 k.ilometers) south of the southwestern part of the town of Anaheim, in latitude 33° 47'.5 and in longitude 0 l p 56'.6. Northwest Base is about l mile east of the town of Norwalk, on a slight ridge, in latitude 33° 55'.o and longitude u8° 03'.5. · The base is very nearly 17.5 kilometers (or 10.9 statute miles) in length and the observed azimuths at Southeast Base and at Northwest Base are respectively 142° 37'.o and 322° 33'.2, making the inclination of the base with the meridian at its middle point about 37° 25'. r. No attempt was made to grade the line, except in six cases where sand and clay hammocks were cut through and by the removal of tussocks and coarse giass. The ground over w4ich the base passes is a broad plain with occasional slight ridges of only a few feet elevation, rising gradually toward both ends from the crossing of the Southern Pacific Railroad at Coyote Creek. The elevation of Northwest Base above the mean tidal level of the Pacific was determined by a double line of spirit levels (forward and backward), from the United States Engineer's benGh mark at San Pedro,.executed by Assistant I. Winston in May, l 890. No record of leveling along the base could be found, so the height of the bars at every 100 meters was determfoed by means of the sector readings during the second and third measurements of the base. line. These ~perations gave the follO\ying heights ahove mean tidal level, viz, of the Northwest Base (copper bOlt), 127.961 feet or 39.003 meters; of Southeast Base (upper bolt), 107.271 feet or 32.696 meters; of base bars, average for whole line, 88.778 feet ±0.475 feet or 27.000 meters ±o. 145 meters. · Marking of the base ends.-A brick and cement foundation, extending 60 inches below the sUJ:face, 72 inches square at the bottom and 54 inches square at the top, supported a granite block, 26 inches cube, the top surface of which was flush with the top of the foundation and wit4 the surface 'of the ground. A copper bolt in the center of the top surface of this block had a piece of silver wire driven into its head, and a hole made in the end of 'this wire with fine needle marked the end of the base. A granite block, 3 feet long and l foot square, similarly marked, was ·set with its top surface several inches .below the bottom of the found~tion as a subsurface. mark. · Suitable witness marks were placed, two in the line of the base Md two at tight angles thereto at distances of 10 and loo feet. A stone with a copper bolt was set in line at the end of each half kilometer from Southeast Base except in three cases where the nature of the ground 'prevented, in which cases it was set at the end of a succeeding even bar where. the conditions were favorable. When the ends of the base were occupied as triangulation stations in 1890 brick towers were ereded, 35 feet hig}i at Southeast Base and 1 5 fee"t high at Northeast Base. Measurement of the base line.-The work was in charge of Assistant G. Davidson. His party arrived at Camp Colonna, near the middle of the base, October 16, 1888. ·A

preliminary measurement of the base line was made December I and 3 by Messrs. Nel~ son and Westdahl with a 100-meter steel wire, with the resulting length 17 494.53 meters. The measurement with the bars ~gan December 13 and was completed February 15, 1889. The base was measured three times (with a fourth measure of the last half kilometer) with the 5-meter compensating base bars, first used in the measurement of the Yolo Base in November, 1881. A full description of this apparatus is given in Appendix 7 of the Report for 1882. Each bar is composed of two metals, steel and zinc, joined in such a way as to nearly compensate for changes of temperature. Contact is made by means of contact-slide pieces. The first measurement of the base was delayed by rains and the consequent accumulation of water in low places along the line, but was completed in 22 working days. The second measurement, made in the opposite direction to that of the others, required 15 and the third 13 working days. The party consisted of Assistant George Davidson, chief of party; J. S. Lawson, Assistant; F. Morse, Sub-Assistant; John Nelson, Aid; F. Westdahl, Draftsman; F. W. Edmonds, Recorder, and 17 men, of whom I I took part in the actual work of measurement. Appendix 10 of the Report for 1889 gives a detailed account of the various operations of the measurement of the Los Angeles Base Line and the duties assigned to the various · members of the party. Computation ef the lengtlz ef tlze base.-The field computation was made by SubAssistant F. Morse; the office computation by D. L. Hazard. In the computation: and discussion of the Yolo Base Line, Appendi:l.{ 11 of the Report for 1883, the conclusion was reached th_at the lengths of base bars change slightly with the temperature and can not even be assumed as constant at the same temperature at different times. Accordingly observations were made both before and after the measurement of the Los Angeles Base to determine the effect of temperature on the length of the base bars, and the bars were compared twice each morning, before beginning work on the line, with the stapdard 5-meter bar No. II (Field Standard). The resulting length was used for the work of the day after being corrected for the difference between the temperatures of comparisons and of the base measuring. The length of the 5-meter Field Standard No. II and its coefficient of expansion were determined in 1881-82-83 with the result: Length of No. II= 5m +I 163.0µ + 57.47µ (t-r7°.07C). ± 2.I ± .21· For particulars see Appendix 7, Report for 1882. From that_ appendix are taken also the following values of one revolution of the micrometer of Fauth & Co. comparators: Comparator No. III=254.528µ+0.002µ (t-~o°C).

The quantities in the last column are to be applied to the mean of the readings of the four (Green) thermometers, Nos. 4524, 4525, 4522, and 4523. In measuring the fractional part of a bar length at Northwest Base, the second meter of a 3-meter steel rod was used. The length is given in Appendix 11, Report for 1883, as r meter+ r r.2 ,µ (t+13°.78 C). To ascertain the effect of temperature on the base bars, hourly comparisons were made for three days (of twenty-four hours) at Lafayette Park, San Francisco, parts of two days at Middle Base (Camp Colonna) and parts of two days at Southeast Base before measuring the base, and for parts of three days at Camp Colonna after the base measure. Owing to the small range of temperature, and conditions differing in other respects from those during the base measure, no use has been made of the San Francisco comparisons. From the daylight observations at the base on six days, three before and three after the measurement of the base, are deduced six values for the outstanding coefficient of expansion of each bar, of which the· mean, 3 microns for r° C. for each bar, is used to correct the length of the bars deduced from the morning comparisons for changes of temperature during the day. All comparisons between the field standard and the base bars were made by means of the Fauth & Co. level-contact comparators No. III and IV. The results of those comparisons used in the computation are appended.

PROBABLE ERROR OF THE LENGTH OF THE BASE LINE.

The probable error of measurement of the three sections or measures reduces to the simple formul:,i. r, = 0.6745 ,J[L1 L1] in which the L1'~ are the differences of the 6 individual measures of a section from their mean. Hence r, = ±4 mm.05, which is about 1 14320000 part of the length of the base. This includes the uncertainty due to the comparisons of the bars with the standard, since each of the three measures of a section depends on a different set of comparisons. The probable error due to the uncer. tainty of± 0.4µ in the expansion coefficient of the base bars, r is± 7 mm.co. The uncertainty of the length and expansion coefficient of the field standard produces the probable errors, r 3 = ± 7 mm.35 and r 4 = ± 6mm.30, respectively. The principal part of the probable error of the base is due to the uncertainty in the length of the Committee Meter taken as ± %' micron. This gives r 5 = ± 13 mm. 12. Finally, there is the uncertainty in the reduction to sea level, r 6 = ± o mm .40. The square root of the sum of the squares of these six quantities gives finally for the probable error of the length of the base liner=± 18 mm.2, which is about 1/960000 part of the length.

TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA.

Adopted length of Los Angeles Base Line: 17494m.2387±om.0182 and its logarithm 4.242895048±0.000000452
STATEMENTS OF ADJUSTMENTS.

Local adjustments of directions were made in every case according to the methods usually employed and fully described in previous publications of the Survey.* The length of the Los Angeles Base with which this triangulation connects has already been given in preceding pages with the description of its measurement and reduction. The other base which completes the control of this triangulation is the Yolo, and has already been .completely described.t The length of the Yolo base is 17486m.5119, with a probable error of ±16mm.3, or about one part in 1073000 of its length. The lengths and relative directions of the lines of the triangle Mount TamalpaisMount Diablo-Mocho, before the adjustments herein set forth were commenced, had been fixed by the adjustment published in Special Publication No. 4, "The Transcontinental Triangulation and the American Arc of the Parallel.'' The figure adjustment was made in four sections. The first section extends from the lines of the fixed triangle Mount TamalpaisMount Diablo-Mocho to the Los Angeles base net. (See illustrations 2 and 3.) The adjustment of this- triangulation from the fixed triangle to the line San Pedro-Wilson Peak of the base net, which had been previously adjusted, involves 128 observed directions connected by 56 rigid conditions. Forty of these related to the closure of the triangles, fifteen to the ratio of sides, and the last condition was that the_ length of the line San Pedro-Wilson Peak carried through from the line Mount Diablo-Mocho of th~ Yolo base net must agree with the length computed in the Los Angeles base net. The second section comprises the Los Angeles base net. (See suhsketch, illustration 4.) The only fixed line in the figure was the base, and the number of observed directions involved was 20. There were 9 rigid conditions to be satisfied, 6 relating to the closures of the· triangles and 3 to the ratios of the sides. The third secti.on (shown in illustration 4) extends from the triangle San JuanSan Pedro-Wilson Peak, fixed in the base net adjustment, to the li;ie Soledad-Cuyamaca. There were 32 observed directions involved, and these were connected by 17 rigid conditions. Eleven of these conditions related to the closure of triangles and 6 to the ratios of the sides. The fourth section (shown also in illustration 4) comprises the simple quadrilateral Boundary Monument 258-Point Loma Light-house-Soledad-Cuyamaca with the fixed line Soledad-Cuyamaca. This figure involves IO observed directions requiring 4 rigid conditions. These four sections do not comprise all of the triangulation now completed in this State considered of a primary character. It, however, combined with that already published in connection with the transcontinental triangulation, will serve to control the whole triangulation. The additional primary triangulation which is shown in illustrations I to 4, in heavy lines without numbers, has been fully adjusted to be consistent with this control. The old San Pedro Base, which was measured in 1853

with 4-meter iron rods, was found defective. Efforts to remedy the· defect by a remeasurement in 1881 were unsatisfactory. Measurement was made with a 60-meter wire and the northwest terminus was not certainly recovered. The base, therefore, appears only as a line of the triangulation.
ABSTRAC'I'S OF HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONS AT THE MAIN STATIONS OF THE COAST TRIANGULATION BETWEEN THE GOLDEN GATE AND THE MEXICAN BOUNDARY.

The abstracts of the first three stations, Mount Tamalpais, Mount Diablo, and Mocho, are abbreviated from the preceding adjustment of these stations as forming part of the transcontinental triangulation.* The methods and notation used in the local or station adjustment and in the net or figure adjustment are the same as explained in the account of the arc of tlie parallel across the country. All observed directions in the triangulation have been given equal or unit weight. The probable error of a single observation, telescope direct and telescope reversed, of a direction is found from 0.455 ~ v" e ·- -~~-:-,.-' -n-s,-d+1 where n= number of observations, s= the number of series, d= the number of directions at the station, and v= the residuals. The resulting horizontal directions are reduced to the sea level, which, expressed in seconds, is given by

from the preceding abstracts of directions it may be seen that there was no uniformity among the observers as to the number of positions in which to put the horizontal circle of their instruments; thus Assistant Tittmann was satisfied with

seven, Assistant Mosman with twelve, Assistants Lawson and Dickins with thirtythree, while in one case Assistant Dayidson went to the extreme of fifty-one positions, thus shifting the circle after every series. The latter observer was also in the habit of making a half dozen, more or less, pointings with the eyepiece micrometer before reading the microscopes of the horizontal circle, in the place of the single pointing of the telescope. In this practice he was followed at some stations by A,ssistants Lawson, Dickins, and Marr who acted, in part, under his direction. It is doubtful whether much advantage was gained by the use of the eyepiece micrometer, since·the telescope is likely to be disturbed in direction by frequent handling of the screw .. The climatic influence relative to proximity of the sea and altitude of station may also be a factor in the probable error e, of a single observation of a direction, that is, with telescope direct and telescope reversed. For the coast region between the Golden Gate and the Santa Barbara Channel and for the two so-centimeter theodolites with a large number of posi_tions, from 8 stations e,=±o".60; but for the ~anta Barbara region, and inclusive of 5 stations farther toward the Mexican boundary, with a small number of positions and no eyepiece micrometer measures,. from 14 stations e,=±o".78. The values of e, for the other two smaller and older instruments are, for the 45-centimeter circle from 7 stations, ±1". 17; and for the 30-centimeter circle at the same number of stations, ±1".27. The number of series taken at a station varies greatly, depending largely on the weather encountered, in order to secure a sufficient number of pointings on every signal.
CONDITION EQUATIONS.

In the following condition equations the numbers assigned to' the directions correspond to those shown in illustrations 2 to 4. The number of a direction inclosed in parentheses, thus ( 1), means the required correction to that direction. In each set of condition equations those which refer to closures of triangles are given first, those which refer to ratios of sides next, and the length equation last. In the side and length equations the absolute term is expressed in units of the sixth decimal place of logarithms. Yolo base net to Los Angeles base net.

The maximum correction to a direction in the first section was 111 .34, to the direction from Castle Mount to San Luis. The maximum in the second section, the Los Angeles base net, was 111 .22, to the direction from San Pedro to San Juan; in the third section, r". 15, t0 the direction from Wilson Peak to Niguel, and in the fourth section, 1".31, to the direction from Point Loma Light-house (old) to Soledad. Of the5osections of triangulation of which statistics were printed in Appendix 4, Report for 1903 (pp. 870871 ), there were 17 for which the maximum correction was greater than 111 .34 and 24 for which it was less than 111 · 15, the extremes in this triangulation. The probable error of an observed direction is:
/;Ev'

·a=o.674V,-cin which ~v' is the sum of the squares of the corrections to directions and c is the number of conditions. The probable error for observed direction for each of the four sections is as follows:
Yolo base net to Los Angeles base net. ............ Los Angeles base net. ............................. Los Angeles base net to Soledad-Cuyamaca. . . . . . . . Soledad-Cuyamaca to Mexican boundary ..........
41 from 44 from 11 ±0 · 50 from ±011 · 78 from
±011 · 11 . ±0

128 directions 20 directions 32 directions 10 directions

As this is the most severe and, therefore, the best test of the accuracy of a triangulation, another reference to the statistics of the 50 sections of primary triangulation should be made. This places these four sections as serial Nos. 29, 32, 39, and 49 of that table when arranged according to their accuracy. The mean for all four sections is ±0.45, which places it as No. 33 of that list

ACCURACY AS INDICATED BY CORRECTIONS TO ANGLES AND CLOSURES OF TRIANGLES.

The correction to each angle is the algebraic sum of the corrections to two directions. In order to make it possible to study the corrections to the separate angles, they are shown in the following table for every triangle in the primary· scheme from the Yolo base net to the Mexican boundary, together with the error of closure of the triangles, the corrected spherical angles, and the spherical excess. The plus sign prefixed to the error of closure of a triangle indicates that the sum of the angles is less than 180° plus the spherical excess. The spherical excess is a convenient indication of tlie size of the triangle, since it is proportional to the area.

The accord in length between the Los Angeles Base as measured and its value as computed through the triangulation from the Yolo Base furnishes a valuable test of the accuracy of the triangulation. In solving the normal equations of the figure adjustment, the length equation was, as usual, assigned to the last place, so that the discrepancy in length, after all the conditions relating to closures of triangles and ratios of lengths had been satisfied, became known. It developed that the Los Angeles Base was longer as measured than as computed through the triangulation by an amount equivalent to forty-one, exprei;sed in terms of the seventh decimal place of logarithms, or, expressed as a ratio, TI~'U'lf· Comparing this with the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation as a standard, it develops that, of the seven similar discrepancies already published, only two are smaller.
TREATMENT OF THE SUBORDINATE TRIANGULATION.

The method of treatment of the observations by the computer may, in general, be stated briefly as foll~ws: starting from the results of the primary triangulation, whose adjustment is treated in the earlier part of this Appendix, the position of that particular

528

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

station which is connected most strongly with the main triangulation is first fixed by adjustment, taking into consideration the lines directed to it from :Primary stations as well as lines diverging from it and intersecting the latter. Should there be more than one such point, say two or more, having equal strength of connection, they are treated together in one least square adjustment. In this manner, point after point is adjusted in position, so that the sum of the squares of the corrections to the observed horizontal directions shall be a minimum, the geometrical relations of the preceding points being always considered as fixed with respect to the vari.able elements of the new point under treatment. The principal secondary and tertiary stations having thus become known in position, the less impo!tant tertiary positions are determined in the same systematic though somewhat less elaborate manner than that followed for the principal stations, but generally wi.th a least square adjustment which used only three or four lines to the point. Where more directions had been observed, each line so observed was fixed in azimuth and length by solving a triangle which had the ends of this line as two of its vertices and any one of the points, already fixed and connected directly with' these, as its third vertex. Such a triangle had two of its sides already fixed in length and the difference of the fixed directions at the third vertex made the required included angle for its solution~ The final _result of this systematic treatment may be summarized by stating that no discrepancy remains in the results themselves, and that the length and direction of any side of a triangle may be computed from any starting side, and through any series ofconnecting triangles, and yet the same results will be reached. Whenever, in the course of adjusting a chain of subordinate triangulation, it closes a loop on the primary triangulation, disclosing a discrepancy in latitude and longitude, or in latitude, longitude, azimuth, and length, a further least square adjustment of this subordinate triangulation was made to distribute this discrepancy.
ACCURACY OF THE SUBORDINATE TRIANGULATION.

Very little information is available by which the accuracy of small triangulations may be judged. It seems advisable to follow the computer in a general survey of these triangulations to disclose the discrepancies which developed, and, where a loop has been closed on the primary, the error of closur~ with a definition of the meaning of such closure. Each of the sixteen sections in which there are closed triangle;; will be treated. These sections are shown on the sketches at the end of this Appendix.
MEXICAN BOUNDARY TO POINT LA JOLLA.

All of the triangulation in this group depends for its length and azimuth on the· two lines, Soledad-Boundary Monument 258 and Soledad-Point Loma Lighthouse (old). The old San Diego Base measured in May, 1851, with four meter iron rods, was not allowed to affect the lengths of the later triangulation, and the discrepancy of 17 in the sixth decimal place of logarithms was distributed through the three triangles of 1851 adjoining the base. The greater portion of this triangulation was executed by Assistant A. F. Rodgers, who used a IO-inch Gambey repeating theodolite · and employed the method of directions. Generally two sets of directions were taken; 138 triangl_es had an average dosure of 6". I an~ a maximum of 30". 2.

APPENDIX NO. 9.

TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA.

POINT I,A JOI,I,A TO SAN MATEO POINT.

The triangulation 9f this section was all executed by Assistant A. F. Rodgers in 1886 and 1887, in the manner described in previous paragraph, and serves to join the ends of the long primary line, Soledad-Niguel, thus forming a loop of triangulation with that line. The length at the north and west end is furnished by the triangulation of the section San Mateo Point to Newport Bay and at the south and east end by the triangulation described in the previous paragraph. The length as .computed from the south was shorter than the length from the north by an amount equivalent to 108, expressed in terms of the sixth decimal place, or expressed as a ratio, 114000; 108 triangles have a mean closing error of 611 .7 and a maximum .of 36".7. The azimuth computed from the south was smaller than that from the north by 21".9. The latitude and longitude were smaller from the south than from the north by o" .352 and o".271, respectively. This is equivalent to a distance of 12.9 meters. If this narrow chain of coast triangles be considered as a straight line.as long as Soledad-Niguel, and lying at the same angle with the meridian, it would be necessary to increase the length of the line one part in 6 800, and decrease its azimuth by o".9.
SAN MATEO POINT TO NEWPORT BAY.

The triangulation of this section was in great part executed by Assistant A. F. Rodgers in 1884, the balance by Assistant A. W. Chase in 1874 and 1875. The method of repetitions was employed throughout the section; twelve repetitions were observed on each angle and several condition angles were measured; 238 triangles have a mean closing error of 611 .3 and a maximum of 25 11 .7. This section depends for its length on the line Los Cerritos-Las Bolsas of the primary scheme.
NEWPORT BAY TO POINT DUME.

The triangulation of this section was done at many different dates, from 1855 to 1899, and the method of repetitions was used almost entirely. The section depends for its control both in length and. azimuth on several lines of the' primary triangulation; 85 triangles have a mean closure of 811 .9 and a maximum of 40".3.
POINT DUME TO SANTA BARBARA.

This section comprises triangulation covering several seasons, 1862-63 and 1866 and 1867, and the observations were made by Assistant W. E. Greenwell, using the method of repetitions. The. triangles at the east end of the section depend for their length and azimuth on the two primary lines, San Buenaventura-Laguna and San Buenaventura-Chaffee. At the west end of the section the primary line Santa BarbaraSanta Cruz West provides the position, length, and azimuth. The primary line Santa Barbara-Chaffee, therefore, forms a loop of triangulation °with the smaller triangles along the coast; 42 triangles in this section which are involved in this loop have a mean closing error of 311 .2 and a.maximum of 8".9. · The length as computed from the east was longer than the length from the west by an amount equivalent to 31, expressed in terms of the sixth decimal place, or

expressed as a ratio, 1/ 14000. The azimuth computed from the east was smaller by o".2 than that from the west. The latitude from the east was larger and the longitude smaller than from the west by o".009 and o''.004, respectively. This is equivalent to a distance of only 0.295 meter. If this chain of coast triangles be considered as a straight 'line as long as Chaffee-Santa Barbara, and lying at the same angle with the meridian, it would be necessary to increase the length of the line one part in 130 ooo, and decrease its azimuth by o". l.
SANTA BARBARA TO POINT ARGUELLO.

This section of triangulation was executed in the years 1863, 1869, 1872, and 1874. At the west end the length for this section is furnished by the primary line ArguelloPoint Conception ·Light-house; and at the east end the primary line Santa Barbara-Santa Cruz West determines the length. The length as computed from the east was shorter than the length as computed from the west by an amount equivalent to 242, expressed in terms of the sixth decimal place, or, expressed as a ratio, l i 1 800. The triangulation forms a loop on the primary line Point Conception Light-house-Santa Barbara; 65 triangles involved in this loop have a mean closing error of 6".o with a maximum of 15".5. The azimuth computed from the east was smaller than that from the west by 20". The latitude and longitude were smaller than from the west by o".067 and o".329, respectively. This is equivalent to a distance of 8.65 meters. If this narrow chain of coast triangles be considered as a straight line as long as the line Point Conception Lighthouse-Santa Barbara and lying at the same angle with the meridian, it would be necessary to increase the length of the line one part in 8 200 and increase its azimuth by 4".3.
SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND.

The triangulation of this island depends for its length on the base line measured by Assistant W. E. Greenwell in 1862. This base, 807.926 meters long, was measured with the 8-meter wooden bars Nos. r and 2, and the bars tested by a standard meter scale; 33 triangles on this island have an average closure of 6 11 .2 and a maximum of 17"· l. The triangulation station Boulder was observed and computed as a primary point, though without a check on its position. The line Boulder-Harbor was considered fixed as so computed and the triangulation with its length from the 1862 base formed a loop on this line. No length and azimuth discrepancies were developed directly. The latitude and longitude.from the north and west were smaller than found at Boulder by o".250 and o".208, respectively. This is equivalent to a distance of 9.4 meters. If this narrow chain of triangles be considered as a straight line as long as Boulder-Harbor and lying at the same angle with the meridian, it would be necessary to decrease the length of the line one part in 1 500 and decrease its azimuth by 511 · 9.
SANTA CATALINA ISLAND.

The triangulation of this island depends for its length on the primary line West Peak-Catalina Peak, and on a short base line measured in 1875 by Assistant Forney, who also executed the triangulation. This base, 756.954 meters in length, was

APPENDIX NO. 9.

TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA.

53 1

measured with the 4-meter iron bars Nos. 3 and 4. The lengths of the lines on the west end of the island are controlled entirely by this base, and those of the east end by both the. base and the primary line. That is, these lengths were derived through the line Catalina Peak-Cliff, as computed from the triangle Catalina Peak-West PeakCliff, holding as fixed three parts, namely, the length of the primary line West PeakCatalina Peak, the length of the line West Peak-Cliff computed from the base, and the included angle at West Peak. Seventy-three triangles have an average closing error of 4".1 with a maximum of 12 11 .8.
SAN NICOLAS AND SANTA BARBARA ISLANDS.

The triangulation of San Nicolas Island depends for its length on a base line measured with a chain by Assistant \V. E. Greenwell in I858. This base is 77r.26 meters long. The position and azimuth for the triangulation come through the station San Nicolas, observed from the primary stations Anacapa and Santa Barbara Island; 19 triangles on this island have an average closing error of 8". 6 and a maximum of 35". r. On Santa Barbara Island, Assistant A. \V. Chase measur~d with a 20-meter chain a base 600.00 meters in length, which is ample to control the few triangles of the island. The position and azimuth come from the primary station, Santa Barbara Island.
SANT A CRUZ ISLAND.

The length of the primary line New San Miguel-Santa Cruz West supplies the length for the triangulation of Santa Cruz Island. The base measured in 1857 by Assistant Greenwell was not introduced into the triangulation. The base was measured with two pine bars 4 meters long, and the length discrepancy indicated that the computed length was too short by one part in 4 300; 25 triangles of this island have an average closure of 5".2 and a maximum of 17 11 .2. The triangulation forms a small loop on the primary line Santa Cruz West-Santa Cruz East, but in such a way that the azimuth and length discrepancies do not develop directly. The latitude at Santa Cruz East from the east is greater by o''.042 and the longitude less by o". 239 than that computed from the west. This is equivalent to a distance of 6.3 meters. If this chain of triangles be considered as a straight line as long as the line Santa Cruz West-Santa Cruz East and lying at the same angle with the meridian, it would be necessary to increase the length of the line one part in 5 400 and decrease its azimuth by rn" .6.
SANTA ROSA AND SAN MIGUEL ISLANDS.·

The primary line New San Miguel-Santa Cruz West controls the length of the sides of all the triangles on these islands. A base line on San Miguel Island measured with a chain in 1858 was rejected. The computation of this base from the primary li~e disclosed a discrepancy of one part in I 600, the measured length being smaller. The base 011 Santa Rosa Island was measured with the 8-meter wooden bars Nos. l and 2 in l86o by Assistant w. E. Greenwell. This measured length was not introduced into the triangulation, but the computation gave as a length r 277.27 meters and the measured length was r 277. 26 meters, a discrepancy of only one part

532

in 130 ooo. Twenty-nine triangles on Sant~ Rosa Island have an average closure of 5".5 and a maximum of 15".3. On San Miguel Island, 23 triangles have an average closure of 5".7 and a maximum of 14".9.
POINT ARGUELLO TO POINT SAL.

Mr. Paul Schumacher, under the direction of Assistant W. E. Greenwell, executed the triangulation of this section in the years 1878 and 1879; 72 triangles have an average closure of 5".8 and a maximum of 19".7. The length from the north end of this section is that derived from the adjustment of the loop in the section Point Sal to Saddle Peak; and at the south end the length is computed from the primary line Arguello-Point Conception Light-house. The length as computed_ from the south was shorter than the length as computed. from the north by an amount equivalent to 213, expressed in terms of the sixth decimal place, or, expressed as a ratio, r/ 2 ooo. This triangulation forms a loop on the primary line Lospe-Arguello. The azimuth computed from the south was smaller than from the north by 34". 6. The latitude and longitude from the south were smaller than from the north by o".181 and o".oII, respectively. This is equivalent to a distance of 5.58 meters. If this narrow chain of coast triangles be considered as a straight line as long as the line Lospe-Arguello and lying at the same angle with the meridian, it would be necessary to increase the length of the line one part in 6 200 and increase its azimuth by 2" .2.
POINT. SAL TO SADDLE PEAK.

The length of the triangle sides in this section is controlled by the length as computed from the north, i. e., from the primary line Rocky Butt~addle Peak. This triangulation forms a loop on the primary line Saddle Peak-Lospe. The measurement of the San Luis Obispo Base in 1871 was not neglected. The discrepancy of approximately one part in 4 ooo was distributed in the few triangles which immediately surround the base. The base, 955:643 meters long, was measured by Assistant L. A. s~ngteller, and the 4-meter contact slide rods Nos. 3 and 4 were used. The computed length was greater than the length as measured. The latitude and longitude as computed from the north were smaller than from the south by o".148 and o".o63, respectively. This is equivalent to a distance of 4.8 meters. If this narrow chain of coast triangulation be considered as a'straight line as long as Saddle Peak-Lospe and lying at the same angle with the meridian, it would be necessary to increase the length of the line one part in 8 400 and increase its azimuth by 2 11 .5.
SADDLE PEAK TO PIEDRAS BLANCAS.

This section of triangulation depends for its length and position on the primary line Rocky Butte-Saddle Peak. The length of the San Simeon base was preserved as measured by a length equation in the base figure. Thus the small discrepancy, amounting to approximately 1 part in 140 ooo, was distributed in the figure immediately adjoining the base. This base, 815.981 meters in length, was, measured by Assistant C. Rockwell in 1871 with the 4-meter contact slicie rods Nos. 3 and 4; 87 triangles have an average closure of 5".8 and a maximum of x9".8.

APPENDIX NO. 9.

PIEDRAS BLANCAS TO POINT SUR.

A great portion' of the triangulation of this section was executed by Assistant A. F. Rodgers in the years 1888 and 1890. The triangulation of this entire section is based on the primary line Santa Lucia-Rocky Butte; 145 triangles have an average closure of 5 11 .6 and a maximum of 20".3.
POINT SUR TO MONTEREY llA Y.

The length for the triangles of this section is famished by the triangulation at the north end of the previous section. This triangulation forms a loop on the primary triangulation by connecting the previous section with Point Pinos Latitude Station .. An old adjustment of this triangulation was adopted which did not show the latitude and longitude discrepancy on the same basis as in foregoing sections; 62 triangles have an average closure of 6" .o and a maximum of 23".7. '
RECAPITULATION.

In the following table the results of the preceding paragraphs are assembled. No attempt has been made to show the signs for the computed discrepancies in this table. It is interesting to note in the prece~ing paragraphs that the length discrepancies of the two kinds indicated by the fifth and ninth columns of the following table are of the same sign for each secti0n, with the exception of one section on which the equivalent length discrepancy is nearly zero.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

It will be noted from the preceding comparison that the azimuth through a chain of small triangulation is much more accurately preserved than the length, an error of one second in azimuth being equivalent to an error of ii 206:;00 in length. In reconnaissance for triangulation of this character it would seem advisable in tl~e future to exercise more care in selecting well-shaped triangles through which the length would be computed. In this way fewer measures of the angles would be required to secure a given degree of accuracy.
EXPLANATION OF POSITIONS, LENGTHS, AND AZIMUTHS, AND OF THE UNITED STATES STANDARD DATUM.

The lengths, as already fully explained in connection with the adjustments, all depend upon the Yolo and Los Angeles bases. The lengths as given are all reduced to sea level. If the actual length of a line simply reduced to the horizontal is desired, it may be obtained with all the accuracy ordinarily needed by adding to the sea level length as given a correc. as given . ) (mean elevation of two ends of line in meters) . = (l engt h o f 1me t10n - · The 6370000 maximum value of this correction does not exceed rtinr of the length for any portion uf the triangulation here published. The maximum error made in the use of the above approximate formula for the correction does not exceed T1l· 11 ~ 1nnr of the length for any portion of this triangulation. The positions-that is, the latitudes, longitudes, and the azimuths-need a special explanation. All of the positions and azimuths have been computed upon the Clarke spheroid of 1866, which has been in use in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for many years. After a spheroid has been adopted and all the angles and lengths in a triangulation have been fully fixed, it is still necessary, before the computation of latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths can be made, to adopt a standard latitude and longitude for a specified station and a standard azimuth of a line from that station. For convenience the adopted standard position (latitude and longitude) of a given station, together with the adopted standard azimuth of a line from that station, is called the geodetic datum. The primary triangulation in the United States was commenced at various points, and existed at first as a number of detached portions in each of which the geodetic datum was necessarily dependent only upon the astronomic stations connected with that particular portion. As examples of such detached portions of triangulation then~ may be mentioned the early triangulation in New England and along the Atlantic coast, a detached portion of the transcontinental triangulation centering on St. Louis and another portion of the same triangulation in the Rocky Mountain region, and three separate portions of triangulation in California in the latitude of San Francisco, in the vicinity of Santa Barbara Channel, and in the vicinity of San Diego. With. the lapse of time these separate pieces have expanded until they have touched or overlapped. The transcontinental triangulation, of which the office computation was completed in 1899, joins all of the detached portions mentioned and makes them one continuous triangulation. As soon as this took place the logical necessity existed of discarding the old geodetic data used in these various pieces and substituting one datu,m for the whole country, or at least for as much of the country as is covered by continuous

APPENDIX NO. 9.

TRIANGULATION IN CALIFORNIA.

triangulation. To do this is a very heavy piece of work, and involved much preliminary study to determine the best datum to be adopted. On March 13, 1901, the Superintendent adopted what is now known as the United States Standard Datum, and it was decided to reduce the positions to that datum as rapidly as possible. The datum adopted was that formerly in use in New England, and therefore its adoption did not affect the positions which had been used for geographic purposes in New England* and along the Atlantic coast to North Carolina, nor those in the States of New York . Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The adopted datum does not agree, however, with that used in ''The Transcontinental Triangulation'' and in ''The Eastern Oblique Arc of the United States," publications which deal primarily with the purely scientific problem of the determination of the figure of the earth, and which were prepared for publication before the adoption of the new datum. The former publications oy this Office which contain positions in California are Appendix 9, Report for 1885, and "The Transcontinental Triangulation." The positions published therein being based upon different standard data '.ire therefore superseded. As the adoption of such a standard datum is a matter of considerable importance, it is in order here to explain the desirability of this step more fully. The main objects to be attained by the geodetic operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are, first, the control of the charts published by the Survey; second, the furnishing of geographic positions (latitudes and longitudes), of accurately determined elevations, and of distances and azimuths, to officers connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey and to other organizations; third, the determination of the figure of the earth. The first two of these objects are purely practical; the third is purely scientific. For the first and· second objects it is not necessary that the reference spheroid should be accurately that which most closely fits the geoid within the area covered, nor that the adopted geodetic datum should be absolutely the best that can be derived from the astronomic observations at hand. It is simply desirable that the reference spheroid and the geodetic datum adopted shall be, if possible, such a close approximation to the truth that any correction which may hereafter be derived from · the observations which are now or may become available shall not greatly exceed the probable errors of such corrections. It is, however, very desirable that one spheroid and one geodetic datum be used for the whole country. In fact, this is absolutely 1iecessary if a geodetic survey is to perform fully the function of accurately coordinating all surveys within the area which it covers. This is the most important function of a geodetic survey. To perform this function it is also highly desirable that when a certain spheroid and geodetic datum have been adopted for a country they should be rigidly adhered to without change for all time, unless shown to be largely in error. In striving to attain the .third object, the determination of the figure of the earth, the conditions are decidedly different. This problem concerns itself primarily with astronomic observations of latitude, longitude, an_d azimuth, and with the geodetic positions of the points at which the astronomic observations were made, but is not
*Many such positions had been published in Appendix No. 8, Report for 1885, Appendix No. 8 ·for 1888, and Appendix No, JO, for 1894. Since the adoption of the United States Standard Datum many positions in Texas, Indian Territory, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska reduced to that datum have been published in Appendix 6, Report for 1901, Appendix 3, 1902, and Appendix 4 1 1903·

concerned with the geodetic positions of other points fixed by the triangulations. The geodetic positions (latitudes and longitudes) of comparatively few points are therefore concerned in this problem. However, in marked contrast to the statements made in preceding paragraphs, it is desirable in dealing with this problem that, with each new important accession of data, a new spheroid fitting the gi;oid with the greatest possible accuracy, and new values of the geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths of the highest degree of accuracy, should be derived. The United States Standard Datum was adopted with reference to positions furnished for geographic purposes, but has no reference to the problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. It is adopted with reference to the engineer's problem of furnishing standard positions, and does not affect the scientist's problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. The principles which guided in the selection of the ·datum to be adopted were: first, that the adopted datum should not differ widely from the ideal datum for which the sum of the station errors in latitude, longitude, and azimuth. should each be zero; second, it was desirable that the adopted datum should produce minimum changes in the publications of the Survey, including its charts; and, third, it was desirable, other things being equal, to adopt that datum which allowed the maximum number of positions already in the office registers to remain unchanged, and therefore necessitated a minimum amount of new computation. These considerations led to the adoption as the United States Standard of the datum which had been in use for many years in the northeastern group of States and along the Atlantic coast as far as North Carolina. An examination of the station errors available in 1903, on the United States Standard Datum, at 246 latitude stations, 76 longitude stations, and 152 azimuth stations, scattered widely over the United States from Maine to Loui~iana and to California, indicated that this datum approaches closely the ideal with which the algebraic sum of the station errors of each class would be zero. ·The adopted United States Standard Datum, upon which the positions and azimuths ·given in this publication depend, may be defined iti terms of the position of the station Meades Ranch as follows:

The positions here published on the "!:Jnited States Standard Datum therefore differ considerably from those given in ''The Transcontinental Triangulation'' (pp. 854-865), which depend upon a special geodetic datum which was adopted for the special purpose of that publication, and which was based upon the astronomic observations connected with that triangulation alone. The position given for the station Meades Ranch, in "The Transcontinental Triangulation'' (p. 862), is· 0

TABLE OF POSITIONS, AZIMUTHS, AND LENG'l'HS.

The following tables give the positions of all points, and the azimuths and lengths of all lines of the primary triangulation of California completed before 1900 and of all the subordinate triangulation south of Monterey Bay:· These tables may be conveniently consu1ted by using as finders the twenty-one sketches and the index at the end of this appendix. In the third column of the index will be found for each point a reference to the page on which its description is given, and in the fourth column the page on which its elevation above sea level may be found. The azimuth and length of every line over which observations have been made in one or both directions are given in the list in connection with the position of one end only of the line. The positions of all points for which the latitudes and longitudes are given to thousandths of seconds have been fixed by a complete adjustment of the triangulation concerned, so as to make all the triangles close and remove all discrepancies bet~·een lengths, azimuths, and positions. Such adjustments are of a very high degree of accuracy, as indicated in the preceding pages, for points on the primary scheme, of. a less degree of accurac):" for secondary points, and of a still more. approximate character for tertiary points determined .by intersections only. In each class all discrepancies are removed to the limit given by the decimal place shown. The above statements in ' regard to the various degrees of accuracy refer to the manner in which the discrepancies were removed. If Jess than three deeimal places are given in the latitudes and longitudes, the point in question has not been fixed by fully adjusted triangulation; or is fixed in such a \Vay as to furnish no check on its position, and the accuracy with which its position is known is indicated in part by the number of decimal places given. In the case of the mountain peaks the complete adjustment has been made in every case. The seconds of latitude and longitude are also given in meters for the convenience of draftsmen. In the column giving azimuths, distances, and logarithms of distances various numbers of decimal places are given, the intention being to indicate the accuracy to a certain extent, it being understood that in each quantity two doubtful figures are given. In some cases there is very little doubt of the correctness of the second figure from the right, and in a few cases some doubt may be cast upon the third figure.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS. This list may be conveniently consulted by reference to the illustrations at the end of this appendix and to the index. In each desci:iption 'the tense used is appropriate to the date at which the description was written. · All directions in the descriptions are given in the form of azimuths reckoned continuously from south around by west to 360°, west being 90°, north 180°, and east 270°. The azimuths are true, not magnetic. In general the surface and underground marks described are not in contact, so that a disturbanLe of the surface mark will not, in general, affect the underground mark. The underground mark should be resorted to only when there is evidence tha..t the surface mark has been disturbed. Any person who finds that one of the stations here described is disturbed, or that the description no longer fits the facts, is requested to send such information to SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND .GEODJtTIC SURVEY, Washington, D. C. GENERAL NOTES IN REGARD TO STATION MARKS. NOTE 1.-The method of marking each station referred to this note was as follows: A glass bottle buried neck up with its top about 20 inches below the surface of the ground was the underground mark. A redwood stub 2 by 3 inches in cross section, with I several inches left protruding and having a nail driven in its top, marked the station at the surface. Coal cinders were placed in the hole with the earth in filling it and placed on the surface around the center mark. As witness marks the three stubs, 2 by 3 inches in cross section, which supported the theodolite stand were left in position. NOTE 2.-The station was marked by the center of the upper end of a 4-inch. earthenware pipe buried in the ground and filled with coal cinders and ashes. Three stubs, each with a fencing staple in the top, were driven around the center. NOTE 3.-A station referred to this note was marked in 1860 by a redwood stub with a composition nail in the top, surrounded by four similar stubs. In 1878 the center was re-marked by a stone, usually 6 inches long by 3 inches in diameter, with a leaden bolt and copper nail in the top, the nail marking the center of the station, and buried from 1 to 3 feet under the ground. Above this was set even with the surface a stone about 8 inches square, with a drill hole marking the center of station, surround~ by three redwood stakes, each l foot from the drill hole, and by three large stones with drill holes in the top buried even with the surface of the ground, ranging approximately north, southeast, and southwest, and distant 15 feet, each surrounded by three redwood stakes, distant I foot from the drill hole. NOTE 4.-A station referred to this note was marked by a fiat stone, in which a hole was drilled, buried 3 feet below the surface of the ground. Over this was a pine ·stub projecting 6 inches above the surface and having a copper tack in the top. Three stubs, each with a copper tack in the top, were driven in the ground, each 6 feet from the center, and three bottles were buried 1 foot deep, each pointing to the center.

Truckee River, 26 miles north 44 ° east from Reno, and I 2 miles north 44 ° west from Wadsworth. It is visible from both places and may be reached from either place by road and trail-35 miles from the former and 20 n1iles from the latter place. The center was marked by a half-inch copper bolt cemented into the bed rock as a subsurface mark, over which a stone slab, with a U-inch drill hole in the center, was firmly cemented in position as a surface mark. Around the station was built to serve as a wind-break a rougho stone circular wall, about 8 feet interior diameter, with an opening to the northeast. A stone pier, bearing north 37°.26 east and distant 8.5.feet ~rom the station, was left standing as a reference mark. Mount Como (Douglas County, Nev., W. Eimbeck, I879).-9n a sharp conical peak of the Como range of mountains, lying between Carson and Mason valleys, about , 20 miles nearly due east from the. town of Genoa, about 20 miles southeast from Carson ·City, and about I7 miles southeast from Dayton. The subsurface mark was a ~ by 4 inch copper bolt, leaded into a large and well-bedded granite rock. The surface mark was a ~-inch drill hole in the center of a large flat stone, I9 by 22 inches square and 5 inches thick, firmly cemented to the top of a stone and brick pier built over and ,around the lower mark to a height of 9 inches above the bolt. A ring wall of stone, resembling the figure 6, built to serve as a wind-break, was left standing. Lieutenant Wheeler's monument, about 35° west of south and IO feet distant from the station, forms part of the wall. Two piers, one north and one south, were left standing as reference marks. Drill holes were made in the rock-one in line to Round Top, distant 6.25 meters; one in line to north pier, distant Io.6 meters, and one in line to south pier, distant 7.24 meters from the station. The angle at the center between the south pier and Round Top is 71° oI', and between Round Top and the north pier is I29° 5I'. Mount Grant (Esmeralda County, Nev., A. F. Rodgers, I878; W. Eimbeck, I879).0n a high peak on the Wassuck Range, about 7 or 8 miles west of the southern end of Walker Lake. The mountain can be easily recognized by its three sharp peaks, one of which, King Peak, stands high above the others. The station is on the central peak, about 200 meters north of King Peak. The nearest railroad station (I 882) is Hawthorne, just south of Walker Lake, on the Centralia and Chester Railroad, and distant about IO miles from the mountain. The center of station was marked by a copper bolt sunk in a rock embedded in a stone and brick foundation pier, the top of which extends about 8 inches above the bolt, with a center pit in which a notice of approximate height and geographic positon was embedded in cement. A stone ring wall I5·5 feet interior diameter, with a long wing projecting. to the southward and curving around the vertical· circle pier (distant 32.5 feet from the center) was left standing. The wall and piers will serve as good reference marks for identifying the station. Rouf!d Top (Alpine County, Cal., W. Eimbeck,' I876; G. Davidson, I879; W. B. Fairfield, I 893). -On the crest of the Sierra Nevada Range of mountains on the highest and most easterly pinµacle, popularly known as Round Top, about 1 mile south of Carson Pass or the main summit of the Amador Grada. It can be reached via Carson City, thence by stage via Genoa to Woodfords, 32 miles distant, thence by wagon or horseback up Hope Valley to the summit of the Amador Grada. The ascent to the top of the peak must be from west or northwest. The station was marked by a copper bolt ~ inch in diameter, set in a drill hole in the rock. Above this was built a pier of rough stone masonry. Three other piers were built-one a little east of north and the

620

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1904·

other two nearly west of the station, and all were left standing to serve as reference marks. No difficulty was experienced in finding the point when it was visited in 1893. Mount Conness (Tuolumne County, Cal., L. A. Sengteller, 1879; R. A. Marr, 1879; P. A. Welker, 1887; G. Davi.'dson, 1890).-0n a lofty peak of the Sierra Nevada Range, about 25 miles a little east of north from the Yosemite Valley, about 10 miles north of Soda Springs in the Tuolumne Meadows, and about 30 miles southwest of the California and Nevada boundary; on the highest pinnacle of the-summit, which is a very small irregular crag. The sheer descent around four-fifths of the summit is over 1 ooo feet to the talus. The station was marked by a cross cut on top of a copper bolt, ¥s inch in diameter by 6 inches long, projecting 3Yz inches above the solid rock. Above this was built a solid concrete pier 26 inches in diameter and about 40 inches high. In its upper surface was embedded a copper bolt ¥s inch in diameter by 4 inches long, having a broad spherical head with a small silver pin in the center. A cross cut on the head of the bolt, ~little to one side of the silver pin, marked the station. Mount Lola (Nevada County, Cal., W. Eimbeck, 1876; G. Davidson, 1879; W. B. Fairfield, 1893).-About 25 feet northwest from the highest part of the southernmost summit of the high ridge between Weber and Independence lakes and the town of Meadow Lake. Independence Lake lies at the southeast base of this ridge and Browns Valley is on the opposite side. The best route to the station from Truckee is by way of Jansen's hotel at the east end of Independence Lake, thence up the eastern slope of the mountain to the station. The station was marked hy a cross cut on the top of a ¥a-inch copper bolt set in a heavy capstone firmly embedded in a rough stone pier laid in cement. This capstone was about 15 inches above the natural surface of the ground and 3 feet 9 inches above the base of the pier. The pier was then built higher, and surmounted with another capstone 24 inches square with a hole drilled through it, marking the point. The pier was surrounded by a stone wall, about 6 feet distant, to serve as a wind-break. Three brick piers on stone foundations-one north 36° .5 east, distant 27 feet 9Yz inches; one north 44°.8 east, distant 31 feet 3 inches, and the other north 27°.75 west-were left standing as reference marks. No difficulty was experienced in finding the point when visited in 1893. Mount Diablo (Contra Costa County, Cal., R. D. Cutts, 1852; George Davidson, 1858~. W. Eimbeck, 1876; J. J. Gilbert, 1880; George Davidson, 1884; George Davidson, 1892).-Close beside the highest rock on the summit of Mount Diablo. In all directions, except by the crooked approach along the ridge, the summit falls off rapidly. The second peak of Mount Diablo stands to the eastward. The subsurface mark was a cross in the top of a copper bolt sunk and cemented into the solid rock. Over this was a pier, and the center of the station was marked by the intersection of cross lines on the top of a U-inch copper bolt cemented in flush with the top of the pier. On the top of the bolt are also two other lines, and in the west angle of their intersection a hole. The intersection of cross lines, which marks the station, is three-sixteenths of an inch to the southeast of this hole. The pier from which vertical angles were observed (later reported as in ruins) was 144. 74 feet west of the station, and inside the curve of the wagon road. The latitude pier was 27. 7 feet southwest of the vertical angle pier and 167.84 feet west of the station; the transit pier was 32.5 feet southwest of the vertical angle pier.

in the center of the neck marking the station. Over this was built a rough stone pier laid in Portland cement. The center mark at the surface was a copper bolt ~-inch in diameter and 5 inches long, projecting about one-fourth inch and having a silver pin in it, set in cement in a large stone in the center of the piei:. The top of the pier was 3.44 feet above the underground mark. The astronomic piers, built of concrete, situated as follows, serve as reference marks: vertical circle pier south 6° 02' east (true), distant 15.9 meters, and zenith telescope pier south 58° 42' east (true), distant 72.1 feet from the station. Monticello (Yolo County, Cal., W. Eimbeck, 1876).-In the extreme northeast corner of section 4, township 9 north, range 3 west of the Diablo mei;idian, on the highest summit of the mountain range lying between the Sacramento and Berryessa valleys, about 5 miles north ward from the. town of Monticello in the lower portion of Berryessa Valley. It may be most readily approached from this town, from which it is visible. The lower underground mark was a loaded metallic cartridge placed ball downward in a half-inch hole, 1 ~ inches deep, drilled in the bottom of a 6-inch round hole 1 foot deep excavated in the sandstone rock, the top of the cartridge being 2.5 feet below the surface. Over this was placed a stone about 4 inches square and 1 foot long, with a copper bolt in the top, its top being 1. 1 feet below the surface. · A rough stone foundation was laid over this and crowned with a large .stone coming even with the surface. As a surface mark, a copper bolt ~ by 5 inches, with a silver pin in it, was set in cement in a hole drilled in this stone. The bolt projects about one-fourth inch above the stone. A rough stone theodolite pier was then built to a height of 3.84 feet and capped with a fl.at stone 32 inches square, having cross lines on it. The reference marks were the transit pier, 31.288 feet north and 3.687 feet east of the station; the latitude pier, 3I.413 feet north and 8.823 feet east of the station, and the vertical circle' pier bearing south 38° 17' east (true) and distant 19.786 meters from the station. Yolo Southeast Base (Yolo County, Cal., G. Davidson, 1876, 1880).-In the northwest quarter of section 19, township 8 north, range 2 east, Diablo meridian, 3}11 miles west and 1}11 miles south of Davisville and about 25 meters from the left bank of Putah Creek. The subsurface mark was a fine needle hole in a German-silver plug inserted in a copper bolt in the top of a granite block 35 inche..5 long by 20 inches square at the base and dressed to I 2 inches square at the top and ha~ng the letters U. S. C. G. S. deeply cut on it. The top of the block was 4~ feet below the surface and a glass hemisphere was placed over the copper bolt. The surface mark was a fine needle bole in a copper bolt set in lead on the top of a granite block 25.incbes square by 26 inches deep having the letters U.S. C. S.S. E. YOLO BASE cut on it. The top of this block was even with the surface of the ground and the block itself was in the center of a solid brickwork pier, having a base of 70 inches square at a depth of 50 inches below the surface, battering to 54 inches square at the surface. This brickwork was carried up as a hollow pier to a height of 33U feet above the ground and capped with a granite slab 40 inches square by 8 inches thick with a 1 U-inch hole in the center. Charcoal and charcoal dust were mixed with the earth in filling in around the subsurface part of the structure. Four reference marks we.re set, consisting of granite blocks 1 foot square and 1 U feet high, with copper bolts and drill holes in the top. They were incased in brickwork with their tops 18 inches below the surface. Two were set in a line to Yolo Northwest Ba~ at distances of 18 'feet inches and 327

feet 10 inches from the center and two at right angles thereto eastwardly at distances of 20 feet ¥s inch and 328 feet 5-h inches from the center. Yolo Nortliwest Bq,se (Yolo County,. Cal., G. Davidson, 1876, 1880).-In the extreme southeast corner of the southeast quarter of section 28, township IO north, range 1 east, Diablo meridian, 4,73 miles west of the railroad passing through Woodland, and immediately on the north side of th~ country road running west toward Madison and Copay Valley. The marking at this station was practically identical with .that at Yolo Southeast Base, with the exception that the hollow brick pier was carried to a height of only about 12 feet above the surface, and the letters N.W. were substituted for S.E. on the granite blocks. No reference marks were established. Ross Mountain (Sonora County, Cal., R. D. Cutts 1855; G. Davidson, 186o; J. F. Pratt, 1881; E. F. Dickins, 1891).-0n the mountain locally known as Pole Mountain, on land belonging to Baker '& Sons. It may be reached from Cazadero by a wagon road for about 3 miles to the ranch of W. H. Knowles and then about 2 miles by a good trail to the station. A good camping place with a fine spring of water is about )( mile southeast and about 250 feet below the station. The station was marked by a copper bolt in the top of a concrete pier. The reference marks were three stones, each with a half-inch drill hole in the top, placed level with the surface of the ground and 6 feet from the station, one nearly in line to Tamales Bay, one toward Mount Helena, and the third toward Walalla. A charred oak stump with a wrought-iron nail in the top was 20 feet 4 inches N. 54° or' W. (true) from the station. Snow Mountain 'Ut"est (Colusa County, Cal., E. F. Dickins, 1892; also given as Gleen, Lake 'County).-On the highest point of the southwestern summit of Snow Mountain, a ridge about 200 yards long sloping slightly to the southeast; at a point where the ridge is about 50 yards wide, bare of grass and covered with small broken stones. The center of the station was marked by a half-inch drill hole 3~ inches deep, into which was driven a brass bolt 3 inches long. Over this was placed a spruce stump 6 inches in diameter and 3 feet long, with a brass bolt in the lower end resting on the brass bolt in the stone and surrounded with a pile of stones. The best route to take in going to the station is via Colusa Junction, Sites, Stony Ford, arid Fouts Springs to Caldwells Ranch, at the head of Paradise Valley, and from there, 6 miles by the trail up the east side of the mountain. The trail up th~ east side of the mountain is considered better, being less rugged and of easier slope than the one on the south side of the mountain. Mount Sanliedrin (Mendocino County, Cal., B. A. Colonna, r878; A. F. Rodgers, 1880; E. F. Dickins, 1891).-0n the top of a sharp peak at the east.end of Mount Sanhedrin. The best route in 1891 for reaching this station was from Uk~ah by the Round Valley wagon road to Watsons (Hearst post-office), on the South Fork of · Eel River (about 30 miles), thence by a private road to Ames and Garcy's·ranch house (about 2 76 miles), and then by a very poor trail, past the old Garcy cabin and round the southwest flank of the mountain up to the station (about 8 miles); this trail is very seldom used, and it would be almost impossible for a stranger to follow it without a guide. The nearest to.wn is Centerville in Potter Valley (about 20 miles from Watsons). The center of the station was marked by a glass bottle embedded in the base of a concret~ pier and by a screw in the wooden core _in the top of the pier. The top of the bottle was 3.60 feet below the top of the pier. N~ilswere driven in stumps, as follows: One,

Dickins, 1891).-0n a conspicuous bowlder 20 feet in diameter at the base and about IS feet higher than the surrounding ridge, on the southwest end of the summit of Cold Spring Mountain, locally known as Signal Ridge. It is about 3 miles from Clay's ranch, and about 3 miles from Smally's house, and about I mile from Cold Spring ranch. The best approach in 1891 was by the Greenville and Booneville road to Clows ranch, about 15 miles from either place, then about 5 miles to Cold Spring ranch. The center was marked by a drill hol~ in the rock. This drill hole was 1376 inches deep, and for a depth of 4 inches was 2 inches in diameter; below a depth of 4 inches its diameter was 17-{ inches. This drill hole was filled with cement, and a brass c:irtridge shell inserted in its mouth marked the center of the station. Above this was built a concrete pier 26 inches square, in the top of which, 3 feet I 1 inches above the lower· mark, was placed a copper bolt to mark the station. The reference marks were eyebolts in the rock, numbered in their azimuthal order, as follows: No. 1, a little to the right of the line to Paxton .&. , distant IO feet 1 inch; .No. 2, distant 9 feet 4 inches; No. 3, distant I2 feet. Great Caspar (Mendocino County, Cal., B. A. Colonna, 1878; A. F. Rodgers, 1879).-0n a knoll on the highest part of the ridge between Russian Gulch and Caspar Creek, about 7 miles from Mendocino City and }a mile north from the road from Mendocino City to Little Lake. At the point where the road to the .signal left this road there was cut a triangle in a redwood tree, and on another redwood was placed a signboard marked "U.S. C. S. Great Caspar Station I878." At the center of the station was a redwood tree, and therefore the center of the station was fixed by four ~tone reference marks, each a granite block, from IS to 22 inches long, buried even with the surface, the top dressed to 6 by 6 inches. Stones Nos. 1, 2, and 4are marked on top

u s c s .&. , and stone No. 3, .&. · c s / u s

Beneath

each stone a bottle was buried, with its top from 25 to 28 inches below the surface. Three trees were blazed with a triangle, about 2 feet on a side, and with a border of wrought-iron spikes driven around the edge. The distance and true azimuth to these reference marks were as follows: Stone No. 1, 32°, IO feet; stone No. 2, 32°, 50 feet; redwood tree, 48°, .60.5 feet; pine tree, 98°, 48 feet; redwood tree, 284°, 85.5 feet; stone No. 3, 297°, 10 feet; stone No. 4, 297°, 50 feet. Two Rock (Mendocino County, Cal., C. Rockwell, 1877-78; B. A. Colonna, 1878; A. F. Rodgers, 1879; E. F. Dickins, 1892).-0n the most western of the bare peaks west of the Russian River Valley. The mountain has three summits, the most westerly of which is crowned on the northwest side by a conspicuous sandstone ledge, 200 feet long and 6 to 20 feet wide, precipitous on three sides. The station was on the summit of this rock. The center of station was marked by a drill hole, 176 inches in diameter and about 3 inches deep, in the bare rock. There were 110 reference marks. Paxton· (Mendocino County, Cal., C. Rockwell, I877-78; B. A. Colonna, 1878; C. H. Sinclair, 1897).-0n Pine Ridge, west of Ukiah, 011 the highest hill in the vicinity.

as" Bald Mountain." The station is on the ranch of Mr. Paxton and 27'J miles from the house of Mr. John Remstead. The center was marked by a I-inch drill hole, 2 inches deep, in the top of an irregular shaped stone, about I6 by I8 by 26 inches. The stone had a roof-like top .and the part corresponding to the ridge of the roof was placed in the direction of Mount Sanhedrin. The top of the stone was flush with the ground. Broken glass was mixed with the earth around the stone. A white earthenware bottle was buried with its top 22 ~ inches below the stone. Over the stone was built a hexagonal concrete pier 26 inches in diameter and 50 inches high, with an iron rod running through the center, carefully plumbed over the mark in the stone and bent at right angles at the foot to prevent its being pulled out. The reference marks were: A stone with a triangular flat top and a somewhat pointed bottom, having a drill hole in its top, 6 feet from the center in the direction of ·Mount Sanhedrin; a stone in the direction away from Mount Sanhedrfn, buried big end down, with a pointed top in which was a I-inch drill hole 1 inch deep; and a stone at right angles to these stones, in the direction of Great Caspar station, somewhat square, and with a 1-inch drill hole r inch deep. An oak stump, marked with a triangle 7 feet high and 1 foot in diameter stood a little to the right of the line to Mount Sanhedrin A, and 54.82 feet from the station, and a large oak tree marked with a triangle stood a little to the right of the line to Cold Spring 8. and 103.3 feet from the station. Fisher (Mendocino County, Cal., B. A. Colonna, 1878; E. F. Dickins, 1891-<)2).0n the highest part of the open grassy hill locally kn.own as Cliffs Ridge, which is the divide between Greenwood and Elk creeks, on the ranch owned in 1878 by Mr. Fisher, and in· ·1891 by Mr. Bishop, about 2 mil_es northwest of Bishop's house. The center of the station was marked by a bottle 7 inchec; long, resting on the rock 20 ~ inches below the surface, the cep.ter of its mouth marking the station. On top "of the bottle was a little earth and on this a stone projecting 1 inch at the surface in the top of which was a ~-inch drill hole about 1 inch deep marking the center. There were also th!ee reference stones on tht! surface, one in line to Cold Spring A, one on the opposite side, and one at right angles toward the southwest, each with a ~-inch drill hole," and each 6 feet from the center. There was a natural outcropping of rock about 18 feet to the northwest of the station, and another 45 feet to the southwest. Marysville Butte (Sutter County, Cal., George Davidson, 1876; B. A. Colonna, I879; C. H. Sinclair, 1898) .-On the south and highest butte of the Marysville Buttes, a chain of several conical peaks extending north and south, rising abruptly from the plain about 15 miles ·west of Marysville; near the edge of the summit, 4 feet 6 inches from the brow of the hill on the northeast side and 9 feet on the south sfde. The center was marked by a drill hole in the top of a fast rock. The reference marks were: a half-inch drill hole in the rock in the di~ection of Mount Diablo, 8 feet 6 inches; a similar one 8 feet distant toward Downieville Buttes, and a third, 9 feet 8 inches distant, toward Snow Mountain. Pine Hill (Eldorado County, Cal., W. Eimbeck, 1876; f. F. Pratt, 1879).-In the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, upon the prominent summit locally known as Pine Hill, on the outcropping rock forming the summit. The center was marked by a %'-inch drill hole, in which was put a copper bolt projecting 1 ~ inches from the rock. The reference marks were a cross cut in a large projecting rock in the direction of.

Sierra Morena (San Mateo County, Cal., George Davidson, 1883).-0n the range of mountains extending northwest and southeast along the San Francisco Peninsula, about 50 yards from an old wood road following along the ridge to the southward from the "Mountain Brow House," which is about 4 miles west of Woodside. The station is 2 ~ miles from '' Mountain Brow House,'' and is on. the highest knoll in the vicinity. The station was marked by a copper bolt in a stone placed 2 feet below the surface of the ground. Over this was built a pier 26 inches in diameter, 4.07 feet above the ground, in the top of which was a copper bolt shaped like a key, with hole in top, marking the station. Loma Prieta (Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties, Cal., George Davidson (E. F .. Dickins), 1884).-This station was formerly known as Mount Bache, and is on the highest peak of the range of mountains forming the boundary line between the coun· ties of Santa Clara and Santa Cruz. It may be reached from Wrights, on the Southern Pacific, by a wagon road for about 4 miles to D. H. Montgomery's ranch, and then by a fair trail for about 6 or 7 miles to the top of the mountain. The underground mark was a 2 by 3 inch brown stone witll a copper bolt in the center, 3 feet 2 inches below the surface. A rock with a drill hole filled with lead, having cross lines on the top, was placed 24j13 inches below the surface and j13 inch to the west of the copper bolt in the brown stone. A concrete foundation 3~ feet square and 9 inches deep was laid around this stone, and upon it was built a hexagonal pier, 30 inches in diameter at the base and 26 inches at the top. An 8 by ~ inch copper bolt in top of pier marked the center. Santa Ana (San Benito County, Cal., R. D. Cutts, 1852; George Davidson, 1885).0n the western summit of a double-topped peak, very rocky and covered with oaks, locally known as "Henrietta Peak,'' about 2 miles from the one known as Santa Ana. The station is easily reached from the town of Hollister by going out the main street to the north, crossing the railroad track, and taking the first road to the right or east. Follow this road for about 2 miles to a road running north and south, turn to the north and proceed until a ~cond road leading to the right is reached; take this and proceed easterly, following the main wagon road and crossing the creek at the mouth of the Dos Picachos Canyon. By following the grade which winds up the ridge on the north side of the Dos Picachos Canyon for about 6 or 8 miles a point is reached near the summit of the grade, about halfway between Herrington's ranch house and the Stayton mine, where the wagon road should be left and the backbone of the rldge followed in a southwesterly direction until the station is reached, about half a mile south of and 1,000 feet above Herrington's house. The station was marked by an irregular~shaped rock with a copper bolt in the top, around which a concrete foundation 3 feet square and about IO inches deep was laid, and upon this a concrete pier, hexagonal in shape, and 26 inches in diameter; was built. A copper bolt with cross cut upon it was set in top of pier to mark center of station, 5 feet 2 ~ inches above the subsurface mark. A concrete pier, occupied in 1885 for latitude observations, was 37 feet 6 inches from the A, in azimuth 129° 07' 01".

on the west; about 500 yards south of Mr. A. B. Parson's house, and upon his land. The station was marked by a copper bolt set in a flat-topped rock, 2 feet beneath surface of ground, and in center of a concrete pier; a cross on a copper bolt in the top of the pier constituted the surface mark, and was I .49S meters above the subsurface mark. Northw~t of the station were the vertical circle pier, distant 10. xS meters; the zenith telescope pier (concrete), distant 19.Sr meters, azimuth 135° 55'; and the transit pier (concrete), distant 20.S5 metei:s, azimuth 132° 25'. . Hepsedam (San Benito County, Cal., J. S. Lawson, 1SS5-S6).-0n the sharp, rocky top of a very prominent peak of that name in the Mount Diablo range of mountains in t11e southern part of San Benito County; it is the highest and sharpest peak in the vicinity. The station may be reached by following the road up Lewis Creek from its junction with San Lorenzo Creek, near Lonoak post-office, Monterey County, r mile to the house of Fred Taylor. One and a half· miles farther, on the south side of the mountain, wa!; the place of Samuel Saffell. The trail from there up the mountain was long and steep. The trail from a point in a canyon, about 3 miles fa,rther up the road1 near the house of Trinidad Garcia, is better, but can be followed only on horseback. During the dry season the best way to reach the station would be by the road up the San Benito River to the place of Lorenzo Vasquez, called Sweetwater Springs; thence for about 7 miles on the road to the Laguna ranch to the foot of the mountain, from which place to the top is r }6 or 2 miles. The station was marked by a copper tack leaded into a hole drilled into an outcropping rock. Three similar marks were made, approximately north, south, and west, at the following distances: north, 6.90 feet; south, 7.9S feet; west, 6.70 feet. Over the center mark was built a concrete pier, marked in the top by a copper bolt, with a small drill hole in it. The concrete pier for the meridian instrument was I .57 meters due east of the station, and the wooden pier for th~ vertical circle was 9. 753 meters a little south of west. Santa Lucia (Monterey County, Cal., George Davidson, 1S85; A. F. Rodgers, xS90).-0n the eastern summit of the highest peak of the San~a Lucia range, which consists of two rocky knobs about 200 yards apart, with a saddle or depression of 20 feet between them. The best way to reach the station is by a rough wagon road up the San Antonio Valley from Jolon to a point about 13 miles beyond the old Mission, or about a mile before reaching the place of Eusebio Ensinal; here leaving the road and turning to the right, follow up a fiat ridge for about a mile, cross the canyon to the east side and keep up the smooth ridge for about a mile, till just beyond an old log cabin; recross the canyon to the west side and follow a very rough and steep trail 'winding up the ridges to the summit, rising about. 3 500 feet in about 4 miles. The station was marked by a cross cut fo the projecting end of a copper bolt set in the solid rock. Over that was laid a concrete foundation 3 feet square and IO inches deep, and upon it a concrete pier hexagonal in shape and 26 inches in diameter was built, and a copper bolt with a cross cut in it was set in top of pier to mark the center of the station. The distance from the subsurface mark to the copper bolt in top of pier was 4.6 feet. · The reference marks were holes drilled in outcropping rocks, filled with lead, into which copper tacks were driven, and distant as follows: north, 6.SS feet; south, 7. rs feet; east, 5.9i feet, and west, IO.OS feet. The concrete pier occupied for latitude in 1SS5 was 44 feet 1 inch from the A in azimuth 227° 2S'.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1904.

The azimuth from the center of &. to the frame pier used for the vertical circle in 1885 was 56° 14', and the distance was 5.486 meters. The stations occupied by the eclipse expedition of 1880 were a little north of west from the 8 and distant from it 546 feet and over. Rocky Butte (San Luis Obispo County, Cal., J. S. Lawson, 1884:-85; A. F. Rodgers, 1890).-0n the top of the peak of that name in the Santa Lucia range of mountains, about 14 miles from Cambria, about l Yz miles west from the house of Mr. Newton Mathers, at the foot of the mountain, and about 6 miles from the house of J. P. Coffee., It may be reached by the road along the north fork of the San Simeon Creek. The top of the peak is rather fl.at and is covered with a growth of low brush. It is somewhat dome-shaped, and surrounding it, extending to the top on the north side, is a growth of tall pine trees. The top itself is free from timber, with the exception of a few scattering trees on the north edge: The east, south, and west sides of the peak are very steep and rocky, but by approaching it from the north the top can easily be reached with saddle horses and pack animals. On the east side of the peak and about 400 feet from the summit (about Yz mile by trail), there was a good spring where water could be had the year round. . There was also a good spring about Yz mile from the station in the canyon to the northwest. The station was marked by a copper tack leaded into the top of a stone about l foot long and 8 inches square on top buried 2 feet below the surface of the ground. Over this was built a concrete pier. Four reference stones of about the same size, with leaden bolts and copper tacks, were placed approximately north, south, east, and west.

To reach the station, go south from the San Joaquin ranch house by the faint trail used to send supplies to the sheep camps. Before starting, notice the highest peak of the hills; it is crowned with a heap of stones that show black from the house. When halfway through the canyon, take a long ridge to the right and follow it up. You can drive up this ridge for a long distance, but not directly to the station. When you get to a sudden breakdown in the hills, walk up to the highest point that you see; you will find it crowned with large rocks. Then go over this knoll, and directly west, about 500 meters distant and on the next commanding point, you wjll find the station. From this point you see through a gap the bluff ori the seacoast to the west and the kelp bed lying offshore. You also see Newport bar, and to the south, the point and reef of rocks above San Juan Capistrano River. The station is about the middle of the knoll, and was marked by a cross on a stone 6 inches square. Three bottles were buried, each 2 feet from center point and bearing north, south, and east (magnetic), 1 foot beneath surface of the ground. Three redwood stubs, 3 by 4 by 18 inches, each with a fencing staple in the top, were driven around the center with their tops even with the surface of the ground, to support the theodolite stand, 2.9 feet from the station.

COMPUTATION, ADJUSTMENT, AND ACCURACY' OF THE ELEVATIONS OF THE TRIAN-

GUI.A TION OF CALIFORNIA.

In connection with the adjustment of the transcontinental triangulation, and in order to connect one of the most important longitude stations in that arc, Mount Hamilton (Lick Observatory), four of the stations* of this primary triangulation became fixed in elevation, viz, Sierra Morena, Loma Prieta, Santa Ana, and Mount TQro. For the foundation of the hypsometric measures along this triangulation there are, 111 addition to these four stations, the lines of spirit levels which connect five stations with tidewater of the Pacific Ocean in Santa Barbara Channel. The profile of the Los Angeles Base, t which was an incident to its measurement, added another fixed elevation to the hypsometry of this triangulation. In January and February, 1874, Assistant S. Forney ran two lines of spirit levels _om Santa Cruz West & to the sea, differing 0.326 foot (or 0.102 meter), with a result for the elevation of the ground at the station of 715.87 feet (218.rg meters). In November and December, 1873, Assistant.O. H. Tittn,1ann ran two lines from New San Miguel & to the sea, differing 0.158 foot ( 0.048 meter), with a result for the ground at the station of 809. 12 feet ('.J46.62 meters). In May and June, 1875, Assistant Tittmann ran a sing!~ line of spirit levels from Gaviota & to the sea, which gave a result for the elevation of the ground at the station equal to 2 457.076 feet (748.91 meters). The zenith distances over the three lines connecting these stations gave an opportunity to examine the effect on the coefficient of refraction where the lines of sight are over the deep water of Santa Barbara Channel. Only one zenith distance was observed over two of the lines, but a value for the coefficient of refraction, m, was computed
*The adjustment and the resulting heights for these stations will be found in Special Publication No. 4, pp. 29g-304. t A description of the leveling to obtain this profile and the height of Los Angeles Northwest Base from the sea will be found on p. 497.

Such large values would cast doubt upon the spirit leveling if it were not possible to check them by similar lines over this same arm of the Pacific Ocean. Eleven lines were selected where the line of sight for at least two-thirds of its length would lie over the water and connecting stations at which reciprocal zenith distances were observed. The coefficient of refraction, m, and its weight, p, for each line were computed by the usual formul~m - o. 5 _ p sin

It is therefore certain that the value 0.092, computed from the fixed elevations at the stations Gaviota, New San Miguel, and Santa Cruz West, points which lie at the junction of the sections which give the high value o. 105 and the low value 0.080, corroborates the elevations from spirit levels, which may now be adopted as absolute. All the observations here treated were made in daytime. It is also evident that lines over water have a tendency to have large coefficients of refraction.

ADJUSTMENT OF THR ELEVATIONS.

The zenith distances directly observed at each station were first computed and were corrected for height of object observed and of instrument, so as to refer them all to the station marks. The difference of elevation of each pair of stations in the main scheme where zenith distances had been observed was then computed from the observations over the line joining them by the formulah 2 -h 1 =stan

in which h. and h, are the elevations of the stations, t:. and t;, are the measured zenith distances, s is the horizontal distance between the stations, and p is the radius of curvature. As there were always two or more lines to each new station, many rigid conditions existed between the observed differences of elevd.tion, even if the connections with the precise leveling were ignored, and the least square adjustment furnishes the readiest accurate means of deriving the required elevations. The elevations from the stations Santa Ana and Mount Toro, to and including Soledad and Cuyamaca near the Mexican boundary, were adjusted in three sets of equations. The first adjustment involved all stations in the main primary scheme from the first two stations, Santa Ana and Mount Toro, to and including the three fixed elevations at Gaviota, New San Miguel, and Santa Cruz 'Vest. 'fhe second adjustment involved all the stations of the main primary scheme from San Pedro to Soledad and Cuyamaca. The third adjustment involved the stations of the main primary scheme from Gaviota and Santa Cruz West to Wilson Peak and San Pedro. In the following tabulation the observed differences of elevation treated in the first adjustment are shown, together with their adjusted values. The weight, p, assigned to each observed difference of elevation is inversely proportional to the square of the length, s, of the line between stations in meters and was conveniently computed by the formula log P= 10-2 logs. The observed difference of elevation is given the sign of the elevation of the second station named, minus the elevation of the first. The quantity contained in the last column. but one is the correction to be applied to an observed difference of elevation to obtain the adjusted difference of elevation.

In the first adjustment, of which the direct results are indicated above, the elevations of the stations Mount Toro and Santa Ana were fixed, by a previous adjustment in connection with the adjustment of. the transcontinental triangulation, at the values l 08 r. 2 and I 101.4 meters, respectively. Three other elevations were fixed by spirit leveling, viz, Gaviota, 748.91 meters; New San Miguel, 246.62 meters, and Santa Cruz West, 218.19 meters. The elevations of the nine remaining stations connected by the observations are the unknowns to be determined by least squares from the twenty-eight observed differences of elevation indicated above. In the case of those lines whose weights are indicated by an asterisk it is necessary to explain that the lack of any observations at the station Arguello compelled the "introduction of these lines to this point over which zenith distances were observed in one directon only. The value 0.092 for m, the coefficient of refraction, was used for the lines over water and the value 0.080 for the lines over land. The weight, p, for these lines was multiplied by 0.3 as the nearest approximation possible, when comparing zenith distances in one direction with zenith distances in both directions over a line. The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from the adjustment is ±2.45 meters. In other words, the reciprocal observations over a line 96 kilometers (60 miles) long, this being the length of the line corresponding to unit weight, deter*These are lines over which there are observations in one direction only and are used with reduced weight; see text.

mined the difference of elevation of two points with such a.degree of accuracy that it is an even chance whether the error is greater or less than 2.45 meters. The probable errors for lines of other lengths were assumed to be proportional to their lengths. The probable errors of the elevations of the three stations fixed by, spirit leveling may be assumed as about ±0.05 meter, one elevation depending upon a single line of levels only. The probable error approaches this value for stations adjacent to those fixed by leveling and is greatest for the most remote stations. Station San Jose was assumed to be the one least accurately determined, and its probable error was therefore computed as a limiting value and was found to be ±0.91 meter from the vertical angle measures alone, and, when combined with the probable error of the elevations fixed by the spirit leveling, it was not changed. In other words, for the least accurately determined station in the main scheme between the transcontinental triangulation and the Santa Barbara Channel, there is an even chance that the elevation is correct within 0.91 meter, or 2.99 feet, ~nd for most of the stations in the main scheme the accuracy is greater than this. The. results of the second adjustment, in which the .stations concerned are those from San Pedro and the Los Angeles base to Soledad and Cuyamaca, follow.

In this second ~djustment the elevations of three stations were ta)cen as fixed, namely: San Pedro, Los Angeles Northwest Base, and Los Angeles Southeast Base. The elevations of San Pedro and Los Angeles Northwest Base, had been determined by spirit leveling as 450.80 and 39.00 meters, respectively, and that of Los Angeles Southeast Base was computed at the time of the measurement of the base to be 32.70 meters. The elevations of the seven remaining stations connected by the observations are the seven unknowns determined by least squares from the twenty-three observed differences of elevation given in the above table.

The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from the adjustment is ±2. 79 meters. Unit weight corresponds to reciprocal observations over a line 96 kilometers (or 60 miles) long. The probable error of the elevations of the stations fixed by spirit leveling may be assumed to be not greater than ±0.05 meter. The probable errors of elevation vary from this to ±1.63 meters at station Cuyamaca, as explained in connection with the first adjustment.

In this third adjustment the elevations of four stations were taken as fixed, namely: Wilson Peak, fixed by the previous adjustment, its elevation being r 738.63 meters; and the stations, Gaviota, Santa Cruz West, and San Pedro fixed by spirit leveling, their elevations being 748.91, 218.19, and 450.80 meters, respectively. The elevations of the seven remaining stations connected by the observations are the seven unknowns determined by least squares from the twenty observed differences of elevation given in the above table. In the case of those lines whose weights are indicated by an asterisk the same explanation is necessary as that made for the first adjustment. The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from the adjustment is ±3·32 meten_;. Unit weight corresponds to reciprocal observatio!lS over a line 96 kilometers ( 60 miles) long. The probable error of the elevations of the stations fixed by spirit leveling may be assumed not to exceed ±0.05 meter. The probable errors of elevations vary from this to r .oo meter at station Santa Clara, as explained in connection with the first adjustment.

TABLI<: OP ELEVATIONS.

The datum for all the elevations is mean sea level. The stations are in three classes: first, those fixed directly by the spirit leveling, and of which the elevations are subject to a probable error of ± 0.05 meter; second, the primary stations fixed by recipro~al measures of vertical angles and which are subject to probable errors varying from ±o. 3 to ±I. 6 meters; and third, the tertiary stations, of which the elevations are fixed by measurements of vertical angles which are not reciprocal, the tertiary stations not being occupied, and whose elevations are subject to probable errors which may be as great as ± ro meters in some cases. The accuracy with which each elevation in the main scheme is determined depends mainly upon the remoteness of that station from the nearest one of which the elevation is fixed by spirit leveling, as indicated in class I of the following table. Station Cuyamaca is. probably least accurately determined of all the stations to the southward of the transcontinental triangulation whose elevations have been adjusted, its probable error being ±r.63 meter.
