REPORT.
UNITED STATES COAST A:><D GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, December 17, 1883. Sm: In conformity with law and with the regulations of the Treasury Department, I have the honor to present herewith my report of the progress made iu the work of the Ooast and Geodetic Survey during the fiscal year ending with June, 1883. The three parts into which this report is divided are arranged thus: Part I is mainly occupied with a general statement of progress under the several heads of Field-work, Ofiice-work, Discoveries and Developments, and Special Scientific work; with the estimates in detail for the next fiscal year, and with an explanation of those estimates. Part II is devoted to detailed recitals of field-work begun, continued, or completed during the fiscal year, concluding with a reference to the office-work. In Part III are comprised the several appendices relating to work in the field and office which appear annually, and other papers deemed worthy of publication as presenting discussions of the methods and result9 of the Survey.

PART I.
An examination of Appendix No. 1, which exhibits the distribution of the surveying par:ies, will show that there has been steady progress in the Survey in all of its branches, and it is believed that by a close and rigid scrutiny of expenditure the utmost results have been secured that the limited appropriations would admit of. Among the more important operations during the past fiscal year may be enumerated the connection of the triangulation of the Atlantic coast with that of the Great Lakes; the resurvey of Long Island Sonnd, upon which, as demanded by the extensive commercial interests involved, a large force was concentrated; the approach to completion of the resurvey of Delaware Bay and River; the continuation of the explorations of the North Atlantic .Basin by lines of deep-sea sounding and observationl!l of surface, serial, and bottom temperatures; the extension of the line of transcontinental leveling of precision to Saint Louis, Mo.; the progress made in the geodetic surveys of the interior States and in the primary t.riangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel, intended to unite the triangulations of the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasbi in one geodetic system; the verification for the Interior Department of the survey of the northern boundary of Wyoming Territory; the observations of the Transit of Venus of December, 1882, at stations in the United. States, and at a smtion of the Transit of Veuus Commission in New Zealand; the observation of the Total Eclipse of the Snn of May, 18S3, at a station in the South Pacific, and the determinations of the force of gravity by means of penclulum observations at stations on the .Atlantic and Pacific coasts, at stations of the Transit of Venus Commission in South America and New Zealand, and at other stations in the East Indies, Japan, and the Sandwich Islands.

A special appropriation havi·Jg been made by Congress for the observation of the Total Eclipse of the Sun at an island in the South Pacific, one of the younger officers of the Survey was ordered to join the expedition and to make at the eclipsfl station selected (Caroline Island) a series of pendulum experiments for the determination of gravity. Returning, he was instructed to obtain comparative determinations at stations in the Sandwich Islands and at San Francisco, Cal.
I I.-01<' E'l CE-WORK.

The records of field-work of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1883, received at the office have been duly distributed to the several divisions for examination and deduction of results, to be used in the production of the charts and other publications of the Survey. In accordance with the office organization, the records which pertain to astronomical, geodetic, and magnetic observations are referred to the Computing Division; those relating to tidal observations, to topographic and hydrographic surveys, are referred to the Tidal, the Drawing, and the Bydrographic Divisions, respectively. The office labor proper consists in the verification of field records and computations; in the drawings and reductions for the preparation of the charts; in the engraving, electrotyping, printing, and issuing of the' charts; m the computations for the prediction of tides, and the publicat,ion of Tide Tables; in the labor of the preparation and publication of the Coast Pilot; in the care of the records of the work, and in the making and maintenance of the geodetic instruments used on the survey. Tide Tables of the principal ports of the United States for the year 1884, based on the redactions and discussions of the observations already made, have been published. The drawings of forty-two charts have been in progress, and of this number twenty-eight have been finished, including fourteen for publication by photolithography. Drawings have been made of five instruments of precision to accompany the annual report.s, together with eighteen miscellaneous sketches and diagrams for the illustration of scientific papers. Fifteen copper-plate engravings of charts and thirty-four of sketches and illustrations have been begun; four hundred and thirty-seven plates of cl1arts and sketches have received corrections; the engraving of nineteen plates of charts has been continued; the plates of twenty-seven charts and eight sketches and illustrations have been completoo. Forty-eight thousand three hundred and twenty prints were made from copper plates; of this number, fourteen thonsand one hundred and sixty-five were charts and views illustrating the Atlantic Coast Pilot, and one hundred and eighty-two were transfer proofs, to be printed fr&m stone. Eighteen alto and twenty-two basso electrotype plates were made for the office during the year, and twelve alto and fourteen basso plates for other Departments of Government.

III.-DISCOVERIES AND DEYELOP:MEN'l'8.

All obstructions or dangers to rnwigation discM'ered in the progress of the work are prnmptl;y reported to the· SuperintPndeut, aud ~otices to Mariuers are issued for wide and free. distribution, in which are stated the locality of the tlanger and the best way of arnidiug; it. Refrrellce is matle also to the charts of the Suney affrch'd by the noticP. Six such notices were issued during· the past fiscal year, nurnbere1l from 34 to 39, inclusive, in the regular series. No. 34, dated August 24, 1882, gave the location and description of a dangerous rock in the eastern entrance to Fisher'8 Island Sound, as furnished bJ I,ient. Richardson Clover, U. S. N., Assistant, Coast Survey. No. 35, bearing date of January 4, 1883, described dangerous rocks, reported by the same officer, in the western part of Fisher's Island Sound, and in the approaches to ~ ew London and Mystic Harbors. No. 36, May 14, 1883, gives notice of a sunken wreck i11 the track of vessels along the New Jersey coast, reported and determined in Jlosition b~· Lieut. Commander W. H. Brownson, U.S. N., Assistant, Coast Survey. In No. 37, June 8, notice was given of a wreck partly out of water in the track of \'essels along the east coast of Florida, reported by Capt. F. Read, commanding the steamship Chalmette. . No. 38, June 19, gave an account of a dangerous rock, hitherto unknown, in Surge Narrows, Peril Strait. Southeastern Alaska, described in a communication received from Lieut. G. C. Hanus, U. S N., Assistant, Coast Survey. No. 39, June 22, 1883, cautioned coasting vessels standing inside of the Five-Fathom Bank against a sunken vessel in their track off Townsend Inlet, N. J.
IV .-SPECIAL SCIENTI:fi'IC WORK.
THE TRANSIT OF VENUS.

The results for the solar parallax, deduced from observations of the Transit of Venus of 1874, and considerations thence derived in regard t-0 the best methods of observing the Tmnsit of 1882, induced the Commission authorized by Congress to take early action in the organization of parties, and in the publication of detailed instructions for the observation of this event, so important both to astronomy and geodesy. Observations of the Transit were made by officers of the Coast Survey at a number of stations, some of which were specially designated by the Transit of Venus Commission. At Washington, D. C., a station was occupied at Fauth's Observatory, nearly opposite the southwest corner of the lower Capitol Park. The weather on the day of the Transit (December 6) being generally favorable, all four contacts were observed. A station in New Mexico having been decided upon by the Commission, one was selected at Cerro Roblero, an isolated mountain mass rising abruptly to a height of nearly 1,700 feet from the right bank of the Rio del Norte, and about four miles from the-military post at Fort Selden. Satisfact-Ory observations were obtained of all four contacts at Cerro Roblero, un<ler very favorable atmospheric conditions. The tl'ansit was observe.d at the Davidson Observatory, in San Francisco, Cal.; at the Coast aud Geodetic Survey s~tion, Tepusquete, Cal., and at Lehman Ranch, Nev. .. Observations or the Transit were made at Auckland, New Zealand, one of the stations of the Commission. But partial success attended the observations made at this station, the sun being at no time during the Transit entirely free from clouds. Reports of the observations of the Transit made at the stations of the Transit of Ven us Commission have been transmitted t-0 the president of the Commission; duplicates of these reports will be preserved in the archives of the Survey. Reports of observations made by officers of the Survey at other stations will appear as Appendix No. 16 to this report..

THE TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE OF MAY

6, 1883.

Under the provisions of a clause in the act of March 3, 1883, making an appropriation for ihe observation of the 'rotal Eclipse of the Sun of May 6, at a station in the South Pacific Ocean, b.Y au expedition to be organized for that purpose under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, with the co-operation of the Uoast and Geodetic Survey, an officer of the Survey was ordered to report for duty on this expedition. The observation of this eclipse was regarded with special interest, because of its having the longest totalitJ· of auy that had ever been observed, nearly five and a half minutes. The opportunity for studying the physical phenomena of the eclipse would therefore be an exceptional one. Caroline Island, a chain of small islands of coral formation in the South Pacific, was selected as the point of observation. The weather was clear during the totality, except a slight haze for a minure or two at beginning, and all four contacts were successfully observed. Details are given in au abstract of the observer's report, which appears as Appendix No. 17.
FIELD CATALOGUE OF

1,278 TIJliE AND CIRCUMPOLAR Sl'ARS.

The first edition of a Field Oatalogue of Time and Circumpolar Stars, prepared for the use of observers with portable instrumen·s in the temporary observatories of the Survey, was published in 1874. It contained 983 staes. A new edition has been compiled, and is now ready for publication, which contains 1,278 stars, their mean places being given for the epoch 1885.0-the right ascensions to the nearest tenth of a second of time, and the declinations to the nearest second of arc. It includes the standard stars of the American E11hemeris and Nautical Almanac, of the English Nautical Almanac, of the Connaissance des Temps, and of the Berliner Astronomische Jahrbuch, together with stars selected from the standard catalogues, giving the preference to those of the Naval Observatory, Harvard College Observatory, and the Observatory of Greenwich. Of the 1,278 stars iu this catalogue, the apparent places of 752 are given in the ephemerides. For the conYenience of observers the catalogue is to be published separately in octavo form, and will also appear as Appendix No. 18 to this report.
DETERMINATIONS OF GRAVITY.

Determinations of the force of gr:n-it_v, both absolute and relative, by means of pendulum experiments and observations, ha\'e been continued during the yeHr. As an important factor in the investigation of the figure of the earth, such determinations have always formed an essential part of a geodetic survey. In the United States the principal stations at which pendulums were oscillated were Albany, Hoboken, Baltimorn, "\Yashington, Saint Augustine, and San Francisco. A station was also occupied in Montreal, Canada. Advantage was taken of the presence of observers experienced in pendulum work with the national expeditions for the observation of the Transit of Venus and the Total Solar Eclipse to obtain results for gravity at stations widely distributed over the earth's surface, thus adding valuable data for the determination of the compression of the earth at comparatively small cost. At the Transit of Venus station in Auckland, Nt·w Zealand, were swung the three Kater invariable pendulums. These pendulums, of historic importance, which had been oscillated at Greenwich, Kew, and London, and subsequently at the Coast and Geodetic Survey stations in Hoboken and Washington, having been left in thP- custodJ' of the Survey, the opportuuity of obtain1ng by means of them observations strictly comparable, at stations geographically far apart, was a most valuable one. In accordance with instructions, the party of observation, on their return trip, swung the Kater pendulums at Sydney, New South Wales, at Singapore, Straits Settlements, British India, at Tokio, Japan, and at San Francisco. The officer of the Survey who accompanied the Total Solar Eclipse expedition to Caroline Island, in the South Pacific, bad in bis charge pendulum No. 3, with instructions t;o oscillate it at the eclipse station, and also, upon his homeward voyage, at a station occupied upon the island of .Maui by De Fre~·cinet in 1819, and at a station in Honolulu, Sandwich Islands. In order to obtain certain necessary observations supplementary to and completing the opera-

tions formerly executed for the purpose of connecting the American and English initial gravity statiom1, a Coast and Geodetic Survey officer was sent to Europe in J\fay, 1883. In the spring of 1883 instructions were issued for obtaining at San Francisco a series of gravity determinations to be made at Point Barrow, Alaska, by an observer of tbe Coast Survey attached to the Signal Service relief expedition wlticb sailed from Sau I?rancisco about the middle of June.
RESULTS FOR THE LENGTH OF THE YOLO BASE.

A full account of the measurement of the primary base-line in Yolo County, Cal., with the new compensation base apparatus, was given in my last annual report. Tbe results for length of the base as deduced from the measurements and compari8ons are di8cussed in a paper which is published as Appendix No. 11 to this report. The accuracy of the final result appears greater than that of any obtained for auy other baseline on the survey. This is attributed mainly to the vers careful handliug of the apparatus during the measurement, and also to the precautions taken to secure daily comparisons with the standard. The author of the paper expresses his belief that the question whether a base apparatus compensated for changes of temperature or one uncompensated would pro1e to be the most desirable is still unsolved. This is in consequence of the irregular contraction of the zinc bars as experienced in the present apparatus, the effocts of which were only overcome by extra labor of comparison with the standard. The fact that the degree of accuracy actually reached i8 far greater than cau be preserved, even in the ver_y perfect measures of the angles of the tir8t quadrilateral, does not set at rest the question of the most effective base apparatus, since besides accuracy, rapidity, aud ease of handling, in a word, economy in measurement is also a very important factor.
VERIFICATION OF THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF WYOMING TERRITORY.

The occasion of the detail of an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, at the request of the Interior Department, to make an examination upon the ground of the survey of the northern boundary of Wyoming Territory, made for that Department under contract, was fully stated in my last annual report. At the beginning of the fiscal year 1882-'83 the work of verification was in full progress. By the close of August the .field examination was finished. It was conducted nuder special instructions drawn up in accordance with the conclusions arrived at by the Commission appointed during the previous winter, and the work was executed in a manner entirely to the satisfaction of myself and the Secretary of the Interior.
PHYSICAL HYDROGRAPHY.

Much attention bas been given during the past year to the study of questions in physical hydrography, the solution of which promises practical usefulness in connection with navigation and proposed public works. A special investigation has been called for in the progress of the physical survey of Delaware Bay and River. This survey has now so nearly advanced to completion that a classific::ttion of its results has become possible with reference to the determinations of' mean tleptb, areas of crosssection, and the laws which govern the changes in channel-ways and the movement of the tides. In a report which was printed as Appendix No. 13 to the report for 1879, three rules were pointed out which simplified the conception of the physical scheme of Delaware Bay. '.rhey were deduced from a study of the printed charts, based upon the surveys of nearly forty years ago, but the new surveys, made with all modern refinements, confirm these rules in the most satisfactory manner. The author now furnishes the following statement, worked out from large collections of new data, which cannot fail to be valuable in considering plans for improvement to navigation or for the reclamation ,,f tide-lands: "In the f#Jtuary of the J)elaware, from J,,eague Island to the submerged delta., fifty miles below, the mean deytk ii constant; the icidtks and sootio'IUl vary with the square of the distance, and the retard of the tide can be exactly Btated in terms of the mean deptlt and width."

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

It is the first instance, perhaps, in which, with a constancy of mean depth, the effect of width upon the rate of tidal propagation could be accurately determined. In Appendix No. 9 to the report for 1878 the details of this investigation were given, and in Appendix No. 8 to my report for the present year are stated the conclusions derived from a careful study of the recent surveys.
MAXIMA. AND MINIMA TIDE-PREDICTING MACHINE.

A description, with drawings, of a machine for computing tides, devised and constructed for the use of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, will he given in Appendix No. 10 to this report. With it can be determined mechanically the times and heights of high and low water at the numerous ports upon our coast for which Tide Tables are puhlisheu a year in advance. These times and heights are gh-eu directly in figures upon a dial and scah·, to be tabulated by the op"rator. The working capacity of the machine is estimated to be at least that of twenty computers. Results obtained by means of it for the Boston tides of 1884, and compared with results from computation, presented a satisfactorJ agreement.
HARMONIC ANALYSIS OF THE '!'IDES OF SANDY HOOK.

At Sandy Hook, N. J., which is a port of reference for the tides on the south coast of Long Island, for those on the New Jersey coast between Keyport and Cape May, and for the tides at Cape Henlopen and the Delaware Breakwater, a self.registering tide-gauge has been maintained for several years. In order to deduce a series of tidal constants which will 8erve in future for the close prediction of tides at this important station, the hourly co ordinates of the heights of the tide as measured from the curves recorded for six years (1875 to 1881, inclusive) have been treated b~· the method of harmonic anal,ysis. This paper appears as Appendix No. 9 to this report. In a report on a discussion of the tides of Penobscot Bay (Appendix No. 11 for 1878) a full account was given of the method of appl~·ing the harmonic analysis to the investigation of the laws of tidal action.
DEEP-SEA EXPLORATIONS IN TIIE WESTERN PART OF THE NOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN.

The deep-sea explorations which have been prosecuted -for several years past in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean have been continued. For the special purpose of developing the limits and general character of that part of the Atlantic Basin between Bermuda and the Bahamas, and to the eastward as far as St. Thomas, a systematic investigation of the confignra tion of the ocean bed in those localities was made during the past winter by deep-sea sounding and dredging, with observations of surface, serial, and bottom tempel'atures. Many interesting results were obtained during this cr11ise, one of the most noteworthy of which was the successful sounding taken at the great depth of four thousand five hundred and sixLy-one fathoms about seventy-five miles to the northward of Porto Rico. The temperature at this depth was found to be 36fO Fahr., and the specimen·cup brought up brown ooze. No record is known of any sounding from which bottom specimen and temperature have been obtained at a depth equaling this. A mo.lei of the bottom of our Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico, based upon the Coast Survey soundings, was constructed at this office, and being exhibited at the recent International Fisheries Exposition in London attracted much notice and received great commendation. '

EXPLANATION 01', ESTIMATES.

With the detailed estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1885, which were transmitted

to the Treasury Department in NoYember last, was !mbmittetl the following statement:
In submitting the estimates for the Uoast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year 1884-'85, I beg leave to bring to your attention the points in which the.}' differ trom the appropriations for the current fiscal year, and to ask your approval ot the same.

UNITED STATES CO.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The aggregate amount asked is $fi70,500, while the aggregate appropriation for the current year is $655,290. There is no grl'at disparity in these amounts, but it must be noted that this year's appropriatiOIJ contains an amount of $100,000 for the building of a new steamship for the coast of Alaska. The· chief increase in the e:stimates is for the item of "party expenses," which comprise the pay of those temporarily employed as recorders, signal-men, bands, cooks, drivers or boatmen, as the case may be, the subsistence and transportation of tl1e parties, and all requisite materials, tents, boats, and all other necessaQ· expen8es incident to tlie work. The o~jcct of proposing- this increase is to obtain a proper economic proportion between the expense of putting the surn>yiug parties in the field and the length of time that they can be kept at work. This should be as long as permitted h,v tlie season favorable for field work in the several localities. In order to n eet this condition it is necessar;y that the amount available for "party expenses" should h(> at least half as large again as it has been of late years, and I am constrained by a consideration of reasonable economy to submit estimates for an increased amount. As compared with the Yast extent of our coast, the localities at which the work is going on are few and far het\reen, and the only other mode of doing the work with due economy, with the present means, wonld be to discontinue the survey for the present at many points where it is now in progress. The next item iu the appropriation, that for "transcontinental geodetic work," is slightly increased for the same considerations. The item for ''aid to State surveyg" is increased by $,1,000, owing to the growing demand for this means of verif.ying the imrveys of the different States. In the item of "1my in field" the small increase in the estimate is rendered necessary by the reasonable expectation of advancemellt in the lower gradeR. The probable diminution of expenditure from natural causes in the higher grades may make the additional expenditure unnecessary. The ag·gregate of the ··pay in office'' remains unchanged, although variations may occur in details. The "rent" charges equally remain unchanged. The amount for "office expenses" is inereased by about $6,400, owing to the constantly growing demand for the results of the work. The item for "repairs of vessels" is increased by $3,000, to bring it up to the ordinary amount (reduced 10 per cent. last year), and b;y $12,000 for putting new boilers in the steamer Hassler, which has now been in service twelve ~·ears. I trust that the foregoing explauations will warrant your approval of' the estimates submitted.

PART II.
In this part of the report are given condensed statements of the operations of the field parties of the SurYey in the several localitie6 upon the Atlantic arnl Pacific coasts and in the interior . States. These statements are arranged in a geographical order, under the headings of the several sections. Upon the Atlantic coast they include localities between .Machias Bay, Me., and Matagorda Bay Tex.; and upon the Pacific, portions of that coast between Los Angeles, Cal., and Point Barrow, Alaska. In the interior States the geocletic surYeJ'S which are intended to complete the connection between the work on the eastern and western coasts, and those in progress for the purpose of furnishing points to State surveys, are referred to in sections, each of which comprises two or more States, beginning with those)iearest the Atlantic coast. Appendix No.1 exhibits in tabular form the distribution of the surve~·ing parties, the names of persons conducting field-work, and the nature of the work performed. Assistant Richard D. Cutts, in charge of the Uoast and Geodetic Survey Office, presents in Appendix No. 4 a comprehensive report of the operations of the office during the fiscal year, and accompanies it with the reports of the chiefs of the sen·ral office diYisious. The close relation between efficient administration in the o:f:licfl and results commensurate with the means employed in the field has been fully recognized by Assistant Cutts, and my indebtedness to him for constant and cordial co operation is very great. The report of Commander C. JU. Chester, U.S. N., Hydrographic Inspector, appears in Appendix No. 5. I have committed to him all matters pertaining to tl1e arrangement of bydrographic work, the assignment to duty of uava.J officers attached to the Survey, the care and disposition of vessels, and the direction of the labors of the hydrographic draughtsmen. His aid and counsel in this branch of the gervice I ham found invaluable. With his report is given a list of the officers of the Na,·y on duty in the Survey during the fiscal year, a statement of the condition of the vessels engaged in the work, and a summary of' the work accomplished hy the hydrographic draughtsmen employed in the office. Lieut. J.E. Pillsbury, U.S. N., was on duty dt1ring the year as assistant hydrographic inspector. By his systematic and earnest efforts the office was enabled to keep the charts of the Survey up to the latest da.tes in respect to changes made or contemplated in Aids to Navigation. In these efforts he had the hearty co-operation of the Light-House Board, through its secretaries. For early information in regard to such changes Commander Chester expresses his thanks to those officers. Lieut. Richards01,.1 Clover, U.S. N., Assistant, Coast Survey, was on duty part of the year, and assisted in the preparation of the plans and specifications for the new steamer for the Pacific coast.

early in August, 1882, were directed toward~ the recovery of stations of the triangulation begun in 186i but interrupted at that time by the course of public ennts. 'l'wo of these stations, "Howard" and "Lowell," were identified, and with the base thus obtained all needed triangulation points were determined. Th~ shore-lines of the bay and rivers with the islands in the vicinity were delineated upon two topographic sheets, extending from Cross and Libby Islands, at l\lachia;; Bay entrance (and including Machias Port), to the bridges over the Machias and East .Machias Rivers, some fifteen miles from the sea.

Reference will be made to the work of Assistant Bosd during the winter season on the coast of Louisiana under the head of Section VIII. Topography of islands in llfoos-a-bec Reach, and shore-line of Chandler's Bny, Me.-It being desirable to fill certain gaps in the topographic survey of the islands near the eastern entrauce to Moos-a-bee Heach, and of the northern shore of the reach in tbe Yicinity of Jonesport, Assistaut Eugene Ellicott was directed to take up this work, a11d arrhed at Jonesport early in August. After completing the surrny of the outer face of Head Harbor Island, Stm'le's Harbor IslaIHl, and Great Wass Island, Mr. Ellicott took up the unfinished topogrnphy of the northern shores of the reach, near Jonesport, and between '\Yest River and Carrying-Place Cove. :\Inch cutting had to be done here, the country being densely wooded. This portion of the sur,-e.r wa>< finished towards the close of October, and work upon the Chundler's Bay sheet was in progress wheu Mr. Ellicott's ser\'ices were required in another field of labor, and under instructions :X ovember 11, further operations were suspended.

Work executed by Mr. Ellicott under subsequent assignments will be referred to under the heads of Sections III and VI. Topography of the shores of Pleasant River, 1lfe.-The completion of the t-0pogra.phical survey of the shores of Pleasant Hiver, Me., to the head of tide-water, having been assigned to Assistant A. W. Longfellow, that officer took the field as soon as funds were available for the work, and, beginning about a mile below Addison's Point Village, extended the topography of the river-shores to a little above Columbia Falls Village, including the mill-pond there. Vertical angles for contour curves gave an elevation for this pond of 17.4 feet abo\·e high water. Both Addison's Point and Columbia Falls ha,·e been ship-building localities. Vessels of one hundred and fifty tons can load at the Falls, and two were built there during the preceding season. The Pleasant River is a tidal stream up to tbe Falls, winding through salt marshes, wbich are generally diked, but subject to overflow at spring and storm tides to their limits at the upland. The survey was completed on the 24th of November.

bert Harbor) early in ,fuly, 1882. Having selected an anchorage about half a mile above Gull Rocks, and establiRhed a tide-gauge which was referred to a bench-mark upon Boisbubert Island, soundings were begun, and tlrn work was prosecuted as rapidly as good results would allow. Great care was taken to find all llidden dangers; ledges and rocks were buoyed and developed separatel3·; fishermen and local pilots were consulted as to names familiar by long usage in the locality. Lieutena11t Colhy remarks in regard to Boisbubert Harbor that it is spoken of as a place much exposed in southerly gales, and that sucli is the impression formed at, first sight, and in a measure true, th formation of the land giving little protection from the wind. But. from the sea the protection is almost perfect, the rocks and ledges which make this harbor so difficult o.f access from the southward formiug a bre::i 1·water, so that during the heavy winter gales nothing more than "a chop" is experienced. The followiug e-xtracts from Lieutenant Oolb;y's report will be of interest: "Petit Manau Bar, which extends from Petit l\.fanan Point to the islands, is one continuous line of ledges and rocks; there arc two chanuels over the bar, one close in to the point and the other about two-thirds of the distanee totbe islands. The former is crooked and narrow, withsevera.J detached rocks, not fit for strangers; the latter is buoyed and can be used by vessels of light draught after two hour8' fioou. " .. "" The tide runs nearly east and west across the bar. In anything more than ordinary weatlier there is one line of breakers the entire length of the bar, and it cannot be crossed with safety." "The «Whale' is a rock wl1ich lies about half a mile south of Egg Hock; it is one of the prin· cipal dangers of Pigeon Hill Bay, as at high water, with little or no swell, there is nothing to mark the localit.r oft his rock. B1:>twce11 the V\'hale a111l Egg Rock no dangers were found, which leads to the belief that there is a goou channel here by keeping dear of the rocky point making off to the southward ot Egg Hoek. Thi:,i ledge was developed by placing two buo;ys on the two shoalest spots, and ruuning lines across nearly at right angles, in order to show as nearly as possible the shape and formation, which at half-tide has, as the name implies, the appearance of a large whale. "To tlie north of Egg I~ock, between it and Little Bubert, the bottom is very irregular, composed of ledges aml large hlrn'lders, and is not a safe place for vessels of any size." The hydrograpliy of Pigeon Hill Bay was completed before the close of the season, with the exception of some soundings to the northeast of Pond Island and the ledge known as Jordan's Delight. During the summer au iron spindle was fixed by the Light-House Board upou the southern point of this ledge. Tbe spindle was carefully established in position by the hydrographic party aud used as a signal. Additional work executed h.r Lien tenant Colby iucluded soundings for a more complete development of tl1e bot.tom off Gouldsborongh Bay, examination of a doubtful spot in Dyer's Bay, and soundings nee.de.a to complete the .snrYey of Hockland Harbor, Me. During the seawn Cll(liug in November, 1882, the following-named officers .,.,ere attached to the party: Ensigns David Daniels, O. G. Dodge, and A. Jeffries, U.S. N.

Tidal observations.-As heretofore for several years past, the series of tidal and meteorological observations at Pulpit Cove, North Haven Island, Penobscot Bay, has been kept up by Mr. .r. G. Spau]djng. A continnat.ion of this series for about six years longer will be desirable at this fundamental station, in order to obtain data which will fulfill the conditions required for investigating the laws of the tides on the Atlantic coast of the United States. But few interruptions of the record have occurred since its beginning in 1870, the self-registering tide-gauge being supplied with a. hot. water apparatus, which has kept it in action in the coldest winter weather.

Primary triangulation for the connection of the station upon 1lfount l'(a.shington, N. H., with the triangulation of Maine and of the Hudson Rii,er a.nd Lake Champlain.-The tower a11d tripod erected over the Uoast and Geodetic Survey station on the summit of Mount "\Yasbingtou were usetl during the season of 1881 for the secondary triangulation of New Hampshire. There still remained, however, to be observed at that station the primary lines conneeting the triangnlation of .i\faillt> with the series covering the valleys of the Hudson Ri,rer and Lake Clmmplain; aud for the purpo~e of avoiding a not improbable risk of the overturning or tiltiug of the tower by the violent storms of winter, it waR deemed advisable to haYe the remaining and actually necessary obRerYations made there at as early a date as possible. Accordingly, at the beginning of the fiscal year, Assistant Richard D. CuttR was instructed to organize a party to take charge of this special work, and to direct it iI.1 person i11 the field at. ~mch times and for such periods as his duties a» Ai;;sistant. iu charge of thf' office would permit. Mount Blue, in Maiue, l\fount ::\fausfield, in VrmoHt, and o<lier statious to he 8elflcted in the northern part of New Hampshire and l\Iaine and along tLe honndary line between the United States and Canada were to be included in the scheme of work, which, as tlms laJd out, involved an extensive reconnaissance. Under the direction of AissiRtant Cutts this reeom1aissa11ce was made by Mr. John A. McNicol during the month of July. Many points were examined and the positions of seven stations were approximately fixed, ineluding Oxford l\Iount, i11 Cmiada, and Camel's R.ump and Mount Azischohos, in Maine. At this last-named station a signal wa:-; erect«d au<l obse1Ted upon from .Mount Washington. Tl1e summits of tlle other ILom1tt1ins were so deiist>ly woode!l that it was not possible to open t~ different lines aud to obserYe from Mount \Vashington during the same season. Near the close of July the occupation of Mount \\7 ashington station began. Tieliotropers had been posted on Mount Blue and Mount Pleasant, :Me.; Gnnstock, N. H.; l\Ionnts Killington and Mansfield, Vt. Every favorable opportunity was taken to advance the work, and upon reaching the station, August 10, Assistant ()utts assuuw<l perl'onal chargt> of the p:ut.'·· The directions of the five principal stations were each determim'd hy thirty-fiye obsen·ations taken in seven positions of the instrument; vertical angles were also measured on the same summits, and a fow on other summits, the total number of such measurements heing one hundrecl and sixty-two. Observations were completed September 1~. The lengths of the line:; observed from Mount Washington are as follows:

Stations occupied in continuation of tlte triangulation of the State of Vermont.-The duty of continuing the triangulation in the southern part of the State of Vermont having hel'Il assigned to Prof. V. G. Barbour, Acting Assistaut, by instructions datd July 1, 1882, prPparations were begun in the early part of the month for the occupation of Halifax station, in \Vimlharn County_ The observationi,; of horizontal and vertical angles required at this station were completed by the close of July, and a few dayi,; early in An gust were occupied in stationing heliotropers on :\founts Man8- ' field and Killington for the primary triang·ulation part~' on Mount 'Vasliington referred to under a preYious hea.diug i11 this section. Preliminary arrangements were at the same time made for the occupation of Haystack Mountain, in tQe town of °"rilmiugton. A temporary camp was established at tlie foot of the mountain until a road could be cut to a point half a mile distant from the summit. At. this point, eigbt hundred feet below ttw summit, the camp of occupation was Pstablished. From tLe camp to the station, the ascent beiug too steep for horses or oxen to travel, the observing tent. and in.struments were carried by baud. Observations were lwgun Angust 18 :.ind completeu on the 30th, eight signals and the chnrcb spires of three villages having been ohsen·ed.

L·ine of deep-sea .wundings from o_tf Nant1ickct across the Gnlf St~am.-In continuation of the investigations relating to the depth and temperature of the western part of the North Atlantic, Lieut.-Comnrnnder W. H. Brownson, U. S. N., Assistant Coast aml Geodetic Survey, upon assuming charge of the hydrographic party on board the steamer Blake in August, 1882, was instructed to run a line of soundings, with serial temperatures, from the vicinity of Nan tuck.et acro»s the course of the Gulf Stream. Tlie Blake had already been engag·ed iu similar work under the direction of Uommander J. R. Bartlett, U. S. N., Assistant Uoast ttnd Geodetic Survey_ For reference to this see Sections II and VI. The vessel being fitted witli all needful apparatus, the work assigned to Lieutenant-Commander Brownsou occupied but a few days, and was completed August 24. His line of soundings began off Nantucket, in latitude 400 52', longitude 690 49' west of Greenwich, aud ended in latitude 37° 19', longitude 66° 35' west of Greenwich. At this point a depth of two thousand seven hundred and fifty-six fathoms was sonnded, the temperature at this depth being 36!}° Fahr. Returning towards the coast, a shorter line of soundings was run, and the Blake then proceeded to Providence, R. I., where preparations were made for off-shore work south of l1ong Island.

In continuation of these investigations, under instructions dated in June, 1882, Commander Bartlett, with his party in the Blake, left New York July 15, and the next day began a line of soundings with surface, bottom, and serial temperatures from off Montauk Point towards the Bermudas. Three additional lines were run before the return of the steamer to New York in August, one from the Bermudas to Cape Hatteras, one from Cape Henry to the outer limits of the Gulf Stream, and one from the last station reached on this line to New York, where the Blake arrived August 14. The leading facts of the cruise are stated in the following extracts from Commander Bartlett's report: "The first sounding taken on this line (from off l\lontauk Point to the Bermudas) was just beyond the one hundred-fathom curve in two hundred and sixty-six fathoms. 8oundings were then taken every twenty miles until July 20; after this date we made only an occasional sounding. · · · We crossed the ordinary limit of the Gulf Stream in latitude 390 15' north, longitude 100 west. From our departure from Montauk light, I steered direct for the Bermudas, being a course SSE. (T. M.); this course I intended changing on entering the Stream to allow for the set of the current. I crossed the imaginary limit, aml continued the same course of SSE. until reaching latitude 380 45' north, longitude 700 13' west. The temperature of the surface water just outside of the one hundred-fathom curve was 680; it gradually rose to 700, 720, and 730, and at last .to 750, when the course was changed to S. by W. (T. M.) to allow for a two-knot current and the time necessary to cros:> the Stream to its southern limit. "No easterly current was detected on this new course until reaching the vicinity of latitude 370 02' north, longitude 700 40 1 west. During the time that we were in the current we had no observations of sufficient value to give its direction or force. The wind was fresh from the south· west and the current northeasterly at least three miles per hour. We lost the current again in about latitude 36° 35' north, longitude 69° 25' west. On the southern side of the Stream I observed immense quantities of the Gulf weed extending in long lines with the wind and sea. · · · The character of the bottom of the several soundings was a light gray ooze, as preYiously found by H.B. M. S. Cha11enger. · · · The temperature of the surface water was taken at every mile of distance.run, by means of an ordinary thermometer, the water for that purpose being drawn over the stern, where it was stirred up by the propeller. The temperature of the suface was also taken forward at each sounding and serial station. "The surface temperatures taken did not indicate any bifurcation of the Stream into warm and oold band!!, as had been previously reported. The temperature of the surface increased gradually from 680 near the hundred-fathom line to 750, and remained at 740 and 750 until we entered the Stream when it rose as high as 800 and s10, and continued at nearly the same temperature all the way to the Bermudas. There was a slight rise and fall of the temperature of the surface water between day and night, and also a fall during heavy squalls of rain, but even when we found the fall of t.empera.ture at the surface, it was not indicated at five and ten fathoms. "At every sounding the t.emperatare at the bottom was obtained by a Miller-Oasella thermometer attached t.o the stra.y line about ten feet above the sinker. The temperature of the bottom at the ftrst sounding of two hundred and sixty-six fathoms was 4<q.0 · I found as low a temperature as this clOl!e to the shore in twenty-four fathoms, but it increased two or three degrees as the water deepened towards the one hundred fathom line. At eleven hundred and seventy-four fathoms the S. Ex. 29 S

18

bottom temperature was 37~0; at fifteen hundred fathoms from 36° to 36!0 ; at greater depths it was 360 and 35~0, which was the lowest that we obtained. "F1·om the first sounding, a series of temperatures were: taken every ten miles to a depth of twenty-five fathoms, temperatures being taken fi\'e, ten, fifteen, and twenty-five fathoms. · · · The temperatures below the surface on all lines were taken with the Miller-Casella thermometers The readings of these thermometers have not been corrected for any error owing to pressure, but those in use were compared each day with a standard, and any which did not record accurately, or in which the mercury was broken, were laid on one side. "After steaming eighty miles, and just before reaching the supposed ordinary limit of the Stream, the serials to twent.y-fi,-e fathoms were increased so as to be only five miles apart on the remainder of the line to the Bermudas. A serial was taken every ten miles to two hundred fathoms at the following depths: Fifty, seventy-five, one hundred, one hundred and fifty, and two hundred fathoms; a serial to eight hundred fathoms every twenty miles, at three hundred, four hundred, six hundred, and eight hundred fathoms, each serial being complete from the surface to the greatest depth. All of the temperatures below the surface were taken with the thermometer fastened to the steel sounding wire, a thirty-six pound lead being used as a sinker." Commander Bartlett arrived at the Bermudas on the afternoon of July 25, and remained in port only long enough to swiug the vessel so as to determine any change in the deviation of the compass since swinging at Niantic Bay, Long Island Sound, before starting on the cruise. He found a slight change in the deviation, which he attrilmted to the effect of the dynamo-machine connected with the electric light. Leaving the Bermudas, a line for temperatures only was run to Cape Hatteras, temperatures of the surface beiug taken every mile; those to twenty-five fathoms every ten miles; those to four hundred fathoms every thirty miles, and to eight hundred fathoms every sixty miles. Upon entering the current of the Gulf Stream the deep serials were taken at half the above distances. Bad weather was encountered upon nearing Hatteras, and the position of the last serial which could be obtained in the heavy sea having been established, the steamer put into Hampton Roads Angust 2. Here Lieutenant-Commander W. H. Brownson reported on board for duty in anticipation of taking command of the Blake, and on the 10th of August Commander Bartlett began a line of soundings due east from Cape Henry ligl1t. The soundings were taken eYery fi-ve miles to the one hundred fathom curve; at this point two and a half miles apart, and then five miles apart to the end of the line. The temperature of the surface was taken every mile; to twenty-five fathoms every five miles, and to four hundred fathoms every ten miles. With reference to this line Commander Bartlett remarks that he did not find the warm water or the Gulf Stream current until he had nearly crossed the imaginary Stream as represented on the chart. Ou reachmg the Stream be shaped a course for NaYesink lights, taking soundings and serials as on the previous line. Some additional extracts from Commander Bartlett's report are here given, as presenting his views, derived from facts observed during the cruise. He says very justly, however, after stating that he has endeavored to draw attention t-0 the most important facts, that no definite conclusion can be drawn from data obtained on only two lines crossing the Stream, and that the volume, direction, temperature, etc., is only for a particular date, and under especial conditions of wind and weather. "In regard to the results of the investigation of this last season's work I have been particularly interested in what I was expected to find; that is, the bifurcation of the Stream into warm and cold bands. The warm and cold bands have been accepted for so long a time as a fact a,ml have been reported by such reliable authorities, that there must have been di:flerent conditi;ns of weather during our observations. I have already stated that our observations did not indicate anything of the kind. From the time we entered the Stream on line 0 (the first line run) until leaving it, the wind was fresh from the southwest, and the current and warm water was in a very narrow stream. Sir C. Wyville Thomson says, in his Voyage of the Challenger: 'In crossing the Gulf Stream in both directions the alternate bands or interdigitations of warm and cold water were very perceptible.' In a study of the surface temperatures obtained by the Challenger I do not see

any change in the Stream itself, but there are warm and cold streaks well inside, near the one hundred fathom curve. Our temperatures also indicate these latter. "The U. S. S. Jamestown crossed the Stream in May, 1sg2, and the officers report having observed the cold bands, but they also state that when the cold surface water was observed it was during a perfect deluge of rain. I have often observed that a heav;v fall of rain changed the tern· perature of the surface water several degrees, but the temperature at five and ten fathoms did not show any change. "I have examined eight log-books of our men-o'-war who crossed the Stream in the month of June in -'he same general locality as in line 0. The prevailing wind was southwest, ancl in no case was I able to find anything like a bifurcation. The force of the current, its direction and even temperature, is certainly very much influenced by the wind and weather. The prevailing wind along our coast, as fa1· north as Hatteras, is southwest during the summer months, and this was the season in which our observations were taken. In my report for the season 1881 I gave the change of direction of the general course of the Stream owing to a temporary change of the direction of the wind. "In reference to the temperatures below the surface, the isotherrnals show only cold water on line O, until nearing tbe Stream, when they descend gradually and in the Stream abruptly to their greatest depth. "Instead of the warm Stream water thinning away as it was reported to do when spread out, at the time of our crossing the Stream it was not much over fifty miles in width, as shown by the current and high surface temperatures. "The general temperature at the bottom off Savannah, in the Gulf Stream, the depth being four hundred fathoms, was 450; and at eight hundred fathoms outside and beyond the current, 39i-0 · On line O, the temperature in the Stream, at four lmndred fathoms, was as high as 550, and 400 at eight hundred fathoms. On the southern side of the Stream the temperature, at four hundred fathomB, rose as high as 600, and to 420 at eight hundred fathoms. Just north of the Stream the temperature at four hundred fathoms was 39zo to 400, "The isothermals remained at the same depths from the Stream to the Bermudas, with the exception of a slight rise near the islands. "On the line from the Bermudas to Hatteras the isothermals were at the same depths as on line O, south of the Stream. .As we entered the current ofl Hatteras they were not quite as dee-p, being 4go, 470, and 440 at four hundred fathoms, and 390 at eight hundred fathoms. It \Yould appear that the Labrador current does not pass under the Stream until near Ha,tteras, whe11 it would naturally follow the one thousand fathom curve, and go under the Stream at this point as I suggested in my last report. ''The two lines last run give only the temperatures of the Labrador current. They correspond with those taken on line 0 inside of the Stream, the temperature at four hundred fathoms being 38!0·" Mention is made in the report of the great usefulness of the eleciric lights in sounding at night. These lights were run by a No. 4 Brush dynamo, the motive power being a small upright engine connecting by belt.. Tht' governor of the engine was arranged to give twelve hundred and fifty revolutions to the dynamo per minute. The two lightR, of two thousand candle-power each, were hung from iron cranes lashed in the fore-rigging, and extencling beyond the vessel's side so as to throw the beams of light around tlte sounding wire where it entered the water. "'hen the vessel stopped for a sounding or a serial at night, the dynamo was started and run during the time of stopping only. Soundings and serials were then taken and the records kept on deck with as much ease as in broad daylight. The dynamo was situated about ftfteen feet from the standard compass. .At that distance, when running, it affected the compass about one-half a point, the compass returning to its normal condition when the dynamo was at rest. All of the Mother Carey chickens that were in sight were attracted by the light, and after it had been in operation from twenty minutes to half au hour the water immediately underneath became crowded with squid and small fish. Owing to the lateness of the sea.son when the work began, Commander Bartlett made but two

trials with the Siemens apparatus, and then only to verify the readings of the Miller-Casella deepsea thermometers. Commander Bartlett acknowledges the aid of Lieut. G. W. Mentz, U.S. N., and Ensign H. S. Knapp, U. S. N., in the arduous work of the cruise, and in closing his report expresses the great regret that he feels in retiring from the command of the Blake and duty under the Coast Survey. This regret I fully share, in view of the loss to the Survey of the experience gained by this able officer in deep-sea investigations during his four years' service.

Hydrographic work executed by these officers in the Blake off tl1e coast of Long Island will be referred to later in this section, and the deep-sea soundings between the Bahamas and Bermudas under the heading of Section VI. Hydrogryhy of easlern entrance to Long Island Sound.-Iu pursuance of instructions dated July 19, 1882, directing Lieut. Commancler W. H. Brownson, U. S. N. 1 Assistant Coast and Geo· detic Survey, then in command of the steamer Gedney, to make a hydrographic resurvey of the eastern entrance to Long Island Sound, work had been begun by that officer but a few days before the exigencies of the service made it expedient to transfer him to the steamer Blake, and to assign Lieut. H. B. Mansfield, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, to the charge of the hydrographic party on board the Gedney. Lieutenant-Commander Brownson was relieved by Lieutenant Mansfield August 1. Between this date and November 6, when the work was completed, an area of four hundred and ten square miles was sounded, the limits of the sheet comprising that portion of the eastern entrance to Loug Island Sound which is kuown a>1 Block faland Sound. Tht1 plane of reference for the soundings was established by observations at the tidal station on Block Island.

A report of the hydrographic work executed during the winter season by Lieutenant Mansfield, off the east and west coasts of Florida, will be found under the head of Section VI. Tidal observatwm.-Observations of tides were begun at Block Island on July 27, 1882, with the same self-registering tide-gauge that had been used in 1879, and at the same station on the breakwater at the eastern end of the island. The record was kept up by the observer. Mr. J, M. Couley, throughout tht:l winter, with but little interruption. It is proposed to keep tb;s gauge m operation while the resurvey of' Long Island Sound is in progress, and thus make Block Island the base of the tidal survey of that sound and the waters connecting with it, as it was formerly made the base for the tidal survey of Buzzard's Bay and Narragansett Bay.

Re-e.tablishmenl of points of old triangulation and determination of new points from Wat·h Hill westward for the resurv~ of Long Island Sound.-In order to furnish points for the topographic and hydrographic resurveys of the north shore of Long Island Sound from Watch Hill westward, Assistant S. C. Mccorkle, undn instructions of July 31, 1882, proceeded to that part of the coast, and having after careful search recovered six stations of the former triangulation, began observations for the determination of new points on the 23d of August. High winds and smoky atmosphere retarded !lomewhat the progress of the work, but by the 9th of November, when field operations closed, it had been pushed far enough to furnish the determinations required. For the computation of results, Mr. McCorkle used Watch Hill-Mount Prospect (2)-a base line of the primary triangulation. Statistics of the work are as follows:

Topographical survey of Fisher's Island, Long Island Sound.-The field-work assigned to Assistant Ed win Hergesheimer upon being detached from office duty towards the close of July, 1882, was a topographic survey of Fisher's Island, near the eastern entrance to Long Island Sound. Much of the mouth of August was occupied in erecting signals, determining heights, and in fixing the positions of beacons and spindles for the use of the hydrographic parties at work in the vicinity. As completed on the 9th. of November, the survey included the whole area of Fisher's Island, and the small islands, '\Vicopesset, and the Hammocks to the east and north of it. Mr. A. E. Burton served as aid during part of the season. Statistics are as follows: Length of shore-line, including creeks and ponds, miles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .... 60 Length of roads, miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . · · · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · · · . . ·....·· H: Area in square miles (Fisher's Island) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ...........·. 4.36 Upon returning to the office Assistant Hergesheimer, after inking his topographic sheet, resumed drawing for ihe topographical manual. Towards the close of the fiscal year he was instructed to proceed to Noank, Conn., in anticipation of a resumption of field-work upon the northern shore of Long Island Sound. Hydrographic resurvey of Fisher's Island Sound and New London Harbor.-Lieut. Richardson Clover, U.S. N., Assistant Ooast and Geodetic Survey, having been assigned to the charge of the hydrographic party on board the Coa.st Survey schooner Palinurus, and directed to make a hydrographic resurvey of Fisher's Island Sound and Naw London Harbor, arrived iu New L-Ondon early in July. The Palinurus had been in the service of the Fish Commission of the State of Con· necticut, and while the vessel was being refitted and docked, search was made by Lieutenant Clover for a rock reported off Watch Hill, betweeb the buoys in the channel entrance to Fisher's Island Sound. This rock, which had been struck by the ~teamer Massachusetts, was found and located without delay, and a detailed "Notice to Mariners" respecting it was soon after issued by the office. Soundings were begun in the Thames River, above the navy-yard, on the 1st of August, the lines being run on ranges one hundred meters apart, and continued at this distance until reaching the Sound, when the distance was gradually increased to two hundred and fifty meters; the lines crossing these at right angles were two hundred meters apart. Care was taken to develop all shoals and rocks by special systems of lines. In the course of the survey, which included two hydrographic sheets, extending from Goshen Point east"' ard to Stonington, the southern limit being Fisher's Island, some rocks were found very dangerous to navigation which were before unknown, the most important of which were Vixen Ledge, half a mile southeast of Pine Island, and a cluster of rocks and a ledge, each with less than thirteen feet of water, and directly in the track of vessels using Pine Island Channel. Due publicity was given to the existence of these dangers to navigation by the issue from tile office of a "Notice to Mariners."

The plane of reference for the soundings was obtained by observation with staff-gauges set up at New London, Noank, and Stonington; at New London a self-registering gauge was also established under Lieutenant Clover's direction. Early in December the formation of ice interfered with the progress of the survey and it was brought to a close.

Early in the winter Lieutenant Clover was relieved from the command of the Palinurus and ordered to duty in the office. Towards the close of the fiscal year the survey was resumed in Stonington Harbor under the direction of Lieut. A. V. Wadhams, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, with the aid of Ensigns Thomas D. Griffin and W. C. Canfield, U.S. N.

Topographic resurvey of the north shore of Long Island Sound to the eastwa,rd of the Thames River.-ln pursuance of instructions dated July 29, 1882, Subassistant W. C. Hodgkins began, early in the following month, a topographic resurvey of that part of the north shore of Long Island Sound which may be specially described as the north shore of Fisher's Island Sound east of Bluff Point. With reference to the general aspect of this portion of the coast, Mr. Hodgkins remarks that it is very irregular, being deeply indented by coves and rivers which form a succession of penin· sulas and islands. That the drift formation ii. the prevailing one, though there are occasional outcrops of rock in place, and that the presence of innumerable bowlders is the most characteristic feature of tbe surface, these bowlders being found especially along the shore where the gravel and sand have been washed from under and around them. When lying on shoal ground at a distance from tbe shore they form reefs dangerous to nal'"igation. The salt marshes, though frequently found along the shores of the coves, especially near the mouths of the larger streams, are not extensive enough to be considered a feature of great importance on this part of the coast. At Groton Long Point Mr. Hodgkins observes that the marshes and sand ridges present a formation curiously similar on a small scale to the alternate marshes and ridges of Cameron Parish on the southwestern coast of Louisiana. As the eastern limit of the work is approached, the character of the shore suddenly changes from the rocky shores of Stonington Harbor to the sea-formed sand-spit known as Napatree Point., at the western extremity of which a low hill of drift formation is reached, and turning imddenly to the north the spit continues a mile and a half farther to the extremity known as Sandy Point, the southern point of entrance to Little Narragansett Bay. Old residents state that for many years this point did not change materially, but that more recently there has been a rapid growth to the northward. The gain in this direction has been nearly six hundred merers since the survey of 1839. A prevalence of rain and high winds somewhat retarded the progress of the survey. At the 30th of November, when it closed for the season, the topography included the shore-line from Blnff Point to a point east of Stonington, the harbor and wharf lines of Noank, Mystic, and Stonington, both shores of Napatree Point, and the outer shore eastward to a point a mile east of Watch Hill. The statistics are as follows: Shore-line surveyed, miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iJ5 Ponds and streams, miles. . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 Roa<ls (including railroads), miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . .. . 20 Area of completed topography, square miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2

instructions to prepare for the resumption of topographical work on the shores of Long Island Sound. Topographic resur1'ey of New London and vicinity.-Field-work for the topographic survey in the vicinity of New London was begun by Assistant W. H. Dennis about the middle of August, 1882, the entire shore-line included in the sheet from Thames River entrance to a distance of about two miles and a quarter north of New London being first surveyed for the use of the hydrographic party, after which details of topography were filled in. These included the streets of the city of New London and the town of Groton. Unfavorable weather prevailed during the greater part of the season, there being but thirteen days available for field-work in September and but seventeen in October. By the 9th of December, when the season closed, the statistics presented were as follows: Shore-line surveyed, miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48 Roads, length of, miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33 Area of survey, square miles........... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 During the winter season, Assistant Dennis was engaged on office duty, and under instructions received towards the close of the fiscal year prepared for completing unfinished details of tile New London work and for the prosecution of the survey to the \Vestward. Tidal observations.-Early in October, 1882, a self.registering tide gauge was established at Fort Trumbull, New London, Conn., and, under the direction of Lieut. Richarilson Olo\ er, CT. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, Sergeant E. Kocli, stationed at the fort, was Jllaced iu charge. The record was kept up during the winter by the observer with but few interruptions. It will be important to continue these observations until the completion of the resurvey of Long Island Sound, New London being the principal port to which all others on the sound are referred in the tidal reductions and predictions. Re-establishment of poi1its of former triangulation, and determination of neic points on the south shores of Long Island Sound, in the vicinity of Montauk Point and Gardiner's Bay.-I?or tlie use of the topographic and hydrographic parties engaged in the resurvey of the south shores of Long Island Sound, it became necessary to recover as many points of the former triangulation as practicable, and to determine a number of new points. This dut;y was accomplished by Subassi:stant C. II. Van Orden, who organized his triangulation party at Amagansett, Long Island, early iu August, 1882, and starting from the bases, Gardiner's Island-Montauk light-house, and Gardiner's IslandMontauk (2), carried a series of secondary and tertiary triangles westward to Life-Sadng Station No. 10, and northward to Gardiner's Island light-house, checking his de.terminations of new points as often as possible by the stations of the old triangulation, which he succeeded in re-establishing. Following the general course of the shore, the distance covered is about fifty miles. Work was closed for the season November 25.

Duty subsequently assigned to Subassistant Van Orden will be referred to later in this section, and also under the heading of Section VIII. Topographic and hydrographio resurvey of the eastern part of the south shores of Lfmg Island &und.-.A.ssistant Charles Hosmer, having been directed to take charge of the schooner Drift, organized his party on board of that vessel towards the middle of August, 1882, and began a topo· graphic and hydrograpbic resurvey of the east end of Long Island and of Gardiner's Island. Work in these localities was prosecuted until the 20th of October, when, in consequence of stormy weather, it could be continued to advantage no longer on this part of the Long Island coast, and .Assistant Hosmer transferred bis party to the western part of the Sound. At the date just mentioned the topography and inshore hydrography of the eastern part of Long Island had been completed from Montauk Point light-house to a point about half way between Fort Pond Bay and Napeague Harbor; also the topography of Gardiner't-l Island, and the inshore hyclrography of its eastern face from Gardiner's Island light-house to the southern part of Tobaccolot Bay.

In the execution of the hydrography, Assistant Hosmer acknowledges the valuable assistance rendered by Master John C. Fremont, jr., U.S. N., and by Ensign A. F. Fechteler, U.S. N. Statistics of this portion of the season's work will be included in those given later under the heading of this section with a report of the survey in the western part of the Sound. Hydrographic resurvey of Gardiner's Bay and approaches, south coast of Long Island 8ound.-In the plan for the resurvey of Long Island Sound, the hydrography of Gardiner's Bay and its approaches was assigned to Lieut. Edward M. Hughes, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey. His party was organized on board of the schooner Silliman, and had the use of a steam· launch loaned for the work by the Navy Department. Leaving New York July 24, 1882, Lieuten· ant Hughes anchored at Greenport, Long Island, July 29, and began work two days later. In the course of the resurvey the need of it was not unfrequently shown by the changes which were found to have occurred during the lapse of from thirty-five to forty years. Some extracts from Lieutenant Hughes's report which bear upon this fact will be of interest: "Marked changes in shore-line are frequently noticeable, as in the cases of Gardiner's Island, Ram Island, Long Beach Point, Cedar Point, and vicinity of entrance to Napeague Harbor. Par· ticular attention is called to the great change in depth of water and channels found in that part of Gardiner's Bay lying to the southward of a line drawn from Acabornock Harbor to Ram Island, and to the westward of a line drawn from Ram Island to Goffe's Island. To the group of five menhaden oil-factories situated on the west side of the penimmla between Napeague Harbor and Gardiner's Bay, known as 'the promised land,' nineteen and one-half feet of water may be carried by vessels entering from N apeague Bay. · · · An increase in the number of buoys in this vicinity is desirable." With reference to the character of the anchorages in the locality of the survey, Lieutenant Hughes remarks as follows: ,; Excellent holding ground is to be found off Acabomock Harbor in all weather by anchoring in three and one-half to four fathoms, muddy bottom; anchoring too near the edge of the fiats to the eastward should be avoided, as the anchor is apt to drag, owing to kelp on the bottom and its accumulating around the anchor. "Vessels find excellent shelter from easterly winds in Bostwick Bay and Gardiner's Island bight to the southward, but the holding ground is not good and in strong westerly blows small fishing craft frequently drag up on the beach, on which account the anchorage in Gardiner's Island bight is avoided by fishermen. "In anchoring in Sag Harbor entrance in northerly gales, Cedar Island light-house should by small craft be brought to bear N. i E. (magnetic), where snug shelter may be found; and no vessel should anchor in mid-channel, as in northerly storms no part of Gardiner's Bay is as rough and uncomfortable as that part of the channel lying between Mashomuck Point and Cedar Island on an ebb tide." For obtaining a plane of reference for the soundings, the principal tidal observations were made during the month of August at the tide-gauge established at Greenport, Long Island. Four auxiliary gauges were also established and connected with the principal gauge by special observations. The work on the Gardiner's Bay sheet had been completed, including the surveys of Napeague Bay and Harbor and Three-Mile Harbor, and preparations had been made for beginning the hydrography of Greenport Harbor and Orient Bay, when instructions were received to close operations for the season.

Midshipmen J<'rancis W. Kellogg and A. A. Ackerman, U.S. N., were attached to the party, and rend!.'red service the efficiency of which is acknowledged by their commanding officer. During the winter season Lieutenant Hughes was in command of the steamer Gedney and in charge of bydrographic work on the coast of Texas. This will be referred to under the head of Sectipn IX. Determination of the geographical position of the new observatory of Yale Oollege.-.At the request of Prof. H. A. Newton, of Yale College, the geographical position of the new observatory of the college, in course of erection on 'Winchester Hill, was determined by connecting it with the triangulation of the New Haven region. Acting Assist.ant J. A. Sullivan was charged with this duty, and, in pursuance of it, put up the signals needed, and occupied Rtatiuus East Rock autl West Rock, from which be determined J<'ort Wooster and a station, Winchester Hill, quite near the new observatory. Measurements with steel tape were made from Winchester Hill to the observatory, the proximity of valuable shade-trees not permitting direct observation from the stations occupied. Two small obsenatoi·ies in tile yard of North Sheffield College were also connected with the triangulation. Mr. Sullirnn found that the station at \Yest Rock was in danger of being lost, owing to the etlect of fires made b.Y ,·isitors on the ledge, which cause the surface of the rock to crack: and ·: sllell off," so that the inch copper bolt marking the station was exposed for more than half its length. He iusertcd three half-inch copper reference-bolts at suitable distances in a ledge of solid rock noticeably lower than the one at the station. :Field-work was concluded October 20.

Determination of points for the restirvey of the north ihore of Long Island Sound from the vicinity of Bridgeport, Conn., westward,_:...In accordance with au understanding had with the Shell-l<'ishery Commission of the State of Connecticut, in virtue of which the triangulation of the Connecticut shore of Long Island Sound from Penfield Reef westward to the State boundary was to be carried on so that t.he results would be amilable for the purposes of the Commission in the location of oyster-grounds under their jurisdiction, a8 well as for use iu the hydrograpby of the Sound, Assistant Gershom Bradford, who had during the previous season executed work for the Commis11ion and was in charge of such work at the beginning of the fi!Scal Jear, was directed early in July, 1882, to begin a triangulation near Bridgeport, Conn., and to carry it westward along the shore of the Sound to Captaiu's Island. A sutticieut number of points of the former triangulation near the shore upon which to start from not having been found, Mr. Bradford selected the line Tashua Hill-Bald Hill of the old primary triangulation as a base of operations, and by a careful reconnaissance succeeded in con· neP-ting the statious newly selected along the shore as far westward as Sheffield Island. Additional stations betweeu Sheffieltl lsla!l(l anti Captain's Island were determined from the line Bald Hill-Stamford light-house. Station Rouu<l Hill of the primary triangulation could not be recovered, but a station was 08tablished there which can doubtless be checked in position ultimately from the old primary line Bald Hill-West Hills. The latter part of the season being fa\TOrable, field-work was continued till January 16, by which time such results as were available for the purposes of the Fish Commission had been supplied to it.

Recovery and marking of triangulation points on the north shore of Long Island, between Hempstead Harbor £ind Horton's Point, N. Y.-For the purposes of the resurvey of Long Island Sound, it became desirable to re-establish as many stations of the old triaugulation as practicable on the north shore of Long Island. This dutr, upon that section of the coast between Hempstead Harbor and Horton's Point was assigned to Assistant F. H. Gerdes during the winter of 1882-'83. Mr. Gerdes arrived upon the ground in January, 1883, and though suffering from the infirmities incL dent to his advanced age and from the exposure due to the supervision of work in ground frozen and often CO\'ered with snow, he remained in the field until the middle of March, prosecuting the search at every avai.lable opportunity. A severe attack of illness occuning about this time, com· pelled his recall from field-sen-ice. Topographic and ltydrograpltic resurve,!f of the western part of Long Island Sound, in the vicinity of Throg's Neck.-The work of the party uuder the direction of .Assistant Charles Hosmer, commanding the schooner Drift, in the eastern part of Long Island Sound, l1as already been referred to in this sectio11, and meution made of the transfer of the party to the western part of the Sound towards the close of October. On the 1st of November Mr. Hol:lmer began a resurvey of the hydrography between Hart faland and City falaml, and continued it till December 5, when extreme cold weather compelled a suspension of field operations. Duri11g the winter, the Drift was laid up at the navy-yard, BI'ooklyn, in charge of Mast~r J. C. Fremout. jr., U. S. N., aud .Assistant Hosmer was occupied in office-work. Barly in .May, 1883, the work was resumed by Assistant Hosmer, in the Drift, with the aid of Ensigns H. U. \Yakeushaw and R. P. Schwerin, U. S. N. By the 27th of June, the shore-Ji.ne survey from ·wmets I>oint to Prospect Point on the Long Island shore, and from Throg's Neck to a point near Whortleberry Island, on the north shore, including the islands in the vicinity, had been com plete<l; also the hydrogra11lty between Sand Point, Executiou Rock, and Whortleberry Island on the east, to Throg's N eek on the west. Preparations were then made b,y Mr. Hosmer for the resumption of the resurvey in the vicinity of Greeuport.

violent storm on the 12th of September, the wharf upon which the tide-house stood was broken down, carrying the tidc-hou::ie, title-gauge, and the record for a number of days with it. After the storm subsided, the tide-house and gauge were reco,·ered, repaired, and established upon a wharf which fiince then has 1Jee11 rebllilt aud strengthened with new piles, so that there is now a fair prospect of a continuous record for some years to come. The loss of the record while the gauge was being put into working order again was partly remedied by staff ohseiTatioas. J)eterminations of the force of gravity at Montreal, Canada, Albany, N. Y., and Ilobolcen, N. J.-Determinatious of the force of gra,·ity, both absolute and relative, were continued by .Assistant Charles S. Peirce daring the fiscal ~-ear. At the station ::;tevens lustitute, Hoboken, a regular determination of the absolute for~e of gravity was made with the Hepsohl apparatus. Two new i1n-ariable reYersible pe11dulums were oscillated; the same that were used at the stations in Washington. Thest\ pendnlnrns wert' then trausportcd to Montreal. Canada, and micillated at the station selected with the permission of the authorities of McGill Oollege iu the basement of the College Observator~·. Thence in September they were taken to Alban~·. where they wem oscillated in the trausit room of the Dudley Obserrntory. In these experirneuts Mr. Peirce had the aid of .'.\Iessrs E. D. Prestou and F . .B. Hall. In Felwuar.r, 1883, the Stevens lllstitute Station, Hoboken, was re.occupied in order to continue the work of comparing the yard and the meter by means of reversible pendulums numbered ~ and 3, the latter being the yard pemlulnm. Other determinations of gravity made br i\lr. Peirce will be referred to under the heads of Sections III and VI. In Appendix No. 19 is given a paper by Mr. Peirce which was intended for pul>lication as one of the Appendices to my Report for last year, but was omit.ted for want of space. It relates to results for force of gravity obtained by him at Alleg·bcny, Ebensburg, and York, Pa. Hydrograpky o:ff south coast of Long Island, and lines of deep-sea soundings in th13 vicinif.IJ of New York Bay entmnce.-Upon the completion of the line of deep-sea soundings off Nantucket, reference to which has been made under the heading of Section I, Lieutenant-Commander Brownson was instructed to run a series of lines of soundings normal to the coast off the south shore of Long Island, at distances apart of from seven to ten miles, and far enough out to include the onehundred-fathom curve. This duty was successfully accomplished in the steamer Blake between September 6 and October 11, 188:.!. At the date last named, when further work was prernnted by bad weather, sixteen lines of soundings had been run. The Blake was then ordered to New York, where her commander prepared her for deep-sea soumling work between the Balrnmai,; and the Bermudas. This will be referred to under the heading of Section VI. · The following-named officers attached to the Blake ser\'ed in hydrographic Jut~· during the season off the Long Island coast: Lieut. G. vV. Mentz, U.S. N.; Masters Henry .'.\lorrell and Lucian Flynne, U.S. N.; Ensigns H. C. Wakenshaw, W. M. Com1tant, and Harry S. Knapp, U.S. N. Upon the completion of her southern work in the spring of 1883, the Blake returned to New York and, under instructions issued April 16, took up deep-sea sounding work in the approaches to New York Harbor. .

Verification of hydrography for the Atlantic Ooast Pilot.-For the purpose of expediting the publication of the third volume of the Atlantic Coast Pilot, embracing the coast between New York and Chesapeake Bay, Assistant J. S. Bradford was directed, in July, 1882, to organize a party and proceed to verify by actual inspection the flailing directions of so much of the work as had already been published, and.the manuscript of those portions which were nearly ready for the printer. The schooner George l\I. Bache was assigned as a means of transportation for the party. Owing to unexpected delays in the repairs and outfit of the vessel, Assistant Bradford was unable to start upon his inspection duty till near the close of August. Proceeding then from Alexandria. to Lower Cedar Point on the Potomac, a day was spent in examining the new beacons which had superseded the old spindles and buoys in that dcini.ty, and in veri:(ving the depths a-0ross the "Kettle-bottoms." The Lower Machodoc River was next examined, and ha dug subsequently put. into Norfolk for water, the Bache was detained there by ad,erse winds till September 8, when she passed out of the Chesapeake and headed for Delaware Bay. T.ight winds and calms prevailed, and delayed the Yessel till the 10th instant, when a hea,-y northeast gale came up; the sea rose with great rapidity, and about an hour before sunset the fore-toimrnst was carried away. The topmast and main-topmast were iu imminent danger of sliarrng tlie same fate, but by extraordinary efforts were finally secured. At seven o'clock p. m. the wind suddenly shifted to east-southeast, blowing with great Yiolence, and setting the ship directly towards the beach. No alternative remained except to crowd on all sail at the risk of foundering and try to get off sbore. At this time the water was up to the tops of the lower berths on the berth-deck, and there was eighteen inches of water on the cabin and wardroom decks, the sea washing completely over the vessel, so that officers and men were most of the time up to their waists in water. For a while it seemed that nothing could pl'(went the bea-0hing of the vessel, but gradually she began to claw off; the wind canted a couple of points to the southward, and finally Cape Henlopen was made, aud ou the afternoon of the 11th the Bache was anchored in the Breakwater. While at anchor here a second gale sprang up from NW. by N., against which the Breakwater offered no protection. In this gale the best boat of the ship, while secured at the daYits, was broken in two and dashed on shore, a mass of splintered timbers; all of the ship's provisions were ruined, and the delays thus occasioned for refitting and repair, together with the illness of l\lr. Bradford, resulting from exposure, preventecl the beginning of the hydrographic examinations contemplated in Delaware Bay till early in October. These examinations included Salem Creek, "Joe Flogger" Shoal, and the banks and channels between \Vilmington and Philadelphia, with such notes of chauges and additions of aids to navigation as were required to complete Subdivision 15 (Delaware Bay and tributaries) of the Atlantic Coast Pilot. Similar work was done in Chesapeake Bay after the arrrival of the Bache in Hampton Roads on the ~d of NoYember. Data and material were collected for the revision of sailing directions and descriptions for the coast between Cape Henlopen and Cape Henry, and for the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, these localities being included in Subdivisions 16 and l'i of the Atlantic Coast Pilot. In February, 1883, field-work was closed, the Bache turned over to the care of a shipkeeper, and A!\sistant Bradford, proceeding to the office, took immediate charge of the work of preparing for publication the manuscripts of Subdivisions 16 and 17 of the Coast Pilot. As organized for office duty, his party at the beginning of the fiscal year consisted of Mr. John W. Parsons, writer to the Coast Pilot, aud Mr. John R. Barker, draughtsman and artist. Until the date of his detachment from the Coast Pilot division and transfer to the office of the disbursing agent, l\larch 1i, 1883, Mr. Parsons was engaged in completing the preparation for publication of the reprints of Subdivisions Nos. 2, 4, 5, and G of the Atlantic Local Coast Pilot; in a revision and rearrangement of a part of the -"Table of Depths'' for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States, and iu making an index to Subdivision 15, Atlantic LOcal Coast Pilot. The manuscript of this subdivision was completed for the printer by Assistant Bradford towards the close of January, 1883. The Table of Depths is published as Appendix No. 7 to this Report. Mr. John R. Barker remained as usual in charge of the etching and engraving of the ooast and harbor views for the Atlantic coast. During most of the year he wa.s employed on the views for Division D of the Atlantic Coast Pilot, but he rendered valuable service in retouching those

belonging to Division B (Boston to New York), and in re-engraving some views belonging to Division A (E~stport to Bost-011). These views were originally printed Ly what is termed the "graphic process." Assistant Bradford, after the completion of Subdivision 15 of the Coast Pilot, gave bis personal attention to the preparation of the Table of Depths for the printer, to proof-reading for the Coast Pilot, and to the compilation of a report upon Discrepancies in Nomenclature between the Coast Survey Charts and the publications of the Light-House Board for the Pacific coast. On the 26th of May Mr. W. 0. Jones was assigned to duty with Mr. Bradford, and served satisfactorily till June 30, when be was ordered to field duty. The Table of Depths was finally completed on the 20th of June; the maunscript of Di,·isiou C of the Atlantic Coast Pilot (New York to the Chesapeake) as far as and including Delaware Bay and River, has been printed, but only that portion relating to the Kew ,Jersey coast between New York and Delaware Entrance has been published; it is expected, howewr, that the manuscript descriptive of the coast between Cape Henlopen and Cape Henry will shortly be ready for the printer and that the publication of Subdivision 15, Delaware Bay and Tributaries, will not be longer delayed.

Leveling operations for connecting the Coast Survey reference mark at Albany, N. Y., with the primary trjangulatfon station on Mount Man~field, Vt.-In order to connect the levels of the northern line of Coast Survey triangulation with the tide lenl at Sandy Hook by way of the Hudson Hiver
and Lake Champlain, Assistant 0. H. Tittmann was instructeu, towards the clm;e of .August, 1882, to proceed to Albany, N. Y., and organize a party for runniug a Jiue of levels from the bench-mark at that place to Burlington, Vt., and thence to the primary triangulation st<ition on l\Iount Mansfield, Vt. He was also directed to obtain for purposes of comparison the canal level:,; between the Erie Canal and Lake Champlain. In pursuance of this duty Assistant Tittmann carried a line of levels from the Alban~- benchmark to *hitehall, at the southern extremity of Lake Champlain, and thence aloug the west shore of the Lake on the track of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company'" railroad as far as Putnam station, about thirteen miles north of Whitehall. In accordance witll the general tenor of his instructions, which contemplated the determination of the relative elevations of selected points along the Jake by its surface water level, Putnam station was adopted as tile provisional terminus of the spirit-leveling, and gauges were established at. this station and at Port Henry, Plattsburg, Rouse's Point, and Burlington. Observations ou the stage of water were kept up at these gaug~s from November 4 to November 18. During this time the work of levelmg down Mount Mansfield was begun, anu continueu until it was interrupted b;r the severity of the weather. A permanent bench-mark was established on the west side of the mountain on the Underhill trail about four hundred metres below the summit. At the different points along the lake above mentioned, bench-marks were established and connected with the hydrographic reference-marks which had been fixed during the survey of the lake in 1873 and 1874; connection was also made at Fort Montgomery with that point on the water-sill of the fort which was used as a reference point for the observations conducted for a period of twelve years under the direction of the Corps of Engineers. Messrs. J. W. D. Atkins and W. 0. Jones served in the party as rodmen. Field operations were closed November 20. After depositing in the office the records and computations relating to the leveling work, Assistant Tittmann was assigned to duty, a report of which will be given under the headiug of Section VI. .

P;oimary triangulation across the State of New York for conneeting the triangulation of tlie Hudson River and Lake Champlain with tltat of the si,rvey of the Great Lakes.-The scheme proposed by Assistant C. 0. Boutelle for the continuation of the triangulation across the northern part of the State of New York having been approved, he was authorized to take the field at the beginning of the fiscal year. Five directions, at four stations, remained to be observed upon Hamilton Station; t.o obtain the three directions from Prospect and Helderberg Hr. Boute1le occupied these stations between the 6th of Jilly and the 13th of August. At Prospect the work was greatly delayed by smoke.

:30

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

At Prospect station the magnetic elements were determined by observations made during three tla,,rs by Subass1sta11t J. B. Baylor; similar determinations were also made by him at Otsego station in Oberry Valley. Station Pen Mount was occupied by Mr. J.B. Boutelle with the twentyinch theodolite to obtain the direct.ions needed to Mount Hamilton, and later in August Mr. Baylor occupied Tassel Hill for a similar purpose. Before the occupation by the chief of the party of Prospect and Helderherg a reconnaissance was made by Mr.·J. B. Boutelle under his direction, to determine the most available point intermediate between Fenner and Clyde, the latter point being one of the stations of the Lake Survey. The station finally selected was Howlett, near Syracuse, which makes a very good connection with the Lake Survey stations. With the selection of station Loomis, to the nortl1ward of the State survey station Gilbert, the scheme wasc ompleted. During September, station Fenner was occupied, and during October, station 'Florence, these two stations forming a quadrilateral with Loomis and Howlett. Earl,v in No,·ember field operations for the season were closed. On the 4th of September, Assistant Boutelle was appointed a member of the Advisory Boa.rd of Harbor Commissioners of Norfolk and Portsmouth, in place of A.ssistaut Henry Mitchell, who had desired to be relieved from that service. Duty in this connection, and in the preparation of the record8 and results of his season's work, occupied him during the winter and early spring. In May and ,June, 1883, the connection of the Coast Survey witlt the Lake Survey triangulation was pressed forwards to a conclusion b.r the occupation of Loomis station. Observations here were completed early in July, and preparations made for the occupation of Howlett. Fro~ Loomis the Lake Survey station Manns·dlle was found to be visible, thus giving a direct conuection with tbe Sandy Creek base of that Survey. Preliminary computations from the observations obtained at Loomis indicate a close and satisfactory agreement of results at the junction of the two systems of triangulation; an agreement which is the more satisfactory since each system is an absolut~ly independent work, starting from bases widely separated on the Atlantic cmtst and on the Great Lakes, and carried ou by independent methods, instruments, and obsen'ers. Oont'in.uation of the triangulation of the northern part of the State of Neu: Jersey.-Three stations \rere occupied by Prof. E. A. Bowser, Acting Assistant, during the summer and autumn of 18827 under inl'ltructions to push forward to completion, aR far as practicable, the geodetfo survey of the 11orthern part of the State of New Jerse;\·· ObserYationR were begun at Harnlnug station, near the town of that name in Sussex County, on the 1st of ,July, the instrument being mounted upon a tripod thirty-two feet high, in order t;o see the station at Bear Fort. Signals were erected at stations }fount Olive, Culver's Gap, High Point, l{ear Fort, a11d Bald Rill, and on July 7 a heliotrope was set up at Muunt Olirn. Every advantage being take11 of farnrable weather, the observations at Hamburg station were finished August 14, awl the parts was then transferred to Bear Port, on the ridge so uamed, m~ar the town of West ,;\'lilford, Passaic County. Access to tllb~ station was extremely difficult, a road two miles loug ha,·ing to bP. cut o\·er very rough conglomemte roeks from the main road to the station. Over this road the inst,rnments, tents, aml baggage had to be carried by hand to the summit of the ridge. Preparations for observing had all been made wheu, on the 19th of August, the woods on the mountain werf' discovered to he on fire, and it was only after two days of the most strenuous effort t.hat the fire was ke11t hack from the ca111p. Some delay was thus occasioned in the work; observatiom; were nevertheless completed on the 4th of September, and within a few days later the party was establii;hed at Bald Hill station, about seven miles to the northeast of Boonton, Morris County. Upon tlie completion of the observations at this station, Oct-0ber 31, field operations were closed.

Additions of topographical details t-0 original sheets of the survqf of the New Jer.~ey coast between the Highlands of Navesink and Tom'.~ River.-Examinations of the New Jersey coast between Tom's River and the Highlands of N"aNesink were made by Assistant 0. M. Bache during the latter part of the summer and in the autumn of 1882, for the purpose of ascertaining the extent and character of the cl1anges, natural and artificial, that had taken place along tliat port.ion of the coast since the earlier surveys, and of reporting upon the best method of obtaining stuveys of the changes, by means of which, in connection with the existing original maps, the represe11tations of the coast could be brought up to the present time. The most rapid and effective method of completing the triangulation, topography, and hydrography of the area of that coa~t yet remaining to be surveyed was also investigated hy .Mr. Bache. This area is contained between a point about four miles south of Atlantic City and a point about two miles north of Hereford Inlet. The recommendations made in his report have been duly considered; and as a preliminary step to the adoption of a portion of them, the construction of a barge to serve as a floating camp was ordered, the barge Bi>auty, which had been in use several years for this purpose, having been condemned and sold. In November Mr. Bache marked upon the origiual topographical sheets the new railroads constructed upon the coast in the vicinity of Tom's River, aud surveyed the settlement Island Heii.d1ts on that river; other details of topography of recent origin wei-e added to the slwet as far north a8 Point Pleasant. The changes between Tom's River and the Highlands of Navesink were found to be limited to a narrow strip of land immedfately on the co:lst. This is being rapidly built up to supply the demand for summer resorts. But few changes were found in the high-water line of the beach, except in the immediate neighborhood of the inlets, and in the strip of beach opposite the Highlands. Field operations were closed November 15. Duty subsequently assigned to Assistant Bache in the vicinity of Norfolk, Va., will be referred to under the heading of Section III. Triangulation of Delau:are Ba,y and .River.-Assistant, A. T. Mosman, having been charged with the duty of continuing the triangulation of the Delaware Bay and River in aid of the topographic and hydrographic surve~·s in progress there at the beginning of the fiscal year, established himself and party, by invitation of Assistant H. L. l\farindin, on board the schooner Ready, lying in Smyrna Creek, and taking as a base, the line Oohansey light-house-Bombay light-house, extended the triangulation up the bay to connect with the work of A~sistant l\foCorkle at the line NornyStoney, about two miles below Reedy Island light-house. It was extended also down the bay to the line Cross Ledge light-house-Mahon light-house; dlCltermining all of the signals erected by the hydrographic parties of Assistant MariQdin and of Lieut. H. B. l\Iansfield, U. S. N., As8istant, Coast and Geodetic Survey. As the work advanced down the bay, the party was transferred to Lewes, Del.; Cross Ledge light-house, and Brandywine Shoal light-house, screw-pile structures on shoals in the middle of the bay were occupied, and also the shore light-houses at Mispillion Creek and Cape Henlopen. By Angwst 24 all of the stations required for the topographic aud hydrographic parties 011 the river and bay had been determined, including a number of new points near Cape May an<l Lewes. and some points on ltehoboth Beach. All of the principal stations were securely marked. The statistics are:

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

Philadelphia and Boston, Mr. Mitchell bas not unfrequently been called away from the regular work of the Coast and Geodetic Sttr\'ey, but has dernted much time to the study of the estuary of the Delaware. Hi8 conclusions, as deduced from the results of the recent 1mney1S, are 8tated in A11pendix No. 8. In the harbor of Philadelphia, the location of port-warden lines ii< a problem eomplicated by the attificial chan~es on the cit~' front; in the study of this su hject so that the lines may be ll)cated in a way to balance as nearl.'' as pos.~ible conflicting intnestR, the United States Advi&ory Commission fouud it uecesllary ·to avail itself of the experieuce and personal knowledge of the river acquired during the conduct of the physical survey by Assistant H. L . .Marindiu, who had been on duty with the party of Assistant Mitche11 for seyeral seasons. Applicatiou ha Ying been made to me by the Commission for his detail as consulting engineer, the request was promptlJ- colllplied with. '\Vith reference to the elaborate comparison of the recent survey of the river and hay with that made hy tbe Coast Sun·ey forty ;years ago, Mr. Marindin finds that these forts· years disco>er no fundamental changes lmt a complicated shifting of the shoals, and that while the mean depth for an~· girnu space greater than a square mile is rarely changed, the co11tours are all found out of regiMn when one chart is placed over another, and iu many cases the change in the course of the cha11nel shows how >ery essential the resurvey had become in the interests of 11avigatio11. In the office-work of his party Mr. Mitchell had the aid of Assi8tants Mariudin and Granger during- the intervals between tl1eir field-work. .Mr. J. A. Sullivan, for many 'years an Assistant in the Coast awl Geodetic Survey, was employed continuously in the party, except during a short detail for field-work, and almost exclusively upon the critical studies of sections, &c., referred to above. Ifydrograpltic resurvey of Delaware Bay and River.-The arrangement referred to in my last annual rPport, by which the hydrographic resurvey of Delaware Bay aud Rh·er was carried on by Assistant II. L. Marindiu, working in connection with a naval officer in charge of a separate party, remained in force during the season beginning with May, 1882. At th{I opening of the fiscal year Mr. Marindin, with his party on the schooner Ready, was actively engaged in the hydrography of that portion of the r·iver between Collins' Beach, on the Delaware shore, and the mouth of Stow Creek, on the New .Jersey shore. Bench-marks for tidal reforence were established at Bombay Hook light-house, close to tile tide-gauge at the mouth of Duck Creek, and all of the soundings on the hydrographic sheet were referred to the plane of mean low water as brought down from the gauge at Collius' Beach. About the 18th of July, tlle first·named sheet having been completed, work wa8 begun upon a sheet with limits on the Delaware shore from Bombay Hook Point to l\Iahon's River light, and on the .New Jersey shore from the mouth of Uohansey Creek to near Dyer's Cove. Tidal observations for plane of reference between Duck Oreek and Leipsic Creek, where a tide-gauge had been established, were made, and later in the season a gauge waR put up at Sea-Breeze \Vharf, on the New Jersey side of the bay, and referred to Duck Creek to obtaill the same plane of reference for the east side of the bay. This hydrog-raphic sheet was completed October 11; and an nu finished hydrographic sheet haviug been transferred to Mr. Marindin by Lieutenant Osterhaus, U. S. N., commanding the steamer Endeavor, some progress was made with it, but the weather being now very unfavorable for further operations, the work was suspended for the winter. The statistics are as follows: 6 .Number of tide-gauges established . - ........ - . -.. - . - - - . . . . . .. - .. _ · . . . . 690 Miles run in sounding . . . . . . .. - . - ... - · . . .·.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · · . . . . . · . · .

Ensign E. M. Katz, U.S. N., was a member of the party during the whole of the season. Midshipmen John A. DoughP1ty and L. S. Van Dnz1:1r, U.S. N., were attached to it, the latter from August 22 and the former from the first part of October. Mr. Ma.rindin's report

makes acknowledgment of his appreciation of the efficient co-operation of these officers in both field and office work. Hydrographic resuri·ey of Delaware Bay and Rit,er.-At the beginning of the fiscal ,vear Lieut. H. B. Mansfield, U.S. N., Assistant, Uo:u;t Sur>ey, commanding the steamer Eudeavor, was in charge t1f one of the hydrographic parties er1gag1·d in the resun·e.r of Delaware Bay and River. On the 1st of August, 1882, he was relieved by Lieut. Hugo Osterbaus, U. S. N., Assistant, Coast Survey, who continued the work until the suspension of operations in NoYemher. The work upon one hydrographic sheet had been completed; the next one undertaken included that portion of the bay between Arnold's Point and Sea-Breeze \\'barf; a third sheet, extending frt·tn Deep-Water Point to Egg Ishrnd, was then taken up and partly finished, but laid aside to execute the hydrog. raphy at Delaware Entrance, in the vicinity of Cape l\Ias. This was finished on the 13th of November, when the working season closed. In the course of the survey, as opportunit.v offered, examinatiou was made of dredged channels and ledges in Delaware Ri,·er. These examinations included Schooner Ledge, a dredged channel through Cherry hlland FlatR, and a dredged channel near New Castle, Del.

About the close of November, the Endea,·or, Lieutena11t O.stt·rhaus commanding, was taken to Norfolk, Va., to be prepared for work off the Routhem coast, which will be referred to under the head of Section V. Soon after the arrival of the steamer in Norfolk, I..ieutenant Osterhaus was relieved in command by Lieut. ,John T. Sullivan. Re.~urvey of topography in the vicini'.ty of Cape Henfopen, Del.-That portion of the resurYey of the shores of Delaware Bay in the Yicinity of Cape Henlopen waH committed to Subas8isLant V{. I. Vinal, by instructions dat<>d August 23, 1882. Mr. Viual remarks in his J·eport tl1at the most noticeable changes in the topograpliy in the vicinity of the cape are: (1) The closing of the entrance to Slaughter Creek; (2) the extension northward of the peninsula separating Lewes Creek from the ocean; (3) the change in position southward of the high saml-bills west of Cape Henlopen light-homie; (4) the establishment of a summer resort at Iteho· both Beach, about seven miles below Lewes; (5) the interruption of the continuity of Lewes Creek in several places by drifting sands, and the connection of the separated parts by canals and ditches. At high tides, when the wind is easterly, the marshes in this dcinity are completely submerged; this is the case also with the large sandy area just south of Cape Henlopen. The resurvey was completed November 30. It included on one sheet, scale 1-20000, the topography for about three miles inland from Slaughter Creek (now closed) on the shore of the bay to the Beacon, and thence on the ocean shore to Thompson's Pond or Silver Lake, just south of Rehoboth.

During the winter Mr. Vinal was engaged on office duty, and toward the close of the fiscal year was ordered to topographical duty on the coast of Maine. Continuation of the hyrlrographfr reMtrrey of Lower I>ela,ware Bay.-In pursuance of instructious issued towardR the close of April. 1883, J,ieut. G. C. Hanus, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Surve~-, assumed command of the steamer Arago, and Jiaving prepared her for service, proceeded in her to lower Delaware Ray to complete the hydrography of that localit;r. The work was in active prosecution during the JaRt month of the fo::cal year. Up to June 30, 1883, the statistics are as follows: Miles run in sounding . . ........................ __ ........ __ ... _. _.... _ 301 Angles measured .... _. __ ............................. _... _. _.... ________ 2, 938 Number of soundings ..... _.......... __ _ __ .... _..... __ . __ . _ ........ 12, 732 The following-named officers were attached to the party: Master W. G. Cutler, lT. S. N.; Ensigns E. F. Leiper and G. R. French, U.S. N. Lieutenant Hanus has applied to the setting of hydrographic signals a method:freqnently adopted in sinking piles in sand or mud covered by water. The pole intended to he put down as a signal_has ;fastened to it a gas-pipe nozzle. This pipe should be long:enough to reach: the surface of the water when the signal_is. down. It is attached to the spar or signal by split rope-yarns, and steadied in line by nailH driven~on _either side. 'Vhen the end of the signal rests on the bottom, water is driven through the pipe by means Of a force-pump; a hole is thus excavated in the sand into which tlie end of the signal sinks, and when the needed depth is reached, the force-pump being withdrawn, the sand packs round the lower part of the signal. To this part flanges or projecting.pieces are nsuallr secured before the spar is put down so:as_to obtain a stronger hold. In.: deep water a pine spar needs guys on its head tu stl'ad;r it in an upright positiou, and the weiglit of a man or two hanging on to sink it. Oak or other heavy woods will go down by their own weight or a very little additional force at the rate of about one foot per minute in ordinary sand. \\"hen the pole is well embedded in the sand the gas pipe can be withdrawn. Signals of thiis description can be placed in any depth of water up to about fifteen feet. 'fhe bottom must be sandy or muddy, and the greater the depth the smoother must be the sea while the pole is being put in position. Top(Jgraphic t·esuri,ey of the New Jersey 8hore of Dela1ca,re Bay continued.-At the beginning of the fiscal year Assistant H. 1\f. Bache was in the field with bis party, engaged in carrying the topographic resurvey of the New Jersey shore of Delawa,re River and Bay from Pennsville Routh ward . l · ¥1h)fr. Bache remarks in hi:; report that the symmetrical delineation of the shores, if regarded as forming a contiuuous niap, required the topography to be carried well inland over the convex sweep of the shor(~ at Fiun's Poiut, and that with this exception a very:small margin of topographical delineation was taken, that below Elsingborough Point .being simply designed to show clearly where the diked-in arable lands suddenly cease and wild marsh begins, and below that to oorrect, as it does in some places, the imperfect representation on the old chart of the mouths and lower reaches of some well-known creeks. By the lF;t of December, 1882, the survey had been carriedLfrom Pennsville to Round Island, below Fishing Creek, called Stony Inlet in the earlier.survey. Field work was then: closed for the

Continuation of the topographic rei;urvey of tlw we.~t .~liore of the Delau:are Hit·er and Bay from New Castle south1card.-Upon the west shore of the Delaware Ri\~er the topographic resuney wa~ resumed at New Castle, Del., by Assistant U. T. Iardella, in Jnlle, 188~. From Sew Castle to Reybold station, near the cove of that name, there i1:1 but little rising ground, and twenty-feet curves sufticed for its delineation. From l~eyhold station to .Bowl>ay Hook light, where the work termi uated for tbe season, tbe countQ· is entirely fiat and the greater portiou of it is marsh corered with water at half.tide. Some of the distiuguishiug features of the creeks surveyed iu the progress of the work are thns reported by Mr. Iardella; "8aint George';; Creek.-Thi;; creek is entirely closed at its entrance b~' tlootl-gates and banks. 'l'here are innumerable ditches to drain the water frow the meadows into the creek. "Augustine Crei-~k is rnry narrow at its eutrance; ,·essels can11ot enter ou account of the bridge alwnt half a mile Jong built on piles driven into the marsh. I found it difficult to get my boat to the bridge, the entrance being nearly bare at low water, but after passing the bridge about 011e l111utlred feet nearly fourteen feet of water can be had at high tide for some ten miles. "Appoquinirnink Creek is one hundred and forty meters wide at its entrance, and is 11a \'igable to Odessa, a steamer making three trips a week from that place to Philadelphia. Six feet of water can be carried from the entrance of the creek to the main channel in Delaware l{iyer. ".Blackbird Creek, at its entrance, is one hundred aud forty meters wide, an<I is nayigalJle for n·ssels drawing six feet for uearly ten miles. "Duck Creek is one hundred and fifty meters wide at its entrance, and has au average width of sevent~r-five meters to Smyrna. Vessels drawing se\-eu feet can readily pass over the outer bar at high tide; from the entrance good water can be carried to Smyrna." .Mr. Iardella states that Pea Patch Island is increasing in size owing to the large quantities of mud that are dumped on the western shore from the wharves aud entrances of the locks of the I >elaware and Chesapeake Canal. A flat extends from the island to the westem channel, a distance of three hundred and eighty meters. Bold water can be fouJHl on the eastern side along the shore for the whole length of the island.

Reconnaissance and extension westward of the triangulation of the State of Pennsylvania.-The
continuation to the westward of the triangulation of the State of Pem1sylvania was committed to Professor Mansfield Merriman, Acting Assistant. He took the .field Jul~· 1, 1882, starting from the line Gov. Dick-\Vhite Horse. The fi,·st station occupied was Gov. Dick, a point about six miles south of Lebanon, Lebanon County. \Vork here was finished August 5, and the party moved to station \Vhite Horse, at which a tower thirty-five feet high had been erected for the support of the instrument. The ohser>ations at ·white Horse were completed August 31. l\Iea:;mrements of a. single angle being necessary at stations Blackspot, near Reading, and Smith's Gap, about fifteen north of Allentowu, t11ese two stations were occupied between September 1 and 21. During the Mmainder of the season, which closed. October 11, four statio11s were visited to examine their marking; at three of these no station marks had been established, the general locality onl,y having been tletermined by previous reconnaissance. Professor Merriman hall their 1iositions located and carefully marked. He reports that for the due development of the triangulation northward a special reconnaissance ii; desirable. Statistics of the work are at> follows: Positions of stations determined (primary) ............. _... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 44 SecondaQ· stations (spires, steeples, &c.) determined ... _.. _. _............. _ Number of measurements of angles .......... - ...................... _...... 1, ()13 The records of the work have beeu transmitted to the office.

Determination of boundary line between Pennsylvania and West Yirginia.-In compliance with
a requei;t from tlJe Joint Commissiou of the States of Penus:/lrnnia and \-Yest Virginia for the detail of officns of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to execute the work of traciug out the boundary line between Pennsylvania and the" Pan Handle" of West Virginia, Subassistant C. H. Sinclair was directed in April, 1883, to proceed with Qol. James Worrall, the chairman of the Oommis8ion, to Pittsburgh, and to attend the meeting held there of the Joint Commissioners, in order to be fully informed of their views, aud to give such information m regard to the mode of traeiug and marking the boundary line, and the degree of accuracy which I deemed useful and practicable, as might be called for by the conftrt·nce. Instructions subsequently issued directed Mr. Sinclair to run tl1e meridian line required, taking offsets to such of the old monuments as might be fountl. Suba8sistaut 0. Il. Van Orden was assigned to duty with the party in order to execute the topograph.Y in the immediate vicinity of the monuments.

Determinatiom of gravity by ptl'llduluni experiments at Baltimore and Washingtvn.-In continua· tion of the work of the gravitation party previously antlwrizecl, .Assistant Charles S. Peiroo was directed at the beginning of the fiscal year to niake comparative observations of gravity between Baltimore and Washington. This duty occupied the greater part of the month of July. Instructions then issued t-0 Mr. Peirce involved gravity determinations at stations already mentioned under tLe heading of Section II. Upon his return to Washington in October, the work of measuring the J>endulums used during the summer was continued and completed; the observations for the fiexuro of the Baltimore piers were finished, and the installation of a pendulum station at the Smithsonian Institution was begun. A stone structure having been erected for the pendulum support, two new invariable reversible pendulums were swung here and also at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office. As already mentioned under the heading of Section II, the same pendulums were oscillated at the statiOD8 in Montreal, .Albany, and Hoboken. In this work Messrs. E. D. Preston, Carlisle Terry, jr., and Robert .A. Marr, aids in the Survey, assisted Mr. Peirce. He gave instruction and genera.I supervision to the parties of Messrs. Smith,

Prest-0n, and Marr, referred to in Part I of this Report under the heading "Determinations of Gravity." Mr. Peirce devoted such time as could be spared from tield operations to office. work. He read proof for paper:s relating to gravity determiuatious; prepared for publication a report on the pendulum work at three stations, Allegheny, Ebenslmrg·, and York, in Penn:-;ylYania; prepared a mem01r on the spectrum meter; edited tlle report of tlle pendulum conference, and prepared a memoir on the effect of the flexure of pendulums themsekes. In pursuance of instructions dated April 23, 1883, Mr. Peirce left for Europe in May iu order to make for the Coast and Geodetic Survey certain observations necessary for completi11g tl1e connection of the American and English pendulum work and to obtain some additional pendulum apparatus of special construction. He is still abroad upou this dut~- at the date of dosing this report. . Observations of tlte Transit <if Venus at Washington, /J. C.-'l'he Trausit of Yenm; of 1882, December 6, was observed at Washington by Assistants Cllarles A. Schott and B. A. Uolonna. The place of observation, selected by Mr. Schott, was Fauth's observatory, at the southeast corner of :First street west and B street south.

Through the kindness of Mr. Fauth, Assistant Schott llad the USP of a new Pqnatorial of his construction. It is driven by clock· work, and has an aperture of 15.25 centimeters (G inche:-;) and a focal length of 2.5 meters (8.2 feet). For the morniug ohsern1tio11 it <,ms used with a magnif~·ing power of 102, and for t' e afternoon observations with a power of 127. Full aperture was used in connection with a solar eye-piece, the prism of wliich deflected so much of the sun's hent and ligLt that a light shade-glass sufficed for the protection of the eye. Dr. J. G. Porter, of the Uornpntmg DiYisiou, recorded time for .Mr. ScLott. Light clouds prevailed during the day, with an atmosphere quite unsteady at times. The fin;t contact was lost by clouds, and of the last, contact the ob:-;ern1tion was uncertain ou aecount of the extreme atmospheric tremor. The two interior contacts were satisfactorily observed. Full details are given in Assistant Scbott's report, whieh appears as part of Appendix No. Hl. In this Appendix is included also the report of Assistant Colonna, who observed the 'l'ra,nsit at the same station, with a reeoIJnoitering telescope by Ploss!, haying a clear aperture of 9 centi· meters (3.5 inches) and a focal length of 0.90 meters (38 inches). Mr. Uolomm obtained observations of the two internal conta<Jts and of the last contact. Continuation of the detailed topographical suri1ey of the District of Columbia.-The detailed topographical survey of the District of Columbia was carried on continuously during the fiscal year by the party in charge of Assistant John W. Donn. The area suryeyed embraces some of the most intricate and difficult parts of the topography. In accordance with the request of the Engim·er Commissioners of the District, operations during the early part of the fiscal year were chiefly directed to the survey of the r<>gion oYer or under which the extension of the Washington aqueduct has been projected for the a11llitional water supply; that is, from Rock Creek Valley to the rlistributing reservcir west of Georgetown. 1u October, 1882, this work was finished and a tracing was furnished to the Engineer Commissioners. This tracing covered the line of the proposed aqueduct from its westem extremity to 8mith's Valley, the site intended for the new reservoir, to the east of the line of Sixth street (11ortl1west) extended. Work was theu resumed iu the valley of !tock Creek, wLere during the cold weather a shelter was afforded which permitted the plane-table to be used almost without intenuptio11 from the winds. Another winter's work, Mr. Donn thinks, will advance the surn·y to the crossing of the l\filkl1ouse Ford road, beyond which the bills are comparatively bare and less abrupt. Dnriug the months of May and June the work was carried over the open country east of Rock Creek, between Seventh street and Fourteenth street roads, and on the eastem border of the site of the new Observatory. A map submit¥ by Assistant Donn with his report shows the area completed at the close of the fiscal year. Upon the scale of the survey, 1-4800, tlte area covered during the ;year was about fi\'e square miles; the length of roads measured twelve miles, and of creeks fifteen miles. Assistant D. B. Wainwright aided in the work aud showed great interest in its development.

H. F. ·walling·, aud referred to in my last annual report, were begun by him in July, 1882, and the map substantially completed as far west as the North :\lount.ain. No trustworthy maps of the territory being available, special surveys were required of :tll t11e topographical features to be represented. Accordingly traverse surveys were m:HIP of all the roads; of the milroads wl1ere the engineer's pl:tn8 were unattainable, and of the streams throughout the ~~ntire county of Berkeley, West Virgiuia, and of those portions of Frederick, Clarke, and .J,on<loun Connties, Virginia, lying north of' the parallel of ano 4' north latitude. Distancl's along the roads were measured by odometer; directions of roads aRccrta.ined by the sun·eyor';; compass; the streams were also traversed, a chain being run along the larger creeks and rh·er:-:. while the minor streams, requiring less precise mea!,mrement, were located between road croHsings hy pacing. Traverses were also made up man;\· mountain ra,ines and along or uear the toµR of ridges and spurs, a<kantage heing taken for that purpose of wood roads whenever practicable. The positious of about thirty triangulation points luwe been fixed from time to time at conwnient localities amon,g these sun·eys, and Ute traverses haYe been carefully connected with them. Frequent obserYations with the aneroid barometer were made, a stationary record having heeu kept 011 working days every hour.

report as having been begun by Assistant A. T. Mosman for carrying the scheme of primary triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel toward the Ohio River was resumed by that officer in September, 18S:!. Starting from the liue, Piney-Pigeon, in the Kanaw)la region of West Virginia, Mr. Mosman examinrd a conntry cut into deep nrvines through which flow the numerous smal} streamfl emi1tying into the Ohio River, and with ranges of hills between these streams of nearly uniform height and heaYil~- wooded either with large timber or co\·ered with a second growth of small trees and hn;;;hes. These are so thickly crowded together as to be very difficult t-0 penetrate, and are not high enough to afford a dew of the country from their tops. Much time was necessarily spent in Rearching for stations that could be made intervisible, and, as the roads were few and ,-ery rough, tra,·el in wagon or on horseback was slow, and almost all detailed examinations were ma1le 011 foot. Flags in trees at heights of from thirty-five to one hundred and tweuty-fiYe feet aboYe ~ronnd marked the stations as selected. All angles were measured from the tops of theRe trees with an azimuth compass and pocket sextant, and relativtl heights were determined with the aneroid barometer. A practicable scheme was finally de\'eloped for extending the triangulation in the shortest time aud at the least fJxpense possible frnm tlie starting liue in West Virginia, through parts of Southeastern Ohio an1l :Northeastern Kentneky, to a line, Scioto-Johnson.

In addition to tlw Jines of deep-sea soundings and temperatures run by the Blake, a line for temperature;, only was run from the Bermudas to Cape Hatteras, the temperatures of the surface being taken eYery mile; temperatures at twenty-five fathoms depth every ten miles; at four hun1lred fathoms every thirty mile8, and at eight hundred fathoms ever~- sixty miles.

O., and make a hydrogra.phic survey of the bar at Cape Fear River entrance. · In pursuance of this duty Lieutenant Wilner reached Smithville Februar;v 4, 1883. He remarks in bis report that the shifting character of this bar is too well known to call for special mention; that the channels are well buoyed, so that the only dangers a stranger will have to contend with will be found in the very strong tidal currentis, and in the prese11ce of a most dangerous pile of rocks known as the "Stone Fence," situated off the point of Bald Head Shoal, and just at the edge of the channel. These rocks are awash at half. tide aml entirely covered at high water, SQ that not even a ripple imlicates their position. In approaching them from the northward or southward the soundings will not show their vicinity until too late to avoid them if coming with the tide.

Lieutenant Wilner expresses hiR acknowledgments for information received from Mr. Henry Bacon, assistant engineer in charge of the im11rovements at the entrance for the Engineer Bureau, and to Capts. J. H. aIHl T. Harper for many courtesies extended during the course of his survey. Leaving Smithville April 10, Lieutenant 'Vilner proceeded wit,h the vessel and party to Pamplico Sound to make a resurvey of the main channel from the Croatan to the Roanoke Marshes light, and to complete certain unfinished portions of the survey of Pamplico Sound. He passed into Pamplico Sound through Ocracocke Inlet, finding that the buo~-s were much out of place, and that unless wind and tide were both favorable, six and one-half feet of water could hardly be carried througl1. The main channel through Croatan Sound was found to be but little changed, except at the southern end, where new islands have formed and old ones have disappeared. Representations were made to Lieutenant Wilner while at Elizabeth City, N. C., of a desire on the part of navigators of the waters of Croatan and Pamplico Sounds for a change in the location of Croatan lighthouse; the reasons for the desired change are stated clearly by Lieutenant Wilner, but without expressing himself as in favor of it.

The necessary signals having been established, soundings were begun January 30, and though many delays occurred from bad wpather and thick atmosphere occasioned by fires in the forest adjacent, Lieutenant Heald was able to report the completion of the resurvey Aiiril 24. Three hydrographic sheets, on a scale of 1-10,000, showing the results of the work, have been registered in the archives. They show the river from the entrance to a point just south of Jacksonville.

Duplicates of the records and results of the observat10ns, made by Mr. Preston and by Captain Desforges, with whom he was immediately associated, will be deposited iu the archives of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Reconn1lissance of 1fie Saint John's River frorn La,ke Monroe to Lake W ashington.-The course of the Saint ,Tohn's River from Jacksonville to Lake Monroe is shown upon the reconnaissance map publisl1ed in 1878 and subsequently in another issue, with additions to 1881. Iu February, 1883, Assistant Eugene Ellicott was directed to extend t.l1is reconnaissance from Lake Monroe to Lake Washington, the rapid de~lopment of Southern Florida having created a demand for a chart of the rfrer to the bead of navigation. Mr. Ellicott's survt<y was· begnn February 27. Some extracts from his report will be of interest: "From Lake Monroe to Lake Harney the river is comparatively hold and deep, with an a.vera,ge width of two hnndretl and fifty feet, The least depth of water encountered iu a single line ()f soundings between Monroe and Harney is six feet; the greatest, twenty-two feet. The least depth

occurs where the river enters Lake Monroe. At the time the soundings were made the rh'er was within a foot or two of its lowest stage. "Lake .Jessup is a beautiful bod;y of water, and promises to become of some importance because of the good land on its south and west shores. It is, however, difficult of' approacb, as the depth of water ·about its month is meager, indeed insufficient for steamers other than the smallest at a low stage of water. "The shores of Lake Harney are bold, as bold shores go in southern waters, and sandy. The maximum depth is twelve feet, the soundings not varying from this figure for an area of one square mile in the middle of the lake. As the river is again approached my line of soundings showed a decrease to five feet. 'fhe . bottom of J,ake Harney . is hard white sand. "From Harney to Salt Lake Landing the river is exceedingly crooked, but the steamers at present engaged in the trade of Indian River experience no undue difficulty in making their trips. This landing is the point of shipment for the Titusville section of Indian Rfrt-r. The distance acros~ is eight miles. "Lake Poinsett is like other lakes on the river, excepting that the :shores are shelving and marshy. A mile east of Poinsett is a small creek or lake where is situated the lauding of' tbat name. From this landing it is three miles across to the west shore of Indiau River. There is a scattering settlement (with post-office) known as Roek T1edge. ''From Lake Poinsett, up river, the difficulties attending navigation constantly diminish. 'l'he stretch of river between Lakes Poinsett and ·winder is much better than in many parts near Jack· sonvillr. The width is about four hundred feet; depth of water, eighteen to twenty-two feet, the banks bold, and the directions remarkably straight. "The bar which must be crossed in entering the river above Lake ·winder has (according to a single line of soundings) six feet of water, and I am inclined to think that a closer survey would show eight or nine feet. ''From this point up river, or to the southward, the conditions remain favorable to navigation, ample width of river and depth of water tilJ the 'floating islands' are encountered, four or five miles above Lake Winder. "These 'islands,' as they are called by the river men, consist of a dense vegetable mat, of a foot in depth, floating on the surface of the water, t.he decomposed vegetable matter having so welded the ft oat together as to have admitted the growth of small willows four to six feet in height." In the small steamer which had been hired. for the survey, Assistant Ellicott succeeded in cut· ting through a tloat of 300 or 400 meters, and entering clear water, which onl,y"lasted half a mile, when another float, appeared. The outlines of the northern shore of J;ake Washington ca,me in sight about three miles beyond, and be.re the work was closed. Mr. Ellicott's report gives detailed statements showing the great and steady increase in the means of inland communication and in the trade and travl:.'l in the interior of' Eastern Florida. Arraugements will be made for the early publication of his reconnaissance map. Other surveys executed b.r Assistant Ellicott are referred to under the heads of Sections I and III. , Survey of the eastern coast of Florida from lndia1n River Inlet sou,thward.-Iu accordance with instructions issued towards the close of November, 1882, Assistant B.

Colonna proceeclell to the east coast of Florida, and organized his party for executing the triangulation, beach-measurement, topography and hydrography of the east coast of Florida included between the limits of latitude !.!i 0 2lY and 260 13' north. The triangulation, in connection with the beach.measurement, was begun b,v Mr. Colonna from the limits ot' .Assistant Boyd's work of the previous season near Indian River Inlet, aud car· ried by him to the southward as far as Jupiter light-house, about thirty-five miles. Thence from Jupiter light-house it was carried fifty miles southward to Junction Station by Mr. W. B. Fairfield, extra observer, under Mr. Colonna's direction. The topography was taken up near Indian River Inlet, and extended to the southward to about eight miles south of Jupiter light-house, including the shores of Saint I~ucie and Jupiter Rivers, and covering three topographical sheets on a S('.ale of 1-20,000. This work was executed by Mr. E. L. Taney, A.id in the party.

Later in the season the topography in the vicinity of Lake Worth was taken up by Mr. T. P. Borden, Aid in the party. This sheet had been partly completed when field operations closed. The beach-measurement was eommitted to the care of Mr. Borden, who carried it from Ten Station (latitude :no 05'), to Junction triangulation station, a distance of about sixty-two miles. Mr. W. B. Fairfield aided Mr. Borden in this measurement. Assistant Uolonna measured an azimuth at Ten Station, Jupiter light being used as an azimuth mark. Two magnetic stations were established, one at Uefuge Station, and one at Bell Station; at these points were determined the magnetic declination, dip, and relative total intensity, the latter by Lloyd'" method. Early in May the bydrographic work was taken up. It covers the waters from Indian River Inlet to South .Jupiter Narrows, including Saint Lucie I~iver and Peck's Lake. The result8 are shown upon two full lty(lrographic sheets, and part of a third sheet, scale 1-20,000. About one-half of the hydrography was executed by Mr. Colonna personally; the remainder by Mr. W. B. Fairfield. Field operations closed early in June. In bis report, Assistant Colonna expresses liis hearty appreciation of the earnest and efficient manner in which all work entrusted to bis Aids, Messrs. Borden, Taney, and \V, B. Fairfield was executed. During part of the season, and until his detachment April 30, Ensign Edward Simpson, U.S. N., rendered valuable service.

Survey of tlte sliores and la,goons of East Florida from Key Biscayne nortliward.-The survey referred to in the preceding paragraphs, urnler the direction of Assistant B. A. Colonna, and carried southward along the coast of East Florida, met at Junction Station (latitude 260 13' north) a surrny of a similar character carried from Key Biscayne Bay to the northward by the party in cbarge of As8istaut 0. H. Tittmann. The schooner Ready, wit.h Mr. Tittmann and party on board, arrived at Key Biecayne Bay early in February, and a search for the stat ions of the triangulation of 1849-'50 iu that vicinity was at once begun .. The North Monument established in 1855 to mark one of the ends of the pri. roary base-line measured in that year was found undisturbed; the South Monument had been washed away, and was found lying on the bottom in several feet of water. Stations "Key Biscayne" and ''Shoal Point" were recovered; the latter1 with the old light-house tower on Cape Florida, furnished a base-line for the triangulation required to connect the old work with the proposed beach-measurement. This tower, ninety feet high, overtopped the tall mangrove growth on Key Biscayne, and thus served admirably the purpose of a central station for the triangulation. In order to est~tblish points on the beach for hydrograpbic purposes, it was deemed a.1lvisable to begin the beach-measurement at" Norris Cut" in latitude 25° 45' (nearly). This line of measure· ment followed generally the high-water mark, and its direction was preserved by aligning with a four-inch universal instrument, which was carried from bench to bench, and plumbed over each one successivel;r. At the same time the difference of elevation between the benches was determined by means of this iustrument. The beach-measurement was begun February 22, and completed April 4, at Junction Station, the distance between the two point.s being about thirty-two miles. The orientation of the survey, depending on the azimuth of the line" Old Tower-Shoal Point,"

was preserved by means of angles measured between the principal signals established along the beach. A tertiar~· triangulation for checking the distances measured on the heach was carried from station "Dumfounding," in latitude 250 .571 north (near!~·), to station "Lauderdale," near latitude 260 06 1 north. At "Lauderdale" an astronomical azimuth was determined by two nights' observations made with a six-inch Gambe,y upon Polaris, direct, and reflected i11 mercury. The topographical survey extended from the head of Ke~- Biscayne Ba~' to station Lauderdale, and was finished May 10. It includes the shore-line of New River and its bayous, as well a,s that of the head of .Biscayne Bay, Dumfounding Bay, and the upper portions of Snake and Arch Creeks. New River, between its inlet and "Lauderdale," was sounded out, and some additional soundings required off Miami were made. Field operations were closed May lJ. . Subassistant John B. Weir, Ensign E. M. Katz, U.S. N., and Midsh;pmen John A. Dougherty and L. 8. Van Duzer, U. S. N ., were attached to the party. Dnty assigned to Assistant rnttmaun earlier in the fiscal year is referred to under the heading of Section Ir. Hydrographic survey between Jupiter Inlet a,nd Key BiscaJme.-A hydrographic survey of the ea1<t coast of Florida betwe~m Jupiter Inlet and Key Biscayne was completed in May, 1883, by Lieut. H. B. Mansfield, U.S. N., Assistnnt Coast SmTey, eommanding the steamer A. D. Bache. Lines were run normal to the coast about one mile apart, always as far as the fifteen-fathom, and with but few exceptions as far as the twenty-fathom cnrve, every tenth line being extended to the one-hundred-fathom curve. From Jupiter Inlet to Hillsborough Lieutenant Mansfield found the shore very clean, the three-fathom curve about one-eighth of a mile from the beach slanting gradually up to the beach, except south of Lake North Cut, where a narrow ridge runs at the edge of the three-fathom curve about ten miles to the southward. From the three-fathom currn the water deepens rapidly until an average depth of eleven fathoms is attained; it then shoals up to a ridge with nothing less than eight or ten fathoms about a mile from shore, and then falls off almost at a cast to sixteen and then to twenty fathoms, &c. Between Hillsborough and Key Biscayne it is not so clean; the inshore reef slanting at Hillsborough has usu8'.llY from three t-0 four fathoms inside, aml shoals again in some places to but five or six feet, not unfrequently extending nearly three-fourthis of a mile from shore.

Upon the completion of the survey the Bache was taken to New Yotk for refitting and repairs. Rydrographic work upon the west coast of Florida executed by Lieutenant Mansfield earlier in the seai,ion will be presently referred to under the beading of this section; duty previously per· formed by him is stated under the beading of Section II. Observations of currents at 11ta,tions off Jupiter I1tlet, Fla.-The instructions issued in February, 1883, in relation to observations of currents off the eastern coast of the United States by Master J. C. Fremont, jr., U. 8. N., commanding the schooner Drift, have already been referred to under the heading of Section III. Having occupied four current stations at points between Cape Henry and Cape Ft>ar, Master Fremont established his fifth station l\Iay 8, 1883, in the Gulf Stream oft Jupiter Inlet, anchoring in one hundred fathoms, favorable conditions of observation prevailing, a smooth sea and a light wind. This st.atiou was occupied twenty-six and one-half hours. The sixth station was also in the Stream off Jupiter Inlet; depth, two hundred fathoms; time of occupation, twent~·four hours; ·date, May 10. The seventh. station, in the axis of the Stream at a depth of about four hundred fathoms, was occupied during thirty-one and one-half hours; after completing

46

the observations at this station, the loss of an anchor through the giving way of the windlass made it advisable to return with the Drift to Femandina. At this port orders reached Master Fremont on the 18th of l\Iay directing him to take the vessel to New York, where she was prepared for service in a cruise for observations of currents between l\fontank Point and Cape May. Deep-sea soundings, with .~crial tcmperotures, between the Bahamas and the Bermudas.-The deepSt>a sounding work executed b.v the hydrographic party on board of the steamer Blake, early in the fiscal year, has already beeu referred to under the headings of Sections II anrl IV. On the 9th of December, 1882, the vessel left New York urnler command of Lieutenant Commander W. H. Brownson, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey. His instructions were to run a line of deep-sea soundings from the Bermuda Islands to the Bahamas, and then a series of normals to the northern face of the Bahamas, far enough t,o develop the two-thousand-fathom curve. The Blake anchoretl off Bermuda on the night of December rn, and after a delay of some rlays by bad weather, Lieutenant-Commander Brownson left Hamilton, and obtained his first sounding December 18, on Challenger Bank, depth,tweutv-eight fathoms. This was at 7 h. 50 m. p. m. Two hours later a sounding gaye bottom at four hundred and sixty nine fathoms, and at 7 b. 20 m. next morning a sounding was obtained in two thousand six hundred and thirty-two fathoms. With some delays, occasioned by loss of wire and thermometers, the line was completed to the Bahamas, surface, serial, and bottom temperatures being obtained in connection with the soundings whenever practical.Ile. On this line the greatest depth sounded was three thousand and seven fathoms; the lowest temperature of bottom obser\'ed was 35~0 J:i'ahr. Soundings were subsequently obtained on lines from Mariguana to Ocean Plateau; thence down through Turk's Island to the coast of Ha,yti. Another line was run from Samana Promontory to Navidad Bank, and thence out to Ocean Plateau. Upon his arrival at St. Thomas, Lieutenant-Commander Brownson inferred from an inspection of the chart to the northward of Porto Hico, in connection with the results which he had obtained on the last linti run and from the soundings of the Challenger, that very deep water would extend to the westward. His inference was soon after verified. Ou the 27th of January, in latitude 19° 40' 50" north, longitude 66° 23' 40" west of Greenwich, seventy-one miles west of the Challenger's greatest depth, he sounded in four thousand five hundred and sixty-one fathoms, finding the bottom to be brown ooze and the temperature 3tif° Fahr. This is believed to be the greatest depth from which bottom specimens and temperature have been obtained. Fifteen and a half miles soutiieast of the latter station another sounding was taken iu four thousand two hundred and twenty-three fathoms, the specimen brought up being of ooze in two layers, brown on top with an under strata of gray. Temperature at bottom was 36° Fahr. Lieutenaut-Uonunander Brownson remarks in hit:i report: "Tlie IineN of soundings normal to the general direction of the Bahamas show the remarkable manner in which these ildands rise up from the Ocean Plateau. With the exception of the line off Spanish Cay, Little Bahamas, in no case was the two thousand-fathom curve more than fourteen miles from the nearest land, and in one instance we found one thousand nine hundred and seventy· six fathoms only two and one-half miles from land. This would give a declivity of :l80, Referring to the deep soundiug four thousand five hundred and sixty-one fathoms taken north of Porto"Rico, it is probable that deeper water can be found north and east of it, and I trust it may soon be investigated." · From the data furnished by this aud previous cruises of the Blake was constructed a model of the western part of the North Atlantic Basin.

H. S. Knapp, U. S. N. The commanding officer expresses his apprecfation of the great interest taken in the work by all the officers. · Arriving in New York early in February, Lieutenant-Commander Brownson received instructions to prepare the steamer for deep-sea sounding work and oft'·shore 11ydrography in the approaches to New York and in the vicinit.y of Nantucket Shoals. Topograpliio and hydrographic survey of the west co<UJt of Florida between Charlotte Harbor and Tampa Bay.-Having org·anized his party on board the schooner Quick at Manatee, Florida, early in December, 1882, Subassistant Joseph Hergesheimer proceeded to execute instructions directing him to make a topographic and hydrographic survey of the west coast of Florida between 'I.'ampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor. The topographic survey was begun at Hunter's Point, Sarasota Ba;y, on January 1, 1883, and completed to Bocilla Pass at the entrance of Lemon Bay, on th(\ 4th of June. During this period the weather was favorable for the work, the season being remarkable for an almost entire absence of the heavy northers which are usually of frequent occurrence dnring the winter. The inside hydrography also was finished by June 1; it. included the hydrography of Sara....,ota and Little Sarasota Bays, Dona Bay, and Roberts Bay, and that of the bar and harbor of Stump Pass. That of Lemon Bay was postponed, owing to the lateness of the Reason. Tidal observations were recorded at seven station8 which were conuected with each other and with the bench-mark established at Egrnont light in 1873.

Bay.-In pursuance of instructions issued to Lieut. A. B. :Mansfield, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, he proceeded with his party on board of that vessel to the west coast of Florida, to continue the hydrography off that coast, northward and southward of Tampa Bay. Arriving in Tampa Bay ,Januar_y 17, 1883, he4e$tablished a tide-gauge at Egmont Key and began soundings. One double hydrogniphic sheet, scale l-40,000, showing the hydrography between Blind Pass and Big Pass was finished February 17. With reference to the characteristics of this part of the coast, Lieutenant Mansfield remarks: "The bottom is irregular and in ridges to five or six fathoms, and then deepens gradually. The shore is low, and the hills back of the beach are usuall.v, in clear weather, just seen from the ten-fathom curve. In running this work to the limits of the five-fathom curve, the currents were found to be tidal. Outside the prevailing current, was found a slight one from the southward along the coast. In calms this current had a rate of about three-tenths of a knot, increasing to six-tenths in a fresh breeze from south around to west. It would be:checked after northerly winds, and in a few cases, after a heavy norther, it had a slight set to the southward." After a~trip to Key West for coal and store.ll, work was taken up on that part of the CO'.tst between Bocilla Pass and New Pass, March 2. Within half a mile of the shore, the water was found to deepen to four or five fathoms, except off the passes. Beyond that depth the deepening was gradual, as on ·the upper sheet. '£he same current eft'ect was noted. The hydrographic sheet, a double one, scale 1-40,000, was finished April 10. Previous to this date, some soundings had been made in the west channel of the Manatee River; these are shown upon a separate sheet, scale 1-10,000.

ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, LOUISIANA, AND ARKANSAS, INCLUDING GULF COAST, POHTS, AND RIVERS.( SKETCHES Nos. 1, 6, rn, 14, AND 24.)

Reconnaissa,nce for the connection of the Gulf coast triangulation on Mobile Bay, Ala., and vicinity with the primary triangulation at or near Atlanta, Ga.-Having been charged with making a reconnaissance for a triangulation between the Gnlf of Mexico at or near Mobile Bay, awl the primary triangulation near Atlanta, Ga., Assistant S. C. McCorkle proceeded to Mobile, Ala., in Jauuar,y, 1883, and began a careful search to ascertain what points of the old triangulation could be fouurl with which to connect the Rcheme of reconnaissance. For transportation, which greatly facilitated his labors, Mr. McCorkle ackllowledges his i11debtedness to Capt. A. N. Damrell, United States Engineers, and to Capt. T. W. Lay, United States Revenue Marine. In the explorations for the old triangulation marks on and near Mobile Bay, great changes of shore-line aud other topographical features were found. The coast has been visited by gales of great severity since the former survey, and the shores of the bay, espeeially at the points and bluffs where stations were generally established, have been washed away from thirty to sixty feet. Upon Dauphin Island, where search was made for the monuments marking the ends of the primary baseline measured in 1847, the granite blocks at East Base were found, but were lying on their sides apart from each other and entirely out of position. Search was made unsuccessfully for the underground marks. The blocks which had marked the West Base could not be found. Nearly twothirds of the island on the south side has been entirely submerged, and the south shore has been very largely washed away, while the north shore-line seems to have been greatly extended. Pelican Island has entirely disappeared. Having identified five poiuts of the f'ornmr triangulation, one of which was tlrn station at Fort Morgan, Assistant McCorkle began his reconnaissance of the country between Mobile and Atlanta. This duty occupied him during the montlts oiiJMarch and April. His report gives full details in regard to the features of the country, with statements of the location, general direction, and elevation of the ridg-es, and concludes by recommending the adoption of either Kenesaw-Carnes or Carnes-Indian Mountain, li11es of the primary triangulation between the Maryland and Georgia base.Jines, as bases for the triangulation between Atlanta and the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. W. 0. Jones served as acting Aid in the party. In the earlier part of the fiscal year Assistant MeCorkle was engaged in duty which is referred to under the heading of Section ll. Oontinuation of tlte survey of the coast of Louisiana, west of the Mississippi River.-A topographic and hydrographic survey of the south coast of' Louisiana, from Barataria Bay eastward towards the Mississippi Passes, was c;lrried on by Assistant C.H. Boyd during February, March, and part of April, 1883. - Having organized his party on board the steamer Barataria, Mr. Boyd arrhTed in Barataria n·ay I<'ebruary 7, and hegan work by a search for stations of the triangulation of 1876, which might serYe as a base of operations. Having recovered "N. E. Base" and" Grand Terre," a triangulation solely for the determination of topograpltic and bydrographic points was carried from this line as a base as far as Sandy Point, near the present mouths of the "jump." As soon as point.s enough could be determined, the shore:line survey was begun at Ronquille Bay, and followed the triangulation on the outer islands, and the bays and bayous adjacent thereto, covering ground enough to develop the characteristics of the Gulf shore as far as Skofield's Bayou. Soundings were made in the bayous and shoal-water bays inclosed by the topographical sheets. Tidal records were kept near ea.ch anchorage of the steamer during the time that this work was in progress. ·

SurvmJ of the coast of Louisia-n.a from Sabine Pass eastward.-U nder the direction of Assistant F. Walley Perkins, and in pursuance of instructions issued in NoYember, 1882, a party was organized for the extension of the survey of the coast of Louisiana from Sabine Pass to Calcasieu Pass. Mr. Perkins organized bis party and began preliminary arrangements for the work in December, but actual operations were delayed for a time by heavy rains, producing an oYerfiow of the countrr and rendering the marshes almost impassable. As soou as the weather would admit, the snrve.r was pushed Yigorously iu its sm'ernl branches. A.bout the middle of January the stations in the vicinity of Sabine Pass wrre occupied to begin the triangulation by Mr. G. F. Bird, Aid in the party. The topographical survey was commenced near the Pass at the same time by Subassistant W. C. Hodgkins. During parts of February and March a base-line of verification was twice measured; the two measurements were found to be in close accord. The latitude of West Base Station was determined with the meridian telescope, and the azimuth of the base-line was established by observations upon a Urs. Min., 51 Cephei, and o Urs. Min. This work, with the continuation of the triangulation and topography towards Calcasieu light, aud a hydrograpbic survey of a portion of Calcasieu Pass, occupied the party until near the end of May, when field operations were closed. Assistant Perkins' report contains suggestions derived from his experience in the field as to the best methods of prosecuting the survey 011 this part of the coast.

The statistics presented· bear witness to the: energy displayed by the party of Assistant Perkins in the conduct.of the survey. Work executed by him earlier in the ti.seal year is referred to under the heading- of Section XVI. Determination of the longitude of Little Rock, Ark., by exchn.nge of telegraphw signals with Saint Louis, .Mo.-In November, 1882, a determination of the .longitude of Little Rock, Ark., was made by exchanges of telegraphic signals with Saint Louis, Mo. The station a.t Saint Louis was occupied during the summer and autumn of 1882 by the party of Assistant G. 'Y· Dean for the exchange of

Hydrography of the coast of Texas, from Gafoeston entrance, ea.stirard.-I1ieut. E. M. Hughes, U.S. N., Assistant Uoast Survey, having assumed command of tbe steamer Gedney, in pursuance of iustructious issued in December, 1882, proceeded to Galveston, Tex., and organized hiis rarty on board that vessel for tlle extension of tbe l1ydrography of tbe coast of Texas from Galrnston entrance to the limits of the completed triangulation. On the passage from New York tbe steamer ·e11cou11tered very bad weather alHl sustained damages whicl1 compelled ber commander to put into Smithville for shelter~ and to have her docked at New Orleaus for repairs. It was therefore not until Fehruar,r 14 that field-work could be begun. The work executed between this date and the close of the season, April 30, cow prised a survey of Galveston inner bar, the ~rootion of signals along the beach for a distance of forty miles east· ward of Galveston, and the completion of off-shore soundings, to include the ten-fathom curve, to a point thirty miles to the eastward of Galveston entrance. This leaves twenty-five miles of hydrographic work ~·et to be done to complete the hydrography to Sabine Pass. · Lieutenant Hughes haR submitted a compreheusive report of his survey, complete as regards all details of its execution, and stating the leading features and peculiarities of the coast. Some extracts from this report are here given: "The coast eastward from Galveston being extremely low, large signals were necessary, and these were bum in the mo:;;t substautial mauuer to withstaud the northers and t!Je southeast gales prevailing during the winter months. For the first twenty-five miles from Galveston no signals were found, but the points were recovered with no trouble whatever, owing to the fact of each one being marked hy a hu,.;J1el or two of white shelhi on the surface. The signals erected a.re from forty to sixty fret in lw.ight, and will undoubtedly he found standiug during the coming winter. "During the past 1waso11 the weather was extremely unpropitious, February being foggy and March and April stormy, with much haze and fog. In almost every instance, where the sea was smooth enough for working, the weatlier was so thick that signals could not be seen two miles off shore. Nead~· all the work accomplished was achieved only by going out on the back of a norther and putting hi every available moment, for as the northerly wind died out it invariably hauled around to the eastward~ and within forty-eight hours blew u11 heavily from southeast. ''No regular current stations were made, but the current was measured on anchoring, before getting under wa.v, and, at times, at the end of a line off shore. On the shoal area, extending well off the coa"t 11ear Galvei-ton, the current is largely controlled by the wiud in tlirectiou, 1md its strength is Yariable, in ;;o marked a degree that the result obtained in one place is of not the least value in iorf'CllRtiug that at another five miles further out or in. The maximum current encountered was on April 18, st.ea.ming to the westward for Galnston, about four miles off shore. J!'or a period of 6.2 bours we stemmed a mean current of 1.6 kuots per hour, setting ENE. (Wiud SSW. 4-6.)"

Lieut. C. McR. Winslow, U. S. N., and Ensigns T. M. Brumby, W. C. Caufield, and William Truxtun, U. S. N., were attached to the hydrographic party under the direction of Lieutenant Hughe~. After the close of the season, the Gedney proceeded to New York, where she was prepared for service on Long Island Sound. Duty performed by Lieutenant Hughes earlier in the fiscal-year is referred to under the heading of Section II. Topography of the shores of Nueces Bay; tria.ngulation iii the vicinity of Matagorda Bay; measurement of a base of verification and observations for azirnuth.-Witb a view of resuming work upon the coast of Texas at the earliest date that. the abatement of the yellow-fever epidemic on that coast rendered desirable, Assistant R. E. Balter proceeded to San Antonio, Tex., and thence to Oorpus Christi, in the autumn of 1882, in pursuance of instructions directing him to complete the survey of Corpus Christi Bay. He took up work on the shores of Nueces Bay (the upper part of (..Jorpus Christi Bay) late in Octobt>r, and finished the topograph~- needed, early in Januar,Y, 1883. Ile wa.<> then uirected to organize his party at Matagorda, Tex., for the verification of the old triangulation between the head of Matagorda Bay and the terminal points of the primary triangulation from Galveston Island southwestward. For this purpose he first made search for two or more µoints of the triangulations of 1853 and 1855, and connected them by a new triauguhttion, depending upon a new base, the site of which was selected by him on Matagorda Peninsula and its length measmed. All of the old station points immediately on the coast of the Gulf had been washed away or destroyed, but on the mainland the old lines, Seven Mile-Lim Oak and Prairie-Kenner, were re-established, connected with the new· base, and the direction of the base-line determined by observations of azimuth. Later in the season search was made for stations of the triangulation of 1851 between Cany Bayou and ·west Base, Galveston Island, but without other success than that of finding two points, "Cottonwood" and "Oyster Creek," both on the side of the main land. Field operat.ions were dot>ed eal'ly i11 June, and arrangements made to continue the work in the following autumn.

Establislmient of a magnetic ~tlf-registering-record station at Los Angele,s, Cal.-Reference was made in my last annual report to the site select.etl for a permanent magnetic Htation for observations to be made in co-operation with the work of the Signal Office and with that of the International Polar Commission. ln pursuance of instructions issued in July, 18821 Mr. Werner Sut>ss, of the Uoast and Geodetic SurYey, proceeded to Los Angeles, Cal., and took temporary charge of the magnetic observatory, which had been erected by Assistant James S. Lawson in the grounds of the State Normal School. Immediately upon his arrival Mr. Suess began preparations for placing the self-registering record instruments (the Adie maguetograpbs) in position and adjustment. The main pillars for the clock, the declinometer, the horizontal and vertical force magnets having been set before the erection of the building, it remained only to place the pillars for the lamps and rea{ling telescopes. li'or this purpose Mr. 8uess mounted the instruments temporarily, and by the close of July had secured the slate and marble bases on their respective column8. The final adjustments were made With the co-operation of Mr. Marcus Baker, Acting Assistant, who arrived in Los Angeles early in

August to take charge of the observatory. By the 28th of September, the sensitive photographic paper was in place upon the c.rlinders in readiness for the adjustments of the driving clock, of illumination, and for testing the chemical processes. In October the actual registry with the magnetograph began, and a continuous record of the magnetic e!Pme11ts was obtained photographically. Determinations of tile absolute ntlues of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were made in September on the usual term days, and were continued monthly. For this purpose a temporary building was put up at some distance from the one containing the differential instruments. The changes of magnetic declination, changes of horizontal force, and changes of vertical force recorded bj" the magnetographs on separate sheets have been developed imccessfully during eacl1 month up to the date at which this report closes. The tabulations have also been made and the means calculated . .A tltermograph record, on which the temperature of the magnet room is recorded automatically e\·ery balf:bour, has been kept continuously since November, 188:.!. Time observations for the regu_ lation of the standard chronometer have been taken regularly eac!J month.

Since January, 1883, Mr. Lucius Baker has aided in the routine work of the observatory. 001itinuation of the primary triangulation northward from Po·int Ooncepcion.-Assistant James S. Lawson, upon ltis return in August, 1882, from Los Angeles, Cal., where he had superintended the building of a magnetic observatory, was assigned to the charge of the primary triangulation northward of Point Concepcion. The scheme, as laid out, involved the occupation of a series of primary points, connecting with "Santa Lucia," one of the southern stations of Assistant Davidson's work, and starting from the line "Lospe-Tepusquet." Having posted heliotropcrs at the stations to be observed upon, Assistant Lawson occupied "Tepusq uet." Progress was much delayed at this station by the thick and smoky condition of the atmosphere, and by a prevalence of strong east and northeast winds bringing dense clouds of dust from the Great Valley of California. Jn many instances these dust storms would so envelop the countr.v that in a few hours even the tops of the nearest ridges, half to three-quarters of a mile distant, were barely visible. Much injury was done to the camp by the violence of the·winds, two tents and the flies of others being blown to pieces. · While at Tepusquet, Assistant Lawson was directed to report temporarily to Assistant George Davidson for duty in the party organized by him for the observation of the Transit of Venus at a statiou in New Mexico. Leaving his party in charge of his aid, Mr. P.A. Welker, in November, 1882, Mr. Lawsou, upon bis return in Jauuary, 1883, found that the work at Tepusquet had been completed and that the occupation of Lospe bad just been beguu. At this station a succe8sion of fogs, quite unusual for the season, was experienced, the greater number of days in March and April being foggy. All of the observations needed at Lospe were obtained b;S' the 26th of .May, when field opera· tions closed. Mr. Lawson and his aid returned to San Francisco, and, in accordance with instrnctfons, they reported to .Assistant George Davidson for duty under his direction.

Not included in the above summary are the numerous sets of obsen·ations taken for the determination of instrumental constants. At Tepusquet the third and fourth contacts of the Transit of Venus, December 6, 1882, were observed by Mr. Welker. For details, see Appendix No. Hi. Near Lospe Station was found Substitute Station of the tertiary triaug·ulation of ARsistant Greenwell in 1878. Thh~ was connected with the primary triangulation both by measures of angles and of distances from Lospe by a stet'! tape. Reference will bemade under the heading of Section XVI to the work of.Mr. Lawson m;assistant astronomer in the party under the charge of Assistant George Davidson for the obser,·ation of the Transit of Venus at Cerro Roblero, N. J\'Iex. Hydrographic sur1'ey from lffonterey southward.-In continuation of the h;vdrographic survey of the coast of California, Lieut. W. T. Swinburne, U. S. N., .Assistant Coast Survey, commanding the steamer McArthur, proceeded with his party on board that Yes.·el to Montere~', Cal., earls in January, 1883 1 in accordance with instructions issued during the pre\'ious month. Having located his tidal station and begun a set of obsen·ations to obtain a plane of reference for his soundings, Lieutenant Swinburne took advantage of the favorable weather which prevailed generally during the season and completed the hydrography from Point Pinos to Cooper's Point between the 5th of January and the 16th of May. This tidal station was referred to the Coast Survey bench-mark established near Monterey in 1854. The results of the survey are shown upon five hydrographic sheets-ea~h upon a scale of 1-10,000.

The following-named officers were attached to the hydrographic party on board of the McArthur: Lieuts. J.B. Milton and W. P. Elliott, U.S. N.; Master F. H. Lefavor, U.S. N.; and Midshipman P. B. Bibb, U.S. N. . Duty assigned to Lieutenant Swinburne on the California coast in other portions of the fiscal :1·ear until his detachment from the Sun·ey in May, 1883, will be referred to later, under the heading of this section~ Operations at San Francisco, Oa l., for the determ,inaetion of the longitude of the Transit of Venus Sta,tion near Fort Selden, N. M., by exchanges of telegraphic signals. . Observations of the Transit at San Francisco.-After the completion of the observations of the Transit of Venus of December, 1882, at Cerro Roblero, near Fort Selden, New Mexico, under the direction of Assistant George Davidson, arrangements were made by Mr. Davidson for the determination of the longitude of his station by exchanges of telegraphic signals with San Francisco. The station of obsen·ation on the summit of Cerro Roblero was referred by triangulation to a station at Fort Selden, and this latter station was connected by telegraph line with the astronomical station of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at Lafa~·ette Park, San Francisco. Assistants Davidson and Lawson made the observations for time at Fort Selden, using the Davidson meridian instrument No. 1. The charge of the work at the San Francisco statiOn was assimied w Assistant J .·J. Gilbert, with Mr. C. 1:t Hill as recorder. Time was determined with the Tronghton and Simms transit No. 3. Clock signals were exchanged upon fh·e successive nights, complete sets of time determinations being obtained before and after each exchange of signals. Assistants Davidson a.nd Gilbert subsequently observed upon three nights for personal equation.

Assistant Davidson gi\'es the following results for the longitudes of Fort Selden and the Transit of Venn:-; Statiou from tile field reductions: Telegraphie longitude, Fort Selden Station, 7h 07m 40·.56 west of Greenwieh. Telegrapbic longitude, Geno Roblero, 7h 07rn 41 ·.24 west of Greenwich. At the Davichmu Observatory in San Fr:tncisco, and elsewhere upon the Pacific coast, an unusually stead.)· atmosphere prevailed upon the day of the Transit of Venus, and successful obser. vatiomi were made at the station just named by Assistant Gilbert, who had been assigned to the charge of the work. Mr. Gilbert, aided by 1\Ir. Ferdinand Westdahl, used the 6.4-inch equatorial in making measures of the polnr awl equatorial diameters of the planet ou the sun's disk, the distance apart of the cusps, and the I II and IV contacts. The other obst·rvers at this station, with other i11strume11ts, were Assistant E. F. Dickins, Mr. C. B. Hill, aud Mrs. George Davidson. At the Coast and Georletic Station on Mount Diablo, Cal., observations of the Transit were made by :\1r. ,Justin P. l\Ioore, vice preside11t of the California Academ,Y of Sciences: D('tailed reports of the observations at the California stations are included in the full report of Assistant DaYidson, which has been traus1J1itted to the Superintendent and to the President of the Tram;it of Ven us Corn mission. Hefereuce will be made later under the heading of this section to the occupation of Mount Tama.lpais and to other duty in the field and in the office executed by the party of Assistant Davidson. Completion of the supplementary survey of the San Fra,ncisco Ptminsula.-As stated in my last annual report, the supplementary topographical survey of the Sau Fra11ci.-;co Penimmla, which had been committed to the charge of Assistant I,ouis A. Se11gteller, waf!·nearly completed at tlui beginning of tlie present fiscal year. A hydrographic examination of th(1 city front of San Francisco and of Oakland Creek and its approaches was in progress at the end of June and was finished early in ,July, 1882. vYith this, it was deemed that all necessary work bad been accomplished. The byclrographic sheet was finished at the San Francisco suboffice by Mr. Ferdinand Westdahl, draughtsman, under Assistant Sengteller's direction, nnd transmitted to Washington about the middle of Augmit. Duty subseqneutly assigned to Assistant Sengteller will be referred to under the beading of Section XI.

DeterminaHons of the force of gravity and of relative magnetic intensity at Smi Francisco, Cal., in conneetfon with similar determinations to be made at Point Barrow, Alaska.-In furtherance of
pla11s inhiated <luring the preceding year, by virtue of which the Coast and Geodetic Survey coopnatecl with the Signal Service in establishing a station of the International Polar Commission at Point Barrow, Alaska, Mr.RA . .Marr, Actiug Assist:mt, was directed in May, 1883, to proceed to Sau Frauch;co, Cal., and tbeuce to Point Barrow with the Signal Service Relief Expedition, appointed to sail from the fornwr port in June, 1883. Before leaving Sau Francisco Mr. Marr was instructed to swing his pendulum (Peirce No. 4) at such station as should he selected by Assistant Davidson as a permanent pendulum station, and to vibrate the magnet of his magnetometer on several days with a view of determining the relative horizoual i11te11sit,y lwtwceu San Francisco and Point Barrow. Six sets of oscillations were obtained for the gravity determinations at the pendulum station, coruer of Clay and Octavia streets, a pier having been set up, and a small building constructed for that purpoile. The magnet of magnetometer No. 6 was vibrated upon four successive days at the Presidio :Magnetic Station. On the 16th of ,June Mr. Marr left San Francisco on the schooner Leo for Ooglaamie, Point Barro"", Alaska. Det-Onninations of the force of gra,vity at Ban Francisco in connection with similar determinations at tlte Transit of Venus Station in New Zealand, and at stations in Australia a1id Eastern Asia.Assistant Edwin Smith, who had been in charge of the party for the obser>ation of the Transit of Venus at Auckland, New Zeala11d, and by whom bad been made sets of observations with the Kater invariable pemlulums at the Transit of Venus Station and at other stations in the east, arrived at San Francisco with bis assistant, Prot~ B. S. Prichett, on the 31st of May, 1883. Be

brought with him the Kater pendulums, to be swung, in accordance with in;;;tructions, at the pendulum station selected by Assisbmt Davidson at the corner of Clay and Octada streets, San Francisco. Having rendered some assista11ce to Mr. Marr, whose pro!-ipective work in Alaska has just J?een referred to, Mr. Smith swung the three Kater 11rmlulnms coutinnonsly from .Juuc ~o to June 26, observations for time being made on each night. Profei-;sor Prichett aicle<l iu the work until his detachment June 22, after which Mr. Smith had the aid of Assistant B. F. Dickins. Further reference is made to the valuable comparative determinations of gTavity obtained by means of these pendulums in Part I of thiR report, under the heading of" Special Scientific ·work," and again towards the close of Part II, under the heading "Special Operations." Tidal observations with self·regi.~tering tide-ga.uge continued at Sancelito, near 8an Fmnci.Yco Bay entrance.-The self-registering tide-gauge at Sancelito,just inside of the entrauce to the bay of San Francisco, has been run ver_y successfull.Y and without interruption by Mr. I~. Gray. Tile work has been done under the direction of Assistant Davidson, who transferred the gauge and the datum plane in 1877 from the J<'ort Poi11t Statio11, where tidal obserrntions bad been continued for about twenty -three years. This. datum plane bas been adopted 'US a plane of referpnee h;y the city of San Francisco, the State Board of Harbor Commissioners, and the railroad companies. Constant application is made for data from tbe ohserYatiOUS. The earthquake waves from the great Java earthquake w1·re reported from thiis tidal station before any notice of earthquake or volcanic erupti011 bad been madt~ known. Occupation of a station of the primary triangulation north of San Francisco Bay.-In continuation of the primar~· triangulation north of San Fra.ndsco Bay, and to complete tl1e serieR of directions iu the Dm·idsou quadrilateralR coming· from the Yolo Base Lint>, As,,;istaut George Da ,-idson had made arrangements, at the beginning of the fiscal year, for the occupation of l\Iount Tamalpais. As mentioned in my last annual report, the station was prepared for occupation by Subassistant Pratt, and upon Mr. Davidson's arrival, Augn:4 24, olmerrntions were begun. The work included a full series of horizoutal directions UJHHl seHn main stations and four primary and secondary stations. One of these was the dome of the Lick Observatory at 1\lount Hamilton; observations from Sierra Marina will determine its gt:>ogrnphieal poRition. With reference to the weather experienced at Mount 'famalpais and the methods of observation, &c., some extracts from .Assistant DaYidson's report are given: "The seal!on was exceptionally unfavorable for triangubtiou, the worst I have met with for many years. The smoky atmosphere was per,,;iste.nt to four thousand or five thousand feet eleva· tion; the winds at the height of om station were rarel.v strong, :rnd the ,,;moke w:~s ~l'hlom cleared away. For days and days it was frequently impoesible to see over five miles. l never saw the signal on l{.ocky Mound, distant only nineteen and one-half miles, and finally had to use a heliotrope there. The smallest heliotrope I used during the season was three inches square; six inches square failed to penetrate forty miles in wh:tt was the medium condition of the smoke. This smoke comes from the burning forests in the north and in the Sierra Nevada, and from the burning of the high grain stubble of t.he many valle_ys. The fogs below ns were nsnally one thousand two hundred to one thousand six hundred feet deep, and when the,y rose higher they sl'emed increase the trouble by creating a bright haz~. When the fogs would clear from the ,-alleys and variable winds blow, the heliotrope signals woul<l appear as flames or boiliug oujeets of thirty-five t-0 fifty seconds diameter. "The total number of observations upon the main stations is nine hundred and forty-two in twenty-three positions of the instrument, the plan involving two observations in each position; broken series necessarily increased the number on some stations. The number of ocular puint.i11gs was three thousand five hundred and fifty. , "For my initial direction I used Mount Diablo, thirty-eight, miles distant, observing upon it m connection with the azimuth observations. In all of these observations I used the ocular ~icromewr readings; the heliotropes were f'reqnently twent.y, twenty.five, and thirty seconds in diametier, very irregular, and IJoiling or fiantiug without any nucl~us; when smaller, jumping five to ten seconds each side of the cross hairs, or slowly moving five seconds, so slowly that I could not decide sometimes where the mean lay. Without using the ocular wicrometer to correct the initial pointing I should frequently have boon compelled to forego observing, and thus protract the work.

In its use l feel a certainty and confidence which have greatly impressed me with the value of the method, and the results confirm my judgment. Even when all the signals are showing, the method has never prevented me from making all the observations necessary at any morning or afternoon work." For azimuth, observations were made upon B. A. 0. 4165 at western elongation, and a Urs. Min. at easteru elongation, the position of the instrument being changed fol' each star. From Mount Tamalpais the light of the six-iuch piano-convex aziHiuth lens at Mount Diablo {thirty-eight miles distant) was frequently ·isible to the naked eye, and was sometimes obsened through moderate smoke. The ocular micrometer readings were used on the Mount Diablo light, but not on the st::ir. At the close of each night's work the direction of the light on the S. E. Farallon was observed. · For azimuth two hundred and sixty-seven observations were made on the mark and three hundred and seventy-six on the stars. The number of ocular pointings was one thousand. For time and latitu<le, the observations were made hy Subassistant J. P. Pratt, with meridiau instrument No. l and zenith telescope No.1. For latitude, twenty-eight pairs of stars were observed on an average of seven nights, and for time, two hundred and forty-two observations were made on twenty-two nights. The usual observations for instrumental constants were made. Subassistant E. F. Dickins was assigned to duty in Mr. Davidson'R party on the ~!)th of July. He assisted in the preparations for field-work, examined several main triangulation stations and posted the heliotropers, set up the azimuth lens at Mount Diablo, and observed the vertical angles to all of the main stations. For this purpose four hundred and twenty-six double zenitl1 distances were observed upon eight objects. At this station Assistant Davidson and Subassistant Pratt observed upon the great comet of 1882, making meridian observations for right ascension ancl declination on three days, and subsequently a large number of observations for altitude and azimuth. Mr. C. B. Hill kept the records of observation of horizontal directions and of azimuths, and aided Mr. Davidson and his assistants in the current work of the party. By the 9th of October, all observatious ueeded at Mount Tamalpais were completed. It had been expected to occupy Sierra Marina as the next station in tbe series, but the delays caused by bad weather, and the necessity " of beginning at once preparations for the organization of the party to observe tbe Transit of Venus at a station in New Mexico, made a postponement of that occupation unavoidable. Full reference is made in Part I of this report, and under the heading of Section XVI in thiR part, to the observation of the Transit under the direction of Assistant Davidson. After his return from that duty early in 1883 to the close of the fiscal year he was occupied iu the preparation of his report upon the observation of the Transit, in the completion of his "Field Catalogue of 1278 Time and Circumpolar Stars," and in the compilation of material for a new edition (the fourth) of the Coast Pilot of Oalifornia, Oregon, and Washington Territory. The great amount of new material available since the publication of the edition of 1869 has made it necessary to rewrite this Directory, and the usual office duties have retarded its speedy completion. The first part, comprising the coast from San Diego to San Francisco, will be put in print whilst the second part is in preparation. In answering calls for information upon the suboffice at San l!'rancisco, Assistant Davidson had the aid of .MesHrs. Ferdinand W estdahl and C. B. Hill; the former aided also in Coast Pilot work, and the latter in geueral office-work and at the observatory. During the year, assistance was rendered by Assistant Davidson to the parties of .A.8sistant Smith and of Mr. Preston and Mr. Marr in making their pendulum experiments at the Lafayette Park station, where a.temporary building had been erected for this work and for comparing base· bars. Continuation of the hydrographic survey in the vicinity of Point Arena, Oat-Early in July, 1882, Lieut. W. T. Swinburne, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Surv~y, was instructed to make ready for sea the steamer :McArthur under his command, and to proceed to the vicinity of Point Arena, Cal., in order to ma.~ hy~rographic survey in continuation of that made by his party during tbe precedmg season. o this surTey between "Bodega Bay and Point Arena, reference was made in my I.Mt annual report. ·

F. l~od_ gers as the result of his reconnaissance of the previous year having been accept~d, he was instructed in ,July, 1882, to occupy the stations in the order deemed best as soon as the resumption of the work became practica.ble. Having organized his party for the field, he established his camp upon King Peak, Humboldt Comity: California, a mountain of about four thousand oue lmntlred feet in height, and began ob8ervations. This station forms a quadrilateral with the primary stations Great Caspar, Sanhedrim, and Lassie to the south and east, and another quadrilateral with Bear Ridge, Mad River Summit, and Lassie to the north and east. (See Sketch No. 17.) The season proved exceptionally unfavorable ou account of smoke and fog, the former being so dense that for days at a time not, eveu the outlines of mounta.ins four or five miles distant were visible. This constant prevalence of smoke, more or less dense, during the months when access to the elevated peaks of' the north coast range is practicable, presents a serious obstacle to the satisfactory progress of' the primary triangulation, and some method of overcoming it remains to be devised. All of the observations of horizontal directions and vertical angles desired were· obtained at King Peak by the 28th of October, and arrangements were at 'once begun by Assistant Rodgers for the occupation of "Lassie," a station six thousand two hundred feet in height. Part of the equipments had been packed down the mountain trail, when a storm of rain, hail, and snow came on, which, for severity and duration, exceeded any that l\lr. Rodgers had experienced during twenty.five years of camp life. He was storm-bound with bis party for ten days at King Peak. After the storm abated, it was found impracticable to approach" Lassie?'; hence the occupation of that station was necessarily deferred to another seasou. Assistant Rodgers expresses bis high appreciation of the services of Assistant Stehman Forney who aided him in the field work at King Peak, and subsequently in the revision of the record: and in the computations of results. In this duty, and in collating the original tiehl-uotes relatin~ to descriptions of stations of the i1orth coast tertiary triangulation, Messrs. Itodgers and ~'orne) were occupied at the suboffice in San Francisco until the close ot' the fiscal year. SECTION XI.

UNITED STATBS OOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

August 11 to begin a sur\'ey of the Umpquah River, Oreg. This is the largest stream which enters the Pacific between the Sacramento and Columbia Rivers. A preliminary survey of the · entrance was published in 1854. Through the kindness of the Coos Bay Steamship Company, 1\Ir. Seugteller and bis party were landed at Gardiner, on the Umpquah River, August 15, and the next morning he established bis camp at Winchester Bay, llear the mouth of the river. Field operations were begun by locating a preliminary base upon the sand dunes lying upon the north bank of the river and extending from the mouth northward. Pending the arrival of the subsidiary base apparatus, a measurement of the base was made ·with steel tape. Observations of horizontal angles were then begun, a sufficient number of triangulation stations having been established; and about the middle of September the topography of the shores of the river and approaches was commenced. In October the base-line, one thousand one hundred and ninety-two meters in length, was measured with the subsidiary base apparatus. Observations of horizontal angles and plane-table work were continued till NoYember 17, when fieJli operations were closed. Assistant Sengteller remarks that in crossing the bar all sailing vessels are now towed in and out by powerful tugs, practically removing the dangers attendant upon passing a narrow channel with strong currents and usually heavy swells. Botl1 the bar and entrance are constantly shifting, but at the time of his survey could be safely crossed, except in rough weather, by vessels drawing thirteen to fourteen feet water. The nver is navigable to Gardiner, a large mill site, about seven miles above its mouth, for any vessel which can cross the bar, while to Scottsburg, which is practically the head of nadgation, and twenty-five miles above its mouth, seven feet may be carried. About a mile above Gardiner a large tributarJ·-Smith River-empties into the Umpquah, affording about the same advantages of navigation as the main river. At the beginning of the season dense smoke from the many forest fires raging along the coast materially impeded the progress of the work, and towards the close delays occurred owing to heavy and protracted rains.

He will resume the Umpquah River survey at the earliest date practicable. Continuation of the survey of the Cohnnbia River and tri/Jutaries.-At the beginning of the fiscal yeal' Assistant Olm·eland Hock well was engaged in making a topographical survey of the Columbia River lowlands between Saint Helens and the mouth of the Willamette. Abbut throo-fourtbB of the work was completed liy the 28th of October, when field operations closed. Mr. Rockwell was then directed to report for duty at the suboffice in San Francisco, and was engaged there until June in inking and duplicating records of field-work. Early in that month he was instructed to proceed to Portland, Oreg., preparatory to resuming charge of the Columbia River survey. The progress of that work and of other examinations and surveys assigned to Assistant Rockwdl will be stated in my next annual report. Hydr()graphic surveys of Gray's Harbor and in the Straits of Fuca and Ad11iiralty Inlet.-Having received the requisite instructions, Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, U. S. N., Assistant Ooast Survey,)>ro. ceeded with his party, organized on board of the schooner Earnest, to make a hydrographic sutTey near Cape Partridge, at the entrance to Puget Sound. He was also directed to make such addi· tional soundings between Point Partridge and New Dungeness as were needed to complete the bydrography, including that of Dallas Bank. A hydrographic sheet, scale 1-20,000, including in its limits a distance of one mile west of New Dnngeness and three miles east of Point Partridge, was begun on the 28th of August, 1882~ and

finished about the middle of December. A plane of reference for the soundings was obtained by observations of tides at Port Discovery and at Port Townsend. Upon the completion of this work the vessel was laid up for the winter. In April, 1883, Lieutenant Bolles was directed to reorganize his party on board of the Earnest, and, ·as soon as the weather would permit, to proceed to Gray's Harbor, Wash. T., and to Tillamook Bay, Oreg., for the purpose of making resurYeys of the bars and as much of the harbors as might be found necessary to correct and complete the charts of those localities. These resurveys were begun at Gray's Harbor May 28, and the party was still occupied in that harbor at the close of the fiscal year. During the year ending June 30, 1883, the statistics of work reported by the commander of the Earnest are as follows: Miles run in sounding ..

Continuation of the triangulation of Hood's Canal, Puget Sound, Wash. T.-For the more economical and effective prosecution of the stu,·ey of Hood's Canal and other waters in Puget Sound, the construction of a steam ll,mnch bad been ordered. At the beginning of the fiscal year Assistant J. J. Gilbert, under orders to continue the triangulation of Hood's Canal, was at Seattle, Wash. T., acting as inspector on behalf of the United States of the work upon the launch. Early in September the steam launch, the Fuca, was iu readiness, and Assistant Gilbert, having organized his party on board of her, began the triangulation, starting from the last two stations established by Assistant Ellicott in 1881. The season, though sometimes rainy and often foggy and cloudy, was upon the whole a favorable one, and by November 3 the triangulation of the canal was completed to its head. Assistant Gilbert, in pursuance of instructions, then proceeded to Rort Townsend and marked a new station to take the place of the old astronomical station on Point Hudson, the site of which has been covered by recent improvements. The new station was referred to the old, and a description of it made. Having disbanded his party for the winter; Assistant Gilbert laid up the Fuca at Olympia, Wash. T. (she was afterward removed to Port Townsend), and left for San Francisco, where he reported for duty, as directed, to Assistant George Davidson, and was assigned to service in connection with the Transit of Venus party of observation in charge of that officer. Mr. Gilbert's work in this connection is referred to under the heading of Sections X and XVI. After the completion of this field ·duty in December, and until the close of the fiscal year, Assistant Gilbert remained attached to the party of Mr. Davidson, and was employed in office-work relating to the computation of the observations for time and longitude in connection with the Transit, and in the computations of his triangulation of Hood's Canal. He made also a computa· tion of the latitude of Mount Tamalpais from observations made by Subassistant Pratt in 1882, under Assistant Davidson's direction. All of the records and computations of the Hood's Canal work have been forwarded to the office. Following are the statistics:

of the hydrographic sun-eys in the waters of Southeastern Alaska, Heut. Commander H. E. Nichols, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, had brought the steamer Hassler, under his command, to an anchorage at the north end of Mary Island, Revillagigedo Channel, on the 6th of July, 1882. His working parties were immediately organized, astronomical obser,·ations were made, a base-line was measured on Mary Island, and the triangulation, sketching-in -of shore-line, and the hydrograpl1y begun. On August 3 the anchorage was shifted to Hassler Harbor; at this station also astronomical observations were made, and the work was carried on from here until September 27, when the anchorage was shifted to Ward Cove. The work of the survey of Uevillagigedo Channel from Foggy Point to Point Higgins was completed October G, and on that !lay the Hassler left Ward Cove for Port Wrangel, anchoring that night in ~olstoi Ba.r, which waR sketched and a few Roundings taken; the next night an anchorage was made in Steamer Bay, wliich was also sketched and sounded, and on October 8 the lfassler auchored in Port Wrangel Harbor. A plane-table survey of this harbor was made with umuerous souudings. It was Ijieuteuant~Commarnler Nichols' intention to carry this survey around I>oint Highfield in order to settle a disputed point regarding its latitude. Bad weather, however, compelled the postponement of this part of the work, and the original sheet has been retained on board till another season. · Ilaving renewed his suppl,Y of coal at Port Wrangel, Liootenant-Commander Nichols steamed t.o Port Wraugel Straits October 21, and anchored there to verify the astronomical observation of 1881; then passing through the straits he entered Portage Bay, of which he made a complete survey. Leaving Portage Bay November 6, he anchored the same night in Port Houghton, which was sketched; a few sonndiugs also were taken. Returning by way of vVraugel Straits the Hassler came t-0 anchor off Port 11\Trange! November 10. Some additions were made to the partly completed survey of that port, but the weather became too stormy for the advantageous prosecution of the work, an<l on the 20th of November Lieutenant-Commander Nichols started on his return to San Francisco, stopping at Esquimalt for astronomical observations, aud at Departure Bay for coal, an<l arriving at San Francisco December 20. During the winter the part~' of Lieutenant-Uommander Nichols was engaged in office work, and tlle steamer was under repairs. Towards the close of March, in pursuance of instructions to resume the surrny of the coast-line and inland waters of Southern Alaska, the hydrographic party on board of the Hassler was reorganized, and towards the close of Ma~r, 1883, Lieutenant-Commander Nichols had l>egun a hydrographic survey the in vicinity of Cape Fox. This survey was continued throughout the rnontli of .Tune, and will be connected with work of the previous season. A report of this and other surveys is necessarily deferred until my next annual report.

The observations for time, latitude, and azimuth were made by Mr. Fremont Morse, of the Coa.'!3t and Geodetic Survey. Acknowledgment has been made by the Alaska Salmon Packing and Fur Company, tbrongh its secretary, Mr. David Wilder, for valuable information furnished to the company by Lieut.enant· Commander Nichols, with my sanction. His examination of Naha Bay, whero the fisheries of this company are located, and his charts of that vicinity, proofs of which were flll1lished to Mr. Wilder, enabled the company to decide upon the proper point for building a new wharf at \\hich large steamers might load with safety.

Tidal observations continued, with self-registering tide-gauge, at Saint Paul, Kadiak Island, Alaska.-The self-registering tide gauge at the town of Saint P.tul, in the island of Ka. Jiak, Alaska, has made a continuous record to date. At the outset of the work, Mr. W. J. Fisher, the observer, was fully instructed by Assistants Davidson and Colonna, and through the liberality and courtesy of the Alaska Commercial Company he erected the tidal house and gauge on the company's wharf. The curves and tabulated results have been very satisfactory; the meteorological record is valuable in giving the percentage of cloudy weather, the rainfall, &c. Sketches of the localities adjacent lrn,ve been made by the observer. The work is under the direction of Assistant Davidson. The earthquake waves of the great Java earthquake were exhibited upon the tidal curve at this station, but not so markedly or distinctly as upon the record of the San Francisco gauge. Determinations o.f the force of gra1,ity, a,nd relative magnetic intensity at Point Barrow, Alaska.Reference has already been made under the heading of Section X to the co operation of the Coast and Geodetic Snn>ey with the Signal Office in the establishment of a station of the International Polar Commission at Point Barrow, Alaska, and to the observations for the determination of gravity and of relative magnetic intensity at San Francisco, Cal., made by l\Ir. R. A. l\Iarr, Acting Assistant, previous to hi8 departure for Point Barrow. Mr. Marr will transmit full reports of the obsen'ations made by him at stations en route to Point Barrow and after his arrival there. These will be the subject of mention in my next annual report. He left San Francisco June 16, 1883. Longitude of Point Barrow, Alaska.-The station of the International Polar Commission at Point Barrow was visited during the summer of 1882 by a relief expedition under the command of Lieutenant Powell, of the Signal Service. Atlrnntage was taken of thi!I trip to determine as closely as practicable the longitude of the Point Barrow Station h,v the transportation of chronometers. Observations for time, and comparisons of the four chronometers used, were made June 19, 20, and 21, 1882, by Messrs. F. Westdabl and C. B. Hill, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, at the foifayette Park Observatory in San Francisco. The ratei; were again determined hy observations at Plover Bay and at Point Barrow Oil both the outward and retnru voyages hy Lieutenant Powell, and finally by observations, October 27 and 28, on the arrival of the expedition at San Francisco. On a<:count of very unfavorable weather at the Plover Bay and Point Barrow Stations, but partial observations could be obtained; hence the determination of chronometer ratns depending on these observations was not vcty satisfactory. A discus11ion of the results by Mr. Winslow Upton, of the Signal Service, gh·ps the following longitude for the Point, Barrow Station: lOh 2Gru :~fls west of' Greenwich. This value is sul~ject to future redsion, and itR uncertainty may he greatly diminished by observations of moon culminations at Point Barrow.

Occupation of the longitud,e station at Louisville, Ky., for the determination of the wngitude of additiona.l stations in Kent·ucky by exclta,nges of f{Jlegmphic sign11ls. Observations for the latitude of these stations.-ln compliance with a request from Prof. John R. Procter, State Geologist of Kentucky, arrangements were made in l\fay, 1883, f'or the determination of a number of points in Kentucky in longitude by exchanges of telegraphic signals with the station established in 1879 at Louisville. Assistant George W. Dean was charged with the direction of the work at Louisville, and Subassistant F. H. Parsons with that at the several stations to be determined in geographical position. The observations at Louisville were made by .Mr. Dean's assistant, Carlisle Terry, jr., Aid in the Survey. Work was begun at I10uisville by observations for personal equation between Messrs. Parsons and Terry. For this purpose sixty-five stars were observed on the nights of May 8, 11, 12, aud H. Mr. Parsons then })roceeded to Lexington, Ky., and established an astronomical station in the grounds of the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College. Longitude signals were

62

exchanged with Louisville on the nights of May 24, 25, and 28, and the latitude was determined, by observing twenty-eight pairs of stars on three nights. Louisa, Lawrence County, Kentucky, at the fork of the Hig Sandy l~iver, was the next station occupied ; exchanges of longitude signals with J4ouisville were bad upon four nights hetween .June 8 and 16, and t.l1irty-four pairs of stars were observed for latitude ou fiye nights. At the 1rnxt station, Greensburg, Green County, longitude signals were exchanged with Louis· ville on the nights of ,June 22, 23, and 25, and thirty-two pairs of stars were observed for latitude on four nights. Preparations were then made by Subassistant Parsons for the occupation of a station at Jellico, '\Vhitley County, Kentuck~-, in order to <letermiue the geographical positiou of the 59th stone in the Kentucky and Tennessee boundary line. This work will be referred to in my report for the next fiscal year. Mr. J. W. G. Atkins, Acting Aid, rendered acceptable service in the party of Subassistant Parsons.

The original records and reductions of the work at Louisville and at the stations dependent upon it have been transmitted to the office. In his report, Assistant Dean acknowledges his obligations to Professor Procter for information relating to the statious, aud to Mr. Geo. VV. Trabue, General Superintendent, and Mr. James Compton, district superintendent, of the Western U niou Telegraph, for their friendly co-operatiou in extending to the astronomical parties every facility in their power. Reconnaissance for the extension of the triangulation of the State of Kentucky.-In July, 1882, a reconnaissance for the extension of the triangulation of the State of Kentucky was begun by Mr. Carl Schenk, Acting Assistant. His explorations were confined to that pa.rt of the State lying to tile south and west of Frankfort, between the Ohio and Salt Ri\rers. Mr. Schenk has submitted a report of his reconnaissauce, with a sketch showing the intervisible stations developed by it, and steps will be taken at the earliest date practicable to resume the triangulation.

Occupation of stations in continuation of the triangulation of the State of Tennessee.-Field-work
for the extension of the triangulation of the t5tate of Tennessee was begun by Prof. A. H. Buchanan, Acting Assistant, in July, 1882, by the occupation of station Apple, between the Cumberland River and the Chaney Fork of that river. Previous to the occupation of Apple, the signal at Hall Station, which had been destroyed by lightning, was rebuilt. Observations at station Apple were closed early in August, and the party transferred to Chestnut Mountain, about thirteen ,miles to the eastward of the town of Sparta, in White County. 'fhis station had been previously occupied; its reoccupation was found necessary in order to get observations upon station Walker for the better development of the scheme of triangulation. To see the signal at Waiker a cutting of three and a half miles had to be made. Early in September observations upon Walker were finished aud work begun at Mount Lore Station, about eight miles to the westward of Sparta. AU of the horizontal and vertical augles needed at Mount Lore having been obtained by October 1, the party was transferred to Walker Station October 5. With the completion of work at this station, Octouer 24, field operations closed for the season. The occupation of Walker finished work at all of the primary stations in the system of trian· gulation west of the Orab Orchard range of mountains on the eastern edge of the Cumberland Mountain table-land, and connecting the cities of Nashville and Knoxville. In June, 1883, field-work was resumed by the erection of signals in continuation of the State

Reeonnaissanee for the primary triangulation nea.r Uie thirt,11-11inth parallel extended .frorn West rirginia into OJiio.-An acconnt has alread~· been gfre11 under tbe heading of Sectiou III of' this report of the reconnaissance executed by Assistant A. 'I'. 1\losman dnri11g the autumn a11d part of the winter of 1882 for the extension of the primary triangulation along or near the thirty ninth parallel from West Virginia westward into Ohio and Kentucky._ The stations selected in Ohio were ·wray, about three miles east of Marion, Marion County; .Newcastle, three miles to the northward of Ironton, l1awreuce County; Gould, two miles north of Haverhill, Scioto County; and Scioto, about three miles northwest of Portsmouth, Scioto County. Some of these stations were provisionally located; their final incorporation in the scheme will be determined during the next seaso11. Ooeupation of stations in continuation of the tria11g11lation of the State of Ohio.-The triangulation of the State of Ohio was advanced from Athens towards Columbus in July, August, and Septem ber, 1882, by Prof. R S. Devol, Acting Assistant. As mentioned in my report of last year, obserYatious at Brooks Station, about thirteen miles northwest of Athens, had been partly completed when the season closed. Between the middle of ,July and the middle of August, 1882, Brooks Station was re-occupied by Professor Devol. Upon the completion of observations at that point the party was transferred to McDaniel Station, thirteen miles westward from Athens, and the weather being favorable, the work at this station was finished September 9. The barometric observations begun last year for obtaining the comparative heights of the triangulation points were continued during the season; daily rea1lings of two aneroids bei11g taken at Brooks and McDaniel Stations. The number of angular measurements at these two stations was one thousand and eighty.five. Hecords of the observations have been forwarded to the office. Reconnaissance for the extension of the triangulation of the State of Indiana.-Prof. J. L. Campbell, Acting· Assistant, who had been temporarily relieved frolll the charge of the triangulation of the State of Indiana, in order to assume the direction of works undertaken for the reclamation of the swamp lands of the State, spent parts of the winter and spring of 1882-'83 in a reconnaissance iu Clark and Floyd Counties with a view to the expected resumption of geodesic operations in the State at the earliest date practicable in the fiscal year 1883-'84. The result of his reconnaissance will tend to the enlargement and improvement of the scheme of triangulation. Determinations of tlie latitude and longit1tde of stations in Indiana and lllinois.-A full statement will be made under the heading of Section XV, iu the a-0count of the occupation of the station at Saint Louis, Mo., of the exchanges of longitude signals between that station and the stations established in November and December, 1882, at Springfield, Ill., and Indianapolis, Ind. Also, of the observations made for latitude at these points. Transcontinental line of geodesic levelfog exfmtdcd from ,ffitelwll, Ind., to Saint Louis, Mo., and thence westirard to Etlali, Mo.-At the beginuing of the fiscal year, Assistant Andrew Braid bad rniarly completed the line of leveling of precision from Vincennes, Ind., to Mitchell, Ind., the terminal point of the season of 1879. The several sections of this line from the sea-level to Mitchell are:

UNITED ST.ATES COAST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

II. From Hagerstown, l\id., to Grafton, W. Va. III. From Grafton, W. Va., to Athens, Ohio. IV. From Athens, Ohio, to Mitd1el1, Ind. Upon reaching the town of Mitchell, primary bench-mark X was cut on the sill of a window of M. N. Moore, as full.r described in the record, and the Iiue was started for Saint Louis, following the track of the Ohio aud Mississippi Hailroad. Section V, from MitchPll, Ind., to Saint Louis, was run iiccording to the method described in deta,il by Mr. Braid in Appendix No. 11 to the Report for 1880. It is the same as that emplo~'cd in the sections preYiously run, two· simultaneous lines being carried in the same direction with the. rods at different distances from the instrument, and alternat.e sections of the line being run. in opposite directions to neutralize any tendency to cunmlatin~ error dne to direction. . .At Caseyville, Saint Olair County, Ill., a brauelt line or ofli;et was run to connect with the north end of the "American Bottom Base," and a bench-mark was established on the head of the copper bolt in the north base monument. Upon reaching East Saint J,ouis, arrangements were made for carrying the line of levelis across the Mississippi Hiver on the Saint Louis bridge by three independent methods. For this purpose two instruments an<l two observers were needed, and· Subassistant J. B. Weir was directed to report to .Assistant Braid. The 1i1etl10ds employed were: 1. Leveling over tlw top of the bridge ; 2. Simultaneous sig11ts across the river by two observers stationed on opposite banks; and, 3. Water·level observations. The results deduced were based entirely upon the two methods first named, and the agreement of the separate results is quite satisfactory. At Saint Louis Mr. Braid connected with the bench-mark known as the "City Directrix," and established two duplicates of it, in elevation, on the cast and west land-piers of the "Great Jkitlgc." These bench-marks are bronze plates an inch thick, and with a surface of eight by twelve inches, set into the granite on the south faces of the east and west piers, respectively, and secured by cement and screw-bolts. Appendix No. 11, Coast and Geodetic Survey Ueport for 1882, gives descriptions of these and all other bench-marks established ou the line between Sandy Hook and Saint Louis, with a statement of the results of the leveling as made out by Assistant Charles A.. Schott. Jlefore closing field operations in December, .Assistant Braid continued the work westwartl to Etlah, Franklin County, Missourj, about seventy-five miles from Saint Louis. In March, 1883, Assistant Braid was directed to report for duty to R. D. Cutts, Assistant in charge of the office and topography. Continuation to tke ea.stward of the primary triangulation in Illinois near the thirty-ninth parallel.-The primary triangulation iu the State of Illinois along or near the thirty-ninth par.i.llel, which forms part of the geodetic connection between the Atlantic and Pacific coast work, was advanced to the eastward in 1882 by .Assistant George A. Fairfield. Arrangements·were made early in the fiscal year for the occupation of Hoile Station, near the town of Greenville, Bond County. Before the arrival of Mr. Fairfield, August 7, the observations at Hoile were made by Subassistant J.B. Weir. Signals being needed at Hartlin, Bording, and other stations, a signal· building party was organized and kept constantly occupied till about the middle of October. .All of the observations of horizontal directions at Hoile and the other stations occupied were made by night upon the lights shown by the student lamps, the atmosphere by day being too smoky to admit of .satisfactory work. Hoile Station was finished September 3, and the party was transferred -to Bording Station, near the town of Carlyle, Clinton County. At Bording, observations were made for horizontal directions, and for time, latitude, and azimuth. .All work at this station was completed November 14; and Mr. Fair.field immediately moved bis camp to Hartlin Station, about six miles north of the town of Salem, Marion County. The occupation of this station finished field-work for the season, which closed December 3. At that date all of the horizontal directions required had been observed. Extremely cold weather was encountered while at Hartlin. On the night of December 2 Mr. Fairfield observed for six hours while the mercury stood at mo above zero (Fahr.). On the 6th of December, the day of the Transit of Venus, the sky was entirely overcast, and the weather oom· paratively mild until about 4 p. m., when the mercury began to fall very rapidly, the wind blowing

a gale from the northwest. On the 7th the thermometer during the whole day did not rise higher than 20 below zero, and at 10 p. m. it marked 150 below. This severe cold delayed packing, so that it was not till the 13th of December that the tents were stored. Mr. Fairfield reports four quite perceptible shocks of earthquake during the season: one on September 27, two on October 14, and one on November 14. None of the.m occurred while he was observing, and no damage was done to any of the high signals. While field operations were in progress, Subassistant Weir connected Hoile Station with a bench-mark of the transcontinental line of geodesic ltweling on the Vandalia Railroad track at the depot in Greenville. He connected also in the same manner (by a line of levels) the station at Bording with the bench-mark established on the east pier of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad bridge across the Kaskaskia River, near the town of Carlyle.

During the wint:er Mr. Fairfield was occupied in completing the records and computations of his season's work. All of these have been transmitted to the office. In the spring of 1883 he recefred instructions to prepare for the resumption of field-work, and at the date at which this report closes had advanced the triangulation in Illinois eastward by the occupation of both primary and secondary stations. In this duty be was assisted by Isaac Winston, Aid, and James S. Harper, recorder. A statement of the progress of this work will be given in my next annual report. Occupati01i of stations in contimtation of the triaiigulation of the State of lVisconsin.-The triangulation of the State of Wisconsin was resumed in July, 1882, by Prof. John E. Davies, Acting Assistant. One of the principal objects of the season's work was a determination of the geograph· ical positions of the Beloit Astronomical Observatory and of one or more of the monuments marking the boundary line between Wisconsin and Illinois. Finding that the Beloit Observatory was not visible from any one of the surrounding primary stations, owing to its location in the Rock River Valley, it was decided, after conference with Professor Smith, Director of the Observatory, to determine by careful observation the position of the spire of the Congregational Church, which is a conspicuous object from several primary stations, and to refer this by measurement to the observatory. This work was successfull1 accomplished. Two of the monuments remaining upon the State line were also determined in position. An examination of the notes of the original survey of this important boundary line, on file in the State land-office at Madison, Wis., was made by Professor Davies. 'fl]e results of his geodetic work in the vicinity of the boundary line show discrepancies, amounting in some cases to from one-half to three-quarters of a mile, between the line as actually marked out and the parallel of 42° 30', whfoh is prescribed as the boundary line by the constitutions of the two States. Additional stations on and near the boundary will have to be occupied to determine its actual position. It has been ascertained that a copy of the original report of survey of the line made by the United States OommiBSioner to the President of the United States January 29, 1833, is on file in the General Land Office. The stations occupied by Professor Davies were Janesville, near the town of that name, in Rock County; Plymouth, in Sheboygan County; Wohlford, near Beloit (a subsidiary station); Harmony, about five miles east of Janesville, and Bald Blu:lf, in Palmyra, Jetferson County, Wiss.

Occttpation qt'the lon,qitude station in Saint Loui.~, Mo., for the determ·ination of the lon,qitudes of points in Arkansas, J11issouri, Nebraska, llent1wky, Indiana, and Illinois by exchanges of telegraph-iv signals. Determination.~ of the latitudes of these points.-The scheme of longitude operations adopted for the autumn and part of the winter of 1882 involved the assignment of .Assistant George W. Dean to the charge of the station at Saiut Louis and to the geueral direction of the work depend. ing upon it; the assignment of Snbassistant C. H. Sinclair to the charge of the corresponding pa.rt~y for primary work, and the detail of Subassistant F. H. Parsons to the charge of a secoudar.r party. Carli8le Terry,jr., Aid, on dnt;y with tbe party of Assistant Dean, made the observations at the Saint Louis station and exchanged places during the season with Subassistant Sinclair. Messrs. Dean and Terry completell all preparations needed at the Saint Louis station soon after the middle of September. Kansas City wa,s the first of the primary stations to be determined. Subassistant Sinclair was in readiness there for exchange of signals with Saint Louis by Septem· her 15. He had obtained permission of the superintendent of the Board of Education to establish his station in the grounds of the l~ranklin public schooJ. Unfavorable weather delayed observations for a few days. On the nigh ti;, of September 21, 23, 26, aud 29, longitude signals were trans. mitted to and from Saint I,ouis; aftl\r which, in order to eliminate personal equation, the observers changed places, and longitnde. 8ignals were exchanged iu their new positions on the nights of October 3, 5, 6, 11, and 13. For the latitude of the Kansas Oity station, Snbassistaut Sinclair made sixty-five observations upon fourteen pairs of stars 011 six uights. Between Saint Louis and the station, firl3t occupied by the secondary party in charge of Sub· assistant Parsons at London, Ky., signals for longitude were exchanged on the nights of Sep· tember 23, October 4 and 5, and between Saint Louis and the next secondary station, Guthrie, Ky., on the nights of October 13, 14, and 15. Determinations of the latitude of these two stations were made by Mr. Parsons. Upon the completion of the primary work betweeu Saint Louis and Kansas City, the party at the latter station, under the immediate charge of Mr. Terry, moved to Omaha, Nebr., to exchange signals with Safut Louis. The stone block put down by Assistant Edward Goodfellow to mark tbe position of the astronomical station established at Omaha in 1868-'69 bad been destroyed dur· ing the grading of the grounds in 1875, lmt the lower stone of the north meridian mark, fixed in 1869, was undisturbed, an<l Ly measuremeut back from this mark the center of transit was established almost exactly in tbe same position a8 that of 1868-'69. The exchange of longitude signals with Saint Louis began October 20, and by October 27 five nights had been obtain<l, whereupon the observers changed places and five more exchanges were had between November 6 and Novem·

oor 21.

The party at Saint Louis exchanged longitude signals with Mr. Parsons at Henderson, Ky., on the nights of October 20, 21, and 23, and with toe same observer at Little Bock, Ark., on the nights of November 6, 7, and 10. I>eterminations of the latitude of thes~ two stations were ma.de by Mr. Parsons. Upou his removal to the next station, Springfteld, Ill., he exchanged signals

upon the nights of November 20 and 21 with Saint Louis, and on No,'emlH\r 23 with the party at Omaha. It was deemed advisable to include the line Kam;as City-Omaha as a check determination, this being the third side of the longitude triangle Saint Louis-K:mRas City-Omaha. Arrangements· ha Ying been made for this work by Assistant Dean, .Mr. Terry proeeeded to Kansas City with tlte astro110111ical iustrmneuts aud telegraphic apparatus which had been in use at Saint Louis. The flrnt exchange of signals for longitude between Kansas City arnl Omaha was had on the 26th of N0Ye111ber. Assistant Dean ba\·ing been relieved from duty at his own request, Mr. Terry was placed in charge of one of the longitude parties upon his recommendation, and co11tinned the work in co-operation with .M:r. Sinclair. Between November 2!J aud De<'emher 2 fonr more mgllt exchanges \"ere liad. The observers then chimged places, and the final exchauges of the season at the · primaQ· i;tatio.ns were obtained between December 10 and January I. Extremely cold weather at Omaha made the work one of much hardship and exposure. For the longitude of Indianapolis, the last secondary station occupied b~· l\Ir. Parsons, signals \\"Cle exchanged with Mr. Terry at Kansas Cit;y ou three nights, closing December 2. Ol>serva· tious for the latitu<le of the Indianapolis station were niade also. "\Vith reference to the instruments and methods emplo~·ed at tl1e primary stations, Assistant Dean remarks that the new diagonal c.re-pieces, h~wing a magmf~·ing power of about ninety five, which had been applied to transits Nos. 4 and n, Wf\re more satisfactorJ· to the obser,·ers than tl1e eye-pieces of higher power used during the JH'f'Yious season. All of the stars which were to be obsern'd for determining time were selected from the American Bpheuwris and from the Berlin Star Catnlogne, particular care being taken to arrange t·ach group, coni,;istiug of one circumpolar and four time stars, so that the corrections depending upon the north and south zenith distances should be as 11early equal as possible: Whenevn the weather permitted, two groups of five stars were observed at each station (one with transit lamp east, the other west) before exchanging longitude signals. These signals were immediate!~· fo1lowed by obserYing two similar groups, which com-. pleted the work for the night. The itrrangemeuts made with the telegraph companies rendered it advisable to limit the time of occupation of the lines to not more than five or ten minutes each night. The clock signals were tlierefore abandoned, and only arbitrary signals \Vere exchanged: .Assistant Dean hits submitted with his report an a.bstract of results for difference oflongitude lH~tweeu the primary stations. He ack1wwledges the cordial co-operation of Subassistants Sinclair and Parsons and of Mr. Terry in the work of the season. 'l'hP original and duplicate records and computations have been.deposited in the office. Continuation to tlte 1.oestward of tlte primary triangulation in .Missouri near tlie thirty-ninth parallel.-Instructions issued to Assistant F. D. Granger, in July, 1882, directed llim to proceed to Se1la1ia, Mo., and organize a party to take the field for the continuation of the triangulation westward from that vicinity, in accordance with the scheme developed hy his reconnaissance of the preceding season. The extreme violence of the storms which prevail in this section of the couutr~- made it desira· hle. to amid building very high trip~ds at the stations to be occupied, two of those alrcad;y built having been destroyed. An interior poiut, "Kendrick," was therefore selected in the quadrilateral lleard-Schnackenberg-Righ Point Tebo-Knobnoster (sec sketch No. 22), and signals of twentylh-e feet in height, were put up at" Kendrick," and" Kuobnoster." At the three stations first named, observing tripods and scaffolds fifty feet in height were erected. At" Caldwell," one of forty feet wa,s put up, and.at "Warrensburg" (both stations in the next quadrilateral westward) a pole was placed upon top of the large chimney of the Normal School building. Observations were begun by the re-occupation of "Heard" for determinations of the primary directions to Schnackenberg, Kendrick, aml Kuobnost,er. This stat.ion being completed Septem· bcr 1, the camp equipage and instruments were then forwarded.to" Sclmackenherg." At this station five primary directions were determined. Upon its completion, "Keudrick ''was occupied, observations being begun September 26, and finished October 4, wlien the party was transferred to "High Point Tebo." Observations upon five primary and four tertiary voiutrs lw.Ying been completed at

this station October 20, "Knobnoster" was next occupied. By November 15, field operations were closed, observations having been obtained upon five primary, two secondary, and three tertiary points. Mr. J.E. McGrath, Aid, and Mr. J. A. Johnson, Acting Aid, served iu the party. During the winter and part of the spring of 1882-'83 Assistant Granger was ou duty with the party of Assistant Henry Mitchell, at Boston, Mass. In May, 1883, in accordance with instructions, be re-organized his party in Missouri for continuing the primary triangulation to the westward. Tripod and scaffold signals were erected in advance of the stations to be first occupied, and by the 15th of June all was in readiness for the occupation of station "Normal." The point selected for this station, with the permission of the regents of the school, was the top of the chimney of the Missouri State Normal School building, at Warrensburg. This chimney being nearly ninety feet high, and capped with heavy blocks of sandstone, offered an excellent substitute for the ordinary . observing tripod. 'l'o the regents and to the principal of the School, Professor Osborne, Mr. Granger expresses his acknowledgments for kimlly interest and courtesies. Observations at "Normal" were nearly completed at the close of the fiscal year. The progress of this work will be referred to in my next annual report.

Primary triang11lation in Nevada and Utah, near the tldrty-ninth parallel, extended eastward.-In
July, 1882, Assistant William :Eimbeck was instructed to visit Mount Nebo and Beaver Mountain, in Utah, and to examine the country from these stations with a view of extending to the eastward the primary triangulation across tlle Wahsatch Mountains. Upon the completion of this duty he was directed to occupy Jeff. Davis Peak, near the thirty-ninth parallel, about fifteen miles to the west of the eastern boundary of Nevada. In pursuance of this dut.y Mr. Eimbeck reached Salt Lake City, Utah, early in August, and at once occupied himself with the preparations needed for the reconnaissance from the summits of Mounts Nebo and Beaver, and for the posting of heliotropers upon these elevated summits. Having accomplished this duty, Mr. Eimbeck organized l1is party for the occupation of Jefl: Davis Peak, a mountain st.ation thirteen thousand one hundred feet in height. Arrangements were made for the transportation of camp outfit and instruments to Lehman's Ranch, in Snake Valley, near the uortheastern base of the mountain. Mr. Eimbeck arrived at t.his ranch on the 22d of September, aud, having explored the mountain for the best location of a trail to the top, established two camps: the first at an altitude of seven tbousaud eight hundred feet, distant about seven miles from the summit; the second about two miles below the summit and at an altitude of eleven thousand feet. The trail having been opened and instruments and camp outfit pa.eked to the top of the peak, hello· troping parties were dispatched to Gosi-ute, Pioche, and White Pine Stations. The work a.t Jeft'. Davis Peak involved the determination of horizontal directions from that station to fl.ve other limiting points of a great hexagon, the longest side of which was the line Jeff. Davis Peak-Mount Nebo, one hundred and fifty miles, and the shortest, Jeff. Davis Peak-Gosi-ut.e, sixty-three mile&

Preparations for observing were delayed by violent storms. On the morning of October 5, after one of these storms, the mercury fell to thirteen degrees above zero, and the suow at camp was a foot deep. The work was pushed, however, at every opportunity of favorable weather, and by November 23 the observations for horizontalCdirections and for the magnetic elements had been completed. A few days more sufficed to obtain all needful obS'ervations for double zenith distances. During November the lowest temperature recorded was twenty degrees below zero (Fahr.). Field operations were closed and the party disbanded early in December. While at Lehman's Ranch, successful observations of the Transit of Venus were~obtained by Mr. Eimbeck. For details see Appendix No. 16. Assistant Eimbeck was efficiently aided throughout the season by Acting Assistant R. A. Marr. During the following winter and spring Mr. ijimbeck was engaged in completing tlie records and results of his field.work. In April, 1883, he was instructed to extend the reconnaissance to the eastward of the line Mount Nebo-Beaver by occupying such points as would determine definitely the most advantageous figure for continuing the main triangulation across the Wahsatch Mountains. A change in the position of station "Beaver" for the proper development of this figure appearing unavoidable from previous examinations, he_was authorized to establish a new station upon one of the neigh boring peaks, so located as not to affect the essential geometrical conditions of the great hexagon, and to refer the observed direction Jeff. Davis-Beaver to the new station by the re-occn· pation of Jeff. Davis Peak. Assistant Eimbeck reached Salt Lake City in June, and at tl1e date at which this report closes was actively engaged in the prosecution of the reconnaissance. Reeonna,issanee for the extension ea.stwa.rd of the primary triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel in Oolorado.-In August, 1882, Assistant F. W. Perkins waA directed t-0 organize a party for the continuation to the eastward of the primary triangulation near the thirt.;r·ninth parallel in Colorado and Kansas. Starting from the line Landsman-First View, which marked the terminal points reached in 1881, Mr. Perkins established movable camps at points on the line of the Kansas Pacific Railroad where water could be obtained, and from these campA sent out exploring parties in different directions, with the lightest possible equipment, officers and men sleeping upon the ground without shelter, other than their blankets and buffalo robes, until the latter part of the season. About twenty-seven miles to the eastward of the starting-points, the boundary line between Colorado and Kansas was crossed. The scheme of triangulation de,·eloped by the reconnaissance involves a series of triangle sides extending on both sides of the Kansas Pacific Railroad from the line Landsman-First View to the line Teeter's Hill-Sheridan, about thirty-five miles to th(i eastward of the Kansas-Colorado boundary. Beyond this line the railroad passes to the north of the thirty. ninth parallel, and the triangulation is developed south of that pa.rallel to the liue Walters HouseSchmidt's House, about two and a half degrees of longitude to the eastward of the points of departure. The reconnaissance was closed early iu Novem her, fourteen primary and nine secondary points having been selected. With reference to the character of the country over which bis work extended, Mr. Perkins remarks that it is a plain, destitute of timber, slightly undulating, and deeply seamed by the streams, which, though dry during the greater portion of the year, have cut deep and wide bottoms, with walls generally rising at a sharp angle to the level of the plain. Owing to the strong winds which sweep over these plains, it is not practicable to use high observing tripods, and in cases where the instrument ha.s of necessity to be mounted even a few feet above the ground, very heavy timber should be used in constructing the tripods. Mr. Perkins refers in his report to the difficulty of recovering triangulation points in a country practically uninhabited, and almost entirely destitute of well.marked natural objects, and recommends special care in marking the stations, and their careful reference ~ the corners of the land sections, thus making it the interest of every settler to preserve them. His suggestions as to the details of marking are of much p~tical value. Mr. George F. Bird served as Aid in the party; Mr. J. J ..Fatzinger as recorder, both in a manner highly sati6faetory to their chief.

Duty assigned to Assistant Perkins during the succeeding winter is referred to under the heading of Section VIII. Ob11ervation~ of the Transit of Venus at Cerro Roblero, near Fort Selden, N. Jlfex.-ln July 1882, .Assistant George Davidson, then on special duty in Washington, was appointed by the Transit of Veum; Commission chief astrouom'er of a party to be organized for the obsen·ation of the rransit at a station in New .Mexico. The meteorological conditions were more likely to be favorable in the interior of the continent, and .Assistant Davidso11's experience in observing in high altitudes suggested a station embracing these conditions. Upon his return to the Pacific coast he traveled. by the southern route to stml.r the best location for a station at a great elevation where all four co11tacts could be successfull,v observed. After a careful persounl examination of the couytry as far south as the latitude of the highest peaks of the Organ ::\fountains, l\Ir. Davidson selectecl as the most available station the summit, of Uerro Hoblero, an isolated mountain mass rising abruptly to a height of nearl.Y seventeen hurnlred foet from the right bank of the Rio Grande del Norte, and. about four miles from Fort Selden, N. Mex. Authority for military assistance at Fort Seld.eu having been obtained from General Mackenzie, m'ery support and addce was rendered by Major Bascom, commanding that post at tlle time of Mr. DaYidson's reconnaissance, and subsequently during tile occupation of tile stati,on by Lieutenant Uhance, who succeeded l\Iajor Bascom in command. Ifaviug orgauized his partj" by the selection of Assistant James S. Lawson and Subassistant John F. Pratt as assistant astronomers, and accompanied by Messrs. D. C. Ubapman 'and T. S. Tappan as photogmpht·m, Assistant Davidson arri,·ed at Fort Selden early in November. Instruments, lumber, camp outfit, autl all supplies for the observers and men having to be packed on. mules to the summit of Cerro H.oblero, over a rough mountain trail, extraordinary efforts were required to have all the instruments in position before the day of the Transit. All preparations were completell, however, ou the 5th of December, and a programme of operations had been matured for the uext day. Special care had been taken to obtain satisfactory adjustments for the horizontal pliotoheliograph, a method of ohservation which in the opinion of the Commission offered as much accuracy as that of ohservi11g contacts, and presented many more chances of success. The atmospheric c011<litions had been gradually becoming more favorable during the first few days in December, and 011 tlw tith the air was clear and all outlines sharply defined. About six minutes before first contact the sun appeared above the crest of the Organ Mountains, and, although at this time the atmosphere wa.<i slightly disturbed near those crests, a good observation was obtainecl, and d.nring the rest of the Transit the steadiness aucl sharpness of the limbs of the plauet and sun were improving. All four contacts were observed by Assistant Davidson with the five-inch Clark equatorial, No. 802; the first aud second contacts were observed by Mr. Lawson, and the third and fourt11 contacts by Mr. Pratt with the Coast and Geodetic Survey Hassler equatorial, of three inches aper· tnre. The systematic exposure of two hundred and sixteen plates resulted in very superior photograpbs, every one of which was available for measurement. .Assistant DaYidson has submitted an elaborate report of the observation of the Transit, including a statement of the subsequent operations for determining t11e latitude and longitude of the station, and accompanied by views, drawings, and photographs.

SPECIAL OP.ERATIONS. Observations of the Tmnsit of Venus at Auckland, New Zealand. Also, df1tcrminations of the Force of Gravity at tile Transit of Venus Station and at stations in New South Wales, British India, and Japan.-In Part I of this report, reference was made to the town of Aucklamt New Zealand, as
one of the stations selected by the Transit of Venus Commission for the olJservation of the Transit. Assistant Edwin Smith having been appointed to take charge of the expedition to New Zealand, reported for that duty August 7. Prof. H. S. Prichett, of the Washington University, Saint Louis, Mo., was attached to the party as assistant astronomer, and Messrs. Augustus StoQ' and Gustave Thielkuhl as photographers. Leaving San Francisco September _19, the expedition arrived at Auckland October 15. With the permission of the authorities of the city of Auckland, Mr. Smith established his station on a reservation known as "The Domain," in the eastern portion of the city. Its geographical position

was determined by the assistant surveyor-general, Mr. Percy Smith, who connected it with the New Zealand Trigonometrical Survey. His results were, approximately: latitude 360 51' 55" south, longitude 1740 46' 47" east of Greenwich. The height of the ground at the observing pier was found to be two hundred and sixty-two feet above high water. While preparations for the Transit were in active progress, the latitude was obtained directly by observations upon eleven pairs of stars, and the longitude by exchanges of telegraphic signals with an English party of observation at Burnham, this party having exchanged signals with the observatory at Sydney, New South Wales. On the day of the Transit the weather was clear at intervals only, and success but partial. The son rose in clouds; these partly dispersed as Venus advanced on the sun's disk, and seventyfour negatives were secured with the horizontal photoheliograph; but at no time during the Transit was the sun free from clouds, and all of the photographs show their presence. A few moments before third contact the clouds became quite thin, and both third and fourth contacts were observed by Messrs. Smith and Prichett with their equatorial telescopes. A full report of the obserrntions has been prepared for transmission to the president of the Transit of Venus Commission. Mr. Smith bas also prepared a report of the determinations of the force of gravity at Auckland with the three Kater invariable pendulums. These pendulums were swung continuously from Novenber 27 to December 4, inclusive, in a small brick building known as the "Block House," near the Transit of Venus Station. Leaving Auckland towards the close of December, 1882, Messrs. Smith and Prichett arrived at Sydney, New South \Vales 7 January 2, 1883. Every facility for pendulum work was afforded t.o the party by the kiudness of H. C. Russell, esq., Director of the Sydney Observatory. The pendulums were swung in the cellar of the observatory under the transit room from January 5 to January 11, inclusive. The conditions of obsen'ation were exceedingly favorable, the room being dry and the changes of temperature during the experiments not exceeding three degrees Fahrenheit. From Sydney Mr. Smith proceeded, by way of Brisbane, Australia, and Batavia, Java, to Singapore, Straits Settlements, British India. Permission was granted by the governor of the Straits Settlements to swing the pendulums at the European Hospital. The station was established in the laboratory of the hospital, where the pendulums were swung continuously from March 2 to March 7 inclusive. Acknowledgment is made by Mr. Smith of the hospitable attentfons received from_ Dr. Simon, in charge of the hospital, and for liberal assistance rendered by Captain McCallnm, R. E., in charge of the office of the Colonial Engineers. At the request of this officer a meridian line was established for the use of the Colonial Survey. Proceeding thence to Hong-Kong, China, en route to Yokohama and Tokio, Japan, President Kato, of the University of Tokio, oflered every facility for the observations, ancl caused a stone pier to be erected for the apparatus in a new fire.proof building but a short distance from the physical laboratory. A continuous series of observations was lilecured from April 24 to May 1 inclusive. Professor Paul, of the Tokio University, took g_reat interest in the success of the work, and rendered personal assistance and hospitality to the observers. Leaving Tokio May 15 the party arrived at San Francisco May 31, and, as already mentioned under the heading of Section X, made a series of gravity determinations at the station selected there by Assistant Davidson. To complete the series it is intended to swing these pendulums at the Smithsonian Institution, where they had previously been swung by Lieutenant-Colonel Herschel, Royal Engineers.

Observations in coniiectwn with tlwse made at Caroline Island, South Pacific Ocean, of the Total Eclipse·of the Sun, lrlay 6, 1883. Also determinations of tlw Foroo of Gravity at the Eclipse station, and at stations in the Sandwich Islands, and in San Fra'IWisco.-The special expedition organized for the
observation of the Total Solar Eclipse at Caroline Island in the South Pacific, mention of which was made iu Part I of this report, was plaood in charge of Prof. Edward S. Holden, Director of the Washburn Observatory. Mr. E. D. Preston, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was ordered t-0 report to Professor Holden as a member of the expedition. The United States ship Hartford conveyed the party to Caroline Island, arriving there on \he 20th of April. Preparations for the work were at once begun, each observer having had a special duty allotted to him by Professor Holden. To Mr. Preston were assigned the determinations of time for the

eclipse, observations for latitude by the method of equal zenith distances, and tbe observation of the four contacts. As girnn approximately by the field computations, the geogmphical position of the station was found to be: Latitude 10° 00' 01" south; longitude IOti oom 56· west of Greenwich. The longitude is from the observations of Mr. Winslow Upton, of the Signal Sen·icP, who was a inember of the party. · On the day of the eclipse the weather was clear <luring totality, except a slight haze for a minute or two at oegiuning. All four· contacts were ob11erved by Mr. Preston, using a small telescope of about two and a half inches aperture and three feet in focal length, with a magnif~·ing powpr of about 115. Heferring to the aPJwarance of tlie first ray of sunlight after the darkness of the long totality, :\Ir. Preston remarlrn that it was like a flash of tlie electric light as contrasted with the iutense color of the ebromosphere on the western edge of the moon for the few seconds preceding third contact. In addition to the obseryations pertaining to the eclipse, Mr. Preston was chargi·d, 011 behalf of the Uoa8t and Gt>o,letic Sur,'ey, with determinations of gravity at Uaroliue Island, and at statio11s in the Sa11dwich IslandR on his homeward vo,yage. For this 1mrposP, pPndulnm No. 3 was 8Wm1g- OB eight nig"l1t:s at the Eclipse station. On the 9th of Ma;r, Mr. Pre:ston left the Caroli11e · lsla111ls for IJ011olnlu on hoard the Hartford, and upon his arrival recein·d instructions to 11etPrmine the forc1· of gnwits at the station ou the island of Maui, occupied hy De Frciyciuet in 1Sl9. At this station (Lahaina) the pendulum was swung on ten nights, and the latitmfo detnmined hy 011e hundred and fourtee11 ohiml'\'ations on thirty-five pairs of stars. A second station was occupied at Honolulu (Oahu) where the pendulum was swung during three co11secutive da~·s a11d nighb"I, aud a limited numl)('r of obsern1tions for latitude were obtained, but little time being available before the departure of the steamer for San Fral1cisco. Upon rPachiug San Francisco July 9, comparatfre determinations of gravity were begun at the station established there hy Assistant Davidson. Mr. 0. B. Hill, of :\Ir. Davidson's party, was assigned to aid Mr. Preston in his observations. The work was prosecuted between July 15 and 27, with many interruption_s from unfaYorable weather. Mr Preston acknowledges the efficient assistance of Ensign S. J. Brown, U.S. N., in the work at the Caroline and Samlwieh Islands, and expresses his obll.gations for mauy kind attentions rt~cefred from Mr. H. Turton. of Labai11a; from W. D. Alexander, esq., Superintendent of the Hawaiian Gonirnment survey, and from the Goveruor of Oahu. An abstract of the report of Mr. Preston appears as Appendix: No. 17. Tidal obseri·ations at Honolulu, &andwich Island.~.-In oriler to obtain a record of the Sandwich Island tides for comparison with the tides of the Pacific coast, a self registering ti1le-gange, loaned by the Coast Survey to the Superintendent of the Hawaiian Government survey, bas ueeu kept in operation under the clirectio11 of that officer since June, 1877. Uecor<ls from this tide·gange are sent from time to time to this office, the latest received bringing up the series to near the cl mm ot' July, 1882. In connection with the tidal records from ~he self·registering gauges 011 San Francisco Bay and at Kadiak Island, Alaska, this series will have a special value.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE.
It will appear from the report of Assistant Richard D. Outts, in charge of the Office and 'l'opograpby (Appendix: No. 4), that all of the material received from the field bas been put rapidly int-0 shape for record and publication. Consideration has been given and experiments made with a view to the introduction of improvements in methods an<l processes. The demands upon the office for the charts and other publications of the Survey are increasing year by year, as also are applicatious for special information, transcripts from original surveys, &c., from persons not con· nected with the work. A tabular statement of information furnished is given in Appendix No. 3. To the report of Assistant Cutts are appended the reports of the chiefs of the sernral office divisions. Accompanying these are tables giving the titles of the charts aIHl engraved plates begun, completed, and continued during the year i also a list of the publications of the Survey received from the Government Printer and an account of their distribution.

U~ITED

STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Assistant Cutts refers to the eollectio11s of geographical data in the office which are now available for tlie cons1ruetion of a map of the l'nited States, and suggests that, under the authority of Congress, steps be taken toward tlrn <~onstruction of such a map, based upon a scientific framework and executed upon an appropriate scale. This suggestiou meets with my cordial approval. The progress made iu the prepai ation for publieatio11 of the third Yolume of the Atlautic Coast Pilot (Dh'isio11 C), inelnding the coast from New York to the Chesapeake, has been alread_y referrPrl to in Part II of this report, under the heading of Section II. Numerous additions have been made to onr knowlerlge of Southeastern Alaska since 1879; it lias bePn 11t>cessary therefore to reYise portions of the text of the ma1111Rcript of tlie Coast Pilot of Alaska and to make a<lditions or corrections to the charts in order to bring them up to date. ARsistant '''- H. Dall has been e11gaged in this work <luriug the past fiRcal year, his knowle<lge of that coast acquired by liis own long service tlwre making him peculiarly fitted for it. The manuscript is now in the liarnls of 1he printer. It relates to or describes about 8,800 miles of shore-line. 'Jlle collection of material has compelled frequent reference to works in the Russian, Spanish, German, French, and other Jangunges, in order that no information of value might be ornrlooked. Upou tlte request of four committfes of Congress, special information ou the Alaskan region · wa!l furni8hed to them, under my direction, b~- Mr. Dall; re8pornseR were also made to a large number of requests relating· to thiR rPgion b;y private ilH1iYidnals. During the period from August 18, 1882, to April ;{O, 188:l, Mr. Dall wa8 aided h;y Mr. Isaac Winston. Mr. 'Y. R. 1\lorgan has continue11 in th<> J>08ition of disbursing agent of the SnrYey. Mr. Morgan has been assisted by Messrs. John W. Parsons and W. A. Herbert as accountants; the latter during the fiscal year, the former since March last. In tl1e preparation of this report I have bad the aid of Assistant Edward Goodfellow. The derical duties in my office have been llerformed by Messrs. W. B. Chilton and C. D. Gedney.

REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHJRGE OF OFFICE AlW TOPOiiRAPHY FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE ao, 1883.

WASHINGTON, Jttne 30, 1883. SIR: I submit herewith the reports of the chiefs of divisions of the office, showing the gen. eral character and extent of the work executed during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1883. Beside the regular operations of the office, as given in appendices 2 and 3, and in these reports, I beg leave to refer to a few special results of the year, in the introduction of new instru· meut,fl and of valuable additions to our facilities for prompt and superior out-turn of work.
TIDE·PREDIC'l'ING MACHINE.

The maxima and minima tide predicting machine, designed by Mr. William Ferrel, of this office, has been completed. A full description of this intricate labor-saving machine, with the necessary illustrations, will appear as Appendix No.10 to your annual report for this year. I deem it only necessary to add here the fact that the principles on which it was constructed and the construction itself have been tested, and the results, compared with those deduced from the long processes of computation, have been satisfactory.
CLOSING LEVELS.

A new method of making and clm. .Jing glass tube levels has been lately adopted, at the sug. gestion of G. N. Saegmuller, chief mechanician. The tubes are made with a short, neck, as in the case of a vial, in wbiP-h a closely fitting ground glass stopper is inserted, and then hermetically sealed by the usual simple means. The improvement consists in the facilit,y with which the tube can be opened and cleared of impurities, or resupplied with ether in case of leakage.
CALENDER PRESS.

A large calender press or machine for finishing, by pressure, the surface of the largest charts issued by the Survey has been lately added to tht' printing.office. Independent of the improved appearance of the charts resulting from a pressure of nearly 2;>0 tons, the paper is hardened and macle tongher; the ink is more fixed, the distortion is more uniform, and hence sheets intended to be joined can be more correctly put together; and, it is believed, that further experiments ancl comparisons between the hancl ancl machine made paper will result in the use of American paper, which would be a step favorable to economy.
ELE<Jl'ROTYPING.

An increase in our capacity for electrotyping the engraved plates of the Survey has been long needed and discussed. Inquiries and personal examinations were made during the year, at some of the principal 6lectrotype establisbment.s in New York and elsewhere, in regard to the dynamo. electric machine, with a view to its substitution for the combination of Smee's and Walker's batteries now in use. '.J:lhe inform.a.tion obtained was not 'conclusive. The electrotyping of plates as

94

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

large as those of the Coast Survey had not even been attempted. As a last resort, we obtained from the navy-yard, Washington, throngh the courtesy of Lieutenant R. l\L Cutts, U.S. N., the temporary use of a 10-inch Weston dynamo-electric machine, and employed as the motive power our two-horse Baxter steam-engiue. The result.s were quite satisfactory on the small scale necessarily adopted. Nevertheless, taking into consideration the expense of the outlay and of additional labor, as well as the uncertainty in regard to large plates, it was deemed advisable to await further developments, and, in the mean time, to add two cells to our present batteries.
l\IA.P OF THE UNI'l'ED ST.A.TES.

The accunmlation of geographical data in the office of the Stuve~' resulting from its own operations, as well as from other Government, State, and private surveys, would seem to snggest that, under the authority of Congress, initial steps should be taken toward the construction of a map of the United States. Such a map, or rather atlas of maps, based on a scientific and unchangeable frame-work, executed on a scale appropriate to the extent of the country, and with· all possible care and judgment iu the selection and combination of the data, would constitute an official map of special value to the Government. EYentually, iu the distant future, the different States will be in a condition to undertake a thorough snrrny of their respective areas, but until that time arrives, the official map will prove of acknowledged uscfnlnes:s. With a ''iew to ascertain the practicability of the plan and of the probable time and expense to be incurred, experiments ha Ye been made both as regards the data and drawing, and so far with such promise of success that I do uot hesitate to recommend that Congress sl;iould be requested to make a special appropriation for this i1articular work. A.n estimate of the time and expense which will be required for the construction of the atlas, with a specimen of the style and scale proposed, will be presented in time for consideration at the coming session of Congress. Besides the regular force permanently attached to and employed in the office, the following field officers were detailed bJ' the Superintendent at different dates during the fiscal year for duty in the office of the Assistant in Charge, and were employed in the inking of topographical sheets, in bringing. up the party records, and in the computations required before the field-work could be turned in to the office: Assistant A. "'\Y. Longfellow, January 11 to February 14. Assistant A. T. l\Iosman, .Jannary l to April 30. Assistant W. H. Dennis, January 1 to June 30. Assistant Charles Hosmer, January and February. Assistant Andrew Braid, January and February. Assistant Gershom Bradford, February 1 to June 30. Assistant R M. Bache, Aprill to June 30. Assistant E. Ellicott, April 22 to June 30. Assistant C.H. Boyd, May 20 to June 30. Assistant F. W. Perkins, June. It gives me sincere pleasure to refer to the zeal, efficiency, and promptness with which the chiefs of division have performed the various duties assigned to them. In the office of the Assistant in Charg·e Assistant H. W. Blair served as his Assistant from July 1, 1882, to March 12, 1883, antl Assistant Andrew Braid from March 12 to June 30, and I beg to acknowledge their valuable assistance and constant interest in the conduct of the office. Mr. William B. French also deserves my thanks for the fidelity with which he has performed his clerical duties. Yours, respectfully, RICHD. D. CUTT~,

AN.l'fUAL REPORT OF THE OOMPUTING DJrJSION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1883.
COMPUTING DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, June 30, 1883. DEAR SIR: In conformity with regulations, I herewith respectfully submit the usual annual report of work done by the several computers during the year ending June 30, 1883. The charge of the Computing Division has been continued with the undersigned, and no material change took place in its organization or management. With two exceptions the personnel is the same as in the closing month of last year. Mr. Alexander Ziwet was given the place vacated by the death of Dr. Rumpf, and the place of copyist or clerk, formerly held hy Mr. C. W. Henderson was, after his decease (on December 24, 1882), filled first hy l\Ir. ,T. \Y. G. Atkins temporarily, and afterwards permanently by Mr. P. R. Stansbury. There was also some temporary assistance given by persons assigned to the Computing Division when not on field duty. Almost the whole of my spare time, after attending to the mere routine work of the Computing Division, was taken up by the discussion, report, and preparation for the press of certain geodetic and magnetic matter, viz: An account of the construction of a new compe11sation primary base, apparatus, including the determiuation of the length of the accompan,ying fi rn-meter standard bars. Accompanying the description there are two large plates of illustrations and some small diagrams. This paper forms Appendix Nu. i of the anunal report of the SmTe,r for the fiscal year ernling with June, 1882. In connection with this paper numerous comparisons were made under my direction by Messrs. D. C. Chapman, J. G. Porter, and A. Ziwet, of the six-meterand the five-meter plus onemeter standards, also of the two five-meter standards, and oue of the five-meter standards with five joined meters. After the completion of this work in the comparing room the firn-meter field standard, which had· been used in the measure of the Yolo base, California, was returned to that State. The title of a second paper presented is "Computation and discussion of the length of the Yolo base, &c." The report made on the results of the transcontinental line of geodetic spiritleveling, Parts I to V inclusive, or from Sandy Hook, N. J., to Saint Louis, 1\10., forms Appendix No. 11 of the annual report for 1882. The discussion of the Davidson quadrilaterals (of the primary triangulation in Califoruia) was advanced as far as the state of the field-work permitted. Respecting terrestrial magnetism, a fifth edition of the paper on the secular variation of the magnetic declination was brought out (illustrated with four plates). In this greatly enlarged edition about 837 declinations, observed at eighty-two stations, are full,\' discussed; this paper forms Appendix No.12 in the annual report for 18ts2. The next paper brought out, and forming Appendix No. 13 of the same report, is entitled "Distl'ibutiou of the magnetic declination in the United States at the epoch January, 1885, with three isogonic charts and one plate." This paper contains a table of all magnetic declinations taken in the country (as far as known to me) up to date-about 2,360and reduced to the same epoch. Magnetic observations were made on two days at the magnetic observatory in this city, and practical instructions were given under my direction by Subassistant Baylor to certain Signal Corps observers intended to participate in the magnetic work at the two polar stations. The number of applications for scientific information from persons not connected with the Survey has been on the increase for some time. The ordinary office correspondence, the reporting of results of computations, the demands from the Drawing Division for geographical positions, of the Engraving Division for geodetic, astronomical, and magnetic data for the charts, and of the Hydrograpbic Division for description of geodetic stations, were promptly attended to. The registers of the duplicate records of the Survey were kept up to date. . The work, in detail, performed by each computer tluring the fiscal year is given below, together With a statement of the work done by those temporarily attached to the division. Mr. Edward H. Courtenay computed part of the supplementa.ry triangulation of l.oi1g Island Sound, 1882, also of 1873 to 1877, and fitted the old work of 1833 in tltis locality to the new data; computed. the supplementary triangulation of Delaware Bay, 1882, antl brought to the same uniform

Mr. Myrick H. Doolittle adjusted the triangulation of the east coast of Florida south of Saint Augustine, including the Indian River, of 1860-'61, of 1880-'81, and of 1882 and computed the tri:werse-work south of Indian Rirnr Inlet, 1~82; computed the main triangulation in Western New York, intended to connect the triangulation of Lakes Champlain and Ontario, 1880-'81-'82; fitted the secondary triangulation of fatke Champlain of 1870-'71-'72 to the primary work; revised the triangulation connecting Jacksonville, Fla., with the sea-coast, 1854-'55; supplied a few additional positions of the old sm·,·ey of Savannah River, and of Charleston Harbor and Saint Augustine, 1882, computed the triangulation at Sabine Pass, Tex., 1882; computed the base-line at Laguna Madre, Tex., 18S2, and connected it with the triangulation; computed the traverse and geodetic work coast of Texas between Gatveston and Sabine Pass, 1882; computed the triangulation of the coast of Oregon between Tillamook Head and Tillamook Bay, 1875, and of Tillamook Bay, 1866; assisted in the preparation of the aunual geodetic statistics, and made progress with the reduction of the vertical angles of the prim:iry triangulation of California. Dr. Jermain G. Porter prepared the least-square abstract of resulting horizontal directions at primary stations Mount Como, Ne,·., 1879, Mount Grant, Nev., 1879, Carson Sink, Nev., 1880, Vaca, Cal., 1880, and Mount Tamalpais, Oal., 1882; revised the computations for latitude of Northwest Yolo base station; computed the magnetic observations of 1875, and of the northern boundary of Wyoming of 1882; assisted me in the reduction of the magnetic declinations to epoch 1885; made some miscellaneous magnetic computations and soh·ed the normal equations containing the distribution of the declinations iu Alaska; computed the 8pirit levels, Mount Diablo to Martinez East, Cal., 1880; assisted in the comparisons of the fh·e- and six-meter standards (already referred to), and in the compntatious relating th~reto; assisted me in the computation of the length of the Yolo Base, Cal., 1881; made t,he computation connecting the Yale College Obserrntory with the coast triangulation; supplied some miscellaneous geographical positions; prepared revised abstracts of resulting angles at all the stations of Pennsylvania arnl New Jersey, forming the so-called horseshoe triangulation, and established the first 1:1et of conditional equations for its adjustment. l\Ir. Alexander S. Christie computed time and astronomical azimuth at the following stations: Northwest base Yolo, Cal., 1880; ~Ion ti cello, Cal., 1880; Vaca, Oal., 1880; Venado, Tex., 1881; North base Laguna Madre, Tex., 1882, and made progress with station Mount Tamalpais, Cal., 1882; computed latitude and azimuth of station Ooglaamie, Alaska, 1881-'82; applied correction for changes of temperature to spirit leYel results between Hagerstown, Md., and Athens, Ohio, and prepared abstract of results for the whole line between Sandy Hook, N. J., and Saint Louis, Mo., as printed iu Appendix No. 11, report for 1882. Mr. Christie supplied the mean places of stars required by our astronomical parties. Mr. Charles H. Kummell made the office computation of the following differences of longitudes as determinetl h.v the electric telegraph, viz: Nashville, 'l'P1m., and Oolumbus, Ohio, 1877; Columbus, Ohio, and Washington, D.

have been in charge during the ;\'ear.
OBSERVATIONS.

Self-registering tide-gauges have been nse<l at the following stations: North Haven, Me.; Providence, R. I.; Block Island, R. I.; New London, Conn.; Sandy Hook, N. J.; Saucelito, Oal.; Kadiak, Alaska; and Honolulu, Sandwich Islands. Nothing more has been learned about the observations at Mazatlan, Mexico. The Alaska Commercial Company was furuished some time ago with a box-gauge for temporary uoe at Copper Ioland, oft' the Asiatic coast of Bering Sea., but no return bas yet been received. S.Ex.29-13

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEOffETIC SUHVEY.

So soon as a permanent tidal station shall be re-established on the Southern Atlantic coast of the United States, it would be advisable to estabfosh a similar one on the island of Bermuda with a view t-0 simultaneous observations for two or three years, in order to obtain data for a more full and general discussion of the tides. To complete the data for a full investigation of the tides of the Gulf of Mexico, it will be necessary to occupy two or three new stations west of the Mississippi for a year each. While at Long Branch last year I inspected the iron pier of the Ocean Pier Company there, and it seemed to me that a self-registering tide-gauge might be nsed on it successfully, by employing an iron pile for a float tube. As a permanent station the place appears to be free from some of the objectionable circumstances at Sandy Hook, and if, after a fair trial, the gauge should" be found to work well, the Sandy Hook gauge could be stopped. As full information bas been given in the tidal notices under the different sections of the survey, of the observations made with self-registeri11g gauges during the ,year, it is not necessary to give details here. The following table gives the stations occupied by self-registering tide-gauges, and the da· es an<l period of the euservations.

A Helf.rPgiHtering tide-gauge is now being repaired and fitted for use in the Delaware River below Philadelphia, in accordance with an arrangeme11t with the United States Engineers, and there are two more in the office for which clocks are needed. The titlal observations made by the hydrographic parties of the Coast Survey are inspected as soon as received, and mostly recluced in the Tidal Division. Notices of them will be found in the accounts of work done in the different sections of the Survey. They are generally inade with a staff or a box-gauge, and are usually day observations only, and sometimes in disconnected groups. Where the diurnal inequality is large, this mode of working sometimes resulrs in imper· foctly reduced sounding...;. The only sure remedy is more continuous work kept up day and night.
OFFICE-WORK.

The obsern-rs using self-registering gauges are now generally n·quired to tabulate the high low waters aud hourly readings from the curves before sending these to the office, and to send the tables and curws at different times to prevent losses by accidents. The observers in this way ha,·e become more skillful ancl careful, aml the work in the office is considerably reduced. The ohserrntions received from the self registering gauges and 11ydrograpbic parties are reduood as 80ou as they can be conveniently, and the rt.>sults used in prediction work, chart making, and for other purpoHPs. The reductions and discussions that have been made enable the Division to furnish a large amount of information relating to tides to officers of the Survey, civil and United States Enginet.>rs, and otht.·rs, tl!e demand for which is rapidly increasing. "'fide Tables" containing the predictions for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United StateH for the year 1884 hiwe b(teu comput-ed by the Tidal Division, and have been published, making the eighteenth year of the series. The computers employed in this division in the coarse of the year were R. S. Avery, L: P. Shidy, l\L Thomas, a11d C. B. Turnbull in the office, and J. Downes and J. G. Spaulding out of it.

Mr. Avery, being in charge of the division, inspected all tidal observations when received and prepared them for reduction, attended to the correspondence relating to tides, planned and supervised the work on tides and tide-gauges, prepared the predictions for printing and read the proofs, all<l computed when not otberwhie engaged. Mr. Sbidy reduced many observations received from hydrographic parties, predicted for places where the diurnal inequalit;r is large and some others, and aided in a large amount of miscellaneous work. Miss Thomas worked on the simplest reductions and on the honI'ly ordinates for permanent stations, aiding sometimes on miscellaneous work and copying. Miss Turnbull has been employed copying-, tracing, tabulating tides, a11d -sometimes ou eal",\' reductions. Mr. Downes, by a special contract, was predicting for certain place8 ou the Atlantic Coast, lmt <lied before the work wais completed. Mr. Spaulding computed the predictions for "Boston, as he bas doue in past years, in addition t{l his services as a tidal observer at North Haven. R. S. ·AVERY,

DR.A. WING

DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, June 30, 1883. DEAR Srn: I have the honor to submit the following summary of work performed under my direction in the Drawing Division duriug the year endiug June 30, 1883. In the detailed statement accompanying is given, iu tabular form, a list in geographical sequence of the charts completed, contiuued, or commenced, with the particular kind of work executed and the names of draughtsmen engaged thereon. In Appendix No. 3 has been incorporated a statement of the information furuished and the names of persous to whom given, iu reply to special requests made to this office for tracings, transcripts of records, &c. The division, has maintained its efficiency, and, by the close, faithful a1>plieation of its attaclies to the duties assigned them, has met all the requirements of the yearly increase in the demands upon its service. The personnel has been about the same as in past years with regard to skill and numbers, and onls a few minor changes have taken place. The photolithographic process, quick and reliable in its results, has become more aml more a very important feature with us, and, as usual, much time bas been given to the construction and inking of charts and drawings designed for reproduction and publication, by a method which facilitates our efforts to provide the public with charts of e\Tery locality at an earl~- date alter the com 11letiou of the surveys. . The general features of the work allotted to the draughtsmen and other employes are stated below: Mr. A. Lindenkohl, in the compilation of the fiuer scale-dmwings, has displayed his usual skill and celerity. Most of the small scale charts, especially those requiring rare judgment for their execution, have been intrusted to him, his long experience enabling him to meet successfully the geographical and other difficulties not infrequent iu compiling from data of various dates, kinds, anll scales. An elaborate map of t.be Unitetl States, from the latest authorities, based upon our own sm·veys, has be.en begun by Mr. Lituleukohl, on ·a scale of ten miles t-0 the inch. A chart of

100

the harbors of Washington and Georgetown was completed by him during the year. He has kept the Progress Sketches supplied with all additions up to date. l\lr. H. Lindenkohl, equally accomplished as draughtsman and engraver, bas been occupied principally with the preparation of standard drawings of harbor and coast charts for photolitho· graphing, beside8 engnwing on stone se\reral diagrams and sketches required for illustrations to the appendices accompan~·ing the annnal report of the Sun'ey. Mr. Lonis Karcher, notwithstanding the ~reat number of projections calleAl for during the year, has ext~cn~ed most of them with dispatch, and found time to construct the many projects needed hy the office, and to t>xecute 11umerous diagrams and other miimellaneous work. · Mr. E. J. Sommer was employed in a variety of ways: making projections on paper and on copper, preparing tracings, and reducing topography and hydrography. l\fr. P. E1iclnien bas drawn topographical d.etails on engraved outl.ines, and made drawings of instruments of precision, perRpectiw· arnl otherwise, imrne of them of quite iin elaborate character. l\lr. C . .Ju11keu, wbo111 tl1e Superintendent had detailed for special duty in surveying and mapping a tract ot' laud in W.rthe Uonnt,Y, Virginia, for the United States Fish Commission, was Pngagt·d in the purformance thereof until its completion, in July, when he reported back to the dh'it>ion, wheuce be was detached November 11, and assigned to the Hydrographic Inspector. Between .Tuly and NO\·emher, Mr. ,Jnnkeu gaye his attention to hydrographic reductions. l\1r. T. J. O'Snllinm has been engaged almost exclusively in the preparation of charts and lrawings for publication by photolithography. Efo also made diagrams, projects, and tracings, and did general letteriug. Mr. A. B. Graham, in addition to constructing- projections for the use of hydrographic parties, has reduced and transferred the shore-line upon ne'1rl.r all projections made in the office during the year. Triangulation sketches, diagrams, &c., have all received a share of Mr. Graham's time. l\lr. J. 8. Tyrrell was employed wholly iu coloring buoys, light-houses, and other aids to navigation upon the printed charts until March 21, 1883, when he was transferred and worked under the direction of Assistant Andrew Braid. Miss I<'. Cadel also did dut;y in this division, in coloring buoys and light-houses, until :\larch 21, 1883, when she was tmnsferred to the immediate direction of Assistant Andrew Braid. Messr8. E. H. Fowler and E. Molkow, who were detached from the Drawing Division, in July, 1881, and assigned to the then newly c~eated Division of Topography, were returned to this division in Octoher, 1882, and have been engaged since then mostly in inking plane-table sheets. Mr. \' .·J. Fagin joined the division in February, 1883, and performed the clerical duties required hy me quite acceptably till the 12th of March, following, at which date he was transferred to the otlhw of tbe disbursing agent. Mr. ,J. C. BaIT became re-attached to the division on the 12th of March, 1883, since which time he has acted as clerk, and done duty in coloring published charts and making corrections, when required, to the aids to navigation on the same.

Of the 27 completed chart plates, 10 are new charts, 13 new editions, and 4 reissues. I append hereto a list showing in detail the plates that were completed, continued, or commenced during the year. The corrections to the plates of the published charts were not so numerous as during the preceding year, although this class of corrections required the handling of 423 plates. As a rule, a few hour's work suffices to make the chauges iudicated. lu addition to the engraving, we have had the usual amount of cleaning electrotypes, erasures from altos, drawing and arranging titles, general lettering and notes, marking instruments, &c. The force of the division remains as at the beginning of the year, and bas been employed as follows: Messrs. J. Enthoffer, A. Sengteller, and R. F. Bartle, on topography; Messrs. E. A. Maedel, A. Petersen, J. G. Thompson, and F. Courtenay, on lettering; Messrs. \V. A. Thompson and H. C. Evans, on topography and sanding; Messrs. E. H. Sipe, W. H. Da>is, and A. C. Ren hsam, on lettning and miscellaneous corrections; Messrs. H. M. Knigltt and F. W. Benner, on sanding; and Mr. T. Wasserbach, on sanding and miscellaneous corrections. 'fhe work of the printing office has been conducted as described in my report of last year. The addition to the force of one helper has permitted running the third press almost constantly since that time. The two large presses haYe remained, as heretofore, in charge of Mr. F. Moore and D. N. Hoover. The third press was placed in charge of Mr. J. L. Smith, and has been used prin· cipally in printing the Coast Pilot work and the smaller chart plates. The new paper press mounted in April has proved most satisfactory. It does all that the builders claimed for it and greatly enhances the artistic appearance of the charts. The great annoyance arising ftom sending plates to lithographers for transfer proofs, led me to attempt pulling our own transfers. I am pleased to report the result as entirely satisfactory, and am confident we can now furnish transfers of the finei;t work, that in the hands of skilled workmen will not fail on the stone.

. The general superintendence of thA electrotyping of the office plates, placed under my charge m Decembtir laat, has received my close attention. 'l'he plans yon have approved for increasing t~e facilities of this work are in preparation, and it is my hope will be in successful operation suffi· citmtly early to show a marked increase in the coming year's results. 11 is a question of quant.ity, as We can hardly e.~t any improvement in the excellent quality of the plates now turned out.

Zumbrock, electrotypist, furnishes the following statistics of the electrotyping· and photographing during the year: For the Survey, 18 altos weighing 401 pounds, with a plate surface of 21,012 square inches, aud 21 bassos weighing 710k pounds, with a plate surface of 23, 76:~ square inches. For the Hydrographic Office, United States Navy, 2 altos weighing 44 pounds, with a smfaee of 2,264 square inches, and 4 bassos weighing 108 pounds, with a surface of 3,426 square inches. For the Engineer's Office, United States Army, 10 altos weighing 220 pounds, with a surface of 11,472 square inches, and 10 bassos weighing· 365 pounds, with a surface of 11,472 square inches. Total number of plates electrotyped, sixty-five, weighing l,848~ pounds, with a plate surface of 73,408 square inches. Besides these electrotypes an alto and basso were made of a seal for the General Land Office, and two clock faces for instrument shop; 69 plates were steel-faced, 56 negatives were taken of maps and instruments, and 163 prints were made. Mr. J. H. Smoot has attended t.o the clerical duties of the division in a most satisfactory manner. Yours, very respectfully, · HERBERT G. OGDEN, Assistant in Oltarge of Engraving Division. R. D.

Washington, D. O., Augu,qt 1, 1883. I have the honor to submit herewith the annual report of this division for the year · ending J nne ::io, 1883: The work of the division has included, as heretofore, the correspondence with sale agents relating to the supply and sale of Charts, Coast Pilots, and Tide Tables; the purchase, custody, mul isirne Of SfatiODPry i the printing and distribution Of the blank forms, record books, &c., Ui<ed ill tl..w office and in the field-work, and of the annual reports and other publications of the Survey; the supervision and care of the office buildings; the general charge of camp equipage, &c.; the gl'neral direction of work in the carpenter-shop, and such other special duties as have been assigned from time to time by the Superintendent and the a:-;sistant in charge of office and topograph~·. Satisfactory progress was made during the year in the publication of the Annual Reports, which from a variety of causes had fallen far behiwl current dates, and those for the years 1878, 1879, a111l 1880 were printed and distributed. The text of the Report for 1881 was also printied, but its issue before the close of the year was prevented by the failure of the contractor for the lithographing to furnish the sketches and illustrations. , 'rhere were received from the Public Printer during the year the following aggregates of publications of 18e Survey:

REPORT OF WORK DONE IN THE INSTRUJ!EXT DIVISTON DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1883.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETH1 SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, June 30, 1883. SIR: I have the honor herewith to ~ubmit a report of work done in the instrument shop during the last fiscal year. In addition to th<.J usual routine work of keeping the records and superintending the repairing-, adjusting, and sending out of instruments, a great part of my time was occupied with the diYiding engine and in graduating a number of iustrurnents. The tide·predicting machine was also full~ tinished, and it is now in perfect order and can be used at auy time. During the year I perfoct-0d ahm a uew method of clm;ing leYel vials, an account of which appears in this report. Of other special work do'ne in the i1uitrument shop, I mention the entire reconstruction, by Mr. John Clark, of Theodolite No. 10 (14-inch Wurdemann); its whole superstructure has been changed, a new graduation having been put on some time ago, and Assistant Granger pronounces it one of the best theodolites in the service. The larger repeating theodolitl R have nearly all recein~d new tangent screws. Mr. E. Eslllemau, besides his regular work of getting iustruments ready for the field, has reconstructed Theodoliti>s NoR. 82 and 127. The former i1mtrument had bad a fall, and although badly injured, it was repaired so thoroughly that. the officer who afterward used it pronounces iL first class. The instrument recPived a latitude level and circle, and also a micrometer eJe-piece, and is now a<htpted for time and latitude ohsenation:s, and it was used on the boundary surve;y between Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Mr. P. Vierbuchen overhauled .the 4-meter base-bars, and tested and adjusted meter-chains. Ile also reconstructed a number of the older protractors and commenced the making of 6 new ones. Louis Fischer rendered valuable assistance to me while working on the dividing engine in taking micrometer readings. Ile also prepared the silver surfaces ready for graduations. The experimental work on the new machine for grinding fine levels automaticall~· was all done b~" him under my direction. A description of this machine will be submitted at an early day. An apparatus for testing micrometer screws, which prove.d of great utility, was also his work. S. Kearney was kept busy with overhauling all our heliotropes and making back-mirrors and plumb-bobs. He also made all the needed brass work for tripods and telemeters, besides repairing the drawing instruments and executing miscellaneous work called for by the office. Yours, respectfully, G. N. SA.EGMULLER, Chief Mechanician.

REPORT OF THE HYDROGR.:lPHIC IN8I'BCTOR FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1883.
UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

W a.~hington, August 1, 1883. Srn: I have the honor to make the following report of hydrography 1111der my charge for tbe fiscal year ending June, 1883. The commencement of the year found the vessels situated al'.! follows : The steamer Blake, Commander J. R. Ba,rtlett, U. S. N., at work-dee1)·sea soundings-off Montauk Point. The steamer .A. D. Bache, Lieut. Uommander B. B. Thomas, U.S. N., at New York preparing for summer's work off New York entrance. The steamer G.e<luey, Lieut. Commamler ,V, H. Brownson, U.S. X., at ~ew York preparing for summer's work o:ff New York entrance. The steamer Endeavor, Lieut. H.B. Mansfield, U.S. N., at work, Delaware River. The schooner Eagre, Lieut. H. G. 0. Colby, U.S. N., at work, coast of Maine. The schooner Silliman, Lieut. E. M. Hughes, U. S. N., at New York preparing for summer's work, Long Island Sound. The schooner Drift, Master J. 0. Fremont, jr., U.S. N., at New York preparing for work, Long Island Sound. · The schooner Ready, Assistant H. L. Marindin, commanding, preparing for work in Delaware River. On the Pacific coast: The steamer Hassler, Lieut. Commander H. E. Nichols, U. S. N., commanding, at work in Alaska waters. · The steamer McArthur, Lieut,, W. T. Swinburne, U. S. N., commanding, at Marc Island pre· paring for summer's work. The schooner Earnest, Lieut. Perr~· Garst, U. S. N., commanding, at Olympia, Wasl1ington 'ferritory, preparing for summer's work. All the remaining vessels of the Sun·cy were laid up or under repairs. The Rchooner Palinurus, however, was put in commission uuder command of I . . ieut. R. Clover, U. S. N., and during the summer was engaged in the survey of Long Island Sound; and tbe sehooner G. M. Bache, under the command of As!'listant J. S. Bradford, was engaged in Ooast Pilot. work. Commander Bartlett, after commencing the season i11 command of the steamer Blake, rumiing a line of deep-sea soundings and temperatures from Nantucket to Bermuda, and thence to Cape Hatterai,;, was compelled to succumb to the great strain upon his system during over four ;vcars' conimand of the vessel, and was relieved October 1, li582, by Lieut. Commander W. H. Brownson. who had previously been ordered by you to the vessel to become acquainted with the methods of carrying on the work. Lieut. Commander Brownson's plaee as commanding officer of the steamer Gedney was filled bs the transfer of Lieut. H. B. Mansfield from the command of the steamer Endeavor, and hiR place in turn was filled by the promotion of Lieut. Hugo Osterhaus, the senior Assistant on board the Endeavor.

After assuming command, J,ieut. Commaniler Brownson, in the Blake, ran a line of deep.sea soundings to the eastward of Nantucket, and then returned to the southern coast of Long Island, continuing the work upon which the party was engaged at the commencement of the fiscal year. Litmt. P. Garst's time having expired, he was relieved from duty in the Coast Survey on July 2, 1882, arnl the command of the schooner Earnest was given to Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, U. S. :N., transferred from the steamer Hassler. Tlie Yarious parties remained at work in the Jiort.hern waters as Jong as the weather permitted, or until about November 1, wlten they prepared for the winter season iu the southern waters. This timt' waH taken to make some changes in the organization of the parties, necessitated by the expiration of the terms of service of some of the naval officers attache1l to the Survey. Lieut. Commander E. B. TI10mat>' ver,v efficient service, first as commander of the steamer Endeavor and lastly' or the stm1111er Bache, Jrn,·ing been completed, he was relieved b~T the Navy DepartrneJJt November 25, 1882, and tlie command of tlle latter ''essel assumed, under your instructions, by l . ient. H. B. Mansfield, while the command of the Gedney devolved upon Lieut. E. M. Hughes. Lieut. H. G. 0. Uolby, CT. S. N., very much to the regret of this office, was, after over two ;years' servicfl as chief of party in cornmalld of the schooner Eagre, withdrawn for regular naval duties and his place taken by Lieut. E. D. F. Heald, U. S. N. Iiient. Hugo Osterhans's services were ahout the same time lost to the Survey by the expiration of 11i8 tl1ree years' senice, and Lieut. John 'l'. Sullivan, U.S. N., haYin~ been ordered to the Survey hy tl1e Navy Department, was assigned to the command of the steamer Endeavor in hiR place. 'l'he \'acancy in t11e 1~ommand of the schooner Silliman, made by the transfer of Lieut. E. '.\1. H11gl1t':s to the t:edne,Y, \ms filled by Lieut. F. A. "Wilner, the senior Assistant on the Bache. I will append to this report a complete list of the naval officers on Coast Survey service during the fiscal year, giving the dates of their attachment and detachment, with the names of those officers still ou duty in the Survey. Also, a list of the vessels belonging to the work, their tonmige, &c. During the winter the rnssels were engaged in surveys at the following points: The Blake, iu deep-sea soundings, between Bermuda and the Bahamas, and along the outside of tlte Bahama Banks. The steamer A. D. Bache, during the earlier part of the season on the west coast of Florida, and later OH the east coal'lt. The "teamer Gedney surveyed Galveston inner bnr an1l continued the outsjde work from Galveston entrance to the eastward. The steamt>r Endeavor, in the vicinity of (]ape l~omain, South Carolina. The steamer Hitchcock, in charge of Assistant F. Vf. Perkins, in Sabine Pass and Calcasieu J{iver. The steamer B~trataria, in charge of Assietant 0. Il. Boyd, in the bayous of Louisiana, to the westward of the ,Jump. The schooner I~agre, in the Saint, .John's R.iver from Jacksonville to the bar. The schooner Quick, in charge of Hubassistaut J. HergeHheimer, in the vicinits of Sarasota, Fla. The schooner Silliman, at Cape Fear entrance, North Carolina, and later in Pamplico Sound. The schooner Drift, engage1l in obtaining current observations off the coast,, from Ca11e Charles to Oape Florida. Tlw scl10011er Hea1ly, in charge of Assistant 0. H. Tittmann, in Key Biscayne Bay, Fla. The sloop Steadfast, in charge of Assistant B. A. Colonna, in Indian River, Fla. On the I>acific coast. t.11e steamer Hassler, having returned from Alaska about December 1, was preparing during the winter for a continuation of the important work 011 that coa.st as soon as the weather would permit, and sailed about the middle of .April. The steamer McArthur continued the survey of the coast of Oalifornia. from Monterey south· ward. . The vessels actually at work continued until about :Ma_y 15, when they were withdrawn t.o pre· pare for the summer season.

During the latter part of the fiscal year tlw following vessels were at work in 11ortltern waters: The Blake, off New York entrance; The Arago, under command of J,ieut. t:.. C. Hannis, in Delaware Bay; The Scoresby, in charge of Assistant Charles Ho8mer, at Hart and City Islands, Long Ii:ihmd Sound; and The Palinurus, Lieut. A. V. "\Vadhams co111maudi11g, at Stonington, Con11. All tlle other vessels were, at the close of the fiscal year, either lai(l np or were engagrd in active preparation for commencing the summer season's work at a11 early date, after .July 1. The results of the various surveys are given in the detailed reportis of the chiefs of parties.
REPAIRS.

'l'he Yery small appropriation at the disposal of tl1e oflice in cari11g for a fleet of twenty-fiye \'l'Ssels, with nearly double the immlJer iu commissi·m tl.u111 there han been in prPYiom; yl'aris, has rendered it only possible to make the most important repairs. The nrnclti11ery of the l:tr::er steamers (Blake, Bache, Gedney, Hassler, and McArtlrnr) alonl' requires a good sharp of the $30,000 to keep it in order. Particularly is this the case on the western coast, where thii,; class of work is very expensive. The schooners, such aR the Hesearch, Drift., Palinurus, Ready, Brisk, Quick, &c., being what are knowu as composite vesseh;, require to be Rtripped of their copper at allont the end of tin1 years (or the average age at wliich copper sheathing lastB), Ro that thP iron l101ts may he re11ewe1l where the fastening·s haVf· becu looseiw<l and galvanic action g·oing 011, ret near]~- all the nsselt-> are ten or twelve years old now, and the Sillirnau is the fir:-:t one that bas bee11 rernetale(l. 'l'his vessel, although one of the class having wooden frames, was found to require new metal before going south last year, and the result proved that in addition to the cost of replacing the metal (a matter of some $1,200 or $1,500) the expense was much increased by the umnber of bolts that were found corroded. This loosened the planks and the vessel had to he docked SlWeral times, stripping a goo(l portion of her copper each time before she was made tight again. In this case, the work being done under contract, the expense of the additional labor was met by the coutractors. This action betwt;ien the copper and the iron ha Ying takeu place in a wooden Yessel much more expeuse is anticipate<! in rem<>taling the VE>SRels with iron frame8, where larger masses of iron are exposed to the galvanic actiou between the two suhistauces. While the usual allowance of $:~0,000 for repairs of vesKels is Rufficient for the onlinar_y wear awl tear of material, these and other causes make it 11ccessar~· for me to submit for your cou:-:ideration an additional estimate for the extraordinary Pxigencies of the Sf>rviee. During the year the steamer Arago has heen supplied with new boilerH. [n taking the old ones out it was found that many sheets of her bottom plating were nearly ea.ten tlmmgh, aud tweu~·-oue of them. eovering a good portion of her bottom, had to be replaced. These extensive repairs have put lter iron hull in very good C6ndition, but the expenses ran up to such a Anm tlmt lit.tie or nothing could be done to the wood-work, which is sadly iu need of repairs, aud when made the YeSS('l will lie in very good condition. The steamer Blake baA had only enough repairs to make her tide over another seai;on, whe11, it is thought, a consulerable amount o:( money will h:we to be expe11ded upon her or the vessel put out of commission. About five years ago the boilers of this vessel were reportrnl as requiring replacing. hut a.11 examination made it advisable to put extensive repairs upon them which would carry her through two years' more service. Stnce that time they have been kept running, tmtil now they have gotten tn such a point that it is dangerous to run them except under a. low, and not an ecouomieal, 1iressure of steam. Her upper deck ba.s in a like manner been patched up to await the removal of her boilers, when a good portion of it would have t-0 be replaced an,1way! and economy demands that this should he done at the same time. This will be a matter of $10,000 6r $12,000, and if required to come out of the general appropriation leaves a very small proportion for the rest of the fleet. The steamer Bacbe, in addition to incidental expenses, such as a new hoat, new awni11g!l: slight repairs to the machinery before starting south for the survey of the coast of Florida, returned in !June requiring new braces and extensive patches on the boiler and o.ther portions of the machinery,

116

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

and also a general overhauling. This, through the courtesy of. the commandant of the New York navy.yard, has been done for less than any outside contractor would do the work, and it is believed that a better job bas been made than otherwise would have been done. The boiler of this vessel is beginning to show its age (over ten years), and within a short time will have to be replaced. The steamer Hassler, as has already been mentioned, was compelled to have her repairs made in an expensive market on the Pacific coast, and the $5,000 or $6,000 expended upon her has allowed but little more than an extensive overhauling of the boilers, machinery, and hull to fit her for he~ long season's work in Alaskan waters; and it is thought the end of this season will find her boilers in such a condition as to make it unsafe for further demands to be made upon them. In renewing the boilers of this vessel there will be required, as in the Blake, a new upper deck. This vessel ;rns built of iron of i inch thickness, in 1872, and the question of sheathing her with wood, as was done in the case of the steamer Bache, will soon have to be taken up. Four inches of oak or Oregon fir over this iron would make her a most efficient vessel, of great strength, and much more lialJle to e:scape serious injury iu grounding (an accident that is very likely to occur to a surveying vessel). The iron bottom now compels docking the vessel once in six months at least, to clear the extensive growth of barnacles, grass, &c.; in fact, after two months t.be speed of the vessel has been reduced to ;mch an extent by fouling, that economy would demand docking to save the expense of coal wasted. Of course this would be unnecessary with the wooden sheathing covered with metal, and it is thought it would take only a few years to make up the difference in consumption of coal, docking expenses, &c. It would seem very much to the interest of the Government to execute both of these extensiYe repairs at the same time. The steamer Gedney has had during the year some general repairs to machinery and hull, new masts, new sails, and two new boats; has been fitfod with a distiller for condensing fresh water for the crew, thereby b~nefiting the sanitary condition of the ship and saving much time usually required in replenishiug the tanks. Steam heaters have been fitted throughout the vessel, which proved conducive both to the health of the crew and safety of the ship. This vessel, with the exception of her propeller aud shoe, which have gradually become corroded by the galvanic action going on between its iron and the copper of the vessel's bottom, is in very good condition. The :McArthur's repairs have heen slight during the year, and with the exception of some improvements to be ma{1e to the fittings of the vessel, Ruch as a steam windlass, will probably be 8light during the coming year. The steamer Bndeavor has had quite extensive repairs on the machinery, consisting of lining up shaft, new brasses, and new fittings required to an engine of old design and imperfect attach· ments. The lower part of her hull is in good conditiou, with the exception of the rudder, which is likely t.o require replacing at. the end of this season. Some repairs may be anticipated upon the hull and rigging als8. The steamer Ilitchcock was fouud to require some general repairs upon preparing for the last winter's work, such as a new stem, a number of new planks, repairs to stern-post, &c. The vessel waM fitted out quite inexpensively throughout by Lieutenant Flynne, who, with some old sails belonging to the Brisk, rnadt~ new ones for this vessel, ~well as fitting rigging, &c., by the ship's crew. She is likely to require some slight repairs before taking· the field again. The schooner Eagre, formerly the yacht .M:ohawk, has had nearly a complete set of new sails during the year, and as far as they are concerned she is in good order, but her hull begins to show signs of weakness. A vessel of her size and build requires all her parts in good condition. Lieutenant Heald reports that 011 tl1e passage north from the Saint.John's River, during a gale of wind, while she showed qualities that her officers and crew were compelled to admire, yet the indications were that some defect existed that could not be seen, since she leaked as much as twenty-four inches a day. Before subjecti11g her to so severe a strain again, it will be necessary to remove the olJ copper, calk the vessel, and put new metal on the bottom, and Lieutenant Heald reports that' new decks w:ill also be required. This is a matter of $5,000 or $6,000. Besides these vessels, the steamer Barata.ria, schooners Earnest, Scoresby, Quick, G. M. Bache, Drift, Palinurus, Ready, and sloop Steadfast have been in commission and required more or less repairs, as indicated in the statement of the disbursing agent of amount of money expended on each vessel. The steamer Barataria is likely to require extensive repairs before again ta.king the

The mmal routine duties of the office have contiune1l. The aids to navigation, as will be seen the catalogue recently published, are indicateLl on the charts to the latest date. This part of the office duties has been under the direction of Lieut. .T. E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., who brought to the office on his re-entry into the Survey in July, 1882, an expPrience in the handling- of charts 8eldom had by one officer, and his Rystem aud zeal ha,·e euabled the office to keep our charts to the latest dates. I would call your attention to the hearty co-operation of the I,ight.·llonsc Board, through its secretaries, in informing thiH office at the earliest moment of changes or contemplat1~(i changes in aids to navigation. Upon authorit,v being g'iven by the Board to one of the Iight-hon:-:e i1nipcctors, in any wa.v relating to aids to 11avigation, the Naval SecrcLar,y sends tu this ofJie.e a chart showing the proposed change or a.Idition, and this office return:-; at once a fresh cop,v of the chart sent, in order that the files of tile Board may be complete. The plotting and preparation of the hydrogmphic sheet:;; from the data sent in by the parties have lwen carried on in the usual efficient manner by l\Jessrs. E. Willenbucher, \V. C.

No. 7.

' A TABLE O.F DEPTHS FOR THE H.UrnORS OX THE COASTS OF THE UNITED STATES.

Tlw following table, showing the best water that can he taken through tlie entrances and up to tlw usunl ancbor2ges in the harbors of the United States and those of flt<' immediately adjacent t:oasts, was fin;t prepared in outline (under instructions from the Superintendent) by Commander Edward P. Lull, U. S. NaYy, Hydrographic Inspector United States Coast and Gl)odetic Survey, arnl afterwards expanded and perfected in detail by Assistant J. S. Bradford, aided by M:r. Jno. W. Parsons.

TIDES.
I. From Eastport, llflJ., to Saint Auvustine, Fla., the tides are of the semi-diurnal type, the two titles of the same day being pra.ctically P<J!Ull in r:mge. There is, howeTer, a marked difference between the range of "spring" tides (that h;, those whicll follow tlw full and change of the moon) and that of the "neap" Wies (those followiug her first and third quarter:-;), tbe raiige of the former being abo,·e, and that of the latter below the ::werage. II. Passing southward from Sa,int Augustine, the range of the tides is considerably diminished, and the modification due to the moon's declination becomes more and more apparent: That is, near the periods of the moon's greatest declination north or south there is an ineqnalHy in the range of the two tides of the same day, which disappears as the moon approaches and crosses the equator. Ill. Pas1Jing up the 1restcm ct>ast of the peninsula <!f Florida, the semi-diurnal tides gradually disappear. To the northward nrnl westward of' Cedar Re_\·s, and thence to tlte mouth of the Hio Grande~ there is but one astronomical tide tluring eacli lmwr day, and that of small range. This tide is of greatest range at and near the pe.riods of the mo011's greatest declination uorth or south, aud disappears at the time of the moon's crossing the equator. "\Vind-tides" are Yer~· marked80utherly winds (particularly if prt>vailing fur several d,1ys) raising the lenl of the water, and nortl1erly winds having the opposite effect. IY. On the Pacific coast (including the southern coast of Alusl~a), the tides are of the semi.diurnal 1ype, the two tides of the 1'1ame day having different rauges. The inequality increases as the moon Ui<H'e~ uorth or son th from the equator; is greatest at the moon's greatest declination; 1lecreases as she approaf:hes the equator; and disappears at tlie period of no declination. There is also a sensi· hh, modification of the tides following the moon's phases. Thus, wllen the fnll or change occm·i; at or near the time of greatest deplination, the range of tide will be somewhat augmented; and, on the other han<l, if neap tides occur at the same period the range will be diminished.

APPENDIX

No. 8.

THE ESTUARY OF THE DELAWARE.
A
report by HENRY MITCJ-IELL, AsRistant.

In a report made in March, 1881, which was publisJ1ed as Appendix No. 1.3 of t11e Annual Report of the Coast and Geodetic SurYey for 1879, I called your att..ention to three rules which answer well for over (i() miles of the Delaware below League Island. These ruleR are: " 1st. Tl1e tramwerse section is directly proportional to the discharge. "3d. The width is proportional to the discharge. "3d. The mean-depth is the same in all sections." These rules were based upon surveys made forty years ago, and I dared not, therefore, employ the data except in large groups, not only because I doubted the accuracy of the field-work, hut alRo because the soundings did not cover the ground uniforml,y, so that discrepancies were foun<l to exist among smaller groups. I have now in my hands the portion of the new survey from Philadelphia to a point !i2 miles below. This portion I shall call the estuary for distinction, because below this we come. upon a. Rubmerged delta where the stream splits into numerous channels not unlike the passes of the MissisRippi, or more like those of the Ganges after its issue upon the Bay of Bengal. In my earlier work my data were grouped for reaches of 5 miles each, but in my work upon the new survey I have increased the number of my groups by diminishing the distance covered by each group to one 'nautical mile. This I have done at some risk of discorcl arising from bend e.ffect,s. The hernls in the course of a stream flowing through alluvium '?ause deepening at the apices and correApondiug shoaling at reversions. This was founU to be true in the Lower Mississi1lpi, hoth as regardA mean-depth and channel-depth. The widths are also similarly affected. In order, therefore, to obtain the broadest. view of the river'R dimensions, each group of data should be large enough to i11cl111le at least one bend and one inflection, or equal multiples of similar bernfa and infledions. Practically tl1is can only be realized in large groups, where inequalities_ of reverse curvatures t1is. appear. Nevertheless, with this new snrvey in my hands, as perfect in its details as I could ask, I have felt that I could afford to Jet occasional contradictions go uncauoolled, rather than lose the benefit of mtml>er in evidence. At the close of tbis report the compiled data are furnished for the estuary of the Delaware from 734 cross sections with widths varying from 1 to 5 mileR and including many thousand soundings. It was a vast work to compile accurat;ely so many measures of width and depth, and compute the area of every section separately; but happily you had assigned for tl1is work one whmm long experience as Assistant, upon the Coast ancl Geodetic Survey rendere<l him a judge and an expert in such matters. Mr. ,J. A. Sullivan, the person t.o whom I refer, has Reen no occa.~ion to r~ject anr ohserved data, and he has, at my request, prefaced his tables l·Y note!'! upon his method, which ma.terially add to the strength of the testimony. These notes and a stat;ement of the data consulted appear at the end of this paper. In a ta.ble and diagram that immediat.ely follow I repro<lnce some of the data to which I llaYe referred, and add some computed curves generalizing the results.

The point of grc,·test interest and physical importance is the constancy of mean-depth. In the firRt fignro of tho cli:-tgram (p. 241 ), which repre,scnts the mean-depth for ea.ch nautical mile, any one must admit, I think, that. a horizontal straight line best represents the generalized result, there being no order of recurrence in the fluctuations above and below.

These fluctuations in the mean-depth are mostly due to inequalities in the nature of the soil. At Deep-water Point (nineteenth mile of our fable), for instance, gravel and stones brought down by the ice, perhaps, have held the bank against the stream, while in other places the soft banks have sloughed away under the action of waves. These peculiar sections might have been rejected as anomalous, but I have preferred to accept all the testimony precisely as furuislrnd by the rmrveyors, letting the stony points and sloughing banks offset each other, which they do very well. Some of the smaller fluctuations are, no doubt, due to uucancellc<l bend effects. The graml meau .including all the soundings for 46 nautical miles, is 18.64 feet. '

'I'he width of the estuary must, however, be regarded as the independent variable of our table, and for this reason the equation of a curve which should sweep out its irregularities has been sought with a view to using it as a factor in generalizing the variations of sectional areas. Hap· pily a ~ery simple expression was found to answer, viz : the square of the distance ii~ 1urntical niiles multiplied by 10.1, and this multiplied again by 18.64 (the constant of mean-depth) is the cun·c of sectional areas. These curves, I submit, are just as real in nature as the constant of mean-depth. No_ing~nuity has been employed, and the harmony of these expressions with fundamental law~ of_ motion s1m?,lY indieates that running water has adjusted its bed to its own demands, for the tide is the workmtr .agent here.

S. Ex. 29--31

UNITED STATES OOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Under the parabolic expression for the increments of width tha,t haR been given, the incre. ments of surface area should follow the third power of the distance, and the rule of the former report,·" width proportional to discharge." could not hold good were it not that the range of the tide declines with distance (at first in a marked degree and then slightly, as indicated by the observations of the United States Engineers), so that to obtain the increments of discharge we should not multiply the areas b~~ a constant, but by a diminishing quantity. It will be observed that the ratio of perimeter to sectional area remains essentially the same throughout the estuary ; I do not, however, regard this as a primary condition making my rule for discharge possilJle, but as a resultant.. Tidal streams, augIDenting their discharge as they approa-0h the sea, must necessarily make their deposits so as t,o form shallow and divergent estuaries, for there is no disposition t,o deepen if there is no restraint at the sides; but the contrary, as when a stream issues upon the sea, or a lake, it widens at the expense of itB depth of flow. In the estuary of the Delaware _we ha.ve a remarkaule case of equilibrium resulting in a constancy of mean-depth. · Of course it may be safely inferred from our rule that the mean velocities for our cross-sections are the same, but we have no observations upon the transverse curves of velocities from which t,o predict the drift through the ship channel. The importance of making such observations ~·ou have already seen, and I need not remind you that, aside from the direct advantage to the navigator from the better tables we shall be able to furnish, we shall discover in the profiles of these curves the changes that induce or reflect the variations of channel depth. I have spoken of the adjustment of the mold of the estuary t,o the tidal currents; but I hasten t,o say that in this adjustment cause and effect are convertible terms. The reaction of the bed and banks is measured in the retard of the tide-ioave. The remarkable uniformity of mean depth, and the recurrent sameness of channel depth for the 46 miles under consideration should lead us to expect that the tidal retardation, so far as affected by depth, should also be uniform, and this appears to be the case. But the formula for the times of high water given in a former report (Appendix No. 18, Annual Heport Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1881) contains two terms, one of which may be regarded as reflecting the uniform resistance of the bed, while the other indicates a continual increment of resistance, which I submit is due t,o the converging width· of the estuary. The formula referred to is y= 2.2x· + 0. Ol8x 2, which gives almost exactly, in minutes, the delay of the tide from the bn·akwatt>r (from which the distance xis measured in nautical miles) to PhiladelJlhia, as showu in the subjoined table, quored from the former report:

in which the uniform resistance dependent upon depth has increased its coeflicient with the fall of the tide, while the second term has remained unchanged, beca1rne the width bas declined very little, comparatively, and this without altering the law of its variation. _ We may, at the expense of simplicity and extent of application, introduce the will.th instead of the distance into this second term of the tidal formula. If we transfer the origin from the Breakwater to Fort Miffiin, and measure the distances and times in the oppoHite <lirection, the expression for high water becomes 5.11x-0.018x2; and now introducing instead of x2 its value from the width formula (10.lx2+5100) we haYe, strictly within our limits5.11 distance - 0.0018 width + 92 rninides. In tllis form each term llas its distinct physical meaning, which was not the case before. I think this is the first instance where uniformity of depth has afforded the opportunity to measure the distinct influence of width upon the tidal propagation iu a ·funnel-shaped avenue. It remains to show what practical value these inquiries may have-not because their intrinsic interest would not have justified the time and labor given to them, but because they were undertaken with practical purposes in view. This persistent tendency to constancy of mean.depth throughout the whole lengih of the estuary would seem to discourage tlie hope of improvement by dredgiug. There is a spell upon the scene which must be broken if permanent increase of depth o;·er tht' bars is demanded by commerce. Except for two or three shallow reaches of short extent, there is plenty of water from the ocean to Philadelphia, and at these obstructed reaches artificial contractions of the water-way may be made without altering the course of the stream or sensibly reducing the tidal Yolume; so that deepening may be induced where required without changing the eonditious elsewhere. The advantage of dredging over indirect methods lies, of conrse, in the confinement of the expenditure to the channel. The method by contraction induces Rcour oyer the whole sectio~1 in about the proportion of depth, and the work done by this means elsewhere than in the ship channel is of little or no benefit. The economic question, howeyer, is-which will give the best resultf The diagonal bars at the nodes of reverse curves in the course of the river may be obliterated by contraction, and the channel centralized. This is an important economical cousi<leration, because wherever we find a single midwa~· channel the width affects the <lepth proportionally for every ordinate of the profile. If, for instance, the cross-section is a parabola (and this it often is), reduction of the surface chord induces 50 per cent. more deepening in the channel than in the mean-depth. Comparisons between mean-depth and channel-depth for the estuary of the Delaware show that the maximum depth in the cross-section is 1.84 times the mean-depth-of conrse, in these comparisons the bend effects for reverse curves do not cancel. In our mile groups t,here are only eight where this ratio sinks below 1.50, and none below 1.40. This is as far as my province extends into engineering. :November 1, 1883.

Lieut. E. B. Thomas, U.S. N. The lines of soundings upon these sheets were made from shore to shore, at distances apart in mid-river of about 280 feet where the survey was upon the scale of 1-.5000 ;-550 feet upon 1-10000; 870 feet upon 1-20000; and in general were at right angles to the axis of the stream. In exceptional cases, where the bends in the river were sharp, the lines did not represent alwayR the shorter distance from shore to shore, through slight irregularity in divergence, while still maintaining very closely their relative position in the middle of the river. The average number of lines of soundings per nautical mile was 21 where the survey was on the scale of 1-5000, 11 on 1-10000, 7 on 1-20000; the twenty-third mile, where the scales of 1-5000 and 1-10000 joined, having 16 lines. In computing the mean depth from these surveys, a paper scale was applied to each crosssectional line of soundings, beginning at low-water line on the right bank, and a depth read at each 200 feet throughout the 734 sections from Fort Miffiin to about the end of the forty-sixth mile, opposite Cohansey light-house. The sum of the depths thus obtained iu a cross-section, minus half the sum of the first and last reading at an even space, was multiplied by 200 and divided by the width of the section. In case of a fractional distance at the end of" a line the area of the fractional section was computed, and its area and length added to that of the previous spaces. From Cohansey light-house to Mahon's Ditch, that is, from the seven hundred and thirty-fifth to the seven hundred and seventy-fifth section, inclusiYely, where the survey was upon the scale of 1-20000, 400 feet spaces were used in computing the sections. In a few cases the lines of sounding8 on either side of an island were not coincident In obtaining a cross-section in these places the scale was extended across the sheet from one of the lines and the proportional depths used between adjacent lines of soundings on the prolongation. The half-tide area of cross-section was found by adding to the low-water area of the section the low-water width, multiplied by 3 feet, the half range of tide. To this snm was added the widths between low water and the 3-foot elevation multiplied by !· The 3-foot elevation is not designated always on the chart. In these cases the approximate half-tide width beyon(l the lowwater line was obtained by using half the di8tance from low water to high water where the bighwater line has been designated by recent snr\'eys, and where the new topographical survey is not con~pleted, an estimate of the strand was made from general knowledge of the shore line as defined by previous surveys. Beginning at Fort Miffiin light·house a mid-stream line was drawn upon the charts, upon which the rh·er was divided into nautical miles of 6,076 feet. The mean depth of each nautical mile was obtained by dividing the arithmetical mean of the areas of the cross-sections in each mile by the arithmetical mean of the widths of these sections. Tl1e last cross-section in each mile group was used as the first cross-section in the next mile group. From the extreme accuracy with which the bed of the river is developed by this survey any but a slight or proportional variation in the area or depth of adjacent sections attracted attention, aud such variation was found on re-examination of the section upon the chart to be due to some obvious natural peculiarity, either in the banks or the bed of the river.

RBPORT ON THE HARMONIC ANALYl:lH:i OF THE TI!IEIS AT /'ANDY HOOK
\VASIIINGTON, 1>. c., July :a, 188:\. SIR: I have the honor to submit to you the following report on the harmonic analy11is of the hourly co-ordinates of the heights of the tide at Sandy Hook for the ~·ean; 1876-1881, ineluHive. Tbe situation of the tide-station, with regard to the eutrauce to New York Harbor and the J1~·dro . grnphy of the vicinit~· are best understood from the a(~eompan,ving chart. Tlw homly co-ordinates were measured off from the curve,; of the self-registering tide-gauge in the tidal divisio11 of the office and furnished to me hy Mr. R S. Avery, the ellief of the tliYi8iou. The method of anal,vsis is precisely the same a:-i that adopted ltcn·tofore, a full account of which is given in my report on the Discussion of Tides in l'e1101Jscot Dar, coutaiued iu Appe11dix No. 11, report for 1878. Ernrytbing having beeu tltere given in detail with regard to methods, formulro, and auxiliary tables used iu tl1e reductions, illustrative examples, &e., it will be unnecessary to go over the whole ground again here; and for tbese tbiugs references will simply he made to that report. It will therefore only be necessan· to giYe in thi8 paper the coustantH for the se\·eral tirle components for each of the seYeral years, together with a few theoretieal deductions from them, interesting in connection with the geueral theory of the tides and trneful in explaining any local peculiarity in the type of the tide at the station and the cause of its variation from that of tides at other stations. The comparison of the constants for each of the several years gi,·es a verJ- good idea of the probable errors of the constants deduced from one year's 110ul'ly co-ordinates. From this it will be seen that a long series of observations, or of hourly co-ordina,teo; measnre(l from the curves, iH not necessary to obtain the constants with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes. The constants here given, with certain reductions of the epochs to adapt them to an.r giYeu year, will serve for all future time in the prediction of the 1ides for the statiou, either by computation or by means of the tide-machine, which, for this purpose, must be set iu accordance with these constants. I have the honor t:o be, very respectfully, yours, WILLIAM I1'ERREL. Prof. J.E. HILGARD, Superintendent United Stat.es Goa.st and Geo<letic Survey.

RESUL't'S OF THE HARMONIC ANALYSIS OF THE TIDES A.T SANDY HOOK.

The following are the amplitudes and epochs of the tide-components at Sandy Hook, with aJl the usual reductions applied. '\Yith these reductions the constants should be the same for each year, and hence the results of the several years are comparable.

Mean.

Tl1e range of the whole title at Saud.)· Hook being small, tlie most of the preceding· results are of little importance practically, or even in the study of the theoretical relation8. The analysis, however, bas been carried regular].)" through all the components for each of the six y(~:ll's. It will hardly be worth while to do this hereafter in any of the small-rauge tides along the coast south of Cape Cod on to the Gulf of Mexico. The first component of the mean lunar or M-tide is a true theoretical tide, but so small that it has been only imperfectly brought out in the analysis, as the scattering values of the epochs Fi for tlie several years indicate. The mean amplitude is only about one-third of au inch. 'l'lrn next one, of which the amplitude is A2, is the mean lunar tidal component, and is the principal one of all. The mean amplitude, 2.246 feet, is almost precisely the same as was obtained for Governor's Island from the discussion of the tides there b.v the old methods. The greatest difference between this and the amplitudes deduced for each ,rear h; 0111,r .o:w of a foot, or 0.3 of au inch. Hence either one of these amplitudes is sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. The epochs Ez are also brought out with great regulal'it,r. The other components of this tide are shallow-water components, and are vf\ry small and of no importance practically, though they are clearly brought out in the analysis, as the epochs, agreeing so nearl;y for so small components, indicate. The mean solar or S-tide is very small, not only absolutely, but relatively to the mean lunar tide, the amplitude A 2 of the principal component being less than one-fifth of that of the mean lunar tide. This is a peculiarity which is found along- our whole .Atlantic coast. The small component in the S-tide of which the amplitude is Ai, is a real component, and is well brought out in the analysis, as the nearly-agreeing values of both the amplitudes and epoohs for the several years show. The small shallow-water components, of which the amplitudes are AJ and A 4, are also clearly brought out, though they are very sruall. The K·tide is composed of a diurnal and of a semi-diurual component, the former beiug the principal of all the diurnal components. The amplitude of this, A,, is small, being onl,y 4 inches. S. Ex. 29--32

250

tJNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The smallness of all these diurnals components, it is known, is a peculiarity of the Atlantic tides. The semi-diurnal component is the declinational component of the semi-diurnal tide, and the amplitude is onl~· about 1.5 inches. The L-tide and N-tide form a pair of components depending upon lunar parallax. As the epochs differ nearly 180°, these are somewhat opposite to each other in their effects at the time of perigee and apogee of the moon. The amplitude of the latter, it is seen, is greater than that of the mean solar tide. It is a peculiarity of our tides, especially along the New England coast, that the parallactic inequality in the lunar tide is larger and of more importance than the whole solar semi-diurnal tide. The 0-tide and P-tide are also diurnal components still smaller than the diurnal component of the K-tide. The effect of these diurnal components is to cause a difference in the heights of the forenoon and afternoon tides of the same day when the moon is not on or near the equator, and also au inequality in the intern1l~ between high and low waters. The J-tide and Q-tide are also diurnal components, but the amplitudes of these tides at Sandy Hook are so small that the~' are of no practical importance, but the analysis shows that there are really such components. 'fhe shallow-water components of these tides, the amplitudes of the principal of which are A 4 and A 6 of the .M-tide and S-tide, and A.2 of the .l\IS-tide and 2 SM-tide, are very small, the amplitudes of none of them amounting to 0.05 of a foot, and hence are of no importance for practical purposes. The annual inequality, depending mostly upon meteorological causes, such as annual inequalities in the barometric iiressure and the winds, and also in the ocean currents, is much smaller at Sandy Hook than it is along the New England coast, aml the maximum, towards the last of July, is a little earlier. The following are the amplitudes and epochs of all the components which it is necessary to use in the prediction of tides, including ~tll the components of which the amplitudes, according to the preceding result, amount to one half tenth of a foot. These are given here, together with the designations of the components as eugrave1l on the tide-machine, for the convenience of application in settiug the machine.

The suffixes 1 and 2 to the designating letters of the components denote diurnal and semidiurual components respectively. 'l'be amplitudes and epochs of the components M2 , R 2, K 1, and 0 1 are affected by the inclination of the lunar orbit to the ecliptic, and the values given here are the mean values, such as we would have if the moon moved in the ecliptic. Before these are used they must be reduced to the value for the given year, by a process just the reverse of that given in the Discussion of Tides in Penobscot Bay, §§ 25 and 26, by which they were reduced from the values obtained from the analysis of each year's observation to the mean values. Besides these reductions all the epochs Inl!St be reduced to the given year by subtracting the corresponding numbers found in Table II of the paper just referred to.

From the theoretical relations for the three principal components given in~ 31 of that paper, we form in the same manner for the tides of Sandy Hook the following three relations for the diurnal components: .334 - 0.66 oµ = (.5306-13.l oµ) (1+.230 E) Ao .170 = (.3813 (1- .2.30 E) A 0 .103 = (.1730-13.6 oJ.1) (l+.196 E) Ao The solution of these equations gives oµ being .0125, this correction makes it

= .00047 and E = .7.53. The assumed mass of the moon .01297 = -A near!~-. Notwithsta11di11g the smallnes;; of the

amplitudes of the components forming the first members of the equations above, these theoretical relations give a mass of the moon, so far as we know, not much in error. The mass of tlic moon obtained in the same manner from the tides of J>ei1obscot Bay was

These gfre G =-0.25, which indicates that the maximum of the tide occm·o; ouc-fourth of a day before the maximum of the forces. This is an unusual result, hut eutll'ely i11 accordance with theory. From the relations of § 33 of the paper referred to we get for these tide"

The solution of these equations gives C= 1.10:18, E=-1.Hi7, and c~ ;1 = .00106. '\"ith this latter

the moon's mass. Tbe yalue of the constant c for Pe-

nobscot Bay, is 1.166. This constant being greater than unity indicates that the inequalities are smaller than the principal lunar component in proportion to the force, which is a result of friction diminishing large tides more iu proportion thall small ones. The value of E is negative aud very nearly the same as in Penobscot Bay. Upon the large negative value of this constant depends the peculiar t,ype of the semi-diurnal tide all aloug our coast, in which the solar tide is very small, and the lunar parallaetic inequalities very large. On this account the tides at Boston are 20 inches higher when the moon is in perigee than when it is in apogee, and there is about the same difference in Penobscot Bay. At Sandy Hook the difference in proportion to the whole range is about the same, but on account of the small range of the tides at the latter place, of course, the absolute difference is only about, half as great. From the relations of the first two equations of §34 of the 11aper referred to aborn we get for the Sandy Hook station 217.0=Lo
245.9 = L 0 + 24.4 G

These give G = 1.18, which indicates that the maximum of the semi-diurnal tide occurs 1.2 days nearly after the maximum of the forces, or after the conjunction of the mean moon and sun in the case of the lunar a.nd solar components.

DESCRIPTION 01'' A MAXIMA AND MINIMA TIDE-PHEDICTING MACHINE.
By VVILLI.A.M FEHREL.

W .ASHING1'0N, November 30, 1883. Sm: I have the honor t-0 submit the following report on the maxima and minima tide-pre-

dicting machine : I have thought it best to go Rornewhat into detail in presenting the theory, construction, and method of operating it, so that those who shall have to use it hereafter may be able to understand not merely rules and directions, hnt alRo 8omething of the mathematical theory upon which it is based. In a form suitable for determining the maxima and minima of the tides and their times of occurrence, the theory becomes rnncll more complex than in the case in which the co-ordinates of height are required for given timeR. Still it will be seen from the following report with what great facility and rapidity the required results can be obtained from this complexity by means of the machine, the time required being- little more than what is necessary for recording them. The mathematical theory within itself, regarded merely as a tidal paper, will not be without interest and value, for the formulre used in the machine are those ·best adapted to obtain the results accurately by computation. This, however, invokes so great an amonut of labor that it has been necessary heretofore t6 use more simple formula·, requiring mnch lrn;;s labor in computation, but which give often only very rough approximations to the true results. These can now be pretty accurately obtained with scarcely any labor. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, yours, WILLIAM FERREL. J. E. HILGARD, Esq., Superintendent Oo(JJjt and Geodetic Survey.
THE MAXIMA AND MINIMA TIDE-PUEDICTING MACHINE.
INTRODUCTION.

1. The first machiue for predicting tides was invented by Sir William Thomson about eight years ago. It was so con~tructed as to be run by clock-work and to give the tidal curve for a whole year or more on a long strip of paper wound on rollers. From this the height of the tide at any given time, or the times and heights of high aud low waters only, may be read oft'. This machine, it seems, has never been used in the regular prediction of tide.,, and i<! said to be now on exhibition at the South Kensington Museum. Subsequently Mr. E. Roberts, of the Nautical Almanac office, London, had another machine constructed upon nearly the same plan, but larger and with some improvements introduced. This machine has been successfully used for several rears in predicting the tides of the principal commercial ports of India. A description of this machine was published in The Engineer of

December 19, 1879.

UNITED STATES OOAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

The general principles allll the plan upon which these machines ha\'C been constructed may be explained as follows: The height of the tide, h, at auy given time, t, is expressed by a series of harmonic terms of the following form :
(1)
h =Ho+ A1 cos (i1 t

+ ci) + A2 cos (i2 t + Cz) + &c.= Ho+ ::E Ae COS (ie t +Ce)

in which
Ho A0
C6

= the height of mean tide aboYe an assumed plane, = the amplitude of any component of which the characteristic is c,
=the Yalue of the angle at any origin oft, as midnight, January 1, = the rate of change of the angle.

i0

The number of components in the expression of h, if we iuclndc "Very small terms, is Yery great; hnt the numuer of those which are of any practical importance is generally only about fiftetm or twenty, often less. The Yalues of 'i. are obtained from astl'onomical d<welopments, and the~, depend upon the known periods aud other elements of the lunar aud terrestrial orbits and the iieriod of the earth's rotation on its axis. The values of Ac and Ce liave to be obtained for each tide station from an analysis of the hourly rnlues of 71, for a ;rear or more, obtained directly from obserratiou, or from the curves of a self-registering tide-gauge. The method of doing this has been given in detail in Appenclix No. 11, Heport of Coast ancl Geodetic Survey for 1878. '\Yitll the values of thMe constants for any given station, and the known values of i 0 , the values of hat any given time t, can be computed from the preceding expression. The amount of labor, however, involved in such a computation for fiftf\en or twenty components it is readily seen is very great. The times and heights oftLe maxima an<l minima of h cannot be directly computed, since tho time or value oft in tbe expression of h for high or low water is not known, l>ut is one of tile tliings required. To obtain this, therefore, it is necessary to compute several hourly co-ordinates near this time, wLich ii,; always approximately known, and then from these the maxima or minima aml the time of its taking place can be obtained by well-known methods. 2. By the machines of Sir \Villiam Thomson aud Mr. Roberts the function his represented graphically by means of the tide curve, in which the co.ordinates are the times t and the heights h. The summation of the effects of the s1weral components upon the value of h at any time is accomplished in the following manner: Let a fine chain or very flexible wire be fastened at one end as at a, Pig. 1, Plate I, and pass oYer the pulleys 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. If tliese pulleys are attached to cranks and axles, at1 rt-presented Oil Plate II, and these axles are made to turn by means of machinery in periods which haYe the same relations to one another as the periods in the compo· neuts of h iu the preceding expression, and the centers of the pulleys are thrown out on the cranks at distances from the center which ha\·e the same relatious to one another as the amplitudes A 0 of the several components, and the initial augles, or directions of the cranks from the centers, correspond witll the angles c., at the epoch or time oft= o, then, if the machinery is kept in motion, the other end of the ebain, at b, describes upon paper wound off on cylinders, kept turning also in connection with the n·~t of the machinery, a curve b, c, d, c, f, &c., which represents the tide curve. l~rom this ctuYe the heights of high and low waters, f, e, d, &c., above any assumed plane, which is usually that of mean low water, as represented by gh in Fig. 1, can be measured, and the approximate times of high aml low waters cau be estimated b,v the abscissas on the line git, which are in proportion to the time. If only one of the pulleys were thrown out from the center, say that of the mean lunar semidiurnal component, which is generally much larger than any of the others, w6 should then have a regular curn~ b, c', d', &c., following the law of cosines, and the heights of all high and all low watBrs would bl~ the same and their times would be at regular intervals of 12 lunar hours. The efiect of all the other comparatively small components is to distort the regularity of the curve, causing the heights of both high and low waters to differ at different times and the high and low waters to occur at irregular intervals.

UNITED STATES OOAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

255

If there are one or more diurnal components superimposed ~·pon the semi-diurnal, the effect is to cause considerable differences between the two high or the two low waters of the same day, and also to cause great irregularities in the interYals of high and low waters of the same day, as represented by the curve/, e, d, c, &c., in ·Fig. 1. The distances between each of tl1e cranks arnl pulleys from the points of suspension as of (1) from (a,) and (2), or (2) from (1) and (3), Fig. l, must be so great in comparison with the distances to which the pulleys are thrown out from the center that the dc,iation from parallelism of the
strands of chain or wire between the pulleys will not affect srnsilily the measured distances. The pulley, therefore, belonging to the mean lunar semi-diurnal compouent, say pulley (1) in Fig. I, should lie at a considerable distance from the points of snspension, (a) and (2). Of course tJ1e arrangement of the pulleys and distances apart may be rnrie<l in an infinite number of wa;ys to snit best the space to be occupied by them, and the effect and the principles in-rnlved will remain the same. In Mr. Roberts' machine the pnlleyR are not swnng around on cranks, hut are made to oscillate vertically by means of pins which are thrown out 011 the crauln' to their proper di::;tances, and which work in grooves of horizontal beams to which the pnlhiys are attaehell. Of course, with thi::; arrangement, the strands are alwa.ys parallel, and distance from the points of susperniion need not come into consideration. In Sir William Thomson's machine only ten of the larger componrnts are taken into account These, however, are all that are of much practical importance gern·rally, e1'peciall.Y if the rauge of the tides is 11ot ver.r great. 111 J\Ir. Roberts' machine twenty c01upo11ents are provided for, lint the amplitudes of some of these are RO sma11, evpn in tides of large range, that they are of little importance taken separately, but still the rer;nltant of all these, together with all the numerous components which are necessarily neglected, may be considerable. 3. The plan of the maxima and minima tide-predicting machine is very different from that of the machines just referred to, though comprising some of their features. Tho clock-work and the graphic representation of the tide on paper are <1ispenseL. with. 'l'Lc machinery is run b_y the left hand, by means of a crank at the side of the maclliue, and the heights of high and low waters and the times of their occurrence are reau from the face of the instrument, as the~- are reached in turning, awl recorded by the right hand iu lilauks ready for the printer. It does not give the intervening heights of the tide, at least directly from the face, and it is therefore called the maxima and minima predicting machine. The theory and plan of this machine were first submitted to the Superintendent of the r nited States Coast and Geodetic Survey in the spring of 1880. It received a favorable consideration, and tlie construction of a machine upon the plan submitted was at once decided upon. A paper was also read in the followiug August beforetbe Amnican Association for the AdY:1ncement of Science ill session at Boston, Mass., in which the theory and plan were briefly explained. There were various delaysin engaging a mechanist anrl in making all the preliminary arrangements for the construction of the machine. It was finally undertaken by :Fituth & Co. of this city, under the supervision of Mr. G. N. Saegmuller, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The work, however, was not commenced until late in the summer of 1881, and it -was not completed until the fall of the next year.

approximation is generally sufficient, yet as the expressions of (6) usually comprise fifteen or twenty terms, the amount of computation for each of the four diurnal values of r is very great. 5. The value of ({J - fl') is generally so small, especially in the Atlantic tides, that its cosine can be put equal to unity, and then (10) becomes
(11)

H=Ho::I:: R.

It is Reen from (3) ancl (6) that the amplitudes of the.components in the expressions difler by This for all the semi-diurnal components differs little from unit;r, but for the dinrnal components in which ie is only about one-half of i 1, this factor differs but little from onebalf of unity. Hence the differences between Mand Nin (3) and those of 1\1' and N' in (6), and consequently the difference between fJ and Ji', depends almost entirely on the diurnal components, for the quarter-diurnal and other components of short period, in which the factor i. : i 1 is greater than unity, are generally very small. In the Atlantic tides, therefore, in which the diurnal components are very small, the angle (f:J - ft') is likewise small. In the Gulf of Mexico, however, and on the Pacific coast of North America, where the diurrml components are very large in comparison with the semi-diurnal, the value of (fl - f:J') may be very large, even approximating to 180o. When it is greater thau 90° the last term of (10) changes sign, aud one high water is below mean level, or one low water above it. 6. In (10) the values of R, jJ and fi' to be used are those corresponding to t = r in (6) and (8), r being the time of high or low water. But it is seen by comparing (10) and (11) that this value of R in the latter is too great to give the true high or low water, and that it requires to be multiplied into cos (f:J - f:J'). It becomes important, therefore, to determine at what time R has a value so as to make (11) strictly correct, so as to dispense with the factor cos ({J - /J') in (10). Putting Rr for the value of Rat the time t = -r, we must, for this purpose, have

This time is at equal intervals from r aud r". It must be remembered, however, that this cannot be used, except approximately, if fl- fl'= i1 (r" -_r') iH so large that unity cannot be used for its cosine and the arc for its sine. 7. From what precedes it is necessary to compute the times of high andJow waters T from (8) and (9), which implies the computation of M' and N' in (6), which, as has been stated, requires a secoud or third approxin;iation, since the value oft to be used in (6) is that of 7' 1 which is the quantity sought. With this value, however, when obtained, and the value of 11' already obtained, (3), (5) and (10) give directly the value of H, the height of high or low water. For a very numerous class of titles, however, embracing nearly all those of our Atlantic coast, in which, on account of the smallness of the diurnal components, the values of M and N, (3) and those of M' and N' (Ci), and consequently the values of Rand fi and those of R' and fl', differ but little in the two sets of formulre, we can, at a very small sacrifice of accuracy, so small as to be of no importance, adopt oompromise formulre which will answer for both, and from which ooth the times and heights of high and low waters may be computed. If for the values of M and N, or for those of M' and N' we put M" + oM" and N" + oN", oM" and oN" being small corrections of M" and N" t;o get the true values, and if we also put oR" and oft" for the corresponding corrections of R" and fl" the new values of R and 13, we get from the denilopment of the expression (5) or (8), neglecting quantities of the third and lower orders,

In the case of [31 in (6) the error of M 11 , or oM", would be (JI.I - M'), and the value of o ,~" in this case would be more accurately given by (18z), using this value, than by (2h), but since, as has been explained, a small error in M' bas a very little effect u1l0n the value of {1', in the class of tides here considered, (202) can be used in this case also without much error. From (32) and (62) we get
(2~)

Since the values of ie are very nearly the same for all the semi-diurnal components, and consequently differ but little from i 1 (33 ), this makes the terms in (21) depending upon the semi-diurnal components very nearly vanish, and since the values of ie for the diurnal components are very nearly equal to~ i 1, the value of the factor Ue : i 1 is very nearly ~· The value of (N - N') therefore depends almost entirely upon the diurnal components, and hence when the amplitudes A 0 of these are small (N -N') must be small, and, consequently, the corrections or errors given by (21) are small. 8. From (3) and (8) we get approximately, for the kind of tides here considered!
(23)
8 r:i1 N-N' I-,., =-1-{-

Hence by (21) the value of (P-P 1) depends almost entirely upon the diurnal components, and is small where these are small, and sensibly vanishes when they vanif!h. With the values of M, N, and M', N', and by means of these the values of M", N", and o M" and o N", (5) gives with M 11 and N 11 instead of Mand N, the value of lV', and then (21) gives the amount of error in the heights and times pertaining to the compromise formulre. The amplitude of the maximum luna.r diurnal tide at Boston Harbor is 0.58 feet. This occurs when the maxima· of the two lunar component5 coincide about the time of greatest declination. Hence by (22) we shall have, so far as these two components are concerned, N - N' = ± 0.2!.l feet at the maximum. The mean maximum value of N is 1.0 feet nearly, and R" = 5 feet approximately. With these data (20) gives o R", equal about one-third of an inch for the error in the heights, aud o ~"=0.03 in arc iu terms of the radius corresponding to io,7 in are, or about 3.5 minutes in time for the error in the times of high or low water. The effeet of the solar diurnal tide i11 summer and winter would be about one-third of this, which would sometimes combine with the lunar diurnal components and increase the effect a little, but at other times counteract and diminish it. The preceding .may be regarded as the mean of the maximum errors of the compromise formulai for all the large-range tides along the New England coast. At New York Harbor the value of R" is about 2.23 feet; and the mean maximum value, as at Boston about t R 11 · The amplitude of the mean maximum of the diurnal title here is 0.43 feet, aud hence N - N' =:I:: 0.21 feet. With these values (20) gives o R" = 0.26 inch, and o fi = .048 in arc, corresponding to about 5 minutes in time for the mean maximum of the errors of the compromise formulre, the former for those of the heights and the latter for the times of high and lowwaters in New York Harbor. In the same manner the formulm can be t.ested for each tide station. It is probable that the error for none of the stations of the Atlantic coast would amount to as much as a half inch in the heights, b~t in the short range flat tides the times might be in error ten minutes or more. This latter, however, is an error more in appearance than in realit;r, for the heights for ten minutes before or after high or low waters, do not change one-tenth of an inch, even with an amplitude of tide as great as in New York Harbor. If in (19) we put N" N' instead of i (N N'), it will give the times accurately, with a very small increase of the error in the heights, which would still be too small to be of any consequence in most, if not all, of our Atlantic tides. Or the value of N" can be so taken as to throw a little of the enor in the times, bnt Jess than that given by (19). In the short range semi-diurnal tides of the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific coast, with diurnal tides which have comparatively a very large rangt'I, the compromise values of (19) cannot be used, but in such tides the values of the times must be obtained from (8) and (9), and then with these

the heights obtained from (3), (5), and (10). With the values, however, oft aud r" from (9) and (15), we get that of -r 1 from (16), which in (3) and (5), gives Rt 1, with which (17) gives H, thus dispensing with the factor cos (P - ;'1 ) in (10). This, however, in computation would involve a vast amount of labor for so small a matter, but iu the mechanical solution of the problem it will be seen that it can be done in an instaut of time. It rarely happ~ns that (17) cannot be used with sufficient accuracy, but sometimes the value of (11-/3') becomes such that unity cannot be used instead of its cosine or the arc instead of its sine, and then (17) is not strictly correct, since these restrictions of the value of (13-p') were int.roduced in obtaining that expression of H. In such cases (10) :nust be used, but they only oocur when R or Rr are very small, and the height of high or low water is very nearly that of mean level, and the value of /3-/3 1 ) anfl the times of high or low waters are somewhat uncertain on account of the tide wave being very fiat. But the whole value of R cos (/1-/3') in (10) is then very small. 9. So far we have gone upon the hypothesis that the amplitude of the resultant of two or more tide components, superimposed upon one another, is equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the several components. This, however, is Ite\'er strictly the case, and the amplitude of the resultant is often considerably less than this snm. This is due to the fact that friction is not proportioned to the velocity, but to a power of the velocity somewhere between the first and second powers. The efteet of this is to diminish large tides more in proportion than the smaller ones, and consequently to cause the amplitude of the large tides to be smaller, and of the small tides to be larger, than they would be if the effect of friction were proportional to the amplitude and velocities. In the variations of amplitude of the resultant of one principal component and a number of smaller ones, the preceding effect of friction is the same as if the amplitude of each of the smaller components was diminished by a certain amount when superimposed upon the larger and principal component, so as to have the phases coincide. But when the phases differ 900, the amplitude of the resultant is very nearly that of the principal component, and we then simply have the average effect of friction, and the effect of the smaller component in changing the times of the maxima and minima is that of the component with undiminished amplitude. Hence, this effect of friction does not affect the times of high and low waters of tbt1 resultant ticle, but simply causes a little flattelling where one or more of the smaller components are superimposed upon the principal component. In the tides of Boston Harbor, from an analysis and discussion of nineteen years of observations, it was found that this effect of friction on high and low waters was that which would be caused by a diminution of the amplitudes of the smaller components when superimposed upon the principal one, in the ratio of 1 to .634. In New York Harbor, from the same number of observations, this ratio was found to be as 1 to . 75, or a diminution of one-fourth. At Brest, however, the eft'ect was found to be very small. Of course, it depends very much upon depth of wat.er and other local circumstances. In the form of the tidal expression in (4) the preceding effect of friction is taken into account pretty nearly, especially where N is small, by decreasing the amplitudes Ae in the expression of M in (3), where the ratio of reduction is known from a discussion of observations. It is seen from (5) that the amplitude R of the resultant tide, when N is small, as it generally is in our Atlantic tides, depends mostly upon M. Where the exact ratio of reduction is not known it is best to diminish these amplitudes a little, for a better agreement of computation with observation is generally ob· tained when this is done. It should be remarked here that the amplitudes A 0 of the smaller components, comprising all except the mean lunar and principal one, as--obtained by the harmonic analysis of hourly co-ordinates, are diminished by one-half the maximum effect, which occurs when their phases coincide with that of the principal component, since these amplitudes are obtained from measurements for a.II the difterent relations between the phases. The amplitudes, therefore, which are to be used in (3) should be a little Jess than those in the expression of M, but as much great.er in that of N. From an actual comparison of computation with observations of the heights and times of high and low waters at Boston Harbor, it has been found that the expressions of (10) and (9) will not give both aceura.t.ely unless the values of Ae in the expression of M in (3) are one-third less than the values which have to be used in the expression of N, to give the times correctly.

MECHANICAL SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM.

261

10. In order to obtain the times r of lligh or low waters from (!l) it. is necessar~· first to determine the angle fi'. Tl.tis is given by the geometrical construction of a rig-ltt-augled triangle c m' n', Fig. 2 1 Plate I, in which cm'= 1\-1' and m' n' = N' in (6), as is seen from the expressions of (8). By comparing the expressions of M1 and N' in (6) with that of h in (1) it is seen that the~· are similar except that the expression of N1 has sines instead of cosines and has no constant term corresponding to that of Ho in (1) or that of A 1 in the expression of M1 in (6). The Yalne of M', therefore, at any time t may be obtained mechanically by the same method as that by which It in (1) is obtained, as explained in the iutroductiou. Since the number of variable terms and the periods in the expression of N' are the same as those in the expression of M', its value can be obtained mechanicall,y in the same way by having a chain passing o>er pulleJ·s on cranks at the other end of the same axles, and placing tbe8e crauks at right angles to the former, so as to girn the function represented by sines instead of that of cosines. In .Fig. 2, Plate I, let cm' =M' be the co-ordinate given at any time by the part of the machine adapted to co8iiies, just as It is given by 1\fr. Roberts' machine, the part co being the amplitude A 1 of the mean lunar and principal semi-diurnal component, and om' the resultant of all the other terms iu the expression of M', comprisiug all the other, generally much smaller, components. Also let m' n' = N' be the other co-ordinate at any given time, t, given by the part of the machine adapted to the sines. lu order to obtain mechanicall.)' the value of the angle /i'=m'c n', it is necessal'.)· to have au arrangement by which the values of :M:' aud N' are not only represented by linear measures, but also that these measures be given on lines at right angles, as on lines in the direc. tions of cm' ancl rn'n'. The point n' then determines the direction of the line c n', and the angle rn' c n' =/11, which can be measured on the circle f de a, counting from the point f. In order to this, iustead of a pen or pencil, as at b, Fig. 1, oscillating vertically alwve the line of mean level, we must have a horizontal bar with a slit in it oscillating vertically above and below the point o, b~ rneans of a sliding frame, as represented in Fig. 3, Plate I, this frame being controlled by the chain from tl1e cranks adapted to t,he cmiines and conuected with the frame at the point e. Tlie mere weight of the frame gives the chain sufficient tension. 'rhe spiwc c m' re1>reRents the ,-alue of M' at any time and is one of the co-ordinates which determines the point. n'. If now we. have another bar with a slit in it placed vertically a!Hl oscillating horizontally about the central line c rn' b.Y means of a sliding frame, as represented, with the chain passing over the pulleys 011 the cranks adapted to the sines and attached to the frame at b, the distance m' n' will be the measure of the other co-ordinate N', and the intersection of the two slits determines the position of the point n' and of the line c n'. The frame moYing horizontally must have a chain attached to it on the other side, which passes over some fixed pulley and has a. weight suspended which gives it sufficient tension. Since the expression of N' has no constant term the point n' will fall equally on different sides of the central line cm', and consequently the value of /3' may be either positive or negative. If, while the machinery is in motion giving at difierent times different positions of the line c n' and values of the angle /1', there is an index cc, Fig. 2, made to turn around the center c in each lunar lialf day, the motions of the axles and cranks being arranged in accordance with this measure of time, the angle described by the ·index c e in the time twill be i 1 t, and the degrees as measured on the circle f counting from j, will be i 1 t+c1, if the index is set at the time t=o, as oh of January 1, so as to make the angle f dbe=<h, the phase of the mean lunar semi-diurnal component in (1). Whence coincides with cf we have i1 t+c1=n ir, or i 1 t=n 7l'-c1, the value of n being o, or any integral number equal to twice the number oflunar half days which ham elapsed since the epoch. The values oft given by this equation for any integral value of n, are the times of the high waters of the mean lunar semi-diurnal tide, and they must necessarily oceur at regular eqnal intervals of time. But the times r of high or low waters are determined by the condition of (9), and hence they occur at the times when ce is in conjunction with ca or with ca produced back to b, since in the former case the condition of (9) is satisfied for even values of n, and in the latter for the odd values, corresponding to the low waters. Hence the times of high or low waters are determined mechanically by simply watching the conjunctions of the lunar index ce with ca, or with ca pro·

de.a,

262

duced back, and notiug the times. Hence we see with what great facility and little labor these times can be determined mechanically, whereas by computation, we have seen, the amount of labor is immense, involving the computation of M' and N' from (6) for fifteen or twenty terms for assumed Yalues of t in seYeral approximations. We have a case similar to this, though comparatively very simple, in the determination of the time when the hour and minute hand of a clock come together. A novice in analysis might be puzzled to determine it analytically, but to do it mechanically all be bas to do is to turn the minute band until it comes in conjunction with the hour hand, and then read off the time from the dial. With the same facility are the times of high and low water determined b;r the method explained above. The principle involved in the determination of r~ both b;y computation and mechanically, is the Eutme. In the computation we proceed with a series of assumptions and veriftca;tions until an assumption of t is made which satisfies (9) with sufficient accuracy. So each part of the motion of the machine is an assumption which has to be ,-erified, but as the machine makes all the computa· tions simultaneously with the assumptions, all we have to do is to continue the motion until the Yerification takes place, which is when ce comes in conjunction with ca, or ca produced back, for theu, as we have seen, the condition of (9) is satisfied. It should be obsen·ed here that for the couditions of (9) to be satisfied when the conjunctions take place, it is necessary, since /3 1 in (9) has the negative sign, that the positive values of N' should be to the left in Fig. 2, in the direction of rn' n'. Since the index ce performs a revolution each lunar half day, any arrangement for reading off the time from the circle f d e a would necessarily have to give lunar time. In order to have the solar time, therefore, it is necessary to have a second index, cd, called the solar index, the motion of which has such a relation to that of ce as to reduce the lunar to solar time. When the lunar index occupies such a position as to make the angle frlbc=ci. as at the time of the epoch, or t=o, then cd should coincide with cf and denote Oh of solar time. As cc moves around toward ca or ca produced back, cd moves a little faster and points out the time elapsed in solar time, and when cc comes in conjunction with ca or ca produced back, it indicates the time of high or low water in solar time. 11. Having the time r, (10) gives the value of II, and this requires the solution mechanically of the expressions of M and Nin (3) and of the right-angled triangle by (5), which is done in preciHely the same manner as in tlte case of :l\l' and ·N' in (6) and of the right-angled triangle in (8). In the former case we needed [3', one of tlie angles of the triangle, but in tltis case we need the hypothenuse H. This value is needed at the times t=r; and hence its value must be read off at the times r, and muUiplied into cos ((3-;1'), if this varies sensibly from unity. By comparing the expressions of M and N in this case with those of M' and N' it is seen that the only change to be made is to throw the pulleys out on the cranks in accordance with the amplitudes Ae instead of Ae
i1

!~'

and this, unless great accurac,Y is required, needs a change only

iu the amplitudes of the diurnal components, since for the others the factor ie: i 1 diffors but little from unity. Jn this case, instead of the co-ordinates M' and N', represented in Fig. 2 by cm' and rn' n', we haYe Mand N represented by cm and mn, differing but little from the others unless the diurual components are large. The angle /3 is determined mechanically by observing the value of the angle m c n, Fig. 2, at the time of conjunction of the index ce with ca', just as [3' is, by observing the value of the angle m' c n' at the time of conjunction with ca. When (11 - fJ') does not exceed 300, or the times of the two conjunctions differ more than about one hour of time, which they rarely do, formula (17) can be used, which requires that the ,·alue of R be observed at the time r' given by (16). The timer having been observed and recorded in determining the times of high and low waters with the first settiugof the machine, after the small change has bern made in the setting for getting the heights, the value of r" is the time of conjunction of ce with ca', and then at half the interval of time from r" to r is the time of readin~ the value of R. This, by (17), applied to Ho gives H, the height of high or low water sought. For convenience there must be an arrangement by which the distance R is measured on some scale togetlier with the constant Ho, so that the value of H can be read directly from the scale by,means of au index.

Where (19) is used, as it may in most of our Atlantic tides, the machine is set at the start for both the times and heights of high and low waters, and both are read at the time of conjunction of the index ce with a line, indicated by the mMhine, which falls intermediate at equal intervals from ca and ca'. This time, therefore, corresponds with the time given by (16), which is the time of reading the value of R, where (17) is used.

These components are mostly the same as those given in Schedule I of the Discussion of Tides in· Penobscot Bay, Appendix No. 11: of the li~port of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1878. A few of the very small components gi\ren there are omitted, and two others, considered.of more importance, and designated by~ and 2' 1 bave been added. The former is one of a pair of smalli components depending upon the lunar declination and perigee which, on account of the small Yalue of i., gives a sensible tide along our Atlantic coast, although the coefficient of the corresponding term in the development of the tidal forces is small and would not give a sensible tide with an ordinary value of ie. The other, Q' 11 depends upon the solar elJipticity of orbit, and has a value of i very nearly ~ ~' and it is found, in the analysis of tide observations, to give. often a very sensible component. The component designated by S' is an annual inequality in the heights of the tides arising from an annual inequality of mean level, due almost entirely to meteorological causes, and is generally found to have an amplitude of two or three inches. The value of ie given in the table for this component is the diurnal rate of change of angle. Besides the components in the preceding table, the four components in the schedule referred to above, designated by M'1 and M'3 in the semi-diurnal components, in which the values of i., are almost the same as th08e of M 2 and K, in the preceding table, and the two diurnal components designated by M 13 and M'6 , of which the values of i., are very nearly the same as those of K 1 and 0 1 above, are combined with the components in the preceding table which have nearly the same values of ie and consequently nearly the same period. These components with periods differing very little from

others arise from the slow motion of the moon's node. To take them into the a-0count with the others it is onl,f necessary to change the amplitudes and epochs a little for the sernral years of the nodal period, for which tables will be given. There are, therefore, these four otller components also taken into account, but not by means of separate axles and cranks. The suffixes 1, 2, 3, &c., to the letters of designation of the several tide components in the preceding table indicate, respectively, diurnal, semi-diurnal, &c., components. 13. In any machine for the solution of equatiorr (1), the periods of revolution have to be diurnal, semi-diurnal, &c., the hourly rates of change of the anglei; being i 0 given in the preceding table. But it is seen from (3) and (6) that the hourly rates of change of the angles are u 0 ~ which by the preceding table are comparatively very small for the semi-diurnal components~ so that instead of semi-diurnal periods we have only monthly and half monthly periods. The mechanical solution of the equation, therefore, a8 transformed in (4) requires comparatively very slow motions of the machinery for the semi-diurnal components. For the diurnal components, however, we still have the diurnal priods. It is also seen from (3) a11d (6) that for the mean lunar and principal semidiurual component we llave simply the constant A 17 needing no axle and cranks, so that these are required for the components only which are generally very small in comparison, and which can be regarded simply asperturbations of thh; principal component. 14_ In the coustruction of the part of the machine containing the axles, cranks, and pulleys, and the wheel-work most directly connected with them, two brass plates, 16 inches wiile and ~2 inches in height, are placed in a vertical position about 2.5 inches aJlart, the edges of which ab an<l a' b' are seen in Plate II, which is a side view of the machine, the front being on the right. A hack and front view of these plates are seen on Plates III and IV, with all unnecessary parts cut out, lea\'ing simply a framework to support the wheels and axles. An axle for each tide-component with crank and pulley at each end, as represented in perspective at the bottom of Plate II, is supported by these plates, and is connected by wheel-work with an axle in the front part of the machine, moved by a crank at the side. This connection is such as to give the exact relative period of revolution to each axle witl.t cranks attached. Commencing at a small stationary pulley at o, Plate III, a light chain passes over the stationary pulle.rs d and e until it arrives at the pulley of the tide-component at f, and then, passing successively over all the pulleys, first up and then down, around the large e.entral space cut out of the supporting i1lates, it comes to the pulley of the Jast component at g, and then, paseing over several stationary pulleys, it comes to h, where it is connected with the upper part of the sliding frame moving vertically, a small part only of which is visible on Plate IIL but is all represented in Fig. 3, Plate I. The horizontal slit in the bar of this frame determines the one side cm. or cm' of the right-angled triangle, the former if the machine is set according to the amplitudes in (3) and the latter if set according to those of (6). When the pulleys are all at the center the adjustment must be so made by turning the pulley c, Plate III, by an arrangement for that purpose, that the height of the horizontal slit shall correspond with A1, which is determined by means of an index attached to the chain and small scale just above c, uot visible. Commencing again at the point a, on Plate IV, which is a representation of the back brass plate and the pnlle;ys on the cranks on the other end of the axles, a chain passes in the same manner over all the pulleys until it comes around to b, and then by d and e to the side of the frame sliding horizontally, only parts of which are seen on this plate, but all is seen in Fig. 3, Plate I, the connection of the chain with it being at b on the right of this front view of it. The slit in the vertical bar of this frame, oscillating horizontally, determines in the right-angled triangle of Fig. 2, or Fig. 3, the other side m n or m' n' according as the machine is set to the amplitudes of Nin (3) or N' in (6). In these expressions there are no constants corresponding to .A1 in those of Mand M', and hence, when the pulleys are all thrown in to the center, the adjastment must be such that the vertical slit oecupiel'I a central position, corresponding to the point c, in Fig. 2, Plate I and Plate IV. The arrangement with regard to the distances between each pulley and the two from which it is suspended is such that those belonging to the tide components K, Sz, Ni, &c., which have the largest amplitudes, are farthest from the points of suspension, so that the measurements may not be sensibly aftected from a want of parallellsm of the strands of chain with a vertical line. The

axles aud pulle,ys of all the smaller tide-cornpoumits are placed abo\·e with c<irr·espondingl~· short spaces between. The two pulleys from which Si is 8uspe11de'l are larger tlm11 tlte otLerH iu order that K1, 82, and Nz, which ge11erall.r have large amplitudes, may Lave a wider spaee to swing in extreme cases. 15. The value of H in (5), (10), and (17), correspouding to en, Fig. 2, Plate I, is giYell by tlw distance of chain en of Plate IV. The end of a fine cLaiu attached to the end ot a vi11 controlled -by the two sliding frames, a11d kept at the iutersectiou of the two slitti, and always represe11ti11g the point nor n' in Fig. 2, Plate I, passBs .through a small e,ye or central hole at c of Plate IY, and then over several pulleys in tLe interior of tile machine, and coutroL,,; the Yertical nHffc111c11t of the index on the left side of Plate V, wLich is a perspecti\·e view of the front arnl left side of the machine as finished. As the distance between c and n i11creases or decreases the index rises m· falls the same amount on the scale, from which is read oft the height of high or low water, the former 011 the left part and the latter on the right part of the scale, the negative direction of the latter beiug upward. As these readings are generally from some plane below mean level, as that of mean low 'vater~ wLich is represented by Ho 111 the preceding expression of' II, the zero of the left scale must be throwu dowu by that distance, and the other as much up. For this purpose the s!'ales are made adjustable by means of a small toothed wheel betweeu the scales, b.)· which, when the left scale is thrown down, tLe other is tLrowu up just as much. The construction of the machine is such that for tides of large range, uot exceeding about 1!.! feet, a foot of tide corresponds to an inch of the scale. The scales, howeYer, ha\'C a double graduation, in which in the one a foot of tides corresponds to !.! inches of' the scale, so that tides of smaller range, not exceeding about 6 feet, uHt.)' be read from this scale, the pulley8 in this case being thrown out twice as far 011 the cranks for the same amplitudes. If, howeYcr, the rtmge of the tide is very great, the half amplitudes must be used iu setting, and the readings from the scale of closest graduation, must then be doubled. 16. The whole machinery is moved with the left hand by means of a crank represented on the left side of the machine in Plate V, and on the right side of l'late IV in a back view. This crank turns a horizontal axle passing from side to side, mostly visible in the lower part of the front view. Ey means of a connection between this axle and two upright shafts k and l, Plate III, the one on the left, k, is made to turn twice in a lunar day, and the one on the right, z, once in tt lunar day. By means of a connection of three wheels and an endless screw between the shaft k and each Of the axles of the semi-diurnal tide-components, which are all arranged on that side, each of tl1ese axles is made to turn in its proper relative period with regard to that shaft, which is giyen in the preceding table. The numerators and denomiuators of the fractions representing these relations very nearly are the number of teeth in the wheels used in making the connections, the unity of the one fraction being represented by the endless screw. The connections on the other side between l and each of the axles of the diurnal and other components, which are all arranged on that side, are made by means of four wheels, of which the number of teeth correspond with the numerators and denominators of the fractions, representing the relations wiry uearlJ between the rnotiou of the u1iright shaft and each of the axles of the components. The relations between the proper motions of these axles and the shaft on the other side are given in the preceding table, aud therefore t.o get the relations to the other shaft, since it turns only one-half as fast, the relatious in the table must be doubled, which is done by omitting the fraction 1· The parts of the true relations which are not satisfied in these connections are given by the decimal added to the other fractious iu the table. The amount of' error in degrees of the indices of the several component::;, which are represented on Plate IV, is found by multiplying these decimals int-0 280,934 and tLc number of hours the machine has run. The amount of error for one year is given in the last column of the table. By placing the relations of the cranks for cosines and sines differently for positive and negatiYc angles, it has been arranged to have all the indices turned in the same direction, aud the sigus of the errors given indicate gain or loss in the motion of the indices without regard to the sigus of the original angles. The absolute errors in the heights of the tides arising from these errors of course depend upon the amplitude of the component. In our .Atlantic tides, iu which the amplitudes of the solar and

all the other components except the lunar are leiss than 1 foot, except at Eastport, and the diurnal amplitudes eve,rywherc are especially small, the machine might be rm! through ten years and the error in any one component would not amount to 1 iuch in the heights of the tides, though of course the errors of several might combine and make the whole error more than that. Ou the Pacific coast, where the diurnal components are very large, on account of the less accuracy of the relation in Oh the machine could not be run nearly so long without incurring tlie same amount of error. 17. Just in front of the two slirling frames is a lever turning- on the central point of the machine, represented by e in the back view of Plate IV, which contains a grooYe, in which one end of the pin at the intersection of the two slits of the sliding frames moves up antl down and always controls its direction, so that it always has a direction corresponding to en or en' of Fig. 2, Plate I. By means of a connection of wheel-work the needle on the face of the dial, Plate V, always has the same direction as en or en' or the lever behind. Hence the angle between this needle and the vertical, which can be read in lunar time or in degrees from the graduated circles, is that cor responding to 11 or fr' in Fig. 2, Plate I. The index on the dial, Plat.e V, pointing to the left a little below the figure 9, and corresponding to ee in Fig. 2, Plate I, is the lunar index already explained in § 10. The other index pointing to 12, and corresponding to ed in Fig. 2 is the solar index, which indicates the solar time. When this points t-0 12, and tlie small index directly below the center points downward, it is mill night; but if the small index points upward, it is noon. Although the lunar index moves according to lunar mean time, yet it does not point out this time on the dial, hut indicates the phases of the mean lunar tide, and the high water of this ti<le occurs when the index points to 12. It consequcntly'points out the lunar time which has elapsed since the last high water of the mean lunar semi-diurnal tide. The ratio between the motions of the solar and the lunar index is that of

28-~184104 =snx-Hi9 very nearly. The latter is so nearly correct that the error iu the reduction of lunar to solar time amounts to only about one minute in two years. The fractious in the seeond uumber, expressing thi8 important relation, wtwe discovered here independently, but it was afterwards found that they hacl !Jeen previously discoYere<l hy Mr. Roberts. The wheel-work, with the number of the teeth corre1ipomling to the uumerators a11d denominators of these fractions, and by which the solar 1tnd ltmar indexes are caused to have their proper relations to each other, and that by which the needle is kept parallel with the le\'Cr behind it, already explained, are partially seen in the central part of tlw dial of Plate V. The longer index, in the upper left-hand corner, moves around the circle in three hundred and tiixty-five days, and keeps a record of the day of the year. Between the other end of the axle which controls this index and the axle of the small tootlied wheel, between the two scales on the left of tl1c face of the machine, there is a connection by means of a small crank and a rotl which tnrus rt little the latter axle, by which the annual inequality of mean level of the sea is taken into account. During oue part of the year the left scale is thrown down a little and the otller up, tl1e etfoct of which iti to increase the readings of both lligh and low waters. Duriug the other part of the year the effoct is tho rm'erse. The smaller index is used in setting the axle and crank in accordance with the epoch of maximum of this annual irregularity. The index of this and the indices of the other three dials in the other corners are controlled by means of connections between their axles and the horizontal shaft below, which is turned directly, with the left hand, by means of the crank attached to it. The uses of the other three indices will be understood from the im;criptions on the dials. The thermometer on the right side, Plate V, is 110 essential part of the machine, but is placed there because it is a convenient place to keep a thermometer to give the temperature of the room, and, also, because it girns symmetry to the face of the machine by corresponding t-0 the scale on the right. The whole is included within a glass case which opens in front. The whole case can also be lifted up and laid aside when it is Qesirable either to set the machine or for any other purpose.

18. In the first adjustments of the machine the pulleys on the cranks must all be throwu into the center, and the vertically-oscillating frame must he let down hy means or an arrnugemcnt 11ear c, Plate III, nut.ii the middle of the horizontal slit coincides exactly with the center at c, Plate IV. The small index above c, Plate III, attached to the chaiu, must he then so adjusted that it will . point to zero of the small scale belonging to it. A small screw at a, Plate I\', at the h1·ginuing of the other ehain, should a,hm he turned until the middle of the Yertical slit coincirles with the center c. In these adjustments there i8 a slight yielding of the Jiarts with a change of te11sio11, so that they should be made by coming to the positions from both sicles and taking the mean of the small difference. These ac\justments, being onee made, should not require auy clia11gP; lmt it is well to verify them occasionally, f~n· in the use of the machine some small cha11ge8 in the rigidity of the different parts might gradually take place. In the harmonic a,nalysis of tidal observations it is usual to giYc the consta11t8 of the expression of the tidal function h, in the following form;

(a)

k=H 0 +:!Aecos(i0 t-e0 )

But the value of e0 is the epoch in angle from the time of the passage of tbe fictitious moon of each component over the meridian, to the time of high water of tllat com1)onent. Hence at the time of this meridian passage we have for each component t= o, or some number of e\en periods. In the expression of h in (1 ), however, we have t= o, for all the components at the same time, which is usually assumed to be January 1, 01i (leap year January 2, O"). T!Je values of <e, therefore, in ihe preceding expres8ion must be reduced to those corresponding to this epoch off= O. This reduction is made by means of equation (9), "Discussion of Tides in Penobscot Bay,""' with the values of en= s c0 contained in the Table II of that paper. The following table is the latter part of that table, somewhat modified iu form and notation, more convenient for practical application l1ere, and extended to the end of the century. The constant s Ce of that table is here denoted by k0 Table II contains the values of the constants k" for the several components, and also the longitude of the moon's ascending node (m), angle of moon's phase (a.), the moon's mean anomaly (b), and the angle of the moon's place from the equatorial node (c), for the first of each year. Tlie values of k0 for the shallow-water components are, for (MS) 4 , equal to k 1 , for M4, equal to 2 ki, and for M 6 , equal to 3 k, k 1 being the value of k" for the component M 2· For the solar component it is equal 0.

The whole reduction above is carried out completely, but it, iR seen that the result wonM h<' prncticall;y the sanrn if unity had been used for i., : i 1 in the Rerni-diurnal cmnpom·11h; and gin the diurnal components. If the macliine is set according to Ae, this will answer in (6) for tlw times of liigh water, in all the semi-diurnal components. 21. Besides the preceding rednctionR, there is also another one neccf\sary for many tide-RhttionR, referred to itnd explaitrnc1 in § 9, in order to get the best results. This, as we ltave Reen, l'('(JUireR the amplitudes, except A 1, to be diminished a little in (3) aud to be increased a8 mncl1 in (6). The amount of this decrease and increase at Bm;ton Harbor, and Penobscot lfa)·, and probably along the whole New England coast, is about one-sixth or one-senmth of the whole auq1litude; but at New York Harbor it is one-(iightb; and on the California eoast still less. 22. Witlt the constants thnR obtltincd the machine musit be sPt according to the different type!': or forms of the tide at the several stationR. For the large range tides of onr Atlantic coast, with small diurnal components, the pulleys are thrown out on the cranks accorcling to the forrnnla of (lll), makfag small corrections in the Yalnes of A 0 , for the effects of friction explained in the preceding paragraph, where this is known. 'rt1e indexes at the back part of the machine mn:-it he Ret according to the val ties of C.,, or their supplements for those components in wllich the angles, ill Tahle I, § 12, increase negatively, for reasons gi \'en. J<'or the amplitude Ai of the mean lnnar aucl principal component, the macliine is Ret by turning a milled head at the 1:>ide of tlie machine just above c, Plate III, until the index on the chaiu stands on the scale at a point eorrespon<ling· to the value of this amplitude. The horizontal slit in the frame oscillati11g n·rtically then stands at that lwight above tl1e central part of the machine, which corresponds to tlw mean leYel of the tide. The lunar index, on the face of the. machine, must be set to the degree correspornliug to r1. The solar index must he moved to the figure 12 on the dial, and the small iudex below must he turned down to midnight. The index in the upper left-hand corner mmit b<' placrd at .Taunar~· l. The small index on the same dial must be set to the supplement of the angle E in the attmml inequality of mea.n level. For instance, if <=2700, it must point to about the 1st of April. The other indices in the other t.hree corners, showing the angle of phase, the moon's mm-111 anomaly, and angle of moon's 11lace from the equatorial node, can he set approximate]~- by the lltst three columns of' Table II. These require little accuracy, since the results do not depend upon them. While the ma<l11ine is being set the two upright shafts, oue on each side, must be clampc<l by means of the milled heads, for that purpose, in order to keep every part in position, as set, while this is being done. 23. The machine being thus set (which requires about one hour), an<l pl:wed on the top of a desk, with blanks in front for recording the results in a form ready for the printer, and the clamps

on the Rides having been loosened, you first turn the crank with your left hand until the lunar index comes in conjunction with one end of the needle. If this is the upper eud, the solar index then points out the time of the first high water, and the index on the left-hand side of the face of tlrn machine, re~1d off on the left part of the scale, gives the height of this high water. Then turn until the lunar index comes in conjunction with the lower end of the needle. This is the time of the next low water. The solar index then points out the time of this low water, and the index on the side, read off now from the right-hand part of the scale, gives the height of this low water. Then turn until the lunar index comes in conjunction again with the upper end of the needle. 'l'liis is the time of the second high water, the times and heights of which are read off as before. Continue thus through the year from high to low and from low to high water, reading oft' and recording the results as read oft'. "\Vhere the range of the mean tide is less than about 5 feet, as is thecase mostly on all stations south of Cape Cod, the pulle~·s on the cranks can be thrown out to double the distance of the amplitudes, and the heights then read from the inner graduation of the scales, which is 2 inches of the scale to a foot of tide. 24. 'Vhere the tide has large diurnal components in comparison with the semi-diurnal, such as to make the errors according to (21) too large, as may be the case in the titles of tlie Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific coast, set the maC'hine first in accordance with formula (6) and run through for a year, reading and recording the time~ only of high and low waters. Then set according- to (3), which requires, unless _great accuracy is wanted, merely the changing of the amplitudes of the diurnal and qnarter-diurnal, &c., components. 'l'urn the crank then until a conjunction o.f the luuar index with the needle takes place, and obserrn the_ time from the solar in1fox_ Then turn, forward or hack ;ts the case may be, until the time pointed out by the solar index is that half way hetween this time and the recorded time of high water, and then read oft' the height of high or low water, as the case may be, from the scale on the left, ancl make the record. Continue this through the year. In all cases the values of the con!'ltants, Ce, should be determined for both the beginning and end of the year, and after running through, it sl.tould be obsen'cd whether the indices stand in accordance with the ndues of Cc at the end of the year. If not, either the index was not set rigl.Jt at the start or there has been some slip, and it will be necessary to go O\'Cr it again. 25. ''There the diurnal components are small, as in the Atlantic tides, the upper end of the 11ep11Je has ~m irregular half-monthly oscillation about the figure 12 on the dial, being sometimeis 011 the oue sidci and at others on the other. This answers to the half-monthly inequality in the times. There is a correspouding inequality in the height of the index on the left of the face, indicating a similar inequality in the heights. There is also, in connection with this inequality, a small diurnal inequalit;r of both the times and heights, indicated by the motion of the needle and the index on tbe scale. 1f the diurnal components are large, there is a large oscillation of the needle from oue side to the other and back every day, corresponding to the diurnal inequality in the times, and also a large vertical oscillati011 of the index at the side, corresponding to the alternate higher and lower Jtigh or low waters of the same day. Where the diurnal components are so large as to cause the movable point n, Fig. 2, Plate I, to come around below the center c in the second setting in which the heights are read, the height of one high water may fall below, or of one low water above, mean sea lc\·el. The value of (fi-ft') then in the table of the Appendix becomes greater than 900, and the term R cos (;~-ft') given in the table has the contrary sign and must be applied to Ho accordingly. Where the amplitmks of the diurnal components are so large as to bring the point n around below c in the first setting, the needle is made to move entirely around each day, and there can be only two coujnnctions of the lunar index with the needle in a day, one with each end. There is in this case ouly one high and one low water each day. There is one critical case in which the maehine fails. This is where the point ~wonld pass exactly through the point c. This is a case which sometimes occurs, and a little aid is then required

to help it pass. This occurs mostly when tlrn largt' diurnal ti!lP briugs one of tlw high watnrs down to about meau tide level. The wave is then very fiat aml the times from ob8er\'atiou, and as given by the machine, are both somewhat nucertaiu.
EFFIOIENCY OF 'l'IlE MACHINE.

26. The results given by the machine have been compared with both computation and oh,.,er.vation. In a comparison with computation for oue month of the tides of Boston I Iarlior tlte difference in the heights rarely amounted to more thau 0.1 foot, and iu the times, to more than three or four minutes. These arise from a slight yielding of some parts of the machine with increase or decrease of teusiou iu the clrninH o\·er the pulleys on account of the axles and cranks not haYi11g quite rigidity enough. This, however, coultl be remedied by making tho axlei'i and cranks of the larger components, wlticlt have to do the most work, a littk stronger. In all short-range tides, which cau be worked C!ll the scale of 2 iucbes to tbti foot of tide, the;;e defects arp dimiui8hed one-half, and in no case am they of any eonsequm1ce in comparison wit]; tlw \'ariou;; al1110rmal disturllances of cuauges of winds aud barometric pressure, which cam1ot I.le takeu into account. In a compariHon of the resnlts giYen hy the machine for three mouths of the tides of San Diego, with the times arnl heights as giyeu by obsenation, the a\·erage of the differences in the times aml the heights taken without regard to signs were as follows:

Of conrHC these differences are due mostly to tile meteorological dist11rha11cc,;, and olll.Y i11 a 1miall'lneasurc to the errors of tlte machine. The comparisons, also, are for the winter montlrn, in which theHe ab11ormal disturbances are always found to I.le the greatest. The aYerages of the differences iu the times are Yery much increased 011 accou11t of the large diurnal tide, making the tide-wave often very fiat at the times of one of the high and Io,v water;; of the day, when the exact times of maxima and minima become very nncertaiu. The machine has also been tested in its application to the very singular tide.s of PfLpcetc, of the island of Tahiti, in which the times of high water sometimes follow the moon, as usual, but at other times the sun. An explanation of these tides has been given in my Tidal lfosearches, published as a separate appendix to the Coast Survey Heport for 1874. The observations of the:se t.ides extend only from the 1st of June, 1856, until about the middle of October. The peonliarity of these tides consists in the solar semi-diurual tide being in general larger than the lunar. During the mouth of June, with maximum declination of the sun, this tide,l1owever, was a little less, and then the times were controlled by tlte lunar tide, and tile times of high water followed, though at Yery irregular intervals, the moon. In July, however, and es1Jecially about the time of the autumnal equiuox, the solar tide became larger thau the lunar, so that the point n, Fig. 2, Plate I, passed around c, carrying the needle around with it in such a manuer as to cai1se the times of high water, as read off from tlle solar index, to fall all tlte time at nearly the same hours of the da;y, aml soon after 12 of noon and midnight. The heights, as read off, were a maximum, as they shoultl be, near the times of the syzigies, but nearly vanished at the quadratures. The machiue is now being used in the prediction of the tides for the year 1885 to be used in the Tide Tables, published annually by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and, with t,he exception of the very small defects referred to, is found to give entire satisfaction. The capacity of the machine for doing work is at least that of 30 or 40 computers, if these were to take int;o account everything which the machine does.

RESULTS FOR THE LENGTH OF THE PRIMARY BASE-LINE IN YOLO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, MEASURED IN 1881 BY THE PARTY OF GEORGE DAVIDSON, ASSISTANT.
Computation and Discussion of Results, by CHARLES A. SCHOTT, Assistant.

!

A full account of the measurement of the Yolo.base and of the construction and description of the apparatus used has been given in Appendices Nos. 7 and 8 to the report for 1882; the first by the present writer, on the apparatus used; the second by Assistant George Davidson on the operation of measure. To these the reader may be referred once for all. The paper herewith presented contains a condensed account of the results reached by the computer for the le.ngth of the base, with a discussion of its probable error and other matter of interest connected therewith, and forms part of a series of reports· on the measure and length of the primary base lines of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The site of the base is in Yolo County, California, about 28 kilometers (or 17k statute miles) to the westward of Sacramento City ; the astronomical latitude of its southern terminus is 38° 31 1 3411 .19± 0".07, and of its northern terminus 330 40' 37".23± 011 .07; the astronomical azimuth of the line at Southeast base is 163° 07 1 13".45±0".18 and that at Northwest base 3430 05' 0!.! 11 .37 ±0!'.14, making the base inclined to the meridian at its middle :(lOint about 16° 531.9. The longitude of this point is about 1210 491.7. The length of the line is about 17.5 kilometers (or a little short of 11 statute miles); tbe ground at Southeast base is about 21.6 meters (or 71 feet), and at North· west base about 46.6 meters (or 153 feet) above the mean tidal level of the Pacific Ocean. The soil is a rich, dark loam, more sandy near Southeast base and stiff clay near Northwest base; the grade is very easy, almost level, except when nearing the upper end, where for about 100 meters the ascending slope is about 4°; the maximum inclination of a bar was 5:> 21 1.5. Underneath the monuments marking the ends of the base there are granite blocks; inserted in these a copper bolt, witb a fine drill bole in its upper surface, defines the terminus of the base at each end. The line was measured twice and in opposite directions~ and some parts of it thrice; the time spent in the first measure was twenty days, in the second eighteen, and in the third eight working days. ' The measurement commenced September 19 and was completed November 24, 1881. In the annual report for 1882, Appendix No. 7, there is given an account of the construction of the base apparatus and of the standard bars and the length of the field standard is shown to be 5m+116311- .0+5711- .47 (t-110.07 0) d: 2 .1 :d: .21 Also the value of one turn of Fauth & Co.'s screw contact-level comparators III and IV, viz: 25P .528+()1.1.002 (t-2000) and 25P .535+°"" .002 (t-2000) d:lO d:9 respectively. In these expressions µ stands for a micron or the millionth part of a meter, C indicates centigrade thermometric scale, and the quantity following the plus or minus sign the probable error of the respective quantity above it. We also transcribe from the same appendix the
·The last of these published forms Appendix No. 12, Report for 1873, on the length of the Peach Tree Ridge base,
in Georgia, 1872.

The highest temperature during which a bar was laid was 32°.4 0. (September 30) and the lowest 30,0 O. (November 22); for the ouwr air (in the shade) these extremes were of course much exceeded. As already stated, the unit of length upon which the geodetic work of the Survey depends is the iron committee meter of 179!1, the property of the American Philosophical Society, at Philadelphia; the length of the 5-meter field standard is giYen in terms of this meter. It will be easy hereafter to express our lengths in terms of the new international meter as soon as the latter shall have been distributed and compared; in the mean time, if desirable, we may refer to the late direct comparison· of the committee meter with the platinum meter of the Conservatoire at Paris, in August, 1867. For an investigation of the permanency of the indications of the Borda scales attached to the office and field 5-meter standards, see Acldenduin (A) at the close of this report.
LENGTH OF THE BASE-BARS

1 .AND 2.

The length of the base will be made to depend upon the length of the base-bars as derived directly from their comp~risons with the field standard made every morning before commencing the measure on the base. Generally two sets of comparisons were made, and these at a time when the bars had arrived at or near their daily minimum temperature, as iudieated by the )Iler· curial thermomet~rs. This happened near the hours of 7 and 8 a. m. The results of these comparisons are given in tbe following table:

·October 27, there were no observations in the morning.

Assuming that the bars were stationary, or nearly so, about the times of comparison, we may deduce the mean error of a comparison of the standard with a base bar from the observed differences of the two corresponding sets of observations. If d this difference, in microns, n =number of such differences or days, e =mean error of a comparison or set, e =mean error resulting from two sets,

then
we find for

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Looking over the table we first notice (Diagram 3, Illustration No. 32) a systematic diffe;ence between the temperatures of the standard and of the bars, the former being io,47 higher, on the average, while the latter agree within oo.os. This is entirely due to the fact that the standard was better protec1ed against changes of temperature than the bars, the box containing the former being covered with an additional "steam felting" three-fourths of an inch thick. At or about the maximum temperature of the day the sign of the difference revers~s, and the standard is then of lower temperature than the bars. We next notice, after plotting the tabular results (Diagram 4, Illustration No. 32) that upon the whole the temperature steadily declined between September 18 and November 25 about 150 C., whereas the length of the base-bars remained, and if not exactly the same, at most showed but a trifling increase in length. From this, however, we are not to infer that the compensation of the bars was perfect, or nearly so, as will be shown in the discussion of the observations specially made to test the question of the degree of compensation, and which reveals a peculiarity in' the behavior of zinc, more fully noticed further on.
DIURNAL VARIATION IN THE LENGTH OF THE BASE-BARS DUE TO THE DIURNAL VARIATION OF THE ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE.

From numerous comparisons made of the base-bars with the standard it became evident that their length was snhject to a periodic change depending on the daily temperature variation; but what is of more importance with regard to the length of the base is the fact that this periodic change was, during September, of very small amplitude, and after the middle of October and throughout November it had becoms permanent and remained apparently constant, but showing a relatively large amplitude. The first perio<l comprises the time of the first measure, the second period that of the second and partial third measure. In the investigation of the diurnal variation of the length of the base-bars we onl;y need the form of the curve representing the variation, so that there is no need of referring the bi-hourly values taken on different days to the same index. The comparisons were not made at the exaet even hour, but the results could be grouped and means taken referring nearly to full hours. The corresponding temperatures of the bars are given as read from the mercitrial thermometers. On September 18 there are hourly observations from 51' 40m a. m. to 51t 40m p. m. ; the mean for two adjacent odd hours was combined with the value for the intermediate even hour and set down in the table. On September 16 and 18 the observations do not extend over twenty-four hours, and to eliminate the effect of any change of index or any constant deviation from the average variation on other days (of twelve equidistant comparisons) the mean hourly difference for each of these two days from the conesponding hours on the full days was ascertained and applied as a constant. The same simple process is gone through with for the observed temperatures.

Mean daily range of base-bars 11°.0C. and of standard 7°.80.; the difference is due to the heavier protecting cover of the standard; also the t>pochs of maximum and minimum are later with the standard than with the base-bars; these relations are shown on Diagram 7, Illustration No. 32. An examination of the Borda scale readings of the base-bars (mean value) showed that they lagged behind the corresponding (in time) readings of the standard, a fact which is explained by the position of the zinc bar in the base apparatus where it lies between two steel bars, and is thus partly protected from changes of temperature; the Borda scale readings of the base-bars are therefore unreliable in consequence of the unequal temperature of the two metals composing the same. No use was made of them. The observed lengthening of the base.- bars with rise of temperature, as shown on Diagram 6, Illustration No. 32, would lead to the inference that the apparatus would be found shorter at the close of the base measure than at the heginning in consequence of the gradual lmoering of the temperature, whereas direct comparisons with the standard showed no such eflect (Diagram 4, Illustration No. 32). This beha>ior can only be explained by a molecular change in the zinc bars producing a shortening, and consequently making the base-bars longer. This is the same pbe. nomenon already noticed in other zinc bars, confirming their liability to take up a new set or a succession of changes. The length of the base-bars during the measure is determined as follows: For any one day it will depend on the morning comparison of the standard; to this is added di1forentia.lly the diurnal range for the particular hour taken from the normal rauge, multiplied by a factor showing the ratio of the r.mge of the temperature on the particular day to the normal range; all ordinates are thus multiplied with this ratio for the whole day. We have seen that before the base measure the nor. rual diurnal range was hardly perceptible (Diagram 5, Illustration No. 32), but during the second and partial third measure it developed into a constant sensible quantity (Diagram 6, must.ration No. 32). The simplest supposition that could be made was to suppose the change from one into

the other took place graduaUy and uniformly between October 5 and October 15, keeping the small observed daily range up to October 4, on which day the change appears to have commenced (Diagram 4, Illustration No. 32). A table was constructed of normal diurnal range for e\'ery day between October 4 and October 15, which thus comprises about OM-half of the first measure of the base; after this time the normal diurnal range remained constant. Only that part of the diurnal variation in the length of the apparatus is needed which falls between the hours of 7 a. m. and p. m., and in order to smooth out the curve or to free it from effect of observing error it was expressed by an analytical formula, viz: L = l + x + yh + zhi, where h =number of hours after 7 a. m., alld L =resulting length of apparatus (the indices of the bars are not the same for the two epochs, the differential range only being required).

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The method of finding the length of the base-bars is best illustrated by an example. Suppose it is required to find the length of an average bar October 10, between the hours P 52m and 2h 22m, between which time 22 bars were laid, or 11 with each measuring bar, twenty-two being the usual number united into a mean : Range of temperature October 10, 27° - 120 = 150; normal range, 12°.o; ratio = 1.25. Normal daily range of length between 7h 38m a. m. and 2h 07m p. October 10, for average bar, 14.8 - 2.8 = + 12, and 1.25 x 12 = 15 Length of arnrage bar from comparisons at 7h 33m a. m., October 10 ·....···..·..··. 5m 196 µ

These occur at the end of the base and at intermediate stones placed in line of fonces. In connection with these measures the following results are taken from the office computation: I.iength of Brunner centremeter scale= 10001.0 + 0.178 (t-200 0.) microns. Value of one turn of micrometer microscopes A and B of Pratt's beam compass comparator = 83.25 µ aud of one division = 1.388 µ. No sensible difference between A and B. Length of nickel-plated brass meter,= lm + 17.76 µ (t- 30,50 C.) Length of transfer meters on steel rod, first = lm + 11.2 µ (t + 90,73 C.) t;e.cond = lm + 11.2 µ (t 130_73 0.) third = lm + 11.2 ft (t + 130.17 0.) Length of brass meter scale for fractional parts of a meter was found the same as the length of the nickel-plated meter, or lm + 17.76 p (t-30.50 C.) The small ivory scale divided into half millimeters and used in transfers must be taken as sensibly correct.

HEIGHT OF THE YOLO BASE AND REDUCTION TO SEA-LEVEL.

The work of leveling the bm;e-line and connecting the same with a bench-mark at Woodland was executed by Assistant Colonna in August, 1880, with the following results: Ground at Northwest base above ground at Southeast base, by first measure, 81.933 feet; by second measure, in opposite direction, 82.124 feet; mean, 82.028 feet, or 25.002 meters. Also railroad engineers' bench-mark on California Pacific Railroad at Woodland above ground at Northwest base, from first measure, 94.759 feet; from second measure, in opposite direction, 94.740 feet; mean, 94.750 feet; or 28.880 meters. From levels by the railro~ engineers this bench-mark at Woodland is 60.6 feet above mean low water at San Francisco Bay, and from our tidal observations (Coast Survey Report for 1862, page 97) we ha.ve the mean rise and fall about 4~ feet; hence bench-mark at Woodland 58.35 feet, or 17.785 meters abo-ve the half-tide level of the ocean. This gives for the height of Northwest base above mean tide-level 46.665 meters, and of Sotltheast base~21.663 meters. We have also the average height of the measuring bars above ground 1.25 meters. If l =length of a base-bar or of any part of the base, h =its elevation above the half-tide or mean sea level, p = radius of curvature in the direction of the line and for the latitude of its middle point, then the reduction to the sea level

t Countod from Southeast base monume;it.

It will be noticed that the effect of tne introauction of the third partial measure or of the third measure of 8 kilometers was to increase the mean of the first and second measures by ouly 2.G millimeters; it is also apparent that the ftrst measure is 17.4 millimeters greater than the second; this may be regarded as accidental, sinoo for some of the intermediate kilometer measures the first one is less than the second. The differences from the respective means are given in the columns headed 6, .6 /1 6 111 ; they keep fairly within a certain reasonable limit, and it is by these that the probable error of' the base is computed, i. far as this depends upon the pure measuring error.

Excepting the last 4 kilometers the temperature during the second measure was lower than during the first measure, but during the third measure it was considerably lower than during the second; the greatest difference of temperature occurred during the first and third measure of kilometer 14, when it reached 17°.5 0.; yet the results are not sensibly affected thereby, and it may be jnferred in general that the value of the coefficient of expansion of the standard as determined at the office at "Washington must be faii;ly correct. Besides the kilometer stones there were also so-called "fence stones" or subdivisions of the line at the crossing of !) fences, where they are better prot-0cted from the plow than in the open fields. The measures of these stones are given in the following table, computed in the same way as the kilometer stones :

DETERMINATION OF THE PROBABLE ERIWR OF THE MEASURE OF THE BASE.

The probable error due to the measure proper, which includes contact error, trausfor error (end of bar to the ground aud back to bar), error in measure of fractional parts of hars, error:,; iu inclination, and in assigned length of the bars, &c., is found by the formula:

Where s' s' s111

. are the se\reral results of n measures of a section of the base and
(f

s' + s" + s'" + =------------n
\Ve

then the probable error r 1 for the whole base of i sections is given hy the above expression. find r1 from the difforences 6, 6 /1 6 1,, which represent the values of oi - si

In case of but two measures· of the base the above formula reduces to 0.337 v' 2:'62 where difference in the two measures of a section and n=number of sections.

o = dif·

·we may readily arrange our results into two sets hy eomhiniug the third measure symmetrically with the first and the second measures, and at tho same time preserving the mean aH it resulted from the three measures; thus let a, b, c equal the three succe88ive measures of a scotiou, then the combination to form but two values will lead to

Combining in t.his way our triple meatlnres wo can form tho following table of length of kilometers:

With the preceding probable error there needs to be combined the error arising from the trans fer ofle11gth from the standard to the base-bars. There are 86 comparisons of each bar witll tlle standard and from those taken in pai,rs we have the means of finding the proba,ble error of a single comparison in the tield. Let d =observed difference between the results of the two corresponding sets as observed in the morning before the measure of the base commenced on that day, n =number of such differences or days of observation,

In estimating the probable error of the base some allowance should be made for the cffoct of an nncertaintJ· in the hypothesis adopted with regard to the change from no daily Yariation to a fixed dail;y variation in the length of the average bar; our result depends ou tJJC assumption that the change from one into the other took place between October 4 and October 14; had we adopted September 18 instead of October 4 the result would lrnve been a systematic greater value of each kilometer in the first measure as compared with the second, and the length of the first measure would have been 174SGm.5499 instead of l7486m,5180, or 31.9 millimeters greater than the adopted value, the seeond measure and the third partial measure remaining the same. The probable error would also be raised from r 1 = ± 3mm .23 to ± 3mm,68; the distribution of the dail.r variation over the greater iutcrYal is therefore injurious to the result and was abandoned. Its effect, however, on the whole length would have been an increase of 174S6rn.5269-1748Gm.5119 = 15mm,O, and I propose to include one-third of this as an estimate of the uncertainty in question; hence r 3 = ± 5mm,O \Ve come next to the principal probable error, 11amely, that arising from the uncertainty in the lengtli of tLe standard. It bas been shown that its uncertainty is± 2.1 µ, the effect on the base is cousequently ± 2µ.1 x 3497 or± 71nm,344, which we put= r 4 · There is also a minute error intro<luced through the uncertainty in the value of the expansion coefficient 57 µ.47(t-l70,07) The ±.21 mean temperature of measure of the Yolo base is 17°.5 O., so that the effect of but 00,40, is hardly uoticeable; it amounts to r5 ± omm,3 If we estimate the uncertainty in the leveling and in the height of the half.tide or average Iernl of the i::\Ca at ±Om ,35, we have a probable error in the reduction to the sea-level of r6 = ± Qmm,94, The error due to imperfect alignment is inappreciable. Collecting our separate nllues r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 we have r = v[rr] = ± 9mm.57 This probable error of the computed length of the base of ± 911m 1.57 in 17 486.5119 meters 1s

(A.)-lNVESTIGATION OF THE PERllfANENCY OF '!'HE INDICATIONS OF BORDA SCALES FO:DIED OF ZINC AND IRON.

Although the metallic thermometers depending on the differential expansion of zinc and iron, which were used in connection with the Bessel base apparatus, apparently gave satisfactorj· results: doubts have been raised within a few .rcarH past as to the reliability of zinc with respect to Jl()rmaneney of length and of coefficient of expansion after exposure to var~·ing temperatures, artificial or uatuml. The question being one of importance, it is proposed to give in the following page" au account of the experiences gathered in con11ectio11 with the new base apparatus. Up to the vrnsent time our experience <loes not extend over more than two years, but it is proposed hereafter to examine at least the standard bars at suitable time.~, in order that experimental e.-idence may be had whether or not the bars ultimately attain that permanence of condition which woul<l 1Jlacc their fitness for metallic thermometers beyond doubt.

Plotting these values (see accompanying plate, Diagram 1) it became evident that a cltauge took place in the index and expansion uetween the sixth and seventh series, or between l\Iarcl1 and May, 1882, at a time when the bar remained on the platform in the comparing room.

Since we have proof that the steel bar remained unchanged, there must have occurred a molecular change in the zinc bars about April, 1882. In consequence of these ba;s taking a new :,;et the index error changed 41 microns, the zinc bars having become shorter arnl the coefficieut ot expansion smaller. Before and after the change the correspondence between the metallic aml mer curial thermometers appears satisfactory, as shown in the columns M- B in the above table.

The two Diagrams, Nos. 1and2 show that the zinc bars were subject to two changes, the first between series 2 and 3, or in July, 1881, wben the field standard was transported by railroad to California, a journey of more than 3 000 statute miles. A second change took place i~ California after the natural temperature had reached its minimum of about 20 0. on November 21, 1881 (series No. 19 of the table). After this date the bars did not fully recover their length. Taking means as before we have: First series, mean reading of scales, 7mm,608; of thermometers, 22°.05 C.; change .of scale for

hut we must be certain that the condition of the zinc bar remained unchanged. The mercurial thermometers alone were used for the determination of the length of the base-bars.
(B.)-RESULTS OF ROUGH AND PRELIMINARY VALUES FOR LENGTH OF THE YOLO B.1U·m.

In August, 1880, in connection with the spirit-leveling of the line, Assistant Colonna measured the length of the base by means of a 50-meter stet1l wire under constant strain; this wire he starnl· arded by means of the 4-meter secondary base-bars Nos. 3 and 4, and found for the length 17485.4 rneters, a value about 1.1 meters in defect. The error amounts to rn ho of the lengtb, nearly. A second wire measurement was made in September, 1881, by Assistant Gilbert, aided hy Sub· assistants Blair and Dickins preparatory to the base measure with the 5 ·meter bars, by meairn of which the wire was standarded. · The wire was 100 meters in length, and, stretehcd with a constant force, the measure fell short of the true length of the llase 0.6 meters, which is equiYalent to 2Ttoo of the length, nearly. The field computation by Mr. Blair and Mr. Gilbert, made during the measure (and after the reduction to the sea-level had been applied), gave the length 17486m.559, only 47 millimeters in excess The value used provisionally in the office computations up to this time (May, 1883) for the length of the base was that derived from the Pulgas base, south of San Francisco Ba;y, as measured b,v Assistant Outts in 1853, and brought forward through partly incomplete triangulation to the Yolo base, it was 17486m.86; it exceeds the true length only om.35 which is equivalent to ,; 0 -t1 ,,, of the length, nearly. Since all charts and maps in the vicinity of San Francisco and south of it to Monterey, as well as the preliminary computation of the triangulation extending across Nernda to the Utah bonndarj·, depend for their scales and distances on the Pnlgas base, it is satisfactory to have the assurance of the reliability of this old base.
(0.)-PRODA.DLE ERROR OF "MA.KING CONT.A.CT" OR OF" COINOIDENCE OF LINES'; OF TIIE CONTA.C'l' SLIDES OF THE BASE-.DARS.

Observations for the contact error were made at Washington June 15, 16, 1881, for bar 1, and June 18, 20, 1881, for bar 2. In these observations made in the comparing room the lKLr was left in l)()Sition, but repeated contact was made with one of the Bessel-Repsold screw-eontact. le\·cl comparators, the contact being made and broken in succession. A hand-glass of low magnif'.ying power was used to establish coincidence of lines.

An observation consists of a pointing on the end of the bar and t,hen on the ivory half-milli·
met,er

scale on the ground, with the theodolite, say clamp north, aud of the same operation with clamp south, in order to eliminate any defect in the horizoutality of the axis of the sector or any defect in collimation. The fractional part of a scale subdivision is est.imated; the telescope is set equidistant (or nearly so) from bar end and scale, and its focal adjustment answers for both objects. Before each observation the ivory scale is taken off and reset with its 20-division mark over the line in the copper tack or bolt. On September s, 1881, in the camp near the middle of the base, 23 observations on four differeut parts of the scale were made by various obsen-ers; from these we find

a f)Uantity small enough to be neglected. In conclusion, I beg leave to add a few remarks relating to any fntnre use of the base appa· ratus. Notwithstanding the small probable error reache(l iu the measure of the Yolo base, and which I attrihnte in a great measure to the extreme care taken by the party in charge of the work, the fact brougl1t out of the unexpectedly capricious aud otherwise irregular behavior of the zinc bars of the apparatus with respect to heat, renders it doubtful in my mind whether this form of the apparatus would not better be abandoned for either a partly compensating apparatus or a wbol1y uncompensated one. If we were to replace the zinc bar of the apparatus by a brass bar, we sacrifice 50 per cent. of the compensation, but would probably not be confronted with irregularities which may be troublesome and possibly impracticable to deal with. On the other hand an uncompensated single steel bar put in the place of the present compound bar, if well protected against change of temperature, may lead to results not inferior to those already rl.'ached. Whatever may be decided on, I should recommend abandoning the Borda scales and not to neglect taking a comparison with the field standard at the beginning and close of each day's measure.

RESULTS OP OBSERVATIONS :FOR ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION ON THE LINE MOL'"NT DIABLO TO MARTINEZ, CALIFORNIA, IN COXNECTIO:'\' WITH HYPSOMETRIC MEASURES BY SPIRIT-LEVEL, THE VERTICAL CIRCLE AND THE BAROMETER, MADE IN MARCH AND APRIL, 1880, BY GEORGE DAVIDSON, ASSISTANT .·

INTRODCCTION.

This important series of systematic observations, continued hourly day and night, weather permitting, between March 21 and April 28, 1880, forms the third contribution of materials by Assistant Davidson for the study of the diurnal variation of the atmospneric refraction in connection with comparative hypsometric measures by different instruments and methods. His first observations of this kind were undertaken in March, 1860, at Bodega Head and Ross Mountain, on the coast of California; his second measures were made in September and October, 1879, at Round Top and Jackson Butte, on tbe western slope of tbe Sierra Nevada; and tbe present third series was executed in March and April, 1880, at Mount Diablo and ~fartinez East, south of Suisun Bay, distant about 50 kilometers (31 statute miles) from the sea-coast. The line passes over the northwestern slope of Mouut DiabJo, which is steep iu the directiou toward l\Iartinl'z. With respect to climate, tbe region is of a character intermediate between that of the coast and that of the ,-alley 1 f the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, the heat of the valle_y being here tempered by the inflow of cool air through the Golden Gate. The obser'\ers at :Martinez East were: G. Davidson, aided by J. J. Gilbert. Assistant; the obserYers at Mount Diablo were B. A. Colonna, Assistant, aided by J. F. Pratt, Sub-assistant. Martinez East is about 5i meters (or 187 feet), and ;)fount Diablo about 1173 meters (or 3849 feet) above the average sea-leYel. To determine the relative position of the stations, a small triangulation was executed in 1880, b,y Assistant J. J. Gil l>ert, which depended for its linear measures on the side Good~·ear to Island of the triangulation of Suisun Bay in 1864. The resulting geographical positions are as follows :

Distance Mount Diablo to Mart.inez East, 24260m.6 or about 15.1 statute miles. Between Ml:),}' 10 and May 26, 1880, Assistant B. A. Colonna connected the two stations bJ lines of spirit-levels, one up, the other down the mountain. The office computation gave the results 3661.618 and 3661.864 feet ::I: 0.090 feet, hence the mean difference 3661.741 feet or 1116.09 meters :I:: 0.03 meter. The bench-mark at Martinez East was connected with the tidal bench-mark at the Benicia Arsenal, across the strait, by means of reciprocal and simultaneous vertical angles, measured May 27, 1880, at Martinez East, by J. J. Gilbert, and at the arsenal station by B. A. Colonna. The half-tide level is given by Assistant G. Bradford from six days' continuous tidal observations at Benicia, and checked by reference to a long series of tidal observations recorded ai the Mare Is· 289

land gauge. From these data the Benicia Arsenal bench-mark was found to be 5.83 feet above the half-tide level of the Pacific, and the Martinez b~uch-mark 181.22 feet above the Beuicia mark, hence Martinez East 6 above the aYerage sea-level 187.05 feet or 57.01 meters, and Mount Diablo & aboYe the average sea-level ~848. W feet or 1173.10 _ll}eten;. TbesP heig·hts refer to the surface of the ground at the triangulation station8. In consequence of the large diurnal inequality in the tides an<l the contracted volume of water in the Strait of Karquinas, I estimate the prohahle error of the height of the average sea-level not less than :± 0.15 meter. The weather proved to be abnormally bad while the observations were being made, and the amount of rain which fell in the first twenty-three days of April (10.5 iuches or 2G7 millimeters) is unprecedented, though the observations terminated before the close of the rainy season.
OBSERV A.TIONS OF Dot::BLE ZENITH DISTANCES FOR THE MEASURE OF REFRACTIO:N AND OF DIFFERENCE OF HEIGHT.

For the measure of the reciprocal and simultaueous zenith distances at the two stations, each observer sliowed when possible heliotrope light, and during the uight lantern-light, for fifteen minutes before the fall honr, ancl read the leYels of Lis vertical circle, after which he observed three repetitions of double zenith distance followed by a second set; the le\'els were then read again, also the barometer, and other meteorological instruments. The two sets of zenith distances occupied from six to seven minutes, and the mean of the two results,will nearly girn tht> r.enith distance of the opposite station at the full hour. At Mount Diablo the sun would rise on March 21st, by computation supposing the horizon unobstructed, about 511 5Gm, and on April '.!!:Ith about 5b 0 111 ; it would set on the first-named day about 6b mm and on the last day of the series about 611 55m. At the lower station, l\lartiuez East, sm1rise would take place about 5m later and sunset about the same diff<Jrence earlier than at Mount Diahlo. At lrlount Diablo the zenith distances were measured with (30-centimeter) rnrtical circle No. 37, made by Gambey; it is graduated to 5' and is rearl by fonr verniers to 3" each; value of one division of leYel = 3" .50. The horizontal nxis of the vertical circle, the center of the heliotrope, the center of the lens of the lantern, and the center of the target were 2.04 meters abo·e the top of the copper bolt or :Mount Diablo station mark. Consequently all zenith distances (/;) measured at Mount Diablo have to be dimini8hed by 17".34, corresponding to a lowering of 2.04 metres; and the total correction to C when the l\Iartinez East heliotrope was obsenred becomes
-17".34+11".91- 4".79 = -10".22 and when the lantern was observed -17" .34 + 11" .91 - 5" .86 = -11" .29

At 111artinez East the zenith clistance8 were measured with (25-centimetre) vertical circle No. 80, made by Gamuey; it is graduated to 5' and is read by four vemiers to 3" each; value of one divisionoflevel = 3".84; but it appeared that theobsen-er preforred to giYe less weight to one·ofbis six measures, hence the value adopte<l=3".56. A letter receh'ed from Assistant Davidson, dated San Francisco, September 3, 1883, garn the fo1lowing information: Top of pier, 3A85 feet above surface of copper bolt which marks the height of the station; height of center of vertical circle above top of pier 1.110 foet, hence center of \·ertical circle above spirit.level bench-mark 4.595 feet, or 1.400 meters. We have, also, heliotrope below center of vertical circle 22 13il' inches= 0.563 meter, corresponding to an angular reduction of-4".79, and similarly for the lantern 27.13 inches= 0.689 meter, or-5".86 ,and for the day-mark target 20.19 inches= 0.513 metre, or - 4".36; consequently, all ''s measured at Martinez East need diminishing by 11".91.for lowering of 1.40 meters, and the total Mrrection to r; becomes

-11".91+17".34 = + 5".43 The following tables, I and II, contain all resulting zenith distancee observed and reduced to
the copper bolts or bench-marks at both stations.

COMBINATION OF THE PRECEDING TABULAR ZENITH DISTANCES SERIES OF HOURLY MEAN VALUES.

TO OBTAIN A HOMOGENEOUS

Before the tabular results could be conveniently submitted to combination and discussmn, which in consequence of the breaks and irregular distribution of the obserrntions would be a laborious task, tlley required to be molded into a systematic series of hourlj· values. Such a series must exlribit the <liurnal variation in .; and in the angle of refraction as smooth!.'· as the broken record will admit; the process, however, must involYe nothing arbitrary, aud must apply alike to the two stations. Were there no interrnptions, the simple hourly means during the whole time of occupa. tion would give the series; we therefore first select the uumber of tlaj·s of twenty-four consecutive (hourly) observations, irrespective of the liour of beginning; of such then' are tweke, proYided we first SUfJply by interpolation a few gaps of one bour each, and in two cases of two cousecuti>e hours. These interpolated rnlues are indicated in tbe preceding tables, and tbe begiuniug and end. iug of each twenty.four hour period is shown ·by short horizo11tal bars. For interpolation of au intermediate hour comparison is made with the preceding, and, if practicable, also with the following hour throughout tbe series and the mean result is set down; thus to illustrate the principle let it be required to find ; for 8 a. m., March 23, at Mount Diablo: "Te have the mean difference for the hours 7 and 8 from tweh~ days equal + 1".2, hence interpolated value 11".2 + 1".2=12".4; sirui. larly mean difference for hours 8 and 9 from eleven da;rs equal +2u.3, hence interpolated value for 9 a. m., 14". 7. Tbis series from twelve complete days is called the mean series, and the next step is to join to it all broken series, in order that every obs1,rvation ma.y be represented in tbe final Yalnes. This is readily done by referring all obsPrvations (not yet used) on an;r day to "the mean 1wries," hy c()mpating the respective means for homologous hours and appl~·ing the differ. ence of these means as a constant to every observation on that day; thus for March 23, the mean of the fourteen observed values (inclusive of the two in brackets) at Mouut Diablo is lD 11 .l, the mean for the same hours in the mean series is 31".6, hence correction to each of the 5 values on March 23, between 1 and 7 p. rn., equals + 12".5. The referred "'alues so obtained were tabulated and the sums and means wt;re taken for each hour throughout the record, and consequently include the unchanged vah1es belonging to the twelve complete days. Tables III and IV contain the mean series, the number n of days of observation at each hour, and the resulting homogeueous series for the two statious.

In the a.hove table an asterisk (*)indicates a maximum ancl a dagger

a minimum

'\""alue.

From the contents of this table we arrh·e at the following conclusions: First, in regard to the angle of refraction. This angle, for all hours of day and night, is larger at tbe lower station tlian at the upper station, which is in conformity with the increased density of the air at the lower station. The difference is a maximum at 3 o'clock a. m., or at a time preceding the coldest part of the day by one or two hours, and the 11itl'erence is a minimum at G o'clock p. m., appnrently following the warmest part of the day by three or four hours. The diurnal rauge of the angle of refraction is less at the upper station (19".0) tbau at the lower station (3:.! 11 .7). The same laws necessarily hold with respect to the coefficient of refraction, i. e., at the lower station we bave the greater coefficient an,d greater daily range; at tbe U})per statiou the smaller amount and less variation. Maximum value of coefficient about 3 a. m., and minimum \aloe about 2:30 p. m., closely approximating to the epochs of the diurnal extremes of temperature. At Bodega Head and Ross Mountain, California,· the refraction was a minimum as early as 10 a. m., antl for the greater ouruber of hours during daylight the angle of refraction was huger at the upper station than at the lower one-facts which we now recognize as local and temporary anomalies.

Mountain,· Maine, the refraction was near a minimum throughout the hours 10 a. m. to 3 p. m., and the obserrntions (as yet unpublished) at Round Top and Jackson Butte, California, give a minimum refraction at '.!:30 p. m. Witlt respect to tbe computed difference of height, we find it too great, as compared with the true difference given by the spirit-level for all hours of the day and night, but less in excess during the da~· (1.58 m. at 6 p. m.) and more during the night hours (2.42 m. at:~ a. m.). This may be traced to the erroneous assumptions, involved in the formula, of equal angles of refraction at the stations, and of considering the line of sight as part of an arc Of a circle instead of assigning to it a shorter radius of curvature toward the lower station, where it is more bent than at the opposite end. The hourly excess of computed over true height follows the same law as the hourly excess of the angle of refraction at the lower over that of the upper station. The leading numbers of Table V are shown graphically on accompanying plate. For further discussion of our data, we need the meteorological observations made in connection with the zenith distances; these are contained in the following pages: J1Jeteorological record at 1lfount Diablo, 1lfarch a?id April, 1880.-The barometer used was Green, No. 1357; its cistern was in the same horizontal plane as the copper bolt marking the station. On se,·eral occa<;ions the instrument had to be taken for safety to a shelter 4! feet below the mark, for which the corresponding correction is -.004 inch. Index correction from l\Iarch 21 to March 23, inclusive, -.003 inch. During· the stormy days of the 24th and 25th moisture got into the cistern, and, after cleaning the instrument on the 26th, the index correction was found to be + .092 inch, dep1.m<ling on comparisons mad~ at San Francisco after the return of the party. There is no reference to any correction to readings of attached thermometer. The two thermometers, Nos. 44i and 4-18, are said to have no index correction; one of these was used for dry, the other for wet bulb. There was also a boiling point apparatus, C. S. No. 3, placed 2 meters below the station 111ark. All the meteorological instruments were hung in a wooden box, with sides of lattice.work, roofed in, and large enough for an observer to crawl in from underneath. The bulbs of the thermometers were exposed to the surface radiation within the open structure TLc wind and state of the atmosphere were noted. 1l1eteorologioal record at Jlartinez .Ea,st, March and April, 1880.-The barometer used was Green No. 2017 (of Smithsonian pattern); when taken from Sau Francisco it had an index correction of +o. 063 inch as compared with the Signal Service barometer. Its cistern was 24~ inches, or 0.629 meter below the axis of the vertical circle, hence O.i7 meter above station mark, and its reduction is + .003 inch. There is 110 infornation respecting index corrections to any of the thermometers at this place. The wet and dry bulb thermometers, by· J. Green, were placed in the north-northwest side of the observatory and protected as far as practicable from the effects of radiation. They were read from the inside through a pane of glass, which, in case of little or no wind, was moved aside topermitcirculation of air. The boiling-water thermometer, No. 16017, by J. Green, was placed in the north-northwest corner of tbe observatory, with its bulb 26! inches below the axis of the vertical circle. A solar radiation thermometer was placed in a box south of the observatory and 2~ feet aboye ground; a minimum thermometer was on the north side of the building-, G inches above the surface of the ground. Tables VI and VII contain the results of all observations made for atmospheric pressure; Tables VIU aud IX the results of all observations made for atmospheric temperature, and Tables X and XI the record for atmospheric moisture.

Before proceeding with the inrnstigatiou of the atmospheric refraction iu conueetiou with heights determined by zenith distances, it will be convenient first to present the results for diffel'ence of lieight as deduced from the ousen'ed pressnl'e and temperature of the atmosphere at the two stations. BAROMETRIC DIFFERENCE OF HEIGH1'.-For the computation of the homly series of barometric observations I propose to use the formula giveu by Dr. Jimlan * in preforence to that given h.Y Dr. Rlihlmanu, t for the reason that th(l first-named formula, with the same strictuess, is somewhat easier of application, besides it will facilitate tlte discussion of tlte atmospheric refraction in connection with a theor:,· published by Dr. Jordan in tht> Astrouomisclw ~achrichte11 No. 2095 (1876), and which will be referred to in connection witll our obserrntions at Mount Diablo-Martinez East. It is as follows :
L:ih =18400 log ~,(1+.003665 t) ( 1 + .377

i) (l+.002573 cos 2 1p){ 1 +~~)

where P' and P are the observed pressures at the upper and lower station, respectively; tLese values must be corrected for Yariation in gravitr with latitude and altit11de before introducing their values into tbe formula. .A table is provided gidng this reduction, with the argumeuts, pressure (in millimeters), and approximate height of 8tation above the sea (in meters). t represents the mean atmospheric temperature at the upper and lower statiom;, or tLl· value T + . cen t· . - - T' expressed m igrad e l 1egrees.
2

e represents the mean vapor pressure, and p the mean atmospheric pressure at the stations. A table is provided for fiudiHg e when tlle readings of the dry and the wet bulb ther111ometer:i are given. <p is the mean latitude, and H the average height of the two stations above the :-i.e~i. r stands for the earth's mean ra<lius, roughly equal to 6370000 meters. 6 h is the resulting difference of height in meters. The logarithms of each of tlle four terms in parentllesis are obtained from tables accompan~-ing the formula. , The results of the computation are presented iu the following taule, in which, for comparison, we have also introduced the results of Hi.ihlma1rn's formul<t. The column headed " U.equired. mean temperature" shows the temperature which is demanded by tile barometric formuia, iu order to satisfy the condition of giving the true height as fotrnd by Rpirit-le,·eling.

We notice the following facts :
(1.) The barometric measures give the difference of height, on the daily average, 4.7 meters

in defect (error 1 in 2.37 meters), wbereas the measure of reciprocal and simuUaneous zenith distances made the difference in height on the daily average 1.96 meters in excess (error 1 in 569 meters). Between the results by Jordan's and lUlhlmann's formulre there is a difference of 0.9 meter :l:0.1 meter, the first set haYing islightly the advantage over the second. This difference is not greater than might be expected between any two formulre aiming at great precision. (2.) Tile computed bomly heights exhilJit the usual excess ornr the true value during the wanner part of the 1lay aud the usual deficiency during the colder part. (3.) Diurnal range in values of h, 23.5 metcrH. Times when correct values are reached, 8i a. m. and .:> p. m. The range is of aYerage magnitude (about one forty-seventh of the Leight), aIHl tlw hours most favorable for barometric measures according to Riihlmann-7!i a. m. and 6~ p. m. (for Mardi and April)-tlo not differ more from the above hours than could be accounted for by onlinary Yariability. (3.) The temperature required in order that the true difference of height may result shows less diurnal ran~e 0 A) than is observed at either station (mean range 70.1 ), and the mean value for the day ( 10°.7:3) approximates nearer to the mean temperature of the day at the lower station (+11°.L> C.) tllan to that of the npper station(+ 10.94 C.). Ou the immediate sea-coast, as at Bodega Head and Ross Mountain, the computed diurnal range of the temperature of the interrnning stratum of air was too small to be perceptible between the hours 7 a. m. and ,:; p. m., the observatious being discontinued during the night. At Martinez East and )fount Diablo, about 50 kilometers (say 30 statute miles) from the coast, the range is two-fifths of tile range as obsen'eu near the surface of the ground, and farther iu the interior, or in the California Valley, the difference between the observed and required temperature of the air between two stations will undoubtedly be found to become still less.

(4.) The last column, beaded app;aent error in mean ternperature t, coutains ah;o the apparent error of the observed temperatures at the two stations, supposing them affected alike; that this equalitJ, however: does not hold is proved by the anomaly that the obsen·ed temperatures at Mount Diablo, when thus corrected, would show higher temperatures (oy ahout 1O) during tile night than rtnring the day; in fact the distribution of the error as gfreu iu that column is unequal as regards tlie two stations, and the lower oue is undoubtedly much rnorc affected than the upper one. The numbers plainl.r show that during the l1oun; of iwmlation, between Ha. m. and 5 p. m., th\J observed temperatures are too high b~· fully 20 (). in maximo int l p. w.), and during the other hours they are too low by foll~· 3~° C. iu maximo (at -! a. m.). Applied with reversed sign as corrections, the numbers in this colnmn may advantageously be applied to other barometric measures in the same climatic region, especially if attentioll lw paid to unequal distribution for the two 8tations.

Jordan, wliere n, n 1 equal the rate of change of temperature with height at th{' upper and lower station (as expluine<l further on), does not appear to be sustained iu our case, certainly uot duriugthe night hours, and roughly only for a few hours near noon.
APPLICATION TO HYPSOMETRY OF DR. VON. BAl'ERNFEIND'S TIIEORY !IF A1':1IOSPHERIC REFRACTION AND COMPARISON WITH OBSERVATIONS AT 1\IorNT DIADLn-l\IARTLNEZ EAST.-

For reference to this theory, which makes nse of the meteorological t'.011ditio11 of the atmosphere iu connection with an expression for the cnnature of the path of light between two stations where reciprocal zenith distanct>s ha\ e been measured, see .A.stronom\sche Nad1richte11, ~os. HiS-1480 (vol. 62, 1864), and Nos.1587-1590 (\·ol. 67, 1866), and formulre and application of the same in Coast Survey Report for l87G, Appendix ~o. 16, where I have applied it to the case of hypsometric re· searches at Bodega Head and Ross Mountain, California. This theory enables us to compute the difference of height from tlie measured zenith distances and the observed barometric pressure and t,he temperature and humidity of the air at each station, and two results can he gi,·eu, one from the observations at the U}Jper and one from the observations at the lower station. It would be need· less to repeat here the formulre and their explanation, as they can be conYenicntly refe1·red to in the report for 1876, inasmuch as the _results deduced <lo not fully come up to the expectations which might be demanded from such a theory, and the cause of tllis shortcomi11g would seem to lie in the circumstance that the theory has not sufficient flexibility to accommodate itself to the various physical conditions existing at the time. The results and comparisons are given in the following tables: T.A.BLE XIX.-Oomparison of BauenifeinrFs theory of t·~fraction u'ith obserMtions at ,lfount Diabl-0 and Jfartinez East.

The results of the comparison, as shown in Table XIX, indicate but a slight improvement
(Oru.20) in the computed difference of height, while the departures from the true angle of refraction at both stations (and consequently also in the coefficients of refraction) exhioit most conspicuously a want of accord with facts as observed at Mount Diablo and Martinez East; thus, computed range of angle of refraction at the upper station 2".15, observed range, 19".9 (Table V); same for the lower Rtation, computed, 4 11 .66, obserrnd, 32". 7. Columns 11 and 12 of the preceding table show the discord iu the computed and observed difference in the angles of refraction, while in

columns 13 and 14 the smallness of the range of diurnal variation in the coefficients of refraction is prominentlj' brought out. The theory assumes a uniform decrease of.the atmospheric tempera· tnre with an increase of altitnde, about 0°.58 C. for each 100 meters, a condition which does not hold good in auy pa.rticular case, and probably the fundamental relation postulated between absolute temperature and density of air is not in sufficient accord with facts. It is, however, certain that the atmospheric temperatures observed near the ground are seriously affected by this circumstance aud must lead to faulty conclusions respecting the temperature of the stratum of air interYening between the stations. ·we now proceed to test another theory of refraction, in which special attention is given to ~he rate of decrease of temperature with increase of height.

Oomparing the contents of Tables XIX and XX we find but little difference in the hourly values of resulting difference of height, the two theories giving about the same result; with respect to the angle of refraction, however, there is a considerable difference, the errors tn the angles being more equally distributed between the two stations in .Tordan's than in the Bauernfeintl's theory. We also notice a marked improvement in the diurnal variation of the coefficient of refraction as given in Table XX, and which compares more favorably with the res11Its m0 of Table V. The more important part of the theory is that involving the rate of change of temperature with increase of height. These results are given in Table XXI.

These tabular results iire remarkable and would ,ha,·e been unexpected but for tlie large observed difference in the angles of refraction at the lower and upper station (as shown iu Table V). First, we notice that at the lower station the temperature rises (sign of n1 negatfre) with the altitude, which might be explained by the continued influx at a low level of cold air through the Golden uate and with an effect much greater during the ho.urs of night than duriug the hours of <lay light. A rise in temperature with rise in altitude is not noted here for the first time; in the discussion of the observations at the stations Kupferkuhle and Brocken, as given by Dr. Jordan, there is an increase of temperature with height at the earliest hour of obser,·ation (Gh 35m) in the morning, and had' the observations been continued during the night the law of the diurual rnriation would then necessarily have given negative values of n. The same occurred in the observations at Bo<lega Head and Ross .Mountain, as presented by Captain B. Bartl,· who, in 1881 reviewed the article in the Coast Survey Report for 1876, Appendix. No. 16, containing- the discussion of the observations made at these stations by Assistant Davidson iu March, 1860. His results being supplementary to our article I transfer them to this paper. It will be seen that Captain Hartl extended the comparison of mean temperatures, as observed and required, to the temperatures at each station, thus: let r 1 r 2 be the required or true temperature of the air immediately resting on the lower and upper station as derived from the inversion of the barometric formula (see values of ~ ( r1 + T2) in column~ of Table XVUI for the case Martinez East and l\fount Diablo), wliich gfres r1 + r2. A value for the difference r 1-r2 is obtained by multiplying the average rate of change of temperature or ! (n 1 + ttii) by the difference of height which give~ the total change of ~ (n1+1~) e::. k = r1-T1 a.s found by inversion of the retraction formula (columns 2 and 3 of Table Xl..I for our case). Having the sum and difference the separate values r 1 and r 2 are computed. 'l'hi8 process presupposes that the suppositions involved in the theory respecting the conflition of

the atmosphere, and especially the law of distribution of its temperature, hold for ptirticular cases; comparisons therefore at many places in different climates and at difterent seasons would be most desirable contributions to our knowledge of hypsometry.

It is to be regretted that this series comprises only daylight obervations, but apparently the diurnal law in the mean value n for these stations also points to negative values <luring the hours of the night. We next observe the largeness of the individual values n 1 and n., and the comparative small-

Table XXII contains the apparent corrections required by the observed temperatures at Mar· tinez Eallt and at Mount Diablo as demanded by theory and depending ou a combination of the observed ditte.rence of height by Spirit-level, of the observed zenith distances, and of the obser-rnd a tmosphe1 ic pressures.

Tl.tese apparent corrections compare favorably in sign and magnitude with similar quantities deduced from observations at stations Kupferkuhle-Brocken (6h=!l70.92 meters), as cited hy Dr.·Jordan, arnl with tlte results at stations Bodega Head-Hoss Mountain, California (Glt=598.74 meters.) The observations made by Assistant G. Davidson at Jackson Butte-Round Top, Califomia, of September and October, 1879, will be presented and- discussed as soon as the required spirit-levels have been executetl, and it is intended to utilize the results of these researches for the computation of the heights of the trigonometrical stations in this part of California. In the present paper the mean results only were brought out and submitted to analysis, but should it become desirable to work up the individual observations, au<l scrutinize the results <lay by <lay the meteorological conditions re(1uire to be fully known, and for this purpose the following table of the direction and force of the wind and other information relating to the state of the sky have been appended. Some of .the leading results are shown graphically on the accompanying plate. (Illustration No. 33.]

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
COMPUTING DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

May 6, 1884.

DEAR SIR: Towards the end of March, 1881, Mr. Carlile P. Patterson, then Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, was invite<l to aid and co-operate in the researches proposed by the International Polar Commission, which held its second session at Bern, Switzerland, in August, 1880, H. Wild, president. General W. B. Hazen, Chief of the United States Signal Corps, U. S. A., having notified the Commission that the United States would take part in the undertaking, caused two expeditions to be fitted out, one to proceed to Point Barrow, Alaska, the other to Lady Franklin Bay, Grinnell Land. The Coast and Geodetic Survey was to co-operate in the magnetic work which these parties were to execute by furnishing such magnetic and other instruments as were then available, and by instructing three or four observers of the Signal Corps in their use, besides bearing a part of the expense of the firstnamed expedition, the second expedition having been provided for by special appropriation of Congress.

p ART

J.-lNTRODUCTION.

It was not until near the close of April that these preliminary arrangements were concluded and it was well understood, in consequence of the want of suitable magnetic instruments, and in particular of differential instruments, and owing to the fac' that no trained scientific observers were at the time available, that the Coast and Geodetic Survey could not then follow the minute instructions which had been prepared for the guidance of the various expeditions which were to take part in the work of the Commission. In the words of the Superintendent, we were simply to do for terrestrial magnetism the best that was possible at the time. For the first year at Point Barrow, and during the entire absence of the other expedition, the a8sistance of the Survey was more incidental than fully co-operative, but this condition was considerably improved in the second year at Point Barrow, when we were able to send a set of differential instruments with a newly instructed observer. In the summer of 1883 a special observer was sent in charge of pendulum work, and particularly to verify the magnetic work as well as to redetermine the geographical position and the true meridian or azimuth, but unfortunately he was unable to accomplish anything in consequence of the continued rain, fog, or cloudiness of the sky during the few days he could stay at the place, the state of the ice and the damaged condition of the vessel demanding a speedy embarkation of the whole party. That under these circumstances the magnetic work should fall somewhat short of the accuracy which the Commission had desired it should possess is not surprising; indeed, the Polar Conference found afterwards that so far as the first ~·ear's magnetic work was concerned it appeared to have been undertaken rather prematurely, inasmuch as it coulfl not be supposed that differential instruments of a particular description were ready at band, nor was there sufficient time to procure them. Disclaiming therefore such close co-operation as would have been desirable but which was impossible under the circumstances, the records and results herewith presented are the outcome of faithful labor, and are believed to .be an acceptable contribution to our knowledge of magnetism in high latitudes, and it is thought that in the second year, at least, these records will prove t-0 be a valuable part of the material accumulated by the several expeditions. Later on, in full co-operation with the work undertaken by the International Polar Commis· sion, the Coast and Geodetic Survey established at Los Angeles, Cal., a magnetic observatory and equipped it with a set of Adie's self-recording magnetometers of the Kew pattern. In the spring of 1~82 the adobe building had been constructed by Assistant J. S. Lawson, and in July following the instruments were mounted and the photographic process was arranged by Mr. W. Suess, mechanician Coast and Geodetic Survey. The observatory was ti.Jen permanently turned over to the charge of Mr. Marcus Baker, Coast and Geodetic Survey, under whose direction the absolnte and differential measures have been made unintE.>rruptedly from about the end of September, 1882, to the present time, and it is the intention to continue the work for some years. . In May, 1881, Mr. J. B. Baylor, and, in June following, Mr. M. Baker, of the Geodetic and Coast· Survey, were detailed to instruct, at Washington, Sergeant:.B E. Israel, J. Cassidy, J. Murdoch, and M. Smith, Signal Corps, United St~tes Army, in the use of the se.xtant and the

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

altazimuth for the determination of time, latitude, longitude, and azimuth, and iu tile requisite computations; they were likewise instructed in the use of those magnetic instruments which they were to take with them. Mr. A. 0. Dark was instructed at San Francisco in astronomical observations by Sub-assistant J. F. Pratt, Coast and Geodetic Survey. "'With tile exception of Sergeant Israel, who proceeded to Lady Franklin Hay, the above-named observers formed part of tLe personnel of the Point Barrow party. These observers made the best use of the short time available for their instruction. In May, 1882 1 J. Palmarts and Sergt. J. E . .Maxfield, Signal Corps, United States Arm~-, received instructions from Mr. Baker in the use of the sextant aud the theodolite, and iu June they practiced under Assistant Eimbeck, Coast and Geodetic Survey, with the Brooke differential instruments, which left the office for Point Barrow J nne 14, 1882. The following instructions to the parties were drawn up (June 9, 1881) by the writer, under direction of Superintendent C. P. Patterson:
"INSTRUCTIONS .AND NOTES FOR '.I.'HE GUIDANCE OF THE OBSERVERS TO BE STATIONED AT POINT BARROW, ALASKA, AND AT LADY FRANKLIN BAY, NORTH OF SMITH SOUND, ARC'l'IC OCEAN.

"As soon as the quarters of the expedition lta\'e been fixed upon, a magnetic house will be erected, in which the regular magnetic observations, as described below, will be matle; other observations will be made when on boat or sledge trips. "Instruments.-For the use of the magnatic observatory there will be pro,·idad a magnetometer for absolute and differential declination and for horizontal magnetic intensit~·, to be permanently mounted on a stone pier. In connection with this instrument a meridian or azimuth mark will be established a short distance off the observatory and visible from it through an opening in its wall. The astronomical Liearing of this mark will be carefully determined by means of an altazimuth instrument and solar observations. In the same house, but on a separate pier, will be mounted a Kew dip circle, and in the case of Point Barrow a third instrument, a bifilar magnetometer, will also be permanently mounted on its pier. At Point Barrow the magnetometer (or unifilar) and the bifilar instruments will be mounted in the magnetic meridian and at a distance apart not less than 12 feet, and the dip circle will be mounted equidistant from these instruments, forming an equilateral triangle. At Lady Franklin Bay the two instruments will be mounted in the plane of the magnetic prime vertical and not less than 12 feet apart. No iron is to he used in the construction of these buildings, and they should not be nearer than 50 yards to any other bnildiug, or double that distance to any large mass of iron. Special reading lamps (of copper) must be provided for use with the instruments, aud they must be tested to make sure that they do not affect the position of the magnets. The use of candles, stuck in wooden blocks, is preferable to lamps. "When on boat or sledge journeys the party will carry a chronometer, a small altazimuth instrument, with circles of about 3 inches diameter (as constructed by Fauth & Co., of Washington, or Casella, of London), provided with a magnetic needle or compass mounted over its vertical axis, and a dip circle. "Observations at the permanent station.-Hourly observations will be made for declination and diurnal variation with the magnetometer on three consecutive da~-s about the middle of each month; besides these observations, extending over seventy-two hours, there will be made at any convenient intermediate time each day (of the three) one set of d~flections, followed immediately by a set of oscillations for the determination of the horizontal intensity. At Point Barrow the bifilar will be read immediately after the unifilar. There will also be made at any intermediate time each day (of the three) a set of dip observations. In connection with the declination, the mark will be read ohce each day (unless the instrument should accidentally be disturbed), but it suffices to determine the magnetic axis of the declination magnet on one of three days. The instrumental constants of the magnetometer will be determined before leaving Washington, and the observer will use the Coast and Geodetic Survey magnetic blank forms for their records, or in case no special forms are provided they will use small (octavo) note-books; they will also compute,

soon as the observations are completed each month, the magnetic mean declination, diurnal range, and turning honrs, also the horizontal force in absolute measure (English units) and the dip, tabulating the results for each day. "Extra obsenations on other than the three days about the middle of each month will be made during all occurrences of auroral displays, but as they are likely to be very numerous at Point Barrow, observers there may confine their extra obserrntions to the more conspicuous displays ouly. On these occasions the declinometer (and the bifilar) at Point Barrow will be read every ten minutes, or oftener or less often, as the state of the needle may appear to G.emaud, the object being to ascertain the relation and establish a connection between the appear..ince of the aurora and the motion of the magnetic needle. "When landing, on a boat journey or duriug a sledge journey, at suitable stations (not less than 10 or 15 miles apart), the time, latitude, and azimuth will be determined by the altazimuth instru~ ment, and the declination b,Y the same instrumeut (the hour and minute of the observation is to be noted in order that the diurnal variation may be allowed for); the dip will also be observed, and, in case time is pressing, reversal of circle, reversal of face of needle, and reversal of polarity of needle may be dispensed with, but the needed corrections to the result from the single position of the instrument must be ascertained at the permanent station. Observations of deflections with magnetic needle (and with weights) will be made with the dip circle as arranged for relative and abso· lute total force, the data for the latter to be supplied at the permanent station. "It is highly desirable, especially in the case of the Lady Franklin Bay party, that 'all stations within reach and formerly occupied by other parties for magnetic purposes be revisited in order to furnish material from which to deduce the secular change during the interval ; besides, all opportunities shoukl be taken when landing on the way np to secure observations for declination, dip, and intensity; the latter best by oscillations of the intensity magnet. The winter quarters of the late English expedition should be connected magnetically with the present quarters. "All magnetic observations U'ill be made on Gottingen time, as provided for by the Hamburg Conference.· ".All magnetic work will be kept strictly in conformity with "Notes on measurements of terrestrial magnetism," United Slates Coast Survey, Washington, D. 0., 1877,f and other records in connection therewith should be equally clear and complete, and all computations should be made by the observer in separate books. Duplicates of all records will be made, compared with the original, and the latter returned annually,t if practicable, to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Stu,·ey, "\Yashington, D. 0. The observers should also provide themselves with copies of the 'AdmiraUr Manual of Scientific Enquirj·,' the '.Arctic Manual and Instructions, 1875,' and 'Aurorre, their Character and Spectra, by J. R. Capron, 1880;' also ,with 'Terrestrial and Cosmical Magnetism, by E. Walker, 1866,' and any other work they may require for their information." Besides the above paper, which is printed pages 12-14 in" Instructions No. 72, War Depart· ment, Office of the Chief Signal Officer, Washington, D. C., June 17, 1881," the parties received additional instructions, headed "(2) Obligatory obsermtions in the domain of terrestrial magnetism," and "(3) Elective observations," contained in the same order. .Among these optional observations are mentioned observations of tides and of earth currents ; for both of these phenomena returns were made. The Point Barrow party was also pro>ided with a plan of the magnetic house, and received the following note respecting the adjustment of the bifilar magnetometer, which bad been hastily constructed from some remains of an older instrument. "The portable bifilar magnetometer.-This instrument was reconstructed from such parts as could be found from an old instrument. .A collimator magnet was provided, also a new bitilar suspension, adjustable by means of a right an<l left handed screw in the place of a disk, as originally supplied ; the projecting arms, indicating that the instrument had been arra.ngej} tor an induction inclinometer, were removed.
·This sentence I find added to original report.

t It was then supposed that the parties would remain out for three yea.rs.

t A new edition, the third, ha& since appeared in Appendix No. 81 Coll8t and Geodetic Survey Report for 1881.

The observed variatfon in the horizontal component of the magnetic force will be true only in case the magnetic moment of the suspended magnet remains unchanged during the time of observations, but as every magnet gradually loses magnetism a further correction for loss of magnetic moment is needed; this may be determined by comparing differences of values

of horizontal force as determined by means of the unifilar magnetometer at certain times (and after long intervals) with a series of corresponding readings of the differential instrument. The magnet being an old one, it seems best to examine and readjust the bifilar at the end of ea'ch year or sooner 'in case of necessity. "The north end of the magnet may be turned either to the right or left of the meridian, but it will be desirable to choose that side which will make increasing horizontal force correspond to in· creasing scale readings. "The principal adjustments of the instrument may be summed up as follows: "Level; suspend magnet as unifilar; focus telescope; place scale horizontal and adjust light for distinct vision; take torsion out of suspension; put plane of detorsion in magnetic meridian; determine axis of collimator; determine scale value or value of one division in minutes of arc; point on axis and note corresponding scale reading of magnetic meridian; take off unifilar and substi· tute bifilar tube; place plane of bifilar suspension in magnetic meridian ; point on axis and read torsion circle; test this by turning telescope 1soo in azimuth and bringing the magnet in the reversed position, north end to the south, and read torsion scale; if it reads as before the plane of threads was truly in the magnetic meridian; repeat adjustment if necessary; turn telescope 900 or into the magnetic prime-vertical, and turn in the same direction, the torsion circle until the axis of the collimator appears pointed in telescope; read the torsion circle, it will be 9oo+v from the meridian value; compute the value of k and alter the distance of threads by turning the screw until a satisfactory value for k is found. "The observers will remember that at Point Barrow the horizontal force is about one-half of what it is at Washington. They may also consult Lloyd's Treatise on Magnetism (J,ondon, 1874).'' With reference to co-operation with the Polar Commission during the second year of occupation of the Point Barrow station directions were given by you, May 23, 1882, to prepare the old Brooke magnetographs fot immediate service. These instruments bad been used for many years, first at Key West, Fla.,* and lately at Madison, ·wis., and required thorough overhauling; moreover, photographic registration being out of the question in the Polar regions, they were changed and remounted according to a plan devised by me for direct eye-observations. By extra exertion, with the assistance of Fauth & Co., instrument makers, aud W. Suess, mechanician, this was expeditiously done, and the instruments left Washington ,Tune 14, 1882. The following memorandum was handed to the relief party before starting for Point Barrow:

" M.A. Y 26, 1882. "The magnetic instruments intended for Point Barrow will be the modified Brooke magnetometers, viz : declinometer, bifi.lar or horizontal force magnetometer, and Lloyd's balance or vertical force magnetometer, to be relatively disposed of in a building, as shown in the accompanying diagram. "The size of the observatory was to be 3 by 5 meters, or about 10 feet by 16! feet inside, and Gz to 7~ feet high; size of the brick piers, 0.3 meter square and about 1 meter high; cross-section of telescope pier 0.15 meter by 0.6 long, and of the same height as the instrument piers; the brass cylindrical vessels in the axis of which the magnets are suspended, except the knife-edge of the Lloyd balance which passes through the center, are each of 40 centimeters diameter. This new observatory should be distant from the older one at least 8 meters."

Using the second method a weight lias to be provided corresponding to tlw desirP<l Hensitiveuess and the suspension threads must be regulated in order tbat the additional weight may produce a change of a certain number of divisions of scale when it is added and taken off. "The instrument is provided with a mechanical compensation for chang·es of temperature; in view of the extreme low temperatures which are likely to be experienced at Point Barrow, however, and under the present circumstances it will be better to deduce the corrections for any outstanding amount, not compernmted, difterentially from the observations of the l1orizontal force themselves, than to attempt a complete mechanical compensation. The latter operates ais follows: Referring to accompanying figure, suppose the temperature increases, the effectiYe force of the magnet will diminish, the differential ., expansion of glass and zinc (which materials form the compensation) will push the zi1u: _r-=_:::=l!!IE-~-~-~--~~~~-'.l!.. ~l'=-="'=-==-=,-:=:--==-=::l'!E""""- end in, which bringt; the suispension threadR closer together and thus diminishes the torsion force, balancing II in the same ratio aR II itself diminishes. Increasing scale readings should correspond to increasing horizontal magnetic force or to a movement of, the 1wrth end of tl1e magnet toward the north. The narrow space dividing the fixed from the movahle mirror is in the plane of tlw optit~al axis of tlw telescope. The instrument is placed under a zinc cover.

3. THE VERTICAL FORCE OR BALANCE MAGNETOMETER.

"Put the knife-edge supporting the magnet in the magnetic meridian arnl ltwd :-<upport, tlw magnet will then be free to oscillate in the magnetic prime-vertical; balance the magnet and its appendages ~ (mirror, knife-edge, balancing weigbts, compensation bar, "'llr1" I ,,,,,.1),, etc.) horizontally by means of two weights on op1)osite I sides of the knife-edge, next bring the center of gravity of the system to that particular position dose to and belou· - - - - - - - - the knife-edge, which corresponds to the desired sem;irnin-ar tiveness; this is done by raising or lowering the central hall or weight. Set the mirror so that the middle of the fiu.<l. -.-..· scale (50) is reflected on the thread of the telescope when the magnet is level; at th<' same time this center division must remain bisected as seen in the fixed mirror. Let V = the vertical component of the earth's force, d = the horizontal distance of center of gravity of the system from tlw plan(' of 8Upport passing through the knife-e<lgP, W = weight of magnet and appendages, m =the magnetic moment of magnet, then V m = W d.

The scale value may also be ascertaiued by means of deflections, the magnet beiug Jirst in a horizontal and next in a vertical position (see page 65 of second part of bulletin, St. P(~ternlmrg, 1882).· "The temperature compensatiou originally with the Brooke balancing magnetometer consisted of a glass thermometer tnbe filled with mercury; thi8 has been remoYecl, and a brass arm was sub· stituted as in the A.die instrument. The compensation operates as follows: Suppose the temperature is rising, tlrn .magnetic energy of the horizontal magnet will diminish and grayity will consequently pull the south or imnutrked end of tlie magnet down and thus elevate the marked end, but this is counteracted and the lmlauce restored h_y the exparnsion of the brass arm which is directed to or ou the same si!le as the marked end; the diminution of magnetic moment is thus counteracted by the iucreaHed Jcycragc of the ext(mded brass arm. "Iucreasiug scale readiugs should correspond to increasing vertical magnetic force or to a 1111wement of the north end of tlie magnet dmflnwards. The instrument is placed under cover of a thick plate-glass. "Heferriug to the diagram of the magnetic obserrntory containing the modified Brooke differ. eutial or variation instruments, it will be seen that the north seeking or marked ends of the magnets turn all to tlw inside or toward the telesco11e pier. The directions in which the scafo immbers increaRe are al~;o then· imlicatetl. "Time being wanting for au accnrate mechanical compensation of the force magnetometers, it is the intention that only the greater part of the changt" should be so compensated and corrections applied for the remainder; for this purpose thermometers are inserted, which arc to be rea<l in cou. nection with the scales. 'l'hc data for outstanding t.emperature correction will be had from the ordinar.r hourly obsen·atioH8." The Point Barrow party was also pnt in llOS8ession of the resolutions adopted at the third session of the I nteruatio11al Polar Conference, held at St. Petersburg, August, 1881. From this publication the following· notes wer(·. taken: Tlw differential mag·netic ohsenations for changes of declination, horizontal and vertical com· pone11t8 of the earth's magnetic force are to be made Jwurly and continuously, commencing as soon as possible 011 or aft-0r August 1, 1882, and closing as ]ate as practicable before or on September 1, 188:3.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Lieutenant Ray's party sailed from San I<"&ancisco in the Golden Fleece July u;, and arriv Ooglaamie, near Point Barrow, September 8. The meteorological arnl magnetic station was established near the small Esquimaux settlement of that name,* about 17 kilometers, or 10.Z statute miles, from Point Barrow and to the southward aud westward of it, about 150 meters from the coast of the Arctic Ocean and at an elevation of about:) meters above its level. The geographical position of the station as derived from dead reckoning on board the Golden Fleece is given by Lieutenant Ray,t as follows: latitude 710 17' 50", longitude 1560 23' 45" west of Greenwich. The astronomieal observations at Ooglaamie for position and direction of meridian were made by A. C. Dark, and are contained in Appendix I, hut are not submitted with this rPport. Observations found defectiYe or unreliable from whatever cause have been omitted in this appendix. The latitude here adopted results from two sets of observations; one, of a series of 1louble altitudes of the sun on April 28, 1882, the other, of two sets of single altitudes of the sun about upper and at lower culmination on ,June 24, 1882. The first value, from sextant observations, has been given the weight 4, and the second value, from theodolite ooservations, the weight 1; the resulting latitude becomes cp =71 o 17'.7 with an estimated probable error. of ::!::01.3. According to British Admiralty Chart 2164 the position of Plover Point, where the English relief expedition under Commander R. Maguire, R. N., was stationed in 1852-'3-'4, is in latitude 71° 21' 25" and in longitude 1560 16' 06" west of Greenwich. Following the trend of the coast between the cemetery and the summer camp down to Ooglaamie and converting the linear measures of the chart into difference of latitude 6 cp and difference of longitude 6 A we find for the latitude of Ooglaamie station 71o21'.4-3'.5=71° 17'.!J, and for the longitude of the station J5GO HV.1+28'.4=1560 44'.5 west of GrPenwich. Since neither the first (nautical result) nor the last result (depending on estimated direction and distance) can compare in accuracy with the value deduced at the station I shall adopt the value <p=71° 17'.7. The longitude adopted results fro111 a chronometric determination made by the supply expedition in the summer of 1882 in the Leo, under the command of Lieutenant Powell, Signal Corps, U. S. A. The result as worked out by Mr. ~W. Upton, computer in the office of the Chief Signal Officer, is given in his report appended to" Signal Service Notes No. V. Work of the Signal Service in the Arctic Regions ; prepared under the direction of General Hazen, Washington, 1883." It depends on four chronometers, the sea rates of which could be established from observations at San Francisco before and after the voyage and at Plover Bay, East Siberia, during the voyage, though neither at Plover Bay nor at Ooglaamie did the weather prove favorable. Mr. Upton's result h; 10h 2fim 39· ± 10· or 156° 39' 45" ± 2' 30". It will be seen that this result is intermediate between that der-ivecl from dead reckoning on board the Golden Fleece and from the English determination of their station in 1853 to the southward and eastward of Barrow Point and referred to our station. Moreover, we have two sets of lunar distances from the sun ,July 7, 1882, with the resulting longitude 1011 25m 57·, and a set of lunar distances from .Jupiter as observed at Point Barrow and referred to Ooglaamie by the addition of lm 25·, giving the result 1011 27"' 14·. The mean of these two astronomical determinations is 10h 26"' 36·, which agrees so well with the above chronometric value that I have adopted the latter, viz:
l=lOh 26"' 39· or 156° 39' 45" west of Greenwich.

For the magnetic work we need the difference of longitude between Ooglaamie and Gottingen, Oermany. Ta.king the latter place, Oh 39"' 46·.2 east of Greenwich, we have the required difference lP 06'" 25' ± 10·, by which amount Gottingen js east of Ooglaamie. Tiie magnetic work at Ooglaamie, 1881-'2-'3.-The necessary buildings were erected without delay. October 3, 1881, the party was housed. October 17 the meteorological observations were commenced and the instruments were mounted in accordance with the plan furnished with the
· Calle<l Ootivakl1 on Ivou Petroff's map of Alaska; Tenth CensuH of the United States; Washington, 1882. The name Kokmullit given on this map is that of an Esqulmaux settlement at. Point Barrow; it is called Noowook on the Aclmiralt.y chart of 1853 (No. 2Hl4 ). t Report to Chief Signal Ofticer of September 15, 1881.

instructiom;, but it was not till the fat of December that the maguetometer'1 were adjusted autl the regular hourly magnetic obserYations were recorded. Lieutenant Ra.y remarks : · "The three magnetic instruments were mounted on wooden piers, tbe sea80ll being too far advanced t.o place masonry. Posts 12 inches 8quare were set into the frozen earth to a. depth of 1 foot and cemented into their place by pouring water around them and allowing it to freeze. Tbese·piers answered ever.\- purpm;e, were perfectly solid, and did not change their potlitiou in the slightest degree, and when the ouseffatory was take11 down this summer I found the ice around their base uumelt.ed. As soon as the weather was warm enough, brick pieris capped with stone were placed, and the instrnment8 are now all in position on permanent piers." This operation occasioned an interruption in the hourl_y obsen'ations from Jul;y 2i to .July 30, 1882. This first series closed with September 9, 1882. It includes term-day observations, all\o hourly observations of dipping needle deflected by a constant weight as a substitute for a vertical force measure. These latter obscrvatious of relative total force~ while of small Yalue as differential measures, may nevertheless supply means for computing chauges in the intensity which otherwise would have boon wanting. The supply party in the Leo arrived off Ooglaamie August 20, 1882, with the Brooke mag netometers. They were mounted on urick piers iu a building speciall~· erected for them, and their relative position was in strict confurmit~· with the plan contained in the instruction8. So long as thawing weather continued these piers Jacked somewhat in stability, but the frost isoou rendered them immovable. These instruments having been adju8ted, tllc hourly series of obser,·atious commenced September 12, 1882, an 11 was continued without interruJltiou to August 27, 188..'3. The termday observations and those I/. s. Pokr s~ O°l)ka.-W., ~ for absolute measure were continued throughout the second year of the occupation of the place. It has already been mentioned that in consequence of unfavorable conditions between .August 22 and August 29 (when the station was abandoned) no verification of the l magnetic work could be made I by Mr. R.

& Uo.'s

Tile horir-ontal direetio11 of t.l1e magnetic force at Ooglaamie was determined by meant-; of Fauth 11rng-neto111eter, Coast aud Geodetic Survey, No. 11, mounted on the northern pier of the magnetic oh1wrnttory, lmilt soo11 after the arri>al of tl1e party; in July, 1882, it waR shifted to a new position, where it remainetl to the cloRe of the work. This instrument served for tlH·

absolute HR well aR for differential or variation measures; the latter observations, however, wern discontinued 011 the arrival iu the second year of the Brooke variation instrmneuts. The instru. ment waH not well adapted for differential work, as has been stated. From returns brought home in the "Leo" it was evident that the decliuations were defoetivc, for some reason uot then appareut; all'.lo that the magnet, which was a uew one, had parted with mueh of its nmgnetiRm. It lwcame desirable, therefore, practically to test the condition of t.lte instrument for accurate work as soon as this could be done. It was returned to the office at 'Va1:ihiugton, .Januar;\' 12, 188±, and after LUHlergoing so.me trifling repairs due to defective packing, Sergeant Maxfield was directed to determine the declination with it at the magnetic obscn'atory iu this city,* ahm to furnish some additional nrnasnres of the instrumental constants, those obtained l>.v Sergcaut Smith i11 .Tune, 1881, uot ueiug deemed sufficient. These measures proved that the instrument was still in a satisfactory condition. When the full returns came to hand it became evident that the discrepancies noticed in the mouthly values of the declination were due to a want of attention to the suspension fiber. The plane of detorsiou was apparently place<l in the magnetic meridiau in December, 1881, hut no further test or adjustment was made till March, 1883; dlU'ing this period the force of torsion had gradually increai,;ed (from unknown causmi) and affected the decliuatiou to the amount of nearly 52° in September, 188:!; after tliil' date this deflection remained perfectly steady until remoYed in l\fareh, 188:~. Por the first six months the mouthly results refer to the mean declination of the day (from twenty-four hourly values), but after the arrh·al of the Brooke differential instruments the declinations were referred to the mean of the respective months through hourly corresponding readi11i..:1> of the Fauth & Oo. magnetometer No. 11 and tlrn Brooke declinometer. These correspondiug readings generally extend O\cer six hours on each day of observation. The record a11d computation of the absolute measures are contained in Appendix II. 11ot suhmittetl herewith. PJacing little reliance on the determination in December, 1881, on account of a weak aHtro11ornical azimuth, and omitting for the present all results of 1882 and those for 1883 up to the mitltllc ot March, we ban~ the following reliable values, which rest on a new astronomical azimuth det.e.rmim·.tl July :!;I, 1883, and which are roughly checketl by a second measure taken on the Brooke declination pier Au~ust 31, 1883, the same markt being used aud all clista11ccs being knowu.

The two values witliin parenthesis in column headed rare interpolated: Mean reading of declinometer for the last five mouths 476d.2 and for the preceding five months 488d.4, hence difference for five months 12d.2 or monthly change 2' .4~ and the first interpolated value becomes 4 x 2.4 + 488.4=498.0. The fifth column gives the computed declination corresponding to difterence r0 -r or for the reading r, and the torsion correction is determined by the difference D - D'. Our completed series when compared with the preceding series (March to August, 1883) exhibits necessarily a trace of the comparatively rapid monthly decrease in the differential series between Fehrnary, 1883 (mean 489Ji), and May, 1883 (476.1), but the magnitude of the errors of observation of the absolute measures forbids an:r attempt at correction of the differential series. Omitting the value for August, 1882, we finally have the table of absolute values as follows:

·Answering to the epoch March 1, 1883, whieh is preferred to the value deduced above for the epoch June 1, 188:3. The corresponding value of the Brooke declinometer reading is 487. 7 ~

Hcspecting the annual change of the declination, due to the secular variation, we know from the general discussion of the secular variation, Appendix No. 12, Coast and Geodetic Sun'ey 1-Gcport for 1882, that the eastern declination in Alaska is now diminishing. The expression for the secular variation at the two stations nearest to Point Barrow, viz, Port Clarence, in cp=65°17' and A=1G6°19' west of Greenwich, and Chamisso Island, in cp = 66013'.3and;\=161°48'.7 west of Greenwich, give for the annual change in 1880 and 1885 the values + 10'.3 and + 11'.3 for Port Clarence) and + 10'.7 and + 12'.0 for Chamisso Island, and we have to expect a greater value at Point Barrow. Captain Maguire determined the declination at that place in 1853 and found - 40° 21 ', or, when red need to Ooglaamie, about - 4()0 36', which, compared with our value above, gives almost exactly a diminution of 5? between 1853:and 1883. It is known from the otber stations that this declination has not passed through a maximum within the last thirty yea.rs, but bas diminished gra<lually with an accelerating rate. For uniform speed the annual change would be +10'; it is therefore probably near +15' for the present time. The absolute measures, September,

to Augmst, 1883, would give the value+ 281 .4, which is known to be much too great, and it we fall back on the differential series we obtain a Yalue but a tritte less and undoubtedly affected by torsion in the suspension skein of the decliuometer, which was never re-examined after the first adjustment had been made. Omitting the reatliugs between March and 1\pril, when the torsion was most pronounced, a discussion of the five monthly means, November, 1882, to February, 1883, inclm1ive give a monthly change m = - 01.97, an(l a discussion of the four monthly means, for May, June, July, and August, 1883, give m = - 11 .15, but if April be included m = - 1 1.92, mean = - 11 .53; mean of first ancl last Yalue - 11 .25, hence annual change - 151 .0, which is adopted as the most probable value.
R.ESULTS OF THE l\IAG-NETIC DIP.

The observations were made with Kew dip circle,· L. Casella (London), No. 4370, or Coast and Geodetic Survey No. 23. It remained mounted on its pier in the small magnetic o\Jservatory during the stay at Ooglaamie. The instrument left Wasltingtou June 23, 1881, aud was returued .January 12, 1884, only sustaining the breakage of one of the dipping needles. TeRt obserrntions made by Sergeant Maxfield at Washington in January and Febru~ry, 1884, on four da;ys, gaYe vers satisfactory results. (See results for intensity.) Observations were generally made on three days each montb. Tlie series commences with Novemuer 307 1881, and ends with August 14, 1883. It does not appear that there is any apprcciahlc difference in the results by needles 1 and 2; they are therefore combined indiscrimi!Tatcly. The following monthl,v means are made up from the individual results, and they are here arranged with a view of deducing, if practicable, from the monthly values taken at an inte1Tal of a year, a ,·alne for the annual change of the dip, independent of an~· annual variation:

If tlte results exhibited in the la::it col11rn11 of the table can be trusted for such small differences from the mean (8to 2:3'.l), the,v would indicate a slightly greater dip about the time of the \'erual equinox and a sliglitly smaller dip about the tinw of tlie autumnal equinox.

General r,efroy also states that at Fort ltae, Great Slave Lake, the present rate of the secular yariation is-1'.7 per annum, tletcrmi11e1l from comparisons of observations b,y Capt. II. P. Dawson with an earlier deduction. Both at Washington and Toronto the dip reached a maximum in 185!1, at which time it is nearly certain that the total force ha<l been (foclining for some years. In 185:3, Captain Maguire, R. N., found the <lip at Plover Point, about 2k nautical miles southeast of Barrow Point, 810 36' (Phil. 'l'ra11s.

DIP OBSERVATIONS.

This method has the great adnmtage of being independent of the temperature and of any loss of magnetism of the needle, alHl applies well for stations in high magnetic latitude. 'l'he monthly olrnen·ations for intensity with the dip circle at Ooglaamie commence in June, 188'.!, and terminate with August, 1883. ·washiugtou, D. C., was selected as a base station and the value of the constant A=Ho sec Rov'sin u0 sin u'o sec 170 became known from the observations of Sergeant Maxfield in January and February, 1884. 'Ve have for the deflecting weight employed at Ooglaamie pre,·ious to September, 1882, the values: 110 =410 04'.4 from 12 sets of observations, Lloyd's needle No. 4 weighted; February 15, 188-i.

The topography of the accompanying map is compiled from surveys of 1853 (by Captain l\Iaguire, R N.), and of 1881-'83 (by Lieutenant Ray, l:'. S. A.); for the positions and names of the ismall lakes northeast of Ooglaamie I am indebted to Sergeant l\Iurdoch. The two astronomical statious are laid down by their observed latitudes alHl longitudes. The distribution of the magnetic <kc1ination for 1883 is shown by two isogouic lines, the direction and distance of which are taken from my paper on the <listribution of magnetism in the United States (Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1882, Appendix No. 13). The isocliuic and isodynamic (horizontal force) lines incline about 500 west of north, or about :;o more than the isogonic lines, but no precise data are :wailable.

I. The obserrntions of the first year of occupation consist of hourly readings of the Fauth & Co- magnetometer, Coast and Geodetic SnrYey No_ 11; of the bifilar magnetometer, Coast and Geodetic Survey No.~; and of dip circle, Coast and Geodetic Survey No- 2:3, comprising 1'a.riation8 in the magnetic declination, in the horizontal aud in the total intensities between December, 1881, and September, 1882; together with term-day readings at the beginning and middle of each month, as agreed upon for the Polar stations. There were four observers, viz: Sergt. James Cassidy, Sergt. John Murdoch, Sergt. Middleton Smith, and A. C. Dark. They took regular turns, each obserdng four lwurs at a time. Fifteen readings were taken each hour, five for each instrument, viz: six minutes and three minutes before and after and at tbe full hour, commenci11g with the declinometer and immediate!~· followed by readings of the bifilar and dip instruments. The temperature was noted. The presence of an aurora is indicated by an ai:;terisk. The instmmental outfit of the second year of occupation being far more complete tl1an that of the first year, only i:;o much of the record aud discussion of the first year's work will be given here as seems desirable; further consideration will be given to this year's record after the presentation of the second ~'ear's work. II. Tbe observations of the second year of occupation consist of hourly readings of the Brooke magnetometers, comprising variation8 in the magnetic declination, in the horizontal intensity aud in the vertical intensity between September, 1882, and .ttugust, 1883, together with term· day readings on the 1st and 15th of each month, as agreed upon for the Polar stations. The observations were made by six observers, viz: Sergeants Murdoch and Smith and Mr. Dark, as in the 11revions year, and Sergt. J. E. Maxfield with Privates C. Ancor and J. Guzman; they took watches of four hours each in regular rotation. Six readings were taken every hour, viz: the horizontal force magnetometer was read one ancl one-half minutes before and again one and one.half minutes aftR.r the full hour, the declinometer was read one minute before and one minute after, and the vertical-force magnetometer one-half minute before and one-half minute after the full ltour. The temperature was noted by two thermometers suspended inside the cases or zinc covers of the horizontal-force magnetometer and of the declinometer. Suitable centigrade thermometers had been ordered, but they were not recefred in time and none was placed inside the case of the \·ertical-force magnetometer; the temperature of this magnet can be inferred from the mean of the readings of the thermometers of the other instruments, which rarel_y deviated more than half a degree. The presence of an aurora is indicated by an asterisk.

The most pronounced feature of tbe diurnal variation is the morning extreme easterly deflection between 7 and 8 a. m.; this is in perfect accord with the times of eastern elongation at stations in lower latitudes, thus at Sitka· 8 a. m.; at Madison, Wis., 8t; at Toronto, 7ii;; at Philadelphia, 7i; and at Key West, 8i;. The afternoon westerly deflection, howe\"er, appears to be delayed when compared with stations to the south of Ooglaamie; we have a maximum about 5 p. m., and a

As it appeared to me highly desirable to compare the diurnal variation of the declination at Ooglaamie with that of Sitka, I haYe made a combination of the hourly readings from ~he broken ancl irrt>gular series extending from 1848 to 1862.

son, 1~ p. m.; at Toronto, OJi p. m.; at Philadelphia, lt; and at Key 'Vest, li. At Sitka there is no trace of the irregular western deflections recorded at Ooglaamie between 8 p. m. and about 2 a. m., as 11hown by the table in the foot-note. If we now refer to the observations made at Point Barrow during 1852-'53-'54 (Phil. Trans., ml. 147, 1857) we find 8 a. m. to be distinctly the hour of the maximum of the easterly disturbances which thus re-enforce the regular solar diurnal variation about this time and produce the great easterly deviation exhibited by the diagram. On the other hand, the westerly disturbances reach their maximum between the hours 11 p. m., midnight, and 1 a. m., when they obliterate the regular solar diurnal variation. Retaining the disturbances the eastern maximum deflection is recorded between 7 and 8 a. m.; excluding the larger ones it occurs near 7 a. m.; the western maximum, disturbances included, is recorded at 5 p. m. (with a second maximum between 10 and 11 p. m.), but excluding the larger ones the elongation reverts to 1. p. m. It is also a noteworthy fact that the diurnal variation seems to depend little on the season, the deviations from the annual course for the half year with sun north of the equator and for the half year with sun south of the equator being small.
SEPARATION OF THE LARGER MAGNETIC VARIATIONS OR SO-CALLED DISTURBANCES, AND

THEIR DISCUSSION.

In the Jlresent state of our knowledge there appears to be no other means of recognizing socalled disturbances in a series of observations except by their magnitude; that is, for any one observation or reading taken at random it is impossible to say how much of the measured quantity is due to the regular daily variations and how much to other variations following different laws. Having formed preliminarily for any one month hourly average or normal values and compared each obserrntion at any hour with the normal at that hour, the series of differences so obtained will disclose the amount of the so-called disturbances, and a certain limiting value requires to be found which shall separate the apparently regular values from the supposed disturbed values, i.e., those following different laws from the others. Jn the discussion of that large body of magnetic material which had accumulated, mainly through the support of the British Government, about the middle of the present century, General Sir Edward Sabine was guided in his selection of a limiting value simply by practical considerations or by experience, and the eminent success which he had fully justified his method, yet when a number of simultaneous observations made at different stations, as in the case of the present Polar researches, require strict intercomparability of results, a more definite proceeding appears desirable. I had made use of Peirce's criterion for the rejection of doubtful observations· -or, here more appropriately expressed, for the separation of observations deviating largely in amount by reason of their following different laws from those to which the ordinary observations are subject-and in using the criterion in such a case it was put forward only with a view of securing some definite rule, uniformly applicable. The criterion was first employed by me in the discussion of-Dr. Kane's magnetic observations of 1853-'54-'55 at Van Rensselaer Harbor, North Greenland ;t afterwards for Dr. Bache's magnetic observations of 1840-'45 at Philadelphia,t and for the United States Coast Survey magnetic series of 1860-'66 at Key West, Florida.§ In these applications, where no great precision is required, its method of application may be much simplified; thus the mean deviation or the mean difference of any hourly value from its hourly normal may be found, without the trouble of forming squares, by the simple expression E 1.25 f6 J and the limiting value given by the criterion will be=x e, the

value of x being a tabular value for the case µ=l, and readily had from Ohauvenet's Table X.

UNITED STATES OOAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY. The limit so found will be the widest one that may be employed, but in special applications it may require contraction, for the reason that the nuru ber of the largest disturbances is found to be insufficient for their successful di1:1cussion. ln'3tead of using Peirce'" criterion we can, however, arrive at an equally satisfactory fixation of a limit by means of the expressions of either the probable or the mean error of an observation.· We may define the widest limit as that deviation or difference from the mean which exceeds 3.5 times the probable yariability or probable deviation of an observation,· this limit corresponds to 3·5 or to 2.36 times the mean deviation (as already 1.48;) · used in connection with the criterion). Thus 21 times the mean deviation would be a superior times limit, whereas Dr. Lloyd (1874) adopts for the discussion of the disturbances a limit of the average departure of a reading from its normal. By taking this lower limit we necessarily include a number of disturbances of lesser magnitude, but should the limit be drawn still closer there is danger of confusing the results with values following different laws from those which govern the larger disturbances. It would be most desirable to investigate the disturbances by a series of graduated limits and falling between these extremes. A limit somewhere between 2 and li times the mean deviation will probably be found most satisfactory. To find the mean deviation :26 e=l.25 n-i say frorn an hourly series of observations extending over one year, the diurnal as well

as the annual variations of the disturbances must be taken into account, and it will suffice to deduce 24 numerical values for e, using for the first month the hours 0 and 12, for the second month the hours 1 and 13, for the third the hours 2 and 14, etc., and, finally, to take the average (e) from the 24 individual values so obtained. Discussing the hourly variations of tlle declination recorded in the second year at Ooglaamie, where the horizontal components H =1.936 English units ( =0.8927 Gaussian units, or 0.089f7 dynes) for October, 1882, the value of e equals 18'.4 nearly; hence limit by Peirce's criterion =44', and the same for 21 times e; for twice e the limit is 37', and for 1~ cit ii! 28', which limits separate, respectively, 1 disturbed observation in 17 observations, 1in12, and 1in8. General Sabineis limit in the discussion of Captain Maguire's observations of 1852-'53-'54 waR 221.87, and the m1mber of disturbances separated was between one-fifth and one-sixth of the whole number, but it should be remarked here that at that time we were approaching an epoch of a sun-spot minimum, whereas at present we have just passed through a sun-spot maximum, during which the disturbances are greater. ' It has been noticed that a limit adopted for a station in low magnetic latitude will not serve to deduce a limit for a station in high magnetic latitude when having regard only to the supposition that the limits are inversely proportional to the magnitude of the horizontal components of their respective magnetic intensities. The disturbances appear to increase in greater ratio as we approach the magnetic Pol:w.- regions. f The further discussion of the differential observations must be deferred until after a decision has been reached by the Fourth International Polar Conference (to meet shortly at Vienna) respecting the limit of recognition of disturbances (April 5 1 1884).

The length of one division of the scale is 1 millimetre ; the radius mirror to metres; hence angular value of one division of scale =1'. (1.)

· Here of course the differences of the tabular hourly readings from their respective hourly normals do not, in any sense, represent errors, every one being a.s correct as any other; they are variations governed by unknown law!! probably of much complexity. The application of the formulre of the method of least squares to such phenomena is more or le88 precarious; the pure observing error may be regarded as insignificant. t Thus with the limit of 2'.6 at Key West (H=6. 74) the Ooglaamie limit would be 9' 1 abont; with the limit of 3'.6 at Philadelphia (H=4.17) the Oogla.amie limit wonld be 8', about; with the limit of 5'.0 at Toronto (H=3.53) the Ooglaamie limit would be 111, about.

mirrors were made to read 500 on the scale. The torsion weight was then removed and the magnet inserted, and the torsion circle turned to read 248° 35'. The movable mirror was next brought to read 500 by means Qf the screw regulating the distance between the two suspension threads. The angle z=3240 42' -2480 35'=76° 07' was calculated to answer the desired value of one division of the scale to represent a variation of the horizontal force of .001 cos fi expressed in metric units, mm., mg., s. By inackertence, a mistake was made by the observers in their calcuJation (in the value of H), so that the scale value neither for the horizontal nor for the vertical force corresponds to the value proposed by the president of the Polar Commission. This was not discovered by them until near the close of the obseryations, when they judged it best to adhere to the old value. The magnetometers were thus given a sensitiveness fully double of what it was intended they should have. The consequence was that many of the largest disturbances in the horizontal and vertical components failed to be registered, the deflections falling beyond the range of the instruments. We have the scale value k iu parts of the horizontal force= cot z times 1' =.00007190, and multiplying by H or 1.939 the scale Yalue becomes .0001394 English units. (2.)

The angle z equals 760 07' ; hence k or. the scale value remains as above. The apparent change iu the plane of detorsion of 50 59' is due to shift of instrument. (3.) November 6, 1882, 10h p. m., to Nornmber 7, 211 31m a. m., Gottingen time, readjusted instrument. With plane of detorsion in meridian torsion circle read 520 46', a<ljusted movable mirror to 50, when torsion circle read 3220 46'. Suspended magnet and made torsion circle read 247° 12', brought mornble mirror to 50 by means of adjusting screw. z=750 34'; hence k=.00007487 parts of the horizontal force, and multiplying by H the scale value becomes .0001452 English units. (4.) February 27, 1883, 311 05m a. m. to 6h 55m a. m., Gottingen time, readjusted instrument. Plane of <letorsion in magnetic meridian torsion circle reads 520 35' ; movable and fixed mirror adjusted to 50 with torsion circle 3220 351 ; suspended magnet and turned circle to 2470 14', and brought movable mirror again to 50 by meaus of the adjusting screw. z=750 21; hence k=.00007604 parts of the horizontal force and the scale value .0001474 English units. (5.) February 28, 1883, 11i 13m a. m. to 311 37m a. m., Gottingen time, readjusted instrument. Plane of <letorsion in magnetic meridian 40° 22'; turned to 310° 22' with fixed and movable mirror at 50; suspended magnet, and turned to 235° 01' with movable mirror at 50 by means of the screw. z=75° 21'; hence scale values as in preceding case.

l N OTE.-The recapitulation of the monthly mean va.Jnes of the hourly readings of the Brooke bifilar magnetometer, which ill given in the following tables, is deemed sufficient forthe 1mrposes ofthie report; the readings themselves have therefore been omittOO.J

The montltly means of the bifilar readings appear quite irregular, produced by large uisturb_ anccs and by change in adjustment; the latter hecame necessary in consequence of the effect of temperature and moisture on the suspension. During the winter the ollsernttory llecame thicklJcoated with ice on its sides and roof, which, during thawing weather kept the interior atmosphere in a state of extreme moisture; tlte obsen-ed Yariatious iu the length of the suspensiou fibers and in the torsion of the two declination instruments may he thus accounted for, and the greater or less stiffness of the fibers was probably occasioned h,r moisture <lql08itnd upou it, freezing and thawiug alternately. The effects on the readings of changes of ternperatme and gradual loss of magnetism· of the magnet or of secular change, are small compared wiHt the abon irregularities from other causes. lt would seem desirable to use metallic snspcusion in the plaec of silk. The September mean (619.5) was corrected to 51!).l by application of a rough correction of -318 divisions to the readings of the'first six days, found by comparison with the mean of the succeeding six days. In August, 1883, the mean reading was higher (G39.7) than at any other time, and it was evident that the adjustment of the instrument had from some unknown cause been di8turhed; one of the observers (Mr. Maxfield) states that when he took down the instrument on the 27th lte found the adjusting screw which holds the thread an cl determines the distance between the threads worked rather loosely in its hearings, whereas it was very tight when the instrument was first set up. It is difficult to fix upon a particular time wheu the rapid increase in the readings commenced, but it was most probably between August 7 and 8, and lasted for two or three days before the instrument settled again to n, fixed condition; a slow progressive motion is apparent from the last days of July. For our present purpose the matter is of little importance, siuce we shall deal strictly in a differential way, only aiming at roughly comparable absolute readings. In order to reduce the monthly readings during August roughly to a uniform scale a correction of - 187 .0 diYisions was applied.
·The Brooke magnets are now over thirty years old: they were nsecl at 'Vashington in 1853.

Temperature coefficient.-There were no special observations made to ascertain the effect of changes of temperature on the magnetic moment of the biti.lar magnet; the instrument was mechanically compensated as near as could be judged; we ba,·e therefore to determine the outstanding effect by means of the ordinary hourly readings. During 1882 one lamp was oontinuous:y burning in the observatory, but early next year three lamps were kept burning, the supply of oil being greater than was at first supposed. The annual average temperature in the observatory, as shown by a Fahrenheit thermometer inside the zinc co\·er of the bifilar, was + 19°.0 or - 70,22 c. In consequence of the irregnlarities in the stara of the instrument, as shown by the monthly mean reading~, the only available method for deducing the temperature coefficient g appeared to be that of selecting a number of conseeutive and undisturbed days at times when the temperature

At Ooglaamie the daily maximum value of the horizontal force occurs between the hours 5 and 7 p. m., and the daily minimum about 7 a. m.; there is also a very slight indication of a secondary disturbance in the regular progression between 3 and 5 a. m., corresponding probably to a secondary maximum about 6 a. m., as exhibited at Toronto, and more strongly at Philadelphia at 5il a. m., where it constitutes the principal maximum, the secondary occurring at 4 p.·m. The maximum at Toronto takes place between 4 and 5 p. m., and the minimum about 10 a. m. The diurnal inequality in tlle whole deflecting force acting in the llorizontal plane may be exhibited graphically both in direction and magnitude as in the aunexed diagram. The origin of the co-ordinates represents the normal declination and horizontal force, and any line drawn from it to any part of the curve will represent its dir~ection and magnitude (according to scale of diagram), the deflecting force acting at the time marked against that point. If for any time the angle !/.· equals the westerly deflection of the horizontal needle, the deflecting force producing the same is H sin ¢·, and when expressed in parts of the horizontal force, simply sin i/1· A deflection of 'f' minutes corresponds to ij 1~.t or 0.000291 ¢'parts nearly. Tllo table of the solar diurnal variation of the declination contains the values of ¢ for every hour of the day, and the corresponding change in the force at right angles thereto is contained in the preceding table of the variations of the horizontal force; these two components, the westerly and northerly, appear combined in the diagram. It will be seen that the disturbing forces act more energetically in a plane approaching closer to the true than to the magnetic meridian, and that the ,usual character of the representation is changed by their action, that half of the curve containing the hours 21 (9 p. m.) to 2,Z a. m. being thrown far to the westward, forming a loop, and beyond the branch containing noon ; on the other band the great extension of the deftecting force between 7 and 8 a. m. is wholly due to the great activity of the easterly disturbances about these hours. This will become clear when the disturbances have been separated from the normal deflecting forces, and 3 diagram for the latter alone is presented.

THE VERTICAL FOHCE MAGNETOMETER..

The length of one division of the scale is 1 millimeter; the radius mirror to scale is 1.719 meters, hence angular value of one division of scale= 1'. In consequence of the great sensitiveMss given to the instrument, which was nearly double of what it was intended it should have, a few of the largest disturbances during November were beyond the range of the instrument and thus failed to be recorded. · (1.) Adjustment and determination of scale value September 9, 1882, noon. The kmfe-edge was brought into the magnetic meridian on the leveled agate supports, the magnet was balanced, and a.t Uh 22m p. m., Gottingen time, the fixed and movable mirrors were made to read 500.

Hence T,=18·.295
Hence scale value for the time preceding April 27, using T=7".816, one division=0.0002413 parts of the vertical force or 0.003086 English units, and after April 27 using T=6·.97 4, one dh·is· ion=0.0003031 parts ofthe force or 0.003376 English units. (8.) May 3, 1sg3, magnet of balance magnetometer ra.ised on support and loweretl between 11 and 12 p. m. {Gottingen time). Found time of one oscillation in the vertical plane=8".750, hence with T,=18·.295 one division of the scale= 0.0001926 parts of the vertical force or 0.002462 English units. (9.) May 21, 1883, at 3 a. m., Gottingen time, magnet fell off support; replaced it, aud determined time of one oscillation 8°.700; hence one division of scale=0.0001948 parts of the vertica1 force or 0.002490 English units. · Increasing sea.le readings denote increasing vertical force.

The numbers contained in the last three columns of this table were plotted on the accom panying diagram, which shows the vertical force to be in excess of its average value in the (local) morning hours, maximum about 6 a. m., and in deficiency in the (local) afternoon hours, minimum about 9 p. m. Compared with the variation of the vertical force at more southern stations there appears to be a complete inversion of the hours of greater and of less intensity, which may ·be due to the action of disturbances, or, if regular, it may be somehow connected with the circumstance that Ooglaamie is near the central zone of maximum auroral display and a little to the north of it. We note the apparent greater range of the diurnal variation in the half year including the winter than in the other six months, which is also an anomalous phenomenon. The breakage of the magnetic and electric equilibrium in the vicinity of this auroral zone, resulting in an outburst of disturbances, probably occurs more frequently within this belt than outside of it, and possibly sudden changes of temperature may be favorable circumstances of disruption. The belt of maximum auroral development seems to be subject to fluctuations in position, and in studying the supposed connection of auroras with terrestrial magnetism attention at should be directed to the local direction in which the aurora appears at a station, i. Ooglaamie, whether to the south or to the north of the zenith. The increased dip and total intensity in the Ooglaamie morning hours as contrasted v.ith the diminished dip and intensity of the total force in the afternoon hours is corroborated by the observations made in the first year by means of the dip circle and deflecting weight.

In presenting the foregoing results of the three variation instruments I had two o\tjects in view, viz : to be in a position to form a close estimate of the character and value of the whole series of observations preparatory to their full analysis and discussion, and, secondly, to give at once, but preliminarily, such leading results as could be deduced without waiting for the publication of the conclusions of the conference for the uniform treatment of the magnetic work at the International Polar stations. What has been presented will in general enable the reader to form a judgment of the magnetic character of the Ooglaamie station and of the value of the work done. As has been already pointed out, there were no well adapted magnetic variation instruments available in the first year; the range of the collimator scitle was very limited, aud the declinometer had frequently to be turned in azimuth in order to secure readin~ on days of disturbance, besides the great changes in the torsion of the suspension renders it impossible to produce a uniform series with respect to a fixed direction. The record for the first year of the bifilar magnetometer has not yet been sufficiently examined to form an opinion as to its value, and at present I am still waiting for notes bearing on the adjustment and scale value of the instrument. There was then no vertical-force magnetometer, but hourly observations were made with a dipping needle deflected by a constant weight; corresponding values for the true dip or deflections by the same needle which bad previously been used loaded were only made on two or three days each month, so that the value of this series as a differential measure of the total force may be regarded as small. It bas, however, enabled me independently to verify the fact brought out by the balance magnetometer of the greater total intensity during the morning than in the afternoon hours. There is no record of the effect of temperature changes on the angle of deflection of the loaded needle. In the year 1881-'82 there were but few stations with which to compare results, and to publish the above-mentioned records in extenso would seem to me an expenditure of time and labor hardly to be recommended, and probably not warranted by the meager results the series may be capable of yielding. I would propose to set down the mean of the 10 readings (5 with

UNITED ST.ATES CO.AST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

scale extreme left and 5 with scale extreme right) for each instrument, viz: the declinometer and bifilar and the mean of the 10 readings of the dipping needle (5 for south.and 5 for north end) for each observing hour, and during term days it would suffice to give only the mean of the two extreme scale readings. But on these points the result of the deliberations at Vienna may be awaited. I conclude this report with a table of frequency of the aurora as seen and recorded in con necti<m with the magnetic work at Ooglaamie :
Tab"le of frequency of the aurora as observed at Ooglaa.mie, Alaska, between October, 1881, and August, 1883.
[The hours are local mean time hours at Ooglaamie, and the numbers indicate the number of days in each month when aurora11 were seen at ea.ch of the hours indicated.]

Observations began October 17, 1881, and ended August 27, 1883.

The presence or absence of an aurora was noted a few minutes before each full hour. The total number of <lays when auroras were visible in the first ten and one-half months (1881-'82) was 145, hence, the average duration five and one-half hours nearly; the total number of days when auroras were seen in the year ending .August, 1883, was 169, hence, the average duration seven and one-third hours nearly. In the tabulation and preparation of the manuscript record for the printer I had the assistance of Sergeant Maxfield and Private G. W. Knopf, of the Signal Corps, who performed their task with much -zeal and commendable industry; they have also prepared a complete duplicate of the hourly records submitted, but not printed, with this report.

REPORT ON THE PREPARATION OF STANDARD TOPOGRAPHICAL DRAWINGS .
.By EDW"IN HERGESHEIMER, Assistant Coast and

SEOOND SERIES

·waskingtan, Febrttary 12, 1884. DEAR Srn : I submit a second report upon the progress of the preparation of standard topographical drawing. Scale 1-10000. r The first report (Appendix 11, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report of 1879) dealt with the prevailing features (natural and artificial) of the Atlantic coast. The drawings herewith presented are special types, most of which are accompanied by views placed in their proper relation to the plan drawings. Little, therefore, need be said in addition to what is shown on their faces. The drawings are: 1. A portion of the Potoma.c River and its banks, above Harper's Ferry, showing specially a railroad tunnel, water-worn rocks, middle drift sands, a river dam, and a mill.race to the former Government works at Harper's Ferry. 2. .A. gulch in disintegrated bituminous slate near Santa Cruz, Cal., with stratification of very gentle dip. This subject is drawn on 1-5000 scale, to give the details of the gulch more distinctly. 3. Brown's Mountain, Mount Desert Island, Maine. A rounded summit of a granite mountain, believed to be the result of the planing action of ice and its transported rocks. 4. Robinson's Mountain, Mount Desert Island. Abraded rock faces of a granite mountain. 5. Echo Mountain, Mount Desert Island. Cliff of a granite mountain, and fresh-water lakes. 6. Eagle Cliff, Mount Desert Island. Crest, face, and talus of a granite cliff. 7. Cape Disappointment, Washington Territory. A basaltic promontory. 8. The Dalles of the Columbia River. A remarkable erosion of eruptive rocks, where a great river baa cut through successive basaltic overflows, leaving a. narrow gorge trough, and a succession of bold basaltic escarpments. Also, a. representation of a rapid river torrent. Other special types have been drawn :-the moraines of Fal1en Leaf Lake, California, a portion of Table Mountain, California, illustrating the "Deep Placers," the vicinity of Plymouth, M888., illustrating the eroded "Great Drift" of New England, and a sample of marine erosion of a headland on the Pacific coast. These will form part of a third report when engraved. Respectfully yours, E. IIERGESHEIMER, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey. Prof. J. E. HILGARD, 8uperiatendent ()out and Geodetic 8urvey.

REPORT ON THE PREP AR.A.TION OF ST.A.ND.A.RD TOPOGR.APIDC.A.L DR.A.WIN<1S, BY EDWIN HERGE· SREIMER, .ASSIST.A.NT COAST .A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.
FIRSP SERIES.

[From the report for 1879.]
OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES Co.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Washington, July 1, 1879. Sm: In the preparation of topographical drawings to be used as guides for inking the original plane-table sheets of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, selection was first made of such features, natural and artificial, as are most prevalent on our coasts. The first subject was the representation of closely-built cities, comprising large public buildings, warehouses, &c., and suburban villas and grouni;Is of the first class. Newport, R. I., was selected for this purpose, where it was found desirable to discontinue the inking of large buildings in foll black, and to confine the black to the exterior, representing the outer walls, and to tint the interior by fine lines closely ruled. Carriage-ways and walks of villa or public grounds are here represented in full light line, instead of the broken line formerly used. Fresh marsh is also represented in a style different from that heretofore in use. Its representation had previously been by irregularly distributed tufts of grass, underlined by free hana with water lines, which, drawn with taste, is perhaps the most artistic representation of the feature, but which is seldom represented the same by any two persons. It was therefore thought best to introduce a style that could be definitely described and required. For this purpose lines of the same strength and the same distance apart as those of the salt marsh are ruled and irregularly broken, then interlined and tufted by free hand with light short lines grouped irregularly, as shown in the first of the series of skerohes accompanying this paper. For the representation of a town sparsely settled, Brunswick, Gtt., is given, on which salt marsh, pine woods, ditches, fences, undefined roads, and wagon tracks are shown. For the representation of railroads, canals, iron bridges, bold faces of rook, mid.river drift, water-worn rocks, and distribution of mixed woods over close hill curves, the vicinity of Harper's Ferry is given. Here is illustrated tbe strengthening of the 100-feet hill curves for the more ready reading of the heights of hills. For the representation of heavy oak timber, reclaimed marsh and orchards, a part of the New Jersey shore of the Delaware River is given. For the representation of rice, and the dikes and ditches incident to its cultivation, a selec tion from Santee River is given. For the representation of eroded drift banks with bowlders set free, and scrub deciduous woods, the western part of Martha's Vineyard, including Gay Head, is given. For the representation of the rocky shores and intermediate sand and shingle beaches, beaches above high water, and eroded earth banks, characteristic of the coast of New England, roads, fences, residences, outhouses, shade-trees on the lines of roads, and the shading of low hills by normals, the extreme end of Nahant is given. For the representation of a sandy beach, with low dunes, fresh-water ponds, meadow grass, sage-brush, fresh marsh, and eroded gullies (arroyas), a selection from the vicinity of San J.iais Obispo was made · . Samples not yet engraved have also been drawn for various characters of eroded and fract· nred granite rocks, as shown at Mount Desert Island; hard, eruptive rocks, as shown at Cape Disappointment, Oregon, and e.rocled sedimentary forms at Arlington, Va.. Respectfully, &c., E. HERGESHEIMER,

DAVIDSON and .J. .T.

-''-"'"'i"'tantf-'.

At a point near the United States Coast and Gernletic Survey station " Southeast Yolo lmse,"
I observed the II contact of .Mercury at the transit of that plauet m·er the snu's disk on the 7th of N ornrn ber, 1881. I used a 3-inch Frannhofor telescope known as the "Hassler E·1uatnrial" lwlongiug to tlie Snn·es, and mean time pocket chrouonwter Widt>nham noo. The eye-piece '"as direct, aud had a jiower of 105 diameters. The geographical position of the poi11t of ohsen·ation dedtict·d from measures to the Yolo ba8e

station is Latitude: 330 31' 33 11 .8 nortlJ. Longitude: 121° 47' 5() 11 .9 west of GreenwiclJ. The chronometer was slow of local mean time at ingress 9m 52·.7. HaYing no position circle I was not looking at the right place on the snn's limb at the time of I contact, awl when I first saw the plaul't it had e11tered quite perceptibly on tlie sun. The atmosphere was morlnately stem]~-, and there were nndnlations ot tlie limbs of :l\lereur.r and the sun, \rhich gaYe a certain oyerlapping of bor1lers snch as might be considered a "ligament." :Never· theless this llii;;tnrhance was not great enough to pren~nt a good obsen·atiou being made, and l

vVhen the planet was one diameter 011 the snn's disk by estimation I noted the time, by the chro110111·:te.r 2h 03m '..W8 · The planet presented an inte11sl·ly black 1lisk, which in its rrgnlarity arnl color was in markell contrast with the l"olar spots near which it passe(l, and which would tlicmseln>s lw called qnite n·gnlar in form and lhtrk in color. There was no white spot 011 the plauet, and no annulus of bright light around its disk, nor any indication of dii;;tortiou. The obseIT<ttions for the error of the chronometer were ma1lc with a Ga,mbcy sextant and artificial horizon hy l\Ir. c. B. mn, attached to the main triangnlation party. ,J. .T.

Tile observations for the error of the watch were made by .Messrs. Gilbert and Hill, using a Gamlwy sextant and artificial horizon. Remarks.-Tlie sk.r was clear arnl wPatlJer quite warm, bnt a very strong north wind was hlowi11g onw the plains through the Sacra meuto Yallcy, so that t lie obscf\'ers bad to seek sheltered places for the telescopes. ~o extra preptiration was made for the obsen·atious, because the rPgnlar work of the measuremeut of the Yolo base line of 11 miles' length was iu progress. The elerntion of the stations is about 75 or 80 feet above the sea le,·eI; the plains extend for 60 miles to the east, indetiuitel.r to the north and sonth, and 12 miles to the west, to the Berrj·essa range of coast mountains, reaching 3,300 feet elevation at Berryessa Peak. At the first station the sun's disk at the time of ingress was not sharp and well defined, but somewhat blurred, and the unsteadiness ga,-e to the phenomenon of first internal contact the freqne11tly reported appearance of distortion of the plal!et's limb next to the sun's limb, known by a variety of names such as the "black ligament," ''black drop," &c., bat never coming t-0 the black drop depicted in many pre>ions reports. But at the second station this appearance did not present itself, whilst tlie closenes.~ of the two obsen·ed times indicated little disturbance in reality. The phenomenon of tl1is ntmos1Jlicric disturbance is familfrir to Mr. Gilbert and myself from many ;nm rs' observing during the day-time on signals of the Goedctic Survey. The intense blaclrness of the planet's disk and its regular form satisfied us b0th that a body of one.fourth of the diameter of Mercury, such as the problematical planet Vulcan, could be readily distinguished with the same telescopic means that we used, whilst its progress across the sun's ilisk, and its contrast with contiguous solar spots would effectually prevent any mistake by an experienced obsener. The observations tor time and their reduction were made by Mr. Hill, to whom I am also indebted for the reduction of the gcograpllical positions from the base line. Hespcctfull.r submitted.

observatory, \Vaslliugtou, D. U., is lwN~with respectfully submitte11. The place of observation is tlw same as that oNmpie<l b,\· me when ohsen·ing the Tra11;;it of Mercury May G, 1878, namely, opposite the south west cor1wr of the lower Ca pi to! park,* h.r nwasurP 8".7 south and 9".± west of the center of the douu\ of tile Capitol,+ or iu latitude 3S0 ii:\ 1 14".G :111<1 in longitude 770 00' 43".!J, or 5 11 08 111 02".U, which is U·.l ea,,;t of the dome of the Fnited Statp;; Naval Observatory. Through the kirnlnes8 of Mr. I·'auth J ha<l the use of his new equatorial (for which he w;ts awartle<l a gold medal at Uie late Oinciunati Exposition) ; it is dri\'Cll by clockwork, l1as an aper tnre' of 15.25 ccntimet,ers (G iuche8), a focal leugth of :!.5 meters (S.2 feet), an1l was used with a magnifying power of 102 for the morniHg ob8en·atiou, arnl with a power of 127 for tlrn aftemoo11 observations. Full aperture wa~ used in connediou witl1 a solar eye-piece, the prism of which 4Jetleeted so much of tlrn sun's beat arnl light that a light shatle-glass sufficed for the protection of the eye. I was assisted by Dr, J. G. Porter, computer in the Snrrny Office, who took charge of the chronometer (mean time chronometer, Bond & Sons, No. 177), uoting down the time a1ul remarks made hy the observer. In the morning the southeastern sky was covere1l with dense cirrn stratus cl om ls; it wa,,; therefore fortunate that it fine focal adjustment of tlte telescope ha4l been obtai11e1l the uight before ou Saturn, which focus had been preserved. First external contact.- Very ligb t yellow shade-glass o\·er tile eye-piece. No 1listi net vision of the sun could be had until about two or three minutes after the pretlictetl time of the contact. 'l'he eye was kept steadily at the spot where tlte planet was to appear, but the limb of the sun could only be seen faintly by glimpses and by slightly \'ibrating the telescope. h. m. s. Record: At 8 54 15 (hy chronometer) limb barely visible. 8 56 4 7 notch seen. The sun was then rising above the denser cloud bank and the seeing continuall.r i111pron·11. This observation is of no value. Changed color of shade.glass to a light neutral tint. Pirst internal contact.-It was seeu through thin clouds, the image of the outlines of sun and lllauet in a state of slow undulation and devoid of 8liarpuess, yet tlte observation appeared to the observer quite satisfactory considering the entire absence of any distorsion of figure or other <lis. turbiug phenomenon; in fact the appearance was that of a geometrical contact. h. m. s. Reeord: At 0 13 0 (b,y chronometer); sun's image boiling, no shai·p outline to Venus. 0 13 58 cusps nearly together. 9 14 50 first momentary closing of line of light. 9 15 04.5 apparent permanent eouuection.

The hoiliug motion of the image was, howe\·er, much more ritpid than in the morning, yet the extent of the w:we motion or tremor was very much less.

Just before tltis time the couuectiug streak appeared like a collection of pate11e8 of light.

The last contact.-Tbe sky being clear or nearly dear, the ouI.r difficult.r iu observing this external contact was occasioned by the strong boiling motion of the sun's li111 b. Tlie observer, keeping bis eye steadily at the slowly diminishing notcll, noted two phenomena, viz:

The first time is that when tlle notch began to be obliterated by passiug waves aud the last contact had apparently not yet occurred; the second time is that when the passing wave11 last failed to briug out a notch, and the last contact apparently had then taken place. I should think true external contact took place about that rnoment, or at 2h 57m 4 7· + 1m 30·.5, or laist contact a.t 2h 5!Jui 18· United States NaYal Observatory mea.n time.

w ASIIINGTON, D. c., December 7, 188'.!. SIR: By in\'itation of Assistant C. A. 8chott, nrnler whose direeti~rn suitable teleseope8 had been proYided :wd placed in the yard of Fauth & Co.'s shop, at the sontlwast comer of First and H 8treets southwest, I repaired to that place in due season 011 the Gth <lay of December, 181'\'.!. From a number of tPleseopes that I found there I selected one of :small size, 11ot a:s being- so powerful as the larger ones that were availahle, but principally becau:se, while gi,·ing- a m0<lerall·ly fair chance for good results, it had the ad\·autage of having· a tiuder attachetl to it. This filult·r having a small magnif~·iug power (about 10 diameters) was of service, in that while the thin clouds continued to pass the sun's disk and ol>scure it entirely about the time of first contact, I could rapidly scan any part that chanced to be showing for a moment. By meaus of this finder I think I obtained amongst the earlie8t views of the llegiuniug of the Transit. For a tew minutes after sumise ou this occasion the suu's disk was beautifully clear a1Hl distinct, uot a clou1l was near it, autl to the casual ohserrnr uothiug would h~we been a1ipareutly more certaiu than complete success, but :soon a long·, low, narrow, black cloud forwell, about 150 above tbe horizon au!l to the southward of the sun. This cloud gradually moved to the nortliwanl, spreading out to greater width, and at last totallJ· ob~curiug tlie sun. This state of affairs co11tinued until about fifteen minutes before first coutact, when not only frollJ the suu's iucreasetl height, hut also because the cloud began to break up aud disperse, we uegau to get oeeasioual glimpses of parts of the face and circumference of the suu, matters were gradually improving i11 this way at the time of first contact, at which time I could make out the circumference of the i,mu through thin clouds, usiug the finder without any colorel~ glasses; theu the clouds got a little thinner, and these were the circumstances under which I first saw Yeuus after she had slightly advanced on the sun's disk, using the finder and no colored glasses, as heretofore stated.

LEHMAN'S RANCH, NEVADA, December 7, 1882. SIR: I beg leave to present the following report on the observations of the contacts at egress made at A. S. Lehman's ranch, in NerHla: The geographical position of the station occupied was derived from a small triangnlation executed for the purpose of connecting the State boundary of Nevada and Utah with Jeff Da,·is Peak, a principal station of the geodetic survey of the thirty-ninth parallel of latitude, and the position of which depends upon the Coast Surrny telegraphic longitude of San Francisco aud Ht'veral of 1 he astronomical azimuths and latitudes observed in connection with the geodetic isnrvey referred to The geodetic positions of Jeff. Da,·is Peak and the Transit of Venus station as resulting from the field computations are as follows:

Longitude.

These may be regarded as reliable to within about 1" in latitude and 2 11 in longitude. Whatever corrections the final adjustment of the triangulation may yield for the position of Jeff. Davis Peak will apply in like manner to the position of the Transit of Venus station. The altitude of the latter station above sea-level is 1900 meters nearly. The contacts were observed with a Steinheil refracting telescope of 5g inches objective, using the fnll aperture, and a magnifying power of 250 diameters. The excessive glare of the sun's light was screened down to proper intensity by a small piece of" London-smoke" glass attached to the ese-piece. The focal adjustment of the telescope was made with precision by pointings upon the larger planets at night, and again, finally, by pointiugs upon Venus itself on the day of the Transit. The <lefinition of the telescope thus focused was very satisfactory, notwithstanding the beating of the Pye-piece hy continued pointing upon the sun. The telescopt>, although equatorially mounted, was wit11ont a driving apparatus. It was kept properl,Y pointed by means of the slow-motion mm·ement worked by band. On the morning of the 6th of December the sky was generally clear, yet there bung threat· eni11~ storm clo111ls upon the eastern horizon, shutting away from view the sun, and which on that ac<'onnt was nPYer seen until the planet had shifted fully a diameter upon his disk. The atmosphPrfl. at tlii~ time seemerl much disturbed and undulated strongly. Fortunately, as the day a<h:rnct~d matters changed greatly for the better, and by noon, as tl1e great event of the day wa.s rapidly drawing near, all clouds liad vanished, leaving nothing !Jut a thin sheet of haze in the southern iskies, not dense enough to impair the distinct vision of the 1mn. A.t 17h mm chronometer time, the final pointing of the telescope was made, and the progress of the Transit uninterruptedly v;atched until after occurrence of the third contact. There was now almost perfect calm, and as

The times, as i\bove noted, being in accoruauce with tlte face imlicationR of sidereal chronometer Dent 21J7, require conection for rrror and rate to reduce them to local sidereal time. From star transits, obserre<l with 30-inch meridian telescope, Coast SmTey No. 5, set up in the meridian of tlte equatorial, the error of thii.-; chro11ometer was found to lJe:

The probable uncertainties of these determinations <lo not exceed about one-tenth of a Hecoml.

Christensen, who notetl aull recorded the times in accordance with the face indications of the chronometer. As regards the "black drop" no such phenomenon as it has been pictured hy observers of former transits was seeu, nor even anything remotely resembling it. On the contrary, the i1111er contact seemed to come about in a geometrical sort of way without disturbance or surprise, but very slowly. It was surprising to me to find, on examining the record after everytlli11g was over, that the lapse of time be~ween the iwportant phases as noted amounted to only ahont seven seconds, for my impression was that the interval seemed much greater-three times a~ great. I believe the observation of the contracts to be trustworthy and entitled to confidence. 'fhey were made uu<ler circumstauces quite favorable, especially as regards state of the atmos]>ht·re.

likewise perhaps to t'be exceeding slowness with wLicli tlie contacts seemed to come along, it is probable that I was late rather than otherwise in judging the moments of contacts. :For these reasons it is my judgment, after mature reflection, that the means of the times of doubt and conta.ct as noted may be regarded as representing more nearly the times of true geometrical contacts than the single contact times as actually noted. In order to ascertain the error of the mean time chronometer 2404, usetl by Mr. Marr, of my part._y, the following comparisons with sid ..real chronometer Dent 2147 were made: h. m. s. h. m. s. December 6: Sidereal 18 01 21.0 = 1 14 59.25 mean time. (No. 2147) 22 56 11.0 = 6 08 58.75 (No. 2404). The errors of chronometer 2404 on local mean time were therefore respectivt'l~· + 17m 37·.2 and + 17ui 35·.0. Correcting Mr. Marr's obserrntions accordingly, his contact times expressed in local mean time reduce to the following, viz : h. m. s. IIId contact = 0 14 07.0 IVth contact = 0 34 21.9 Both times se\·eral seconds earlier than as obscrYcd by m~·self, presumably in consequence of the i uferior telt>scopic power used by him. Mr. Marr's own report will be found appended. It may be proper to state in conclusion that the Transit occurred whilst the party was still engaged in packing down camp outfit and instruments from Jeff. Davis Peak and in storing them at Lel1man's Ranch, and rhat the contact observations herein reported did not interfere with nor delay the regular work of the party nor cause extra expenses to the Survey. The observations were made in conformity with the printed instructions issued by the Transit of Veuns Oommission as nearly as the means at hand and existin.,\' circumstances permitted.

DETERMINATIONS OF GRAVITY AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOLAR ECLlPSE EXPEDITION, MAY, 1883, TO CAROLINE ISLAND, SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN.
A Report by E. D. PRESTON.

UNITED S'I'ATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, D. O., Aug1tSt 17, 1883.
DEAR Sm: I have the bouor to sul>mit you the following report of my observations in con·

nectiou with the United States Eclipse Expedition to Caroline !::;laud, and tho::;e made for the determination of gra\'ity at difforent points along the route. In obedience to your instructions I left ·washington February 28, and 111ailcd from New York 1\Iarch 2, arriving at Aspinwall the morning of the 11th. At noon of the 12tl1 we were at Pan· ama, and at 5 p. m. passage was taken on the steamship Bolivia for Callao, Peru, which place was reached on the 19th. Onr instruments were here transferred on board the Uuite<l State8 man-of-war Hart.ford, and on the evening of the 22d we set sail for Caroline Island. Bet.ween Oallao and the island some preliminary computations were made. .A list of stars suitable for time observations at either Flint faland or Uaroline Island was selected and their constants computed. l'airs of stars were also selected for latitude. On the morning of the 20th of .April (twenty-ninth day out from Callao) laud was sighted, and in the afternoon of the same day the landing of instruments was begun. On tb.e 23d the transit pier was finished aml the instrument in place; but on account of bad weather no observatious were made until the followiug eveuiug, the <la~· of the 24th being employed in erecting the pendulum staud and tents in which it stood. From April 24 to MaJ' 9 observing went on regularly when not interrupted by bad weathel'. Time was deter· mined as early in the evening and late in the morning as possible. The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey yard-penrlulum No. :~ was swung between the two time observations, and latitude was determined by the method of equal zenith distances. Gravity was determined on eight nights, six with the heavy end of the pendulum down and two with the same end up. In one of the experiments with heavy end down, however, uo time was obtained in the morning. Latitude was determined on five nights, with an average of ten pairs on each night. The morning of the eclipse (May G) was cloudy; in fact, it was raining heavily forty minutes before the time of first contact; but fortunately it cleared off very suddenly, giving us a remarkably steady atmosphere, and all four contacts were satisfactorily observed-the last three particularly so. 'J'he first was observed by three persons, my own observation falling between the other two; the second and third were only observed by myself, and tlte fourth was noted by three persons, Mr. Rockwell's observation and mine diftering but two-tenths of a second; the former was noted by" eye and ear" method, and the latter on the chronograph. Observing ended May 9 at 6 o'clock a. m., and at 5 p. m. everything was aboard the Hartford and we were under way for Honolulu. During the passage from Caroline Island to the Sand wicb Islands the chronograph sheets were read and the definitive chronometer conections were deduced by the application of the method of least squares. Apparent places of stars were also computed and most of the pairs worked up for

latitude.

Ou arrh'ing at the Sandwich Islands I receind instrnctions from yon to proceed to Ute island of Maui and to determine the force of gravit,'I· at the station occupied by ne Freycinet in 1819. We arrfred at Labaiua at 1 o'clock a. m., June 6. 'Ve discon~red the foundation walls of the old brick house located in De Frt>ycinet's skPtch, and nPar which his obsprnttorr was erpcted; thanks to the assistance of Mr. S. E. Bishop, attached to the Hawaiian Gon·rnment suney, and an old native, Kanaka, wlto hinrnelf !tad seen the experiments of mm matle. At Laliaina the peudnlum was swung seven nights with heavy e1Hl down and three !lights with heayy end up, besides one swing at a high temperature. Stars were obsern·d nwrni11g and eYeni11g as nt Caroline Island. Latitude was also determined by observations on thirty-fin~ pairs of stars, extending over eight nights, but not all the pairs were observed on auy one night, the total unmher of measures of the latitude being 114. 'Ve desired to fix the position of Lahaina well, because Professor Alexander, superintendent of the Go·ernment survey, iuformed us that he l1a<l 11ernr ha<l a latitude determined on Matti with the degree of precision attained by the modem method of equal zenith distances, and it is his intention to carry onr Lahaina latitude bnck to Oahu hy triangulation aud compare it with determinations there made by Captain Tupman, of tl1e British Trausit of Venus Expedition of 1874. I have no doubt but that this operation will show a deflection of the plumb line on Maui of at least 8 or 10 seconds. The Pacific Ocean is n~ry deep around the Sandwich Islands and the mountains rise 4,000 feet high immediately back of Lahaiua. Our obsen·ations occupied us until the 3.'3<l, when we sailed again for Honolulu, arriving at 2 o'clock Sunday morning, the 24th. Before sailing for Maui a place to swing bad been selected, and the pier having beeu erected during our absence no time was lost on our return, and everything was in readiness for the evening of the :!5tb. Here a slight change was made in the usual pro· gramme. Instead of swinging· the pendulum from 7 p. m. to 5 a. m., as was done at Caroline Island and at Mani, it was swung continuously from the beginning to the end. There were two reasons for thi8: Iu the first place, the occupation of the cellar of the Young Men's Christian A11sociation building gave us a place where the <lail.r variation of temperature was comparatively slight; and, secondl,Y, after arriving at Honolulu only one week remained in which to set up the apparatus, make the experiments, and repack again for shipment. No stars being obtained on the 25th, swinging was begun .June 26, after the time determination in the ernning, and continued dnring three consecutive days and nights. Forty-eight hours were given to heavy end down and twenty-four to heayJ· end up. Stars were obtained after the pendulum observations and each night during their progress. Each night after the time obserrntions, the instrument was turned over to Professor Alexander, who had expressed tile desire to make some observations of latitude himself while the iustrument was in Honolulu. Howernr, on account of ·clouds and rain on all of the three nights very few pairs could be obtained. We sailed from Honolulu on Monday, July 2, arriving in San Francisco the evening of the 0th. At this station we were rather unfortunate both in regard to weather and temperature. Swinging was begun Sunda,y evening, Jul;)· 15, and continued without interruption for four days and nights, with heavy end down, before being able to get stars again. The pendulum was then turned from forward to back and swung for twenty-four hours more, time being determined again at the end. From July 21st to 27th no stars could be obtained, and this time was employed in reading sheets and making duplicates of the Lahaina and Honolulu work. On the 27th swinging was again resumed, with heavy end up, and continued for twenty-four hours. Time was determined before and after. The temperature was not very satisfactory; but swinging only during the night could not be done, because it was scarcely ever possible to get stars in the evening and also the following morniug. This condition was realized only once duriug the experirnent,s. From July 29 reading sheets and making duplicates went on without interruption until August 101 when I left for Washington, arriving there on the 16th. The thermometers were compared at Caroline Island. '.rhey were again compared and the zero points of two of them determined on our arrival at Honolulu. This was again done at San Francisco. The barometer was compared before leaving Washington with a st;andard one, and again in San Francisco. In the Caroline Islands, and in Maui and Honolulu, I was most efficiently assisted by Ensign

Hccond of arc. Por tlte tabular declilmtion the natural 11m11ber of the secant thereof has been given, mainly to enable the observer to calculate with reasonable e!oseuess the tinws of passage of a slow-IDm·iug star at the side threads of the transit reticule. In the determination of the mean places of the :stars, it has been necessary to calculate the 1-~ight A.sceusion and the Declination from two or more Catalogues, to examine the different authorities for the proper motions, or to derive them from the tabulated positions; to compute the annual precession for the slow.moving stars; and thence to deri\·c the annual variations ill Hight Ascension a11d Declination. The number of clock or time i;tars is 1126, aml the number of circumpolar or azimuth ::;tars i::; lo~. There are very fow stars so small as the G-7 magnitudes, and all <'all be easil,y observed with the 30-inch portable transit instrument of the Survey. The magnitudes assigu<·d to the stars have beeu gfre11 a~)cording to the old method, but a hyphen has beeu interplaced instead of a period when the stal' is considered to be between two whole magnitudes. The right -hand page has been left partly blank for the insertion of memoranda, also to give space to the observer to note the altitude, or zenith-distance setting for the stars, the chronometer times of transits, &c. \Vith this working catalogue, and the table of the 8tar factors A, B, c,· for azimuth, inclination, and collimation, the obserrnr in the field, even without a knowledge of the error of his chronometer, will generally barn little trouble in placing hi8 transit instrument within one second of time, or less, of the plane of the meridian, in half an hour; and within one-quarter of a secoml of time, or less, of the meridian in one hour. By using the Davidson Transit aIHl Equal Altitude Instrument,t and the Table of Altitudes and Azimuths of Polaris,+ the transit instrument may readily be adjusted ''cry closely to the plane of the meridian before sunset. I ha,·e in preparation a list of double stars compiled solely to enable the ob:sernr to adjust and test the sidereal focus of hiti telescope. I have been better sati:>fied with this method than any other.

DETERMINATIONS OF GRAVITY AT ALLEGHENY, EBENSBURGH, AND YORK, PA., IN lt:l79 AND 1880.
By CHARLES S. PEIRCE, Assistant.

I.-GRAVITY AT THE ALLEGHENY OBSERVATORY.

The Allegheny Observatory is situated inLatitude 4-0° 27' 41".6 north, Longitude 5h 2om 2°.93 west of Greenwich. It stands 1,140 feet (=348 meters) aboYe the mean sea.level.· From a few yards in front of the observatory the descent is very Rharp into the valley of the Ohio, and as this bas been formed by erosion, it must be supposed to diminish the acceleration of gra,·ity, perhaps by the one hundred thousandth part. Unfortunately the necessary calculation, which a topographical sketch would enable us to perform at once, remains impossible for the present. The operations were comlucted nearly as <lescribed in my "Measurements of Gravity at Initial Stations." The Repsold reversible pendulum was oscillated in vacuo 011 the Geneva support, in the cellar of the observatory, the feet of the support· resting on iron bars laid upon other bars let into the great pier of the equatorial at one end and into a stone wall at the other. Measures of the length of the pendulum were commenced 1879, January 2; bnt owing to the llifficulty of maintaining a tolerably constant temperature in any part of the obseryatory that was otherwise suited for a comparing-room, no valuable results were obtained before January 18; and even after that date, it was found necessary to reject the work of several da;ys, owing to bad conditions. The first series of measures of length was completed February 1. Four swingings of the pendulum were made on February 6 a:nll 7 with hea>y end up, and two swi11gings on February Sand 9 with heavy end down. On February 10, the position of.the center of mass was determined and the knives were interchanged. Two days were then lost in trying to make the vacuum cham· ber stanch; after which two swingings were made wi~h heavy end down, February 13 and 14, and four with heavy end up February 15, 16, and 17. On February 18 and 20, the flexure of the apparatus was measured, and these measures were supplemented by others on March 4. From February 22 to March 2, the pendulum was measured. The thermometers were compared from 1878, December 19 to 31, and again 1879, March 3. The following table gives a synopsis of the results of the swingings, the period being corrected for the rate of the clock aud for arc of osciUation, and being reduced to 150 C. and to a pressure of one million absolute C. G. S. units. The approximate pressure in millimeters of mercury and the approximate tempPrature centigrade are also shown. It is unnecessary to say that the air-pump was never brought into action during any swinging. The agreement of the resulting periods is, as far as it goes, favorable to the plan of swinging in vacuo. It will be noticed that the osciJlations were continued down to a small amplitude, but there seems to have been 110 increased error upon this account. Following the synopsis will be found a table of the errors of the partial swingings formed by intermediate transits, as shown on pages 502-503. The errors given are differences from the following periods, deduced from the final results: Td (knife 1)=18 .0064527 Tu (knife 2)=1·.0066434 Td (knife 2)=1 .0064463 Tu (knife 1)=1 .0066370

The errors are multiplied by the square roots of the number of oscillations, and the products are shown to be constant in the mean. It is also noticeable that this co11sta11t bas the same value whichever end is up. Several obvious inferences might be made. ln particular, it will be seen that the error of the result depends only on the total number of oseillations, no matter how they may be separated by intervals of rest.

Time was observed by Mr. F. W. Very, Professor Langley's assistant, with the instruments of the observatory, a fine 8-inch transit and the sidereal clock (Frodsham 1358). The cltronometer, Negus 1589, was used for the pendulum observations; and this chronometer as well as two others (Hutton 202 and Bond 380) were compared upon the chronograph with the clock tltree times a day, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon and between 9 and 10 morning and evening. The corrections to the chronometer used were obtained by assuming tltat between certain daks certain time-pieces moved with absolute uniformity, the changes of rate being supposed to be sudden. This is the same method of reduction used in my previous work, and appears to me most consonant with observed facts in regard to the running of timepieces. The standards used were as follows:

These results have to be diminished by 2001'.4, because they are referred to the mean of the three lines 999mm.7, 999rum.8, 999mm,9 of the standard instead of to the meter. They have then to be increased by 2611'.1 in order to be referred to the meter adopted in my "Measurements of Gravity at Initial Stations." It follows that the length of tbe pendulum iu terms of the meter adopted in my previous work (which is uow kuown to be err01wous, but which is for the present adhered to, in order to avoid confusion) was Before the interchange of knives .. . . . . .. . .. . . . .. . . . .. . . .. . . .. . 1.0000853 After the interchange of knives.... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.0000732 The difference of the distances of the center of mass from the two knife-edges was found to be om.39303, to which the correction; +.00014, has to be applied.· The experiments to determine the flexure of the support have already been published in the Coast Survey Report for 1881, pp. 375-377. The mean of the measurements of two observers shows that the flexure at the middle of the knife-edge, under a horizontal force equal to the weight of the pendulum, was 3&<.8. ·we now proceed to calculate [T2 Rev.] and {T2 Inv.], as in the paper above referred to. Only, it is to be remarked that, in consequence of what is said on page 72 of that paper (page 271 of the Coast Survey Report for 1876), one-seventh of the viscosity effect has to be subtracted in order to eliminate the effect of the bells; that is to say, Td has to be diminished by 66x 10-; and Tu by 151x10-1· The values have to be separately calculated for the experiments made before and after the interchange of the knives.

II.-DE'1'ERMINATIO!i OP GRAVI'l'Y A'l' EBENSBURGH.

Ebensbnrgh is the chief (though not the principal) town of Cambria County, Pennsylvania, in the Allegheny Mountains. The observations were made in the house and grounds of Mrs. Frances s. McDonald, OD Centre street. The place is shown OD the county map by Beers (1867),

478

where the house has marked under it "J.M. McDonald." It is at the soutbeastcorner of the street next south from Highland street. The transit pier is 23t meters south of the northern boundary and 28:\ meters east of the western boundary of the lot. The pendulum was observed in the cellar of the house. The latitude of the station, +400 27', was determined by Mr. Marcus Baker by sextant observations upon the Sun, Jupiter, and Polaris. The longitude was determined by telegraphic exchanges with the Allegheny Observatory, tbe observers being Mr. F. W. Very and Mr. H. Farquhar with the result: h. m. ,y, Ebensburgh east of Allegheny, 0 5 9.2 Ebensburgh west of Greenwich, 5 14 53.7 The elevation of the station has been ascertained from that of the railway at the station, as communicated by the engineer of the Pennsylvania Railway. The pemlulum station was connected with the railway by a line of len·ls. The elevation so found is 2,137 feet ( =651 meti'rs). It was i11tended to conduct the operations a.-; at .Allegheny; but various difficulties compelled me to support the pendulum on the Repsold tripod, as at my European stations. The brass footrests were placed directly upon the bard clay floor of the cellar. The old knives which had been used in Europe and in the stations at Hoboken and at Allegheny were replaced by new ones, made by Messrs. Darling, Brown, and Sharpe, of Provilfonce. The amplitude of oscillation was measured 011 a fine arc b~' Messrs. Stackpole & Brothers, wbich is divided into thousandths of the radius. The arc and transits were observed with a rm1ding telescope carryiug an objective corrected for use at a short distance by Byrue, of :N"ew York. The same eye-piece was constantly usetl. The telescope was placed at a distance of two meters from the pendulum; and no screen was interposed between them. The general order of the pendulum experiments was as follows:

corrections for flexure of the support, difference of knives, and injury to the pendulum. These I proceed to explain : After half the swingings had been made, the pendulum was measured. In adjusting the microscopes a pluml>-line was used; and to attach this it was necessary to remove the two forward nuts which bind the head of the support to the legs of the tripod. These were afterward replaced for the.rest of the swingings, but instead of being tightened by a wrench they were only tightened by band. This negligence was only discovered after all the swingings were completed, and it was then too late to repeat them. Elaborate experiments (see Coast Survey Report for 1881, Appendix 14) were accordingly instit11ted to determine the flexure of the support when the nuts in question were hand-tightened and when they were wrenched. The values given on page 388 of the Report have been used in the reductions, and the periodR have accordingly received the following corrections:
Heavy end down. Heavy end up.

The knives used at Ebensburgh an<l York, which are marked 3-4 and 7-8, have, at my request, been micrometrically examined by Assistant Edwin Smith, to determine the distance of the edges from the plane of the bearings. He obtained the following results: Knife 3-4. At end marked 3 1 122 . At end marked 4, 125". Knife 7-8. At end marked 7, 168. At end marked 81 170. On September 11 the record notes that a small spring belonging to the attachment of the kuife at the light end of the pendulum W:its found to be broken. In consequeuce of this the pendulum must have lost mass, and the center of mass should have been removed toward the heavy end. In examining the measures of the position of the center of mass, we find that at York, the station occupied after Ebensburgh, the center of mass was distant om.30333 from the knife-edge at the heavy end. In fact, using an empirical correction for the relative position of the knives, the individual results (16 in number) show a probable error of ± .000013. At El,lensburgh, measures were made on September 6 and September 16. The four individual measures on September 16, with the correction for position of knives, give for h.,

m.
0.30330
0.30332 0.30330 0.30339

Rejecting the last observation, in which there seems to have been an erroneous reading 1 the others give om,30331, not differing sensibly from the v~lue at York. The measures of the 6th give

m.
0.30324 0.30330 0.30327.
~.30328

These show a value sensibly smaller than that of the 16th. The difference is such as would be produced by the loss of something less than a gramme at the heavy end. The distance between the knife-edges not having changed, no other chauges can affect the result from the pendulumconsidered as reversible-although the accident, whatever it was, must spoil the agreement of the different days. .Although it does not affect the final result, I have, in the calculation, supposed that a gramme was lost at the heavy end, 2 centimeters beyond the knife-edge. The result of placing a small mass, m, on the pendulum at a distance of x meters and z.+ x meters from the two knifeedges is easily found to be to increase the periods of oscillation by

The period for September 8, with heavy end up, is obviously affected by an abnormal error. The Paris, Berlin, Kew, Hoboken observations show that the probable error of a period from a single swinging with heavy end up is ±0·.000006. The period for September 8 differs from the mean of the others by 0-.000077, having thus an error about thirteen times the probable error, an event which would occur by chance only once in a million x million x million times. We may, therefore, safely say that on that day there was some extraordinary force tending to restore the pendulum to the vertical. The records of obsr,rvations of arc show the following times of decrement on different days:

It thus appears that on the 8th there was some extraordinary force tending to bring the pen· dulum to rest. These facts suggest that a spider's line might on that day have connected the pendulum with the staud, and this supposition is somewhat strengthened by finding that on .t?at day the operations commenced with oscillating the pendulum with heavy end up in the position in which it had been left the night before. On the 15th and 17th, also, the arc descended rapidly, the periods are very short, ancl the pendulum had been left over night with the heavy end .up ~y for the oscillations which were begun in this position in the morning. If there were spider lines on these mornings, we should expect the disturbing influence to decrease as the aro descend~· Whether this is so in regard to the effect on the decrement on the 8th it is diftlenlt to say, bot it certainly is so on the 15th and 17th.

These numbers certainly confirm the hypothesis of spider-lines; and I shall consequently eutirely re;ject the work with heavy end up on September 8 and the first intervals on September 15 aud 17. 'Vith these rejections the mean periods for pairs of days in which the circumstances were the same, except the time of beginning (for 011 alternate days the position of the pendulum at the first swinging alternated), are as follows:

The time observations at Ebensburg were made with transit No. i'i carrying a rt>t.icule dh·ided The equatorial intervals of the five middle wires are seusibly equal to ~ 8 .583. The pivot iuequality was determined by l\Ir. Marcus Baker to he +0''.030 with illumination west. Both lamps were in place during the whole of the obsenations, which were made by Mr. Henry Farquha.r. The reductions were made by least squares, using Mr. Scbott's weights of 1872. Separate azimuths were assumed for the two positions. The chronograph was a fillet-reed instrument, by Breguet. The battery consisted of two sulphate of copper gravity cells. Chronometer Negus 1589 was always used for the star and pendulum observations, as this was undoubtedly our best chronometer. Chronometers Frodsham 2490, Hutton !W2, and Bond 380, were compared with Negus twice da.ily. The two former break every second omitting the 0; the two latter break every even 8econd, and also at 59 8 · Frodsham and Bond were wound at 8.80 a. rn.; Negus aud Hutton at 8.30 p. rn. at first., afterward at 9 p. m. until September 23, and after that at {j p. m. Ob1·onometers Negus, Frodsham, and Bond were in their exterrrnl cases. All four rested firmly on sand heaped on the cellar floor about 15 cm. from an inner foundation wall and 30 cm. from one another. They were placed in this order: Negus, Hutton, Frodsltam, Bond. The boxes of Hutton, Frodsham, and Bond were never opened except to wind them. The daily range of temperature in the cellar averaged less than 5 oc. The chronometers were compared with the clock of the Allegheny Observatory twice daily. The measureruentB of length before the firnt interchange of knives were as follows:

m.-DETERMINATION OP GRAVITY AT YORK.

York, Pa., is situated east of the Alleghanies in a comparatively plain country. The pendulum was oscillated in the cellar of the factory of Mr. A. B. Farquhar, near the railway station, on Duke street. The transit was about a hundred yards to the east of the factory, on land belongiug to Messrs. Billmeyer and. Small, in Gay alley. The co.ordinates of the station are: Latitude, 39° 58' north. Longitude, 5h 05m 54· west of Greenwich. Elevation, 122 meters (373 feet). The work at this station was conducted by Mr. Henry Farquhar, under my supervision. The pendulum observations were partly made according to a method of eye.and-ear coincidences invented by Mr. Farquhar. For the purpose of studying the effects of flexure, the Repsold reversible pendulum was oscillated on various supports, viz: 1st, on the Repsold tripod; 2d, on a solid support formed by bolting the head of the Repsold tripod to an oaken plank 2 inches thick; 3d, on the Geneva support and tripod, with the bells off and with the bells on (this to ascertain the effect of the belJs); 4th, on the Repsold tripod mounted on a wooden support; 5th, on the Repsold tripod resting on pieces of India rubber. Experiments were also made at this station upon the effect of substituting rollers for the knives as the bearings of the pendulum. The rollers were steel cylinders of 5mm diameter, backed by steel planes. They were well constructed by Messrs. Darling. Brown, and Sharpe. The utmost pains were taken (here as well as in later experiments in Baltimore) to avoid the inclusion of dust between the roller and its support. Nevertheless the decrement of the amplitude was very rapid for arcs above .035 of the radius on each side of the vertical; and the periods show enormous variations. The experiments on the effect of the bells of the Geneva support are also of interest, though they fail to give a very accurate evaluation of this constant. The summary of the periods of oscillation at this station (except upon the Geneva support) has already been published in the Ooast SurrJey Report for 1881, pages 423-424. This summary is here repeated, with the difference that the flexure corrections are now applied, that some errors of computation a.re corrected,· and that the experiments relating to the effect of the bells are added.

It will be seen that the method of eye and ear coincidences is greatly inferior in accuracy, the eigltt observations taken in this way on the Repsold support being less valuable than the four by transits; and there can be little doubt that the means would be brought nearer to the truth by rejecting all the observations by these coincidences. We shall accordingly allow observations with this method only one-fourth weight. With these weights, the above periods become-

s. 1.006435 1.006485 From these numbers it would seem that the effect of the bells may be a little larger than was cal· culated; but the error, if any, can hardly be sensible when the receiver is pumped out. The time observations were made with the same transit instrument used at Hoboken and at Ebensburgh. The eye-piece not being quite steady, the variations of collimation were considerable, and the instrument could not be kept free from dust. Time was kept by the four chronometers: Negus 1589 Frodsham 2490 Hutton 202 Bond 380 They seem to have required cleaning, aud show large diurnal variations. An attempt was made in the computations to take account of these, but not successfully. The measurement of the pendulum on March 3 showedPendulum-standard= +26.1'9 On May 7 and 8 three sets were taken with heavy end up, on which account 1. 0 has to be added to the results.

These figures are uncorrected for the difference of thermometers on the pendulum and standard, because such correction would make the accordance of the measures much less good. We must assume the excess of length of the pendulum in the first position t-0 have been +26~.1, and for the mean of the two positions +27".3. Since the standard is +26V<.1 longer at 150 C. than the assumed meter, it follows that the length of the pendulum in terms of that meter (now known to be false) was

on account of the error of the standard. (See ".Measurements of Gravity at Initial Stations.") The following is the calculation of the lengtl1 of the seconds' prudnlum at York:
