Tl~asltingtrm,

December 14, 1SS9.

Sm: As required by law and. by the regulations of the Treasury Department, I ha Ye the honor to submit herewith a report of tlie progress and state of the work of the Coast and Ge0tletic Surve;v during the fiscal ~·ear ended .June 30, 188!!, with a view to the same lwiug· laid before th(· President and the Congress. Having recefred from the Preside11 ton the 9th of J u1,r, 1889, the appointment as Superiuternlent of the Coast and Geolletic Surny, and lrn·ing immetliately thereafter entered upon the actiYt· duties of tlie position, I am able, at tlrn date of presenting this report, to express my belief, hasell upon close ohsen·ation of the 01:.erations of the Office antl upon persona.I inspection of parties in tlie field, that the survey, as a working orga,nization, has reached a high degree of efficiency. It will be my effort to maintain its l.tigh standard, and to advance its operations in tLe directions pointed out by the increasing magnitude of the maritime and commercial interests involnd, and b~- the just clemands of geographical science. The two maps of general progress (No8. 1and2) which aooompaus this n'port sl1ow grnpl;ically tbe areas covered by the se>era1 classes of work upon the .A.thmtic and Pacific coasts, and in the interior at the close of the last fiscal year. The general chart of Alask<1 (progress sketcl1, No. 13) is based upon the results of the latest surveys. In .Appendix No. 1 is gi\·en in tabular form, a!Hl in a geographical order, southward along the Atlautic coast, nortl1ward along the Pacific, and from east to west in the interior, a statement of tlle distribution of the parties asl10re :md afloat, tlte kind of work and the localities where prosecuted. Part I of the report presents a brief summary of general stateme11ts of progreo;s nrnler the he:Hls -0f Field Work (including Special Operations), Of'Uce 'York, Discoveries and Denlopments, Bulletius, and Special Scientific Work, concluding ''ith an explanation of estimates for the fiscal ~·ear 18!H, and a statement of those estimates in detail. Part II begins with an introductory statement relatiug mainly to tlie offices of the Assistant in cliarge of Office and tltc H;nlrograpl1ic Inspector, followed by allstractsfrom the reports of field-work made b;y cl1iefs of parties, arranged in tlte geographical order intlicate!l in Appendix No. 1. K otices of special operations, an abstract of the report of Office work and of the work of ti.JP Sub-offices at Philadelphia and San Francisco follow. A statement hy the Superiutendent concludes this part of the report. Part III contains the appendices to tlte report. AppendieeR :Xo,.,, 1 to 5, inclusi>e, gi1e the distribution of field parties, the statistics of the field and office work of the Snr>ey, list:o; of i11for1mition furnished in response to official calls and to indi>idnals upoll application, and the annual reports of the Assistant in charge of the Office an<l tlrn Hydrogravl1ic luspedor. Tlte remainiugappendices present results of tlw work or tlPscriptions of its methods and processes, such as are iH frequent requests from surveyors and engineers, geograpLers and naYigators.

PART I.
Dnriug the past fiscal year, field operations comprising triang11lation and topograph~~, astro. uomical and nrngnetic aud gravity work, and spirit-leveling of precision, were carried on within the limits or ou the coasts of twenty-six States, six Territories, and in the District of Columbia. Hydrographic s1ir,·eys, including in-shore and off-shore soundings, observations of tide;;, of currents aud of ice movements, and researches in physical hydrog-raphy relating to harbors and bars, were prosecuted in tile waters or off the coasts of fifteen States aud two Territories. Geodetic operations m co-operation with State geological or topographical surveys were carried on in the States of }lassachusetts, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Arkansas, Vvisconsin, and :Minnesota. lu compliance with a provision in the Sundry Civil Expenses act of 1\'Iarch 2, 1889, two parties in command of oillcers of the Sun·ey left Sau Francisco in June last for Ala~ka, charged with making the obscn·ations arnl measurements needed to determine provisionally the boundar,y line bttween _,\laska and British Uolum bia. A joint resolution of the Congress having authorized the President to appoint a delegate, who should be an offic~r of the Stir\Tey, to represent the United States at the meeting this year of the International Geodetic Association at Paris, action was taken aceordingly hy the President on the 28th of February, and the officer so designated bas attended the meeting. It will IJe seen by his report, whicl! will be published as Appendix No. 18, to this .-olume, that tlle Yiews which he wais instructed to present to the Association were not without a marked iniiuence upon its proceedings. By direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and on the request of the Secretary of the Navy, ofti!wr,,; of the Survey were detailed to co-operate with tl!e Commission to select a site for a Navy Yan! on the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Coasts, and with the Commission appointed to exami1w the coasts north of the forty-second parallel in the State of Oregon, aIHl iu the Territories ol "\Va:<uington <tml Alaska, \vitb ii view of selecting a snitahle site for a Navy Yard. An exhibit was made by the Survey iu connection with exhibits by other Bureaus of the Treasury Department at the Cincinnati Exposition in the summer and autumn of 1888.

II.-OFFICE WORK.
In tlw office special effort was continued to present the resnlts of field work at the earliest date practicabh·, anti to rewler them accessible to the people and to the Go,·crnme11t in the form.:; llithert o found most usefttl. · The ::;teadil.\~ iucrea~;ing llPma111l for the publications of the Sun·ey is shown by the large increase from year to year i11 the number of copies ol' charts, Coast-Pilot Yolumes, Tide Tables, aml ~ otfoes to ,\Iariners, rrqniretl to meet the neells of commerce and na\-igation. There were issued during thP year fort.v-nine tl10nsallll three htuulretl and twelve copies of charts, an increase of seven thonsarnl copies oYer the number issuell in the ti;,-ieal year 1888, and of fourteen thousand two hun-

drcd au<l ninety-six copies over the number issued in tile fiscal year 1887. Of this nuruber twenty. eight thousand two hundred an<l twenty-four copies were sent to agents for sale; three thousand five huudreu and sixty-one cop\es were issueu to the Co11gress, and sixteen thousand three lnrnured aud sixty-four copies to the Executive Departmeuts. For foreig-u Go·eruments, seven hundred and forty-one copies were required. Fort.r-nine charts were published; thirteen of these were from eugra,·ed plates, arnl thirty. six from tracings or drawings reproduced lly plwtolithography. '!'here were published tweuty-two new editions of charts; of these eight were from engra"\ed plates, and fourteen were photolithographed. Great care was taken to haYe all charts issued from the office corrected to date for changes in lights, buoys, anc..l other aids to navigatiou. Tide Tables predicting for 1890 the times and heights of high and low water for all the principal })Orts on the Atlantic aud Pacitic Coasts of the United States were prepared and seut to press duriug tile year. The \'Ulurne for tile Atlantic coast was extended to include ports on the east coast of British America as far as tlle Strait;; of Belle Isle, and that for the Pacific coast to include ports in Ifritish Columbia. Full preclictions were also made for the principal ports in Alaska. The publication of a series of papers under the designation of Bulletins, begun duriug the prccediug fiscal _year, was continued. A further uotice of these papers, witL a list hy title and date of publication appears on page 10. Of the Annual Heports two thousand three hundred and uiuety-fin' copies were distrilmted. There were receiYed froru the Public Printer four thousand fh-e lrnndrell extra copies of A11pendices to the Amrnal Heports. The pltpers thus puulished tle:scribe the methodo or discus:; the l't'snlts of tht> Sun·1~y and am furnislwll without cost to avplicants.

A summarized statement of ollice work in charge of the H:ydrographic luspector precedes Part II of this report, aud an abstract of tlte report of the Assistaut in charge of the Office will be found towards the close or that l>art.

III.-DISCOVERIES AND DEVELOPMENTS.

The Notices to Mariners, the regular issue of which was at first quarterly: and siJ1ce ,T nly, 1S8i, monthly, have become au indispemmble supplement to the ch1rts. IYheurYer disco.-eril's or developments are made in the progTess of the work of enough importance to mariners to demaml immediate publication, special notices are issued. All COITPctio11s to cllarts, or cltauges 1mule in them during the montl1, are fnllJ, given in the monthly notices. TheRe changes or corrt'ctions may be due to changes in lights, buo_ys and heaeons or other aids to 11a\igation, to tlw de\Plopnwnt of new channels, or to changes caused b,Y works of construction. Or they may lle (ltll' to tliscoYeries of dangers made in the course of the close resnr"\eys of hays, liarhors! and highways of commerce which the interests of IJa"\igation now demand. Wide aud free distrilJntion is given to these Notices, and it is intended to suppl.'· copies of each issue to e\·er.r Collector of Customs in the United States, and to all l~nitt>d States Consuls in for. eign ports. In his annual report, the Hydrographic Inspector recommends that a weekly issue of the Notices be 11rovided for as soon as sat,isfactory arrangements for prompt priutiug can he cL fected. Thirteen Notices were issued during the .'·ear, and fifty thousand co11ies were printed. Following is au abstract of their contents and dates of issue: No. 104 (July 31, 1888).

The series of papers published under the head of Bulletins, the issue of which was begun to· wards tlle close of the fiscal year 1888, has fully answered the purpose for which it was intended; to gfre early announcement of work accomplished, or information of importance obtaiued, thus antieipating i11 many cases the usual means of publication afforded by the Annual Reporti;;. Se~·eral Bulletins were published daring the year, and the whole number of copies printed for distribution was twenty-three thousand. Copies are furnished without charge to applieants.

V.-SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC WORK.
Ol'i THE RELATION EXISTI:"-<G BETWEEN THE METRIC STANDARDS OF LENGTH OF THE U. S. COAST A.)ID GEODETIC ScRy:gy AND THE U. S. LAKE SURVEY.

The geodetic connection that has been made between the triangulation of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and that of the U.S. Lake Survey upon liues in the States of New York, Illinois, and Wisconsin, and the necessity of expressing the length of the lines determined by the Lake Surny in terms of a staudanl adopted by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, led Assistant Tittmann,

In the report made by thei;e officers (Appendix No. 6) they present an exhausfrn· discussion of tlrn relafrrn and absolute leugtlls of two primary standards, establishing with the utmost attainable accuracy the relation between the lengths of the Committee :\Ietre (iron) of 1799, the standard for the Coast aud Geodetic Surrny, and the Repsold 1\Ietre (;;teel) of 18i6, the standard for the Lake Snrvey. Occasion is taken also to determine the length of the Berlin l\Ietre No. 4!"1 (bra:>SJ of 18iG, which has been used as a standard iu graYity research. Full descriptiom· of the apparatus and processes employed for the comparisons accompany the report, with a drawing of tlie. optica1 beam compass comparator constructed after designs by the late ll. \V.

Sketches showing the deYices nsed to compare the Committee :Metre, which is an end measure, with the He11sold )Ietre, a line measure, appear also. Records of the comparisons are given iu full, and the report closes with a statement of the relation of the Uommittee ::\Ietre to the metre proYisionally adopted as a standard lly the Internatioual Standards Committee, and soon to be replaced by the National Metre Prototypes, for the reception of which arrangement:s are now lleing made by the Bnreau of \Y t>iglits and Measures.
'l'HE NEED OF A IrnMEASL'REMENT OF THE PERUVIAN ARC.

In Appeudix I\ o. 7, Assistant .E. D. Preston discusses tlie need of a remeasurement of th(· Peru\ian arc of the meridian measured by Bouguer and La Uondamiue in the years 1736 to li43. This paper was first presented by permission of tile Superintendent to the American Association for the Advancement of Science at their meeting in Toronto, August, 1889. l\Ir. Preston has examined with great care and thoroughness the methods of obsen-ation employed, the sources of errol' affecting them, the exteut to which tlie measures of that day were defectiV"e, and the value of the result obtained for the eartl1's ellipticity. He urges the aoxantages to geodesy of repeating this measurement in view of the great improvements in instruments, aud of the refinements in modern metliods of observation, which, if brought to bear upon a remeasurement of this equatorial arc, would gi\·e a result entering with much weight into a new determinatiou -0f tlie ratio between the equatorial and polar axes.

The line of spirit-levels rnn in 18711 between Annapolis and \Yashi11gto11 by A~si,;taut F. \\. Perkins was then intendet1 as a basis for determining tlrn heights of stations of the primary triangulation in the region about "\V ashingtou, but siuce tlie beginning i11 1871'1 of the transeonti ucnta 1 hue of precise leveling carried westward from the Atla11tic eoa,.;t aloug or 11ear the tliirty-11inth parallel, it has been found advantageous to incorporate t be Annapoli;;;-"~ ashington line as an independent link connecting tbe transcontinental liiw with the Atlantic, by way of Chesapeake Bay. It is therefore ou account of its importance as sucl1 a liuk, serving as a clwck upon tlit ('Oil,. nection of Washingtou with thu Atlantic hy way of Hageriitowu, Md., and SamI~- Hook, ~PW ,Jer. sey, tllat the report of results of the observations derirnd from their discussio11 b~- ARsistant Schott appears as an appendix (No. 15) to this Yolume. Reference to tide-water at A1111apolis has been obtained by two series of tidal obserYations, onP made in 1875, the otla'r i11 1888. Gpon the supposition that the fn-erage level of Uhesapealrn Ba;y at Annapolis is the same as that of the Atlantic, the height of the bench·mark on the Senate wing of the Capitol, as deduce1l from this line of leveling, is ninety feet and sixty-one hundredths of a foot, with a probable error of plus or minus eleven hundredths of a foot (90.61 feet± 0.11 f't>et). 'l'be distance to tide-water at Auna11olis is sixty-tnree kilometrtis, or about thirty-nin~ statnte miles.

.ANGELES T'RDIARY BASE·LlNE,

The need of a primary bas(o·line in Southern California of sufficirnt length anrl so located as to he well conneete<l "\\ith the main triangulation haYing been for some tim·~recognized, .Assistant D:with;on was instructed in 1886 to haYe a reconnaissance for a site made. Iu 1888, after an exhausth·e examination, a site was finally decidetl upou, partly in Los _.\.ngeles County and partly in tile new county of Orange, and in the winter of 1888-'89, the measurement was completed by Mr. Dm·idson aml the party under his direction. In Appendix Xo. 10 to this rnlume bis account of this work is published. Full details are giren respecting the location of·the line, the apparatus used aud methods of measurement adopted, the markings of the base stations aud of tlrn ends uf the base, the comparisons of the base bars with the stamiard, etc. Sketches accompanying show the profile of the line, the leading· topographical foatmes of the country i11 its Yicinity, and tlie connectjon of the base with the triangulation. The adYerse nature of tl1e ground and certain peculiarities of construction in the apparatus rendt>red it advisable to make three separate measurements of the line. Precision of movement aud rapidity of progress increased with each successive measurement, and it is believed that the third measurement exceeded iu accuracy the second, as the second (lid the first.
TELEGHAPlllC DETER'.IIIXATION OF 'l'HE LONGITUDB OF A STATION ON ;;IOUN'l' IIAl\ULTON, CALIFORNIA, NEAit TUE LICK onsERVA'l'ORY.

The northeast dome of the. IJick Obse1Tatory, on :Mount Hamilton, Califomia, ba¥ing been determined in geographic~1l position by observations from the snrronnding trigonometrical stations, and this mountain ha Ying been selected as one of the places where a comparison of astronomical aml geodetic positions woul<l he l1esirable, a, station was selected on tl1e mountain in the autumn of 1888 by the Director of the Obserrntory, and the longitude o: this station determined by exchanges of telegraphic signals witli the J~afayette Park Observatory, San Francisco. For the special use of the Surn·y, the position of the northeast dome was referred geodetically to the posi· tion of the temporar.v longitude station. · It will be noticed from the table of resulting differences of longitnlle (Appernlix No. 8 to this Yolnme) deduced by Assistant Scl1ott from the observations nrnrle by Assistant Sinclair and Suhassistant Marr, that, notwithstanding tl11~ time of 01er a month, due to nnfrworable weather, which it took to obtain elernn nights for tlie exclrnnge of longitn<le signals, the results for the separate nights are closely accordant, and that the iinal result is a Yer.\· satisfactor,y one. This is due in part to the care and skill of the observers, ancl in part to tlw improved transit instrurnc11ts whieL were designed and constructed at the Office of thP. Snn·ey fot· the special u,;e of the longitude parties. Assistant Smith has furnished a description of these instr11· me11t:s, which appears as Appendix No. 9.

lH8TRlBl'TION OF TIIE :Z.lAGNETIC DECLINATION IN THE ONlTED STATES FOR THE EPOCH

During the se\·en year<> which ham elapse<l since the publication by the Survey of the first collection of magnetic declinations, reduced to a common epoch and the results charted 1Appeurlix .X o. l~l, 1882), tl1c number of a,·ailahle stations has increased by nearly nine hundred, and rnueh progress lta:s been made in our k11owledgc of the secular variation. It has been possible therefore to increase gTeatly the precision of the magnetic charts for 1885, and to furnish new charts for the epodt 1S90, of superior accuracy ancl completeness. These charts a1>pear as i1lustral ions to Appendix: No. 11 to this rnlume., prepared by Assistant Schott. The labor required for l1ri11gi11g out the secon<l edition of this paper was Yery considerable, but the usefnlness of the charts will uot be irnpnired for several years to come by reason of cllange in the magnetic distri liuti<)]}.

In one of the charts illustrating the magnetic distribution there are shown in detail (it is supposed for the first time for the United States) the mrtguetic meridiaus or lines of force, that. is thP lines 'lvhich a traveler might be supposed to trace out by starting from a given point and following alV>ays the dir~ction of a magnetic needle held by him. By the results of these researche.s this office is enalJled. not only to assign the most trustworthy tlata for the charts of the Survey which require the impress of tlte compass showing the variatiou at sea, but at the same time to satisfy the large demand for maguetie information by sur,·eyors and others, a demanrl which has been steadn,· on the increase siucc the hibors of the Snn·e:r in this department of }lractical knowledge have become more widely known.

Surveys made at different periods between the years 1848 and 1888 on the coast of Cape Cod have afforded meaus for comparisons of changes due largely to the action of the sea upou that coast, and for a study of the laws of change. In these investigations Henry Mitchell, for many years au Assistant on the Suney, bore a leading pnrt, and tlley ha Ye been continued by hi:-< associate, Assistant lleur.r L. J\larindin. Tile physical history of Cape Uod was made the sul~jcct of two papen; by .:\Ir. :\litchelL wl.Jich were published. as Appendix !l to the Report for 1871 and Appendix 9 to the Report for 1873. ln Appendix No. 12 to this Yolnuw Mr. J\Iarin(lin, taki11g as a basis of comparison tile surveys of 1848, 1856, 1868, 1887, alHl 1888, shows the effect of tile wear of the sea upon tlie coast between Chatham an<l the Bighlam1 Light, awl deduces the amount of a\erage annual recession of tbe "hore line.

RESURVEY OF THE NEW l::\'LET INTO COTA}IY Bd.Y, :ITB.RTJIA'S VINEYARD.

In the Annual lteport for 1886, Appendix No. 9, was published an acconut of the changes itt the shore-line arnl beaches of ~fartha's \·i11eyanl, as derived from comparisons of recmir with formet sm·yey:s. This paper was prepare1l by Assistaut B1'nry I... \Vhiting with 8pecial refere11ce to the new opening throug·It Cotamy Beach, which occurred during a violent storm, accompanied b;r a ,·ery high tide, on the night of ,January fl-10, 1886. Tl!e conclusions drawn hy :'.\[r. ""biting respectiug tl1e probable eastward moYement of the new opening were based upon n compariso11 of surYeys made IJy himself in 18-16, 185{), 1871, and 1886. These conclusions havt> been veritirtl liy two later surveys, one by Assistant Vinal, in 1887, and the other b~· .'.\Ir. \Yhiting, in .June, 188\1. It appears from these later surve~·s that there has been in fact more change than was anticipated, although those changes that ha\'C taken place have llecn in accord with the predictions bas\'d npm1 a knowledge of former changes, and the laws which appear to goyern tlie uormal 11et of tli\' tidal currents aloug the south coast of .l\fartl.ia's Yineyanl, and to produce the pre,·ailiug- sea-dash. In Mr. Whiting's detailed report of the n·sults of the latest resurveys, published as Appendix No. 14 to this volume, he observes that it is reasonable to vredict that the easterly point of the inlet will mow~ easttVard past the 'Vasque Hills, leaving a long canal passage-way between an outer beach so formed aud the fast laud of Chappaquiddick; and that perhaps this Ioug pas-

sage-way will c>xtend to the easterly liue of Chappaquiddick, as it did before the closing of the former inlet in 1869. There is, however, more liability now than then of a new opening breaking through at points along the main beach, which is much lower than it has been for mauy years. At uo time in his experience since 18!6, Mr. \Yhiting states, bas the whole extent of beach across the face of Cotamy Ilay, a distance of about three and a half miles, presented so feeble a barrier against the ocean waves and breakers as it does nmr.

EXPLANATION OF ESTIMATES.
The estimates submitted to the Secre~ary of the Treasury for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1891, were accompanied by the following statement:
U. S.
COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, September 13, 1889. Sm: The estimates for the 17. S. Coast anc] Geodetic Survey, which I have the honor to submit, are in general the same in form and fact as those submitted for the past year or two. The estimates for the field work or party expenses are very slightly changed, tlte only thing to which l deem it necessary to call ~·our especial attention being under the paragraph ''for objects not narued,'' wl1ere, in justice to those officers of the field force whom it is necessary for me to order to V.' ashingtou for short periods for cousultation about the wm·k, I have insertL·d a paragraph to allow them, while so e111plo.yed, actual necessary expenses as directed by me, within the limits of the Treasury regulations. Crnler the bead of pay of field officers I find that the force is already reduced to within the limits required for the proper execution of the work, and I have inserted two additional salaries at ~;;,ooo per annum each, iu order to enable me to avail myself of the Rervices of experts not now con11ecte<l with the SurvPy and the benefit of whose labors would be felt immediately. hi tlie pay of the Office force 1 ha\-e asked for a priYate secretary and a stenographer to the ~uperintendent, help absolutely necessary for the proper and effective discharge of my own duties. I have also asked that a disbursing officer 11e provided for the Survey at an additional expense of $400 per annum. The delays necessttrily caused by our present means of disbursement are costl,v and vexatious. TLe general expenses of the Office are increaRed in these estimates over tliose for the present :fiscal :-.-ear, the increase being absolute!.)· 11ecm;sary in order to transact our increasing business. "C uder a separate heading l liave set forth the estimated cost of furnishing special additional facilities for our chart priutiug. The flemaml is uow, at certain seasons, so far in excess of our a hi lity to su1)ply, and is i11creasiug so steadil,y that I feel compelled to bring the matter to :your attention and ask its favorable consideration. Tlw office.room at our disposal is now entirely inadequate, and with the extension of onr priuti11g facilities more room will be necessary. The International Standards, which are soon to be delivered, must Jiaye some suitable place JffOYided for the:n, and the only place at our disposal is now filled with material for chart printing. Tbe estimate for new furniture and other outfitting will be a ln;;olutely necessary wheu tlle 1ieeded additioual room is provided, but only a portion of tliat amount wiU be uecessary if the additional room is not provided. The item for printing and hinrliug for the Coast and Geodetic Survey, work to be done by the Pnhlic J>rinter, I respectfnlly recommend to he appropriated separate and apart from the body of the appropriation for printing, etc., for the Treasury Department, in the same manner as a similar Hppropriation for the Geological Survey is set apart from the bod~· of the appropriation for the Interior Department; to the end tLat an appropriation such as this, upon which we rely for the puhlicatinn of tide tables, 11otices to mariners, coast pilots, aud other indispensable documents, may he more particularly under m.r charge and always available.

Jlr. B. A. Colonna bas continued on duty as Assistant in Charge of Office and Topography. In submitting bis annual report he refr·rs to the increased efficiency of the work in meeting the demands of the pnblic service; urges the necessity of' au increase in the force of computers, draughtsmen, engravers, printers, mecbanicians, laborers, and writers, to utilize fully and without delay the material accumulated for publication, and to meet the constantly increasiug calls from the public, and represents the need of additional room for the office force and for storage. A summarized statement of this report will be found towanls tlrn close of Part II. Lieut. Commander ,Y. H. Brownson, U. S.

Uomnrnuder U. }l. Thomas, U. S. N. Lieut. Uommander Brownson's thorough knowledge of all l>ranches of hydrography, and. his success in enlarging a.ml adapting the organization of his office to the increasing needs of thl:'. Sur-vey, made him a most valt1able officer, and upon his detachment called forth from the Supmiutendent a letter to the Secretary of' the }favy, expressing high appreciation of' bis ability, energy, and efficiencs. His annual report presents :t general summary of hydrographic operations for the year 011 the· A.tlantic al'l<l Paci tic coasts, states the condition of the vessels of the SnrYey, refers to the accom· panying reports of the Hydrogmpliic and Coast Pilot Divisions, and submits list of officers of the :Sa,·y attached to the Snrrny during· the fiseal year.

Cuntinuati-On of the triangulation of the St. Croix Rirer, and of the lakes near its head to1rnrrls the Northec1stern Bo'/i,ndary.-At tlie i.Jeginning of the fiscal year the party of Assistant C. Il. Boyd hatl been. in tlle field uear Calais, .Me., for about a month, having resumed tlle recouuais1.'ance and triangulation for connecting the primary work on the coast of l\laine with the :Xortheastern Boundary SnrYey. The signals which bad been left standing through the preceding winter haying been examined, a reconnitissanee made, lines of sigllt opened, the ground cleared and new signals erected, Mr. Boyd took up the triangulation at the line Oak Ilill-~eals, of the season of 1887, and pushed it forward until November 9, 188S, at which date he was occupying a statiou, Spruce :.\Iouutaiu, near the lower end of Grand Scl10odic Lake. Owing to the few roads through the forest and to the fact that the only crossing of thl' St. Croix is at the Calais bridges, access to the stations involved a great amount of tnwel for the party; tliis amount during June was estimated at six hundred miles, and proportionally in ot11er months. At the two stations last occupied, l\fonnt Ilenr,\· and Spruce l\fonutaiu, one hundred miles of travel were required to pass from one to the other, although their distance apart was bnt fifteen miles. The progress of work was delayed also by bad weather; rain, mist, or snow 1irevailed during the last three moutlls of the season. These mouths are usually the best of tlie .rear for obsei·rn. lions oYer long lines. Owing to the swarms of hlack flies, which appear in early summer in the woods of this regio11. but little profitable work can be done before the middle of July. In his annual report Mr. Boyd renews a suggestion which he had made in a letter to t' Superintendent dated July 15, with reference to the need of a tertiary triangulation which sh< determine ancl define the limits of the islands, ledges, and shore-lines of the boumlary lakes, being as yet no maps upon \\"hich the course of the boundary line over the lakes could be u Mr. R. H. Basard served as recorder with the party about half the season. He v obliged to leave on account of ill health. Mr. E. 0. Lyle joined the party as recorder i ber, and sen·ed acceptably till the close of field operations.

It is noted that in its general character the country is rocky, the most marked rock formation lieing the so-called red granite, which is reaJly a syenite, the red color being due to impurities in the constitueut feldspar. E\·idences of glacial action, l\Ir. BacLe observes, are readily traced, the scratches on tlie Lard compact rocks l1~n-ing apparently suffered hut litt1e obliteration since ihl'Y W('re made.

F. H. Crosby, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sun-ey, commanding the steamer Gedney, and carried on till the close of field operations in October. In July, 1888, this suney was resumed by Lieutenant Crosby, and continued by him until he was relieYed in the command of tile Gedney by Lieut. J. C\1. Helm, U.S. X., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sur.ey. Lieutenant Helm finislied the snn·ey of Oobscook J{a;y early in September, 1888. TI'"ith it.o completion the hydrographic survey of the coast of l\Iaine was brought to a close. The resnlr,; of the work are sho"l>n on tlirce hyclrographic sheets, and are plotteu on a scale of 1-10000. These sheets are accompanied hy descriptive reports. Cobscook Bay, Lieutenant Ilelm observes, is extremely irregular in shape, bas islands and ledges almost innumerable, awl bold rocky shores, quite tbickl;y settled, mostly b,y sea-faring men, who are competent pilots. Owing to the great number of rocks and ledges and the very strong currents, strangers should take pilots always. The soundi11gs are extremely irregular, shoaling and deepening so snddenl.' that the lead is not of service in navigation, except in the broad, clear portions of the Bar. Few, if any, vessels other than those owned in the vicinity frequent the Bay since the decline of the lumber interest. There are no lights, ranges, or beacon8, the only aids to navigation being sparbuoys. The tidal currents, as a rule, set fair with the deep-water channels, but strong eddies are formed by every prominent point, co,·e, rock, ledge, or island, so that in the crooked portions of the channels, the currents present a confused lot of swir(s. The currents are so strong that where the channel is narrow and turns suddenly, tbe current setting more to one bank tllan I lie other, the water is piled lJp, so that the difference is very perceptible to the eye. On pr~jecting points and submerged rocks and ledges, there are heavy overfalls which are dangerous to boats. Special mention of localities whi:re these overfalls are most dangerous is made by Lieutenant Helm in his descriptive report A. The officers attached to the party were Ensigns R. O. Bitler, Joseph Strauss, and D.S. Nes, U. S. N., and Nam! Cadet Philip Andrews. For the season, the following statistics are reported; Hydrography: Area surveyed in square statute miles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23 Number of miles (geographical) run while sounding...... . . · . . . . . . . . . . . 49i Number of angles measured ................ _....... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 84.3 Number of soundings ................................................ 3G, 8-!5 Number of tidal stations established ...... _. _................. . . . . . . l::!

Under instructions bearing date of "July 5, 1888, and supplementary instructions of a later date, he made a special exarniuatiou in the vicinity of Nash Hock, g·encrally known as Black Rock, to the southeast of Nash Island, coast of Maine. This examination occupied but two tlays and developed no features of special interest.

Tl.tis syphon-gauge has been described and figured in Bulletin No. 12. Tile results of the work are now in hand for final reduction and discussion; when completed they will be shown on three hydrographic sheets, each on a scale of 1-10000. On these will be indicated the position and number of cross-sections le>eled and sounded. These sheets will offer the best base sur>ey for future comparisons of the changes in the bluff-line, shore.line and tlle submerged contours out to six fathoms of depth, and when used in conjunction with the ele>ations of the permanent bench-marks established by the precise leveling, they will furnish data for accurate reference. Fields operations were closed October 27. Mr. Marindin expresses himself as specially indebted to llessrs. Haskell and Ritter for efficient service. The lines of precise levels were run entirely by these officers, one running the line in a uorthwanl and the other in a southward direction. For the season the statistics are:

Haskell and Ritter, re1iorted for duty at the Coast aud Geodetic Surrny Office. During the following winter and part of the spring Mr. Marindin was engaged with bis party in the reduction of observations made during the course of physical hydrographic surveys in New York Harbor and on Cape Cod. Towards the end of April he was instructed to make arrangements for resuming the Cape Cod survey at as early a elate in May as practicable. Belore leaving for the field, he submitted a report on the encroacliment of the sea upo11 the coast of Uape Cod, as shown by comparatirn sur>eys, with a sketch indicating changes in shore line between 1848 and 1SS8. This report is ptiblished as Appendix No. 12 to this volume. On the 20th of 11Iay the party was established in camp at High Head, near Provincetown, but owing to unusually stormy weather, which then prevailed, only a small amount of field-work could lw accomplished during the rest of the month. At the end of the fiscal year work was in active progress, the obsen·atious including the measurement of the coast, line in cross-section, beginning far enough inland to show tbe nature of the barrier to the sea and running out t-0 about thirty-six feet of depth, supplemented b:\· lines of le>eling of precision, tidal observations, and topographic ;;un·ers where the changes in the surface were most marked. Oare was taken to lei:we permanent lwncl1-marks connected by precise le>els, aud each cross-section was marked by lines of stakes 1 most of which can probably be identified after a lapse of years.

Continuation of the determ.i11atio11s of to1rn boundary lines in the State of Jlassadwsetts_Under instructions issued in )'fay, 1888, Assistar.t C. B. Yan Orden was directd to report to Assistant II. L. V\Thiting, and take the field to continue under his direction the work of deterrniniug points for the State SurYcys of l\lassachusctts. l\Ir. Whiting, as one of the Commissioners of the State Surwy, has incorporated in the Heport of the Commission for the year 1888, a statement of the progress made by Mr. Van Oruen in executing the triangulation in Barnstable and Plymouth Uounties, required for the determination of town boundaries. Owing to the generally low and le>el clrnracter of the grouud and the large areas -Of woodland, this bas probably been one of the most difficult sections of tbe State for trigonometrical work. The season was also unusually unfa,·orable; tbere were thirty-three rainy clays and much tbreatening weather. Two burricanes seriously injured eigbt of the large signals, from se-venty-tiYe to one hundred feet in length. These bad to be repaired at considerable expeuse and much loss of time. The area gone over in Mr. Van Orden's survey includes the townships of Sandwicb, ::\lash pee, Bourne, Falmouth, Plymouth, Kingston, Duxbury, and Marshfield, the boundaries of which ha Ye lJeen completed. Boundary points were determined in parts of the lines of Pembroke, Halifax, and Plympton, and the triangulation extends still further, over the towns of Carver, Hanson, and Hanover. Mr. Van Orden observes with regard to the conn tr~· east and north of Falmouth that it was of the most difficult nature, the line between Bourne and Pl,rmouth being in dense timber. The clearing required in order to see and determine various boundary points amounted in all to about two miles of timber cutting. In tbe course of the work, some of the old but important points of the Coast Survey, which ha>e for many years been supposed to be lost, were recovered, and marked permanently and securely with marble posts. Among these are the stations of Falmouth and Caroliua Hill. The stations Crocker, Baker's Pond, w· est Brewster, Kelly, King's Hill, and ~ickersou, which had been occupied in 1887, were also marked with stone posts. In addition to the above work, Mr. Van Orden -continued the s_ystem of accurate levelings. extending them along the line of the Old Colony Hailroau to .J.\liddleborough. As stated in tbe last Annual Re1)ort, the whole line so far run is permanently marked by copper plates, secured to the station and freight houses ef the railroad. BelGw Tremont all of the plates were referred to meau tide level of the gauges of Cape Cod and Buzzard's Bay.

Upon Martha's Yine;1anl and No }fan's Lan{l, tLe resuneys were executed by A.~sistant ,J,~,J:n Donn; upon Nansbon aml the Falmouth shore, by Assis taut \Y.

For the details of the work of these several partie;;, the time occupied duriug the season of L-<8.'\, and tlJe ;;tatistie8, reference may lrn ma1le to the reports of their chiefa, which ,,.ill be found mHkr separate headings in this arl(l the next section.

This part of the Vineyard is rnark»tl lJ.Y n snceession of irregular hills, which, with the exception of the JUanomet Hills near Plymouth, an· the highest in southeastern Massachusetts, the l1ighei:.t summits being from about tbret· lw11(ln·1l to three hundred and ten feet. In approaching Yiueyard Sound from the southwest, the conical top of Prospect Bill is the first land seen from the sea. "The territory of Ga.v Head, formerly an Indian resenatiou of l\lassachusetts, has all area of between five and six square miles, terwinati11g at its western extremity in tbc curiously Yariegated clay cliffs which give the name to this remarkable head-land. The land of the penimmla of Gay Head is generally hilly; l\Iolaska Ilill, near the center, is about one lmmlrell aml eigl1ty·fiH feet ltigll· The soutb west and northeast points of the peuiusula, lwwe\'er are of !Jeach formatiou. The hig·Jiest html at Kashaquitsa is about one hundred and fifteen feet, and at Squipnocket about sixty-llse feet. "The triangulation execnte,d b_y Assistant H. A. l\I arr iu 1887, has furnished, as was i11te.rnl ,,,1, sufficient basis for the topographical resun·eys which ha,·e been made during the past seaso11 of 1888 by Assistant J. Yr. Douu. I need hardly say that th<~ accuracy and style of Mr. Donn',.; "~ork bas been of the first order in everJ- respect, and more in detail than was the cnstom to follow 111 the earlier >Stun.'_y. "The agreement in geographical position of the main features of the two suneys is, Lowe\ct, so far satisfactory that the comparison of tl1em gi\·es a reliable basis for u1cwmring tl1e cha11g\·~ e.ffeded by time and otlrer natmal causes dnriug the inten·a] of forts-three ,Har.,; sine» tlw first sun'ey was made. "From the physical peculiaritiPs of Gas Read, and the importance of its positiou as m1e of tlw main promontories of tl1e coast markiug the entrance to Vineyard Sound * " * it was ckemed desirable to make the resurvey of the special features of the cliff on a larger ;,male thau that usunll~ given to tlir. field work of ordinary shore topography. For this purpose a sheet was projected on a scale of 1-2500, or about 25.3 inches to a statute mile. On this sheet :\lr. Donn made a Yer;y elaborate survey of the features of this remarkable cliff, whicli is the onl_y one uf its kiud iu tlw whole extent of our Atlantic coast. ''Owing evidently to the tenacious character of the clay of which tlle Gay Head Cliffs are composed, they have held their own much more firmly tlutn might 11arn been t~xprct0tl against tile attaeks of the sea, which at times dashes against their base with the violence of' the heaYi<!St storm hr.. aker,,.;. the most apparent cause of the giviug away of tlie lmse of the cliffs, which occasionally lrnppt>11s ill slides of greater or less masses, seems to be the insidious action of spriugs arnl quicksamls at tl1eir hase. "Although this head-lan<l is exposed, as before remarked, to the ful1 sweep of the ocea11, tit(' immediate shore and beacb is guarded hy the bed of bowlders which extend well out lwymitl tlw water-line. It was on one of these sunken bowlders tl1at the ill-fated steamer City of Co/111J1/111s struck. 'l'hese 'rocks.' as they are locally called, u111lonbtedly mark tl1P former grouncl of tlw original head-laud. The 'DHil's Bridge,' so called, coufirms the theory and fact that Hie grcatl·r mass of them was deposited along the higher and more northerly part of the origiual drift. "The waste of this remarkable head-land has alread,Y n·acht·<l a, line beyoud its original ;.;nm· mit, so that all future loss will lower its eleni.tion, and that of the first order light, now not for from the crest of the cliffs, unless in the next retreat (one bas already been made) a higber light-hon~e structure is el'ccted.

"Owing to the comparative smallness of the :;cale of the surrny of 184:";, .tud the worn condition of the older map and change in tlte position of the light-house as a main point of reference, it is difficult to make a close comparison and measurement of details. Tbe >ery elaborate surrny made lly :l\Ir. Donn will, howenr, presern the record of the exact position of the cliffs, with all their varied physical a11d topographical features, from which a closer and more interesting knowledge of future changes can be obtained. "The be8t comparison tba t can now be made shows, near the nortll west point of the bead-land, for a lateral distance of about three hundred and hfty feet, a slide or gh-ing way of the summit line of' the cliff, the greatest amount of waste of which is about ninety feet. From the same point eastward along the shore of the Sound for a distance of about fifteen lrnudre<l feet, the summit line of the bank has fallen back irregularly in various places. A former spur, nearly opposite the light-house, has gi,·en away a distance of about one hundrell and twenty feet. Along the line of' the Go,·ernment laud surroumling tlle light-house, there has been an average waste of from eighty to ninety feet. There llas uot been much apparent change in the position of the liigh-water line along this front of the bead· land." ~\Yitll regard to the resur>ey of the shore topography of the small island of No l\fan's Land, l;ying abont fi>e and a half miles south a little east from Ga,y Head Light., Mr. "\Vbiting observes that the scale of resurvey was 1-5000. Being so far outside of' the larger islands, it is open to the action of the sea from all directions, and the earthy material of which it is composed makes it an easy prey to the consuming power of the waves. Full details of changes in the configuration of the shores since the first survey are giYen in Mr. Whiting's report. Referring to l\lr. Vinal's resur>ey of Wood's Holl and vicinity, an account of which is gi>en under a separate heading iu this section, Mr. "\Vlliting states, as a general result, after reviewing the detailed resurny, wbicll was executed on a scale of 1-5000, that no important change has taken place in the main features of the topography during the last forty-three years. This be deems :Somewhat surprising, particularly in Ute features of Wood's Holl, in >iew of the strength of the currents that are constantly rushing th.rough its narrow anll tortuous water-way, and it suggests an inter<'sting field, he thinks, for physical in\·estigation as to the power of im bedded bowlders and shingle, where no actual ledges seem to exist, to resist the forces of tidal currents of such high velocities. The resurvey on the south coast of Long Island, in charge of .Assistant Iardella, reported under a headiug in Section II, was also made a subject of examination and inspection by Mr. Whiting. The character of the topography is similar to tlrnt of the south side of Martha's Viueyard, except the general elevation of the plains as they slope toward and border on the larger ponds and ba;ys, which extend along the south shore from Southampton to Coney Island, is somewhat less than those ou :\Iartba's Vineyard, which more generally end in small banks or terraces, whereas at Long Island the plains border on the ponds at nearly the high-water le>el. The nature or degree of the changes sincP; the first surveys, which were amoug the earliest made, dating back to the period between 18'34 and 1845, ca1mot be stated until a careful comparison is made witll the original topograpbical sheets tlien executed. Other sen·ice as:;igned to )fr. Whiting is referred to under separate headings in this section. Adflitions of topographical details to the original surreys of Nantucket ancl Martha's Vineyard Isla11ds.-In furtherance.\ of his assigument to the general charge and supervision of the topographical resun·e~·s ou the islands of Nantucket and :Martha's Vineyard, .Assistant Henry L. Vi'hiting has snbmitted a report of the work executed b~- him under instructious issued early in July, 1888. Tlns work has consisted mainly in adding to the topographical sheets the several county and town roads 'iYhich have been laid out antl opened on Martha's Vineyard since the original 1-urvey was made, in 1845. The fact of the loss of most of the early triangulation points made it possible to locate these new features in barrnony with the original work only by the use of such of' the old plane-table points as could be identified, such as the chimneys of conspicuous houses, ete. :Much time and labor were required to do this, more than wouitl at first appear, because of the discrimination needed to ascertain by various tests which of the old points were used as bases in the original survey.

Mr. Whiting states tbat the results in the main l.Ja>e been more satisfactory than he auticipated, and that he ltas been eYen surprised at the general coincidence of the old and new work, considering the &canty SUJlply of the early triangulatiou points, the original survey of the central part of the island having been based on but two points, Prospect and Indian Bill, and these so far apart that the~· can not be used together in any given section of work. The compass and chai11 of the early surYeys ha Ye Joug beeu superseded by the plane-table and the telemeter. The lines of the new roads 11aYe. l1ec11 imposed upou the original sheet in red ink without changing or erasing an_y of the older work, thus affording a comparison of the lay-out of new road1; where they follow in whole or in part the directions of former by-roads, farm road,.,, etc. All of the road resuneys west and north uf the central Yillages of 'Yest and North Tisbury were completed; uufarnrable weather compelled a postponement of tbe resurrny of the two new roads iu the northeasterly part of the island. Under a preceding beading in this section reference is made to special surn·ys for the State of Massachusetts carried on under Mr. \Yhiting's direction. Hydrograpltic resm·i-eys fa .Na"1ticcket Svund.-About the middle of September Lieut. J. l\I. Helm, U. S. N., assistant Coast and Geodetic Sune.Y, who had relie\·ed Lieutenant Crosby, L. S. N., in the command of the steamer Ged1icy, was instructed to take up a hydrographic resurvey in Nantucket Sound. This work had been fairl.Y Leguu, when an emergency arose which demanded the recall of the Gedney and orders to lier commander to proceed to New York and prepare her for sen-ice on the Pacific coast. Having been hastily owrhauled aud fitted out, slle left New York for Sau Francisco November 13, 1888, and arrived in the latter port on the ::oth of April following. Lieutenant Belm was instructed later to organize a party for hydrographic surveys on the Pacific coast, in the vicinity of Cape Orford. (Refereuce to this service will be found under a beadiug in Section XI.) Hydrographic resurvtys in Nanti1cket and rineyard Sounds.-Reference was made iu the last Annual Report to the organizatiou of a bydrographic party by Lieut. S. C. f'aiue, U. S. X., commanding tbe schooner Eagre, to execute parts of the hydrographic resurveys required in .Nautucket and Vineyaru Sounds. Soon after the beginning of the fiscal year the Eagre was at Hyannisport, l\1ass., aud while there lJrought up the souudi11gs needed 011 projection No. 1 as far as Bishop and Ulerks Light· House. Work on this prf!.jection, witll Jiruits from Falmouth to Hyaunisport, was finisbe.f September 15. Tbe steamer Daisy, Ensign F. Swift, U. S. N., in command, joined the party July 9. Ahout the middle of September work was begun on inojection No. 4 to the north of Nantucket, and continued till NO\·ember 2, when the ad>ance of the season made it advisable to suspend further operations. Work on this projection was completed, with the exception of the de.-elopment of the shoals. TL at on projection No. 13, Nantucket Harbor, was entirely fiuislied. To Ensign Swift, commanding the Dafay, was assig11ed the task of resurveying the northern Jiart of Muskeget. Cha1111el, joining on with the resurver of Ueutenant l\Ioser, wlnch ha:s lleeu reported Ullder anotller lieadiug in this section. This work was laid ont on pr~jection No. 3, but owing· to the Yery strong currents, and the difficulty of establishing 011 the shoals signals tl1at would stand the bigh winds and hea\·y·seas, the progress made was not entirel~· satisfactoQ-. The work was, however, finished before the close of the season, with the exception of the de\·elopmeut of the shoals. Lieutenant Paine observes tbat the season as a whole "·as not farnrable for hydrographic work; that while there was comparatively little fog and rain, high wiuds prerniled, which made the sea so rough that on many ckar days it was impossible to do any accurate work. In his annual report, and in the dt'seriptiYe reports accompanying it. are given the locatiou of the tide-gauges established by the part;'\", with statements of the areas of reduction of soundings to whicli they apply; also such data and information relating to changes in shore-line and cl1allnels as will be of value for the Coast Pilot.

Hprlrographic re.~uri·ey of the a.pproache.~ to Jfartha'8 Vineyard .rind Nantucket, and re.mrtelJ of JI uskeget C!tannel.-The hydrograpltic sm"1·w·s executed by the party in charge of Lieut. J. F . .:\loser, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Baclie, iu tlle :-;uwmer and autumn of 188S, were a continuation to tlrn eastward of the surveys made by the same officer tlming the preceding season. In 1887 work was closed on a line thirteen miles west (true) frow ~o }fan',- Land; thcuce south (true) to the twenty-fathom curve. From these limits the off.:;hore hydrography was continued to the eastl'l·anl and a resurvey made of J\fuskeget Channel. Tile limit to 8caward was the twenty-fathom curve, pro>ided that this curve connected the deep-sea liues run by tlJe steamer Blake; if they did not connect, then the work was continued sea l'l·arll until a proper connection wa8 madt'. Tlle off-siiore work was executed on a scale of 1-40000; the l\Iuskeget Chanuel work on a scale
of 1-:.!00UO. For tlrn off-shore hydrography the system of execution is similar to that of the previous sea-

sons, namely, normals half a mile ap:trt from the shore to a distance of six or seven miles, and thence to the limit a mile apart. This system is crossed by lines beginning at the shore and half a mile apart, this distance bei11g increa:;ed seaward until the outer limit is reached, where the lines an· about one and oue·half miles apart. The boat system connecting the ship lines with the shore ,·aries as tlle coast demands. Wbere the coast is rocky, or, rather, has scattered over it great 11urnhers of bowlders, as in the vicinity of Squipnocket Point, the lines are run very close so as to make the development full. From Sqnipnocket to Muskeget Channel the shore is bold and clear and tlle system of boat-work more open. Between the fogH which frequently visit this exposed coast during the summer months, the prerniling winds, wliiclJ are strong from the southwest, and the usual course of New Euglaud weather, tlJe number of working days on this coast are not ver,y many, as a general rule, but the seasou of 1888 was au uuusually l.Jad one, notable for the frequency of high winds, rains, and heavy seas. During July and August fog prevented work for several Jays at a time. About the middle of Angnst, as tl1e soutlJwest winds continued to blow very hard, preventing outsi<1e work, I,ientenant :'\loser tlecided to go to Edgartown and begin work on tlJe resurvey of ~Inskeget Channel. The limits of the projection for this work were from .Muskeget Island to Cave I'oge aud \Yasque Blnff and thence to· seaward. Having previously informed himself as full.\" as possil>le iu regard t'J tlie locality l>y communieating with people who were familiar with it, be was prepared to encounter great nattual difficulties in the execution of the sun·ey, anrl he fouml tlw aceouut:s given of these difficulties uot at all exaggerated, and that the work was always al·co1upanietl by more or less danger. From '.\lnskeget Island to \Vasque Bluff is a distance of over five miles, between which no signal can l>e erected; a line of shoal water exteucls between these two poiuts and beyond; Cape Poge is distant from \Vasque Point about four miles, aud the time of high and low water between these last two poiuts is more tltau four hours, or more than two-thirds of a tide.

It gains its impetus from the difference of water le\·el, furthPr aeceleratl'd lly tlw funnels tl1rough which it is drawn. In such a curreut it was found impossible to keep a regular system of lines. A boat would start on a regular liue, and before a second position could be plotted slle wonlu probably h(· swept by the current on an adjoiniug Hue. Tlie curre11t is uot tlle same in direction over all tlw work; on the same tide it will rnrJ-· <'ight i1oints on tiiflerent parts of tlie field. Hence the lines could not be carried continuously; the work had to be done according to the conditions of the weather; when this was ex:ceptiouall.Y good tile more daugeroutS portions of the work ·1vere done, and the rest at other tillles as the co111li ti om< seerne(i frtrnrable. Lieutenant l\Ioser gi\·es in bis report full details in regard to the channels, currents, shoals, and other data ofintereRt to the 11avigator ancl of vahrn for the Coast Pilot within the limits inelndPd in his suney, devoting a large part of his report to the peculiarities of l\l nskeget Channel, respecting wliich lie observes that few vessels e,·er use it, and none without a pilot unless hr accident. His recommendations for additional buoys .at its southern entrance will be duly reported to the Light-Honse Board. Heferring to the scarcity of aids to navigation on the southern coasts of Xantucket arnl Martha's Vineyard, Lieuteuaut :\loser remarks that there is no coast light from Sankat.r Head to Gay Head, a distance of forty miles, aud tlmt the only lrnoys in tlw same distance are oue on }lutton Shoal, Mnskeget Entrance, and three marking the charrnel between Xo 1\lan's Land anrl ::\Iartlia'i; Vineyard. He asks why there is not a tirst-orcler light on No J\Ia11's Land iustt>acl of Gay Hf':irt, tile island just named lJeiug one of moderate ele,·atio11, admirably Rituated for a sea.coast light, as it is six miles fartller seaward than Gay Head. A light could be plaeed on tile island tilat would send its rays o\·er the European steamer track. At Gay Head, all that be deem8 necessary is a fourth·order light as a guide for tile entrance to the Sound. Ju stead of the secou<l-class can buoy now at the Dedl's Bridge he recommends a whistling buoy. It had lJeen Lieutenant l\loser's intention to run all the north and soutli lines to a point on the southeastern side of Nantucket, and tiJen from the abo,·e rauge and angle at No ::\Ian's Laud, cover the north and sonth system, bnt the work at l\Iuskeget occupietl the party much longer tllau bad been expected, and it was deemed preferable to finish the work on that sheet, the changes there, from year to year, being probably very great. The principal tide-gauge was established at No )Jan's Land, and day tides observed there from Jul.y G to October 30. A comparison gauge was used at Wasque Bluff, wliich confirmed tliedata in the office tide-tables-that the times and heights were approximately the same at the"e two points. Comparisons of time and height at \Vasque Bluff, with data derived from the observation;; at Cape Poge, made by the party under Lieut. S. C. Paine, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Suner, showed a ditlerence in tide of four hours, with an inappreciable difference in height. At Cape Poge high water was four hours later than at Wasque Bluff or at No Man's Land. For the work off Martha's Vineyard but one tide-gauge was used-that at No 1\lan's Land. For the l\fns. keget Channel work, owing to the great complication of tides to be dealt witli, a system of blocks was employed, tlie details and limits of which are stated in Lieutenant l\foser's report. Of this exceedingly comprehensive report (B) the foregoing is but a limited extract; the informatiori it gives relative to all of the hydrographic characteristics of the areas lllHler SUl'\'ey will be of great value in the preparation of a new edition of the Coast Pilot for the approaches to 5an· tucket and Viueyard Sounds. To the officers and crew of the Bache Lieutenant Moser expresses his acknowledgments for their diligent efforts to forward the work. The following name<l officers were attached to the party during the season: Ensigns \V. l\I. Constaut, H. A. Bispham, J. E. Shindel, W. H. G. Bullard, and S. l\L Strite, U. S.

Topographic 1·esurrey of parts of the north and south shores of 1l1artha's Vineyard.-Also of the shore line of ll'o Jlan's Land.-In pursuance of instructions issued early iu July, 1888, Assistant .John W. Donn organized a party for the resurny of the north shore of the Island. of 1\-Iartha's \~ine~«nd from Tashmoo (or Cha.ppaquonsett) Pond to Menernsha Bight, thence to Gay Hea1l, all(l from Gay Head along the south shore to \Yec-quobska Cliffs, taking iu also the outl,ying island of No .:\Ian's Laud. At Tashmoo Pond and vVec-quobska, the extremities of the projected shore line work, junction was to be made with the resur>eys of Assistants Whiting and Vinal, which had been preYionsly completed. \York wa:s ht:"gun July 12 at Indian Bill, and advanced ea~t and west along shore, including a marg-in of topography of varying width, a>e1·aging about a quarter of a mile. Upon finishin~· tl.Jis work between Tash moo and Menemsha, the party was moved in August to Gay Head, aud au elaborate :sune;y of the cliffs ai:d eastward slope of that locality was made upon a scale of 1-'.!500, or ~1.:-'i.t. inches to the statute mile. Contour lines were run for every fh'e feet of eleYation~ thus tliorougbly tlm·eloping the surface. As the weather was generally fair and free from high winds during the progress of this survey, the conditions were very favorable for the completion of a map of Gay Head, which will serve as a trne basis for future comparisons. Tbc hciglits of scYeral prominent objects were determined by lines of levels connecting them with the bench-mark establiislie1l by Assistant Henry :Mitchell, in 1857, at :Menernsha Bight. The base of the light-house tower upon the cliff, antl the tops of two large bowlde'rs at the northwest anti ~outhwest curns of the tshore arouud Gay Head were the principal points. These bowl<lers wt~re :-;elt>cted for the purpose of discornring the degree of subsidence of bowlders by the action of the sr>a, in connection with the receding of the shore. Fpon the transfer of the party to No l\fau's Land, the shore and cliff-lines of tlie island were sun·e,\·ed, and the lieights of the principal cliffs were determined, but no resnrYey of the interior was made, contours having been carried oYer tlie surface by Assistant Whiting in his suney of 1855. The island is entire!.'· bare of trees and covered ""°itli grass, so that little or no surface . degratlarion occurs by reaso11 or winds or wtn-es.

After the work on Gay Head cliffs had been finished, the shore line resurve;y was taken up from l\ienem&lla around the Head, and along the ~outh coast, together with the cliff work at Squibnocket, N ashaquitsa, and"'\\' ec-quobska. This done~ the widening of the margin of topography between Menernsba and Tashmoo was begun, with the intention of reaching the tops of the higl1est hills and ridges overlooking the sound aucl the sea. But the allotment of funds for the survey haviug become exhausted by the 20th of October, the work was brought to a close. Following are the statistics: Topography: Area surveyed in square statute miles (scale, 1-10000) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 Lengths of shore-line in statute miles (scale, 1-10000) .........·.. _......... 29 Length of shore-line of ponds in statute miles (scale, 1-10000).............. 4 Length of shore-line of creeks in statute miles (scale, 1-10000).. . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 Length of roads in statute miles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 For the more detailed surveys on the Gay Heall cliffs and on No l\1an's Land, the statistics are: At Gay Head: · Length of instrumental contour lines in statute miles (scale, 1-2500) ........ 50 At No Man's Land: Length of shore-line in statute miles (scale, 1-5000) ...................... _ 5 Area (approximate) in statute miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 After returning from Martha's Vineyard, Mr. Doun received instructions to execute a topographical resurvey of Annapolis Harbor aud approaches. Notice of this work will be found under a heading in Section III. :J.opographical resuri1ey of shore line and adjacent details in Wood's Holl and on the islands in its immediate vicinity.-Heference was made in the last Annual Report to the assignment of Assistant W. I. Vinal to dut;y ou the coast of Ma.ssachusetts uudel' the general direction of Assistant Henry L. Whiting. Having reported to Mr. Whiting, Re was directed to take up a topographical resur· vey of the vicinity of \Vood's Holl, and organized his party for that purpose immediately upon l'eaching the working ground, June 18, 1888. This resurvey was to be executed upon a scale of 1-5000, to show the shore-line with adjacent details both inside and outside of high-water mark, and to include the village o_f \Vootl's Holl, tile islands of Uncatena and Nonarnessett, and part of Naushon Island, with the 1ws1tion1> of outl_yiug rocks, whether detached or in reefs. Some delay was encountered at the outset, owing to tlie disappearance of important stations -of the old triangulation in the course of tile many cilanges aud improvements since tile original survey. The weather was less favorable than usual, the summer being rainy aud the mouths of September and October more than ordinarily stormy aud cold. Uu Septemuer 26 occurred a storm which was said to be the most vfolent and destructive experience(l in that region in over forty ~-ers. Tbe very swift current of the straits, locally known as ''The Hole," between Nonamessett Island and the main shore, obliged Mr. Vinal to work with the tides, and thereby ofteu inYoh·ed delays on clays when the weather and tides were farnrable for passing through aud returning. ';rhis current has abraded the north side of Pine Isl and and tile points of Long N eek and Devil's Foot Island to a marked extent. Field operations were closed November 5, the work not ha Ying been quite completed owing to the many drawbacks encountered throughout the season. · A descriptive report has been submitted by l\Ir. Vinal to accompany his topographical sheet. In this report reference is made to the geological features, the roads, bridges, growth of forest8, aud other details of interest relating to the region under survey. Encroachments of the sea, and consequent serious changes in the shore-line OH the Buzzard Bay side of Long Neck, and on the mainland, particular.ly between the Bay and Gl'{~at Harbor, arc prevented by three short breakwater<'; or walls of stone, built along the high-water ridge. The low-water line is distinctly defined on the sheet, but, as :Mr. Vinal observes, it may be slightly modified in outline when the soundings are plotted · . H. Ex. 55--3

Ha·ing organized his party, arrangements were made by l\Ir. Perkins for the occnp<ltion of Penobscot l\iountaiu, a commanding point four miles south of \Vilkesbarrc. The instrnments were im111ediatcl.Y mounted, and heliotropers posted at the eightstations surronrnliug which were includetl in the scheme. Pcnoliscot overlooks tlie country to th.e north of it, as far as the State boundary, eastwanl into Pike County, southward into Oarbou and Schuylkill Counties, and westward to the Sm;quehanna. Owing chiefly to the immense amount of fnel consumed in this coal rniniug and rnauufactming region, the atmospllere is probabl_y at all times unfa-.orable for obser'."ations, bnt, as ::\fr. Perkins reports, particularly so during the summer aud autumn of 1888 ou accom1t of the unnsnal amount of rainy and cloudy weather. Tllis prevented the successful use of the heliotropes and greatly retarded prngrcss. He recommends that hereafter night signals be employed, so that results ade11uate to tlie time and energy given to the work hJ· the obs1wn·rs may be obtained. Professor Barnard took great interest in the work, bnt was called away from tl1e party August 22, and was unable to return. Economy in expenditures demanded the dc>tail of )Ir.

Topn[1rnpliical res111'i'C!J of Annapo/i.~ Ha,.bor and Roads.-Late in October, 1888, Assistant Jolin \\. Dorm was instructed to organize a part5· for the topographical resurvey of Annapolis Harbor autl lfoatls. Triaug·nlation points about Annapolis being scarce, an effort was made to externl a. piaue-table tria11gulation from tlie ohl Kent Island base-liue across the Uhesapeaketo the entrauce to Severn Ri\·er, and a special lHC(jectiou was made for that purpose, but upon examination of tlie locality, }lr. Do1111 found that no points upon that well-known line were in existence. The positiou of the south l'tHl, which had been established about fift_y metres from the shoreline as it 'l>as in 1853, was found to be under water, and distaut from the preseut sl1ore-line about ten metret:i. The north end, though located upon high ground about one lrnndred metres from tlm :-ihore, had also disappeart>d, Gnu the munud which once encircled the mounmellt hall been leYele(l with the surronmliug ground. So clne remained h_y ·which an approximatiou to the position coulu be reacheil, and as uo oue living in the neiglluorhood had eYer seeu the stone which marked it, t!Je conclm;ion was that it lrnd heeu rernoHd or destro_yed duriug the cidl war. It became necessary, therefore, to obtaiu an independent base, and a fa·rnrahle locality havillg hee11 fonrnl <m Greenlmry's Point, a line ahont a mile long was establislied by repeated measurement;.: \\·ith steel tape.

The accuracy of thi,; triangulation was tested hy determining as poiuts in the scheme the positions of two stations of the old triangulation, spire of St. John's a11d State House, the conespoudeu<:e liring found perfect iu llistancl'. Data were thus derh·ed for carrying forward a topographical resm·,~ey upou a scale of 1-10000 of the shores of Annapolis Roads and Severu Hiver from Tally's Point aud Hackett's Point to the county l>rillge auon the Naval Cemeter_y. ~"- detail;;ll snrYey nf the NaYal Academy grounds, including tbe cemetery and farm, and country lyiug het\l'een, was made on a scale of 1-50000.

Establishment (~(permanent bcnch-marl..-8 for the topograph ie<Ll snJTey of thr: JJi.~trict of Columbia.In the coimie of the 1letailed topogrnphical snn-ey of the District of Uolnmhia, carried on betwee11 the years JSSO awl 1887, in cliarge of Assistant John \V.

During these ~-ear,;, lwwe\·er, it wa,o; fonrnl that many of the bench-marks were fast disappearing, owing part]~· to their haying beeu unlawfully allll maliciously tlistiubed, and partly to the gradual obliteratiou of characteristic marks an<l features by which the~· were to be identified. In orcler tllercfore to establish at different localities a series of permanent bench-marks, secured hy reference marks which would be likely to remain undisturbed, Mr. J. A. Flemer, Aid, was <lirecte1l early in ,July, 11188, to submit a scheme for the placi11g of these bench-marks, with plans and 1lt>scriptions, consulting the Engineer Commissioner of the District of Colnmbia with regar1l to tllem, and ::mcnring his apprm·al lu~fore nndertakiug tlrn exeention of the work. This ha\·iug been <lone, the bench-marks, consisting of granite blocks ahout three feet in length and het\\·een fil·e and six ilwhes in cross-sectiou, dressecl down on top to surfaces four inches square1 and desigimtcd by 11umhcrs, were8unk in the ground to nearl.r a level with the surface in places where it was improbable tltat they woul1l l>e !listurhed. With each one of these bench-marks, marks were placed six feet due sonth from their center, and three feet nullerground, these umlergremnd refere11cc marks consisting of col>ble-stones (nnles11 otherwise indicated in t!Je <lescriptious), with a drill lwle in the center, to show the exact point the elenttion of which had been determined. All eleYations of these pennanent benches were carefully checked by reference to old hench-marks which. ha!l remained unchanged in position. As '.\Ir. Flemer"s in8trnctions 1litl not relieve him from office duty, the main work of placing the uew marks in position and of determlniug their elevetions tlevoh-cll upon }fr..A.tlee Johnson, aicled hy Peiren B11tt, Mr. Flemer taking general supervision of the work, inspecting, testing, and checking· it.

The nature of this work and the mums adoptd to execute i;;; cleitrl.r stated iu the following estraet from Lieutenant ;\foser's report:·' Tlte waters aloug this coast, from Anclote (A11choragt>) to Appalachee Bay, shoal Yery gradually, aml the ten·fathom cune is from thirty to forty miles oft' shore. Tl.le shore bei11g very low, is iu most cases out of sigllt at the three-fathom cm-ve. To put up signals on tllis eoa;;t for the purpose of simply locatillg tlie i11uer ends of the Jiues woul<l baYe required a loug time, not to speak of the difficulties iu trauspol'tiug the lnm!Jer o,·er such long distances. As the manner of executing this work was left to m;r discretion, I couclnded to locate the lines by astronomical obserrntions, particularly as tlwrc were no ontlyiu g dangers. 1 therefore adopted a system of lines two mile;; apart aml, iu order to gi rn the greatest weight to meridian altitudes, laid them true east antl west. 'fhe chronometers were ah>o well rated by telegraph for longitude. '·\Ve found, huwever, after commencing work that by stamliug well into the shore we were able to recognize certain topographical features, snch as points of land, woods, keys, aud a few house;-; that 1' ere ou our sheets. B.r tlle usual methods we were therefore able to locate tlie inner t'JHls of tlH~ lines quite acenratel_y. \Vhen the eomlitions were Yery f;n·orable we anchored barrel imuys on the inner ends of the hues, and in this manner obtainer! yery good results.

To obtain a plane of refereuce for the soundings a title gauge was put up in tl1e Steinbatchee Hin·1\ an1l compari:sons were rna1le outside of the mouth in three fathoms of water in Deadman'tS Ba~·, a11d in six fatho1m.; south of Ucklohouec Shoal.

From Ce1lar Keyes north tue bottom is quilt'. regular as far as Deadman's Ba,Y, but in the ;qlproaclws to ,\ppalachPe Bay a clrnuge of '1Ppt!J of a fathom is not infrequent beyond the sixfathom enrYe.

T11is part of tile coa:;:t is generally bordered bJ· bluffs from ten to one Luudretl feet iu ileigbt, imm1t· of whicL are fiat mesas 01· table-lands, sloping gently toward tlrn oceau, Laving soil of remarlrnl1le fertility, as is shmn1 whereYer intelligent. labor is employed in dc,·elopiug its resources. The problem of a. suppl,\- of water for drinking aud for 1mrpoi"eR of irrigation is the controlling oue, aud the necessity of immediate expenditure to obtain it Lleten; rapid settlement. .Mr. Hodgei'S ob:wnt"" tltat rmture has proYitlerl an abnm1ant interior rain-fall autl convenient sites for storage re'ierrnirs in the tlt't'P canons of the foot-hills. The average rain-fall of San Diego County coast is about twelYe incl1es, but the Liglt summits of the interior ha,·e a much larger precipitation; tl1irts to forty inches is claimed; this fall is upon abrupt mountain slop!ls at elevations of from two thousand to five thousand feet aho,·e sea-len~l, and reaches tlrn ocean iu denuding freshets, without effect otLer than damage to tlic valleJ·s through which they pass. Euterpri::H'S looking· to the utiliz.atiou of this waste water by storage resen·oirs have already uee11 i1w11puated. Beginning at San )Ia.teo Poiut and goiug southward there are se,·eu streams wllich may be c10terl as arnilable for water storage-Ute San Mateo, the Sar· Onofre, J~as Flores, I,a Margarita, t!JP San LuiR HPy, Ran DiPgo RiHr (so called), and the Sweetwater. T!Jese streams, iusiguificaut iu tue montus of sumuu'r, are ofteu raging torrents iu winter. 'l'wo of these streams are uow beiug tle'\'elopell in tlte i11terest of settleweut. A company has been formed to utilize the waters of tl1P Sau Luis Jies water-shed. The valley through which this stream finds its way to the ocean is notable as the site of one of the principal missions founded· by the Franciscan monks iu 177ti. Tlte old church lmildiug witli its dependencies, wbidr t.ook twenty years or more to complete, is now little more than a majestic ruin. Its site is tltree mile8 inland from the present town of Oeeauside . .A similar, but more matured, enter1irise has secured a reservoir site in the Sweetwater Valley two lrnndred and thirty feet above sea-level aud fifteen miles southeast of the city of San Diego, and Las hmlt a masonry dam niuet,v feet in height.

During the winter mouths, the 11ort!t winds drawing 1lown Portland Canal aud Obsc1Tatory Inlet, like huge funnels, blow with great violence through Portlantl Inlet, rendering the crossing of Dixon Entrance at this point a hazardous undertaking, except to the staunchest steamers.

On October 1, 1888, ii.fr. \Vinston sent forwar<l bis party, consisting of Subassistant P. A. Welker, .:\Ir. F. A. Young, recorder, and two rodmen, to Cairo direct, he himself proceeding by way of .:\lem1lhis and ,facksou, Tenn., in order to arrange with tlrn Di,·ision Superintendent of the Illinois Central Railroad for the stoppage of his trains to put off and pick up the leveling parties while engaged in working along the Iiue of the road. Tim official referred to, l\Ir. \Y. H. Clarke, with the approval of Mr. C. A. Beel;:, General Superintendent, responded ,·ery liberally to 1\Ir. vVinston's request, gi>ing orders for the required stoppages 110t only to his passenger trains, but also to his freight trains, altlwugll tlrn freigllt traffic OYer the road was very heavy. To these gentlemen the thanks of the Snr,·ey are specially due, the labors of the party having been greatly facilitated hy their courtesy. l7pou the arrival of the party at Cairo, observations were made to determine the constants of geodetic tcrnls Nos. 2 and 3, aud work was then begun from bench-mark z, established by Assist· ant J. B. W cir in 1885, at Villa I~idge, Ill., a station ou the Illinois Central Uailroad, twelve miles uorth of Cairo. Tbe method followetl was that adopted for running the standard le\'els of the Survey, the forward meaRnrement being madt>, h~- one observer an1l the backward measurement by another. Com1mtations of the results were kept up to tlate, an,! the discrepancy 0etween the two measures was not allowed to exeeed firn millimetres per kilometre without remeasurement, in order to keep any discrepancy within the limit. \Vheu the liues reached Cairo, connection was made with United States bench-marks Nos. 1, 2, and :3, established in 1876 by Gene-rat C. B. Comstock, U. S. Eugineers. Descriptions of these bench-marks had been famished by the Secretary of the :Mississippi Hiver Commission. A crnssiug of the Ohio River was made and the line coutiuued across western Kentucky to the vicinity of Greenfield, Tenn., where, on Januars 6, 1889, field operations were closed for the season, the appropriation having become exhausted. Permanent bench-marks, such as stones or brass bolts, secured by lead in brick walls or chimneys, were establislted in all towns through wllich the party passed, and printed notices were placed near them. In count_y towns the bench-marks were established on the court-houses wherever it was practicable to do so. During the whole of the seitson it was necessary to place the instruments upon the railroad track at nearly every station, and the work was con.sequently much delayed b.r passing trains. In the latter part of December and in January delay was also caused by the necessity of cutting lwles tllrough the frozen crust of the ground for the tripod legs. l\Ir. \Vinston expresses his indebtedness to Subassistant P. A. Welker for efficient and faithful sen-ice, Also to l\Ir. F. A. Young, recorder, wllo served satisfactorily. The statistics are as follows:

Measurement of a ba8e line hi connection 1cith geodetic operation11 in tlte State of Jli1111esota.-ln continuation of geodetic operations in the State of )liunesota, Prof. \Y. R. Hoag ~\.cting Assistant, ha>ing definitely located a primary base line upon Snelling avenue in the cit,'I· of St. Paul, carried a line of leYels o.-er it in SeptPmber, ISSS, mal UJlOll the 21st of that month A:;sistant C. 0. Boutelle, in immediate charge of State Stir\·eys, took direction of the nwasnrenwnt, Professor Hoag assisting. The northern terminus was decided U}JOn, and an obsen·ing tripod and scaffold. sixt;y-four feet high, built m·er it. All preliminary obsen·ations haviug been made, the actual measurement was begun October 17. The line runs nearly north and south, its direction being less than six minutes of arc east of north, and its length is, at mean level of the sea, as derived from t!Je measurement by the observer's reduction, 8,724.6\J metres, or about five miles aud four-tenths. The secondary six-metre contact-slide hase apparatus was used. The bars, Nos. 3 and 4, were compared at the Office before beiug sent to St. l'aul. l\Ir. Boutelle was aided iu the measurement by thirteen :roung students of engineeriug from the scientific department of the State University. He reports th1tt duriug the entire period of measurement, wl1ich occu1}ied parts of nine days~ October 17 to 26 inclush·e, no instance occurred -0f a wrong moYemeut or of any delay in tlle measurement through awkwardness or carelessness. This he states was unprecedented in any of his previous experience. Snelling A\.'e1me is oue of the graded streets of the cit,y of St. Paul, and altlwugh intended to be straight it really curves so far to the west that it was uecessary during the measurement to make an offset in order to carry the apparatus over the bridge, which crosses a deep cut of the SL Paul and Manitoba U.ailroad. The southern end of the . Axenue was not at tltat ti me graded, and was iu the condition of au -0rdinary countr.v road, with steep gradients. Ou this account l\fr. Boutelle remeasured the last one hundred and eighty bars, where many slopes had from four to the degrees of incliuatiou. ·These bars were measured in an opposite direction, with the slopes reversed, and the results of the two measurements showed a very gratifying agreement, the difference between them being about one millimetre. The mean temperature during the first measure was 66° Fahr., while 011 the remeasure it had fallen to 47,70 Fahr., thus affording a fair test of the co-efficient of expansion adopted for the base bars, which was 0.0000061 for each degree. The whole number of bars in the base was one thousanil four hundred and fifty-firn; and of these one hundred and eighty were remeasured, making the whole 1rnmber of bars measured sixteen hundred and thirty-fixe; this was done in forty-seven hours and thirty.four minutes, or at a rate of 3c!.'1 bars per hour. The most rapid progress made \Yas on October 23, when two humlred and sevenLy-nine bars were measured in six hours and thirty-four minutes, or at the rate of 42.5 bars per hour. At the close of the measurement both ends of the liue were carefolly marked. Owing to the depth to which frost penetmtes in Minnesota the lower marks were placed with their tops six fret below the surface. UYer these brick piers were laid in cement to a height of four feet, and 011 these were placed single blocks of Kasota stone, three feet square and two feet high, the tops of which came tbe surface. Into these tops copper bolts were set, a line mark upou each indieating tile terminus. Side mouument.s and piers of dressed stone with the usual iuscriptio11s will be placed in position next season . .After having marked tlie ends of tlie base 1\Ir. Boutelle returned to \\Tash in gt on and Prd'e.,;sor Hoag ran lines of L,·els to refer the measure<l base to the leYel of t!Je sea. Its meau heig!Jt aborn sea-level is 288.3 metres, allout niue hundred aucl fort~·-six feet. Iu June, 1889, in pursuance of instructions, Professor Hoag began a reco11naissance for the connection of tbe base with the secondary triangulation of 1887 aud for a final connectiou with the primary triangulation. He was occupied in this work at ti.le end of the Hscal year.

Occupation of stntirms fin· the extension to the eastwm·d in Utah of the primary triangulation near tht: thirty-ninth parallel.-In continuatioa of his work of the prev-ious years, and acting under instructions dated June 26, 1888, Assistant '\Villiam Eimbeck began all preparations needful for the occupation of Ogden Peak, Utah, one of the principal stations of the triangulation spanning the Gn·at Salt Lake. Upon reaching Salt Lake City, July 26, lie entered at once upon acti,·e field serdce by erect· iug i;ignals at City Creek, Antelope, Ogden Obsen·atory, and Nortl1 Ogden stations, by transferring camp eqnipagt> and instnuuents from Salt Lake City to the eastern fiank of the mountain, hy locating aud laying oat a pack trail ffre miles long from tl1e e!Hl of tile wagon road to the top of the Peak, which has au elev-atiou ahov-e sea-le>el of about 9,600 feet, hy transporting the instnuueuts aud equipments to the top, and by instructing, fitting out, and dispatching six par· ties of beliotropers to their distant mountain stations. The IJreparation of the station, the mounting of the instruments and their adjustment, occupied .Mr. Eimbeck personally, the two officers assigned to his party, Subassistants E. L. Taney and J. H. Turner, uot hadug beeu able to join him before the end of August. Ohservations were begun early in September, llml were brought to a satisfactory conclusion on the 15th of the next month, some interruption having been occasioned by the equinoctial storms which swept o\·er that entire section of the eouutr.r during the first three da,ys of October. foclnded in the work accomplished, l.wsitles the usual extensive series of primary antl secondm-y horizontal directions and double-zenith distance obsern1tions, were lleterminations of the .astronomical latitude, a primary astronomical azimuth, a complete series of determinations of the magnetic declination, <lip, and in tensity, and a somewhat more extended topograpl.dcal surv-ey of the mountain than was 11eeded for a mere description of tlie station, this survey bav'ing been undertaken and carried throogh in order to obtain local data for a more detailed study of condi· tions affecting the detlecti1m of the plumb-line. Nine primary directions were observed at Ogden, all of the longer lines, six in number, upo11 heliotropes; the remain1ler u1rnn the large target signals, which J\Ir. Eimheck has used for some year::i past, and in regar,l to which lie remarks that in point of \·isibility under the ordi~ar~- conditions of the atmosphere in summer the~· excel every other form of opaque signal be bas tried, exhibiting uo pha;,;e. The,v are also simple and economical in construction. The secondary directions obsen·Nl were nn merons, and included all of the principal mountain peaks ...-isible within a circuit of about eighty miles radius. As a rule, these points were marked by a stone monuJLient or cairn of adeqtmte size, and resembling in shape the frustum of a cone. They were obserYed with precision in two, tllree, or more positions of the theodolite, and when ultimately full.> determined will constit:1te an extensiYe Reries of well-established second order J)()ints, which "-ill 11oubtless prom of great ralue in connection with tlte execution of subsicliar.r sur\·eys. lucluded in the hn>sometric work at Ogden P~ak, were included uot only all the primary and secoudar,y points, btH likewise tl.Je permanent bench-marks which had been established at Ogden Obscrrntor,v and ti.Jc public square of HuntsYil!e. Tliese bencl.i-ruarks were snb1Sequeutly connected with ti.Je triangulation, and the observatory hench-rnark Yrns referred by spirit-leveling to the railway levels at Ogden. All primary zenith distances determined were made to depend upon obsern t ions tak.Pn lluring the miclille. part of the ua;1-, or the hours of least refraction, for ten da;n.; or mort>.

For latitude, twenty-three pairs of stars were ouserved on six different nights, special regard ·being paid in the selection of the stars to the accuracy of determination of their rnean places. For azimuth, satisfactory observations were obtained on firn different days on Polaris near its eastern and western elongations in the same twenty-three positiom; of the tlleodolite used in observations of horizontal directions. J\lr. Eimbeck remarks that the plan of obser·ing a single clost> circumpolar star in opposite positions of its path, which with the larger instruments may be cor1Yenientl~· done by distributing the observations ennl~· over the early morning and late e\eniug hours, admits of great expedition, aud assures a final result for azimuth which is <'esentially free from the effects of the slight errors with wltich the tabular co-ordinates of these stars are usually affected. Tbe maguetic station, established within about thirty metres of ttrn triaugulation station, wa~ occupied o~ fh·e different days, and acceptnhle rPsults were obtained for declination, dip, an<l intensity, the line of true north being specially determinecl hy observation;; of the sun. At the end of October the instruments and camp equipages were co1ffeye<l down the mountain, transferred to Salt Lake City, and there stored for the winter. Mr. Eimbeck then disbanded his party, retaining only suclt help as was needed to run a line of le,·els of precision, of about ten miles in length, for the purpose of connecting the bench-mark "estal1lished last year at Hooper. near the shore of Great Salt Lake, with the transcontiueutal railway le'vels at Ogden, and thus obtaining a first approximate cbeck on the bypsometric work of the triangulation as brought eastward from the Pacific coast, a distance of nearly six lmndred miles. The Hooper beuch-mark ltaYing been referred to a similar permanent bench-mark at Grauts,ille, "Utah, by means of tbe lenl of the lake, all(} the Grantsville bench referred trigo_nornetricall~· to the triangulation station at Mount Deserel:, this central statio11 of the great quadrilateral, Pilot Peak-lbapah-.'.\fount NeboOgdeu Peak, stands connected with the transcontinental railroad le\els at Ogden Cit~-. Perinanent bench-marks for future reference and ultimate connection with the transcontinental line of precise le,eling were establisl1ed upon the abutment pier;; of the iron bridge of the "Utah Central Railway across Weber River, near Ogden. The field work of the season was brought to a ronclnsio11 finally by connecting trigonometrically the telegraphic longit1rde stations of the Survey at Ogden antl at Salt Lake with the main triangulation, and by establishing a. meridian line within the grounds of the De~(·ret. Uniw·rsity at Salt Lake City. ThiR line was laid down at the request of the Surveyor GPnera1 of Utall, with the appi:oval of the Superintendent, the cost of labor and material beiug defn1ye1l hy the Surveyor. General. Owing to the character of itR site and surronndiugs it will be well adaptetl for testing the surYeyors' compasses used in the GoYernment land s1irYeys. · l\Ir. Eimbeck acknowledges the Yery accepta1Jlc and faithful aid receive<l from Subassii:;tants Taney and Turner, particularly the latter. l\Ir. Turner, at the close of tlJe season, proceede1l under instructions to San Francisco~ and was suluiequently ordered to tal~e charge of one of the parties ·fitting out for the Alask~i Boundary Snn·ey. During the winter Mr. Eimbeck was engaged at the oftice in \Yasbingto11, D. C., in the reduct.ion and discussion of the results of his season's work, with the aid of Suba1'sistaJJt Isaac \Yinston. In the spring he was instructed to make preparations for resuming fiehl work in Ftah. Tllese instructions contemplated the closing of the great quadrilateral by the occupation of stations Pilot Peak and Ibapah. In pursuance of this dut.v, he left Vf ashiugton, May 17, and upon arrinl at Salt Lake made arrangements for the transfer of his instruments and camp.equipage to TPcoma, a station on the Central Pacific Railroad, about tllirty-fi,-e miles north of Pilot Peak. From Tecoma, the location and construction of roads and a pack-trail to tlw >1ummit of the Peak, an ele\·ation of about ten thousand nine hundred feet, occupied the party till the end of the fisca,l year. The unusually ro,cky aud inaccessible character of the Peak presented formidable olJstacles to rapid progress. Further account of Mr. I~imbeck's work will appear in tl!c next Aunual Report. Determinations of the ma_qnetic cleme11ts at stations in Colorado and Nc1ic Jfc.rico.-Thrre statiolls in Colorado and four iu :New Mexico were occupied by Assistant Jas. U.

REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF OFFICE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE :30, 188f~.
U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFif'E, Washington, D. C.~ October 17, 1880.

Sm: I have the honor t.o submit my Annual Report for the Office for the fit:cal ~-ear ending June 30, 1889, and along with it the reports of the various divisions thereof submitted by their respective chiefs, as follows: The Computing Division, by Assistant C. A. Schott. The Drawing Division, by A.ssistant W. H. Dennis. The Engraving Division, by Assistant H. G. Ogden. The Instrument Division, by Assistant A. Braid. Tile Tidal Division, b;y Mr. A. S. Christie. The Miscellaneous Dh·ision, by Genel'al Office Assistant .'.\I. W. \Vines. The Ohart Division, by Assistant G. Bradford. 'rhc Archivl'.s and fobmry, b~· l\fr. A. Martin. The Accounting Division, by l\fr. J. "''· Par:>ons. The \Veights and Measures Division, by Assistant. 0. fl. Tittmanu. \Ve have continued to aclvance the interests of the pnblic sen·ice b~· promoting the efficiency of the :::;nney in such directions as practicable. Thepnblic itself has quicklj· felt this, as imli· cated by the grea.ter demand for our charts and other publication;;, and the increased calls for these ham necessitated more labor, both skilled and unskilled, to supply the demand. In the item of charts deliYered to our agents, which has increased by two thousand four lrnmlred and three l'l1eets, I estimate that there would have been an increase of three thousand fivt>·hnndrP<l sheets at least, had we been able to print the charts as rapidly as they were ealled for. Our plate printers and their helpers were denied leave of absence and worked full h0tm1 throughout the summer months, aud we started an additional press 011 contract work, but we fell bel1ind steadily during the summer, that being the season in which there is ge11emlly the greatest demand for our chart;;. Along with increased proficiency aml business comes increased labol' of all kinds, arnl the office has 11ow about reacbed the limit of its capacity with the present force. The uumber of letters written and press.copied at the Office, including all t>Xcept the Hytlrographie Inspector's correspondei1ce, was nineteen thousand sernn hundred and five during tbe fiscal ~-ear, or sixty-three for every day on which the -..!ffice was open for the tramuction of lmsi11ess. O\er ffre-h11111lre1l of these were pre1·ared in furnishing specific information called for by parties ontside of the Surn\v, i11formation which was in onr possession but not published; the preparation of these letters consumed a considerable part of the time of some of our best men, for being on technical questions, they could not be replieu to in a merely clerical manner.

.A.\thongh >Ve have ma(h· 1'ome progre8S in bringing up the bac11: work for publication, there remain<: a large amount of \"aluable material, such as magnetic, tidal, current, liy(lographic, topographic aml geo(letic information, that has l>een gathered with muc!J paius aml expense auu that we an· 11nablc to preseu t to the pnblic for want of ::;killed lJelp. To enable us to utilizfl it., additiou:il computers, tlraughtsmeu, engra>ers, printers, mechanicians, laborers, and writers are urgently needed, au<l ior them <t(ldi tional room i:-; required, as well aR for storage of ,-alnahle matter l.Jelouging to the Snryey. I then·fnre re('.omme1Hl the procuring, hs rent or pnrdiase, at least the middle hcH1~·· of the Butler Building ant! the whole of the space of the bri<'k l>nildingR in its rear now use1l as ollitl'"TliP 01liei· of Construction of Standard \Yeights and Measures is rapidly adrnncing iu proficil!1w~- .rnd n,;efnluess. In order to compare the Standards belonging to the SurYey and the base bars nsetl iu measuring its geode,,ic bases tlie Office constructe·l a comparing room in o.ne of the large .-anlts nudt·r the 1nn-emeI1t"in front of the Bichards Building. It giYes satisfactory results awl wil\ be fully described in a subsequent paper . .A 1 >i~hnrsing Agent is uadly nee<lcrl for the Survey. l\f r. Geo. A. Bartlett, the Disbursing Olerk of theTn~asnr~-. upon whom the dnt,Y of disbursi11gfo1· the Sun·e.r is now placed, is uniformly courteous arnl obliging, hut it is a great inconvenience to us, arnl especially to our field parties, to ha Ye hinuw far awa,\· from tl1c Office, aml I respectfully recommend the designation of some one in the employ of the Survey to disuurse for it. The form of the present appropriation for the maintenance of the Office force is too rigid and 11ee1ls remo1leling. .A8 matters now stand there is uo oppurtnuity to adjust the salaries to the indi Yitluals except through the action of Congress in the appropriation bills, or by resignations, deaths, awl dismissals occurring from time to time. These means of adjustmeut are ent.irel.r too slow to be eftt·ctive. Tht> most gratifyiug occmTence of the year bas been the iinal };ettlement of tho accounts of our late Di::;lmrsing .Agent, l\lr. \'.'. B. l\lorg'.lll. The many thousands of dollars at first disallowed in his accounts were rcRtored from time to time, after a most tltorough examination in each case, until the amount was reduced to the small sum of $433.64; on reacl.1ing this point the Hon. C. 8. Fairchild, Secretary of the Treasury, 1 e-instate<l .M.r. l\Iorgan asi)islrnrsing .Agent, to date from July 24, 1885, granted him 30 <lays' lea,·e of absence with full pay, and accepted his resignation when the leave expired. This was not only a triumph for Mr. Morgan hut more, for it was a vindication of the Sun·ey as a body, after it had be~'ll most soreJ:; tried and cruelly persecuted for three and a half years. · During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889, the following named persons were employed under my immediate direction: Dr. Wm. B. Frencl1 has continued as heretofore to act as my immediate assistant in matters of executin detail, to recPirn and account to me for all moneys from sales of charts, publications, -old property, and other sources. He bas aided in tlle Office correspondence, received all Office bills,

COMPUTING DIVISION, COAS'l' AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

June 29, 1889. DEAR Sm: In conformity with regulations, I have the honor to submit herewith the usual annual report of work done by t:he computers aml cop)·ists of this Divisiou during the fiscal year ending .Jone 30, 18S9. Tlte charge of the Computing DiYision was eontinued with the undersigned. The only change in the personnel was the transfer of Mr. F. l\I. I,ittle to tlle Tidal Didsion on December 1, 1888, and the filling of the place on the same day by Mr. J. Page, who, after having served satisfactorily (lnring a six mouths prohationar:r term, was giYen an absolute appointment in tliis DiYision. Longitmlt> computations were temporarily provided for by assigning Assistant E. Smith to duty in this Division 011 November 2, 1888, and assistance was rendered by Mr. N. Bryant, as copyist, between ,Jul~· 6, 1888, and .January 22, 1889. The present force of computers is too weak to take up and complete the reduction of the magnetic record8 at Key West, J<'la. (1860-'06), and at l\fadison, Wis. (I87G-'.'-\l), a1ul to commence the reduction and discussion of the observations at the magnetic ohsen-atory at Los Angeles, Cal. (1882-'89), 11ow about. to be transferred to San Antonio, Tex. Competent temporary help woulcl he highly desirable, if no permanent con1puter can he provided. Besides directing, distrihnting, super..-ising, and reporting the work performeu by each com· pnter, matter,; relating to ofticial correspondence, professional or scientific, were promptly attended to. Among the nnmPron!l report!l made hy me, the following may he specially mentioned as requirin~ morP than nsual labor in their preparation: Uesults of spirit-leveling betweeu Arkansas City and Little Rock, Ark.,.1S87-'88; Hesults of spirit-Je,·cling between l\Iobile, Ala., and Okoloua, Miss., 11'.184-'Sfi-'Si; A supplement to report on spirit-iernls, Yiciuity of New York, relating to hydrologicn! prohl(·llls in New York Bay and Harbor; Paper on the geographical positions in the State of Counecticnt, determined by tri:tngnlatiou (uniform with a Rimilar paper for MassachuRetts and Rhode falaml, in Coast and Geodetic Surwy Report for 1885, Appendix No. 8); Report on SJliritlfweling betmwn Annapolis, l\fd., an<l \Yasbiugtou, D. C., 187.'i; Report on the adju~tment of the primary triangnlation of West Virginia (1878-'81); Ueport on tlle adjustment of tlrn American Bottom base figure (Illinois and Missouri); Heport on the adjustment of the Olney base figure; Illinois, and incorporation of the Lake Survey base into the Coast and Geodeti~ Snn·ey transcon· tinental triangulation (this involved the solution of thirt~--two equations, with as many unknown quautities); Report on the adjustment of the primary triangulation between tbe American-Bottom

base and the Olney base (this invoh·ed the solution of thirty-three equations, with as mau.v unknown quantitiesj; A series of reports on resulting telegraphic longitudes during the years 1885 allll 1886, and oue on the longitude of '.\fount Hamilton, California (Lick Ob:servator.r). 1888, and a joint report 'by myself and Assistant 0. H. Tittmann on the relation of the metric units of length of the United States Lake Survey and the Ooast and Geodetic Survey. I also found time to compute the astronomical azimuths at Hart, Fla., 1885; Sloop Point, North Carolina, 1SS8, and Bridgeport, Fla., 1885; prepared drafts of instructions, astronomic, geodetic, an<l magnet.ic, for the party or parties to make a preliminary survey of the soutlleastl·rn bouudary of Alaska; and of instructions, astronomic, for the Yukon U.iver and Porcupine River parties to locate the one hundred and forty-first degree of west longitude; also advanced the discussion of the secular variation of the magnetic de.clination, and collected and arrangell by States and by latitude the maguetic declinations at three tl:wusaml two hundred stations, preparatory to the construction of a new isogonic map for the United Stlltes for the epoch 1890. Professional testimony was given for the District of Columbia in a suit involving the precise location of the Kidwell Meadows. Proof:reading and annual statistics were atteudell to, as well as the examination of the astronomical, geodetic, and magnetic surrny records for completeness; and the nuips aral charts of the Survey were supplied witll the magnetic declinations and other information. On Augllst 23, 1888, I was appointed by tlie Cidl Service Commission a member of the Board of Examiners for computers, and on June 28, 1889, on the Boanl of Ex:aminers for astronomy. Tile duties couuected with these positious were faithfully discharged. The work }lerformed by each computer during the fiscal year is herewith presented in detail, irnd is made up from the daily and rnonthl,y reports. Edward ll. Oourtenay completed the final adjustment of the triangulations in the State of Connecticut between 1833 and 188G, inclusive, an<l supen·ised the manuitcript copy of the results made for the printer (the number of geographical positious is eight hundred and seventeen); adjusted and placed on uniform data the tertiary triangulation of the western coast of Florida between Charlotte llaruor and Pensacola Bay, developing the same on the surface of the Clarke spheroid; prepared the abstrncts of angles and horizontal directions at primary stations in the vicinity of St. Louis, l\fo., 1871 to lSSO; made satisfactory progress with the final adjustment of tbe triangulations of the State of New York ; supervised tile work of Mr. J. B. Boutelle, aml su pplietl in part that for ~\Ir. 0. H. Kummell; directeu the work of Mr. vV. U. Maupin, and arranged thirty Yolumes of manuscl'ipt computations for IJiuding. J\fr. Courtenay also had charge of the geograp.hical registers of the office; assisted in preparing data for field parties and collecting geodetic information needed in connection with the general conesi1ondence of the office; had charge of the duplicate records-astronomical, geodetic, and magnetic-of the Suryey; took charge of the Uompnting Di vision during my brief absence, and assisted in the preparation of the annual statistics for Superintendent's report. Myrick H. Doolittle, after returning from leave of absence of two ancl a half months, computed the tertiary triangulation of the coast of I,ouisiana between Calcasieu I,igbt and Vermillion Bay, 1884-'85-'86; adjusterl the coast. triauglllation between Cedar Ke.rs arn1 St. Blas, Fla., and com· pllted some supplementary triangulation and a base measured iu North Carolina in 1888. l\lr. Doolittle then took up the station adjustment of horizon ta! directions of the tri:rngulatiou in Illinois anll ,Indiana between 1880 and 1887, inclusive; adjustml the base figure introducing the American Bottom base, Illinois and Missouri, into the main triangulation; also the hase figure incorporating the Lake Sun·ey or Olney base, Illinois, into the Coast and Geodetic Survey work, the one computation involving tliirty-two, the other thirty-three, comlitions to be satisfied; adjusted the second figure of the main triangulation of West Virginia and that part of the transcontinental triaugulation lying between the American Rottom and tl!e Olney base, Illinois, involving thirty.three conditions to be satisfied; made satisfactory progress with the local adjustment of horizontal <lirectiomi at primary stations in Ohio ancl Kentucky, 1883-'87, and assisted in the preparation of the annual · statistics. Charles H. Kummell was cbiefiy engaged on the solution of equations in connection with thf' adjustment of the triangulations of Connecticut; attended to geodetic revisions and check readings; computed the tertiary triangulation coast of Louisiana and of Sabine Pass, and the supple·

STATES COAST AND GEODETlC STJRVKL

The engravers were employed during the year principally as follows: H. M. Knight, A. Petersen, J. G. Tbompson, and R. F. Bartle, jr., on lettering; H. T. Knight and H. L. Thompson on outlines and lettering; \V. A. Thompson, R. F. Bartle, and H. C. Ernns on topography and sand; Joseph Enthoffer and E. J. Entboffer on topography; E. H. Sipe on miscellaneous corrections and letteriug, and T. \Yasserbacb and \V. H. Davis on miscellaneous corrections and additions. There ha>e also been employed at oifferent times during the year, under the appropriations for extra engra.-ing, J.P. Cox and J. C. Entwistle on lettering and E. J. Eutho:ffer on topography. On October 5, 1888, the force of the Dirisiou was increased by the employment of Messrs. William A. Yan Doren, E. A. Kubel, A.H. Sefton, and J. S. Carman, in conformity with the prm·isious of tl:e appropriation act. Three of these ;young gentlemen had recei>ed a little instruction in the art before acceptiug employment in the Office, but it is most pleasiug for me to be able to report that . all of them ba-ve dernloped a talent for their work that promises most satisfactory results iu the future. Their progress is already so marked that I have employed three of th1-1m on certain classes of work, aIHl the fourth has adrnuced to the point when bis services will also be a\·ailable. I fully antici1iate that the product of these young gentlemen's labors duriug the coming ;year will show a material increase iu the completion of engra>ings. Allot' tlte t>ngnwers baYe been employed at different times during the year on the miscellane-ons corrrctions and additions required on the printing plates, arising from changes in aids to na>i· -gation, etc. This is a class of work that is very exacting, as it does not admit of material delay, .audit must take precedence oYer the production of original matter, for the reason that the published ceharts should lJe maintained as nearly correct as our information \Vill permit. So great is the volume of this class of work that its consideration is one of prime importance; on se>eral occasions nearly eYery engraver in the Office bas been eugagell upon it at the same time, 9ausiug the stoppage -0f uearl~· all origiual work and consequent delay in the prOlluction of new charts urg_ently demanded. Nor does the volume seem to decrease. Of the sm·en hundred and nine~y-two plates printed during the year 84.0 per cent. required correction; for the preeeding year six hundred and sixt,y-four plates ·were priutell, of wbich 83.8 per cent. required correction; this shows the percentage of plates lll'inted ·that required correction about the same for each year, but there were actually one hundred and thirteeu more plates corrected in 1889 than in 1888, an increase of 20 per cent. It should be -observed, however, that the labor inYolYed in correcting this larger number of plates was only 142 per ceut. greater than in the preceding year, showing that the average corrections to a single plate were less than for the year before. This class of work consumed the time of four engra>ers during the year, agaiust an a>erage of three and a half for a number of preceding years. This subject was brought to the· attention of the late Superintendent three years ago, when a prorision to reduce the force of engravers had been introduced into the appropriation bill for tlie support of the Survey. Careful estimates made at that time indicated that when the scheme of charts for the coasts sboulJ be completed the whole force of engravers employed in the Office would be required to maintain the plates in condition for printing. Later experience has satisfied me that this estimate can not be modified and may have to be increased. I would also recall to you the reference made to this subject in my Annual Report for 1887. During the past year considerable increase was made to the product, by the work obtained in "extrn engraving'' paid for .out of the deficiency bills for the fiscal years 1888 aud 1889. The deficiency for 1888 became available only three months before the clQse of th~ year and, therefore, did not essentially affect the product of that year, but many engravings were so materially advanced by the expenditure that I was enabled to finish a larger number of plates in the past ~·ear than during any year of which I have record. These deficiency bills and the addition of the four young men to the force of engravers last October, ha>e been the only measures of assistance furnished to thii> Division in many years; and it should be 'observed that the increased force pEo>ided last year will ha>e no appreciable effect upon the work of the Division until the current year. The numerous corrections applied to the printing plates have a deleterious effect upon the plates, causing the engravings to wear more rapidly and 11ecessitate tlleir more frequent reproi'.luction by electrot.}ping, and as nearly erery aorrection made <luring the life of a plate must be applied to the electrotJ·pe copy made from the preserved Alto, it is evi<lent that the reproduc tion of a printing }llate ma~· be a work of consi~erable labor. These reproductions also require the

UN'lTED STATES COAST AND GBODETIU SGlWEY.

135

·work of skilled e11gravers, as the changes i1ffolved may 11ec~ssitate matching many Yarieties in style of engm,·ing. The making of new printing plates bas been almost sus1wnded during tlie year in the effort to supply what have been considered more important demands, but it is essential such labor should be resumed at an early date if the utility and appearance of the charts is to be preserve<l. In Yiew of the circnmstances tl.rns hriedy outlined I l10pe the recommendation· to · iucrease the force of the Di\·ision will meet with your appronil. The year's work bas H<lded a nnmlwr of i111portant charts to the Catalogue; among them the Henernl Coast Chart from Tampa Bay to Cape Sau Blas, Florida; the Coast Charts from Little Hiver to Petit 1\fanau, l\Iaine, a preliminary edition of Biock Island Sound, the Yicinity of Cape Lookout Shoals and approacbes to Beaufort Entrance, Xorth Carolina, Anclote Anchorage and the Banks to the north ward, Florida; new sailing· charts of the Pacific coast from San Diego to the Strait of Juan de Fnca, aud the harbor chart of Sau Pedro Bay, California. Work was commenced during tbe year on a 11ew series of sailing charts of the Atlautic coast. aml the Coast Charts of Long lslaud Sound showi11g the n·1mlti; of the· resmTe.r recently completed; steady progress was also made on the new edition of the cbait of Xew York Harbor, from the recent resnrve~·, which is now aho11t ready for publication. The work of the Electrotype and Photograph Hooms has been continued under l\1r. U. C. Chapman, assisted by .J\Ir. L. P. Keyser. The weight of copper deposited was 23 per cent. greater than last year; this increase was due entire!~· to the greater nulllher of plates required for our own use during the year, 110 outside electrotyping having been done. Rxpcrimcnts have been made by l\lr. Chapman during the past six months with a Yiew to securing a hard electro-deposit that might be substituted for liammered copper; lie lias been iu a measure successful, but tlie limited time he can devote to i:;nch experiment:::; and the difficulties to lie owrcome render the progress Yery slow. As the ordinary galvanometers we have heretofore bad in use with our batteries lrnve !Jeen found practically valueless for the measmeme11t of sucl1 large currents with small electro-motive force as are de1·eloped under the conditions of our work, l\Ir. Chapman Las devised and constrncted a new and simple form of ga1Ya110meter that seems to meet our rl'(}Uirements. Experiments are now being made with this instrument that I hope will prove of rnlne for this class of w~rk. The system of mounting photograph reductions to scale introduced three ~·ears .ago, is proving more valuable with each. new experience; it has been found practicable to presene the cnr¥ature of .the projections in reducing to small scales, and as perfect a reduction can now be made from a printed chart with. distorted projection as could formrrly be procnretl from an accurate drawing. The- servi<li!s of Mr. L. P. Keyser, the assistant in the Electrotyping Rooms, have been very satisfactory and I earnestly call your attention to the injustice of the small appropriation provided in compensation for his labor. The Printing Office has been conducted as heretofore under the immediate supervision of Mr. F. Moore, foreman, assisted by Messrs Hoover, Beck, and Crawford, printers, and Troutman and Dickson helpers. The capacity of the Office has been taxed to the utmost during the year, and 'notwithstanding the increased exertions of the printers and the emplo;rment of an extra press during the autumn of 1888 and the early summer of 1889, the work has been almost continually behiud the demand. The fiscal year 1887 showed a falling off in the printing for the Chart Room, but the ·demand bas been steadily increasing since then until it now exceeds our ability to meet it. I there. fore hope the project to apply power to the presses, that 11as been under consideration for nearly two years, may .be carried out during the coming year; but it is now desirable that an additional force .and two more presses should also be supplied as it is evillent we shall have abundaut work for them by the time they can be in position for use. I brought this matte1· to your attention in m;r last annual report, !mt the dema.ud ·1ia8 so far exceeded my expectations tliat I must 1101'; urge upou .you the immediate necessity of increased facilities. The clerical work of the Division, as heretofore tluri ng ma11y ye~rs, bas been most satisfactorily performed by Mr. John H. Smoot. He is indefatigable in his labor, but the large increase in the details of the work caused by the _greater demand for charts, has been a seriot1s hindrance to his more importaut duties of proof reading and .verification, and cons.ide1·ing the probable additional work that will be required in the coming year I feel it necessarJ' I should recommend to you :the assignment to the Division of an additional book-keeper at the earliest practicable date.

The increase in the work of the ~ivision a111l the proposed additions to the force of experts employed, will also bring demands upon the messengers as..;igned to the Division beyond the probability of tileir supplying them. 'fLe Di vision has been fortunate in having two good steady men to fill these places, but for the reasons stated they must barn help in the future and I have therefore rPeornmended in my estimates the employment of two additional messengers. The customar_y list of chart plates completed, commenced, and in progress during tbe year is submitted herewith . .£ours, very respectfully, HERBERT G. OGDEN, Assi.stant U. S.

REPORT OF THE ISSTflUJIEST Dff!S[(IS, COAST A.SD GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, FO.R THE FISCAL YE.:lR ESDLYG J['SE ao, lf.1'39.

U. S. COAS1' AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, Washington, D. C., August 17, 1889. DEAR Srn : I ha"°e the honor to Stlbmit the following report of the Instrument Division for the tiscal year emling- June 30, 1889. No clrnuge has been made in the force employed in the Divisiou siuce the date of my last report, and as heretofore the chief mechaniciau, Mr. E. G. Fischer, lias exercised personal supervision o>er the details of the work iu the instrument shop and Mr. H. 0. ·Frencl1 has ha(l the immediate charge of the work of .the carpenter shop. Both of these gentlemen ha\'e performed their {luties in a highly satisfactory manner. The usual large amount of repairing work has been attended to, and a considerable quantity of new work (in view of onr limited force), has lJeen accomplished. I take occasion in this connection to n·u£w my recommendation of last year that two additional mechanicians be estimated for. As theu 15tated, a large nnmher of new instruments will soon be required to replace those which li<ffe become obsolt>te or worn out, and our present force, a portion of which must be constantly engaged in repairing work, is too small to meet this demand. A cuusidernbly larger force could be aclYantageously employed for some time, but unfortunately our limited sllop space 1necludes the employment of a greater additional number than that recom. nw ml ed. 'l'he instrnment-shop equipment has been farther improved by the addition of a circular-saw lJenclt and a gear cutting attachment for one of the large lathes. The gear-cutter and saw bench and ><undry minor tools haYe been made in our own shop. The following is a list of new instruments made or partly made during the year, and of olrl instruments rem0<1eled:

The Steinbeil heliotropes anrl. the plane-table alidades were well advanced towa1d completion during the prevfousfiscal ;year and were finished in July, 1888, and September, 1888, respecth-ely. The weights and measures comparator, the plane table and the six theodolites are not yet completed, but will all be finished before the end of October, 1889. The theodolites are "repeatn"" and it is believed will prove superior instruments. The essential parts have been made by our bPl't mechanicians and special care has been takeu to secure tbe greatest possible degree of accuracy. 'fhe horizontal circles are eight inches in diameter, and will be graduated to five minutes, reading by three verniers to fi\'e seconrls. The inner centers are made of bell-metal, aud t!Je otheri'l of "half-hard" brass, ~hile the outer shells arc made of ordinary "red metal." The nse of steel for centers was not permissible, as each instrument is furnished with an attachment for the api1roximats determination of magnetic declination. The telescope axes are perforated for axis illumination, thus aLlapting tlle instruments for azimuth determination and nigbt observation of horizontal angles. Three of the theodolites have standards high enough to permit of the trausiting of the telescopes, and arc furnished with eye-piece micrometers aud vertical circles. The micrometers are revolvable ninety degrees, arnl can therefore be used vertically or horizoutally, and the vertical circles (graduated to ten minutes, and reading by two verniers to teu seconds) ean be nsed either for ordinary vertical angle meaflurements or for latitude determinations. Eaell circle has, of course, a delicate level attached for the latter purpose. The telescopes of three of the instruments haYe focal lengths of sixteen inches, and clt>ar apertures of two i11ches, and are furnished with two eye-pieces haviug equi,·alent focal le11gtLs of three-fourths inch and three-eighths inch respectively. Tbe ot!Jer three (the alt-azimuth im;trnments) have telescopes fifteen inches in focal length and two incl.Jes in clear aperture, and an· fornished with three eye-pieces having equivalent focal lengths of three-fourths inch, three-eighth~ inch, a,ml thirty-tiYe one-hundredths inch (the latter a diagonal eye piece). The cost of these instruments, an<l of others named in tL e foregoing list, notwithstanding the shorter hours of Government shops, will fall withiu the price at which similiar instruments could lJe purchased. The miscellaneous duties of the Division, including the care of the instruments, camp equipage and general property, the rer.eipts and shipments of the samei the examination and adjustment of instruments and determination of instrumental constants, the purchase of new instruments and supplies, the official correspondence and the keeping of the records and im·entories, etc., ha-rn recefred due attention. The following statement shows in detail the force emplosed during the :year and the character of the work J>erformed by each Jlerson : Mr. E.G. Fischer, as already mentioned, bas performed the duties of chief mechanician, ma<lP working drawings for the use of the pattern makers and mechanicianl'I, and attended to the di \"iding engine, making such graduations and regraduat?ons as were required for sextants, theodolites. and protractors. Mr. E. Eshleman served during the entire year, and was engaged upon the adjustment of instruments and miscellaneous repairs of plane tal>les, alidades, tlieodolites, levels, dip·circles, magnetometers, protractors, transits, meridian telescopes, zenith telescopes, artificial horizons, beliotropes, vertical circles, level rods, etc. He has also attended to the ruling of glass diaphragms and the silvering of sextant and heliotrope mirrors, and has made 88 uew letter ranges. Mr. L. A. Fischer served during the entire year, and bas been engaged chiefl~- upon n.ew instruments. He has worked upon the 1~ new ali<lades, made the uew gear cutter, the sounding register, 1 metric scale, 6 reducing frames, the teleMopes, micrometers, and vertical circles for the new theodolites, and sundry taps and dies and shop tools. He bas also attended to some miscellaneous repairs of alidades, sounding registers, letter gauges, and comparators, and onrbauled and repaired the tide-predicting machiue. The ohl base-bar comparators Nos. III and IV were practically reconstructed by Mr. Fischer, although the work is properly classed as repairing work. "Mr. P. Vierbnchen ser\·e1l during tile entire year, and has been engaged upon mi8cella11cous repairs of sextants, protraetors, theodolites, levels, tide gauges, reconnoitering telescopes, binoculars, h~liotropes, sllips' compasses, station transits, zenith telescopes, plane tables, alidades, tele-

TI'a87tingto11, D. C., June 30, JS~H. Sm: I have the honor to submit uerewitb the report of this Di \·isiou for the fiscal year t>ndi ng une ao, 1889. The work accomplishe(l tin ring the year may be sum rnarized as follow,;: 1. An aggregate of three years eleven months of record from automatic tide-gauges, with tLe accompanying tabulations of half-hourly ordinates, high and low waters, temperature and tleusity of the sea, and meteorological data, aud one hundred aud se\·enty-one original aml one Lundred aud sixty-two duplicate volumes of observations on staff arnl t>ox: gauges, ha Ye been received, examined, and registered, and two hundred and thirty-seven letters prepared. 2. The 'ride Tables for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for the year 18BO, two >olumes large octavo, ha,·e been prepared an'1 the greater part of the n>lnme for the Atlantic coast read allll differenced in proof. The page has been enlarged to admit of the intro1iLiction of atlditional 1lescriptions of dat11 rele.ting to tides, ti.Jal current,.,, aud the Ya riation oft lie compass. The ,·olnme for the Atlantic coast has heen extended to the east coai'\t of British .America as far as the Strait of Belle I:sle by the iutro1luction of constants for two hundred and six subordinate station" iu tlio:<c· waters. The volume for the Pacific coast has l)ee11 ill like ma1111er made to include the we:,;t coa~t of British America by the introtlnction of constants for eighty.flrn sulwrdinate statious i11 Britbl1 Columbia. The mun her of stations in Alaska has heen i11cre:ise1l from twenty two to thirt,v-threl'. and fnll predictions made for Sitka and Kad iak rslanll as principal statious for the first time. 3. Tide notes have been preparell for an aggregate of eighty-three stations for 1mblicatiou 011 forty-one charts, am! for thirty-five stations for publication in the Coast Pilot. 4. Oue hmHfred and thirteeu descriptions of tidal l>eucli-marks with hl'ights above the pla11" of reference, au.I other tidal dat<}, have been prepared and furuisherl for the use of field parties, ia response to thirty three requisitions. 5. Tidal information, including thirty-six descriptions of bench-marks, has been prepared and furnished in reply to twenty-nine calls from persons not connected wit!J the 8un·ey. 6. The hfrmonic relluction of the tidal ohsen·ations for the years 1887 and 1888 at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, bas been commenced and that of tbe tidal obsen·ations for the ;year 1885-'86 at Kadiak Island, Alaska, iwactically finished. 7. Non-harmonic'' first. reductions" ha Ye been made of two hundred and twenty-two short series, aggregating about seventeen years of continuous obserYations, and '' second re<luctions '' at sixty-five stations. · The following is a statement of the general character of the work of each clerk . Mr. L. P. Shidy hfts Leen engagt~ll upon almost e\'ery descriptiou of our work-first and secoml reductions, the preparation of tide notes anll descriptions of bench-marks, the collection of data for the Tide Tables, the differencing of the Tide Tables and the.ir revision in proof,&c. As heretofore I have dependeu largely upon M.r. Shidy for the elimination of error from the work of the other clerks. I rncommeud that l\fr. Shidy's salary he increased from $1,500 to at least $1,600 per
anunm.

Mr. J. W. Whitaker made the major part of the predictions with the macliiue for the year 1890, read proof, assisted in the 1>reparation of data, made a large number of 11011-harmouic reduc· tions, and bas commenced the harmonic reduction of the obserrntions for the year 188i at &.rndy Hook, New .Jersey.

::\Irs. Virginia Harrison made a large number of non-harmonic reductions, predicted from curves for Philadelphia and Baltimore for 1890, differenced predictions, copied the major part of the predictions for 1890, read and differenced proof, copied sketches and descriptions of benchmarks, and assisted on harmonic analyses. ::\Irs. M. E. Nesbitt made a large nUinber of non-harmonic reductions, pred.icted for Philadelphia, Baltimore, aucl Sitka for 1890 from curves, computed diurnal :md semi-diurnal tides at Kadiak Island, computed predictions of daily ranges for 1890, read, 11ifferenced, and revised predictions in manuscript and proof, and worked on harmonic analyses. Mrs. Nesbitt produces a large quantity of computation reasonably free from error, and I recommend that her salary be increased from $720 to $900 per annum. l\fr. F. ::\I. Little, transferred to this Di,·ision December 1, made non-harmonic reductions, differenced and revised the predictions for 1890 in manuscript and in proof, assisted in the preparation of data for the 'fide Table~ and in response to rcqnisitio1is, and has commenced the hannonic analysis of the observations for the year 1888 at Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Mr. Little has made commendable progress iu acquiriug a knowledge of tidal work . .Hr. John F. Hayford, recently selectwl umler Ci\·il Service rules by competitive examination and since graduated with tlie degree of civil engineer from the department of civil engineering of Uornell University, was attaehPd to this Didsion June 22, the date of his appointment as a computer int his Office. l\Ir. Ha,rfonl's first week in this Di vision has demonstrated his peculiar fituess for our work. Ile i-; a ;po1l m tthema,tician, with a practical turn, is possessed of a good judgment, con1putes somewhat rapidly and with no error which I have been able to discover, and finds the otl:icial tlay rather short. I recommend that he be permanently appointed with the full salary appropriated, to date from August 1 proximo. Mr. David E. Sueatl was under instruction in this Division September 10 to 17, preparatory to takiuf.! charge of tlie Sa111ly Hook tidal station. l\Ir. J. G. Spaulding was under instruction in this Division from February 23 to March 12, pre· paratory to proceeding to Savannah Entrance to establish a permanent tidal station. The cl.Jarge of this Didsion was continued with tlle undersigned throughont the ~'ear. In addition to the usual duties of distribution, supervision, and revision of work, preparation of the Tide Tables, data to fill requisitions, and attending to the correspondence, I have given special attention to a collation, comparison, and adjustment of all tidal data accessible and available relating to the Atlantic coast from the Strait of Belle Isle to Biloxi, and to the Pacific coast from Southern California to the Aleutian Islands, and the introduction of the results info the Tide Tables for 1890.

REPORT OF THE CHA.RT DIVISION, COAST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, FOR THE FISCAL YE.4.R ENDING JUNE 30, 1889.

U. S. COAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY OFFICE,

TYashington, July 1, 1839. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report of tbe Chart Di vision for the year ending June 30, 1889: I took charge of this Division on the 1st of May, relieving Assistant W. Dennis, who was transferred to the charge of the Drawing Division. Consequently, this report includes the work of the Division for ten months under Mr. Dennis and for two months under myself. As a matter of convenience I report on the whole. The general scope of the work of the Division has been the same as during the previous year. Seven employes have continued in the Division during the year. The special duty of each was: Mr. J. H. Barker, correcting charts; Mr. A. Upperman, cor· recting charts; Mr. J. L. Smith, receiving and stamping charts, printing, etc.; Miss L.A. Mapes, book-keeping, coloring buoys, etc.; Miss Mary Thomas, coloring lights and buoys; Miss Sophie Hein, coloring light-sectors, etc., and correcting charts; Mrs. Jennie Fitch, coloring lights and buoys, and correcting catalogues. Mr. Hugo G. Eichholtz worked in the Division until Lis death on June 18. His duty was issuing charts. I knew Mr. Eichholtz only a short time, but can testify tlrnt he was a faithful and couscientious man. He was much loved in the Surycy, where his long serdce had made him well known, and is much regretted. On May 8 Ur. Neil Bryant was assigned to the Di>ision and is still in it. He has been employed in various duties, stamping and issuing charts, correcting cata. logues, etc. As a body, the members of the Division ha Ye shown intelligence and alacrit,r in their work, and a. personal interest in its success. On account of the increase of business in the Division, additional help is required to provide properly for present and future needs. The increase is due partly to the greater number of charts issued and partly to the greater detail in issue. For instance, the naval vessels and branch · Hydrographic Offices of the Navy are now supplied with charts separately and directly from this Office instead of in bulk, as formerly, through the Hydrographic Office. One more draughtsman could be made very useful as an additional chart corrector, and his assistance would enable us to fill orders more promptly. It iis proposed that the light-houses on the Coast Charts shall be colored in the future. Shoul<l this plan be carried into effect another person would be needed, and I would suggest that this person be also a draughtsman, for there are often extraordinary calls for charts, which could be more readily met if more persons could be employed in correcting. In fact, our work is so, varied that variety of talent is much needed in the employes of this Division, so that they can readily be shifted from one class of work to another. Thirteen new charts from copper plates and thirty-six photolithograph charts, forly·nine in a11, were added to the catalogue during the year, having been delivered at the Chart Room and placed on the shelves for sale. Following is a list of them:

At the end of the year a count of charts referred to in the foregoing table was made as a check on the book account. The result was as follows : Number of differences = 207; count minus in 117 cases; plus in 90 cases; number of charts minus= 283, value, $114.60-; plus= 227, value, $153.75; final result, number of charts minus= 5G, value, plus $39.15. This peculiar result is readily explained. There is much variation in the value of the charts, and, although the charts plus were less in number than the charts minus, their aggrPgate value was greater. The count was finally taken as correct, and the books have been started on the new year accordingly. I do not consider this discrepancy a large one, considering the complexity of the business and the opportunity offered for the accumulation of minor errors in a year. A fruitful source of errors is in the use of such a chart number as, for instance, 3697, which may in issue be mist~·ken for 369, and may, in moving the chart!· to and from the shelv12s, cause a chart to be misplaced. The error of issue may, in certain cases, never be rectified, but the error in <lispla-0ement should finally correct itself. For these and other reasons the errors are not necessarily nor probably the fault of thebook-keeper, whose work is subject to. various checks in the monthly balances, etc. The system of account of charts seem to be a practical and good one. In all the operations of receipts and disbursements the count is taken, at least, where there are more than a few charts, by two persons independently. It is not intended that any chart shall be given out, whether permanently or temporarily, without a memorandum which shall be the basis of the book-keeping. It is to be considered that the demand for charts is irregular, and that a sudden call may tax th.e energies of the Division to the utmost, and at such times it is not surprising if minor errors should creep in. The yearly inventory will correct gross ones. A daily count of our charts is impracticable, and without it an exact coincidence of book and count can not be expected. It is believed that the Division has done exceedingly well in this direction with the means at its command. The yearly count itself is a tedious operation involving several days' wol'k, during which the ordinary business of the Di vision should be stopped, and it must be taken, in the cases of some of the charts, several times for verification. It is belie\'ed that this account of stock will leave as little to be charged to profit and loss as that of any private business of equal dimensions and detail. Yours, very respectfally,

Duriug the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889, there were received in the Library two hundred and ninety-eight ·mlum es of bound books, one hundred and eigthy-two volumes of unbound books, and -0ne hundred and twenty-two pamphlets, besides the usual periodicals and publications of learned societies. These figures include duplicates. One hundred and sixty-eight volumes have been substantially bound at the Government Bindery. There are still many volumes of periodicals and unbound books that ought to be bound, and .a number of hooks that need rebinding. The card catalogue of the bound books in the Library is finished. For want of room to arrange properly tlle pamphlets7 cards have not been written for each, but only for the subjects in bulk, gh·ing the numbers of the shelves where they are stored. Mr. J. :M.

EEPORT OF THE ACCOC'NTING DIVISION, COA81' AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR E:SDING JUNE 30, 1881.
~. 8. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

lVasltington, JJ. C., September 7, 1889. Srn: I have the honor to submit herewith the report of the operations of the Accounting Di· vision for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889. As stated in my last report, it iis necessary, owing to the varied character of the work performed in this Division, to allude to such ernnts occurring ,during the year as were liable, to a greater or less extent, to increase or diminish its efficiency or to affect the conduct of its business. These will, therefore, be mentioned in order. During the month of August, 1888, it became necessary, in order to effect a complete adjust· me~t of the accounts of Mr. William B. Morgan, late Disbursing Agent, to settle the personal ac·counts which were outstanding at tlrn time of his retirement. This was successfully accomplished; and the amount accruing to Mr. Morgan's credit was deposited in the United States Trearmry. The work inrnh-ed in this settlement was of considerable magnitude, and required an extensive correspondence with those concerned, in the way of explanation, before it was finally and satisfactorily aecomplished. The Annual Report of Expenditures of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year ~ndiug June 30, 1888, was transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury on December 31, 1888. This is the first instance, to my knowledge, where the report has been finished and sent to tl1e Department during the month of December. The pre1iaration and formulation of the data for oar ,present system of detailed reports of expenditures is a work of considerable labor and consumes ·much time, but the convenience of such a report as a means of reference, affording as it does a complete and detailed history of the financial operations of the Sur>ey for each fiscal year, rnore than compensates for the labor and time expended upon its preparation. From February 5 to March 31, 1889, Assistant George A. Fairfield was assigned to duty in the Division, and was engaged in overhauling, replacing voucl1ers, and re-arranging the duplicate files -0f the late Disbursing Agent, preparatory to their final deposit in the Archives. These files had been so often referred to during the past three years, and the vouchers bad become so completely -disarranged as to be absolutely worthl~ss as a means of reference, and hence the necessity for their thorough examination and re-arrangement. It is almost needless to say that Assistant Fairfield .accomplished the work to the entire satisfaction of all concerned. During February and March, 1889, duty was performed hy me at the Department upon se.-eral ,evenings and on Sunday, in connection with the Disbursing Clerk of the Department, engaged in the examination of the statements covering amounts withheld from officers of the Survey in pay. ment of disallowances made by the Auditor in the accounts of the late Disbursing Agent. This caction was preparatory to the refunding of these amounts to those officers and employes of the ,survey from whose salary accounts they bad been deducted, some two years prior, by order of the Department. · The final adjustment of the accounts of Mr. William B. Morgan, the late Disbursing Agent! ·occurred during the latter part of the calendar year 1888. This result was very gratifying to those whose duties brought them in contact with the numerous and perplexing questions which were ·constantly arising during the process of the' settlement. With but few exceptionl'I the adjustment involved merely the usual and ordinary routine disallowances, such as are always liable to occur in the settlement of Government accounts, and which are mainly the result of an honest difference ·of opinion between the accounting officers of the Treasury and the disbursing officers. In compliance with the Superintendent's instructions, an examination of the books and ac· counts of the clerk to the Assistant in clmrge of Office and Topography ~as completed during the month of April, 1889. A difference of only two cents existed in the final balance. luasmuch as the examination covered a. period of three and a half years, this condition of the accounts furnishes -decided proof of the general ability and efficiency of Dr. William B. French, wl10 for many years, "1nder the direction of the Assistant in charge of Office, bas had charge of the receipts of public moneys derived from the sales of charts, publications, and condemned property.

UNITED STATES COAST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

On .Tune 11, 12, and 13, 1889, tlie accounts of the Bureau, and its financial status with the Department, were investigated hy a special committee from the Division of Public :'.\loneys, under orders from the Secretary of the Treasury. The committee performed its work in the most thorough manner, proving every item of appropriation and expenditure and checking every balance. The system of monthly balance sheets, showing receipts and disbursements of all public moneys for the Survey under the appropriations ma.de by Congress, which originated in this Division and the preparation of v;hich is uow mandatory under the regulations, again proved its usefulness. The members of the committee expressed themselves as perfectly satisfied with the results of their examination, arnl so reported to the Secretary. During the year the current work of the Division was accomplished with as much promptitude as possible, though at times its accumulation was embarrassing and productive of much delay. Under our present system of making disbursements, with its inherent edls of delay and complication, such conditions are likely to arise at almost any time and it is quite impossible to avoid them. The action of the accounting officers of the Treasury in the adjustment and settlement of the accounts of the B1ueau during the last fiscal year has been very gratifying, and encourages me in the belief that a point bas now been reacbecl in the preparation and rendition of our accounts to the Department beyond which it is hardly possible for us to progresi;:. Such objections as were made by the accounting officers were susceptible of an explanation, which was in most instances entirely satisfactory and resulted in the allowance of the items objected to. The statistics of work accomplished in the division, as nearly as they can be recorded, are stated below. They afford hut a slight conception of the innumerable details of accounting to which attention has to be given. The examination and adjustment of any one of the thousands of accounts passing through the division every year may occupy a clay's time, and frequently even more, before a final settlement can be reached. Statistics, therefore, can not be given which would intelligibly account for the labor and time expended on sucli work. Statistics.

During the year the following-named circular,; aud publications relative to the preparation and rendition of accounts, and information concerning them, were disti·ibnteil to the cliiefa of p<irties and other officers: Table of rates for Government telegraphing for the fiscal year 1889. Schedule of uotarial fees for jurats in the different States and Territories. Table of distances, 1888, issued Lly the '\Var Department. Annual report of expenditures of the <Joast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year 188i. The a,rrangement of the work of the Division among its emvlo;ye,; bas been substantially as follows: Mr. Eugene B. Wills, Accountant, was engaged in the examination of acco1rnts, checking them as to errors of enumeration, extension, etc., in drawing checks at the Department, and mailing the correspondence of the Division. He was so employed until l\Iay 7, 1889, 011 which date be was transferred to duty under direction of the Assistant in charge of Office and Topography. Mr. William. II. Lanman, acting as General Book-keeper, Las rendered faithful and intelligent senice in recording the business of the Dh·ision in its Yarious account-books and in the manage· ment of the system of balance sheets, the preparation and rendition of the qnarterl_y accounts to tb~ Department, arnl other details iutrusted to his charge. Under my general supervision the clerical work oft he examination of the books and accounts of the clerk to the Assistant in charge of office, heretofore referred to, was performed by lUr. Lanman, whose zeal and efficiency in the discharge of this duty deserves special commendation. The class of work upon which l\Ir. Laarnau is engaged deserves a higher rate of e.ompensation than that he now receives, and I would respectfully recommend that some provision be made at an early date to give him an increased emolument. Mrs. S. M. Talip,ferro, acting as Book-keeper and Entry Clerk, was engaged mainly in work dependent upon that of Mr. Lanman, and upon such other clerical details as were from time to time assigned to her, u11til October 15, 1888, upon which date she was detailed for duty in the office of the Sixth Auditor by direction of tbe Secretary of the Treasur~-. On .January 2, 1889, she was transferre<l to the Department and appointed to a clerkship in tile Sixth Auditor's Office. l\Irs. Taliaferro had acquired considerable information as to the work of the Division duriIJg lier connection with it, and I felt some regret at losing her services. The transfer, however, was au advantage to her, as she has since been promoted. Miss Paula E. Smith, general clerk, has rendered intelligent and capable sen-ice during the year in the preparation of the monthly and semi-monthly pay-rolls, the care of the letter-files, recording authorities and contracts, and general copying aml miscellaneous work. During the month of May she was absent, by authority, for twenty-nine days, without pay, an enforced absence rendered necessary by the condition of her health. A recapitulation of data contained in the Daily Journals of Occupation of the Division for t!rn ilscal year just ended gives the following:

· Working at home for U days, which was charged to leaYe account.

The total number of working da~·s duriug the year, on which the office was open for the transaction of business, was three hundred and oue and three-quarters. The actual disbursement of money for the Survey has, as heretofore since August, 1885, been made by Mr. Geo. A. Bartlett, disbursing clerk, Treasury Department, on vouchers from this office duly approved by the Superintendent. The labor of examination, adjustment, and settle· meut of these \'ouchers, invoh"ing a large correspondence, the keeping of numerous records, and tlrn supen-ision of inuuwerable details, is performed by this office. The business is all conducted in l\lr. Bartlett's name, and he is responsible for the correctness of the disbursements. Repeated efforts have been ma!le to secure some recognition from Congress i.n behalf of Mr. Bartlett, as a compensation for the service and responsibility entailed upon him in making disbursements for this Bureau, but so far without avail. In prior reports, I ha Ye referred to the matter more in detail, aud my subsequent experience has in no wise changed m;y opinion as to the justness of an allowance to Mr. Bartlett for the services performed by him for this Bnreau. A.t the date of tliis report, I am gratified to perceive that my recommendations in the reports of the two preceding years, as to the necessity for the erection of a counter or other suitable enclosure in the rooms of the Accounting Division, are to be favorably acted on. This action is entirely in accord with the system prevailing in all the Department8, and will result in affording that degree of privacy and freedom from interruption so essential to the proper conduct of an office inrnlYing the duties of auditing and accounting. In closing, I beg to call attention to what I have said in prior reports as to the necessity for the appointment of a disbursing officer for this bureau. The present system of making disburse· ments is so costly, full of incongruities, and so entirely inapplicable to a proper conduct of the financial business of the Surniy, that no good or substantial reason can be assigned in favor of its continuance. Any quantity of data can be supplied to prove that the cost of making disbursements for the Survey, by present methods, is largely in excess of the amount which would bereqnired if the Bureau possessed its own disbursing officer with a properly organized force to assist him. In behalf of the public interests, I have deemed it my duty to call attention to this matter, and ha,·e done so in my annual reports for the past three years ; here my responsibility ceases. If it is intended to perpetuate the present system, with its inherent evils of delay, cost~ and incongruity, elements which affect ancl retard the work of almost every branch of the Survey,. I shall at least have the satisfaction of knowing, in the event of future criticism, that no concealment of its peculiarities and its baneful effects upon the business of this Bureau can be laid to my charge. There are many improvements, both in the method of keeping the accounts and their renditiont which could be inaugurated and developed to such an ext6nt that many of the irksome features-

now attendant upon the work of adjustment and settlement of accounts could b modified and the labor now given to such points considerably lightened, both in the office and in the field. It is useless, however, to undertake any sq.ch improvements, or to develop an.)· new methods in accounting, while t~ Survey is laboring under the present awkward and unbusiness-like system of making disbursements. The new method would require the presence at the office of a disbursing officer,. without which the.)' could not be successfully accomplished. I am, respectfu1ly yours, 'JOH~ W.

{;, S.

CO.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

lraskington, August 3, 1889. Sm: Herewith I beg leave to submit this report on the work done in the Office of \\-eights and ~leasures, under m~' charge, during the fi8cal year ending June 30, 188\.1. The regular force of this Office has as heretofore consisted of a mecbanician, a watchman, whose labors are accounted for in the reports of the Instrument and ::Miscellaneons DiYisions, respectively, and of an adjuster of weights and measures. The latter positionii,1 filled by Dr. J. J. Clark. He was assigned early in tbe summer to duty at the Oincinnati Exposition in connection with Coast and Geodetic Survey and Weights and Measures exhibit,;, and reported for duts in tllis Office on November 22. Since that <late he has been engaged in making weighings, in adjusting and repairing standards, and in making line measures. In addition to the regular force several assistants were assigned to duty for short periods of time. Assistant John B. Weir was on duty from July 1 to July 8, and again from September 1 t<> December 26. I am greatly indebted to him for his conscientious aud very efficient assistance. Besides assisting in various comparisons and computations, he made a complete determination of the secondary end standards of length from the one-foot rod to the ten.foot rods; made a determination of the length of the sea.le of the mercurial barometer, aud compared six brass scales intended for the new leveling rods. Subassistant F. H. Parsons served in this Office from April 13 to June 30. He compiled a reference volume in relation to the distribution of all the State standards, examining the records and letter flies of this office to verify and correct existing data and to systematize the information. This involved the indexing of the earlier Jetter files. The card catalogue of papers relating to observations and computations begun b,r him last year, he continued and brought up to date. It contains at present five hundred awl fifty-eight ca.rds. Mr. Parsons also assisted in the comparison of standards of length, in making computations, and in duplicating records, and in all these dntit·s pro\·ed himself efficient. Assistant.A.. T . .Mosman was attached to this Office from December 10 to December 31, during which time he made experimental weigbiugs in order to familiarize himself with the work he was about to take in hand, but his services were elsewhere urgently needed and he was detached. Assistant F. D. Granger was attached to this Office from May 17 to l\Iay 31, am! was engaged in the comparison of the mural standard graduations and in the comparison of two brass

sea.Ies.

160

\Iy own work inch1tletl the supervision of the constructiou of the new comparing vault and of a comparator capable of cornpariug- line or end measures up to 6 metres in length. A detaikd report ou the compari11g room will be submitted at some future time, after it llas been tested under widely different conditions of temperature and for different classes of work. During the summer I began the comparisons between the Committee Metre and the Lake Survey stamlartl kirnlly loam·d to u::; Ly the Chief of Engineers. These comparisons were made in niriou;; places and at different seasons iu order to secure the req nisite range of temperature. A series of comparisons was made in the cold-storage rooms oYer t,he Centre :Market, where fairly constant temperatures at zero awl at --f':l centigTade were secured. Tue results of these comparisons show that there can be no material dift'ercnce of length between the Internatioual Prototype l\Ietre an1l the Committee J\lctre. The Lake Sun'ey standanl was also comparecl by me with the metre of Y. and l\l. No. I, with a uew steel line metre and with Berlin metre No. 4!L · The results deducetl from the comparisons of the last-mentioned bar differ materially, aliout 611 from the value for its hmgth at zero, liitherto aecepied an<l resulting from the comparisons made at Berlin. A detailed report 011 tltese eompariso11s L5· Assistant Schott and myself has been suumitted.

A'I'LANTIC COAST.

Ou the ;)th of Jnly, 18SS, the Gedney, Lieut. F. H. Croslly, L. S. N., comwaudiug, left New York fol' the eoast of 1\laiue, atHl ou lrnr arri,·al llegan work in St. Croix RiYff aml ColJscook Bay. Thi" was carried on until the Gth of Septern O(·r, when Lit>uteuant Crosby reported tllilt the work assi~ned him was completed, and as this finished the in.shorn h~·drographic surTey of the ·CO<ist of :Maine, instructions were r;cnt him to clo;;e work and to proce<.'d to Nantucket Sound. Tl1e Blake, Lieut. J. E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., comrnamling, was engaged from August '.!7 t<> Ol'to· lJer 1, 1888, in outside work in the vicinity of ::\fatiuicus Island, off thl' coast of l\Iaine. On its -0ompletion the Blake went to B1>stou for rnpairs 1ire>ious to taking up the current inYestigatious in the vicinity of the vVinr1wanl Islands, \Yest ltHlies. 'J'he first of the ;vear found tlie com bin e<l part~·, consisting of tlle Eagre, Daisy, and three large steam-launches, at work iu Yiue.Yarrl a1J1l Nantucket Sounds, all t~11der the charge of Lieut. Snmner C. Paine, U. S. N. The work lly this party was carried on witll good results nutil the 2<l of November, when the weather lJecoming too unfaYorallle to }1fOceed with it economically, the party )lroceeded to New York and began preparing the recorJs aud sheets for transmission to th1· office. The large num lier of steam-launches engaged in this survc_y, together with the lhri'.sy-a large tug-aud the pulling-boats of the Eagre, enabled the >rnrk to make progress c011ti11nousi,\· without having to del:ly for repairs to the launches in case of a breakdown. Lieut. J. F. l\foser, U. S. N., with p;1rty in the steamer Bache begall work outside of )fartha's Yineyanl Island about July 5, and shortly afterward, the weatl1er being uufayorable for outside work, he was directed to take up the sheet iueluding )Iuslrnget Uhanuel, a locality peculiarlr tlilli-cult to survey, owing to stNng currents and titfo-rips. The work was, howeYer, Ratisfactorily performed before the cud of the sea.sou, Oetober :rn, wheu the Bache proceeded to Baltimore for oyerlmuliug preparatoQ· to starting for the Florida coast. When the Gedney was recalled from the coast of Maine, in September, slie was seut to Nan· tucket Sound to assist in that work, Lieut. J. 1\1. llelw, 'C. S. N., ha\·iug relieYed Lientenaut Crosby of the command of the vessel on the 14th of Septemller. B~· the detaclnueut of the latter -Officer the S11rvey lost one of its most efficient hydrographers. The sheets of Lieutenant Crosby's last work in the Yicinity of Eastport-embracing Passamaquod<l~' Bay and St. Uroix ltiYer and Cobscook Bay-have never been exceeded for accuracy by anJ· sheets that haYe been sent into this office, a most creditable showing when the strong curreuts and the extreme range of the tides

are considereu.
The Gedney was rooa.lled from her work in Nantucket Soun<l on the 5th of October and sent to New York to 11repare for work in Alaska, the passage of an appropriation for a boundary survey

'.rbm;e special free floats were proposet1 to do away with the objection that exists to the use of the current bottles, which were more infinence<l by tl.Je wind and sea than b,y the current. Greatly ast:listed by l\Ir.

Some ha Ye already bl~en set adrift l.Jy the Blake, aml others arc in New York a"' aiting the Railing of a Yessel of war. As the floats will be bnt little intlneuced by the wind awl :sea I am strongly of the opinion that the results to be obtained from them will UL' Yery Yalnauh·.
PACIFIC COAST.

On Thia~- 25, Lieut. H. D. ::\Iansfield~ U. S. X., al:'sumed charge of the llydrographic part;1· on board the steamer Hassler, at .Jiare Island, California, and proeeedetl to prepare for li~·llrog raphy oft' Crescent Uity, California, am1 to make an examination of .Jlission Hock, San Francisco Ba,y. There bein.g an urgent necessity for tlh· cornpletion of the sn1Tey in the ·icinity of Sau Diego, California, and the com!itio11 of the boiler of the Rteamer .1!t:Artlt11r rnaJ;ing that n'ssel uua,·a.ilable, it became neee;;sary ou the ]~~th ot' October to direct Lieutenant :\Iausfiehl to close work on the northern coast aud to prepare for work south. On the 15tb. of October Lieut{'naut l\lanf'field procee<lel1 1>ith thP Hasslel' to Sau Diego, California, and commenced t,Jrn h~-drograph,y of that coa8t. The wmk proceeded under ilis direction wit!J more rapidity than was expected, owing to the short dh;tance of the one hundred fathoms contour from the eoast. Ou the 1st of l\farch Lieutenant :'.\fansfield was detached from tlH~ command of the Ha8sler and assigned to the Patterson prevamtory to taking commaml of that
\CSSel.

Ile turned over the party to tl.Je command of Lieut. Dennis H. l\fahan, r. S. N., pemli11g the arrh·al of Lieut. Daniel Delehanty, U.S. N., who assumed charge of tile Bassll'r on :Jlard1 18, aml completed the remaining hydrograpby. On the 10th of April the Hassler closed work in the \iciuity of San Diego, Oalifomiu, aud proceeded to San Francisco to prepa.re the ·essel for work elsewhere. Ou the 20th of April Lieut. J. :\1. Helm, U. S. N., took the Gafoey into San Francisco after a successful an<l uneventfnl trip from New York of oue hundred aml fifty-eiglit day:,;. The development of defects in the main shaft, which required extcn;.;il·e re·pairs, and the high price of cmil, owing to t.he small quantities purchased at a ti nw, fa lly warrantL'd the autici patiou s of the necessity for the deliciency appropriation whicll was only partly allowl'd hj- the last Congress. The lack of fn:1ds it\ailable made it imilOssible for the Gcdn1'!! t1i proceed to Alaska during this season, so on the 25th of May Lieutenant Ilelm !ll'OC\eede1l to l'urt Orford, On'µ.on. :wd commenced the hydrographj· iu tlrnt Yiciuity, which is progressing ns rapiLlly as tile weather and fogs would permit at the close of the year. On the 5th of June the Has1der, under command of Lieut. D. Dehohanty, U.S. X., left Sn,u :Francisco, and on the 8tlJ arrived at t!Je mouth of Rogue Hirer, Oregou, for tile purpose of making an examination of the entrance, but owing to ba\l weathrr was 1111a\Jle to do anytlliug·, so proceeded to his working ground in the \·icinity of Crn8cent Cit;r, California, and lwgan the ltyurography there; and at lhe close of the year tl.Je vessel was still eugagt·d 011 the work. The beginniug of the ;year fonud l1ieut. J.C. Burnett, t:. S . .X., eon1111at1tliug tLe ;.,teanwr 1lfc.Arthur, engagetl upon the hydrograph,r in the Yicinit,> of Cape Flatter,r, \\-ashiugtun. As there had been only a reconnaissance of tile topography iu this Yiciuit;y, the work was prosem1ted with some difficulty. The work was much delayed by fogs during tile whole season, and on October :! the "\leather became so unsettled that it was impossible to carry ou the work any longer witl.J good results, so Lieutenant Burnett, in accordance u·ith instrnctiomi, closed work and proceede<l to San Fraucisco.

present season, bnt tlrn delay in the passage of the deficiency bill by Congress, and the rlisco"l'ery of greater weakness in the boiler than was first <'Xpected, has resuitetl in the 1UcArthur's remaining at Sau Francisco af the close of the year. On ~larch 2-! Lieut. J.C. Burnett was detached from the survey by the Navy Department, arnl was relieYeli in command of the 1llc.drthur by Lieut. Dennis H. 1Hahan, U. S. N. On July 1 Lieut. H. T . .l\'Iayo, U. S. N., commanding the schooner Earnest, was engaged in the surn·y of Saratoga Passage and l~osario Strait, in ·w ashingtou Sound, 'Vashington, his party having gone in the fil'ltl in April. This work was prosecuted with so much energy that, as a rulr, the bydrography was up with the topograpliy, although the neces1:rnry data bad to be obtained from the topographic parties in the field before its ''et°itieat ion in the office. The appr~acb of the wintr.\· season rendered it un'l"l"ise to continue -field work, aud on October 25 the Earnest closed fiela 'l"l"ork anll proceeded to Olympia to prepare the records for transmission to tlle office. Durillg tlle interntl when hail weather pre1·ented field work the Earnest was put in go01l repair, anu on .:llay lfi left Olsmpia arnl proceeded to Auacortes. The hydrograpliic sun-e:v of Skagit Bay was cornnwn1~etl. On Juue 16 Lieut. 11. T . .:llayo was detached from duty with tlJe Survey and was relieved in command of the Earnest by Lieut. J. X. Jordan, U. S. X., \Yho, at t!Je close of the year, is proceeding with the work as rapidly as the lallk of the topograpliic data ordinarily provided from the office will permit. During the year the gap in the hytlrography off the coast of California, between San Diego ~tIHl :S-ewp()rt Bay, has lJeeu complete1l, a111l the tlata is 11ow read,v to be put on the charts. The g-<LJl near· Crescent City has been partly filled, aml in a short time will be completed. There remain unsurveyetl ou this coast limited areas, which can be readily completed, with lilwral appropriations, in two seasous. This, with some atlditio11al deep-sea work to connect the hydrng-raphy off tl1e 111aiuland with tlrn off-lying islantls, will practically complete the 11,ydrograp!Jy otI the coast of Ua!iforuia, except local hytlrographic sur·eys that ma~· be needed to constrnct harbor eharts ou larg-e se;1les, an1l correct and complete charts already published. Theri'. is. however, a long- e:s::tent of coast line in Oregon and '"/ashingto11 which may require se,·eral se,i,sous ot ste1uly work to eo:nplete. ln al:uo.'lt ·~n~ry portiou, however, the shore is so bold a~ to re11dt>r tile publication of any but small scale charts unnecessary.
ALASKA EXPLORATIONS.

Ou tlJe 7th ()f April, 1888, the steamer l'tittcrson, under command of Lieut. Commander C. :VL Thomas, U.S. X., left San Prancisco for Alaska, arriviug at Port Simpson on April 23. After a Llela~· of two d:iys fitting out tlrn steam-launch Oo.;mos, a.ad taking astronomical observations, the l'atterson proeeetletl to :Stepl1e11s Pa,ssage and at once beg-an the work in that vicinity-a fair localit,Y for the measurement of a base line ha Ying been fonml or> Glass Peninsnl:-i. A line of 3,875.97 meters, O\'er water, was measured three times with excellent results. As far as I can ascertain, thi::; method of measm'ing a hase-liue, using piano wire over water, is original with the .Alaska surYey-it tirnt lrnYing been usetl in 18136. It became necessary to devise some other than the ordinary method on aceouut of the impossibility of finding any suitable location on shorl· for a baseline. The metholl of comlucting this measurement is very completely set forth in tl1e able report to yon from the clJiefofpart.r, Lieut. Commander C. 1\1, Thomas, U.S. N. A request ha Ying beeu made in April by the Department of State for a survey or Portlan1l C::mal, the boundary lietweeu Alaska and B1'itish Columbia, instructions were sent Commander Thomas to stop work in Stephens Passage about Jul,y 1, and to proceed to the former locality aud take up the smTey there, gidng great attention to tl.Je accuracy of astronomical work an<l shore-line. The tiuishetl sheets of this surrny, suumittcd to you on the 17th of June, bear testimony of the very accurate aml rapid work executed by Commander Thomas and his party. The work in Portland Canal was finisheu on the 13th of October, and the Patterson proceeded to Sau Francisco after stoppiug at Port Simpsi:m to lay up tho Cosmos.

The party in the Patterson were busy most of the \\inter with tlte office "l'O!'k. On the 1st of April Comma11,ler Tho1mti,; was detaclied from command of the Patterson, and onlered to special dut~- at the Coast and Geodetic ::\ur·ey ollice until July 1, 1889, when he will take up tbe duties of Hydrographic Inspector of the SmTey. Commander Tlloma:s was relieve~! in cornm;i.ud of the Patterson h~- Lieut. II. H. ::IIan::;tield, U. S. X., who had been for some months iu command of the llassler. Tliis officer's e\:cellen t standing as a bydro!:!'r<tpbcr is a g11arnutee that the work will be kept up to the high standard to which it has been brought by the efforts of all his predecessors. In April the Patterson proceeded north again, and a telegram from Lieutenant :\Iansfiel<l on the lst of .May anuounced his arri\·al on the working gronnll.
REPAIRS OF VESSELS.

A.11 experience of four years in the office has convinced me that the annual appropriation for repairs to tho \"essels of the Survey is not !-mfficient. The amount allowed, 8:!5,000, is enough wlteu only ordinary repafrs are reqllired, but when an unusual number of extensin: repairs to Yessels, the. engines, boilers, and steam-launches are requirell uuring the same year tlie amount is entirely inadequate. During the past foicaJ _vear the repairs to tlte Gal1iey, Enilearor, and the Blake cost ahout 815,000, lea\'ing only $10,000 for the otlter twenty \"essels or tile Snn-e~-. '.rhe Blake was d0t~k1·d, lier sheathing stripped off, refasteue(l and reC<llked, new deck laid, anrl other minor repairs made-all necessary to place her i11 conditio11 for the deep sea, work on which she has been engaged for many Jears. It having been decided in October to send the Gedney to the Pacific for use in the Bonndar,> Survey of Ala,skn, it bec~une necessary to give her a complete o\·crhauling aml st1ppl;1· her with a new steam-launch. 'l'o take the place of the Gedne.IJ iu the Gulf work, it became necessary to fit out the Emleal'Or, resulting in practically badug to rebuild her upper \vorks. The Rchoone11 Transit, a sharpie of light draught for use iu the sllallow bays of the G nlf, llas proved, like her prototype, a g1eat, success, but unfortunately slle did not arrin' at Pensacola iu time for last winter's work. The .AfeArtltur's boiler "as reported by the commanding officer to be in such a condition as to necessitate exte11sive repairs, and a special appropriation of $3,680 was asked for and obtained with which to repair it. On cutting into it, however, the boiler was found to be in so muclt worse condition than was expected that it would be more eco11omical to build a, new one, and arrangements have accordingly been made with the B11reau of Steam Eugiueeriug, Na1y Department, to build one for the sum of $6,500. I have to earnestly recommend that the appropriation for "Repairs of vessels" be increased from $25,000 to $30,0oO. I ha\"e also to call ,your attention to the fact that a small steamn of not more tban 5 feet draag-ht is greatly needed in the Survey. The ouly steamer of light draught now in the Survey is the Arago, but her condition is such that I have to recommend that she be l:iold.
HYDROGRAPHIC DIVISION.

The Hydrographic Division has been under tbe charge of Lieut. l\I. L. Wood, U.S. :X., during the year. Daring his temporary absences from tbe Office, Ensign E. H. Tillmau, U. S. X., was given charge of tbe Hydrographic Division in add.it.ion to bis regular duties. The work of the Division bas been of its nsuaJ varied character, an cl the rpsnlts are shown in the increased accuracy of the charts llllblished by this office, and b;.· the reduced number of corrections to be applied by hand to the charts before their issue from the Chart Room, although the number of copies issued have largely increased.

166

U.NJTED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

As the result of several changes in the routine of furnishing corrections for the copper plates and for tlie Chart Itoom, tlle cu arts publislled by this Office are practically correct for purposes of ua\'igatiou for all important information received at this Office to the date of issue, and are for all prnctical purposes the eqnals of any in tlrn world, both for the information given and the ease with which they can be kept corrected for purposes of navigation. The ".Notices to )lariners," giYing information of all important corrections to charts of the United States, are now published monthly. The change from quarterly to monthly has been proved to be adnmtageous, and a further cliange to weekly instead of monthly should be made as soon as satisfactory arrangement~ for prompt printing can be effected. I also call your attention to the necessity for increasing the means for printing charts rapidly enough to supply the increased demand. The ability of tl1e Ollice to furnish copies of charts inomptly would atl<l much to a just appreciation of the work of tlle Office by the sea-faring community. Owing to tlrn mcrease in the amount of work passing through the Di·ision, I recommend that an additional draughtsman be assigned. This will enable the Didsion to begin tlie much and long needed work of eliminating discrepaucies a1110i:tg the published charts by a systematic overhauling and comparison.
COA.ST PILOT DIVISION.

Tlw Coast l'ilot Division was under the immediate supervision of Lieut. G. H. Peters, U.S. N., until the tinw of his detachment, November 25, 1888, i-;ince which date Ensign Edwin ll. Tillman, U. S. N., has had charge of it, and his annual report is submitt.ed herewith. Althou;;h dming the greater -part of the time since the detachment of Lieutenant Peters, the work of compiling Coast Pilot manuscript Las been done wholly by Ensign Til1man and Mr. John Ross, there has beeu no time when the printer has not had in band the manut:icript of one or more volumes, and other manuscript has lJeeu prepared and is really to put in type when arrangements can be made with the printer to rlo so. It is \·ery desirable that some arrangement shonlll be made by which Coast Pilot manuscript can be put in type with greater rapillity. Your attention is specially called in· connection with this snhject to the annual report of the Coast Pilot DiviE:ion transmitted herewith. In aceoruance with the scheme submitted by Lieutenant Peters, and approved by you, work has been tle>otcd to tbe preparation of manuscript of a large volume to cover the Atlantic Coast of the Unite\l States. A portion of the ma11us1:ript is now in type and will be issued as soon as received from the printer, a.'> li nited Sta.tes Coast Pilot, Part IV, "Long Island Sound witll Approaches and Adjacent ·waters." The next part to bP. issued, the manuscript of which is now ready for the printer, h; Part VI, "Chesapeake Bay antl Tributaries." Snb-Divisiou 22, ''Atlantic Local Uoast 1~ilot, Straits of Florida," is now in press.
A.LA.SKA CO.AST PILO'f.

Lieut. Comrniirnler IT. E. Nichols, U.S. N., has heeu occupied during the fiscal year in collecting data for aml rewriting the Alaska Coast Pilot. At the beginning of the fiscal year Lieutenant Commander Nichols was in Alaska collecting data, and making personal ohser>ations along the coast. He arrived in San Francisco, Cal., August 23, 18S8, but left again on September 201 1888, to visit Southeast Alaska, in connection with his work of rewritiug the Alaska Ooatit Pilot, returning October 19, 1888. Since that time he has been engaged iu putting tho data collected in slt_ave for publication. Ilis report for the fiscal year has not yet been received. Tlie clerical work of _tl1is Omce, which is laborious and exacting, has been performed to my entire satisfaction hy l\fr.·J. H. Hoet1i.

Washington,]). C., June :.!U, 1889. SIR: I submit the foilo'l'l"ing rPport of the work executed by the Ilydrographic Division, under my clwrge, during tlie fismil ~·ear ending June 30, 1889. During my temporary absences from the Office from July I, 1888, to October 4, 1888, while in charge of a hydrographic party 011 board the steamer Endcavo1·, and from May 4 to 25, 1889, while

on leave of absencl', Ensign E. IT. Tillman, U. S. N., acted as chief of the Division. Duriug the year the followiu~ draughtsmen have been attached to the Division, and ha Ye performed all duties assigned them with zeal aud intelligence: l\lr. Eugene \Yillenlmcher, :.rr. ,Y. C. Willenlmcher, l\Ir. F. C. Donn, and ;\fr. E. H. \VyYill. Owing to a request for his senices as nn obsen·er in the field, i\fr. W. 0. \Villenbucber was a way from the DiYision whHe on board the steamer Endeal'or from August lfi to August :n, 1888~ when he resume<l his regular duties. Ensign E. A. Anderson, U.S. N., was also attached to the Di\'isiou temporaril~·, while working up records preparatory to registry in the archives, from January 20 to FebrnaQ· 25, 1889. Tue detailed results, as far as it is practicable to tabulate them, of the work executed by each .(lraughtsman be found at the end of this report.

This statement shows that tlle amount of work is about constaut, and that the preRent forcf' is capable of preparing for use the amount of data likely to accumulate during the year. Since, however, all the work in other Divisions of the Office tliat is based upon the ploth1g of tlie soundings on the finished hydrographic sliePts can not be decided upon or laid out intelligeutly or economi cally until the data ha.s been put in a form for reference, an<l all errors elirnluated, a due regard for economy and efficiency demands that all the available hydrographic data for selection in compiling charts should be put in a state for comparison with tile least possible loss of time. To have a force in the Hydrographic Division large enough to permit each s<'ason's work of ·Ewery party to be put in hand as soon as received from the fiel<l wonlcl he the theoretical method, hut as this would seem inadvisable under tbe })respnt conditions of the Office force, a compromise

miglit he efiectetl by i11creasiug the force iu tlw Divisiou by an additional draughtsman, au<l ui;ing a11_y spare time that may result from thi1; iucrease in o>erhauling and comparing the different charts covering; the same localities, with tlrn Yiew of eliminating many tliscrepaucies aud isume errors that are kuowu to exist. As any addition to the present force would reqnire a long time in order to secure the serdces. of a draughtsman under tLe present system of ci\-il se1Tice appointment, aml the work of tbe DiYisiou might get behind so far as to delay seriously the work of the other Divisions in the Office, I recomme11<1 that steps be taken at once to make the increase in the number referred to above. The dutie1; required of a hydrographic dr:anghtsman necessitate for rapid work a fair knowledge of practical seamanship, in order to interpret the records and reconcile apparent discrepancies in the field sheets. Those capalile of tilliug the requirements are very few in nulliber, and are so widely 1;c:attered t llat the seleetion would be llifficult, even without the uncertaiutie:> attendiug civil 1>Pl'Yice appointweuts. Iu this 8ame co1111eetion l urge tllat propet' arrangements be made to have the chief of this DiYi;;iou placctl pcrmauently upou auy boanl for secnriug the appointmeut of draughtsmen for l1ydrogTap!Jic w01·k, throug-h the CiYil Service Commission. l tis with Jedi11gs of 1.;ousitleraule satisfaction that I call your attention to the recent practical n'coguiriou of tlle success of the uew rnutine for correcting Coast aud Geodetic Survey c!Jarts adopted in cmiscqueuee of your recommeutlation by the Hyurographic Office of tLe ~a,·y Department.

Arraugemeuts have just been completet1 for sending charts as directly as possible from t!Jis office to the Yarions uanll vessels withont the supplemeutary conectiou formerly cousidered and frequeutly fonml ueces:;ar~· under the old "ystem of chart correction. The )lonthl;i :Xotices to )[arim·t'"' cotupiled from the records of tLis Di\isiou, lrn'.'e been found nKefnl in a,;;;isti11g uavigator:< to k\'l'P their chartB corrected to date. The circulation of these .:S-oti1·P;; is now 11nite large, and efforts arc beiug matl1', for the conveuieuce of the .Mercantile Marinet to ~upply copies of each ii;sue to e\·ery Collector of Customs iu the Uuited States, and to all United St<ites Cousulates abroad. ~\ weekly issue would be at1>antageous and should be adopted, providetl arraugernents can be made for wore rapill printing. l recommend that stPps be taken with a view to obtaiuing the assignment of printer:-; and a printing-preso: to th:s building from the main GoYernment Printing Otlice, for the purpose of getting out the .Notices to Mariners eYe1-y week without the loss of time that is unavoidable as loug as the proofs ha,·e to be carried from oue pitrt of the city to another. ·ru order to obtain chart corrections with precisioit and accuracy, large uumbe~s have to be sent to Y<ll'ious authorities for +erification or to obtain information. The increase in the number of charts sold duriug the past few years bas been quite marked} while the priuting arrangemeuts are much the same as wheu only a small proportion of the present stock was required. The result bas been that the lack of copies of charts require!l lo gather information renders it impossible at times to ,·erify correetions before engraving, and adds much work to the alrea(ly numerous duties exacte!l from the Division. Dtisides this delay and the increase in labor, the scarcity of charts seriously interferes with the proper business reputation of the office. I therefore sugget:lt, as the demand is evideutly increasing, that it would be to the advantage of tl1e Smvey to makrially add to the means for priuting charts. I also call to your atleutiou the fact that it woultl iHhl much to the value of the charts of the Coast an<l Geodetic Snffey if the time between the completion of the field-work aud the publicatioB of the data obtainf'd from a RtHYry were reduced at every possible point. The lithographic work bas been brought out so promptlJ· in some cases as to show that dispatch is not inconsistent with accuracy, anll to bring into greater prominence the delay in pu hlishiug charts from copper plates. For the use of the ua>igator the value of a chart deteriorates gr~atly with the age of the data upon which it is based. I have to call to your attention the numerous reports that have been received at the Office relating to dangers that ham been discon~retl in localities coverecl only by preliminary surveys with

old instruments and methods in which the hydrography has not been sufficientl.Y close to answer the needs of the commerce of the present day, while sufficiently detailt-d for all purposPs at the time the surn,.r was made. I suggest that a(lditional and closer 11ydrography is much nee<led along the ::Sew England coast from Portlalld, l\Ie.~ to Newburyport., l\lass, an<l in the _Hudson Hin·r, Sew York, where the rocky character of the shore admits of a survey lasting for all time when once ma<le, and the bottom makes it posHible for tlaugers to escape a.ny hnt the closest search. The interests of commerce also demand new surveys in the ·dcinits of Nantucket, along the Jersey coast, in the Dela.ware RiYer, and in Clie~:ipeakc Bay and its tributaries, as the by<lrographic sheets of these localities are at pn·spnt known to be erroneouR in many respects, arnl not to be depended upon for any bnt the most general details. The following has been the general assignment of work in the Didsion, subject to ehanges from urgent deman<ls for special work: To l\Ir. Eugene 'Villenbncher, inspettion of drawings and finished charts, Alaska sheets, Atlantic and G nlf coast sheets. To ~Ir. n~. C. ·wmt'nbucher, preparing field records for registry, preparing 11otes for clrnrts, miscellaneous work Atlantic coast and Atlantic and Gulf coast sheets. To 'jfr. F. C. Dom1, miscellaneous -work and Pacific coast sheets. To l\Ir. E. Il. Wyvill, c!Jart corrections from all sources, correcting proofs for engra d11g and sample charts, for Chart Room and miscellaneous work, and in a<l<lition preparing letters relating to work in the Division for your signature. The statement of work perfonued is as specific as the space an1i1able and the Taried character of the work will permit. Very respectfully, M. L. \YOOIJ, Lie1drnant, F. ?S.

REPORT OF THE COAST PILOT DlFISlOX, COAST .LYD GEODETIC ST:B VEY OFFICE, FOB THE FISC.d1~ YEAR ENDlSG JUSE 30, 1'°~9.

U. S.

COAST AND tTI.:ODETIC SrnVEY OFFICE,

lfasfdngton, ]I, 0., July 1, 188!.l. SIR: I have tlrn houor to submit the following report of tile work of the Coast Pilot Di\'ision during the fiscal year eudi11g .Jmw 30, 1880. Uwler the general direction of the Hydrogrnphit: Inspector the duties of this Di\-isiou involve the execution of work both in the vfilce am1 in tlie field. At the beginning of the year the new (third) edition of Subdivi8ion 6-7 was in press, and on October 20 the volume was received by the Office for issue. In the latter part of .A.ugust the manuscript of Part IY, U. S. Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, was sent to the printer, and the first proofs of :i portion of it were receiYNl from tbe printer October 10. From that date proofs were received at irregular interrn.Is until May 2, 18:-;U, when tbe l'n.st pages of proofs were approved for printing h.r thi" Division. A11 arlnrnce copy of P;1rt IV has been received, views and maps inserted, and the time of issuing the edition now <lepemhl entirely on the printer. The manuscript of Subdivision 22 was sent to the printer early in April, 1889, and a few p<1g-es of proofs were received from, and returned to, the printer previous to .May 20. Since that date no proofs ha.\'"e been received by this Division. The manuscript of this SubdiYision was ready for the printer in May, 1888, but owing to the delay in having matter printed, other manuscript of more importance was sent for publication.

174

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIO SCRVEY.

It would seem that some arrangements should be made by which Coast Piiot manuscripts can be published with greater rapidity. The dehiy in publicatiou of matter makes the work of proofreading much greater, and necessitates changes in tlrRt proofs in order to bring the information up to date. Although Part IV coutains only one linud1·etl and fifty-six pages, arnl the manuscript was sent to the printer ten mouths ago, the Yolumc is uot yet i;-;1:rned. .A. slight delay in issuing this Yolume has been caused b,y the fact that the Yiews to lJe inserted were not ready when the adrnnce cop~- was receind; that this was the fact was uot tluc to tbis Divisiou, but, _I belie\·e, to tbe state of Coast Survey funds. It may be argned that tlle delay in the publication of Coast Pilot volumes is partly due to the fact l hat the proofs ha\' some ti Illes lJeeu retained se,·eral da;.·s h,r this Dh-ision, lmt an examination of the rectmls here certainl,y indicates that this was not the c:u,;e, autl th:lt the delay was in no way cau::;ed hy thi,; Division. The manuscript of a volume to coYer Chesapeake Bay arnl Triblltaries, and to be issued as Part VI, of the general rnlume of tlle U.S. Coast Pilot, is now virtually ready for puulication, the ouly work still necessary bciug that required to bring tlrn matter up to da.te, immediately before :,;elldiug to the priIJter. The locality covered by Part YI is uot covered by ltllS Coast Pilot publi· cation of this Office antl it i:s desirable th~Lt the rnlume be isslletl as soon as possible. ~Inell matter treati11g of the <'oast of :\laiue, Massachusetts, Hltode Islaud, aud Connecticut is in the Ofiit·e, but rnnch work will lie required to pnt it in shape for pulllicatio11 aceordi11g to tlle present scheme; that is, the issni11g of varts wltid1 shall each form a vortion of a large Coast Pilot n;lume co\·eriug the ..AtlaDtic coast of the United States. Lit~11te11aut 1-L ii. Peter.~, lJ. ::;, X., was in charge of this Division until the date of his detachrncilt, So\·e111lwr :!\ 1888; tJiuce that date 1 ha\'e beeu iu charg·c of the work of the Division. From .July l, 1.-88, to October 4, 1888, and from :\lay 4, 188G, to :\lay '.!5, 188!:1, my time was mainl:1 occupil'tl \>ith tile work of the Ilydrographic Divisiou, of which I Ltall charge during the temporary ab,;e11ce of Licnteuant 1\1. I.i. \Yornl, U.S. X. I hare bee11 ably m:1sisted during the entire fiscal year l>y Mr. John Ross, who has l>eeu mainly eugaged iu rcYising aml compiling manuscripts relating to the coast of Maine antl to Cllesapeake Hay all<~ TrilmtariL'S, arnl who has also performed 1mwb of tbe rontiue Office \York. Ensign E. A. Auderi-;ou, G. S. N., reudcred efticient se1Tice ·luriug !Jis tewporary attachment to the DiYisiou, from February 25 to April 17, 188!.1. l\Iiss G. B.

THE RELATION BETWEEN THE METRIC STANDARDS OF LE~GTH OF THE U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SUR\'EY AND THE U. S. LAKE SURVEY.

Assistants, Coast and Geodeti' Surrny.

INI'RODUCTION.-Oonsideriog that the results herein disetissetl, which refer mainly to the rel· ative and absolute lengths of two primary standards, are of great importance to both the Coast and Geodetic Survey aud to the Office of Weights and Measures, it has been (leemetl best to present them in a joint report. Results are given also for the length of a secondary standard used in graYity research.

(Jo.AST .AND GEODETIC SrHVEY OFFICE,

Was7tingto11, D. C., June 15. 1889. The Committee metre has served as the standard to which llave been referreu all metric length· measure8 supplied to the several States of the Union, under the act of Congress of .Tnly, J,'\66, and in general as the metric standard for the Office of Weights and Measures in its \'erification ofleugthmeasures submitted to it by manufacturing establishments, engineers, scientific men, aud educational institutions. Furthermore, it is well known that all results of the Coast and Geodetic Snr1ey relating to length are expressed in terms of the Committee metre, and that certain metric lengths giw11 h.r the Lake Survey are expressed in terms of the Repsold metre of 1876; also that special use has bl'len made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey of the Berlin metre No. 49 in obserrntions for theintensity of gravity at various 11laces at home a11d abroad. The Committee metre· is one of the original iron bars used to derive the metre from the 'l'oise du Peron, and it belongs to the Ameri· can Philosophical Society, but it l1as been in the custody of the Coast and Geodetic SurYey since its first organization. The Repsold metre twas acquired by the Lake Survey iu connection with a base apparatus by the same arlist; it was kindly loaned by the Chief of Engineers, U. S. A., to the Office of Weights and Measures for the purpose of comparison with other standards. The Berlin metre No. 49t was obtained from the Eichungs Amt, or the German Office of Standard Measures at Berlin, b.Y Assistant 0. S. Peirce in 1876, and has been used lJy him in couuectiou with his researches for the length of the seconds pendulum. The Committee metre is an end metre; the other two are line metres. The immediate occasion for bringing out and presenting om· results was the necessity of expressing the length of the Olney (Illinois) primary base-line, mea,sured lJ.r the Lake Snrrny, July"For pa.rticula.rs, descriptive and historical, the reader ma.v cousult Transactions Americau Pl1ilosopl1ical Society at Philadelphia, vol.

September, 1879, in terms of the Committee metre. This base, together with its geodetic connection with the main triangulation sonth of Chicago, falls within the belt of the transcontinental trianglllation pas;;iug across Illinois, and was consequently iucorporated with it. The connection made in the field in 18SJ and 188! between tlle two independent triangufations, and the adjustment of the base figure i1n-olviug thirty-two equations of condition, enabled us to make full use of the previous labors of the Lake Survey, which in rw;pect to accuracy leave uothing to be desired. There are otl1er points of contact of the two Government surveys, as, for instance, in the State nf New York, at the eastern ewl of Lake Ontario, and near the Illinois and \Yisconsin boundary, near I,ake }licliigau; these geodetic connections can only be fully utilized when the results of both suryeys are based on uniform standard data. lu this report we shall designate, for the sake of breYity, the Committee metre b.r C. M. (for which formerly the SJ'mbol Mc was frequentlJ· used); the Rcpsold metre by R. M. (which in other pull1icatious appears also under the forms H., 1876, and U.S. (Hepsold); and the Berlin metre No. 49 by B. :'.\I.

REPSOLD METRE OF 1876 (R. M.), u. s. LAKE SURVEY, AND THE cmIMITME~RE (C. M.), U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

For the comparison of these standards the best means at present available is the bearncompass comparator of the \Veigbt.s and Measures Office, designed by Assistant H. ·w. Blair, and constructed in 1882 by Fauth & Co., of Washington. Since this instrument has not yet been described, the following short account of it may llere prove acceptable.

Description of the Optical Beam-Compass Comparator.
Tllis comparator was designed for comparing any two line.measures from a decimetre to a metre in length, and for comvaring end-yards or metres with line· yards or metres respectiwly, according to Airy's method."' The principle of its construction and use is to move a beam carrying the microscope from one lcngtlHneasnre, supported horizontally underneath, over the other one to be compared with it. Tlte ends of the beam are brought up against adjustable stops at each end of the apparatus when pointing on one har; the beam is then slid on its supports transversel,y until it abuts against the opposite stops, which define its position over the other one. The beam can also be brought to any position intermediate hetween these stops. At each end the beam is graspe<l lJy a lever-arm. These arms are connected by a rod, which is moved by a harnlle underneath the apparatus, and thus tlle beam is moved to and fro upon its supports. At each end the beam is tixed to a transverse bar of metal, 3 inches long, forming part of the heam, an<l moYing with it upon tlie fixed supports, which are fastened to the bed-plate of the com. parator. Each transverse bar rests upon two heels, each abc;mt ii of an inch long. On the left . hand end of th.c beam one h.eel has a ifat surface; thl3 other an angle-shaped groove to guide the beam and preYent its longitudinal displacement as it slides on a correspondingly shaped rail on the fixe1l 1mpports. The heels on the right-hand end of the beam haYe :fiat bottoms, so that wheu the beam is moved it may adjmit itself to unequal stress without sensible twist. The fixed supports are fastened to an iron bed-plate, which rests on a stand. Rollers are pro. \·ided witlt n~rtical a<ljnstrnent, passing through the bed-plate from below. On these the bars to be compared rest, and can be readily raised or lowered to suit the requirements of the focal plane of the ruicroscopes. This description will be readily understood by reference to the drawing (illustration No. 19).

Micrometers.
The micrometers belonging to this apparatus are marked A and B (though not so lettered on the illustration), and were constructed with the greatest care. They were minutely studied by the
·Philosophical Trans. of the Royal Society, London, Vol. 147, Part III, page 685.

Illumination.
Illumination was secured by means of Tolles prisms inserted between the systems of lenses of the objective. In the Survey Office, room Ko. 6, the prisms were illuminated by two coal-oil lamps set between the double windows of the room. In the standa1'.l& room of the Entler Dnilding adjoining the Survey Office, no artificial light was used. The light from the sky coming in through a window was sufficient. In the cold-storage rooms, most of the observations were made by natural illumination~ hut for a time the light of 3 candle-power electric glow lamps, conceutrate~l by lenses on the prisms, was used. The natural illumination was, however, by far the most satisfactor;r. In the observatious made with micrometers Nos. 2 and 3 concave reflectors below the objectives were used, but proYerl unsatisfactory.

Thermometer.~.

Four Tonnelot centigrade thermometers (rnrre dur) Nos. 4331, 43::>2, 433±, and 4335, -being four out of the six which are iutcudcd to accompan;y the .National Protot~·pe metres as auxiliar:y standards, were used to determine the temperature. They were carefull~· studied at the International Bureau of Weights and :Measures near Paris, and they are accompanied b,r elaborate tahles, giving their -cortectioms. Daring the last set of observations the temperature of the room was at times below the range of the Tonnelot thermometers, and, therefore, two Kew Fahrenheit thermometers, Nos. 967 an<l 968, were substituted for two of the Tonne lot. The depresse11 zero (320 F.) points of all the thermometers were determined several times <luring the observations. The, thermometers were Taid OH the bars with tlleir bulbs in contact with the latter, the bulbs being covel'ed witll ligllt metallic shields not ill contact witll them. The indications of tlle Tonnelot thermometers given in the abstract have been corrected for external and internal pressure, for calibration, scale valne, and zero point, and in tlle final equations they llave been reduced to the standard Hydrogen scale by the general formula established by the International Bureau. The thermometers were read immediately upon entering the comparing-room, aµd no sensible .change was noticeable during the brief periocl occupied by a comparison. The apparatus was covered by a glass case through which the micrometer microscopes projected.
·oO}lP AR ISON OF LINE .A.ND END ilIETRES.-SPECJIAL DEVICE USED WITH C. M.

To make C. M., which is an end measure, comparable with RM., which i;,; a line measure, the following device was used : A fiue S!lidcr-thread was stretched over each end face of C. 1YI., and these and their reflections from tlte end surfaces, with which they were iu contact, or nearly in contact, were viewed through the microscopes. Each spider-thread and its reflection appeared as two dark lines, with a narrow light space !Jetw·een them \Vherever the thread was not in contact with the bar. The light space .-aried in width from Op to HI JI. 'VhPrever an irregularity exists in the end surface of ti.le bar the reflection is 110 longer symmetrical with tbe thread. As the crnh of the C. M. in its axis appear less perfect than tbe rest of the end surfaces, Assistant 'Tittmann decided to make the comparisons on each side of the axis, and for this purpose he used a .<;;prcial de»ice. Two small plates were made, each exactls half as thick as 0. M., each one carrying a guide-arm, which il'.I in contact with the edge of O. M. when in position. Each plate carries three pointers, and when arranged for observation the corresponding pointers on opposite ends of the bar define three diameters of the bar, 22' millimetres apart, parallel to each other, au<l lying in the horizontal plane passing through the axis ofC. M., the middle pointers lj-iug in tlie prolougation of the nxis of the bar very near1s, as shown in tlw accompan~ing skrtcb.

The fteld of view of tile microscopes permits one to see a section of tbe end plane of the bar 11bout half a millimetre long, and this, in view of the \isible irregularities of the surfaces, appeared preferable to observing merely a microscopic point, as was done in the Breteuil comparisons between line and end measures. Most of the obser\·ations were made on the three diameters spoken of. Iu view of the irregularities existing at the terminal surfaces of the axial diameter of C. M., and of the uncertainties of comparisons with this apparatus when the beam carrying the microscopes is not against the stops (see General Adjustments), the final results are referred to the two diameters, I and III. See illustration herewith.

It is known that comparisons haYe at >arious times been matle by means of the Saxtoll 1)yrometer and the Bessel level.compiuator to test the parallelism of the end faces of C. i\L withont lleteeting any deviation.

Places of Obsenation.

The first comparisons were malle in basement room 6, of the Coast aud Geodetic Snr>ey Office, at the natural temperature of tLe room, al>out 220. 7 C. The room was then artificially heated b~· lighting the gas-burners in the room, and a set was made at the artifidal temperature of 29°.(J C. The comparator was then taken to tile sta.ndards room of the Butler Building, adjoining tllis office, and two sets of comparisons were made, oue in December, 18SS, and one in January, 1889, .at an a\·erage temperature of i20.2 0. Finally the comparator was removed to the cold-storage rooms onr the Centre Market, and two sets were obtained in February and March, 1889, one at an average. temperature of - 00.,t C., and the other at - 30.95 C.
General A djustnients.

Before beginning the observations the microscopes were made >ertieal b.> means of' an attached level. They were focused on the surface of mercury put in a long trough beneath them, and the bars were adjusted to the horizontal focal plane thus established. In order to eliminate the effect of possible changes in the position of the microscopes relati\e to each other, when the beam is shifted from one set of stops to the other, it is essential that the bars should he transposed iu such. a way that one bar shall occupy the place previous]~· occnpit>d by the other, thus exchanging front for rear l>ar. The effect of shiftiug the heam from one set of stops to the other can be shown by comparing a bar with itself by shifting it with the microscopes. Experiments made for this purpose show that this effect is very slight, and that it is eliminated by transposing the bar from front to rear. When comparisons are made at points intermediate between the stops we can not feel sure that the rnieroscopes have not changed their relative positions, nor that the effect can be eliminated. Therefore in the reductions, only those measures were used when the heam was against the stops. The bars were frequently transposed and turned end for end. The Committee metre wasalso turned upside down, and whenever that was done it was necessary to take off the caps carrying the spider-threads_, which were renewed several times, owing to breakage. The oouditions were, therefore, varied as much as possible.

U.XITED STATES CO.AST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The bars were protected by a glass c:ise covering the apparatu:;, and weru supported 011 tworollers, whose distance apart was determined hy A.iry's formula.* \Vhen pointing 011 the line metre, the image seen in the microscope iis formed by the whole objectirn (leayiug out of account tlw part cut off by the Tolles prism); when, liowe,·er, on U. l\I., the image was formed by one-half the objective only. By transposing the microscopes, the opposite hakes of the objectives were hrougb t into use; but it tloes not follow that a constant error which mignt be due to the cause just pointed out would be eli n1 iuated by tlleir transposition. Experiments were, therefore, made in the following manner on a fine line traced on a bar fixed under the microscopes: The line was viewed with one-half of the objective coverell, aml ttie micrometer was read. TLe cover was then remo\·ed and paintings were again made, tlie whole objective being uncovered; then the other half was covcrell aud readings were ag~1in taken. This p-rocess was then repeatl'll in tlie iuverse order. This was <lone wit Lt both microscopes a num her of times, but no measurable effect could bediscovered. Tbe comparisons an<l ohse1Tations were all made by Assistant Tittmann. An abstract of the record of the comparisons between 0. J-I. and R . .:\I., and between R.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The French Committee in t11e last century determined for its iron metres a= 11.56 x 10 -i>, a value which was used on the Survey until the first direct determination made by 0. A. Schott, misisted by H. W. Blair, DecemlJer, 1880-Feuruary, 1881, became a\'ailable. These obsen'atious were made at the Survey Office in conuection with the standardiug of two JH'W fise-metre bars, and the method will he found described in AppendiK No. 7, Coast and Geodetic Sur\"ey l~eportfor 1882. The value found, viz: ac. ~i. = 11. 790 x lO - 6 is given on page U4 of that Report; it answers for a range between ::l: 25 4'.) and 330 C. The coefficient of expansion of the Repsold metre was first given by Foerster* in 1879 as 10.31 x 10-" for 10 C., but tliis value depended on the rate of expansion of a platinum bar for which Borda's erroneous coefficient had been asimmed. Additional data enabled Dr. Foerster to deduce the rnlue 10.65! x 10-0 · Tbe values determined by the Lake Survey in 1879-'80, and derived from comparisons with Clarke yar<l A, and throngl1 the expansion of a brass bar, gave respectively 10.59 and 10.64; hence tl..te mean 10.61.5 x 10~· for 10 C. · Elaborate obsernitions ma/le at the International Bureau of ·weights an(l Measures t in January,1883,resulte(l in the value a 1'- ru = 10.563 x 10 -s for mercurial scale,and applicable between the

range 0 to 360 O. By reverting- to the form a+ flt for the coefficient of expansion, and putting fl= 6 x 10-9 as fonnJ for steel uyDr.Beuoit of the International Bureau,Assistaut Tittmann finds that the above value e:xpressHl iu terms of the hydrogen sea.le of temperature becomes a 1'- M. = 10 - 0 (10.535 + 0.00500 t) for a rauge of CP to 31P; hence for middle temperature 150 the value a 1ui. = 10.610 x 10 - 5, wl.Jich may lie regarded a:s the best value deducible from the observations. \Y(' have already given the difference of expansion of these metres resulting from the "\Vash· ingtou obsen"ations of 1888-'89, viz: LI a," ><.-c.

THE NEED OF A HmlEASCREMENT OF THE PERUrIAK ARC.
By ERASMUS D.
I~RESTON,

Assistant.

u. s.

CO.A.ST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Wa8hingto11, I>. C., July, 1889.

Oue lrnmlred aud fifty years have passed since Bouguer was making his obser>atious iu tlie -measuremeut of the Peruvian ~re. The geodetic scie~ce of to-day is so much occupied with the :slight deviations of the surface of the earth from a strictly elliptical figure that it is hard to realize that even in the last century, it was an unsettled questiou whetber the equatorial or polar axis was the longer. A clock having been carried from Paris to the equator was found to lose two minutes each da~-. This fact was supposed to streugthen Newton's theory that the earth was an oblate spberoid. Ou the other band, Cassiui's surYe,rs in France at the beginning of the last centur,y indicated a prolate spheroid. It was to reconcile these two determinations that the Frenc!J Academ~- undertook the ,measurements of Meridional arcs; one on a frozen rirnr iu Lapland, the otlier abo>e the clouds -in Peru. Parenthetically it should lie stated, boweYer, that the PeruYian a1·c, so called., is not in Peru as defined by the geography of to-day~ but more than a lmudred miles north of it in Ecuador. "\Yhen the results of these two expeditions were made known, the scientific world accepted Kewton'H theory, and all later measures have only serred to confirm it. Let us pause just for au instant to examine the triangulation by Uassini, and the time deter·mination l>y l{,icher. Looking at the data with our present knowledge of the accuracy attainable in the two kinds of measurement, it seems strange that the former could for a, moment ban~ ca<:Jt ·lloubt on the latter. In the first place, Cassini's results do not agree arnoug themsekes. He gi,-es the following statement of the length of one degree in toise:o;:

E-ven were there no other reason for distrusting tl.1e observations, their disagreement would .almost condemn them. '\Ve now know that the length of one degree in latitude 4!F' changes about ten toises per d~gree, so tbat the change of more than one bundreu and thirt~- toises in lt space of as many miles, indicates either some large error, or a value for the earth's radii entirely incompatible with even the rudest observations. Besides, if the first differeuce should be accepted, it would require the plaee of observation to be in a latitude >ery different from that known to ha-rn lJeen the case. Therefore the triangulation in itself is not Yery trustworthy. Moreover, any assumption in regard to the ellipticity of the meridian, derived from measures not extending beyond two <legrees, is extremely hazardous.

On the other hand, when we consider that Richer's clock lost two miuut.'s dail;y, and tlrnt it must have been a comparatiYel.r easy matter eyeu at that time, to get differential time withiu a second, it is plain that the only source of error worth examiniug is that due to the change of tlle length o~ the pendulum. Barri ug accidents, aud lea Ying to one side the effect of temperature, which must barn been well nn!lerstood and taken account of by the obserYer, the leugth could 11ot h:wc changed IJ,r nearly RO much as its one-thouR:wdth part, antl as the time Yaries as the square root of tue lellgtb of the petl(lnlnm, tl1e time of om? oscillation could not ha\e been in error more 1L, 11 011e-half this amount. llel!l~e no error can be admitted that wouhlrnaterial!J· change the result, :uul the pendulum -work might have been accepted as demonstrating the oblateness of the figure. I3ut the ~4.cadernJ- resoh·ed upon au imkpendent determination, and the two expeditious were equipped. Douguer set out on :May(), 1735, aml after a journey of more thau a year arriyed at his destination. The party was abseut about nine 3-ears, but the triaugnlation and base measurements were executed between December, 1730, arnl August, 17.3H. .Astrouomical ollservations to determine the amplitude of the arc were made between .TnlJ, 1741, arnl .January, 174-3, and the party arriYed at the mouth of the ::\fagdale11a Hiver on Septemller 30, of the same ;rear. The pendulum was swung at Pol'to Bello, Isthmus of Panama, on the outward trip arnl at Petit Goa Ye, Hayti, on the return YoJ·age. The results are incorporated in the account of the equatorial work. Three gravity determinations were made iu Peru; at the sea-level, at Quito (9,374 feet elevatiou) and on the summit of Pichinclm (H>,564 feet). Magnetic observations were also carried on, and a general study made of the natural history and pby~cal features of the country. \Ye must not. lose sight of the fact that the work was nmlertakeu to decide bet ween the relatin leugths or t.Le eartlI's axes. Several methods of arriving at this result was therefore considerell. It 'Was once thought to supply snfficient cl a ta to dt'cide the whole qnesti.on b;r the equatoria ol>fterYations alone: measuring fo1· this purpose a degree oflatitndc and one of longitude iu th' same locality. But recognizing the fact that -with the means at hand, the former wouhl be subject to an error of .,-0i 0"th part, while the latter would be 1mcertaiu b;y about six times as much, the preference mis giwn to the degrees of the meridiau. Measures had already been made in Frauce, aud from the nature of the involute curYe, formed by the intersection of the earth's radii for any given meridiai1, it was admitted that combining the equatorial measures with those of a middle latitude, the error to lie expected in the ratio of the two axes was only Tl40th iiart; and that a combination with ardic measures would reduce the error to about two-t11irds as much (i,- 0 \ 0 ). The errors attributed to accidental causes rest on the assumption that in each astronomical observation the obserYer is liable to be mistaken b_y three or fonr seconds of arc, and that in noting signals for longitude, one secou<l of time would be the error expected . .After the arc had been measured, it became a matter of some difficulty to combine it with the French and arctic work. Ever;r supposition made iu regard to the meridian, supposing that it could be rept'esente<l by an elliptical cnrve, seemed to do violence to the results of observation. A combination was first made, using the arctic and equatorial arcs, the law being that of the square of the sine;;. This led to a ratio of 214 to 215 for the axes. Then when the middle arc was re-measure\1, aml to tlie three meridian arcs a longitudinal one was added, this ratio was changed and 222 to 223 giYen. Tlle formula was still that of the sines squared. Later, an error was disco,-ered in this rnmeasuremen t. Picard had used a toise for his base measures, which was too sliort by its one-thonsantlth part. The iutroduction of this new value mod_itied the resnlt so essentially that the law prenousI,,- mfoptetl no longer satisfied the ohservations within admissible errors. The formula was changed to one where the increments of the length of the degree varieu as the fonrtb power of the sines of t!Je latitude, and a ratio of 178 to 179 was given for the leugth of the axes. The introduction of a power of the sines lligber than the square was done reluctantly. But it was found that in order to represcn t the curve by the secoud power of the function, supposing the tliree arcs snbject to the same error, it was necessary to increase the degree in France by 69 toises, and diminish tbeother two by an equal amount. This would have re-established the ratio 214 to 215 and would have been nearer the truth, as we now know. But such large errors were not thought possible. In fact, reasoning from their accidental errors of observation, only an error

of 17 toises, could be admitted for the middle degree, and H for the equatorial one. This would necessitate subtracting 140 toises from the northern one, which seemed beyond all reason. The procedure, however, would make the meridian a perfect ellipse and give a ratio of 250 to 251. 'Yhen compared with Newton's theoretical rnlue oft he ellipticity, it "as remarked that this erred in defect about as much as the }ll'eYious conclusion had erred in excess. Therefore the obserYatiuus left the choice of onl.r two suppositions, either that of the fourth porrer of tlie sine/'\, or that of some fnnction of the latitude itself. The arc of longitude which bad been measured was brought to llear on tlle decision, and it was found that tlie measure woul<l, by the first solution, be in error by 150 toises, whereas by the second the error would be reducecl to 18. This decided the question, aud the law of tbe fourth powers and tlie ratio 178 to 179 was adopted. Tb is is the result as givrn by Bonguer i11 his discussion of tbe Peruvian work. Of course it is far from being the truth; but the recapitulation shows to ''hat extent the measures of 150 years ago were <lefectfre, and gi\·es an idea of the influence of this equatorial arc on the elements of the ellipsoid that are used iu all geodetic computatious of the vreseut day. A later discussion improvetl this result, and now there are so many middle arcs entering with great weiglit on account of their increased accuracy, that the Peruvian arc has not t11e importance it ouce had. Notwithstanding it is believed that a re-measurement would so wodify it as to materially change the value now adopted for the earth's ellipticity. We now turn to examine the work more in detail. The first base was measnred on the plain of Yarouqui, about 15 miles e.ast of Quito. \Eight days '\"\'ere devoted to clearing the line. Its true direction was N. 190 26' W. Three wooden rods, each 20 feet lollg, with copper contact plates, pr~jecting 11 inches at each end were used iu makiug the measurement. The plates were so arrauged as to make contact at right ang"les to each other. A rope was istretched for aligumeut, and the inclination of each rod was determined by means of a leYrl. Twe11t:1-fiye days were consumed in the work, whicll was exceediugly laborious because tl1e rod" were 1a;d 011 the ground. This course was pnrsned on account of tlle Yiolent wind. Two rolls were al ways in position The rear one, carried forward by lndiaus, was brought into contact with as little shock as possible; but witL a heavy rod in the hands of several untraiued persous, it is difficult to RN.· how shocks were arnided. An.iron toise was carried along, kept in the shade, and comparisons were made always daily and sometimes oftener. The temperature and humidit~· of the air affected the wooden rods cousiderably. The work was begun from both euds and the parties compared their rod.s when they met in the middle. The south party, however, used tresseli:;, and it was noticed that the effect of \'\iud on the plumb-line, and the consequent error in the length of the base, would be in oppo;;ite directions for 1ihe two measures. In spite of this fact, and with the exceedingly rough method of making the contact, the two independent measures only ditlere<l by about 3 inches for a distance of more than 6,000 toises, which is about 15-u1·0 00 th part. This is a degree of accuracy far beyond what we can reasonably expect in work of this kiud, and there must certainly have been large compensating errors. Base measures of the present time, with all our improved methods of dealing with the temperature, perfected contact slilles, better ways of alignment, and more skillful manipulatiou of the bars by persons trained to the work, do not give much better results. The actual measures gave somewhat less than G,273 toises for tbe length. It was estimated that the necessary corrections would increase this quantit~', and in order to ham tlrnir uase an exact number of toises, one of the end marks was moved 3 inches and 8 lines. It is hard to see what was to be gained b;v this. Of course the ronncl number wonltl be broken by the solution of the first triangle. Their own measures showed an uncertainty of senrai inches. Therefore, asserting that the base contained an exact number of toises within the thickness of a line, goes for nothing. Moreo,·er, the subsequent rednction ga,·e a correction, different from what they had applied, so that the fiually adopted length of the base was not 6,274 toi::;es, as they wished it to be, but 4 inches an<l 1~ lines more than this. The length of the straight line connecting the two extremities of the base was found by first comparing the actual measure with the line as traced on the ground, and then deducing the quantity sought from this last line.

Au approximate value for the base liue substituted in the formula· c d:x; Z= vc2+(b+xf gives the correction to reduce the actual measures to the ground line, considering it sensibly straight for each of the sernn parts into which the whole base was divided. The absolute and relative heights of tile extremities and the intermediate points were determined, which furnished the 1lata for referring the ground line to the air line connecting the extremities. The result. of the entire work was: Ground line longer than actual measure.................. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1. 52101 Ground line longer than air line ... _.... . ......... __ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0. 23100 Air line longer than actual measnre.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1. 2900 I

The correction for temperature applied to the Tm·qui base would indicate a coefficient of expansion of .000015 for the wooden rods, which is between that of glass and brass, but somewhat nearer tlie latter. Bnt tlien not ,·ery much reliance can be put in the temperatures. That of the base of verification was only estimated t and could not certainly have been known within several degrees. But the accordance of the results, errors of compensation being disregarded, would indicate that the temperatures were correct to within one-fourtli of a degree. Au examination of the reconl shows conclush'el,r that this coulll uot ham been- tlie case. On tbe other baud, the Span is Lt otlkers correct the second base by about 8 feet, which would require a coefficient of expansion, hased on the same difference or temperature, at least twice that given above. t It then appears that the temperature factor alone would give rise to uncertainties far greater than the difference between the two results. Tlie angles of the triangulation were measured with quadrants whose radii varied from 2 to 3 fret. Two telescopes were provided, a fixed and movable one, the whole instrument being unh-ersall~· mounted b;)· means of two right-angled cylindrical elbows. :Micrometers were here a11p1iet1 to instruments of this kind for the first time, and it is believed that Bouguer was the first who calle(l attention to errors of ecceutricity. As the limb of the instrument 0111.r includetl 90 degrees, tl1ese errors could not be studied by the method uow employed of comparing diametric readings throughout tbe entire circle. Independent measures of two known angles gave two Pqnations in which tlie known quantities were the errors, and a function of tlie angle itself, and the unknown quanties were the rectangular co-ordinates of the center of rotation, referred to the center ot: graduation as the origin. These co-ordinates being known from the solution of the equatioirn, corrections applicable to any part of the limb could be calculated. Besides this, six or seven angles, which together closed the horizon, ,were measured. These were 'corrected for inclination and tlieir sum compared with 3600. ThA error of closing was on the average about two minutes. l\'Ieasures of equilateral triangles gave au additive correction of 20" for an angle of CilP. Other combinations showed a· correction of 40" for 90°. The separate spaces of 5 degrees were examined· hy comparing with a known angle of this magnitude. A month was devoted to the study of the errors of the instrument. Wirh instruments capable of not more than this degree of accuracy we can not expect a close agreement bet"°een the measured and calc11Jated bases. They differ by about two feet. The triangulation is 200 miles long and contains thirty-two principal triangles. But the result of the side computations from this principal network was twice modified. Once at the eighth triangle, wliere some auxiliary figures gave a result different by 2~ toises from the regular work, and again at the sixteenth, where results having a range of' seven-tenths of a toise were obtained from three different methods of deriving the same line. In both tliesfl cases tlie auxiliary work was combined with the regular triangulation, and tlie resulting line, upon which

-the succeeding work depended, was changed by 1,-1o toises in the first instance aud by tllree-teuths -0f a toise in the second; so that we should not be surprised at a much greater discrepancy between calculation and observation at the end of the chain of triangles. Bouguer sl10w11 that admitting an error of 15" in each angle, the accumulation of these throughout the entire work woul<l produce au error in the second base of about 25 toises, but adds that a certain compensation must be expected among so many errors. After having finished the. triangulation, astronomical observations were undertaken to determine the amplitude of the arc. They were made with a sector having a radius of 12 feet and a graduated arc of about 3 degrees. .Altl10ugh tllis is confessedly the weakest part of an t!Je equatorial work, the methods employed show a keen appreciation of many sources of error. The limb was graduated by laying off an aliquot part of the radius as a chord. This was chosen with reference to the particular star to be observed, and the true wnit11 distance was found by applying to this known arc a small micrometer correction. The modern work with the zenith telescope is but a repetition of this same principle; for here the absolute zenith distance of the two stars is for the moment disregarded, but the excess of one over the other is measured, and applied to a function of their declinations, which arc qnantities determined by other im·estigations. Tile precaution was taken in the Peruvian work to make part of the measures on tlrn same star, antl at the same time, at both extremities of the arc. This weuhl eliminate any effect of uncertainty in the constants for precession, abl>erratiou, and uutatiou, which were not., at that time, very well determined. But Zach has re-reduced the obsernitions of 174~ and 1743,* and finds a difference of less thitn 1" between the results for the simultaneous o1Jservations and those deduced from all the work <luring these two years. The instrument was reversed several times, thus giving values under different conditions, aucl it is said that no discordant observations were rejected.t The method of reversal is reforre<l to as having been in>ented b;y Picard, an<l it is probable that this principle, now so often app1ic<l and so essential in all instrumental work, was here systematically usell for the first time. Its effect in this case was to eliminate the eccentricity of the zero .point of the micrometer. The value of the micrometer was found from terrestrial measures, using the known length of portions of the base, and lines erected perpendicular thereto. The meridian was found by ohserv. ing, at the moment of culmination, the direction of a beam of sunlight, admitted through a hole in the roof of the observatory. The method was supposed to give the true direction with an ~rror not larger than one minute of arc. The accuracy of the measurement of a star's zenith distance appears to depend principally on the stability of the limb of the instrument, and the ability of the observer to set the initial point of the arc in exact coincidence with the plumb-line. There seems to he nothing said as to how this was accomplished, but it is easily seen that it must have been a work requiring much ·care. The measures of the star's zenith disJancc are given to the nea·rest secomL Indeed the three results for the arc's amplitude, have a range of only three seconds.

They do not represent all the observations, but were selected on account of the favorable conditions obtaining at the time they were made. The se~tor had also undergone some improvement. But a mean value from all the results obtained at both stations gives 58", which agrees more closely than one would expect from the range of the individual values. Zach estimates tliat the total error in the equatorial degree will not exceed 50 toises, 38 being for the astronomical and 12 for the geodetic part of tile work (Monatliche Correspondenz, 1807). This is based, however, on Bongner's and La Condamine's estimate of the accuracy of the astronomical work (page 251). Since the radius of the sector was 12 feet, one second on the limb would be about n1croth of .an inch.

quantity, must have been a matter of difficult.\'. In this operation we have ill all proballility the sources of the largest discrepancies. The flexure of the sector was also studied. Experiments were made on an iron bar, from which it was conclnclerl that the flexure YariP11 as the fourth vower of tlie length. It was found, moreoYer, that when the radius of the sector was i·laced horizontall.r its flexure amounted to onetwelfth of au inch. This was shmrn to be inappreciable when the inclination was 011)~- a few degrees, allll when the objective of the telescope was attauhed to the centre of the sector. .Azimuth observations were made at both bases and at. three intermediate points. The agrcc·ment between the observed directions and those determined by triangulation is always within less tlrnu oue minute; the discrepaucy at the last base being forty seconds. The sun was inYariablyused, and the nngle between it aml a sigual was measured with a qua<lrnnt. The errors in orientation, ei:itimated liberally, will not chauge the total length of tlle arc more than a fraction of a second at each end. Therpfore the question of azimuth is not one of vital importance. \Ye now come to perl1a1is tlte most interesting part of Bouguer's work. Not satisfied with jnvestigatiug the exterior shape of tlJe earth, he determined to study also its iuterior condition. It liad been known for more than fifty ;years that a pendulum oscillated more slowly at theequator than near the poll-, autl fimliug himself not only iu a latitude where the force of gra,·ity was the least, but also in a country where there were exceptional facilities for the stucls of this force at great elevatious, he deemed it his duty to devote some time to the inYestigation of the subject. Of the two methods, <>ither compariug tlie times of oscillation by the same i1e11dnlurn, or comparing the leugths of two diftereut pendulums, yilJrating in the same time, he cho1se the former. In this he has been followed by ail later observers. Of course his results cau 11ot now be regarded as of \'CIT great value, both on account of t.he unsuitable methods and inferior instrumeut>i employed. Hllt the work poiuted i11 a certain direction, which has been confirmed in a, general wa,y by some more recent a11d accurate determinations. His method of gettiug time wouM not uow l>e used in gravity observations, although mouern instruments would increase thfr accnraey of the result Heveral fold. It is doubtful whether, with his im;truments, and often using siugle altitudes of stars, the time was correct within several seconds. About one and one-half hours may be taken as the duration of a swing, so that with tile uncertain clock correction, and the short duration of the experiment, great discrepancies in the individual swings were unavoidable. The peuduinm was of au inaccurate t;ype, and its length was found by sim11I;\' holding au iron bar by the side of a thread stretched by an ounce weight. · Contact; with the clam1) above autl the bob below wa:.1 f·xamiued either by means of a magnifying glass or by the naked eye. The indi\·idual results, for the length of the seconds pendulum at Qt1ito, where the conditionswere fayorable, have a range of about 601.00 part. This would correspond to discrepancit-s in the times of one oscillation of less thau one unit in the fourth place of decimals. Under the l'ircumstauces the accordance is good. The result was corrected for buoyancy and temperature. The former was here applied for the first time in pendulum obsen"ations. It was estimated that the density of the air 011 the top of Pichincha was 1 -,-f,- 00 of that of the metal '.lomposing the pendulum bob, and since gravity varies inYersely as the length of the seconds pendulum, the length found was increased in this same ratio. No correction seemR to have been made. for tlie amplitude of oscillation. \Vhen the necessary reductions were made, it was found that gravity at the sea-level, was diminished hy n':ff part at Quito, and by 8 h part on the summit of Pichincha. Since the distance from the earth's centre had been increasetl in the first instance by its "I+.~71 part and in the second by its 1 ./18 part, the results indicated a law not ·ery different from that of the inverse square of the distance. Bnt gravity had not changed enough in either case to satisfy the law. The conclusion, therefore, was that some infiuence, not exactly understood, increased the force of gravity in both cases. Naturally, attention was dmwn to the high table-land J;ring between the stations and the sea. It was estimated that the effect of this woulu be one-half of that of a shell of matter of the Harne density and thickness encircling the whole earth. Granting this, the diminution of gravity in passing from the sea to the summit would be

where k is the height of the stat.ion above the sea, r is the radius of the earth, and <5 aud L1 are the respecti\'e mean densities of the table-land and earth. Now, this <liwinution was found by the pendulum to be 13 1n, which, compared with the above .expression, leads to tbe conclusion that the matter composing the table-land has only about onefiftb the densit~· of the earth. The result was something of a surprise at the time, and doubts began to arise as to whether the interior of the earth coukl be, as some supposed, a fluid mass surrouuded by a thin shell. It could not be denied that the density of the surface was less than that of the interior, because it was sliown that in order that their densities he at least equal, the length of the .seconds pendulum must be in error hy about one-thirtietli of an iucll, which, eYen witli tbe rough method employed, was too great an error to be admitted. If the land lying between the upper station and the sea be regarded as a plain of infinite extent, the same result ensues, and the formula deduced from this point of ''iew is of somewhat simpler derivation. Clarke arriYes at the same result by regarding the intervening matter as either a cone, cylinder, or segment of a sphere, where the horizontal dimensions are great compared with the vert;ical ones. In calculating some attractions in the Hawaiian Islands, the matter was treated rigorously as a cone, and the resultant attraction at the foot of the mountain, based -on this value, agreed clo.5eJ.r with that derived indepelH1ently by the latitude obsen-atious and trian gnlation. The value of the radius of the earth employed in the Peruvian investigation was about 12,000 metres too large. Introdncing the value now accepted we get a rlensity for the And(~S sornewllat greater. The change is in the right direction, but it is not enough. The rocks in Peru probably ha\'e a density of about 2, or possibly less, and if the sea-level is in error by 100 toises, the pendulum work would give about this density for the nnderlJring mass. The method used in fimling the absolute height of the base line, to which all the elerntions were referred, was by triangulation. The results were roughly clwcketl by the barometer. I<'rom Niguas, a point between Quito and the mouth of the Inca l:tiver, angles of elevation were takeu to several mountain peaks, of which Pichincha was onP. Niguas was also Yisible from a point near the sea-level. The distances being approximately calculated, witll some of the angles concluded, the elevations could be determined with some degree of accuracy. The last stati011 was estimated from barometer readings to be about 30 toises above the sea. But that not much confidence could be placed in the instrument is plain from the fact, afterwards stated, that weighing all circumstances it was concluded to fix the difference at 40 or !2 toises. The result was checked hy a very rough estimate of the inclination of the rinr-bed arnl the velocity of the current. Kuowing the relation between the velocity and inclination at a point near the station, and determining the velocity further down the stream, the inclination was calculated. Then from the measured horizontal distance, and the inclination, the vertical height resulted. It is evident that not much reliance is to be put in such a determination; but perhaps the error is considerably inside some others entering into the deduced lieigllt of Pichincha. The angles of elevation were measured with a quadrant which mig·ht gi,·e results as much as 3011 from the truth. Then, as there were mountains back of the station, 12,000 feet high in one case and 15,000 in the other, the angles of elevation may have been in error iu either case b.r tho greater part of a minute. And errors from attraction would be ~ccumulative, since Nignas is on the mountain fl.auk. The distance from the sea to Ilinissa, with wliich Picbincha. was connected, was found from the known difference of latitude and the azimuth. It seems therefore probable that the total elevation may have been in error hy as much as 50 toises. This is not enough to bring the mean density of the Andes into tolerable accord with that of the surface rock. lt is difficult to estimate accurately the probable error of the distance bfltween the two extremities of the arc, because sufficient data are not available. Take one eighth of a foot, which is one-half the difference between the results, as the probable error of one measure oft he base line. This is composed of errors in the lengths of the rods and errors of measure, properly so called. The error in the entire base as depending on the former, varies as the length, and as depending on tbe latter, as the square root of the length. Assume these to be equal. This would give for the uncertainty of one of the rods (20 feet), 0.000! inch or less than 5 of<>in;-th part, and for tlle uncer· tainty of making contact about of an inch.

Either of these errors is not only much smaller than we can expect from work done underthe circumstances, but they are actually less than are generally realized in modern measures. Therefore, when we consider the means of comparison with the standard and the method of placing the bars on the ground, the close agreement must be considered entirely accidental, and in 110 wise to be taken as a criterion of the accuracy of the work . .A11y error in the Iiuear measure is transmitted through the triangulation, and the probable error· in the last side will depend ou the ~werage correction to a direction as determined from the shape of the triangles and their number. To this is to be added the error in the base, which transmits itself iudepemlently, and its effect depends on the relation between the base and the last side. The a\·erage direction error, resulting from joining points in a triangulation, is about twice as much. as the average direction error arising from closing the horizon at any one point. Regardin,g the probable errors of the base and angles as the differentials of those quantities, the uncertainty of any side may be computed by a formula involving these differentials and known functions of the angles. Taking eight seconds as the probable error of an angle, which is less than that estimated by the obserrnr, we calculate the uncertainty of the laRt side, as llepvnding on tlie a11gle <'quatiou& alone to be slightl.r more than 10 feet. This result is based on tue formula

which assumes that one of the angles in each triangle is a concluded one. The true probable error where all the angles are measured would be somewhat less than that given. ~evertheless, all thecircumstanccs being considered, we may assume the uncertainty of the last line to be not far from 12 feet. The chances are that this is an underestimate. This error, as we have seen, is about that tliscon~red near the middle of the chain, and which influenced all subsequent work by one-half its amount. The error in the base is uow disregarded, because, although it is much larger than the results of the measures would indicate, its effect ou the last side would still be small in com11:nison with that resulting from the angle equations. Tlle astronomical obser>ations agree among themsel>es, hut it was not suspected at the time· that the mountains might affect the plumb-line by at least thirty times as much as the results were supposed to he in error. "'·hen the work was done, instruments and methods had not been brought to that degree of perfection necessary to detect these small influences. Since theu many striking cat>efl have been brought to light; 22 11 deviation having been notictd in India, 16" in Russia, and '..!9" in the Ifawaiian Islands. In the example near Moscow there are 110 mountains to acC'Ount for the phenomena, and the supposition is that the density of the underlying strata may be subject to great variatious, or that large subterranean caverns ma.Y exist. Archdeacon Pratt has shown that small changes of density, if extended over a considerable area, ma.Y produce very perceptible t1P1lectious of tlte vertical. The Indian example is produced by the Himalayas. The Hawaiian is the result of the attraction of Haleakala, an extinct volcano 10,000 feet high. "'hen we consider that between the extremities of the Peruvian arc, there is a continuous range of mountain,;, yar~'ing iu height from 9,000 feet on the plateau of Oochesqui, to 19,000 at the summit of Uhimhorazo, an<l remembering that the arc was terminated at a 1ioint where the elevation dropped sudde1J!y several thousand feet, it is evident there must have been enormous differences between the astro11omkal aull geodetic latitudes. ,Judging from analogy with other cases, similar, either in the >olume of the mountains, or the <lensity of the matter, it seem;; not unlikely that the amplitude of the arc may be in error by many ;;;pconds. Indeed, if we take the data u,-ed in I1a Place's first discussion, the Peruvian latitudes Rhoul<l be clmuged b,y alwut llll' in order to give au ellipticity conforming reasonably with our pre:-:ent Yalue. And the requirctl cliange shows that the plumb-line was drawn towards the rnonntaius. The erroro:1 iu th1l measures of tlle two bases, in the triangulation, in the altitudes, or in the azimuths, could not have an influence at all comparable to this, so that a simple redetermination of the latitudes would nry much improve the result. Iu fixing the figure of the earth, an equatorial arc enters with great weight, and we find that in a combination by least squares of uine arcs used by La Place, an error of one minute in the amplitude of the £'qnatorial arc would reduce th&

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

207

ellipticity to one-half its original value. This seems to be a great change for the supposed error, but it must be remembered that not only is the arc at the equator, and therefore has great iutlnence in the determination of the elliptic figure, hut also that it is a comparatil·ely .slwrt arc, arnl beuce any error in the amplitude Las a proportionately greater efi'ect on the length of a degree deduced therefrom. The individual influence of arcs, where many enter into the determination, should not, howeV"er, be o\·erestirnated. If we ii:u11pose ares of one degree to he measured from the pole to the equator, say 100 apart, their weights i11 fixing the polar axis are approximately as the numbers 39, 43, 54, 70, 89, lll, 131, 146, 157, 161, and in the determination of the equatorial axis these same numbers apply in au in.-ersc order. A cnr.-e plotted on rectallgular co-ordinates, with the earth's radii mal the abo.-e weights as arguments, has a point of inflection in middle latitmle1-1, and since the ellipticity is uuity minus the ratio of the nm axes, middle arcs ha\e n·ry little infinence on the ellipticity. The pendulum obsenations indicate that the density of the mountains is about one-fifth the mean density of tlie earth. '\\'e may therefore assume that the Andes in the ueigh liorliood of Quito, are 01ie-half as dense as the general snrfaco of the earth; and if we take liY' for the deflection at each end of the arc, the ellipticity of the figure is changed by about one-fourth part of itself. The effect of any change in an equatorial arc on the figure of the earth, as detlncPd from the uine arcs abo,·e mentioned, is easily found.

where a is the independent variable. The degree beiug at the equator, tlle differential of 2 ab is zero; and the change in the length of the equatorial degree from the solutiou of the normal equations would be about two-thirds the assumed linear error in the in di Yidnal arc. Knowing the differentials of M and N, the changes produced in the eccentricity and ellipticit~· are obtained without difficulty. It is a singular fact that the first combination of the Laplaud and Peru,·irm arc;; garn a ,-alue for the ellipticity quite as near the truth as was deduced b,y La, Place fifty years later, using the accumulated data furnished by improved instruments and methods. This is partly owing to the fact that the two arcs, having the greatest influence from their position and length, remained unaltered. La Place's combination gives a value in excess, and the supposition of the plnrnb-line being deflected towards the centre of the arc changes the Yalue in the right directiou. Row much allowance slwuld be made for attmctiou it is difficult to say, as the coufigura tion of the laud is uot kuowH with sufficient accuracy. The indications are, that eyen admitting the small densit~· of the mountains, the deflections are much l~rger than wonhl be necessary to bring this arc iuto aeeonl with the others, and give a value for the ellipticity called for by modern obser>ations in middle latitutles. If 've accept the <lata in foi. Place's first cornbinatiou, a deflection of 11" at eacll end of the arc wonhl be required for this purpose. There seems to have been some compensation of errors, which bas giwn the Pt:rm·ian arc a V"alue conforming closely with our present spheroid. But its agreement in thi:-; rp;;1wet is 110 excuse for not remeasuring it. The measures of the hase liue agree witllin a few iuehes, hnt no one who has examine<l the case believes that this is :rn;ythiug but an accident. The eombinatio11 of this arc with some other recent ones in the determination of the figure of the t>artli, gin~s corrcetions for the equatorial latitudes e,·en smaller than those required b;y points whose positions

were determined with greater precision, and where the direction of the plumb-line is umcll Jei;s distnrbe1l lly attraction. These 8mall corrections would probably not be confirmed by a new measure. ~otwitllstanding, this work was well done considering the circumstances and the state of science at tlie time. Bongner and his associates were scientific men who thoroughly understood the requirements of tlie case, aml executed tlie work with the utmost fidelity. The necessity for .a greater or less degree of accnr;icy, according to the kind of observatiorn:i, and the bearing of each partial result on the final one was the source of constant study. :!\'Ian;\· principles of work bere practiced for the fir:st time !Jam l>een adlieretl to by all later obserYers. But tile ad vautage of repeating this work wotilll come from the great improYerneuts in instruments, aml tlie consequeut bringing to light of influences that were theu unknown. N otbing at the time was known of spherical excess in geodesy. The theor;y of least squares was undiscoYered, and the metho<l. of equal zenith <li>;tances had ne\·er been applied to the determinations of latitude. 'Ve now have also the "compensating base apparatus a111l many perfected forms of the pendulum for tbe measurement of the force of grayity. In fact in eYery class of work tbe errors at present range from one-tenth to one-hnndrcdth of what was then considered admissible. Adrl to this that tliere is no check on the astronomical latitudes, which are doubly important on accouat of the sliortuess of the arc; that the elevation above the sea is >ery uncertain; that t!Jeil' <mn obsen·atiom; show an nu certainty of7 or 8 feet in the sides of the triangles, and that the arc enters into the cletermination of the ellipse with great effect owing to its geographimtl vosition, antl it must he coucetletl that the gt~odptic science of to-day demands the re-measurement of tlle Perin-ian arc. It is high time tliat the equatorial work be put on the same footing as the other <lata entering into this important problem. ERA.SM US D. PRESTOX,

'Telegraph line and batteries.-Tht> line from the mountain to San Francisco, via San Jose, is 651 statute miles in lcngtli. It is composed of 50 statnte miles of No. 8 galvanized wire and of 15 miles of No. 9 'llire. Batteries at San Francisco, 150 cells (gravity), and at MoP.nt Hamilton, 10 and 19 cells, before and after exchange of obsernrs. Time determinations.-T1rn sets of transits were obser-ved at each station e·ery night of exchange of longitude signals, at an interval of about oue hour, and the same stars were observed at \Joth statiomi, weatller permitting. Three lists of stars had to be prepared, caused by the unusually long peri01l m·er which the longi tulle work extended, which was partly d ne to had weather arn] partl,Y to inte1 mp ti on of the. line. Tbe star places were taken from the Berliner Jahrbuch with the exception of four stars, whose places depend on the American Ephemeris. Each set is compvsed of 10 stars, 5 of wbieh are obsmTed with transit axis in position E. (or " 7 :) and 5 with axis reYersed in its Y's. Of these 5 stars, 4 are circumzenith or time stars, 2 culminatiug uorth aud 2 south of the zenith (this is the arraugement aimed at) and one is a circumpolar to control the azimuth. Time e.l'Cltan!fes.-The exchange.~ took place between the two sets of transit observations. They are composed of arbitrary siguals, between two anu three <lozeu in number, sent autl receiYed at each station. On nights of exchange the chronographs are run at double speed while these signals are passing.* Personal equatio11.-The differential personal equation between the two observers is eliminated from the resulting longitude by the obsen·ers ha\·ing changed places after one-llalf of the lougitude work ;ms completed (their instruments, 110we>er, being of the same pattern, remained at their rcspectin stations). Computation.~ and results.-The first or rough field computation for difference of longitude was made hy the obserwrn; the Office computation was made by E. Smith, Assistant, while temporatil.r attaclied to the Computing DiYision, and the partial reYision by L.A. Bauer, of the same Division. The sets of transit obsen·ations were reduced by the method of least squares, as explained in Appenrlix Xo. 14, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1880, Part II.

It will be noticed that tile sum of tile relaith·e weights [49.5] for difference of Ion gitude before the exchange of observers is about four times greater thau the sum of the relath·e "\"\"eights [ 13.5] after tlle exchange. This undesirable foat11re is wholly due to the ad \·ance of the unfavorable seasou, as indicated by the fact that the probable error of observation of a single star is full;r don bled in the second period as compared with the first. Trans1nfasion or wave and arinatn1·c time.-Tl.ie column headed W. - E. in the above table contains double tlte transmission time o,·er 122 kilometres of connecting· wire; the half or actual transmission time is, therefore, o·.0070 ± 0".0010, a ,·ery small value, slwwing close adjustment of the quick acting relay. Resulting d(fference of personal equation.-The differeuce of the t.wo wean rnlues for lougitnde· for first and second positioll of obseners is 1louble the pen;onal equation eftect benc.,-e we have S-111=+ 0'.lH ± os.011 where the prooable error of the personal equation S - 1\1 is found as follows: Suppose the number of days of longitude work equal before and after exchange of observers, we may deduce as man,Y separate values for personal eqllation as there are such days by comparing LJ,\ 1 of thP first day with .d,\1 of the first day afte;· exchange, next by comparing .d ,\ 11 of the second day with LIA. 11 of the second day after exchange, etc., and deducing the probable error from these separate results. In the case of inequality of days as ir1 onr table, we substitute the mean value 3m 08".8fl8 to make up for the sixth day wanting after exchange. The combining weights for the resulting difference of longitude for any night are derived

from the expression Pi Pn , where p 1 equals the weight of the time determinatiou at the first statiou, or p 1 = r1-· and p 11 = i·11 ·-·, a similar quantity at the second station. It grmerally suffices for· these relative weights to exi)res;,; them by one significant figure.

PREFATORY NOTE.

The following description of two new portable transit instruments, specially designed for use by the telegraphic longitude parties, a,nu constructed ftt the instrument shup of the Sune~· Office, was prepared by the undersigned and submitted by him under date of June 7, 1889. Eff\YIN Sl\IlTil. Assistcoit, Coast and Geodetic Sun·cy. Up to and including the ;year 1887 the transits Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, arnl s, made by Troughton & Simms, of London, were used in the primary longitude work of the Survey in obsen·ing time. These trarisits are all very much alike, except .X o. s, whicll has a ver,Y much ht>aYier iron frame and an inferior reversing apparatus. All these instruments have telescopes with objectiYes of 2~ inches (7 cm.) aperture and a focal length of about 46 inclies (117 cm.). Yarious diagonal eye· pieces have been used with them, and give powers of 80 to 120. Origina1ly only No. 8 had reversing apparatus, but such au apparatus was afterward added to all of them, with great improvements over that of No. 8. Iu 1880-'81 changes were made in some of these instruments by which they were made available for determiuiug latitude by the Talcott method. One of these transits as thus changed is shown in plate No. 62 of Appendix 14-1880. For determinations of latitude these instruments were not a success, the micrometers and levels being unequal to morlern requirements of accuracy and the eye pieces not being aplanatic; but for observations of time the records of the Survey show that the~· have gi,·en goocl results. For some years, however, they have been regarded as unsuite1l to improved field methods, and their weight, packed for transportation, between 525 and 700 pounds (238 to 318 kgru.), bas been a large item in tile expense of the work. During the summer of 1887 the writer suggested to the Superintendent that new transits be made at the Office for the longitude party. This met with his apprornl, aml iu response to llis request the writer at once sent from the field rough plans and specifications for two new transits. On his return to the Office from the field in the autumn of the same year the matter was thoroughly discussed, and a plan finally adopted for two transits to he known as Nos. lS aml Hl, and to be used exclusively for the observations of transits of stars in longitude determiuationR. The illustration (page 215) shows two \·iews of these instruments, iu \Yhich the priucipal detai1 8 may be seen. The working drawings for these transits were made entirely by ::\Ir. E. G. Fischer, tlie chief mechanician of the Survey, and to him is due the credit for working out all the details of tlle me· chanical construction. All the patterns were made and all the work except the castings was done

in the Survey Office shop in charge of Assistant A. Braid, and under the immediate direction of l\Ir. Fischer, who himself ditl tlte final work on the pirnts, as "llell as on many other details. The objectives were made by John Clacey, of Boston, and the eye-pieces by Kabler, of 1Vasltington.
THE INSTRUMENTS.

Tltere is a triangular-shaped suldiase of iron to these transits (see illustration), "llhich is to be firmly cemented to a brick or stone pier approximately in iiosition as to level aml azimuth. lTpon tliis suh-base tLe h1Rtrnment proper rests at tliree points. One point of support is the leYeling.f'crew, ilie foot of wliicL rests in a co11ical Lole in the snb base. The other two points of sup1·ort terminate in spherical snrfaces and rest upon two planes on the snll-base. Tltere axe two opposing r,;cn'WS attacLed to tlie snb base, which abut 11gainst a tongue cast on the frame. These two screws are turned at tLe Raum time b,v a double-adjnstiug bar, and turn the whole frame ill azimuth about the k>el1ng-screw as a centre. Them is a g1,aduated h(·ad to one of these screws by wltich the instrument may at once be set in tlie meridiau when the azimuth error is known. There are three bimliug scrC\YS uear the three points of support, which may be used to clamp tl.te frame to the sub-base if thought necessary. The brass V'R LaYP plane surfaces at right augles, and the pivots bear not on two points but -on two lines. These v~s arc film)~' fixl'd to tlic iron frame, antl theirrelatiYe position remains llll· cliauged in any adjw;;tment of the instrument. Tbe re,-ersing ~1pparatus is the same iu principle as in the old transits, but is entirely abo1e the Rurface of the pier. Tl.le teleRcopes Lave objectives of 3 inches (i.G cm.) clear aperture, and focal length of alJout 3i inches (94 cm.). The diagonal eye-pieces are made after the formula of Airy, and ltave an eqnirnlent focal length of b~o inch (8.9 mm.). ·with the:se eye.pieces the telescopes lia.-e a power of ahout. 104. Each transit bas also a straiglit Ramsden CJe·piece with equirnlent focal length of 1 incll (2.5 cm.). Tl.le length of the axis, e:xclnsi"rn of pivotR, is 18 inches (45.7 cm.). Tlie length of each pivot is 1-kinches (2.9 cm.), .and its diameter is 1 inch (2.5 cm.). The pirnts are of bell metal. They are remarkably regular aml W'ry nearly eqtial iu diameter, the correction to the level readings ueing only .020· in one and .000· iu t11e otl1er fostrnruent. Both pivots arc perforated; both are closed with brass caps, in one of which is a 1iiece of gla8s to admit the ligLt from tlte lamp to illuminate the diaphragm. "Thi:s illumination i:s h_y a wry small mirror in the centre of tlte axis. Attached to the frame by each V is a disk with four holes filied with plain, ground, re<l, and green glass, by which the illumiuatio11 rnay lie modified at tlte pleasure of the observer. The lamps are placml 10 inches (25.4em.) from the ends of tlte axis. TLe qnPstion of illumination h;r electricity was considered, but was found as yet unadvisable for field work. The telescope aml axis is black, and on one end of the axis is a bright baud b~- which the position ot' the axis is designated. There is no clamp 011 the axis; tlte telescope being nicely balanced, none is needed in longitude work. The diaphragm is of glass, upou which lines are ruled as follows:
A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ll B

\ 11 \ 11111

I!I I

The short inten-~lls arc nearly 2~ seconds, and the long intervals 5 seconds of time on the equator. If it is desired to obserYe by eye and ear, the five lines A, 3, 6, 9, B are to be used. In ob· serving on a chronograph, liues 1 to l l are to he used. A.JI tLe adjustments of this diaphragm are very simple, and the screws hy which they are mada are so placed tliat tliey can not be turned by accident. There is a clamp to hold the sidereal focus. The setting circles are 4 inches in diameter divided to !::0', and read to minutes by verniers They set to zenith distances.

Co.AST AND GEODETIC Sl-RYEY,

San Francisco, Cal., ~lugu~t 23, 1889. In 1852, under instrllctions from Superintendent Bache, 1 made a recon11aisrnnce for a base line on the Los Angeles plains. This ba.se line was for the development of the triangula tiou to embrace the shores and islauds of the San Pedro and Santa Barbara Chauueh, and for the triangulation hence to Sau Uiego. The location was made about eleven miles northward from San Pedro. The line itself was me,1sured in the spring Of 1853 by the ver,Y unsatisfactory bars (fmu-metre irou X os. 1 awl 2) of a. secondary base apparatus. T!Je ends were never more effecth·ely marked than I left them, when orderetl for special work in the channels between Vancouver Island and the mainland in June, 1853. In 1881 I was instrncted to make search for the marks at the ends of the base line. The easterly one was found intact; tlie westerly one required some time to find, because it had been maliciously disturbed, and was found under the surface, thrown oYer into a partial hole that had been dug to receive ir;, antl then the surface of the ground made level. I set the monument up, and measured the assumed base line twice with one lrnndretl-metre wire. I reported the condition of the ends; and, moreover, I recommended that the possil.Jilits of obtaining a larger base line, and one better related to the larger triangulatiou, propose(! to the southeast and to the northwest, should be examined. I felt satisfied the countl'j· was Je,'el enough towards Anaheim, but it might be that the land had come under cultivation an(l was improved. The surrounding mountains and hills were favorable for a good geometric development from a properl,y located base line in this vicinity. In 1886 I received instructions to hiwe the necessary reconnaissance and examination made; and Assistant Lawson was detailed for that work with Assistant Dickins and Sub-Assistaut l\forse. At the same time I went to the Uolurnbia River for azimuth work. Tile party found that a railroad hau been built directly througll the plains, and the country hall den·loped so mucli that the improvements and groves of trees compelled a selection within a, limitetl regiou. After an exhaustive examination of tlrn country, and a survey of the topography of the railroad from Norwalk to Anaheim, a line was selected. The topography of this line was executed by Assistant Dickins and Sub-Assistant .Mon;e. Pa.rts of the liue were so dcuscly covered with high, wild mustard that the line had to be opened for miles. The telemeter measurement of the base line made it li ,300 metres. The southeast end was near Kellogg avenue, that runs south from the north side of Anaheim ou flat, santl.r soil, then coverell with hog-pens, etc. The northwest end was on a slight ridge lying Iiearl.r east and west, aud one mile east of the town of Norwalk. It lay abontN. 310 W. compass. In no other direction or position,

-except mnch farther to the southward, could such favorable conditions be found, both for coming off on the triangulation and for openness of country. In 1\lay, instructions were received to discoutinne work after Juue 30. Iu 1888 I receh-ed instructions to be ready to measure the base line, and Sub-Assistant 1\lorse was Rent from San Francisco to examine "·lietlicr the line was yet open, and reported that it was. Penrling the passing of the appropriation bills, I had the measuring bars of the new primary base apparatus"' oYerbanled ant1 such 11efoct8 remedied as were practicable, and had tl.Jem compared wit Ii tlie field standard bar No. '.! for tilree days a ntl three nigh ts at the San Francisco latitude station at Lafayette Park. On tlie 4th of Octol,er J recei \"ed telegraphic instructions to measure tlle base liue. The party n-as immediately orga11izetl, au<l arriYetl under the charge of Assistant Lawson, at Camp Colonna, uear rni<lllle base, October lo, 1888.

OF THE LOS ANGELES BASE LINE.

\\"hen the line was located it was in Los Angeles County, and as tlle e:s:tensiYe plains were g-euerally knmrn h.r that name, it was applied to the base line. By legislatiYe enactment tlle l1on11dary of Lm; ..:\.Hgell·s Conut.Y \ms changed anll a uew county of Orange created from the south a11d t·ast part of Los .Angeles County. The limits of this county towards Los Angeles are as stated iu the fo,it-note.t The base liJw is therefore partly in Los Angeles County and partly in Orange County, aud as its direction is nearly :X. :1G'.) '"·and S.3G 0 E., it is not parallel or referable to any road, nor to the two railroads which it crosses. It lies about ten miles from the sllore of San Pedro Bay and is rouglllr parallel therewith. Tlie sotitheast end of the line lies in property ownetl by S. \V. Story, in "Pointdexter an1l Vicker'"' 1inLllliYision." It is in tlle nortlleast quarter of the southeast quarter of Rection 29, T. 4 S., It. 10 ff. aud about one lrnudred yards weRt of tlle Kellogg aYe1rne. It is one aud two thirt1s miles 8outh, along Kellogg aYenue from the southwestern part of the town ot· Anaheim.

FINAL LCICATION O"P THE LINE.

I examined the line and fixed the hrn eulls on the best rwailable spots for obsenations. At tbe southeast base tl1e eye bas to be elnen feet above the snrface of the ground before the ritlge at northwest base is seen oyer a slight rise three or four miles from the southea,.-,t base. I exam. ine<l tlie line iu its general features aucl found that much work "Would ha Ye to lie done iu huilding wooden structures on which to cross water courses, that woul1l be filled after the rains bad com· menced. Thegrounrl itself is generally a plain, witli a gentle slope t01>ards tl1e Coyote Creek, from the southeast and from the northwest bases. UYcr tl1is broad plain are slight ridges of onl~' a few feet eleyation, that act as lines for thro\Yiup: the drainage to slight depressions, wldcll mark old water courses and wLich gcuerall.r reacl1 the Coyote Creek. In some places there were moderately large areas of depressiou, without drainage; in snch cai:;es the rain-water was retained a long -while by tlle clayc·y mil. At the Soutl:Jcrn Pacific Hailrnad cros1'iug, the Coyote Creek had cut deep sloughs, and the lirws of (]rainage along the ruilrnad were i-;Jrnql d<'pressi011s six and eight feet deep. 'l'llese could llardl.r lJe a·oided by any reasonalJle cllaugc of the e!lds of the lille. I cxamitwd the g-eneral localit.Y or each end of tllr; base whicl1 had been selected lJ~· Assistant Lawson i11 188(); the temporary marks l1ad all ueeu destroyed, arn1 I rna<le a fresh choice~ differing iu eacll case hut little from il1e old line, hut some,Yhat l~·ng'the11iug it, autl set up temporary signals by whicl1 to adjust thf~ aligmnent. Tlie 11ortl1ern end of the line 11ov; passe::; diagonally oYer tlie Santa Fe lfailroall, which has been built sinct:> the cxamiuatiou of 188G, hurtllere is little difficulty here. The line passes tllrougll cultiYatcd fields, some of wlliclt were win>-feuccd so that eigl1t gates had to be provided. Much of the grouud hall IJe\'er been touched by tl.te pl01r. 0 rnr parts of tl1e natl1ral ground were hea\'.i" tussocks of eo:ir.3e grasses,\ not recog11izecl hy name, as tile fruetificatiou parts were gone), which required hcayy work with mattocks antl hoes to remoYe . .As in the case of the Yolo base line, no attempt was rnade to gratle the line or cn·n to surfact: it, except in lialf a dozen places, where sau<l or clay lrnmmoeks were cut tlirough; so tliat the greater part of tlie liue was in a state of nature, except the clearing ont of the tussocks and coarse grasses. The -work of cutting out these tnssocks~md coarse grassel:'o was slow, Lecanse the adobe .soil was as bard as clay can bake in a long season of hot, dry weather. The work of clearing the line was assigned to l\Iessrs. :Morse aml Nelson as occasion called for; the buildiug of all the trestle-work for cros8ing rrnter·wa:rn mid approacbes to the Southern Pacific Railroad was assigned to l\lr. vVest<lahl. l\Ir. l\Iorse built tl1e brick piers, for comparison -Of the bars with the field standard, at the two ends of the base alld at Camp Colonua. The general direction of the party was assigned to Assistant Lawson, with charge oYer the crossing of the water.ways, bridges, etc. · The aligning of the l1ase was made by cstaulishing the Davidson meridian instrument No. 1 on a slight rise about fom· miles from the southeast base station, because the haziness and unsteadi· ness of the atmosphere almost forbade obserYations for alignment from end tu end. E\'Cll at this middle statiou it was possible to get observations only a Yery short time after sunrise. The base was then aligned by Mr. Morse and myself, and two.iuch aliguiug poles were place<l about.eYery half mile or more according to circumstances.
Bl!ILDING THE BASE J>IERS.

I constructed the base piers to the surface cxactl.Y as I had tlonc for the Yolo hase line, and the subsequent witness marks were similar. At the "southeast base station" tl1e soil is a Yer,\· coarse, whitish sand, l,\·ing in a ridge two or three feet above the general level and about one hundred and thirt.i' feet wide. .As the oh;;en·ing pier at this station will require a height of thirty to tbirty-fi·e feet, I adopted the same proportions as that at the Yolo base. The sul>surfacc foundation is seventJ»two inches squa1·e at the bottom and is sixty i11cl1es below the surface. It is sloped in at the sides to fift.r·four inches square. In this mass of brick and cement is built a cube of granite twentr·six inches square, whose upper surface is flush with the surface of the ground. Two sides of the pier are close]~- parallel to the direction of the hase.

UNITED STATES OOAST AND GEODETJO SURVEY.

In tl11s upper surface is the marking of the end of the base, to be described. Below this foundation pier there is placell a granite block, squareil on top and three feet deep. 'l'he body is irregularly squarNl. The top of this granite block is three orfour inches below the bottom of the upper mass of the pier and it carries a subsurface mark, to be described. The piers of the northwest base station were built almost identically as those at the southeast end. The soil here is a reddish clay, that works Yery easily when wet, hut had to be picked when we opened the space for the pier. The granite block beneath the pier was fixed as at the southeast base. \Yheu the soil '>las being replaced around each subsurface pier one or two barrels of charcoal were mixed with the soil in tamping.
MARKING 'l'HE BASE STATIONS.

Four four-inch stuus, two feet long, "-ere dri'l'"en in the soil arouml the base station, not yet marke<l; two were in line, or very nearly, with the !Jase line, and two at right angles to it; each was about seven feet from the station. Upon tbe leveled edge of a broad, wooden straight-edge there was laid off" a length of seven feet each way from the center of a shallow gToove, which admitted half the plumb.bob line when banging. The seven feet marks were fixed upon each pair of tacks and marked so that the station mark was taken at the intersection. Then the hole for the pier was dug over fi\"C feet deep, and in the center of this a deeper hole to receirn the granite block to carry the subsurface station mark. Tlie round, copper bolts to mark tlie stations and for reference and recovery are fi'l'"e inches long, firn-eighths of an inch thick, with flat, spherical heads that average oue aud five-eighths of an incll in diameter. Into these heads is dri>eu a silver wire, about one-tenth of an inch in diamt>ter aud half an inch long. The tops are then filed, worked on a fine whetstone and burnished readr to receirn the station mark. Tlrn bolts were tls:ed iu the stones by pouring melted sulphur around tliem. The first marking of the s ta ti on was the subsurface granite block below the main pier. The mark was made by ham meriug a No. 5 11eedle into, or near, the center of the silver wire, in the tlat, spherical lieall of the copper bolt; the raised edge was then cut down with a fine stone, the nemlle again forced in, and the raiseu edge again cut down. This was repeated several times antl the top smoothed by a rubber until the mark was satisfactory. Tliis mark was quite circular, and appeare1l black in the surface of the silver; its a>erage diameter was about one-half of a halfrnillimetre The eenter could easily be read to one-tenth.the diameter with very slight magnifying power. The eopper bolt in the lower granite block was co-vered with a hemispherical, chemical evaporating glass dish, which was cemented to the granite. lllustration ~o. 20 shows the appearance of the lower block and marking: . A.fter the base of the subsurface pier bad set two days the twenty-six.inch granite cube was gotten ready for placement. To facilitate placing it closely in proper position two sectors. were fixed at distances of twenty feet from the station point, which was found by the straight-edge, one sector w;is in line, aml the other at right angles. Lest there might be any temporary derangement, a range-stake was set for each instrument at two hundred yards distant. The cube of granite was then placed closely in position; and then the copper bolt was sulphured into the block. The point of a fine needle was then pLiced on the silver pin, so that it was bisected by the vertical thread of each sector. .!\fade the needle-mark, and gronn<l tlie surface as already described. The hole marking the station is round and about two-fifths of a half-millimetre in diameter, hut it might be smaller. It is not in the center of the siker pin, hat nearer the northwest part of the circumference. At the close of all the operations this mark was covered by a hea,·y glass cover, cemented on tlie granite, and three courses of brick laid in cement over the top of the granite cube and mark. (Size 22 bricks.)

STATIO~.

221

The two stations at the ends of the base were marked in the same general manner, but the markings of the southeast station are here described as au example. To proV"ide means for recovering the station or for checkiHg any displacement of the surface mark after the high instrument pier is built, I placed two subsurface marks on the line of t!Je base arnl two at right angles to the west, as s!Jown by the sketch. The twelV"e-inch theodolite No. 131 was mounted over the station an<l directell towards the northwest ba,,_e station, but the signal could 11ot he distinguishe11, and tool>: tile range of basic' 011 the house beyondi which itself was somewhat indistinct. A corn crib prevented the placing of one pair of witness marks to the northeast, so an angle of ninety degrees was laid off to the south westward. Dug a hole three aud two- tenths feet deep; laid two courses of brick in cement; theu placed a twelve-inch granite cube therein and centered the silver pin in the copper bolt closely at one hundred feet. ·when the cube was ''set" a tripod with plumb bob was placed in the line of ninet~· degrees from the direction of the base line arnl a dot was made in the silver with a fine needle, as in the other markings. Tbe dot is round and has a diameter of about one-fourth of a millimetre. The horizontal distance of tllis dot from the station, rneasnred by a steel tape of fifty feet, is 100.003 ft->et. Then finished the brick-work arouud the cube, whose surface is eighteen iucl1es below the surface of the ground and just at the edge of the slight fall from the ridge of two and a half or three feet. On the head of this copper bolt is marked with a steel point, "S. ·w. Witness: J00.003 foet.'' The witness mark on the line of the base is at a horizontal distance of 100.100 feet from the station, and twenty-two inches belo\Y the surface. In tlie top of this bolt there is marked by a steel point, "S. \"V. \Vitness: 100 feet." Then the theodolite was remlffed from tlie southeast base station amlcarefully ceuteretl 01er the southwest witness mark and directed to a fine needle in tlle station mark. On this line at tPn feet from the station a hole was dug and tl1e masonr.r laid for the one foot cube, which was allowed to · ''set." A tripod with fine line was set up for aligning the witness mark aud for distauce. The dot in the silver pin was made by a, fine needle point; it is one-t bird of a millimetre iu diameter, aud lies at 10.017 feet from the station and in the line to the south west 100.003 feet witness mark. On tlie copper bolt !Jcad there has been marked by a sharp steel point, '' S. IV. \Vitness: 10.0:.! feet." The top of the block is about twenty inches below the surface of the gronud. The base line inner witness cube was placed in a similar rummer at a horizontal distance of 10.03 feet from the station. The top of the copper bolt was marked hy a sharp steel poiut, "X W. Witness: 10 feet." The top of the cube is eig!Jteen and a half inches below the Rurface of the ground. Before the earth was filled 01er the witness marks a strong glass was i1fferted 01er each and <iemented upon tbe granite. Tile placing of the witness marks at the southeast base station was directed by myself; those at the northwest base.station by Sub-Assistant Morse.

.METHE WIRE.

In order to control the number of bars in the final measurement of the base, and at the same time give turniug points for the leveling observations, the base line was measurell by Ai1l John Nelson antl Draughtsman Ferdinand 'Vestdahl. To establish a proper standard for the wire, I measure.d with the barR a distance of one lnmclred metres at the camp. The measuring wire was English steel nearl,y No.10 American gauge. It was wonud upon a large reel of thirty inches diameter. Upon each end there was fixed a double sleen Qfbrass. The inner one was soldered to the wire; the outer one with a square edge screwed oHr the inner one and was moved to any required position and soldered. In fixing the last sleeves the wire was strained by a seventy-five-pound pull through the spring balance, and the final ad· justment of the sleeve made when it was soldered. The temperature of the wire was noted. The aligning was done by the eye and without instrument. At e1-eQ' one hundred metres a .stub was driven in the ground and with copper ta,ck in the head ; t!Je tack was closely marked.

IIALF-KILo:IIETRE ::\IARKS AND TK\IPOIURY :HARKS ON THE BA8E LINE.

The Yolo \Jase liue was mal'ked by kilometre stones an<l also by stones placed at the fences. I dt'termined to mark the present !Jase line a.t every half-kilometre, wherever it was practicalill'. For thi;,; purpose thirty-four grnuite blocks were obtaiued 1titli a square head of eight inches awl an irregnlar body of thirty-six inches in length. Into each was sulvlrnred the usual fi\'e-ind1 ('oppl'r holt with flatteued hea<l an<l silver pin. _\. t the ellll of each one humlre<l lJars as indicated, without correction or reduction of any kind, t h1· tr<m8fl·r was made hy sector from the eud of the forward lJase bar to the siln·r pin. The mark \\:\.~ tlw n;;ual fine needle-point mark about one fourth to one-third of a millimetre in diameter. \\-lu:11 tlw mark had been made, the Jiual relation of the mark witli the en1l of the bar was made by !Jlt·a,;urillg with the sector all!l a millimetre scale the difference between them. In ,:omc case;; the soil W<l>i in such a, con1litioa from hea,-y rains, and in one case from quicksaml, that the tin' hurnlrell metre Ioeatioa could uot be safely made. So the granite block was pl<tct·(l at the ncare,.;t practica,ble position. ::\Jost of these IJ!ocks were placed from twelve to t>igliteeu inches below the 1'ttrface of tit!' Roil; but in some cases they are above the soil, especially along the north part of the ha,;e line an<l O\'er the alkali plain. The transfers were made by m.vself or ~Ir. ::\lorse, with ::\lr. Nelson at the sector, which was set up at a tlh;tanee of alJont twent;v feet at right angles to the line of the base at the end of the Lar. The temporar,Y markB were the same as those u:,;e<l in tlie Yolo measurrment.

A hole was scraped in the soil to the depth of tllree or four inches, and the block placed in it. The edge of the wedge was placed in the line of the bar and tlle fine referenct- lint- approximately locatecl under the end of the bar. 'rhei1 the earth was tamped aronrnl tlie block. The following operation wa8 then followed as in all tlie other transfers to station marks anJ to half-kilometre stones: An ivorr scale, divided to 0 ..'3 millimetre that had been tested at the Office, mls placed on tLe slight groove on the edge of the wedge, an<l a ~h-en lliYi8ion-in this case the sen·11 ceutimetre-wa8 made coincident rritll the reference line, under a magnifier; the scale was m~uk lt'n'l aut1 iu t11e line of the base. Tllen, with thl' st~ctor, the eml of tile bar was tnmsferrell tu tlte scale iu tlie following manner: Transit axis of sector le\·eletl auu telescope poi11tell to the end of' tlte bar, tlieu to the ivory scale, and the realliug recorded; telescope rHersetl in tlH' V's, traasit axis Indt·d, point to the end of bar m111 r1·;1il the in)r_Y scale; then reYersP tlle illstruuH·ut, le\"el transit axis, point to end of bar and read the h·or;-.· scale; re,,erse telescope in the V"s, transit axi,; l(·n·le(L point to end of bar a11d read the i\·ory scale. At each poiuting tlie coincidence of 7.00 linl' and the rt>ference line tested. Th~ sector had a delicate transit axis Jen~!; it was monuted npon a Yer,Y short-legi:erl tripotl, so that the focu~ of the telescope was equally good on foe bar and ou tlie i Yory seal':'. It wa :'; g'enerall;r at a distance of t1>enty fi·et from tile bar and at rig·b t augleR t11ereto. The 1JJagnit\iJ1g power of tlie teleticope was tweuty diameters. The collimation was usually Yery small. Tile spider-thread was '·ery tine aud the readings made to the teutli of a millimetre. Three of these granite block:,:; were in nse, so that 110 block was n·rnon·<l until another, or a half-kilometre block ahead bad been estab1ished; at such places as railroads aml bridge cro,;;sings two and sometimes three blocks were down at one time. The sector was al wa_rs used ou side of the bar iu each measurement.
THE MOVATILE COVER }'OR TIIE BASE APPARATUS.

The movable cover or teut under wllicb all tlie measures were made was tllc oue used ou tile Yolo base line, '\'\"itliont change. It was used to protect tlle bars from the direct action of tliP snn, from showers, from the driYing dust, and from tlie tluctuatiug force of the wind; am1 to secure the bars from injury at night aud during days of storm. In crossing one of the iieltls, plowed for the first time, where we bad to remove tlle great matted clods for space to lay the foot plates, we encountered a "sand storm,'' where the wind blew almost square!~· on the four llurnlred and fifty square feet of canYas with such fnrr and in gusts that it required the wllole fore(· tu hold dowu t.he movable cover, lest it sltot1ld be blown ornr the bars. The flying dust was frightful. and it reqnired two hours to measure forty bars. It was estimated that the wind blew thirty-fi\·e miles per hour in the gusts; when one of the bars happened to project. outside the eowr it was hlowu sideways on the tripod support. It is not necessar~· to describe tliis montble tent, because the details ha,·e beeu alread.'· ginn in the account of the Yolo base. It was fifty feet long, nine feet high, aull twel rn feet broad, arnl was mounted on four wheels. It was always pulled and pushed by four meu oYer ordinary ground, hut through the mud it required tbe assistance of all who conltl be spared from the hars. At night the four wheels were remoYed, and the long, side pieceis rested on the grouml; the entls were closed by canYas curtains and secured so as to afford entire protection from wind, raiu, and stray animals. '\Vhen we were at work the" standard field har 5 o. 2" mi.;; secnrell to the rail on the sliad.r side of the cover. On the Yolo base this cover was known as the'' Yolo buggy;"' here it was designated the "Caravan."
THE ORGA::.'UZATIO-"' AND ~lOVE:.VlENT OF THE PAUTL

The readiest way of understanding the movements of the party at work in the field i,; by an examination of the annexed plan (illustration No. 23) wllich differs slightly from that of the Yolo base measurement. The plan exhibits the bars aud tripods or trestles in position, and the tnice& of the men's forward movements.

224

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

As we actually reached a measurement of four hundred bars in one day, one hundred bars iu ninety-six minutes, and fre'luentl,'i· sen:-ral consecutfre bars in forty-fiye seconds each, it will he conceded that tho whole of the moYement of the eighteen officers and men must have had the regularity of machinery. Every officer and c·ery man had a specific duty assigned to him, and no deYiation was allowed therefrom. Ten of the twel>e men bad not handled the apparatus on the Yolo base, and to all the officers the actual' working was 110,·el except to myself. The general forward mo·ement really began at the command "Break," when the rear bar was ura'>'-n !Jackward with a slight back pressure, from myself. Tllis bar was then lifted and carried forward on the men's left sllonlders and placed in the two trestles awaiting it. Mr. Morse at the forward trestle and myself at the rear one receiYed the bar. So soon as the bar was off the trestles each trestle man relieYed the tightening of two of the legs, picked up his tripod, and moveu forward; each plate man gatLered the tLree plates and hnrriedl,r mon>d to tho front, where M:r. \Vestdahl bad a frame at the proper distance from the bar, at the angles of which frame foe plates were dropped for the rear and forward trestles. Tlien the tripods were placed on the plates, accurately distarict·d, aligued, leYeled, and clasped. No. 12 ordered the "c::traYan" forward so soon as the rear plates were lifted. As the plate men and the trestle men were moYiug rapidly to the front, M:r. Nelson guarded the legs of the rear trestle of the bar remaining in position. Tile details of raising and loweriug the after Pnd of the forward bar, aligning, making approxinHtt(~ contact, reading tlie Borda and mercurial thermometers, reading the sector, and theu "·hen all Lauds were off the uar, making the final coincidence under a magnifier, tell into their regular and ucccst;ary sequence. It was the earnest desire of each officer to guard against errors of reading scales, thermometers, and the sector; the cluty of the recorder to announce auy seeming deYiation from regularity of cllauge, aIHl of the chief tu call for any re-examination if he suspected mistakes. Tile form of record was clmngecl from that of the Yolo base, so that tlrn readings upon each bar were cousecuti\-e. The Rector reauings for each IJ:tr for the inclination were checkecl by a second obser>er, who first annonuce(l the angle and the first observer Yerified it, aud at the same time made a record to ch(·ck the recorder. The r('conier ver,v soon got used to the scales am1 thermometers which each observer was 1·cading, atHl as those on each bar and on the two bars differed slightly be saw at a glance whether anJ· misrealliag 11 ad been made. It will be uoticell that the bars were carriecl forwaru on one siclc of the line of trestles ; officers, ]llate men and trestle men remaining on the other, and no one was permitted to break the rule. At the close of the day the bars and the standard were put in position on the comparing beam, resting 011 two strong trestles, for the next morning's comparison, and lightly co·ered with can ms against rain beating through the light cover. At uight the watchman had a l1ammock swung under the "horse" that connected the beams at the wheels. Before the measurement of the day \Yas begun the bars were compared in two series with the field standard, in the conuition iu which they bacl remained ovn night; then the sectors were examiued hy the leYeliug illstrument for the determination of the zero of the inclination arc. The after crnl of the rear Liar was then plumbed O\'er thf~ previous night's mark, and moved in line and its height measnre<l; the forward bar was mo\·ed into position, the temperature, etc., of hoth bars noted, final contact made, and the command ''break" announced the forward movement of tbe measurement. The lunch and night marks, or any temporary marks, were covered hy a box and left intact until another mark had !Jeen secured. It will be seen b,\- the plan that the following personnel was absolutely requisite on the ground; there \\·as no extra force to make d n plicate records, or to make any reductions: Chief of Party George Davidson; Assistant James S ..Lawson; Sub Assistant Fremont .Morse.

FOOT-PL.ATES OF THE TRESTLES.

These plates are the same as those used at Yolo base line. They need certain changes which experience has suggested. The plates are laid independently of each other, and with practice the men became familiar with the best mode of setting them down. They were used on every character of gn·und, from the hard roadways to the quagmire, after the December storms. Each plate weighs nine and a quarter pounds, and the points are steel riveted on top. Tbej· can not be made lighter.
COMPARISONS OF TH~ BA.SE BARS NO:::l. 1 AKD 2, AJ\"'D THE :F'IELD STANDARD NO. 2.

I bad <.1emented brick piers built in the pendulum house at the astronomical station, Lafa~·ette Park, San Francisco, for the comparison of the bars with the sfatlidard. T!Je bars bad not been used since 1881 and hau remained at the sub·office, but the fielcl standard had been sent to Washington and returned. The field standard was examined and found in bad condition; oxidation had taken place between the zinc anu steel bars and there was no free mo>ement between them. The ends were in good order. I took out the bars and cleaned them thoroughly and replaced them. Then the wooden beam was covered with new sluice blanketing and a layer of tltrec-fourt!Js inch steam felting placed around it, and this covered with canvas. The contact ends of t!Je bars Nos. 1 and 2 were in good order. The mo,ement between t!Je zinc and steel was not free, lmt I took tllem out, thoroug!Jly cleaned them, and replaced them in good condition. The contact slides were not in good order and the zero lines anu contact slide lines were nearly obliterated. These I bad re-marked without appreciable change of zero. Then the beams were covered with sluice blanketing and three-fourths inch steam feltiug. This was tightly covered with canyas. A full series of comparisons was carried on hourly for three days and nights with one day and night intervening, and the :field reductions made. Independent piers carried the comparators. ·The range of temperature was necessarily small. The base bars and t!Je standard were then taken by rail from San Francisco to Anaheim and thence five miles to camp. Preparatory to makiug the first measurement of tbe base line, a series of hourly comparisons -0f the base bars and the field standard was made at middle base, Camp Colonna, extending through the day and night, to follow the law of the outstauding want of compensation and as data for any absolutely necessary reduction on that account. The party was too short.handed to keep up the field reductions, anu could not even keep up the duplication of the records. These comparison · No. l had changed its length in traveling, after the sevents· observations s!Jowed at once that Bar five hours' com11arisons at San Francisco. T!Je observations were carried through t!Jirt_y hours upon two dates, so as to cover the large range of temperature. Then the bars were removed to the southeast base, preparat-0ry to the first measurement, where a series of comparisons, extending through two clays and one night, was observed.
COMPARISONS DURING- THE BASE MEASUREMENT.

Every day before the observations of measurement, a double series of comparisons of the field bars and the standard field bar was made. This duty was never neglected, and upon one occasion, where a slight jar had been sustained by one of the bars, the measurement was stopped and comparisons made.

H. Ex. 55-15

226

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The weather, fortunately, became favorable after Christmas, and at the end of the first measurement, and at the end of tlrn second, I did not stop to make an exten<led series of comparisons, but pushed the measurement with tlie men working enthusiasticall.r; and the third measurement was fiuished before a l'egular series was undertaken. On the last day of measurement five double sets of comparisons were made at the end of the l,ase, and on tlie next day five 1loublc sets. .After these tlie bars were taken to Camp Colonna and sixty-one single sets of comparisons were made tluongl1 three days and two nights. Iu tliis last work the portable comparing beam was nsed, because it was found that by bracing the t\rn cross-pieces upon which the bars rested the trnns\'erse movement was mllch better than on tb.e piers, etc. The extra coverings on the base-bar beams were rather crowded, and improvements were tben, as before, suggested; IJut could not be carried out iu camp. Tb.is beam has been described in the Superintendent's .Annual Heport for 1882, page 146. ~<\.fter all the bars were brought to Sau -Francisco, observations for comparisons were not made, because they could not be used in the final reductions.
PLACING THE FORWARD DAR I:N POSITION.

This is the most llazardous operation iu the measurement, for sev-eral reasous: the bar men carry the bar on their left s!Jonlders antl delfrer the two ends to the two observers without seeing w!Jat they are doing. It has to be lifted high enough to clear tho uprights on the trestles ancl lo\lered nearly into its proper position. The obserrnr at the rear eucl goverus the distance from the rear bar, and lets it come down upon the knife edge as nearly as may be at the right distance from the rear bar. \Yhen lie receives the bat· he holds back the contact ~lille anrl covers it with the fingers of his rig Lt hand to saYe it from striking the rear bar. He al ways aims to have the distance between the two bars too great rather than too small. On the under side of the bar beam there is a brass plate with cross triangular grooves that fit into the knife edge. These mnst be reasonably close together, so as to avoid large movement of the bar by the screw at the end. If it is seen that tlie knife ~dge is not in the right groove, tb.e end of the bar is lifted yery slightly by the assistant and tile bar moved to another groom. The rear encl of the bar is raised or lowered until the knife edge is mitl way on the plane end of the rear bar. 'l'hen the order to move the bar in line is accompauietl by a movement of the l>ar lengthwise by the screw so as to have a naked-eye contact while tLe alignment is going on. Before the readings of the Bordas and thermometers are made, the forward bar is slightly vibrated by tlie observer making contacts, and the final contact under the magnifier is made under a slight vibration, which is repeated if there is any apparent necessity.
MOVING THE BARS INTO LINE.

Tbe plan used on the Yolo base was snbstantiallythat used on the Los.Angeles . .A steel rod five-eighths of an inch in diameter and about fifteen inches long had a coarse thread cut upon it for about ti \'e inches nuder the bar behind each trestle bearing. One end of this rod was loosely fixed to tbe cross-bar just below the bar. The free end had a cross-bft.r for turning the screw which was lifte<l up against t\J.e under side of the bar, upon which was fastened a steel plate with a longitudinal knife edge fittiug the screw threa1l a,ll(l placed at an angle equal to the thread of the screw. This knife edge, therefore, enterml one of the threads, and as the screw was turned, that end of the bar was neeessarily m1H·ed sideways. The methorl is all that is necessary, hut the details should be carried out better. For drawings of the application of tliis azimutli screw, see the Superintendent's Iteport for 1882, Appendix 8.
MEASURE FOR FRACTIONA.I. BA.RS.

The measures of the fractional part of a bar were possible only at the conclusion of the first and third and the beginning of the Recond measurements. The method and means employed were the same as those used on the Yolo base. The instrument for this measurement was as follows: The wooden part of the bar is of thoroughly seasoned white

UNITED STATES COAST A:XD GEODETIC SGRYEY.

cedar 0.05 of a metre thick, 0.113 of a metre <leep, and 3.225 metres long. In order to prevent warping it was split it1 two eq ttal i1ieces aull one of them turned 180?, and then they were securely fastened together. One of the lower edges was rabbeted out Sllfficiently to let iu a steel bar 0.0~ of a metre square; this steel bar was graduated to three metres, and each one of these metres was compared with a staudanl metre by means of a micrometer beam compass, especially devised for the purpose. Sliding on this steel lJar is ,-1; Yeruier with damps and slow motion. Ou tlrn side of the bar is an ordinary base-bar sector for measuring the inclination. In measuring tile fmetiou of five metres at the north west base, the zero of tile bar was placed o>er and in contact with the station point in the sil rnr pin of the copper bolt; then the vernier was moved until it came vertim1lly under the forward end of the base bar, as determined by tlrn transit sector. The whole metre was then read off subject to the correction with the standard metre, and the fractional part of tlie metre was transferred by a knife-edge beam compass to a standard metre scale to be read.
THE ALIGNMENT OF THE BARS.

The same arrangement has been followed as that which was originally proposed by me for the Yolo base. There is a small transit telescope at the forward cud of each bar, which is adjllsted over the centre of the bar, aml which is aligned with the bar by me11as of tlie pendulum hung on t.he after end of the har; several illlprovements are necessary for tlle better and closer adjustment of these telescopes. On the first measurement, the aligning of the bars was between the poles which had been put in b.r the theodolite aml which rangetl about one-half a mile apart. But in tlie second and third measurements the aligning was between the marks upon the half-kilometre stones. O\·er each of these marks a tripod was fixed aud a heavy plumb bob was hllng by a moderately thick line, such as the aligning telescope could see. The aligning over tbe bars was exalllined each morning and tilrough the day, if any necessity for doubt arose. The difference of measure between the first aud the second and third measurements at the halfkilometre stones was made by au irnry scale, diviaed to half-millimetres and tlle sector.
THE COMP ARATO RS.

The observations of comparison of the base bars with the standard were made with the tw<T Fauth lever-of-contact comparat-0rs, which accompany the apparatus. These comparators are described and illustrated in Assistant Schott's paper on the construction of the apparatus, Appendix
7, 1882.

The springs wete too weak, and means were adopted to strengthen their action, but they do not act through fully one-third of the range.
THE OPERA.T!ON OF .A. DA Y'S )'!EASUREMENT.

The method of measurement may well be illustrated b,v a succinct account of one day's operations: Everybody was called at half.past five a. m., no matter what the weather was. The party arrived at the field. about se>en or eight a. m., according tG distance. Roads very heavy in wet weather, and in many places no roa.ds. Inside the movable cover Davidson and l\forse commenced· a double set of comparisons between t.he field standard bar No. 2 and the field bars Nos. 1 and 2. These are all borne on tb.e comparing beam carrying the comparators. Tilis wol'k extended from twenty-three to thirty-eight miuntes. Edmonds was recorder. Nelson and Westdahl prepared the tripods for receiving the bar,,; t-0 test t,he sectors and alignment of telescopes and bars. After the comparisons of bars, the two field biirs were taken to the tripods aud tested for level by Nelson and Morse. Morse aml Davidson tested the aligning telescopes. It was very rare, indeed, to find an error of one minute of are in the sector. The movable cover was in the mean time raiseu on its wheels, the comparing beam, etc., removed to the wagon and the standard bar was laBhed on the shady side of the movable cover. The bars were then brought under the cover; the rear end of one, after fixing the contact slide at zero, was plumbed over the last night's reference mark by Davidson and aligned; the ·

:228

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

thermometers and the Bor<las of the bars were read, and then Nelson, at the sector, twenty feet off at right angles to the line, read off the difference between the end of the bar above and the ivory scale below, which latter is kept in position at the reference mark by Davidson or Morse, using a magnifier. Then th<> next bar was brought into position, the rear end in approximate contact with the front end of the first or rear bar and nearly in line, after relieving the contact slide which had ·been set. Davidson adjusted the height of the bar, and he and Morse then aligned it. Nelson was at rear end moving it in height and screwing it into line, and Morse was at forward end. Davidson read the rear end Borda, Morse read forward end Borda and forward thermometer, Nelson read rear thermometer, set and noted the sector; Morse read sector and announced it, and the check was recorded by Nelson. Then Davidson slightly tapped the beam and made the final contact under the magnifier. V{hile these operations were being executed, Westdahl set the third set of plates and tripods ahead; the men then returned to he at their stations at the rear bar. 'Vbcu these were read_y, Davidson broke the contact of the two bard, the two bar men drew the bar aft and then lifted it ou their slwuluers and carrieu it forward where l\Iorse at the forward end and Davidson at the rear enu lutd mornll ready to receive it. The tripod and plate men take tlie. rnlieved plates aml tripods aIHl move forward, with Nelson on guard at the aft.er tripod; the order to mo,·e the coYer is given as the last plate is lifted, and everything is moving forward at and about the same time, but iu proper sequence. Tilis method of measluement was repeated bar after bar until it was necessary to make a reference on the ground, either to place the half.kilometre stone in position or to fix: a temporary .stone for lunch, railroad crossing, or at the close of the day's work. Mr. Lawson attended and directed all matters about the aligning poles, bridges, and trestles, :railroatl crossings, compariug beam, iustruments, and supplies. At the close of the day the wagon was near with the comparing beam; the wheels of the mov·able cover were removed, the temporary mark placed in the gro un<I, and the transfer from the end of the bar to the mark in tlie copper stud was made by·the sector. The bars were then put aside, the comparing beam brought in and placed on the two supporting horses, which were leveled both ways; the standard bar placed thereon with a measuring bar on each side i the comparators adjusted, and e'·er,Ything left snug and safe. The bars were covered by canvas against rain, and were thus left in a conuition for comparison next morning. The reference mark was duly protected .and the watchman, who had arrived from camp, was put in charge, and the party left for camp, so .as to reach there about six o'clock. After dinner, l\1r. Morse computed the morning's comparisons, .Mr. Davi<lson attended to all oilicial correspondence, and l\Ir. Lawson attended to all camp matters.
THE RA.TE OF MEASUREl\IENT OF THE BA.SE.

The adverse nature of the ground and the inferior character of the base apparatus compelled a third measurement of ti.le base line. Yet this third measurement was made in a very short time, and it is believed that it exceeds in accuracy the second as tilat does the first, because the idiosvucrasies of the i11strument were understood and all the persons engaged in the measurement had ~cquired precision of movement and enthusiasm in doing good and rapid work. It is worthy of statement that in the measurements of the Yolo and Los Angeles base lines 18,991 bars were laid, and there was only one mishap in the cross-bar of the mo\·able cover touching a tripod (Yolo); one movement of the after bar to the rear without au order, but after the contact had been made; one upward movement of the forward end of the rear bar too suddenly, and one movement wllern I slightly toucl.ied ti.le rear end of the iucorning bar on the screw flange of the standiug bar. Tl.le following talrnlation gives in detail the time occupied ju each measurement of the base; and very clearly indicates the increased efficiency in the snccessiye measurements, a.Itl.Jongh some allowance is to be given to the first measurement where hea\'Y raius had made the ground a bog .in places.

INTRODUCTION.

Since the year 1882, when I first attempted to utilize the wl.tole of the coHected results of magnetic declinations, and tabulated and charted the same to exhibit their distribution within the boundaries of the United States, the material available for this purpose has not onl.r greatly increased, but permits much greater precision to be given to these researches. The table of results now presented exceeds that of the first edition by nearly nine hundred stations, and the means for bringing these up to a common epoch have likewise increased even in a greater ratio, as is shown by the rapid succession of new editions of the paper on the Secular Variation of the l\Iagnetic Declina. tion, of which the seventh edition appeared in the A.unual Report for 1887-'88, Appendix No. 7. The results of the researches in terrestrial magnetism by the Coast and Geodetic Survey have had a wide distribution of late years, nevertheless as they becollle better known the demand for the latest discussions is ever increasing and compels the issue of new editions embodying the latest

information as often as is warranted by toe accumulation of new material, or as often as may be ·demanded iJy the natural changes of the phenomena themseh·es. Not less urgent reasons for keeping the researches l1P to date, are the 1ieed of supplying the coast arnl sailing charts anrl other pu !Jlicatio1rn bJ· the Snrvey with the '· variation of the com. pass" aud with its annual change, and the obYions necessity of reconstructing from time to time the isogonic charts as their imperfections become apparent. By tt1king a short retrospective view of what bas been done by the Survey in adnmcing our Jrnowle<lge of this branch of terrestrial ph~·sics, and b~- comparing the result::; reached at different times we become further impresse(l with the slow but systematic changes in the magnetic conditions of the earth's crust and with the gradual recog-nition of the laws whiN1 apparently go,·ern the same-at least within our geographical limits. Tbe fin;t table of decliuation results accompanied by an isogonic chart was publishe(l b~ A. D. Bache, Su1wrintendent, aud ,J.E. Rilgard, Assistant, in the Annual R!'port for 1855, Appendix No. 47 and plate :No. 56. '_fhe declinations were reduceil to a common epoch, Yiz, 18:50, Ly means of assumed values of the annual chang~, and for conYenience of discussion the declinations were arranged in geographical gronps which could be separatel:; treated b~- application of Dr. Lloyd's inkrpolation formula.* The table comprises one hundred and fifty-three stations and the isogonic curYes computed for each degree of declination coyer but a. narrow strip along the coastline. In the following year the same authors produced a new chart, retaining, howe\'er, the epoch 1 FfiO, w; 111e rt-:,nlt of a n:ore extt-udul diseussion, inclmhe of all recn1t obserYatfons. (See Annual l{q1ort of J 856, .Appendix No. 28.) On plate :Ko. 61 of that report, the isogonic cu ryes fairly cover the area of the eastern part of the United States a>; well as the area bordering on our Pacific coast, and a connection is shown over the Gulf of 11Iexico and along the l\'Iexican boundary. The curve 8 we.re com pared with those resulting from Gauss's general theory of terrestrial magnetism, t pn blished in 1838. The a nrage epoch of the data nsed by Gauss is about 1829 and the authors notice the accord of the form of the curw·s with those covering the same area but resting on observations up to 1850. Comparisons were also made with the Barlow cl1art in the Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., 1833, (Part II, p. 667 arnl following) an<l with Prof. E. Loomis's chart for 1840, Sillimau's Journal Science aml Arts, Yol. XL; the latter shoul1l be noted as the first detail chart extending some distance into tlrn interior of tlie country. Lieut. Col. E. Sabine's chart for 1840 (Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., 1849, Part II, Jl. 173 arnl following) exhibits the distribution of tbe declination over the .Atlantic Ocean and was of al'sistance by IlOinting out the direction of prolongatiou of the isogonic curYes IJear and beyonil the coast-line seaward!:'. The Annual Heport for 18G1, Appendices Xo. 23 and No. 24 contains two small isogonic charts (plate No. 30) designetl for a special purpose and in rid of navigation along our southern coast; epoch lSGO. The Annual Report for 1862, .Appendix No. 19, gi·es an account of a magnetic survey of the State of Permsylrnnia, and on plate No. 47 sbows iso-magnetic lines laid clown for the two epochs 1842 and 1862. This was the first attempt for a State Magnetic SnrYey; though meagre in obs~r vations it was not followed until recent times for Missouri and New Jersey. The Ilext isogonic chart, constructed h,v the present writer, accompanies Appendix No. 19 of the Annual Report for 1865, plate No. 27; it is on a larger F.cale but covers about the same area as the chart of 1S56; it emhodies, howe,·er, the results accumulate·l and uses the latest information TespeMing the secular change. The epoch is 1870. The chart next issued, report for 1876, Appendix: No. 21, plate No. 24, is due to Assistant J. E. Hilgard. It is referred to the epocli 1875, and includes the results of the Survey up to 1877, and in part to 187D, as well as about two hundred rece11t observations made from 1871 to 1876
·Proposed by Dr. H. Lloyd, of Dublin, in 1838, see eighth report of the British Association for Adv. of Sc., Vol. VII, Jl. 91 and following; see also note by Archibald Smith in Lieut. Col. E. Sabine's contribution to terrestrial magnetism, No. YII, in Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., Part Ill, 1846, p. 248 and following. t In hit! general theory, Gauss UBed twenty-four coefficients depending on obsen-ations distributed, as regularly ·aa may be, over the i:reater J>art of the accessible smface of the globe, and including decliuations, dips, and intensities. A later attempt made by Erman and Petersen (Berlin, 1874) to introduce into this theory additional material ,and to reduce the same to the epoch 1829 by a strict account of the Recular variation has not resulted to any marked -degree in a.uy essential change in the curves as originally given by Gauss.

under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences and at the charge of the Bache-Fund. In this chart the isog-onic curves are S[Weatl over the whole of the United States, excPpting Alaska, and distinct notice is taken of certain large. irregularities in tlrn distribution of magnetism which obtrudeu themselves in some ea!'ltern and central parts of the chart, the curves over the western part remaining smooth and regular. Di.~tribution of thu olfagnetic Declination for 1885.-This publication, brought out in the Annual Heport for1E'82, AppendixNo.13, has been designated our" first edition" on account of its completeness, a special chart for Alaska and adjacent regions being included. The arrangement of the table of results is alphabetic li.r States, with two su b·diYisions in each, one for Coast aml Geodetic Snrve,,results, the other for results from all remaining available sources; the table contaius 2359 station,,, a!lfl the results are charted on two large maps (scale 0 0 -0 1, 000 ), one for tlle east.em, the other for the western part of tlie United States, anrl a third one (scale -ia- -nhiooo) embraces Alaska and alljacent \vaters. On the two-sheet map the isogonic cun·es were constructed hy a graphical process, but on the smaller one their position depends upon an analytical formula. As far as the accumulated material permitted, special notice was taken of all locally disturbell regions in the direction of the magnetic needle, and the extent and amount of such local deflections are shown on the chart. It had been rather customary to exhibit the distribution of magnetism h.Y regular curves, and such geometrical representation was even regardeLl by some as a true exhibit of facts, whereas, iu reality. the cur>es are distorted and assume irregular shapes through the effect of local irregularity of distribution extending, say, over a few square kilometres, as well as from greater deYiations spread over many square degrees of surface. Tl1e former tlefiections are difficult to distinguish from errors of observation, but the latter can be recognized by the concordant results of all obserYations within the region and by their systematic de\'iations. .l!'urther stimulus was given to this subject b~· the recent magnetic surYcy~ of the State of .Missouri, which was aided by the Coast and Geodetic Survey with the loan of a magnetometer and a dip circle. Tbe isogonic curYes on the map of Alaska do not exhibit these irregularities, since they are the result of computation; further, it must be supposed that the distribution of magnetism is more regular O'\Cr ocean areas than oYer land areas. 'rhe following paragraph is retained unchanged from the first edition: Prominent among those who ha\'e made local magnetic disturbances a special study were Dr. John Locke) in this country, and tile late Dr. Lamont, iu Germany. In the spring and summer of 18±!, Dr. Locke examined experimentally into the local distribution of magnetism about the Palisades, New Jersey, and presented hi;; results in diagrams of isoclinic and isodynamic curves.t Dr. Lamont, in a work entitled " l{.esearches of the direction aud iutensity of terrestrial magnetism in Northern Germany, Belgium, Holland, and Denmark," executed by Dr. J. J,amont, iu the summer of the year 1858 (Munich, 1859), gives analytical expressions of the effoct ofa gi>en disturbance on tile direction and intensity experienced by a magnetic needle, and diagrams of tile consequent deformation produced in the isogonic, the isoclinic, and the isodynarnic curves over the perturbed region. Since these formnlm do not appear to be so well known as their importance deserves, and on account of their instructive application to the iso-magnetic curves, I give here a free translation of part of the con tents of page 2 l of the preface. Suppose a magnetic sout4 pole of intensity, r, Yertically below the point A on the earth's surface, and at a depth equal to unity, and it be required to determine its effect upon the magnetism at a second point, B, on the surface distant from .A equal to r and in azimuth c/· reckoned from magnetic north round by west, then the effect of the pole P at the point B will be

where H = the horizontal force and 11 = the dip. These formu1m are approximations, but quite close enough for the purpose iuteuded." Applietl to a case in .:\IitlUle Europe, Dr. Lamont shows that the curves of horizontal intensity to the magnetic uorth and south of the ceuter of disturbance are bent inwards or toward it, and that the cun·es of equal declination to the east and west of the distnrbance are bent ourwards or away from it, wherca:;; the curves of equal dip are bent sonthwarrl, directly over the point of disturbance, as well as to the north of it, also up to a certain diRtance to the south of it. Supposiug the iso-magnetic curYes OYer a disturbed region given by obser·atiou, tte position of the point 011 the surface Yertically above the point of disturbance, that is, its latitude and longitude, may be found from the disturbed declinatio11 and intensity curve><, and the depth of the point of disturbance from the dip curves, the intensity of tiJe disturbance being determined by the an1ount of beudiug of the curves. After commenting on the highly instructive nature of the application of the formul~ when thrown into curves, he remarks: "It is, however, not ti> be imagined that the irregularities iu the magnetic cur·es are produced by <L >;iugle pole of disturbance, such its has been supposed above, but rather by a series of such poles forming peaks or ridges of disturbance.'' 111 fact, tbe distrilmtiou in space of disturbing poles am! their intensities must be taken as indefinitely v-ariable, and their joint effect may give rise to a g-reat variety of deformations. '"To follow them 11p to their source in any special case would necessarily require obsernttions at a great number of points closely packed over the region irnder itffestigation." To illustrate tile use of these formulm, I have applied them to a disturbed region, anu assnmiug the positiou, depth, aud intl'nsity of a magnetic pole, have computed the deformations of the i:sogonic, i:-wclinic, and iso<lyn<tmic cnrrn;,; for tile purpose of comparing them with tlieir correHpunding curves as !leduce<l from obscrnitious. Tlle region selected is in Southern Vermont, and the computation is made for ip=43no, il=72no, at which place tbe declination D = + up, the rlip (1=7 4n°, and the horizontal intensity in Britisll units H=.1.:10 for tlle year 188.1. The distances apart of the iso-magnetic lines under the supposition of equable distribution of magnetism were taken from charts, as well as their azimuths, as IHesented 011 the diagrams of the ace ompanying illustration (No. 24. ), where these respective systems of lines are shown by dashes. The disturbing pole is supposed to be GO kilometres below the surface (a little over 37 statute miles); its magnetism is assumed to be of south polarity, the same as that of the northern magnetic hemisphere, anu its iutensity is supposed equal to one-fortieth of that ol' the horizontal force. With tllet;e assumptio11s the formulre give the theoretical deformed curves as shown in full lines on this illustration, and it will be seen that these disturbed systems of iso-magnetic cLir\·es conform, with respect to curvature, to what has been stated to hold for Central Europe; also that the deflections of the dip curves are less in amount than those of the horizontal intensity and of the declination. Tile maximum deflection nearly approaches half a degree for the declination, 0.030 (Brit. units) for the horizontal intensity and seven minutes for the dip. This would indicate that the above assumption as to depth and intensity of disturbing pole is quite a moderate one. The diagrams are drawn to scale and the disturbing effect upon tile direction of the horizontal needle is still perceptible beyond the region included within the area of a circle of radius 160 kilo· metres (nearly 100 statute miles), and a comparison in this region of the curvature of the theoretical or'disturbed isogonics with the actual curvature of the isogonics as derived from observation an<l given on tlJe cha.rt, indicates a general conformity, which by suitable changes in the assump· tious might he more closely approximated. :\Inel1 di!licult,y was experienced in tracing out the isogonic lines on the Pacific coast, amt in general o\·er the area west of the one hundred and fifth meridian; in this part of tile country

<>bservations require to be greatly multiplied, aml some time must necessarily elapse before the law <>f the annual chanee can become better known-remarks which remain true for the present edition. Magnetic surveys of a countr~· may be pursued in two ways, either by continued slow but gradual additions, year after year, or by couceutrated efforts during one or at most a few years, but repeated at rather long intervals, say of a quarter of a century, more or less. The second method is but slightly dependent on the secular Yariation, since for any one survey the reduction to the mean epoch will always be small; it is otherwise with the first-named method, which demands as complete a knowledge of the secular variation as can be had. In consequence of large extent of the United States the first method is the one properly and necessarily adopted, whereas in less extended countries, such as for England and for one or two European continental States, the second metbo(l has been followed. It is, however, of greater importance than the above distinction to keep up at some central station a continuous registry of the changes iu direction and intensit~· of terrestrial magnetism, and after a series of years to shift the station to another region least known magnetically. Thus the Ooast and Geodetic Survey has accumulated most valuable material in Florida, \Yiscousin, Ualiforuia, and is about to include Texas-a branch of inquirj' into the laws of magnetit;w which does not further concern us iu this µlace. We come now to the special expositiou of the contents of the new edition of tllis paper sliow ing the distribution of the rnag11etic declination for .January, 1890. The collection and arrangement of tl.Ie obsen·e1l declinations form one of the moBt lahorious parts to be gone through in the preparation for a new edition of the distribution of tue declinations, the other parts being the reduction to a common epoch and the platting and chartiug of the results. The collection of obsernd declinations comprises all statious occupied withiu the boundaries of tlie Unitea States with a limited geographical flxtensiou over adjacent regions iu order to facilitate the graphical represeIJtation of tbe results. The table contains comparatively few stations datiug from a time earlier than the preseut century, and in all cases where a statiou has ueen repeatedly occupie·l only the latest or that nccffest the epoch 1890 has been given. The table comprises 3237 stations and its coutents are arranged as follows: (lt) The observed declinations are given for eacll State anrl Territory for the United States and for suitable geographical subdiYisious for adjaceut regions; the classification b~· States and divisions is alphabetical, with the foreign parts appcu<led. (b) For each State or division the material has been suh-dfridetl into two groups, oue being wholly composed of Coast and Geodetic Survey stations, the other being derived froru all other sources whatever. (c) The declinations in each State, division, or group are arranged according· to the latitude of the stations. The contents of tlie se\·eral columns of the ta\Jle are sufficiently indicated in a general way lJ,r the headings and need but little additional or detailed explanation. Tile columns headed <p aud A girn the latitude and longitude of the station, respecti,·eJ,,·, to the nearest minute of arc, au accuracy sufficient for our purpose. .:\.is given iu degrees and minutes of west 101111:itmle from Greenwich. The date of ob8ervation t is expressed by the year aud tlPeimal fraction, as near as knowu. The plus sign in the column of <leclinations I> signifies iccst declination, the minus sign th.e contrary. The values presented in the column headed LID are the reductions reqniretl to bring the observed declinations np from the time t to the epoch .January 1, 1890. To effect this a special set of auxiliary tables was prepared, derived from my researches of the secular Yariation, ll as published in the .Annual Report of the Survey for 1887-'88, .Appendix No. 7 (\Vashington, 1889). For every secular variation station there giYen, the declination was computed for eYery year between 1850 and 1890, and for every tenth year for dates prior to 1850; a table of differences was next formed between these values and that for 1890, with a sigu prefixed so as to give at once the reduction to the epoclJ 1890. These ta\Jles of differences were placed side by side for stations
*Known as the seventh edition.

forming a geographical group, so that tlte doitble interpolation for time and space could readily be effected, first by running the eye over the horizontal line marked with the particular year and next by noting the chauges in its \alues due to poRition of stations. Allowance was then made for the relative position of the station in question. The values in tliis column (LID) are due to l\lr. L.A. Rauer, of the Computing Di·dsion. A sign indicates increase of westerly declination or decrease of eaklterl:; declination, a - sign the reverse; where blanks occur, the reduction to the common epoch either was deemed too uncertain or information was altogether wanting. ..1.t first it was contemplated to reduce all obserYatious to tlie year 1895, but it was soon found that for a large part of the countr.r (main1y that lyiug west of the l\Iississippi) tile secular Yariation was too imperfectly known for any safe reduction to this advanced epoch, and 1890 was chosen for the ep11c!J as preferable in point of accuracy. 1u the last column of the table headed "References" certain abbreYiations were used of which the principal ones are gi·en below. The addition of (S. V. S.) to the name iudicates that the station is a secular variation station aud consequentl~· that the ·alue D 1890 is taken from the seventh edition of the researches referred to abo>e.

CONSTRUCTION OF 'l'HE ISOGONIC CURVES.

The resulting declinations for 1890, as given in the preceding table, form the basis of the mag·netic chart; the positions of the stations were plotted on two large maps on a scale of one fivemillionth and the decliuations set down in red ink; for this labor I am indebted to Mr. L.A. Bauer. "The isogonic curves were next traced out with a free hand, first roughly and afterwards carefully, in accordance with the principle already referred to--on the one hand not to ignore the greater features and regions of local deviations from regula-r distribution, and on the other not to fall into -error by following out defective values or verJ' circum8cribed local peculiarities. How to distinguish one case from the other lms been explained, yet with all the experience gained on former occasions it was no very ~a~y matter and frequently very embarrassing to settle finally upon the best location or form of the curve, and such uncertain or unsatisfactory parts are indicated on -the chart by broken lines o-r dashes; the same broken curves are shown in regions where the sparseness of stations left much doubt as to the position of the curves. For the sake of uniformity with the magnetic charts of dip and intensity published in Appen·dix No. 6, Annual Heport for 1884-'85, the isogonic curves were transforred to the base-map of the Unitecl States, scale one seven-millionth; see first magnetic chart appended {illustration No. 25). The numerous obsen'ation stations and corresponding values could not be shown on this scale, as fo some parts they would wholly cover the paper; the curves are drawn for every degree of declination and every fifth one is marked heavier for better distinction. Whatever imperfections tliis chart may possess they can only be removed or lessened by the acquisition of new and reliable observations. To render the chart useful for other years than the one for which it is constructed, the leading -values for the annual change of the declination, as given in Appemlix No. 7, Annual Report for 1887-'88, have been transferred to oar third magnetic chart {illustration No. 27), showing the magnetic meridians. These values refer to 1890, but may be applied without sensible inaccuracy for five or more years; the -rnlues answering to the year 1895 may also be found in the above-mentioned report.

:.DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAGNETIC DECLil'i.ATION IN .AL.'1SKA .AliD ADJACEST REGIOXS LY 1890.

Since the first attempt made by me in February, 1883, to express the distribution of the magnetic 1leclination in Alaska and adjacent waters for the epoch 188fi, hy a single analytical function, but little additional information could be obtaine<l, and consequently no great improvement in our knowledge of the distribution of magnetism in this part of the United States coul<l be expected. A few recent observations in and near southeastern Alaska bave been added to foe collection ·of data and our knowledge of the seculiir variation in this region has been slightly advanced siuce 1883, but the general treatment of the material remaius a>; in the first editiou. The observed declinations made use of in this paper were taken from tbe pH'('etling general ·collection J?f observations as reduced to the epoch 1890. To form suitable normal Talues they were combined into groups, selected with respect to geographical position to conr as nearly as may be the whole area uniforml,y, and tlms secure a satisfactory determination of the se,·eral co-etlicients which enter into the function of distribution. These groups or normals are necessaril,\- of Yer,\· -unequal value, primarily <lue to a deficiency of observations. The number of observations range :from one to fourteen in a group.

For th.e purpose of establishing an interpolation formula for the computation of the magneticdeclination at any place within the area of Alaska and adjacent parts, we consider the observed rnlues (arranged in 34 groups) as depending on their geographic .· ! position, that is, we take the· declination D to be a function of the latitude <p and of the longitude A. The distribution of the declination may then be expressed b~· the following formula, adapted to a spherical 1mrface :
D=Do+r · .dcp+s. L1A. cos <p+t . .dip2+u. L1<pL1A cos <p+v, .dA.2 co~2 cp +w. L1<p3+x. L1<p2.d?t cos rp+y · .dcp.:112 cos2 cp+z. L11 3 cos3 op+ etc.

where

~f::;f_Ji.~0

}

and r, s, t, etc., are unknown numerical co-efficients

to be determined by means of the observed declinations. Terms involving powers of Llcp and L1Ai higher than the third are not needed. Put cp0 =580 and 10 =1600, which are nearly the mean values of the 34 latitudes and 34 longi-· tulles respectively; also take D-0=D1+q where D 1 = -210, an approximate value, and q a correction thereto for the central value D 0 · Then the observation equations take the following form:

where for shortness, <p1=Ll<p and A. 1=L1A..

The comparati\·e smallness of these differences (0-0) indicates not only that the representa· tion of the obsernltions is a fair one, but that the latter 'seem to have heen reduced with some success to a common epoch, as is shown by the distribution of the changes of sign; there are 16 negative and 17 positive sign!'!, one of the differences being zero.

we get

'\'a\ue which we accept as very satisfactory, considering that in each case it is made up from, or subject to, four distinct sources of' error, viz: 1. The error of observation ; 2. The error in the reduction to the epoch ; 3. The error due t-0 the imperfection in our algebraical formula; and, lastly and principally, 4. The eftect of local detlections a.nd other irregularities in the distribution of magnetism which cotlld not be taken into account by the general formula. This last source alone would b ~ sufficient to accmmt for any or a.ll of the differences shown in our comparison, and it is highly proba.ble that the other sources combined contribute but a small part to tlie total amount. 'fhere remains the construction of the isogonic curves, as shown in the accompanying chart {illustration No. 26); in other words, we have to find from our expression a sufficient number of corresponding values of latitude and longitude for any one proposed declination curve-the value -0f Dis thus fixed, and by taking for <p, as an independent variable, any suitable value the oorre;a,

We take <pas the independent variable for positions where the isogonic line makes a large angle with the parallel, but take A. instead in case this line makes a small angle with the parallel. Below we give a few corresponding values, thus computed, for some of the leading cun-es, there being no advantage in tabulating all the roots that were needed for the actual construction of the cur,· es.

.Along the central part of the peninsula of Karntchatka our system of isogonic curves touches upon tlrnt peculiar feature in tlle distribution of magnetism which shows an area, oval shaped, of west declination entirely surronnde!l br east declination, and within which space the <lecliuation rises to 'io west. This feature is snhject to secular variation, and consequently is in a continuous state of change; it sePms to have formed in the present century and may not yet ha rn reached its fullest development. In 18!0 tile maximum declination within the oval was a little mon· tbau 5° an<l tl.ie eastern limit of the agonic curve then passed through the sea of Okhotsk, which makes it probable that within the past half century the whole system has drifted slowly to the eastward· The chart itself is sufficiently explained by its legend.
MAGNETIC MERIDIANS.

The ordinary method of charting obser>ed declinations is that of drawing cur>es of equal ·angular deviation from the meridian, which are kuown as isogonic cur.es; this representation, though a wholly artificial one, is so ewinentl~.. practical and directly aclapte1l to the ueeds of the surveyor and navigator that another, and, from a physical stand-point, more iuteresting and instructive mode, is rarely resorted to. The conception of" magnetic meridians" is due to Euler, who, shortly after the middle of the last centur,Y, treated in a short digression from one of his magnetic inYestigations bis so-called "magnetic routes," i.e., curves on the earth's surface, the tan· gents to which at any point coincide with the direction of a compass needle placed at that point;
·Since writing the above, Vol. II ofthe "Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of J apa11," Tokyo, .Japan, 1889, has been received; it contains an account of a new magnetic survey of Japan, carried out by order of the President of the University, l>y C. G. Knott and A. Tanakadate, in the year 1887. From this pul,Jicatiou we learn that the earliest (native) magnetic surYey of Japan was made by Iuo abcut the beginning of the present century, and that his charts made at that time represent the magnetic and geographical meridians to be identical in direction, and it is further remarked that there could be no doubt that the average declination in Japan in Ino's days was zero. He completed his geographical survey between the years 1800 and 1818. About that time then the southeastern boundary of the oval was lying acl"Olls Japan, whereas in 1887 the system had so far shifted as to bring the isogonios -0f 410 and 50 W. over the main island. At Tokyo the annual rate of increase of westerly declination between the years 1860 and 1882 was found to be 3'.3, which, when carried back to lno's time, woold produce zero about the year 180'.!.

these curves Euler prefers to the Halleyau lines for the purpose of 1·rpresenting certain magneticphenomena. These Eulerian cur¥es thus show the directions of lines of magnetic force (horiwntal component) on the earth's surface; they have no direct relation to the geographical meridian~, anu consequently dq not pass through the geographical poles like the isogonic curves, yet, with these~ necessarily converge towards the magnetic poles (of vertical dip). We ha\e here represented a physical fact, namely, the actual direction of the horizontal magnetic intensity. A general chart of this system was published by Uaptain Duperrey in 1836, and two illustrations of it on a small scale will be found in Sir G. B. Airy's Treatise on Magnetism (London, 1870). The distance between any two magnetic meridians is arbitrary. Duperrey also traced a series of curves which are ill e>ery point normal to the preceding; this second system of curves he denominates "magnetic parallels." Their utility, however, is not very ob'fious, and it suffices to mention them here.· In their place we find in Airy's treatise, curyes of equal dip or the isoclinic lines, which, it may be seen, have a strong tendency to intersect the magnetic meridians at right angles, and the same may be said of the isodynamic cnrYes of the horizontal intensity. TIJ'8 introduction of this second system in connection with the magnetic meridians has some bearing on the designation ''magnetic latitude" sometimes given to the magnetic dip. On the third chart (illns'tration No. 27), appended to this article, are exhibited the magnetic meridians allll the present annual change of the declination for the epoch 1890. It is supposed that this 1s the first illustration of magnetic meridians specially delineated for the United States .. The fifteen meridians, or lines of horizontal force, laid down on the chart were constructed directly from the isogonic cnr>es; the length of each step for which a new direction was taken up averaged about 70 statute miles, or, on the scale of the map, 11 mm, This, as will be noticed, produced a sipooth curvature, notwithstanding the irregularities inherent in the isogonic curves. The distance between the meridians is arbitrary; it has been made equal as measured along the central horizontal 'mtensity curve. There are also drawn on the chart three curves of equal dip and three curves of equal horizontal intensity for the year 1890, from which it would appear that tile isoclinic cun-es more nearly approach to normal intersections with the meridians than tl!e isodynamic curYes. The interval between the dip lines is 50 and between the iutensity lines 0.04 dyne; the irregularities exhibited by these cun·es are due to irregularities in the distributiou of magnetism. The magnetic meridians, like other magnetic curves, are subject to variation in time, but this change iu direction will be less marked to the eye than in the isogonic system. On this chart there is also inserted for con;euience of reference the annual change of the declination for a number of stations for 1890, but the gi;en change may be used for several years to come; for full information, however, the reader may be referred to Appendix No. 7. Report for 1887-'88.

Report by HENH.Y L.

l\IARINDIN, Assistant.

U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, · Wnslthigton, Jfay 10, 1889.

Sm: With. the data obtained by the party of Physical Ilydrograpby in my charge <luriIJg the' season of 1887 and 1888 on Cape Cod, :Massachusetts, we are now able to make comparisons and show the changes which have taken place in the shore and bluff lines of this part of the Cape since previous surveys, and thus add to our knowledge of the physical history of the Oape, the study of which was initiated by Assistant Henry :Mitchell in 1871 (see Appendices No. 9 iu the Reports of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1871 and 1873). In the following comparison the coast between Ohatham and the Highland Light-house at Truro was subdivided into three sections (see illustration No. 28), each of which had been surveyed at different times. The earliest reliable survey was made in 184-8, and the most recent before the last was made iu 1868, so that the shortest period elapsed between ans two surveys is nineteen years. · These three sections, incidentally divided, show separate characteristics. The first or southern section, 6 miles in length, surveyed iu 1868 and 1887-1888, comp11ses the shore from a point about 1 mile north of the inlet into Pleasant Bay to the inlet into Nausett Harbor and Town Cove. The second section, 4 miles in length, surveyed in 1856 and 1887, embraces the shore from the inlet into Nansett Harbor to the Nausett Three Lights. The third section, 14 miles in length, extends from Nausett Three Lights to the Highland Light in Truro. This was surveyed in 1848 and 1888. It is to be regretted that the older hydrographic surveys give so few soundings near the beach that a comparison of the "submerged apron" could not be made; therefore, in the computations of" quantity" of material moved we have considered nothing below the plane of mean low water, and we have assumed that the seaward slope of the bluffs, which was not determined iu the earlier surveys, was the same as now, but the high-water line and the bluff line, where it exist,s, give reliable data for comparison. In the first section the crest-line of the beach (highest water line) shows a mean recession of 159 feet in nineteen years, or 8 feet per year. The volume of material moved was 3,095,219 cubic yards; of this amount ~,107,831 cubic yards have entirely disappeared from the shore, resulting in an annual loss of 110,938 cul.lie yards, or 18,489 cubic yards per linear mile of coast-line, and 987,388 cubic yards merely shifted in position, going partly to build out the southern extremity of Nausett Beach at the entra.uce into Pleasant Bay. Between the southern limit of' the space compared above and a point 2! miles above the present-entrance into Pleasant Bay, the shore-line has advanced into the sea from 0 feet at the north·· ern limit to 1,100 feet at the southern end.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

By consulting tbe accompanying sketch (illustration No. 28) a clearer idea of the changes will be gained. Of the second or central section, between Nausett Harbor Iulet and Nausett Lights, we have two surveys, one in 1856 by Mr. 0. T. Iardella, assistant, and one in 1887 by the party in mj· charge. 'fhe comparison sho\'l"S a mean recession of the shore-line of 8 feet in thirty-one years, or at the rate of a quarter of a foot per year. The amount eroded \'\"as 1,158,652 cubic yards; of this :amount 264,491 cubic :rnr<ls have simply shifted position, ·and the balance, 894,161 cubic :yards, bas disappeared entirely, giving au annual loss of 28,844 cubic yards, or 7,211 cubic yards per mile of coast-line. In the third section, from Nausett Lights to Highland Light, we ha:ve again two sun-eys, one made in 1848 by l\Ir. II. L. Whiting, assistant, and one in 18'38 by the party in my charge. The mean recession of the shore was 128 feet, or at the rate of 3.2 feet per ;year, and shows a·cut for tile entire distance amounting to 30,231,038 cubic yards, or 755,776 cubic yards per year, which giYcs 53,984 cubic yards per linear mile of material woved. Upon inspection of the volumes of material eroded per linear mile each year, it will be noted that they differ widely. In the first section the loss is 18,489 cubic yards, with a retreat of the high.water line of 8 feet per year. In the second section the loss is 7,211 cubic .rards, with a retreat of tl.Je high-water lirie of a quarter of a foot per year. In the third section the loss is 5:~,984 cubic ~-ards, with a retreat of 3.2 feet iu t.he high-water line. If we compare loss in are:i we find that the southern section loses yearly 0.8 of an acre for each linear mile. · The northern section loses 0.3 of an acre, and the central section, surrounding tile Nausett Lights, loses only 0.03 of an acre each ~·ear per linear mile. There might be au explanation of the above results in the theory which is held that somewhere in the vicinity of the Nausett Lights there is a division of the tidal forces; i. that south -of tlie Lights the resultant oi the forces of the ebb and flood currents would he southerly, while to 'the north of' the Lights the resultant would be northerly. This I believe has not been demonstrated by observations, and nothing short of a systematic series of current observation.s along this coast would tend to settle the question. · .Summing up the changes 'along the entire length compared, we find that 32,233 7030 cubic -yards of earth and sand have disappeared. This volume can best be understood· by supposing it ®posited on a sqnar.e mile, which it would cover to tL deptll of 29t feet, or bj· substituting the 55 .acres included within the Capitol Grounds in Washington, D. C., which it would cover to a .depth of 375 feet-in other words, the Statue of Freedom on the dome of the Capitol would be buried to a depth of 67 feet. In the sketch is shown one cross.section in each of the three divisions (plotted from Table 2) ; these give an idea of the character of the shore and bluffs. In many places the highest seas at high tide wash the foot of the bluff, while in others there is a wore or less wide beach with a .crest and a gentle rear slope to the foot of the bluff. Going from the inlet into Nausett Harbor towards the" Highlands of Truro "the height of the bluff increases irregularly from 34 feet (above mean sea-level) at the point first named to 65 feet at the Nausett Lights, and to 159 feet at cross-section No.137, a short distance south of the Highland Light. At the Highland Light the bluff is 122.9 feet above mean sea-level. These bluffs have all a steep foreslope, generally at the angle of repose of the material composing them. These angles of slope we have computed from the actual measurements made on the ground, and they are given in the following table, together with other data useful fur future comparisons:

Compiled and computed by H. P.

and E. E. HASKELL.

The material composiug the bluffs is almost wholly s<ind, with here and there a stratum of blue clay cropping out, notably between sections 77 an<l 80, where the clay runs from the foot of the blu:tl:' (at 77) to half-way up the face of the bluff at section 79. This blue clay is also found at cross-sections 94: to 99. At the Nausett Lights the sands of the bluff seem to be coloretl by iron oxides, but to the south of this point, notably on the sandy cordon which forms the sea barrier to Nausett Harbor, these sands are very white and have the appearance of haYing been washed b;y the sea and then thrown up a.gain to form tile barrier mentioned above. This part of the Cape offers a wide and interesting fit·l1l to the geologist. In preparing this paper we have omitted much of the data obtained <luring the season. This will appear in the report which follows this paper as Appendix: No. 13. Yours ~pectfully, HENRY L. MA.RINDIN, A.BBistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

APPENDIX

NO. 13.-188 9.

CROSS-SECTIO,NS OF THE SHORE OF CAPE COD BETWEEN CHATHAM AND THE HIGHLAND LIGHT-HOUSE.
Report by HENRY L. l\:IARINDIN, Assif<tant,

U. S. COAST .A.ND GEODETIC S'C'RVEY, . Newton Highlands, April 3, 1890. The accompanying tables of cross-sections are submitt~d as a part of tlle results of the Phys-ical Hydrographic Suryey of Cape Cod, instituted in 1887. Among the ohjects aimed at one was to obtain an accurate mold of the exposed shore of Cape Cod for present use in determining the amount of waste or fill since previous surwys~where tltc surveys are sufficiently detailed for this purpose-but the more direct object was to provide a haw for future comparisonR, which will be of value to geologists and others who study the changes in the coast-line. 'I'he cross-sections are numbered consecutively from 1 to 143, beginning at a point near the entrance into Pleasant Bay at North Chatham and countiug northward as far as Highland Light (also called Cape Cod Light). The sections will average one for each 300 mttres of shore-line, with the exception of a part of the shore near Nausett Lights where the bluffs are high and rugged and where the.)' were placed about 150 metres apart. The plane of reference for the heights is mean sea-level, as derived from a series of observations of the tide made by the party of Lieut. J. E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, at Chatham in 1886, and supplemented by other obserrntions made by the party in m,y charge at the same })lace in 1887. These two independent series of tide obserrntions gave very close results for the height of mean sea-level, but as the series observed in 1887 was tlle longer one the height derived from it was accepted and was found to be equal to 40.51 feet below the Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey Bench No. IV, on Chatham North Light-House. This })lane was carried from section 1 to section 143 by means of two lines of precise levels,. run in opposite directions, and referre<l to numerous bencb-marki:; located at suitable points along · the shore. Each cross-section stancls by itself, and can be reproduced on any chart b;y platting the position of the origin, "Which is expressed i.n latitude and longitude, and by laying off the azimuth as given in eooh table.
EXPLANATION OF THE TADLES.

The number and year noted above the upper left-hand corn~r bas reference to the field number and the year of survey. In the first column is given the distance frQm the origin. This distance is given in metres, and is measured from inland seaward as far as the soundings were taken on the section. In the sec.;oncl column are given the elevations above and depressions below mean sea-level in feet and tenths; all above the plane are plus and all below are expressed by the minus sign.

UNITED ST.!.TES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

In the thir<l column are given, first, the latitude and longitude of the origin, then the azimuth '(true) of the section. This azimuth is reckoned from south around by west to south, oo to 3600, The compututions of the cross·sectious were made by Messrs. E. E. Haskell and Homer P. Ritter conjointly. The accompanying sketch (illustration No. 20) shows the approx:irnate position of each cross· .section with the location of the hench-ma.rks. A descri1>tion of the bench-marks is gi\·en in Ta!Jle A. Respectfully submitted. HENRY L. l\fARINDIN, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Suruy. To Prof. T. C. MENDENHALL, Superintendent.

RECENT CHANGES IN THE SOUTH INLET I~TO EDGARTOWX HARBOR, MARTHA'S VINEYARD.
A
report by HENRY L. ""',VHITING, Assistant.

'VEST TISffCRY. Dl:KES COFNTY, MASS., August 15, 1889. SIR: I present herewith a report on my recent resurvey of the Routh opening or inlet into Edgartown llarl:wr, on Marti.m's Vineyaw, au<l also of the changed location of the dry i<hoal of" Skiffs Island" lying off the southern entrance of Mnskeget Channel.* This latter feature wa:3 not included in the original scheme of the pre~ent resuney, but finding· it denote11 the resul taut~ of important tidal and sea-wave action so near this channel-way, I ine1mlt;(1 the aett>rmination of it~ 1)resent position in connection with tl1e changes in the south inlet of Edgartown Harbor. There has been more change in all of thl'se features of the coasr th;rn was anticipaterl, although those that have taken place are in accord with the predictions base<l on our knowledge of former chauges and the laws which seem to go,ern and produce the normnl "set'' of the tidal currents along this particular section of the shore, as well as the preYailing sea-dash. The degree of change, however, has been greater, as before remarked, than that which has occurred in formrr corresponding periods of time. To what influence;;; these more rapid changes and moYements are due, I have no data to present in explanation, unless it be the less substantial uature anll condition of the beaches themselves, and, possibly, e.-en prohal.11.r, the more than ordinarily Yiolrnt storms of the last year. The lwavirr breakers upon this beach have tended to cut dowu tlie sallll J1ills and smaller bluffs which characterized the. previous cornlition of the beach, so that it ha;; been more subject to overflow, and this, in turn, has left the sands in a less firm and compact statt·. Between the last resurvey of this inlet, by .Assistant w·. I. Vinal, in 1887, and my last resurvey in June, 1889, an interval of about two years, the westerly chop of the inlet has workl'tl eastwardly about 3,450 feet, and the eaRt chop of the inlet about 3,750 fret in the same direction, leaving a present width of inlet between its on ter chops of about 2,0.50 feet, against the width of 1,650 feet in 1887. In the present opeuiug·, howc,-er, a saml bland bas formed, or remaimi as part of tl.ie -0rigi11al beach, near the westerly point and lying within and lap11i11g lly it to the westwanJ, .rm that there are now two channel-ways of access into the bay and harbor withi11. It i;; interesti11g· to note that this condition of the inlet resernl.Jles that which existed at the time of onr tirst snrYP_\". in 1846, and also that shown by Des Barres in Ins surYe~·s of 1776. We are al.Ile to account for the present condition of the inlet from the facts of its formation, which was canscd by a new opening to the west of the older one, lea ring a section of the original beach betwet'JJ them. It i,.; a remnant of this section of the beach which constitutes the small island alloYe referre<l to. The outer westerly point of the inlet will, undoubtedly, continue to lliOYe east1rnnl, arnl will probal·ly be beaten inward by the sea. dash until it unites witl1 tile sand isl.and, and thus closes the smaller DE.A.R

westerly channel-way.

UNITED STATES CO.AST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

It is reasonable to predict, in view of the past movement of these beaches and the forces acting on them, that nature will repeat itself, and that the easterly point of the inlet wi11 move eastward past the" Wasque Bills," so calle<l, leaving a long canal-shaped passage-way between an outer beach so formed and the fast land of Cliappaquiddick. Perhaps this long passage-way will extend to the easterly line of Chappaquiddick, as it did previous to the closing of the former inlet i11 1869. There is, however, more liability now than theu'of a new opening breaking through at points along the main beach, which is much lower than it has been for many yeans. In my own experience there bas been uo time since 1846 when the whole extent of beach a~ross the face of Ootamy Bay-a distance of about ~~ miles-prisented so feeble a barrier against the ocean waves and breakers as it does uow. This fact suggests the question of the consideration of artificial means-by wind hedges, etc.-of building up the beach to a height that would helter resist 01· prernnt the heavier breakers from dashing entirely over it, as they probably would do iu its present condition. Tlie mass of the beach which has formed across the site of the inlet of 1887 is about 400 feet outside-seaward-of the alignment of the former beach, while east of the present opening, the former beach has been cut away to abon t the same extent. The extreme easterly point of the new iulet has been beaten in, and partially fills up the former southea1>t corner of the bay. The general position of the shore-line of "\Vasque Point remains nearly the same as in 1886. The easterly face of Chappaquiddick near the point has made outward-eastward-about 100 feet. The change in position, size, and shape of Skiffs Island illustrates quite markedly the forces of wa>e and current action on such exposed sandy shoals. The result is interesting and important as demonstrating the instability of such material in such localities. While the mass of sands forming the large extent of the shoals of which Skiffs Island is the summit and easterly head, as it were, are kept m general place by tlie complicateu forces pecnliar to this locality, they are ever subject to local changes. .At the time of the survey of 1886, Skiffs Island bad become so much larger and higher than it bad been for many previous years that it led to the suggestion of means for its more perm a neut preservation, yet during the interval of the three following years it has been entird~· swept away as an island above high water and been again thrown up above that level, lmt in another place. The main mass of the island is considerably west of its former position, the general distance being about 225 feet. Its present area is but about one-third of its size in 1886. I state these particulars of change because of the physical conditions and influences peculiar to this locality-phllnomena which have already received so much attention and consideration. In bis able reports" Professor :Mitchell has stated the peculiar physical relations of the tides of the Vineyard and Nantucket Sounds to those coming upon the south shores of the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, and the circulatimi of currents through Etlgartown Harbor and the former opening in Cotamy Beach. I will not, the1·efore, discuss these subjects in my report. It scerus 2 howm·er, pertinent to remark that the quesi ion of controlling these elements by artificial means is one of much uncertainty and grave importance. The unsuccessful expenditure by the General Government of $22~000 in attempting to open a south inlet into Edgartown Harbor which natural forces afterward effected, is a fact of much significance as bearing on the question of the expediency or inexpediency of such undertakings. I append hereto a traciug from the field-sheet (illustration No. 30) used in the last three sur· veys in order t.o show for your more convenient reference the changes referred to in my report. Very respectfully submitted.

RESULTS OF SPIRIT-LEVELING BETWEEN TIDE-WATER AT ANKAPOLIS, MD,, AND THE CAPITOL BENCH-MARK AT WASHl~UTOS, D. C., FRD:ll OBSERVATIONS I:\' 18~;) BY F. W. PERKINS, ASSISTANT.

Report hy C. A. SCHOT'T, Assistant.

CoAs'r A:ND GEODETIC SrRYEY OFFICE,

Computing Dil'i8ion, Jla1·ch 20, 188!l. At tiJe time this leveling operation between Annapolis and \Yashington was carried on, it was intended that it should serrn for tiJ·~ basis of tile heights of the stations of the primary triangulation in this vicinity,* w hicll stations had been connected b~' measures of zenith distances. For this particular purpose no yerJ' high accuracy in the levels was needed, but when in 1877 it was decided to carry into effect the plan of running a line of precise or geodetic levels across the countryt along the thirty-ninth parallel, from ocean to ocean, the highest accuracr attainable in such an operation was called for. At tlte same time it was seen that tLe Anuapolis-Vi~asltiugton line could be included with great all vantage as au independent link to conuect the propOSl'll trauscontinental line with tlie Atlantic, or what comes to the same thing, with the Ultesapeake Bay level. It was also found that the acm1racy of tlte measure was just sufficient to make tlw result acceptable for the new application. (JI.Jeck tidal obsen'ations, howe>er, were required, and these were supplied, incidentally, by Lieut. M. L. Wood, U. S.N., in 1888, while engaged on a hydrugraphic resurvey in the vicinity of Annapolis. Before this time Washington had already been couuected l1y precise le>els with Hagerstown, Md., and thence with Sandy Hook, N. J., forming a junction of 359.70 statute milesf (578.87 kilometres) from tide-water at SandJ· Ilook to Washingtpn, D. O. The particulars of the work are given under the usual heads, as follows: Observer and date of leveli1ig.-The obserrntions were made by F. ,y, Perkins, Assistant; also a side line from Annapolis to trigonometrical station Taylor was le\·eled, aud a second side line from trigonometrical station 'Wilson to Hill, the latter line by J. De Wolf, aid. Le,·eling commenced November 9 and terminated December 15, 1875. Assistant J. B. Weir leveled between the Navy-Yard and the Capitol at Washington in June, 1880, ancl again ia June, 18SJ. Route of levels.-The line starts from a benub-mark near the Annapolis tide-gauge, follows the Annapolis railroad as far as Odenton; thence bs the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad via Bowie to the Washington Navy-Yard. The Navy-Yard flag-staff station was subsequently connected witll the newly ( L884) established bench-mark at the Senate wing of the Capitol. Distances lev· eled over from Annapolis to NaY,r· Yard, ": ashington, 60.837 kilometres; thence to the Capitol,

2.343 kilometres; total, 63.180 kilometres; making the length of the whole circuit from tide-water· at Annapolis to tide-water at Sand;\· Ilook 64.2.05 kilometres, nearly 399 statute miles. Connection with the lwlitide /ei·cl (If the ocean.-The width of the connection of the At.lautic· Ocean with the Chesapeake Bay, about 11 miles across the entrance, the depth of the water of the bay aml its general straight direction, and the paucity of slloals, h;lamls, or other obstructions in the direction of propagation of the tille-waVf,, render it tolerably safe to assume tliat tlle average levels of the ba;\· and of the ocean outside are one and the same. At Annapolis the waters of the ]iarbor are iu free communication with the ba;,-. The .A_tlantic tide rolling into tlrn bay requires about 01· 13m to traverse the 148 statute miles between the Capes ancl Annapolis,* and is accomaanied l>y a <limiuution of the average range of the tide from 2.8 feet at the Capes to 0.8 foot at .Annapolis. \Ye have two series of tidal obserrntions at Annapolis a\ailable for our purpose; the first by. Assistant F. W. Pbrkius uegan November 24 and ended December 18, 1875; the second by Lieut. :\I. L. \Yood, I:". S. X., l>egan August 16 and euded September 18, 1888. These series were reduced allll discussed in the Tidal DiYision of the Office, and the results were communicated by .Mr. A. S ·. C!Jristie, i11 charge of that <li>ision. "\Ye have accordingly:

The angular distance of the horizontal extreme lines was determiued on Nonmber 4, 1875, at distances of tlie staff of 50, 100, and 150 metres, and found
·It does uot appear that the fo1mula for the Telocity r of pro~agation of a freo wave in water of depth11, Yiz, applies to this case, since U.e calculated depth p comes out but 3 fathoms, whereas the. average soundings make it auout 6t fathoms. t The influence of the annual inequality of the tide in height was at first not suspected, but became manifest when the t"'o results for mean level, as independently derived in 1875 and 1888, were compared. Mr. Christie then furnishecl me with the monthly ordinates of this inequality, as found from one year's observation at Old Point Comfort, \'a., 'II' here. its semi-amplitude amounts to 0.35 foot. t The Tidal Division also communicated the following Talues: From 262 high waters and corresponding low waters obsern<l iu lt3.J4, rise and fall (or range) 0.88 foot-Lient. G. S. Blake, observer; again, from 106 high water8 and 10:> low waters observed in 1852-'53, rise and fall 0.86 foot; and from 52 high waters and 50 low waters obs~rn<l 11y W. '"· Harding in 1870-'71, rise and fall 0.87 foot. The mean rise and fall from these several series iB0.83 foot, which is probably the smallest range on the bay, the gradual contraction of its width and the diminution iu depth towards the head producing a corresponding increase of the ranges. It is a noteworthy fact that the tidal wave takes Tery nearly twelve hours to traverse the who]., length of the bay, so that we have simultaneously high water at the entrance and at the head of the bay; and this will probably explain, by the principle of reflection and ofinterforence, the difference noted in the observed small velocity of propagation of wave and the Telocity appar·· ently, by theory due to the average depth oftbe water. The length of the wave is abont 185 statute miles.

to equal 33' 12".5; the valne of one tlivision of the level was 5". [This instrument has since been converted into geodetic le-.cl No. 1, and is now kuowu by the latter designation. J Method of observing.-Tlie staff, which was metrically graduated, was directly read off by the observer for each of the tliree focal lines; the inclination of the telescope was determined by means of foe spirit-level; the distance of the instrument from tile staff was on the arnrage 100 metres, . aud forward and backward sights were equidistant. The whole line was leveled twice, independ· ently, once in a forward and once in a backward direction. Computation anrl re.mlts.-The field computation was made lly F. W. Perkins, the office computation b_y E. H. Courtenay, and the probable error was deduced b;r L. A. Bauer, wlio also prepared the abstract of the results for publication.

.ACCURACY OF THE PRECEDING RESULTS.

Estimated in tue usual way, we find the mean and probable errors as depending on tb.e differ-0noos in height of the several bench-marks in the forward and return measures as follows: From -comparison of results at thirteen intermediate marks we get the mean (square) error of a singlfl leveling in one kilom:tre m, =

~~~[:dJ

= ± 6.52mm, the probable error of double le.elingof

-0ne kilometre r,, = ± 3.llmm, and the probable error of the resulting difference of height for the whole liner = r 11 ¥ff= ± 24.2mm. To this must be added the probable. error of tile adopted average sea-level as derived from the tidal observations. This can only be estimated, and may be taken = ± 25mm; hence, resulting height of bench-mark at the Senate wing of the Capitol at Washington as deduced from the Annapolis line, 27.618 ± 0.035 metres, or 90.Gl ± 0.11 feet .

Si;ll' rnrk, :\'. r., Oc. rr l!I. 1&8\l. S1n: I beg to subUiit a report of the work of the Ilydrographic party rn ,er my coUimand \lnriug the past two seasons in iuYestigariug tht· Gulf Stream cnrrents. The winter'11 seasou of lSbS \ms denited to an examiuation of the w.-it1:rs r nteriug thP Carib· beau Sea, arnJ permission was grnnte1l by your iiredecessor to coutiuue . '.:·' 1eseard1 of these cur· rents during the present year, in order to obtain all llitioual data hen ring upon 1be snl1j1'l°t before dra\\·ing eonclnsious as to the circnlati011. The labors of the party iu soutlteru waters were ended in _.\.! i'il, in order to take ad·;-antage of the good weather of ~lay and June for obsernltion,; off Cape Hatteras aud Xantucket Slrnal:-. The ,·essel left New York .January 7, 188U, tmYi11g the Coast Snrn·y schooller R((uly to Hampton Hoads, and, upon arriYing at the Anegadn Passage, Jauuar;y 19, be1Jan the ohsen·ationt', which were contiuued with but slight i11tt::rrnptio11s until the eud of the fbcal year. The weather while iu the Caribbean was almorrnally good, the trades were light, arnl tbe seas cornparatiYely Slllootb. The month of May in northern waters was also exceptionally fine, but in ,Tune but little work was executed, and that uusatsfactory. The manner of obsen-iug tlie cnrrents lias been the same this seaso11 as in the last, no change having been made in Pithpr thr anchoriug gPar or current meters. \Yhile en route from Key \Yest to Cape Hatteras an (·xtra a11chorage was made in the Straits of Florida off Powey Hocks for the purpose of rnaki11g a test of the currents, 011 a prediction based upon former observation. Before leaving Key ·west I wrote the following Jlfe<liction for ,;\pril Vi at the proposed place of auchorage in the axis of the stream: "Day's a\·erage .,;urfacc cnrreut, about 3~ knoto<, var~·· iug between 2~ and 4 knots. Strong·cst current about 5 p. m.; slight ri:>e iu wlocity at 4 a. m." Tlle observations were as follows: Time of maximum rclocity, 4.21 p. m. A Yerage of the "slight rise" in wlocity, 4.01 a. m. Greatest velocity, 3.41 knots. Least n·locity, 2.22 knots. Average velocit;y for the day, 3.01 knots-a di;.;agreement ht~tween the actual and predicted velocities of about 14 per cent. The current cunes of this anchorage are shown on illustration So. 41. EleYen anchorages ha,·e been made outside the Caribbean Sea during the t\\o seasons. One north ofBarbadoes, No. 32; two east of the St. Lucia passage, Kos. 20 and 21, and t'ight anchorages between Barbadoes and Tobago, numbered from 1 to 5; all within the limits of the e<1uatorial stream. At the anchorages most distant from the South American coast the flow was more nearly in the direction of the tracle-winds and tlle Yelocity less than was found nearer the South American coast. The strongei,it set is fouud close to Tobago, aud here tlie direction of the upper stratn. is inclined well to the 11orthward. Anchorage 4" made this year eonfirmed theobser,·ations of 1888i and also showed the counter or tidal current, which was found iu the first season in several instances. At

It seems to be apparent that the subcurrent was chiefl.r tidal; that the thickness of the stratum iucreaseLl and decreased, and prolmbly its direction continued to change to the rig·ht tllroug-h tile entire circle. The e'l'idence of this tidal action was foun<l last year at most of the stations where the lower current cha11ged at times to SE., but at no time was it so marked as to show successh·e changes in the directions. The temperatures of the various stations north aml south of Barba<loes are shom1 in the tahle llelow:

This shows a slight]~- cooler surface temperature at the northerly thau at the southerly sta· tions, but th.is diftereuce is not greater than what miglit be expected at any station on different days. The differences at the lower depths, howm·er, are Yery noticeable, and furnish direct evidence ,of the influeuce of the South American coast on the moYing water. The equatorial stream impinges on the coast, aud the colder water from the lower depths is pllshed upward on the slope of its sl:.iores, loweriug the normal temperatures at the various tleptlis below 65 fathoms, and at times ewn at 30 fathoms. Another instance of this was seen in the passage bdween Cura<;oa and tLe main-laud, where an eddy imbcurrent came from the westward between Oruba and Cura<;oa. 3y;

After leaving the l~tter anchorage, wllich was in 4~5 fathoms, surface temperatures "-ere taken on a course across the passage from about tile 100-fatllom ciuve 011 the main land side. At tilis point the temperature was ao, but it qnickl~- cilauged to 780 as deep water was reached. The eddy sulJcurreut evidently pushed its way up the slope, lowering e'en the surface temperature. In the equatorial stream, as stated before, the directions of the upper strata change towarcl the nortil as we approach the Sput!J American coast. It is evidently a resultant of a gentle current to t!Je westward in the average direction of thr wiml, an<l a stroug curreut setti11g alo11g t!Je shore, receiving its final direction from the general course of tlrn coast-line. The former it-;, I uelie\e, due to the friction of the trade-wind on the surface of the water. The latter cmTcnt Yaries in velocity greatly, and is made up of the part of the wind current impinging on the sl1orn a111! of the water which is thrown to leeward b;r the sea until it reaches the oustruction whence it must escape liy the line of least resistance. A portion probably finds its escape by a counter subcurrent, and a portion augments tlrn shore surface current. At times this current eutirely m·ercomes the normal frictional current in the passage to the west of Barbadoes, aud a ttaius a nlocity of three or more knots, but it seems to be only after the trades ha\""e been lilowiug with unusual se,-erity. Station 32, alJout GO miles north of Barbadoes, was \Yholl.r within the "gentle flow," and seemed to be uninfluenced by the Soutil American coast current. Station No. 1, south of Barhadoes, '"1as apparently a resultant of the two; tlle surface currents to 30 fathoms <lepth being nuder the influence of first one current arnl then the other, while the lower strata were coming from the southward.

It is seen from this table il.iat at this time tile surface tlow was to the northward and westward, but deflected slightly by the current from tlle eastward wltich occupied tl.Je intermediate stratum. Tltat at 65 fathoms it was tidal, but influenced by tlie westerly surface current to deflect the normal directions of the ebb aud flow to NNW. and S\V., the mean being \i~. hy N., and that at 130 fathoms depth the eddy current out of the Caribbean caused a deflection of its normal ebb and flow to NE. by N. and S., the mean being ESE., which is exactly opposite the surface direction. At Station 21, about 15 miles farther east, only two observations at each depth could be obtained on account of bad weather; but they were >ery interesti11g as showing an indicatioh of the same. The directions were, at 3~ fathoms, WNW.; 15 fathoms, NW. by \V.; 30 fathoms, IV. by N.; 6.3 fathoms, WSW., and at 130 fathoms, S. by W. Steaming to Barbadoes the same day, and back to St. Lucia 36 hours later,"R current of :.l1 knots or more NW. by N. was found bJ dea<l reckoning. At Barbadoes it is said that the stronger tlrn trades tbe stronger the current to the uorthward and westward, and for some time before this occasion they had been blowing abnormally strong. There seems to be a strong current at all times along the Tobago Island shore, liut when its volume is small its force is not felt far to the northward. It will be noticed that the directions of these surface coast currents, continued in the same courses, will e>entually impinge 011 tbe outside of St. Vincent and St. Lucia. If they were of great volume, the velocity of current in the St. Lucia

Passage would oe ver~· great. Instead of this, however, we find, with a fair surface current, an ebb and flow into and ot1t of the Caribbean in the lower strata, but predominating outward below 100 fathoms. An examination of the current curves of this passage shows that atStation 10.-The current w.1s west (into the Caribbean), es.:cept at 130 fathoms, where it was tidal, flowing in and out. Station 10a.-The same. Station 13.-Current fiowing into the Caribbean with about the same nlocity down to 30 fatlloms, at 65 fathoms tidal, and at 130 fathoms flowing out.

An anchorage \rns made this year on the outside edge of the Grenadine Ba11k, :ua\ the current was found to be setting to the southward, varying between ff\Y. and SE. In 1888, in the passage uext to the southward, between Grenada and Trinidad, it war; flowing out of the Caribbean in the deep water portions. This year it was found to be the reverse, except at 65 and. 130 fatlloms, where, as will be seen below, tlle current was tidal.

Between Martinique and St. Lucia a surface current was found flowing in, but a sufficient outward flow at the lower depths to deflect the currents at 65 and 130 fathoms. Probably in this i)assage the curreut predomiimtes to the eastward below 150 fathoms. It is probable that at times, the current lea\ing Tobago Island after unnsually strong winds, may be of sufficient strength and yolume to reach St. Lucia, and cause an inward flow in the passages on either side reaching the bottom, but ordina rilr this will not be the case. Between Curai;ioa and the main-land three anchorages were made. At all of them a westerly surface ftow and au easterly counter current was found, as will be seen in the table below.

It is evident that in the southeastern Caribbean there is an eddy current setting to the eastward at the lower depths, and it reaches the surface at times. The passage south of Grenada probably carries most of the \olume of water escaping from the sea, and each of the near passages farther north assists, but with lessening amounts. The eddy, I think, will be strongeet after strong trade-winds have been blowing for some time; for, under such circumstances, the coast portion of the equatorial flow will be large in volume and great in velocity from the escape of the water thrown to leeward, and as the direction of its escape is nearly at right angles to the "gentle fractional" part of the equatorial, the latter will be overcome and the eddy produced. A certain amount flows to the westward between Tobago and Trinidad, but the passage is narrow and shoal, and while the velocity is considerable the volume can not be large enough to cause an;· great current except on the banks. A strong westerly current is found in the "Serpent's Mouth," south of Trinidad, into the Gulf of Paria, and it is sufficient in volume to neutralize the flood tide in the Dragon's Mouth. Heavy tide rips are found about the latter, which are probably caused by these two currents meeting. The influence of the various forces

At ~o. 6, which was nearest the Gulf of Paria, \\·hen the title was eblJ the a\erage current ·was N. by \V. on the surface and N. lJy E. at L) fathoms. At :)O fathoms, wLere the iutlueuce of the tide from the Gulf would ue least fdt, the direction at the uegir111i11g was .YE. anll cl.tanged to SE. by E. after low water. Probabls on this bank t!Je llirection of the ebL antl flood currents woulu 1Je north and south, but the deJiection of the eddy current comiug from the Caril:Jueau gave a resultant directilln at ~-\0 fathoms of XE. aml SE. The position of Xo. 7 anchorage was almost iu the prolongation of the axis of the passage between TolJago anu Trinidad. Its effect on ti.Jc tidal action at this anchorage was to detlect to t!Je westward. No. 8 statrou, situateu near the middle of the deep water of the passage, show:;; at all dt>ptl1s the influence of the eddy, tletlecting the tidal currents between NE. aml SE. To tile northw,ml of Martinique the next three passages possess cnrren ts much differeHt from those to the sou th ward. Here tidal action is noticeable, but only to detlect the entering water arn.l not to rewrse its direction. The Yertical cunes (illustratiou :S-o. 313) show the difference in the character of the currents in tlrn various passages, and seem to confirm the view that the canse:o; of the currents enteriug those to the northward are different from those to the southward of that island, and the cmTes shown on illustrations 32 arnl 33 seem to point to the same fact. Comparing them with tlie curves of the Sontll American coast current, or of the St. Lucia Passage, it will be seen how ,.eQ· different they are. The South American curves show the surface current greater than at li'i fathoms. Betweeu St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and l\Iartinique the maximum Yelocity is at 15 fathoms, with lmt a single exception. These arc the passages receiving nearly all of the 8outh American coast current which .succeeds in finding its way into the Oal'ibbean. In the passages between l\lartinique and Antigi1a tile tlow is composed of tile gentle frnctinna1 equatorial and the escaping water banked up against their win<l war<l si<les. The rnlocit.r of the current entering the passages is probabl.'· in excess of the current due to wind frictiou aloue in tlie trade region outside the islands. ·whatever the latter current ma:v lJe, it would when it impinges .on the islamls raise the elevation of the surface arnl increase the velocity of the escaping water to the westward. Tlie accuumlation ou the outside une to the bre<Lk of the waves, throwing ton;; of water from the crest to the trough of the sea, would increal:le it still more. The elevation-; or <lifferences of level would probably be extremely slightt but wouhl be sufficient to increase the tiow through the passages when there was no other escape for it. The three passages next in order of their examination are the Anegada, ::\Iona, and \Yindward, and in these only a tidal current was found, complicated by interfering local causes. On the east side of the Anegada Passage, in 18S8, the surface .current rnried between S \\". aud Sl<J. by E.; 15 fathoms, N:N"E. to E. by S.; 30 fathoms, N. to E. by S.; 65 fathoms, N. to E. by S., aud 130 fathoms, NW. to SE. by the KE. quadrant. Tliis year the directions above the 30-fathom depth changed regularly to the right, making the -circle in about twel"Ve hours. At 65 and 130 fathoms tile U.irections were irregular, 1Jut mostly t4) the westwaru.

It is seen that in 1888 the velocities were very light, the change in direction was to the right, and in about twelve hours these changes made the tour of all points of the compass in succession. In 1889 the velocities are stronger, and the current was generallj· setting to the eastward against a fresh trade-wirnl. In the Mona Passage fiv-e anchorages were made. On the east side, iu 1888, th~ currents were light, and were mostly to the northward and westward. A year lattir they were found to he the same, except at 130 fathmns, when they varied in direction between NE. and S. by E., but stronger in force as iu the A.negada. Near the middle of the passage the currents were light, and to 30 fathoms depth generally varie1l between NE., SE., and SW.; below 30 fathoms the tidal influence was felt predominating toward the east. On the west side the currents were the same as in the middle. lu 1888 three anchorages were made iu the Windward Passage; No. 27, about 6 miles west of St. ~icolas :Mole; No. 29, about 1G miles SE. of Cape l\laisi Light-House, and No. 28, outside the line drawn between them, but in the prolongation of the middle of the passage. At Station 27 the directions were in the NE. and SE. quadrants (the former predominating deci1ledly),except at 130 fatlioms~ at which uepth the current was founu to be weak and irregular. A year later the same condition was found, except that the thickness oftbe regular northeasterly and southeasterly current was but 30 fathoms, and below that depth it was weak and irregular. At Station 28 the set was .SE. and .SW., except at 130 fathoms, where for a short time it was \VS vV. In 1889 the current was less than one-half knot in velocit:y, and its direction was generally to the southward and westward, except at 130 aad 200 fathoms, where it was northerly. Station No. 29 was found to be setting to tlie southward at each depth except 200 fathoms. At :.!:.!" tlie snrface w.i,s setting nort h westerly, and at all other depths tidal action was fouml except at 65 fathoms, where from sorne cause the flow was south westerly. These currents are shown on illustration No. 40, the cun'es being drawn l.Jy resoh·ing the \·elocity aml takiug the component in the direction of the axis of the passage. The vertical curves dedueed from these are shown on illustration No. 3fi, Fig. 5, together with those of the previous year. The water entering the Uaril.Jbean on the westward side at the time of the latest observations, was entirely as a subcurreut between 20 and 120 fathoms depth, whereas in 1888 it was entering at all depths observed. On the east s i<le, in 1888, more water left the sea than entered from the surface to 130 fathoms, whereas this year the northerly current existed only to 30 fa th oms depth 1 but was hardly perceptible below that depth. There seems to be an eddy current in this passage as in the others, and g~nerally it will be found that it is northerly on the Haytian sideaml southerly on the On ban side. It is probable, too, that there is a slight excess of water entering the passage. There is evidently a current setting to the westward outside the islands from the Anegada to the Windward passages. This is probably composed in part of the same gentle flow as that found

in the passages north of ::\Iartinique, lmt it is much augmented by the water driven to leeward by tlie sea. In meeting the obstruction of tlic islands, the direction is changed sliglitl~·, and when an opening is reacl1ed, an eddy current is formed, the streugth of which depends lar;:·ely upon the continuity of tbe land to the eastward. At the Anegada PasHage the few islands to the eastward act more as a ;;;ieYe tllan as au accumulator of the water, and consequently its eddy is weak and irregular, and titlal action most pronounced. In the -:'.Iona Passage the same condition is found, the accumulation of water on the northern shore of Puerto Rico being iusufficien t to prod nee a marked eddy. The \Vindwanl Pas;;age to leeward of the large islaml of Hayti is situated fayornbly for formation of au eddy, and here it was found. In 1888 it was decidetl; in 1880 it was 11ot. Tile iir:-t was a season of strong trade; in the last the winds were almormall.r light. Farther to the westward the coast current enconuters the 11t11Tow part of the old Baliania Channel, and the different conditions existing at the two examinations seem to be irnlieated directly by the obserYatious in the \Vin1l W<tnl Passage. The first ex:tmiuation of Station So. 30 de,·elopetl thP fact that tht> surface enrr<'llt 1Yhich was running to the eastward was but a sllallow one. At G3 fatlloms 1lepth Llie directiou ehau;!:e·l first one way and then the other at fair:_!.)' regular interrnJs, and below tllat depth at 130 am! 200 fathoms it was running to the westward with a \'elocity of from 1:2 to 2 knots 11er lionr. At t lie time of the examination this year, the first twenty-four hours Rhowetl a current exactly opposite; that is, Jlowing to the westwani oa tile surface, to the eastwar,l at the lower tlepths, and at G.'i fathoms the average turning iioint. Jn the next twenty.four hour,; the whole wass of water was running to the northward and westward. In the vertical cnr\·es of the \Vimlward and Old Bahama Channels (illustration Xo. 3G, Sketches 5 antl 6) the data are obtained by resoh'ing the velocities in the directious of the axis, so that they represent relatively the volnme of water 1)assing through. The differences in the two ~·ears' observations will be seen at a glance. An analysis of the temperatures in these passages will be of interest.

This water was leaving the Caribbean. At No. 29 station at each depth it is colder than at the other stations, with the exception of 130 fathoms. This water was entering the Caribbean from the northward. In the Old Bahama Channel the surface water, coming from the Gulf of lllexico, was about the same as foe water entering the Windwaru Passage at Station 20, but the lower water was w-armer than at auy corresponding depth betwee11 Ila;yti and Cuba., whil~ in 1889 the surface water at Station ~{(;a was colder and the lower strata warmer.

It will be noticed that at Statiou 31 all the water was flowing- to the northward and westward, uut tlle lower strata more to the uorthward (toward the right) than the upper. At Station 44, Itbont 180 miles distant, the directions were found to be mostly iu the northeast quadraut, with the lower strata setting more to the right than the upper. Off Cape Hatteras two anchorages were made in 18S7, and se,·en tbe present year. The Yarious stations arc sliowu on the accompan~·ing chart (illustration No. 42), and it will be seen tLat all are well within tlie supposed limits of the Gulf Stream. · At Station No. 1, Section F, observations were made three times (see illustration). The first, in 1887, shows a str011g current to the northward and eastward, except at tLe lower depths 'where it was tidal. At 200 fathoms it averaged NN\Y. ;t W. and SSE. :t E., changiug with regularity, but running longer to the southward thau to the uortlt ward. At 130 fathoms there was an e.ident interference hetwecu tlrn regular and the tidal currents. At Station ia iiractically the same directions were found, with an indication of the tidal interference at 130 fathoms. Station Ih gave au ed<ly current during the whole time of the anchorage, every direction with one exception at 65 fathoms being in the southwest quadrant. At Nos. 2 and 3 stations the currents were always to the northward and eastward, and the velocities strong. At Xos. 4, 5, and 6 stations the currents were most erratic in the upper strata, but persistently fio'\\'"ing to the northward and eastward at the lower depths. There were some anomalous temper· atnres found that lead me to the belief that inferences drawn as to direction of flow of water froru surface temperatures can not be relied upou. At Station 5 the directions of tlie surface flow changed gradually from W. to NE. by E. and .SSE., with greatly varying temperatures, as sho~n in the following table:

The question arises, what i.~ the cause of this daily variation in the velocity ~ It is not marked in opeu sea where the current or tidal wave is unobstructed, but when it is noticed, the close agreement lietwee.n the current establishment and the tidal establishment causes the belief that they are intimately connected. It appears tluit the current has a comparati,·ely uniform Yelocity. The tidal wa,·e, upon meeting an ob.struction in open sea, elenttes the water aml causes a varying velocity in the current, but the effect is retarded iu point of time depending upon outside influence11.

That is, the maximum velocity is from two to three hours after the water is elevated greatest
by the tidal wave.

Off Bahama the maximum flow is llh 30m after tlle transit. The average tidal establishment of the Atlantic coast south of ITatteras is about 71' 3orn, resulting in a difference of 4 hours after the tidal elevation on tl1e coast. Ju the confined waters of tlie Gulf Stream, issuing from the Gulf of ::\Iexico, it is still a question of'' head," but in.another way, for here tlie maximum flow is a:ft:er the depressiou of low water in the Atlantic. The maximum current in the Straits of Florida at Fowf'y Rocks is 9 hours before the transit of the moon or 31i 26m after. Low water in the Atlantic is at about lh J'jm, lea>ing a difference of 2h 07m, In the Straits of Yucatan the Earne law st:ems to hold, but the irregular and conflicting tidal waves of the Gulf of Mexico cause a greater retardation to about 5 hours after low water. This subject will receive further attention on later examinations, when it is hoped that the question may be definitely settled. To summarize my conclusions as to the probable course taken by the water entering the Caribbean to form the Gulf Stream: Outside the Windward Islands the surface flow is in the prerniling direction of the tradewinds; this is pro\Jably a })ersistent current as a -whole, but is interrupted over small areas by the lower currents coming to the surface, and also by the South .American coast current increasing in ,~eJocit.Y and volume at the time of abnormally strong trade-winds. The observations show the currents to be as follows in the various passages from Cuba to Antigua: Grenada Passage.-Yariable on the surface; subcurrent from the Caribbean into the.Atlantic. St. Iilteia Passage.-Surface into the Caribbean; subcurrent out with a tidal current between. J11a rtinique Passage.-Surface current into the. Caribbean; tidal current below but predominating to the westward. Dominica, Guadaloupe, and Antigita Passages.-A gentle westerly current into the Caribbean. Anegada and Jfona Passages.-Irregular and weak tidal currents, with probably a slightly predominating current out of the Caribbean on the eastern sides, and into the Caribbean on the western sides of the passages. Windward Passage.-The same as in the Anegada and Mona Passages, but the currents more decided in velocity, depending probably upon the preYailing strength of wind. SMtfh of Cura9oa.-Generally to the westward on the surface, aud to the eastward underneath, but the subcurrent is of i;uch volume that it is liable to entirely overcome the surface set. Bet1ceen Jamaica and Hondums.-Southwest of Pedro Bank, S,V. by W. on the surface, grad· ually changing to the westwanl to 130 fathoms, and tidal below that depth. Beticeen Pedro Bank and Jamaica.-Tidal or eddy current setting to eastward. Old Baltama Cltannel.-Curreut in both directions, depending upon the velocity, direction, and

persistency of the prevailing winds.

In ueneral.-Tlle trcttle-wiutl seems to cause a surface cmT"11t in its direction, and in all the passages of the \Vmd W<trd falan ds au inflow exist" to a greater or less extent. In the passages on the northern sille of the Caribbean there is Ile) fixed current. In aduition to this flow there is a large volume entering all the passages, from the break of the waves. Passing across the Caribbean, the obstruction of Hontlnras and Yucatan causes an elcYation (probabl~- very sligllt, howen'r) Pml a fiow through the natural outlet of the Straits of Yucatan and Straits of Florida, thus forming the Gulf Stream proper. The course of the currents between the Bahama Islands and Cape Hatter:is indicates that the Gulf Stream receives large adclitions from the .Atlantic tlow. The complications off Cape Hatteras, caused by this current, and the inshore counter current meeting the Gulf Stream at au angle, makes it irnpo3sible, howe,·er, to solni the problem of the mssterimi of the latter at the prese11t time. The position of its axis seems to be fairly well located iu the Yiciuity of Xo. 3 anchorage, but from all the evidence of mariners a strong current is often experienced farther south; sometimes it is broad auu sometimes uarrow. There seems to Le a subcurrent generally setting in the proper direction of the Stream, e\·eu wheu the surface flo\Y is oppo1>ite; it is pruual1le that tlie former overcomes the latter, making a surface current to the 111.rthwarrl; tliat ii,;, tlte increase in width of surface ftow comes from below, but the cause or t lie time of these expausious can not now be stated. The connection between t11e expansion and the declination or transit of the moon, or meteorological condition of the atmosphere, is not evident, although there are i11dica· tions that these are the forces which influence if not govern it. Man:- more obsen·atious are necessary to determine the question. The following officers were attached to the Yessel during the past season : Ensign R -:\I.

For the sake of completeness of information respecting the rc~ults o!Jtainetl with this apparatus, it appeared desirable to present nn account antl giYe the resultiug lengths with probable errors of the remaining fi>e principal base-liues, whicli were reported 011 indi\·idually by me some time between December, li3Tl, and September, 1Si2. These lines are as follows: 1. Base-line on Danphiue Island, .A.Ia., measured in 18±7. 2. Base-line on Bodies Island, N. C., measured iu 1848. 3. Base line on Edisto Island, S. U., measured in 1850. 4. Base-line on Ke,\· Biscayne, Fla., measured in 1855. 5. Base-line on Cape Sable, Fla., measm·e<l in 1855. The sixth and se>enth lines in the order of tinrn were Hie Euping Plains base in 18;)7, aml the Peach Tree Ri1lge base in 11'72 and 1873. \Vith tllis last measure the first part of the history of this compensation apparatus closes, as it has not been employed since 1873. Between tlrn ~ears 1847 and 1873 the Ci-metre bars (tubes) remained substautially as originally constmeted and adjusted, excepting a small change in length of one of the tubes, dtrn to an accident to tlle ag«tte entl duriug tile first measure made in 1855. The treatment and principles of computation for the length of these 1;1even bases and for their probable error are therefore the same or similar, iu particular since all depend upon tlie same original comparisons and fondamental data. After the measure of the last base some slight imprornments and re-adjustments of tlie tubes were made at the Stuvey Office at Wasltingtou, which of course would now necessitate a series of new comparisons with the 6-metre standard bar, in case it was the intention to use the apparatns

.again.* A fall description of it, accornp:mietl bya plate ofillustratiuus, is given in Appendix No. 35, Uoast Survey Report for 185!. This account is J;'rom the pen M )faj. E. B. Hunt, U. S. A., then Assistant in the Coast Survey. This report having become scarce, the article was reprinted in Appendix: No. 12, lfoport for 1873, pp 132-136, with a su11plement referring to some improvements made in 187 J. The illustrations are reproduced on plate 18 (with the added Borda scale of figure 3). The unit of length adoptetl in the Oortst Survey, since its existence, is one of the original iron metres of the French committee of the last century, the property of the American Philosophical Society, of Phila<lelphia, au 1 lent to the Snn·ey. In 1867 it was taken to Paris by Dr. F. A. P. Barnard, then Assistant in the l5nrrny, and by him compared with the metre of the .Archi·es, with the co-opemtion of Mr. Tresca, of the Oonsenatoirc des .Arts et)fetiers (see Coast Survey Report for 186i, Appendix No. 7). Later indirect comparisons ham shown that this metre (C. M.) is >er.r nearly (most prohahly less than a micron) of the length of tlrn new International Prototype Metre (see Bulletin .X o. li, Coast and Geodetic Survey.-The relation lrntween the Metric Standards of Length of the U. S. Uoast and Geodetic SmTey and the C. S. Lake Snrvey, published October 11, 1880). The National Prototype l\fotre hadng since been recei·ed, it now only remains to compare the Committee Metre (C.

PART I.-RESULTING LENGTH AND PROB.-lBLE U'.\CERT.UNTY OF THE BASE-LINE lIEASURED O~ DAUPHINE ISLAND, ALABAMA., IN 1847, BY A. D. BACHE, SUPERINTENDENT U.S. COAST SURVEY.
[Reported April 9, 1872.J

When reconnoitering for tbe primary triangulation of the coast of Alabama and Mississippi in 1845, Assistant F. H. Gtirdes selected the site on Dauphine Island as a suitable one for the measure of a base-line. The elevation of the island is but a few feet above the mean level of the Gulf of Mexico. The line passes over sand, generally bare, llut in part covered with low grass or rushes. The irregularities of tile ground are inconsiderable, but a uum ber of sand ridges had to be leveled aud some gullies, cut out by the sea, had to be crossed. After a preliminary chaining in 1845-'46, the measurement was made by means of the compensation base apparatus in May and June, 184 7, by A. D. Bache, Superintendent. This is the first base-line measured with tllis apparatus. The line is nearly 6i statute miles in length; its termfoi are marked by stone monuments, between which tllere are six so-called mile-stones, also a stoue half a mile beyond the sixth milemark. In August, 1852, a htlrricane swept over the island, causing the sPa to 'vash o·er the line and to (Jisturb the mile-stones V and VI, also YI!l, as well as the western monument; two of the original verification marks (nails in heavy logs), however, were recognized in May, 1851~ by Assistant.s F. H. Gerdes and J. E. Hilgartl and secured by marble blocks, and for further security Assistant Gerdes, in 183i, inserted a screw pile in tlrn line with reference to these marks. The compensating tubes'Nos. 1 and 2 were compared among themselves, aml tube 2 directly with the standard. 6-metre bar before the apparatus left. Washington. Ou Dauphin~ Island, before and after the base measures, the relative length of the tubes was ascertaine1l ; tube 2 was compared with the standard before the base measure and tube l was similarly compared after the measure. The results of these comparisons are as follows:

For the same reason the results of the Danphine Island comparisons of the tnbes witll the standard alone are used; they are: May 11 and 12, 184i, before the base measure, tube 2= 6m,OOOO.'ii3±0m.0000110, aml Juue 10, 1847, after the base measure, t,ube 1 =u'".0000G-!O ±:Om.0000110. Tile above difference in the length of the tubes is well ascertainerl, hnt the derived absolute . length of the tubes depends mainly on the closeness with wllicll tile temperature of the sbuHlanl bar is indicated by the thermometers during the comparison~. During tile first-uamell comparisoM, made at an average temperature of 740,5;) Fabr., the temperature of the air was prohal,)]y slightly rising; during the second comparisons, made at an average temperature of 76°.93 Fahr., the temperature of the air was probably slightly falling, and if in the first case the substance of the bar was but 10 Fahr. lower, and in the secoml case, by the same amount. ltigher than indicated, the resulting cl.mnge in length would more tbau make up the obsen'ed di:ffereuce.

This compeusation was then shown to be perfect for various natural temperatures and for different rates of change of temperature by the invariable length of the tubes under these conditions.

required but an approximate knowledge of the co-efficients of the two metals composing each' tube. In 1865, when the fiual result for the length of the Epping uase was presented, the former conclusion of the absence of any appreciable difforential expansion and contraction in the tubes under ,·ariable temperatures was again accepted, !tnd the same idea was presented in the discussion of the length of the Bodies Island base. It suffices to remark that the perfect compensation of the tubes for changes of temperature cau not be called in question by any comparisons conducted in the field with bar aud thermometers but partly protected from the >ariations in the tempera-· ture of the air, aucl that tile apparent outstanding differential quantities, under such circumstauces, are to be ascribed to the difference in tile actual and attrilmted temperature of the metal of the bar. The treatment of the measures for the length of the base '\\ill be uniform for eacL of 1 he six lines so far meas.ured witll the compensation apparatus. The absolute length of the tubes, however, is not invariable, as may be seen by a comparison of the results gi-rnn for the several base-lines; but as the lengtlt of tLe latter is not affected thereb.Y the fact is of little importance. This shortening of the tubes is ascribed to the joiut effect of a gradual wearing ot' lllOYa ble parts and to sagging or settling. The probable error assigned to the deduced length of the tubes may be taken to include all uncertainty arising from direct comparisons with the standard, the uncertainty iu the length of tlJe standard itself, and all uncertainty respecting imperfect indications h~· the tht>rmometers during the comparisons, lmt excluding any small effect from a supposed imperfection in tl!e compen~a tion of the apparatus. To estimate tllis last we know that tl!e average temperature of the tubes llnring the measurement of tl!e base, as indicated by the tliree thermometers attachetl to each tube and read for ea-0h contact, is s.50,u Fahr., aud the mean temperature during the comparisons with the standard iR 750_7 Fahr. Owing to this difference of 10.02 Fahr., the probable error of the length of each of the tubes, as gi>en before, Las been increased to :l:: om.000014G The greater nuru her of tubes was 11laced level, or nearly so, during the measure, and the maximum inclination but little exceeds 10. The general sllrface of the island is but 2 or 3 feet aborn the average tidal level of the Sound; tile latitude of the middle of tlJe base is 300 15', and tl!e azimuth of the line S. 84t 0 W., and the elevation of the tubes abo>e the average Gulf level 1.83 metres, making the reduction to that level=-0"'.00306 The exces:; oflength of the end of tube 1777 o\·er the west end of the base '\\as measured with a brass metre scale, and allowance was made for effect of the actual temperature above that for which it was standarded.

The hurricane of of August, 1852, having displaced mile-stones V, VI, and \I~, as well as the western monument at end of base, that portion of the old line lying between the verification marks (east end of tubes 153 3 and 1659) was remeasured in May, 1855, by Assistants F.

The sifo for the base-line was selectetl by Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle, in ::\larch, 1848. It is located on, and extends over, the sandy and in part marslly beach of the low and irn1T01\- strip of land on the coast of North Carolina, between Roanoke Sound ancl the Atlantic Ocean. Its piiddle point is nearl.r opposite the north end of a base-site selected iu 1845, the measurement of which, however, was prevented by the sea breaking through it iu September, 184.G. After a preliminary measure by chaining, tlie final measurement, by means of the compensation base a1lparatus, was made between No1ember 7 arnl 23, by A. D. Bache, Snperiutemleut. The Bodies Island base is the second primary !Jase measured with this apparatus. The whole

length of the line is nearly 6¥ statute miles, and its termini are marked by stone monuments ; there are also 6 mile-stones placed in the line, which are used for purposes of a subordinate; triangulation. The compensating tubes Nos. 1 and 2 were compared with the 6 metre iron standard bar before the apparatus left Washington, and again before, during, and after the base measure at Bodies Island. The result of the comparisons taken on tbe island between November 3 and NoYember 27, omitting those taken November 28 and 29, when the temperature was comparatiYely low, depends on twenty-one separate measures on four days, on each of wl1ich the tempera. ture was ,-ery nearly uniform during the time occupied by the experiments; the mean temperature . is but 0°.2 higher than the temperature at which the bat<e was measured, and which was indicated b.r six thermometers attached to the tubes. The mean temperature on the days of comparison ranged from 40°.S to 62 °.3 Pahr., the average beiug 530,0 FalJr.; on two of these days the temperature (during tlle comparisons) remained sensibly uniform; on the first day it was slowly falling, and on tlle fourth slowly rising·. The temperature during the base-measure was 520,3 Fahr., when corrected for difference in exposure and scale errors with reference to the indications of the thermometers of the standard har. One turn of the screw of the reflecting comparator was found equal to 56.333 divisions, and one di\·ision equal to 0.000004509 metre. From the aboYe-mentioned field comparisons we deduce the following length for each of tlle compensation tubes: Tube No. 1 ............ 5"'.99\.19514±0m.0000140 Tube No. 2 ............ 5 .\.199785'2±0 .0000142 After a special inrnstigatior1 of the Bodies Islaucl comparisons the result was again acceptecl that the compensation of the tubes for yariation in temperature, whether slow or fast, was so neariy perfect that an,y sup11osed limall lleficiency or differential expansion and contraction could not be detected with certaint.r from tli.ese comparisons; the,\· ag<lin prm·ed the unreliability in the indications of the thermometers, when read in the air, though in contact with the metallic bars. It will be noticed that, as far as tlrn length of the base is concerned, it matters little wlieth!:'r the tnbes are or are not pc1fcctly compensated, the length assigned to the tubes being that derived from the comparisons witll the standard at a temperature almost identical with tllat during the measurement. Tl.te obscrYations for compensation were made at tl.ie Const Surrny Office by tlle late Superintendent in 1816; during these experiments the compensating bars wt>re immersed in a liquid, and when finally adjusted sl..Jowel1 uo change in length \rith Yariatious in the temperature of the liquid. The.r Ila Ye since remained in the same condition of mechanical adjustment. The probable error assignetl to the rnlue for tlie length of tLe tubes may be taken to include nll uncertainty arising from direct comparisons with the standard, the uncerEainty in the length of the Htamlard itself (on account of its smallness), and all uncertainty respecting imperfect indications b.r the thermometen; of the actual temperature of the bars during comparison, nlso any small defect arising from imperfect compensation of the tul1es.

The errors of measure me principally of two kinds, which may be distinguished by tlte names "errors of transfer" aml "errors of c011tar·t.'' The former arise from the operation of a transfer of the >ertical at the end of a tube to the gTomnl or from the reYerse operation, as performed by means of a theodolite mounted near aml at right angles to the Iiue. The latter arise from the im;tability of the tubes, pro1lncctl by a11y ~·ieltling of the gronutl, by its elasticity, or by the effect of the wiutl; this error is much enlarged when the tubes are inclined, iu which case their weight acts as a llio;tnrbiug cause. :From tltese experiments \Te deduce the probable error of a transfer, ,,=±011m 1.0S:.J, and the probable error of a contact,

Iu May, 1847, Assistant James S. "'illiarns, who hatl been charged with the examination of the coast of Georgia and South Carolina for the location of a base-line, reported the site on Edisto Island, Soutl.J. Carolina, as possessing the uecessary requirements for a satisfactory measure. The line was subsequently imipecte(l by the Su11erintendent of the Snrrny, aud was directed to be opened aml prepared for measurement. It is located 011 the southeast side of the islaml, and extends over dry antl firm land. The undulations of the ground are slight anil gentle, with an average surface cle>ation of a little less than 2 metres allo\·e high-water mark. The liue runs principally over cultivated ground, and is nearly Glf statute miles in leugth. The ernls of the base are marketl by stone monnmeuts, and there are six, so called, mile stones plan tell iu the line. The Edisto ba1,;e is the third one measured with the compensation apparatus. The measurement commenced Jauuary 3, 1850, at the eastern eud, and terminated January 18 at the western extremity. \Vith a >iew of obtaining a Yalue for the probalJle error of measure, a distauce of 270 metres was measured three times.

Six sets of comparisons were made, in five of which the temperature was slightly rising, and the combination of the indiYidual results in each was such as to eliminate any change in tl.te interyal of the comparison of the stan<lard and tubes. The first set, being at the comparatiYely low temperature of 34u_s3 Falu., was not nsell, in or<ler that the mean temperature during the comparisons should approximate, as near as may be, to the temperature during the base measurement.

Their length as usetl for the Edisto base is, accordiogl,y: Length of tube 1. ........... .'Jrn.999861ii:±Om.ooooo63 Length of tube 2 ............ 5m.99~7288:±0m.ooooo63 The general treatment of the measures for length of the base-lines depending upon the com}lensation aJ)paratus is the same for all, and is based on the supposition that the mechanical com· peusation, originally perfected in 1846, remained sensibly unchanged. To guard, however, against any possible differential expansion, the temperature during the base measure should be near that of the comparisons. In the present case the former temperature w~s 59°.3, the latter 51°.4, difference, 70_9 Fahr. In the previous discussions of the length of the Dauphine and Bodies Islands base-lines, it has been fully stated that the actual compensation of the tubes for different temperatures and for different rates of change of temperatures ean not be called !n question by any comparisons made in the field, when the bar and the thermometers ean only partly be protected from the changes of the temperature of the air. Under these c!rcumstances we must be satisfied with an approxinrnte knowledge of the actual effective temperature of the mass of the bar, and the accuracy of the base measure will mainly depend upon the closeness with which we can assign the true temperature of the standard during the comparisons. 'fo make some additional allowance for thi8 circumstance, the probable error above assigne<l to the resulting length of the tubes bas been increased to an amount which corresponds to an effect of an outstanding possible differential expansion of nearly i'o of the full expansion, or, what comes to the same thing, of nearly io .Fabr. uncertainty in the indicated thermometer temperature, due to index or graduation error. The greater number of tubes are measured level or with small inclinations, and none of the angles of' inclination rise above 1~ 0 · The sum total of corrections for inclination is -Om.20486 The average level of the island is 5.6 feet aboYe high-water mark, the average rise and fa.II of the fo1e is 5.2 feet, and the average elevation of the axis of the tnbes above the ground is 3.5 feet, whicli giYes 3.57 metres to be used for the reduction of tlie base to the half-tide level of the ocean. This amounts to -Om.00tmo, the middle point of the base being in latitude 320 32', and the azi· rnuth of the line 610 20 1 '-:r. of S. and E. of N.

[I\cported August 2£1, 18i2.]

In October, 184!:1, Assistant F. H. Gerdt>s was instrncte-d to examine and report on the practi<rnbility of measuring a priwar~· base-line on Key Biscayne, Florida Ueef, in consequence of which a plane.table survey was made of the Key in the winter of 1850-'51, when a site suitable for the pttrpose was fonnd and determined on. The line is a little over 32 statute miles in length, and follows the eastern side of the island in a nearly north and south course. It is but little ekrnted above the sea, parts of the surface being actually below the mean tide-lenl, and pass·es over a ti~m calcareons soil, with irregularities of surface generally less than 3 feet in height; it trawrRes also some patches of marshy ground. The whole was thickly conred either with coarH' grass or a dense growth of palmettoes and mangroves, the roots of which formed a consitl!·rahle obstacle to the preparation of the line for measure. l n December, 1849, a preliruinarj· an<l lJroken line was measured by Assistants F. H. Gerdes and J.E. Hilgard, b,Y means of two wooden rods, each 4

Tlie measure commenced at the uortl1ern end .April 9, and terminated at the sontliern end April 18, 18.i.I. It is the fourth line measured with tliis apparatus. The middle of the base is in latitude 2;:;::i -H' and its azimuth is'._!::> :..!S' west of north and east of south. Stone monumeuts mark the termiual points of the base, and there are also three mile-stones inserted in it. Tl1e compensation tnbes 1 and 2 were compared, for length, with the standard bar, both before and after the base measnre. The first sds of coniparisons are usetl for the measures take11 before April 13, on which day one of the agates of tube 1 was shi·rnrecl u.r an accident. After grirnliug a new surface to the agate, and straigl!teuiug its supp():tiug stem, the tube being now designated tube 1 liis, the measure of the ba::;e was completrnl, the last sets of comparisons serving for this portion of tile line.

In April, 1849, Assistant F. H. Gerdes receh·e(l instructions from tile Superintendent of the Survey to reconnoitre the riciuity of Cape Sable, Florida, for a site of a primary base-line. In the following winter a suitable site was fonrnl, lying hctween the Gulf shore and tl1e rverglades, and running to the eastward and uorthwar(l from the cape for 4 miles. The ground selected presents to the eye au almost unbroken lm·el, and but a small amount of labor was required to prepare it for measure.

The soil is composell of calcareous clay, with a layer of vegetable matter from 3 to 6 inches in depth; it is firm anti solid when dry, but soft and shaky when wet. Tlie general eleYation of the surface aliove the Gulf level is about half a metre. ' ImrnelliatelJ· after the completion of the measurement of the K~:r Biscayne base, iu April, 1855, the obserYing party was transferred to Cape Sable, where the operation of final measure was commeuce1l :\lay 3 and conclmled -:\fay 11, 1855.

Although the weather was rainy wheu I arri,·etl in Engiaml, I imml·diately put myself in communication with the Ifoyal Ol>:;ern1tory at Greenwich. Tile Astronomer Hoyal was in l'aris, but the chief assistant offered me every facility. TLe weather continuing bad, I went to Paris September 23. At Paris I called upon Professor Loowy, of the O!Jser.atory, and examined the instrument,; with him. 'fhe meridian instrument wa8 fitted with ouly Jfre transit threatls, and therefore th<· proposed observatious were abandoned. At Berlin, near tlle end of October, the weather was unfa\·orable, aml no ollsen·atious wen' made. Director Foerster, whom I had kuown since 1875, very cheerfully placecl me iu communication with the transit ol>server. Preceding the Conference of the International Geodetic Association, I spent the time in gathering information, examining the works of preci,.,iou iu the Exposition, auJ. visiting the International Bureau of 'Veights a111l Mcasures'4< at Breleuil. I recefred your instructions that I had been designated to bring to \Ya~hington the National Prototypes of the Metre aml KilogTamme.

Under subject III, I made a report upon the condition of the Coast and Geodetic Surrny work. I had intended to make a .-erbal commuuicatio11, but I learned that only written communications were received, and so I wa::> forced to prepare a report from recollection and the sca11t material I Lad with me. A copy of this I transmitted to yon. \Yith that re1)ort I preseuted in yunr name twenty.two examples of varnphlets, "1.fetbotls aml Hestdts,'; aml specimens of the. Bulletins and Notices to Mariner.~; together witll a series of large photograpbs illustratiug the. work at the high stations in the Sierra N e,·ada. The riamphlets embraced four on gravity; ten ou arcs of the meridian, base-lines, heights, levdings, and longitudes; five on magnetism; 011e bulletin, and two notices to mariners. To these were added maps shl)wing, respectively, the progress of the measurement of the arcs of the meridian and the parallel, and the oblique arc of the Atlantic, the telegraphic longitude work, the 1irecise leveling lines and their stations, the stations of the gravity experiments, and maps of the magnetic elements. The corrlial greeting from yon very favorably impressed the delegates; the work of measurement of arcs of meridian and parallel astonished most of them, and the recommendation that France remeasure the PeruYiau arc particularly satisfied the French delegates, as you will see by the mention of the matter in the Annuaire of the Bureau of Longitutles. At the last meeting I was elected a member of the Permaneut Commission, but have not yet been officially notified thereof~ I attended aU the official receptions, etc., as you will see by my monthly report for October. The expressed opi11ious of tlrn French delegates, which I find in the Annuaire for 1889, gave me great satisfaction. I have alreatly informed you that my report was translated for the An1maire of 1890, and that the recommeudation for the remeasurement of the Peruvian arc was particularly satisfyiug to tliem. The report will appear in 1891. I extract from tl.Je Annuaire the matter relating directly to the Survey, aud refer you to tbe speeches of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, General lbailez, and M.

UNITED STATES .CO.AST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

lf you should ask me whether I learned anything of immediate practical value to the field work and methods of the Coast aml Geodetic Survey, I should have to make a qualified statement. The Conference was evidently not intended for full aUll exhausth"e expression of meauR and methods; that, I believe, is fully and quietly discussed at the yearly meetings of the Permanent Commission. I found thorough and earnest geodesists who are anxious to improve every means and every method, antl who, deprecating inferior means, are very urgent for the highest class work on the best tlevised schemes. In some conversations about base-lines and the means of measuring them, the means and rapidity of execution by the Coast and Geodetic Survey were suspected as not leading to tile ilighest character of results. I had long since (1875-'78) seen several -of the base apparatus llSetl in India, Prussia, France, and Spain, and knew the cbaracter of the grountl o\er which the line wa>1 measured and the personnel; aml some reiterated points haYe been suggestive, but to-day I would not adopt any <'f their methods in their entirety. Of the base apparatus I silall speak in another place. Of the instruments I can express the views I entertained after examining the workshops anti Exposition in 1875 and 1878, that I have seen very iruch to avoid . .My former judgment is confirmed on one essential proposition, that if our observers and mechan!.cians will work in harmony and striYe to obtain the highest excelleuce for the advantage -0f the work alone, I firmly 11eliern we are fully competent to lead in the construction of instruments of iirecision. The observer and the mechanician are not always in accortl because the mechanician is rarely an observer, and the character of the work of the Coast Survey demands tl1at the mechanical means shall be atlequate to the delicate manipulation and requirements of the most skillful observer. And in another proposition I am confirmed, that the civilian methods of the Uoast Survey arc superior tu the military methods of the Governments of Europe; witness the number of officers and men employed to measure a bal'le-liuc, and the number employed in the observations of the stations of tile great quadrilateral between Spain aud Algeria. Preceding the Conference of the ARsociation I visitetl the Exposition to examine such instruments as were 011 exhibition, and dnring it arnl subseriueutl~· I made visits for examinations of -0bjects tllat were not regularly placed among the instruments. The number of exilibitions that had instruments antl optical meaus was about twenty-fi\·e. The 'Var Department had a large 2.nd excellent exhibit, inclu<ling base apparatus with the microscope arrangements. 'Vitb Commandant Defforges aml six of the foreign delegates I visited the Bureau of geodesy and geography, examining tile iustrumeuts and the methods of work. After tile Exposition I visited some of the makers of instrumeu ts, !Jut found that all their best work was in the Exposition. I was disappointed iu the character of tlle instruments of precision applicable to geodesy and astronomy, and tiliuk it was inferior to the Exposition of 1878. In one sentence I may say that I saw nothing whiclt we need take for a guide. There seems a desire to <1eYise nni>ersal instruments in the most compact form. These generally run int-o complex arrangements witlt brise or eccentric telescopes, and usually carry the apparatus necessary for re·ersal. All the u11inrsal instruments seemed too top-hea>y, the three foot-screws were at the ends of <!Omparativelj· sl10rt arms, :in<l were tltemselves too small. Tile best exhibit in geodetic instruments washy Briinner. Ile had a meridian instrument with transit axis estimated at JS inches, large Yertical circle, iron stand, and altogether too much top gear to put 011 the three contracted foot-serP.ws. Re,·ersing apparatus to be put on the frame. Be llall a new meridian mark with the mirn about 10 inches from the lens and on the same base of iron. The theodolite lie exhillitell was the same t;n>e as that of 1875$, then iutende{l for the Bpauish·Algerian quadrilateral across the Mediterranean. The objecth·e is larger than that of 1878. This theodolite is representml in the 'iYar Department exilibition by the theodolite used in the long lines of Co1ouel Perrier's work in Spain-Algeria. It is rnarkl·1l by fewness arnl simplicity of parts and fair harmony of proportion for measuring horizontal directions. I might suggest a qnestion about the adequacy of its optical power for long lines, ailll certainlJ· Perrier's exhaustive r<>port of his operations shows that he was unable to see

the heliotrope signals, and resorted to electric lights developed from drnamos run by horse-power. The horizontal circle of 16 inches diameter reads by four microscope micrometers instead of three, involving more labor :.tnd observing upon a less number of graduations. I think the observer must be in a constrained position when reading the micrometers, because the horizontal plane of the telescope is only about 2 inches above the microscopes. The circle is turned on the vertical axis to new positions and clamped by three screws in each position. Should the surface planes of contact be irregular this clamping would warp the horizontal circle in each new position. The pillars for carrying the leleseope are so short that the instrument is not adapted to the observing of azimuths by means of a close circumpolar star, because the telescope ()an not be properly elevated. Instead, the transit instrument must replace the theodolite, whereby the possibility of error is introduced and labor aud extra time are consumed. The graduations are illuminated by light from above the instrument, passing down and through a right-angled prism fixetl for each microscope. This requires much more elaborate installation than is used on the Coast and G-eoiletic Snrve}-, but doubtless gives the observer greater freedom, more 1<atisfaction, and clearer reallings. The vertical axis of the instrument is short. There is one rather heavy finder on the horizontal axis, I subsequently called at the estabjshment of Brunner, but he informed me that all of his available work was at the Exposition. In the same case was a l::l-iucb theodolite by ~Iertz, and also a reversible peudnlum by Commandant Defforges, of the Geodetic Bureau of the War Department. Tbe description autl results of this instrument have been fully reported upon by him; but I here insert the remarks made by the Seeretary of tile Bureau of Longitudes in the Aunuaire for 1890:

After the Conference I visitell the Oonsern1toire des .Arts et :Metiers parts of two days under the guidance of Messrs. Masson and Tresca, aml saw the apparatus where the National prototypes of tbe metre .were prepared for, and received, the traces to denote the terminals of the metre. This I oove already reported upon, and the details of the different operations have been printed. In the Exposition were the chronometers of Kullberg, Webster, Parkinson and Frodsham, H. H. Hemrich; the latter from New York: with a high reputation in Germany. The compensating balance of the Webster chronometer was exposed. I ·also visite1l the establishments of some of the exhibitors, and of others not exhibiting. I found nothing new. At the establishment of Feil and Mantois I was received very cordially by the latter, who took me through. the whole of his work:stwps and showed me all the operations that were under way.

At the Exposition he ha.d the most remarkable exhibitions in his line of work. Among them wa& the crown glass for the o~jective of the telescope ordered by the Uni>ersity of Southern California, 1.05 metres in diameter, with density 2.521, and index of refraction 1.5160. It was not wrought to the true figure, but was a beautiful disk free from bubble and strire . .M. Antoine d' Abbadie, Member of the Institute, and of the Bureau of Longitudes, was one of the in>ited savants to the Geodetic Conference; he in>ited me to his home to see his small dip circle. It is very compact and portable, and I was struck with the means he has adopted to get accurate readings of the ends of the needle in advance of any other designer. At the conclusion of the work of the Conference I proceeded to Berlin and examined the instruments of the observatory and at the workshops, as elsewhere mentioned. Ha>ing returned to Paris, I gave my principal attention to the safo conveyance of the National prototypes of the metre and kilogramme to your ciistody. I have given in great detail the incidents of this pleasant duty. On my visit to Berlin I was cordially recei>ed by Professor Foerster and examined the instra.· meuts at the ohser·atory, where I found the universal transit made hy Bamberg in 1879. It is a prismatic telescope 51 inches in length, with a 4.6 inches objective. The frame-work and mounting is >ery heazily constructed in iron and rests on three foot-screws. ln turning it round to put it in the meridian or prime vertical, or any other vertical, it rernkes upon three rollers. 'Vheu ready for observing latitude by the Talcott method the heiwy telescope is lifted out by proper apparatus and reYersed to observe stars north and south when observing for lati· tude, or for the determination of the constant of aberration. The whole apparatus seems too hea\·y with cast-iron, and the telescope and its attachments t-00 bea>y to rest only on three points, yet Professor Foerster assures me it gives good results, and that the telescope brise exllibits no flexure of the prism or its mounting. The latitude level is checked by a second one of the same sensitiveness. Professor Foerster says that in a series of latituue observations two lei·els of nearly equal scale >alue and of equal precision are used to check errors of each other. He mentions that one detected certain unexplained irregularities in the main one, aud that these would have passed unknown but for the presence of the check leveL .A description of this uui\-ersal transit is girnn in the "Bericht iiher die wissenscbaftlichen Instrumente auf der Berliner Gewerbeausstelluug im Jaure 18i9 ;" this I have not seen, but I have examined the "Beobachtungs-Ergebnisse der Kouiglichen Sternwarte zu Berlin. Heft No. 3. Neue Methode zur Bestimmung der Aberrations-Constante, nebst Untersuchungen iiber die Ver· liuderlichkeit der Polbohe, ·on Dr. F. Kii,.;tner, Obser>ator der Sternwarte. Berlin, 1888. Ferd. Diimmlers Verlagsbucbhandlnng." 1n this pamphlet a short description is given of the instrument and the methods of observation, witli details of values of micrometer screw, etc.; and the measurement of the micrometer difference of zenith distance of the seven star pairs in which the observations extended through a year. Finally the correction to the Struve aberration constant is given, and the Yalue of the latitude with a probable error of ± 011 .04. I beg to call attention to a poi11t in the rnethou of observing tbe micrometer difference of zenith distance of the two stars of a latitude pair. Instead of observing only one micrometer read· iug of a star when it culminates, an average of four pointings is made at aml near the culmination of each star, and when the Ilroper corrections are applied to the measures away from culmination the mean of the four rea,1ing;; is taken as one. I introduced this method many years since, hut it was not adoptell; the last work of the kind I obser\'ed was in Oregon in 1886, and San Francisco in li->8i3. Elsewhere I show that with a properly prepared eye-piece this method of obse-rving is better than by ;:i, single pointing. The reduction:s are simple. About the strains in prisms iu the brise tele;;ci·pes, Bamberg says that now there is no trouble about the strain, uecause he bas so arranged his re\'ersing apparatns that it accommodates itself to tlrn mass to be lifted; first, hy the transverse beam having two knife-edge bearings at the ends anll a cross axis in the center; and then hy the two uprights of the ends of the transverse beam, which carries two friction rollers, beiug also free. Therefore, in raising the apparatus all the parts take their final bearings at the same instant, and all are nuder equal strain.

Yet this does not explain away Plantamour's statement of 18i8 to me, about the deformation <Jf his prism in front of bis objective. Bamberg says he so fits and secures the prism that there can be no irregular strain, but I do not see it. Levels.-The le;·els used at the Berlin Observatory are of the highest character. They are made by Reichel, who exhibited his method of working to me, whereby he gets a true figure all around the inside of the tube. He is a genius in his way, and as far back as 18i5 or 1878, when the I~russian geodetic officers directed me to his shop, I reported bis excellent work and comparatively low prices to the Superintendent; In his superior levels he uses an outside c~dimler with graduations equal to the inner one, and placed in proper relation thereto, so as to obdate parallax in the observation. His llest level tubes :have a space of 2°"" to 011.!), etc. I h:ive furnished to the Office the price.list of his tubes. Bamberg'11 diliiding engine.-Bamberg commenced the construction of this circle, which is about 4 feet in diameter, in 1875 or 18i8, when I saw the first rudimentary parts. He found, as all other mechanicians have done, many difficulties when it came to the final trials. He says he has now -Overcome them all by trial and correction. He knows the small remaining errors of the whole of the graduations. The work is all done lly hand, and each graduation of a circle is niade after the setting has been properly made over the graduation on the machine. The setting microscope microm· .eters have a power of about 120 diameters, and are placed about 4 or 5 inches apart. TT nder this power there is no difficulty whatever in making a satisfactory setting with the parallel micrometer threads on each side of a graduation. Ile says the average error of a 5' spaee is 0".4, with .exeep. tional errors reaching about 0".9; and that the excentricity of a graduated circle will be less than 1". In the personal work the operator continues the graduating for three hours and then retires for the day, more particul&rly to prevent the machine changing its temperature beyond a safe limit. I found the silver graduation circle of the machine free of oxidation, and he told me it bad not been cleaned since he had made the final corrections. I am not at liberty to state the alloy which he says surpasses all others for the purpose. Ile uses metallically encased thermometers lying flat on the brass graduating plate. He uses no mercury to give close contact between the metal and the thermometer bulb.

(Tkenrun1wter Stem.)

A hollow bar as a base bar.-Upon mentioning my idea of a bar filled with mercury for a base bar, Bamberg showed me bis experimental tube. It is about 1 metre long, cylimlrical, hollow, three.fourths of an inch in diameter, sealed at each end, with a plate screwed on the middle upper surface, with a one.fifth inch hole in the middle. Through this hole is the stem of a thermometer, with proper supports, and waxed in. The mercurial scale went up to about 600 C., iind at the upper part were two large irregular bulbs to hold excess of mercury when the bar was heated. The bar was filled with mercury and the thermometer stem inserted; the upper side of each end of the bar had a silver plate and cross line upon it for micrometer measurements. He says be found his main trouble in getting connection. between the mercury in the bar and the capillary .in the thermometer tube. He also found there was trouble with air in the tube, because he found

500

the changes of length of tube were not regularly indicated by the corresponding changes in the indications of the mercury. But he says he did not exhaust the subject, and gave it over. Of course it is easily seen that unless the intR.rior of the tube is very smooth and free from air all of Barn berg's troubles will be reproduced. This shows one of the weaknesseR of the'' gas-pipe base bar" proposed about 1884-5. I have had experience with the steel barometer which I have from W iirdemann, and appreciate the necessity for the high.est character of workmanship in e\rery detail of snch a bar. With Dr. Auwers I examined the Jena or" special" glass objective of Bamberg's figuring, and compared it with a 5-inch same focus ordinary objective in same tube. "Spooial" much superior in regard to achromatism. I saw an 8-inch ''special" which he prices at 4,500 marks, being one-third the price above ordinary glass. He says it is much harder to work. He bad a small hand draw-glass about 1-f inches, three glasses, 12-power. He makes Jena glass objectives from 3 inches upwards. (The prices of Brashear of Allegheny for the Jena glass objectives are smaller than the above, and his workmanship can not be excelled.) In reviewing the impressions which have become stronger with each investigation of instruments, I herewith report a few suggestions of the salient features which I have often presented to my colleagues and to the Superintendents. For the largest class of theodolites I prefer the graduated arc not to exceed 20 inches in diameter; graduation metal or alloy not rapidly oxidizable; graduations strong, to 5 minutes of arc; microscope micrometers to have power of about 40 diam· eters and to have adjustments for "run" by the obser\'er; the objective and eye-pieces of Jena glass; objective 3~ inches at least; eye-pieces with readily adaptable prisms for high azimuth stars; ocular micrometer; long vertical axis; straight telescope with strong tube, stiff enough to handle in reYersing. To reduce flexure of the telescope tube I would introduce four or six thin longitudinal pieces placed radially inside the tube, having their greatest possible breadth at the transit axis and diminishing to points at the objective and eye ends; two very light finders; long transit axis; no yertical clamps, or the Davidson open vertical clamp; fixed V's as now adopted; agate bearings of the pivots of the transit axis along the whole length of' the V's; the pivots to be large in diameter; the transit axis level A's to bear along the whole length of the pivots; ilJumi. nation free from instrument; high class transit axis level with protecting glass cylinder, gra.duated to avoid parallax and effect of reading-lamp heat; a thorough study of the harmony of all the parts; four large foot-screws; Davidson position circle. In transit instruments.-Best objective of inches and eye-pieces of Jena glass; parallactic plate to carry also high power eye-piece for slow moving stars; and with readily adaptable prisms for high stars; straight telescope, strong tube with two very light finders; thin longitudinal ribs inside the tube to prevent flexure as in theodolite telescopes; long transit axis; no vertical clamp, or the Davidson open clamp; fixed V's and the J)ivots to be of large diameter and to bear the whole length of the agate faced V's; the A's of transit axis level to bear their whole length on the pivots; double horizontal frame with movement and strong clamping-screws as in Davidson meridian instrument, but frames somewhat heavier; the uprights to be fixed, or folding and heaYier; light eye-pieces; high class transit axis level with protecting graduated glass cylinder to a.voitl parallax aud effects of reading-lamp heat; illumination apart from instrument; reversing apparatus of the character used on the large latitude instrument at Berlin Observatory, so as to avoid straining the tel1>scope; this apparatus to be attached to the pier and not to the instrument. In the installation I would have the foot-screws sunk into recesses in the pier so that the lower side of the frame is wry near the top of the pier; then level the instrument; reduce the inclination of the transit axis to a minimum, also the deviation in azimuth; finally, cement the lower frame to the pier. For stability four foot-screws, with a fifth one where the third one is ordinarily placed. The three to be used for rapid transit work, the four for protracted work. I use the fourth and the fifth foot-screws, and know the benefit thereof from experience and experiment. For transit and l<ititude u:ork with the same instrument, I have seen none that satisfy me so well as the Davidson meridian instrument. It needs some changes in detail and better ()bjectives and higher power. With higher power for latitude observations it needs a iiorizontal parallactic motion of the eye.piece to admit of broader field, whereby several observations may be made near the culmination of a star.

If the instrument is constructed in harmony with a 3 or 3z inch Jena objective and double level and a strong Davidson open clamp, it will do better work than the zenith telescope of the same objective. I think that all'' stove-pipe" eyepieces for the latitude and transit instruments should be made of aluminum, if practicable.
SUGGESTIONS ABOUT BASE BARS.

In the matter of base apparatus, the apparatus used at present in Europe is 4 metres long and a single bar, with two independent microscope micrometers. The bar which I saw at the Pavillon de Breteail, and which I understood to be the steel bar of General Ibanez, appeared to be about 1 centimetre thick and poosibly 7 or 8 centimetres deep. It had originally rested ou a fiat piece which was screwed thereto, forming a .l cross-section. It was found that there was flexure of one or both sections and therefore the upright moved longitu,dinally on the loicer. The 4 metres length on the bar is measured by two cross traces, one near each end. In the Brunner apparatus, exhibited at the military exhibit of the Exposition, the bar is compound platinum and brass, and the graduations on each near the ends serve to make a Borda thermometer of the bar. The 4 meires length is measured between two" traces," one near each end. The striking feature in these bars is that every facility seems afforded for the bars taking the temperature of the atmosphere as rapidly as possible. In the Ibanez apparatus I understand there are four thermometers and that the bulbs are brought closely into contact with the bar by being packed in iron filings. One bar only is used in measuring a base-line. In the field, heavy wooden tripods are carried for the support of the ba.se bar, a point of which near each end rests upon a brass apparatus resting on the tripod head. This apparatus has a motion in the line of the base, at right angles thereto, and around a vertical axis, and is raised and depressed a small amount. It can also be leveled by the three foot-screws. Slow motion is given by fine screws in the direction of the base and at right angles. The microscope micrometers are at each end of the bar, and are supported by three foot-screws on strong heavy wooden tripods. Above the feet the apparatus can be moved in two directions at right angles to each other. There is a telescope for determining the vertical over the station point. When this is done, this telescope is replaced by a telescope for alignment in the first setting up. The forward instrument carries a "mira," which is put in the line of the base and then replaced by an aligning telescope for putting the mira of a third microscope micremeter 8 inches ahead. These telescopes are then replaced by microscope micrometers which determine the position of the bar beneath them. It is not necessary to exemplify the working except to say that it is comparatively slow, even when the base-line is upon a macadamized and untraveled road; and that the force at the Aarberg base of 21400 metres length was twelve officers and ten assistants of the engineers, previously drilled by General Ibanez and his staff. See article by Dr. C. Kopp in "Die Eisenbahn," January 22, February 26, 1881. From a French officer who has shared in the operation of measuring a base-line in this way I learn that one of their sources of anxiety was iu the apparent vibration of the "traoo '' under the microscope micrometer. I understood that the maguifying power was about 100 diameters and that the walking of the observers and men upon the hard road shook the whole apparatus and distracted the observer at tile microscope. This is readily understood, but it does not follow that important errors are likely to arise therefrom. There is one source of error that can not by any means be avoided; that is the possibility of the forward microscope micrometer changing its position while the bar is being removed and carried forward, so that the microscope micrometer becomes the rear instrument. This would afford a. source of instrumental error ifa.ll the changes were one way, but in a. large number of measures it may be assumed that the errors arising from this and the preceding source will be equally possible to increase and to decrease the length of the base. The principal source of error appears to me to rest in the unknown temperature of the bar~ because I can not believe that the indications of the thermometers are to be taken as the actual tempe~ture of the bar at any given time. It is confessed that in some of the measured bases the thermometer showed a change of temperature sooner than the bars.

If we grant that all these sources of error can be corrected for, the method bas at first glance a very satisfying and alluring effect upon the observer, arising from(1) Accuracy in transferring from the base station to the bar trace and vice i·ersa. (!!) The accuracy of alignment of the bar. (3) The accuracy of measurement of the "traces" under high power. And yet the more I have thought the matter over and studied the manner ~nd completeness of preparation, the elaborateness and complexity of instrumental outfit (some special points depending wholly upon the instrument maker); the slowness of the operations and the large personnel; the shortness of the base and the necessarily rapid loss of value before the triangles of large extent are reached, and the exposed condit.ion of the bar, the Jess attractive the method becomes. In one essential the method is not readily applicable in the territory of the United States, where the cost of preparing the line would be excessive and its firmness and stability could never reach that of the European roadway, freed from traffic by military authority. In discussing with members of the Geodetic Association the method by which the Coast Survey has measured the Yolo and Los Angeles bases, I endeavored to elicit from them their daims for the practical advantages of tLe Ibanez and Brunner bars. None of the claims were of sufficient value to satisfy me that such apparatus could have been used to meas~rc either the Yolo or Los Angeles hases three times in less than one year of field operations. On the long bridges and crossing the railroads the method would have been very expensive and tedious; trains would have been held up and the excessive gralles would have been very severe. One strong objection made to the method of the Coast Survey was in the :!'tludge contact slide and the lowness of the power used in making the coincidences thereon; and it seemed to some of the delegates impossible that good results should come from such relative coarseness of index and slide traces and lowness of power, and especially when the measurements of a base were conducted with such rapidity as one hundred five-metre bars in ninety-i;;ix minutes over unfavorable ground. and at grades reaching 5°, and frequently wUh adjoining bars on large reverse grades. They objected to the idea which I have insisted upon, of a single bar and mercurial thermometers, but the non-conducting means I used to cover the bars was a novelty to them, and they c<>nld not gainsay the facts of observation. Notwithstanding many drawbacks of detail, the merits of the Coast and Geodetic Survey method of working come to the front with strong practical claims, and the more especially as certain details of instrument and work are susceptible of vast improvement. Moreover, the effect upon the extended sehemes of triangnlation in the United States has very dooided advantages in <>ur ability to multiply the number of bases and present results obtained under different climatic, physical, and instrumental conditions. In the very important matter of determining the temperature of the bar or bars at the time of the base measurement, I think the conditions adopted with the single metal bar and thermnme· ters (thereby really introducing two metals) are unfavorable for accuracy on account of the direct exposure of the bar itself to the atmosphere and the doubtful contact of the thermometers therewith ; and also the insufficiency of any such relation of the thermometers to the metal to determine its mean temperature. With the Briinner double metal type the exposure is a drawback, and the rates of receiving and losing heat by the two metals must be determined for each com· pound bar; (it must he confessed that our compound bar, steel and zinc, is a failure; zinc should never have been used). There is another drawback in the use of the open bar in the ha.ndling by men and the irregular approach of their bodies to the bar. To avoid even the open exposure of the wooden beams carrying our bars, my experience first ied me to cover the standard field bar with blanketing, steam-felting and canvas, on the Yolo base. This retarded changes of temperature very effectively, and profiting by this experience, on the Los Angeles base I covered the measuring bars and the field standard bar in a similar manner, with good result.a. I proposed to Superintendent Thorn tiO still further retard changes of temperature by putting more non-conducting material closer to the bars. As now covered, the ordinary changes of temperature occurring under the mova.ble tent cover during the measurement.&, do not rea.ch the thermometers near the bars for a.t least two hours. With the proposed protection 1

think changes will be retarded three or more hours. This retardation will be such that supposing measurements to commence at sunrise, the temperature of tbe bars will decrease for three or four hours and then rise the res" of the da_y. The tempera-tu.re of the bar is not given accurately by the Schott base bar of the Yolo and Los Angeles bases, because the bulbs of the thermometers are not even in contact with any member of the compound bar. lu some way, readily suggested, the bulbs of the thermometers must be brought into contact with the metal of the bar. By means of iron filings this must necessaril.'· lie imperfect. I have suggested reservoirs attached directly to the bar, just large enough to receive the bulbs of the thermometers aud containing a ;;mall amount of mm·cury, by which all parts of the bulbs of the thermometers are brought into metallic contact with the bar. I would use four thermometers to each bar, to be properly illuminated and read with magnifiers; these thermometers are read more quickly thau the Burda scalet:>. If a hollow rectangular tube should be adopted as a base bar there might easily be arranged four internal reservoirs to hold the thernwmeters with the metallic contact completed by mercury as above. The structure of the beam for carrying the bar desen-es more consideration than has been given to it. I learned at the Bureau of ·weights and ::\Ieasures at Breteuil that the Ibafiez base bar had a motion of the upper and -vertical member upon the lower and horizontal member which was screwed thereto. The base bar used at the Aarberg base is essentially a J. of iron with side pieces of wood aloug the lower part of the -vertical web. The former of these arrangements exhibits inherent weakness; the latter indicates that the temperature of all parts of the bar must he 80mewhat irregular. The Yolo base beams were 1rnrticularly faulty because they were made of "seasoned" hut a very poor specimen of wood. They were rectangular boxes, 16 feet long by about 5 inches lJy 3~ inches, and made of if-inch pine. In the bottom of each beam was a T-rail of iron, carr~·ing sixteen equidistant rollers, upon which the members of the zinc and steel were free to move if the apparatus was. in order. These beams were found warped when they reached the field at Yolo, and I believe they warped afterwards. The field standard beam was of the same material and dimensions and was liable to the same warp in gs. I have considered that the character of the lieam8 to be used should be thoroughly determined by experiments, as they would be used in the field. , Another thing needed with our bar is the better connection and adjustment of the aligning telescope, which I originally suggested. (Mr. Hlair made a claim on behalf of 1.fr. Hilgard as first proposing the aligning telescope, but I in·oduced my original letters to show my priority.) I close this report by saying that I have carefully examinctl the report upon the construction, comparisons, and other operations which have seemed to determine the equations of the new metri· cal prototypes. It is the official report presented by" le Comite International dc'5 Poids et Mesures" to the Conference General, September, 1889. I have also read the published descrip_tions of the methods employed at the Conser-vatoire des Arts et Metiers, after having examined all the apparatus and listened to the explanations of l\fr. Tresca. There is one part of my instructions which I have not had the time or material to fulfill, and that is the history of the Association GP,odesiqne Internationale. :Moreover, I think it can only lie written with the life in it by longer personal association with members who have been through its early years and its later development, and who know the moti\·es that have prompted aud guidetl much of it:s action. I am satisfied that a compilation from documents would lack the soul that actuates such an ortanization. Yours, very respectfully,
