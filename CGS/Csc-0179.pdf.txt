PARTS I A N D 1 1 .

PREFATORY NOTE. .In this report of the fiscal year 1895 the division into two parts has been retained, but both 1 , while possessing some advanparts are published in one volume. The octavo form for P a r t 1 tages, has Ijeeu found unsuitable for some of the scientific and profussional papers, especially those requiring extorided tables, and the quarto form is therefore readopted. P a r t I contains the historical portion. It presents abstracts of progress in field and ofice work, gives estimates for future work, and a statement of expenditures during the fiscal year. Part I1 contains the Appendixes which relate to the methods, discussions, and results of the Survey, with such illustrations as are required. The usual maps and progress sketches, showing in detail the localities and scope of the field operations, accompany the report; they belong properly to Part I, but for convenience follow after Part 11. Tho illustrations accompany tho Appendixes to which they respectively belong.

SPECIAL APPOINTMENTS AND SERVICE. I n accordance with provisions of law, one of tho Assistants of the Survey has continued to serve as a member of the Mississippi Biver Commission, aiid another, by apI>ointmcnt of the President, is a member of the lnternational Bouudary Commission organized for tlie location of that part of the United States and Nesican boundary line extending from El Paso to the Pacific. o t h i s duty mas temporarily During a portion of t h e fiscal year, howevor, the officer assigned t relieved, and reported to tho Superintendeut for regular service in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. A t the request of the honorable Secretary of the Navy, two Assistants wero temporarily detailed, one for special triangulation in connection with tho Iayiiig out.of a speed trial course in Long Island Sound, and the other for a survey on a large scale of the vicinity of the dry dock a t Port Orchard, Puget Sound. The detail of mi officer for the survey of` the Virginia oyster beds, at the request of the governor of the State, was continued duriiig a part of the year, or until the completion of the work, a i d another mas detailed Sor a short time, a t the request of the United States Coininissioiier of Fish and Fisheries, to make further examination of t h e oyster beds in Mobile Bay aiid vicinity. Also, ai1 Assistaut mas detailed, a t the request of the governor arid legislature of Virginia, to make :I special survey of the Fox islands, Chcsapealro Bay. The detail of an Assistant for tho Massschusetts triangulation aiid town boundary survey also continued during the greator part of tho fiscal year.

The special operations of this office have been carried on during the year, and tho usual amount of work lies been doiie for other Departments oftlie Government, mid for States, colleges, surveyors, manufac:turers, and others. Tho fiual coniparisons of the weights and measures for the Skates of North aiid South Dakota liavc bee11completed, and t h e sets wero forwarded to their rcspectivo desti1i:itions i n JUW. The new Riieprecht balance has beeii niouutod on a suitable pier :ind a careful test of its :iccuracy was made, with very satisfactory results; but unfortunately the rooni in wliicli it is mounted is not well adapted for the purpose, being so clamp that it is feared tho balance will s u l k if :I nioro suitable rooni is not soon provided. Further comparisons of tho "Coinmittee metre" and "Prototype No. 21" liuve been made, and althongh the results :we very accordant, thero is still a small OutstiLlldiIig discrepancy that is not accoiuited for. Tho rolatiori betweon the two standards will be redetermined by auotlier niethod as tjoon as opportunity oflers. The densities and inassw of the " S " sct of grainiue weights hiive been deteriiriued, and the results are given in the rcport of the Assistant in charge of weiglits : ~ n d measures.

EXPLANATION OF ESTTNATES,
The estimates submitted to the Secretary of tho Treasury for the fiscal year 1807 wore accompanied by the following oxplanstions : TREASURY I)EPARTMENT, OFFICE O F THE COAST AND GEODETIU SURVEY, IVanshingtow, D. G . , Septevtbev 20, 1895. SIR:I have tho honor to transmit herewith the estimates of :qqwopriations required for tho service of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey and Office of Construction of Standard Weights and Xeasures for tho fiscal year endiug June 30,1807. The aniount asked for "field expenses" is $ 1 0 000, as against $110 SO0 appropriated for 189.!j-!IG, an increase of $SS 500. An increase of appropriation under this head is necessary for tlie rapid and economical prosccutioii of surveys urgcntly demanded in the iiitcrest of comiiierce along our coasts, and for tho advnnccmcnt of otlier important field opemtions of the Survey. With a less amount tho parties of the Survey can not be employed to full advantage, as it is possible for them to remain in the field only for a portion of the available working months, while the expense of fitting out arid transporting partics to tlie field and roturn is tlie same for a short as for : L long season. The vessels engaged in the hydrographic portions of the work should be employed almost contiuuonsly to keep pace with tho demand for surveys and examinations in various important localities, but this will be impracticable with tlie amount appropriated for the current year. The original survey of the Cliesapcake Bay was mado inany years ago, arid siiico tlicn tliu erosive action of the tides lias washed away eiitire points, eaten into tlie shoro and deposited the material into the channel, so that neither tho shore linos nor depths of mater shown upon tho charts of this bay agree with tlie true coiidition of affairs a t the present time. These charts are thereforo defective and misleading, and hence the nccossity of an entire rcsnrvey of Chesapealre Bay. An item of' $5 000 has been inserted for continuiiig tho boundary survey between Alrtska aiid British Oolunibie and the Northwest Territory. An appropriation of $50 000 is also asked to commence the construction of a new vossel for work on the coast of Alaska and aluoiig tho Alentiati Islands. A snitablo vessel for this wolk is urgently needed to replace the Coast aiid Geodetic Survey steamer Hmslw, which ha4 recently been condemned as unfit for further service. The item for repairs of vessols is $SG 000 :is against $35 000 for the current year, a decrease of
$13 000.

Tho items of the estimate for pay of field force are identical with t,hose of tho appropriation for 1895-96, esccpt that an addition of $1 500 is asked for the pay of temporary aids. A slight increase in the number of tlioso employed uiitler this designation will be advantageous i i i enabling tho Siirvoy to secure the service of qnaliiietl young men who are willing to romain permanently in the sorvico with the hope of advmicoment to a higher grade. I n the appropriation for pay of office force, an addition of $200 per annum to the pay of one of the carpenters is asked. Tho master carpenter originally received $1GOO per annum which the last appropriation reduced to $1200. The present incumbent is a skillful joinor, as well as carpenter, and as the duties of this position deserve a higher compensation than those now paid, an increase from $1200 tp $1 400 has been recommended.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC: SURVEY.

It is proposed to iucrcase tho forco of copper plate engravers by tlic addition of one at $1 400 and one at $1000, aud to iiicre:ue t h o appropriation for ostr:i engravers by the :mount of $100. 1 l 1h e paragraph under the liead of `6 oflice expenses," coiitaiiiiiig an item for extra engraving, is
reduced, however, by tlio anionnt of $2 500, ~ L S the 1)roposcd increase of force will lesson the amount of extr:L ellgraving to bc, clone under contract. Under tlic paragrapli for `(1Slectrotypcrs and photokraphers, plnto printers and tlieir helpers," etc., it is proposed to iiicrcase the p:iy of four ciiiployecs froiii $1000 to $1 100 each, aud tlie pay of four ern1)loyeesfrorii $700 to $750 e;ich. The pay of these employees 11as been reduced by fbrriier appropriations below the staridaril paid for the sauie character of work elsewliere, :tud the r:ites herein rccouimcndecl :we riot yet up to the f d l staiidnrtl riites. In the force of coiiiputers it is recommended that oiic bo iucrcnscd froiii $1 800 to $1 GOO, and ono f`roui $1 400 to $1 GOO, i n order that tho rates of pay may conform inoro iicarly to the v:ilue of the services perfornied by iuclividuals. It is believed that these increases will add considerably to the eflicieiicy of tlic ofice force. The items of the estimates for Office of Constriiction of Staridard Weights and Measures are the same :is tliose of tlio appropriation for tho current year, except that a 1 1 iiicreaso of $300 is asked i i i the salary of the adjuster, whose services arc me11 wortli the increased amount recoiiimended.

Conliitzcution o f the topogrupl~ic reszirvey o f Boston Ilarbor and vicinity.-As stated in tlic rq)ort of' the previous fiscal year it had been decided to expedito the resurvey of' Boston Tlarbor a i i t l vicinity by putting in the field a force sufficient to complete the remaining part of the work i n : I single scason, arid five topographical parties were thcreforo organized in June, 1804, and a six tli in the following August. The parties were under the chergo respectivcly of Assistant IIerbert ( ; . Ogden, Otto H. Tittrnann, R. Meade @ache, Charlcs H. Boyd, Wasliiiigton I. Vinal, slid Dallas 13. Wainwriglit. Assistant Henry L. Whiting was charged with the general Sllpervision of the whole, and the various chiefs of parties were directed to confer freely with him in regard to sheet limits, metliods of delinentiou and generalization, arid other details, with a view t o secnring uniformity in these xiiatters in all parts of the finished map. Tlle work W:LY litit1 out 011 scven I scale of 1-10 000, nnmbercd consecutively, a n d cmbracing tho whole slioro line, projections, on : with bays, isl:inds, indentations, etc., from the viciriity of Cedar Point to the iiortlicrri l i m i t o f Naliant Bay, the width of the solid topography averaging about 3 Iniles,. but v:rrying, ac:cordiiig to local requirements; from 2 to 5 miles. To avoid tho expense of making a complete mrvey of tho streets of Bosto11 and ad.jiLcc1it o the city towns ant1 villages, access was obtaincd, through tlie courtesy of tlio 1oc:il officials, t engineer's maps, arid theso were reduced to tho scdo of the survey and phttetl iii thcir 1)roi)cr places on the topograpliical sheets, :I suficien t number of points of control bciiig first rlet~r~riiiied by tlie plane table to inake their accurate platting and orientation practicable. The greatcir part of tliis compilation was assigned to Assistant Wainwright, but some also done by tlie other parties. The limits of the work on the seven field sheets, as originally laid out, may bo givcn approximately as follows : Sheet KO. 1 extends from a point 1mile above Cedar Poiiit, northward to Minots Ledge Light, and westward to a small creelc about 2 miles east of' Ringham, embracing it11 area of topograpliy of about 10 square miles. Sheet Xo. 2 extends from tlio eastern limits of sheet No. 1, as above given, to Wcymoutli Foro River, and includes about the mme area of topography. Sheet No. 3 extends from Weymouth Fore River to Neponset River, embracing au area of about 8 square miles.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Topographical resurvey o f Boston Harbor.-Lynn sheet.-Tho party under the chargo of Assistant 0. H. Tittmann mas organized just before the close of the last fiscal year, and fiold work was commenced on Juno 15,1804, as mentioned in the report for that year. The section assigned to this party is covered by Projection No. 7 , arid extends from tho eastern limit of Assistant 1:~rdelln's work, about 1mile west of tho Point of Pines, to Phillips 13each, and includes a relatively narrow strip of topography. A portion of tho city of Lynn falls within tho limits of this topographic sheet, b u t only tho streets running to the water's edge, or near it, were deterinined by actual survey. Tho plat of tho streets farther back was derived from Byer's map of 1576, with such corroctioris as were indicated by Mr. Charles W. Gay, tho city engineer of Lynn. From Mr. Gay's records some heights were also obtained, which facilitazted tho trwing of the contour lines in tho city. Mr. Tittrnann reportfl that the principal changes that have taken place in this section since the date of the earlior survey aro to bo found in t,he artificial features; the most important of these being in tho dock and wharf lines i n Lynn Harbor; in tho railway crossings of Chelsea Creek and Saugus River; and those caused by the erection of inany iiew and prominent buildings. Many of tho old triangulation points having disappeared, Mr. Tittmaiin obtained from the Mamtchusetts State Topopaphical Survey, through Assistiint H. L. Wliiting, the geographical positions of a number of thoir stations, aud determined trigonometrically such additional points as wero necessary. Mr. Tittmann, in accordawe with the Suporintendent's instructions, conferred freoly with Assistant Whiting in regard t o topographical limits and methods of dolineation, and by tlie latter's direction the contour liues throughout tho work were referred to mean sea, level instead of to mean high water, as heretofore, this being also in conformity with the recommondations of the Topogra1)hic Couference held a t tho Coast and Geodetic Survey Office in 1892, Tho soaeou's work closed August 26, tho sheet assigned to tho party being completed by that dato, and Mr. Tittmanii disbanded his party and returned to Washington, resuming charge thoro of the Oflice of Standard Weights and Measures.

ToTographic resurvcy of Boston larbor.-l?ingl~am sheet.--In the topographic rcsurvoy of I3oston Harbor, tlie area covered by projoctiou No. 2, the Iimits of which have alroady been given, \vas assigned to the party under the direction of Assistant R. &I. Bacho. This projection, which has for convenience been designated the Hingharn sheet, inclucles in its arm the towns of Weymouth, North Weymouth, East Weymouth, and Hingham. Mr. 13ache reached tho working ground June 2G, organized Iiis party, a i d begsn tho erection of siguals on tho 28th. The necessary preliminary triangulation was executed by July 10, and the topographical work proper was inaugurated July 1 1 and continued until November 1, when the sheet was completed. Mr. Bache reports that this topography is of a mor0 intricate charactor than any he has ever seen within a like area, even in tho saxno region. With tho exception of a few great Ilills, the country is composed of a jurnblo of accidents of surface, varying from 60 to 80 feet in height complicated by wooded swamps at various olevations, and covered with iiumoroiis highways and private roads. The towns of Weymouth, North Weymouth, East Weymouth, aud Hiugham, wit11 their connecting roads interspersed with houses, practically form one coritinuous villago occupyiiig an area of nearly 8 mquare miles. On the completion of`the season's work the party was disbanded and Assistant Bathe roturnod to Philadolphia, Pa., and resumed charge of tho Coast and Geodetic Survey suboflico.

Topograplhn 1 resurvey o f Boston Harbor.-Roxbzcry sheet.-Projection No. 4, extending from tho Noponsot River to Charles River, was assigned to Assistant Charles 11. Boyd, wlio organized a party and began work on the southern part of the sheet on June 15. The area covered by this sheet, bosidcs containing a large varicty of natural topographical details, is thickly dotted with suburban villages and residences, and the clonse foliage of s h a h and fruit trees and ornamental shrubbcry, by rcstricting the view, interfered considerably with the exocution of the field work. Botwithstanding these dificulties, homever,fair progress was m:ide until August 26, when Assistant Boyd, in accordance with instructions, disbanded his party aut1 turned over tho instruments and unfinished sheet to Assistant D.

Baclw, was directed to conduct hydrographic surveys 011 the coilst of A1:issacllusetts. Work was begun on July 1G and closed Novem1)er 12. Of the four moirtlis occupied by this work a1)ont two weeks were spent it\ special hydrographic devclopmcnts i l l that portion of Boston Bay extending from Cohasset to Scituate arid in tlie waters of Broad Sound. Several discoveries of sunken rocks were made, antl concerning these special reports were at once addressed to the ofice. Between August 22 and September 20, a hydrographic resurvey of Lynll narbor, Saugns River, and Chelsea Creek was mado, and tlren the resurvey of the maters extending from Na1l:iut to Cat Island, includiiig the harbor of Marblohead, was talreii iip and prosecuted until Xovuinber 6. The general soundings in this area were completed, but special dovelopinciits remain to bo made during a subsequent season. A special examination, called for by supplemental instrnctions dahd July 5 , was made of Tinkers Ledge and of other shoal wattor to tho eastward of Tinkers Island. Leaving Marblehead on November 7, the Rache made a special examination of seveu sliod spot,s in the approaches to Boston Harbor, which had been noted in tho survey of 1803, ant1 which had been afterwards searched for unsuccessfully.

Topographic resurvey o f the shores o f Buzzards B a y , Nassachusetts.-A resurvey of Buzzard Bay being urgently needed, on account of the nuinorous changes reported since the last survey, completctl fifty years ago, four topographical parties have boeii assigned to duty in this region, and it is hoped and expected that tho work will be comploted this season. Owing to the lack of funds the parties were iiot able to take the field before the latter parb of June, so that the result of the resurvey can not be given in this report. The parties are uuder tho charge, respectively, of Assistaiits W. I. Vinal, Stehman Forney, D. B. Wainwright, and J. A. Flemer. .Hydrographic resurvey of New Bedford Harbor aiid a1poaches.-This being a part of the contemplated resurvey of Bnzzards Bay, and being of the first importance, Lieut. G. C .

Phpical l~ydrogruplL~.-~TortlL shore 03' Xuntuc1;et Island, .Mussachusetta.-At the beginning of the fiscal year, the party of Assistant H. L. i\Iarindiii was already in the field in pursuance of' instructions from tlie Superintcndent, dated May 17. The c:iml) was first located a t Trotts Llill, about 3 miles west of the town of n'antucket, and active field operations were b e y n on Julie 7. Nr. 3 5 . V. Safford, who had considerabla previous experieiice in this class of work, was assigned to the party as additional observer, mliile Messrs. 13. It. Griswold mtl IT. T. Mardial1 served as recorders, and Mr. Fred McElroy as tidal observcr. A crew of' ~iien to row the boat a i d assist in the topographic and leveling work completed tlie party orgtenixation. The main object of the expedition was t o secure accurate data for the coiistruction of a base map for comparison with future surveys, in order to detc~rniiiir, tlic nioveluents of the coast line and the laws and forces governirig thorn, b u t the survey also serves tlie immediate purpose of correcting arid supplementing the inshore hytlrography of the published charts. Tho survey of tlie southern shore of the island mas completed in 1891, but it was then decided that the survey should be evtcuded to include the retnainiug shores, and those of Marthas Vineyard also, in order to obtain a iiiore compreheiisive view of the effect of current a n d tidal action iu the locality. I n detail the work consists of laying out cross sections iiornial to the shore a t regular distances, and in souuding accurately along these lines until :I depth of from 30 to 3G feet is reached. The cross sections are then continued inland for a short distance by lines of Icvels referred t o the plane of mean sea level, as derived from a permanent tidal statio11 in the vicinity. In this instance the tidal station was Iocated a t Swain's Wharf, in Naiitucltct Il:irbor, aiid continuous observations were inado there from J u n e to September, but 8s the work progressed, temporary staffs were also erected a t various points, and connected with tho main station by simultaneous tidal readings. Perinanexit bench marks were establishetl a t various points, and coiinected by spirit leveling mith the cross-section lines and with the plane of inean sea level, as deduced from t h e tidal observations. By ineans of the data furiiislicd by Assistant Marindin i t will be possible , a t any time in the future to relroduce any or all of the cross-section lilies established by him, a i d a comparison of the elevations and deptlis then found up011 them, with those xiow existing, will shorn the nature and extent of the natural changes accom1)lislicd or iii progress. Any extension or erosion of the coast line, or its gradual elevation or subsidence, mill thus be indicated, and much light thrown upon important physical problems. The ordinary hydrographic surveys for chart publication iu the interests of iiavigetion mill not suflioe for such purposes, as in them the relations between land aud water areas are not determined, and moreover, the soundings taken near shore are not sufficiently iiiimerous, nor measured and located with sufficient accuracy. The meau rango of the tide a t Swain'g Wharf, as derived from 112 readings of high and low mater, is 3.07 feet, a result differing by only a few liuiidredths of a foot from that obtained from a long series of observations at the same point in 1854. The subsidiary tidal stations on Nantucket Island ~vere located a t Trotts Hill, Eel Point, Xaddequet Harbor, and Smiths Point, but the observations a t Trotts Hill and JIaddeqnet Harbor only were used in the reduction of soundings. The observatio~isa t Smiths Point indicate an interference both as to time aud range of tide, the interference being dlle t o thc opening in the south beach. How far the en'ect reaches into the sound mas not ascertained. By September G the circuit of' the Island was completed by connecting with the work of 1801 at Smiths Point, and the camp was then transferred to Marthas Vineyard and pitched between Edgartomn and Cottage City. From this point the north Shore Of Chappaquiddick Island could be reached and the work extended westward as far as the lateness of the season would permit. A self-registering tide gauge was established :et Edgartowii light-House, ant1 subsidiary gauges a t the railroad bridge and a t Bath House Wharf on Chappaquiddick Island. The mean range of the tide at Edgartomn tidal station was found to be 2-30 f'cet.

This work mas originally commenced in tho cities arid towns on, or near, tho seacoast heonuse of the advantages and facilities afforded by the numerous triangulation points of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, which gavo already-determined bases, but as the survey extended into tlie interior of the State tliese determined points became more sparse, and i t became necessary to interpolate others by nica~is of a secondary triangulation.

Van Orden, but lie \vas unable to take the field iu person until October 1, as ?le was engaged from July to September, inclusive, on runiiiug :I line of levels from Albany to Ilobbs Ferry, N. Y., as mentioned elsemliere in this report. Two other parties, however, wero i n the field early in the soason connectiug tho town boundaries with the existing triangulation ; these parties were under tho charge, respectively, of Messrs. E. E. Pcirve arid W. C. Hamley. Mr. Peirco continued the surveys in Middlesex County to the close of the field SeaSOIi of 1804, and in tho spring of 1895 transferred his party to the Connecticut River Valley, determining the valley tomriships f i orn tlie Connecticut State line northward. Mr. Rawley mas assigried to duty in the southeastern part of` Worcester County, and remaiued in t h e field froin Jiily to October. Assistant Van Orden took up the trianguIation east of tlie Connecticut River on October 1, and continued in the field until tht? end of November. Work was again resumed in the fipring, but Mr. Van Orden, having ineaumhile been granted a six month's furlough, the charge of the party was given to Mr. ,James B. Tolley. The work was Atill iu progress a t the close of tlie fiscal year. The original descriptions of the maiu triarigulation stations, with sketches, their geographical positions aud other data necessary for the prosecution of this work, have been furnished to the State Cornmission by tho Coast and Geodetic Survey Office. Assistant H. L. Whiting, in addition t o his duties in connection with tho State. survey, has had general supervision over the survey of Boston Harbor and vicinity, as mentioned under that head, and from tiriie to time inspected the work of the topographical parties; lie has also continued to serve as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, and attended the various meetings of that body during the year. The first meeting was held a t New York in August, 1894; the second a t St. Louis, Mo., in November, and ou this occasion the semiannual inspection of tho river from t h e mouth of tho Ohio to tho head of the passes was made; tho tliircl meeting mas also held at St. Louis i n March, 1895, and the second iuspection of the river was theri made; the fourth and last meeting was held in New York in June, 1895. A special report on the changes in New Orleans Harbor was presented by Assistant Whiting a t the Jurie meeting of the Commission, and mill probably appear iii their :iiinual report. Hydrographic examinations, a d additional lqdrogruplq i~ Narragansett Bay and ricinity.-Tho steamer Xndeavor, under tlie command of Lieut. I J . I T .Garrett, U. S.

Continuation o f the topographic survey of the IIudson River.-Tlle continuation of the topographic survey of the Ilutlson River northward frou the work of 1892 was assigned to Assistant, J o h n IfT. Donn, who, as stated i n the last annual report, made his headquarters at Newburg, where the oiily steam ferry witliiu a radius of 16 iniles connects the two shores of tho river. It was found in geiieral that tho progress of improvements or the degradation caused by excavatioiis made by brick manufacturers had destroyed tlie reference niarks of t h e old triaiigulation near the river shore. It was tlierefore necessary to use the lino Prospect Hill-Bald Uill of the triangulation of 1854-1856-as a base for establishing new points required in topographic work.

Resumption o f the survey o f $?Le Hudson Eiver in t8e spring o f 1895.-111 order to expedite the completion of the lIudsori River survey i t was deemed expedient to detail two parties to this locality, a larger force being precluded by the limited appropriations and by tlie necessity of taking up other equally important work. Assistants John W. Donn and Williain C. Tlodgkins were tliereforo instructed t o organize parties and begin operations in the latter part of June, 1893. 13efore executing the topography, however, i t mill be necessary to extent1 the limits of the triangulation iu order to furnish the requisite geographical positions. Messrs. H. 1'. Izartl, Frank S. Nichols, and C. J. Slriniier have been assigned to Assistant Donn's party and Messrs. Ed. hfereditli and John J . Carlisle to that of Assistant Hodgkins; other necessary employees will be engaged i n tlic locality of the w-ork. The statistics of tlie seas011 will appear in the nest annual report. Leveling operations i v Xeic I'ork, j k o m Grcenbush to Dobbs Fcrry.-In the early part of the fiscal year Assistant C . 11. TTau Orden was temporarily relieved froni duty under the direction of tlie Town Boundary Survoy of Massachusetts and directed to riiii it double line of levels from the so called "Grist Mill" bench mark a t Greenhis11 to tlie Coast and Geodetic Survey primary bench " V " a t Dobbs Ferry. The party was organized and work begnu July 2 aiid continued to September 25, when the lines were completed. Mr. V:in Orden assumed for the height of the bench mark ; I t Grecnbusli tlie valuo obtaiucd by him i n lS93 when leveliiig to that point from Boston, and his result a t Dobbs Ferry is that bench mark i`Y'' is l0.3SS feet above meaii tide level a t Bostoii. A prcvious determination of tlie Dobbs Fcrry bcncli mark by :I line of levels froin Sandy Hook gives its elcvatioii abovc mean sea level of that pl;ico as 0.628 feet. This discrepancy-O.S63 feef-is ratlier large for the distance run, but does not necessarily iiit1iciLte nil error either in the line from Boston via Greenbush or in the one from Sniidy Hook, as tlie identity of the planes of mean sea level a t the two starting points 11as not yet beeii esta1)lislied. On the completion of the leveling work Assistant Viui Orden returned to Boston and resumed his duties under tlio direction of the Massacliusetts Topographical Tom~l Boundary Commission.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Co?ttinuation of the tidal record at the autonztctic gnz~gestation at tlic United States Nav?j-Yard, Washington, D. 0.-The self-registering title gauge, which mas set up at tlie Uiiitcd States NavyYard at Wasliington, I). C., in July, 1891, was kept in operation during the elitire year, under tlic charge of the cliief of the tidal division of the Oficth, aud, with the exception of' a few short breaks caused by ice dnring the unusually severe minter, the record was coutinuous. Precise leveling J>oni Riclmzond, Va., to Ilashington, I). C.--Tliis iinportaut line had previously been leveled i n 1SS4, but the computation of' the morlt developed a discrepaucy beyond the allowable limit of error, aut1 it was deemed necessary to revise the work. Iristruotions were accordingly issued March 2.5, 1895, to Assist:Lnt lsaac Winston to begin at the Riclirnoiitl bench mark :nid run a double simultaueous line to Washington. Mr. Winston left Washington on April 4,accompanied by Aid A. L. Baldwin and Messrs. (3. I " . Smith and F. C. S. Hunter, who Iiad been designated as members of the party, and reached Riclimiond the same (lay. Mcssrs. R. B. 1)erickson and F. C. Kendrick, also meinbers of tlic party, reported to Mr. \Vinston on his arrival a t Richmond, and the organization mas complete. The ilistruinents mere adjusted the following day and the necessary instruotiona were given to tho new rodmen, etc., and the regular work of' leveling was inaugurated on the 6th. The line begnu on the two bench marks cstablislied i n 1x84 and followed the route of tlie Richmond, Fredericksburg and l'otomac Railroad to Qnentico, and that of the Pennsylvariia Railrond froni Quantico to Wasliington. The old pennnnent bench marks of' 1884 at Ashland, Dosmell, Predericksburg, Alexandria, and Georgetown were recovered and connected with, and twelve additional 1)ermatient bericli inarks mere established a t other tomus along tho line. Temporary bench lnarlts mere also located a t intervals of 1 ltilonietre to ~ c r v as e coml)nrison points as the work progressed. ;);Tospecial tlifliculties were ericountcred soutli of Quantico, bot north of that point three long trestles I i a d t o be crossed. A calm day mas selected for this part of t h e work, and the iiistriin~entand rods were placed on the trestles a t the usn:tl distanc*es,h u t the precaution was t:rken of placi~ig a planlt :icross the r:iils for tliu observer to stand upoii mliile leveling. It wis found that iri this way the instrument was quite steady, aiid that good results could be obtained. As an :~tlditioiial check, the first trestle was recrossed by observing the wllole length directly from the banks, and the iigrecnient of results mas found to bc quite s:itisf;ict,ory. The bcncli mark 011the north abutment of the Aqueduct Bridge a t Gcorgetow~i(West Wasliington) was reached on Jiiiic 28, and the party disbanded and Assistant Wiiistoii returned to tlie office to coniplute his computations and prepared for fieltl work i n tho West. During the season a new form of leveling rod, devised and constructed at tlie Coast :uid Geodetic Survey Oflice, w;is usctl for the first time mid gave entire setisfactioii.

surveyed by the United Statcs engineers being omitted. Captain Abbott gave the party access to his unfinished topographical sheet, coveriug the greater part of the harbor, and allowed them to malm a tracing of his shore line. The low and marshy banks of the Cooper and Ashley rivers are overflowed a t every high tide, and the irregular line of marsh grass forms the only visible line of demarkation, and i t was therefore considered that tlie determined ends of the sounding lines would. define the high-mater shoro line sufficiently well, as well in fact as i t could be determined by other iiieans. The city frolit, shore line, wharves, etc., as shown on the tracing, were surveyed by the erigiiieers prior to the heavy gales of two years ago, aud in order to bring theiri up to date sextant positions and measurements, as well as souiidittgs, were titlteii by Lieiitenmit Garrett's partly along the entire city front. The shore line of Norris Islalid was fouiid to have undergone coiisiderable change siuce the date of the old survey. The recent triangulatioii of the Coast and Geodetic Survey loft little to be desired in tlie way of determined points, aiid very few a.dtlitions1 sign:ils wero reqaired to be built,. With the exception of some soundiiigs close inshore, and a few special developnieiit L small boat was needed, tlie entire iuside harbor work was doiie by means of' a lincs, for.wliich : %foot naphtha launch ; the outside sounding lines mere necessarily run with the steamer. The plaiio of reforelice for the reduction of the soundings is that derived by the United States engineers from tlie Coast mid Geodetic Survey gauge a t Port Sumter, but coiiiparative gauges were set up a t other poiuts also, and whenever practicable the soundings were referred directly to the gauge nearest to them; in other cases a timo correction was applied aiid the reductions riiadc with reference to the Fort Sumter gauge. Special developments were made of all shoal spots found i n or near any clianiiel or fairway, aud this part of the work was done so thoroiiglily that it is belicwed that no further resurvey of tlie harbor mill be required for iiieuy years. Thc old ;Main Cliniinel has partially filled up aiid is now practically abaiidoiied in favor of the Jetty Chanuel, bnt sounding lines wore run over i t sufliciently close bgether to afford means of correcting the charts.

UNITED STATES COAST AND QEODETIC SURVEY.

Examination of Charlotte Harbor entrance and search for reported skoal.-The steamer Baclie, Lieut. Robert G. Peck commanding, while en routo from Pensacola, Fla., to New York a t the close of the seasoti's work in the vicinity of Pensacola Bay, in accordance with iiistrnctious, stopped itt Charlotte Harbor, Florida, for the purpose of investigating a shoal wliicli had been reported by Capt. Thornas Jackson of the British s-mer BeuconsBeZd, as existiug about 4 miles SW. Q W. from tlir eirtmuoe bnor, and also making a reexamiuatiori of the bar a t said entrance aiid determining the Imition of the light-house. The Bache reached Charlotte Harbor oil the 13th of May and worlc was begun a t once. A thorough search, in which Lieiiteiiaiit Peck was assisted by all the pilots of Gasparilla Island, failed to discover the alleged shoal, although a wide area was examiuetl ;ind sounded, and Lieutenant Peck reports that lie is satisfied that no such shoal exists. The pilot W ~ J O took t h e Beaconsjield into the harbor was one of those who assisted in the search. A thorough examination was also made of the channel leading over the bar ant1 into Charlotte Harbor, and the w a l l e d 16-foot shoal i u the channel way was dofiuitely located. Sundry prominent objects suit. able for land marks and ranges were determined, after which tho Baclbe proceeded on her way to Xew Pork, where she arrived May 25. flxamination of Palatine Shoal, of Tampa Bay, P1orida.--In accordance with instructions, Licut. Robert G. Peck, commaudiiig the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Bache, while en route to Pensacola Bay to continue the hydrographic survey from the poiut reached by the steanier Illulie during the previous year, stopped :it Tampa Bag for the purpose of inakiug ;LU examiiiiitioii of the Palatine Shoal, and determiniug the position of buoys, beacons, ~ h a r v e s arid , prominent buildings. The Uache arrived a t Tampa Bay January 25, and after some delay, due to bad weather, ;i siifficieut number of old statiolis were recovered and the work of sounding proceeded. Three slio;il spots were found, the uureduced depths being 194, 19#, and 204 feet, situated respectively iil)out 1!)7 metres west southwest, 168 metres southwest, and 344 metres soutli by east from tho I I . S. buoy placed to inark the shoal. A careful exaiiiiriation was made of the whole locality, but these were the least depths fouiid. The soundings wero takeii a t about half tide, but as 110 tide gauge was set up the auiourit of reduction @ be applied is uncertain. It is probable, however, that iis the wind had for some time been blowing constantly froxn the southward the general level of` the water was raised considerably above the normal, and a reduction of 2 feet would not seem excessive. The objects determined for indication on the chart were the entrance buoys, tank of quarantino station, wharf of quaraiitine station, liousc near uortli elid of A~iiia Maria Key, new beacons in the north and southwest channel8, pilot lookout st;ttion, hospital of quarailtine station, mid house near soutli end of Egmont Key. Lieutenant Peck reports some changes in the shore line siuce the date of the last survey, especially a t the north end of hfullet Key, where a considerable amount of washing away has takeii place. The Bache then proceeded to Peiisacola, where she arrived February 3. Her work in that region is described in the following paragraph : Completionof the topographic resurvey of Pensacoh B a y and its tributaries.-Under instructions dirted December 17,1894, Assistant 1'. A. Welker proceeded early in January to Peusacola, Fla., and organized a party for the completion of tho survey of the remaining parts of Pensacola I3ay iind its tributaries. The schooner Transit, beiug of light draft, was placed a t his disposal, the first work beiug in Big Lagoon, where the waters are shallow; but subsequently the party was transferred to the schooner Quick, a m uoli niore comfortable and commodious vessel. Amistant Johu Nelson and Aid R. L. Paris were assigned to the party, and reported to Assistant Welker at I'ensacolaYn time to assist in the fitting out mid equipment of the vessel. Field operiitions were beguri Jaiiuary 11, arid as most of t h e old triangulation poilits were recovered withoutr (lificulty (some of the siguals still reinainiug standing), the interpolation of but few additional points was necessary and the topographic work proceeded witliout delay. Corisiderable stonily weather was experienced, and some time was lost in consequei~ce, but nqvertheless the progress luade was very satisfactory. Mr. Welker, in his report, expresses his high appreciation of the ex(:ellcnt services rendered by Assistaiit John Nelson nud Aid It. L. Paris, and attributes much of the successful outcome of the season's work to their zeal aud efficiency.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

on tlic lStli of March, arid as tlie reconnaissance had prcviously I w i i completed and sites wlected for the observing stations, the first worlr to be undertalrcn was the lmildirig of the bignals. The experience gained on the transcontinental arc i l l rldiatl:i, Illinois, and Ohio had amply domonstrated the practicability of attaining a liigli tlcgree of accuracy in the I I I C ) : I S U ~ ~ I ~ C of XI angles ~ from towers 100 feet or more in height, and on :iccount of tho great economy of time resultiiig from their use in a heavily timbered country, tlie reconiiaissaiicc i n Alabama w:is iriade with a view of building liigli signals rather than resorting to the cuttiiig of cspensive lilies of sight through tho

heavy timber. Furthermore, the new method of builtling signals, devised by Assistant Perkins, has materially lessened tho cost of such structures, tho signals built during this season occupying each, on an average, only Reveil and :I half days, cscliisive of time spent in traveling from one point to anotlier and getting the lumber OIL tho ground. By the 8th of J u n e six towers mere completed, their hoiglits ranging from S O to 120 feet, although an unprecedented number of rainy days (thirty-three)occurred during May arid June. Work was carried on through the rains regardless of coiisideratioiis of personal comfort. By June 8 the allotment of funds for the work mas so nearly expetlded that it WLS necessary to reduce the numerical strength of the party for tlio remainder of the niontli, and the signal building was therefore discontinued iiritil tho n e w appropriation becamo available. The time was utilized, however, in verifying lines of sight arid executing such euttiiig as was essential. The party is still in the field, the observing to be talreii up as so011 as all the signals nro erected. The results of' the coniplete season's work will be given in tlic next aniiu:il report. Laying out o f a true meridian line ut Terre Ilnute, Ind.--Iu October, 1804, Assistant G. R. Putnam, while occupying the Terre Ilaute Station for the detcrmination of' gravity, laic1 out, a t the request of Prof. JI. A. Howe, a true meridian line for tlie use of engineers : i i i d local survcyors in testing tlie needles of their cornpasses and determining the changes of maglietic declination. Geodetic operations.-Continuation o f the triangulation in aortltcnstern 2'ennessee a n d soiitlieastern Kentucky, and along the Kei~tucky,VirgifLiu,ccnd Tennessee Stutc lines.-On tlic 11th of June, 1894, the party under the charge of' Prof. A. 11. Buchanan, Acting Assistaut, took the field for the extension of tlie Tennessee and Kentucky triangulation t o the northward and eastward toward a junction with the primary work lying betwcen tlie Maryland and Georgia biise lines. Work was continued until October IS, when the party was disbanded and Professor Bucliauan returned to Lebanon. Good progress was made duriiig the season, and the weatlier, except when the party was occupying llogers Station, was generally favorable. A t Rogers Station a l011g period of unusually hazy and foggy weather seriously delayed tho party, the occupation of that station consuming ten weeks. Bonn High BluB, on the otlier haiid, also a primary station, was colilp~eted in two weeks. Thc party was again organized, and took the ficld about the middle of June, and is now making the usual progress. Pour addition:il statious were established during the ycar, and horizontal and vertical measures were xiiacle at three primary and six secondary stations, tho former being at English, Rogers, arid Itoan High Bluff, and tlie latter at Chimney, IZolston, Clinch, Uriston, D u m , and Ihmascus. A sltetcli showing tho progress made and the telative positions of the stations occupied, accompanies Professor Buclianan's report.

The work \\`as utlder the charge of` Assistant G. It. Putiinm, :md tlie reference or base station, as before, mas the one specially fitted up for the purpose in the basement of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Office at Washington, D. c. This line of gravity stations was carefully SCkCtcd, and, iiicludiiig as it does a wide variety of orogralihio features, illid altitudes varying from 14 to 4 285 metres above sea level, is peculiarly well at1:ll)tcd to throw light on the continental variations of gravity, tho proper method of reduction t o sea l e \ d , alid questions rclatiiig to the IlatUrO and couditioii of the citrth's crust.

with the application of gravity measurements to the problem of tho earth's figure. Several ststions were selected on account of peculiar local features, and others with a view to obtaining data for computiug tho earth's mean deiisity. The comparison of results with diifercnt kinds of apparatus and with pendulums of different lengths was also borne in mind in the selection, and four of Commandant DeBorges's stations of 1893 mere therefore included; also at threo stations, in addition to the regular observations with the 1i:df-secoud pendulums, independent observations with a quarter-second (one-sixteenth metre) pendulum apparatus recoritly coiivtructed a t the Coast and Geodetic Survey Offico were made. Tbe latitudes and longitudes of the stations were mostly derived directly or indirectly froin previous Coast and Geodetic Survey cletorminations, but a t eight stations they were determined by actual Observation, tho latitudes by tlie usual method and tho longitudes by clironometric diflerences of time. Tho elevations wero obtained from the inost accurato data available. As Mr. Putnsm's detailed report on this work is publishetl i n full as Appeiidix No. I, in P a r t 11, of the Eeport for 1894, i t is not necessary hero to give a dcscriptioii of the iinprovod instruments used or the methods of observations adopted, but siml)ly : L brief notico of tho stations belouging to tlie three geographical divisions.

A t Denver, Colo., tlie pendulum apparatus was supported by large stones cemented to the concrete floor of tlie bascmeiit of tlie Chamberlain Observatory of the University of Denver, located in University Park. The station is a short distanco south of the equatorial foundation. Latitude 390 40' 36// N., longitude 1040 56' 66" W.; elevation above mean sea lovel, 1638 metres. The base station for all of the above is a massive brick pier with capstone, built in the "penduluni room" of tlie southwest corner of the bssemciit of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Office a t Washington, D. C. Latitude 380 53' 13/' N., longitude 7 7 O 00' 32" W.; elevation above mean sea level, 14 metres. The season's work closed on October 26, when, the available funds being exhausted, the party returned to Washington. The average time required per station, including traveling and all incidental delays, was only five and one-fourth days, aiid the average expenso per station W a s approxiuiately $60. This rapidity of vork was largely due to remarkably favorable weather conditions, there being only two d:tys' delay during the season caused by inability to obtain time observations. The work a t a station comprised the setting up axid adjusting the apparatus, swinging the pendulums continuously for at least forty-eight hours, making time observations each favorable

Certaiu additional work was also carried on, as follows: The testing of a set of smaller pendulum by swinging them simultaneously with the others at three stations; testing the wear of tho peiiduluni knife edge by swinging the half-second pendulums on an :idditioiial standard edge a t two stations; and laying out of meridian lines at Colorado Springs, Colo., aud Terre Haute, Ind. 0 1 1 Assistant Putnam's arrival at Washington he reoccupied tho Washi~igton base station, determining the periods of both sets of pendulums; he also investigated tlie temperature coofficieiits of the small pendulums and comploted and checked his records arid coniput:ttions. He \\`as then cmployed on miscellaneous office duty until sent again to the field on telegraphic longitutle determinations in the Southwest, as described in another p i r t of this report. From July 1 to September 1G Mr. Putnam was assisted by MI-. C. E. Mendenhall, estm observer, but after that d a h he executed the work alone. The importance of gravity deteriginations, aside froin their bearing on probleins of geodesy, is becoming widely recognized, especially in geologic research. Mr. 0. K. Gilbert, of the United States Geological Survey, who during the surnnier visited teu of Assistaut Putuam's pendulum rosults, stations for the purpose of making a study of the geology io connection with tlie gra~7ity has made ail interesting report 011 the subject, which is published with Assistant I'utnam's papclr in Appendix I, Part 11, Report for 1894.

Geodetic and topographical operations i n Miniiesota.-Contintiation of the triangulation atid topography in the vicinity o f Alinneapolis and St. l%ul.-At the begiuning of the fiscal year the party under the charge of Assistant W. 0.Hodgkins was stationed a t Minneapolis, having hegun the preliminary operations in June, iu consequence of a previous request froin the State topograplier and the regents of the State University, for the deterrniiiation of additional points in the vicinity of the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, with :I view to inatiguratiiig :i topographicd survey of . the State of Minnesota. After conference with the State topogr;tliher, Prof. Williani R. Hoag, it had been decided that as far a8 possible these points should be deteriiiinetl by the graphic methods of the plane table, and at his suggestion it was furtlier decided to extend the work froin the niere determination of trigonometric points to a thorough cxj)osition of the rnetliotls in use iii the Coast :11id Geodetic Survey for tlie determiiiatioii of topographic foriris and ai*tificial detail. Tliis proposition, contemplatiug the instructiou of the State topograpliers i n 1 he use of the plane t:tblr, mid being, therefore, of benefit mainly to the State topograpliioal snrvey, was approved ;i11(1 accepted by the Superintendent only 011 the condition that the State of Rlii~iiesotashould bear it11 expenses of the work except the pay :uid siibsisteuce of Assist:int Hoilgkiiis aiid Acting Atcsist:iitt W. It. Hoag, the latter being also an active rneriiber of the party. After coml)letiuga pro.jectioii on i i scale of 1-20 000 it W;LR found that the iiuiriber of triairgulatiou poiiits i n sonie sectious wis rather limited, aiitl ;I few additional ones were addcd in the usual nianuer. The priiicipal statioiis table and lines obtained to a large nuinber of the triangulation were theu occupied w i t h the plaJlf3 of prominent objects, the intersectiou of` these lines coinplcting the deterinination of the objects observed upon. Numerous other points were determinetl by the ~netliods of' resection, nud tliesc! methods were also carefully expiained to tlie State topograpliers. Heights were also deteririiiie~l a t each station by means of vertical :uigles. All the topographic details o1)t;iinnblc a t :lily statioii were delineated before moving to the uext, atid filially a coinpleto topographic survey of` a portion kriown as the "midway district" was taken up mid cnrrietl as far as the remainiug tiuie a t the disposal of the party would permit. During the season, as opportiinity offered, detailed surveys were made of detaclied localities of special interest, e. g . , Minuehaha Park with the celebrated falls of that nanio, portions of lakes Como, Amelia, Cedar, etc., and a part of t h e Mississippi Hiver, iricludirig the famous falls of St. Anthony. The country included within the limits of the topographical sheet is of` a rolling character, rising rather gently in gerieral from the edges of the gorge through which the Mississippi ltiver flows, but in the viduity of St. Paul the hills rise more abruptly froin the river.

I, iii Part I1 of` tlie Report of tlio superintendent of tho United States Co:ist aiid Geodetic Survey for tho fiscal year eliding ,June 30, 15!)4. Continuation of tlie precise leveling in Missouri and Arl;aiun~.-Assistaiit Isa:tc Winston, urider iiistructioiis dated June 8, 1894, proceeded to Lamar, Mo., leaving Washington on the 15th of June and arriving a t the working ground on tho 17th. Tlie party was a t once organized aiid preparations made to begin work, when it was discovered that the instrumoiit liad suffered daiiiago in triinsportation, rencleriug i t necess:iry to send it to Washington for repairs. Another level was ;it oiice form-ardecl so that only a few days7 delay was caused by tlie accident. The t h i o mas piwfitably spent in training the rodinen and recorder iii their respective duties. 0 1 1 June 28 tlie iiew instrnment mas received froin Washington :ind leveliiig operations were comnioiiced the same day. The two bench marks established a t tho close of the previous season mere found in good condition sild undisturbed. Coriuection was iiiade with both arid the line of levels was carried soutliwartl along the Lexington and Southern Division of tho Missouri Pacific Railway a t Carthago, Mo., tholice :~loiigtho ICaiisas Division of the St. Louis and Sari Praiicisco Railw:iy to Monott, Mo., aiid thciicc along tlie Texas Division of the saiiie road to Chester, Ark., whore n juilction was made with two bench marks whose elevation above the mea11 level of tlie Gnlf of Mexico had been previously determined. This closed the gap in the line from the Gulf to Kansas City, and completed tlie season's work 011 October 9. The season's work begnii on tlio rolliug prairie or table land of soutlimest Missouri and extended in the inountaiiious region of northwest Arlransas, and tho line, for convenieiico, followed closely the roadbed of tho railroad, oxcept a t Winslow, Ark., wliero it was taken over tho mouutain to avoid the railroad tuiuiel a t that place. A check line was, however, suhscquently run through tho tunnel. Tho method of`observing mas tlie smile as before, viz, two simultaneous liirea wero run in ono direction. Mr. Winston reports that no special obstacles mere oncountered during the season, but that very heavy grades were found in tho mountainous region from Winslow to Chester, thare being a t one place a fall of over 300 metres hi a distance of 18 ltiloinetres. Solno delay was caused by tlio strong wiiids peculiar to that region, but most of the route mas protected hy adjacent hills or forests, and very good progress mas made during tho season. Bench niarlrs were ostablislied a t the various towns and villages along tlio line, and tlie elevation of the railroad track a t each railroad station \vas deteniiined. Velocipede cars mere used by tho party as a daily nieaiis of transportation to aiid from work, and proved very egective, and also resulted in a great saving of both time arid money. MI. E. M. Stayton served as recorder in the party during t h e season, and assisted on the officework, The field computations have been completed and shorn very satisfactory results. 5 .Doc. 28"

A t the close of the season Mr. Winston mas excused from duty for ten days, after which he returned to Washington, and mas engaged in computing his field results and on other office duty until again sent in the field in Virginia. His services in that section of the country have alroady been noticed under the proper head. Sitbsequently he was directed to resume leveling in Kansas on tho Transcontinental Line, special notice of which mill appear farther on in this report. Longitude determinations B!J exchange of telegraphic signals at statzons i n California, New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.-For the completion of the main scheme of longitudes in the southwestern part of the Uiiited States, the differences of longitude between Needles, Cal., and Santa Fe, N. Mex.; Santa Fe, N. Mex., and El Paso, Tex. j El Paso, Tex., and Austin, Tex.; Austin, Tex., and Galveston, Tex.; Austin, Tex., and New Orleans, La.; Austiu, Tex., and Laredo, Tex., mere required, and these determinations are of further importance as furnishing connections with the series of longitudes determined in 1892 for the International Boundary Commission. All of these lines, excepting Austin, Tex., to Laredo, Tex., are of tho primary class, requiring ten nights' simultaneous observation at each eud and an interchange of observers i n the center of the series to eliminate eftects of personal equation. The charge of this work was assigned to Assistant C. H. Sinclair, with Assistant Edwin Smith in charge of the cooperating party. Messrs. Sinclair and Smith left Washington on February 1, 1895, the former proceeding to Needles, Cal., and tho latter to Santa Fe, N. Mex., and immediately preparing the statiolis for occupation. On account of the excessive heat prevailing a t the Needles during a large part of the year i t mas desirable to make tlie observations during the winter and early spring, and therefore these station8 mere first occupied. A t Santa Fe, however, the season selected was not t h e iilost favorable, as on account of its high altitude severe cold was likoly to be experienced. While tho party was at this station temperatures as low as 15 degrees below zero were recorded, but this was uiiusually severe for the month of` Fcbruary. A t tho Needles, during tliu samo period, i t was not neccssary to have fire in. the residences or in tlie observatory. Cloudy weathur prevailed to such an extent a t the Needles during the month of February that only fivo exchanges of siyids were obtained, viz: On the Sth, 17tmh, 18th, 22d, and 27th. As this completed one-half the reqniretl series the observers exclianged stations, Mr. Sinclair proceeding to Saiitn P e and Mr. Siuitli to the Needles. The remaining required exchanges mere obtained on March 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10, tlins completing the line. A t the Needles the old longitude pier, located in 1889 in the grounds of the Catholic Chnrch, was found i n t v t , and was utilized for the new observations. Latitude was also determilied b y means of Zenith Telescope No. 6, using fifteen pairs of stars, and seventy-ono observations wem made on five nights. Tho latitude station, a temporary wooden structure, was locatod 50 inches due west of the longitude pier. I n Santa F e the statiou of Lieutenant Wheeler, of the United States Engineers, located i n the parade ground of Fort Marcy, and used by tho Coast and Geodetic Survey in 188G, W;IS reoccupied. The pier of this station is t~ single large block of stone. The lines, Needles to Santa Fe and Santa Fe to El Paso, close two of tlie great circuits in the longitude scheme, and by the tield computation of Assistant Sinclair the closing errors seem to be very small, being only nine-thousandths of a second in one cast) aud twentythreo-thousandths of a second in the other-a very satisfactory result. Magnetic observations, declination, dip, ant1 intensity were also observed a t both statiom by Assistaut Smith. On the completion of the line, Assistant Smith nioved tho Needles instruments and outfit to El Paso, Tex., Assistant Sinclair remaining at Santa Fe. A t El Paso, Mr. Smith found the pier and ObSerVatOry erected in 1893, in the old Government cemetery (nom a city park) still standing, and Preparations for beginning observations were therefore soon completed. Signals mere excliaiiged between El Paso and Santa Pe on Marc11 15, l G , 19,2?1, aiid 22, and again. aftor the usual iiiterchange of observers, on March 24, 26,26,27, and 28. This coinpleted the line

Santrc Fe to El Paso, and tho instruments and outfit a t the former station wzro next nioved to Austin, Tex., by Mr. Smith, Mr. Sinclair remaining a t El Paso. A t Austin, in tho capitol grounds, is a large meridian mark built and establishod by Assistant William I<imbeck,of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, in 1892, aud the longitude pier of the present aeason w s built 14.5 feet to tlie northward of it. Signals were exchanged betweon El Paso and Austin, on April 7, 5, 9, 10, and 11, aud again, after intorchango of observers, on April l G , 17, 18, 20, and 21, malting t h e required number to complote tho line. Magnetic observations were also observed a t both stations by Assistant Smith. On April 23 Assistant Sinclair received notice by telegraph that hie wifo mas critically ill, and would probably not survive iunny hours, and immediately telegraphed for authority t o leavo the field :md proceed to his home in Clmrlottcsville, Va. This WIS grantetl, and :LS the time was close a t haud when it mould be nocessary for hini to resunie work on the resurvcy of the California slid Nevada 1)oundary line, Assistant G . R. Putnam was a t once detailed to take his place on tlie longitude work. Mr.Putnaiu arrived a t Austin on April 27, and mcanwhile Assistant Smith had moved to Laredo, Tex., and was preparing the pier and ObRervatory a t that place. `I'heso preparations were completed by April 29. and tlio regular observations were begun tlio saiiio night. Isxchango signals were obtained between Austin and Laredo on April 29, May 1, 2, G, arid 7, and again, after the usual interchange o f observers, on May 9, 10,12, 14, and 17, tlius completing the n addition to the observations portaiuing to the longitude determination, a full set of line. I magnetic observations for declination, dip aucl intensity w:is made at each of these stations by Assistant Smith, and gravity determinations were mado a t both by Assistant Putnam. These observations being made in the daytime did not interfero with or delay tho regular work of tho party. Latitude observations were also made at Laredo by Assistant Putnam. Mr. Putnarn then moved his iiistruinents and outfit to Galveston, Tes., and had th:it statioii roady for occupation by May 21, but owiug to continuous unfavorable weather, signals were uot oxchanged with Austin until the 2Gt11, and frequent interruptions froni tho same cause occurred after that date. The exchangos of signals botmcen Austin aud Galvcston were finally obtaiiied on the nights of May 2G, 31, June 1, 2, and 3, and again, after interchange of observers, on June 5, 6, 12, 13, and 16. A full set of niagnotic observations, declin:btion, dip ant1 iiitcnsity, was also made a t Galveston by Assistant Smith, and gravity dcterrninatioiis by Assistaut Putnam. Mr. Putnam also mado a trigonometric connection of the longitude stntioii a t Galveston with proruinerit points in the city. In tho gravity determination a t Austin, two 8t:btioiis were occupied, one in the State capitol, and tho other in tho State University. Assistant Smith then moved to New Orleans, La., and had that station ready for use on Juuo 21. Mr. Putriarn remained :it Austin, and exchanges of signals botwoen tlio two stations were obtained on three nights, viz, Jniio 23, 25, and 27, when work wns temporarily suspended iu consequence of tho departure of Jlr. Smith for Washington, his connection with tho Survey ceasing on Juno 30. Assistant A. T. i\Iosiii:in was then detailed to coniplete the programme of work laid out for the party, arriving a t Now Orleans on July 2. The remainder of tho 8oason's work, falling in a new fiscal year, will properly appear in the next annual report. It may here bo mentioned that whilo Assistant Sinclair was observing a t the El l'nso station, signals wore also oxchanged with tho Rloxicari Kational Observatory at Tacubaya, near the City of Mexico, and also wit11 tho Palacio Observatory, in tho City of Mexico. This wiis dono at the request of tho officiale of tho Tacubaya Observatory, for tho purpose of obtaining an accurate connection of the longitude system of the two countrios, equally valnable to both. A dotermination of the difference of longitudo between Tacubaya and St. Louis, Rlo. (Washington University), had been made somo years before, but as the observers did not oxcliange statioiis the error due to personal equation was not eliminated, and its amount was unknown. I n tho present cmo the interchange of observers was also omitted, but Signor Caiuilo A. Goheales, tho Moxican observer, mbscqucntly CRKN to Washingtan and observed mitli Mr. Sinclair at tho Coast atid Geodetic Survey Observatory, and also a t the United States Naval Observatory for personal equation, SO that the necessary correction to tho field observation^ can bo made. Exchanges of signals between El Paso and Tacubaya took place on nine nights, viz, March 29, 30, April 1,2, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, and 011 four of theso nights oxchanges of signals were mado also with the Palwio Observatory, City of Mexico,

UNITED STATES COABT AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The field computation of the nine nights' observations gives a probable error of =l=0.0087a in the resulting difference of longtiude. This is a very good result, especially i n view of the fact that tlie telegraph circuit was 1408 miles in length, and that there were repeaters :tt two poiuts in the line. Determination o f latitude a t Laredo, Yex.-The latitude of tlie station at Laredo, occupied by the telegraphic longitude party in the regular course of their longitude work, W:LS determined astronomically by Assistant G . It. Putnam, in May, 1895. Other stations dotermined incidentally in the same way will be noticed under their appropriate geographical Iicadings. Magnetic observations a t various stations in the State of Tcxns.-Tlie regular series of three days' observations of magnetic declination, dip and intensity were made a t El Pnso, Austin, Laredo, and Galveston during the months of Nay and June, 1593, by Assist:riit Edwin S m i t h , while occupying theso stations in the regular course of the telegrapliic longitude determinations, as noticed in another part of this report. These observations were merely incidental to the niain work of tho party, and were so srranged as not to interfere with or delay it. Determination of relative gravity with half-second pendzilzrns ut various stations i n Texas.During tlie progress of the telegraphic longitude work in the Southwest, described under its proper lieailing in this report, the spare time of the party mas utilized i i i making otlicr ohservations. In this may gravity observatioris were iiiade by Assistant G . It. I'iitnam at Laredo, Galvest,on, a n d a t two stations i n Austin cluritig the months of N:iy and Jane, 1895. Tlie improved apparatus heretofore described was used for this work, ;iritl the usual method of` observation was followed. The reference or base station, as in all relative gravity deterrriin:itioris, wis the oiic located iii the L`pendulunir001n'~ in the basernerit of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Oflice at W:isIiiiigtoii, I). C., the pendulums being swuiig there usunlly a t tlie begiiiniii,? aud eiid of each ficltl scaso~i. Conipletion of the reconnaisscince f o r a schenie of triangulution along tlic 1iio Graiirle, from El Paso, Tex., to the G U Y o f iMexico.-As stated in tho 1 8 ! ) 4 report, Assistant Sleliniaii F`orney, under instructions dated February 28, 1894, liacl resumed the recoiinnissance aloiig the Rio Grantle, his stations being selected or1 both sides of the stream During tho season, wliicli 1;rsted u n t i l Scl)tcniber 30, about 500 miles of tho river wereesarniiied, and 61 points for the triangulatioii selected ;uid marked. The area of country covered by the figures laid out is about 11 700 square iniles, :1nd a suitable site for a base line, 5 miles iu length, was found about 7 niilcs east o f 13row1~sville. Tlie country from Eagle Pass to Fort Iiiiiggoltl is liigli and rolling, the ridges being of` iicarly the same elevation, parallel to each other, and approximately at riglit angles to tlw ge~icr:llcoiirse of the river. The hills alternately approach and recede from tho hliores, slid the descent to the alluvial plain, which varies in width from a few Iiuntlred feet to several miles, is usually very abrupt. A dense growth of inesquitc brush mid cactus exteiids to the river banks. 0 1 1 tho JIexican side of the river the hills and ridges arc Iiiglier, but the general clisracter of tho coiintry is the same. Numerous creeks, dry or nearly so in sumnler, \vend their way to the river, fiquently forming deep gulches. From Fort Itiriggold to the month of the river, ;I distanco of` 140 iiiilcs, the coulltry is flat and slopes gcnt,ly to the Gulf. The saiiiu denso growth of iiiesqiiito : L I cactus ~ contiuues, and this section presented the greatest difficultiesto tlie reconiiaisaaiice, aiid will i~lvolvo cor~siderable esper~se in tlie esecutioii of the triangulatiou. M:LIIYof tlie statiolis mill rec~uiro tripods slid observing scaffolds from 25 to 79 fcet in height, and, omilig t o tlie hazy st ate of the atmosphere a t all seasons of the year, the use of heliotropes will be necessary, or the observations n4ll liave to be made by me:tiis of night signals, as suggested by RIr. Fortley in :I previous report. Tho country from Eagle Pass to Bromnsvillc was suffering from a protracted drougllt, but duriug August and Septembor copious rains fell, causing the river to overflow it8 banks, alltl iii a short tiino tlie iiarrom, sluggish stream became a wide mid rapid torrent. Such freshets prodnce g r m t cha~igos in the bed of the river, mhicli frequently shifts it position by coiisider:lbledistarices, so that it will probably be impracticable to trace tho chariiiel as it existed in 1848, at the tiinc of tlic sig1ling of t h e Guadalupe Hidalgo treaty. Tho portion of the rivcr below lii0 (;r;indo City will present sorne difficult questioqs for tho Boundary Commission to :lc!just mtl settle. The low, marshy regions near the moutli of theriver are frequeritly entirely covered with water, salt duririg easterly storms and fresh dnring river freshets. The pl'os1)ectof a good harbor at tlie mouth of the liio Graiido is very slight, tho bar beiug very shallow and frequcntly shlftiug its

The Morgan Line runs a steamer from Morgau City, La., to Ur:tzos de Santiago once every ten days during the spring itlid summer months, but later in the season tlie trips are irregular and uncertain, as ten to fifteen days :we sometimes lost in waiting for an opportunity t o reach tlie ancliorage inside the bar. Froni this point passengers and freight are carried by lightow to tlio wharf at Point Isabel and thence by a xiarrow gauge railroad to Urownsville. The Laguna (le la Madre, which flows into the Gulf of Nexico at 13razos de Santiago, extends to tho nortlimard the entire length of P:idre Island to Corpus Christi, but is navigable only for small boats. The triangulatiou froiii IC1 Paso to tho mouth of the lLio Gr:Lntle sliould be ttilten up anti pushed to coinplotion ut tlie earliest opportuiiity, but with tho preseiit very rostrictod appropriiltions this work will require :I iiiirnber of years.

Absolute determinations of the magnetic elements, declination, dip and intcnsity were mado on five days of each month duriug the whole period, but the March observationv were omitted in consequence of the loss of the magnetometer by robbory on March 9. The iustruirieiit was afterwards recovered, but not in season to obtain the observations. The instrumental constants were carefully determined and frequeii tly checked, and all observations for the determination of force, both oscillations and deflections, were msdc in the afternoon when the temperature, was most steady. 1)ecliiiation observations were always made in both morning arid afternoon hours, and the dip only in the afternoon, and time observations for the rating of the observatory cliroriometer were made once a month.

The earth-current observations were discontinued early in the fiscal yoar, as i t was found that t h e results were vitiated by the too near proximity of the electric car lines of Sail Antonio. During a fern days in July, however, BIr. Schultz was :mthorizetl to condnct experiinents a t ltockport, Tex., but these mcre without definite result, as abnormal weatlier conditions prevailed during their continuance. The observatory was finally abandoned on April 17, and Mr. Schultz returned to Washington, where he was engaged until thc close of the fiscal year in completing his reductions and computations.

F. Rodgers was already in the field engaged in preparatory \rork for the topographical resurvey of Sail Francisco Bey. aud Ilarbor. On July 9 the observing of horizontal angles on the supplemental triangulation was begun a t Candlestick Poiuf, and continued to Point San Bruno. The new points were computed, abstracted, aut1 platted on a projection, scale of 1-10 000, and the topographical work was then taken up from Point Avisadero southward. A second sheet was then laid out from Belle Air Island southward, b u t it was then fouud that owing to the disappearance of many of tlie points of the old triangulation, executed 1ie:irly forty years ago, it would be necessary to doternline a large number of new positions. Autliority for executing this additional work having beon obtained, Assistant Rodgers erected the necessary signals and began the extension of the triangulation October 24. Much delay was occasioned a t times by bad weatlier, and especially by the sinolcy coudition of tho atmosphere, and soino of tho longer lirios had to be postponed to a more fttvorable se:ison of the year. The party was eiigagocl alteriiately ou triangulatiou and topography until Decoiiiber 31, wlien on account of niifbvorablo weather conditions the party was temporarily disbanded. Assistnut Rodgers proceeded to Ban Francisco and utilized the time in completiiig his records a i d coinputntioiis.

Magnetic obserrations at Camon City, Nev., and at Lake Tahoe, Cal$ornia.--In November, 1804, magnetic observations, declination, dip and intensity were made a t Carson City, Nov., and Lalto Tahoe,-C$ifornja, by thc party engaged undor tlio hirection of Assistant C. H. Siuclair on the survey of tliQ:q!iforiii:i~,zi!j Nevadii-Obli& boundary line. This was dono a t the closo of tllo season and n711ils tho storing of tho camp out&, etc., w : in ~ progress, as stated in the account of the bouudery survey work. Tho statiou at-Carsoh -City was located in tho grounds of the Pardion and in tho mcridisu of tlie transit of $f.-C. I V . Friend's observatory, and one square south of it. The station a t Lake Taboo was located 2 5 iiietreidue south of tho longitude pior of 1893, near tho Lalresido Tavern a t tlio southeast ond of tho lake. Both stations are so marked that they can be recovered wlien necessary in tho future. M u g w t i c obscrocctioiu in the Btates of Washingto?t and Oregon.-During tho autumn and winter of 1804-06, Assistwit J. J. Gilbcrt was instructed to redetermino tho magnetic elements at various points i i i tho States of Wasliington aiitl Oregon. The first observatioiis were made a t Port Townsend, Wash., between tlio 13th aiicl 21st of November. Tho old magnetic station was occupictl, but on accouiit of local disturbances t h o period of observation w : a s extended several days beyond the usual time. Observations for ni;lgnctic doclination, dip and intensity wero nest made a t Olympi;a, Wash., during four days, viz, 1)ecember 12, 13, 14, and 15. On February 12, Assistant Gilbert proceedcd to Seattle and Tacoma, where dip only was required, duo day being spent in observations a t each plnc-o. 0 1 1 February 15 Mr. Gilbert proceeded to Portland, Oreg., and mado a full series of observations (luring t h e e days, viz, February 20, 21, and 82, a t the old iiiaguetic station in the grounds of tlio United States custom-house. Tlic observations a t this station subsequently proved uiisatisfa(:tory, arid it was fouiid that tho closo proximity of tho electric wires and other disturbing c:nises had viti;Lteti tho results. It w : nocess:wy, ~ therefore, to seloct a now station freo from such local disturbances, and this was dolie later in tho season by Mr. Gilbert, who revisited Portland for that purpose in Mnrcli, 1S06. Tlio new station, with tho consent of tho local anthoritics, WRY located in tho city l)iirI<,and obscrvatioiis for dcclination, dip aiid intensity mero obtained on March 6, 7: aud 8. 0111~cbrn:iry 24, 25, 26, ;ind 27 similar observations wero niado a t Cape Disappointmont, tlie old Inagiletic station w a r the house of tho light keeper being reoccupied; and on March 1,3,3, arid 4 a t T-ancouver, Wash. A t Vancouver the old magnetic station of the Coast and Geodetic Survey could not bo recovered, aiid ;L new one was thcreforo selected and carefully marlred for future reference. The ohroiionieter used in the magnetic work was mted by means of time signals te1egr;iplied from the Lick Observatory. Co,itinuatioib o f the liydrograplh surveg o f the Strait of Juaa de Fuca and Washington Sound, Washington.-As already stated, tho steamor Cfedney, under the comniaiid of Lieut. Lucian Flynne, was placed a t the disposnl of Assistant J . J. Gilbort, :uid tlio comnianding officer directed to funiisli every facility for tho prosecutioii of` tho triangulation and topography; also, as opportunity aEorded, to mako a hydrographic survey of Wasliington Sound in the vicinity of San Juan, Oreas, and Stuart islands, and of the Strait of Juan do Puca from the vicinity of Port Angeles to Wlridby Island. Tho hydrography is embraced on seven sheets, two of which relate to tho Strait of Juan de Fuca and tho renmintlor to Wasliingtoii Sound. Tho shore line and geograpliiortl positions needed wore furnished by Assistant Gilbert ;LShis work progressed. Tho party of Lieutcuaiit Flyniie collectcd much valuable information in relation to the liarbors, channels, and daiigors of this part of tlie coast, which will be utilized in tho proparation of charts and in tho Coast Pilot publications of the Coast aiid Geodetic Survey. Tho Gedney arrived on tho morlriug ground May 10, 1894, and worked continuously until October 18, wlien, Assistaiit Gilbert's work beirig also completed, she proceeded to Port Townsond, and thence to Seattle, wliero cortain necessary repairs were made.

The list of naval officers attached to tho hydrographic party of tho steamer Gedney is as follows : Lieut. Lucian Flynne, commanding officer; Lieut. L. J. Clark; F. C . Schubert, pay yeoman and draftsman; A. 3`. Berryhill, apothecary aud observer; P. N. Christianson, observer; and A. E. Brisman, recorder. f the survey o f Washingtoib Sound, Washington, triangulation and topography.Continuation o In accordanco with instructions of May 14, 1894, Assistant J. J. Gilbert had taken the field prior to the closo of the last fiscal year, and the steamer Gedney, under command of Lieut. Lucian Flynne, mas placed a t his disposal. Lieutenant Flynne was directed to furnish every facility for the prosecution of the work of Mr. Gilbert, and, as opportunity offered, to execute tlio hydrography. Assistant Gilbert joined the Gedney a t Port Townsend on the 18th of May, and as soon as tho necessary supplies were obtained the vessel proceeded to Friday Harbor. The erection of sigiials was a t oiico begun, and, during tho remainder of May, 65 were completed along and near tho sliores of Haro Strait. Triangulation observations were begun June 1 and completed July 27, during which time the triangulation was extended through Hnro Strait, President Channel, Middle Channel, Harney Channel, and West Sound, including Deer Harbor, Mosquito Pass, Rook Harbor, aucl Westcott Bay. The balance of July mas occupied i n making projections for tlio to1)ogr:Lphic sheets. The topography mas begun August 1and closed October 17, during which interval t h e e sheets were completed. Owiug to the requirements of tho hydrography, the triangulation xas extended far beyond the limits hecessary for the season's topography, and by working every night Assistant Gilbert was able to keep up the computations and furnish geographical positions to tho hydrographic party without m y delay to either class of field work.

Deterinination o f relative gravity w i t h half-second pendulums in Colorticlo, Wyoming, and 1Ttuh.Gravity determiiiations with the new h:ilf-second pendulums were made a t various stations iii these States and Territories by the party under thecharge of Assistant G. R. Putnam during the months of July, August, and September, 1894. Tho stations in Colorado mere located a t Denver, Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak, GuIinison, atid Grand Junction j thosc in Wyoiuiug a t Grand Canyon, Korris Geyser Basin, :~ndLower Geyser Basin (all i i i tlic Yellomstone Park) ; arid those in Utah a t Salt Lako City, Green River, and Pleasarit Valley Junction. Thesu stations form part of the tr~nscoiitiiientalseries already iiieiitioned and described i n thc geiieral account of the season's gravity work under the liead of "The Eastorn Division." For furtlier particulars, see pages 28 et seq. of this volume, and Assistant Putnam's paper, published ;is Appendix No. I, i n Pitrt I1 of tlie Report of tlic Superintendelit of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal ycar 1894. It may liere be mentioned that tlic localities of the stations at Pikes Peak arid Colortido Springs weIe selected with ,z view to obtaining, incidentally, data for the determination of tlie mean deusity of the earth. The observatious have been computed by Mr. Putnam, and givo 5.63 as the value of tlie earth's mean density. Laying out a ineridian line a t Colorado Springs, Co1o.-In August, 1894, Assistant G . It. Patiiain, while occupying tho station a t Colorado Springs for tlie determination of gritvity, laid out, a t the request of Prof. F. H. Loud, a truo meridian line, for the uso of local surveyors i r i testing their compass necdlcs and determining the magnetic declination. Geodetic soor~.-Contiitzcation o f the transeontiriental triangulation in Cohr`ado.-At tlic close of the last fiscal year tho party under the cliargo of Assistant yTilliam Eimbeclr had completed the reconnaissance eastward from Mount Ouray and mas engaged in transporting camp and outfit up that mountaiii and making the preliriiiiiary arrarigenients for its occupation. Mount Ouray is one of the main stations of tlie great trauscontiiiental triangulation, is located 011 the :/xis1 liiie of tho Continental Divide, and rises to an altitude of 14 100 fcot. Tlic work a t this statio11 comprised all thc ClitsseS of geodetic, astronomical, and magnetic observatious usually mado a t primary points in tho mountain region, and these observations, particularly those for liorizontal

directions, were extended over a sufficient interval of time to include varied meteorological conditions, and thus secure results reasonably free from the vitiating effccts of atmospheric refraction. Eight primary and many secondary points were observed upon for horizontal directions, heliotropes being used on all the primary lines, and zenith distances for the determilietion of relative clevatioiis mere also observed on both primary and secondary points. The astronomical work consisted of tiine, latitude, and azimuth determinations, and the niagiietic work of the usual observations for declinatign, dip and intensity. The occupatiou of the statiou was completed early in August, after mliich a short base mas measured a t the lower camp by means of a stcel tape, and a local triangulation w:is executed to connect the railroad station :it Marshall Pass, and d1fYerences of elevation were carried through the scheme by meaiis of zenith distance measures. A bench mark mas established a t fars shall Pass, so that the spirit-lcveling work of the survey may ultiniately connect with the points determined trigonometrically. A similar trigouometrical connectiou, for the sauie purpose, was effected the precediiig spriiig a t Grand Junction. \.T'hile tho occupation of Mouut Ouray was in progress, tliree cooperating parties, under Mr. 13imbeclr's general direction, sirnultancously occupied tho stations a t Mount Elbert, 13isoii Peak, and P1:iteau.

The party being still in the field, the results of the season's work mill appear in tlie next annual report. Geodetic work.-Continuation o f the transcontinental triangulation in Colorado.-At the beginning of the fiscal year Assistant F. n. Granger was assigned to duty on tho transcontinental triangulation in Colorado, and proceeded to Pueblo early i n July and orgaiiized ;t 13iWty for the occupation of Plateau, n station in tho main scheme previously selected by Assistaut M'illiam Eimbeclr, and located about 0 miles to the northeast of Pueblo. The sfation was prepared and in readiness for observations by the 18th of July, b u t owing to unfavorable weather conditioiis they were not begun until the 22d. Three primary and twenty tertiary objects, inostly Inountain peaks, mere liere observed for horizontal directions, and double zenith distances of all the priin:wy :uid iiiost of the tertiary points were also deterinined. The three priinarics observed were Pikes l'ealc, Mount Ouray, and Mount Bison, and a fourth-Cramers Gulch-was also desired, but tlie line to it was found impracticable on account of high intervening ridges. Observations a t Plateau were completed by August 14, and the station +as then carefully marked and described, and .z turgettripod sigiial was then erected over it. Preparations mero then made for the transfer of the party and outfit to Big Springs, but the nonarrival of fimds caused a delay until the 20tli, wlien tdegraphic orders were received to close field operations and disb:uicl party, tlie baltruce of appropriation reniaining not being sufficient fos the occupation of another station. The c:mp outfit, instruments, etc., mere moved to Pueblo and stored by the 27tl1, when the party was disbauded, and Aasistaii t Granger returned to Washington, accompanied by his recorder, C. IC. Knight, who rendered valuable service during the season. Assistant Granger, after cornputing the rosuIts of his field work, was assigiietl to duty iii the offico until May 16, 1805, when ho \vas directed to prepare for the resumptioii of field work on the transcontinental triangulation early in June. Leaving the East on Julie 2 lie arrived a t Pueblo on tlie 5th, and by the 14th tlie party was organized and en route to Big Springs, distant from Pueblo by wagon road about 60 miles. The station w m prepared for observations, heliotropes being posted a t Plateau, Pikes Peak, and Divide, and the work was fairly under may before the close of the fiscal year. A reconnaissance was also made for the location of R secondary station between Big Springs and Plateau, the line from tlie latter to Craiiiers Gulch having proved impracticable, and the point Dry Camp was selected. The observations at Big Springs mill determine the horizontal directions aud the elevations of four primary, one secondary, and a number of tertiary points, and the usual deterininations of magnetic declination will be made. The primary stations are Crairiers Gulch, l'lateau, l'ilres Peak, and Divide, arid the secondary station is the newly selected ouo a t Dry Camp. Nr. J. B. Boi~telle, a computer in tliu office, was detailed t o act as recorder and to assist iii the observatioiis, and Mr. E. E. Torrey was assigned to the party as foreman; slid Assistant Granger, in his report, highly commends both for their efficient services rendered in the prosecution of the work. Mr. Granger's report for the fiscal year is accompanied by a sketch sliowing the relative positions and distances of the primary and secondary points, the distances observed ranging from 20 to 90 miles.

northeastern portion of tlie great figure which has Pikes Peak for its central point, tho Continental Divido for its western limit, and includes to the eastward points in the scheme crossing the Colorado l'lains, was assigned to Assistant F. W. Perkins, who took the field about tho middle of June, 1894. Tho king peaks of the Saguache Range, Mount Ouray and Mount Elbert, had already been selected, Pikes Peak mas known to be visible from both of them, and tho valley of tho Arkansas River makes an opening between the Arkansas Hills and the Wet Mountains, through which, from Mount Ouray, the plains had been seen past the northern elid of the Sangro de Cliristo ltange. On tho north over a hundred miles of unpromising country lay between 66Mount Elbert" nnd the northernmost plains station "Divide," and tlie Park Range, the Puma IIills, tlie Tnrryall Mountains, and the Rampart Rango crossing the line between these two points, it was feared t,liat it might bo impracticable, and that recourse mould be necessary either to two cxtra intermediate stations, or to Mount Evens, 30 miles to the north, and known to bo very diflicult of access, especially to a party laden with instruments and camp outfit. To reconnoiter this coun.try, settle questions of in tervisibility, and prqject the most practicable schelno of connection, mas the first duty of Mr. Perkins, after which ho was to make tho necessary observations a t as inany of the selected stations as time and available funds mould permit. Assistant Perkins reached Denver on tho 11th of June, and immediately began preparations for tho reconnaissance. Pikes Peak and Divide Station mere first visited, aud it was soon deinonstrated that tho lirio from tho latter to Mount Elbert mas impracticable owing to the p e a t height of the intervening Rainpart Rango. A littlo to tho uorthward of the line, howover, a peak was visible which W;LB identified as Bison, the highest peak of t h e Tarryall Mountains. This peak was reached after considerable difficulty, aiid from it Pikes Peak, Mount Evans, Mount Ouriy, the Divide of the Arkansas and Platte, and Mount Elbert, wore fouud to be visible, tho latter just showing through a depression in tho intcrveniug Mosquito Range. Bisou mas therefore suitable for tlio connecting station, aud further reconnaissance being unnecessary, Mr. Perkins returned to Pikes Peak to crect R sigrial and post a heliotrope, leaving his recorder, Frederick L. Olmsted, to cnt the trail and preparo Bison Station for occupation. This v a s acconiplished in due time, and observations were beguri a t Bison on the 15th of July, heliotrope signals lisvi~ig first been exchanged with all tho stations to be obsorved, except Mount Elbert. The observations mero completed early in August, in spite of very unfavorable weather coiiditions. ltaiii, hail, or snow fell nearly every afternoon, and coiisequcntly a I i ~ g o part of tlie observations woro taken in the morning hours, but a sufficient number of aftcruoon mcasuromciits wero obtained to verify tho results. Mr. Olmstead was theu sent to propare the Pilres Peak Station, but owing to tho nonarrival of funds themain party mas delayed a t Bison until August 23, mtl additional observations were mado meanwhiIe. A t that date iristructions were received to closc field operations and disband party, as tho remaining funds would uot suffice for tlio occupation of another station. The nioviiig OS the party from the mountains, the collecting and storing tho outfit and iustrnments, and final disbanding of party mere accomplished by tho B t h , aud Assistant Perkius returned to Washington.

Assistant Perkins has submitted a very full report concerning tho country traversed by him in the reconnaissance and on his geodetic work. Tho report is also accompanied by a sketch showing the relative positions and distances of tho innin points of the scheiiie. The distances observed in the triangulation this season range from 3 G to 70 miles. His subsequent services on tho oblique arc in Alabama have been ineritioned elsewhere in this report. Contisiuntion of tlie traasconti~ientaltria.nplation in the zicinity qf tlie thirty-ninth pura,!!el, in CoEorado.-At the beginning of tlie fiscal year the party uuder the charge of Assistarit 1'. A . Welker 1i:ul reached the summit of Mouiit Elbert., a high peak of Lakc Ooiuity, Colo.,.arid m a s nearly ready to begin observations. Mount Elbert is located 011 the Continental Ilivide, ant1 has ai1 :dtitude of about 14 43G feet, and is therefore the highest poilit ever occupied as a tri;uigulation station. It is, moreover, one of the most difficult of' access, and the difliculties encountered in making the ascent, establishing camp, and preparing the station were very great. Tho preliminary preparations mere completcd by July 8, and the observations mere bcgnn the following day. Owing to tho peculiar weather conditions, the majority of thc observatioiis were mado during the morning hours, tliero being rarely an opportniiit,y for obtaining them in tlie afteriioon 011 account of mind, snow, and thunder storms. Regarding the ;ibnorinal atiiiosphcric conditions which prevailed during the occupancy of the station, 31r. Welkcr reports as follows :

The damaged instrument was repaired as well as possiblo with tIie limited tools and f`acilitics available, and the observations completed, after which i t was returned to Wbsliington for thorough repair. Althougli tlie electric storms mere unusually violent mid continuous this Se:1son7 it is an establislied Pact that on the higher mountains they are :dways severe during the liiol~ths of July and August, and the occupation of the summit slioultl, a.s fiir as possible, bo avoided diiiiiig tliese months. Unfortunately the season when observations are practicnblc in these high alt,itudes is at best short, but September and October are usually very favorable. All observations for ho~~izontal directions were referred t o a iiiark located 011 a sharp peak a t a distance of about 24 miles from t.ho station: The observations mere made in 1 G positions of tlic theodolite circle, one observation with telcscopo erect, and oiic with telescope reversed being considered a scrics. The series in each position were noccssarily inucli brolreii on accouut of all the objects not &owing a t the same time, but theso mere eventnslly a11 observed. The work a t the station consisted of observations for horizontal directions, vertica.1measures, and magnetic declination. For the horizontal .. . . . and . vertical observations heliotropes were stationed at five main'points of, tlk tr!a!iguiation, ficheme, viz, a t Ouray, Uncoxnpahgrs, Treasury, Bison, and Pikes Peak, and tho same heliotropes were utilized for showing to the observers of the otlier parties simultaneously employed on tlie transcontinental geodetic work. Observa,tions mere also macle upon -26 secondary peaks, and five promincnt objects at Leadvillo and Twin Laltes were determined.

Hydrographic and general surveys iir Alaska.-The steamer Puttereon, under the command of Lieut. Commander W. I. Moore, a t the beginning of the fiscal year was engaged in the survey of Chatham Straits, Alaska, having previously landed tho parties of Assistants I)iclrens, Morse, aud McGrath a t their respective stations a t the head of Behm Canal, Sitka, and Yalrutnt Ray. Sho reached her working ground and h g a n work on May 27. The work assigned for the season included the survey of Chatliani Straits from Point Augusta to Point Samuel, the most end of Ecnasnow Island and Freshwater I h y , Tenaltee Inlet (Siwash Passage), and the north end of lloods Bay, including Rillisiioo IIsrbor. Tlic triaiigolation, shore line, sild hydrography mere completed to Point Saninel, witli the exception of Kootsnahoo Inlet, but p r t of the sltetchiiig of the topography was left unfinisliecl, owing to the interruption of the work caused by the necossity of transporting the aiviliau parties engaged on the Alaskan Boundary Survey. A base line of 1 0504 metres vas measured on tlie iiortli shore of Teiinlree Illlct, 2nd tlic trimgulation I T ~ S carried nortlimard from it to connect witli Lieutenant Commander AI:t~~sfielcl'~ work of 1890, and southward to Point, Samuel.

Tho resumption of work by tho steamer Putterson, in tho Rpring of 1895, will be mentioned in the next paragraph. fhumption of hydrographic and general surueys i ?Alaska ~ iib the SprhLg (f1895.-Tho steamer Futtersoia, nuder tlie coininnrid of Lieut. Conimandcr E: I<. Noore, was agaiu fitted out in tho spring of 1805 for tho continuation of tho hydrographic and general surveys i n Alaska, and sailed from Sari Francisco on tho 11th of April, touching a t ScattIo and Tacoma on the wag. By directiou of tho Superintendent elic was required to furnish trausportntion to tiio various civilian parties of the survey, to bo engaged on the Alaskan Boundary Survey, to their respective fields of work, and Assistants E. F. Diclrius and Prcmont Morso, with two meu and tho outfit and stores for four field parties, accordingly joined the stosmer a t San Francisco,'and Assistant P. A. Welker Aids 0. 13. Freiicli awl C. C. Yatcs, and oxtra observcrs ET. A. Grady n11d R. TJ. Livingston, with eight men and the rerriadning p;wty cquipnicnts, wero taken on board a t Soattlo. Assistant Morse vas lauded :it Seattle, that being tho base station for tho dotcriuinatioii of Alaskan chronometric longitudes, axid tho other parties wore landed a t Port Simpson, tlio head of Portlarid Carla1 and Mary's Islancl, rCRpCCtiVC1y. Tlio schoouer Earn&, laden with coal for the seasou's consumption, was taken in tow a t Tacoxna aud left a t Port Simpsou in tolnporary clinrgo of tho civilian parties, atid the steam launch Fuca was delivercd a t the head of Portland Canal to Assistant P. A. Welker for tho irso of ]lis party iu tho chronoinotric longitude work. The I'uttcrso?L thou proceeded to lier owii morlcing ground, stopping on tho way at Wrangell Narrows to locato an uiichnrted shoal reported by tho City o f Topeka, a t Killisnoo to hiid signal luniber, and a t Sitka to taka on board tho boats arid oquiprnents stored a t tho close of the previous SC:~SOII. Tllo rogulnr field work of tho season mas begun May 13 iu Chatliam Straits at the point reached last :mtumn, and a t tho close of the fiscal year tho party had niado good progress. A tido gauge Was established on tho cast face of tlie `(Alaska Oil and Guauo Company's" wharf a t Killisnoo, and a beso line 700 metres in leugth mas measured a t tho inoutli of IIootz or Hood Bay; this base, the lougest that could be obtained in tho locality, was connected with the triaugulatioii of tho Previous season, maliing a satisfactory junction, a i d froiii it tlio triniigulntion was esteuded in to Qootznahoo or Hootznahoo Inlot a d across Chatham Strnits iuto Peril Strait as f`nr as Bro;id Islaud. The hydrography has boen marly corupletcd withiu the eimo limits, but iu certain localities 8ome further developmerit may bo iiecessary; :bud the sketching of tlic topography Iias been carricd h ~ lChathaul l Strait on tho west 8ido as far as tho north sidu of l'eril Strait, and on the cast sido t o nangor Point, includiiig Rootznahoo Iulet.

An astronomical station was also established a t Eillisnoo, the longitude being obtained by chronomotric exchanges with the Alaska Boundary Survey parties and the latitudo by direct observation. On June 25 the vessel moved to Pogibshi Anchorago, north of Pogibslii Point, a t the west end of Peril Strait, and hero a tide gaugo was erected and sitos selected for an observatory aiid an additional beso line. The north end of Peril Strait is a wide sheet of navigable mater, deep to tho shore line, but containing maiiy outlying islands, rocks, and sunken reofs; tlie sliores aro abrupt, slid tho surrounding hills, like thoso in nearly all parts of southeastern Alaska, are high, riigged, and covered to a height of about 2 000 feot with a dense growth of timber. This region is within the limits of the fishing and hunting grounds of thc Sitka Indians, and they are frequently inet with in their canoes and temporary camps. Fish aro plentiful, both in tho straits and iu tho mountain streams, but gaine is becorning comparatively scarce, although some doer, bear, and grouse aro still found. Vegetation is rank aloiig tlie beach arid in places reached by thc rays of the sun, and blueberries, salmon berrios, and wild flowers are abundant. Mom than tliirty vwioties of the l a t k r \vere collected witliin an area of tliree or four acrcs a t Pogibshi Point; among them, sweet peas, violets, columbines, fIags, water lilies, and others known to marmer climates and more southern latitudes. T l ~ weather c during the season was favorable for tho oxecution of triangulation and liydrography, but the topography and astronomical work mere somowhat delayed by drizzling rains, lowhanging clouds, and fogs. the latter concoaling tho hill and mountain tops, but not interfering with sights on the lower levels.

Assistant Ogden's sorvices during the reni;iincler of tlic fiscal ye:^ have already been xwntioned. .Establishment o f the Nural Observatory circle.-A joint resolution of Congress, approved August 1, 1894,provided for the establishment of a circle around the United States Naval Observatory, and required the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey to malrc tlie nocessary surveys. According to tlie provisioris of t h e act, certain tracts of land were to be acquired by 1)urcliase, and others, already a part of tlie Observatory site, mere to be sold in order to transform tho present irregular-shaped Governmeut property iuto a circlo h:wing a mclius of 1 000 feet. On September 5, Assistant E. 11. Preston was directed to report t o tho Commissioners appointed by the Secretary of tlie Navy :tiid to procced with the work of defining tlio circle. This work was succcssfully accomplished by October 1. It mas then found necessary to mako a resurvey of the original plat because aomo of the old points could not bo recovered. This resurvey was completed by October 6, and a11 t'lie results, including 8 map, were turned over to tho commissioiiers on October 13. Mr. Preston was assisted in the field work by hlessrs. J. B. Boutello and C. C. Yates, and in the computations by Messrs P. D. Granger, H. F. Flyrin, and R. A. T3;wris.

running about north-northwest and south-southeast; these are also considered as a part of the Fox Island group. The owner of these islauds being interested in oyster culture, and desiring to pursue certaiii investigations arid esperiments in developing his interests, entered into negoti a t' 1011s with the Stats authorities in order to acquire full control over a certain arcs of water suitable for his purpose. The result mas an act of the general assembly, approved by the governor February 2G, 1894, entitled "An act to define and establish by straight lines the low-water mark lilies for the riparian owner of tlie shores of Fox Island, or Fox islands, in the county of ACCOWRC, in the State of Virgiuia." In this act is a provision that the United States Coast and Geodotic Survey be requested to compute the acreage of the area between high and low water inark lines, aud that tlieir computation shall be accepted as final both by tlie State authorities and the riparian owner; and consequently in the spring of 1594 the parties interested made application to Superintendent Mendenliall for tlic necessary information. The data in the archives of the Survey being insufficient Sor the purpose, it mas proposed on the part of the State and the Yiparian owner, and agreed to on t h o part of the Superintendent, that a uew and special survey be macle, the expenses of the same to be borne by the parties interested. No action could be talieri however a t that time, as the assistants of t h o Survey mere otherwise omployed, and the matter mas necessarily deferred until tliu spring of 1895, when the present Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, with tho approval of the honorable Secretary of the Treasury, directed Assistant W. C. 1-loclgkiiis to proceed with the work. Tidal observations for the detormination of the plan0 of iiiean low water mere begun March 27, and tlie topographic aud hydrographic survey early in >lay. Sonic triangulation WLS necessary, as tho old points of the former survey liad mostly disappeared, and a base liiic, 1319 metres in length, mas measured by means of a steel tape on Great Fox Is1:uicl. Tho topography and Iiydrography followed in order, and were completed by May 25. The tide gnugo was kept runiiing, mider tho charge of Mr. R. W. Maupin, until the close of the work, so that with tlie esception of a few tides, lost through accidental causes, me have ;I three nion ths' continuous series of observations. Tho oiily specially notable feature developed in this survey is the great arnoiint of erosion that has taken place alorig all parts of tlie shores of these islands since tho former survey was maclo. Tho total loss since 1851 is estimated by Assistant Ilodgkiiis as 36 per cent of the existing area, a ratio of mew that seems to indicate that, tlie Pox islands mill, boforo iiiaiiy years, disappear entirely. The wear is most marked, of course, 011 the western or Tangier side, the estensivo shoals on the Poeomoke side materially reducing the efect of storni waves. On the cornplotion of the survey, Assistant Hodgliiiis returned to Washington, and mas engaged on his ofice work until assigned to duty on tho Hudson River Survey, as already iucntioned on a previous page.

20,1895, and during that time seven elaborate oyster charts have been prepared and printed in colors, and two reports containing 106 pages of printed matter, giving angles, distances, etc., as

determined trigonometrically from marked shore stations, have been published. The statistics as given by Assistant Baylor are as follows: In Accomac County (ocean side) 69 natural oyster rocks mere Rurveyed, embracing an area of 14 242.2 acres. In Northampton County (ocean side) 4!) natural oyster rocks, embracing an area of 30 349.3 acres, mere surveyed. Six hundred and eighty five corners of natur:d oyster rocks mcre determined by angular measures from shore stations. The printed reports referred to contain, in addition to the distances and be:wings of the corners from the shore statious, the depths of water, tidal information, descriptions of stations, and fnll directions to the civil engineer and others for finding any desired corner. The method of conducting the work and making the determinations is also described. AI1 expenses of this work throughout its continuance, excepting the s:Llary of tho chief of party, have been paid by tlie State of Virginia, but during the last season the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries placed the steam 1:iuncll Petrel and her crew a t Mr. Baylor's disposal while engaged on the field work. On the completion of the survey Mr. Baylor was directxcl to make magnetic observations a t various points along the Atlantic coast. This work will be noticed in another part of this report. Mobile B a y and vicinity; surcey of oyster grounds f o r the United States Cowmissioner o f Fiinh and Fisheries.-As mentioned in tlie report for 1894, Mr. llonier 1'. Ritter, :it the request of the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, and by direction of the Superintendent of the United States Uoast and Geodetic Survey, made a survey of the oyster beds of Mobile Bay and vicinity during tho months of February and March of that year. The observed water deusities, however, proved unsatisfactory, owing to the fact that during the whole time the survey mas in progress extensive freshets prevailed in t!ie streams tributary to Mobile Bay, and the waters of Mobile Bay antl Mississippi Sound were consequently much less saline than under normal conditions. The Commissioner of Fish and Figheries therefore requested that Mr. Ritter, on his return from Alaska, where he had meanwhile been assigned t o duty in connection with the International Boundary Survey, be again detailed to supplement the first survey mid to redetermine the water densities. Mr. ltitter accordingly proceeded to Mobile Bay in the latter part of November, 1894, chitrtered a small oyster schooner, aiid begaii morlc December 1. Temperature and density observations were repeated throughout the oyster area, aiid additional angles and sounding mere measured, and some additional specimens mere collected. The work was completcd by December 8, and Mr. Ritter then returned to Washington. IIe has submitted a full report on t h e surveys, and a map embodying their results, copies of which have been furnished to the Commissioner of Fish antl Fisheries. ltesurvey of tlie international boieiadary line betioeen the United States and Nexieo.-From July 1, 1894, to J:muary 5, 1895, Assistant A. T. Mosrnan continued on duty as member of the International Boundary Commission, with licsdquarters a t Sari Diego, Cal., the time until October 1 1 being occupied in completing the field maps of the northern side of the boundary. On October 1 1the Joint Commission adjourned to meet in Washington, D. C., one year from that date, and all records aiid maps pertaining to the United States section were sent to the State Department early in November. Mr. Mosman was instructed by the honorable Becretary of State to report to the Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey on January 5,1895, for duty under his direction until October 1,when his services mill again be required on the Boundary Commission. Mr. Mosman was assigned by the Superintendent to duty in the computing division, and fierved until June 4, when he was directed to assume temporary charge of the drawiug division. On June 30 he proceeded to New Orleans, La., to assume charge of the telegraphic longitude party operating in that section of the country.

of tho longitude work a t Seattle and Tacoma, Wash,, near the close of the previous fiscal year, Assistant 0.El. Sinclair proceeded to San Francisco and made preparations Sor tlie resumption of n.ork 0x1 the California and Xevada boundary lino, intending to tako the field on tho 1st of July, arid meanwliile Assistant Walter 13. Fairfield mas ongaged in selecting and purcliasing the necessary live stock aiid outfit arid transporting them to Carson City, Xev. Owing to tho great railway striko inaugurated J u n e 28, Mr. Sinclair was unablo to leave San Francisco until July 27, causing a vexatious delay aiid a loss of nearly a nioiith of the most favorable time for field work. The instruments sexit from Washington for the use of the party were delayed for tho same reason and did not arrive a t Carson City until tho latter part of July. The party was organized at Carson City, and on July 20 reached tho southeast end of Lnko Tahoe, where an aziinutli mas determined in ord& to begin tho ranging out of tho oblique boundary. Mr. Sinclair took personal charge of tho ranging out of tho line, and detailed Assistant W. 13. Fairfield to take clinrge of tho triangulation, topographical sketching, and niaguetic observations. The point selected for tho azimuth was 805.16 metres due north of the longitude pier of 1893, being tho computed popition of tlie intorsection of tlie meridian of that station with tlie oblique boundary near its nortlieast elid. Froin the azimuth station a point was fixed 460.5 metres nortlimest, near the sboro of Lake Talioe, and called "Initial, 1894.'' The azimuth station itself is designated as "TI,"and successivo points along the line as Tz," ((T3," T,," otc. For the first being only 4 miles distant from "Initial," but from part of tlio lino tho sights mero short, ``TI7' ` " I ! , "a number of points in the Carson Valley were located, the farthost om being L`T22,77 ou tho summit of tlie Antelope Range, a distanco of 16.4 miles. Then the tlieodolito mas taken back to as that point had groater elevation, and points located to tcT32,7' on the east slopc o f tlio `LMiddle Sister," in tho Sweatwater Mountains. To tliis point was a clear eight of 43.8 miles, the longest sight in ranging out a boiuidary line of which we havo any record, but i t mas greatly to the White Mountains, 8 distalice of 68.8 miles. This exceeded by tliu following one from "Tnz" great sight mas made with tlic aid of a small pocket Steiiiheil heliotrope with a mirror only 1 by la inches, and tho signals mero clearly interpreted a t tliat distance. This point is "TGn," aud is the southeast limit of tho ranging-out work of the season, a total distance of 116.2 miles from "Initial." Points mero located on the suminit of all important ridges 011 tlie line and a t the crossing of tho Carson arid Colorado Narrow Gauge Railroad, and, as mill be seen from the number of poiiits estnblishecl in tlio given distance, the averago distance apart of tho points to be permaiiontly marked is less than 2 milos. Tho points wero ternporarily marked by a drill hole in tho rock, in which were set polos surrounded by piles of stones. As tlie ranging-out work progressed more rapidly than the triangulation, and as i t was desirable to keep tho two classes of w0i.k together, Assistant Sinclair from timo to time suspeuded the rangiiig-out oporations and assisted the other brancli of tlio party. The triangulation was carried along over the high mountains just south of LnkeTahoo, thence across tho Carson Valley and over tho Antelope Range, thence across the Antelope Valley aud over tho Sweetwater Mountains, mid finally to tho suminit of tho White Mountains, a total distaiico of 1 1 G miles, and heiice bringing tho triangulation to the limit reached by tho rangingout palsty. The base for this triangulation as derived from tlio priinary triangulation of tlie Coast and Geodetic Survoy, which in crossing tho continent passes near Lako Tahoe. The sidos of the triangles are from 2 to ti miles in length, and the angles were ineasured for tho most part with a 6-iuch repeating theodolite. For son10 aiigles, homover, a 10-inch instrument was used. In the courso of tlio work a number of the old boundary posts, located by Von Schmidt in 1873, mere found, and in all cases thoso were carefully determined by the triangulation party. During the progress of the work the magnetic declination was determined a t a11 points on the line, and observations for hoight were mado at all lino points and a t most of the trigonometrical points. The topography was also sketched throughout the line for a distanco of half a milo on each side. Both sectioIis Of the party mere ablo to subsist on tho country a t tho various ranches and small hotcls, and and grain for tho animals could generally bo procured in tho immediato neighborhood of the worlr; but over one section of tlie line a desert 30 miles in extent had to bo traversed, and liero somo difficulty was oncountered on account of the total absence of mater. The teams of the party had, tlicrefore, to be employed a part of the time i n carrying water from a

distance for the use of the men and animals. The whole party consisted of eloven man and the two otticers named, with two four-mulo teams, ono thorough-brace wagon drawn by a pair of mules, and thirteen saddle and pack animals. On the completion of the triaugulation, November 10, the mliolo party returned to Carson City, reaching that point November 16, whero tho instruments, wagon, and outfit were stored, aud the anilrials quartered for the winter. While this was being done, magnetic observations wero made a t Carson City and a t Lake Tahoe. Tho magnetic station a t Carson City was located in the grounds of the Pardion arid in the meridian of the transit of Mr. C. W. Friend's observatory (one squ:tro south of it). The station was marked so that it can be recovered when iieccssary in the Suture. The station a t Lake Tahoe yas located 25 metres due south of tho longitude pier of 1893, ucar the Lakeside Tavcrn, a t the southeast end of tho lake. Maguetic bearings of the lines of the triangulation were also observed during the progress of the work with a cornpass declinometer. On tho completion of the magnetic observations, and the storing of the preporty, Messrs. Siticlair arid Fairfield, in accordance with instructions, returned to San Francisco, and aftor couference with Assistant George Davidson, mho was charged with a geiiaral supervision of matters connected with the boundary survey, and settling up of party accounts, proceeded to Washington. The oflice work and computations pertaining to the field work mere then taken up and continued until interrupted by the assignment of Messrs. Sinclair an& Fairfield to other fiold duty; tho former, 011 February 1,1805, to telegraphic longitude work in tho Southwest, and the latter, on May 16, to tho California and Wevnda boundary work. The statistics, on account of the noncompletion of' the ofico work, are incomplete, but may be given in part as follows:

An account of Assistant Sinclair's longitude work in California, Nuw Mexico, ;md Texas, and also of his and Assistant Fairfield's subsequent work on the Oalifornia and Nevada boundary liue, will appear under the appropriate headings elsewhero in this report. Recrumption of the resurvey of the oblique boundary line bettoeen the States o f California and Nevada in the spring of l8X.-On May 15, 1895, Assistatit C. II. Sinclair was directed to make preparations for tho resumption of the resurvey of tho oblique boundary line between t h e States of California and Nevada, from the point reached in tho previous season, and Assistant W. B. Fairfield mas again assigned to his party. Assistant A. L. Baldwin was also assigned to tho party. Messrs. Sinclair, Pairfield, and Baldwin left Washington on May 22 for San Francisco, where tho find preparation8 were completed by June 3. The party then proceeded to Carson City, Nev., and from this point to the field of operations, a distance of over 150 miles, it, was tiecessnry to drive, there boing no raiImay transportation. This drive was accomplished i u five days, arid work was commenced on the 14th of June a t line station 6`T59,7' where the Carson and Colorado nailroad crosses the boundary line. Here an azimuth was observed and a check base 1080 metres in length mas laid out and twice measured with a steel tape. The base mas measured along the rails of the railroad, and was subsequently connected with the triangulation in tho usual manlier. Mr. Sinclair again took chargo of the ranging out of the line, and Mr. Fairfield of the triangnlation, topographic sketching, and magnetic observation a. TO Mr. Baldwin mas assigned tho charge of the forvard subdivision of the ranging party. Tho ranging out began a t `LTco,,)tho Routhernmost point reached during the former season, on tho summit of tho White Mountains, and a t an elevation of uearly 14 000 feet above sea level. This station is very difflcult of access, and

the climbing arduous and in places dangerous. A start mas made for tho summit on Juno 17, and Mr. Sixiclair's section of the party camped for the night a t the highost point wliere water is to be found. Tho ascent was continued the next morning, but it was soon necessary t o leave tho animals and continuo without them, and aftor five hours of sovere exertion the summit was reached. It mas then necessary to shovel away the snow in ordor to see forward to the next station, 12 miles to the soutlieast. This latter point, which overlooks tho Fish Lake Valley arid commands the country for 30 or 40 miles, was next occupied. Line points are being located every fom miles across this valley, and on all the coiispicuous ridges, as far as the topography of the country will permit. Assistant Fairfield has connected the base line above referred to with tho triangulation, and is now carrying tlie latter across tho southeast slopes of the White Mountains, a very difficult and troublesome region to traverse with a sinal1 scheme of triangulation. The work will probably proceed this season with greater rapidity than last, as the employment of two additional men will much facilitate the oxecutiou of tho r e c ~ n i i a i ~ ~ and a n ~the e eroctiori of signals. Mr. Siuclair, in his report, ;iclrnowledges in complimentary terms tho hearty cooperation of Assistarits Fairfield and 13nldmiii in every pliaso of tlio work, and the commendablo zeal displayed by every rnombor of tho party. A t tho closo of the fiscal year tho party was still in the field, and tho statistics of the work mill tliereforc appear in the next annual roport. Specitrl topogra]ihic and hydrogrcipliic survcp of the vicinity of the Port Orchard d r y dock, Waslvi?zgton,for the iise of the N a v y Depcrrtinent.-The horiorablo Secretary of the Navy h;Lviiig mado requisition on tlie Coast mid Geodetic Survoy for a large scale detailed topographic and hydrographic survey of the viciiiity of the Port Orchard dry dock, Puget Sound, Washington, Assistant J. J. Gilbert m a s a t once detailed to execute tho work. Mr. Gilbert left Olympia on tho 23d of April, arriving a t Port Orchard on the following day, and inimodiately began oporatioiis. Hands for his party wero a t first supplied by the iiaval oficor in charge of the dry dock, but subsequently a crew mas detailed from the steamer Hassler. The shoro liiio mas traced aiid tho topographic details delineated by means of tho plano table, on a scalo of 1 1 000, arid tho elevation contours for successivo intervals of 3 feot wore accurately located by actual spirit leveling. The hydrography mas closely survoyed to a depth of 6 fatlionis, tlio sounding lines being run a t intervals never exceeding 60 feet. The survoy was completed by May 20, and tho fiuished s h o t mas a few days later fornarded to the Coast and Goodetic Survey Office, wliere a certified copy was made for the use of tho Navy Department. Assistant Gilbert, on the completion of the work, returned to Olympia aiid resumed tho computation of his triangulation of 1594. A t t h o close of tho fiscal year ho was engaged in making preparations for tho resumption of fiold work in Wasliington Sound. Almlca boundary zcorlc.-CChro1Loi)ictriO exchanges o f t i w e contparisoiis betzceen Sitka Observatory and Pyramid .Harbor Station, f o r the determination o f the longitude of the latter.-At tho beginning of tho fiscal year Assistant Fromont Morso way engaged in making time observations a t Sitka in connection with cliroiio~notriclongitude doterminations for the Alaska Boundary Survey. Chronometers were carried in tho usual manuer by tho steamer Hussler between Sitka and the ilstronomical stntiori a t l'yrnmid Harbor iiear the liead of Lynn Canal. The chronometors mere in chargo of Mr. James Page, a member of A h . Morso's party, and wore intercompared daily, and on the arrival of the steamer a t eitlior station they were compared by two observers with the station chronometers. Time observations wore made on overy cloar night in ordor to doterniine accurately tlio chrouometer rates. Longitudes were also determined in tho same manner a t two of the sto:imer Patterson's stations, viz, a t Freshwater Bay and Killisnoo. l h r i n g the season the tidal observations at Sitka mere also continued until August G! a t mliich date the series begun June 27, 1803, were considered complote. Magnetic observations mere also mado a t the Sitka magnetic station. The lougitude work was finished by August 19, and Assistant Morse then returned to Sari Francisco whelm ho completed the records and coinputations pertaining to his fiold work. 1% was then engaged with Assistant lhvidson iri latitude computations and miscellaneous offlce work until the following spring, when he was rcassigned to the detormiiiation of Alaskan lougitudcs, as dreacly mentioned in another part of this roport.

Survey from the south end o f Naluspina Base to the Yahtse River, and deteriitiiiutioib of points near Lituya Bay.-The completion of the survey of this stretch of coast was described in the annuill report for 1894. Assistarit McGrath, in his report dated January 10, 1895, furnished a more detailed description of the progress and results of this survey. His topographic ]nap covers the coast from the Osar River to Icy Cape in front of the Malaspina Glacier. A large forest fills the area that is bounded by the Osar River on the east and tlie Manby on the west. The dense growth of spruce extends up to the very foot of t h e moraine that marks the gl:icier, and on its inner edge the occasiorial spasmodic advances of the glacier have recorded themselves in tlie destruction caused in the forest by such invasions. The Manby River flows through a wide plain which is thickly overgrown in tlie summer wit11 wild rye and peas. Bordering the drainage basin of tlie Manby in the east is fourid n section which is dotted with thrifty patches of woods. At a distance of about 16 kilometres from Point Manby the great glacier advances to the very edge of the sea, and for 13 kilometres a most painful and difficult course mu&, be pursued to reach thc west eiid of tlie icy Sitkagi Bluffs. Receding again from the shore line, thc face of the glacier sweeps inland to a distance of 7 kiloinetres froiii tlie shore a t the center of the Yahtse Delta, and then it curves seaward to Icy Cape, where the ice begiiis to discharge again into the ocean. The distance from the west end of' the Sitkagi Bluffs to Icy Cape is about 42 kilomctres. This section is traversed by many B r i m of the Fountain, Yahna, and Yahtse rivers. In this stretch are several lakes and patches of forest. The seacoast border of' the delta of the Yalitse was a great expanse of glacial mud a t the tirnc of nh. McGrath's visit. I n ordinary seasons the shore of this region assumes a very friendly aspect. Deiisc grass springs up everywhere, and the briglit green of this vegetation is variegated and beautified by the gay colors of countless wild flonws. Strawberries grow iu great abundance, but had not ripened a t the time of his departure, while in 1892 niany were gathered as early as July 4. The absence of gold-bearing sand was noted. The men of the party tried i t in various places without getting any pay prospect; though in one spot, near East Yahtse Base, sever,zl patches of ruby sand were found, there mas not enough of thie material to warrant anyone in taking up a claim and working it. Just to the eastward of where the glacier enters the sea a small, sandy islet was discovered. This malres a fine lee during the prevalence of eastcrly winds (the prevailing mmnier mirid), and affords the best lnriding 1)lilce between the Osm River a n d Yakategi. The dangers incident to landiiig along this beach were sadly exemplified in the loss of six men by drowning when Professor Russell's party disembarked near the mouth of the Pahtse River. Only a few miles west of the scene of this tragedy was the little harbor above referred to. The depth of water in it makes the place useless as an anchorage for anything larger than the small sloops used by seal and otter Ilunters and minor traders who go up and down this coast, but as it is almost a t the nearest point of the coast to Mount St. Elias a knowledge of it may prove of some value to future expetli. tioils which may bo planncld to attempt the ascent of the mountain from the side that Professor Russell essayed in his first trial. While awaiting the coming of the Patterson a t his camp on the Osar, Assistant McGratli made observations to check the distances and elevations of Mount 8t. Elias and Mount Logan, which had bee11determined from the Malaspina Base in 1892. he Putterson arrived on August 2, and transferred Assistant McGrrath's party to Lituya Bay, off which she arrived on August 4 . Since tlie loss of 21 officers and men of La Perouse's expedition a t the entrance of Lituya Bay, this 1:rtter has borne the reputation of being very dangerous. La Perouse, hovcver, entered it with his two vessels in 178G, and Captain nereendeeii, who piloted the Ooast Survey ~cliooner ]7u/io?t into it in 1874, has visited the bay i n a whaleship.

pouring in and out of the bay was shown by tho foaming white waters of the ebb tide, which could be noted by the Patterson marly a milo outside the rocks which marked the chanuel way. Awaiting tlie slack of the tide, Mr. McGrath's party was landed by the small boats of the Patterson, which roturned to Yakutat Bay to await the complotion of the work assigued to MY. McQrath. While in the bay it was learned that miners, with only the most oloiuentary knowledge of haudling sailing vessels, frequently pass in and out of tho bay without accident, arid Mr. NcGrstli coucludcs that tho entrance to the bay is undeservirig the torrible reputation it has. Vessels may often liavo to lie off' the mouth of tho bay to await a proper stago of the tide, ;m(i that this caii be conveniently done, if the wind is favorablo, wa8 shown by tho fact that the Patterson found ;I good anchorage fully a mile out from the shore. Lituya Bay may become important if the ~niniug industry in the Fairweather region continues to iiicrease. I n that case it must becoiiie tlio principal depot of supplies, as no other harbor can bo depended upon between Cross Sound ;iud Yalrutat Bay. Tliere is a t present no permanent Indian settlement on tho bay, though, according to legond, a flourishing village esistcd on its eastern shore before the advent of the whites in tho country, but a great wave swcpt in ose day and drowned all the inhabitants except two, aud siiice thou only liuiiting cabius have been established. There wore, however, about twenty white men living 011 the bay eiigapetl in working the (`ruby" m i d between the bay and Cape Fairweather, for the beaches i n tho vicinity produce eonsiderablo gold. 0 1 1 tho outside of the beach just west of tlio bay Mr. McGrath found a stretch suitable for measuring a base about 1 4 kilomotres in length, which he ospanded to a length of about 5.4 kilometres, and from this baso horizontal slid vertical angles were obtained on all the proiniuent peaks within sight. A solar azimuth was ~ncasuredalso, aiid a t ono station the magnetic decliuatioii was obtoiiied with tho aid of a compass declinolneter. Thore was no difliculty in determining the positions and elevations of Mount Pairweather, Moiint Lituya, Mount L a Perouse, and Mount D'AzeIet, but if tlio publishoci value of tho elevation of Mount Crillori is correct, then the pe:& is hidden from the beach about Lituys by a high mouiitaiu which is in liiro and botween it a,nd the shore. The field work mas completed August 12, and tho Pattemon arrived on tho next d:iy. Througliout tlio season Mr. McGratli was efficiently assisted by Ilr. El. W. Edxnonds, whose loyalty, energy, and ability he Iiighly commends. On tlio 34th tho party reombarked and mas ready to start southward agaiii. Port Towusend was reached on August 30, where some of the nien were discharged. Otliors continued on the? Patterson to Sari Fraiicisco, whero they arrivod on September 7. Having tliscliarged tliu U ~ C I I , completed his inveirtories, axid stored tho equipage, Mr. McGrath returned to Washiugton. Tho principal statistics for tho soason aro givcn as follows:

Triangulation and topograplh reconnaissance of Chilkat and, Taiya inlets.-Tho party under the direction of Assistant J. I?. Pratt coiitiiiued the survey of the Cliilliat and Taiya iiilets, a brief account of whlch mas given in the last annual report, until August 16 of the present year.

conditions would permit to 8 point a little beyond tho 6` ten marine league" limit. The wind blows strongly and continuously in these inlets at this season of the year, and as the shores are steep arid rocky, the landing with canoes and small boats was more or less hazardous. The Taiya is a glacial stream, navigable for sniall boats for about 6 miles abovc the inoutli, but tlie riavigatioii is diflicult and dangerous on account of the rapid and swirling current arid the strong wiiids already mentioned. The party had considerablo wading to do a t places, and in water but 2 or 3 degrees above freezing point. The valley of the Taiya is rather narrow, its bottom composed of gravel beds dividing the stream irregularly and forming numerous islands, most of which are covered with a dense and tolerably large growth of cottonwood trees. This reudered triangulation ditticult and expensive, and, therefore, for B considerable part of tho distance, direct measurement with steel tapes was resorted to. Long azimuth lines were observed to control the directions, and two bases were measured to control the distances in the triangulation between the mouth of tho llatsohin River and the head of Taiya Inlet. The topographic reconnaissance was also satisfactorily accomplished to a junction with the work of Messrs. J. A. Flemer and D. P. Ititter, and the magnetic declinatioii was observed a t one station on the Taiya River. On August 9 the party moved to Ancliorago Point and made a trigonometric connection across the peninsula between the Chilkat and Cliilkoot inlets. Work was completed by August 16, and the party, with its camp and outfit, was taken on board the Rtesmer .Ela.wler and the schooner Earnest and conveyed to Puget Sound via Sitka. Subassistant P. A. Young, Aids J. P.Hayford and A. L. Baldwin, and Recorder T. C. Taylor were attached to the party during the season and rendered acceptable service. On the arrival of the Hasslcr a t Seattle, on August 30, the instruments and outfit were stored, and the party disbanded. Mr. Pratt thcn took up thc oflico work, and Messrs. Young, Hayford, and Baldwin proceeded to mTsshington, D. C., and wero assigned to duty in the ofico. Subsequently Assistant Pratt was ordered t,o Washington for tho purpose of taking charge of the instrument division o E the Office. Ho left Seattle 011 the 28th of Deccmber, 1894, reached Washington January 7,1895, and entered on his new duties as chief of the instruinont division January 18.

Topographic reconnoissance to the northward and eastward of Taiya Inlet and River,Alaska.Assistant Flemer's report of the results of his topographic rccoiinaissance, begun during tho last fiscal year, around Chilkoot and Taiya iulots, is dated Jauuary 19, 1896. The shore line and adjacent topography were platted and sketched, using a small mountain plane table of Coast Survey pattern, while the topograpliic features of the interior country were secured by photographic panorama views, taken from prominent mountain peaks, as well as from lower cainera stations. On tho plane table he used for the greater part of the work a xylonito sheet, which gave very satisfactory results in the humid atmosphere of the coast, under circumstances which would have made the use of paper an impossibility. He states that he would consider xylonite an itleal substance for plane table sheets in wet weather if he had not found that on his return it showed a decided contraction under the influence of tho drying atmosphere of Washington. His report dwells largely on the methods best adapted to securo satisfactory photographs for topographic purposes. The use which he mado of the camera largely extended the area covered by his reconnaissaiico.

He reports the mountains between the Ohilkat, Ohilkoot, Taiya Sahnka, and Taiya inlets as forming either groups by themselves or spurs emanating from the range forming the divide between the feeders of these waters and the head waters of the Yukon. These mountains are so cut up by glacial abrasion, and by erosion, that they often appear divided into separate distinct groups rather than to be outrunners and spurs of the intorior range, yet the highest peaks increase in elevation when going inland toward the dividing range, which is crossed by tho Chillrat, Ohilkoot, Perrier, and White passes, which a t present offer the only means of reaching the head waters of the Yukon and Dense waters from the south and west. A t present the principal road of ingress is through the Taiya Valley over Perrier Pass, which is about 1190 metres (3 900 feet) high. It is about 20 miles from the mouth of the Taiya River (Wilson's store) to the summit of this pass, and 13 miles from there to Lake Lindeman 0x1 the other side. Slraguay River Valley was explored by Mr. Poudre in 1891, and by others, in the hope of finding ;I shorter road to the interior, but it was found to be unsuitablo for a trail across the mountains.

Tho season's work closed August 14, and Mr. Flemer returned by the steamer Hossler to Port Townsend, and after disbanding party, proceeded to Washington, where he mas occupied for some timo in reducing and platting the results of his photographic work. His subsequent services in tlie eastern section are noticed elsewhere in this report. Topographic reconnaissance to the northward and zoestwa?*dof Ohilkat Inlet and h!iver.--Tlm topographical party under the charge of Mr. Homer P. Ritter began work a t Pyraniid Harbor 011 the 15th of May, 1894, and its progress to the close of that fiscal year mas rioted in the last annual report. Work was continued during the early part of the present fiscal year, and a considernblo area of difficult country was mapped, priiicipally by means of the mountain plane table. The triaugulation of 1890 was utilized for this work, and'additional points were furnished from timo to tirnc? by the party of Assistant J . F. Pratt, operating in the same region. The topography was developed on both sides of the iulet t o tlie mouth of the Chillrat River, and the camp was moved 1o the niontli of the Takhin. From this point a large area was obtained, and numerous excursions mere made iip the valley of t h e Takhin as far a s Bertha Glacier, and also to the head of the Chalzelraliin River. The moving of camp through this country was a work of grest difficulty, the boats liaving t o be dragged over innumerablo quicksand bars, and progress on land was much irupeded by tlic dense and tangled growth of underbrush, through which it was necessary to cut trails. Froxu the last camp occupied by the party the topography of the valley and adjacent mountains was developed as far as Klukwsn and the northern end of Chillrat Lake. On the 14th of August the work of the season closed, and Mr. ltitter proceeded to Pyramid Harbor, where the steamer Basslo. was waiting to convey the various parties to Piiget Sound. Slio sailed on the lGth, and arrived a t Seattle August 31. Here the party was disbanded, and Mr. Ritter, in accordance with instructions, returned to Washiugton. The results of the reconnahsance aru sliown on a topographical map which has been completed aud turned into tho archives of the Survey. The area surveyed during the season WAS 315 square statuto miles. Mr. Ritter's subsequent services in Mobile Bay, Alabama, have already beon mentioned on a previous page of this report.

Topogrupltic reconnaissance on Chilkat and Chilkoot idets.-It was stated in last year's report that Assistant E. F. Dickius, after having completed tho reconnaissance survey of t h e Unuk River, transferred his party t o Chilkat Inlet. On June 18 he began the topographic reconnaissance of the inlet, connecting with Mr. Iiitter's work near tlie Guauegastaki Village, and having finished this work ou July 18 lie transferred liis party to tlie Cliilkoot, filling in the topography of the lower part of the inlet and coniiectiug with Assistant Pleiner's murk. This task mas completed on August 12, and three days later he sailed fur Sitka on the Hussler, from which ship he trausferred his party to the Patterson, reaching Port Townselid on her on August 30. A t this point MI.. S. B. Tinsley, by direction of the Superintendent, mas relieved from duty on the party and proceeded to Washington, D. C. Mr. Diclrins proceeded by rail to San Francisco, and ou tho arrival tliere of the Patterson, September 8, landed and stored his outfit and instruments and disbanded his party. Ue then occupied himself a t the suboffice in the completion of his records and computations. Assistant Dickins commends the scrvices of Mr. S . B.

Alaslca boundary work.-Trianaz&lation, topography, astronomical determinatiow o f latitude and azimuth, and chronometric determinations o f diferences o f longitude.--The initial points of the boundary line between British Columbia and southca,st Alaska depend a t present on tho ratlier crude triangulation executed in past ycurs by the iiaval hydrographic parties. This triiuigu1:~tion, wliile suflicieritly good for mere charting purposes, for which it mas only iiitendcd, does not possess the accuracy necessary for such important work as tho location of a boundary line, its bases having been measured by rough and only approximato methods, and its angular measurements and astronomical determinations having in many cases been mado by inexperienced observers. The discrepancies that have developed in the attempt to fit together arid adjust tlie different sections of this work prove couclusively that a better triaugula tion and additional mtroxiomice1 observations are necessary to afford a reliable basis for the bouiidary survey. It was therefore determined to fit out a strong party of civilian assistants to measure a base, determine astronomical positions, and execute a new triangulation from Port Simpson to Rlarys Island, aud to the head of Portland Canal. The general programme of tlio work outlined was :is follows: The steamer Patterson, while on route to her own fmld of work in Ch:itha.m and Peril straits, to transport the parties, with their outfits, stores, etc., from San Francisco and Seattle and land them at their respective stations; the astronomical and chronometric longitude work to bo first undertaken, astronomical stations being established a t Port Simpson, Marys Island, and t h e liosd of Portland Canal, and the astronomical station at Seattle to bo used as the base statiou for longitudes; Assistant Prernout Morse to occupy tho Seattle observatory, while the astroiiouiical occupied stations at Port Simpson, Marye Island, and head of Portland Canal were siululta~lcously . 1 3 . French and Assistants E. F. Dickins and 1 ' . A. Welker, respectively; by the parties of Aid 0 nine chronomcters, in chargc of Assistant F. A. Young, to be carried on four successive trips of the steamer City of Topeka, between Seattle and tlie stations a t Port Simpsori and Marys Island, while the steamer Euca, with five chronometers, similarly plied between Port Simpson and the head of Portland Canal; base lines to be measured at or near Port Simpson arid the head of Portland Canal, and such triangulation, topography, magnetics, and other necessary work as could be accomplished without interfering with the longitude determinations to be also carried on; on the successful completion of the astronomical work, Assistant illorso IO return to San Francisco, and all the Alaskan parties to be consolidated under tho dircction of Assistant E. F. Diclrins, for the execution of the main triangnlation. Assistants E. F. Dickins and Fremont Morse, with two men and the outfit and stores for four parties, joined the steamer Patterson a t Sau Francisco on April 1 1 , and the latter was landed at,

Seattlo on the 17th. Assistant P. A. Welker, Aids 0. B. French and C. C. Pates, and Extra Observers H. A. Grady and R. L. Livingston, with eight men and the remaining party equipruents, joined tho steamer a t Seattle on April 22. Mr. French was landed a t Port Simpson April 29; Rlessrs. Welker, Yates, Grady, and five men, and the steam launch Pucn and crew of threo men, a t Lion Point near the liead of Portland Canal on May 2; and Rlessrs. Dickius and Livingston and two men a t Marys Island on May 4. Sitos for astronomical stations were a t once selected and tho building of piers and observatories begun. Owing to rainy weather time observations were not obtaiued a t either station until May 14,but after that date, and to tho close of the fiscal year, when the astronomical work was practically finished, no serious interference from that cause occurred, oxccpt at the Mary Island station. Mr. 0. B. Freiich reports that by the ond of June the astronomical work a t Port Simpson station, including time, latitude, and azimuth, was entirely completed, and the station connected by a sruall triaiigulation with previous stations. Assistant E. I?. Diclrins reports tho successfnl completion of the tinie observations for tho longitude determination a t tho Mary Island Station, but some additional latitude observations are still necessary, as clouds and fogs considerably delayed this work. Assistant Welker reports the successful completion of all tho astronomical observations a t tlie Point Lion Station, near the head of Portland Canal, and also that Aid C. C. Yates, under his direction, had measured a base 1 2 9 7 metres in length a t the mouth of Salmon River, carried tho triangulation from it to the mouth of Bear River, and run traverso froiii tho latter point to the fifty-sixth parallel of north latitude. Tho valley of the Bear River has au average width of 1mile, but is so covered with a dense growth of brush and large cottonwood trees that a triangulation up tho river mas considered impracticablo on account of the labor aiid expenso involved, a i d it was decided by Mr. Welker to substitute tlie traverse lino, in which the distances were accurately measured with R steel tape. This also was a work of somo difficulty owing to tho numerous crossings of swift niouritain streams, but the result obtained was satisfactory, and probably better than could be expected from a small sclienio of triangulation. The length of the traverse line is 8 472.5 metres, corrected for temperature, inclination, and catenary. The azimuth observed a t the astronomical station was carried to Bear River in ono sight, and to the fiftysixth parallel in four additional sights. Six points of tho old hydrographic triangulation were also determined, and a topographic survey made from the vicinity of tho astronomical station to tho boundary lino. Mr. Welker furnished the following tabulation of the results accomplish'ed by his party to tho close of the fiscal year:

Assistant F. A. Young, with nine chronometers, made four round trips on the steamer C i t y of Topeka,attended to the winding of the instruments and their daily intercomynrison on each arrival a t an astronomical station, and carefully compared them with those of the station. These comparisons were also repeated by tho astronomer of tho station. The steamer Fuca, carrying fivo chronometers, during the same time made seven and a half' round trips between Port Simpson and the station at tho head of Portland Canal. The data thus obtained will furnish 72 determinations of tho longitude of the Port Simpson and Mary Island station8, and 65 for that a t the head of Portland Canal. Assistant Fremont Morse, a t the Seattlo base station, observed for time on thirty-five nights during the season, and on each arrival of the City oj` Topeka compared hi8 chronometer with those El.

carried by Assistant Young. By the close of the fiscal year three and a half round trips had been completed, and the fourth was finished a few days later, viz, July 7. Mr. Morse t-hen dismounted and packed his instruments and returned to Ban Francisco, in accordance with his instructioncr, arriving there on the 20th of July. Occupation o f the Seattle astronomical station i n connection with chronometric longitude &terminations i n Alaska.-The Seattle astronomical station, in the grounds of the Washington State University, was used as the base station for the determination of chronometric longitudes in Alaska, and was occupied for thie purpose by Assistant Fremont Morse. Mr. Morse was landed by the steamer Patterson on April 17, 1895, and immediately began the preparation of the skition, and mounted a meridian instrument for time observations. E i s standard chronometer wds rated by means of time observations on every clear night, and the other two mere daily compared with it at the time of minding. Special precautions were taken to protect the chroliometers froin sudden or extreme changes of temperature, so that the daily range to which they were exposed did not exceed 20 C. The first time observations mere obtained on April 23, and 35 complete series were obtained during the season. A set of nine chronometers, also carefully protected and intercompared daily, was carried by Assistant F. A. Young on the steamer City of Topeka on four consecutive round trips between Seattle and the Alaska stations at Port Simpson and Mary Island, and carefully compared with the station chronometers at the beginning and end of each trip, and by both observers. The mesther proved very favorable, and time observations wcre always obtained very near to the time of arrival and departure of the steamer, 80 that the results are not dependent on the constancy of chronometer rates in any case for a longer period than fourteen hours. The fourth round trip of the staamer mas completed OII the 7th of July, and the following day Mr. Morse dismounted and packed his instruments, and on July 17 sailed for San Francisco, the intervening time being occupied in finishing up the recorda and computations. Mr. Morse arrived at San Francisco on July 20, and reported for duty at the suboffice.

ABSTRACT OF ANNUAL REPORTS FROM THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE, THE HYDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR, ANI) THE ASSISTANT I N CHARGE O F THE OFFICE OF STANDARD WEIGHTS AND MEASURES,
ABSTRACT O F THE AXNUAL REPORT OB THE ASSISTANT IN CEIARQE O F THE OFFICE. I n Office Report KO.1mill bo found the annual report of Mr. Andrew Braid, who served as assistant in charge of tho offico during tho lattor part of tho fiscal year, his predecessor, Mr. B. A. Colonna, having resigned in March, 18`35. Assistant Braid's report is accompanied by tho annual reports of the various chiefs of divisions, and the details and statistics of the various operations of tlie office are fully set forth. Assistant C. A. Schott, chief of the computing division, has attended as usual to the affairs of that division, end has mado a riuinber of special roports on tho results of the computation of important field operations, among which may be mentioned thoso on tlie results of spirit loveling across tho Peninsula of Florida, the geodetic results in tho Mount St. Elias region, Alaska, and the results of the astronomical work in Alaska by tlie lato Assistant ,T. H. Turner in 1889 and 1890. The important astronomical and trigmometrical work executed by Assistant J. E. McGrath, in connection with the Alaska boundary survey, is now being discussed mid computed, and mill soon be ready for the use of the State Department. A special study of tho longitudo system Uf tho United States has been made with a view to supplying missing links necessary for its early completion. The tidal division, under the charge of Acting Chief L. P. Shidy, has made satisfactory progress in the discussion and tabulation of tidal data, and owing to the great additional labor involved in the preparatioii for publicatioii of tho iiew and extended tido tables for the year lSOG, it was found necessary to increase the forco of the division temporarily by the detail of a number of field assistants. The regular forco of tlie division also voluntarily worked overtimo for a considerable period in order to expedite the preparation of the tables, and a t the same time keep up to date the current work. The reports of the drawing and ongraving divisions have both been submitted by Assistant W. Ward Duffield, mho assumed charge of tho former on Juno lG, and of the latter on July 1, 1895, the two divisions boing consolidated on tho lattor date. The general assignment of work in both divisions has been similar to that of previous years. During the gear drawings were completed for 22 new charts to be photolithographed, and the drawings for G others are nom in progress. The drawings of 43 charts mere revised and correctcd for new editions, and 85 for reprints. The usual number of diagrams, sketches, and illustrations for the roport of tho Superintendent wero nlso drawn or revised; 20 topographic and 35 hydrographic projections wero constructed for licld parties, and til projections mere made on copperplates; 21 fiold topographic sheets were inked and lettered. Fifty-seven calls for information from various Departirieiits of the Govbrnmerit and from the public were received and attended to, many of them involving the preparation of drawings, tracings, or blue prints.

Dnffield's report. The engraved plates for 16 new cliart s, 23 for now editions and 7 for sketches and illustrations, liave been conipleted, :uid a large number liave been corrected and brought up to date; 28 basso and 3.5 alto plates liave been completed in tho electrotyping branch of the engraving division, arid the usual nunrber of photographs, blue, nigrosine, and silver prints have been made. Tho number of impressions from copperplates in the plate printing department is given as 41 951. The chart division lias continued, as lieretoforc, uiidor the direction of Assistaut Gershom Bradford, and his report presents an interesting tabnlar compwison of the issue of charts during the present year and those of the previoiis six years. It appears that the total issue for 1895, viz, 51 456 charts, is a trifle smaller than for 15!)4, arid 6 per cent less than the average of the six years, b u t this diminution is in the free distribution, as tho net sales havo increased 9 per cent over those of the previous year. Mr. W. P. Ramsey succeeded Mr. M. I T .Wines :LS chief of the miscellaneous division on August 31, 1894,and his report shows the iiurnber of the various publications of tho Survey distributed and sold during the year, and the nulubcr oi` rcports, appendices, Coast Pilots, bulletins, Tide Tables, and Notices to Mariners received fixm the Public l'rinter. Ton new agencies for the sale of charts and other publications wcro esta1)lislied during the year, eight on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and two on the Pacific Coast, aiid 1bur old ones were discontinued. In the instrument division, Assistant J. P. I'rutt succceded Edwiu Smith as chief on January 7, the latter being, at his own request, assigned to field duty. Assistant 1'r:itt's report shows that very satisfactory progress has been made, and that a 1:irge amount of` important morlr has been accomplished, both in tho instrument aiid oarpciitcr shops. The imniecliatc direction of tho work of the instrument makers lias remained witli the chief rnechaiiihli, Mr. E. 0. Fischer. Nr. II. Sidney King succeeded Mr. P. 13. Parsons as chief of tlie library and archives division on the 21st of August, 1894, and his report shows the additions to the library during tho year and the number of volumes of records arid original topographical and hyclrographic sheets received from the field officers of tho Survey. I n tho office of the assistaiit in charge, Mr. A. B. Simons rendered satisfactory service as execut,ive and financial clerk, a i d 31r. E. 13. Wills lim continued to keep tho leave of absence records and those of freight, express, ant1 registered mail. Miss Kate Lawn arid Miss Sophie llcin served as typewriters. Miss Ida M.

ABSTRACT OF THE ANNUAL BEJ'OUT O F THE UYDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR. The assignmoiit of Lieut. Commander Jeff. 3'. Rloscr, U. S. N., as hydrographic inspector, Coast ant1 Geodetic Survey, was continued during tho whole fiscal year. 110 has presented a very full report of the hytlrograpliic work executed by the iiaval p r t i e s , under his direction, on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, and in Alaslr:i, and :dso snbniits the reports of tho naval officer in charge of tlie lrydrogrephic and coast pilot divisions of' the office. His report is accompanied by statistical tables showing tho results accomplislicd by each field Iiydrograplric party and tho number of officers nttaclietl to each vessel; a detailed statement of tho repairs mado to each vessel and the amounts expentled tlierefor is also given. The hydrographic inspector renews his recoininendations of last year relativo to tho making of more extended current observations, tho explorntion of tho Yukon River, in Alaska, and the survey of tlie Aleutian Islands. As the steamcr IZussZcr is IIOIV unserviceable and condemned, a new stearner mill bo necessary for this purpose, and t,ho iininediate authorization by ColJgreSS for the building of such a steamer is strongly urged. Tho estimated cost of the new vessel is $125 000. . Lieutenant Commander Moser refers a t length to the grcat loss sustained by tho Survey and tho naval servico by the death of Lieut. P.1. Crosby, w\.ho lost his life i n the performance of duty 011 the coast of ~raShingtOli, as aheady mentioned elscwhcrc in this report.

The instrument division, by Assistant J. Prstt, cliief. 8. The library and archives division, by Mr. LT. S . King, chief. Assistant 13. A. Colonna served as Assistant in Charge of the Office from the beginning of tho fiscal year until March 11,1895, when he tendered his resignation t o talte efl'ect April 10, lcave of' absence for the intervening timo being granted him. By your instructious of March 11, I W;IS detailed to act as Assistant in Charge of the Office during this interim, and on its expiratioxi mas duly appointed to t h e position by the Eonorable Secretary of the Treasury and mas also directed to act as Superintendent during your absencc. The computing division has continued under the supervision of Assistant 0. A. Schott, and the usual amount of work has been accomplished. The force of this division is too small for tlle great demands made upon it, but it lias been reinforced from time to time by the tenxporary detail of assistants when not actively engaged in the field. The following-]lamed members of the field force have thus been detailed for short periods: Assistants A. T. Mosman, H. G. Ogden, F. D. Granger, Isaac Winston, and John Nelson. Subassistants I?. A. Young, ant1 Aids A. L. 13altlwin, 0. B. French, S . B. Tinsley, and E. C. Denson. Yr. L. G. Schultz, expert observer, mas also similarly detailed after the close of t h e work a t the San AJltoXiiO Magnetic Observatory. An account of the special duty performed by each of these officers will be fouud in the report of Assistant C. A. Schott. The tidal division during the whole year was under the immediate direction of MY.1 , . P. Shicly, as acting chief, and his report contains a full account of t h e work performed during that time. The large amount of' extra labor involved in tho change of form of the annual Title Tablcs, the addition of a large number of foreign ports, and tlie fact that considerable time \vas necessarily spent in discussing the proposed changes, rendered a considerable reenforcement of the divisioii necessary, and the followingnamed field officers were a t various times detailed to assist in the computations and compilations: Assistants F. W. Perkins, E. D. Preston, W. r. Vinal, Stellman Forney, Q. R. Putnam, Subassistant F. A. Young, and Aid 0.C. Pates. Notwithstanding tliiv assistnn(*ethe issue of the Tide Tables for 18'36 was delayed several months beyond the proper time, arid tho regular force of the division voluritarily worked overtime in order to expedite the publicatio~~. The usual amount of work in supplying field parties with necessary data, and outsj& parties with desired information, was accomplished, and plans for a new tide-prodicting uiachine,

REPORT

OF THE COMPUTING DIVISION, OOAST AND GEODETIC: SUItVEY OFFICE, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDIXG JUNE 30, 1895.

COMPUTING; DIVISION, June 30, 1893. S I R : In conformity with the regulations of the Survey, I have the honor t o submit herewith the annual report of the work accomplished in the computing division of tho Office during the year ending June 30, 1898. The charge of this division has remained with mo, and tho personnel of the computing force is the same in number as in the preceding year; the position vacated by the resignation of Mr. Henry Farquhar resulted in tho promotion of Mr. H. F. Flynn, and in the probationary employment of Mr. J. Pawling as computer. By the resignation of Mr. Farquhas, ou February 8, 1895, after fifteen years of service, the Survey lost an experienced computer, and one who had espocially distinguished himself in the assignment of excellent mean places of stars for the latitllde work. Mr. J. Pawling reported for duty Marc11 29,1895. During the winter seasou temporary assistance was given this division by tho attachment of a number of mexubers of the field force, with the advantage to the Survey of Ireeping them steadily employed, and affording them the means of becoming more familiar with the methods of computation. Their names, and the dates when they served temporarily in this division, will be given further on, in connection with tho statement of tho special work engaged upon. The duties devolved upon me as chief of t h e computing division include tho direction of the work of each computer, distributing tho same according to his special qualifications, and timing it so as t o secure the best cooperation. They include tho reporting of the results reached and their critical value; the preparation of information demanded for field and Ofice use, aud in the general correspondence of tho O&co and related to this division, and tho preparation of replies to que8tions asked and referred to it. After discharging these aud other duties of smallor import, time was found to revise computations and prepare for publication tho resulting lengtlis of tho Holton and tho St. Albans base lines; to collect and discuss observations of magnetic declination in Alaska and adjacent regions, showing annual change and distribution by an isogonic chart for tho year 1896; to discuss the changes of the magnetic force (in direction and intensity) a t San Prancisc,o; to compute the magnetio observations made at Port Townsend and at Olympia, Wash.; to keep

up to dato the magnetic discussions demanded to supply the charta with the compass variations; to compute the longitude of Camp Colonna, on the Porcupine River, Alaska (boundary survey), from observations of moon culminations and one occultation; to take part in proof reading for report, aiid in the preparation of the annual and tho special statistics of astronomic work of the Survey (longitudes, latitudes, and azimuths) during the years 1888 and 1895, for publications by the Intornational Geodetic Association. The transit of Mercury of November 10, 1894, was observed by me, and the result, together with those of other observers, was submitted for use a t the United States Naval Observatory. Among a series of reports I may mention one on the results of spirit leveling across tlio peninsula of Florida, one on the geodetic results in the Mount St. Elias region, Alaska, aiid one on the results of the astronomic work by the late Assistant Turner in Alaska during 1889 and 1890. A study was made of the prosent gtate of the general telegraphic longitude net of the United States, with a view of supplying a few liuks for its speedy completion. A condensed specification of the work done during tho fiscal year by each computer is herewith presented. It is made up from tho daily and monthly reports, as submitted. I .Courtenay was engaged in the computations and adjustments of the following Edward I triangulations : Vicinity of Lake Tahoe, California and Nevada, 1803; coast triangulation from Moudocino Bay to Shelter Covo, California, 1872-1874, fitting it in with the main triangulation or later dato; vicinity of Uuuk and Taku inlets, Alaska, 1893; coast of Louisiana between Veriiiilion Bay and Sabine Pass, 1882-1889; vicinity of Camp Colonna, on the Porcupine River, 1890, and of St. Michael, Alaska, 1891. Ho also directed tho adjustment of the additional triangulation on the south side of Long Island, Now York, 1888; advanced the office computation of the tri:ingulations of Chilkoot and Chilkat inlets, Alaska, 1894; computed a number of base lines; attended to various geodetic computations, and assisted in the preparation of the geodetic statistics, arranged records and cornputations for the binder, and in general supervised the work of Mr. J. 13. Eoutellc, of Mr. Eummell, aud directed tho work of the copyist. I have also to acknowledgo liis assistaiiccl in the collection and preparation of such geodetic data or information as wero required or specially called for. Myrick 11. Doolittle attended to the reduction of the primary triangulation i n Utah east of the Wasntch ltange, carrying the adjustmeiit of the line Nount Ellen to Patmos Head; computed and adjusted tho main triangulation in mostern 1<ansas, of 1893; prepared abstracts of horizontal rneasuros a t stations surrounding tho old base line in E l Paso Couuty, Colo., aiid assisted i n the preparation of geodetic statistics. During part of April and during Mity Mr. I)oolittle's health failed him. Since his resumption of work ho has co~nputed tho secondary triangulatioiis about Ibepah and Pilot Peak, Utah, 1889, for which data had been received but recentlx. Ilenry Farquhar computed tho places of stars, and tho latitudes of the following statioits: E l Paso, Tex., 1892; Mount Conness, Clalifornirt, 18`30; Mount Ellen, Utah, 1891; Anchorage Poiiit, Chilkat Inlet, Alaska, 1894; and nearly completed tho latitude couiputation of station Moult t Waas, Utah, 1893. He also prepared a list of mean places of stars for tho latitude work a t Sa11 Francisco of 1894. Charles H. Kummell was chiefly engaged in tho solution of equations required in tho adjustments of anglos, of triangulations, or in uiagnetie work; in revising aiid checking computatioiis and tabulations of results. Ho assisted in the preparation of abstracts of horizontal angles o i i the Stikirio ltivor triangulation, 1803; computod geographical positions of the coast triaiignlatioii of California, and between I'ensacola and l'erdido Bay, Alabama, aud computed apparent places of stars for latitude work. John B. Boutelle was principally engaged in sttondiug to the geographical registers kept in tho computing and drawing divisions; in preparing and revising abstracts of anglos, and in preparing copies of results for use in the field or in response to applications, and in copying roports for traiismission; also in attending to tho selection of records of description of stations, and their copying by the clerk for immediate use. Mr. Boutelle completed tho computations of tho triangulations of Suisun Bay, Oalifornia, 1886-1888; of Mobile Bay entrance, Alabama, 1893, and of the south side of Long Island, New York, 1888. He D'RS on field duty between Sopfembor ci aiid October 7, 1894, and again from May 29 to the close of the fiscal year.

Mr. Hazard reduced the transit observations a t San Francisco, Cal., 1890-91; at Oamp Colonna, eastern boundary of northern Alaska, 1890-91, and a t St. Michael, Alaska, 1890-91; deduced the loiigitude of tho last two places froin moon culminations and occultations; computed the astrouomic aziniutlis a t Bear, Ala., 1889; a t Chilkat, Alaska, 1894; a t TJituya Bay, Alaska, 1S94, and a t St. Rlicliael, Alaska, 1890-91. IIc ;clso coiriputed the magnetic observations made i n Alaska in 1593; i n California in 1890-1893; in Southern and Western States by Assistant Baylor iii 1801-1593; in Utah iii 1891-1893, at Carson and Lako Tahoe, Nevada, 1894. Much credit is duo to this computer for the great output of work and its oxcellent character. Harry F. Flynn assisted in the computations for geographical positions in tho triangulations of vicinity of Lake Tahoe, California and Nevada; of Mendocino City to Sliclter Cove, California; of entrance to Stikiiie River, Alaska; of Unuk and Talru rivers, Alaska, arid of Peusacola and Perdido bays, Florida and Alabama; reduced the base liuo a t Baltimorc, 1894, aud conip~~tcd the mea of certain parts of ground about tho nom United States Naval Observatory. Uo also computed mean places of stars, and made some maglietic computations; computed tlio latitudes of Camp Colonna, on the Porcupine River, 1890; of St. Michael, 1891, and of Camp Davidsou, Yuliou River, 1889; also made computations of some miscellaneous astroriouiic work a t Fort Yukon aiid the Porcupine River of 1890-91. Lilian Pike was engaged principally upon the computation, inclusive of adjustment, of tlie triangulation of Stikine ltivcr from observations by Assistants 0. E. Tittinanri, J. E. McGratb, and 11. G. Ogden, 1893. She also took part in the position computations of the triaugulatioiis about Lalro Talioe; on tho California coast above Mendocirio City; of Lituya Bay, Alaska, 1894, arid of Chilkat Inlet, and attended to some miscellaueous work. Jesse Pamliiig, jr., reported for duty in the computing division March 29, 1895, arid was engaged with computations of apparelit places of &tars j in computations of geographical positions, aud other miscellaneous geodetic work. Daniel Hurley attended to clerical duties, preparing copies of descriptions of trigoiiometric statiolis for use by field parties, and duplicating some leveliiig and other records. His efiicioncy is much iinpaired through ill licalth. The following members of the field force were temporarily assigiied to duty in this division: A. L. Baldwin, from September 10, 1894, to January 21, 1895, was cin1)loyed in computatious of tho triaugulations of Atchafalaya, Cote Blanche, and Vermilion bays, adjusting and basing the work on modern data, and extending tho computations to tho Texas bouudary work. The years comprised were 1882,1885-1890. F. A.

REPORT O F THE TIDAL DIVISION, COAST. AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, FOR
THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1805. TIDAL DIVISION, June 30,1595. SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the tidal division for the fiscal ycur ending June 30, 1895:
SUMXARY OF THE WORK DONE DURING THE YEAR.

The Tide Tables for 1896 were prepared and submitted for pnblication. A numbor of important changes have been made in this work as compared with former years. and 1. The name of the volume, mliich horotofore has been issued in two parts as "Pacific Coast Tide Tables," has been changed into "Tide Tables for 1896 by the United S t a b s Coast and Geodetic Survey." 2. The tables havo been extended to tho whole world; the number of subordinate stations givoii has been doubled, and the ports for which full predictions are made have been increased from II total of 23 for both coasts in 1895 t o 70 in 1896. These principal ports are distributed over the seaconst Of the world, as well as our present information in regard to tidal constants would permit; 2 are in Canada, 14 are on 0 ~ 1Atlantic ' Coast, 9 on our Gulf Coast, 4 on our Pacific Co:ist, 2 in Alaslta, South America, 2 in Japan, 4 in China, 3 in the Pacific Islands, 1 in New Zealand, 3 in AUStrdia, 8 in southern Asia, 1 in Africa, 4 in France, 7 in England, 1 in Wales, 3 in Scotland, 6 in Ireland, and 1 in Germany. 3. The foriii for publishing the predicted tides, which has been devitled by me, difl'ers radically from auy hitherto used. The tides are placed in the order of occurrence, as heretofore, but the

96

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

heights have been placed below their times, instead of to the right of them; the resulting condensation is such that three months, instead of one, are presented on a page. 4. The moon's phases, declination, apogee, and perigee are indicated ou the days of their occurrence. 5. The timo is reckoned from midnight without changing the count a t noon; the hours less than 12 are in the morning; those greater are in t h e afternoon, and when diminished by 12 give tho usual reckoning. This avoids a11 uncertainty as to morning or afternoon times, no matter how irregular the tides may be. 6. A brief treatise on tides has been added. 7. The subordinate stations have been arranged, as nearly as possible, in geographic order, going arouud the continonts in the direction of tho hauds of a clock. 8. A column headed ( 6 Standard port for r e f e r e ~ c e has ' ~ been added, which enables us to refer the station to that port for which full predictions are given which most nearly resembles it in type of tide. 9. The table of tidal constants was remodeled and extended, and in the explanation of tables various forinuls were added showing how to approximately derive a iiuiiiber of additional constauts from those fvhich are given. 10. An effort was made to indicate the interval and lieiglit of tho diurnal tide wave in all parts of the earth, but owing to lack of suficient data a t present, littlo moro than a beginning has bccii made in this volume. Our Tide Tables nom cover practically the entire seacoast of the world, but are far from being equally satisfactory for all ports, and w e hope in futuro years to gradually replace the defective values as additional information is obtained. The harmonic analyses, which had been begun before this fiscal year, have been completed for a year of hourly ordinations a t Portland, Me., and old Point Comfort, Va., and for two sets of hourly ordinates a t Philadelphia, Pa., consistirig of five months in 1891, and eight months in 1892. Harmonic analyses from a year each of hourly ordinates have been made entirely during tho year for Galveston, Tex.; Sitka, Alaska; and Buenos Ayres, Argentina. From high and low maters duriug one or two months harmonic analyses have been made for St. Johns, Wemfouiidland; &lifax, Nova Scotia; Baltimore, Md.; Capo Horn, South America; Ticntsin entrance, Shanghai, and Amoy, China; Port Russell, New Zealand; Sidney and Melbourne, Austr:Llia; and ltochelle and Havre, France. The total work done on harmonic aiialysis duriiig the year is tho equivalent of the complete analysis of about five years of continuous records. The nonharmonic reductions completed during tho year cousist of 27 series, the equivalent of about six years of continuous observations, which have been discussed by the first or interval reduction method; and of 12 series, the equivalent of about two years of continuous records, for which second or phase reductions, declination reductions, a d parallax reductions have been made. Tide notes have been prepared and furnished for 133 stations on 40 cliartu. Requisitions from eight field parties have been filled, requiring tho description of 47 bench marks, and tidal data for 26 stations. Tidal information has been called for by 44 persons not connected with the Survey, the response to which required the preparation of 36 descriptions of bench marks, current tables for 6 stations, and tidal data for 105 stations, together with technical letters explaining tidal phenomenon. An aggregate of about five years and eight months of record from automatic tide gauges has been received, examined, and registered. About two years of tabulated hourly heights of tho sea, high and low waters, temperature and density of the sea, and meteorological data, as also 118 original arid 114 duplicate volumes of tidal observations from staff and box g:iuges, were received. The portion of a Manual on Tides, which was referred to in my last annual report, waa completed and submitted for publication last December. This has SinCo appeared as Appendix No. 7, lteport for 1894. On account of the extension of the tide tablos already referred to, Mr. Harris was diverted from original work, so that he has been able to little more than b e d n the continuation of the manual during the fiscal year. A general idea of a new tide predictor, which would combine the desirable features of the Thomeon and Ferrel machines, was outlined by Mr. Harris in Appendix No. 7, Report for 1894.

The instrumon5 and tidal divisions were instructed to cooperate in preparing sufficientdetails to afford a basis for estimatiug the probable cost of constructing a tide predictor; the former selecting such inechanical devices as scenied best adaptotl t o the purposes of tile proposed machine, and making the necessary drawings, while the latter was to furiiiah a list of coinporientu, with tlicir greatest :Lmplitudes, and tlie number of teeth wliicli mould give tlleir propor speeds. It mas finally decided to uiidertnke the construction of the tide Predictor as thus proposed, tho distinguishiug features of wliicli are tlia t it will slion., siuultaiicOWy arid accurately, both tinies and heights upon tho fwo of tho niachine, as well as trace a tidal Curve with luarks upoil its axis to indicate tho exact times of the iuaxirna and minima.
PERSOIWEL O F TIIE TIDAL DIVISION.

Mr. L. P. Sliidy, acting chief throughout the year. Mr. I?. i l l . Little, employed all tho year. Mr. It. A. Harris, omployed all tllo year. Miss Alice G. Revillo, employed all tlJe year. Mrs. Virginia llarrison employed a11 the yeer. Miss Floronce Brower (Mrs. F. B. Burlingme), employed from July 1, 1804, to January 23, 1895.* Mr. Deaiio S. Bliss, omployed on probatiou froin April 2G to Juno 30, 1895. Mr. F. V. Moss, temporarily crnployed from July I to July 15, 180d. Miss Gertrude Harrison, temporarily eniployed, March 13 to June 30,1805. Mr. F. C. Keudrick, tomporarily employed, May 18 to June 30, 1S93. Mr. James A. Dorsey, omployed as inassenger, and assistad in adding and copying, October 20, 1894, to June 30, 1805. Mr. D. Hurley, clork of the computing division, mas employed during tho month of March copying our predictions. In consequence of tho great amount of labor incident to the preparation of the Tido Tables for I89G, the following field officers mere assigned to this division for the periods moutioued: Mr. G. R. l'utnarii, January 30 t o April 24, 1503. Mr. C. C. Yates, January 30 to April 3, 1SW. Mr. E. 1). Preston, Fcbrunry 19 to March 12, 1895. Mr. I?. W. Perkins, February 27 to March l G , 1SO5.

CONCLUDING REMABKS.

It is very much to be desired that the estimate of espel~ses for 189G be n ~ s d o to inclndo proViaion for a t least two additioiial tidal computers; such 811 increase of cmployces would enable us to greatly iqoprovo the valuos given in our Titlo Tables and 011the charts, for, as ineutioncd in my last aiiuual pepopt, tho working force of this divisiou for many years past has becn entirely iriatloQuatofor really satisf;ictory service. It was found necessary to have the whole regular force of the division work overtime in order to coinplete tho manuscript Tide Tables for 189G, and it gives pleasure to testify to tlicir general zeal and industry. Respectfully, yours, L. P. SEIDY, Actiptg Chief of the Tidal Division. Mr. ANDREW BRAID, Assicltant i n Charge O f the OlfiCe.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SUBVEY.

REPORT O F THE DRAWING DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIU SURVEY OFFICE, FOR THE FISCAL YEAlt ENDING J U N E 30, 1895. DRAWING DIVISION, June 30,1895. SIR: I have the honor to submit the report of the drawing division for the past fiscal year. The drawing division was under the charge of Assistant W. H. Dennis until the 8th of May, 1805, when he mas relieved by Assistant A. T. Mosman, who acted as chief of the divisiou uutil June lG, a t which date I was put in charge. The same draftsmen who were employed a t the close of the fiscal year 1894 continued tlicir service through the past year, with the exception of Mr. G. 3 ' . Pohlers, who was dropped from the rolls on August 31, 1804. The disposal of the current work among the draftsmen has been about as follows: Mr. A. Liudenltolil has attended to the corrections of the charts rendered necessary by recent surveys and examinations, especially those called for by tho work of the Army eugiuecrs upon river and harbor improvements. He has also contiiiued to prepare the progress sketches for the annual report, and to coiistruct the projections on copperplates. When not otherwise employed he has made au examination of the temperature and specific gravity obsorvations mado by the Survey in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf Stream, and prepared a sketch with report on these subjects. Messrs. H. Liudenkohl, E. H. Fowler, D. M. Hildreth, 0.H. Deetz, G. I?. Polders, E. P. Ellis, and W. R. Doores, have been mostly engaged upon drawings of harbor charts or publication by photolithography. Among tho most noticeable of these may be mentioned a chart of the coast of Ualiforiiia near Point Yinos; oue of Sitka Harbor; Charleston Harbor; a series of charts of the Connecticut River to Hartford; a map of the District of Uolumbia, scale 1-9600; and several dditions to the series of charts comprising the north shore of Long Island Sound. Mr. E. J. Sommer has contiuued to make computations of triangulations in Alaska; to make drawings for the series of charts of the Alexander Archipelago, and to prepare informatioil for t h e field parties iu Alaska. Since March, 1805, his attention has been principally devoted to the construction of a n atlas of the Alaska boundary, called for by the Joint Boundary Commission. Messrs. Fowler and Hildreth have prepared the greater number of projections applied for by field par ties. Mcssrs. Deetz, Ellis, and Doores have drawn a number of illustrations and diagrams for the report, and the last two meutioned and Mr. 1'. von Erichseu have iisually made the tracings of surveys in answer to applications for information. Mr. von Erichsen, besides the employment just mentioned, has been ongaged upon inking plene-table sheets, mcasuring areas, Inochanical drawings, llnd other iniscellanoous duties. Mr. Charles Mahon has been einployed on clerical work. During the past yeas the practice has been continued of retaining the tracings made in the office in answer to calls for information, and sending blue prints instead, whenever that could be done with propriety. In this way quite a respectable number of copies of topographic sheet8 has been obtained, which may 8erve many other purposes. The general work of the division during the year may be summarized its follows: DrawiugS were COmplCted for 22 new charts to be photolithographed, aud the drawings for charts are in progress. The drawings of 43 charts were revised and corrected for the new editions. 111 addition to this Work there were revised and corrected for reprints the drawings of 85 charts. The usual diagrams, sketches, and illustrations were drawn or revised for the report of the superin ten dent. Twenty topographic and 35 hydrographic Projections were constructcd, and til projections on copperplates. deepsea Tjventy-oliC topographic sheets were inked and lettered, aud a ah& m n w u g soundings of tho northwest Atlantic brought UPto date.

Fifty-seven calls for information were receivod from the various Departments, and from the public, for which blue prints, tracings, or other iuformation were furnished, a detailed list of which is hereto attached. In conclusion, I beg leave to state that although the number of draftsmen has been found sufficient to auswer promptly to all calls for their services froiii other divisions of the office, as well as from other parties, it has been fouud uone too large to secure the desirable dispatch in the publication of new snrveys and iu the incorporation upon our charts of importaut information, such as is almost daily received, which dispatC11 is extreiiiely desirable, cquaIly oil account of the reputation of the institution, the safety of navigatiou aud tho dissemination of useful knowledge.

In fact, tho nuinher of original charts and platcs of nom editions of charts cotnpleted during the year is much la,rgor than has llerotoforo boon rcportod, and ombraces a great doal of new work aiid recent surveys. A large number of important platoS Vere continued during tho year, and iuaiiy of them advanced so far that they will bo Completed and published a t an early date. Tho requisitions for printing made by the chart rooins h a w becn iu oscess of the work done by Over 4 500 sheets, as compared with the vork done for the fiscal year oncling Juno 30, lS!& wllicll is accounted for to a grcat oxtont by t h e printing, during tho months of July aut1 September, 1894, aud JIarch, 1895, of 2 677 sheets from the plates of the District of Columbia survey, 1000 of which were registered, that is to say, that i t required the printing of four plates t.o UIa1io O l l C registered Ijroof, equal to 4 000 proofs, conseqnently a great d e d of tiino m a s consumed, say tn.0 inonths, that could otherwise liavo been devoted to the regu1a.r chart printing. The proofs were for the District of Columbia Engineer Commissioner, a,ud for distributio~i by tho chart ilivisiou. Tlic registration of the phot,olitliograph work has boeii continued i l l this tlivisioii for tho fiscal year eliding Julio 30, 1895. Tliirty-five now charts, ncw editions, new priiits, and re1)riiits were furnishc(1 during the year, malting an aggregate of 10 000 copies, together witli ti00 co1)iesof chart showing tho tides and currents of East River and Hell (fate, and 600 1):isters showiiig the resurvey of Charleston Harbor, and 5 000 copies of sheets NOS. 1, 2, 3, 4, and G of tho District of Columbia survey, enlarged four times. The plato printing office mas continued ,under the direction of Mr. F. Moore, foreman, until April 9, 1895, mheu he was taken sick, and mas run by Mr. Charles 5. Harlow, acting foremsii, until the 20th day of June, 1895, when Mr. D. N. Hoover, a former priiitcr of tho establishment, was appointed foreman. Tho force of tho printers and helpcrs h a s reinained uiichanged, wit11 the exception of the romoval of Abralia,m D. Lovi, printer, March 31, 18!)5, arid the aljpointjnent of George 13.

REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF OFFICE.

115

Ono hundred and fifty requisitions have boon received from field parties and the Office. The fillirig of inany of those has required sevoral days' work of a largo portion of the working force. This work, and tho repair and construction of carrying and packing cases for field instruments, is not sliown iu the foregoing tables. Tho lieatiiig aud ventilating appliances of the graduating room have been radically changed, and tho room can now bo kept a t tlio desired constant high temporaturo with pure air, thus avoiding tlio danger of aspliyxia so immiuout heretofore. The usu:rl amount of work has been done for tlio Office in the caro of clocks, electric bolls, shelving i i i tho library and archives divisiou, miking lilo casus, drawing boards, etc., and such general rcpairs about the buildings as could be dorio by tho employees of the iiistrumeut and carpenter shops. Eight inch position tlkodolites, Nos. 130, 133, and 133, which were useloss owiiig to obsolcto construction and design, have bceri complutely rcmcleled and reconstructed, and aro now practically new instrumeiits; tlie cones of bell iiictal, in red iuetal bearings, 1i:~vebeen replaced by new double-colic ceiiters of liardened steel in fino greiiictl cast-iron bearings, and mi arrmgement added so t1i;it tho positiou of the circles call bo cliangcd without moviug t h e n on tlioir centers; tlio circles have been carefully rograduatetl, overy degree being numbered so that tho circlo can be read through tho iiiicroinotcr microscopes mitliont resorting to tho uso of a tell or five dogroo finder; tlio circles are protected by a light cover spun from aluminum, and very carefully ~ 0 1 1 structod microscopes liavo been added. Theso iiistruinents, although somemliat top-heavy, which is duo nioro or loss to tlieir original design, ilro of a high order, ant1 caii be classed with tho very best of nlodern insti-uments of their size. Two leveliug rods, siipposcd to bo filled with p:ireffin, were ordcrcd from a maker who makes a specialty of this method of filling rods, but after subjecting them to liygrolnetric ch:uiges, and having thcrn compared during tliese cliangcs by the office of stnud;ird weights and nieiisures, it was fouud that they woro iiot iinpervious to moisture, and had so largo :L cliaiige in length, due to tliat affect, that tlioy wcro considered valueloss for preciso lovoling ; corisoquciitly, two now rods wore made of tlioroughly seasoned wliito pino, to be saturated with parafin by this division. This nccessitated tho designing arid coiistructiiig of an apparatus for satiiratiug tliciii with paraffin, which proved a siicccs?;,:is tlio two rods wore impregriated with about 83 pcr cent of tlieir m i g h t of paraffin. These rods :we virtually wooden rods, but tho graduation in;~rks, placed overy 3 contimetres, are on fiilvor-faced inotallic plugs carefully inserted in tho wood. Tlicy were sent to tlic field party early in tlio season, arid from prelimiuaryreports their boliavior has bceii very satisfactory. Tho zeiiitli tclescopo ordered from Waushaff of Berlin during tlio last fiscal year has iiot yet arrived. Among tlia iiow iiistruiiierits purcliasod :ire throo ncw dip circles ( " l < e pattern) ~ ~ ~ ordcrcd froui Cascllu of London. Theso iiistruinonts :wo beiiig constructed to ordcr and aro not espccted for two or tlireo months. Prelilniuary plans for a tido-predicting michine, in accordance with data furnivhod by tlio tidal division, showing a practical assembling of workiug parts, were made and approved. The construction of this niacliiue will be comrnouccd early in the nest fiscal year, as now work can only be taken up when repairs are not prossing. It is uncertain when this machiiio will bo cornploted, but probably not for about two years, as a multitude of working pmts will have to bo mado with great accuracy. I have to call your attention to tho w r y poor and trying light in tho instrument shop during tho short days of the wiuter niouths. Tho books and accounts of tho division and tlie inventories of tho fleld partius aro in ;t very satisfactory condition. A detailed account of oach day's work of each employee is kept on file in tho division. It is with pleasnro that I have to vtato tliat, with slight exceptions, tliero is :I hearty mid conscientious interest of tlio oinployees of the division in their respectivo duties. Respectfully, yours, J. F. P R A ~ T , Assistant and Ckief of Inst~u?uent Division. Mr. ANDREW BRAID, Assistant in Charge of tke Oflce.

UNITED STATES COAST A N D GEODETIC SURVEY.

REPOltT O F THE LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES DIVISION, COAST AND GISODETIC: SURVEY OFFICE, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUXE 30, 1895.
LIBEARY AND ARCIIIVES DIVISION, June 30, 1895. SIR:I have the honor to submit the following report of the library and archives division, Sor tho fiscal year ending June 30, 1805. Mr. F. ET. Parsons resigned August 20, 1894, and I was appointed chicf of the divisioii August 21, and assumed charge on that date.
LIBRARY.

The card catalogue is noarly finished; only a few Government publications and :t few foreign geodetic works remain uncatalogued. Two hundred and two volnnies have been added to the library by purchase, as against 347 volumes purchased last year. No allotment of money was inado to the library this year for the purchase of books, as \vas dono in preceding years. The library of tho United States Coast arid Geodetic Survey should be made tho best scicr~tific and mathematical library in this city. It coritains nom several viiluable works, recently :icquiretl, such as Crellc's Journal (completo sot); Liouville's Journal (complete set) j Xatheinatisclio Anunleri (completo set) j Quarterly Journal of Mathematics (complete set). Probably the library of tho Coast and Geodetic Survey is the ollly 0110 in Wasliiugton colitaining complete sets of all tlie above-named important publications. I mould recommoiicl tlrn? a t least $1 000 be allotted to t h e library for tho purposo of adding some valuable works which it still iiesds. New matheinatical and other scientific treatises bearing 011 the work of the Survey sliould be added a s soon as pr:icticable after they are issued, i n order to kcep this library "up to c l : l t ~ . ~ ~ adv:tutago to the library More good text-boolrs of recent (late are needed. I thinlr it would be if the orders for the piircliase of' boolrs and for subscriptions t o serials, and all correspondence relating thereto, cmanatcd from this division. The system of arranging and cataloguing the library adopted by X I ~ Y prcdccessor, Mr. Parsons, is incomplete and unsatisf;tctory ;is regards finding any particular book from its card i n tho catalogue. Tho slielves are not numbered; only t,lie class number (accordiiig to tho 1)emcy system of' classification) is placed ou the shelves, and that iiuniber is only placed on the first slielf a t tho beginning of that class. I n case several shelves aro occupied with tllc mule class of books; there is nothing on the catalogue card to indicato mliiit sliclf contains tho book mantcd. The shelves should be numbered co~isecutivcly,a n d cvery book on a sliclf' Should have tho nuinbcr of the shelf on its title page, aud tliu ~ a n i onumber sliould be ontored 011 its card (or cards) i n tho catalogue; then the catalogue would tell what slielf coiitained any book wanted, so that anybody could find it. But to do t h i s now mould involve a large amount of time and labor, as it would be necessary to handle every book in the library and every card iri t h o c;rtalogne. The services of two good extra clerks would be required probably two months, perhaps longer, to number the books and enter the numbers on the cards. Tho library shelves liavc, sliari) edges which injure the billding of the boolrs, especially the heavy ones, when they are put on and tiiken off the shelves. I would recornmond that tho edges of tho shelvcs bo rounded off in order to save tho boola from fiirthor injury. The services of an iiitelligeiit clerk aro xieedcd for at least two or three months iii tho front room of fourth story of fireproof, to finish assorting, arranging, catiilog11ing and filiiifi tlio (:ll:u-ts and maps therein, many of which are still in a very unsatisfactory condition as rogartls tlleir accessibili ty. The case that W:LS put up whilu my predecessor W:LS ill charge has fixed shelves. The loose charts aro irijured by beiiig shoved into place on these sllelves, and 1 would rocommend that theso &elves bo changed to sliding shelves, wliicli can bo drawn out and the cliarts removcd or rel)laccd without injury, and the shelves thon diovei1 i n t o 1)laco. S ~ c l shelves l were put in tlio tliree c:ises ]!lade in the same room upon my requisition.

REPORT O F THE HYDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1896.
UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETICSURVEY, OFFICE OF THE EIYDROGRAPIIIC INSPEOTOR,

Wushington, D. C., June 30, 1895.

SIR:I bcg leave to submit tho following report for the fiscal year ending June 30,1805, of the
operations of the hydrographic parties under this office, including the movements of the vessels of the Survey and the necessary ropairs, and a referenco to tho work performed by the Hydrographic Division and Coast Pilot party. T also append report from the chief of the lastlrientioncd division and party, together with a tabulated synopsis of the field work and a roster of ofEicers of the Navy who have beeu connected with the Survey during the fiscal year.
IIYDROGBAPIEY-ATLANTIC COAST.

A t t,hc beginning of the fiscal ycar the acliooner Rugre and party under tlis charge of Lieut. William F. Low, U. 8.N., Assistant, was actively engaged in finishing tho special examinations iu and about Boston Harbor, meiitioii of which was made in iny last annual report. The work was completed 011 July 25, 1804, and the party transferred to Salem, where a resurvey of the harbor and its approaches was immediately commenced. Tlio 1iytlrogr:iplly of Salem Harbor is of tlie most complicated character, and credit is due to Lieutenant Low and his ~ m r t y for the thoroughness with which the work was carried out. The sounding lirics mere run with exceeding care, and are closo enough to aiisrver all present and future requirements. Tho soundings ou the liues of iiitersection cross perfectly, which is clue largely to tho esccllcnt tidal data obsorveci.by the party. Tho plaue of reference obtained from the day and night observations of ono lunar month agreed when checked by the day tides of two lunar montlis, within 0.06 of a foot. By coruparative observations i t was found that high and low occurred a t Bakers Islaud and Salem a t the same tinic, and that, tho yise sild fall was also tho same. The hydrography of' this survey-the first resurvey sirico tho origiual morlr of 1850-;51--difl'ers rnateri:llly, on accouut of the closor developments, from what wo now publish on our charts, and I wo~l]d suggest t,liat it be ntiliecd ou our publications as soon :is possible. Tho work of this party was fillislied 011 December 8, 1894. Tho Eugw IVV:LS moved t o Gioucester on October 0, and tlio resurvey of that harbor commenced aiicl fillislied October 23, when tho Salem work miis resumed. Tlio hydrogriqdiy of Gloucestcr Uarbor, though not of the saino coiuplex character as that of Salcin, \vas oxccuted with great care, slid the results nro very sntisfiwtory. On 1)eceiuber 8 tho Rugre returned to the Boston Navy-Yard to retit, rcpair, overlmul the launcIies, and complete tho office work. 0 1 1 January 14,under orders froin the Navy lhpartinent, Licnteuant Low mas relieved from duty 011 tho Survey, liaving complctecl a successful tour of duty of three years and five inontlis 011 this work, and ordored to duty a t the Navy-Yard, Boston, Mass. I desire in this connection to csprese my appreciation of tho work executed by Lieutenant LOW 011 board tlio I h g r e . 110 exhibited great skill in carrying out tho details, w ; ~ s exact in his methods, ~ ~his c records l reflect credit not only upon himself and liis party but upon the general service.

UNITED STATES COAST AND QEODETIC SURVEY.

Lieutenant Hanus has entered upon his third tour of duty on tlic Survey, and from his previous admirable record on this work we have reason to congratulate ourselves in obtainiug an officer who carries so excellen t a reputation as a hydrographer. After extensive repairs to the E q r e and steam launches, in obedience to yonr instructions t o proceed to 13uzzards Bay and c o n ~ ~ n c t tlie ~ c cresurvey of New Bedford Harbor and approaches, the Zuyrc sailed from Boston May 17 and arrived a t New Bedfort1 May 90. Tlio iiext day tho p:irty began the resurvey by buildiiig and deteriiiiniiig signals, establishing tide gauges, etc. o n tlio 31st of May tho party, liaviug built and tleterriiiried 68 signals anti ~i;itiir;ilobjects, oom~i~encetl sounding with launches 23 and 33. A t the eiid of the fiscal year 341 iriiles of sountling lines h i ~ d been located. h r s u a n t to iiistructioris to survey the waters of the rlortll Shore of nostoll k y from IJynll to Marbleliead, the steaiiicr Baclie, under the commantl of Lieut. R. G . Peck, C. S. N., Assistant, left tlie New York Navy-Yard 011 July 10, 1804, arriviiig a t 13ostoii llte iiest t h y . After c:o~iipleting final preparatioiis, morlr was commenced July 16 a i d was 1)rosecuted until November 13, when tile seasou was brought to ,z close on account of iiic:lemency of the we;tther and difficultyiu continuirig the outside work. Until August 21 the party was employed i n special developments of the survey of 1892, including t h t portion of I3oston Bay extending froiii Co1i:isset to Scituatc, : ~ n d the maters of Broad Sound. These examinations were coiiductcd with marlred success; several original discorcries of sunlten roclts were made, and :is they seriously affected iiavig:itioti. spcci:il reports wcre a t once made to the ofice. 0 1 1 August 32 work was cornrrienced on sheet No. 1, scale 1-5 000, colnprisitig Lynn l h r b o r , tlie Saugiis River, and Clielsea Creek. The ground was covered by a rectangular system o f lines 80 metres apart, and this distance was reduced in the chaiinels for tlie cast atid west lines to 40 metres. Lieutenant Peck took special pains i n obtaining the plane of referencr. Tho zero of tlie gauge was connected with the bcncli mark at the Boston Navy-Yard by careful sirnnltaneous observations. An intermediate g:iugo was established a t Point Shirley, but found iiririecessary ; connection was therefore made directly with the navy-yard. I n the tide reclnction for the Saugus ltiver and Chelsea Creek, :L time correction was used for every quarter-mile zone iuto which the working ground mas divided. The results froin this survey aro especially gratifying, as the offico has not before possessed sufficient data to publish a reliable chart of Lynn narbor. On September 20 sheet S o . 2, scale 1-10 000, covering tlie coast, from Naliant to Cat Island, including the harbor of Marblehead, was taken up and prosecuted until Noveniber 6 , when tho general development of the sheet was finislied. The grouiid mas covered by a rectarigular system of' lines, in general 100 metres apart for the launch work arid 150 motres for the ship. I n Marblehead Harbor the lines were 50 metres apart, arid in the Marblehead Channel the iritcrvals between the north and south lines were 76 ~iictres. The special developments, of wliicli a large number will be required, were necessarily deferred until anotlier season. TWOtide gauges were establislied, one a t Nahant and the other a t Cat Islalid, and both gauges were coii~iected with tlie gauge cstablislied by Licutcnaiit Low a t Salein. This survey, as far as completed, differs from tlie survey of 1854 on account of the more cletailetl character of the lntter. A special examiliation of Tinkers Ledge liaving been orderetl, Lieutetinrit Peck made a careful investigatioii by sounding and dragging, and developed a least depth of -54 fathotus where tho chart shows G$ fathome. After completing some sapplomontary examinations of shoal spots in tho approaches to Boston Harbor, the stearner Baclie left Boston for Gloucester, N. J., November 15, arid arrived a t that place November 20. A ncw steam whaleboat mas received, and the B'nche returiied to New York, arriving Novcmber 23, 1804. The Baclie, having prepared for work on tlio west coast Of Florida, left New York January 9, 1895, and arrived a t Pensacola February 3. I h e f stops were made a t nampton Roads, Virginicl, Key West, Fla.; and Punts Ram, Fla., for tlie purpose of transporting tlie achoouer Spy to Pensacole, Ipla., and a t Tampa Bay to locate the Palatine Slioal. Tlicre existed Some doubt a9 to the correct loCRtioll of Palatilie Sllonl, and Lientenallt Peck was q)ecially directed to carefiiIly determine its pofiition. This 110accomplished in ;I most satis-

All of the \\'ark thus assigned was completed, mitli tho oxceptioii of the entrance sheet, which mas not begun owirig to tho lateness of tIie season. This sheet is nom all that remains to complcto the resurvcy of l'ensacola Bay arid adjacent waters.

was necessary to make some extensive repairs to her hull and machinery, it was decided to place her under repairs. A t the close of the fiscal year the Blake was still under repairs, of which mention mill be made under that head. The steamer Endeavor and its party continued under the charge of Lieut. L. M. Garrett, U. S. N., Assistant. Early in July the vessel left Baltimore for the mouth of the York River to make a survey of the reported extension of York Spit Shoal. A careful and close developinent of the locality failed to show any indication of a shoaling. A t the same time Lieutenant Garrett dotermined the position of the light-houses a t Tue Marshes and on Wolf Trap Spit. From Clicsapeake Bay the Endeavor proceeded to Buzzards Bay and located a number of rocks in tho entrance to Cataumet Harbor, off' Monument Beach, and off Mishaum. Ribbon Heef was also newly developed. A shoal having been reported on the west side of Hog Island, Narragansett Bay, and additional hydrography being needed in Potters Cove, the northern part of Salronet Itiver, and what is lrnown as "The Covo," the R?tdeavor was directed to carry out this work. The shoal, with 15 feet of water on it, was found, and tlie deficiencies named more supplied; after whicli the E?ideavor proceeded to execute the principal part of her summer's work. This consisted i n the dotermiliation of a large number of rocks and the development of many special features in the hydrography along the iiortli shore of Long Ksland Sound from Fishers Island to Throg8 Ncck. This work mas carried on with all possible speed and was brought to a satisfactory conclusio~~ early in h'ovember, 1894. While engaged in Long Island Souncl, the BntZenvor assisted in the establishment of the range signals for tlio naval trial course between Cornfield Poiiit and Stratford Shoal. The red sector of the light-house on Execution ltocks was also located. Pursuant to your instructions tlie Endeavor's party then proceeded to Delamare Bay to make a resurvey of the I3realtrvater anchorage. This survey, executed between Novcinher 20 and 26, shows a general shoaling of about 2 feet from the condition as shown by tlie survey of 1583. Licutenaiit Garrett reports that the gap between tlie Breakwater and the ice breakor haR been filled, and presents ai1 appearance similar to the Breakwater itself, except that it is lower. It is all abovc tlie mrface a t low water, and only a few portions are covered a t high water. After locating the light-ships off' Delaware Bay entrance, tlio Entleavor returned to l3nltimorc to prepare for work on the Southcrn coast. Slie left Baltimore January 12, 1S95, for Cliarlestoii, S. C., to make a resurvey of Charleston Harbor and approachcs. The work was begun January 24, 1895, and completed on May 11, little liaving been accomplished before the 1st of March, however, on account of the severe winter weather. The work of the resurvey commeiiced a t the point on thc Ashley and Cooper river8 reached by the steamer Baclw's survey of the preceding year, and continued Eseaward through the old uiirin channel, omitting such portions as had been recently survoyecl by tlia Corps of lhgineers, U. S. A. With the exception of some alongshore work and special devclopment lilies, for which a. pulling boat was uscd, the entire inside work mas done in the ncw 22-foot oil-burning launch No. 30; tho outside ~ounding 1iiie.s were of necessity located in the steamer. The recent triangulation left little to be desired in the may of sigiials, and necessitated the builtling of very few. Through tlic courtesy of Captain Abhott, Corps of Engineers, U. S. A., Lientenan t Garrett had a tracing made of the unfinishod topographic sheet, whicli covered the greater part of the desired locality. Tlic low and marshy banks of tlie Oooper and Ashley rivers present such an indeterminate high-water niark that the ends of sounding lilies define the sliore line fully as well as any other means. 6` The fact is,'' reports Lieutenant Garrett, "thnt there is 110 high-water line. The whole extent of these banks is ovttrflowed a t high tide, and tlie i r r c p l a r ragged line of marsh grass is the only visible linc of demarkation." Tlie city front, wharves, t.t(:., of Ch:wleston, on the engineer's drawing were surveycd before? the heavy galcs of two years ago, To briug this mater front up to date as flir as possible sextant positions and measuremetits, as tvell as soundings, mere taken along the entire front. The Rhore line of Morris Island llas changed very materially from tho old survey, duo, no doubt, to tho harbor improvements. The plane of reference used for the reduction of soundings is that obtained from a, long series

of observations by the Corps of Engineors, U. S. A., from the Coast and Goodetic Survey gauge a t Fort Sumter. Comparison gauges were erected a t difierent points, and whenever it was possible tho soundings mero reduced directly from tho gaugo nearest the line. Jn other cases a time correction m:is applicd, ailti retluction was made from tlie Sumter gauge. The system of lilies :idopted 011 the inner work is that of right-angle intersection 125 metres apart. S1)Iits mere introduced whcro it sec?nicd desirablo, and special exaniinations wliere the cliart showed shoal spots in or ~iearm y chauiiel or fairway. Tho Endeavor made this part of tho work so coiiiplete that it mill bo many years before another resurvey of the harbor will be necessary, if the conditions :ire ut all stable. Tlic work i l l the old niaiii channel was not intended for a resurvey, as that channel is continually cliangng, and is nom pr:ictically abandoned for tlio jetty channol; i t mas simply desired to cover the ground snlliciently wc?ll to corrcct the charts of tho locality. Daving succcssfully fiiiislicd the work assigned, tho Endeavor returned to Baltimore, arriving a t that port May lG, 1895, mid coiiinieiiced t o refit for tho summer%work. Hydrographic work was also executed by Assistant H. L. Marindin off tho north show of Nantucket and Marthas Vineyard, Mass.
PACIFIC COAST.

As noted in my last annual report, the steanier Patterson, Lieut. Comniancler W. I. Moore, U. S. N., Assistant commaiiding, arrived on tho worlring ground on May 27, 1894, and a t oiice began morlc a t tho north end of C1i:Ltliain Strait, southeastern Alaska. Tho worlr performed duriag the season of 1804 includes Chatliani Strait, from Poiiit Augusta southward to Point Sa~iiuel, west elid of Rennsnoo Island, a distance of 31 miles; Toiialiu Passage; Proshwatcr Bay, and Killisnoo Harbor. Tho coast on both sides of tho strait is bold and rocky: the surroi~ndirtg country is covered with a dense growth of pino and cedar to tho high-m;~ter mark. Tlio preci1)itous cliaracter of the co:ist made the building of Bignals very difficult, and tho measureinelit of baso lilies by tlie ordinary methods almost impossible. Tho work was interrupted on August 8, tlio Patterson leavi~ig the working ground for Ynkutnt and Lituya bays o i l that day for tho purposo of transporting tho shore parties. During tho absence of tho I'nttcrsow tlio topogry)liic:il party was kept i i i tlio ficld :ind continued tlio \vorl; until her return 011 AuguRt 14, on wliicli date the season's morlr caiiio t o an abrupt e ~ i d i ~ oil i g :iccou~it of the necessity of transporting tlio parties of tho A1:tslta boundary snrvoy south. Tlie season's work iucluclcs tlic nioasurenieut of a primary baso 1050.5G7 metres long; tlio establishrnont of two latitude stations, two Ioiigitudo stations, and two azimuth stations; the ewc. tioii of 87G signnls; 3% s?lnaro miles of topogr;~pliy.and 320 square milcs of 1iydrogr:Lphy. Tho results have been mappccl 011 0110 sheet sliowiiig the triangulation, four shcots showing the topograpliy, and five sheets showing tlic Iiydrograpliy of tho locnli ties covered. Tho Putterson returned to San Francisco Scptenibor 7, 1894, where tlio party was eng:igctl in office work during tho mintor. On M:irch 15, 1S96, Lieut. Commandor E. I<. Moore, U. S. N., Assistant, relieved Lieut. Comrnnnder W. I. Mooro, U. S. N.: of tho coinmand of tho Putterson, and prepared tlie vesscl and party under his chargo for tho next seaso1i's work. The Pattcrsou left Sari Prancisco on April 11,1S95, having on board the bouiitlary party nuder the chargo of Assistaiit E. F.ni(.kins, stopped a t T:icoma, Wash., to tako on bo:u.tl Assistant 1 ' . A. Wellrer and party, mid proceeded to soutlleastorn Alaska. After landing Nr. Welker mid pilrty a t the liead of Portland Canal, and Mr. Dickins and party a t Mary Island, tho vessel sailed for her working grollnd, Chnthnm Strait, :wriving 11,18%5. On hcr passage Lieutoiiiliit-Com~ander Moore made a preliminary looittion of Topeka I~odC, iiortli entrance of Wrarigcll Str;iit. Tho work assigued tho Pattersou iiicludcs a continuation of tlio surveys of CIlatliani Strait, the oasteim part of Peril Strait, Hoo11ya11 Soulid, aiid Bootznahoo Inlet. The survey mas commenced May 13, and vigorously prosecuted to tho eiid of the fiscal year, a large amount of work h:tving beou accomplislied in Rpito of rather iuifavorablu ae;~tlior, siid it is hoped tlint wit11 fitir conditions the task assigned tho I'attcrson will t ) succossfully ~ finished. The present commanding officer of tho Patterson, Lieut. Commander E. IC. Moore, U. 5. N.,

comes to tho Survey well equipped for this work, having previously served a tour of four years on board tho illcrlrtkur, froni December 15, 3876, to h'ovember 1, 18S0, aud during the time made it11 envi;ible reputation in this office. With a party as well equipped and organized as that of tho Putterson the results in the field, I a m sure, will be very gratifying. The steainer liassler, under the command of Lieut. G. 13. IIarber, U. S. N., Assistant, was engaged after Julie 30, 1894, in carrying chronometer comparisoris between observatories a t Pyramid Harbor and Sitka, Alaska. Seven and one-half rouiid trips were mado in this service throughout tlic season. During and between the runs tlie party mas employed in determining the topographical features that had been oniitted on certain of our Alaska charts, and which, it was thought, might be of service t o the mariner. This was accomplislied in a highly satisfactory ni:inrier, and credit is due to Lieutenant Harber and his party for the care and skill exhibited in tlie extwition of this work. A t the end of the season the area covered measured 1040 squaro miles, w l i i d i practically completes the topography within the limits of chart 8300. Lieutenant Harber also made numerous corrections in the Alaska Coast Pilot, and submitted notes for the correction of charts 8200 and 8300. The nassler, after giving transportation t`o a number of boundary parties, returned t o Puget Sound in company with tho Patterson, arriving a t Tacoma, Wash., Septeiriber 5, 1894. Wliile a t Tacoma, Lieutenant IIarber was instructed to make a survey off the water front of the city of Tacoma, near tlie scene of the landslide which occurred in November last, to determino tho effect upon tho bottom of tlie bay in that locality. The survey was comineiiced February !I and ended February 23, 189.5. The lines were carried offshore until the soundiiigs indicated tluit the limits of t h a t portion of the bay which has undergone a change had been readied. ~ froni duty on the Coast By direction of the Navy Department Lieutenant IIarber w a relieved ant1 Geodetic Survey on April 11,1895, mid Lieut. A. C. Ahny, U. S. N., Assistant, was directed to :tssume cliargc of the HassEer. Lieutenant Uarber served A full tour of three years on the Survey, and I desire to testify to Iiis ability as a coinrnanding officer, and his zeal ant1 intclligerice as cliicf of party. Iiis con~maittl was always in good condition and ready for service, and the work intrusted to his care was performcd with iiitclligerice and good judgment. The steamer dlcArtlncr, Lieut. F. LT. Crosby, U. 5 .N., Assistant cornmarlding, was, a t the close of the fiscal year 1894, actively engaged in surveying the liydrograpliy of the coast of Washington between Grays Harbor and Jauies Island. This stretch of coast is without exception the most difficult mid dangerous on the Pacific Coast. A s stated in iny report of last year, the progress of tlic party's work a t tlic close of the fiscal year exceeded lily liigliest expectations, 8% miles of soundiiig lilies having been executed. The niontli of July was, considering the locality, favorable for sounding work, aiid ten days could be utilized i n this way. From August 1to November 7, when tlie vessel sailed for San Francisco, only tliree other days could be m:de use of for that purpose. This is believed to represeiit the average conditions, notwithstanding that after October 7 the weather was unusually severe: aud that the number of disasters to shipping mas unprecedented. The fillislied work of the ueason cxteuds from James Island southward to Promontory Point, 14 miles south of Raft ltiver, and offshore to a distauce ranging from 20 to 25 miles. &tween James Island arid Destruction Islaxid (wliicli is about halfway betweell tlie above miles, there are iiinuinerable rocks ;uid points), for an average distance from tho shore of about l& reefs. The shore lino south of Destruction Island differs in cliaracter from that to the north i n presentirig a lower appearance, the bluff8 being of clay or sand in lieu of rocks, while thero aro very fern outlying dangers. The coinp1ic:ttious and difficulties in the execution of the hydrography were many, but it is my opiriion that no closer or better work has been clone along tlie open coast of tlieh'ortll Pacific Oceait. The iilshore work was most thoroughly develo1)cd, so that all curves of equal depth could 1)c drawn with certainty-ixicluding the G , 12, and 18 foot curves-perh:rps tho only iustance of tliat, killd along the coast. The lines from about 12 fathoms out to 50 fathoms were run a milo apart, and froin tliese to beyond the 100-fathom curve, 2 miles apart. The work of tho tiea~ouwas practically dosed when, on the niorning of August 18, OIIC of tile

Steamships run regularly betmeen Tacoma and Sail I~raiicisco;Tacoma aud China, also Vancouver to Chiua; and several lines of steamers in local waters, besides numerous sailing vessels to all parts. Tho hydrography of Washington Sound is new work, and it is cliiofly confined to the waters o f Sail J u m Channel, north OP Turn Island, and the passages connecting this cliannel with tho Canal do Ilaro. Within these limits aro a iiuinber of importaut harbors. There is a triweekly steamer carrying mail, passengers, and freight between Seattle and tho settlements 0 1 1tho islauds of Washington Sound. Lieutenant Flynuo and liis party tfoservo 1)articuIar mention for the Iartrge amouut of work accon~plislicdand for the escollont mannor in wliicli overy detail has been carried out. Upon coriclusioii of tho season's work, and after making certain repairs, tho steamer Qcd?~cy mid party proceeded to San Francisco to re6t tho vessel aud prepare the party for tho resurvey of that harbor. h c t u d hydrographic work began 011 March 29, lS95, and continued until the elid of the fiscal year, whenever favorablo conditions permitted. The general idea of this resurvey I have alluded to nnder tho JfcArthurls work. The Qedney, on Juno 30, had closely devclopod 10 squsro geograp1iic;~l miles, covering that part of Sail Francisco Bay from Alcatraz Tsfaud to Port Poiiit, including ltichiwdsons Bay and ltaccooii Strait. Assistant J. J. Gilbert, assisted by tho party on board the Hassler, made a h p o g r a ~~l ii :tiid c hydrographic survey of part of the Puget Sound Navel St;ation and tho dock front during April S U d May, 1895, for tho Navy Dopartment.

ATI.AKTIC COAGT.

Tho vessels of tho Survey may bo now classed as old, and wliile l l ~ c y h;ive, with few exceptions, been in commission continuously, thoy are in fair condition, considering the limited appropriation av:iil:ible for repairs. Backe.--During tho summer of 1803 this vessel, as noted i n lily foriricr report, received new niotive power and sxteusivo overhauling to her hull. That tho inoiicy was well oxpeudcd is proved by the e2penditures necessary to this vessel duriug tho year, which amouuted to abont $100 for repairs to \v:~ter-closets, launch's cradles, arid a few minor items. The uew motive power has proven very satisfactory. The propeller, Iio\~ever,has iiot sufficient p i b h for thorough enicieiicy, a n d a new olio will be substituted during the next year, which I believe will give the vessel greater econouly. Blakc.-This vessel m a s extensively ovcrhauled, but thoro still remains soine work to bc done upon her to place her in good condition. Tho priiicipal rc1)airs uiadc aro as follows: Cutwnter renewed and stern scarfed; 1 1 6 coal ~ bullker bulkhe:ids mid floors; iiew ltnightlieatlu, port forward chock mil and cathead; new boiler IcceIsoI1S, :hnd rcpairs to inain Iceclso~i j repairs t o bottom metal ; copper cable for lightning conductor j repair8 to iri.jcction valve, heating radiators, air ports, galley, boiler cradles, auxiliary suction pipe, condenser, distiller, reeling engine, air pump, valve chest, sea valves, indicator gear, rock shaft, anchor cnginc, and steam-launch sllaft.

head guide; the eccentrics were turned up, the cylinder rebored, link inotion and main and cut-off valves overhauled. There were supplied R new smokestack, Worthington feed pump, Macomb strainer, copper piping, fie-room floor plates, suction and dischargo for circulating pump a,nd discharge for bilge pump; the boilers were patched, and new cradles and davits for steam hunch and new funnel were supplied. Besides these a number of minor repairs wero madc, a t a total expense of nearly $4 000. The apron of the vessel is badly decayed, and in the near future it must be replaced. Eqre.-This vessel received quite an estcnsive overhauling, as very few repairs have been made for a number of years, and it became necessary to take some steps to prevent deterioration. The running rigging was almost entirely renewed and the standing rigging overhauled, a new bowsprit was supplied, and the spar deck sheathed a i d calked. The vessel was docked, new limber chains mere rove off, ancl the vessel generally overhauled, a t an expense for the year of nearly $3 700. This included repairing the large launches Nos. 22, 23, and 25. Endeavor.-Repairs were made on this vessel to tho amount of $880. The principal items were new crosshead, boat davits, forecastle deck, oil tanks, calking, patching metaI, and minor repairs to hull, machinery, boiler, and galley.
PACIFIC COAST.

Qedny.-This vessel received during tho year a new composition propeller and steel propeller shaft, a new main cylinder and piston, repairs to main valve gear, and minor repairs to boiler and engine. Other repairs were made to the heating system, steam winch, steam launch hoisting gear, deck house, water-closets, steering gear, bulwarks, and galley. The steam launch was thoroughly overhauled. The amount expended on this vessel under repairs was a little over $1850. XcArtAur.-This vessel received repairs t o the amount of $3 446 during the year. Sho was calked and remetaled at the Fulton Iron Works at San Francisco, and partly refastened with 1000 compositioll spikes. The propeller-shaft casing and stern bearing were renewed, and new piston rings and springs supplied; tho spider and follower of piston of main engine more turiied up; tho cylinder of the circulating pump engine was reborcd and new piston ring supplied; the go-ahead eccentric and strap were replaced; the main and crank shafts were lined up; new steam-launch cradle aiid adjusting davits were supplied, and repairs made to reversing gear, rocker shaft, air shaft and brasses, steam windlass, steering gear, and other minor repairs to hull, engine, boiler, and steam launch. Patterson.-Nearly $3 000 were expended on this vessel for repairs generally, as follows: The vessel was docked a t the Union Iron Works and the false keel removed; the starboard bilge keel and main keel repaired; the metal mas patched where necessary; a new rudder post mas supplied, and the rudder trunk and steering gear repaired j the shaft was disconnected, propeller and stern bearing renewed; pitch of screw changed from 13 to 12 feet; new bronze stern bearing was supplied and secured by Tobiri bronze bolts; a large part of the upper deck was repaired and the whole covered with canvas and painted; a new main topmast and six uew closets were supplicd. The hull, boiler, machinery, and boats were generally overhauled. Tho Cosmos was overhauled, deck calked, keel and bilge keel repaired, and metal patched where nocessary. Hasaler.-Early in February you directed me to proceed to Puget Sound and examine the Hmsler with reference to her further usefulness on the Survey. Under date of February 15, I reported to you the history of the vessel and her condition, ancl upon my recommendation you requested permission from the Department to sell her. The sale was properly advertiged in all the principal ports of the Pacific Coast of the United States, and sealed bids for the purchase of the Hmsler were invited. As the highost bid received was far below tho appraised value, by direction of the Department the bid mas rejected, the officers detached, crew discharged, and the vessel laid up a t Port Orchard in charge of a shipkeeper. A11 the correRpondence relating to the vessel is on file in this offlce. Quick.-This vessel was almost entirely rebuilt by Mr. John Hoodless, a t Milton, Fla., for 82 750. The work was very well done. The vessel is nom in excellent condition, and with ordinary care will b e serviceable for many years. 5 .DOC.25-9

UNITED STATES COAST AND QEODETIC SURVEY.

The Transit was overhauled and is in good condition. The Spy was towed from Punta Rasa, Fla., to Milton, Fla., where she will be overhauled during the next year. The Puca was supplied with a new boiler, and the hull and machinery placed into excellent condition. Minor repairs were made to the Tarry Not. After proper advertisement, a contract was made with William E. Woodall & Co. for rebuilding the schooner lVatcAless. A t the end of the fiscal year work on that vessel was commenced. Four oil-burning launches were purchased from Messrs. Clay Q Torbensen, of U louccster, N. J., and supplied to the Blake, Bache, McArthur, and Endeavor. These launches have givrti excellent satisfaction, and I feel quite sure have paid for themselves in a singlo season by t h e increased amount of work returned by the parties. I beg to renew the recommendation mado in my report last year in reference to curreut observations, the exploration of tho Yukon, and the surveys of the Aleutian Islands. I desire to urge the necessity for asking Corigress for ;in appropriation to build a vessel for the Aleutian Islancls work. A vessel able to do this work mill cost $125 000. Mr. J. E. l b e t h has satisfactorily performed clerical duties under this ofRce. Very respectfully,

REPORT OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC DIVISION FOR THE FISUAL YEAR ENDING JUXE 30,1896.
UNITED STATES COAST AND QEODETIU S m t V E Y , OFFICE OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC INSPEUTOR,

Wasl~ingto?~, D. C., July 1,1895. SIR: I have the honor to submit tho following report of the work of the hydrographic division, under my charge, during the fiscal year onding June 30,1895. A few minor functions, not heretofore belonging to it, have devolved on this division during the year, but, in general, tho nature and scope of its work have remained what they have been for years past, and but few changes in the method of its execution havo been iutroduced. Twentynine new original liydrograpliic sheets have been drawn and platted, and the results of extensive surveys have been platted 011 24 old sheets. The work on theso 53 original sheets has involved the study of 228 volumes of data and the platting of 77 697 angles arid 361 172 soundings. Ninety reduced drawings of hydrography have been verified, revised, and corrected. The aids t o navigation have been platted on, or the titles and notes, including ligli t tables, liibve been supplied for GO new cliarts; and 148 proofs of new issues of charts have been revised, verified, and corrected. The work of tho division has further included a vast amount of miscellaneous drafting; tile iilvestigation and disposal of constantly received information from all sources containirig charlges and correctioiis needed on the charts; the preparation of a complete set of sketches showing the progress of finished hydrographic work on tho Pacific Coast, includiilg A h l r a ; the preparation of schemes for new surveys and resurveys; the comparison of old and new surveys for tho determiof the 1)ubiicationof the natioll of needed special examinations; the preparation and sul~ervision monthly Notices to Mariners; sud a largo amount of miscellaneous work, including iuformatioii furnished other Departments of the Government, and Private indivi~luals. The general au(1 routine correspondence of the division also involves a very considerable labor. For a detajlctl statement of tho work performed by the division I beg to refer you to the monthly reports submitted during the year. The work of the division has a t all times been kept well in hand and up to dato through the individual zeal and faithfulness of its employees.

The force employed in the division during the year has consisted of Mossrs. W. C. Willenbucher, F. C. Donn, and F. W. Clay, draftsmen, and Mr. E. H. Wyvill, chart corrector. These gentlemen have been unremitting in their labors, and deserve every commendation. As chief draftsman of tho division, there devolves on Mr. Willenbucher very great and varied duties, all of which are performed with great promptness, accuracy, elid ability. Both Mr. Donn aud Mr. Clay have executed the work falling to them with most satisfactory efficiency and faithfullless. In March, 1895,rooin 74, occupied as a drafting room by Mr. Donn, was flooded, through the bursting of a water pipe overhead, and work then in hand so far injured as to make its reproduction necessary. Since that time Mr. Donn has beeii compelled to carry on his work in a very inconvenient and cramped space allotted him temporarily in the drawing division, and it has been much retarded in consequenco. I beg to renew my recommendation that the importance and variety of Mr. Wyvill's duties as draftsman and clerk in the offico of the division, and the zeal and eficiency with which he performs them, justify his reclassification and advancement. I desire to again call attention to the desirability of an arrangement whereby this division might promptly and without special request receive information concerning the progress of iuprovements making under the supervision of the Engineer Corps, United States Army. Very respectfully, WALTEX MULEAN, Lieutenant U.8 .N., Ohief of Hydrographic Division. Lieut. Commander JEFF.F. MOSER,U. S. N . , Hydrographic I q e c t o r , Ooast and Qeodetio fiurvey, .

REPORT OF THE OOAST PILOT PARTY FOR THE FISUAL Y E a R ENDING JUNE 30, 1895. GEODETIUSURVEY, Washington, D. C., June 30, 1895. SIR:I have the honor to submit the following report of the work of the Coast Pilot party for the f l s d year ending June 30,1895. Under the general direction of the Superintendent, and the supervision of the hydrographio inspector, the duties of this party involve the execution of work in the field and work in the Office incidental thereto. A t the beginning o f the fiscal year the party was engaged in the compilation of fleld data, United States Coast obtained through various sources, for a Coast Pilot volume to be ontitled, `( Pilot, Atlantic Coast, P a r t VII, from Chesapeake Bay Eutrarico to Key West." 1 can not speak too highly of the able assistance in procuring data for this volume that was renderod by the different hydrographic parties in the field, when no vessel was available for the especial purpose. The commanding officers of different revenue cutters stationed along the part of the coast covered by this volume also materially assisted in the collection of tho inforination used in its compilation. About November 15,1894,the manuscript for United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, P a r t VII, was sent to the printer, and on April 27, 1S95,the first proofs of a part of the volume wore received from him. Since that date proof has been received a t intervals up to June 30,1895. A t the rate the proof is being received the volunie should be ready for issue about September 10,1895. After the manuscript for United States Coast Pilot, P a r t VII, had been sent to the printer, the party was engaged in the compilation of five supplements, embodying all corrections up to date, to the five Coast Pilot volumes already published, and which cover the Atlantic Coast of the United States from the St. Oroix River to Cape Henry. In the preparation of these supplements data, procured by the party in the field in 1802 and 1893, was issued, together with later information procured by the party from various 8ource8. Between November 17,1894, and January 30, 1896,manuscript for the five supplements was sent to the printer. The &st complebd supplement was received f r o m the printer on February 27,1895,and the last on April 11,1895.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Besides the preparation of manuscript for new Coast Pilot volumes or their supplements, and the reading of proof, the party has corrected to the date of issue Coast Pilot volumes issued from this oilice. This iiecessary and important work involves considerable labor, as the changes in aids to navigation and hydrography along the coast and in harbors are very frequent, and corrections to printed volumes accumulata very rapidly. The routine work of the party, in keeping up to date detailed records of changes, reported dangers, hydrographic examinations, new information available, and other data which may be used in the compilation or correction of Coast Pilot volumes, is very considerable and constant. The party was under my charge from the begiirniug of the fiscal year until September 22,1804, when I \vas relieved by Lieut. Franklin Swift, United States Navy. Lieutenant Swift remained in charge until Juno 21,1895, when lie was detached from duty in tho Coast and Geodetic Survoy, and the charg6 of the party again devolved upon me. Mr. Johu Ross, mutical expert of the party, has been employed the entire fiscal year in the collection of data, the compilation of manuscript, and tho preparation for publication of Coasf Pilot volumes and supplements. I beg to add to the testimony of my predecessors iu charge of this party, my own acknowledgment of the value of Mr. Ross's services and hearty commendation of his zeal and ability. Assisting Mr. Ross, Nr. Talbot Pulizzi, copyist, has been engaged during the fiscal year in copying manuscript and entering corrections in Coast Pilot volumes, and other routine matters necessary to the work of the party. These labors Mr. Pulizzi has performed to my entire satisfaction. WALTER MULEAN, Very respectfully, Lieutenant U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Beodetic Survey. Lieut. Oommander JEFF. F. MOSER, U. S.

OFFICE REPORT NO. 4-1895,
ItEPORT OF THE ASSISTANT I N OHARGE O F THE OFFICE O F STAXDASD WEIGIITS AND MEASURES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895. UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY, OFFICE OF STANDARD WEIGRTS AND MEASURES, Washington, I). C . ,June 30, 1895. SIR: I Iiavo tlio honor to transmit tho annual report on tho conduct of the Office of Standard Woiglits :md Measures for tlio fiscal year eliding Juno 30, 1895. 1)uring my ;ibsencc in the field, from tlio beginning of the year until Septomlm 10, tlio Office was in charge of Mr. L. A. Fischer, adjustor, and froin Septoiriber 10 to the eud of' tho year, i t \vas iii my cliarge. Tho rcgu1:ir forco of tlio Office remained tho same, ant1 consisted of Mr. L. A. Ipisclior, adjuster, and Cliarles A. Harbaugli, assistant messenger. 111 addition to this force, however, Mr. Jolin I?. Hayford, Assistant, was clct:rileil for duty oii September S, 1894, wliere he reniaiiietl until June 14, 1S95, when ho ma~lgrantoil leive of abseiico until June 30, his rosigiiatioii haviiig beeii tendered to talre e f i x t on that date. Mr. Hayford's resignation \vas tondercd in ordcr tliat he iniglit accopt a position as instructor a t Coruoll University. While iu the Office Mr. Hayford doterminod tlie densities and rnnsses of tho new X set of grauiuio w i g h t s ; niado a redetcrniiiiatioii of tho errors of the foot graduation of tlie United States bench staiidard, and investigated tho beliavior of tlie balance of precision rccciitly acquired by this Oflice. Tho peculinr \v~luoof this balanco arises poi*tlyfrom the high grade of workinanship upon it, b u t largely from two special ausiliary dovices wliicli enablo tlre observer not only to iioto tho oscillntions of tlio beam from a distance, b u t also to iiitcrcliaiige tho woights upon tlio ecalo pans without approaching tlie b:ilaiice. Tlio balance m:is iii J;iiinary, 1SO5, mounted on a brick pier i n an old con1 vault in the southern part of tho Bntlcr Building. This, wliilo not suitablo or tho purposo 011 account of the (hnpness, is tho only pl;u:c availablo, and the result of the ii1vostig;ition uiacle by Nr. Hayford shows that tlio Offico is now i i i a position to rnalre wcigliings of tho highost prccisioii, the probablo error of :I siiiglu weigliiiig witli a load of 1 lrilogrammo bcing 10.0236 ruilligramme. A report on the bn1;uico lias bccn prcp:iretl by 3Ir. Hayford for publication. It givcs me great pleasure to report tliat tho laborious and tedious preparation of tlio State sets of weights :uid iiieasures for North and South Dakota mas filially comploted, and tliey wero forwarded to their destination j i i June. All the work of adjustment aud verification of tlicsc st:ind;irds clovolved upon A h . Pischor. He also gildcd elid adjusted the S set of graniiiio weights, mid ~ii:de four groups of direct couiparisons betweoil the Committoo Metro and Prototype No. 21, with : L viow to sottlirig their relation. Whilo tho results secured are remarkably accordant, it w:is dcemod advisablo to inalre somo obsorvatioris by a method which did not cleliend upoii vicwing ;$ point, or thread, mid its reflection, in the oiids of the Oomrnittee Motro, and accordingly two auxiliary abutting pieces were iiiado, and will be used as soon as the current work of tho Ofice will permit. Rlr. C. A. ITarbaugh's duties are of a niisccllai~eous character, and are porformed with ability and dispatch. Ho compared alcoholometers, etched inscriptions 011 tapes, indexed records, and by his expeditions use of the typewritor assisted nie in preparing copy of the United States Coast aud Geodetic Survey lteport for 1894, for tlie printer.
