REPORT
OF THE

SUPERINTENDENT, U.S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
DEPAHTl\IENT OF CoAsT AND Col\rnrnnoE,

G1wnETIO Sunviff, W asliington, Octobe1' 5, 1918. Sm: There is submitted herewith my annual report as Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1918. This is the eighty-seventh annual 1иeport of this Bureau.
INTRODUCTION.

In this annual report the same plan of division and discussion is followed as in the annual report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1917, with the exception that it contains an added chapter on the War work of the Bureau. in Part I, Chapter I, is a discussion of the field accomplishments 0f the Bureau during the year. In Chapter II is a statement of the needs of the Bureau to better accomplish its field work. W'ln ~hapter I of Part .II is outlined what has been done in the t aJ:imgton office of the Bureau during the fiscal year, and in Chapter ffif Part II are pointed out some of the needs of the 'Washing0~ ? . cc. Chapter III of Part II contains a statement of the ac iv1ties of the Bureau in connection with the war. In Part III is given a resume of the work accomplished in the fi eld and office during the year.

Part !.-FIELD WORK AND NEEDS OF THE FIELD SERVICE.
CHAPTER I.
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR.

In the report of this Bureau for the fiscal year ended ,June 30,
l!H 7, were shown in the main the characteristics of the coast lines of

the United States and possessions, under four general classifications, and this was followed by a detailed statement of the conditions and progress of the hydrographic surveys up to that time. (See pp. 8 to 41, inclusive, of the Report of the Superintendent of the United States Const and Geodetic Survey for the year ended ,Jnne 30, 1917.) It is unnecessary to repeat here the discnssion in that report, except so far as it relates to the hydrographic work accomplished during the present fiscal year, but it is referred to, as it contains a statement of the hydroO'raphic problem before the Survey and will lend assistance in considering the relation of the hydrographic work done during the fiscal year to what yet needs to be done. Considered from the standpoint of units of classification, the field work accomplished by the Bureau during the fiscal year ended June 30 1918, is best expressed as follows: Hydrography: (1) Ship and launch hydrography, (2) wire-drag surveys, (3) revision work, (4) current observations, (5) tidal observations, and (6) topography. Geodesy: ( 1) Triangulation, ( 2) precise levels, and ( 3) magnetic observations.
HYDHOGHAPIIY.

1. 8_hip an~ l0;unch hydrography.-The vessels of the Bnreau ~n comm1ss10n w1thm the year were as follows: Surveym', Bache, Isis, Matchless, Ilydrographer, Patterson, Emplorer, Yulcon, Talcu, Pathfinder, Fath01ner, Marinduque, R_esearch, and. f!r:mulon. The Sur'veyor, Bache, and Isis were reqms1t10ned by the Navy Department as auxiliaries to the naval fleet, and t~lrnn over by Executive order on September 24, 1917. From that tn11c throughout the fiscal year they have been under the control of the Navy Department. The Explorer was on field duty only during the first month of the fiscal year, the Patterson from the beginning of the year to the close of September 23, and the Talcu less than a month. Dming 1918 the Navy Department felt the need of additional vessels to patrol the waters of the Pacific coast, and on May 16, Hl18, the Patterson, now the U. S. S. Forward, and the Explorer were transferred to the naval fleet by Executive. order. The surveying seasons of the Explorer and Talcu were necessarily prematurely closed because of the mutiny and desertion of their crews, and the Patterson, Emplorer, and Talcu were not sent to the field in the spring of 1918, bcca11sP of the lack of officers and the difficulty of enlisting crews owing to labor coneitions.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

The form of enlistment under which seamen are employed on the Vessels of this Bureau amounts to no more than a civil contract, imd this form of enlistment is as :favorable as can be drawn for the Government under the present laws. Under normal conditions, when there was no keen competition for seamen, this enlistment served the purpose of the Bureau very well, though even then if a sailor chose to desert there was no recourse but to give him an "unfavorable discharge." As the demand Jor skilled labor has grown under present war conditions, the weitkness of such a form of enlistment has become more and more evident. Employment on a Vessel of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is not looked upon with as much favor by seamen as is employment on a vessel of the merchant marine, for the reasons that ernployment on a vessel of the merchant marine may be continuous, while on a vessel of the Coast :ind Geodetic Survey on the west coast it is only during the surveying season, with the certainty that at the tern,1inati01; of the. season the employment ends at least for months. 'I he duties reqmred to be performed by a seaman on a merchant-marine vessel are less exacting than on a vessel of the Coast and Geodetic Suncy. A seaman on a merchant-marine vessel receives overtime pay for overtime service, while sueh a condition of employment is in1pmcticnble on a Government Yessel. I have presented this matll'r of enlistment of seamen on vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey more in detail under the head of "Needs of the field service" in another cha.pter, and hope that the requisite legislation may be enacted which will make possible an enlistment of seamen on the vessels of t:he Coast and Geodetic Survey that will insure adequate service. Of the five vessels that have been in use by this Bureau in the survc:ys of the waters of the Philippine Islands, four belong to the msular government, namely, the Fathomer, ill arinduque, Hesemиch, and Romblon. The officers of these four vessels were of ~he technie.al force of tl~is Bure~n. \~hen the neec~ became manifest Old men ,w1~h the tech~1cal qnal1ficat10ns of th~ ofhccrs of the Coast an Geodetic Survey m the Army and Navy m the prosecution oi the war, more than half of this technical force was transferred to the mi.litary branches of the Government by Exeentive order. as autho~и1zed by section lG of the "Act to tmi1porarily increase 'the c?mm1ssjoned and warrant and enlisted stre1?gth of Navy and Marme C:orps, and for: other purposes," approved :May 22, 1917. This necc:s1tated the withdrawal of a number of these officers from service on the vessels loaned by the insular "'0Verи11 me11t I и и и1 t f ffi и ' o .. n view o.f t 1 11s s 10r age o o cers and the fact that the Resea?'clt had ractically completed the survey of all sheltered waters where it, s saf~/<:>r h~~ to go, and further on account of her nge and weakei~!d con itwn 1 was unsaf~ to sencl her to survey exposecl waters, she was "'OVermne11t tl1e l"tte b . turned cl tl back 111 toи the d msular b " r par t o.f D ece1n. er и an и 1 e . arm uque was transferred back temporarily to the msu1ar goveynment on March 19, 1918. 1.

GEODESY.

1. Triangulation.- Primary иtriangulation was accomplished in the localities: Along the Rio Grande in Texas and in the vicinity of Stephens Passage and Lynn Canal, southeast Alaska. The total extent of this triangulation is CiBD miles. Primary traverse was carried on in the following localities: Mostly in Georgia but also in South Carolina and Virginia. The extent of this traverse is 940 miles. Tertiary triangulation was executed in the following locality: Along the Cape Fear.River in North Carolina. The extent of this tertiary triangulation is 70 miles. 2. Prcci8e Zwvcl8.-During the year 2,3Ci7 miles of precise levels were run as follows: In Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi. Aln bama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. 3. 111agnctic obscr1Jations.-In the continuation of the magnetic survey of the Unikel States, observations were mad-c during the year at 275 stations in 21 States, of which 118 were new prilllary statlons, 114 auxiliary stations, 34 repeat stations for the determination of secular change, and D 1ww stations in old localities. Mericlian lines were established when they were requested by the local authorities. The number of county scats at which magnetic observations have not been made was reduced from 1G3 to 138. The observatories at Cheltenham, Md.; Vieques, P. R.; Tucson, Ariz.; Sitka, Alaska; and near Honolulu, Hawaii, were in operation throughout the year. Continuous photographic records were secured of the variations of declination, horizontal intcnsit~'и and vertical intensitv. Absolute observations were made at least once a week and scale vi\l11e determinations once a month. Beginning with ,January, 1DlS, horizontal intensity observations as well as dip and declination were made both in the m'orning and in the afternoon on the same day to secure additional data rPgarding the relation between the variation and absolute instruments.

CHAPTER II.
NEEDS OF THE FIELD SERVICE.
SURVEYING VESSELS.

In my report for last year there was fSiven a spec~fic and detailed statement so far as information was available regardmg the pi:ogress and condition of hydrographic surveys of. al~ the waters _contig-uous t? the United States and possessions, and. mcidentt~l to this a discussion of the various classes of hydrograpluc surveymg. . . The most costly class of hydrography, and from many pomts of view the most important, is ship hydrography. There are thousands upon thousands of square miles of this class of hydrography that should be executed without further delay. These are areas removed from the sight of land exposed waters in extensive bays_ and sounds, and waters of foose r~gions nearer shore where there ~s no refiige for. smaller craft, relatively costly because of the large umt of orgamzation that is required to perform the work. On the other hand, the results obtained ca 11 be secured in no other way and by no other ~neans, and arc of the utmost importnnce to maritime commerce, and lll many instances the development of industries is actually retarded or prohibited because of the lack of these surveys. Alaska presents the most striking example of this state of affairs. The latent commercial possibilities of this great Territory have been but little exploited, and the rn~tural resources of the country in the way of the known vast deposits of coal, copper, etc., lay dormant largely because the country is commercially only accessible through her waterways, -and these are but meagerly surveyed. Charts of these waters are issued continually, which from the nature of their origin are known to be indifferent approximations of what should be represented. They are of many important regions, mere compilations from surveys datin~ as far back as the time when Russia owned the territory, from incidental soundings by fishing schooners and other vessels that venture into unsnrveyed waters, and from soundings by. o~lrnr Government vessels venturing into tlwse waters on other missions. S_uch charts may be in many instanct>s worse than useless to th~ n~vigato~, because ~hey lend assurance where dange1и lurks an? pu_i po1 t to gmde the navigator to safety where if he escapes destruction it results more from chance than from representations on the.chart .. And e~en the charts that nre issued of many localities are v01d of mformat10n because no official surveys have been made by the Gov~rnment, and no official examinations have been made by other. agencies. (See figs. 3 and 4.) This lack <?Б adequate surveys is keenly felt by the shipping_ interests that risk their vessels in Alaskan waters. There are reg10ns W!iere industries ~re :rn:aiting development, where these companies will under no consideration send their vessels beeause of the unknown dangers, and this caufrm is grounded on experience such as is shown

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

by a letter received from the general manager of the Pacific Steamship Co., under date of May 2, 1918, wherein he says, in part:
At the present moment the Pacific Steamship Co. has two 11assenger steamers in trouble in southeastern Alaska as the result of unavoidable stramlings. First, the Admiral Evans, which struck an uncharted rock in the entrance of Hawke Inlet, as a result of which it was necessary to beach her innnediatC'ly, where she now lies with her stern in 11 fathoms of water. 'l'hirty days' salvage operations have failed of results, and the best we can hope for is the loss of the use of the vessel for six months, and a total expense of from $300,000 to $400,000 for recovery and rC'pairs. After the accident a Survey ve>:sel was sent to the spot and discovered and huoyed the rock, thus adding one more expensive unit to the accidental survey of Alaskan waters. Our S. S. Admiral Parrayut, while steaming north from Petersburg on AJ;>ril 2G, struck an unknown obstruction, hut where the e11art showed 3 awl 3f fathoms of water, nlHI the tide one hour to go, with the vessel drawing 19 feet and G inches aft, probably not over lG feet forward. Her Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 5 tanks are leaking. Tl1e pumps were able to keep her afloat until she anived at Juneau, where she is now c1ischarg;ing; cargo, and it will urnloubtetlly he necessary to bring her to Seattle for extensive rermirs. I understand some of the Coast and Geodetic Survey people were ahoar<l the A rlm iral lи'arra17ut when she struck, and you will prohnbly he apprised of the details.

Here the loss to a single company operating steamers in Alaskan waters, in two instances, has been in excess of the entire appropriations for the Coast and Geodetic Survey by this Government for the current year for surveying the waters of Alaska, 'Vashington; Oregon, "California, the Philippine Islands, and Hawaii, and the yearly loss of vessels in the unsurveyed waters of Alaska alone would go far toward supplying vessels sufficient to make the necessary surveys to aid and assist commerce in these waters, but which should certainly now be expedited when commerce is pushing its way into these waters regardless of the lack of surveys, and paying the price in a loss of ships and cargoes that averaged $490,300 annually during the 10-year period from 1906 to 1915, inclusive. While the great stretches of unsurveyed or inadequately surveyed waters bordering the coasts of the Territory of Alaska present a most striking example of the retardation of a country's commerce an<l development, which could be stimulated to return a profit far in excess of the cost of proper surveys, this is not peculiar to Alaska alone. Ship-borne commerce is traversing the waters of some of the coasts of continental United States and escaping destruction more through the experience and knowledge of the navigator than by ohe guidance of charts that contain all the inf<?rmation that is necessary. The general surveys of the coasts of W ashmgton were made between 1873 and Hl94, of Oregon between 1868 and 1891, and of California between 1858 and 1901. These surveys were, for most of the sections of the coasts, in the nature of reconnaissance, and extended in but few instances beyond the 100-fathom curve, and indeed in some instances between the 50-fathom curve and the 100-fathom curve the charts are void of information. It was fully realized at the time that this survey must later be supplemented by other work, but the then pressing needs demanded a general knowledge of all waters of the coasts rather than definite knowledge as to a selected part and no knowledge as to the remainder. Therefore, the whole coast was covered by a quite gene.ml survey. Figure 5 affords a tangible illustration of the scant information that the resulting chart contaim. The acquisition of Alaska in 1867 with her thousands of miles of shore line placed before the Bureau a task that its facilities have

never since been expanded to meet, and with the except~on of fr~~ mentary examinations here and there supplemented by rnformat10n of doubtful value accepted from unofficial sources, the charts of the ~oasts of Wash.ington, Oregon,,and California have b~en issued year after year .wluch could contam only the data obtamed from the above-i;ient10ned reconnaissance surveys. It m1ght be urged that since 50 fathoms . (300 feet) afford depth of water in which no vessel has a draft such that it will ever run afoul of the bottom, there is no apparent need of surveys of waters of great~r ~epth. Based on the necessary depth fpr the d_raft of a vess.el tlus is true, but a knowledge of the depths is es ential to the ~av.1gator ~ron: a wholly different point of view, namely, that of ass1stmg nav1gat1on. , The prevailing weather along the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California is in nautical language "thick;" that is, heavy forrs are the rule. A vessel from San Francisco to Puget Sound may be for hours, or even throughout the trip, hidden in a mist that ob. scures land and sky. Under such circumstances the master judges tlie location of his vessel by the distances and direction he has rm) as shown by the speed of his engines, the time that has elapsed since leaving a known position, and his di.rection by the cmnpass. There are other factors that may contribute to place a vessel in a position entirely different from that which would result. from calculations based on the above elements. The currents of the waters adjacent to the Pacific coast line of the United States vary both in direction ~nd strength and observations have not yet been made sufficient to predict these currents. These currents may retard or accel~rate a vessel, or carry her toward or from the land, and after steammg for hours through a thick fog, a v.es el that according to reckoning from speed and direction taken may be at the position according .to her cour~e as plotted on the ch art or dangerously near destruct10n by runmng ashore. Under these eircumstances a chart that showed depths out to the thousand-fathom curve w.ould be of und niable value. Given all the characteristic depths of the waters along the coasts out to the thousand-fathom curve, a navigating officer is nearly as well guided as is a citizen in a city by the names of the street~ on the ~amp-posts . It is. essential that surveys be extended out to the 1 ,00~-fathom depths m orde1: that we may be reasonably sure that no undiscovered shoal areas exist, which if found by the navigator might be mistaken for shoal areas already shown on the shart and thus lead him astray. . .The examination of any chart where a close survey has b~rr made Wlll sho~ from the varying depths that in but few places is the bott,om. of the ocean plane, but, on the other hand, is undulating, .or ma3 drop off to abrupt depths where there are underwater banks that correspond to the bluffs along a river or the seashore. Below moderate depths . and the influence of waves and strong currents (p1:obabl}'.' below 50 fathoms) the topography of the ocean bed remarns fairly constant. With then a chart showing these details out to the thousand-fathom curve a vessel could proceed from San Цrancisco to Seattle, though engulfed in a dense forr throurrhout the 0 Journey, with assurance of the position as judrred from the course run and checked by soundings, for though th~ vessel was thrown

14

off her course by adverse currents, this would at once become apparent by the soundings showing depths different from those shown on the chart at the supposed position of the vessel, and it would be only a matter of further sounding and comparison of depths indicated on the chart to estimate the position of the vessel, Бor it is to be remembered that though other mfiuences may vary, as the speed of the engine, the direction of the compass, and the direction and velocity of the currents, yet the depths when once known, below comparatively shallow ones, remain constant and are a sure guide. The assistance that known depths afford the navigator and how he may be misled by unknown depths are shown by figure 6. Reference has been made above to the currents of the Pacific coast. The general conception of a hydrographic survey is one that develops the depths of the water and discloses the nature of the bottom, but the direction, strength, and time of ebb and flow of the currents of the Pacific coast of the United States are quite as important as is other nautical information, mainly because of the heavy fogs that hang over these waters making it necessary to determine t}1e position of a vessel after hours of progress by taking into consideration all the known elements that may have influenced her position up to the time that it is desired to lmow her position. On the Pacific the ocean currents, mainly from lack of proper observations over a sufficient period, have so far eluded any exact estimate of their influences. A theory has long been held, and from which there is but little doubt, that practical results of the utmost value will be obtained from continuous observations taken Бor the Coast and Geodetic Survey from light vessels which are stationed at positions that present points of peculiar vantage, and from the information thus gained at least general predictions could be made that would be of material assistance to navigators. While Alaska is suffering loss of shipping and her development retarded from the lack in some regions of any surveys and the Pacific coast of the United States is in need of more complete surveys, there is yet one other condition that must be met by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in order to keep the information current on the charts that are issued. This condition is aptly illustrated by the sandy formation beneath the waters adjacent to Cape Cod. Herc is a section of the coast (and it is characteristic of many others) where a complete hydrographic survey may show the depths at the time the survey is made and be absolutely in error after a severe storm, should one occur directly after the completion of the survey, or it 1nay be accurate for months, depending wholly upon how the loose sand forming the bottom may be shifted. It is difficult to draw the line as to just how often and how thorough surveys should be made of such localities, but certain it is that where the value of the vessels lost is equal to or in excess of the cost of proper surveys can be attributed to lack of information as to existing conditions, then, to this extent at least surveys should be made. And the vessels that are lost in such waters are not so small in number or value. The New England Fisheries, printed at Boston, Mass., is authority for the statement that along 40 miles of Cape Cod shore 592 vessels have been lost during 50 years, giving specifically the names of the vessels and dates of their loss. F-igure 7 reproduced from that publication shows the positions where these vessels were lost.

It would be erroneous to assume that all these vessels or even a considerable proportion of them were lost because the Government charts lacked information they should ha-ve contained, or contained inaccurate information, but, on the other hand, it can not be asserted, in view of the known fact that changes occur in such localities oftener than surveys are made, that some of these vessels were not led to destruction by risking the shorter inside route where favorable depths that might not have existed at the time were shown on the charts, rather than taking the longer outside course. The shifting sandy bottom around Cape Cod is but one example of иsuch conditions. Wherever there is a combination of sandy bottom in waters of moderate depths and prevailing strong currents, or severe storms that cause strong currents, the depths over these areas do not remain constant, and continuous examinations are necessary. That these changes are more rapid beneath the waters to a depth not in excess of wave an'd current effects than above the surface of the water is beyond dispute, yet they are quite marked even above the surface of the water, instancel'l,of which are noted in the annual report of this Bureau for 1917, wherein it was shown that the shore of Rockaway Inlet has advanced 3! miles in 79 years, and that the sand spit that forms the protection for Assateague anchorage is being extended at the rate of 200 yards a year. These then are the conditions that form the three prime requisites for additional vessels for the Coast and Geodetic Survey; a matter that should have the earnest consideration of all partif.>s interested in affording reasonable protection to the safety to commerce and human lives that are carried upon the waters over which the Bureau is responsible for charts bearing proper data. The totally unsurveyed areas in Alaskan waters should certainly have immediate attention that commerce between that country and the outside world may be quickened; the incompletely surveyed waters of the three Pacific Coast States from which the surveying vessels of the Bureau were diverted to Alaskan waters on the purchase of that Territory (with a coast line. greater than the whole continental United States) ought to be closely examined out to the thousand-fathom curve so that vessels aggregating in value far in excess of the cost of needed surveys will not be lost on account of insufficient data (see figs. 8 and 9) ; and, finally, examinations should be made to the extent that the benefits are justifiable in comparison with the cost of surveys of those waters frequented by marine commerce where strong currents and severe storms shift the shore lines and the contour of the sea bottom. A common-sense consideration of whether or not the Coast and Geodetic Survey is now supplied with a sufficient number of surveying vessels, and if not, what the required number is, must, it wouid seem, lead to a determination of some standard which shall be the measure of the proper completeness of surveys. It is obvious that it would be folly to have no Government or other surveys and leave the master of a vessel to seek his way without a chart from which to select his course and without aids to navigation to warn him of danger. On the other hand, it is conceded that Government surveys could be carried on to such an extent of comJ?leteness and mmuteness that the cost would be wholly disproportionate to the benefits gained. Between these two extremes there must be a mean

that shall determine the standard 0Б completeness of surveys, and while this mean can not be defined with exactness, it is sufficient to say that where the cause 0Б the loss of vessels of a value in excess of the cost of proper surveys can reasonably be attributed to the lack of :{lroper surveys, then, and to that extent at least, vessels should be provided for making proper surveys. Measured by this standard, the Coast and Geodetic Survey has not now, and has not had for years past, enough surveying vessels to keep pace with the needs of maritime commerce. I have already cited the fact that there are vast water areas along the coasts of Alaska where no hydrographic surveys have been made and other areas where the charts are based on soundings of Russian origin, and that to this day the charts of important waters adjacent to Washington, Oregon, and California are issued showing the results of little more than preliminary surveys made years ago. This is a state of affairs that now ought not to be. Vessels are being lost in these waters year after year of a value far in excess of the cost of surveying vessels for making proP.er surveys, to say nothing of the human lives that are also lost, and the loss of some of them at least can be attributed to the lack of proper surveys. I showed in my report for 1917 how the Bear was a total loss just north of Cape Mendocino through the master being misled by lack of information on the chart, and I have quoted earlier in this report a letter from the general manager of the Pacific Steamship Co. to the effect that two vessels 0Б that company had come to grief, entailing a loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is needless to burden this report with other similar citations. I know of no better way to sum up the situation than by comparing the area surveyed by the vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the waters of the three Pacific Coast States and Alaska during one year with the total area of these waters that remain,t_o be covered by surveys that can not be made by other than surveying vessels. In making this comparison it would be unfair to use the area covered by these vessels during .the fiscal year ending June 30, 1918, because conditions were not normal in that some of the surveying vessels were unable to do a full season's work as men to man the vessels were unobtainable, and further because two of the surveying vessels were during the year taken over by the Navy Department. I shall therefore use as a basis of comparison the areas covered by the surveying vessels in these waters during the fiscal year ending June 30, 19172 which was a normal year. The table below gives a summation the areas covered by the different vessels:

The conclusion is inevitable that if these conditions are goin~ to be remedied more surveying vessels must be put into the field in these waters to bring these surveys up to a standard of completeness where the value of the vessels lost yearly through the lack of proper nautical information will not be so entirely out of proportion to the cost of vessels to make proper surveys. And the wisdom of such a move is the more evident when it is considered that vessel for vessel the cost of a surveying vessel is usually but a fractional part of the cost of the merchant vessel that is lost. This is because a freight иvessel to be operated with profit must be of several thousand tons displacement to have the most economic carrying capacity, while the most effective surveying vessel is of but about a thousand tons displacement. The thought may arise that since surveys are so badly needed of the waters adjacent to Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California, it might be well to withdraw vessels from other waters, such as the Atlantic coast or the Philippines to make these surveys. The Atlantic coast where such conditions exist as abound in the vicinity of Cape Cod, for example, is just as sorely in need of vessels to make necessary surveys as is the Pacific coast. Proper surveys of the waters adjacent to the Philippine Islands are to-day more advanced than of any other Pacific coast waters over which this Bureau has jurisdiction, but this is because vessels for !llaking surveys, with the exception of one, were furnished by the Insular government, but as they belong to the Philippine Islands they can not be withdrawn to other waters. There is one other consideration that has not yet made its effect felt through direct application, but which should have the greatest weight in connection with this problem, and that is, that in the past :many of the vessels that have frequented our waters and which have been subject to danger through lack of proper surveys have been of foreign register, but with the great advance in shipbuilding in this ~ountry our own money invested in our own ships will of necessity in the future be subjected to this danger of losshand it is good business to look to the future and consider that t e cheapest form of :marine insurance is to spend a few thousands of dollars for vessels to :make proper surveys rather than lose many thousands or millions of dollars and also human lives in vessels lost through lack of proper surveys.

to relieve the situation in the Pacific coast waters, but the disparity between what can be done when these vessels are added to the fleet of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and what remains to be done is so great that the surveying fleet must still be augmented to bring our hydrographic surveys up to the standard of completeness that should prevail in order that navigation can be reasonably safeguarded.
WIRE-DRAG LAUNCHES.

While surveys of water areas removed from the sight of land, exposed waters in extensive bays and sounds, and waters in those regions nearer the shore where there is no harbor for smaller craft to seek refuge during storms must necessarily be made by stanch surveying ships, there is another class of hydrographic surveys that can only be made with special power launches and special equipmentthe wire-drag survey. и This is the only method of making effective surveys where from the soundings with the lead and line the prevailing depths are found to be in excess of the needs of navigation, and yet there may be between the soundings taken with the lead and line an obstruction sticking up from the bottom of the sea to within a few feet of the surface and which would damage or wreck a vessel that struck it. Such an obstruction may be one of the isolated bowlders that are so frequently found in the waters of the coasts of the New England States, or one of the reefs of coral formation adjacent to the coast of southern Florida, Porto Rico, the Hawaiian Islands, Guam, or the Philippine Islands, or it may be one of the needlelike (pinnacle) rocks ('see fig. 10) that stick up to unusual heights (sometimes 400 to ~00 feet) from the bottom of the sea in the waters of southeastern Alaska (see fig. 11). Such obstructions as these, hidden beneath the water, could hardly be found if there were no other means than by sounding for them with a hand lead, if it were known exactly where the obstructions were, and much less would this be probable if a needlelike rock were sticking up from a depth of 407 feet, somewhere in an area 3 miles wide and 6 miles long, snch as the area north of Vank Island at the eastern.end of Sumner Strait in southeastern Alaska. To find these isolated bowlders, coral reefs, and pinnacle rocks the wire drag must be used, which, without going into technical details, is substantially a strand of wire supported in a horizontal position about 30 feet beneath the surface of the water by floats and held down by sinkers, and the whole pulled through the water by power launches. Thus, any obstruction sticking up from the bottom of the ocean less than 30 feet from the surface of the water is caught by the horizontal wire as it is drawn through the water and its J.osition is indicated by the place in the wire where it becomes engage , on much the same principle that a rope if drawn along the ground by two men, one at each end, in a direction at right angles to its length, would be caught on any obstruction sticking above the smooth surface of the ground over which the. rope was dragged, such as a tree stump, and the angle that the rope would form when caught by the tree stump and pulled taut by the men would indicate the position of the tree stump. While this crudely illustrates the main principle of the wire drag, it has been developed into a highly capable and most effi-

The lead line is of little use in charting reбons where the ocean bottom is of this character, for there is little chance that a lead thrown at regular inter\>'als from a moving vessel will strike the summits of these pinnacle rocks. Even if the lead should strike such a pinnacle (pointed rock), it would be likely to glance off and record the greater depth at the base of the rock.

cient instrumentalitv for discovering those isolated bow lders, reefs, and pinnacle rocks that elude the efforts to find them with the lead and line. While 30 feet was mentioned as the depth at which the horizontal wire is drawn through the water, it may be adjusted to any desired depth by an ingenious arrangement on the floats to which the vertical strands of wire supporting the horizontal wire are attached. In fact, by close study and by practical experience, every unit that goes to make up a wire drag has been developed to the highest degree of efficiency. To this there is one exception, and this exception is the principal handicap to rapid and economical wire-drag surveys at the present time. This exception is that the Government has not owned the power launches that pull the wire drag through the water, nor has the Coast and Geodetic Survey funds which can be expended for the purchase or construction of suitable launches. There are certain fundamental features requisite so that such a launch will be efficientt and these features are not common to launches that can be rented for making these wire-drag surveys, though the requisites are approximated as nearly as those available for hire will permit. Pleasure launches, while they have the speed, are too frail of construction to stand the strain of pulling the wire drag (which in certain regions and under certain conditions is most economically operated up to a length of 12,000 feet). A launch that has not sufficient power may, if caught in a storm with the drag extended so that it must be cared for, become a menace to the safety of the lives of the officers and men in the :party. The launches used by the fishermen generally have Elufficient power bnt lack proper speed. When it is remembered that to insure a through survey some of the areas that must be covered by the wire drag in southeastern Alaska are considerably exposed, and that at the close of each day's work the wire drag must be taken up and the party must proceed in the power launches to some harbor of refuge for the night, it will be evident that speed is a very important factor because time lost in traveling to and from the fields of operations in a slow launch is time lost from making surveys, and while this seems a small factor a close scrutiny of every detail of efficient operations reveals that the loss accruing during an entire season, considering this phase alone, totals an amount that is worthy of serious consideration. While it is impossible to reach the ideal in speed and power in procuring rented launches for making these surveys, even if this were attainable, to make them at all useful for making wire-drag surveys, there must be a certain amount of reconstruction on any rented launch. Auxiliary gasoline engines must be installed for operating the reels that carry the wire drag when not in operation. Proper provision must be made for stowing buoys, floats, and sinkers, and in some instances where the party must live on the launches, as in Alaskan waters, housing guarters must be built on the launches. 'fhis is an expensive and time-consuming operation in the preparation for a season's work, and at the close of the season the launch must be restored to the owner in its original condition. This cost approximates $800 per party for each season. This conditibn should be remedied by the Government owni11g the power launches that are necessary to propel the wire drags. Every

other unit of the ;re drag has been developed to the highest degree of perfection, anu eXJ>"T'ience has shown exactly what is needed in a suitable wire-drai! launch, and the time is now ripe for the construction of launChes to meet exact conditions. The resulting economy in accomplishments and overhead charges saved in altering and restoring rented launches must far outweigh their cost. While the results have been highly practical, the work with the wire drag in the past has been necessarily somewhat experimental, but the point has been reached now where it is definitely known what can be accomplished with the wire-drag survey, how it should be accomplished, and (with the exception of Alaskan waters, where, as I have pointed out earlier in this report, some of the areas lack even reconnaissance surveys) it is known what areas require the wire-drag surveys. There is another important feature in connection with these power launches, and that is that when the season or conditions do not permit their being used in making wire-drag surveys, they can be employed in carrymg on inshore hydrography, a class of work which is waiting to be done in many important localities and for which proper vessels are not always available for hire.

The above table gives particulars regarding the principal areas where wire-drag surveys have been made and must be made, but there are many smaller localities where examinations must be made and have been made with the wire drag (such as San Francisco Harbor) and extensive water areas where the wire-drag surveys must eventually be made (such as the coral-reef-infested waters of the Philippines, Hawaii, and Guam) but for which the facilities in personnel and equipment are not now available, and therefore they are not here considered. NoTE.-In the sundry civil bill for 1919 there is an item of appropriation of funds sufficient to construct four wire-drag launches. Every possible step is being taken to have these constructed at the earliest practicable moment, and when they are put into the field it is certain that the results will demonstrate the economy of providing a highly efficient instrument for the accomplishment of a special class of work.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
ENLISTMENT OF SEAMEN.

21

Mention has been made of the fact that the three vessels available for surveys in Alaskan waters were necessarily forced to lie idle in ~eattle during most of the fiscal year, the Emplorer and Taku being in the field but a month each and the Patterson less than three months, and that this was necessarily so because of the lack of officers and the difficulty of enlisting seamen to man the vessels. The causes that lead to this state of l\ffairs are many, and while the results have not been so manifest during normal times, yet, even then matters were not going in the harmonious way that was desirable, but during the stress of war, where conditions are abnormal, and an important arm of the Government service is crippled, the need of some remedial measures is keenly felt. An inquiry into the causes of these conditions leads to a diversity of considerations. I have already made mention of the fact that employment on a vessel of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is considered with little favor by seamen. Employment may be continuous on a merchantrnarine vessel, while it is but for the surveying season on a Coast and Geodetic Survey vessel on the Pacific coast with the certainty that at the close of the surveying season his employment terminates for months. Further, that the duties required of a seaman on a rnerchant vessel are less exacting than on a Coast and Geodetic vessel, and that a seaman on a merchant-marine vessel receives overtime pay for overtime work which is impracticable on a Government vessel. While the foregoing are, in a measure, results, the cause of these conditions may be summed up as follows: The vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey that have been employed on Alaskan surveys are old. The quarters on these vessels for the crews are of the type found in such old vessels and uninviting. They are devoid of modern equipment, and the ordi╗ary comforts are not possible. For this reason they are shunned by the better class of seamen who can command employment on modern vessels. As a consequence of their age and unseaworthiness, these vessels ~an not be employed in open and exposed waters. Therefore, during the winter season they must tie up and undergo repairs. The result is that the crews must be discharged during the winter months and new crews enlisted at the beginning of the succeeding summer season. This enlistment is no more than a civil contract, and since a seaman is not usually possessed of means there is no way of effectually binding him. Hence, with the fluctuating wages that were being paid when the Patterson and Emplorer reached the field of oper11tions in Alaskan waters in 1917 and the seamen found that the wages ashore or on the cannery vessels were much in excess of }!hat ther were receiving, though they had signed a contract of enlStment m Seattle at what was conceded to be a fair wage for the season, they deserted the surveying vessels for employment elsewhere, and there were not funds available for the Coast and Geodetic Survey to meet this competition. Due to the fact that there was no Alaskan Port where new crews could be recruited, there was nothing for the officers of the vessels to do but to close the surveying season and

22

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

return the vessels to Seattle as best they could. The matter has been given serious consideration, but it is doubted if a civil contract can be drawn that will effectually hold seamen who enlist under such a contract on a vessel at Seattle and immediately desert when the vessel reaches an Alaskan port. This being so, there is no known way to prevent seamen enlisting only for the purpose of getting to another port, as the only penalty that can be inflicted is a forfeiture of wages earned, and since it is only four 9-Jys' run from 8eattle to Ketchikan, the wages lost by the seaman~. insignificant in comparison with the cost of transportation, and if they desert in numbers as in the cases cited, nothing remains to be done but to suspend operations and bring the vessels to their home ports, because the demands, industrial and otherwise, that have enticed the seamen from the surveying vessels have already called forth every available man in the locality, and there is no possibility of recruiting new crews. It is believed that there is a permanent solution of this difficulty that is bound to result in highly increased efficiency and ultimately in great economy, though it involves an increased initial expenditure of Government funds and a somewhat radical departure from present methods. It is perfectly evident that the highest degree of efficiency can never be attained in a sPrvice where the duties that its seamen are called upon to perform are sufficiently different from those performed by ordinary merchant seamen to require special training and instruction covering months before the seamen become proficient, when such seamen are only employed for the surveying season of some six or seven months, discharged, and an entirely new crew recruited when the vessel goes to the field the succeeding season. Attention has been called to the need for additional snrYeys of the waters contiguous to Washington, Oregon, and California. The remedy suggested is this: 1. That surveying vessels be provided of a type sufficiently stanch to make surveys in Alaskan waters during the summer months and in the exposed waters of Washington, Oregon, and California during the winter months. 2. That the appropriations for manning the vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey be increased so that a standard wage can b9 paid the seamen on the vessels of this service throughout the year. 3. That authority be granted to enlist seamen for service in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for a period of one year that will be binding upon them during the period of the enlistment as are enlistments in the Navy. . From such an arrangement benefits are bound to accrue to both the seamen and the Government. Employment :for seamen will be continuous under conditions that are agreeable, the Government will have trained complements of men on its vessels :familiar with the more or less intricate details of making surveys, and will be able to draw to the service competent and suitable seamen who will have before them prospects of continuous service and advancement in pay where good conduct merits it, and, what is most important, surveys that are of vital importance to the protection of life and property will be accelerated_far in excess of possible accomplishment under present conditions.

RETIREMENT FOR COMMISSIONED OFFICERS.

23

From year to year in the annual reports of the Coast and Geodetic Survey mention has been made of the need of some system of retirement in order to bring about the maximum of results with the greatest economy. The Coast and Geodetic Survey is the oldest scientific Bureau of the Federal Government, and naturally the evils attendant on superannuation are quite apparent. In the hearings before the Appropriation Committee of the House of Representatives, in February, 1917, in summing up the situation regarding the Coast and Geodetic Survey the Superintendent said:
We have to-day this condition: We have in the neighborhood of 20 men, employees of the Coast Survey, who are between 66 and 82 years old. A great many of those men were In authority two years ago. They were not able Physically to carry the big load which was evidently necessary, if the real Work was to be done. I have changed this the best I could by reducing them to positions where the salaries are more commensurate with the duties which they can and are performing and which their physical condition will permit ; but you can see again that it would be better to have half as many younger men, for then we would get more work done. But, I ask, what is going to be done with them? They have served the Government faithfully ; some of them had gone into the Goveru111ent at 18 or 20 years of age, and they have worked for the Government throughout their lives. Their education is similar to the education of nn Annapolis or \Vest Point graduate, as far as civil engineering ls concerned. They hnve pnld their own tuition; they have stayed with the Survey all their 11 ves at modest salaries ; and now in their declining years they practically have no money. The Survey is really loaded with a portion of the force that is not returning the value it should, though not through its fault. I only speuk of this to show another factor in the condition thut has existed as an obHtacle In the sense that we are handicapped in accomplishing everything we should with the positions that exist as shown, in fact, in the Book of Estimates. I have often thought that it would be well for the Survey if the committee could spend a short time in our office and see what has been accompl!shed and how conditions have changed through a century, and how an old Bureau suffers from superannuation, tradition, and, I might say, dry rot. They would see Why something modern, something new, creates a natural interest among the Public, and will therefore command a greater amount of interest and respect; and that Is what we have right there.

In justice to these officers whose efforts and highest ambitions throughout their associations with the Coast and Geodetic Survey have been along the lines of scientific work peculiarly requisite to the Purpose of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, but which have not provided a competence for old age, legislation providing for their retirement should be enacted. The commissioned officers in the Coast and Geodetic Survey now number 124. Of these 10 are more than 64 years of age, and have had an average service of over 44 years in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Sixteen are more than 60 years old, and have had an average service of 42 years in this Bureau. To retire those above 64 years of age on three-fourths pay would have required but an appropriation of $16,650 for the current year, and would have opened the way to bring into the service 10 new field officers whose services are sorely needed. The fact that the pay these officers have received during the years thhat they have been identified with the Coast and Geodetic Surve)" as been too small to permit laying aside a covipetence for old age is not, however, the principal consideration in urging retirement for

24

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDE~T, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

them. The stronger reason is the privations endured and the risks incident to the service. The surveys that are made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey ought to, and generally do, precede commerce, and not infrequently civilization. The small surveying vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey must enter, explore, and survey unknown waters in advance of commerce, in advance of the vessels of the Navy, the Coast Guard, and all other vessels. The hydrographic parties of the Bureau must go into unexplored waters and make examinations that the commerce that follows may be safe. In the execution of this work these parties are cut off from communication and intercourse with civilization for weeks and even months at a time, and often in the Philippines are necessarily thrown in direct contact with the uncivilized natives of the tropical forests bordering the ~aters where these hydrographic surveys are made. Indeed, it is not mfrequent that our officers by force of arms must overcome the resistance of these uncivilized tribes to the landing of shore parties for the purpose of erecting signals as a basis for the control of the hydrographic surveys. And, again, it is no safe task, in the tropical jungles of the Philippine Islands, with but a few facilities at hand, to build a triangulation signal station 235 feet high out of native timbers that must be cut from the trees on the spot. (See figs. 12 and 13.) At this writing, one of our young officers of the age when he should be in the prime of life, and who when he came into the service was of strong physique, is in a sanitarium, stricken with disease which can be attributed to no other cause than the exposure to which he was subjected in the field work of this Bureau in the Philippines. The surveying work of this Bureau extends over a wide field. Besides being exposed to the tropical diseases and dangers of the Philippines, its officers have been sent into the desolate Arctic regions in determination of the one hundred and forty-first meridian, the boundary line between Alaska and Canada, and for self-preservation have been forced to assume civil charge of the native Indian population and exercise strict authority to stamp out epidemics of smallpox. In carrying out the work of primary triangulation of any country, triangulation stations to be intervisible must be on the highest promontories, and in mountainous or heavily timbered country much daring is required and considerable risk incurred in the construction of suitable signals. (See figs. 14 and 15.) One of the men engaged on the preparation of the triangulation station shown in figure 15 lost his life. In making hydrographic surveys of Alaskan waters, the officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey have been particularly exposed to dangers. The small surveying vessel is no match for the gales that are common to that country, and it is only through foresight in selecting harbors of refuge and good seamanship that disasters have been averted. While it is not the regular function of the Bureau, its officers play no small part in savmg lives and property. Almost monthly word comes to this office of assistance lent vessels in distress or lives and property saved. The Tahoma of the Revenue-Cutter Service struck an uncharted rock in the North Pacific Ocean, resulting in her total k>ss, and a part of her. crew was only saved by the com-

Pages have been written of their participation in the Civil War in which 55 took an active part in the Army and 48 in the Navy, and While their services are shown to have been highly prized by the testimonials of the military and naval officers under whom they served, they were in the Army and Navy without any status, and, if captured, would not have been accorded the protection of prisoners иof war but would have been subject to execution as spies. Permanent legislation has been enacted authorizing the President to transfer by Executive order to the Army and Navy the officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey as necessity .demands, in effect making the service a military reserve force. In the exercise of this authority 25 commissioned officers have been transferred to the Army and 42 to the Navy. The commissioned officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to be of normal efficiency must be a permanent force. That is to say, the Work of the Bureau is so specialized in particular branches of the field of engineering that the young men that come to the service from universities where they are highly trained in the science of engineering must have a long course of special training by the officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey before they become proficient find render valuable service in carrying on the specialized work of ~he Bureau. Owing, therefore, to this special know ledge and training required, the field engineers of the Bureau must be a permanent staff, and it is only after years of experience and training that they become of the greatest value. It therefore follows that shortly after becoming identified with the Bureau the young engineer must take thought of these things and determine that h~ will cast his lot with the Coast and Geodetic Survey during his professional -career, or, he must early seek other field of service because his engineering work With the Bureau is highly specialized, and Icing training in its parties rather tends to make the engineer less than more fit for successful competition in the broader field of engineering. It therefore follows that those who have been in the service more than a very few Years will, and are devoting their lives to the advancement of this Public service. These, then, are the reasons that justify a claim for retirement for the commissioned officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. и It must certainly promote efficiency in the field force of the Bureau to retire at three-quarters pay those officers who have passed 64 years . of age, and bring into the service young, vigorous officers who can endure the physical hardships incident to the service. In justice to the officers who have risked their lives for years in the h azardous civil branch of the Government service, and who have tahken and are taking an active part in the military services at times "1 ~n the risks incident to such service are greatest, the benefits of retirement which are accorded those permanently in the military serv-

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

ices should be extended to those who go into it while the chances of sacrifice are greatest-namely, in time of war. The following is a concrete and illuminating statement of the record of one of our commissioned officers (hydrographic and geodetic engineers) who has had 47 years of service with the Coast and Geodetic Survey. He was born in 1848. After leaving Dartmoutli with a science degree he entered the service of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1871 with pay at $30 a month and actual living expenses, a continuous service of 47 years. This officer has served the Coast and Geodetic Survey in nearly every State in the Union on practically every class of surveys made by the Bureau at various rates of pay, and his average pay throughout his identification with the Bureau has been $1,815 per annum. He has been in charg-e of parties on triangulation observations, on astronomic observat10ns, on topography, in command of vessels of the Bureau on the Atlantic coast, on the Pacific coast, in Alaskan waters on the original survey of the Yukon delta and approaches, in Philippine waters, where he was in command of the largest vessel of the Bureau for some years; he has made surveys in the arctic regions of Alaska in the determination of the boundary line between Alaska and British Columbia, exploratory surveys in Alaska for the purpose of opening up the country at the time of the rush to the Alaskan gold fields; and he has been the principal surveyor for a commission to determine the site. for a nayJ: yar4 on the Pa?ific coast. In office work he has been chief of a d1v1s1on m the Washmg- и ton office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and in charge of one of the most important stations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey on the Pacific coast, a position of responsibility and requiring a thorough knowledge of all the activities of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The above is a typical example of a number of others that could be cited, where an officer has unselfishly devoted the best years-in fact, all of the producing years--of his life to the advancement of a scientific bureau under conditions of living that have taken him to practically every State in the Union and all the possessions of the United States, have never permitted the establishment of a permanent place of residence or a home, and have necessitated an increased living expenditure which an average salary of $1,815 per annum has barely met.
NEED OF 28 ADDITIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC AND GEODETIC ENGINEERS.

In recognition of the greatest need, 67 commissioned officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey have been relieved temporarily from their duties in the Coast and Geodetic Survey and have gone into active service in the War Department and the Navy Department. This is necessarily curtailing the field accomplishments of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, but the training and experience of these officers are such that they are of much value to the military branches of the Government, and during the national crisis it is far better to utilize the services of such number of them as can temporarily be spared in the Army and Navy than in civil employment with the Coast and Geodetic Survey. While the regular work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is thus curtailed and the energies of those remaining in civil employment

with the Bureau are directed toward accomplishments necessary to the Navy and requested by the Army, it is still proper to consider the needs of the Bureau m the way of field officers to adequately perform the duties that are properly assigned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In the report of the Bureau for 1916 it was urged that 48 additional commissioned officers were needed to properly carry on the field work of the Bureau. In partial recognition of this need, 20 new positions have been granted. While this added personnel has been of great assistance in putting new life into a public service that was languishing, we are yet short 28 officers to put it on a footing so that the commissioned personnel will be sufficient in number to properly take care of the field work. Attention has been invited to the fact that for the purpose of properly safeguarding our new merchant marine closer surveys must necessarily be made of our navigable coastal waters, and this will require an increased commissioned personnel. For years pa_st this Bureau has earnestly urged a closer network of accurately determined control points throughout the United States as the basis for maps of the country. The present military necessity has served to emphasize this need as has nothing in the past, andи the accurately determined positions already fixed by this Bureau, insufficient in number as they are, are serving as a nucleus for preparing mafs of the highest degree of accuracy for the Army. The work o accurately determinmg these positions ought to be taken up vigorously. The results are not ephemeral as some of the results of other surveys must from their very nature be, but a position once accurately determined and permanently marked will ever after serve as a basic control for maps and engineering projects. To push this framework of control points, additional field officers are necessary.

Part II.-WORK AND NEEDS OF THE WASHINGTON OFFICE.

CHAPTER I.
WORK OF THE WASHINGTON OFFICE.

The organization of the Washington office throughout the year, by divisions and sections, was as foJlows: и Division of hydrographic and geodetic engineer in charge of the office: Section of instruments, section of printing and sales, section of library and archives, and section of miscellaneous. Division of geodesy. Division of hydrography and topography: Section of field work, section of field records, section of field equipment, section of coa:".t pilot, and section of tides and currents. Division of charts: Section of drafting, section of engraving, and section of photography. Division of terrestrial magnetism. Division of accounts. The work done by the Washington office during the fiscal year by divisions of the office, was as follows: ' Division of hydrographic and geodetic engineer in charge of the office: The general duties of this division are: The upkeep of the buildings occupied by the Bureau; the designing and repairing of surveying instruments and equipment, and packing and shipping them to the field parties; the printing of the charts issued by the Bureau, and the sale of the charts, coast pilots, and tide tables; the purchase of supplies for the office, for the chart printing work, and for the field ; the care and custody of the original records of field surveys as well as the library of prmted publications kept for the use of the Bureau; the keeping of the records of leave taken by the personnel of the Bureau; and the custody anil accounting for the receipts from the sale of charts and publications sold by the Bureau. In addition to the general routine, special improvements were made by this division as follows: Much apprehension has been felt in the past in view of the known danger of fire that would destroy records that are the results of surveys covering more than 100 years stored in the archives of the Survey. This apprehension is now removed. During the fiscal year an automatic sprinkler and fire-alarm system especially provided for by Congress was installed throughout the buildings occupied by the Bureau_ but with special protect10n for the part of the buildings in which are stored the origmal records and field sheets which are the results of field surveys. The most valuable improvement and progress toward the establishment of efficiency in the office was secured through the installation of an additional modern offset press in the printing plant. The Bureau is now supplied with a modern offset press and

a flat-bed press, and this has provided the means for a much more rapid production of charts of a better quality than it has been previously possible to produce. Without this additional modern press the extraordinary demands for navigational charts by the Army, Navy, and merchant marine under the existing war conditions could not have been met with efficient promptness. In September, 1917, an automatic elevator controlled by push buttons was installed in the printing building, and a runway constructed connecting the second story of the new printing building with the paper room in the old printing building and Butler buildings. These two improvements have greatly facilitated the work. In November a new 57-ihch Oswego paper-cutting machine was installed in the pressroom of the printing office, and in J anuary, 1918, an offset proving press, motor-driven, was installed in the transfer room of the printmg office. The issues of charts for the fiscal year was slightly less than for the previous year, but the issue of coast pilots increased remarkably. (See fig. 16, showing the issue of charts from 1888 to 1918, inclusive, and fig. 17, showing the issue of ,eoast pilots from 1900 to 1918, ii\cl usi ve.) During the year 1,115 instruments, apparatus, tools, etc., were repaired in the instrument shops; 948 instruments, apparatus, tools, etc., were made; and 2,610 instruments were purchased.

Much special investigation that was contemplated lookingи to the improvement of instruments and the designing of new instruments has necessarily been suspended due to the fact that so much time in the instrument section has been devoted to war work. The fact that the country is on a war bas?s has necessitated the purchase of additional supplies to produce the increased output of the Bureau, and this . has placed greater burdens on the purchasing section of the office. The expenditures from appropriations for the office for 1917 were $89,985, while for 1918 they were $120,127. Effort has been made to reduce the volumes in the reference library to actual necessity, and in carrying out this purpose a list of those publications deemed of no further use to the Bureau has been sent to the various departments and selections have been made by a number of the bureaus of the departments, thus reducing those on hand in the library of this Bureau to what are actu.ally needed. Sixty-one hydrographic, 44 topographic sheets, and 3,552 field, office, and observatory records were received during the year and filed in the archives. и The total number of permanent and temporary employees in the field and office, excluding hands, etc., not appointed through civilservice certification, was:

The average number of days of annual and sick leave taken by the combined field and office force was 19 and the average number of days of sick leave taken by the combined field and office force was less than 4-!. The overtime service performed by the employees of the office during the fiscal year amounted to 1,438 days, or approximately 7 days for each employee. The receipts from the sale of charts, publications, old property, etc., amounted to $21,622.96.
DIVISION OF GEODESY.

The most important pieces of work which were completed during the past fiscal year or which were in progress during that time are the following : Computation and adjustment of the following pieces of triangu.. lation:
1. In Maryland. 2. In Rhode Island. 3. In Massachusetts. 4. Utah-Washington arc of primary trlangnlntlon. 5. Pasquotank River, N. C. 6. Ninety-eighth meridian south, connecting with the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. 7. Laguna Madre, Tex. 8. Tampa Bay, Fla. 9. Rio Grande arc of primary triangulation. 10. Atlanta-Griffin, Ga., primary triangulation.

The computation of tables for constructing a 1: 10,000,000 base !fial? for the United States on the Lambert zenithal equal area proJect1on. During the year, the computation of 3,517 kilometers of precise leveling was completed at an average cost of 21 cents per kilometer. The introduction of new methods in the computations, the elimination of minor corrections whose effect upon the final elevations of the bench marks proved to be negligible, and the introduction of the adding machine as a recording device in the field work has reduced the cost of computing until now it has reached a figure 40 per cent lower than the average cost from 1909 to 1916, and 6 per cent lower than the average cost previous to 1909.
DIVISION OF HYDROGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY.

The office work of this division has been the supervision of the hydrographic and topographic work on the coasts of the United States and insular possessions; the vessels of the Survey, including their construction, maintenance, repair, equipment, personnel, and office records; the field stations, including the office of the Director of Coast Surveys, at Manila; the completion in the office of the field records of the surveys; the compilation of the coast pilot in the field and office; and the tide and current work of the Survey, including the compilation of the tide tables. Orders and instructions for the personnel and parties engaged in the above-named work, and the necessary correspondence, have been prepared in the division of hydrography and topography. The division includes five sections, namely: Field work, field records, vessels and equipment, coast pilot, and tides and currents. During the year there were data collected and itemized memoranda prepared for 20 sets of instructions for field work. This embraces a careful study of the existing surveys, the nature of the bottom, the reviewing of reports upon previous work, and the required closeness of the work needed to obtam a comprehensive survey of the locality in question. Original field sheets covering areas where changes frequently occur and where preliminary surveys only have been made were reviewed, in order to formulate plans for performing the field work necessary to briner the charts up to date. As tfine permitted, completed field sheets were reviewed in the section preparatory to recommending them for the Superintendent's approyaJ. Thrre we're 90 hydrographic sheets closely mspected, and memoranda bearing on the work were prepared for insertion in the descriptive report accompanying each sheet. During the year the coast pilot section carried onи field work on the North Atlantic coast, and as a result of the field work two coast pilots, Atlantic Coast Pilot, Section A, from Eastport, Me., to Cape Cod, and Atlantic Coast Pilot, Section B, from Cape Cod to Sandy llook, were compiled. Numerous chart corrections collected during the course of the field work were submitted. The above volumes complete the issue of all coast pilots on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States and of Alaska in the new octavo form.

32

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Reprints were obtained dl.U'ing the year of Atlantic Coast Pilots, parts 1, 2, 3, and 4, Sections C and D. Supplements for five volumes and such correction sheets as were necessary to keep the information in all volumes up to date were issued. The Tide Tables for 1918 were received from the printer in September, 1917. These tables are similar to those of the preceding year, but full predictions are given for four additional ports, namely Savannah, Ga. ; Anchorag~ Cook Inlet, Alaska; Cebu, P. I. ; and Port Hedland, Australia. The standard port of Amboy, China, has been discontinued, leaving 81 stations for which full predictions are given. Some other minor changes were made to make the volume more useful to navigators. The manuscript of the Tide Tables for 1919 was prepared and submitted for printmg in three separate parts as follows: The manuscript of the Atlantic Coast Tide Tables was prepared and submitted in advance, before the other portions of the General Tide Tables had been predicted; then the Pacific Coast Tide Tables were prepared and submitted for printing; and last of all what remained of the General Tide Tables was prepared and submitted. This arrangement is convenient to carry out, and under peace conditions will greatly expedite the early receipt of the volumes for issue. The Italian Government requested this Survey to furnish predicted tides for Venice, Italy, for the two years, 1918 and 1919, which was done. The government of Western Australia was furnished with copies of the proof sheets of the predicted tides for Port Hedland, Australia, for the two years, 1918 and 1919. The computations for the graduation of the scales of the new form of sounding tube was completed in this section, and also the corrections to be applied for variations in the height of the barometer and for changes in the temperature of air and water.
DIVISION OF CHARTS.

The following statistics show the accomplishments of this division in the way of drafting, engraving, and photographic work for the past year, as well as the accomplishments for 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917:

DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

The results of the _field work executed during 1917 were computed and prepared for publication. The reduction of the work of the five magnetic observatories for 1916 was completed, and the results for 1915-16 were prepared for publication. The reduction of the observatory work for 1917 was Well advanced for each of the observatories. The earthq\]akes recorded at the five magnetic observatories have been tabulated monthly, and the results have been published in the Monthly vVeather Review and transmitted to the International Seismological Association and others engaged in a comparative study of earthquake data. An isogonic chart of New England for 1918 was prepared for the use of the Geological Survey. A table giving the value of the mngnetic declination at numerm;.s places in the United States for 1918 was prepared for insertion in the World Almanac. Revised tables pertaining to terrestrial magnetism were prepared :for a new edition of the Smithsonian Physical 'tables. Some progress was made in the reduction of the work of the San Antonio Observatory, 1890-1895. The card catalogue of the field results was very nearly completed. Proof has been read of the following publications which have been sent to the printer during the year:

The weakest units in the series of operations through which information is gathered from original surveys and 'issued to the public in the form of printed charts, coast pilots, tide tables, etc., is the lack of a suffioient number in certain classes of personnel in the Washington office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. This lack of personnel has caused the flow of this information to become stagnant so that there are accumulations of data in the office from ori~inal field surveys that can not be passed on to the public in the prmted output of the Bureau before some of it becomes antiquated, and even superseded in some changeab1e areas by later surveys because the personnel of the Bureau that handles phases of this output is not sufficient in number to cope with it. Stated in the order of the Bureau's present requirements, the classes of personnel where relief is urgently needed are as follows: (1) DI_:aftsmen, (~) computers, and ( 3) clerks.
DRAFTSMEN.

The term "draftsmen" as applied to the employees of the Coast and Geodetic Survey who compile the charts is a misnomer. The' mechanical drawing of the characteristics shown on the published chart is by far the least exacting of any duties of the force engaged on this work. The more serious problem is the examination of the mass of data from all sources, some of which are unquestionably accurate, other of doubtful reliability, and still others that may or may not be accurate, and out of these draft a chart that truly represents conditions. To be more explicit, the following are a few things that confront our men engaged on this work. Say a new edition of a chart of an important waterway is being drawn. The man compiling the information for this new edition of a chart has before him the old edition of the chart, the original field sheet of the surveys of the locality made 60 years ago, an original field sheet of an examination made m search of a reported danger in the locality made 5 years ago, an original field sheet of a resurvey made 20 years ago, some hundreds of blue prints of examinations made by the Corps of Engineers in different localities at different times for years past over the area covered by the chart, maps, and blue prints made by State authorities, by municipal authorities, and by county authorities of various areas covered by the chart, numerous reports made b;y the Bureau of Lighthouses regarding the changes in locations of aids to navigation, and reports by the Coast Guard of the location of wrecks and dangers to navigation. From this mass of material and information must be determined the data that shall go on a new edition of a chart. These surveys made by different agencies and at different times may not be consistent one with the other in positions given for dangers located,

depths, or aids to navigation, or they may overlap and show inconsistent depths. In compiling this information for the purpose of printing a chart due regard must be given the object in view when the survey was made, for it is obvious that if soundings are made by the Corps of Engineers to determine the depths obtained in dredging .a channel, then incidental scattered soundings made of adjacent waters, overlapping and inconsistent with closer surveys made at other times, may or may not be accurate as to conditions where these scattered soundings are made, yet these made in the channel are the last word as to accuracy as to the depths of the channel. Therefore, to take this mass of miscellaneous information and prepare an accurate chart requires far more than mere ability to draft, and the man engaged on such work in the Coast and Geodetic Survey is more than a draftsman in the sense in which the word is commonly used. And, even in the mere matter of drafting, the new appointee of the Bureau, fresh from school is deficient in that the lettering and symbols which are later to be reproduced by photolithography from original drawings on vellum must be of'the highest degree of accmracy and neatness, to be issued in the form of a finished product as a chart, and this is farи beyond the capabilities of those who come to the Bureau fresh from school. While the need of the military services has drawn from this Bureau some of its best and most experienced draftsmen, and while others are on temporary leave of absence undertaking work in connection with the war at the direct request of the President, this has only emphasized a condition that has existed for years, namely, that there is and has been a great mass of information in the form of results of ori~inal surveys by this; Bureau, surveys by the Corps of Engineers, mformation from the Bureau of Lighthouses, and from other sources that has not and can not be applied to the charts of the Bureau at the time the information is current, because there is not the necessary force of cartographers to digest the information and apply it as fast as it comes to the office. Because of the high attainments require!i of those engag-ed on this work, the salaries should be higher than at present, especially in the lower grades. -Indeed, if the positions are to be filled and conditions continue as at present these salaries must be increased because candidates can not be found to fill them. Some of the lower-paid positions have been vacant for months.
.COMPUTERS.

The services of computers are required and used in three divisions of this office : 1. In the division of geodesy in the computation of the results of geodetic surveys. и 2. In the division of hydrography in making computations for the annual tide tables and d1scusflion 0░f current data. 3. In the division of terrestrial magnetism in the computations of the field and observatory observations and the discussion of the results therefrom. While conditions are not as bad in these divisions and the masses of data from field observations, etc., are not so great as those before our draftsmen, yet there are many folios of results of field observa-

38

tions (geodetic, tidal, and magnetic) in our archives containing information that can only be effectively presented for public use in printed form that have not been reached by the computing force, and can not be reached for too long a time. и 1. Nature of work.-The work done by the computers is technical in character, requiring thorough training, extensive research, continuous study, sound judgment, and expert accuracy, as shown by the character of the publications prepared under their direction. It involves the joining on of new work to old or the fitting together of the work of several seasons, and thus makes the information acquired by years of experience a very important factor in the efficiency of a computer. 2. Importance of the work.-It is es:pecially important at this time to prevent any falling off of the quantity or quality .of the output of the Survey because of the large amount of work bemg done for the Army and Navy. About 90 per cent of the time of the computers of the division of geodesy is now devoted to war work, and the demands from the office of the Chief of Engineers are so urgent that that office has authorized the employment of five temporary computers to help out the regular force. и With the present scale of salaries it is not possible to secure new computers of the required training and ability nor to hold the old computers whose value has been enhanced by experience in the work. Of the entire force (authorized) of 31 computers, there are only 6 now in the service who were here at the beginning of 1907. In the division of geodesy, to which 22 of the computers were assigned, there are now only 2 who were there in 1907. Twelve places are either vacant or filled by temporary appointees. Recently four men took the examination and all four men were offered positions. One of these wanted $2,000, another $1,700 as an entrance salary, and the other two refused the' posftion. The circular announcing the examination was sent to all the leading colleges in the country. One college president wrote to the Survey stating that it was impossible to induce the graduates to accept the computer positions, which required such thorough training and paid such small salaries. During the last few years, ev~ry one whose name was on the register of eligibles has b~n offered a position. It is impossible with the present salaries to secure and retain computers qualified to perform efficiently the work of this Bureau. It is recommended, therefore, that a readJustment of salaries be made so as to make their average pay more nearly conform to present conditions and to that paid for similar service in other branches of the Government. и The scales of salaries of examiners in the Patent Office and of associt..te physicists and assistant physicists in the Bureau of Standards are not much different from those proposed for the computers. The entrance requirements for the Patent Office are of the same grade as for computer in this Bureau, as evidenced by the fact that a large number of computers have left this Bureau from time to time to go to the Patent Office. иThere has recently been a call for computers in the Ordnance Department, the requirements being substantially the same as for com!JUters in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the salaries ranging from

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

39

$1,400 to $1,800 a year. For master computer, with additional req_uirements of at least two years of experience in engineering or snnilar pursuits, salaries ranging from $1,800 to $2,400 a year are offered.
CLERKS.

While the flow of information from the raw material as gathered from field observations to the perfected printed output in the form of charts, tide tables, and geodetic publications is materially retarded through the lack of a sufficient number of draftsmen and computers, as pointed out above, the smooth working of an efficient orgamzation is further handicapped through another shortage in that the Bureau has not a sufficient number. and a stable force of clerks. Relatively it is more important that an additio.nal number of draftsmen and computers be supplied than of cl~rks because the information that passes through the hands of the former goes to the public in the form of a printed product that is equally available to all and therefore has a broader field of service, yet we are far from able to meet as promptly and fully as is desirable the many requests that come to this office for special information for individuals, Gov,ernment officials, shipJ?ing interests, etc., because we have not the proper number of experienced clerical employees to properly -collate the data to supply this information. This Bureau in relation to its clerical force has a few parallels in the Government service. The work of the Bureau is specialized. The clerical force is not large ( 42 in number). No two clerks in the Bureau have duties that are exactly similar, and the duties of many are highly technical. From this it follows that when a vacanc:y occurs in the clerical force the new appointee is assigned to duties which are different from any clerical experience he has ever had before, and there is no other clerk in the division to which he is assigned to assist him to acquire a knowledge of his duties. He acquires this information only at the expense of a great loss of time of the chief of the division where he is assigned, who must instruct him in the details of the work. Consequently frequent changes in the clerical force of this Bureau not only hinder the prompt supplying of the individual inquiries of the public but actually retard the technical work of the Bureau. Owing to the disparity between the lower statutory salaries in this иBureau and those paid m other branches of the Government service, the changes in the clerical personnel of the Bureau are in excess of the average in other branches of the Government service. The statutory ~alary of 50 per cent of the clerical force of the Bureau is not in excess of $1,000 per annum. There are 42 clerks in the Bureau. The statutory salaries of 21 are as fo11ows: Six at $720 per annum, 10 at $900 per annum, and 5 at $1,000 per annum. The result was that during the fiscal year no less than 27 persons occupied 5 of the statutory places at $720 per annum and 33 persons occupied the 10 statutory places for clerks at $900 per annum. The general average has been that these positions have been held by clerks somewhat less than three months, there being many intervals When candidates could not be found willing to accept such salaries. . The bare facts are that while the Government has really paid from its salary rolls a minimum price for clerical help, it has lost a large

40

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

amount of time of highly skilled technical employees who have instructed during one year each of these 60 different incumbents of different clerical positions, and the net result has been a financial loss far in excess of proper salaries that would retain a permanent force of experienced clerks.
INSTRUMENT MAKERS.

There is another need in the office personnel that, however, has a direct effect on field accomplishments, and that is an increased number of and higher entrance salary for instrument makers. These must be specially skilled men in the repairing and making of the intricate parts of delicate surveying instruments, such as theodolites, sextants, levels, etc.-men of a much nigher class of attainments than are usually found in quantity productiQn instrument shops of even manufacturers of surveying instruments, because such men are generally skilled only in the production in numbers of special parts of a given instrument, while such employees in the Coast and Geodetic Survey must be able to make necessary parts and repairs to any part of any delicate surveying instrument and with the highest degree of precision, because an inaccuracy in the instrument would bring inaccuracies in the results from surveys made with it. The entrance salary of $1,200 is insufficient to attract men of the requisite experience to fill these positions. It is indeed insufficient to attract men at the present time. One of these positions was created July 1, 1917. It was only after a solicitation by correspondence and personal inquiry covering nearly six months that an incumbent was found, an<l another of the $1,200 positions has been vacant for months. We are unable to induce any one with any degree of mechanical ability to accept an appointment to fill the vacancy.
RETIREMENT FOR EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN COMMISSIONED OFFICERS.
'

In the chapter of the "Needs of the field service" attention has been called to the need of legislation authorizing the retirement of commissioned officers of the field force 64 or more years old who have devoted the producing years of their liyes to the interest of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at rates of pay that have not permitted the accumulation of a competence for old age. Retirement for these old officers has been earned and is merited in view of the hazards and perils through which they have passed and which have been incident to the field service of the Coast and Geodetic Survey .. There is, however, another class of employees m the Coast and Geodetic Survey, in common with many other branches of the Government service, for whom retirement for :those who have become superannuated on some sort of civil pension should be provided, and this class wmprises the different civil employet!s of the Bureau. Consequent on the fact that the Coast and Geodetic Survey is a very old branch of the Government service (it having recently rounded out a century of activity) it has on its rolls civil employees who ha Ye reached the ages when they should be retired on account of superannuation. The matter of retirement of civil employees in the Government service has bee.n agitated for years in this country, and while retire-

41

ment of superannuated employees under varying conditions and at various rates of pay is in effect in many foreign countries, the principle has not been acted upon in this country except to a limited extent ir. a few services. It is not urged that the Coast and Geodetic Survey is on any different status from other governmental branches in this respect so as to entitle it.s employees to special consideration, but from the fact that it is such an old service it has on its rolls a considerable number of employees who have reached such ages that their abilitities are impaired and they should be retired. Their pay has been so small and the cost of living has been such that iБ their salaries ceased they become dependent. The work of the Bureau would be greatly accelerated if there were some general provision for the retirement of the.employees of the Coast and Geodetic Survey who have reached ages when they can not keep pace with the needs of the Government.
PROPER HOUSING FOR THE EFJ<'ICIENT OPERATION OF THE BUREAU.

Year by year mention has been made of the fact that the operation of the Bureau is fettered and restrained because of the handicap of quarters that restrict at every turn the fullest accomplishments. It is not feasible and practicable to try to make an old hotel building into an office where employees can be grouped under proper supervision and where machinery for printing charts, manufacturing and repairing surveying instruments, electrotyping copper plates, etc., can be properly installed. The limitations in size of rooms, rooms supplying proper light, sufficient number of rooms, communication between employees who have work in common and must consult common records and yet can not be grouped in one part of the building or even on the same floor of the building are иrestrictions that seriously retard the output of the Bureau. Too~oisy machinery must be installed in rooms contiguous to those in wli!bh are specialists engaged on work requiring the closest concentration, and the best of results can never be obtained. и However it is recognized that with the immense burden of expense which the Government is bearing now it is no time to insist upon the expansion of these expenditures in the construction of a new building. Yet, these are con({itions that in the interest of ultimate economy should be remedied at the earliest feasible moment.

CHAPTER III.
WAR WORK OF THE COAST AND-GEODETIC SURVEY.

On May 22, 1917, an act was approved "to temporarily increase the commissi0ned and warrant and enlisted strength o:f the Navy and Marine Corps, and for other purposes." By section 16 of this act the field.officers o:f the Coast and Geodetic Survey, then under the designation o:f assistants and aids, were directed, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. to be commissioned as officers in the Coast and Geodetic Survey under designations therein specified. By this same act the President was authorized "whenever in his judgment a sufficient national emergency exists to transfer to the service and jurisdiction of the War Dei;>artment and the Navy Department such vessels, equipment, stations, and personnel o:f the Coast and Geodetic Survey as he may deem to the best interest of the country." Provision is also made for the return to the Coast and Geodetic Survey of such vessels, equipment, stations, and personnel v. hen such emergency ceases in the opinion of the President. In the exercise of this authority, the President issued an Executive order on September 24, 1917, by which the following vessels and the personnel thereon were transferred to the service and jurisdiction of the Navy Department: S'llrveyor, Bache, and Isis. And on May 16, 1918, another Executive order was issued transferring the foflowing vessels and the personnel thereon to the service and jurisdiction of the Navy Department: Patterson (temporarily renamed U. S.S. Forward} and Ewplorer. On March 16, 1918, at the request of the Secretary of War, the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was granted "l~ave of absence" from his duties in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and commissioned in the War Department.
OFFICERS OF THE SURVEY ON MILITARY DUTY IN THE WAR AND NAVY DEPARTMENTS.

By Executive order of September 24, 1917, and others of subsequent dates, officers and employees of this Bureau were transferred to and commissioned in the War Department and the Navy Department.

The total personnel from the Coast and Geodetic Survey m the War Department and the Navy Department is as follows:
In the War Department: ' Commissioned officers (Coast and Geodetic Survey commissions)_____ 25 Other officers------------------------------------------------------ 26 Men-------------------------------------------------------------- 58 Total----------------------------------------------------------- 109 In the Navy Department: Commissioned officers (Coast and Geodetic Survey commissions)______ 42 Other officers-------------------------------------.----------------- 10 Men -------------------------------------------------------------- 79 Total----------------------------------------------------------- 131

This total of 240 members from the Coast and Geodetic Survey ib the military branches is 30 per centи of the entire personnel of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The energies of the personnel remaining with the Coast and Geodetic Survey have been directed almost wholly to the assistance of ~he military branches of the Government. Practically all the partie~ in the field on geodetic work have been for the purpose of securing results requested by the War Department, and many special confidential surveys have been made by the hydrographic parties for the Navy Department. . ' In the Washington office of the Bureau attention has been given tt. the needs of the military branches for which special computations h.ave been made and special maps and charts produced. Much of the tune of the instrument shops has been devoted to repairing sextant!!! !\nd instruments needed by the Navy Department and to the desi~и ing and perfection of new instrnments and devices for the imlitary authorities. A notable production by the Bureau for the mili~~ authorities is a treatise on the Lambert Conformal Projection . .a.ms is the projection on which the battle maps in France are based. There was no satisfactory treatise in existence, not even in French,

44

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
I

with which to meet the large and constant demand for information concerning it for Army officers and others interested in war maps, and to supply this need the treatise was prepared in this office. The demand for it has been large, especially from the Army. The officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey who have remained with the Bureau have acted in an advisory capacity on many military commissions, boards, etc. The officers who have not been transferred and the other employees who have not become identified with the Army or Navy, remaining with the Coast and Geodetic Survey1 both at the Washington office and in the field, are performing duties that are identical, as far as importance is concerned, with the military forces that are both on land and sea. и From the f a~t that the Coast and Geodetic Survey is an arm of the Government which is now contributing its entire efforts in war activities, it will be readily appreciated that it is as necessary to have a sufficient number of the personnel remaining with this Bureau, so as to keep it effi.cientl;r active. There are men m this Bureau who feel that they should be at the :front. It has been most difficult to discriminate in transferrin~ some to the Army and some to the Navy, and others having to remain at home. However, it should be clearly understood and certain!) bring a large amount of satisfaction of mind to those who have remained in the Bureau and have simply been held here because their services are indispensable and their work bears exactly the s11me importance in connection with the war as those services are literally utilized at the :front.
RECENT LEGISLATION ENACTED AFFECTING THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

The :following is a summary of legislation contained in the sundry civil act of ,July 1, 1918, affecting the Coast and Geodetic Survey: Among the important pieces of enabling legislation :for the Bureau is the authorization of the payment of not to exceed $1 a day as extra compensation to employ'ees of the different stationi; of the Lighthouse Service while observing tides or currents. Lightships are peculiarly well situated in positions where it is desirable to collect tide andиcurrent data, but such observations are not part of the duty o:f the Bureau of Lighthouses and in the past could not justly be imposed on the light keepers of that Bureau without some additional compensation, and the appropriations for the Coast and Geodetic Survey could not be expended to recompense them for such additional duties without this authorization. From the results of data collected by lightships it is expected that predictions can be made which will be of direct benefit to navigators and go far toward saving many yessels from loss through inadequate knowledge of the direction and strength of the ocean currents. . This act also authorized the Bureau to purchase supplies or procure services in the open market in the manner common among business0men where the amount of the purchase does not exceed $50. Instances are numerous in the past where the necessity of securing competitive bids fo:r small items have materially delu.yed the progress of

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

45

field work, and such required procedure has actually cost the Governrnent more than the value of the article purchased. Other items are the authorization of the running of lines of precise levels in the int~rior of Alaska; the employment of draftsmen in the Preparation of plans and specifications for vessels; and the reimbursement under rules prescribed by the Secretary of Commerce of officers of the Bureau for food, clothing, medicines, and other supPlies furnished for the temporary relief of distressed persons in rernote localities and to shipwrecked persons temporarily provided for by them. . Three important items of additional appropriation for the Bureau are contained in the act. One is an appropriation of $50,000 for a и ~ew vessel to cost not exceeding $354,000. Another is the appropriation of $50,000 for a new motor-driven vessel, including equipment, to replace the Taku. The Taku was condemned as unseaworthy and sold. The third is for four or more new launches, including their equipment', $62,500. The two new vessels are for much-needed sur"teys of the waters of Alaska, and the launches are for use in wiredrag surveys. In the past launches for these surveys have been procured at a necessarily excessive rental, owing to the fact that they \Vere taken from other industries, and they have been generally unsatisfactory for wire-drag work because they were not especially designed for the purpose. b Provision is made for some additional techpical employees of the .oureau whose services are used in the preparation and production ~!charts issued by the Bureau, and which are so largely used by the .1.~avy Department, vessels of the War Department, merchant marine, and the new vessels being built by the Shippinl! Board.

Part III.-STATEMENT FOR THE PAST YEAR OF ACCOMPLISHED FIELD AND OFFICE WORK, ACCOMPANIED BY ILLUSTRATIONS, 'AS REQUIRE't,BY STATUTE, SHOWING THE PROGRESS MADE, ETC. I\
DIVISION OF HYDROGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY.

The division of hydrography and topography has supervision of the hydrographic and topographic work on the coasts of the United States and insular possessions; the vessels of the Survey, including thefr construction, maintenance, repair, equipment, personnel, and office records; the field stations, including the office of the Director of Coast Surveys, at Manila; the completion in the office of the field records of the surveys. the compilation of the coast pilot in the field and office; and the tide and current work of the Survey, including the compilation of the tide tables. Orders and instructions for ~the personnel and parties engaged jn the above-named work, and the necessary correspondence, are prepared in the division of hydrography and topography. The . division includes five sections, namely, field work, field records, vessels and equipment, coast pilot, and tides and currents. Following is a general statement of the progress of the field and office work. Detailed statements of the work are given in the reports of the chiefs of sections and parties :
MILITARY WORK

During the fiscal year 1918 practically ail of the topographic, hydrographic, and wire-drag work of the Bureau was done at the request of the Navy Department to meet urgent military needs. Work not done at the request of the Navy Department was .undertaken only when its urgent need and importance were determined. The Bureau and its field parties cooperated closely with the Navy Department. At Washington, D. C., frequent consultation andи correspondencs with the various bureaus of the Navy Department were had relative to the work that was requested. In the field, the parties cooperated closely with the local naval commandants1 the commanding officer of the fleet, or other naval authority. Five of the larger vessels of the Bureau, together with their personnel, were transferred to the Navy Department by Executive order. These vessels required but little work to fit them to meet, the needs of the Navy Department after the transfer.
FIELD WORK, ATLANTIC COAST.

The. steamer Bache was at Norfolk repairing and outfitting for field work during July, 1917. At the request of the commandant cf the naval base, Hampton Roads, Va., confirmed by the Secretary of the Navy, the Bache was employed from July 24 to September 23, 1917. on a detailed hydrograph1c and topographic survey of the
46

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

47

naval base, on which should be based very extensive improvements intended at that point. The steamer Isis was repairing at Baltimore, Md., during July and August, 1917. During September the vessel made an mspection trip on the New England coast, by direction of the Secretary of Commerce. On July 1, 1917, the steamer Surveyer was at Portsmouth; N. H., arranging for receiving certain launches and fittings that had been built for that vessel. The vessel then proceeded to Tompkinsville, Norfolk, and Washington, arriving at the last-named place on July 2~. At Washin~on 2 the vessel was inspected by the naval authorities, the surveymg mstrumental outfit was placed on board, and arrangements were made for transferring the vessel to the Navy Department. . On September 24, 1917, the steamers Surveyor, Isis, and Bache, with their complements of officers and men, supplies, ancl equipment, were transferred to the Navy by Executive order, in conformity with law. The steamer Hydrographer completed the comprehensive survey begun the previous year of the entire seacoast Cif Mississippi and Alabama, including during the present fiscal year Mississippi Sound, Mobile Bay, and the seaward approaches. Detached shore parties were organized for this work as soon as practicable after the funds for the fiscal year became available, and these parties were continued while the work was 'in progress. Repairs, including the installation of a new boiler, were made to the vessel at Mobile, Ala., for about one month during the latter part of March and first part of April. . . This survey developed extensive changes from the published charts, which were based on surveys made about 70 years before. 'I'he survey of Mobile Bay was made at the request of the Navy Department and commercial interests, and enables the Bureau to publish an up-to-date chart showing the very extensive commercial development now in progress. и The survey of Mobile Bay was completed at the end of May and the vessel proceeded to Norfolk, Va., arriving on June 13, After a consultation with the commanding officer, instructions were issued for the work in the lower part of Chesapeake Bay, embracing the main channel of the bay and approaches to Hampton Roads, to meet the needs of the Navy Department. At the end of the month signals and tide staffs had been erected and sounding work has been begun. The schooner Matchless completed a comprehensive resurvey of the easterly side of Pamlico Sound from the vicinity of Cape Hatteras to the south end of Roanoke Island. The topography of the inner and outer shore lines of the outerи beach was completed; also the hydrography, with the exception of a strip of the sound about 8 miles long between New River Inlet and Oregon Inlet. . rhe vessel also completed certain surveys previously done by the same vessel in Croatan and Roanoke Sounds. These surveys were made to bring our c;harts up to d~te and also to meet the needs. of the Lighthouse Service. The previous general surveys of the region had been made about 70 years before. и Owing to the very severe winter the M atchles.~ en route from Roanoke Island to Elizabeth City was caught in the ice and held

48

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

from about December 24 to January 17, and was then towed to Elizabeth City. On the 29th she was taken to Norfolk. During February, March, and April the vessel was repaired at Norfolk and outfitted for field woyk. Soundings were made by the vessel to meet the needs of the Navy Department around the coal piers at Newport News and in the Newport News dredged channel in Hampton Roads. During May and June the Matchless was employed in York River on surveys requested by the Navy Department. These surveys included a complete survey of the Mattaponi River from the bar at its entrance to the shipyard at Yorktown i also a verification of the hydrography of the river from Gum Pomt to York Spit Lighthouse. . Wire-d~ag party No. 1 completed the wire-drag survey of the apl'roaches to Portsmouth Harbor, N. H., to meet the needs of the Navy Department. This party cooperated closely with the local naval 9.uthorities, and performed certain special surveys requested by them. The work was continued to September 24, 1917, when certain officers of the party were transferred by Executive order to the Navy Department. и In the spring of 1918 the party out.fitted at Kittery Point, Me., and on May 6 began a survey on the west coast of Block Island to meet the needs of the Navy Department. This special work was undertaken to develop and make safe a submarine trial course, and the work included current observations and soundings over a very considerable area on either side of the trial course and a wire-drag survey for a distance of 2l miles westward from the 10-foot curve on the west side of the island. Along the west side of the south half of the island wire-drag work was extended from the 10-foot curve to a junction with the. wire-drag work previously completed there. Many uncharted bowlders and dangers to navigation were located by this party, and the results of this work were furnished to the Navy Department. The work of this party was delayed by reason of the inability to secure efficient launches for the purpose. Wire-drag party No. 2 surveyed Block Island Sound and the approaches to Narragansett Bay to meet the needs of the Navy 'Department. While employed on this work the party executed a number of special surveys at the request of the Navy Department, including a comprehensive survey of Sakonnet River and a wire-drag survey of certain areas between Bartlett Reef and The Race. The party was disbanded on December 4, 1917. In the sprins of 1918 the party was organized and the launches equipped at W1ckford, R. I., and on April 15 began wire-drag work in Long Island Sound requested by the Navy Department. The first work done by this _party was a comprehensive survey of the trial course off Port Jefferson, L. I., including triangulation leadline hydrography, and a wire-drag survey. From May 7 to 24, inclusive, the part~ was employed from Stonington, Conn., as headquarters, on a wire-drag survey in the east end of Long Island Sound. This party was then transferred to the coast of Mame and arrived on June 1. From July 1 to September 23, wire-drag party No. 5 was engaged on a wire-drag survey of the passage across the Florida Reefs

between Rebecca Shoal Lighthouse and Dry Tortugas, Fla. Freи quent high winds and strong currents, together with inadequately powered launches, interfered seriously with the progress of the work. It havin~ been found impracticable to secure launches for wiredrag work m Porto Rico, wire-drag party No. 5 was organized during the month of June f()r the work in Block Island Sound requested by the Navy Department. At the close of the month the necessary launches had been secured and the party was ready to begin work . . early in the next fiscal year. A shore party was employed froin July 23 to September 24, 1917, on a revision of the triangulation and topo~aphy of the north shore of Long Island from Northport to Kings Park. A party using chartered launches revised the hydrography in the south approaches to Cape Cod Canal from August 1 to September 30, 1917. The party was then transferred to Plymouth Harbor, Mass., to complete the revision of the hydrography in that vicinity. This work was completed on November 15. A party using chartered launches continued a comprehensive tide and current survey, begun the previous fiscal yea.;.; of the easterly half of Long Island Sound eastward from New .Haven. Currents were observed for 51 hours each at important stations in the sound and the principal tributaries. Automatic tide gauges were maintained at selected stations during the work, staff gauges were operated for short periods at numerous other stations, and approved bench marks were established for all stations and connected up with all pre'\"ious work of this character which embraced a number of years' observations. This work was continued until November 3. _ when the party was disbanded. The field revision of Atlantic Coast. Pilot, Section A, which covers the coast from the northeast boundary to Cape Cod, was done between July 13 and October 27, 1917; and that of Atlantic Coast Pilot, Section B, which covers the coast from Cape Cod to New York, was done between July 14 and September 24, 1917. For use as a trial. course for naval vessels, a course 1 mile long was и laid out at Alexandria, Va., in November, 1917. A survey of the Virgin lsiands having been requested by the Navy Department, a party left the office on January 31, 1918, and was employed on triangulation and topographic surveys of the islands for the balance of the fiscal year. This party is cooperating with the naval officials at St. Thomas, and, in addition to the general survey requested by the Navy Department, ~as made a number of small surveys especially requested by the local naval officials. Field stations, each in charge of an inspector who is a field officer of the Bureau, were maintained at Boston from January 7 to June 30, 1918; at New York City during the fiscal year; at Gal~ston from ,July 1, 1917, to January 14, 1918, when the office space was taken over by the District Court; and at New Orleans from March 1 to June 80, 1918. . At each field station there is maintained a stock of charts and other publiootions of the Survey for consultation and for sale. The officer in charge has for his principal duties an inspection of the navigable waters within his district, for the purpose of keeping the charts and other nautical publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey cor~

rected to date and the furnishing of information relativeи to our coasts to the public. The routine duties of the field station are handled by a clerk.и In addition to the inspection duties of the field station, the following special assignments were made to the inspectors during the ;year: The inspector at Boston is a member of the Mississippi River Commission and attended several meetings of the commission during the year. The inspector also made a field examination of the coast between Gloucester and Boston, preparatory to undertaking the field work of making a revision of the triangulation and topography of this locality for use on a large scale chart of this area which is urgently needed, especially of the important harbor of Lynn, Mass. The inspector at New York had charge of the exhibit for' the Bureau at the meeting of the Southern Commercial Congress from October 15 to 17, 1917; also at the National Motor Boat Show held at New York city during the week beginning January 20, 1918. To meet the needs of the Navy Department for the location of certain stations in connection with the Proving Grounds at Sandy Hook2 the inspector at New York executed triangulation along the coast or New Jersey during April and May, 1918. At the request of the United States Engineer's office at Galveston Tex., the inspector of the Bureau at Galveston executed a survey of Brazos Santiago for purposes of improvement. The work comprised triangulation, topography, and hydrography, and was executed from August 7 to 31, 1917. и
FIELD WORK, PACIFIC COAST.

A shore party was employed from July to October, 1917, on a survey begun the previous fiscal year of the triangulation, topography, and hydrography of the important Lake Washington Ship Canal and Duwainish Waterway, which had been recently completed at Seattle Harbor. Field stations of the Survey, each in charge of an inspector who is a field officer of the Bureau, were maintained at San Francisco and Seattle during the year. и Each field station maintained one of the regular tide stations of the Bureau throughout the year, obtaining a continuous record of the time and height of the tide with an automatic tide gauge. The field stat10n at Seattle served as h~adquarters for the field parties operating in Washington and Alaska, and rendered valuable nssistance to the field parties in the purchase of outfit and supplies, repairing the vessels, and securing men. и A field officer of the Bureau began an inspection trip during June along the west coast of the United States, to enable the Bureau to keep in close touch with the conditions of the survey!' on that coast, so that steps can be taken to meet the immediate needs under present conditions. This officer also inspected the chart , agencies of the Bureau on that coast.
FIELD WORK, ALASKA.

The steamer Patterson during the summer of 1917 was employed in southeast Alaska on surveys in the approaches to Cross Sound. The triangulation was extended from Cross Sound southward

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

51

throughи Lisianski Inlet, Lisianski Strait, and the outer coast, to Portlock Harbor, forming an important closure in the loop of triangulation around Chichagof Island. The topography and .hydrography of Lisianski Strait and Inlet were completed. The ship executed offshore hydrography in the westerly approach to Cross Sound for a distance of 27 miles off the coast and extending about 60 miles along the coast. It was not possible to complete this work as fully as intended, but the information thus obtained is an important addition to our information for the use of navigators in this important approach from westward to southeast Alaska. Trouble was had in holding an efficient crew on the vessels for the entire season, and only by shifting a part of the crew from the Ewplorer to the Patterson was it possible to keep the work going. The work was closed on September 23, and after storing the Cosmos and launches at Metlakatla the ship returned to Seattle on October 13. The vessels were laid up in Lake Union with a reduced crew where repairs were made to the vessel. On May 16, 1918, the vessel was transferred to the Navy Department by Executive order. и The steamer Ewplorer during the summer of 1917 was employed in southeast Alaska on a comprehensive survey of the outer coast from Cape Muzon to Meares Passage. Owing to the difficulty of securing and holding a crew for the vessel this work could not be economically prosecuted. The vessel therefore closed work on July 19, and a part of the officers and crew were transferred to the steamer Patterson. The vessel then returned to Seattle on August 18, and was then laid up in Lake Union, after certain minor repairs had been ma!le. The EiJJ- и plorer was transferred to the Navy Department on May 16, 1918, by Executive order. и The steamer Taku was assigned to survey the northwesterly end of Prince William Sound in regions where commercial development was. most active. Owing to the difficulty. of securing and holdmg an efficient crew and the constant trouble with the engme of the vessel, it was impracticable to continue work throughout the summer. The vessel surveyed the entrance to Port Nellie Juan and all of McClure Bay. Work was closed on August 22 and the party returned to Cordova: The vessel was then inspected by United States steamboat inspectors and was condemned as no longer economically fit for the survey work of the Bureau. The vessel was therefore sold to the highest bidder on December 13, 1917. . The steamer Yukon was laid up at King Cove, Alaska, during the entire year. In the summer of 1917 a party of the Bureau repaired the vessel and made her secure while laid up and housed over for the winter. Owing to the difficulty of securing and holding an efficient crew for the vessel no field work could be aone. During the summer of 1917 two wireиdrag parties were employed on a survev of the main passages forming the principal inside route ~hrough southeast Alaska. Difficulty was had in obtaining and holding efficient parties, but a satisfactory season's work was accomplished; in addition to the wire-drag work, the parties carried out a revision of the topography of the passages covered by the wire-drag survey. The triangulation for the same areas was mostly done by separate parties.

52

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Wire-drag party No. 3 extended the work in Frederick Sound from its easterly end in the vicinity of Dry Strait to Turnabout Island and thence northward to the north side of the entrance to Fort Houghton. The work was continued until September 27 and the party returned to Seattle on October 6. A number of the officers of the party were then transferred to the Army and Navy. Wire-drag party No. 4 completed the survey of the principal route through Stephens Passage, Saginaw Channel, Favorite Channel, and Lynn Canal from Point Hilda to Point Bridget. The work was continued until September 12, and the party returned to Seattle on September 19. A number of the officers of the party were then transferred to the Army and Navy. In the spring of 1918 four officers of the Bureau, using the equipment of wire-drag party No. 3, were sent to Anchorage, Alaska, to make a survey of Knik Arm in the approaches to the railroad terminal at Anchorage, at the head of Cook Inlet. This survey had been requested by the Alaskan Engineering Commission to insure safety for vessels carrying supplies to and from Anchorage. The party arrived at Anchorage on May 3, but the equipment did not arrive until May 19. The Alaskan Engineering Commission actively cooperated in the organization of ,the party, and enabled it to secure hands and launches sufficient to prpsecute the work satisfactorily. A comprehensive wire-drag and hydrographic survey was then begun and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. A survey of the town site of Anchorage was also made. In connection with this survey an automatic tide gauge was installed at Anchorage, and. tidal observations will be continued throughout the summer and fall until the formation of ice, in order to furnish data to enable the Bureau to publish full tidal prediction in the Tide Tables for the use of mariners for this important terminal. When the Patterson and Explorer were transferred to the Navy Department on May 1e, 1918, the commanding officer of those vessels withheld those men from the complement of the vessels who were not available for enlistment in the Naval Reserve to form a nucleus for a crew for the launch Cosmos. At the close of the fiscal year arrangements had been made for the repairing and placing of the Cosmos in commission and the party was en route to southeast Alaska.
FIELD WORK, PlULIPPINE ISLANDS.

The work of the sхrvey in the Philii>pine Islands is executed under the direction of the Director of Coast Surveys, an officer ofи the Coast and Geodetic Survey, who, acting under authority of the Superintendent, makes plans for the work, issues detailed instructions to the field parties, and also has charge of the field station at Manila. The expenses of the work are met partly from the appropriations for the Coast and Geodetic Survey and partly from funds provided by the Philippine government, which also furnishes four vessels for surveying purposes. One steamer, the PathP,nder, is furnished by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The five vessels of the Survey have been kept at work in the field as continuously as possible, being absent from the field only for the

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

58

purpose of renewing c9al and other supplies and having the necessary repairs made. . One of these, the small steamer Research of 96 tons register, was returned by the Bureau to the PhiliJ?pine government, it having determined that the vessel is not sufficiently seaworthy to continue on the surveys of the exposed localities remaining to be done in the islands. ) On March 19, 1918, the steamer Marinduque was temp_orarily transferred to the insular .government for use as a transpott among the islands. This vessel will be returned to the Coast and 1".ho.detic Survey as soon as full complement of officers of the Survey caii'"b"e'sent to the Philippine Islands. The steamer Pathfonder continued inshore and offshore topographic and hydrographic surveys in the vicinity of Polillo Islav.d until October 18, when the weather conditions through the ch'1tnge of monsoons became unfit for further work in that exposed locality. The vessel then returned to Manila for extensive repairs. These repairs were done at the naval station at Olongapo from December 12, 1917, to April 20, 1918. After obtaining the necessary supplies at Manila the vessel then proceeded to the field of work on the east coast of Palawan Island where the field work was continued to the end of the fiscal year. The steamer Fathomer was at Manila from July 1 to 12 for supplies. Inshore and offshore hydrographic work was then taken up in the vicinity of Polillo Island in conjunction with the steamer Pathfinder. The field work was discontinued about the middle of October due to the change of monsoons, making it imprac.: ticable to work in that locality for a longer time. The vessel was at Manila repairing from October 19 to November 26 and from March 2 to March 11, and otherwise was employed on offshore hydrographic surveys around Busuanga and Cuyo Islands in the northerly part of the Sulu Sea until the end of the fiscal year. The steamer Romblon was at Manila from July 7 to August 1, from October 14 to November 16, and from January 19 to April 18, outfitting and receiving the necessary repairs. Otherwise the vessel was employed during the fiscal year on combined surveys of the southeast coast of Palawan Island. The steamer Mari.auiu,que was employed 'on combined surveys on the east coast of Palawan from July 16 to September 22 and from .October 18 to December 19. The vessel was repaired and outfitted at Manila as necessary, and on March 19 was temporarily transferred to the insular government and the officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey were assigned to other duties. и The steamer Kesearch completed from July 1 to August 24 the survey of Manila Bay begun the previous fiscal year. The vessel was then laid up and on January 4, 1918, was transferred back to the insular government. и A very gratifying result of the field work in the Philippine Islands for the fiscal year is the completion of the secondary triangulation extending throughout the island of Palawan. This will enable the Bureau to prosecute its surveys around that island in a systematic !X1anner so that all work will be on the same datum, and further insures that all work executed in that locality will be done in a permanent manner. The hydrographic and topographic . surveys on

54

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

the east side of the island based on this triangulation have made excellent progress. An exhibit consisting of maps, charts, and illustrations, showing the work accomplished by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the Philippine Islands, was made at the annual carnival at Manila from February 2 to 10, 1918.
SECTION OF FIELD WORK.

This section is a part of the division of hydrography and topography. Its principal duties are to supervise the topographic and hydrographic surveys, and to coordinate and standardize the work of the vr.rious field rarties with a view to having a complete and continuous survey o the coast. When general surveys of the coast are in progress, new surveys in remote localities are to be made, or revision surveys contemplated, all data pertainin~ to the locality in which the work is to be done are assembled. From a careful review or these data, the best methods of accomplishing the work are determined and the memorand:i, for instructions prepared accordingly. General supervision is given to the topographic and hydrograph1c work as it progresses, and, through reports and sketches received monthly from each party, close touch is kept with the field work. During the year there were data collected and itemized memoranda prepared for ~O sets of in~tr~ctions for field work. These embraced a careful study of the ex1stmg surveys, the nature of the bottom; the. reviewing of reports upon previous work, and the required. closeness of the work needed to obtain a comprehensive survey of the locality in question. Original field sheets covering areas where changes frequently occur and where preliminary surveys only have been made were reviewed, in order to formulate plans for performing the field work necessary to bring the charts up to date. As time permitted, completed field sheets were reviewed in the section preparatory to recommending them for the Superintendentиs approval. There were 90 hydrographic sheets closely inspected, and memoranda bearing on the work were prepared for insertion in the descriptive report accompanying each sheet.
SECTION OF FIELD RECORDS.

The principal duty assigned to the section of field records is the inspect10n of the data submitted by the field parties, and their completion for publication and the files. This inspection of the field results has been extended to cover preliminary studies of miscellaneous reports and records for use in formulating detailed plans for the conduct of the work in the field, and takes into consideration both the means available and the general program of operations. In connection with the review and analysis of the results submitted by the field parties, there are noted the imperfections of present means and methods of conducting our operations, with a view of correcting these shortcomings in subsequent work. There are also developed and reported methods and treatment and suggestions for use in publishing the collected field data.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

55

In addition to the final review of the field results, examination of the work as it progresses is made, and preliminary instructions modified to meet the changing requirements of the work as it is developed . . The section has handled many miscellaneous requisitions and assignments. Duri.1g the months of April and May, 53 original hydrographic sheets were examined and memoranda prepared for insertion in the descriptive reports of the sheets. . As a part of his duties as a member of the personnel board, the chief of the section prepares examination papers for promotion of such officers as may be recommended. by the board. On June 11, 1918, the chief of the section was detached and assigned to duty as inspector of construction of the proposed new vessels for the Bureau, authorized in the sundry civil act of July 1, 1918, and no officers were available to carry on the routine work of the section after that date..
SECTION OF VESSELS AND EQUIPMENT.

The section of vessels and equipment has charge of the maintenance of the vessels of the Survey, and supervision is given to all estimates for repairs and the purchase of new equipment. Careful analysis is made of all estimates with a view to standardizing the equipment and supplying each vessel with an outfit adapted for the cluss of work upon which the vessel is to be enga~ed. Inspection of each vessel of the Survey is made once a year by the chief of section when conditions will permit, except vessels in Alaska and the Philippine Islands. Inspections of the vessels in Alaska and the Philippine Islands are made by officers of the Bureau in those localities, and reports forwarded to the office for consideration. In connection with the supervision of repairs, equipment, etc., of the vessels of the Survey, consideration was given to the preparation of plans and specifications for new vessels and wire-drag launches. The types of launches best suited for the survey work were decided upon, but final plans and specifications were not completed, owing to a lack of an appropriation for the work. Contracts for repairs and the charter of all launches hired for the season's work were inspected and prepared for the approval of the Superintendent. и Owing to the transfer of the chief of the section of vessels and equipment to duty with the Navy, on September 24, 1917, the work of this section was done after that date under the direction of the chief of the section of field work. On July 1, 1917, there were 13 vessels used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey for surveying duty. During the year 5 of these have been transferred by Executive order to the jurisdiction of _the Navy Department for the period of the war, one being, unfit for further service in the Bureau was condemned and sold, and two were returned to the jurisdiction of the insular government in the Philippine Islands, one of them temporarily for duty as a civil transport.
COAST PILOT SECTION.

During. the year this section carried on field work on the ~orth Atlantic coast, and as a result of the field work two coast pilots.

SECTION OF TIDES AND CURRENTS.

Atlantic Coast Pilot, section A, from Eastport).,. Me., to Cape Cod, and Atlantic Coast Pilot section B, from Cape vod to Sandy Hook, were compiled. Both volumes are at present in the hands of the printer. Numerous chart corrections collected during the course of the field work were submitted. These volumes when received will complete the issue of all coast pilots on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States and of Alaska in the new octavo form. Reprints were obtained during the year of Atlantic Coast Pilots, parts 1, 2, 3, and 4, section C and section D. Supplements for .five volumes and such correction sheets as were necessary to keep the information in all volumes up to date were issued. The record of the issue of coast pilots in recent years is interesting as indicating the usefulness of these publications. As these volumes are sold at a price sufficient to defray the cost of printing ( 50 cents) 2 it is obvious that the number sold fumishes an accurate measure ot the public demand. The following is the record of the issue for the fiscal years from 1911 to date:

Tidal observations were made throughout the year at 7 permanent tidal stations along the Atlantic coast, 3 on the Gulf of Mexico, 3_ on the Pacific coast, and 1 in Alaska. In addition to these, observations were made in connection with all hydrographic surveys in the United States, Alaska, and the Philippines. Tides were observed at 119 stations during the year, the total combined length of observations being 38 years, 7 months, 4 days. During the year all permanent tidal stations were inspected at least once, the inspection in all cases including the connection of the tide staffs of the station with the permanent bench mark by spirit levels. The work of making a comprehensive tidal and current survey of our coasts, which was begun m the summer of 1916, was continued durin~ the fis~al year ~918. A party in eastern. Long Island Sou!1d occupied 15 tidal stations and 46 current stat1oils. Other parties were occupied on such work in Mississippi Sound and Mobile Bay, Gulf of Mexico, in connection with hydrographic surveys. The purpose of the tidal survey is to obtain tidal information at important points along the coast, and the establishment of permanent tidal bench marks at all principal points along the coast, which will serve the public in all cases where a knowledge of tidal planes is required, such as for engineering operations, city and land surveys, surveys of oyster areas, and many other purposes; which will furnish hydrograph1c parties with standard datums; and which will affordи starting and checking points for lines of precise levels. The purpose of the current survey is to obtain definite information concerning currents in navigable channels, entrances to bays, rivers, passages, and at points along the coast, for the benefit of navigators.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

57

The tidal survey .is carried on by means of two automatic tide gauges and several subsidiary staffs иi current measurements are made by means of current meters, the ve ocity being obtained at various depths at each station, and also by means of a vertical pole float. . At the instance of the Navy Department, current observations were :made at the following places : The Race, between Little Gull Island and Fishers Island, N. Y., where the velocity was measured at various depths from near the surface nearly to the bottom of the channel ; at Port Jefferson, N. Y.; and on the west side of Block Island, R. I. The two tide staffs which were erected in Wrangell Strait, Ahiska, for the benefit of navigation, were visited and repainted. These staffs were set with their zeros at the plane of reference used on the charts, so that navigators can read directly from the staff what correction should be applied to the soundings on the chart to give the depth of water at that time. A special effort has been made to have newspapers in the principal seacoast cities of the country publish official tidal and related data, and a number of newspapers in Washington, Baltimore, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and many other cities have responded. The Tide Tables for 1918 were received from the prmter in September, 1917. These tables are similar to those of the preceding year, but full predictions are given for four additional ports, namely, Savannah, Ga.; Anchorage, Cook Inlet, Alaska; Cebu, P. I., and Port Hedland, Australia. The standard port of Amoy, China, has been discontinued, leaving 81 stations for which full predictions are given. Some other minor changes were made to make the volumes more useful to navigators~ The following table issues shows the increased demand for these tide tables in recent years:

The manuscript of the Tide Tables for 1919 was prepared and submitted for printing in three separate parts as follows: The manuscript of the Atlantic Coast Tide Tables was prepared and submitted in advance, before the other portions of the General Tide Tables had been predicted ; then the Pacific Coast Tide Tables Were prepared and submitted for printing; and last of all what relllained of the General Tide Tables was prepared and submitted. This arrangement is convenient to the Bureau, and under ordinary peace conditions will greatly expedite the early receipt of the volu:rnes for issue. The Italian Government requested this Survey to :furnish predicted tides for Venice, Italy, for the two yeai:,~,_ 1918 and 1919, Which was complied with. The Government of western Atmtralia Was furnished with copies of the proof sheets of the predicted tides for Port Hedland, Australia, for the two years, 1918 and 1919.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAS'r AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

Th~ computation for the graduation of the scales of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey sounding tubes was completed in this section, and also the corrections to be applied for variations in the height of the barometer and for changes in the temperature of air and water. The daylight saving law, which was apprqved on March 29, 1918, required the preparation and printing of an explanatory note to be inserted in the 1918 Tide Tables, as they were issued before the act became a law. lh addition to the extensive use by the military bureaus and Shipping Board of the tide and current tables published by the Bureau, the following data were prepared at the special request of bureaus engaged in war work. Descriptions of 558 bench marks, currents at 84 stations, predicted tides for Hog Island, Pa., predicted tide curves for two stations, ta})les of sunrise and sunset, highest and lowest sta12:es of the river at Portland, Oreg.,и and temperatures of the water for each month of the year at Norfolk, Va.
DIVISION OF GEODESY.

Almost the complete output of fie~d work .during the year was in the nature of war work, for the var10us proJects were called for by the Corps of Engineers, United States Army. и Just before war was declared on Germany, in the.spring of 1917, a committee on mapping was formed by the Corps of Bngineer'3, United States Army, for the purpose of coordinating t 1 .1e varioas surveying work of the Government with a view toward having the mapping bureaus assist in the preparation of military maps in this country. The chief of the division of geodesy of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was appointed a member of this committee to represent the Department of Commerce. This committee had several meetings, at which it was decided that the Geological Survey and the Coast and Geodetic Survey should assist the Corps of Engineers, in every way possible, in their military mapping. Accordingly, it was arranged that the geodetic field parties of the Coast and Geodetic Survey should, as far as possible, be engaged exclusively on war worlr. After July 1, 1917, until the end of the fiscal year the only geodetic work done which was not of immediate military value was in southeastern Alaska, where two parties were engaged on primary triangulation for several months. The work which has been done in the past by the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the work now being done in the interior of the country in furnishing C?1_ltrol for ma;P~ and s.urveys hav~ proved of very great value to the miht~ry authorit~es. Without the triangulation along the coasts of the Umted States it would have been most difficult to have made maps of extensive regions which are to be used for defensive purposes. It is evident, from the fact that the control work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey now in existence has been of great military value that such control should be extended rapidly into those areas of the United States which are now totally lacking geodetic surveys. There are some areas that are tens of thousands of squa~e miles in extent

but which do not have a single triangulation station or precise level station. If topographic maps are made in such areas ahead of the control work, there will be endless confusion when an attempt is ever made to coordinate and join surveys made in various parts of a large area; there will be gaps and overlaps and offsets where any two maps join, unless the control has been carried ahead of the detailed surveying. Aside from the desirability of having control in order to eliminate discrepancies in the maps of a large area, it is most essential that such control be prepared in advance of its needs, in order that serious delays may not result when it has been found necessary to cover unmapped areas for military purposes. This country has had very serious losses as a result of unpreparedness in military work. We should profit by the experience of the past and provide that no serious embarrassment to the Government and the country shall occur as the result of lack of maps and surveys. That the country will have to be mapped is evident to anyone who has taken any part in the commercial, industrial, and military a ff airs of the N at10n. Not only will it be necessary to have up-to-date maps where there are large centers of population, but the mountains and plains where the population is sparse will have to be mapped for military purposes, for they may be the areas within which important military preparations may be conducted. The presence or absence of proper maps may decide the fate of a battle and it seems to be good business, as well as patriotism, to have all areas that may be of military value mapped in the near future. In fact, such mapping should be rushed. The cost of the mapping of the whole country, in such a way as to furnish results that would be of infinite value to tl1e military establishments, would be less than the cost of a single battleship and much less than the expense of a division of soldiers for one year in time of war. What has been said above emphasizes the need of topographic maps for military purposes. They are needed just as much for the purpose of commerce and the industries of the Nation. A nation depends for its strength not on military forces alone, but on the mdust!'ies which make war materials available and the means of transportation which carry those materials to the armies of seaports where they are needed. Without maps industries are at a great disadvantage. It would be foolish to start a power plant on a river if topographic maps were not available to show the extent of a watershed feeding the river. It would also be unwise to put up a plant, or to attempt to do so, if the difficulties of road building would be such as to make the plant inaccessible, except at an enormous expense of transportation. There are many places in the United States where timber, ores of various kinds, buildmg materials, etc., would become available if there were topographic maps by which roads for transporting such supplies could be laid out. . There is an instance of a topographic map having been made by the Geological Survey, in the иState of Michigan, in cooperation With a certain railroad. As a result of the survey, a gap or pass was found among some hills which permitted (the railroad to Join two places at a very great reduction of cost ovelr what the expense would have been if it had been necessary to skirt ~he hilly country or build the road through some pass that was much higher in eleYation. It Was stated by officials of the railroad that t\he saving to the company

60

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

in finding 'that one pass was much greater than the total cost of the topographic survey. The chief engineer of one of the western railmads, several years ago, stated that the topographic surveys, as published by the Geological Survey, were of the greatest value to the railroad in question, for it was frequently possible to choose a route between terminal points by reference to the Geological Survey maps that would be far better than could possibly have been selected had those maps not been in existence. The maps of the country to-day, published by the Geological Survey, are used also to a very great extent in the extension of the electric transportation lines in extending the network of telegraph and telephone lines as well as th.ose carrying electrical power throughout the country. The development of the good-roads system of the United States, which must be carried on in the very near. future with the expenditure of hundreds of millions per annum, requires the rapid completion of topographic surveys in the areas not now mapped in order that the иwork may be done quickly and economically. The saving to the good-roads movement alone, in the period of five or ten years, will far more than pay for the topographic mapping of all unmapped areas in the United States. This country is becoming a nation of map users and, after the war, the demand for maps is going to be far greater than ever before: Therefore it behooves the Government to provide means for rapidly mapping the unmapped areas of the country. It is hardly pr.obable that this can be taken up to any very g_reat extent, or at least the present effort can not be made much greater until the war is over. A most important part of the mapping of the country is the preliminary work called geodetic control. It would be just as improvident to try to build a house without drawing up a general plan and having the framework erected first as to make a topograph16 survey of a large area of the country without having established numerous points in the area whose latitude, longitude, and elevation were previously determined. A map is a poor one that does not have the proper control to enable one to refer the topographic features accurately to the universally adopted system of coordinates; that is, the plane of the Equator, the plane of the meridian through Greenwich, and mean sea level. Those three coordinates are used, respectively, for latitude, longitude, and elevation. It will be impracticable to extend greatly the geodetic work of th.e Coast and Geodetic Survey during the war, and, therefore, no increase in the State survey item of the appropriation bill that is asked for the year 1920 is recommended. As soon as the war ends this policy will be changed, and a material increase in the State survey item will be asked m order that a rapid extension of the geodetic control may be made. It is impossible to predict h.ow much geodetic control is needed in this country. This will depend on the evolution of maps. It is known, however, that as a minimum requirement there should be a point or J?Oints whose latitude, longitude, and accur.ate elevation are known within about 50 or 100 miles of every place in the United States. We are far from having this mimmum amount, and it

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

61

should be planned to have it as soon as practicable after the close of the war. H we have the network of triangulation and traverse lines an? also .a network of precisE? leveling lines spread ov:er the country m such a way that no place is more than a moderate distance from primary control, then it would be very easy to furnish any Government bureau, or any State or city with primary control upon request in a very short time. It is believed that it would be econom~ca! to com.J;>lete this minimum control at an ~rly date and the fill m mtermed1ate areas as the demands should arise. The amount of precise leveling remaining to be done in order to meet this minimum requirement is about 12,000 miles. There are now in existence in the United States about 39,400 miles of this class of leveling. There should be about 9,000 linear miles of arcs of primary triangulation in order to furnish the latitudes and longitudes necessary to supplement the existing work to provide what may be called the minimum amount of control. There are now in existence about 15,000 miles of primary triangulation and primary traverse in this country. It should have been stated that the primary triangulation should be supplemented at times with primary traverse, Each is equally strong in furnishing primar,Y control, but the primary traverse is only used when the country is very flat and heavily wooded, which conditions make primary triangulation very expensive. The new horizontal and vertical control which is necessary to supplement the present work and to meet the minimum requirementt; will cost about $600,000. This is a very small amount in comparison with the benefits which would accrue to the Nation. If all of the geodetic funds were expended for 10 years, we should be able to complete the control up to what we call the minimum requirements. But that work should be done sooner than in 10 years, and besides a por.tion of the geodetic funds are spent each year in what may be called the intermediate areas to furnish horizontal and vertical control fo1 surveys and maps in response to requests from the Corp~ of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, and other competent authorities. We may, therefore, assume that not more than $35,000 can be spent toward completing the general project each year. Consequently it would be between 15 and 20 years before the general Project could be completed. This is a condition which must be remedied, and the remedy should be provided in the form of increased appropriations for geodetic work immediately after the war. What has been said above in regard to the need for geodetic control for surveys and maps in the United States applies equally to tho territory of Alaska. There we have a large area of very valuable minerah timber, and other classes of land which are being surveyed ~y the Lteneral Land Office and the topographic branch of the United .States Geological Survey. Those organizations are making maps ln those areas which are being developed earliest. Eventually the и "arious maps will be joined, and then the trouble occasioned by gaps, O'\>erlaps, and offsets will present itself. Again, we may refer to the T1burdity of trying to build a house without first erecting the frame. e frame for the ma_ps and surveys in Alaska should undoubtedly be done ahead of the detailed work and funds should be provided in sufficient- quantities immediately after the war to extend certain lines over the area which should have been done in the past. These lines

of primary triangulation and :precise leveling are shown in two illustrations which have accompamed several reports of the Superintendent in past years. They show the sad lack of geodetic control in Alaska.
FIELD WORK.

At the end of the fiscal year 1917 a party was being organized at Harlingen, Tex., to carry on reconnoissance and signal building along the Rio Grande to the westward of Harlingen. Early in the fiscal year 1918 this party, which consisted of a reconnoissance P.arty, under the immediate charge of the chief of party and two building parties to be engaged in the erection of signals, was completely organized. This combined party continued operations until Nov.ember when the work was connected with that being carried eastward from the vicinity of Van Horn, Tex., by another party. Automobile trucks were used as a means of transportation, several of which were borrowed from the Quartermaster, United States Army. These automobile trucks have proved conclusively to be far more efficient as a means of transportation for geodetic parties than horses and wagons, which were used for many years. A slightly different type of triangulation signal from that usually employed m primary triangulation was used. It was somewhat along the general plan of the older signals, but very much lighter It.Imber was used. Considerable time and money were saved by cutting down the amount of lumber in each of the signals as the transportation was very difficult and expensive along the Rio Grande most of the places at which signals were built being far removed from lumberyards. Earl_y in August, 1917, a primary triangulation party was organized which began observations immediately to the west of Harlingen and occupied stations which were provided by the reconnoissance and signal-building party. This work was continued to the westward until it joined that of another party which was working eastward from the vicinity of Van Horn, Tex. Early in September, 1917, a. иreconnoissance was made to the eastward of Van Horn, Tex., along the Rio Grande, to a junction with the work of a party in the vicinity of Del Rio, Tex. When the two obs.erving parties on the Rio Grande completed their work, a primary base-line par? was organized for the purpose of measuring bases along the arc o triangulation. This work was completed late in May, 1918. Both observing parties and the base-line party on the Rio Grande arc used automobile trucks as the means of transportation. As in the case of the building and reconnoissance work, they proved to be the ideal means of communication over the country traversed because of the difficulty of securing water and supplie>s. 'V'ith horses and wagons as a means of triangulation the work would have cost several times more than it did. The Rio Grande arc was done at the request of the office of the Chief of Engineers, for the purpose of furnishing control for military topographic surveys and maps which were being made at the time the trianf1lation was begun. . The Chief o Engineers also requested the following !ines of precise leveling in Texas: Sierra Blanca to San Antomo and New

~ntonio to Point Isabel, by way of Sinton, Robstown, and Browns-

Braunfels; Spofford to Eagle Pass; San Antonio to Laredo; San

ville; a spur line from Robstown to Corpus Christi; Sinton to Beautnont, thence to New Orleans, La. The line from Sierra Blanca eastward had been begun by two Parties during the latter part of the fiscal year 1917. These two P~rties continued operations until the line had been completed from ~1erra Blanca to New Braunfels, by way of San Antonio. A spur hne had been run from Spofford to Eagle Pass and levels had been begun on the line running southward from San Antonio toward Laredo and southward from San Antonio toward Point Isabel. Work was continued along the San Antonio-Laredo line until it reached the latter pla.ce. The party then proceeded to Sinton, Tex., and began running a line eastward from that place toward New Orleans. The line of levels was .carried to Point Isabel by way of Robstown and Brownsville. From Robstown a spur line was run to Corpus Christi, where a connection was made with a number of tidal bench lllarks which had previously been established at that place. After the completion of the measurements of the bases along the Rio Grande, a line of check levels was run over a portion of the line between Robstown and Point Isabel in order to discover an error of 1 meter which had been made in the original running of the line. When this error had been found, which proved to be an even meter, in the vicinity of San Benito, the work of this party was closed for the year. . The line of levels running from the vicinity of Sinton northeastward toward New Orleans was carried to the vicinity of Lafayette, l.a., and several spur lines were run from the main line to bench tnarks on the Gulf coast. Work on the line running toward New Orleans was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. The parties working in Texas on leveling used motor velocipedes as the means of transporting their pn,rties, with the exception of one Party working along the Southern Pacific Railroad, to the eastward of Houston, Tex., which used an automobile truck, supplemented by railroad trains . . The Chief of Engineers requested horizontal and vertical control ln Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, ttnd Alabama. This work had been begun in the latter part of the fiscal year 1917, when parties were organized to extend primary traverse and precise leveling northwestward from Jacksonville, Fla., and Brunswick, Ga. These parties were at work during the early Part of the fiscal year 1918 and contimwd throughout the year, with sonie modifications which will be indicated below. l The work called for by the Chief of Engineers included the folOWing lines : C (1) Primary traverse and precise leveling, Jacksonville, Fla., to ?lumbus, Ga.; (2) primary traverse and precise leveling, Bruns"11ck to Columbus, by way of Macon, Ga.; (3) primary traverse an~ precise leveling from Albany, Ga., to Callahan, Fla., by way ~ Valdosta, Ga. ; ( 4) primary traverse and precise leveling from aeon to Griffin, Ga.; ( 5) primary triangulation from Griffin to ..\tlanta, Ga. ; ( 6) primary traverse and precise leveling from Macon

to Savannah, Ga.; (7) precise leveling from Macon to McDonough, Ga.; (8) primary traverse and preci8e leveling Savannah to Everett City, Ga.; (9) precise leveling, Everett City, Ga., to Yulee City, Fla.; (10) primary 'traverse and precise leveling :from Savannah, Ga., to Norfolk, Va., by way of Columbia, S. C., and Raleigh, N. C.; (11) precise leveling, Biloxi, Miss., to River Junction, Fla. As mentioned above, the work on the first two lines was be~n during the fiscal year 1917. Those t:wo lines and the work on Imes numbered :from 3 to 9, both inclusive, were completed by the end of the fiscal year 1918. The work on line No. 10 had been extended uorthward to the vicinity of Pontiac, S. C., and southwestward from Norfolk, Va., to the vicinity of Vaughan, N. C. The work on line No. 11 had been carried to a :point a little to the eastward of Pensacola, Fla. Two combined parties operated on the Savannah-Norfolk line and one leveling party on the line No. ll. There are бven below details in regard to the organization of the parties carrymg Oll the work in the Eastern States. At the beginning of the fiscal year a primary traverse party was operating northwestward along the line from Jacksonville toward Columbus. A precise leveling party was operating along the same line and cooperating with the traverse party. The work accomplished by these two parties consisted of primary traverse and pi:ecise leveling from Jacksonville to Columbu~ from Albany to Callahan, by way of Valdosta; from Savannah to ~Yerett City, and from Savannah northward to Pontiac, S. C.; also a line of precise leveling from Everett City to Yulee, Fla. . The primary traverse party that was working northwestward from Brunswick, Ga., carried the primary traverse to the vicinity of Columbus, Ga., where a connection was made with simiiar work done by another party and a traverse and triangulation were begun between Macon and Atlanta, Ga. The J?recise leveling party operating to the northwestward of Brunswick, Ga., at the beginnip.g of the fiscal year 1918 completed the line to the vicinity of Fort Valley, where a connection was made with a line of levels run by the party working from Jacksonville to Columbus. After making this connection a line of precise levels was run from Macon northward to McDonough. This party completed a line of primary traverse and precise leveling from Macon to Savannah, and then moved to Norfolk, Va., and carried similar work southwestward to the vicinity of Vaughan, N. C. by the end of the fiscal year. Early in April, 1918, field work was begun on a short arc of primary triangulation between Griffin and Atlanta for the purpose of connecting several lines of primary traverse in Georgia with the primary triangulation of the oblique arc. This work was . finished about the middle of May. In February 1918, after the completion of the line of precise leveling from San Antonio to Point Isabel, Tex., a line was begun running eastward from Biloxi, Miss., toward. River .Junction, Fla. At the close of the fiscal year the line had been extended to a point about 15 miles to the eastward of Pensacola. For the first few months of the fiscnl year 1918 two primary triangulation parties carried on primary triantiulation rn southeast и Alaska. This work had been started during the latter part of the

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

65

fiscal year 1917. The work of these parties was part of a general arc of primary triangulation which will eventually extend from Tacoma, Wash., to the crossing of the Yukon River by the one hundred and forty-first meridian. A portion of the arc in Canadian territory will be done by the geodetic survey of Canada. This is a remarkabie example of geodetic cooperation between the geodetic surveys of two nations, and the results of the work will be of immense value to each of them in furnishing final control for the supveys and maps that will be made in western Canada and in Alaska. In ~u~y, 1917, a fopo.graphic survey was made for the military authorities at Camp Meigs, D. C. Certain surveys were also made of the grounds of the rifle range at Congress Heights, Md. This work was requested by Brig. Gen. R. D. Sims, of the District of Columbia National Guard. A survey was made in the vicinity of Lewes, Del., for the purpose of locating a range mark of the Delaware Breakwater Trial Course. The work was done at the request of the Cramp Ship Building Co., and all expenses incident t~ the work, except the salary of the Coast Survey field officer, were paid by that company. The work was done in May, 1918. Late in October and early in November a geographic position and azimuth were determined in the Aberdeen Provmg Ground, Md., in response to a request from the Army officials connected with the proving ground. A tertiary triangulation was made in upper Chesapeake Bay late in January and early in February to determine the geographic positions of a number of range towers used by the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The request for this work was also made by the officials of the proving ground. и Late in May, 1918, additional triangulation was begun in the upper Chesapeake Bay for the purpose of determining the geographic positions of a number of range towers erected by the officials of the provingи ground at Aberdeen. The request was made for this work by those officials. и This work at the proving ground was in progress at the end of the fiscal year.
SUMMARY OF GEODETIC WORK ACCOMPLISHED.

The total amount of geodetic work accomplished in the United States and Alaska, during the fiscal year 1918, is as follows:
Primary triangulation along axis_____________________________________ 689 Primary traverse---------------------------------------------------- 940 Tertiaryleveling triangulation along axis of scheme____________________________ 2,367 70 Precise ______________________________________________________
MlleR.

The above does not include triangulation done by any hydrographic parties, nor any work in the Phil~pp!ne Islands. No precise leveling or traverse was done except that mdicated above. The geodetic work of the Survey was not done at as low cost as usual for two reasons: One is that many of the experienced officers who had been doing that work in the past were transferred to the Army and Navy and the field operations had to be done to a large extent by. new engineers. This statement does not apply, of course,
85524-18--5

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

to those engineers on geodetic work who had had large experience and who had not been transferred to the Army or Navy. Another cause for the higher cost of the work was the greater cost of material and the :&igher wages paid to the temporary employees. Several records were made during the year on geodetic work. The most notable one wa.s in March, 1918, when 165.4 miles of precise leveling were run in one month. This is 6 miles greater progress in a calendar month than that previously made in October, 1916. It goes without saying that this is a world's r.ecord for a single month of precise leveling. In no other country is such rapid work done on precise leveling as in the United States. In one day of February, 1918, 22 miles of single line of leveling were completed. The previous record for a single day's work was between 20 and 21 miles. Observations were completed at 79 primar7 triangulation stations on the Rio Grande arc, at an average rate o 16 stations per month, with a maximum number of 18 per month. This record is slightly greater than that made several years ago on the southern end of tl).e ninety-eighth meridian in Texas. Seven differences of longitude were observed in Georgia and Florida between Atlanta, Ga., and Fernandina, Fla. The sum of the seven differences agrees with the prcwiously determined difference between Fernandina and Atlanta within 0.009 second. The correction to each of the new differences to make them fit the old results was either 0.001 or 0.002 second. This is a remarkably close agreement, and is an indication of excellent observing and instruments.
DIVISION OF
TERREST~~L

MAGNETISM.

The duties of the chief of division. include preparation of plans, estimates, and instructions for the field work; the inspection of the records as they are received; recommendations regarding the purchase, construction, and repair of instruments, and the construction and alteration of observatory buildings; supervision of the office computations and preparation of results for publication; and discussion of results.
MAGNETIC SURVEY.

In the continuation of the magnetic survey of the United States, observations were made during the year at 275 stations in 21 States, of which 118 were new primary stations, 114 auxiliary stations, 34 repeat stations for the determination of secular change, .and 9 new stations in old localities. Meridian lines were established when they were requested by the local authorities. The number of county seats at which magpetic observations have not been made was reduced from 163 to 138. Observatiops were abio made (declination only in most cases) at a number of places in Alaska and the Philippine Islands in connection with other branches of the work in the Survey. In cooperation with the department of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, special observations were made at the time of the solar eclipse on June 8. Eye readings of declination were made at one-minute intervals for a period of six hours at three stations in the belt of totality, namely:. Orlando, Fla.,

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

67

Mena, Ark., and Green River, иWyo. Eye. readings of declination were also made for the same period at the five magnetic observatorie5, and values of declination, horizontal intensity, and vertical intensity at five~minute intervals were computed from the records of the magnetographs. In further cooperation with the department of и terrestril;l.l mag11etism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, two magnetic observers of this Bureau took part in a series of ob8ervations in the vicinity of Pikes Peak, Colo., for the purpose of determining, if possible, the variation in the earth's magnetism with change of altitude. Nearly simultaneous observations were made at stations on the mountain and at numerous stations around the base at much lower altitudes. Provision was made for insuring a homogeneous и series of observations by having all the observers make observations at a common station at Manitou.
MAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES.

The observatories at Cheltenham, Md., Vieques, P. R., Tucson, Ariz., Sitka, Alaska, and near Honolulu, Hawaii, were in operation throughout the year. Continuous photographic records were secured of the variations of declination, horizontal intensity, and vertical intensity. Absolnte observations were made at least once a week and scale-value determinations once a month. Beginning with January, 1918, horizontal-intensity observations, as well as dip and declination, were made both in иthe morning and in the afternoon on the same day to secure additional data regarding the relation between the variation and absolute instruments. All of the magnetic instruments used in the field work were standardized at Cheltenham. In addition, comparisons were made between the extra magnetometer No. 40 at Cheltenham and the standard magnetometer of the department of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. This magnetometer No. 40 was subsequently sent to Tucson 1or comparison, in order to verify the change in the relation of the Cheltenham and the Tucson magnetometers which had been indicated by the observations made at Tucson with one of the field magnetometers in October, 1917. A comparison between the Cheltenham and Sitka observatory instruments was also secured from the instruments sent to Sitka for use in the field work и in the interior of Alaska. At Cheltenham the investigation of the relation between the absolute instruments and the two magnetographs was continued, but no satisfactory explanation of the outstanding differences was determined. In October, 1917, the absolute building at Sitka was moved from the old site on the Swanson property to the lot on which the varia~ tion building stands, near the site of the old Russian blockhouse, and the necessary observations were made for determining the relation between the two sites. The erection of a new building for office quarters at Cheltenham was deferred because of conditions regarding material and labor arising out of the war. A seismograph was operated continuously at each observatory. Considerable difficulty was experienced at Honolulu in April because of the excessive moisture in the seismograph house, and it became necessary to tear up the floor in order to remove the water which had accumulated underneath.

off that port In conformity with instructions dated April rn, 1!H8. Tht> party arrived at Port Jefferson at 5 p. m. on April 25, 1918, and field work was begun on April 26. It was found that the two buoys menttone(l in the data furnished with the instruetions as marking the approximatP ends of the trial <'ourse were not in place, and current stations were accordingly located nt about the points where these buoys would be placed, judging by the data furnished. 'l'he main-current station was located at the western end of the course, and currents wei:e observed 11t this station at hourly Intervals for 52! consecutive hours, beginning at 8.30 a. m. on April 26, 1918. For the greater part of this period the weather conditions were exceptionally favorable for current observations. During the daytime on April 26 and 27 simultuneous observations werp obtained nt a sPcond station located near the eastern encl of the course. 'Vhile current observations were b~ing obtalne(\, triangulntion wus carried on to locate the trial-course range beacons and prominent objects In the vicinity of the field of work. The beacons w~re found ns dcscribed in the data furnished. 'l'he two westerly beacons have rectangular center poles about 4 by 10 inches in. cross :-;E'Ction. The easterly h<'acons have round <'enter poles about 10 inches in diameter. A tide gauge was established on the east breakwater at the entrance to Port .Tpfferson Harbor and connected with bench marks at Port .Teft'erson by levels. Hy<lrographic work was begun on April 30 and completed on May 2. Wire-drag work was begun on May 3 mul completed on May 6. As it is <'Vident that submarines using this course must navigate waters westward of meridian 73░ 06", the western limit of the work requested by tbe Navy Depnrtment, the work was exten(\e<l to meridinn 73░ 07'. The work waR somewhat delayed by smoke, haze, and fog, especially In the forenoons. After completing the survey the party proceeded to Stonington, Conn., May 7, 1918, and at once began thp wire-drag survey of the area in Long Island Sound, in the vicinity of Bartlett Reef Light Vessel. 'l'his work wns in progress on Mny 24, when instructions, dnted May 23, 1918, to transfer the pnrty to the coast of Maine were received. The equipment was loaded on the launches on l\fuy 25 and on May 26 the party left Stonington in the launehes for the coast of Maine. It wus necessary to stop at some harbor each night en route in order to secure uccommodntlons for the party. From June S until June 13 the pnrty wns engaged in signnl building, triangulation, establishing a tidal station, and miscelhmeous work. During this period the weather was mostly stormy, with fog nnd rnln, and consequently unfavorable for wire-drag work. Wire-drag work was started on June 14, and the survey was continued under very favorable weather conditions.

SUMMARY OF BESULTS.-Trlangulation: 4 stations In main schemes occupied for horizontal measures, 8 geographic positions determined. Wire-drag work: 14 square mllt>s of area dragged, 50 m!Jes run while dragging, 35 retained soundings, 1 wire-drag sheet partly llnlsh!'d, scale 1 : 20,000.

Wire-drug party was organized In April, 1918, at Kittery Point, Me., by .J. A. Daniels, pending the arrival of F. B. T. Siems, who took charge of the party on May 3. On May 4 the party and launches proceeded to the working grounds at Block Island, arriving there on May 6. The launches accepted for ehurter by this party for wire-drag surveys, consisted of the Gladys as tender, the Bernard /<'. as end launch, and the Wisdom, which was building at the time of acceptance at Broad Channel, L. I., ns guide launch. The Wisdom wns intended to be delivered to the party on Aи rll 15, 1918. The launch, however, was still in an incomplete state by the lntter part of June, when steps were taken to charter another launch to replace the Wisdom. The Bernard /<'. proved unserviceable for towing a wire-drag outfit over 3,000 feet In length, due to insufficient power; also, being of poor design, the Inunch rolled heavily in the seawny. Provisions for replacing the Bernard F. with a suitable launch were also made. During May and June the Lillian B. was temporarUy hired as a guide launch and was used with the Bernard F. for short wire-drag work off the west shore of Block Island. Surveys requested by the Navy Department, consisting of a hydrographlc and wlre-drng survey of the 3-mile standardization course for submarine!! along the west shore of Block Island, extending from Sandy Point to Grace Point, were made during May and June. The hydrography covered an area five-eighths of a mile on either side of the trial course and extending nbout 5 statute miles in the dlre<!tion of the trial course. The area swept by the wire drag extends westward from the 10-foot curve along the west shore of Block Island between Sandy Point and Southwest Point to a junction with the wiredrag work previously completed south of Gi:ace Point and about 2! miles offshore north of Grace Point. Currents were observed at five stations on the trial course, the analyses of which show that the currents at these points are Irregular, of small velocity, and influenced appreciably by winds. и The important bowlders and obstructions found by the wire drag are located within 1 mile of the shore. A wreck with 51 feet of water over It was found In a depth of about 75 feet, a 9-foot bowlder was found in a depth of 18 feet about one fourth mile offshore, and a bowlder with 15 feet of water over it was found three-eighths of a mile offshore near Southwest Point, the general depth here being 30 feet. The ranges ashore marking 1 nautical mile distances on the trial course were located by triangulation.

'

At the beginning of the fiscal year wire-drag work was in progress in Block Island Sound in the appJOOaches to Narragansett Bay, R. I. Progress made in this work prior to July 1 is stated In the annual report for 1917. On Sunday, July 1, the chief of party, with one launch, proceeded to Cerehus Shoal, Block Island Sound, and located the position of the U. S. s. Olympia and the buoys marking the shoal. On July 23 assistance was rendered to the 98-ton, two-masted schooner Emma F. Potter, of Annapolis, Nova Scotia, which had gone ashore In a fog on the east bank of Sakonnet River about one-half mile north of Sakonnet, R. I. Some difficulty was experienced in finding the vessel in the fog, but she was finally located, and with the Pilot, one of the wire-drag launches used by the party, was towed oft' the shore and Into Sakonnet Harbor. On August 23 the party was visited by Lieut. Commander Frank Stewart, of the Argentine Navy, naval attach~ to the Argentine Embassy, for the purpose of observing the operation of the wire drag. The field work which could be economically carried on from Sakonnet was completed early In September, and on September 6 the headquarters of the party were moved to Saunderstown, R. I., on the shore of the west passage of Narragansett Bay. On November 9 Commander Julio Dittborn, of the Chilean Navy, naval attach~ to the Chilean Embassy, visited the. party, and was given the opportunity to witness the drag in operation. и Supplemental instructions were issued September 19, October 3, and November 10 for wire-drag work between Bartlett Reef and the vicinity of The Race, Long Island Sound entrance, and this work, with the exception of a small area near Valiant Rock, was corr.pleted before the close of the season. On November 27 wire-drag work was discontinued in the vicinity of The Race, and the party returned to Saunderstown, R. I., where, on December 4, the party was discharged. A scheme of triangulation was carried up Sukonnet .River for the control of the hydrogruphy anrt topography from two old recovered stations, Telegraph 2 and East Rock, and was connected with the old station, Anthonys Rock, at the entrance to Mount Hope Bay. This scheme included 14 occupied stations and 36 Intersection stations, which were used for control of the hydrography and topography. The entire shore llne of both banks of Sakonnet River was traversed with the plane table. A complete new hydrographlc survey of the river was made and plotted on two sheets on a scale of 1: 10,000. Lines were run at intervals of about 200 meters, and the shoal area> were closely developed. In the operations from Sakonnet considerable delay was experienced at the beginning of the !'!eason in getting the drag work well underway on account of the prevalllng southwest winds and the foggy weather. At the east end the work was joined to that done by .T. H. Hawley In 1914 and was carried oft'shore south from Browns Ledge to the 20-futhom curve. Few shoals were found with less depths than 60 feet. Owing to the great depth to which the drag was set, the wooden floats with which the party was equipped water-logged very rapidly, and It soon became evident that metal floats were essential for this deep work. After July 1 metal floats similar to those used in Alaska were constructed and used during the remainder of the season. In all an area of 145 square miles was dragged, using Sakonnet as a base, and in this area more than 50 shoals were discovered. The highest pinnacle found with the drag was a small rock about 15 feet in diameter at the top with 36 feet of water over It and surrounded by a depth vf 72 feet. It was only after considerable search that the leadsman succeeded in getting the sounding. After changing the headquarters of the party to Saunderstown the drag work was carried on from that base, joining that which had been done from Sakon net. When the weather conditions would not permit of dragging in this area, work was done In the protected waters of the west passage of Narragansett Bay and Newport Entrance, but neither was completed. All the inside work was done with a short draK setи very close to the bottom. An area of about 45 square

miles was dragged, using Saunderstown as a base, and in this area about 16 shoals were found, the most important of these being the 28-foot spot south of Brenton Reef buoy and the 31-foot spot at the entrance to the west passage. Due to the strong currents and the great depth to which the area in the vicinity of Bartlett Reef and The Race was dragged, many difficulties were encountered which materially retarded the progress oJ_ the work. The ordinary routine with the drag aground, which consists of sounding at the indicated location until a depth less than that at which the drag is set Is found, wns Impracticable in 'llhe Race. In this strong current the entire drag, large and small buoys and all, was swept under and out of sight as soon as It touched bottom, and unless the tender was near the shoal when this happened there was no indicated location, and all efforts to find the shoal were fruitless. The proceeding in this case was Immediately to begin to take up the drag and to endeavor to locate the shoal when the wire was seen to he caught on the shoal. This procedure was often prevented by the breaking of the wire. Around shoal spots the strong currents caused whirlpools, by which the drag was drawn beneath the surface so as to catch at a depth below that at which the drag was set. In all, in this locality an area of about 18.5 square statute miles was completed and about 21 shoals were found, the most Important shoal being the 38-foot spot which lies about one-half mile west-southwest from Bartlett Reef Light Ve!<sel, where the chart showed a depth of 14 to 20 fathoms. This region Is a treacherous one on account of the numerous bowlclers and ledges. A plane table survey was made of the !'ltreet system of .TarneRtown, R I., nnd the roads on Conanlcut Island. The control for this work wns obtnlned from the existing triangulntlon. In this snrvey a new determinntion wns made of the position of the Jamestown standpipe. A total of 32.5 statute miles of public roads was mapped, and brief notes as to the construction and condition of the roads were prepared. The hired launches, Pilot, Standard, nnd Edna M., were used In this work. These boats were the best that cqulfl be obtained, but they were not well Ruited to the purpose of a wlre-dru.~ survey. The entire senson's work was done at the request of the Navy Department.

Inspection duty for the region between Narragansett and Dela .ire Bays was continued by an officer who is in charge of a field station of the Survey, with nn office in the Customhouse, New York City. The demand upon the field station for nautical information and publications has greatly Increased and its usefulness has been extended. Coples of tide tables for 1918 and tables giving the time of sunrise and sunset and moonrise and moonset were prepared and furnished to persons desiring to publish them in local calendars, and in some instances the proof of these was read tor the publishers. Similar tables were furnished to a number of newspapers and journals. The Inspector had charge of the Bureau exhibit at the Southern Commercial Congress held in New York October 15 to 17, and of an exhibit illustrative of the work of the Survey at the National M\)tor Boat Show, New York, Janu- ~ ary 19 to 26. A triangulation station at the eastern end of Long Island was transferred to a new position, the change having become necessary on account of building operations. The tide stations at Sandy Hook. N. J., Fort Hamilton, N. Y., and St. George, Staten Island, N. Y., were inspected in company with an officer of the Corps of Engineers, United States Army. The inspector has voluntarily given one evening In each week to teaching nautical astronomy In the Hudson River Power Squadron Free School at the High School of Commerce nnC. has distributed a number of canceled charts and tide tables, for purposes of Instruction only; in these classes and also to the Naval School at Pelham Bay Park. и Attention was given to the inspection and shipment of material ~nd r.upplles intended for the use of field pnrties of the Survey. In May the inspector was engaged In certain field work on the coast of New Jersey, which had been requested by the Navy Depnrtment. Information and publications were furnished to various officials and a stock of charts and nautical publlcntions was maintained for reference, distribution, and sale to the public. The privilege of obtaining charts nnd publications of the Survey from the field station without delay as emergencies arise Is appreciated by officers of the Army and Nnvy, who have frequently expressed their gratlficntlon at the convenience. The Inspector was called upon to testify as a witness in court on two occasions where expert testimony was required on questions relating to surveys.

[PAUL C. WHITNllY, Commanding Steamer Bache.) SUMMARY OF RllSULTS.-Trlangulatlon : 15 square miles of area coverl:'d, 6 stations occupied for horizontal measures~ 24 geographic positions determined. Topography : 1 square mile of area surveyed, 5.o miles of shore line surveyed, 3 miles of creeks and sloughs surveyed, 4 miles of roads surveyed, 3 miles of railroads surveyed. Hydrography : 3 square miles of area surveyed, 2158 mllps run while sounding, 2.821 positions determined (double angles), 23,000 soundings made, 1 tidal station established, 3 tidal bench marks establlshed.

On July 1 the steamer Bache was lying at Norfolk, Va., preparing for field work, repairing and outfitting. Office work in connection with the previous field season was In progress during the month of July. During the latter part of the month a request was made by the naval authorities at Norfolk and confirmed by the Navy Department at Washington, D. C., for a detailed topographic and hydrographic survey of Sewall Point and vicinity, at which locality extensive improvements were to be made In connection with the new naval operating base. This survey wns required on account of lari;:e Improvements along the water front. The plans were for building some 18,000 feet of bulkhead, reclaiming about 350 acres, and dredging 7,000,000 cubic yards of material. To obtain the necessary data to compute the yardage moved and to locate the bulkhead and piers a close hydrographlc survey was needed, together with the establlshl!lent of numerous triangulation points. This work was started during the last few days of July and was practically completed at the time the vessel was transferred to the Navy. A triangulation scheme was observE'd rei:;tlng on Newport News Middle Ground Light and Old Point Comfort Light as a base. This scheme served to

cut in all the hydro~raphic siinals al! Well 1111 objects located on the topoiiraphic sheet. An azimuth was observed to verity the triangulation. The hydrography was executed on a scale Of 1: 5,000. Sounding lines were run on located ranges at distances approximately 100 feet apart. It was essential that these lines be run as nearly straight and parallel as possible, and great care was exercised to meet these conditions. A tide staff was established along the north shore of Sewall Point in the small lagoon. This staff was connected with the United States Army Engineers' bench mark on the Virginian Railway's pier. A topographic survey was made on a scale of 1 : 5,000 and showed the shore line and the old culture and improvements of the base at the time .the survey was being carried out, but since the survey this area has been so improved that the topographic features have been entirely changed. In connection with the development of the naval base the results of the triangulation, topography, and hydrography from this survey were used constantly and were a great aid in laying out the extensive water-front improvements and in the proper orientation of the streets and building lines. In conformity with an Executive order dated September 24, 1918, the steamer Bache, with the complement, supplies, and equipment, was transferred to the Navy Department on that date and the commanding officer reported to the commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard.

SUMMARY OF REBULTB.-Trlangulatlon: 4 square miles of area covered, 9 signal poles erected, 5 stations In main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 7 geographic positions determined. Hydrography: 25.5и square miles of area covered, 200 miles run while sounding, 1,864 positions determined (double angles), ll,891 soundings made, 1 tide station established, 1 current station occupied, 3 hydrographlc sheets finished, scales of hydrogrnphlc иsheets 1: 20,000 and 1: 10,000. Leveling: 3 miles of levels run, 2 permanent bench marks established.

On February 8, 1918, when the command of the Matchless was transferred, the vessel was undergoing general repairs at Norfolk, Va. These repairs were completed March 14. The work of outfitting the ship, taking stores on board, and securing a crew occupied the time until May 3, when the Matchless left Old Point Comfort for Westpoint, Va., arriving May 5. The hydrographlc work required at Westpoint was completed May 25, and the vessel then sailed for Gloucester Point. Work in that vicinity was taken up on arrival May 28, and was in progreSR at the close of the fiscal year. Under instructions issued in December an officer was sent to Columbia, N. C., to investigate the existence of a number of sunken logs obstructing navigation in the Scuppernong River. A special report was made on this subject. At the request of the Navy Department surveys were made to determine the depths around the coal piers at Newport News and a 29-foot spot which hacl been reported in the dredged channel in Hampton Roads leading to Newport News. These surveys were completed between April 15 and 30, and copies of the results were furnished to local naval authorities. As directed in supplemental instructions, a hydrographlc investigation was made of. the York and Mattaponi Rivers near Westpolnt, Va., and in the Mattaponi River from deep water in York River to the shipyard of the York River Ship Building Corporation. Old triangulation stations were recovered, and several objects and signals were determined by triangulation. This survey was done to enable the York River Ship Building Corporation to take vessels under construction for the United States Shipping Board from the Mattaponi River to. deep water in the York River, and to determine what dredging was needed to efl'.ect that end. Advance information of the results of this work was furnished the York River Ship Building Corporation. The hydrographic survey of York River from Gum Point to York Spit Light, made at the request of the Navy Department, and of the inshore area from York Spit Light to a junction with recently completed work south of Thimble Shoal Light, was begun May 28 and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. The location of signals and objects requested by the naval authorities was given precedence over other work. The signals below Gloucester Point were erected by the naval authorities and determined by the party on the Matchless. Above Gloucester Point the signals were erected and determined by the Coast and Geodetic Survey party, and the hydrography was begun. Lines of soundings 400 meters apart run at an anile of approximately 45 degrees with the

NORTH CAROLINA,

[N. H. HmcK, Commanding Schooner Matchless.] SUMMARY or REBULTs.-Trlangulatlon: 2 stations occupied for horizontal measures. Topography: 15 miles of shore line surveyed, 26 miles of roads and railroads surveyed. Hydrography: 56.5 mlles "of area covered, 879.2 miles run while sounding, 18,121 soundings made, 2 tide sta tlons established.

On July 1, 1917, the schooner Matchless was engaged in the hydrography of Pamlico Sound, N. C., and most of the preliminary work of signal building and triangulation had been completed. During July the hydrography and topography were actively carried on. The hydrography was of three classes: Offshore, that ls at a distance from the lowи lying Islands on the eastern side of the sound; shoal water, In depths from 2 to 10 feet, the aim of which work was to develop sloughs or narrow channels through the shoals; and over flats with less than 2 feet of water, where depths were obtained by wading. All иof the work was retarded In the early part of July by the failure of the launches. The progress of the work was found to depend largely upon the use of suitable launches. As the result of recommendations made at that time a new motor saillng launch was ordered and an excellent 32-foot, fiat-bottomed launch was leased. An observing platform was constructed on the latter launch for the purpose of bringing the eye of the observer high enough for the offshore work. Other boats of the vessel were used as signals for the work farthest from land. On July 25 the charge of the party was transferred to R. F. Luce.

SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Hydrography (wire drag) : 140 square miles of area dragged, 231.1 miles run while dragging. 1,121 positions determined (double angles), 10 soundings taken (on shoals), 520 supplemental soundings made, 1 hydrographic sheet completed, scale, 1 : 40,000.

Wire-drag work in the vicinity of the westerly Florida reefs was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year. Fort Jefferson, on I)ry Tortugas, was used us the base of operations throughout the season. 'Vhenever weather conditions permitted, work was done in the vicinity and southward of Rebecca Shoal until the easterly limit of the work was from 15 to 18 nautical miles distant from Dry Tortugas. Because of the slow speed of the launches used by the party it was found impracticable to extend the work beyond this limit. The southern limit of the work was then extended well beyond the line of shoal soundings shown on the chart, !UH! the work southward and eastward of Dry Tortugas was continued to a junction with the work in Rebecca Shoal Channel. '!'his resulted in the completion of a continuous area extending from Rebecca Shoal to Dry Tortugas and southward to the general locality of the 20fathom curve. Eighteen shoals were found in this area, all but one being in the vicinity of Rebecca Shoal. To supplement the hydrographic data in this region, soundings were obtained during the course of dragging operations from the large tender. While the drag was underway the tender ran back and forth across the drag, and soundings were obtained at certain drag buoys as directed. Euch sounding was recorded, together with the time and buoy at which it was taken, so that all soundings could be plotted on a tracing of the smooth drag sheet. About 800 soundings were obtained in this manner. A tide statr was malntuined ut Gar<len Key during the season and tidal bench marks were recovered and established on the Key. From one-hulf hour to one hour's time was saved each day on the runs to and from the working grounds by the discovery and use of a 4-foot channel across the reefs opposite Port Jefferson. On several days in September the wire-drag launches and their crews were used by the naval authorities at Dry Tortugas. The weather conditions during the season were generally favorable. This was an Important factor affecting the work In Rebecca Shoal Channel. It required from five to six hours per day to run to and from the working grounds, and good weather throughout the entire day wai. essential for the successful prosecution of this work. The chartered launches Twilight, Standard, and Starlight were used in this work. While they were the best boats available, they were not well suited for the work. Four floating signals made up of navigational buoys with superstructures were used in this work, and gave satisfactory service. A 60-foot hydrographic signal was erected on East Key and located by triangulation. To curry the work beyond the limit of visibility of these signals, a special type of floating signal was devised and constructed by the party. This signal was easily handled and found to be of umple size for the work, and during the latter part of the season was used in preference to the larger buoy signal with satisfactory results. They were securely anchored and located by sextant angles observed at the signal. и The semaphore signaling machine constructed In 1916 was used during the season with satisfactory results. Work was closed for the season on Septen11Jer 29.

[HARRY LEYPOI,DT, Commanding Steamn Hydrographer.] SUMMARY OF REsu1,Ts.-Hydrography: 175 square miles of ar<'a covered, 891 miles run while sounding, 3,118 positions determined (double angles), 32,437 soun.dlngs made.

On April 22, 1918, the command of the steamer llydrographer was transferred by F. B. T. Siems to Harry Leypoldt. The ship was then at Mobile, Ala., completing repitirs. The topographic survey of upper Mobile Bay was in progress at the time. On April 25 the Hydrographer and hired launch Acacia left for the working grounds and hydrographic work was resumed. On the following day it became necessary to return to Mobile for further repairs to the engine. On April 30 a two weeks' series of current observations was begun abreast J!~ort Mor11:an. High winds prevailed for three days, greatly influencing the currents. When the wind and sea subsided hydrography was begun in the entrance and carried westward to a junction with previous work near the western end of Dauphin Island. The topography of the southern shore of Dauphin Island was also completed. \Vhen current observations were completed the ship commenced signal building and hydrography of the outer coast from Mobile Bay entrance to the eastern limit of the topographic sheet. There was no triangulation control for this region, so resort was had to a plane table traverse from Fort Morgan to triangulation station ALA,и at the western side of Perdldo Buy. This station had been destroyed, but a reference murk (blazed tree) was recovered. The traverse checked remarkably well, there being au error of about 25 meters in distance. The ship or launch parties kept ahead of the topographer with signals and then commenced sounding without a boat sheet, the signals being as yet undetermined. The lines were fairly straight and evenly spaced. The instructions called for hydrography to the 6-fathom curve, but in places this Wll!'l close to the bench, with shoaler water offshore, so that an irregular system of lines finally resulted, as some of the earlier lines did not go offshore far enough to go beyond the outer 6-fathom curve. The shoals at the eastern side of the Mobile Bay entrance channel were WC'll developed and they appear to have undergone little change. Those to the westward apparently shift with every storm, and the Islands as charted have been washed away to a large extent, so that only a few small sand keys remain, with shonl wnter between them. On May 23 the outer hydrography and topography were completed, and the unfinished work remaining was the topography of Bon Secours Bay and a few small stretches in tne vicinity of the rivers at the head of Mobile Bay. The launch Acacia had during this time completed the hydrography of Bon Secours Bay and part of the topography of this bay, together with several areas of hydrography near the head of the bay. From May 25 to May 28 the ship was being m11de re11dy for the trip to Chesapeake Ray, while the Acacia finished the work at the . head of Mobile Bay. On May 29 the shore party was disbanded, and at 6 p. m. the Hydrographer cast off and sailed for Key West, Fla., arriving there in the late afternoon on June 1 after an uneventful trip, having made a landfall at Tampa. On June 3 the Hydrographer sailed from Tanipa for Norfolk, Va., stopping at Savannah, Charleston, and Beaufort. The ves><el arrived at Norfolk June 14.

On July 1, 1917, the steamer was temporarily laid up at New Orleans on account of lack of funds. On July 2 Instructions were received and an allotment made, and on July 7 the vessel left New Orleans to continue work in Mississippi Sound from Gulfport as headquarters. A shore party was established at Pascagoula on July 16, and continued the work begun at this point in May, 1917.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

The hydrography of Mississippi Sound was extended from the eastern limit reached at the end of June eastward to the limits of hydrographic sheet C, north of Ship Island. The hydrography between Ship Island and Chandeleur Islands was completed, except for a small portion lying' immediately east of Chandeleur Islands. и The shore party working from Pascagoula extended the hydrography from a line connection, Belle Fontaine Point, and the west end of Horn Island eastward to a line connecting the western shore of the bay immediately west of Grand Bay and a point due south of this shore on Petit Bois Island. No hydrography outside of Horn or Petit Islands was done. The topography was extended from Belle Fontaine Point to the western shore of the bay lying immediately west of Grand Bay on the north shore, and also the topography was completed of Horn Island, Petit Bois Island, Round Island, Ship Island, and that portion of Chandeleur Islands within the limits ot hydrographlc sheet C.. An automatic tide gauge was continued in operation at St. Louis Bay, and tlde;stafr readings were taken at Pascagoula and the quarantine station at Ship Island. Records were also obtained from the automatic tide gauge maintained by the Mississippi River Commission at Biloxi, Miss. Some additional offshore work was done east of South Pass, Mississippi River. Shoal soundings had been reported in this vicinity, but nothing was found to justify such reports. The command of the vessel was transferred to F. B. T. Siems on September 16, 1917.
[F. B. T. SIEMS, Commanding Steamer Hydrourapher.] SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Trlangulatlon: 182 square miles of area covered; 13 signal poles erected, 1 water signal erected, 16 stations In supplemented schemes occupied for .:orlzontal measures, 52 geographic positions determined. Leveling: 8 miles of levels run, 15 permanent bench marks established. Topography : 140 square miles of are"surveyed, 298 miles of general coast line surveyed, 162 miles ot roads surve:yed, 2 topographic sheets finished. scales 1: 40.000 and 1: 10,000. Hydrography: 950 'square miles of area sounded, 2,918 miles run while sounding, 8,864 positions determined (double angles), 111,436 soundings made, 9 tide stations established, 5 current stations occupied, 3 hydrographlc sheets finished, scale 1 : 40,000.

This report covers the period from September 16, 1917, to April 21, 1918, while the steamer Hydrographer was in command of F. B. T. Siems. The central part of Mississippi Sound, the Inlets between Ship Island and Horn Island, together with the adjoining gulf coast, and the hydrography of the gulf coast southward of Horn Island were surveyed by the party of the steamer Hydrographer from September 18 to October 11, 1917. A small area of hydrography northeast of Chandeleur Islands was also completed during this .period. The weather during September and OC'tober was generally fair, and enabled the party to work outside of Ship Island, Horn Island, and Dog Key and develop the passages between these islands under very favorable circumstances. A hurricane, the center .of which traversed the working grounds during the latter part of September, blew down several signals which had to be rebuilt later and the storm itself caused a suspension of field work for three days. The Hydrographer called at Gulfort, Miss., for coal, mall, and supplies while operating in the central part of Mississippi Sound, and after the completion of this work on October 12 the ship proceeded to Mobile, Ala., which was used as a base for operations in eastern Mississippi Sound and Mobile Bay. About the middle of October the surveys In the eastern end of Mississippi 8ound were taken up by the ship's party. Some time was necessary to recover old triangulation stations, build signals, and perform additional triangulation for determining the positions of supplementary stations and the aids to navigation marking the dredged cut through Pass aux Heron. Topographic work was begun at Cedar Point and on Dauphin Island, and was extended westward to form a junction with the completed topography. At the same time hydrographic work was begun In Pass aux Heron Channel and surrounding locality and then extended westward. A tide station was established at Beacon 8, Pass aux Heron, for the hydrography in that locality. Currents were observed at the west end of the pass for 72 consecutive hours and again for 42 consecutive hours. Combined operations in the eastern part of Mississippi Sound between Horn Island Pass and Pass aux Heron were continued during November and December, 1917, and during part of January, 1918, and Included the hydrographic и

development of the new inlet between Petit Bois Island and Dauphin Island, Born Island Pass, and the hydrography of the adjoining Gulf coast out to the 6-fathom curve. Continuous hazy and stormy weather during the winter months retarded the progress of the surveys considerably; also the field work was delayed on account of boiler trouble. The progress of the topography was slow on account of the intricate and muddy marsh areas, which make up the greater part of the north shore of Mississippi Sound. Considerable time was spent in strengthening the marking of the numerous triangulation stations in this locality, while other field work was lmposslbl.e. Tides were observed at Bayou la Batre, Horn Island Pass light, and the west end of Dauphin Island. A shore party equipped with a cllartered launch and composed of four officers and eight hands, under the direction of the commanding officer of the steamer Hydrourapher, executed certain portions of the survey of Mississippi Sound, Lake Borgne, and Mobile Bay. At the beginning of the period covered by this report the shore party continued operations in Mississippi Sound near Pascagoula, at which town the party was quartered. Horn Island Pass, the channel paralleling Horn Island, and the surrounding shoals were developed by this party during September and October. On October 21 the shore party was transferred to Bayou la Batre to assist the ship's party in the surveys of the eastern part of the sound. . During the latter part of December the shore party was transferred to Bay St. Louis for surveys in the western part of Mississippi Sound and In Lake Borgue, covered by the Superintendent's supplemental Instructions of November 30, 1917. Two new launches were chartered for this work and two additional hands were employed in the party. These surveys included the topography from Isle au Pitre to Point aux Marchettes, the hydrography northward of these shores and extending to the previously completed hydrography of the fiscal year 1917, and the redevelopment of Pass Christian and Pass Marianne Channels. On account of the exposed locality, with the prevailing north winds occurring at that time of the year, the progress of this work was necessarily sTow. Sufficient triangulation stations were recovered for the necessary control of the detailed surveys. Tides were observed at Malheureux Point and at Bay St. Louis. During January, February, and part of March, 1918, the shore party was engaged in the surveys outlined above. The survey of Mississippi Sound (with the exception of Its western portion not then completed by the shore party) and the adjoining Gulf coast to the 6-fathom curve, was completed early In January, 1918. The Hydrographer then took up the survey of Mobile Bay, under the Superintendent's instructions dated December 8, 1917. The numerous channel beacons In Mobile Bny were readily located by triangulation from recovered United States Army Engineer triangulation stations. These beacons served as excellent hydrographlc signals for the greater part of Mobile Bay, and were also very useful for the control of the topography. Considerable progress was made in the hydrography of the bay by the ship during the latter half of January. The combined operations in the central part of Mobile Bay were undertaken at that time, the plan being to leave the work at the head of the bay for the time while the ship would be repairing at Mobile dm;lng April, and the entrance and Gulf coast during the favorable weather conditions which could be expected after the repairs had been completed. During February field work In general was delayed by frequent fogs and rains. A short spell of good weather, however, enabled the party to execute the triangulation scheme of Bon Secours Bay. In order to avoid long lines of sight a иcentral point figure was used by building a signal in 11 feet of water. This triangulation was extended from the line Mobile Bay Light-Fort Morgan. Naturai objects, principally trees, antl. supplementary signals were located by triangulation for hydrographlc signals and topographic control. The topography of the east and west shores of Mobile Bay was progressing favorably while the ship was engaged in hydrography and triangulation In the proximity of the topographic party. Particular attention was given to the mapping of roads and settlements located not more than 1 mile Inland. The Hydrographer was at Mobile, Ala., from March 7 to 9 for Inspection by Prospective bidders for repairs to the vessel. The contract for the repairs, consisting principally of the installation of a new boiler, was awarded to the Alabama Dry Dock & Shipbuilding Co. on March 19, and the vessel was deltvered to the contractors on the following day. Repairs by the contractors were completed on April 16. Considerable work of cleaning and painting the

ship and ndjustments in the engine room were necessary, and the ship remained at Mobile until after the date of the transfer of the command to another officer on April 22, 1918. While.the ship wns undergoing the repairs, field parties were engaged in combined operations at the head of Mobile Bay and in the vicinity of Mobile. The triangulation of Mobile Ray was extended by a central p<>int figure for the control of the detailed surveys of the rivers at the head of the buy. Marked changeR in the hurs at the entruncl.'R of these rivers necessitated considerable development of these arPas. 'l'he topography was made difficult by the tall marsh reeds and unstable ground. In most places a plane table could not be used, and it was necessary to resort to a sextant for topographic work. A detailed survey of the water front of Mobile was made on a 1: 10,000 scale projection. The shore party completed the surveys in the western part of Mississippi Sound and in Lake Ror1,,'lle, and on March 14 proceeded to Mobile Blly for assignment to work in that locality. This party was engaged in observing currents and on inshore hydrogruphy in the central portion of Mobile Bay and 011 combined operations at the head of the bay during the last two weeks of March and the first three weeks of April. Automatic tide gauges were established at Fort Morgan and Mobile, and subsidiary tide stuffs at Great Point Clear, \Veeks Bay, and Alabama Port. Ou April 22, the date of the transfer of the command of the steamer Hydrographer to another officer, the survey of the head of Mobile Bay, includin~ Mobile, and of the greater portion of the bay itself was completed. The principal work remaining to be completed consisted of the hydrography und topography of the greater part of Bon Secours Ray, the development of the entrance of Mobile Bay, and the survey of the Gulf Coast:

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Chart-revision work In the vleinlty of Seattle, Wash., including triangulation, topography, and hydrography, wal'l In progress at the beginning of the fiscal year. и This work was done in order to show changes due to the construction by the United States Army Englneers of the Lake Washington Ship Canal connecting Puget Sound and> Lake Washington throughи Salmon Bay and Lake Union and the construction of a lock at the narrow part of Salmon Bay, the improvements making these waters a part of Seattle Harbor. The completion of this project lowered the level of Lake Washington 8 feet and raised the level of Lake Union about 10 feet. The entire waterway from Lake Washington to the lock at the western end of Salmon Bay Is now continuous, and the water level Is controlled by gates at the dam alongside the lock. A resurvey of Smith Cove was necessary-because of the recent construction of a large terminal and dock. In the southern part of Seattle the Duwamish Waterway Commission, in cooperation with the city of Seattle and King County, have straightened and deepened the Duwamish River from the head of the East and West Waterways for a distance southeastward of about 4 miles. '!'he material dredged from the :<traightened river was used to fill the old river bed and other near-by depressions. Street and railroad faclllties have been built aloug the eastern shore of the waterway, with the consequent addition of many shipyards and industrial plants. Topographic revision in the vicinity of Alki Point and West Seattle was necessary to show the various Improvements along the water front and also the :uldltion and extension of several roads and streets that improve considerably the grades in the approaches to West Seattle. The necessary triangulation consisted of a tertiary scheme fromи Salmon Bay to the Rcrnthern end of the Duwamish Waterway, crossing Smith Cove and Elllott Bay, a distance of approximately 10 statute miles. A base line was measured along the eastern side of the Duwamlsh River upon a new paved roadway. The connection between points In the vicinity of Salmon Bay with those in S.mith Cove was begun by the party of the steamer Patterson, C. G. Quillian commanding. All of the seven signals necessary to reach Smith Cove wlthcut connecting to known points across Iи~lllott Bay were built, one of the stations was completely occupied, and two partially observed by the Patterson party. In order to complete this connection with triangulation points recovered In Elliott Bay It was necessary to build 2 signals, occupy 7 complete stations, and partially observe 2 others. The complete scheme from Salmon Bay to South Park, Seattle, contains 23 main-scheme stations, of which 15 were occupied. There are 18 closed triangles, with an average closure of 2.1 seconds. The иlength of the scheme is about 10 statut~ miles, and its area 16 square statute miles. Advantage was taken of an excellent opportunity to measure a secondary bnse along the newly built brick pavement situated on the eastern side of the new Duwamish Waterway. The pavement is level and straight, except for one slight bend for over a mile, and as yet very few buildings have been erected to obscure lines of sight. The base was completely measured forward and back in two sections in two forenoons. When the work was taken over one or two d1tys' work had been done upon the topographic sheet of Shilshole Bay. The topography of the water front and shore line of the new canal .was completed through Union Bay иo Lake Washington proper. The low land between Salmon Bay and Smith Cove was surveyed, together with the shore line and water front of Smith Cove. In the western and southern part of Seattle the shore line was run from 1 mile southward from Alki Point around Duwamish Head, including East and West Waterways and the new Duwamish Waterway to Its head, about 4 statute miles from the junction of the East and West Waterways. The industrial section between the East Waterway and the high land to the eastward was concluded. The topography was all done upon a scale of 1: 5,000, and was included upon six sheets. Mucl. care was taken throughout the work to avoid errors due to distortion of the sheets, and all details were accurately located. No elevations were determined.or contours drawn, but new roads and streets, showing changes from the previous surveys, were run In. The greater part of the topography was done by Douglas Karr, junior hydrographic and geodetic engineer, with a

party of two rodmen. Street cars were used for transportation, except at a few inaccessible points, where a light auto truck was hired to carry the instruments and party. The weather conditionn were very favorable for topography throughout the summer. , The иhydrography was done upon five sheets upon a scale of 1 : 5,000. Two of the sheets include the Lake Washington Canal and adjacent waters, except Lake' Washington; another taken in Smith Cove and vicinity; and the other two embrace the Duwamish River section. In general the sounding was done on lines 50 meters apart. The boats used were loaned to the party by the steamer Explorer. In the more open waters the steam launch was used and in other localities the small whaleboat was more efficient. The conima~ding officer of the Explorer cooperated in the hydrographlc work by furnishing boa ts and men. Inshore sounding was done in Shllshole Bay and In the entire water area in and bordering the ship canal from the above bay to the cut between Portage Bay and Lake Washington. One day's work was done to locate definitely the entrance to the dredged channel of the canal from Lake Washington. Large tows of logs were found moored along the banks of the canal all the way from the Joe:. to Lake Union. The area covered by'the logs was considerable, and was sounded out by walking over the rafts and dropping the lead between the l,ogs. Lines about 60 meters apart were run throughout the work. In the southern part of Seattle the East and West Waterways were sounded with their approaches and the new Duwamlsh Waterway, with Its accessible tributaries and sllps, was de'l'eloped to tlte southern llmit of the dredging. In Smithи Cove the approaches to the docks were carefully sounded out. The hydrography was done. upon a scale of 1: 5,000 and includes five sheets. The Lake Washington Canal, Smith Canal, and Smith Cove work was done under the Immediate direction of the chief of party and the remainder was done by a party in charge of Henry Bernhardt, mate. While work was in progress in Shilshole Bay outside of the lock, tides were observed upon a staff near the northwest abutment of the Great Northern Railroad bridge. Inside of the lock .the lake levels were determined by the Army Engineers at the lock by readings taken twice each day. By obtaining copies of their records lt was possible to reduce the soundings to mean lake le'l'el, the datum adopted by the Army Engineers and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey for depths in the canal and the lakes. Two tidal stations were established upon the Duwamish River and readings taken on staffs while work was In progress. Comparisons with the values obtained from the automatic gauge maintained at Madison Street, Seattle, showed very little difference in time or range.

On May 2, 1918, preparations were begun at Portsmouth, Va., for running a line of precise l.eveling and primary traverse from the vicinity of Norfolk, Va., toward Savannah by way of Weldon and Raleigh, N. C., and Columbia, S. C. During the early part of May triangulation stations were recovered in the vicinity of Norfolk, Va., signals built, stations occupied, and a connection made with a traverse station on the Virginian Railway. Traverse stations were also selected along the Virginian Railway, signals built, and the stations occupied. During the latfer part of the month a traverse tape party and a leveling party were organized. During the latter part of May and early in June the work was much interfered with on account of labor problems. Wages paid by the Norfolk Naval Station for skilled workmen were very much higher than those paid by the Survey, and as a result many of the men left the Survey with the Intention of securing work at Portsmouth and Norfolk. Nearly all of the positions in the Survey party were filled with new men, and by June fl work was making sati'!!fnctory progress. The work was begun from the triangulation stations to theи southward of Portsmouth, aml connN:ted with the first traverse station which was f!elected near the Virginian Railway we!<t of the Elizabeth RIYer. Precise leveling was started from bench marks which had heen established at the naval station at Portsmouth. Primary traverse and precise leveling were run along the Virginian Railway to a point about 3 miles east of Suffolk; then along the Seaboard Air' Line Railway to Suffolk; then along the Virginian Railway to a point 3 miles west of Suft'olk; and. then continued along the Seaboard Air Line. By June 15 the levels were completed to a point about 5 miles to the westward of Franklin, the signal building had been completed about 15 miles to the westward of Franklin, and the tape measurement and observing party had completed work about 10 miles to the westward of Franklin. Ou June 16 the charge of the work was transferred to Max Steinberg.

The tertiary triangulation of the Cupe Fear River was begun July 9, 1917. A prelhnlnttry examinntion was made for the purpose of obtaining a knowledge of the topography of the country to be traversed and the facilities available ns to transportation, obtaining supplies, and as1dstance required in the work. Useful information and aid were obtained from the officer of the Corps of Engineers, United States Army, In charge of the improvement of the Cope Fear River and from the officer of the United States Naval Reserve in command of the Wilmington section of the sixth naval district, and from othP-r Government officials. A suitable power launch was hired for the transportatiQn of the party. After recovering as many of the stat~ons of the old triangulation as possible, a connected scheml'! of new stations was laid out, joined by suitabte triangles to the bases furnished by the lines between the old stations. Considerable difficulty wus experienced in this part of the work in Wilmington niul Its Immediate vicinity because of the changes which have occurred since the date of the former work there and also because of the extreme narrowness of the river at that point, which has the effect of making the lines very short and of correspondingly increasing the necessary number of figures. Seven stations of the triangulation of 1908 were recovered and three of the stations established in 1913. Twenty-two stations established and marke1l by the Unted States Engineers were recovered and used in the triangulation, either us regular stations or as Intersection points. Before the extension of the triangulation down the river, It was carried fo the northward as far as Point Peter, at the junction of the northeast nrnl northwest branches of the Cape Fear River, where connection was made with a permanent station of the United States Engineers. The shores of the river are generally low, frequently swampy, and for the most. part wooded, so that considerable difficulties were had in the matter of finding suitable sites for stations. Considerable clearing of trees arid brush was required and several scat'l'old signals were found necessary. Many of the stations were under water at high tide, and only three below Wilmington were much above the river level. A reconnolssance for connection by a line of traverse between the triangnlation of the Cape Fear River and the coast triangulation and for an extensi.m of the coast triangulation was made. An examination was made of tidal bench marks at Wilmington which had been connected with an automatic tide gauge estnbiished there in 1908. Five of the seven bench marks were found to be in existence in apparently good condition. Five new bench murks were establlshd and marked with brass disk markl'rs set in the walls of permanent buildings, and their elevations were determined by a double line of levels. On account of unfavorable weather, work was closed for the season on January 16, 1918.

River. The connection with the southern end of the triangulatioQ in the Cape FMr River was made by a traverl!le from the south end of Myrtle Sound across the peninsula to the river. A party was organized for establishing and marking stations and erecting signal poles. This party also staked out the base and traverse lines and prepared them for the measurements.A second party was trained for observing horizontal angles and the chief of party, when time and other conditions permitted, also took part in this work. The work was carried on in this manner until the last few days, when the hases and traverse_were measured and azimuth observed, and levellngdon~over the base and traverse lines. One small power bout and three small skiffs were used in the sounds for transporting the party. Some difficulties were encountered on account of the very shallow water in the sounds, and this was especially true ut low water when there are many of the main channels which go dry. To avoid this the work was nrrunged to suit the tides as nearly ns possible, nnd, except for a few days in Wrightsville Sound, there were only a few delays. With 34 stations occupied In the main scheme, which close 58 triangles, the average closure was 3.6 seconds with 9 seconds the mnximum. All observations, Including the azimuth, were made with the 7-inch theodolite, following the field instructions for tertiary triangulation. The time observations for the azimuth were made with a vertical circle.

Work on the primary traverse from Brunswick to Columbus, Ga., via Macon, was In progress at the beginning of the fiscal year, having been curried to within 15 miles of Macon at the end of .June. Progress made to that time is stated in the annual report for 1917, in which the methods followed are also briefly mentioned. Motor velocipede cars were used for the transportation of the party. During the season Lieut. Francisco Stewart, of the Argentine Naval Commission, visited the party for the purpose of inspecting the work with 11,ivar tapes. On July 31 the charge of the party w11s transferred to George D. Cowie, the work having then reached the vicinity of Fort Valley, Ga.
(GEORGE D. COWIE.] SUMMARY OF RlllSULTs.-Prlmary reconnolssance (traverse) : 8 stations selected for main scheme. Primary traverse: 89 miles of traverse run, 87 stations occupied for horizontal measures. Azimuth: 2 azimuth stations occupied. Levellng: 23 miles of levels run.

The primary traverse party which had been under the charge of C. V. Hodgson operating between Brunswick and Fort Valley, Ga., was on August 1 transferred to George D. Cowie, who continued the work in the same manner as before. и Five motor cars were used for transportation of the party, instrumentR, and equipment on this work. These did not give satisfactory service, owing to frequent breakdowns and overloads. The primary traverse line from Fort Valley to Upatoi, Ga., was in a hilly country, and many curves delayed the work, on account of many short tangents and frequent scaling of high banks to reach the traverse stations. At Upatoi the traverse was changed to triangulation, and a connection was made with the triangulation stations of the party under charge of E. H. Pagenhart. While this trlan~latlon and l!lignal bulldini was beini completed, a preliminary reconnoisliflnce from Macon to Atlanta was made by R. V. M1ller, which indicated that the line should follow the Central of Georgia Railway tracks from Macon toward Atlanta and change to triangulation when ground was favorable.

At Upatoi a connection was made with a traverse station of the United States Geological Survey. Azimuth was obs11rved Rt Station "Fort" near Fort Valley and at a station near Butler, Ga. и On completing the work toward Columbus the party returned to Macon and started from some of the tr1tverse stations, previously determined, traversing t? a hill near the city reservoir, and then by secondary triangulation carried the hne across the city to points north of Macon near Vineville Station, thereby avoiding a very crooked track, short tangents, and numerous signals. The points occupied in Macon were college towers. By the end of September the line was carried to a point nearи Forsyth, Ga., and reconnolssance for primary triangulation from this point to stations on the eastern oblique arc of triangulation near Atlanta was practically completed. As G. D. Cowie was transferred to the Coast Artillery Corps on the 24th of September, the work was placed in shape to turn over to 0. W. Ferguson on the 30th. Forked stakes were used to stretch the tape and later a form of stake designed by Mr. Pagenhart, which was an improvement. The progress when the party was not engaged in triangulation was at the rate of approximately 70 miles per month.

Triangulation: 785 square miles of area covered, 87 signal poles erected, 18 observing scalfolds and tripods built (avera1e height 28.77 feet), 11 stations In main scheme occupied for horizontal angles, 49 traverse stations occupied, 79 geog'raphlc positions determined. Leveling : 226 miles of levels run, 205 permanent bench marks established.

By July 1, 1917, the line of precise levels from Brunswick, Ga., toward Macon, Ga., had been completed to 5 miles eastward of Eastman, Ga., and by July 26 the line was completed to Macon. Between July 27 and August 10 leveling was completed on a line from Macon to near Fort Valley; between August 17 and September 20 a line was completed between Macon and McDonough, Ga. ; und between September 26 and October 22 a line from Macon to Griffin, Ga., иwas completed. Motor cars were used for the transportation ofи the party and equipment, permission to use them having been obtained from the Southern Railroad Co., on condition of the employment of a conductor. Adding machines were used for recording level. readings. The highest points at centers of the rails were at first used for rod supports. After reaching Macon the spikes were used for rod supports. Standard bench marks were placed about every fourth mile. The traverse station marks were all determined as bench marks, and disk bench marks were set in railroad stations and other suitable places in every town, so that the average distance between bench marks ls not more than 1 mlle. On September 26 charge of the party previously under the direction of G. D. Cowie engaged In traverse and triangulation work between Macon and Atlanta, Ga., was transferred to Mr. Ferguson. It had been planned to run a line of traverse from Macon to Forsyth and another, for a base, from Barnesvllle to Griffin, and to execute a scheme of triangulation from Forsyth to Atlanta. As soon as the precise leveling had been done and stations had been selected observations were begun on the triangulation. On December 13 in accordance with instructions most of the party was transferred to Macon to work on the traverse from Macon to Savannah. Part of the force had been detached about a month before to begin this traverse work. On January 16, 1918, the party was transferred to Jasper S. Bilby.

of traverse line had been prepared, and tape measurements made over the prepared portion of the line. About 30 per cent of the measured line was on stakes, and as no stake levels had been run and most of the stakes had been removed by persons living in the vicinity, it was necessary to restake and remeasure that part of the line. An inspection of the line of work showed that it would be necessary to have two parties to keep up the observing, and on account of car shortage It was not practicable to carry on the building, taping, stake leveling, keep two observing parties at work, and have cars for the precise leveling work. It was therefore necessary to postpone the leveling and to purchase new cars. As the carsиwhich had been In use were not suitable for the work, <'ars of a new type were obtained, and these were found satisfactory in every way. During the month of February there were five subparties at work, us follows: One building party of 1 foreman-hand and 2 men, taping party of 7 men, stakeleveling party of observer and 1 man, and two observing parties, each consisting of 1 observer and 3 men. J<Jarly In March a precise leveling party was organized, which consisted of the observer and 4 men. On March 22 the building, tape measurements, and stake leveling were completed to Savannah, and soon afterwards a second leveling party was organized, the leveling and observing was carried on, and by April 20 the observing had been completed. All field records were brought up to date and forwarded to the office. On May 1 the two levellnl? partle;i were left to complete the levels to Savannah and other members of the party moved to Portsmouth, Va., tp take up work in that v.fclnlty. By May 20 the levels were completed to Savannah, the records were forwarded to the office, and the leveling parties moved to Virginia. The line of traverse and precise leveling between Macon and Savannah was run over the following-named railroads: Macon to Dublin, Macon, Dublin & Savannah Ry. ; Dublin to Brewton, Wrightsville& Tennille Ry. ; Brewton to Statesboro, Central of Georgia Ry. ; Statesboro to Cuyler, Savannah & State;iboro Ry.; and Cuyler to Savannah, Seaboard Air Line Railway. The length of the line is about 175 miles. There are 205 primary stations, and nearly all stations of the primary traver;ie were made precise level bench marks. In arldltlon to the traverse station bench marks, a precise level mark was establisherl in each town along the line of work.

The traverse work In progress on June 36 In the vicinity of Wllllnghnm, Ga., was continued to Albany nlong the Atlantic Coast Line Rnllway, a distance of about 12 miles, and from Albany to Columbus over the Seaboard A.Ir Line tra:cks. The tape work was finished to Columbuиs on August 25, and construction work was completed August 31. On September 1 the party was turned over to another officer. On the date of transfer all of the work on the line had been completed with the exception of the observing, which was finished to the vicinity of Richland, leaving about 80 statlone to be observed. From Kimbrough to Columbus, the last 45 miles of the line, there Is almost an entire separate scheme carried along the hllls near the track to control the azimuth of the track stations. At Albany, Dawson, and Parrott the controlling azimuth was carried through lines by omitting some of the track stations. Triangulation stations Cusseta and Columbus, which are Rltnated on commanding hills near the railway to control the azimuth, will be connected with triangulation station Rich, near Upatoi, a station on the Brunswick line. At Columbus the traverse expands into a five-point figure. Two of these иstations were needed for control. The three additional ones were located on bare hills where only Instrument stands were needed. This gave convenient points for later work.

The party under charge of E. H. Pagenhart, engaged in running a line of primary traverse from Jacksonville, Fin., to Columbus, Ga., was, on September 1, 1917, transferred to Clem L. Garner, with Instructions to run a line of primary traverse from Albany, Gn., toward Callahan, Fla., where eonnect!on was to be made with the Jacksonville-Columbus line of primary traverse rompleted earlier In the year. The party was taken to Albany, the starting point of the work, where the motor cars to be used In the work were repaired. The traverse was begun September 4 and was continued to the south over the Georgia Northern Railway. This railroad ls very crooked and contnlns on nn average li curves to the mile, some of which are very Jong. The country ls heavily wooded In patches and, being only slightly rolling, triangulation wus not practicable.. On September 29, 1917, the party was transferred to M. E. Lutz, at Doerun, Ga. The progress to that time was 25 miles. The character of country and the very crooked road caused the lines between 1ubsldlary stations to be slightly shorter than the average and also made necessary n great deal of clearing and staking In order to get around the curvPR. The azimuths tor control, however, were always on lines more than a mile long, nnd the stations for these azimuths were strongly tied Into the subsidiary stations, thus forming b. very strong system of control.

SuMMAJIY OF BllSULTB.-Preclse leveling: 208.8 miles of levels run, 130 permanent b1>nch marks established.

On July 12, 1917, the charge of the precise-leveling party previously under charge of C. L. Garner at work on the line between Jacksonvllle, Fla., snd Columbus, Ga., was transferred to Max Steinberg, at Columbus, Ga. The llne was then continued along the Central of Georgia Railway to Bliss, Ga., to ronnect with the line run by 0. W. Ferguson from Brunswick, Ga. On August 10, after connection had been made with the line from Brunswick, Ga., the party was moved to Albany, Ga., a distance of 80 miles. On August 11 work wa'!! TM'gun on the Albany-Callahan line. The route lay along the Georgh1 Nortbt'!rn, Valdosta, Moultrie & Western and the Georgia Southern & Florida Rallroads by way of Albany, Moultrie, and Valdosta, Ga., to Callahan, Fla. The line was carried es far as Council, Ge., on October 5. The party was then transferred to M. E. Lutz, to be continued by him in connection with the traverse over the same Une. In order to furnish the required information for the traverse party It wni'I necessary to determine the elevation of the top of the rail at each point of curve, point of tangent. and opposite all permanent and temporary bench mark!I. Certain sections of the line were found to be a continuous series of curves. Between Albany and Moultrie, a distance of 88 miles, there were 68 curve!'!, The progress of the party was necessarily retarded. Throughout the entire season conductors furnished by the raJ.lroads were employed In the party. Permanent bench marks were set on the average about 1.6 miles apart.

Between April 1 and May 22, 1918, connection was made by primary triangulation between the primary traverse at Griffin, Ga., and the oblique arc of primary triangulation In the vicinity of Atlanta, Ga. This work began on the line Wis&-Jackson, which was a line of the first quadrilateral projected from the traverse between stations Hog Mountain and Wise as a base. The country In this vicinity Is rollln11:, with few hills of any prominence and heavily wooded in patches, which often occur on the tops of the hllls, and necessitated the bullding of structures in order to bridge over them. Some stations for the continuation of this scheme had been established and structures built over them. It was found, however, that several of the stands and scaffolds were blown down and that several of the proposed lines were not visible. At!I a result the entire scheme was changed. The length of lines was made to average about 12 miles, which reduced the length considerably from that originally proposd and proved to be a more economical length of line In a

country where haze and poor atmospheric conditions for observing prevail. With this length of line and the large electrk lamps, few delays are to be expected on account of haze and bad seeing. Two building parties of four men each were organized, while the chief of party did the reconnoissance and selected the stations. The work was delayed for about 10 days during the first part of April while иthere was a dense haze and smoke which made it impossible to determine the visibility of lines more than 6 mlles long. Fortunately, the entire party was not delayed this amount of time, for several stations had been selected and the structures were put up during this time. On the completion of the reconnoissance the building parties were drawn upon for enough men to begin the light keeping and recording, and only two men were left to complete the building. This was very practical, since the structures after this time were mostly small and could be well managed even by one man. Trucks and automobiles se<'Ured from local places were used In the transportation. The equipment for the observing was practically the same as for the ordinary primary triangulation party except for trucks which have generally been used for transporting the party from place to place. On this 'Work the light keepers moved by train, mostly hiring teams or automobiles to take them from station to railway, and vice versa. The observing party, for the most part, used Ford cars for carrying instruments from station to station. In addition to the usual equipment all light keepers were given a large electric lamp and batteries for use during bad haze or other atmospheric conditions which made seeing difficult. The acetylene lamps were used during ordinary conditions, since they were considerably more economical than the electric lamps. The total number of stations occupied was 18, requiring one month from the time the observations were started until they were completed and the party left for other work In North Carolina. The average closure for the work consisting of 18 triangles was 1.5 seconds, or a little more than that called for in primary triangulation. Considering, however, that the connection to the south was with a llne of traverse over very_ crooked road where the accuracy could by no means be compared to the triangulation, It seemed inadvisable to reoccupy stationsи to reduce this mean closure.

On January 1, 1918, active preparations were In progress for running a primary traverse and precise level line from Savannah, Ga., иto Everett City, Ga., in compliance with instructions dated December 11, 1917. The route of this primary traverse and precise level line followed the main line of the Seaboard Air Line Railway from Savannah, Ga., to Everett City, Ga., and the level line was extended from Everett City, Ga., to Yulee, Fla. The latter section of the line was not covered by primary traverse. This work was through timbered and marshy country, which was practically level. The conditions for traverse and leveling were ideal. The highest slgnal that It was found necessary to erect on this line wasи 1s feet in height. This work was pushed to completion rapidly, and on January 28 lnstructtons were received to take up the work of extending primary traverse and precise levels from Savannah, Ga., to Norfolk, Va. On about February 8 the traverse work waa completed to Everett City and the construction and traverse parties started working northward on the Une toward Norfolk. The leveling party continued on to Yulee. Permits had not been received for the use of motor cars on the main line northward from Savannah, and the work was carried forward for the ftrst month and one-half by using local passenger trains as much as possible for the transportation of parties to and from the field, whlle the construction work whleh involved the transportation of materials Qf course could not be prosecuted In this manner. A H-ton truck was rented in Savannah, and the construction work was pushed to a point 80 miles north of Savannah by this means.

The observing party bad progressed on the Albany-Callahan line to Moultrie, Ga., at the fl.ret of the year. During the early part of January two observers were put on this work, so that this branch of the work would not lag l!IO far behind. By the first of April the observing had been completed on the AlbanyCallahan line, and was nearing completion on the Savannah-Everett line. As it became necessary to secure more transportation of some kind in order to prosecute the work on the line north, the question was taken up with the superintendent of the Seaboard Air Line Railway system of getting permission for the use of motor cars. After some delay the desired permission to operate cars was granted. The motor truck was returned from Olar, S. C., to Savannah, and the motor cars, which had been laid up for two months, were put into use again. The country over which this truck was used was decidedly unfavorable for its use, and it was put to a severe test. The roads were poor, the main dimculty being sand hub deep which would slow up and stall anything but the strongest car. It was necessary to run in low gear the greater portion of the time. Even with all these obstacles in the way of eMclent transportation, it can be said for the truck that it is a feasible method of carrying on the work, but slower and more costly than by using motor velocipedes on the rallway. The conditions were unfavorable for the truck in that the highways dld not par!lllel the railway, and it was frequently necessary to make long detours to where the road .crossed the railway in an effort to get material for. signal building to the proper location. The route of the primary-traverse and precise-level line northward from Savannah followed the main line of the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Of the work covered to the end of the fiscal year, that section lying between Savannah~ Ga., and Norway, S. 0., was Ideal for traverse and levels. The country throughout this belt is level, fairly heavlly timbered, and there are but few curves. From Norway, S. 0., to Blaney, s. C., where the work had progressed at the end of the fiscal year, the country becomes more hilly and the conditions for traverse work are rather unfavorabl~ln some places dimcult. Numerous long and sharp curves are encountered. It was necessary to carry a main scheme azimuth .through this section somewhat Independent of the tape work on the track but tied to the tape work at each main scheme station. The main scheme was carried through, however, without excessive bulldlq, the highest signal being 86 feet in height: It was necessary, however, to construct a. number Of signals Of this height. On February 21 иinstructions were received to make connection between the line of primary traverse passing the city of Savannah and the. triangulation e;:tsttng along the Savannah River. While other work was in progress this connection was made by the establishing of three quadrilaterals. On March 21 Instructions were received for makin.g a connection with the primary traverse line extending from Augusta, Ga., to Beaufort, S. C., via Fairfax, S. O. In order to carry out these instructions it was necessary to run a spur Une of the primary traverse and precise levels to Allendale, S. O. At the close of the fiscal year all branches of the work were under WB.J at a Point near Blaney, S. C.

On October 1, 1917, the primary traverse party which had been under the charge of O. L. Garner was transferred to Melvin E. Lutz.

& Western Railway to Valdosta, Ga.; thence via the Georgia, Southern & Florida Railway to Crawford, Fla. ; thence via the Seaboard Air Line to Callahan, Fla., connecting at that point with the Jacksonville-Columbus primary traverse and level line. The entire work was through timbered country which, in general, was practically level. From Bridgeboro to Moultrie, on the Georgia Northern Railway, conditions for traverse work were only fair, as many sharp curves and rather steep grades were encountered. The main scheme, however, was curried through this section without excessive building, the highest signal being 36 feet In height. From Moultrie to Valdosta, a distance of 42 miles, conditions for primarytraverse work were also fair, some of the way very good. In some sections, however, numerous sharp curves were encountered. Through this section the main scheme was also curried forward without excessive building, the highest signal again being 36 feet in height. From Valdosta to Callahan the work was carried forward under almost ideal conditions, the highest signal required being only 10 feet. One tangent 20 miles in ~gth facilitated progress very much. The best day's work for lnvar-tape measurements, under the most favorable conditions, was 7 miles of completed line. This distance was measured without working excessive hours and without undue fatigue to the members of the party. It was accomplished by a thorough coordination of each man's work so that there was no lost motion. As previous experience proved that 2! to 3 miles gave the most economical length of line for construction and observing, this length was adhered to throughout the progress of the work. It had also been found that very substantial tripods up to 36 feet in height could be built out of 2 by 4 lumber. Careful Q,ttentlon was paid to the carrying through of a main-scheme azimuth where short lines were encountered, so that this portion of the work would not be weakened. The shortest main-scheme line establlshed Is seven-eighths of a mile in length. When the primary-traverse work was carried forward to Fargo, Ga., the precise-level party was again organized and the levels were carried through to Callahan simultaneously with the primary traverse. и At the time of the transfer of the party, observations on the JacksonvllleColumbus primary-traverse line had not been completed,' and the observer wa11 working in the vicinity of Columbus, Ga. It took one montfl., or until the lat ot November, to complete the observation and azimuth work on that line. Early in November the observer accordingly started on the Albany-Callahan llne, and at the close of the calendar year had advanced as far as Moultrie, Ga. Motor velocipedes were used throughout as a means of transportation. Altogether the party иhad eight motor velocipedes. On December 11 instructions were received to establish primary-traverse and precise-level line between Savannah, Ga., and Everett City, Ga. By December 17 the construction and invar-tape measurement!!! had been completed to Callahan, Fla., on the Albany-Callahan line, and this portion of the party moved to Savannah, Ga., to take up work on the new line. The precise-level line was completed to Callahan, Fla., on December 22. At the close of the calendar year active preparations and outfitting were under way for the Savannah-Everett City line.

SUMMARY OP' RlllSULTS: Precise leveling: 498 miles of levels run, 806 permanent bench marks established.

The line of levels completed by this party between January 18 and June l, 1918, extends from Sinton, Tex., by way of the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railroad to Houston, Tex. ; then continues eastward over the Southern Pacific Railroad to New Orleans. Rpur lines were run to the Gulf coast from Placedo to Port Lavaca, Tex., over the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway; Bay City to Matagorda, Tex., over the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway; Angleton to Freeport, Tex., over the Houston & Brazos Valley Rallroad; Beauи mont to Sabine Pass, Tex., over the Southern Pacific Railroad. On June 1 the party was transferred to Casper M. Durgin. At that time the line was completed to Estherwood, La. The above work, as well as that previously reported upon during this year, was done at the request of the Chief of IiJnglneers of the United States Army to furnish vertical control for topographic surveys. . At Sinton the Une was started from three Coast and Geodetic Survey bench mar~s established several months earlier. Connection was made with three Coast and Geodetic Survey bench marks at Houston, Tex. Connections were also made with one tidal bench mark at Quintana, Tex., ~vePal United States Geological Survey bench marks on the Southern Pacific Railroad east of Houston, one United States Army Engineer bench mark on the west abutment of the Texas & New Orleans Railroad bridge at Beaumont, Tex., and with tbe line of United States Geological Survey bench marks on the Southern Pacific Railroad east of Jennings, La. A careful search was made for the old tidal bench marks established by the Survey at Matagorda and Velasco, but only one, the top of an iron pipe of an artesian well at Quintana, near Velasco, could be found. The termiи nals of the spur llnes to the coast were well marked with plates in permanent structures and will doubtless be easlly recovered for use in connection with future hydrographlc work. The officials of the Southern Pacific Railroad having refused permission for the -operation of our motor cars over that road between Houston and New Orleans, on account of the heavy traffic and frequent fogs, the motor cars were shipped to C. L. Garner, at Wilmington, N. C. The party then proceeded to level on foot. A motor truck was secured for use ln carrying the observing party to and from work. This was found to be very convenient as long as the highway Paralled the rallroad. Permanent bench marks were placed on the average of 1Д miles apart Many of the temporary marks on the Southern Pacific line, such as corners of concrete bases of fairly massive block signals, are of a permanent character and can be readily recovered, but are not m~rked. The total number of permanent and temporltry bench marks were placed on the average of one bench mark to eight-tenths of a mile. Of the permanent marks, 122 are square concrete posts With the standard metal disk set flush with the top. One hundred and eightyи four standard metal plates were set in buildings, bridge abutments, and concrete culverts.

Tex., to Estherwood, La., 28 miles west of Lafayette, La., with spur llnes from the main line to the following pieces: Port Lavaca, Tex. ; Matagorda, Tes:.; Velasco, Tex.; and to Sabine Pass, Tex. During the month of June, 1918, this line of levels was continued along the main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad. from Estherwood, La., to Jeanerette, La., a distance of 61.6 miles. A- motor truck was used for the transportation of the party, and, although not *> well adapted to the work as the motor-velocipede cars, was found to be very efficient, except for the 10 miles between Rayne, La., and Scott, La., where the highway left the railroad and was in poor condition as a result of heavy rains. The truck was laid up on two occasions for. repairs, once for a period of 12 days. At these times it was necessary to make use of railroad trains or hired automobiles. In a few cases the railroad trains were the only recourse, as the roads were unfit for travel. During the latter part of the month, however, there was very little rain and a good highway followed very closely to the railroad. The number of permanent bench иmarks established during the month of June was 48, making an average of 1 permanent bench mark to every h\miles. Of these bench marks 22 were plates set either in brick buildings or In concrete abutments of railroad or highway culverts. Seven concrete posts were set and 2 bench marks were established on the concrete bases of block signalR. A llne of precise levelR made by the United States Geological Survey In 1906 followed the Southern Pacific Railroad throughout the E>ntlre section of the line run during the month of June, and 15 of the permane1it bench marks set at that time were recovered and connected with.

At the cloRe of the tlsC'ul year .Tune 30 a party had been organized and equipped at Harlingen, Tex., to make a reconnoissance and build signals and Instrument stands In preparation for an observing party on the Rio Grande arc of primary triangulation. Onи July 2 the party moved to Rtatlon Donna near the town of Donna, Tex., where a 60-foot signal was erected and work begun. The building party was divided Into two subparties, each consisting of one foreman and three handR. Each of the subparties was provided with one Packard ii-ton truck, one team of mules and wagon, one White 1-ton truck, and the necessary tools and miscellaneous outfit. Thl.s organization was maintained rlnrlng. the month of July while engaged In bullrllng large signals in the Rio Grande Valley between Donna and Rio Grande City. The trucks were U!'led for hauling all material, lumber, and supplleR, no extra transportation being supplied. The men employed on the actual building work also drove the trucks and team. Early In August the number of hands waR reduced on account of the C'hRnJ.(ed conditions and character of the country, which made it Impracticable to eontlnue the use of large tripod and scaffold signals. One Packard truck and one White truck were turned over to the chief of the observing party. The reconnolssance was executed by the chief of party alone, using a 011ehalf ton truck for transportation of himself and of the necessary Instruments, tools, bedding, and cooking utensils. The chief of part:v also hadи persc)Jtal charge of all transportation of material and Rupplles for the two subparties. The work was begun from stations Donna-Rio.

Reconnoissance and signal building having been sufficiently advanced and necessary repairs having been made to the automobile trucks used for the transportation of the party, observations were begun August 28 in the vicinity of Harlingen, Tex., on the arc of primary triangulation westward along the Rio Grande River. The reconnolssance provided a very small scheme of triangulation with lines about 10 or 12 miles long at the beginning and decreasing to half that length after five or six figures. At first the country traversed was partly Irrigated, with considerable native mesquite growth 80 or 40 feet high, but farther west the height of the vegetation was not more than 20 or 80 feet. The towers wer" a corresponding height, varying from 00-foot tripods with a 20-foot superstructure at the beginning to stands and 85-foot tripods with 20-foot superstructure farther west. Owing to tpe difficulty of' obtaining' lumber and the cost of transportation, the towers were very lightly constructed, the 85-foot tripods having legs made up of only two by four pieces spliced together. This method of building was found to give Insufficient stabillty In azimuth to the tripod tn high winds. Three automobile trucks were used for the transportation of the party. The party left Harlingen for the first station on August 28 and closed observations to prepare for the transfer of the party on September 28. Dur1ng tbat period 19 primary stations were completed and 61 miles of progress were made through the center of the scheme. In this work an 8-lnch Wanscbatr direction theodolite belonging to Columbia University was used, Instead of the usual 12-incb theodolite, with satisfactory results. Thirty-three triangles gave an average closure of 0.91 second and a maximum of 2.51 9ee0mls with one reoccupation 'for closure. The azimuth station, a Laplace station with two night observations, gave a probable error for the station of 0.17 second. и Field work was closed Septemben 28, and arrangements were made for the transfer of the party to 0. L. Garner.

The reconnolssance work was started at Marfa on October 15, and was continued toward the southeast to a point near the Dryden base Une, where the work was joined later to that of .T. S. Bllby. About November 4 the party returned to Marta and started work on the triangulation. On March 2 the triangulation was completed to a point near Del Rio, Tex., where It joined the work of the other party under O. L. Garner, who had been working westward on the eastern end of this same arc. Mr. Pagenhart then reorganized his party Into a base-line party and lltarted work on the measurement of five base lines along the Rio Grande arc. These were completed about April 20, and Mr. Pagenhart, with a part of his party, proceeded to Harlingen, Tex., to do precise leveling. Between April 26 and May 17 check levels were run from a bench mark near Robstown to a bench mark near San Benito to locate an error of 1 meter In the precise-level line between Sinton and Brownsville, Tex. 85t524-18-7

SUMMARY Ol!' RESULTS.-Trlangulatlon : 8 oOO square miles of area covered, 4 signal poles erected, 4 observing scnt'l'olds and tripods bullt, 79 stations In main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 79 stations occupied for vertical measures, 215 geographic positions determined, 200 elevations determined trlgonometrically, length of scheme 275 miles. Aalmuth : 5 azimuth stations occupied.

Between October 3, 1917, and March 2, 1918, observations were made In the primary triangulation along the Rio Grande arc from a point 5 miles west of Rlogrande to the vicinity of Del Rio, Tex., a total distance along the line of progress c,f 275 miles. Seventy-nine stations in the main scheme were occupied for horizontal and vertical measures, five of which were azimuth stations. "The work of this party closed about 20 miles northwest of Del Rio, Tex., where the observations were joined to those of E. H. Pagenhart, who made the reconnolssance and observations for the western end of the arc. Intersections were measured on many objects In the usual manner for the purpose of locating them geographically, and when at all possible a third Intersection was taken to act as a check. With the exception of objects In the towns and the few mountain peaks in Mexico, practically all of these objects were wlndmllls. For that reason they were very difficult to identify, and this could only be done by plotting them on a progress sketch. It ls believed, however, that enough of these can be sufficiently well identifl.ed to give very good control for any future work In that country. ии Several mountain ranges in Mexico were visible from the vicinity of the work and as many of these peaks were determined as possible. They were long distances away and were rarely sufficiently visible for definite polntlngs, and never clearly enough seen for vertical measures, except at the very worst hour of the day, viz, about dusk. For that reason very few vertical measures were made on them. All of the instruments used were of the same character as those previously used on primary triangulation, excepting the theodollte, which и,7as an 8-inch Wanschaff direction theodolite with an exposed circle 2 micrometers 180 degrees apart .and a stride level with a value of slightly more than 9 seconds for each division of the bubble. White trucks Nos. 3 and 4 and a H-ton Packard truck loaned the Coast and Geodetic Survey by the quartermaster at Fort Sam Houston were used for transportation of the party and equipment from the beginning of the work until January 5, 1918, when the Packard truck was called for by the quartermaster. This was immediately delivered to the proper authorities and in Its place a light three-fourths ton Republic truck was loaned by the department engineer at Fort Sam Houston, Tex. This was returned to the department engineer at the close of the work during the first of March, 1918. The use of three trucks was made necessary on account of the character of the country, and proved a very economical and efficient method. It has been the custom lo the past to use two trucks to move the observing party, while the llght keepers traveled by train and wagon or other conveyance, as the condltlons afforded. This .was when the scheme of triangulation was large and a third truck could not make the moves as quickly as they could be made by other travel. In this work, however, the scheme was small, with the average length of llne about 10 miles across a country where the railroad fac.illties were of little use and where very few people live. The use of a third truck in this case was about the only solution and worked very satisfactorily. Thie method was started by Mr. Hodgson and was continued to the end of the During the season of five months 79 stations In the main scheme were occupied, with an average of 16 stations per month. There were 175 triangles closed, with an average closure at the end of the season of 0.995 second. For the first three and one-half months of the season the average closure was 4.93 seconds, but It was increased at the end of the work on account of unfavorable weather and poor conditions for observing in genei:al.

The party under charge of J. D. Powell was working from Del Rio to the eastward, and had made about 100 miles of progress by June 30, 1917. On July 18 Instructions were Issued to Mr. Powell, then at Del Rio, after finishing the work contemplated by his original instructions, to continue alone the line of levels to San Antonio, Tex., and run a spur line of precise levels from Spo1Tord to Eagle Pass. On September 26 Mr. Powell, who had then moved to San Antonio, was directed to transfer the charge of the precise-leveling party and outfit to Douglas Karr, ,и;ho assumed charge of the party on October 13. The headquarters of the party was then at Pearsall, Tex. The party was operating along the line of the International & Great Northern Railway between San Antonio and Laredo, and the work had progressed to a point about 1 mile south of Natalie, Tex.

The work, which had then progressed to a point about a mile south of Natalie, Tex., was continued toward Laredo, and the line was completed about December 31. Two motor cars were used in this work, to which they were well adapted. T!1e level tripod was mounted on one of these cars and the adding machine on the other. Standard Coast and Geodetic Survey bench-mark disks were set in numerom1 иmbstantial stone or concrete structures along the line, and Umestone posts were Used as additional bench marks and set approximately every 2 miles along the line, and as nearly as practicable at the even mileposts. These posts were set so as to project about 6 inches out of the ground. ~~or temporary bench mark ratlroad-track spikes were driven in telegraph poles at or near the odd-numbered mileposts.

miles of levels run, 110 permanent bench

At the beginning of July, 1917, .a line of precise levels was being run along the Southern Pacific Railroad eastward from Tesnus, Tex. The work was continued during July until It joined the line run by John D. Powell at Meyers Canon No. 2 Bridge on July 27. . In accordance with Instructions the party was then moved to San Antonio, .'!'ex., and began a line of precise levels from New Braunfels southward toward Brownsville, Tex. The line from New Braunfels to San Antonio was carried over the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway. From San Antonio to Sinton lt was carried over the Sen Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway. Permanent bench marks were established In all of the principal railroad stations In San Antonio. They were also placed at or near every even-numbered milepost along the railroads and in the buildings In the principal cities. These bench marks consisted of a standard United State~ Coast and Geodetic Survey brass bench mark set in 6-inch diameter concrete posts about 6 Inches above the ground, or In the outcropping country rock, or in stone or concrete bridges. culverts, etc., or In the foundations of the buildings. Temporary bench marks were established at or near every odd-numbered milepost. These consisted of railroad spikes driven in the telegraph poles, brld~s. culverts, etc. Sometimes only one spike was driven In the pole and sometimes three, two to serve as a protection for the one used as a bench mark. On October 5 0. W. Swalnson received orders from the War Department t:o report at the Coast Artillery School at Fort Monroe, Va., and on that date the charge of the party was turned over to H. G.

The level line at that time had been completed to a point 15 miles north of Sinton, Tex., on the San Antoni.o & Aransas Pass Railroad. Upon completing the line to Sinton work was begun on the line south of Sinton toward Brownsville, Tex. From Sinton to Brownsville, Tex., 162 miles, the line follows the sиt. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway through a perfectly level and unbroken country. The principal towns along the railway are Robstown, Kingsvllle, Riviera, Raymondville, Harllngen, and San Benito. At Robstown, Tex., a 25-mlle spur was run to Corpus Christi over the Texas & Mexico Railway to connect with the United States Engineer bench marks at that place. From Brownsville, Tex., the llne was extended 22 miles to Point Isabel, Tex., over the tracks of the Rio Grande Railway and connection was made with the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the United States Geological Survey bench marks at that place. A cylindrical cement post weighing about 75 pounds, with a disk in the top, was used for a permanent bench mark where there were no buildings or other structures available for placing the disk. The condition of reco-.ered bench marks showed very plainly that a stone or cement bench mark having sharp corners should not be used. Any corner or projection invites mutllatlon. Spikes in telegraph poles were used almost entirely as temporary bench marks.

During the year the work of the Cheltenham Magnetic Observatory was continued as outlined in previous annual reports. :All of the observatory instruments were in satisfactory operation. Thirty-four earthquakes were recorded during the year. On September 27 and 28 the periods of both components of the seismograph were reduced to 15 seconds, which ls as short a period as can be obtained with the present mounting and range of adjustment. Styluses constructed from the indices of minimum thermometers suitably mounted have proven a great improvement over styluses having wire for the recording points in that the friction ls materially reduced. It is understood that some seismological stations are using satlsfactorlly metal styluses with rounded points. In March, 1918, it was found necessary to forward the large earth inductor No. 26 to the office for repairs to the commutator. Since its replacement af Cheltenham, the inductor has performed very satisfactorlly. Magnetometer No. 26 and Cooke magnetometer No. 40 were compared by means of 10 sets of observations during February. The relationship between these magnetometers appears not to have changed since No. 40 was purchased in 1915. During Aprll a series of observations was made with the D and Z variometers of magnetograph No. 5 to redetermine the Z distribution factor and to determine the effect of the slight eccentricity of the deflector with reference to Its carriage. Of the four distances used, three gave perfectly consistent scale values, while the distance 26 centimeters gave an abnormally high value. This effect has been attributed to a roughnesF.1 or an irregularity of theи pivots ot the z magnet ln the posltlon corresponding to the deflections at that distance. No change in the distribution factor was indicated. As regards the slight differences between the distances .of the magnets due to carriage, the deflections did not always confirm the measurements. To avoid any error from this cause the magnet carriage ls used in direct and reversed positions during deflections. Beginning with November, 1917, the values of H derived from both magnetographs on the days of absolute observations have been plotted, thus providing a correct Idea of the behavior of the two variometers. On May 15, 18и sets of dip were made with earth Inductor No.и 26 at half-hour intervals during the day. From these observations and the mean Z иbase line a diurnal curve of H иWas derived. The tact that the curve thus derived fitted ln between the H curves plotted from the variometers would Indicate that earth Inductor No. 26,is capable of determining the dip with a high degree of accuracy.

Earth inductor No. 22 was compared with No. 26 on May 7 and 21, the mean correction of No. 22 being 0.8 foot on both days. Beginning with the month of March, 1918, the temperature coefficient of Z variometer No. 1 has been regarded as zero, a value which much better satisfies the trend of the base lines over a considerable interval of time.

Special observations were made at the time of the solar eclipse of June 8, 1918, at l\lenn, Ark., In connection with similar observations made at a number of other places in the belt of totality. They included observations of declination every minute for a period of six hours, with observations every half minute during the 20..minute period about totality. The observations at Colorado Springs and vicinity were made in cooperation with the department of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington to determine whether there ls any change of the earth's magnetic field due to changes of elevation. Four auxiliary stations were occupied in the country around Marlon, N. C. A meridian line was established at the new magnetic station at Sherman, Tex., at the request of the city manager. Requests for magnetic data were made by local surveyors and engineers or local authorities at most of the stations occupied.

At the Tucson Magnetic Observatory the usual observations were recorded. The magnetograph recording variations in declination and horizontal intenи slty and vertical intensity was In continuous operation with the exception of short breaks that occurred on November 10 and 13 in adjusting the instruments. Scale-value observations were made at least once a month, and more often when made necessary by instrumental adjustments. Absolute observations were made usually twice each week. Chronometer corrections were obtained from telegraphic time signals nt Tucson by telephone until November and then by comparison of chronometer!I. Both components of the Bosch-Omorl seismograph were kept in continuous operation except during November and the first part of December, when the driving clock of the E-W component was sent to the office for repairs. Thirtythree earthquake shocks were recorded. - The usual meteorological observations were made. Special magnetic observations were made from noon until 6 p. m. on June S, at the time of the total solar eclipse.

SUMMARY OF RlllSULTS.-Trlangulatlon : 72 square miles of area covered. 9 stations In main scheme occuplt-d for horizontal measures, 1 station In supplemt-ntal schPme occupied tor horizontal mPasures, 35 geographic positions determined. Leveling: 0.2 mile of levels run. Topography: 14.9 square miles of area surveyed, 98 miles of general coast line surveyed, 0.2 mile of road~ surveyed, 2 topographic sheets finished, scale 1: 20,000. Hydrography: 73.7 square miles of area dragged, 1,768 positions determined (double angles), 7'1' retained soundings, 3 hydrographic sheets finished, scale 1: 20,000.

Wire-drag party No. 4 began work In Alaska on May 3, 1917, and the work done to June 30 Is reported in the annual report for 1917. The location of the work was in Stephens Passage, Lynn Canal, and the two straits .:which connect those bodies of water, namely, Favorite Channel and Saginaw Channel. The northern limit extends across Lynn Canal from. Point Bridget to the opposite shore. The eastern limit follows closely the indentations of the shore line, and Is close to low-water mark In most places. In Lynn Canal the western limit ls marked by a line from Point Whldbey to Little Island; In Saginaw Channel by a line between Point Retrllat and Hump Island and also by the shore line of Lincoln and Admiralty Islands. The water areas within the above limits were completed as far south as Young Point. In addition a dragged strip three-fourths of a mile wide extends In mid-channel about 7 miles farther southeastward. The hydrography consisted of a wire-drag examination of the area outlined above. The eft'ectlve depth dragged was 85 feet at mean lower low water, except where less water was known to exist, as shown by previous surveys. When dragging close Inshore no attempt was made to maintain this depth on account of the great loss of time, without adequate return, which would have been involved. Instead a depth of 45 feet was usually set as a maximum. During the season 19 shoals with depths of 10 fathoms or less were located by the drag. Only one shoal In the track of steamers and dangerous to navigation was found. A number of soundings were secured In mid-channel where the depths were less than those shown on the chart, but these spots were not less than 10 fathoms in depth. In addition to the above !lhoals a number of uncharted rocks and reefs lying close Inshore were found either by the topographic party or by a launch party on a special Investigation of su!lpicious localities where submerged rocks were reported by local fishermen. These rocks were located In the narrow strip which was left between the dragged area and the high-water mark on the beaches. Many of them were In the path of launches and cannery tenders, but out of the track of larger vessels. Tides were recorded by an automatic gauge at Auke Bay, and an almost con. tinuous record was obtained from May 15 to Septerr.l!ler 11. Topographic surveys were made of the shore line contiguous to the dragged areas. On the mainland the shore line only was delineated In order to show several of the o:t'f-lying rocks and reefs not shown on previous charts or geological maps. The limits of the shore llne surveys are a point opposite North Island on the north and the end of the peninsula extending Into Fritz Cove on the south. The western shore llne of Douglas Island from Fritz Cove to a point 5i miles southeast of Point Hilda was surveyed. On the west side of Stephens Passage a survpy was made of the shore line of Admiralty Island from Horse Island to Point Retreat, Including the shore llne In Barlow Cove and the smaller Islands lldjacent to this stretch. The entire shore llne of Shelter and Lincoln Islands was run. All of the smaller Islands lying within the limits of the above work were Included In the topographic survey. The control for the main part ojpthls work was furnished by the primary triangulation party under F. S.~orden. A tertiary scheme was observed In advance .of this work, when the progress of the drag preceded the observations of that party. It was necessary to run a tertiary scheme Into Saginaw Channel for the determination of the signals in that channel.

Topography: 126.25 square miles of area surveyea, 136 miles of general shore line surveyed, 2.9 miles of shore line of creeks surveyed, 6 topographic sheets finished, scale 1 : 20,000. Hydrography (wire drag) : 216.2 square mlles of area dragged, 1 tide station established, 8 current stationи established, 5 hydrographlc sheets finished, scale 1 : 20,000.

Progress made by wire-drag party No. B In the survey of Frederick Sound, Alaska, to June BO, 1917, was stated in the last annual report. By the close of the season, September 28, 1917, the main ship channel of Frederick Sound had been dragged within the limits defined below, and the topography had been carried through the whole of the region covered by the drag. Two separate schemes of triangulation were run in order to establish the necessary control. Lines of soundings were run In the vicinity of buoys 17 and 24 and buoys 19 иand 26 in Wrangell Strait In order to determine whether or not shoaling had taken place since the last survey In 1910. Tides were observed at Petersburg and Cleveland Passage, with an automatic tide gauge at the former place and by observers during 36 consecutive hours at the latter place. Current observations were taken at three current stations In the main ship channel, and additional notes were taken during the course of other operations. Coast-pilot notes were, taken during the entire season. A topographic reconnolssance was made In the vicinity of Patterson Bay, Baranof Island. The area dragged in Frederick Sound ls bounded by Mitkof and Kupreanof Islands and Dry Strait on the south, approximately by a line from Port Houghton through the Sail Islands and the mainland on the north and by the mainland on the east. This area was completely dragged, except that the sudden ending of the season's work prevented certain small areas from being completed. As much topography was done as was possible without interfering with the drag work. Current observations were made at three stations, one in mldchannel south of Cape Fanshaw, one In mid-channel between Portage and Farragut Bays, and one in mid-channel near the entrance to Thomas Bay. Two schemes of tertiary triangulation were run in order to obtain the necessary control. At current stations and at various times while running to and from anchorages, cuts to mountain peaks were taken in order to aid in contouring the topographic sheets. , A tide staft' was erected In Cleveland Passage, and tidal observations were taken during 36 consecutive hours. An eft'.ectlve depth of 85 feet was tlragged in most cases, except close inshore and over known shoals, where the prevailing depths were less. The first trials with the drag at that depth were necessarily experimental, because this was the first occasion of such deep dragging. The metal floats in the equipment were designed to withstand the hydrostatic pressure at a depth of 72 feet, but they were not wholly satisfactory when used at the increased depth. The increased pressure caused a number of the floats to cotlapse the first time the drag was set out. Accordingly wooden floats were used during the greater part of the season. и The maximum length of a section permissible was found to be 400 feet with the type of buoys used. Long drags ranging from 10,000 to 12,000 feet in length were used, with both launches taking independent positions. For inshore work a somewhat shorter drag sufficed, although In this case also independent positions were taken. To in!lure an eft'ective depth of 85 .feet at all stages of tide, the length of the upright had to be 100 feet. In order to increase the buoyancy of the drag so ae to guard against its sinking, two large buoys were substituted for two of the email buoys, one midway between the near and middle buoys and one midway between the middle and far buoys. The chief difficulties encountered were due to tidal currents and floating glaeial lee. The entire area dragged during the season from April 27 to September 28 was slightly fn excess of 400 square mlles. This area was covered by five sheets, sllgbtly overlapping.

On sheet 4, from Cape Fanshaw to the north end of Whitney Island, a small area remains unfinished. The survey of the shore line on the south side of Frederick Sound is complete from a point about 3 miles southeast of Cosmos Point, near Dl'y Strait, to a point approximately south of Point Fanshaw. A little more than hll.lf of the shore line on either side of Portage Bay was run. The survey of the shore line on the north side of FreC.erick Sound is complete from the entrance to LeConte Bay, near Dry Strait, to Point Houghton, except for about 1.5 miles in the vicinity of Brown Cove. No attempt was made to survey Thomas Bay, and in Farragut Bay only those portions close to Frederick Sound were run. The Sukoi Islands, the Five Fingers, and the Brothers were run in, as well as other small islands. About one day's work was done In the vicinity of False Point Pybus. Particular attention was paid by the topographers to the delineation of the low-water line, oft'shore rocks, and the kelp line, as well as to the high-water

b&

.

Ten shoals, with depths varying from 43 to 85 feet, were located and reported during the season. The Immediate control for the greater part of the wire-drag hydrography and the topography was furnished by two separate small schemes of tertiary triangulation developed in advance of the other work. The first scheme extends from tbe Sukoi Islands to Portage and Farragut Bays. A subordinate scheme was extended from the above scheme into Farragut Bay for plane-table control. The second scheme Is in the vicinity of the Five Finger and Brother Islands. The chartered launches Equator, Rooaevelt, and Fre11ea were used in this work. Lines of soundings were run in the vicinity of buoys 17 and 24, at the entrance to Wrangell Strait, to determine whether or not shoaling had taken place, as reported, since the survey of 1910. Similar lines were run at buoys 19 and 26 for the same purpose. и No material difference was found when the results were иcompared with the chart. Before dragging operations were begun an automatic tide gauge was Installed at the end of the old unused sawmill dock at Petersburg. Continuous records were obtained from April 25 to September 28. Lines of leveling were run connecting the tide gauge with previously established bench marks. A tide staft' was erected at an unused dock In Cleveland Passage. Observations were taken during 36 consecutive hours. Lines of level were run from a recovered tidal bench mark on Whitney Island. An eft'ort was made during the season to obtain as much current data in frederick Sound as was practicable without Interfering with the drag work. In addition to the three current stations established and the data taken therefrom, notes were taken at variou.s times during other operations. In accordance with Instructions a subparty was sent out to determine the heights of Mount Cecil and Mount Elizabeth, which are on the east side of Baranof Island, just north of Patterson Bay, and to determine whether or not there were any lakes of considerable size In the same vicinity. Three triangulation stations were recovered, and directions and vertical angles were observed on the principal peaks In the vicinity of Mount Cecil and Mount Ell&abeth. From these observations the geographic positions and the heights of Mount Cecil and Mount Elizabeth were computed. In order to determine whether or not there was a large body of fresh water In the vicinity of the above-mentioned peaks, an attempt was made to climb one of the ridges near the head of Patterson Bay. At the elevation reached one lake could be seen across the valley at the head of the bay. The height of this lake above sea level was determined approximately. Another lake was discovered at the head of a stream flowing into the upper part of the bay. Coast-pilot notes were gathered in regard to all important loc11lltles visited.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, OOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The object of this triangulation was to furnish control for a wire-drag party operating in this locality, and also to establish a strong scheme of triangulation through this section of southeastern Alaska. Previous to June 30 the triangulation had been carried from Young Bay northward to the line Sentinel-Little on Sentinel and Little Islands in Lynn Canal. Work was then taken up in Young Bay. A base line was measured at the head of Young Bay, after which the triangulation was carried southeastward. Work was closed for the season on September 25, the triangulation at that time having been carried to a base, Rock.,-Grave, 2 miles south of Grand Island. From the main-scheme stations of the triangulation, all banners, whitewashed rocks, etc., established by the wire,drag parties, were cut in, as well as many prominent peaks, lighthouses, etc. Two subsidiary stations, Marmion and Entrance, were established at the enи trance to Gastimeau Channel as a base for carrying the triangulation up the channel. The positions of these stations were computed through the quadrilateral Con1er, Oliver, Marmion and Entrance. ~fhe stations Corner and Oliver are main-scheme stations. The subsidiary stations Marmion and Entrance were occupied. From the base Sentinel-Little, the north end of the season's work, the lines are clear to the next pair of stations northward, whlle from Rock.,-Grave, the south end of the work, the lines are clear to Lime-Stone, the next pair of stations southward. Signals Lime, Rock, and South had been built, and were ready for occupation at the close of the season.

The party engaged in the primary triangulation of Frederick Sound, southeastern Al&.ska, was in the field at the beginning of the fiscal year. Progress made to July 1 is reported in the annual report for 1917. The primary object of this work was to furnish control for the wire-drag party operating in Frederick Sound. The launch Marguerite was chartered for the use ot the party. On account of numerous rounding points and also to peculiar turns In the channel, the reconnolssance had to be very thorough before any signal building could be done. In some cases mountain peaks might have been used to advantage, but would have caused considerable delay on account of rain and overhanging clouds. и It was at first thought from previous experience that the observations would be made in the daytime, but it was found that the necessary accuracy could not be obtained by sighting on the signals, and both carbide and electric lights were used, the latter proving most satisfactory. The signals consisted of a tripod with center pole. The signal was used mainly as a day mark for the wire-drag parties and for sighting on before the lights or heliotropes were showing. The instrument support and light stand consisted of a four-legged stand, suitably branced and weighted down with stones, or cemented to the rock. A platform for the observer was built around the stand. At Turnabout Island a 00и foot scatfold had to be built and at North Base it was necessary to build a 20-foot scatrold. и A base line was located on the same ground as the old base of 1887, except that it lay farther inshore on ground above high water and was much shorter. No ready method presented itself for connecting with the main scheme from this base, and the question of getting by Point Agassiz and the Sukol Islands without considerable overlapping of figures presented a difficult problem. A site was found where by clearing about 500 yards of woods and utilizing a beach which bares at low water the base was made a main-scheme line so as to overoome the difficulty mentlpned. The base is 4,800 meters in length. At the close of the season 20 miles of triangulation remained to be done to connect with the work of 1916 in Dry Strait. Signals Creek, Blulf, Pershing, and Camp had been erected, when orders were received to close work, and owing to unfavorable weather in the latter halt of September were not occupied. Work was closed for the season on September 25. и

At the beginning of the.fiscal year theisteamer EaJplorer was engaged in general su.rveys on the outer coast of southeastern Alaska northward of Cape Muzon. The work of the party was seriously handicapped by the desertion of a number of the crew and the resignation of the chief engineer. Owing to these hindrances to field work the commanding officer was ordered by telegraph on July 12 to close work, transfer the steamer Cosmos, launch 117, and certain officers and men to the Patterson, and return with the E:rplorer to Seattle. The vessel arrived at Seattle August 19.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the steamer Patterson was engaged In general surveys in the approa<'hes to Cross Sound, incluuing Llsianskl Inlet and Strait, Alaska. Progress to June BO, 1917, is detailed in the last annual report. By that date the triangulation had been completed from Cross Sound to below Stag Bay and signals built to Point Urey. Reconnolssunce had been made and some of the signals built for several figures Into Llslanskl Inlet below Junction Island, and the topography completed to Stag Bay. No offshore soundings had been made, but the hydrography of the narrow portion!> of Llslanski Strait had been completed for the use of the Patterson, and In anticipation of vessels being sent to the cannery under Mnstructlon ln Stag Bay. Work was continued after July l, 1917, the vessel sounding outside and offshore on favorable days. These soundings will be useful on the charts, although the work was not completed. Soundings were made only when points on shore were visible for determining the poeltlon of the vessel. For continuing this work peaks are located or available along the Yakobi and Chlchagof shores. Inshore the triangulation was extended to the head of Lislanskl Inlet, through Llslanski Strait, and thence southward to Khaz Bay, where a connection was made with the work of E. F. Dickins, 1906. Further observations are desired In this triangulation. The topography and hydrography of Llsianski Inlet and Strait were completed. No work was done on the west shore of Yakobl Island. A topographic survey of the vicinity of Nickel was made, and a hydrographlc reconnolssance of the approach also made. The topographic survey does not join the Llslanski Strait work by about 2 miles, and there ls a larger gap between the hydrographlc work off Nickel and the entrance of Lislanskl Strait. The Cosmos and crew were assigned to the Patterson from the EaJplorer on August 1, and the addition of this launch, on which the party could llve, made possible the connection of the triangulation with Khaz Bay and the topographic work ln vicinity of Nickel. The west coast of Yakobi Island and Chlchagof Island are extremely irregular and foul, and a vessel of any size or draft can not approach the shores. There are numerous small bays and Inlets Into which small gas launches can find shelter. Many of these have only a few feet at low water and contracted entrances. Nickel, for example, ls in a small bay called Mirror Harbor, which ls landlocked. The approach ls narrow and foul, and at the narrowest point, about 20 yards wide, are two rocks, and a sharp turn must be made. It was all the Cosmos could do to make this shelter. On September 20 orders were received to close work at once, store the outfit. and return to Seattle. The camp party was picked up September 22 and the party proceeded to Juneau. From Juneau the Patterson proceeded to Metlakatla, having to anchor over several days because of too heavy weather to tow the Delta. Both the DeZta and Cosmos were sent !;>Y way of Zlmovla Strait and Ernest Sound from Wrangell Narrows.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

At Ketchikan the power-boat equipment of wire-drag party No. 3 was taken aboard, and the vessel then proceeded to Metlakatla. At Metlakatla the various boats were stored. The ship left Metlakatla on October 8, obtained mail and provisions at Ketchikan, and sailed for Srnttle at midnight, reaching Seattle October 13. As a number of the officers had been transferred to the Army and Navy, and all Arrхy officers had orders detaching them on arrival, these officers continued office work on sheets and records until detached, and completed the inking of the topographic sheets. On October 16 three of the officers left under orders to report at Fort Monroe for Army duty. The same day the Patterson was taken into Lake Union through the Lake Washington Canal and Locks and moored at the county dock built for the Survey. Three additional officers were enrolled in the United States Naval Reserve Force on October 15, and directed to continue duty on the Patterson, pending orders from the Bureau of Navigation. The commanding officer and one other officer were not enrolled until the end of the year and also continued on duty on board the vessel. On enrollment they were assigned to continue duty on the Patterson, pending orders of the Bureau of Navigation. и During the season the following work was accomplished: The triangulation control was extended through Lisianski Inlet, Lisianski Strait, and southward along Chichagof Island to Khaz Bay, thus connecting Cross Sound triangulation, by J. F. Pratt, 1901, with Khaz Bay triangulation, by E. F. Dickins, 1905. Triangulation was also extended to the head of Lislanski Inlet. The topographic survey covered all of Lisianski Inlet, 'iisianski Strait, and Stag Bay. The control was furnished by triangulation above mentioned. Topography covered contours of hllls adjacent to the shore line. The topoи graphic survey extends southward to Ilin Bay, then there ls a gap of about 2 mtles, and then a further topographic survey in the vicinity ot Nickel and the northern part of Portlock Harbor. A complete hydrographic survey was made of Lisianski Inlet and Lisianskt Strait, a hydrographic reconnoissance of Davison Bay, and the hydrographic ottshore development extends 27 miles offshore and 60 Iliiles along the coast.

The party for the steamer Taku, under Instructions to continue the survey of Prince William Sound, arrived at Cordova on May 10, and was employed until the end of June In making needed repairs to the vessel. On July 7 the vessel proceeded to Port Nellle Juan, arriving on July 8, and the .next day began building signals. The engines and boiler ot the Taku were in bad condition and even after beи Ing repaired were constantly breaking down. An engine which had been ordered tor launch No. 89 did not arrive in time to be of service, and was not installed. The signal building, observing and topographic parties were obliged to go to work and return ln pulllng boats. The cannery of the Copper River Packing Co. in the small bay on the east side of McClure Bay gave the use of their dock as a berth tor the Taku and supplied water and storage for coal without charge. A storehouse for the Survey was built at the head of the bay where the. cannery ls situated. An automatic tide gauge was set up at the cannery dock, and bench marks were established. The greatest range observed was 16.9 feet. No current observations were made, as there were no facilities for anchoring tn the deeper parts of the channel. The currents appear to set with the channels and are usually weak, not exceeding probably from one-fourth to thl'eefourths knot in Port Nellie Juan. The triangulation was extended from the base First-Catch, the most availи able llne. Thence three quadrilaterals were extended through the first reach of Port Nellle Juan.

The topography was extended from the triangulation stations Wire and End at the entrance to Port Nellie Juan through the first reach to the turn at staии tions Land and Fini, including McClure Bay. The work was done with the plane table, a traverse being run from station Port down the east side of McClure Bay and thence to station Land. The remainder of the shore line and the contours were done after the triangulation was completed. The woods covering the lower slopes dwindle away at about the thousand-foot curve. Soundings were made over the area of McClure Bay and the outer reach of Port Nellie Juan. . Observations for magnetic deviation were made with the compass-declinometer at station Port. At the request of the mayor of Cordova a military registration of eligibles for the draft was made by the chief of party at Port Nellie Juan. J!'ield work was closed for the season on August 22, and the party arrived at Seattle September 5. At Cordova the Taku was inspected by officers of the Steamboat-lnspeetion Service, who recommended that she be condemned and sold. The equipment to be retained for use was stored at Cordova, and the instruments were shipped to Seattle. The chart agency at Cordova was Inspected while the vessel was being held up, and a member of the party was sent to inspect the agency at Valdez.

SUMMARY OJI' BESULTS.-Levellng: 3 miles of levels run, 4 permanent bench marks established. и TopQgraphy : 2 square miles of area surveyed1 10 mUes of coast !lne surveyed, II miles of roads surveyed, 1 topographic sheet ftnlsned, scale 1 : 10,000. Hydrography: 111 square miles of area covered, Uil miles run while sounding, 1,200 positions determined (double angles), 2,140 soundings made, 1 tide station established, 1 hydrorapble sheet finished, scale 1: 10,000. Wire-drag work: 14 square miles of area dragged, .II linear mUes dragged, 466 angles measured.

Preparations were made and a party organized at Seattle, Wash., in March and. ,April, 1918, for wire-drag work at Knik Harbor, Anchorage, Alaska, and on Aprn 21 the party sailed for Alaska on the S. S. Admiral Jt'arragut. On the way up the Farragut struck an obstruction in Wrangell Narrows, but was able to proceed to Juneau, where the freight was landed and the passengers and mail transshipped to the Alameda, which landed the party at Anchorage иon May 8, but without gear or instruments, which were not received until May 17. The intervening time was spent In building signals, erecting a tide gauge, arranging for the necessary boats, and other preparatory operations. The work contemplated by the instructions included a wire-drag survey of Knik Arm between Point Woronzof and Cairn Point, with wire-drag set at an effective depth of not less than 40 feet at mean lower low water, and to within 3 feet of the bottom at less depth, and on all separate orи detached shoals of less than 40 feet depth the minimum depth to be determined. It was also directed that a hydrographlc survey with lines 200 meters apart and a closer development where needed be made over the same area. An automatic tide gauge was put In operation June 1, four permanent bench marks 'were established and connected by leveling with each other with the statf and with a bench of 1914. A topographic revision was made in order to show certain improvements. Hydrographlc signals were located with the plllne table, and the rocks seen at lowest tides were cut In. The only ones considered dangerous were found oft' Oalrn Point. Triangulation stations at points Woronzof and Mackenzie were found in danger of slipping over the bluff and so were re-marked with bronze plates in concrete, set farther back, and In such a way as to preserve the azimuth of the line. The entire harbor from Cairn Point to Point Woronzof was sounded, and the greater part of the navigable area was dragged. This work, which was not completed, was In progress at the close of the fiscal year. The work of sounding was accomplished under unusual difficulties. There I.a an extreme tidal raxige of 40 feet, and In consequence the tidal currents are very strong, attaining at times a velocity of almost 7 knots. For this reason It was Impossible to run lines crosswise of the channels, and the following plan was adopted: Out to about 10 fathoms the lines were run normal to shore, and beyond that they were run lengthwise of the Arm. Advantage was taken of slack water for the first, but when the current set In, lines were run with it the length of the harbor.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Inshore there was found mud bottom of even slope, but a short..ilstance outside of the low water the bottom drops off abruptly and the lead develops great inequalities, showing deep holes and all rocky, with traces here and there of clean sand. The strong currenbl continually scouring out the bottom cause the silt brought down from the upper Arm to be held ln suspension until it reaches the shoals just outside the points. The drag work in deep water was quickly finished, but when it became necessary to operate the drag close to the bottom, much ditllculty was experienced, owing to the irregular bottom and the strong currents. It was impossible to overate the drag, except about the time of slack water and by drifting with the rurrent. A number of shoar spots surrounded by deeper water was found, but it was impossible to decide whether they were menaces to navigation until the least depths over them were more accurately determined. Launches for the sounding and wire drag were furnished by the Alaskan Engineering Commission, which otherwise cooperated ln the work ln every way practicable.

In June, 1917, a party was organized at Seattle for work during the summer season of 1917 on the south coast of the Alaska Peninsula. The party left Seattle July 10 and arrived at King Cove, Alaska, July 20. On July 24 and 27 orders were Issued directing the chief of party to repair the steamer Yukon and return to Seattle as soon as practicable, without attempting to do any field work. As it was apparent from the first that it WllS impossible to get the Yukon in commission in time to do any field work during the season, it had been determined to repair the launch .Alpha and do field work with her when the weather conditions were favorable, reserving for less favorable weather the completion of the repairs to the Yukon. At the time the instructions to return to Seattle were received th~ ~rs to the .Alpha wera nearly completed, but the Yukon had been taken apa'rf and the material which it was thought could be used again was piled up under canvas on the ground around her. It was impossible to replace this material ln time to have taken the September mall boat to Seattle, but an extra effort was made to get the better part of It back in time to take the mall boat on Its October trip, a carpenter and helper being left to complete the replacing of some of the interior woodwork and to nttempt to eomplete the new pilot house. Toward the close of the season the vessel was entirely roofed over as a ;irotection from the elements. No survey work was done during the season other than a hasty reconnoissance of Morzhovoi Bay and the establishmentи and operation of an automatic tide gauge at King Cove from July 31 to October 17, 1917.

The usual observations were recorded at the Sitka Magnetic Observatory during the year with practically no interruption. The magnetic variation Instruments have continued ln satisfactory operation. Absolute observations, consisting of three sets of decllnatlon, two sets of dip, and the regular double set of horizontal intensity observations, were obtained twice each week, with the exception of one week in October, when the absolute observation building was being moved to a new site. Time observations from noon transits of the sun were 'obtained when practicable. The seismograph was kept ln operation and a total of 21 earthquakes, nearly all of small magnltnde, were recorded durlngиthe year. During April and May the ree<>rd was pa.rt ly interrupted, owing to the failure of the driving clock.

Immediately after securing the absolute observations on October 1 the work of moving the absolute-observation building from the Swanson property to the new site was begun. This work occupied two weeks. From the new site the former azimuth mark is not visible, and consequently it was necessary to transfer the azimuth and use a new mark. Comparative observations were lllade to determine the relation between the old and the new sites. PORTO Rrco.
IF. L. ADAMS, July 1, 1917, to Apr. 12, 1918; WALLACE M. HILL, Apr. 13 to June 30, 1918.]

At the magnetic observatory at Vieques, P. R., the usual absolute observations of the three magnetic elements-declination, dip, and horizontal intensity-were made. The magnetograph and seismograph have been in practically continuous Operation. Twenty-eight earthquakes were recorded during the year. The buildings at the station are in good condition of repair. About 2 acres of waste land surrounding the station werи' cultivated, and a fair crop of corn, beans, sweet potatoes, and other vegetables was raised.
VIRGIN ISLANDS.

{0. W. SWAINSON.]
SUMMARY OB' RESULTl!l.-Reconnolssance: 5 lines of lntervlslblllty dPtermlnPd, 2 points Selected for scheme. Base lines: 1 secondary 1,848.38 meters In length. Triangulation: 198 square miles of area covered, 98 signal poles erected, 3 observing scatrolds and tripods built (heigиhts 30 to 40 feet), 15 stations In main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 7 stations In supplemental scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 18 stations occupied for vertical measures, 68 geographic positions determined, 3 elevations determined trlgonometrlcally. Leveling: 2 miles of levels run. Topography: .10 square Illiles of area surveyed, 37 .5 miles of general coast line surveyed, l mile of shore line of Ponds surveyed, 13 miles of roads surveyed, 1 topographic sheet finished, scales 1 : 900 and 1 : 10,000. и

Tn January, 1918, a party was organized for surveys in the Virgin Islands. This party left New York for San Juan, P. R., on February 2, arriving at San Juan on February 7. While waiting for transportation to St. Thomas a 'search Was made for launches suitable for wire-drag work. The party arrived in Charlotte Amalle, St. Thomas, on February 19, and the Chief of party immediately reported to the governor of the islands. With the assistance of the Engineering and Pay Departments of the Navy on the followlng day, the party was organized and bids for supplies sent out. A site for a base line was selected, and, as soon as the supplies were received and the party organized, work was begun on it. A subparty was put to work building signals. The best site for a base line was found to be 1 mile east of the town, starting on a small knoll just east of the West Indian Co.'s Dock and running in a northeasterly direction to the base of the hllls. The base site rose gradually on an average of 2:/o- per cent after a steep decline of a 16 per cent slope in getting away from south base. North base was 103 feet higher than south base, the elevation of the lowest stake being 40 feet lower than either base. The length of the base was 1,848.3865 meters. Four by 4 inch stakes were driven 25 meters apart and lined in with a theodolite. Brass strips were fastened on top of the stakes on which the zeros of the tape fell. The elevation of the top of the stakes was determined with a wye level. A standardized invar tape was used for measuring. The regular lllethod of base measurement with the use of this type of tape was employed. The triangulation was carried from the established line East End on Vieques Islandl Savnna. Heliotropes were used on both ends of the three lines from ERst El'nd. Three parties, one in charge of each officer, were in continuous operation. It was necessary to build n tower at East End ln order to see Buel\ Island, The height of this tower was computed, and accordingly enough lumber was taken there from FajRrdo for the purpose. Buck Island Light could be seen from the top of this tower at night, but the hellotrope could not be seen in the daytime, although of equal elevation. It was necessary to build a tower alongside of Buck Island Light and 15 feet higher to overcome the difficulty. Central-point figures were decided upon to give the best bases for cutting in topographic control stations with the least amount of main-scheme observlnr. Intersection stations were established about every mile along the shore line for

topographic control. These were cut in .from at least three stations wherever possible. The triangulation was rushed in order to get one topographic party started on the most difficult topographic sheet. One topographic party was started on the sheet embracing the town and harbor on April 22. The other party was started on the western sheet May 1. Both continued with only short Interruptions for signal building and triangulation the balance of the fiscal year. Extreme care was taken to obtain accuracy on the sheet covering the town. An elaborate. control was furnished. The contours were determined with more than ordinary i;recision, due to the fact that the local government is contemplating installing a water system in the vicinity, and the Coast Survey chart would be studied for a waterworks site. At the request of the Navy Department particular stress was given the locating of old ruins, stone walls, boundary monuments, etc. All of this topography was <1one on a 1: 10,000 scale. Twenty-foot contours were determined. At the request of the local authorities a special topographic survey was made of a piece of alien property which it was contemplated to seize for military purposes. This survey consisted In locating the shore line, docks, houses, and contours. It was on a scale of approximately 1: 900. Assistance was rendered the naval civil engineer by checking his results in laying out the foundation for a wireless tower. The commanding officer of the Marines supplied a launch whenever it could be spared.
HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
[FRANK NEUMANN.)

At the magnetic observatory near Honolulu a continuous record was obtained with the variation instruments. Absolute observations were made weekly to determine base-line values. Scale-value observations were made monthly. The Milne seismograph was in operation with only slight interruptions, and 107 earthquakes were recorded. . In order to obtain chronometer corrections, time observations with sextant and artificial horizon were made three or four times each month. Meteorological observations were made as usual and reported monthly to the United States Weather Bureau office at Honolulu.
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
[FREMONT MORSE,

Director of Coast Surveys.]

The work of the Survey vessels was somewhat handicapped by the greatly Increased cost of 'all supplies and particularly of coal. The difficulty In regard to coal was greatly relieved by the purchase from the Navy of a supply for the Pathfinder and Fathomer at a cost of about half the prevalllng local price. In August when It became apparent that the Philippine appropriation was insufficient to meet the expenses of the r-urveying parties to the close of the year, a request was made to the Phll!ppine Emergency Board for an allotment which was granted. Later it became necessary on account of the shortage of officers and delays in repairing to withdraw the Fathomer and Research from active service, so that the whole of the extra allowance was not needed, and a portion of it was returned to the Insular treasury. As It was not practicable to replace the officers sent back to the United States and those transferred to the Army and Navy the steamers Research and Marinduque were laid up and the Research was finally transferred back to the insular government. On December 31 the steamer Pathfl,ndmи was taken to the Olongapo Naval Station for extensive repair!!. The Philippine Committee on Geographic Names WRR reorganized June, 1917, and, after a preliminary meeting on August 30, meetings were held monthly beginning on October 3. The names of barrios are being considered province by province, and good progress had been made. The Harbor Line Commission was reorganized November 6, 1917, and the Director of Coast Surveys was continued as a member. Extensive repairs to the steamer Pathfinder begun in December were greatly delayed by the pressure of Navy work at the Olongapo Naval Station, so that the ship did not get away from the yard until April 20. The steamer Marinduque was temporarily turned over to the bureau ot labor of the Philippine government on March rn, 1918.

OFFICE WORK,

113

In the computing division the office work on. reductions of tides and soundи lngs was carried on as usual. In the triangulation no main scheme adjustment was undertaken, ns all work was on minor schemes in regions previously covered by main scheme adjustments. The computation of geodetic positions and the preparation of final abstracts of positions were prosecuted to such an extent that final positions are available for all stations in adjusted work throughout the Visayas and Northern Mindanao, except along the east coasts of Mindanao, Leyte, and Samar In the drafting and geographic divisions, 22 hydrographic and 9 topographic sheets, besides 2 supplemental hydrographic sheets 1md 1 supplemental topographic sheet, were received, making a total of l,388 survey sheets received since the commencement of the surveys in the islands. The number of survey sheets on h1md at the Manila office on December 31, 1917, wa!'I 399. Seven chart tracings were completed and forwarded to Washington for printing, consisting of 3 new charts, 1 new edition, and 3 correction pieces. Seven chnrt drawings were in progress on December 31, 1917. Tracings were made of 10 topographic and 3 hydrographic sheets. The necessary field projections nml other data were furnished to hydrographic parties and the regular plotting and verification of hydrographlc sheets and inking of topographic sheets were attended to. Blue prints of topographic sheets were furnished to other Bureaus and individuals. A large progress map of work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the Philippine Islands was prepared for exhibit during the Philippine Carnival in February, 1.918. In the geographic division the tracings for the map of the Phlllpplne Islands on a scale of 1: 1,000,000, size l.33 by 2.09 meters, were sent to the United States for publlcation. This map was constructed In accordance with the plans for a map of the earth on a uniform scale adopted by the International Geographic Congress. Progress was made on drawings for five other maps of the Philippine Islands, viz: No. 50, Mindanao Island, scale 1: 600,000; No. 13, Samar; No. 3, Northern Luzon, scale 1: 200,000; No. 6, Central Luzon, Eastern Part, scale 1: 200,000; No. 9, Southeastern Luzon, scale 1: 200,000. и The sal~ of maps and blue prints were att.ended to by the chief clerk of the Manila suboffice. A list of nnmes of municipalities, barrios, and sltlos ls being complled in the geographic division. An alphabetical card index was begun to include all Philippine geographic names.

SUMMA.RY OF RESULTS.-Topograph'l: 32.5 square miles of area surveyed, 54 miles of general coast line surveyed, 7.5 miles o rivers surveyed, 1 topographic Aheet finished, scale 1 и 20 000 Hydrography : 1,058.4 square miles of area surveyed, 2,866. 7 miles run whlle sounding,' 6,939 positions determined (double angles), 21,755 soundings made, 1 tide station established, 4 hydrographlc sheets finl.ihed, scales one 1 : 60,000 and three 1 : 20,000. Traverse: Length 25.1 miles, 8.1 square miles of area covered, 23 signal poles erected, 21 stations In main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 16 stations In supplementary scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 21 geographic positions determined.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the steamer Pathfinder was engaged in the survey of the approaches to Burdens Bay, Polillo Island. The control for this work was obtained from supplementary tertiary triangulation from four recovered stations. Eight stations were occupied. Additional hydrographlc signals were determined by plane-table cuts and traverses. Launch hydrography in this locality, which had been interrupted from June 28 to August 28, was completed September 28. The extremely irregular .bottom necessitated lines at 100 meters intervals and very close development of important shoals and channels. As the bottom is visible In a good llght ut 5 fathoms, lt is quite certain that the channels, where no indications of shoals were found, are quite clear. As discrepancies were found In the shore line, the previous work in this locallty done in 1.908 was disregarded, and a complete examination was made. The examination did not reveal any new dangers in the 1906 deep channel, though less water was found on most of the known shoals. A new deep chan-

nel was feund north and east of Pacabalo Reef. A very complicated 9-fathom channel was developed between Polillo Island and Cataoyan Reef. Numerous rocks and shoals were found which practically close navigation for about 3 miles south of Patnanongan Island, to the eastward of Minasawa Island. The work on the southern approuehes to Burdens Bay was interrupted at the end of June in order to take up work on an offshore hydrogrnphic sheet extend-, ing some 24 mileR north and enst of Pollllo and the Uala Islands and to survey the north coast of Pollllo IRland. The area to the north of Polillo IRiand completed this season includcR in addition to the offshore sheet a topographic UIHI an inshore hydrographic sheet covering the unsurveyed north and northwest coasts of Polillo Island. Owing to flat thickly wooded ridges, triangulation was impracticable, and the control for the Polillo Island work was obtained by theodolite-stadia trnverse around the north coasts between triangulation stations estnblished in 1906 and 1916. This 24-mile traverse was made with due regard to accuraey nm! time, no sights in excess of 400 meters being taken, the distances across buys and rivers being obtained by triangulation ancl the distances '~hecked by un improvised tupe of stranded sounding wire whenever practicable. The closing error was 0.72 meter per mile of traverse, or 1: 2,540. The traverse was started in the second week in July and the topography undinshore hydrography completed by the third week in August. 'l'he coast line indicated on the existing chart was found to be considerably in error in appearance and 3 to 4 miles south or inside the true position. An anchorage with gray mud bottom, about one-half square mile In area and protected in all directions except from the north, was found in Pinavisugan Bay, on the northeast coast of Polillo Island. An excellent landlocked anchorage with depth of 3 fathoms mud bottom for small vessels with a swinging radius of 150 feet was found in the south bight of the Pinagagan River, on the northwest coast. No ship watering places were found. The small surface streams are practically dry from May to October, and the rivers are salt for several miles from their mouths. The signals used for offshore hydrography were, with but two exceptions, natural objects located by the few practicable triangulation directions and by sextant angles from the ship. Work on the offshore sheet was commeneed on June 27 and continued at intervals until it was completed on October 17. The only detached shoal imlicatlons found arnl develope1! were the 15-fathom banks l~иing about 5 miles northwest of Polillo Island and an 8-fathom spot about 4 miles east of KalongkoOftn Island. On the afternoon of October 17 and morning of October 18 the ship partially developed a shoal spot lying one-third mile east of the small islet which lies due north of the eastern end of Palasan faln111l. Further work ls required in this locality, as 1t was impracticable to complete the development on account of heavy seas. There Is little remarlrnble in the appearance of the areas examined. The low islands In front of the higher wooded ridges of Polillo afford numerous natural ranges through the channels Into Btmleus Buy, but since they usually consist of slight variatioiu; in theи sky line over clumps of trees it ls impracticable to so describe tlwm in print us to prcelulle mistakes in i<lentfying them. The north coast of Polillo is thickly wooded with several flat-topped ridges, rising very gradually to u height of ODO feet. As the different ridges can be distinguished only in misty weather and from offshore, the contours which have been sketched may be very inaccurate. Except In the heads of the bays and In the rivers, the entire coast Is fringed by a coral reef, which extends out for distances ranging from 100 mt>ters to almost a mile from the high-water line. On the northwest side a small barrier reef extends about 2 miles offshore. There ls only a complicated small-boat passage between It and the shore reef. Landing on the open coast in a heavy swell would be very dangerous. One of the numerous bays should be made If possible. Notwlthstancling the protection of the reef, the high-water line exposed to the northeast everywhere shows evidence of strong wave action. The rock outcrops are always undercut and very Irregular, while the coral sand Is driven up In a dike from 15 to 20 feet high. The commercial possibilities of this coast are limited, at least In the near future. There is no great amount of large accessible timber. The land is probably fertile, but It requires considerable labor to clear it. Coconuts and

other plants cultivated by the inhabitants do well. The present inhabitants consist of Tagalogs and a number of scattered families of Dumagats. The season's work was brought to n close on October 18, and the Pathfinder proceeded to Manila, at which port the vessel arrived on October 22. From this elate to December 1 the vessel was anchored in Manila Bay, the party being engaged in making out speclficatiolli! for repairs to vessel and preparing field data to submit to the Manila office; also in preparing inventories, etc., necessary to effect transfer of command. From December 2 to December 31 the Pathfinder was undergoing repairs at the Olongapo Naval Station. On December 31 the command of the steamer Pathfinder was transferred from H. C. Denson to H. B. Campbell.
[A. M. SOBIERALSKI, Commanding Steamer Pathfinder.]

иSuMMABY OF BESULTS.-ReconnolRsance : Length of scheme 10 miles, 29 square miles of area covered, u lines of lntervlslbllity determined, 2 points selected for scheme. Base line: 1 secondary, 4,706 meters In Jpngth. Triangulation: u2 square miles of area covered, 14 signal poles erected, 2 stations In main scheme and 8 stations in supplemental schemes occupi<>d for horizontal measures, 2 stations occupied for vertical measures, 5 geographic positions determined, 2 elevations determined trlgonometrlcally. Topography: 59.6 square miles of ar<>a surveyed, 58.5 miles of general coast Une surveyed, 17.5 miles of shore line of rivers and creeks surveyed, 84 miles of roads surveyed, 8 topographic sheets finished, scale of topographic sheets 1: 10,000 11nd 1 : 20~000. Hyrlrography: 805 square miles of area covered, 1,771.9 miles run while sounulng, 5,820 positions determined (doublP angles), 25,210 soundings made, 2 tldP stations established, 1 hydrographlc sheet finished, scale of hydrographlc sheets 1 : 20,000 and 1: 40,000.

While repairs to the steamer Pathfinder were in progress at Olongapo, a detached party completed the survey of Mariveles Harbor. The topography was carefully rerun and a close development on a 1: 10,000 ruade of the harbor. The Pathfinder sailed from Manila for the working ground on the east coast of Palawan on May 7. En route a small patch of hydrography south of Dumaran Island was completed and some deep soundings off Bold Point were taken. Upon arrival at Puerto Prlncesa the final reconnoissance for the base line was made and a party left at Iwahig to prepare the base for measureи ment. On May 31 the base Hne was ready for measurement. The base line is only 4,700 meters long, but a good scheme of expansion makes it possible to use this length. Besides the areas off Durnaran and off Bold Point the inshore hydrography was completed from Table Head to Trading Bay. The ship and one launch worked on the offshore hydrography, completing nil the worlt outside of a line 1 mile east of Malanao and Somhrero Islands, clown to latitude 9░ 20' N. A large part of this work was hand-lead work. The topography was completed from Table Head to Malanao Island. The work in Puerto Princesa was held up on account of unfavorable tides. All the head of the bay ls a mangrove swamp and can be done only at low tides. Only some supplementary stations for the control of hydrography and topography were located. The ship was swung for compass deviations off Malanao Island. The automatic tide gauge at Puerto Prlncesa was kept In continuous operation. A tide staff at Village Hocks was observed while hydrography was in progress In the vicinity. A tide staff w11s e!'<tablished at Aborlan and read while hyclrography was in progress in the vicinity. Puerto Princesa was used as headquarters. Sarnlakan, British North Borneo, was the coaling station. During the month of June the following work was executed by this party: Two triangulation stations in base expansion were established and occupied. Supplementary triangulation was extended to Panacan. The hydrography was extended southward and two 65-foot hydrographlc .signals built. Two lines of deep soundings. were run from latitude 9░ 05' to Bancoran Island. About 19.6 miles of topography was executed. Two of the stations, Mount Beaufort and Stavely Shoulder, were occupied, although the party had not returned from th' latter on .Tune 30. Mount Beaufort Is about 3,800 feet high, while Stavely Shoulder Is about 3,000 feet high. It takes about lQ days to occupy one of these stations. Five signals were built for extending the supplementary triangulation south from the llne Arena-Native Point. It will be possible to extend this scheme to Bivouac Point, but It wlll not be possible to join up with a local scheme tn Island Bay. и

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The ship and two launches were sounding when weather was favorable. The completed hydrography was extended to latitude 9░ 16' N., outside of tbe line between Sombrero and Arena Islands. The coral reef south of Imagauan extends to this latitude, requiring close development. As the hills in this vicinity are fronted by an extensive plain, it would be necessary to use a scale of 1 : 80.000 for the development of this bank, but by building some tall l'ignals on Malanao, Sombrero, Arena, and Rasa Islands, it was possible to work on a scale of 1 : 40,000. The peaks around Sultan Peak and Victoria Peak are so indefinite and so often in the clouds that it will be difficult to obtain good positions in the vicinity of Altnacraig and Marabout Shoals, except in the early morning. The anchorage at Aborlan was developed, but the r.hoal water between Malanao Island and the mainland has not yet been surveyed. The hydrography in Puerto Prlncesa was extended to a line west of Tidepole Point. This work was done while the base line was being measured. On the run to and from Sandakan, lines of sounding were run between Bancoran Island and Palawan. The soundings were spaced closely in the latitude of Rosalia Reef, but no indication was found. Sextant positions were obtained in this vicinity, while dead reckoning was used for the rest of the run, with good bearings on Bancoran Island for determination of the southern ends of the lines. The topography of Malanao Island and the shore line from Aborlan to Calver Point was completed. As the hills back of Aborlan do not come on a 1: 20,000 topographic sheet,' a sheet was laid out on a scale of 1: 40,000 on which the contours only will be shown. While the ship went to Sandakan for coal, a party was left at Puerto Prlncesa to continue the topography of the bay. Low tides occurred during the daytime during this week, and the worst part of the work was completed. Even at low tide the party had to wade continuously in mud and water up to the waist. и A typhoon passing to the northward during the week June 24 to 30, caused very rough weather. It was rough two days before the barometer fell.

SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Trlangulatlon : 18.4 miles of arPa covered, 3 signal poles erected. 3 Atatlons In supplemental schemes occupied for horizontal mPasures, 2 geographic positions determined. Leveling: 2 permanent bench marks established. Topography : 7 square mllPs of area surveyed. 20.2 miles of general coast line surveyed, 1 topographic sheet finished, scale 1 : 20,000. H{drography: 458.1 square miles of area covered, 1,602.2 miles run while sounding, 5,2 1 positions determined (double angles), 15,393 soundings made,_ 1 tide sta tlon established, 2 hydrograph1c sheets tlnished, acales 1 : 20,000 and 1 : 60,00u.

From July 1 to 14 the steamer Fathomer was repairing and outfitting at :Manila. After coaling at Cavite on July 14, the vessel saned the same day for the working grounds, arriving at Burdeus Bay, Polillo Island, on July 20. The work of the season included topography and hydrography on the east coast of Luzon in the vicinity of Polillo Island, and was done in cooperation with the party on the steamer Pathfinder. On July 23 a camp was established on one of the Uala Islands for the launch hydrographic, topographic, and signal-building parties. The vessel then proceeded to Dahikan Bay, where a tide gauge and camp were established. This was used as the ships' headquarters throughout the season. Considerable progress was made in the work during August, but in the latter part of the season the weather was unfavorable. Most of the work was in localities exposed to the open Pacific, where heavy swells made surveying operations on the outlying shoals haz1trdous and diflirult. , In consequence of unfavorable weather conditioru1, work closed for the season on October 15. The Fathamer sailed direct for Manila on that date, arriving on October 18. From this date until the close of the month the vessel was at Engineer Island undergoing repairs and outfitting for the continuation of the work off Busuanga Island.

The command of the Fathomer was transfered on November 26, while she was undergoing repairs, which were complete<! December 26. Supplies and coal had been taken on In the meanwhile, and on the same day the vessel sailed for the working ground on the west coast of Busuanga Island, Calamlan Group, arriving December 27. и Bench marks were established and connected with the tide gauge by leveling, a camp was established on shore, buoys and ranges for entering the harbor were repaired, and a general study was made of the work to be done. On De<'ember 29 hydrographic work was begun by the ship, heavy seas preventing any launch work. The work of the party consisted of the completion of five hydrographic sheets in the vicinity of the northwest coast of Busnanga Island, which had been begun under the party in charge of .John W. Maupin the year previous. The greater part of this work was confined to development of shoals reconnoitered by the previous party and to work outside the 100-fathom curve. The first of the year found the part}' on the working grounds with everything ready to prosecute the work diligently, all preliminaries, such as setting Ude statr and establishing tide observer's camp, having been attended to in the last few days of the preceding year. . и . _ The center of the operations for the first six weeks was Illultuk Bay, on the west coast of Busuanga Island, but the ship rarely put in there except over Sunday, It being more convenient to anchor behind islands or on shoals nearer the work: The weather at first was very discouraging. One northeast blow following hard on another made it necegsary to work in the deep water fully exposed to the heavy seas, which swept the decks continuously. On two days it was necessary to seek shelter. When these gales, which lasted about 10 days, had subsided, the northeast monsoon appeared to have blown Itself out, for the following weeks brought excellent weather for hydrography, with very fair seeing conditions. On February 18 the base of operations was transferred to Pangauaran River, Port Caltom, on the north coast of Busuanga, and from there the work around Hunter and Merope Rocks was carried on under generally excellent conditions. Coal was obtained once from Manila and once from the coal pile at Uson Island. On January fi a trip was taken to San: Jose, Mindoro, to send a telegram to Manila. During the period from March 2 to June 30, 1918, the Fathomer was employed in the unsurveyed portion of Cuyo West Pass and the Sulu Sea south to latitude 10░ 21.fi' N. The greater part Qf this was ship hydrography, the only triangulation involved being the tying in of a few small islands, the topography of which was to be done. The week following March 2 was spent making minor repairs and getting the supplies necessary for a season's work. On March 10 the ship left for the working grounds in Cuyo West Pass, stopping two days, en route, at Coron for coal, and arriving at Cuyo on the 15th. A single quadrilateral of secondary triangulation was extended off the base Patunga.;..(Japnoyan, which was tied in to station Tabac Rock to strengthen the general scheme. Another quadrilateral of tertiary triangulation was extended to the south and east to tie in the three small islands there, and a filled triangle was formed on the base Capnoyan-Imalaguan to locate Piedra Blanca. All of this wasи completed. To the westward a quadrilateral was extended from the base Norte-Dalanganem to determine the hase Dalanganem-Carandaga, from which a small scheme can be extended to control the local topography. This work was in progress at the close of the year. Observing was greatly hindered by the haze until the end of the northeast monsoon in the early part of May. Aside from this there were no dUficultle11 to overcome. One sheet of topography, on 1 : 20,000 scale, was completed, covering the small islands southwest of Cuyo Island with Paya Rock, Tabac Rock, and Piedra Blanca shown in subplans. Another 1 : 20,000 sheet covering the Dalanganem Islands was partially done. A tide staff was erected at Bisucay Island in approximately the same location aa the former gauges and tied in to the bench marks there. The small amount

of inshore hydrography about Capnoyan Island and the islands southward was done by a launch party camped on Capnoyan Island. Whlle waiting a favorable clay for observing triangulation in the Dalanganem group a small amount of Jaunch work was done there. The shoal westward of Piedra Blanca was developed by the launch, and the work plotted on the ship sheet, and on a favorable day the shoal in the vicinity of Elax Rock an<l Queen of the Sea Bank, which was reconnoitered by the ship, was developed by a launch party, using as a center signal a small boat anchored with wire in 50 fathoms. All the remainder of the hydrography was done by the ship. The general plan of work has been to clean up from the eastward, doing the off-shore work whenever weather was favorable, saving the work nearer shore for weather when the seeing was poor, or the sea so rough as to make it necessary to seek shelter at night. The work in the vicinity of the Dalanganem Islands was incidental to the triangulation there and to the development of the shoals reported as Queen of the Sea Bank and Elax Rock, which were the objects of a special effort requiring good seeing and smooth sea. While working east and southeast of Piedra Blanca, the weather being favorable, the ship was allowed to drift during the night to determine the sf't of the current. In addition to this data, careful record of the set 011 trips to and from Iloilo was kept and plotted on the boat sheet. A very uniform set of 1 knot in a direction slightly south of east seems to prevail. TRe only magnetic work was one ship swing on the sun azimuth. Stopping off for a day en route to Ilo'lo, a reconnoissnnce was made of the Cagayan Islands. Particular effort was made to find an entrance to the lnclosed area between the islands to be used as a ship anchorage, bu~ without any results. There was not sufficient time to make a comprehensive reconnoissauce for triangulation, but enough was done to determine a favorable location for the base and the general trend of the progress of the scheme. In addition to the prescribed work, an investigation was made and report tram1mltted on the shoals in the mouth of the Iloilo River. At the request cf the presidente of Cuyo, the engineer of the bureau of lands, and the observer of the Weather Bureau, three bench marks wpre estahlished at Cuyo and connected by four days' simultaneous readings with Bisucay.
[R. R. LUKENR, Commanding Steamer Romblon.) SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Reconnolssance: 300 square miles of area covered, 9 lines of lntervlslblllty determined, 5 points selected for scheme, length of scheme 30 miles. Triangulation (secondary) : 1 signal pole erected, 3 obsl'rvlng tripods built (height 75, G~. and 25 feet), 6 stations In main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 1 station In secondary scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 6 stations occupied for vertical measures, 15 geographic positions dPtermlned. Leveling : 0.5 mile of levels run, 3 permanent bench marks erected. Topography : 38 square mlles of area surveyed, 38 miles of general coast line survf'yed, 1 topographic sheet finished, scale 1 : 20,000. Hydrography: 125 square mlles of area covered, 1,060.4 miles run while soundins, 4 072 poHltions determined (double angles), 18.1178 soundings m11de, 1 tidal station established, 1 hydrographlc sheet finished, scale of hydrographlc sheets, two 1 : 20,000 one 1 : 60,000.

The work of this party was the continuation of general surveys along the southeastern coast of Palawan Island with the special object of extending the secondary triangulation to a junction with the work of the steamer Mtirlnduque, which was being brought down from the northward. From July 7 to 31 the vessel was at Manila undergoing repairs. On August 1 she sailed for the Pnlawan coast. Upon arrival at the working grounds a camp was put out on Pirate Island, and the officer in charge was given instructions to carry on the topography nntl hydrography as he saw fit, but to make a finished survey as he went alon;l. The ship then took up triangulation, building high signals along the beach antl shifting parties around for trips into the Interior stations. This caused a great deal of running with the ship, as the triangulation was 30 to 40 miles akead of the hydrography, and therefore but little ship hydrography could be accompllshed. Even when a day was available for sounding, the squalls and lowhanging clouds would usually stop work in the early afternoon. The Romblon made trips to Sandakan for coal and water about every 24 days, leaving one or two parties in camp to carry on work in her absence. From about September 20 the efforts of the whole party were concentrated on the triangulation, and a plan was laid out which, if successful, would insure tho completion of the work by the time the ship went to Manila in October. The

success of this plan hinged on the ability to establish and occupy a station on Mount Gantung, one of the most difficult of all the Palawan peaks. The officer assigned to this task started out on September 25. The ship proceeded to Sandakan for coal on October 3, and upon returning the officer sent to occupy Mount Gantung was picked up on October 8. His trip had been unsuccessful. The weather was bad and on the eighth day out his Tugbanua cargadores deliberately deserted him, and he was left no alternative except to return as best he could with his two sailors. This unfortunate incident broke up all hope of finishing the work, und, owing to the continued bad weather, it was decided to return to Manila at once for supplies and cleaning boilers and to get back as soon as possible, i11 the hopes of encountering better weather during the change of monsoon. Accordingly the ship arrived in Manila on October 14 and plans were made to sail again on October 22. On October 19, however, tfle mutter of the transfer of the commanding officer of the Romlilon to the Naval Heserve came to the attention of the cиorumander In chief of the ARiatlc Fleet, and he h'lsued verbal orders that the vessel remain In port while he communicated with the Navy Department in Washington in regard to this assignment. Answer to this cable was not received umll November 15, and us it was favorable, this officer was ordered Into the Naval Service. In the meantime the ship had heen held in Manila. In accordance with instructions received from the Director of Coast Surveys, the command of the Romblon was turned over to another officer on November 17. The launch was kept busy at Inshore hy<lrography during all the time that the ship was on the working grounds. 'l'his work was carried from Iglesia Point to a point about 2 miles northeast of San Antonio Bay. The area covered Is very full of shoals and reefs, and much development work was necessary. The offshore work was taken up by the ship when opportunity offered, but the prevalence of low-hanging clouds made it very difficult; indeed, 8 or 9 miles offshore seemed to be about the limit at the northern end of the work. '.rhe area of shoals i::eems to extend many miles offshore, and close work will be required to find all the dnngers. In development work a bright day was utilized, and the ship anchored on the shoalest part of the bank in question ; then a small boat was put out to search the area thoroughly for coral heads and pinnacles. Enough lines were run to delineate the depth curves, but the great effort was to find the least depths. и.ranner-Bllss pressure tubes were used in the shtp work, and they gave very good results. The ship's work joins that of the launch for a distance of about 15 miles and the soundings cross very well. Numerous up-and-down soundings were taken during the work to verify the tubes. Hand lead was used on all shoals and banks. The topography was completed from Iglesia Point to Tami Point, the most of the work being done by a party in camp. Care was taken to establish many triangulation stations along the shore, so that the work is well controlled. Around Iglesia Point and part of San Antonio Bay the shore ltne ls mangrove and mud, making the work very tedious. This section was done during lowwater periods. The northern part of the work consists, In the main, of a fine sand beach. The main mountain range does not come on the topographic sheets; therefore a 1: 100,000 prejection was made for the purpose of cutting In the mountain topography. Cuts were taken for this sheet when an opportunity o1Tered itself, but It was not completed. The triangulation was the most Important part of the season's work, the object being to e1Tect n junction with the work of the steamer Mnrinduque as brought down from the north. The reconnolssance was finished and all signals except one were up when the ship returned to Manila. '.rhe conditions governing this work were hard. One line of stations was on the central range, from 8,000 to 7,000 feet high, while the other line was on a wooded beach where high scatfolds were necessary. Continued bad weather and the prevalence of malaria were the features that prevented the completion of the work during this season. In this work the officers have displayed some very fine qualities of courage and tenacity. To spend day after day in those mountains, cutting every foot of the trail, not knowing when all the cargadores may leave, chilled by the daily cold rain and unable to sleep much nights because of the cold, is a task that requires some nerve and determination. Added to this, one is being constantly preyed upon by leeches and the hands and feet get badly cut up by the th<>rD8 and briara.

REPOR'l' OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The following is quoted from the report of the chief of party : " The writer made one five-day trip to one of the easy stations, and he appreciates thoroughly what the other officers have gone through. When Mr. Egner's men left him at the 4,700-foot level en route to Gantung, it took himself and his two men six days to double-pack the equipment back to the nearest barrio. Both Mr. Egner and Mr. Shaw have contracted the malaria from these trips, but it is hoped that they will soon recover from the effects of It'." It was absolutely essential that the station be located on Gantung, for It Is the only peak that shows from the station on Mantallngajan. Day and night readings were made on the tide staff at Sir J. Brooke Point whlle the ship was on the working grounds. A subsidiary staff on Pirate Island was used while hydrography was in progress in the vicinity. Botti staffs are referred to standard bench marks. No protected place suitable for an automatic gauge could be found. In southwest storms a very heavy sea rolls into the landing at Brooke Point, and it was necessary to rebuild the plain staf'l after nearly every storm. No systematic current survey was made, but it was noted that there is a set to the northeast along the Palawan coast. This current no doubt is caused by prevailing winds, for in the height of the northeast monsoon, a current setting to the southwest was also encountered. In the run from Bugsuk Island to Cagayan Sulu Islands, a moderate set to the north was always found. In making this run the ship steered N. 49░ W. and S. 40░ E. with good results.
[LllONARD H. ZllMAN, Commanding Steamer Romblon.] SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Trlangulatlon: 296 square miles of area covered. 1 signal pole erected, 7 stations in main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 6 stations occupied tor vertical measures, 7 geographic positions determined, 11 elevations dPtermined trigonometrlcally. Topography: 7 square m!IPs of area survey~d, 16.4 mlleR of general coast line surveyed, 1 topographic sheet tlnlshed, scale 1 : 20,000. Hydrography : 81.6 square miles of area covered. 695.4 miles run while sounding, 2,260 positions determined (double angles), 8,792 soundings made, 1 tide station established, 1 bydrograpblc sheet llnlshPd, scale of hydrographlc sheets, 1 : 20,000 and 1 : 60,000. On November 17, 1917, the command of the steamer Romblon was transferred

from R. R. Lukens to Leonard H. Zeman. On November 20 the Romblon proceeded to the working grounds on the southeast coast of Palawan, arriving there on November 23. On November 24 the field work commenced. The field work consisted in a continuation of the ship hydrography, launch hydrography, topography, and main-scheme triangulation as brought up the southeast coast of Palawan by R. R. Lukens and party. Coal was purchased at Sandakan, British North Borneo, a distance of about 200 miles from the working grounds. During runs for coal, parties were left In camps ashore to be engaged in triangulation, hydrography, and topography. The inshore hydrography completed by the launch extended offshore a distance of about 3i miles from a point 2 miles northeast of San Antonio Bay to Sir J. Brooke Point. The area surveyed disclosed many shoals which were subsequently developed. When the ship was not engaged on triangulation work, it took up the offshore hydrography from the point where the launch left off and extended the lines to the limit of visibility of shore signals. Tanner-Blish pressure tubes were used for the ship work, and they gave very satisfactory results. The topography was completed from Tami Point to Fllantropia Point. Traverses were run between the main-scheme triangulation points on the beach. The gap of 25 miles between the main-scheme triangulation, as brought down the island of Palawan from the northward and that brought up from the assumed datum at Balabac, was completed. Field computations yielded the following results at the junction: Length of line checks about 1: 50,000; discrepancy in azimuth about 50 seconds; discrepancy in latitude about 20 seconds, and discrepancy In longitude about 27 seconds. A tide staff was read every day at Sir J. Brooke Point between the hours of 6 a. m. and 6 p. m. No observations for currents were made. The weather during the period covered by this report was excellent for all the branches of the field work. On .January 16, 1918, the ship salled for Manila under orders received from the Director of Coast Surveys. A short stop was made at Puerto Princesa in order to obtain mail. On January 19, 1918, the ship tlell up nlongside the dolphins at Engineer Island, a~d on January 21 repairs to the vessel were commenced.

On March 13, 1918, the command of the steamer Romblon was transferred from L. H. Zeman to H. B. Campbell. The ship was still undergoing repairs on that date. Owing to the fact that the lignum-vltre of the stern bearing of the starboard Propellor shaft had entirely worn away or dropped out, it was deemed necessary to use only the port engine of the ship in order to avoid possibility of bending the shaft or breaking the bearings. This faulty condition of the stern bearing was first noticed on the trip from Sandakan to the working grounds on January 2-3, 1918. Several attempts were made to do ship hydrography, using only one engine, but owing to the prevalence o:t'. strong northeast monsoon weather this branch of the work was stopped. The launch was engaged whenever the weather permitted in shoal developn1ent just southward of Brooke Point. и Additional work was done on the topographic sheet extending from Brooke Point to Narlz Point The sheet was left unfinished, however, on account of orders to proceed to :Manila. During the month o:t'. February while the ship was undergoing repairs at Engineer Island a line of levels was run from the automatic tide guage at Pier 5 to the Intendencia Building. The tide stat'l at Pier 5 was also replaced.

On March 13, 1918, the command of the steamer Romblon was transferred from Leonard H. Zeman to H. B. Campbell, at which time the Romblon was undergoing extensive repairs at Engineer Island, Manila. The repairs were completed on April 16, and on April 19 the Romblon sailed for the working grounds. On April 23 the vessel arrived at Brooke Point, Palawan, and rebuilt the tide staff. On the next day the launch party was put in camp to do hydrography, and the ship started sounding. Up to June 30 three trips were made to Sandakan, British North Borneo, for coal, a distance of nearly 200 miles. On these trips at least one camp party was left beind to continue field work. Both the ship and the launch were continuously engaged in sounding. Anticipating, from general reports, that the weather would be the most favorable at this season, every e:lfort was made to do as much sounding offshore with the ship as was practicable. The extent of this work, which is nearly all inside the 100-fathom curve, is shown on the progress sketch. The launch worked from camp, and besides filling in the gap west of Ursula Island continued the inshore hydrography to Nariz Point, and developed a number of dangerous shoals which had been located by the ship. Only sufficient topography was done to keep ahead of the launch party, as tt was considered best to keep the two kinds of work together. The topography was completed to Nariz Point. The main scheme in this locality having been completed, no observing was done. Seven intersection stations were built north of Nariz Point for control, three of them, between i;tatlons Narlz and Crawford, being built In tree tops. The remainder are in Island Bay. The approximate location of these stations is shown on the progress sketch. No observing was done. The staff at Brooke Point was read from 6 a. m. to 6 p. m. during this period. No opportunity ottered for observing currents without interference with other work, so none were observed.

On July 1 the Marinduque was at Manila undergoing repairs and outfitting. Upon the completion of these repairs the ship left Manila to resume work on the east coast of Palawan, arriving on the working grounds July 15. The next day a party was started to build and occupy triangulation station Anepahan, a 4,800-foot peak 17 miles Inland, while the rest of the party took up hydrography in Honda Bay. The only men available for the trlangukltion party were colonists from the Iwahig penal colony and civilized Tagbanuas, poor material, as exnerience had shown that the uncivili?Jed Tagbanuas living in almvst Inaccessible villages in the mountains were the best for this kiud of work. 'l'he difficulties In the way of reaching this station-its great distance in the interior of the island and its height-with such a poor party seemed alrnm<t insuperable, and for this reason no work was done on the triangulation pen<ling the ref'ults of this expedition. On July 29 after the party had been gone two weeks, sorul! stragglers reached the ship who reported that the party had lost their way and had run out of provisions. A relief expedition was immediately starte<l. The ship in the meantime had to run to Sandalrnn for coal. It was not until August 8, after an absence of 24 days, that the party was picked up; the station was occupied and all observations completed. Great cre<iit is due to the officer in charge especially tor his persistence after encountering difficulties that might well have discouraged him. This was a typical experience durin~ the prosecution of this triangulation, for there were stations such as Victoria, Cleopatra. and Stripe Peak that were even more difficult to reach. One can bdter appreciak the difficulties of those exredltions after reading Mr. Worcester's account, in his book, The Philippine Islands, pp. 115-124, of the difficulties encountered In the ascent of Thumb Peak, one of the " easy " stations In the scheme. As soon as the party had returned from Anepahan the ship went to Separation Point, and during the rest of the month of August, Sundays and week days, three observing parties were kept continuously at work on the stations at the southern end of the scheme, while a fourth party was engaged clearing at triangulation station Crawford, where some enormous hard wood (ipil) trees had to be cut down. The stations occupied were Sombrero, Arena, Calatugas, Pulute, Crawford, Albion, ilnd Alboaba in the main scheme, and the supplemental stations Tagallnog, Arrecife, Emelina, and Cay. Most of these stations were either difficult of access or requlr~ heavy clearing, or both. Albion Head, on the west coast, was reached by using au иalmost obliterated trail across the narrow part of the island at Separation Point to Alphonso XIII, where n native boat had to be secured, and then a precipitous cll:ft' 600 feet high had to be climbed. The native,; were afraid to make the ascent, as the place is reputed to be infested with fmukes, and the rocks are so sharp that their feet are always badly lacerated in making the ascent. Pulute, a 3,000-foot peak, 11 miles inland, was also reached from Separation Point, the trail passing through a fairly well-settled country. A considerable amount of clearing was done at this station. Both Aboaba and Crawford required a large amount of heavy cutting. Calatugas was a steep, hard climb, 2,500 feet, and required much clearing. The other stations were easy to reach. This work was finished on August 31, and after coaling at Sandakan the ship returned to Puerto Princesa where it was necessary to blow down in order to make some minor repairs to the boiler. The time was utilized in securing men and making preparations for two triangulation parties to occupy triangulation stations Central and Thumb Peak. While these parties were in the field the rest of the party, taking advantage of IL Rpell of fine weather, completed a large area of hydrography from Bold Point to Pasco Point, Including the development of a large number of shoalR. On September 22 the triangulation parties returned and the ship left for Manila for repairs and suppllell. During this stay at Manila the ship was hauled out, the bottom cleaned, and a new rudder stock iostalled. On October 17 the ship returned to the working grounds, and during the rest of the month was engaged on hydrography and topography In Honda Bay. One party completed the observations at triangulation stations Table Head and Sombrero.

During the first half of November the weather was very bad, with an unprecedentedly large rainfall, and work could be carried on only intermittently. However, as In this country a spell of bad weather is almost always followed by a spell of correspomlingly ftne weather, all preparations were made for prosecuting the work vigorously-ship was coale<l, extra hamlR secured, and parties advantageously distributed--i'!o that when the weather cleared up (about November 19) everything was rea<l~и for work. A topographic and three hydrographic parties were kept almost continuously at work until December 19, when the work was closed and the ship returned to Manila. During this month of fine weather (from November 19 to December 19) over a thousand miles of hydrography (most of it close development or deep-sea sounding, where it is difficult to run up large mileage) and over 50 miles of topography were completed, besides building an<l occupying 9 triangulation stations in the supplementary i;cheme. The rest of the month was spent at Manila repairing and laying up the ship. The results of the season's work are as foHows: The observations In the main-scheme triangulation were completed as for south as the line Pulute-Crawfor<l, where It joins the work being done by the party on the steamer Romblon, thus completing the nmln scheme down to the Mantangule base. One angle at Albion Head was not observed, the ohserver mistaking another peak for Anepuhan. The station is not very difficult to reach, but exceptionally clear weather ls required to observe this long line ( 67 kilometers) . Besides the supplementary stations already estahllshed at Malanao, Inage.uan, Emelina, and Cay, stations were placed on Arreclfe and Tagullnog Islands. Some fishermen stripped the latter signal of cloth (a valuable article among the natives) and made it impossible to observe this station from Calatugas and Pulute. All the observing was completed on the supplementary scheme 1n Puerto Princesa, and a supplementary scheme was carried between Malanao Island and the mainland. This latter scheme can be carried one or two figures farther northward. Control for topography south\vard of Sombrero Island can easily be obtained .by establishing supplementary stations, observing from main-scheme stations which are easy to reach. The topography of the shore line from Addison Point to Table Head was completed and contours were shown as far inland as possible. AH the work was done on a scale of 1 : 20,000. The hydrograpl1y has been carried down to Table Head, including Blnunsallan Bay, the entrance to Puerto Prlncesa, and all of Honda Bay, an<l extending out to about 800 fathoms; In some places out to the 1,000-fathom curve. All of Honda Bay, Including the complicated urea in thtи north"иest part of the bay, was thoroughly developed. All the Inshore area was covered with lines not more than 165 meters apart, even in depths of 25 fathoms. The shoal marked on the chart "10 P. D." in latitude 9░ 43', longitude 119и 03', was found In approximately the posltlon shown and de\иeloped. An immense area In Honda Bay of coral formation extending 10 miles offshore was thoroughly developed. A Une of deep-sea soundings was carried from latitude 9░ 13' N. northward while en route from Sandakan to Puerto Princesa. Some reconnolssance lines were run by the ship when running between triangulation stations. Many uncharted shoals were discovered. The office was kept informed so that notices of these shoals coul<l be published. The same stupen<lous slopes near the 100-fathom curve as were found around Pasl11: Shoal were also found along this stretch; a slope of 70 per cent (70 feet in 100 feet) was often encountered. An automatic tide gauge was kept continuously In operation at Puerto Prlncesa. Tide staft's were observed at Tinitiun, Babuyun, Makes! Island, and Village Rocks during the progress of hydrography in their respective vicinities. . The same remarkable tides mentioned In previous reports were recorded at Puerto Prlncesa.

close to shore a single observation of 2! knots was made, but the anchor would not hold, and the ship was swept away. Strong currents were noticed between this island and the mainland. Two stations were occupied for magnetic declination. The ship was swung for compass deviations (16 headings) In latitude 9░ 45' N., longitude 118░ 50' E., using a mnge of two trlnngulation stations instead of sun azimuths. The bearing was taKen both with the compass and the pelorus. On account of the high cost of coal in the Philippines, it was necessary to run to Sandakan, British North Borneo, 240 miles distant, for coal. However, it Is possible to coal so much faster at Sandakan than at Puerto Prlncesa that there was not a great loss of time. A deck load of coal was always taken.
[EOLINE R. HAND, Commanding Steamer Research.] SUMMARY OF REsur,Ts.-Topography: 10 sqnare miles of area surveyed, 25 miles of rivers surveyed, 2 miles of roads surveyed, 1 topographic sheet finished, scale 1 : 20,000. Hydrography: 58.5 square miles of area covered, 556.7 miles run while sounding, 2 189 positions determined (double angles), 8,221 soundings made, 2 tide stations established, 3 hydrographlc sheets finished, scales 1: 5,000, 1: 20,000, and 1 : 40,000.

The survey of Manila Bay, which was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year, was completed on August 24. The work done after June 30, comprised 55 square miles of ship hydrography in the center of the bay and topography and sounding up the Oran! and Pasag Rivers to the town of Guagua. The sounding in the center of the bay was continued on the 1: 40,000 scale sheet, wUh lines spaced about 250 meters apart, a .somewhat greater interval than that used on the 1: 20,000 sheets contiguous to the shore. The depths ranged between 9 and 20 fathoms, and the bottom was invnriably mud and remarkably even. The survey of the waterways to Guagua was desirable, since they are traversed regularly by the Manila steamers. As these rivers are bordered with swamps for the entire distance, the topography was difficult. It is all stadia tmverse with ample control. The soundings were between 2 and 5 fathoms. To determine the difference of time of tide turnings between the upper end, the mouths, and Manila, for reduction data, stations were established both at Sexmoan and Oran! for simultaneous readings, the standard being at Manila. A list of landmarks was furnished to be plotted on the revised issue of the chart of Manila Bay in order that the navigator may be able to accurately determine his position with reference to the plotted soundings, After the completion of the work of the steamer Research in Manila Bay and pending the return of the vessel to the Philippine Government, a smatt area of about one-half mile immediately behind the North Breakwater, Manila Bay, was closely seunded for the information of the division of port works, presumably as a basis for calculating the extent and cost of dredging operations. The launch was used in this work, and lines of soundings 20 meters apart were run about normal with the sea wan.

UHIBIT Oll' THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY AT THE SOUTHERN COMMERCIAL CONGBESB. [ISAAC WINSTON.)

An exhibit illustrative of the work and methods of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey was made at the meeting of the Southern Commercial Congress held in the Hotel Astor, New York City, from October 15 to 17, 1917. The space occupied was 13 by 29 feet, and the instruments were arranged to show the progress from astronomic work through geodetic work, magnetic work, topographic work, and hydrographic work to the chart as the finished product in the development of commer~e. Charts and statistics of the principal southern ports and of New York Harbor and approaches were shown. Six bureaus of the Department of Corr..merce, namely, the Steamboat-Inspection Service, the Census, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Bureau of Fisheries, Bureau of Lighthouses, and Coast and Geodetic Survey, participated, and the Chief Clerk of the Department of Commerce was present as the representative of the department in charge of the exhibit. The greater part of the hall was occupied by exhibits from several States showing their products and resources. и

[Isnc

WINSTON.]

An exhibit itlustratlve of the work and methods of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey was made at the National Motor Boat Show held in the Grand Central Palace, New York City, January 19 to 26, 1918. A spa41e 12 by 30 feet was assigned to the Survey on the mezzanine floor in the front of the building near the elevators, and a frarr,e with 10 large wings was procured for use in displaying charts and photographs. One hundred and eighty feet of wall space were also available for display purposes. A collection of charts and publications was prepared at the Coast and Geodetic Survey office to supplement the publications on hand at the field station. The articles for exhibit were delivered at the Grand Central Palace .January 18, and were placed in position on the following day and evening. On January 21 an officer detailed from the Washington oflice arrived arid served until the close of the exhibition. The charts showing Long Island Sound and the approaches to New York were joined so as to form a continuous whole, and attracted much attention. About 200 different charts fastened together ln series were displayed on tables, and they were examined with interest by many persons. Charts showing the wrecks that have occurred on the coast of Alaska, the relative size of different countries superimposed on the United States, the steamer routes of the world with distances between ports, the magnetic declination in the United Stutes, and the cloud formations as classified for observation purposes were placed on the wings of the chart exhibitor and on the wall space. All available chart catalogues, light lists, buoy lists, tables of distances between ports, catalogues of publications on nautical subjects, coast pilots, tide tables, inside route pilots, pilot rules, International Rules of the Road, Notices to Mariners, Nautical Almanacs, etc., were displayed on tables for the information of the public. These included publications of the Bureau of Lighthouses, the Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Orders were taken for charts, coast pilots, and tide tables. The chart of New York Harbor, made by the British before the Revolutionary War was taken from the field station to the show and attracted much attention. One copy of each of the publications referred to above was displayed as a sample of what was available for the use of mariners. The photographs were arranged in series on the wings of the chart exhibitor to illustrate the work of the Survey. и A considerable number of publications describing the work of the Survey and the elements of chart marking were distributed to visitors. The instruments shown were a sextant, three-arm protractor, parallel rule, and boat compass. A large national flag, a banner of tbe Secretary of Commerce, the Bureau i;:ervlce flag, and two Bureau banners were used as decorations and the sign Coast and Geodetic Survey wa's displayed. The exhibit was classed as "educational" in catalogue. No expense in connection with the exhibit was incurred on account of the Government, the Incidental expenses being paid by the National Motor Boat Show.
INSPECTION OF CHABT AGENCIES.

[H. R. GARLAND.]

In January an inspection was made of the agencies for the snle of Coast and Geodetic Survey charts and nautical publications at Baltimore (Md.), Wilmington (Del.), Philadelphia (Pa.), and New York City (N. Y.) for the purpose of examining their stocks of charts and pubHcatlons. At each agency the charts and publications were inventoried, the obsolete charts and publlcatlons condemned and destroyed, receipts therefore given, and copies sent to the office at Washington. The value of the charts and publications remalnklg on hand was computed, and the figures furnished to the agents as a basis for their reports. The methods of caring for the charts and publications and the general interest shown by the agencies in the sale of them were noted.

TRIAL COUR811 IN POTOMAC RIVllR FOR THи GllNllRAI SHJPBUJLDINO .t AllRO CO, [JllAN H. HAWLllY.)

In November, 1917, a trial course 1 nautical mile tn length was laid off In the Potomac River at Alexandria at the request of the General Shipbuilding & Aero Co. The work of laying out the trial course was begun November 13 and was concluded November 16. The spire on the belfry of the new Colored Catholic Church, at the corner of Wythe and Columbus Streets was selected as the rear range at the north end of the course, and the starting point for the traverse was located on the east curb of Fairfax Street, at a point where a Une perpendicular to the curb llne Intersects this spire. A wooden beacon was constructed on the bluff just east of Fairfax Street for the front range on this line. The traverse was run along the east curb of Fairfax Street for a distance of 1,853.25 meters. A 50-meter steel base tape under a tension of 10 kilograms was used In running this traverse. At the end of this traverse a line to establish the south end of the course W!ls laid off at right angles to the curb line and marked by two wooden range beacons. The Unes at right angles to the street were mem'lured with a 4-lnch theodolite set up ovt'r ench end of the traverse, the curb line being used as the initial line in each case.

TRIAL COURl!lll FOR DIRIOIBLиS.

[H. P. IlITTll:R.]

In compliance with a request from the Navy Department, 11 determination was made in August, 1917, of the length of a trial course for dirigibles, located in Portage County eastward of the aviation grounds and about 12 miles southeast of Akron, Ohio. The course had been laid out by the engineers of the Goodyeal' Tire & Rub~r Co. to be used in connection with their aviation s~hool and for the official trials of the United States naval diril!lbles. The course was designed to be 2 nautical miles long" and each encl and the middle are marked by a range consisting of иtwo range poles set at right angles to the course. The poles are 50 feet apart and near the top have wires stretched between them for the purpose of observing from the ground the time of transit of the dirigibles across the range. The direction of the course ls north and south and parallels the road passing through the town of Suffield. The ranges are placed just west of the road. The surface of the ground along the cours.e Is undulating and ranges between about 1,150 and 1,250 feet above mean sea level. The measurements for the length of the course were made along the edge of_ the road on a line parallel to the course and at right angles to the ranges. Hubs 50 meters apart were set along the line and a forward and backward measure made. A line of levels was run over the measured line, and corrections for the slopes of the ground determined. Field work was completed August 24.
