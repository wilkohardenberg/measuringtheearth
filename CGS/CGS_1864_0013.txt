REPORT.
CAMBRIDGE, MASS,, Octobf!r

26, 18G4.

Sm : I have the honor to tmbmit, iu conformity wiLh the law and regulations of the Treasury Department, the following report on tlie progress made in the survey of the coast of the United States during the surveying year, which will end with the present month. The general progress in the work under my superintendence has been summed up from time to time in previous reports. It. is not now needful to recapitulate in detail, as our parties on southern sections of the coast are yet employed in local surveys to facilitate military operations, or for the use of blocka~ing "ct uadrons, in accordance with the policy adopted by the department at the outset of the rebellion. The la1·ge manuscript map, prepared under act of Congress of l\iarch 3, 1853, and as directed by the act, preBented annually since that date, shows the progress up to the present time. In a gf,neral way the progress is shown alw by the small engraved sketch (No. 37) which accompanies this report . .A brief statement of the work of the present year will be given to show the adaptation of the survey in all parts of its organization to the present requirements of the government Eervice. The war has not essentially chl1nged the distribution of the working parties. .About the same number as were heretofore assigned to duty on the southern coast has been in surveying service with the national forces in the rebellious States. Four parties have acted under the orders of Admiral Lee; three, with as many vessels, under .Admiral Dahlgren, and two under Admiral Porter. For the military service in Eastern Virginia and l\farylaud six parties were employed during parts of the season; in West Virginia three parties, at Knoxville two parties, at Nashville two, at Chattanooga five· previous to and dming the movement on the rebel works at Missionary Ridge; two parties accompanied the army in Louisiana and Texas, and one was attached to the Florida tax commission. From the several officers in whose commands the parties were associated warm acknowlegments have been reiterated as to the importance of the services rendered, and their bearing on the success of military and naval operations. 'l'he body of the report will contain, as usual, notices of the work in detail. Very brief mention will here he made of the localities and nature of this class of operations, and after it mention of the advance made in the regular progress of the survey of the coast.
SERVICE WITH ARMIES AJW DLOCKADING SQUADRONS.

The survey has been kept in full co-operation with the blockading squadrons, and with the armies of the Union, as heretofore. In the vicinity of Baltimore the survey of ground connected with the defences has been continued by Sub-Assistant Iardella, and during part of the season by Assistant C. M. Bache. The topography of the approaches to the capital has been further extended beyond the northeast boundary of the Distri<!t of Columbia, by Sub-Assistant .E'crguson. A minute topographical survey has been made of Arlington Heights by Messrs. Hergesheimer and McMath for the War Department, and special determinations for the effective use of. heavy artillery at Washington, New York, and Boston, by Assistant Schott. Sub-Assistant Donn is now engaged in surveying the approaches to the fords of the Potomac above and below Harper's Ferry. In West Virginia the latitude and longitude have been determined at eleven military posts by Assistant Dean and Sub-Assistant Mosman, and the magnetic variation at most of them by Mr. S. II. Lyman. At Clarksburg, Virginia, Mr. Lindenkohl assisted in compiling the military map of West Virginia, and computed the latitude of numerous points from the sextant obse1·vations of the late Lieutenant J. R. Meigs, formerly chief engineer of the department. Sub-Assfatant Rockwell, before making a plane-tnble survey of Strawberry Plains and of the city of Knoxville and itt:1 defensive works, in which duty lie was associated with Mr. R.H. Talcott, was engaged in similar service at Sewall's Point, Virginia. .Assi~tant West. after :reconnaissance duty, which terminated with the battle of Missionary Ridge, Tennessee, was in the same way employed at Bermuda Hundred, Virginia. Sub-Assistants Dorr and Donn made plane-table surveys of the environs and defences of Nashville and of Chattanooga, Tennessee, previous to the repulse of the enemy in

2

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT 01<'

tlie south approach to that city; and J\fr. Donn, in conjunction witl1 J\fr. J\Iarindin, afterwards rendered similar service for the army near Petersburg, Yirginia. Sub-Assistant Boyd has made a complete survey of the battte-field of Chickamauga, Georgia, and is now under orders to rejoin tbe army at Chattanooga. In connexion with the North Atlantic blockading equadron, Mr. Strausz, and subsequently Mr. Cordell, have made resurveys of the bar and channel into Beaufort harbor, North Carolina. 'I'he last-named officer sounded the 11arbor, and the entire channel whi(h leads from Beuufort through t]ie straits and through Core sound, marking also its course by buoys and stakes. 'l'he same pai·ties reset the buoys between the bar and :Fort ·Macon to conform to the changes found liy the resurveys. Mr. Strausz also made a resurvey of Hatteras inlet, and Boumled out a Atretcb of six miles of the Neuse river below New Berne, marking the channels in Loth localities by buoys. The triangulation of the Neuse river was at the same time continued by Assistant Fairfield. Sub-Assistant Halter made a triangulation and shore line survey of Crnatan sound, and of Roanoke river, North Ca;olina, above and below Plymouth. These waters were thoroughly sounded by Sub-Assistant Bradford, and the cllllnnel through tlie latter was marked by spar-buoys. He has since sounded Trcnts' Reach, in James river, Virginia, and is now engaged in tl1e survey of Bogue sound. A careful reconnaissance of the Cape Lookout shoals has been made by Lieutenant Commander Phelps with the surveying steamer Corwin. Attached to tl1e South Atlantic l1lockading squadron, and for service also with the military forces, three partieR with the ·surveying steamer Vixen, and schooners Bailey and Caswell, wern assigned. Assistant Boutelle, besides the complete development of the cbannels at present leading into Charleston harbor, in which also Assistant Edwards was engaged during part of the season, reset the buoys, and prepared new sailing directions. Under his direction :Folly river and Ligl1t-house inlet have been sounded by Sub-Assistant VI~ c1ber; the hydrograpl1y of V\- assaw sound has been continued, and a resurvey made of the bar and channel of tbe St. J olm's river to a point near J\fayport J\Iills. As heretofore, his party in the Vixen, in charge of Acting }faster Platt, performed the pilot service required for the vessels of the South Atlantic squadron. Sub-Assistant Dennis made smveys for ddensivc wrffks at l'ilatka, Florida, extended the survey of the St Juhn's river above Jacksonville, and d11ring tlie military mov1ements in that vicinity made a reconnais~ance At Port Royal he surveyed Bay 0 f the roads leading towards St. Augustine, Picolata, and l\fayport Mills. Point and Land's End for naval pmposes, and on Morris and Folly islands surveyed the shore lines of the inland passage between Light-house inlet and Folly river. J\fr. J\Icl\fath was on service with the United ~tates tax commissioners for :Florida, at Fernandina and at St. Augustine. He also furnished for military use a copy of the county map, showing the int.crior of Florida beyond Jacksonville. In the military department of tbe Gulf, Assistant Oltmanns served on the staff of Major General Franklin, and made 8urvPys aloug the route of the 19th army corps, including the environs of Vermilionville Opelousas, "\Vashington, and .l<'rnnklin, Louisiana. Sub-Assistant Ho6mer was present with the army detachment at Aransas Pass, 'I'exas, and located the position of the rebel works on a map, after determining the changes that had taken place in the depth of water on the bar of that pas8. He performed similar duty at ·Pass Cavallo, traced and marked tlie changes which had occurred at the eastern end of Matagorda island, and buoyed the channel into McHenry bayou. After joining the staff of Brigadier General.Grover, in January, Mr. Hosmer made surveys at Madisonville and Morganza, LouiBiana, and at Fort Adams, Mississippi. Both of these officers accompanied the army of Major General Banks through the Red river campaign. On the Mississippi river, and for the use of the squadron under Admiral Porter, Assistant Gerdes made a topographical survey of Grand Gulf and its vicinity, and sounded tbe channel abreast of that post. This was followed by a reconnaissance which included the shore and channel of about fifty miles _of the course of the Mississippi, between Rodney and Vicksburg. He made also a minute survey of the Ohio river and its shores from Mound City to Cairo, Illir.ois, with soundings relative to inquiries concerning a navy yard site, Sub-.'\Bsistant :Fendall assisted in this important survey, and was afterwards on duty with the gunboats which passed up Red 1·iver to act in concert with the land forces. 'l'he tranefer of some of these parties from one locality to another, as service required, has been noticed in the abstract just given; the transfer of otliers therein mentioned for prosecuting the usual work of the survey will appear fo the short summary which follows.

GENERAL STATEMENT OF PROGRESS.

In connexion with the followiug summary, it should be borne in mind that many of the operations referred to under tlie preceding head have added to the material requisite for the usual publications of the survey.

UNIT.l<~D

STATES COAST SURVEY.

3

In the northern sections of the Atlantic coast the regular operations of the survey have been continued, and the parties here enumerated are now at work: Sub-Assistant Dennis, in the topography of the lower part of Passamaquoddy bay, Mai11c; Assistaw Fairfield, in coast triangulation neat· :l\louut Desert island; and Assistant l\IcCorkle, in similar duty in Penobscot river, near Bangor; Sub-Assistant Dorr, in the topography of islands at the entrance of Penobscot bay; Sub-Assistant Ferguson, at the entrance of St. George's river, Maine; Assistant West, on the shores of Boothbay, l\Iaine; Mr. Mc~Iath, on the east side of the Sheepscot river; Assistant Adams is completing plane-table work on the shores of the water passages which enter the Kennebec, near Bath, Maine; Assistant R. M. Bache, on the shores of the Kennebec, above Bath; and SubAssistant Longfellow, on the survey of islands on the east side of Casco bay. Sub-Ao;sistant Webber has sounded the St. George's i·iver, :Maine, and its approaches; Mr. Strausz, the waters of Quohog bay, M:aine; and Lieutenant Commander Phelps has extended the hydrography eastward of the approaches to Portland entrance. Assistant J\Iitchell has examined the known dangers to navigation in Eastport harbor aml ];Inscle Ridge channel, (Penobscot bay,) and indicated the position of desirable aids to navigation. He has also continued work connected with the special survey of Boston harbor for the United States commissioners. The detailed survey of the shores of Narragansett bay is in progress by Assistant Harrison and Sub-Assistant Hosmer. On the eoast of Connecticut the work of connecting the primary base lines in Sections I and II bas been continued by my own party:, and Assistant Blunt has extended the triangulation which connects the primary work with points on the Hudson river. The detailed topography of the shores of the Hudson has been extended by Assistant \Yhiting near Sing-Sing and Haverstraw. The hydeography near Sandy Hook has been re-examined by Assistant 11litchell, t11e results, as heretofore, having reference to the labors of the engineer department. Assistant C. M. Bache has been engaged at the highlands of Niwe~ink, New Jersey. The work of verification on the coast of New .Jersey hai; been extemled hy AE<ilistant Farley to include Absecom inlet; the shores of Absecbm harbm LavP been resurveyed by Mr. H. \V. Bitche, and the hydrography of the approaches and of the inlet execut;ecl hy Lieutenant Commander Phelps. Assistant Mitchell made a special examination relativn to the effect of the ice drift in the Delaware river dming the winter of 1863-'G4 for the Navy Department. Tidal observations have been kept up at the permanent stations, at Eastport and Portland, Maine, Charlestown, ~fas~achusetts, h1 New Y mk harbor, and at Old Point Comfort; and magnetic observations at Eastport and Kl'y We:>t. On the Pacific coast of the United States the triangulation along the Santa Barbara channel and betweeu :Monterey bay and San Francisco has been co11ti11ued, and that of Suisun bay ill in progre;;s. The topogra11hy and in-shore hydrography between Point San Pedro and 'I'unitas creek have been completed, and a resmvey has been made of :Mare Island strait, in'Huding the approaches to the navy yard. 'I'he great enhancement of prices during the present year has unavoidably been felt in om operations. It is, however, a matter of gratification that the results here sketched compare favornbly with those of the preceding year8 of tl1e war. On the Pacific coast only has the progress of the work been sensibly rntarcled by the effect of the basis of curr1mcy in nse there. In office-work numerous direct calls have been met from generals and naval officers for tracings on the full scale of such sheets of the Coast Survey as were applicable to their purposes; these have been very generally found available in siege operations and in blockading service. Copies of maps for immediate use have in all cases been furnished to the naval and military commanders, to whose forces the parties have been, attached. The tangible evidence of utility thus presented to a class of minds eminently practical has continued to elicit the warm commendation which marked our first connexion with the military and naval forces of the government at the outset of the waL". Of the regular charts of the Coast Survey nearly thirty-seven thousand copies have been clistriLatcd during the past year. In this aggregate are included twenty-three thousand copies whicb were supplied to the navy. The compilation of maps for use in the armies and to illustrate their operations has been continued, and the several sheets include, on a uniform scale, by far. the greater part of the area of the States in rebellion. The region embraced in the great campaign of Major General Sherman beyond Chattanooga was mapped at the office at his request, and by diligent exertion the sheets intended for the use of his army were completed and forwarded before the opening of the campaign. The call from public officers in the civil· and military service fo1· this class of information has become general. Of all kinds, {excluding charts,) seventeen thousand copies have been distributed or sold during the, year, the sales, as heretofore, reimimrsing for. the publication.

bay, as a preliminary chart, have been completed. Progress has been made in the drawing aud engraving of Bodega bay, upper part of San Francisco bay, and chart of the I'acific coast from Point Pinos to Ilodega Head. A new edition has been prepared of 1VaHl1ington sound, witlt adclitions and correclions, and additions have been made to the other plates previously engraved.
MAPS AND CHARTS.

In the regular progress of the work of publication, m1my of the early sketches and preliminary m1itiomi of charts, issued to make the information obtained by the survey available to the public as soon as practicable, are superseded by or absorbed in the more finished charts, which are prepared as the information accumulates, especially those which embrace the whole coast in a connected series, on a scale of R"oiuo· This process must be kept in mind when following the reported advance of variou3 maps and chart8 from year to year, and in comparing the catalogue of charts (Appendix No. 10) now issued by the Coast Survey Office to the government vessels, or sold to the commercial marine, with annual statements of plates engraved. Thus a chart. of an important locality will be first published with the bare shore-line, soundings, channel curves, and sailing directions-an incomplete form-but still containing the information most important for the navigato1·. V\'hile an electrotype copy of this plate is used for printing, the engraving of the original is continued; the shoals are made con8picuous by sanding; other hydrographic details are added as they are developed by the survey ; and the outlines of the topography are engraNed, bringing the map to a second stage, in which it is again issued, superseding the fir8t, but titill remaining a preliminary edition. 'l'his also is 1irinted from eleetroty{le copies, while the original is receiving the finished representation of topography, as hills, woods, fields, marsh, &c., together with views, and all requisite notes and tables, so as to form at length the finished map, which alone is retained in the catalogue. Seventy-four sheets have been worked upon iu the drawing division within the past year. Fourteen of this number were first-class maps and charts of la1·ge size; eight first-class, and twenty-four preliminary harbor charts and sketches; twelve sheets were intended for engraving on stone, or for 11hntograpl1ic reduction, and sixteen were progress sketches. Fifty-six sheets have been completed, and eighteen are in progress. Of the hydrographic sheets completed, two are large charts of the coast series, and twenty-six harbor charts, most of which were for issue in preliminary form. In the engraving division two first-class maps and charts have been completed within the year. Bight plates of second-class charts and sketches have also been engraved, and two diagrams. Nine preliminary editions have been engraved preparatory to their final completion. Twenty-three plates are now in progress, of which five we1·e commenced within the year. This gives a total of twenty-four plates completed, and twenty-three in progress, or forty-seven plates worked upon during the year . .A.11 the details in regard to the production and distribution of maps and charts will be found in the report of the assistant in charge of the office. (Appendix No. 10.) , The following fa a lillt of charts arranged in geographical order which are either the result of the present season's work, or, having been heretofore prepared, have not yet appeared in any annual repo:'t, fol' reasons of public policy, although issued to public vessels. Such of this number as it may b.c deemed expedient to publish at the time will appear with this report, as will some others which have not heretofore been published in any annual report in the present finished state, viz : the three sheets of Long !'Bland sound, and the upper three sheets of Chesapeake bay, together with the necessary sketches, to illustrate the prugress uf the survey : Eastport harbor, Maine. Rockpol't and Camden harbors, Maine. St. George's river, Maine. Kennebec aJ:ld Sheepscot rivers, with Boothbay harbor, Maine. Lynn harbor, Massachusetts, resurvey of 1864.

SPECIAL SURVEYS.

The physical survey of Boston harlmr has been continued under my directiou by Assistant Henry Mitchen. Most of the work of the present season was confined to the tabulation and arrangement of data needed by the commission, aut110rized to advise in regard to the preservation of the harbor. The commis~ion, as stated in previous reports, consisted of the late Chief Engineer, General Joseph G. Totten, Admiral C.H. Davis, and myself. 'I'he expenditures for the work, a~ heretofore, have been defrayed by the city authorities of Boston. At the request of tlm Navy Department a special examination was made in the course of last winter as to the effect of floating ice in two localities of the Delaware river, which had .been under consideration as sites for a navy yard. Numerous surveys which might be noticed under this head., being specially called for by generals in command of armies in the field, will be mentioned under the heads of sections in the report corresponding to the localities of the work.
TIDE TABLES FOR MARINERS.

The tide tables for the use of navigators are given in a revised form in Appendix No. 8. In addition to the usual number printed with the annual report, one thousand eopies were prepared in pamphlet form during the first year of the war.

With the former is included a general description of the peculiarities observed in the tides at 'l'ahiti, the largest of the Society islands in the South Padfic ocean.
INFORMATION FURNISHED.

A list showing special items of information furnished from the office during the year is given in .Appendi:ic No. 2. While calls arising in the ordinary course of enterprise have been lessened, those connected with military and naval operations have largely increased. Besides the items given in the list, numerous appliea tions belonging to the same general class, but more local in character, have been answered at the office. The regulation of the department requiring acknowledgment in the title of a.ny publication embodying information procured from the Coast Survey office has been strictly observ~d. In addition to the matter usually given under this head, assis.tance has been rendered to the artillery department of the army for the determination of ranges of ricochet gunnery' with fifteen-inch and twenty-inch guns. The experiments were made under the direction of General A. P. Howe, inllpector of artillery United States army, and the operations for measuring the ranges of each impact of the projectile are stated at length in the Appendix, Nos. 21 and 22, by Assistant Schott. He also furnished a set of equations determining the trajectory of ricochet shot, and applied them in practice 'to illm;trate their use. Mr. Schott vii!ited two batteries on the Potomac, three forts in New York harbor, and one in Boston harbor, where the necessary measurements were taken. At each of these places temporary frameworks were erected, and the range lines were marked for given linea of fi.ro.

11

In Appendix X o. 15 the publication of geographical po~itions is resumed in part, in continuation of similar lists given biennially in my report for 1859 and preceding years. The register of position!' on thA southern coast is still reserved in the office. The total number of positions thus far given in latitude and longitude deduced from the triangulation is eight thousand two hundred and seventeen. Any small diff<erences between the publications since the year J851 are due to the effect of later and accumulated material, geodetic and astronomical, which has been brought to bear on the results.
GEODESY.

The geodetic connexion of the Epping base line with the primary triangulation passing thrnugh the eastern States, offers so instructive au example of the process of reduction followed in the computations of the Coast 8urvPy, and of the application of the ·method of least squares, that I have giveu in full Assistant Schott's report on the subj Pct, in Appendix No. 14; that paper may be regarded as an extension of Appendix No. 33 S, in my annual report for 185!. It exhibits the combination of resulting auglcs from measures of directions and from measures of angles by repetition, and assigns the relative weights to the results. The residuals in the sum of the angles of the triangles arc shown, and proper weights are given to the conditional equations depending upon the closing of the t1·iangles as well as (primarily) upon the probable errors of the measured directions or angles. The thirty-five normal equations were solved by the indirect niethod of elimination. The report by Mr. Schott concludes with a statement of the resulting angles and computations of the sides of the triangles. It is proper to remark that t.hP, length used for the Epping base in this report, though very nearly so, is not the final length, which can be deduced only from certan cumparisons that remain to be made.
LONGITUDE.

The computations for the longitude of American stations from the European meridian, by Pleiades occultations, have been continued under the direction of Professor Benjamin Peirce, of Harvard, according to the comprehensive plan developed by him, and befurn alluded to in my annual reports. His remarks (Appendix No. 11) give such prnmise of agreement in results as will justify the expectations founded on the adoption of the method. The computations of differences of longitude between American stations, determined heretofore by the telegraphic method, have been continued by Dr. B. A. Gould. In addition to the i·esults formerly reported, the longitudes of Raleigh, N. C., Wilmington, N. 0., and Columbia, S. C., have been definitely settled, giving a total of twelve stations determined in longitude south of Washington. The report of Dr. Gould is given in Appendix No. 12. The telegraphic difference of longitude between New York and Washington, deduced some years ago without the advantage of recent improvements in instruments, is somewhat uncertain. There ~s also a small geodetic differencf\ which enters into that determination. It is, therefore, desirable that the telegraphic method should be again applied for a new determination of the difference of longitude between the two cities. The list of fundamental star places, used in longitude determinations, has been submitted to a new discussion, and the declinations of the time star list have also been determined. The investigation of the diurnal motion in azimuth of the transit instruments has been continued, and new results found strongly confirmatory of previous inferences. '!'his subject is receiving attention in other quarters. Hereafter it must be brought into the determination of star places in order to obtain tlw best results prncticable.
MAGNETISM,

The series of papers containing a discussion of the magnetic observations made at Girard College, Philadelphia, from 1840 to 1845, contained in some of tlie preceding annual reports, is brought to a dose this year by the insertion of the last three parts, Nos. X, XI, and XII, contained in the Appendix, Xos. 16, 17, mid 18. To facilitate the reference to the separate parts, I herewith give an aostract of the headings and general contents: SECTION I.-Part I-Coast Survey report, 1859, Appendix No. 22-Iuvestigation of the eleven (or ten) year period in the amplitude of the solar-diurnal variation, and of the disturbances of the magnetic declination.

I proceed to a more detailed account of the contents of the three parts contained iu this volume: Part X (Appendix No. 16) analyzes the disturbances of the dip aud total force. The instrumental quantities given are the differential readings of the horizontal and vertical components of the magnetic force expressed in scale divisions, and corrected for progressive change and effect of changes of temperature. Each entry was marked as a disturbance that differed as much as, or more than. ± 30 scale divisions from the normal of the vertical force, and as much as, or more than, ± 33 scale divisions from the normal of the horizontal force, and was transcribed aud converted into its equivalent part of the respective force. 'Vhen but one of the components was di5turbed, the contemporaneous value of the other component was also inserted; a chronological table of the disturbances of the two components was thus formed, and the corresponding value,; of differences from the normal dip, (expressed in minutes of arc,) and from the total force, (iu parts of that force,) were computed by their well-known geometrical relations. By an extended use of the criterion ± L' 1 was recognized as the limit, beyond which the disturbed values of the dip commence, and ± 0.00094 parts of the force as the corresponding limit of the total force di11turbances. There remained, then, for discussion 1,446 disturbances of the dip. The first two tables contain the aggregate amount and number of disturbances of the dip for each month, diYided into those wliich increase and those which decrease the dip; also the resulting monthly ratios and laws of progression. The next two tables exhibit the changes due to the eleven-year period, in the aggregate amount and number of disturbances, for increasing and decreasing values. The diurnal inequality of the disturbances is next shown for the aggregate amount and uumber, and the law of progression is exhibited fOl' both, increasing and 1lecrcasing inclination, together with the average diurnal effect. The homs of maxima aud minima, and the degree of correspondenee or divergence in each case, are pointed out. l>isturbancQB increa8ing the dip, upon the whole, preponderate. A table of disturbances, distributed according to their size, concludes this part of the inquiry. The disturbances, 1,470 in number, of the total force are next taken up and treated in precisely the same manper as those of the di11, and their annnal and diurnal distribution, and change for the eleven-year period, are shown by means of ratios. This part concludes with tables of the average diurnal effect, and of the distribution of the disturbances of the total force according to their size. Whenever practicable, comparisons of these rather int1icate laws of the disturbances with corresponding ones, deduced from the Toronto observations, are instituted and commented upon. Part XI (Appendix: No. 17) treats of the solar diurnal and annual inequality of the dip and total force. The combinatiou of the two experimental components to form the dip and total force was effected as follows: Owing to the eleven-year inequality contemporaneous readings only, of the two parts, can be admitted for combination. The observations of the horizontlll force frum July, 1840, to July, 1841, are therefore here omitted. By means of a preceding paper (Part V) a table was made out of hourly values (expressed in scale divisions, corrected for progressive and temperature changes, and freed from the larger disturbances) of the horizontal force; each value was compared with its corresponding monthly normal, and the dilference converted into parts of the force. The same was done with.respect to the vertical force, by means of numbers, given in Part VIII. The differential values, expressed in minutes of arc, for the dip, and in parts of the force for the total force, were then computed by the formulre, connecting these elements with their components. The semi-annual inequality of the dip, found by comparison of the summer and winter means with the annual means,

has its turning epocl1s about the middle of April and October. 52 a. m., I p. m., 3 p. m., and 7 p. m. are hours of no semi-annual change; greateAt clrnnge at l 0 a. m.; secondary change at 6 p. m.; nmge O.' 51 and 0. 1 18 nispectivdy. The diurnal inequality of the clip iR shown analytieally and grn.phically for eaeh month, alim for the summer and winter half year, and for the whole year. The general character of the last curve sl10ws a maximum about 11 a. m., and a minimum about 5 a. m., with a range of l.'2. In summer these epochs occur earlier, range 1.'5, and in winter later, range 1. 10. There is also a secondary maximum and minimum. The diurnal range of the dip is greatest about the time of the equinoxes, less in winter, greater in s_ummer. The aft.ernoon minimum disappears about the time of the e(1uinoxes, and is best marked about the time of the solstices. Principal epochs of the normal dip, when best marked, are 7 h.. 22m. a. m. in. summer, 8lt. 33m. a. m. in winter, and 7h. 50m. a. m. for the whole year. 'l'he Remi-annual im'quality of the total force has itR turning epoch about tbe 4th of April ancl 12th of September. 6 a. m. and 7 p. m. are hours of no semi.annual rang~; greatest change about 2 a. m and 4 p. m.; 1·ange 0.00037 and 0.00033 parts of the force. The diurnal imiquality of the total force consists of a single crested curve, on the average, during the year, but in winter it aB::iUml~S a double progression. The principal maximum in summer occurs about 2 p. m., and in winter one hour and a half earlier; the principal minimum in summer occurs about 10 p. m., and in winter two hours earlier. Sumrne1· range nearly 0.0009; winter range nearly 0.0004 parts of the force. The hours a. m. in summer and a. m. in winter an' epochs of normal total force. The paper concludes with an attempt to deduce the annual inequality of the dip and total force, and is illustrated with several diagrams. (Sketch No. 38.) Part XII (Appendix No. 18) contains the results and discussion of the obsen·ations for dip, obtaiued with a Robinson dip circle, the same instrument which was employed i11 the magnetic sttrvt'Y of Penneylvania and adjacent States. The series commence i11 January, 1842, and terminat.ll iu July, 18·14; the observations were macle weekly. There are, 11owever, some breaks. Needle Xo. 1 was employed, with but a fow exceptional cases, throughout the series; the casual results by three other needles have been referred, by comparirnn, to this standard nee<lle. Tbe montbly and annual rnmm dips arll tabulated, the latter indicating an annual decrease of 1.12. There is also a collection of dip results, taken at Philadelp!ti,l, compiled from various sources, and properly arranged. By grouping these the secular chauge of the dip i,~ expressed by a formula involving the time and square of the time. A comparison of t11e observed and computed dips assigns a probable error of ± 4 '8 to each represented value. Thll minimum dip occurs about J·an11ary, 1840. The discussion closes with a table of magnetic constants for five epochs, and for the mean epoch January, 1843, of the declination, the dip, and the horizontal, vertical, and total force. A comprehensive index (Jf all the parts is added to Appendix ~o. 18. \Vith these papers is presented one containing results of magnetic observations in the United 8tateo; by the late Professor J. N. Nicollet, between 1832 and 1836, made out from the manuscript record by Assistant Charlei3 A. Schott, under my immediate direction, and nt my own expense. These results, though partly incomplete and not of an accuracy attainable by methods and instruments now in use, may, it is thought, be of use in investigating the secular change. The paper is given in Appendix ~o. 19. The ob~ervations had ~ver been published, and the value of the results are enhanced because of tlie comparatively early period of the observations and the occupation of some localities not visited by other magnetists. It contains the m11gnetic horizontal force at nine stations, in Maryland, Missouri, Tenrtes8ee, Georgia, Sbuth Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Minnesota; aud the inclination at sixteen stations in the Statlls just ment.ioned, a11d iucludiug also Keutue~y. North Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida; also the declination at one station in Virginia. Some of the results were compared with such later oues as could be found in records by other observers.

The annual progress in this section l1as not been at any time lessened by the war, advantage being taken of tl1e season of the year for the assignment of parties, as, when their services were least called for in the southern sections, or whcll, by the advance in military operations their services were not immediately needed. A comparison with the progress made in former years will show favorably for the work done this season. A condensed abstract of all the operations and parties is given in Appendix No. ]. In the descriptions which here follow, tho same clmisification will be observed generally. Triangulation ef Union Rfoer bay, Mainc.-Tl1is work connects with the triangulation of Blue Hill bay, af'I will Le seen by reference to Sketch No. 2. Assistant G. A. Fairfield, with a party in the schooner Jam es Hall, resumed duty in this section on the 15th of August. After visiting the connecting stations on the 1>hores of Blue Hill bay, a reconnaissance was made and signals were erected for extending the triangulation ea.stwmd to Mount Desert island, and northward to Ellsworth. The southern limit of the work is Bass harbor. The angfos wen~ measured with the ten-inch theodolite, No. 91. Mr. Horace Anderson aided in I.he field-work.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Topography between the Kf'nnebec and Androscoggin rivers, Maine.-The unfinished work on the neck or peninsula at the junction of the Androscoggin and Kennebec rivers was resumed on the 12th of August by Assistant R. M. Bache. About four miles of shol'e-line were run additional to the previous work, and details were filled in to extend the topography towards Bruu'swiek, along the south shore of the Androscoggin. The additional work done by the party is embraced on the published chart of the Kennebec and Sheepscot rivers. Supplementary topography in Casco bay.-The work of filling in with details the plane-table sheet of' . Great Jebeig, Cousins, Littlejohn's and other islands, and part of the Cumberland shore of Casco bay .was taken up in the latter part of June by Assistant A. W. Longfellow. The shore-line had been previously traced. The contouring of the interior occupied the party until the 2Zd of September, the aggregate of lines run in that duty being eighty-five miles. Mr. Longfellow then traced the shore.line of the Gurnet, lying between Orr's island and Siibaskahegan or Great island. Eight miles of shore were traced in this part of the bay. The high wooded shores ml,\de it necessary to work with the plane-table by intersections. This service was continued until the 4th of November. At the outset of the season Mr. Longfellow attended to the refitting and delivery to other assistants of the vessels left during the winter in his charge at J'ortland. His own party used the schooner Meredith for the duty in Casco bay. Topograplty ef Narraganset bay.-The shore-line survey being complete, Assistant A. M. Harrison commenced the detailed plane-table survey on the 8th of August, in the vicinity of Bristol, and continued work in the field until the 15th of N overnber. The sheet turned in includes the shores of Warren, Barrington, aud Kickemuit rivers, Bristol harbor, the entfre eastern shore of Mount Hope bay, and part of the main shore of Narraganset bay, as well as tbe towns of Bristol and Warren, and the peninsula known as Bristol Neck. Sub-Assistant C. Hosmer was attached to the party of Mr. Harrison, and worked with a second planetable. He was employed in the first half of tbe working season in Sections VIII and IX.

Some of the previous work of this party is shown on the charts of Bristol bay and Newport ha1·bor, given with this report as Sketches Nos. 11 and 12. Hydrography ef St. George's rii;e1-, Maine.-This work was completed by the party of Sub-Assistant F. P.Webher, between the 19th of August and the 4th of November.. The hydrography is embraced in two sheets, one showing the soumlings between the entrauce of the river and the narrows; the other the soundings a.hove and extending as far as Thomaston. A temporary tidal station was used for each sheet. Near the mouth of Herring Gut harbor, (Sketch No. 2,) Mr. Webber connected his work with some of the lines of sonndings run by the party of Mr. Cordell in 1863. The shore-line for the hydrographic sheets was furnished by Sub-Assistants Ferguson and Dorr. Mr. Cleveland Abbe was attached to the party as aid during the season, and Messrs. C. P. Dilla.way, Franklin Platt, jr., and M. M. Defreea during part of it. The schooner ~~d by the party for transportation was returned to Portland at thjl clo!Hl of the

Point peninsula, (Sketch No. 2,) the soundings were prosecuted until the 17th of October. In the northern part of the bay some boat soundings yet remain to be made after the completion of the Rhore-linc survey. Quohog hay being one of the most rocky of the harbors of refuge on the coast of Maine, i>lr. Strausz rnn epecial lines of soundings in all the localities known at pre:,.ent as being dangerous. His clrnrt urnrk~ twf'utyone such localities, the principal of which are Charity Lerlge, with fifteen foet, about half a mile from Jaquish island, bearing l'ast; Sister Grounds, with seven and a half feet, about a milr~ north hy en~t of \Yliite Bull island, a little to the westward of the channel leading into Cundie';; luu·bor, and two other rocks without name, with five feet water on them lying, respectively, off Pond and Ram islands. Mr. Strausz was aided in the hydrography by Messrs. L. A Sengtelle1· awl 0. S. Hein. Other duty performed by the party will he mentioned under the head of Sections II and IV.

Hydrography <!fl Portland entrance, Maine.- Within the present season soundings have been extended southward and eastward about fifteen nautical miles beyond the previous limit of the hyd,.ography at the entrance of Casco bay. Lieutenant Commander ·r. S. Phelps. United States navy, Assistant Coast Survey, took up the off-iihore hydrography on the first of September, with a part.y in the steamer Corwin, and completed soundings within about fifty square miles. Some of the lines run with the steamer extend broad off, and include about Bixty additional square miles, but are yet to be crossed by other lines of soundings.

The steamer Corwin returned to New York early in Novemhm·. Referring to the character of the hydrograpl1y, Lieutenant Commander Phelps obserYes that " sufficient has been accomplished to show that Yesscls uncertain of their position, in thick weather, should, in approaching Portland entrance, keep in forty fathoms 01· more, with soft bottom." White Head Gi:ound, off Cape Elizabeth, coming within the limits of the work of this year, was partially developed by the soundings. Mr. Charles J unken served as hydrographic draughtsman in the party. Pliysical survey ef Boston liarbor.-The physical survey of Boston harbor has been continued under my direction b)' Assistant Henry Mitchell, who has been occasionally detailed for that work at the request of the United St.ates commission, consisting, at the opening of the year, of the late Major General Joseph G. Totten, Professor A. D. Bache, and Rear-Admiral C. H. Davis. Thi!' is not the place to enter upon the details of this special survey, the results of which .:i.re annually published by the city of Boston. It may suffice to say that the lessening depth in some parts of that noble harbor has long been a source of anxiety among commercial men, and a thorough examination into the causes of the shoaling has been urged. During the past season comparatively little field-work has been done in extending the survey, but the computations and tabular statements have been advanced, and a large amount of material prepared for publication. From the commencement of the physical survey we have been encouraged by success, which l1as been fully appreciated by the intelligent community interested in the results. The Coast Survey, as 1 have before had occasion to remark, gathers many advantages from such undertakings in the collection of useful data for wider application. The expenses of the special survey are borne by the city of Boston. In the "Seventh Report of the United States Commission on Boston Harbor," the following remark occurs in reference to the labors of Assistant Mitchell : "We must say in the beginning of this division, that we have thought it indispensable to place the whole of Mr. Mitchell's report, with its tables and illustrations, in the Appen<lix. It will be studied by tl1e engineers and surveyors who follow the course of our investigations, and who, without this study, would be

unable to satisfy themselves of the correctnesR of our conclusions. It will, moreover, he Rtudied as a model of investigation in this branch of engineering in tidal harbors." In tlrn course of the year, Messrs. C. P. Dillaway, A. l\l. \V etherill, and J. \V . .Brown have served efficiently in the party of Assistant l\iitchell as aids. A pn·liminary chart of Boston bay and its approaches accompanies this report as Skrtcl1 No. 9. Hydrograplu"r:i;xarmnation iu ~Yoe Beriford J1,arbor, 11iassadtusetts.-At tlie close oft11c last surveying year the party of Assistant Mitchell was still on duty afloat, with the schooner Dana. After closing work at Sippican, as before reported, l\Ir. Mitchell determined the position of a rock in New Bedford harbor. In reporting the results of his observations, he refers to other features in the hydrography of this harbor, which may become the subject of further examination. A cliart of Sippican h:ubor is appended, (Sketch No. 10.) .A 1d~ to na1,igation.--'1'0 obtain information needed by the Light-house Board, Assistant :.\Iitchell was directed in August to visit Eastport harbor, l\luscle Ridge channel, and Herring Gut harbor, on · tlie coast of ~Ininc, and to examine certain rocks reported by pilots an<1 others as being danger>" in navigatinn. Tl1e rf'Elllts of his examination, :md his recommendation for buoys to mark the dangers, are given in the Appendix, (Xr>. 23.) Tidal aud magnetic observations.-The continuous series of tidal rncords and monthly magnetic observations were kl~pt up at Eastport by Assistant Edward Goodfellow until the first of April, and by SubAssistant A. 'l'. Mostman until July, when the work at that station wns closed, and n similar series of observ~tions of both kinds commenced at Portland, und<"r the care of ]\fr. H. W. Richardson. The record of the tides, by mean:< of tl1e Relf-rt>gistering tide-gauge, is de~igiied J.iere, as in the other important harbors where it is kept U)J, to furnish the data for predictions of tl1e tides, besides connecting the temporary tid;1l observations at many stations along the coast, wl1icl1 aie made by the 11ydrographic parties. The mai;netic observations similarly serve to discover the secular changes in the variation, and to refer to a common period the determinations made at various times in other localities. SECTION II.
l'RO:M rOINT .JCDITII TO C'APE HENLOPEN, IN"CLCDING THE COAST OF THE STATES OF CONNECTICl'T, 1\'EW YORK, NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA, AND PART UF DELA\VAHE.-(SKETCH Ko. l.)

The work done in this section will be deRcribed in the usual 01·de1·. An abstract showing the number of partie~ and the operations in wliicb each was engaged will be found in Appendix No. 1. The 8everal descriptions of work will be noticed as heretofore under separate heads. Primary triangulatiou.-In a former Teport it was stat.eel that in extending tlie primary triangulation for connecting the Epping base, in Maine, with the }'ire Island base, (see Sketch Ko. 1, accompanying this report,) much difficulty had been encountered in obtaining satisfactory observations upon several of the lines across the State8 of :Massachusetts and Connecticut., some of the lineR being more t1ian si:xty miles in length. The difficulty alluded to was occasioned by unusual lateral refraction. The line from Bald Hill to Station Ivy, both in Comiecticut, is rather more than fifty-three miles long. It passes at about on1;-tl1ird of its length near the summit of a wooded hill, in crossing the township of Canton, Connecticut, and was frequently affected iu a most remarkable manner by lateral refraction. The station Bald Hill was occupied by my party in September, 1861. Nearly all the measurements of angles centering there liaving been made when the temperature of the air ranged from :fifty to eighty degTees 1'~ahrenheit, it was deemed expedient to make additional observations at a season of the year when the temperature should range between forty and sixty degrees. My party was accordingly organized at Washiugton early in May, and placed in charge of Assistant G. W. De.an, who proceeded to Station Bald Hill, and completed in a satisfactory manner a second series of measmements of such primary angles as were deemed necessary. After completing these observations the party was transferred to Station Wooster Mountain, in the township of Ridgefield, Fairfield county, Connecticut. The requisite arraugement8 for the erection of signals and postin;o; the hcliotropers were made by Assistant Dean and Sub-Assistant R. E. Halter, while the usual preparations for occniiying the stations were ma,de as in former years by Mr. Thomas McDonnell. The instruments at Station Wooster were in position, and every preparation had been made for commencing the geodetic operations on the 1st of J nly, but unfavorable weather prevented until the 14th, when the measurem~nts of angles with the thirty-inch theodolite were begun, and were co11tinued for two days. During

the following six weeks the atmosphere was remarkably dry and hazy, and for many consecutive dayt< the smoke arising from the accidental burning of' large tracts of forest timber in thi6 and the adjoining States of .Ma8sachusetts and Kew Yor.k, rendered it quite impos~ible to observe upon object6 at a grettter di8tance than four or five miles from the point occupied by the ob6erver. In many respects thi= weather throughout New England during the season just closed has been very similar to that of tl1e summet· of 1S54, which, no doubt, is still well rememberecl by rnoi-t of the present residents of this section of country, and more e~pecially l1y tho~e in the State of ]\Jaine, many of wl10111 Hldfored great losses from the destruction of thousands of acres of timber, numerous dwelling-houses, and other vahrnble property. ·'ital'ion Bald I!.ill.-The measurement~ of angle8 at t.hi~ ~tation were commenced on the 22(1 of May, and completed on the 7th of ,J nne. 'I'htc number of ob8ervations made with the thirty-inch theodolite hy Assistant Dean was two hundred and sixty-four. At Station 'Vooster Mountain the mea8nrements of angle8 were commenced on the 14th of .Tuly, ancl completed on the 10th of October. The number of signals observed upon was thirteC'n, five of which were primary and eight secondary, and for this purpose sixteen hundred and 8ix:ty observations were made. The elevations of ten stations above the sea level were dcte1·mined by the measurement of vertical angles with the eigl1t-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. Ko. 57, in which fourteen lrnnd1·ecl a11d sixteeu observatious were made. The most distant signal observecl upon during the season was at Statio11 Ivy, and visible from Bald Hill about fifty three and a half miles in a dirnct line. Three other eignals were between thirty-seven and fortytwo miles distant from station \Vooster. The relative positions of the several stations arp shown in Sketch No. 1. The arna within the limits of the triangulation completed during the season, estimated in the usual manner, is seven hundred and twenty square miles. Magnetic oburnatimi.~.-'l'hc geological formation of \\'ooster mountain appears tu be c11iefly gneiss rock, which, in tl1e immediate vicinity of its summit rir1ge, has lweu uplifted into nnmermrn c1ifi'5 varying from twenty-:five to :fifty foet in height. The strata of the rock at the sieveral out-croppingR inclinPs at various angles, aud in many different clirections, and although no trap rock was found iu thP immediate vicinity of the geodetic station, tbe results obtained in determining the magnetic dip at different point~ near the summit of the mountain indicate the ~Jresence of trap dikes in that vicinity. After making experimental obse1Tations at several points the magnetic station was finally located about eighty metres southwesterly from the geodetic station. The magnetic observations consisted of one hundred and forty-six readings of the suspended magnet on three days for ascertaining the cleclination; and the horizontal intensity and moment of inertia were determined from two complete sets of experiments on two days. '!'he magnetic dip was ascertained at three points from nine complete sets of observations with two needles. These observations were made by Sub-AssiRtant R. E. Halter, aided by Mr. F. "'\V. Perkins, who served in my party as geodetic recorder during the season. MetPorological obsernations.-Thc usual meteorological journals were kPpt by Mr. l'e1·kins, in which were recorded two bnndred and eighty-nine readings of the mercurial and aneroid barometer8, and of the wetbulb and dry-bulb thennometers, in connexion with the direction and force of the wind and chamcter of the clouds. All the original records were duplicated, and the requisite abstracts of angles and reductions wen' completed in the field. Twenty volumes of original and duplicate records were dl·posited in the archh·es at the close of the season. It is due to Assistant Dean to say, that, in conducting the details of operations by my party during the season jnst closed, his services, as in former years, have been rendered with fiddity and sncce~R. Triangulation ea..Yt ef Hud.Yon river, New Yrn-lc.-'I'he triangulation c.:unnecting tliat of the lluc11mn with the primary work passing through New England wa~ resumed on the 1st of Sl·ptcmber Ly A8sil'tant Edmund Blunt, and was pushed until the 1st of November. Sub-Assistants J. S. Sullivan and A. 'I'. Mosman were attached to the party, the latter joining on the 27tlt of September, after completing duty in Section I.

REPORT OJ<' THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Triangulation ef Barnegat bay, New Jersey.-The triangulation of the coast of New Jersey was resumed by Assistant John Farley, at :Manasquan inlet, in the middle of August. Having made the needful reconnaissance before the close of the preceding season, the work was continued soutJ1wai·d through Barnegat bay to a pflint about sixteen miles below Manasquan. ElevPn stations we1·e occupied, and thirteen points determined by eleven hundred an<l thirty-fonr angular measurements. The party of Mr. Farley continued in the fiehl until the end of November. Topography r!f' HurZ.,on river, 1Yew York.-The detailed plane-table survey of the shore8 of the Ilndson was resumed at the previous limit aoove Sing Sing, and on the eastern 8ide ha8 been extended to Croton village. The party of Assistant H. L. Whiting took the field for this dury on the 27th of August, and was aided by Mr. IL G. Ogden. Sellers' Point and the shores of Croton river were surveyed as far up as the crossing of the Albany turnpike. On tl1e 6th of October the topography of the west 8ide of the Hudson was taken np at Nyack, and continued upward~ to include the village of Haverstraw. A breadth of about half a mile was given to. the detailed ~nrv<'y. On this sheet the sbore-linc of Rockland lake was traced, and some i·emarkable features of topography, in reference to which l\1r. Vl'hiting observes: "The circular crest of hills from the 'Verdiretige Hook' to ·High Tor' (seven hundred and tl1irty and eight hundred and twenty feet respectively) rises abruptly from the river slime at an angle impossible to ascend, with perpendicular cliffs at the summit crest. This narrow 1·idge of the entire line of summits, with the steep slope of descent westward, of from four hundred to six hundred feet, to the undulating fields at the base, forms one of the most striking natural features in the whole of the river topography. As a subject for contour, it is the most remarkable that has come within my experience in Coa~t Survey work." Suh-Assistant Cleveland Rockwell joined tbe party on tbe 8th of October. His energy in meeting the diflieultie8 peculiar to the work of the season are warmly commended in the report of Assistant \Vhiting.

Mr. Rockwell had previously been on duty in Section III and Section VIII. and Mr. Ogden in Section IV. 'Topography qf 1\"avesink Highlands, New Jersey.-'I'he supplementary plane-table work needed in the vicinity of Navesink was taken up by Assistant C. M. Bache on the 11th of September, with a party, in the schooner Dana. Good progress was made in the survey until the 22d of the month, but the difficulty then existing in regard to the fluctuating increase of wages made' it impracticable to retain the hands at the limit aJlowed l1y the regulations. A new crew was, therefore, employed for the special purpose of taking the vessel back to Peekskill, where she was laid up for the winter. Sub-AesiBtant T. U. Bowie was attached to this topographical party. Assistant Bache had been previously employed in Section III, and Mr. Bowie in Section VIII. Topograplty ef Absecom inlet, New Jersey.- 'I'he plane-table survey of Absecom inlet was commenced on the 1st of November, 1863, by Mr. H. W. Bache. Work was clos!·d on the 15th of January, by reason of the severity of the weather, and was again resumed on the 1st of July. The survey (Sketch No. 16) includes Atlantic City and Brigantine beach on the opposite side of the inlet, and the water thoroughfares inland for about two miles. Very considerable changes were noticed on comparing the shore-line with that traced in 1844. Mr. H. G. Ogden aided in the £elcl-work. The survey was eompleted on the 19th of August. Trial Course buoys.-.At tbe request of the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, .Admiral C.H. Davis, two buoys were set in Raritan bay, between Sandy Hook, East Beacon, and Prince's Bay light, to mark the trial cour.-e for vessels of the navy. '!'his service was performed by Mr . .Alex. Strausz in June. 'l'he buoyt1 were placed two nautical miles asunder, and show about twenty feet out of water. The depth at the ea1:1t buoy is twenty-six feet, and at the west 'buoy twenty-seven feet at mean low tide. The previous occupation of Mr. Strausz will be mentioned under the head of Section IV. 8a7!dy llook.-In March last a special commission, appointed by the War Department, visited Sandy

Hook, examined the changes which had taken place in the shore-line, and made comparison of the numerous surveys. 'l'he commissioners were accompanied by Assistant Henry :Mitcltell, who maf1e the la8t hydrographic survey 'Jf the vicinity, and had gainml special information in hit< former employment, und<'r my direction, while the survey of New York bay was in progress. The hydrograpliic cha11ges in the neighborhood nf Samly Honk are very slight, but the extension of the extreme point of the land, and the wear on either shore, were. more rapid in the year 1862 than at any previous time. In the year 1863 the extension continued, but the wear was not so great as in the previous year. Hydrograpliy ef Absecom inlet, J\"ew Jcrsey.-The approaches, inlet, and ha1·bor at Abt<ccom, New Jersey, were sounded out in June last by the party of Lieutenant Commander T. S. Phelps, with the steamer Corwin. The following are statistics of the work : .Miles run in sounding . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . 92 Angles measured . . . . . . · . . . · . . · . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . · . . . . . · . . . . . . . 645 Number of soundings. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6, 426 A tidal 8tatiou wa8 occupied for the adjustment of soundings on the chart.

Special e:.rnmination on Delaware ri1:er.-At the request of the :Savy Department Assistant Mitchell was sent in January last to observe the action of floating ice in the neighborhood proposed as navy yard sites in Delaware river. 'l'he severity of the season afforded an opportuuity of noting the worst features of such action. Every fact which seemed to bear upon the question was collected with diligence, and reported to the department. :M:r. J. ·w. Brown and Mr. A. l\f. Wetherill aided in this service. Tidal obsen·ations.-The permanent ,;elf-regiatering tide-gauge at Governor'<' island, New York harbor, has been kept in operation by Mr. R. 'l'. Bassett, who lias also continued to make observations on a box gauge for comparison at the dock of the Hamilton Avenue ferry, in Brooklyn. SECTION III.
FROM CAPE HENLOPEN TO CAPE HENRY, INCLUDING THE COAST OF PART OF DELA\VARE, THE COAST OJ<' MARYLAND, AND PA.HT OF THE COAST OF VIRGINIA..

All the field-work in this section has been done, as in the preceding years of the war, with immediate reference to military or naval operations, or iu connexion with purposes of defence. A great amount of geographical data has thus been collected fr"m loc1tlitics intended to be embraced in the regular operations of the survey. The work done will be dcscr;bcd under the us1rnl heads. ~.\. synopsis showing the locality in which each of the parties has been employed will be found in Appendix No. 1. Latitude and lOT1.gitude ef points in We.~t Virginia.-To meet an application made at the approach of last winter by the chief engineer of the military depai·tment of 'Vest Yirginia, the late Lieutenant J. R. Meigs, United States corps of engineers, the telegraphic method of determining longitude was applied by Assistant G. W. Dean, in connexion with the ordinary method of observing for the latitude at eleven stations in the department. Mr. Dean made his party aITangements at Ulai·ksburg early in December, and then took charge of the operations requisite at W a;iLington city, the purpose being to use the military telegraph lines, and to refer all the determinations to the station in that city. Sub-AssiRtaut A. T. Mosmau and Mr S. H. Lyman were detailed with a sidereal chronometer and the eight-inch Gambey vertical circle No. 57 to observe at tl1e western stations. Observations were begun on the 23d of December, and closed on the 24th of :llfarC'h. In determining longitude, Assistant Dean used at V\7 ashington a meau time chronometer, of which the corrections and rate wern obtained by comparison with the time of the Naval Ob;iervatory, by the kind permission of its superintendent, Captain Gillis, United States navy. On nights favorable for observing, if the line was at the same time available, the mean time chronometer was t.aken to the 'Var Department, and signals were exchanged with the observer in West Virginia, the time of each being noted on the chronometers at both ends of the line. M1·. Dean was aided in these opPrations by Mr. P. H. Donegan. Seven signals thus made during a single minute at Washington were considered a series of compai·ison~. S:gnals were then made from the western station, and again from Washington, alternating until eight or ten series were successfully exchanged on the same night by the "eye and ear method." From subsequent comparieon of

22

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OB'

the time~ noterl hy the two chronometers, the longitude was deduced of the stations at 1\fartinsbnrg, Clarksburg, Cnmberlnml, Grafton, Cam1:ron, Wheeling, Parkersburg, Point Pleasant, South Point, (Ohio,) G:rnley Briilge, and Charleston. The exchange of time signals by telegraph was hindered at seveml of the stations, arnl prevented e1,tirely at Charleston l1y the movement,; of guerilla parties. Mr. Mosman determined the local time at the western stations by two hun<lre(T :m<l eighty obsmTations on twe11ty standard stars. At a11 the statio11s already named the latitude wa~ determined from one hundred and twenty-five observations on eleven stars. 'l'hcse determinations of geographical position, although not possessing the accuracy of tho"' mad!' i11 conuexion with the geodetic operations of the Coast Survey, supply a far closer approximation to tl1e true rp]ative positionR of the s:ation~ than was pre\'iously known, and greatly assi>ited in the adjustment of the old county maps and recent military surveys, so as to form an improved map of the dPpartment. Lil·tltemmt l\Ieigs furnii;hed transportntion for the party and instruments. The opemtions were facilitated also by the obligi11g comteSJ of ll!aj·Jr Eckert, superintendent of the military telegrnph lines at vYashiugton. The records of these observations ha\'C been received at the office in duplicate as usual, and the reductions for latitude and longitwle havH been completed, and applied in eoJ"recting the map of the military department. A:;sistam Dean <luring the snmrner anil autumn was on duty with my ffold party in Section II. On closing the work in Yirginia, Sub-Assistimt llfo1>man was assigned to rluty in Section l. }llaguetic OVSl'rl'rltions.- vVhile he was engaged with :the party i11 the determination of geograpl1ical positions in \Vest Virginia, J\Ir. Lyma11 observed the approximate declination of the magnetic needle at the pri11ci11al stations, using the declinometer D. 22. The instrument was generally adjusted in the open air, and tbc direction of the suspended magnet was noted at intervals of a few minutes during an hour or morn . .From the unurnal severity of the winter, and the ex1JOsure to which the party was necessarily subjected in pasl"ing from station to station, and in night observations, the heitlth of l'tlr. Lymau became so seriously impain'il a8 to inducP his resignation. Topngrapliy qf tlie enriron.v rif Balti1!'ore, Maryland.-Thc plane-table smvey of the ground commanded l1y the defences erected last year in the vicinity of Baltimore was co11tinued during the winter by two parties. Sub-AssiBtant C. T. Iar<lella succeeded Sub-Assistant Donn in November, and Assistant C. l\L Bache was assigued early in .Ianuary. Both pa1·tiet1 have continued the detailed survey under the direction of Colonel \Y. F. ltaynold~ ancl other officers who successively filled the position of chief engineer of the midclle department. }fr. Iardella executed the topogmphy eastward of J ones's falls from the city to Cross Keys village, and thence in a circuit towarcls the Baltimore and Philadelphia railroad. The circuit westward of J ones's falls was surveyed by Assistant Bache as far as the Franklin turnpike, where he joined with the plane-table work done la.st year by Sub-Assistant Donn in the western approach to the city. Sub-Assistant lardella is still engaged in the fiel.J.. During part of the season he was aided by Mr. H. \V. Bache. Tl1c occupation of Mr. Donn in the present senson will be stated elsewhere in this section, and nuder the head of Section YIU. Assistant Bache continued the survey near Baltimore until September, and w11~ then assigned to duty in Section IL In the early part of the season he was aided by Mr. Charles S. Hein.

Topography near TVasltington, D. G.-Sub-Assistant Charles Ferguson was employed between the 10th of December, 1863, and the 20th of l\Iarch following, in extending tl1e topographical survey along the northeast line of the District of ClJlumhia. This work was done at the request of the engineer of defences. It adds a breadth of about three mileH ti) the District map along that boundary.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

ef West Virginia.-At the request of the chief engineer of the military department of Virginia, the late Lieutenant Meigs, I detuilecl Jl.lr. A. Lindenkohl from the office early in October, 1863, to assist in compiling the data which hart been collected at Clarksburg, from the army surveys and by expeditions of the cavalry force". Other material procured from the records of surveys at Annapolis and Baltimore, and from the Engineer Bureau, was made auxiliary to the preparation of a military mnp of the department. 1\h. LinrlPnhkohl a;i;iisted al~o in the cou~trnrtion of a large map of the environs of Cumberland, and computed the latit.ncle of a number of pl:ices in the State from sextant observations by Lieutenant Meigs. He was employed in "\Yest Virginia until the 16th of E'ebrnary, aud then returueJ to duty in the Drawing Divbion of the office. Hydrograpliic survey ef Trent's Rmcli (James river, Virginia.)-This was the first service rendered by Sub-Assistant J. S. Bradford after joining the staff·of Admiral Lee, in June. 'l'he soundings, about two thousand in number, were completed on the 14th of the month, and embraced the bar and the entire expani;1ion of the river on the south side of Farrar island. The battery at Howlett's being evacuated by the enemy on the morning of tlie 14th, .l\l r. Bradford took advantage of their abecncc and sounded the upper part of the reach as far as the upper wharf, from which he had been several times fired upon previously. This service proved to be timely, as the rebel forces reoccupied the battery in t11e eveni11g, a few hours after l\lr. Bradford hnd examined the ground, with the intention of making a close survey of the site. Soon after, the use of obstructions in Ti·ent's reach having been decided upon, Mr. Bradford was called on to determine the line which they were to occupy. When the work thus marked out was completed the entire line was designated on his cha1·t, ::ind copies of the sheet were furnished for tl1e use of tlie squadron. The party was repentedly fired on from the battery at Howlett's while engaged in locating the line. Suh-Assistant Bradford remttincd on duty with the fla.g-ship in James ri;·cr until the third of July. The remainder of the month, excepting a few days, was passed at Hampton Roads in preparing charts for the use of the blockading fleet off "\Vilmington, and for the Navy Department. During this time l\fr. Bradford visited Trent's reach twice under the orders of the admiral, on duty connected with the line of obstructions. His subsequent service with the Korth Atlantic blockading squanron will be stated u~ider the head of Section IV. Tidal obscn·ations.-Thc tidal obscTvations at Old ]>oint Comfort, Virginia, Wt're continued in cl1arge of l\Ir. l\L C. King until March lRt, when lie rPsignerl. Tlw 8tat.ion w:u1 tlwn iutrnst.ed to Ordnance Sergeant C. Kelly., United States army, who has continued the obBervations to this time successfully.
SECTION IV.
FROM CAPE HENRY TO CAPE FEAR, INCIX'DIKG THE COAST OF PART OF VIRGINIA AND OF PART 01'' NORTH CAROLINA.

'l'he operations to be described under this head were carried on by parties assigned to work under the orders of Admiral S. l'. Lee when in command of the North Atlantic blockading squadron. One of the parties remained during the entire year on duty with the squadron, and is now engaged under the orders of Admiral Porter. An abstract of the parties and operations is given in Appendix No. 1. It will be seen that the results obtai11ed fall in with the regular working of the survey. Survey ef Roanoke ri·ver, North Carolina.-This survey, as well as others to be noticed presently, was made at the special request of the flag officer of the North Atlantic blockading squadron, Admiral S. P. Lee. It includes the river and its shores to Ryan's 'l'horoughfare, above Plymouth, North Carolina, and below to its mouth in Albemarle sound. Sub-Assistant R. E. Halter reported on the flag-ship at Hampton Ronds on the 12th of November, 1863. Under directions then received he applied to the senior naval officer at Newbern, and was assigned to quarters on the gunboat Seymour. On tlie 23cl a base liue was measured above Plymouth, and triangulation made in connexion with it. The work was then pushed 011, subjPct only to interruptions causen by frequent attacks from small parties of the rebel forces. M.r. Halter completed the triangulation and the topography by the end of January. 'l'he Roanoke river below Ryan's Thoroughfare was eounded by Sub-Assi<ltant J. S. Bradford and his aids, 1\leesrs. H. M. De "\Vees and H. L. li1ariudin. Batchelor's bay was included, and the water p!l.llsages known as Middle and Eastmost rivers. This work was done with a boat from the steamer Seymour, and under many disadvantages, tl1e vessel being often needed for picket duty and for delivering despatches. Mr. Bradford completed soundings in this vicinity on the 10th of February. 'l'he statistics are thus stated in his report:

While engaged in the vicinity this season Sub-Assistant Halter found means to complete the topography of the south end of the island. 'I'he work is in detail, and, like all the field-work of the present sea~on in this section, is conform<tble in character to the regular operations of the survey of the coast. Sur1Jey ef Oroatan sound, Nortli Carolina.-Sub-Assistant Halter took up this work on the 20th of February, but its progress was much hindered by bad weather. Field-work, includiug the triangulation and Rlrnre-line survey, was fiually dosec1 on the 26th of May. In the interval, tllf' steamer Seymour waH frpq1wntly on navnl duty, and part of the time was employed to watch the rel1d movementH in Roanoke river. On ~uch occasions Sub-Assi,;tant Halt.Pr continued on i.ervice with the VPssel. While in tlw vicinity Mr. Halter took the opportunity to visit the site of the primary base lirn~ on Rodie's island. 'l'l1e marks at the ends of the line were found readily, as were also several of the adjacent stations used in the main triangulation of the coast of North Carolina.

By direction of the flag-officer the ob11tmctions placed by tllf' enemy iu Oroatan sound at the outset of the war were examined in February by Sub-Assistant l3raJfonl. At several intervals, permitted liy the exigencies of the naval service in the 8ncceeding mont11~ cloRing with May, the l1ydrography of the sound was developed and its channel marked by buoys from Roanoke m:u-8hes to Croatan light, the soundings being ex.tended as far up as Pork Point. This was a work of much nece~~ity, vessels of the squadron having frequently grounded in going through the sound. Both lines of obstruetions put down by the enemy have been carefully marked on the chart. 'The statistics of the work are as follows: Miles run in ,;ounding............ . . . . . . . . · · · · . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . 208 Angles .....·..·....·.·..........·.··.·..........· , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1, 486 Number of soundings............. · · . · . · . . . . · · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . 23, G64 The difficulties that multiplied in the way by the frequent withdrawal of the steamer for aaval service were in part relieved by the interest taken iu the work by }fr. Newton Eggle.ston, acting second assistant engineer of the Seymour, and by Mr. George Doten, purser's steward. Both served as recorders in the hydrographic party whenever their regular duties would permit. After leaving this section, Sub-Assistant Bradford continued on active duty in Section III on the flagsbip of Admiral Lee, but returned in September with a vessel specially assigned for use in }lrosecuting hydrography. His subsequent work will be mentioned presently~. The vessels detailed to attack the rebd ram Albemarle were piloted thrnugh Croatan sound by the hydrographic party in the Seymour. Triangulation ef Nt:uae river, ]forth Carolina.-A party organized under the charge of Assistant G. A. Fairfield for continuing the preliminary survey of the Neuse river was at New Bern on the 4th of December last, fully prepared for resuming work. At that time a large band of guerillas was making incm~ions along the lower part of the river, renderiug it unsafe to use the schooner James Hall, which was to serve for transportation. The convoy of a gunboat was promptly tendered by the senior naval officer, Commander Davenport, but the early opening of the military campaign by the rebel forces in the vicinity of New Bern made it frequently necessary to withdraw the protecting vessel for naval service. After repeated attempts the work was resumed on the 25th of February, when hostile movements iu the waters of North Carolina called for full activity in the naval squadron and for vigilance in those having the care of transport and 4 c s

other ves8els. 1~ ndPr tbese circumstanccR AssiRtant Fairfield worked several days at a new station in the 1riangulation of the Neuse river, and then a~sistec1 with his vessel in meeting a call made by AdmiraI·Lee for a rcsurv0y of Hatteras inlet. He was aided in this section by Mr. Horace Anderson. 'l'hc party and vessel were emp1oyPd during the summer in Section I. rl.1Jdrograpl111 ef }l.'puse rircr. 1Vortll Carolina.-This work was commenced on the 1st of January by the party of Acting ,\s8btant AlPxmuler Strausz, and armngemrmts were made at the Rame time for running tlie sl1ore line of the river below New Bern. Good rirugre~s Juring the montl1 liad extended the soundings as far down as the lower blockade. l'\ew Bern was attacked by the enemy on the 1st of Fe1ruary. The work was at once discontinued. ::\Ir. Strnusz, with his aids, l\Iessrs. H. G. Ogden and Gershom Bra<lford, tendered tl1emselves for naval duty on board of tlie gunboat Commodore Hull, as aids to perform watch duty, and tl1e offer was accepted. :Mr. Strausz, knowing the channel, set three buoys for leauiug up or down the river, an<l piloteu one of the army transports by tlie nearest route of communication between Fort Anderson and Fort Clrnse. At tl1e request of Genernl Peck he also made a reconnaissance of Batchelor's creek with armed boats <ldail~d for tbat service by Commander Davenport. Defensive operations in the vicinity of Kew Bern occupied the party until the 1st of :March. Resurn·y rif Ilattcras inlet, Nortli Carolina.-This work was done at the request of Admiral Lee. No other vessel being then available, 1\fr. Strausz used the surveying schooner James Hall, belonging to the 1iarty of A~"i8tant Fairfield. The month of l\Iarch was occupied in running soundings to determine the l1ydrogrn1il1ic clianges and in tracing tl1e shore-lines of the inlet. Buoys were then set to mark the new channel-three in the swash and a fin;t-claEs can-buoy in Pamplico Rmmd. The swash buoys being carried away Ly hea\-y gale~ in April, were replaced after a careful re-examination of the channel. Of the clrnuges observed at Hatteras .l\lr. 8trausz remarks: "The channel now used over the swash is entirely differc11t from that shown on the chart of 1861. The new one has opened since December, 1863. The depth of water over the new swash at mean low tide is a little over seven feet-the mean rise and fall beiug one foot aud two-tentlu;."

1\Ir. Strausz remained in service in the waters of North Carolina until the end of May, and was subsequently em11Ioyed in Sections I and II. Mr. Ogden, of his party, has since been on duty in Section II, and }lr. Bradford in Section V. Hatteras inlet was 1·e-examined in the latter part of September by Acting Assistant Edward Cordell. 'l'be cbauges then observed required a removal of the buoys. The channel to the westward of the Middle Grouud was fouu<l to be filled up, and tlie west breakera extended across it nearly to the buoy which marks die em;tcrn extremity of the Middle Ground. The main channel had deepened to eighteen feet at low water, (spring tide,) with line;; of continuous breakers on either side of it. '.rhe changes reported by Mr. Cordell were illustrated by a sketch of soundings. 'l'hese appear in the new edition of the preliminary chart of Hatteras inlet which was issued from the office in Qctober. Resurvey ef Beaefort Harbor entrance, North Carolina.-For this service Acting Assistant Edward Cordell reported to Admiral Lee at Fortress Monroe on the 25th of March, and was as;;igneu to duty unde1· the immediate orders of Captain Dove at Beaufort, North Carolina, on the 30th. A small vessel belonging to the blockading squadron being assigned for the use of the hydrographic party, Mr. Cordell at once commenced a resurvey of the bar and of the channel leading into the harbor. "The principal changes in the channel occur at black buoy No. 3. In 1862 it was placed in twenty feet of water to mark the point of the southwest breakers. Since then the breakers have extended westward about a hundred yards beyond the first position of the buoy, and but eight feet of water was found at its position. It was 1·emoved into sixteen feet water." Other changes of depth arc stated in Mr. Cordell's report. (Appendix No. 6.) Messrs. A. M. 1Vetheril1, Jas. W. Brown, and Franklin Platt aided in this resurvey. The work was completed on the 2d of May, and a new edition of the chart furnished from the office, with revised sailing directions for t11e use of the blockading squadron. The statistics of the resurvey at Beaufort entrance are as follows:

The buoys were re-set so as to mark the line of best water as developed by tlie rcsurv<'y. In the latter part of December the channel into Beaufort had been examined by Acting A~~istant Alexander Strausz. A report on its course, direction, and depth of water was, at the same time, forwarded to the flag-officer, with tracings from the chart then made. Hydrograp}1.y qf Core sound, },"ortlt Carolina.-In connexion with the work mentioned under the last head, Mr. Cordell during the summer eounded out the channel which kads from JJoguf' sound through the straits into Core sound, and extended the inside hydrogrnplty as far as Hiubor i~land, including alrn the waters of Beaufort harbor, North Carolina. 'l'his survey shows that the channel of Core sonnd gives only fiye feet at the shoal places. The channel was marked by the party with three iron can buoys and one hnndrcd and thirty-five stakes. The particulars developed by the soundings are stated in the Appenclix, (~o. 7.) J\Iessrs. Wetherill and l'latt served in the party as aids. In addition to hydrogrnphic service, l\Ir. Cordell, throughout the entire season, performed the duties of acting light-house inspector, and reported regularly to the chairman of the board. 'l'he results of the work in Core sound, which was complet.ed by the 9th of Septembt~r. are shown on Sketch No. 24. IIydrograpl11c reconnaissance ef the Cape Lool.:out shoals, .\"ortl1. Carolina.-The Cape Lookout shoal~ were examined in August last by Lieutenant Commander T. S. }>helps, United States navy, Assi5tant Coast Survey. Sketch No. 25 shows the results of this reconnaissance. 'I'hrec shoals, probably parts of tl1e same ridge. were found, one extending S. by E. i E. from the south point of the constant breaker, three miles to seaward, or ten and a half miles from the light-house. The bottom here is quite uneven, the depth on the shoal lumps varying from about nine feet to eighteen feet. About a mile and a half to the southwarJ and eastward the soundings gave five and a half fathoms, and further still in the same direction, or SE. by S. ~ S., thirteen and a half miles from the light-house, five and a quarter fathome were found. The examination developed no indication of shoal ground at present outside of the last-named limit. The report made by Lieutenant Commander Phelps is given in the Appendix, (No. 5.)

Ilydrograplty ef Bogue sou7td, Jt."orth Caro/eina.-This work was commenced in August., under the orders of Admiral Lee, by Sub-Assistant Bradford, who had served on hi~ i;taff duriug the summer. The ;;teamer Nansemond, then awaiting the completion of a new boiler, was assigned for temporary service in the hydrography, but her draught made it impracticable to take that vessel higher up than Carolina city. Good progress was made, however, with the prospect of early completion, but not before the steamer was called to Baltimore to receive the boiler. By direction of the Admiral, Mr. Bradford went in the vel!sel to expedite the repairs of the steamer Seymour, which had been in general use for hydrographic purposes iu this section. l\Ir. H. :\L De \Vees joined the party as aid at Hampton Roads, and accompanied }fr. Bradford to Beaufort, North Carolina, where he arrived on the 27th of September. The succeeding fortnight was employed in preparing charts for the use of the naval forces in the projected attack on Wilmington. In addition to the Coast Survey data these contain all the information gained by reconnaissance in reference to the number and strength of the enemy's works, and views of the coast, and of the defences taken from different points of obscrvittion. The new charts were delivered to Admiral Lee just previous to the transfer of the command of the North Atlantic squadron to Admiral Porter. At the request of the last-named officer Sub-Assistant Bradford joined his flag-ship, and is now on duty with the squadron.

The parties on the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, wl1ile prosecuting the regular work of the f'Urvey, wl1en practicable, also rendered incidental service in piloting vessels of the South Atlantic blockading squadron. Bet<ides the surveys made at tl1e request of Admiral Dahlgren, the parties were kept in reailine~s for rccm1nais~ancc;; in co-operation with the forces of Major General Foster. A summary given in Appendix No. 1 ehows the number of parties and the localities of work. In this chapter the operations will be, as usual, reforrPd to under separate heads. Rrw11n·r·11 r!f' Charlrs/()n bar, 8011111. Carnlina.-Assistant W. S. Edwards reached Port Royal with the scliooner ~· on thP 7th of Octol>cr, 1863, and, under the orders of Admiral Dal1lgren, a few days aft(!r comrncucc<l the r('survey of the bar at Cbadeston entrance. His soundings were made chiefly in what is known aB the "Pumpkin Hill channel." 'I'be results gave a depth of twelve and a half feet at mean low water, the course in heing due west, (magnetic.) Buoys were set at once by the light-house inspC'etor confornrnble tu the sotmuing~. Mr. Edwards replaced the outer swash channel buoy to guide thP- hluekading vessels, and also determined the positions of some of the buoys and obst.ructions in Charleston inner liarbor. His party was employed until the 1st of February, when Assistant C. 0. Boutelle took charge of the work, Assi>tant Edwards being then under orders for service on the western coast. He was aided at Charleston bar by .Messr~. }'. H. Dietz and L. A. Sengteller. The at'cpmintance of Mr. Eilwan]B with localities in the vicinity of Charleston was made available in Ycrifying accounts brought by deserters from the rebel lines.

Sub-Assistant "\Vebber continued in service at Port Royal until June, and then took up duty in Section I. Mr. J. A. Guldin aided him in duty on the coast of South Carolina. St·ri·icc at Port Ro.1Jal, SoutJ, Carolina.-Assistant Boutelle placed the buoys 1wPded in Port Royal harbo1., and persoually supervised the raising of the back beacon on Hilton Head. The cuttin~ needed for bri11giug the beacons into view was ma··ked out by his party. On the 19th of Aiarch the £teamer Yixen went up Beaufort river, and, tnking the inland passage, conducted the gunboat Hale through into St. Helena sound. In llny the party set two first-class buoys on the bar at Port Royal to replace those wliich had been carried away by Rtorms. Mr. Boutelle subsequently accompanied tl1e uaval expedition up the Soutli E<liRt.o rinr, the design of which was to co-operate with a movement of the land forces.

The work of the season in this section was coufiued to the upper part of the eastern coast of Flmida, and principally to the St. John's river. As in many other instanceE, the topogrnpl1y and l1ydrogra11hy executed, thougl1 availinf.!,' as work done in the regular progress of the s1uvey, wa8 of l'pecial interest at a juncturP in military and naval operations. Appendix No. 1 coutains a summa1y of the work, which will be now referred to in more detail. Topography near Jaelsonr·ille, Florida.-Sub A8si8tant Dennis n·ported to Brigadier General Seymour, at ,JacJi,sonville, early in March, and on the invit.ation of that officer joined his staff and went with tl1e expedition to Pilatka. '!'here he surveyed all the ground held by the government forces, and assisted in layiug out the line of defences. 'l'he aid of the party, Mr. S. P. Holt, in the schooner Caswell, had been meanwhile 0 employed in extending the survey about Jackso11villc. Mr. Dennis rejoined the party on the 23d of l\Iarch, and continued plane-table work until the 23d of ].foy, when the area deemed important for defensive purpoees had been mapped. In connexion with this duty he made, at the request of General Binwy, a reconuaiesance of the roads leading from Jacksonville to St. Augustine, to Picolata, and to Mayport l\Iills. After being relieved from service in the St. J olm's river, the Caswell returned to Port Hoyal. as already stated. Assistant Boutelle was farnished by this party with the results of a shore-line smvey of the mouth of the St. J ohu's river.

party to New York on the 30th of June, and then took up plane-table duty in Section I, as mentioned under tltat hPad. His ser\'ices in Florida liuve been fully acknowledged in a communication from General Seymour. JI.fr. Dennis, while mapping ground beyond the picket-lines at Pilatka, twice barely escaped capture. His ves8el, the schooner Cnswell, wns in tow bdtincl the United States steamer Hnrriet A. \Yeed, when that vessel was totally destroye<l by the explmion of a rebel torpedo ou the 9th of May, in St. John's river. Scn·ice witft tltc direct tax commission in Florida.-The request made at the close of last season by the cliairman, that the serYices of a topogrnpher should be continued during the stay of the commissioners in Floricla, was met by the a8sigumcmt of J\lr. R. E. J\Ic:lfath in Mnrch. l:nder instructions given by the chairman at }<'errnmdina, J\Ir. l\Icl\lath proceeded to St. Augustine, aud there constructed a map of Nnssau county, s110wing tlw laud sections, their numbers, rnbdiYisions, contents, and other particulars, as developed hy the towmhip p 1 at~ of the rllited State8 laud surveys. Ile also made a tracing from tlie map of Duval county, containing roads and other fratnre8 ndditional to those in existence when the map was constructed. 'l'hrough Sub-Assistant Dennis tliis tracing was transmitted to Brigadier Gcnernl GDl'don, that officer being then in command of the military forces at Jacksonville. Before Tdurning from this section, ~lr. J\1cMath compiled and sent to the office a sheet showing on a reclucecl scale the fonr counties adjacent tn tl1e lnwer part of the St. .Tohn'1< rivnr. This witl1 other material was used for the issue of nn improved map of the northern part of F'lorida, from the office iu .J uue. The occupation of J\lr. l\le}lath during 8ummer and autumn has been referred to under the heads of Section I and Sect ion II I. H.7Jdrography qf tl1e St. Jolm's river, Florida.-The sui·veying steamer Vixen, with the party of Assistant Boutelle, accompanied the naval and military expedition tliat went up the St. John's river in }'ebruary. Acting )1a8ter Platt buoyed out a new cluumel for entering, which had opened to the pouthward of the old channel. 1\Ir. Boutelle had previously marked tl1e bar. He subsequently adjusted signal fanterns, rn that ve~sels might cro~s nt the night tides. )fr. Platt took in the 8teamer J\fahaska, and was followed hy ]\fr. Harding with the Dai Ching. The party then went to the assistance of the Ben Deford, army steamer, that vessel having grounded, nnd piloted her into the channel. Ou the way up to Jacksonville the cliannel was mnrked l1y the pn.rty in tl1e Yixen, nnd signals were at the same time erected for a new hydrographic survey, to extend, if practicable, from the rmr to a point five mile~ above the town. 'l'l1is rc!'urvey was specially requested by Admiral Dahlgren, a8, owing to natuml changes, vessels belonging to the naval and transport service had much difficulty in getting up to Jacksonville after cro8sing the bar. ~While sounding, Assistant Boutelle went to the assistance of the Pawnee, and the service of his party in getting her afloat wns duly acknowledged by Captain Balch. The hydrography was pushed at intervals under many disadvantages, and wa.s finally concluded in 1\lay at 1\layport .l\lills. :\Ir. Boutelle gave personal attention to the placing of beacon-lights at the mouth of the St John's river, ancl for that and other ~ervice was in communication with the officers of the Light-house Board. )lessrs. 'IV. 1Y. Barcling, A. R. }'anutluroy, L. L. Nicholson, nnd C. I'. Dillaway served as aids in the hydrographic party. The Vixen waR brought down the St . .John's river soon after the disaster wltich met the army boat H_ A. 1Veed. Acting ]\Jaster Platt, of the party of Assistant Boutelle, noticing slight ripples 011 the water, and 8UP!·o~ing them to be caused by torpedoes, was ~ent to examine the place. He succeeded in bringiug up one of six, and it was clcliverecl to Admiral Dalilgren. The pooitions of the others we1·e pointed out to the picketboats, nncl notified aleo to Captain Balch, of the l'awn1.:e. Magnfli(: obsarations at K{ey JVest.-These liave been continued throughout the year in charge of Mr. Siunuel 1Valkcr. 'l'he original photographic traces of the three instruments and their hourly measures are preserved in the arcl1ives for future discussion. 'l'he i:;crics of ohservat.ions now extends over a period of four years and a half. It is designe~ to include, in all, one-half of the eleven-year period in the secular variation.

After a toilsome journey by way of the Cumberland Gap, the party !'Cached Knoxville with their in~tru ments un tlH· 11th of DeeembPr. "X<:'xt day, uruler t.l1e irmrwiliate on1Prs of Captain 0. ;.r. Poe, then chief fmgineer in the department of tlte Ohio, a plane-table survey was b0gnn of all the grounds of approach towards Knoxville. A base line of about fifteen hundred meb'es was measm·ed, and signals were <'et up anll determined in position by means of the plane table. The area to be included lay on 1-0th sidee of the Holston river. ~t:r. Uockwell took the north !'icle, and his survey was made to incluclc the city of Knoxville and the heavy fortifications, with the contour of the ground which they commanded. ~Ir. Tale.ott surv<'yed the southern approaches, which are more hilly, and quite thickly wooded. One peculiarity of the n·g-ion nuder notice is the numerous "sink holes" through which the smaller streams disappear suddenl,y, to ti.Jc surp1·ise of the topographer. The map of the survey around KnoxvillP comprises about thirteen square miles. The part a~signed to Mr. 'l'alcott being complete in the mid<lle of February, he was detached by General Foste1·, and after turning in his plane-table sheet at tlie office he retired from the service, with the cordial e~tecm that hall liec11 wo1~ by 11i~ abilitieR and genial di~pnsition. Suu-AssiBtant Rockwell rPmained i11 the ll<'partment of the Ohio u11til relieved from duty by )fajor Ge11cral Schofield on the 2d of ,June. Several copies of the map of the vicinity of Knoxville w!'re made by )fr. Rockwell, and furnished to commanders of different branches of the military service at that post.

Dorm, under the- orders of Major General Smith, examined the various branches that fall into the Cumberland river from the rnuth between Nashville and the South l<'ork. This was for the purpose of finding a nearer mute than the oue which had been used for supplying the army at Knoxville. A <letailed l'(·port of the reconnai:<Rmwe waH addressed to General Smith. At his return Sub-Assistant Donn took up the survey on the uortb side of Nashville, :Mr. Dorr at the same time being <'ngaged in mapping the southern approaches and the envirous of the chy, which sen·icc he commenced on the 3d of February. He was joined by }lr. Donn on the 22d, and working jointly the ;;ur.,·ey was conclutled by the 18th of 1Iareh. Sub.Assistant Dorr was during the summer engaged in topograpliical duty in Section I, and 1[r.

About twenty-seven miles of the course of the Tennessee river are included on the two sheets. 'l'he survey was commenced in the latter part of October, and was completed in the middle of January. All the ground passed over by the two topographers is marked by contour lines on the map, indicating successive efovations of twenty feet. Suh-A~siHtant Fendall also reported at Chattanooga in Octobel'. B1~i11g then under order" for duty with the :M:issfasippi s11uadron, his st:Ly was limited to the tiine suffici1mt to reconnoitre the country for a toad acros;; Raccoon mountain, from Kt>lly's ferry to ~Whiteside. After performing this service he proceeded to Vicksburg. The journey of the partief' asRigned to ilervice at Chattanooga was attended with unusual difficulties, ai·ising in part from the sca1·city of forage for the animab nsed in transportation, and partly from the almost impassable conclition of the road3 between Stevenson nnd the ground occupied by tl1e army.

SuTl'cy rif Cllickamauga battlc-grmmd, Georgiu.-Sub-Assi;,;tant C. II.:Buyd was detailed for field service in Decemht·1" to meet an application from General W. L. };Jliott., chief of cavalry in the army of tl1e Cumberland. On reaching Chattanooga he reported to l\Iajor General Thomas, imd was at ouce attached to the staff. In arldition to tl1e duties assigned at headquarters, Captain Iloyd at the end of January commenced a triangulation of tlw conn try south of Chattanooga, to iuclude the battle-ground of Chickamauga. .A base was measured, and points were determinecl iu t.be usual way by the theodolite at seventeen stations. A topographical survey being ordered by )lajor General Smith, chief engineer, that duty was taken up without delay. Mr. Boyd's plaue-table sheet includes about fifty square miles, and takes in all the ground occupied by the contending forces at the battle of Chickamauga. On another topographical sheet he tracecl the defensive lines and works around Chattanoogri, and drew range-marks for the chief of artillery. These ;mrveys and duties in the line of 111ilitary service occupied the time of Captain Boyd until the end of ,July. He then reported to the office in 'V ashington, and there deposited the notes of his field-work and the plane-t.abfo sheets referred to. Sernice with the 11fississipp£ squadron.-rI'he party of Assistant F. H. Gerdes has now completed three successive terms of service under the orders of Admiral Porter. 'l'hat of the present season includes several im1wrtant surveys on the Mississippi, on the Ohio, and on Red river, wl1ich will be l1est de11cribed under separate hloads. After conferring personally with the flag-officer, in October, 1863, and leaving Sub-Assistant Clarence Fendall in the sectiou, Mr. GeL·des returned to New York. Ile joined the squadron at Mound City at the end of January following, with two aids, Messrs. T. C. Bowie and J.B. Adamson. Sub-Assistant F. F. Nes was assigned to sen ice with this party, but was compelled to return by serious illness contracted at Cairo. Before taking up duty for the squadron, Mr. }'endall met the call of the chief engineer of the m·my at Chattanooga for topographical service, and reported to the admiral on the 14th of November. Of the surveys made during the season terminating on the 1st of July, those on the .Mississippi will be first mentioned. Reconnaissance between Rodney and Palmyra bend.-The result of this reconnaissance is a map showing on a large scale aLout fifty milce of the cour8e of the Mississippi, its ma.in channels, shoals, bars, the single plantations on its bauks, the distinction of woods and cultivated grounds, towns, bills, swamps, the landings, roads leading into the interior east and west, the usual crossing-places, and many other features. In this work the party of Allsi~tant Gi~rdes wa~ occupied fonr weeks during April and May. 'l'he map has been inked, and is now at the office in Washington. An engraved reduction of it is given with this report. (Sketches Nos. 29 aucl 30.) Topographical and kydrographic surney at Grand Gu,if, Mississippi.-For this survey l\fr. Gerdes bad the use of the armed steamer Curlew, and force sufficient to resist the attacks of guerilla parties that would otherwise have rendered i.t impracticable.

Trirrngu1ation r!f' Suisun iay, California.-The triangulation of Snisun buy was commenced on the <!<;;th of July by A~,>iRt:mt .T. S. Lawson, with a party, in the brig Fauntleroy. Almo~t the entire shore-line of the bay is bordered by marsh, off which arc extensive flat~ of Yery pnft mud. By taking advantagf: of Ligl1 water the reconnaisrnnce was snccc~sfully made, and point~ were determined for the use of the hydro.graphic party. l\lr. Lawson erected ten signalt', and by the l~t of Septernlier had occupied two stations with the theodolite, and measured twenty-two anglP~ by nine hundrerl am1 fifty-two observations. The triangnLition is yet in progre8s. A stretch of about nine mile8 will be included in tlw triangulation work of the 1nesent sca~on. :Mr. C. B. Boute1le aid!'d in the party of Assistant Lawson until the 1st of May, and was then tran~forred to the hydrogmphic party of Assistant Edwards. ll.1Jdrograplt.1f qf Ha{f 111oon bay, Calfurnia.-This work was commenced by the party of Assi.~tant A· F.

U0dgcrs developed a dangerous ledge of rocks extending about half a mile in a direction parallel to thP co fist, and nc>arly two miles off shore. The reef has an average depth of tlll'ee and a half fatlwrns, hut i~ much br .. ken, aud is marked at its rnnthern end by a rock with only four feet of wat('r. Of Half l\Ioon liay a;. a harbor AssiRtant R, 1dge1·s reports as follows: "The a11cl1orag(· i:o uol much to lw rPcommcndcd except as an altcrnati\T, althongh the approaclH'S to it ar(' plaiu, and the watci· l1<:tween the reef and the beach bold, ancl l'hoaling gradually on either hand, so n.c; to make it easy by tlll' U~<' of tlie lefld to reach tl1e ancl10rage witl10ut ri~k.

Assistant Rodgers remarks in closing l1is r('port: "Half :\loon bay is t11e shipping point for a large and fertile farming country, some five tl10usai1d tons of produce being freighted thence to Sau I<'ranciRco every season. An unbroken view of fields of wheat, oats, barley, and pota·oes, which an· the staples, and which grow with luxuriance, attests the fertility of the soil. It i:o eultivatcr1 to the very edge of the bluff::; which overhang the coast for a distance of twcut.y-five miles north aucl south of the anchorage." Resurvey near Marc island na1·y yard.-At the request of the commandant the channel of J\lare hland strait, oppo8ite to the navy yard, was resuryeyed in March by Assistant Rodgers, with a view to determine the extent of changes that might have occurred, and to facilitate the operation& necess:ll'y in dredging. In making the requisite soundingtl two hundred and fo1-ty-nine positions were determined, and nearly fin· thou~a1u1 casts were made with the lead_ The hydrography included the entire breadth of the strait from the northwcBt end of the island down to the junction of Mare island and Karquines Btrnits. Assistllnt Lawson, being then in the vicinity of l\larc island, co-operated in this snrvey, as did also Assistant Edwan]s, who arrived in the i;;ection before the soundings were completed. Assistant Rodgers was called upon in November to make a hydrogmphic Burvcy around the ;;hip .Ar1nila, tha\ ves8el havin,,. sunk at San }'rancisco with a valuable freight. This was promptly douc, and the ret<ults, showing the best ~ode of proceeding in order to save the plates of the monitor Camanche, wer~· furni,;hed to the naval authorities. Hydrography.-On the 1st of March Assistant W. S. Edwards was assigned to duty on the western coast, with instructions to take charge of the schooner Marcy, and to succeed Assistant Rodgers in the direction of the hydrographic work.

Triallgulation and s!iore linP surrey ef I\.oos bay, Oregon.-'l'he rmrvpy of Koos bay was in progress when my report of last YL'ar was closed. In a(1Uition to the work then reported, AssiKtant J. S.

A 1irelimimu-y topographical Htuvey made at the same tim(' eornpri~es forty-one miles of shore-line, ancl nineteen miles of outline of marsh. The following i~ au extrnct from the concluding report of Assistant Lawson:

"From Nortl1 Bend to the heaJ of Koos bay then: are but two narrow channels. The main om~ and the only one available for Yessel~ of any <lrnught is quite close to the western shore, and leads into the slough on whic11 the coal mines are situated. 'l'he other lies on the eastern side an<l is narrow. In some place;; it a11proaches near to th<: shore, and in others winds throngh the flats, which are bare at low water, and embrace nem-1y all of this piut of the bay. This channel is used only by boats. It leads directly into Koos river, which emptieB into tlte southeast end of the bay. Across the head of the bay there is a third channel connecting the two just described, but it is of no importance. Near the mouth of the river thei-e are seYeral snags that narr1iw the cliannd, imd give it an irregular course." "Along the line of low water in each of these channels small signals were placed from one hundred . to three hundred mctreR apart. Tl1e~c, in running the shore-line of tl1c bay, were determined in position Ly tlie plane table. The same wa,; don!' in otl1er parts of the bay where the Hats extended any considerable di~tauce from the shore, as off Pony Point." As:iistaut Lawson completed at Sau Fmncisco the office work connectt.~d with the triangulation of Koos Lay, and forwarded tLe sheet containing the shore-line survey. Hi8 subsequent work has already been referred to. Tidal ob.Yeri·ations.-The station at Astoria, Or!'gon, has remained in charge of J\:lr. L. 1Vilson, nnder the gPnPral supervisi1J11 of Captain G. II.

IlE.·.LFORT, N. C., 2\Iay 2, 1864. Sm : I have the honor to report the completion of the resurvey of tlie entrance to this ha1·bor, from sea to }'ort ~lacon, in accordance with your instructions of Ma1·ch 21. The buoys have been placed FO a~ to mark the line of best water in the channel, and in conformity with the changes that have taken place since the last survey was made. 'l'he work was commenced on the 7th of April, and continued up to date. The principal changes in the channel occur at Black buoy, No. 3. It was placed in 18G2 in twenty feet of water to mark the point of the Bouthwest breakers. Since then the breakers have extended to the wei>tward about one hundred yards beyond the original position of the buoy, and but eight feet of water was found at it~ position. It was removed into sixteen feet. Abreast of Red buoy, No. 4, in mid-channel, a bank has formed with twelve feet of water upon it. Its extent is about four hundred yardB ina northwest and southeast direction, with thirteen feet on its eastern and thirteen and a half on its western side. To indicate its position for vessels entering this port, I have ~hifted buoy No. 4 from the eastern edge of the channel to the west side of the bank into fourteen feet water. l1y changing the position of Black buoy No. 5 to the southward and eastward to mark a twelve feet spot on the west edge of the channel, the buoying of the best line of water in the channel has been effected. According to the uew survey, fourteen feet was the least water found on the outer bar, rmcl thirteen and a half the best on the inner bar at mean low water. The mean riEe and fall of the ticks is tliree feet. Referring to the cliart you will perceive considerable change in the shore line at tlw uorthwest point of Shakelford island. A strong culTent at the mouth of Core sound is washing away that point, aacl is probably the cause of the formation of the bank in mid·channcl, and the making of a new chanael to the ~outhward of Illack buoy No. 7. This new channel, as well as the upper part of the harbor, also, will be thoroughly examined during the present month. * * * · Ju conclusion, I would express my acknowledgments to Commander Dove, of the navy, for his cheerful co-operation and promptness in furnishing means and facilities to cany out your instruc. ions.

New Bern, September!), 1SG4. SIR: I have the honor to report the completion of the bydrographic survey of the chnnnd leadiug through the Straits and Core sound, from Beaufort harbor iuto Pamplico sound, North Carolina. Fin' fept of water were found on Harbor Island bar, which depth can also be canied over the shoalest pl.ices in the channeJ through the sound. Southerly winds depress this depth to four feet seven inches, whil1· northerly and easterly winds increase it to nearly six feet. The entrance and bar at Harbor island havP hePn marked by three iron can buoys, painted white and black, in perpendicular stripes. The outer buoy, a sccond-clas:< can, was placed in seventeen feet of water, sticky bottom, one-fourth of a mile outside the bar; southwest of it three-eighths of a mile is the bar buoy, a third-class can, in five and a half feet; and S. by W.~ ,V., ouehalf mile from it, lies the inner buoy in eight and a half feet of water.nearly in the position of the former lightvessel. l<~rom 11ere the channel was marked by hand stakes, marking the points of shoals and pointing to 8 cs

Thl· following table~ will cna1 le navigatora to ascertain the timu 1rnd height of high and low water in some of the principal portB of the U nitcd States. The rc~ults are a1iproximate, tlw nl18ervations being still in progress, am! the pt:riocl of f:'everal of tlicm oteadily on the increast· a8 the coast survey advances. 'The tides ou the coast of the l: nitcd States, on the Atlantic, Gulf of :Mexico, ancl l'acific, are uf three different classes. Those of the Atlantic are of the most ordinary type, ebbing and flowing twice in twentyfour hours, and having but moderate differenc<.:s in height between the two wccessive high waters or low water~-one occurring before noon, the other after noon. Those of the Pacific coast also ebb and flow twice during twenty-four l1ours, but the morning aud afternouu tides differ very considerably in height-so much so that at certain periods a rock which has three feet and a half water upon it at low tide l!lay be uwaeh on the next succeeding low water. Tl1e intervals, too, l1etween succe8sive high and succes~ivc low W<tter,; may b2 very mwr1ual. The tidc8 of porl s in 1he Gu If nf J\fo:x ico, Wl'Ht of Cape St. GeorgP, ebb and flow, as a rule, but one{' in twenty-four ho1m,, or ari· singl<!-clay tide~. At particular parts of the mo11th there are two small tides in the twt·llty-:our bonrs. Tl1e 1·ioe and fall in all t.lie~e ports is small. East of Cape :-it. Georgi' tl1e rise and fall iucn.,tse~; th1~re are two title:;, as a rnle, during the twenty-four hours, aud the daily inequality referred to in the Pacific tides is lm-ge. 'l'hese pee11liaritic8 rf;rp1ire a different way of treating the cases, and in some of them separate tablPs. I prnposP to enable the navigator to :find, from the Nautical .Almanac and the following tables, the time and height of high and low water at any date within the ordinary range of difference produced by winds and other variable circumstances. I will endeavor to dinst tlie matter of unfamiliar teclmical expressions as far as practicable., tl1011gh, for shortness' sake, some such terms may be employed after definiug them. The discussion of the Gulf tides has not been carried so far as to enable me to present the 1·esults in as definite a form as the others. As is well known, the intr;rval between the time of the moon's crossing the meridian (moon's transit) and the time of l1igh water at a given place is nearly constant; that is, this interval vades between moderate limits, which can be assigned. The interval at full and change of the moon is known as the establbbmcnt of the port, and is ordinarily marked on the charts. As it is not generally the average of the interval during a month's tides, it is a less co11Venient and less accurate quantity for the use of the navigation than the average inten·al which is used on the Coast Survey cha1·ts, and is sometimes called the "mean" or "corrected establi~hment."* The following table gives the priucipal tidal quantities for the different ports named in the

'l'he <luration of the flood is measured from the middle of thP stand at low water to the mitlrlle of the stand at high wat<>I', so that tlie whole duration from one high wntei· to tlic next, or from one low wat<>r to the next, shoulu be given by tlic sum of the nurn ber~ in the eighth and ninth eolnmm<. At most of thPH' places given in the lie<t a mark of reference bae been established for the height of the tide. I have omitted the dei'cription of these marks, (except in the following localities,) as of no particular i11te1·est in thi~ connexion.
BENCH·lllARKS.

Boston.-The top of the wall or quay at the entrance of the dry dock in the Charlestown navy yard is fourteen feet 160"o (or 14.69 feet) above mean low water.* New York.-Tbe lower edge of a straigbt line cut in a stone wall at the head of a wooden wharf on Governor'A island is thirteen feet -fu'u·(or 13.97 feet) above mean low water. The letters l~. S. C. S. are cnt in the Fame 8tone. Old Point Comfort, ra.-A line cut in t11e W:lll of the light.-house, one foot from the ground, on the southwest side, i& eleven feet (11 feet) above mean low water. Charleston., S.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

O~'

NoTE.-The mean interval in column 3 has been increased by 12h.. 26m. (half a mean lunar day) for some of tl1e ports in Delaware river auJ Chesapeake bay, ~o as to ~lww the ~ucces~iuu of times from tlie mouth. Therefore 1271. 2Gm. ought to be subtracted from the eEtablishmcnts which are greater than that quantity before using them. The foregoing Tahle I gives tl1e means of determining, roughly, tlie time and height of high water at the several port:i named. 'l'he hour of transit of the moon preceding the time of high water is to be taken foim the Almanac, and, the mean establishment being added, the time of high water results. Thur;: Example 1.-It is required to find the time of high water at New York on November 5, 1854. The Americiln .Alumnae gives Oh. Om as the time of transit of the moon on that day. The mean interval fm New York, from Table I, column 3, is Sil. 13m., which, as the transit was at Oh.. , is, roughly, the time of high watc1·. 'l'hc moon being full, the height is that of spring tides of column G, viz: 5.4 feet. If the soundings on the chart arc reduced to low-water spring tides, 5.4 fret are to be added to them to give the depth at !1igh water. If the soundings are reduced to meau low water, the rise and fall of mean tides being 1.1 foot less than for springs, the rit'c or increase of depth will be half of this, or 0.6 of a foot less than 5.4 foet, which is 4.8 fod, or nearly four feet ten inches. Example JJ.-Requiret1 the time of high water at 13oston on January 23, 1851.

It will suffice to take the lialf hour wl1ich may he over any number of hourB, a& the correction for less than this would be less than one minute, and need not bl' takt·n into account. Thus, B<lSton is 4h.. 44m. west of Greenwich. 'l'he correction to be applied to the tim(' of trau~it of the moon i:<. for the four honro, eight minutes, and for the forty-four minutes, one minute.

In these the variations in the interval between the moon's transit ancl high water are shown for some of the principal ports contained in Table I. 'I'hese variations. of intervals depend upon the age of the moon, and, as they go through their values in half a lunar month, are known as the half-monthly inequality of interval. The table extend~ from the 0/i.. of tran~it, midnight of the calendar day, or full of the moon, to 112 hours. Tl1e numbers for cl1angc of the moon correspond to those of Oh., and for 13 hours (or lli. p. m. of tl1c calendar day) to 1 hour, aud so on up to 23 hours. 'l'he ports for which the nurnbe1·s are given arc de11ignated by the heading of the column. The mean inte1Tal. it will be seen, does not occur at full and change, but nearly two days afterwards, on the Atlantic coast. At Key West it occurs more nearly at full and change, and at San Francisco still more nearly. The same remark applies to the heights; spring tides occur about two days after the full and change of

the moon, and neaps two days after the first and last quarters .· The use of this table of nearer a1iproximatiou is quite as simple as that of Table I. Rufe to find tlte time qf ilig!t water.-Look in the Alm1rnac for the time of thP moon'~ transit (or southing) for the date required. In the table corresponding to that time will be found tlw numlwr to be added to the time of transit. Example III.-Required, t1e time of high water at New York October l, 1856. rsing the l~uitc·d States Nautical Almanac, we find th<' time of the moon's transit 11l. 2±m., astronomical reckoning, or lh. :1 !m· p. m. calendar time. From Table II we have, under the heading of New York, for 1/1. :!Om. (the nean:~t number to lll. 24m. in the table) 8k lOm. Thus, to ll1. 24m., time of moon's transit, Add 8 10 interval found in Table III. The Rum 9 34 p. m. is the time of high water on the 1.it of October, 18il6. If the sum of these numbers had exceeded twr·lve, the ticlP would lmve belongPd to 0<'tober 2, and we must have gone back to the tranl'it of the day before arnl computed with it to obtain the tide of ( lctober L Rule to find tlte lieigltt ef ltiglt wuler.-Enter Table III, column 1, with the time of moon's transit. In the column headed with the name of the place, and marked .A, will he found the rise and fall cclrre8ponding to the time of transit; in column B the number to be added to soundings on the chart, where the ~ouudings are given for mean low water; in column C the uumber to be added to charts oi" which the sounding:; arc given for low w;tler spring ti<les. In the foregoing example, (III,) the time of transit being between 1 and :::! hours, we fincl from Table III the rise and fall of ti"des on the 1st of October, 1856, between 4.9 and 4.7; the number to LP added to sounding given for mean low water 4.5 feet, (column B,) and for low water i"pring tide~ (column C) 4.H feet. Having found the iime of high waLer, that of low water may be obtained, nearly, by adding the duration of ebb .from column 9, 'l'able I. The time of the next preceding low water may be f1mnd by subtracting the duration of flood from column 8, '!'able I. The time uf the next following high water may lw found by adding the duration of both flood and ebb, and of the next preceding high water by 1mbtracting the same duration of the whole tide. Example IT':-To find the next high water following that of Example~ III. The duration of flood, column 8, Table I, for New York, is Git.

TIDES OF THE PACIFIC COAST AND OF PART OF THE COAST OF FLORIDA..
On the Pacific coast there are, as a general rule, one large and one small tide during tl1e day, tl1e height of the two successive high waters occurring one a. m. the otl1er p. m. of the same twenty-four hourn, uncl the intervals from the next preceding transit of the moon are very different. The inequalities depcnrl upm1 the moon's declination; they disappear near the time of the moon's declination being nothing, arn\ are grPat('St about the time of its being greatest. The inequalities for low water arf' not th<' 1<ame as fm· high. thongh they disappear and have the greatest value at nearly tlie same timPs. Thi~ titles of tlu~ ~outliern iiart of Florida and of the western coast of tlrn.t peninsula, as far as St. ]fark'"· arP of the sanw elmractcr. In Puget'8 r<mmd the inequalitieo; for tlrn interval of high water and for the height of low water follow this rule; but tl10se for the intci·val of low wat<~r and height of high watC'r r1isappcar about one day I,cfore tlw moon's declination is greatest, and are greatest about four or five days before the greatcFt d<·clination.

The lowest of the two low waters of the day is one which follows next the highest high water. The nature of these tides will probably appear more plainly from the annexed diagrams.

the ti.:le is set off at the side on a scale of feet, and the hours of the day are at the top. At 12 noon, for example, the tide-gauge marked 6.7 feet. ,Joining all the lieights observed in the twenty-four hours, we lrnve a curve like that markf'rl in the figure. The two high waters arc a and c; the two low waters b and d. If a is the l1igh water which occurs about tweh-e hour~ after the transit of the moon, when the dec1iuation is south, the ebb a b is quite small, and the 11igh water, a, is much lower tlian the next liigh water, c. If the moon's declination i" nodh, it is the large high water, a, of the seeonrl diagram which occurs next after the transit, and about twe1ve hour~ from it. At Key '\Yest the contrary obtains, diagram 1 apply0 ing when the moon's declination is uorth, and diagram 2 when south. Tables IV and V give the numlJer to be adcled to the time of moon's transit to iind t11e time of high water almost as readily as iu the former case. 'I'hcy are of double entry, the time of transit being, aR before, placetl in the first column. The number of days from the day at which t11e moon had the greatest declination is arranged at the top of the table. Entering tl1e first column with the time of transit, and following the line horizontally tmtil we come under tl1e column containing the days from the greatest Jeeliuation, we finrl the number to be aclded to the time of the transit to give tlic time of high water. lf the ruoon's declination is south, Table IV is to be used; if north, Table V. Tabl<'s IV to IX, inclusive, havr' hPcn recomputed, using more complete data for the inequalities above referred to, and to those for Sau :Francisco similar_,tablcs have been added for San Diego, Astoria, l'ort Town~hend, arnl Key '\Vcsr., }'la. For the other plaees on the '\Vrost.ern Coast given in 'l'able I the following ru1c8 will give 1rnfficiently close approximations. To obtain the time~ of high or low water for San Pedro, Ouyle1~8 h>trbor, and San Lai~ Obispo, compute first the time for San Diego by 'fables IV, Y, or VIII; then add to the time thus obtained 30 minntes to obtain tbe time for San Luig Obispo, and subtract 13 minutes for Ouyler's harbor. At San Pedro the time of higl1 or low water if' spnsibly tlie same as at San Dit;go. }'or l\lontcrey, South l<'arallon, Mare Ishnd, Benicia, Ravenswood, and Borlcga, cornpnte first the time for San Pranci~co; then subtract from the time thus obtained lh. 44m. for Monterey, lh. 29m. for the South Farallon, and 49m. for Bodega, and add 34m. for Mare Island, lli.. Mn. for Benicia, and 30m. for Ravenswood. For Humboldt bay, Port Orfo1·d, and Neeah harbor, compute first the time for Astoria; then subtract from it 40m. for Humboldt bay, 17t. 16m. for Port Orford, and 9m. for Nccah harbor. For Steilacoom and Semiahmoo bay, compute first the tirne for I'ort Townshend, and add to it 57m. for Steilacoom and l/i. for Semiahmoo. Tlie approximation will be only a rough one for Steilacoom. For the heights, Tables VI, VII, and IX for San Diego can be used without change for Sau Pedro, Cuyler'<! harbor, aud Sim Luis Obispo. 'l'hese tables for t\au Francisco are also applicable to Monterey, South Farallon, and Bodega. For Mare Island add 1.2 foot, for Benicia. 0.9 foot, and for Ravenswood 2.7 feet, to the quantities for San l'rancisco. }'or Humboldt bay, Port Orford, and Nceah harbor, the tables for Astoria may be used, subtracting l .7 foot for Humboldt bay, and 1.0 foot for Port 01ford. For Neeah harbor the tables will give approximate results without chri11gc. }'or Semiahmoo bay, add one foot to tlrn quantities in the tables for Port 1'ownshend. For Steilacoom, a rough approximate may be obtained by adding 4.6 feet to them. For the coast of J<~lorida, compute the times of high or low water for Key \.Vest, and subtract lli. 7m. for Indian key. and add 26m. for Tortugas, :u,. 3\lm. for Charlotte harbor, lit. 5lm. for Egmont key, 3h. 45m. for Cedar krys, and 4h. Sm. for St. Mark's. ~'or the height11, add half a foot for Indian key, and use the tables without change for Tortugal'I and Egmont key. For Cedar keys and St. Mark's the results could not be obtained with much accuracy in this way; special tables will be prepared for those places.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

If we disregard the c:laily foer1uality, the column hPaJed San Francisco in TaLle II woulrl give us, as in the examples on the Atlantic coast, the means of determining the time of high water. Example V.-Required, the time of high water at Korth Beach, San :Francisco, California, on the 7th of February, 1853. 1st. The time of the moon's transit at Gree11wich, from the Nautical Almanac, is llk. 4lm.; the longitude of San Prauci~co Sh. 1Om., requiring a correction of Hlm. to tlu·, time of transit for San l<~ranci~co, which is thu;; found to be 11/l. 57m. 2d. The moon's declination is south, and at the time of transit about two days after the greatest. Entering 'Table IV we find 12/i. (or Ok.) of transit, the ncarmit number to ll/1.. 57m. wl1i.ch the table giYes; nnd following the line horizontally until we come to two da:p after the greatest declination, we £nd 131l. 14m. To llk 51m., time of transit of the moon February 7, San Frnncisco, adll 1311. l4m., from column Oil,, transit, and two days after great<ost declination; the sum, 2fili. 1 lm., or lh. llm., February 8, is the time of high water, corresponding to the transit which we took of February 7. If we desire tlie tide of February 7 we must go back to the moon's tranait of the 6th. The example was purposely assumed to show this case. llli Olm., time of transit :Febrnary G, 18.'i3. 13 31 nurnh:r for 1 U. tmnsit, and onu day from greatest clecliuation. Sum 24
32

time of high water Olt. 32m. a rn., Pebruary 7.

The licigli.t ef higlt watcr.-The height of high water is obtained in a similar mam1e1· by the use of Table VI and TablP VII, <'ntering these in the same way with the time of transit and days from the greatest deelinat.ion. Table VI. is for south declination, and Table VII for north.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Example VL-In Example V, to obtain the height of tide on February 7, the declination being south, we enter Table VI for San :Fmncisco, with Olt. of transit, and two days after greatest declination, and find that the tide will be 4.5 feet above the mean of the lowest low water, or that 4.5 feet are to he added to the soundings of a chart reduced to the mean of the lowest low waters of each day. If the soundings of the chart are given for mean low water, then 1.2 feet ought to be subtracted from the 'Table VI and VII; thus, in this example, it would be 3.3 feet. 'The approximate fone of the successive low and high waters of the day will be found by adding the numbers in 'l'alile VIII to the time of the first high water already determined. The table gives the numbers for the different days from the greatest declination.

Tables containing numbers to be added tu tke time ef higli water found.from Tables IV and V, to obtain the successive ltiglt and low waters.

The days from the greatest declination are written in the first and last columns of the table. The second, third, and fourth columns rnfer to south declination, and fifth, sixth, and seventh to north, and the reverse for Key West. The second column gives the number which is to be added, according to the declination, to the time of high water, obtained by means of Tables IV and V, to give the next low water, which is the small low water, b, of diagram I. The third contains the numbers to be added to the same to give the second or large high water, c, of diagram I. The fourth, the numbers to be added to the same to give the second or large low water, d, of diagram I. The succeeding columns give the numbers to be used in the sa.me way for north declination to obtain the low water, b, (large,) of diagram II; the high water, c, (small,) and the low water, d, (small,) of the same diagram. 'l'he rise and fall of the same successive tides may be obtained by inspection from Table IX, in which the first column at the side contains the time of transit, and the successive columns the numbers correspouding to that time and to the number of" days from greatest declination. 'I'he arrangement of this table is like that already given. The numbers for the small ebb tide, a h, of diagram I. or c d, of diagram II, are first given; then tho8e for small low and large high waters, h c, of diagram I, and d e, of diagram II; next, the large ebb tide, c d, of diagram I, or ab, of diagram II; and lastly, from the large low water to the small high water, d c, of diagram I, or b c, of diagram II.

Example VJJ.-Thus, in Example VI, the high water of February 7 was found to be 3.3 feet above mean low water. The declination being south, diagram I applies, and this high water is the small one. To obtain the fall of the next low water, or small low water, we enter Table IX, for San Francisco, with Ok. of moon's transit, and two days after the greatest declination in the first part of the table, and find 1.9 foot, which will be the difference in the height of this higb and low water. Entering wit.h the same transit and duy in the second part, we find 3.0 feet, which is the rise of the large high above the small low water; the difference between 1.9 and 3.0, or 1.1 foot, is the difference of height of the two successive high waters. It is easy to 1<ee how, in this way, the soundings of a chart can be reduced to what they would be approximately at all the successive high and low waters.

TIDES OF THE GULF OF MEXICO.
On the coast of Florida, from Cape Florida around t11e peninsula to St. 1\fark's, the tides are of the ordinary kind, but with a daily inequality which, small at Cape Florida, goes 011 i11creasing as we proceed westward to Tortugas. From the Tortugas to St. Mark's the daily inequality is large and sensibly the same,

84

REPORT OF TTIE SUPERINTENDENT OF

g1vmg the tides a great resemblance to those of the Pacific coast, though the rise and fall is much smaller. Between St. Mark's and St George's island, Apalachicola entrance, the tides change to the single-day class, ebbing and flowing but once in the twenty-four (lunar) hours. At St. George's island there are two tides a day, for three or four days, about the time of the moon's declination being zero. At other times there is but one tide a day, with a long stand at high water of from six to nine hours. From Cape St. Blas to and including the mouth of the Mississippi, the single-day tides are very regular, and the small and irregular double tides appear only for two or three days, (and frequently even not at all,) about the time of zero declination of the moon. The stand at high and low water is comparatively short, seldom exceeding an hour. To the west of the mouth of the :.\fississippi the double tides reappear. At Isle Derniere they are distinct, though a little irregular for three or four days near the time of the moon's zero declination. At all other timefl the single-day t,ype prevails, the double tides modifying it, however, in the shape of a long stand of from six to ten hours at high water. This stand is shortest at the time of the moon's greatest declination, sometimes being reduced to but one hour. At Calcasieu the tides are distinctly double, but with a large daily inequality. 'l'he rise and fall being small, the,Y would often prnsent to the ordinary ohse1·ver the same appearance as at Isle Derniere. At Galveston the double tides a1·e plainly perceptible, though small, for five or six days at the tim<> of the moon's zero declination. At other times they present the single-day type, with the peculiarity tliat, after standing at high water for a short time, the water falls a small distance, and stands again at that height for several hours, then continues to fall to low water. Sometimes it falls very slowly for nine or ten hours following· high water, and then acquires a more rapid rate to low water. At Aransas Pass and Brazos Santiago the single-day tides prevail. Small, irregular, double tides are only perceived for two or three dayH at the moon's zero declination. At all other times there is but one high water in the day, with a long stand of from six to nine hours, during which there are often small, irregular fluctuations or a very slow fall. In the following table the mean rise and fall of tides at the above stations are given. The highest high and the lowest low water occur when the greatest declination of the moon happen8 at full or cliangP; tlie least tide when the moon's declination is nothing at the first or last quarteT. The rise and fall being so small, the times and heights are both much influenced by the winds, and are thus rendered quite irregular. TABLE X.

TO DETERMINE 'l'HE RISE AND FALL OF THE TIDES FOR ANY GIVEN TIME FROM HIGH OR LOW "\YATER.
It is sometimes desirable to know how far the tide will rise in a. given time from low wa.te1", or fall in a given time from high water, or to approximate to the time which has elapsed from low or high wal!'r, by knowing the rise and fall of the tide in the interval. If the proportion of the rise and fall in a given time were the same in the different ports, this would easily be shown ifl a single table, giving the proportional rise and fall, which, by referring to Table I, sbowing the rise and fall of the tide at the port, would give tbe rise and fall in feet and decimals. The proportion, however, is not the same in different ports, nor in the same ports for tides of different heights. The following Table XI shows the relation between the heights above low water for each half hour for New York and Old Point Comfort, and for spring and neap tide:< at each place. Units express the total rise of high water above low Wl\ter, and the figures opposite to each half hour denote the proportional fall of the tide from high water onward to low water. For example, at New York, three hours after high water, a spring tide has fallen six-tenths (sixty-hundredths) of tlie whole fall. Suppo~e the whole rise and fall of that day to be 5.4 feet, (Table I,) then three hours after high water tl1e tide will have fallen 3.24 feet, or three feet three inches nearly. Conversely, if we have observed that a spring tide has fallen three fee't three inches, we may know that high water has passed about three hours.

TIDES IN COASTING.

By observing the time of high water and low water along the coast 'we find the places at wl1ich they are the same. The map of co-tidal lines (Sketch No. 65, C. S. Rep., 1857) show;; that it is high water uearly at the same hour all along the coast from Sandy Hook to Cape Canaveral ; of course not in bays and harbors and up the rivers, but on the outer coast. It is high water exactly at the same hour all along the line marked XII, seen on the chart, near Sandy Hook, and north and south of Hatteras, and with small inteITuptions at Cape Lookout and Cape :!!~ear, all the way to near Cape.Canaveral. The same line extends eastward to near Block island, and south of Nantucket, and then passes away from our coast. At full and change of the moon, along this line, (approximately,) it iR high water at twelve o'clock, Greenwich time, the local time of high water depending upon the longitude of

86

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

the place; or, to speak more correctly, in the average of a lunar month it is high water so many hours after the time. of the moon's passing the meridian of Greenwich. By these lines, called co-tidal lines, we can determine what tidal currents the navigators must expect to meet in coasting; and for this purpose we divide the ports of the coast into two sets, those south and those north of New York. The saili11g lines of coasters, bound to southern ports this side of the straits of Florida, are marked upon the map, and also those bound through the sounds to eastern ports, and outside to Halifax and Etm)peau ports.

VESSELS TO AND 1'"'Rmr PORTS SOUTH OF NEW YORK.
South of Sam1y Hook, New Jersey, the line of XII hours is nowhere more than 18 miles from the coast; that of XI!l nowhere more than 35 miles; that of XIz nowhere more than 48; and XI nowhere more than 110. The distance of these lines of XII to XI hours, (corresponding within four minutes to VII and VI of New York time,) for different parts of the coast, is shown from Table A, where the first column gives the name of the }Jlace, and the second, third, fourtl1, fifth, re:ipectively, the distances of the co-tidal lines of XII, XI!, Xl2, and XI hours. The distances are measured from the ports on perpendiculari; to the co-tidal lines. They may be taken as if measured on the parallel of latitude at all the points for the line of XII hours, aud at all betweeu Saudy Hook aud Cape Hatteras for the lines of XI~ and XI~ hours.

The co-tidal lines are in such directions that at 10, 20, and 30 miles from the coast, between Sandy Hook and the St. John's there is but a variation of seven minutes, and even to Cape Ualiaveral only of eight minutes. Keepiug ten miles from the shore the coaster would pass from 12 hours at Sandy Hook to 11 hours 45 minutes at Hatteras, and increase again irregularly to 12 hours 7 minutes at the St. John's, as sl1own more explicitly in Table B. These three tracks of 10, 20, and 30 miles are inside of the cold wall of the Gulf Stream, and generally in the cold current, except at Cape Canaveral.

It follows, then, as a general thing, from these two tables, that the coaster, in passing from Sandy Ilook to th'l St. John's, would have the tides the same, within some fifteen minutes, as if he remair1ed at Saudy Hook; so that leaving, for exampfo, at high water, he would, according to the elapsed time, have the ebb and flood alternating every six hours and a quarter, nearly, as if he had remained near Sandy Hook. As the flood tide sets in generally to the northward and on shore, and the ebb to the southward and off shore, he would know by the time that elapsed from his departure and the period of tl1e tide at "·hich be started what tidal current she might expect to meet as he passed along the coast. This of course, is not peculiar to Sandy Hook as a point of departure, but would be true for any of the entrances given in the table, taking care not to mistake the time of tides within for that at the entrance. By referring to George W. Blunt, esq., I have obtained the tracks of sailing and steam vessels passing from New York to ports to the 11outh of it, as shown by the lines on the chart accompanying this paper. (See Sketch No. 65, C. S. Rep., 1857.) Tracing these on the map of co-tidal lines, l have determined how the navigator would find the tides as he passes from port to port. The results are shown in the annexed table, _(C.) in which the port between which and Sandy Ilook the mariner passes is at the heacl of the table, and, at the side, the 11lace off which the co-tidal hours will be found, as stated in the table.

Thus from Sandy Hook to Delaware bay, starting with 12 hours 5 minates, off Barnegat there would be, at the same instant, 11 houri! 57 minates, and off Cape May 12 hours 10 minates, so that the navigator would have the same succession of tides whether he remained at Sandy Hook or pa~sed onward to Delaware bay, or whether he came from Delaware bay to Sandy Hook. So from Sandy Hook to Charleston he will find, at the same instant, 12 hours 5 minutes at Sandy Hook, 11 110urs 57 minutes off Barnegat, 11 hours 45 minutes off Cape May, and so onward upon the pamllels of latitude for the several points. For all practical purposes, then, ef coasting, tlw succession <iftlte tides, and, ef course, efthP, tidal currents ef.flow and ebb, will be tlte same as if tlte navigator remained stationary. Leaving at low water he will meet the flood for 6 hours 15 minutes, and then the ebb for auother 6 l1ours 15 minute8, and so on. It is the simplest of all rules that has thus come out of this investigation. 'That remarkable change of the temperature between the waters of the in·sl1ore cold current and the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, occurring in so short a di8tance that Lieutenant Baclie called it the" cold wall," takes place at distances off tl1e coast of from 170 to 29 miles, (see Table D,) between Sandy Hook and Cape OafrnYeral, mea·ured, from tlu; several points named in the table, at right angles to the direction of the coun;e, or measured along the parallels of latitude of the points, at distances from 195 to 28 miles, between Assateague and Cape Canaveral, (Table D.) The pointil where the parallels north of .Assateague meet this division line lmve not bee11 accurately determined. The annexed table shows these distances measured at right angfos and on the parallels.

REPORT OF TliE SUPERINTENDENT 01''

In pas~ing from New York to an eastern port the first great change in the tides and tidal currents is between the East river and Long Island sound; tLe difference between Governor's island and N cgro Point, on )Vard's i,;lancl, at the eaRtcrn entrance to Hell Gate, i;; two hours and forty-five minutes. Between this point and Throg's Point the change is small. The matiner is now in the full tide of the sound, and between 'l'hrog's Point and Fit<her's island there is a difference of time of but two hours and twenty minutes, the greatest part of which is at the bead of the sound and at its entrance-that is, nea1· Throg's Point, and t isher's island. From off New J,ondon to off Sand's Point the difference is but one hour and forty minutes; so that if the mariner, instead of remaining at Throg's Point, passes onward to Fisher's island, lie woulrl lose but half a tide iu the w lwle pa~~age. In otl1er words, he would have the same succession of rise and fall, according to tl1e time elap,,ed, whether stationary or passing onwm·d, within two lllnus and a half, or less than half a tide. The tidal cmrent lines show that evcn a less allowance is to be made for the change of current than for the change of tide, the difference in the change of cmrent between Throg's Point and Fisher's island, along the midrlle of the sound, being of no practical importance. l\1ssing out of Long I slaud sound the tidal hours grow earlier, until off Block i~land that of Sandy Houk is again reached. The co-tidal line of Sandy Hook and Jllock i~land being the Bame, it is the strnggle of the same tide through New York bay and the narrow East river, and ob8tructed Hell Gate, and through l'~isher's island and Long Island sound, and to 'l'hrog's Point. The tidal currpnts meet near 'l'hrog's Point. The lower part of N arraganset bay lias tl1e co tidal hour twelve hours, nearly. Buzzard's bay has nearly tlie same co-tidal hour, the tide wave reaching the shore at nearly the same time all arouud the bay. lt would be impossible to give in a small compass a minute account of 1he tides of Martha's Vineyard ancl Nantucket sound. In general, it mlly be said that as far as Holmes's Hole and Wood's Hole they resemble those of Block Island sound, and afterwards those of :\Ionomoy, at the .eastern entrance; but this generalization is un8atisfactory without more details than there is space here to give. In these sounds takes 11lace the rf'markable change of between three and four l10urs, the grcatPst change ot' our coast, dislocating, as it were, the times of high watei· at places south and west and east and north of Nantucket. The whole of this change takes place between the eastern entrance of Nantucket sound and the western of Martha's Vineyard, giving rise to quite a complex condition of hoth tides and currents, wl1ich it has occupied much time to unravel. The dominant co tidal line of our coast, from Block island to Cape Caiiaveral, is that of 12 homs of Greenwich time; that of our eastern coast, from Nantucket to fassamaquoddy, is, in general, 15 hours. Passing out of Kautucket sound, coa~terr< cany nearly the same co-tidal hour to Cape Cod, and tl1ence vary their time about half an hour in passing to Boston, to Portsmouth, to Portland, or to Passamaquoddy. It has long Leen known th11.t the tidal almanac for Boston might ppctically be used for eastern ports. Vessels from New York to Halifax, and :Kew Yo& to Europe, which keep outside, and should keep well off the Nantucket shoals, ul'ld off George's, as shown by the track on the chart, vary their co-tidal hour but little, keeping between the lines of 12 and 11~ until quite well on their course, and beyond Cape Sable. The same rule will apply to their case as has been given for vessels between New York and a southern port.

lllil'ORT TO THE SCPERINTENDENT BY .ASSISTANT L. F. POURT.ALES, IN CHARGE OJ<' THE FIELD AND Ofl;'ICE WORK, RELATING TO TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.
COAST SURVEY OFFICE, October l, 1864. SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field and office work performed by the tidal party under my charge during the past year. Field-work.-'I'he following permanent tidal stations have been continued uninterrupted during the year ending at this date: l~oston, Mass., New York, Old Point Comfort, Va., San Diego, and San' Francisco, Cal., and Astoria, Oregon. 'I.'be station at Eastport remained in charge of .Assistant E. Goodfellow until April 1, his place beiug then taken by Sub-Assistant A. 'I'. )fosman. On July 18 the station was discontinued, and the instruments were transferred to Portland, .Me., where they were set up by Mr. H. W. Richardson, and startt,J nu the fir8t of August. Mr. :M. C. King, the obsnv.er at Old Point Comfort, resigned the position, which he had filled satisfac-

torily since the establishment of t1w station, on the lsi of March. Since that date t11e station bas been in charge of Ordnance Sergeant 0. Kelly, U. S. A. A self-registering tide-gauge was set up at Ray Point, Port Royal f\ournl, S. C., hy Asl'il'tant C. 0. Boutelle; observations began August 22, but were unsatisfactory, the locality being too much expos1'cl. The gauge will be transferred to a more sheltned place in the same sound. The three stations on the western coast have, as in preceding years, been under the efficient supervi:lion of Captain G. H. Elliot, of the corps of engineers, lJ. S. A. The observations at most of the stations have been of a satisfactory character. 'l'he following table gives a recapitulation of the tidal observations received during the past year, exclusive of those taken by the hydrographical parties for the reduction of their soundings.

Ojfice-work.-The following persons have been attached to this division of the office during the past year, though never all at the same time: R. S. A.very, J. Downes, P.H. Donegan, M. Thomas, and F. R. Pendletou. Mr. R. S. A.very remained connected with this division until the end of October, 18G3, being engaged in revision of tidal reductions. He was then transferred to the computing division. Mr. P. H. Donegan read off the times an<l heights of tides from the sheets of the self-registering tidegauges, and made the reductions of the same. He was transferred to the charge of the archives on the first of April. Mr. J. Downes took Mr. Donegan 'ti place on the first of April, and continues on the same work at this time. M. 'l'homas continues to copy the readings of the self-registeri11g tide-gauges fur preservation in the archivee; also does miscellaneous clerical w01·k. 1''. R. Pendleton has continued to make the reductions of the obsenations from the western coast. Very respc~etfully, your obedient servant, L. F.

ON OBSERVA'l'IONS OF TIDES A.T 'I'AHITI, MA.DE l:NDER 'I'HE DIRECTION OF CAPTAIN JOHN RODGERS, U. S. N., (SKETCH No. 40.) The tides nt Tahiti have long been known to exhibit the peculiarity of occurring nearly at the same bour of every day, indicating an almost total elimination of the lunar tide . .As far as we know, the tidef! of no other part of the globe present this extraordinary feature. No explanation fully satit1factory ha8 yet been proposed for this phenomenon. ~ }'rom their hearing on the laws regulating the tides on the North American coast of the Pacific ocean, accurate tidRl observations in central pa1·ts of that ocean were a great desideratum, and advantage was, therefore, taken of the surveying expedition, under the eommand of Captain John Rm1gers, U. S. N., by furnishing him with one of Saxton's self-registering tide-gauges, with the request to set it up at eome suitnble pnint. The town of Papeete, on the island of Tahiti, was selected by Captain Rodgers, and the tide-gauge left there in 1856 under the charge of an intelligent French 8oldier. The observations bPg:m on the 27th of April, but up to June 2 were ao frequently interrupted as to be of little use. After that date they are nearly complete to October 12, subsequent to which time no observations.have been received.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

On t1ie accompanying diagram (sec Sketch No. 40) the mean local time of each high water has been plotted in such a manner that the abscissae represent the days of the month; the ordinates the hours of the day. An inspection of the diagram will show that during part of t11e month of June the tide appears to have followed the general rule, occurring later eYery day, so that there was a high-water successively at all the hours of the twenty-four. In July, however, tlie case was quite diffe1·ent. The high-waters occurred at a later hour on successive days, but only until tliey had reached three or four hours, and in one case five, afternoon or midnight, when they came back abruptly to tlie neighborhood of twelve, to follow again a similar cycle. This type tliey preserve to October 12, when the observations ceased, only the range and the abruptness of the return to an earlier hour becoming lessened. It will also be remarked that the midnight tides diverge less from that hour than the midday tides from noon. The times of low water have, as may be expected, similar l'Clations to 6 a. m. and 6 p. m. Taking the mean of all the observations we find 59 minutes past noon and 53 minutes past midi;ight for the average time of high water, and 4 5 minuteE past six for the average time of low water, both morning and night. Diagram 2 (Sketch :No. 40) shows tbe variations from that mean, arranged according to the moon's transit. '!'he curve exhibited might be called the half-monthly inequality in the soli.tidal interval, in analogy to the curve of half.monthly inequality, of the luni-tidal interval of ordinary tides. With regard to the heights the statements received are not quite precise as to the scale used in the sclfregistering tirle-gange, and some uncertainty arises from tlm zern-point liaving been repeatedly altered, owing to tlie necessity of using the same paper on the gauge several times. On the best supposition that can be made we find the mean rise and fall to be 0.87 ft. Tbe observations made at the same port for a fow days by Captain Sir Edward Belcher, R N, in 1840, (Phil. Trans, 1843,) gave a mean rise and fall of only 0.56 ft. The diurnal im·quality is well marked, and the half-monthly inequality regular and normal. If we examine the variations of the intervals near the time of tlie summer solstice, we shall find that, on the 3d of June 01· a little after, the moon's upper transit comes at noon; the intervals for midday tides is at its mean value. Then the interval increases rapidly every d11y as the moon's transits come later, until they come near the middle of the afternoon, when there is a sudden change of 6'1. or 8h. in the course of two or three days, during which time the tides are 80 small that their times and intervals cannot be well determined. The high-wateTS then seem to pass under the influence of the moon's inferior transits, and the intervals are reduced to their minimum values, or become negative. 'l'he intervals then increase rapidly again for a considerable part of half a lunation until they pass again under the action of, and finally under the control of, the moon's superior transits. The same law will be observed to prevail throughout the period of observation, but the inequality rapidly decreases in amount as we depart from the solstice. Similar observations apply mutatis mutandi.r to tl1e midnight tides. The range of the tides seems to be considerably less near the solstice than they are near the equinox. ·rhcrc seem to have been some notable changes in the mean level of the ocean in the month of July. Hopes were entertained of obtaining more observations, and a supply of paper was forwarded to the United States consul some years ago, but no answer has ever been received. lt has been thought advisable, therefore, to publish the results as far as they have been obtained.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT J. E. HILGARD, IN CHARGE.OF THE OFFICE.
UoAST SuRVRY UFFfCE,

Waalii:ngtcm, November 1, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith the annual report of the operations of the Coast Survey office·

which has remained under my charge during the past year. In the genei:al direction of t11e office I was assisted until .June by Prof. F . .A. P. Barnard, who then withdrew to fill the chair of president of Columbia College. 'rI1e loss of his valuable assistance has been severely felt, but the impress of his mind and the marks of his shaping hand upon every subject that passed under his care will long remain .. The clerical duties of the office have been efficiently performed, as during the preceding year, by Mr. V. E. King, aided by Mr. Wm. Gadsby, jr. Upon the retirement of Prof. Barnard, that portion of bis duties relating to the i1:1sue of maps and charts was assumed by Mr. King.

To Samuel Hein, esq., the disbu!"lling officer of' Coa8t Survey, and to Joseph Saxton, csq., the assistant in charge of the office of weights and measures, I beg leave to express my indebtedness for aid derived from their advice and experience. The detailed accounts of the work performed in the severnl divisions of the office arc herewith presented. J. E. HILGAHD, Assistant Coast Suuey, zn cliarge ef olfice. HvnROGRAPHIC D1v1sION.-The operations in this division lmve been coutiuucd under the direction of Captain C. P. Patterson. These, as heretofore, have included the arrnugement of hydrngraphic matter fo1· the hands of the engraver, the verification of charts, and the preparation of supplementary data for revised editions of sheets already published. The outfit and repairs of vesftels used by the field parties have, as usual, been supervised by Captain Patterson. For office details two draughtsmen were en duty during the greater part of' the year. Their occupation has been as follows: Mr. Arthur Balbaclt made, under the direction of Captain Patterson, the comparisons and verification necessary in advance of t.he issue of charts from the office; the arrangement of notes for the charts; most of the plotting required in the preparation of new charts, as alw that needed for uew editions of sheets heretofore published. During part of the year Mr. Balbach was employed in the special sun·ey of Boston hnrbor. lt1r. Louis Karclter continued the usnal routine of service in the divi:<ion until tlrn eud of September. He made tbe projectiom for the hydrographic sheets of the year; plotted original hydrographic work, and made reductions and verifications. His acceptable services terminated on the !st of October, when he i·esigued. 'l'IDAL D1v1s10N .-The following report of the occupation in this division during the past year is submitted by Assistant L. F. Pourtales. Afr. R. S. Avery remained connected with this division engaged in revision of tidal reductions until the end of October, 1863, when he was transferred to the computing diYision. Mr. P. H. Donegan made the readings from the sheets of the self-registering tide-gauges and reduced the i·esults. He was detached from this division and put in charge of the archives on the !st of April. ~Ir. J Downes was assigned to this division, in l\lr. Donegan's place, on the 1st of April, and has continued the work up to this time. M. Tltomas bas continued to do the copying required, particularly of the reaclings of the self. registering tide-gauges, in shape for preservation in the archives. F. R. Pendleton has continued to make the reductions of the ob8ervations from the western coast. CoMPUTDIG DrvISION.-The duties of the <livision in charge of Assistant C. A. Sclwtt have been increased by the assignment of certain astronomical longitude computations, bnt no addition has been made to the effective force employed in it. Mr. R. S. Avery, formerly of the tidal division of the office, joined the computers on the 28th of October, 1863. Mr. James Main resigned on the 1st of Aug·nst, 1864, on account of ill health. He had been connected with the survey (excepting for a short period in 1859) since November, 1851; by his resignation the office loses an experienced and industrious computm. In consequence of the assignment to this division of the reduction of the observations of Pleiades occultations between 1856 and 1861 for the determination of American longitudes and correction of the lunar ephemeris, acc:irdillg to the plan of Prof. Benjamin Peirce, and under l1is general direction, the distribution of the work assigned to the several computers has been islightly modified. Mr. Main was engaged on the first computation of the occultatioas, and Mr. Avery on the second or check compuLation. .Mr. }Iain's place was afterwards filled by Mr. Werner, to whom the same duty was assigned. On the night of November 13-14, 18G3, Mr. Schott observed and recorded the phenomena of Hhooting stars, assisted by several observers. He was engaged between November 16 and November 22, 1863,. in investigating the deiection of the compasses of the turreted iron-clad steamer Roanoke, then lying off Newport News, in James river. In July and August he determined and located ranges of projectiles fired from li:i·inch guns, monnted on the shore of the Potomac, below Alexandria, and in September and October assi~ted in determining ranges of similar guns in New York a11d Boston harbors. His reports on various subjects this year include: 1.'he fourth report on deflections of compasses in iron·cllld vessc'ls, (see report of the compass committee, report of the National Academy;) a table of observations of shooting stars; results of a discussion of the compensation of base bars ; a paper on the geodetic n p<Jint problem ; a p1iper on great circle sailing on he polyconic projection; a report on the least square reduction of tLe primary trillngulation in Section 1, and

application to that portion connecting it with the Epping base; formulm and a11plication for ricochet shots. Over 1,000 separate observations of occultations of the Pleiaqes have been collected, about 700 of which will be submitted to reduction. Mr. Schott also attended to the comparison of the two computations before mentioned, and furnished information as needed by either field or office parties. The following detailed statement showB the work performed by each computer : Assistant Tl1eodorc vV: TVerncr completed the reduction of the following triangulittions: Penobscot bay, Section l, 1SG2, G. A. Fairfield, obsc1"Vcr; Neuse river, N. C., 1863, same observer; coast of New Jersey, soutl1 of Navcsink, N. J., 18Gl-'62-'63, J. Parley, observer; vicinity of Baltimore, 18G3, 0. H. Boyd, observer; small additional triangulation, by G. Davidson, of the Canal de Haro, 1854; St. George's river, 1863, Chas. Ferguson, observer; Charlotte harbor, Fla., 1860-'61, W. R. 'Terril, observer; Penobscot bay, Me., 1863-'64, S. C. MeOmkle, observer; he also made some miscellaneous computations, :md a secon1l computation of the horizontal angles at ~tations J'.Jt. Pleasant, Thompson, and partly of Beacon pole; furnished an abstract of angles of the triangulation near Machias bay, Me., and commenced the reduction of the observations of the Pleiades occultations between 1856 and 1861. Mr. W erncr was prostrated by sickness in April and part of ~fay. 1lir. Eugene Xulty completed the reduction of the Penobscot bay triangulation, 1862, S. C. }.Ic0ork1e, ohserver; and nearly completed the calculations for time, latitude, and telegraphic longitndt's, alRo of azimuth nncl magnetic variation, at eleven stations in Western Yirginin, Ohio, and Maryland, lSG-:1, G. W. Dean and party, observers. He then took up geodetic computations, and also performed some work on daily magnetic records. 1vlr.

CA'l'.ALOGLE OF I-IYDROuRAPHIC MAPS, CHARTS. AND SKETCHES PUBLISHED DY THE UNITED STATES COAST Sl.'RVEY TO NOVEl\lllER, 1864.

The maps and charts embraced in the following catalogue are of two general descriptions, which may be distinguished as preliminary and finislu:d. The preliminary charts are those which are issued as soon after the several surveys as is con8istent with accuracy of general delineation, and are designed to supply the immediate and pressing demands of uavigation. The finished charts embody all tlie information furnished by the survc>y, including the minutest details; aud embrace not only tl1e hydrography, but the topography likewise. 'l'he two classes of charts differ in reganl to the amount 1.lf the information which they furuisl1, but not in rcganl to the correctuess of that which is given. The cluuts are various in cl1aract.er, according to the oliject8 which they are deHigned to subserve. The m. :it import ant distinctions are the following: I. Sailing cltarf,y upon a scale of T:!o~ooo· embracing the largest area of any, and desigued to enable the navigator to protract his comBe. :Four of these cover the entire Atlantic coast of the United States. ancl two others embrace the entirn eoast of tbe Gulf of ltfoxico. 2. Ge11eral cliarts ef tlze coast. on a scale of 400\, 00 , for off-shore navigation. These represent the slwre-line and it1:< characteristic features, so as to be readily recognized by the navigator approaching it. 'l'he entire Atlantic and Gulf coastB will be comprehended in sixteen charts of this class. 3. Preliminary .Yea-coast cltart.s, on a scale of 2001000 , for in-shore navigation. These will all be ultimately superseded by the more complete charts next to be named. 4. Coast ckarts for in-shore navigation, on a scale of -Rllioo· exhibiting with minute accuracy every natural and every permanent artificial feature, above or below the water, which can be introduced without occasioning confusion. 'l'hey exhibit, also, the topography for some distance from the shore. Besides the foregoing, there are numerous charts of harbors, bays, anchorages, &c., and sketches of local dangers, on various scales.

ELECTROTYPB Al\'D PJH,TOGRAPH D1v1s10N.-This branch of the work has continued under the direction of Mr. George Mathiot. During the first half of the year he was assisted by Mr. A. Zumbrock, and since then he has performed the work of the division without an assistant The electrotype process lrns been applied, as heretofore, to the dnplication of the engraved plates and the compounding of separately engraved pm·ts of plates. 'l'hirty-two plates, of which seventeen were "altos" and fifteen "ba~~os," were maile during the year. The use of photography for reduciug tl1e original surveys to the publication scales, and for duplicating drawings for otlwr departments of the government, lias been continued. During the year twenty-eight glass "positives," eighty-seven glass" negatives," and seven hundred and forty-six paper prints, mostly of large size, have been made from seventy-eight original drawings. The appended tables ~tate in detail the work perfo1·med in this division :

J,1THOGRAPHING D1v1s10N.-'l'he details of work in this divi~ion were directed until tlie 1st of June by Prefessor P.A. P. Barnard. Ou his acceptance of the presidency of Columbia College, they were devolve<l, together with the supervision of the map printing, upon .Afr. lV. W. Cooper, in addition to usual duties, of which he sti111·emains in charge, in the office of the superintendent. ·when this section of the office W8.8 organized, the outfit for lithographing was adapted merely to the occasiou, connected with increase of the navy, which very largely raised the demand for copies of coast charts, and particularly of such as were needed in blockade duty. In the course of the war, however, much material of public interest came in, furnished in part by our topographers associated for duty with the armies, and partly by the military engineers. To make such matter further available for the public service, facilities for publication have been added from time to time, and data of importance can now be embodied at once, either with.some <>f the military maps already provided in the division or prepared in a separate form, as may he most desirable. The engravings on stone being, moreover, of a uniform scale fo1· a very large part of the southern States, any limits for a special map may be chosen at pleasnre, and a sheet issued promptly when needed in prospective military movements. This remark applies to the area of all the States iu rebellion east of the Mississippi river, excepting the back districts of North and South Uarolina, and the neutral part of '1.'ennessee and to southern .l<'lorida, in which no military movements have taken place. · Much of t.he effectiveness of style in the maps already published, and their ~ompleteness in respect of attainable data, are dne to the intelligent interest given to the work by Professor Barnard while he was temporarily in charge of the division. 'l'he special maps drawn this year by A-Ir. A. Lindenkohl, and by llfr. II Lindenkolil, previous to the end of August, when he retired from the office, comprise the greater part of the States of Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida, and parts of North and South Carolina and of Tennessee. Divided and recombined in various ways, these drawings have all been published, to serve as military maps, and as such they have been in requisition with the two armies under command <>f Lieutenant General Grant and MaJor General Sherman.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The lithographic engraving has been done, as heretofore, by Mr. C. G. Krebs, and, in addition, much of his time and that of JJir. H. LindenkrJhl has been given to the adjustment of supplementary material in the extension or correction of hydrographic charts, and in the revision of military maps, with a view of combining the latest information in successive editions. In the beginning of the present working year Mr. Edward 11-Iolitor was temporarily attached to the division as engraver, and also for a short period in Septembei· last. 'l'ran~fcrs have been made during the year from fifty-four of the engraved copper plates of the office, and from sixty-four lithographic engravings, exclusive o( thirty-seven off:iets, for printing in color. The transfers from copper and thirty-five of the others were made by JJir. Arcli' <l Brown, the remainder by Mr. James Rultl. Several of our hydrographic charts have been issued from the division with distinctive color to mark the parts covered by shoal water. This expedient promises well as a substitute for the engraved "sanding," and is specially adapted to the ready publication of' charts in their complete form. The military maps before referred to have been prepared for color-printing, and range from one to as many as five colora on a single sheet. The statistics of these and of the printing from copper plate transfers will be stated under the next head. The titles of the maps drawn and engraved on etone during the present yeat· are given in a summary of office-work in t11e introductory part of the Superintendent's report. MAP PRINTl!'\G.-In the lithographic division, seventeen thousand fom hundred and cighty-~ine copies of thl' hydrographic charts of the Coast Survey have been printed from transfers during the year on two presses by Mr. Brown aud .llfr. Ruhl. The copper plate press of the office, worked by Mr. Joltn Rutlwrdale, haR furnished ten thousand two hundred and seventy-eight copie:;;, exclusive of fourteen hunrlred and ninetytwo chart proofa taken for the engraving division; and fifteen thousand eight hundred and five copies of hydrograp11ic charts were printed by the tranEfcr process out of the office. The aggregate of charts printed during the year for distribution is forty-three thousand five hundred am1 seventy-two. In the litlwgrapl1ic section twelve thou~and one hundred and twenty.five copies of military maps have been printed Most of the sl1eets being in colors, twenty-seven thousand two hundred and ninety-five impres~ions were required. Nearly nine hundred copies of maps so produced were of five colors; eight hundred of four colors; more than two tbou~and were of three colors; and over five thousand copies were issued in two colors. Including six thousand sheets of various kinds of circulars for official use, the two lithographic presses have given an aggregate of nearly fifty-one thousand impressions during the year. In order to keep up with the demand for war maps, it has been necessary in several instances to send to other printing office!' for the press-work, transfers from our lithograph edengravings. The number of sheets received in that way during the year was ten thousand two hundred. These added to tlrn number printed in the section make a total of twenty-two thousand three hundred and twenty-five copies, and, with the hydrographic clrnrts, an aggregate of sixty-five thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven sheets, exclusive of proofa and circulars, of wl1ieh the number printed was upward of seven thousand. Distribution ef map.Y anrl annual reports.-The charge of the map-room has continued with 111r. M. T . .Tolinstone, and, as will be seen by his returns, a larger distribution has been made during the pre8ent year than in any preceding one. 'l'he total number of sheets printed during the year has been sixty-five thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven, (65,897 .) Of this number, there have been issued from the office fifty-three thousand seven hundred copies, (53,700,) of which thirty-six thousand six hundred and ninety-seven (36,697) have been hydrographic charts, distributed as follows: To the navy_ .... __ ._ ...... - . - . -~. - . - .... - .. - ...... - ...... - .... - . . . . ~3, 159 To sea captains and pilots employed in government service ·. - ..·.... _ ..... . 2,788 'l'o military officers .......................... _...........·. _ .. _ ... _ .. 2,424 By Pale - ........... - ............. - ...... _ .. _ ...... _ ...... _ ........ . 4,598 :Miscellaneous ..................... - ....................... _.. _ .... _ . 4, 72S

Folding-room.-Tbe work of backing with muslin the sheets intended for use by the plane-table and l1ydrographic parties l1as been performed by .ii'Ir. G. TV. Francis. He bas also backed with paper the sailing charts intended for distribntion from the office for the use of the navy. lnsfrument skop.-The charge of the shop has remained with ltir. T. J. Hunt, who is assisted by one workman and three apprentices-the least· force that ha~ for years past carried on the necessary operations . .As a consequence, the work has been _almost exclusively confined to the repairing of instruments nsed in the :field. 'l'hc finished work of the year consists of six metre scales, six 7-inch German-silver protractors, one prismatic compass, three ;:.tands for theodolite~. and one pair of magnets. The repair of instruments during the year consists, in part, of twenty-seven theodolites, twenty plane-tables, nine reconnoitring telescopes, six levelliug instruments, sixteen sextants, seven prismatic compasFes, six marine glasses, four 3-arm protractors, six hcliotropcH, four surveyors' compasses, twelve metre chains, two hair frames, one astronomical eye-piece, two pantograp11s, one large astronomical telescope, one tide-gauge, one camera, one astronomical. clock, two telegraphic instruments, and two spring governors; in addition to whicb a great variety of miscellaneous work has been accomplished for office and :field purposes. Carpenter slwp.-lt1r. A. Yeat11utn still remains in charge of tl1e shop, and is assisted-by one workman. During the year the work lias includl'd tlw construction of a large camera, with stands and rail-tracks; two large first-class map cases for tlie Navy Department; fifteen map and paper cases for the office; thirty-one cases for instruments, such as theodolites, plane-table, &c.; nine new stands for tlieodolites, plane-table, &c.; two levelling rods; seven plane-tal>le boar<lR ; fourteen drawing-boards ; seventeen wooden pans and frames for photographic purposes; twelve frames for electrotype purposes; one stand for a large portfolio; rollers and cornices for twenty-two maps; eighty-four tin cases for holding original sheets of the survey have been printed and numbered; and one hundred and twenty-three rough packing boxes for the transportation of instruments and records. In addition to the above, the office buildings and wood-work of instruments have been kept in repair.

REPORT OF PROFESSOR BENJA.'1IN PEIRCE, OF HARVARD, O~ COMPUTATIONS FOR LONGITUDE FROM OCCULTATIONS 01" 1'IIE PLEIADES.
CAMBRIDGE, IJer:ember 5, 1864. Sm: I have tlie honor to report to yon t11e progress of the computations of the occult.ations of the Pleiades up to the present date. The group of observations from 18CJ8 to 1842 is wholly under my special charge, with the assistance of Mr. CharleR S. Peirce. The computations of the equatiou8 of condition are all made for the first time, and the duplicate computation is also almo!!t completed- The preliminary examination of these equations show the most extraordinary agreement of all the observations of each occultation made at good observatories and by experienced observers, and fully justifies the expectations of their value. 'l'he agreement, with the tables of HanRen, is a1so such as to confirm the anticipations of the excellence of those tables; but there are some nndoubted discrepancies with observation, which seem t<> indicate recondite sources of error in the tables, which it may require much time and thought to investigate_ Thus the occultations of March 19, 1839, clearly demonstrate an error of the tables of about :five seconds of arc. It is easy enough to see what this is not: it is not error of semi-diameter, or of parallax, or of elliptic elements, or of the coefficients of tlie parallactic equation; but what it is is still a mystery. The last group of the Pleiades occultations bas been put into the hands of computers in the office at. Washington by Mr. Schott, under my directions, and is rapidly advandng towards completion.

l!EPORT OF DR. R. A. GOULD ON THE RERGLTR OF CO:l.IPL'TATIONS FOR LONGITUDE BY THE TELEGRAPHIC METHOD.
CA '\!BRIDGE, ~Soremher, 18G·1.

Sm: In presenting my annual report I have thP pleasure of stating that all the determinations of lo11gitude madP under my directions have now been rediscussed, with the aid of the standard Right A;,censions of the survey, and with the values for instrument alconstauts which a long series of years has enabled us to deduce, and which may properly be regarded as the best attainable. Three more determinations may be definitely adopted, viz: m. 11.

'I'he longitudes of the respective station points west of the Seaton station thus become: m. s.

But, close as this accordance already is, I propose subjecting the Seaton-Roslyn determination to a new discussion with the more accurate data now at our disposal before investigating the degree of accordance and the sources of discrepancy. 'I'his measurement, and that of Charleston from Raleigh, which is now essentially computed, and needs only the labor of a few weekR for the attainment of a definite i·esult, complete the series of telegraphic determinations, for which adequate materials exist. A new determination of the difference of longitude between the station points at Washington and New York appears to me highly desirable, and I would urge its importance upon your attention. 'I'he obstacles which the war has interposed for the last three years promise soon to be removed, and there may be risk in long delaying this much-needed measurement. Our best value at present depends on the determinations Washingt.on-Philadelphia and Philadelphia-Jersey City, combined with a geodetic reference of the station point in Jersey City to that in New York; and as these were amo~g the earliest telegraphic determinations ever made by present methods, many of the precautions and refinements now in use were naturally omitted. 'I'he experience of another year has seemed to justify the reliance which we have placed upon the accuracy of our standard Right Ascensions. I have known of no reference to them in other terms than commendation from any quarter, with a single exception, to which I will presently refer. The corretlpouding declinations are still, as deseribed in my last report, in the form d'f equations of condition, which can readily

be solved at any time; but, except in a couple of special ca~cs, the solutions have not bePn executed, owing to my desire to improve the numerical values for some of the sy.tcmatic differenc('S, (adopted for 1·cforence of the places given to the equinoctial points of ArgElandcr's l'ositiones ~lcdia,,) and alw to the wi:lh that as many recent determinations may be incorpornt<·d as poRsible. A very corn;idernble amount of lauor hal'l been expended upon the first-nameJ nl0!,ct during the year, especially as bearing upon the declinations of southern stars, and 1 have been gratified hy firnling it possible to obtain very satisfactory formula~ for the differenceR hetwern the catalogue places of thfl St. Hdcua and Cape of Good Hope ohH·rvatious aud tlrnse of l'oud and Argelander. Define the expiration of another year I hope to deduce the final rc1<nlt8 of this cliecu8sion of the dedi11atio11~. and abo to suhject the list of Hight Ascensions to a new scrutiny by m".ans of ob~e1·vations accumulated since the last computation. 'l'Lc cxc('ptioual i111-;tancc to which l alluded is an astronomer of the Uambridgc observatory, who has sharply criticirnd the Yaluc~ obtained for two of the stars-51 (Hev.) Ccphci and Polaris-in two _commnnicatiom, publichecl in the procee<ling:i of the ,\merican Academy, of Boston, and rei:ltiued in pamphlet form from the observatory. It will be remembered tha~ in the entire list of l 7G stars tlic four polars were the ollly 01ws which wern not subjected to a new discussion in 18Gl; but that the positions for tbeBe wern taken from the im·l'stigatious mad!, in 1 s:;5_ 'G, and pulili~h!,d in volume VI of the Astronomical J, .urn a 1. 'l'he Htars whosP plares, or rather thR ddcrmination of who8e plaees, have now been critici8ed and called iu que~tiou are two of these polarn. for wliid1 I was prepared to find Borne discordance manifi,Htcd 11fter the lapse o!' nine years from t11c late~t ol,~en-atiou~ employcil; but after such examinatiou as I have yrt been able to give, I have the plea~urc of reporting that my reliance on the remits previously deduced has been much strengthened. :Moreover, as the error a~cribed to the resultant places of the Coast Survey list is not of an order of magnitude recognizable by any transit instrument existing, I have felt warranted in leaving tliese criticisms unanswered. Additional investiga.tions have been made during the year concerning the diurrnil motions of astronomical instruments in azimuth. 'l'he results ~iave been confiTmatory of the inferences reported two years ago as to the existence and approximate regularity of the azimuthal fluctuations. I cannot but believe that in all observations, however firm aud deep the foundations, and however well mounted the instruments may be, this diurnal Mcillation must be brought into account, if the be~t attainable Hight Ascensions are desired. A value for the azimuth correction deduced from observations made early in the evening will rarely be found applicable to observation$ later in thfJ night, and nice rersa. During the year 1 lmve Leen aided Ly 1\It-ssrs. Cleveland Abbe and William H. Palmer, to wlwm my best acknowledgme11ts are du<· for valuable and constant assistance. 1\Ir. Abbe, who had given efficil'nt and essential aid for four years, was compelled by ill health to leave my party nt the end of .July, and the rcrent Tl'8ignation of Mr. l'alrner from tbe Coast Survey to enter the naval service leaves a vacancy which will not easily be filled. I am, very respectfully and truly, your obedient ::;ervant,

The problem of determining a position by angles observed upon three given stations being commonly known as the tlt.ree-point problem, the more general form of the same, where the angles, measured at the srrnght station between any number of given points, fix its position, may be desiguated as the n-point

The coefficients of dx and dy can be founcl either by direct computation from the above expressions, or by the use of the logarithmic differences. '\Vith the assumed values for the position of P, we thcTcforc compute the above co-effi1.:icnts and compare the computed and obscrvecl angles, the differences will form the absolute term& of our conditional equations. The two normal equations are next established and solved, and the resulting values of dx and dy applied to x and y. If desirable we may also compute the individual errors of the obser>ations. To illt1~trate the method, I select a.n example from my geocletic :mrvey, executed in aud near the District of Columbia for military purposes in the winter and spring of 18ti3, where this kind of survey was frequently employed as both cheap and expeditions; no special signals were erected. The chief pmpose was to measure a series of heights by means of measures of zenith distance, the horizontal dietances required thc1·cfore only to be approximately known. Should tlrn angles measured at the station I' contain conditions, such as result from sum-angles or from closiug the horizon, we sup11ose them adjusted by least squarest before entering on the present problem. Given the following rectangular co-ordinates of six known stations, and the observed angles at tho station which is to be determined relatively to tlicm.t

By comparison with the observed augles we obtain the conditfonal equations:

If the measured angles are of unequal accuracy, weigl1ts are to be introduced before the formation of the normal equations. If we introduce the values of dx and dy in the expressions of d"a· and apply the resulting corrections to the computed a 11 , we find, by subtracting a 1 from all tlie rest, the final corrected angles, which we can compare with the observed angles o2 , o3 , o4 ···· , when we obtain the re8i<luals, ( obs'd-comp'd,)

The above residuals are

in part (the smaller) due to the incidental errors of the ohserve<l angles, and in part to inherent errors in the adopted co-ordinates of the known points, which produce for short distances apparently large d!ffcrences in tlie angles. To obtain the uncertainty in the co-ordinates themselves, we form the two sets of weight equations and deduce, Ex=± 0.mll, and e.,= ± 0.rnl2.

If all the points fall either in the circumference of a circle or in a straight line, the problem becomes indeterminate; but even an approach to this condition will rarely occur, and is less likely to hap11en the greater the number of given points above three. A convenient direct solution of the three-point problem is here presented under a very concise form: We number the given points in the order of their azimuths, as seen from the fourth point P, which is to be determined, and distinguish three cases, viz: the middle point, l'z, is on the same side of the line, joining P1 and Pa, as is P; or, secondly, P 2 is on the opposite side; or, thirdly, Pis inside the triangle 1\, P 2 , r~. It is only in the second case tliat we need look for an approach to, or for the limitation of, the problem.

CoAST SllRYF.Y (1.) General remarks on tht rnct!tod '!f '/'('duct ion.

OFFICE,

June 1, 1864.

The geodetic connexion of the Epping buse with the primary triangulation forms the first strp in the computation of the- great tt·iangulation connecting the Epping and Fire Island base lines with ite branch read1ing to the Ma~snchusetts base. The applicatinn of the rnetl1oil of least "'JWU"es, without whicl1 the reduction could not be sati:Jfactorily accmnplid1ed, necei'sitates, from the complexity of the numerical operations, that the series of trian;;-les should be' divicled into parts so as to bring each within a limit of practical solntinn. 'l'he number of subdivision:o thus practically <lcrn:rnclecl mu"t be very fow, and they shoulcl be specially selected to d<"tract as little flS pos:sible from the theoreticnl rigor required by the m<>thod. Thus we are obliged to acljust by the method of h·:rnt S(jUares the angles measured at each station separntl'ly, as thdr intro:luction in the general griomctric coutlition of the tri:rngnlation would swell tlHi conclitional equations to l1nndrcds, and irnl<~ed there may be a question whether the adju,;tment ol' the mea>lurcs at each station i::< not the pr~ferable method, rese1Ti11g a further mljustmei:t to the geometrical reqniremente of the triangles. Again, the connexion of the Eppin;; base alone with tho primary Fides of tl1e triangulation, wl1ich forms the sul\j\>et of this report, is so c0mplete as to rt·quire the establislinient and solution of _thirty-five equations, whid1 number would be increased to ;mch an extent, if we were directly to connect one base with the next, as to Lceouw perfectly unwi<>ldy. 'fhe connexion of the Epping base with the primary sic1e Ilnmpbackl\Ionnt DPsert may he regarded as a distinct operation, whid1 receives further intcrc~t from the fact that it requires a cornhination of results from meaBures of angles (by repeating theodolite) and frorn meapures of directions, (direct obseffations by the tl1irty-inch tlieodolite,) alFo an irnprrwed application of wPights, and, in general, It may scrn:, as a ~pecimeu, to illustrate the subsufiuent reduction of the main triangulation of the survey in this section of the country.
(2.) Instruments and methods ef_lwrizontal 1nea.rnres employc1Z in the triangulation near the Epping base.

'l'hc horizontal angles at the ba"e, and at thrPe Htatious next foll1rn·ing, "·ere rnearnred with a Tepcating theot1olite (Coast Survey, No. 43,) by the party in charge of .As~istant C. 0. Boutelle; those at the remainiug four stations werP <leterminf'd by measures of direction with the thirty-inch theodfJlite (Coast Survey, No. 1_) by the party in chm·ge of Profossor A. D. Bache, Superintendent. The fir~t-named instrument is a ten-iuch Gaml1Py, read hy means of verriier"; tl1e Rcconrl iR provided aud rea.'I with rnicroRcopPR. The reduction of the angles from ohserved directions l1as been rnfficicntly explained in Coast Survey Iteport of lS.54, pp. 71 * o 76*, and for tl1e case when angles were measured by repetition or combination in the same Report, pp. 76* to 79*. 'l'he determination of the probable error and weight of each reRnlt, however, requires further exposition. lt should abo be stated that Peirce'8 criterion has been applied to the reduction of the observations.

( 3) Determination

efprobable error and wright

to eaclt di,-cction ohserrcd with, tlte tltirty-inch tlieorlolitc.

'l'hc me1ho<l of obtaining the a1'crage probable error and weight of directions measured witl1 the thirtyinch tlwodolite at any one station h~s been explained and illustratec1 in Coast Survey Report of 18{)4, pp. 86* to !)O·, and the small modification require<l to render the method applicabk to each direction will appear sufficiently plain from the following example for Stat.ion Howard. 'I'o carry out the determination of probable errors in all the theoretical strictness is far too laborious for actual use, and in fact is not required, as a close approximation fully suffices. 'Ve form first the abstract of remaining differences, referred to the initial direction of each series; this abstract is obtained from the abstract of diminished measures by applying the corrections A, B, C, D, etc., with their signs changed to the re~pective quantities in the abstract of dimini~hed measures; for another initial direction than the first, the proper differences (corrections with reversed sign) are to be applied. Freqtwntly thl' corrections to the as8umed angles are small, less than O."l; in such cases no correction was r1'<1uired. In forming the abstract all directions are included, whether belonging to the primary serieM or not; the lnmdredths of seconds have been dropped. The last column contains the average difference in each series.

ThiH errnr must he taken the same for each direction, and is found by subtracting the observing ermr from the sum of the combination and observing errors; thus we compare the adjusted angles with the observed angles, taking care at the same time to take out any constant quantity by which repeating angles are liable

The triangle is denoted by the respective numbers of the three stations, (as stated in art. 5 :) the column headed e contains the s1>herical excess, and the column headed S-(180+e) the error of closing; the last column contains the square of this error. The triangles are arranged in the order of the magnitude of their areas:

(9.) Fina7 determination efprobable errors (and wejg!Jts) to eacli direction.
'l'he combination of the angles to triangles introduces a new kiud of error which must be taken into account; its general effect is to equalize the weights. 'l'his triangle error may be supposed to be principally due to lateral refraction; minor causes may be recognized in the imperfect centering of the theoilolite over the same vertical observed upnn from the other two stations, and in want of parallelism in the verticals at two stations of unequal elevation, and perhaps in other circumstances. If we separate the observing error, previo!-1-sl y deduced from the error obtained in art. ( 8), we obtain the triangle error. For this purpose the probable observing errors of the 276 directions, forming the geometrical figure under consideration, were tabulated, and the avemge a.mount was found to be,
01=± 0.244. "1+c.=±0.299; 2 =±0.''173. eA= v'o.299 2---0-.2-4_4_

Frnm art. (8) we have, hence,

The observing error, therefore, slightly exceeds the triangle error, and shows that the latter cannot be neglected in the true valuation of the respective weights. The final value of the probable error of any direction in the nonagon we ohtaiu, therefore, by combining the obHerving and triangle error, the latter being constant. We then have,

(10.) Relatii:e value of results from tlte tkirty-incli and the tea-indi repeating theodolites. The relative value of the results by these two instmments is only collateral to the present operations of the treatment of the triangulation. From the value;1 of <1 , in art. (5), the probable ob8crving error of a resulting direction is, on the average, with the great theodolitE>, = ±: 0.11 142, and with the repeating theodolite,=±: 0.' 1 321; the relative weights of the measures by the two instruments, as they have been employed near the Epping Base, are, therefor, on the average as 5: 1 respectively. The ratio of the relative weights actually introduced in the conditional equations is, !10weve1·, less on the average, owing to the equalizing effect of the additional triangle error; the proportion of the greatest to the east weight there equals 7: 1. (11.) Formation

ef tlte conditional equations of tl~e rwnagon around

the Epping Base.

For a sketch of this part of the primary triangulation, Sketch A, Section I, Coast Survey Report of 18G2, may be consulted; the stations will be known by their numbers, as given in art. (5). As the formation of the conditional equations and subsequent processes of the method of least squares is fully explained in Coae.t Survey Report for 1854, pp. 79* to 86·, a few remELrks will 1:1uffice here. The number of angle equations between p, occupied points, a.nd l, full (observed forward and backward) lines, is l-p+ 1=21, and the number of side equations between p, points, (occupied or not,) and l, lines, (full or half full, i.e., observed in both or in one dh-ection only,) is l-2p+3=14. 'rhe figure therefore demands thirty-five conditional equations. The side equations may be formed with the plane or the spherical angl&<, as the ratios of the sides remain equally true, but the use of the spherical angles was found more direct and simple, and for this reason was preferred, (see on this point Bessel's Gradmessung in Ostpreussen, 1838, p. 140.) The conditional equatiolli! were at first established commencing with the primary quadrilateral and working towards the base, but the second method was found preferable, viz., commencing with the ba.se and proceeding outward. In the solution of the conditional equations special regard was had to the derived normal equations, in which the

diagonal coefficient should be as large as possible, and the side coefficient as small as possible; the worst conditioned triangles (sum of deviations of each angle from 60° a maximum) and quadrilater~ls may be selected; in the latter angles of nearly 90° Wre avoided, and that station was always selected as pole which either fell within the triangle, (central system,) or which presented the most obtuse angles if outside. Tenplace logarithms (Vega's Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completns, Lipsiae, 1794,) were used in establishing the side equations, and the logaiithmic difference is there given in units of the fifth place of decimals, (and not the seventh, as heretofore practiced,) which was found more convenient; for angles greater than 35°, and less than 145°, the logarithmic difference for 10", as given in the Thesaurus, may be used as correct to the last place; all logarithmic differenceR for 1", for small angles, or for angles near 180°, have been specially computed as follows: Let =small correction (say 111 ) to angle a·, then lg sin ( a+x)=lg sin a+M sin l"x cotg a where lg(M sin 1")=4.3233591 781 and for units of the fifth place of decimals, 9.3233592

REPORT OF THE SUPERlNTENDENT OF

'l'he solution of the normal equations was effected by application of the method of indirect elimination, (Coast Survey Report of 1855, Appendix No. 40,) and was broken off after securing the perfect adjustment of the hundredth8 of seconds in the angles, and nearly the last unit in the seventh place of logarithms of length of sides. The computation of the forty-six triangles showed that the remaining difference in the sum of the angles was, upon the average, a little less than 0. 11 003, and in maximo it amounted to 0. 11 007, which was thought to be a sufficiently close adjustmm1t, considering that the measured angles, with the repeating theodolite, are ouly given to the nearest, 0.1101 in the abstract, and are liable to an average probable error of ± 0.11 45; the angles measured with the great theodolite have an average probable error of ± 0.11 20, (as found from the probable error of the directions in preceding abstract of angles, art. 5.) 'l'he logarithms of the distances show a corre8ponding degree of differences from the mean, amounting, upon the average, to foss t,han a unit in the seventh place of decimal8, and in maximo to two units in that place, the uncertainty in the measme of the base being nearly -ssluoo of its length; the logarithm of the base is uncertain by eight units in the seventh place of decimals. It might be remarked in this place thatOf 15 sides we have 4 independent values for each. Of 8 sides we have 3 independent values for each. Of 3 sides we have 2 inilependent values for each. Of 3 sides we have 1 independent value for each.

If we form the squares of these correcti<ms, and divide their sum by 58, we find the average square, and by extracting the root we obtain the average correction to a direction, as demanded by the geometrical conditions of the figure, 15.0199 " a· . V/ 58' = ± 0.509 for a 1rect1on, and
±0.720 for an angle;

values much greater than those i·esulting from the errors in the measures at any one station, or from their combinations to form triangles, (compare with e1 and e1+ 6 of art. 9.) The error, therefore, arising from a want of prfect intersection of the lines of sight at any one station is the greatest; it may be called "intersection error." This consideration shows that we have even now too much diversity in our assigned weights in the equations of correlatives.

( 14.) Complete adjustment qf tlie nonagon and final tlirect 1:ons.

For the subsequent computation of the triangle sides and the introduction anJ discu~~ion of the aRtronomical azimutb:o, it if' desirable to lmve tl1c adjuBtmeut of the whole figure perfect, the trianglcf' to 0."001, arnl the logarithmic distauceB to the eighth place of decimals; an acl<litionaJ diffcn·uthl or seconc1 order alljmtment by least squares of the remaining small discrepancie~, neglectiug weights, was the1·efore addell to the preceding general adjustment. For thiR :purpose the figure was divided into three parts, and each adjusted separately, without reacting on the preceding. 'l'hc first part compxised the ba8e pentag<m, which form~ a separate system, the angles of which were measured by repetition; it involved nine conditional ec1n,ttions Ldween the second-order discrepancies, (or six angle ancl thn~e sirle er1uations ;) tlie secom1 part cmm<·ct;.1 the penta~on with the side Humpback-Desert hy means of fourteen equations, (eight angle and six side ec1uations;) the third part joins the la6t point$, Howard and Coo1rnr, to the pxececling figure by means of twelve equation~, (seven angle and five sitlc equations.) As this secondary process involves no new feature, the resulting ~mall additional cnrn·ctions to each direction, resulting from it, are at once pre~ented in the table below; these should be added to tlie corrections given in the preceding article:

BEFORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
(15.) Triangle 8idc computations.

The arrangrmt>nt of tlic triangle side computations is the us1rnl one followed in the Coast Survey. I 11ave, however, intro<lucecl a new and less complex notation than Gerling's for the distances: thus, to expn~ss tl1c llistance from station 1 to station 2, I write, 1 .. 2. On tbe first line we liavc tl1c given side, the left-liand (as SPC'n from tlic opposite angle) station being giYen fir:;t. The first column contains tlie number of the triangle; the 8econd colnmn the rnune, and tlic tliird the respective number of each station, that oppoRitc the b:isc being given :first; the fourth column contains the ohsPrved angles-that is, the results found fro"m the adjustment of the measures at Pach station, given in art. 5; tlie fifth column contains the correction due to the co11dition~ of the gPomc·trical figure, and d('rivl'd from mts. 13 and 14; the sixth column shows the corrPcted l'lpherieal angles; the seventh the l'pl1erical excess, and th<' ejghth tlle plane angles; the last column contains tl1e logaritlnus of angles and sidPs. By Lq.;c11r1re's thenrPm, ahcr declncti11g one· third of the spherical excess of tlw triangle from each spherical angle, A, B, 0, the triangle can Le treated as a plane one for the compu.tation of the lengths of the side~, a b, which is readily done by the formulre-

the mPasured or derived basr., c, heing known. The fifth and sixth lines contain the logarithms of the distance~. It will be f'ecn that the whole process is carried out systematically.
The value l1err given for the measured length of the Eppi11g lhs1· is not final, but may receive a small chang1e due to additional experiments of comparisons; its unit io the length of the metre of t.he committee 0f weights and rneaenreR of Paris, 1799. 'l'I1e angles beillg made ont and adjusted to thournndths of seconds, the corresponding nnml1er of decimals io be retai11ed in the logarithm~ of the t1iHtances is eight; these di;;tances were, however, originally made out to ten places by means of V ej:\a' B Thesaurus.

The direction of the azimnth lll'.U"k requires a small change, dne to the adjnstment of the geomf'trieal figure of the triangulation, so as to m'1ke it dependent upon all the directions at each ~tation. It w:ts done aR follows: The a.ugnlar difference of the mark and each direction, as resulting from the abstrnct of re~nlts given in art. 5, was again applied to the adjusted angles, (the sign being reversed,) each direction furnishi11g a result of the reading of the azimuth mark; the indiscriminate mean, without regard to weights, was taken for tl1e final value, and inserted in tlie preceding table of results, art. 14.

Tl1e present list is a continuation of that published in the annual reports for 1851, 1853, 1855, 1857, arnl 18fi(), aud contains the geographical positions uf points determined astronomically and trigonometrically sinl'e the date of t.he former reports, with the repetition of a few points predomly published, for convenience of reference. The present 1mblication, however, is limited to positions on the northern and western coasts. Those on the Eontbei:n coast are aim prepared in m:mu~cript, but their publication at present is not deemed expedient. The followiug expla11ations will give all the information required for the use of the tables: }'ur the purposes of the survey the coast is divided into eleven sections, in all of which the work is The survey being in different stages of progress in tlie several sections, and new re~ults being added from year to year to those here given, the same ai visions have been adopted iu the publication.
carrieu on simultaneou:;Jy.

The several sections are defined a~ follows: Section I. From Passamaquoddy bay to Point Judith. Section II. From Point Judith to Cape Henlopen. Section III. From Cape Henlopen to Cape Henry. Section IV. From Cape Henry to Cape .Fear. Section V. From Cape Fear to St. l\lary's river. Section VI. l'rom St. Mary's river to St. Joseph's bay. l:"Pction VIL From St. Jo~cph's bay to Mobile bay. Section Vlll. From ~lobile bay to Vermilion bay. Section IX. From Y ermilion bay to the Rio Grande. Section X. Coast of California, San Diego bay, to 42d parallel. Section XL Coast of Oregon and '"ashington Territory, 42d to 49th parallel. The tables give the latitudes and longitudes of the trigonometrical points in each section, and tlwir relative azimuths or bearings and distances. '.l'he manner in which these data have been obtained may be briefly explained here. In each section a base liuc of from five to ten miles is measured with all possible accuracy. A series of triangles, deriving the length of their sides from this base, is then established along the coast by the measurement of the angles between the iutervisible stations. In this primary series the triangles are made as lllrge as the nature of the country will permit, because the liability to error increases with the number of triangles. On tlrn bases furnished by the sides of the primary triangles a secondary triangulation is next established, extending along thlo: coast and over the smaller bays and sounds, and determining a large number of points at distances a few miles apart for the use of the topographical and hydrographica.l surveys. 'l'l1e distances between the points thus determined, as given in the tables, are liable to au average error of about one foot in six miles, until a fin3.l adjustment between the base lines shall have been made. ln some parts of ti.Jc survey the base lines for the primary triangulations have not yet been measured,

or the connexion between the secondary and primary triangulation has not yet heen maclc; in which cnse:i the distances clcpcncl on preliminary base lines, measured with great care, arnl they arc liable to an average error of one foot in three miles. As, on the completion of the primary or main triangulation in each Rection, the eeveral series form ·me connected chain, the different bases afford verifications of each other and of the triangulation connecting them. 'l'he first four sections are thus connected; the last section and part of the fifth, however, only in a preliminary way. Observations for latitude and azimuth are made at a number of stations of the primary triangulation in each section. The differences of latitude, longitude, and azimuth between these and other stations are then computed, under the supposition that the earth is a spheroid of revolution of the following dimensions, which arc these dctei·mincd by Bessel from the reliable mea&uremeuts made at the time, viz: Equatorial radius=6377397.16 metres. Polar radius =6356078.96 metres. Eccentricity = 0.08169683. It has been found that the differences of latitude and longitu<le, as computed in this manner, from the distance and azimuth between two stations, and which arc called geodetic, differ from those which arc obtained by astronomical observations at the several stations by quantities which are greater than the errol'S of the observation5. Such disagreements are due to local irregularities in the figure and density of the e1trth, and the error resulting from them in the determinations of latitude and of the rneriilian plane is Je~ignated as station error. It amounts, according to the remlts obtained at present, to between oue and four secnndK of arc in the eastern section of the survey, am1 to about one second anJ a half in the sections south of the Delaware. In order to eliminate the influence of station errors on the general result, observations arc made at a number of stations, the results are referred to a central station by means of the geodetic differences, and the mean of all is used for the computation of the positions gh·en in the tables. The geographical positions mn:it therefore be considered as liable to future changes from the accumulation of new observations and from the final discussion of all the results obtained. The dijf'crcnce.J ef longitude are ol·tained, as has been stated, by computation from the distances, latitude~, and azimuths of the triangulati<>D. 111 adding up the differences from station to station, an accumulation of the incident>il errors is probable. '!'hey are checked, however, by differences of longitude, determined by means of the electro-magnetic telegraph in every section where the introduction of the latter makes it practicable. 8eaton station, in Washington city, has been selected as the centre for the telegraphic differences of longitude. The sections at present connected by telegraph are Sections I, II, III, IV, V, VII, and VIII. 'l'he first three being also connected by primary triangulation, the check on the geodetic differences of longitude is here obtained, and the agreement is very close. The longitudes from Greenwich in the first five sections depend directly, and in other sections indirectly, upon that of Cambridge observatory, as determined by chronometric differences between Liverpool and Cambridge, and by occnltations, eclipses, and moon culminations observed at various observatories in the United States, and referred to Cambridge by means of telegraphic differences. 1'he longitude of Cambridge, Harvard observatory, as adopted iu former reports, tsince 1851,) viz: 41<. 44m. 29.5"'., or 71 o 07 1 2~.50 11 , is, for uniformity's sake, still retained. }-,rom later discussions it would Beem to bear an increase of about three·quarters·of a second of time. 'l'he longitude in Section X iis reckoned from Greenwich. It depends on moon culminations observed at San Diego, Point Conception, Point Pinos, Presidio, Telegraph Hill, Port Orford, Cape Disappointment, and Cape }'lattery, compared with corresponding obllervation:1 at Greenwich and American observatol'ies, and on chronometric differences betweet1 the same and other stations. In 8ection X the longitude of Presidio observatory, San Francisco, has been adopted-122° 26' 15.0".
EXPLANA'l'ION OF THE TABLES.

The first column on the left contains the name of the several stations or tL·iangulation points. 'l'heh general locality is indicated by the heading at the top of the page, by m~ans of which they may be readil.} found on the sketches accompanying the tables. Sub-headings in the first column indicate the locality more minutely where it it1 practicable.

REPORT OF THE

S~PERINTENDENT

OF

The stations are generally either prominent objects of permanence, such as spires, light-houses, beacons, &c., or they are points on prominent hillil, capes, and points of land, where signals have been erected for the purposl'B of the survey, and which are marked on the ground. In a small number of cases in the first three sections, but much more frequently in the southern sections, where settlements on the coast are sparse and few permanent objects are to be found, the stations have no other distinguishing mark tlian the signal erected on the spot, anrl, after its decay, the mark left in the ground to designate the station point. The latter generally consists of posts or stone~ set around the point, while the centre of the station is designated by an earthen cone or glass bottle buried under the surface of the ground, and marked on the top by a stone or post. "'here the station is on a rock, a copper bolt, or hole fillC'd with lead or sulphur, will be found to designate the exact spot. 'I'he sketches showing the configuration of the lancl, as well as the relative positions of the stations, no great difficulty will be experienced in finding the latter when desired for local surveys or reference. In any case where minute descriptions of particular points arc reqnirccl, they can be had by application addressed to the Coast Surny office. The s"conrl arnl third columns contain the latitudes aud fongitndes of the stations named. 'l'he fourth column contains the azimuth of the line joining the station named in tl1e first column with that named in the fifth; that is to say, the augle which that line makes with the meridian of the former station, reckoned from south around by west through the whole circle. The sixth column giveH the back azimuth of the same line, or the angle which it makes with the meridian of the latter station, reckoned as before; the difference between the azimuths in the fourth and those in the sixth column being 1800, less the inclination of the meridians at the two stations. The seventh, eighth, and ninth columns give the distances in metres, yards, and miles between the etations named in the first and fifth columns. The relation of the metre to the yard used in obtaining these results is: 1 metre=l.0935696 yards, or 39.368.505 United States standard inches. For each station the azimuths and distances to two other stations are given. In every case the lines so given have actually Leen observed. In each section the stations of the primary triangulation are distinguished by being printed in SMALL
CAPITALS.

which exprPl"sions have already l1en1 U:<(!tl in the pr<· ceding part. A strict treatment of tlw di,.;turbancci' of either the dip or total force wonlc1 req11ire the formation of the diflh·ence of each observation of the ve1·tical and lwrizo11tal force from it,; normal value, (corre:'lponcling to the hour, month, and year,) the conversion of' these difli.>rences from unitB of scale value iuto part~ of the reeprctive force, and, finally, thn numerical combination of the contcmporaneou~ values of the two instruml'ut", by means d the above formul~. To treat over 44,000 ob,;ervlltions in this manner it' impracticalily l:1horious. and mnkes it desirable to sub~titute in its place anorher proce~f' less cnrnbrouF, but, as re;;-ards reiiults, equally effPct.ive. The methDd adopted avoid11 al:-o the labor of forming 11ormals, a11d es1wrially that of sPpamting the disturbances anew for each elem<'nt. The method pursued in the discussion of the 'l'ornnto oli~ervations answer all purposes, and Las been adopted for the l'hiladelphia scTies. A more di~tinct idea, bowe\·er, is here given for the limiting value, beyond which disturbances are recognized. The method is a:< follows: Returning to the manuscript tables which contain the observations reduced to a uniform temperature and corrected for progressive chauge, as far tlii" was p:·acticnble, each ob:lervation marked thr~re aR a rli8turbancethat is, which differed as much or more than ± :rn scale dfrisions from the normal of the vertical force, ancl as much or more than ±33 from the normal of the hor:zontal force-was tnrnscribed, and at once corn·erted into its equivalent in parts of the force to \vhich it respectively belonged. 0110 "-l'ah: division of the vertical force magnetometer equal8 0.000033 parts, and of the horizontal force magnetometpr O.OOO<·:Jti5 parts, of the ree11ective force. 'l'l1ese disturbances of the two compo11ent8 were tabulatPd in chronc>logical order; and when for any entry but one of the constituent parts appeared disturbed, the corresponding difference from the normal of the contemporaneous second part, whatever amount that, might be, was likewise entered in an The corresponding values of ..:JO and JS" were then easily computed for each disturbance, 'P whether it occurred in both components or in one ouly. Trustworthy contemporaneous readings of tlie t>vo magnetometers commence with February, 1841, and continues to the close of tbe st·ries, in June, IS-!5. 'l'he1·e is, however, an interval of time betweP11 the readings of tbe instruments, which we arc obliged to disregard-it amounts to but fi l'e minutes-the bifilar magnetometer having been rend so much later. As there is not generally a contemporaneo11s disturbance in the vertical and horizontal fo!'C(', the total number of disturbed values obtained by the procesf' exphdned above and employed is necessarily much greater than it was fc,r either of the components. It becomes, therefore, necessary to fix upon some limit of recognition for a disturbed value of the dip 1md also of the total force. This is best done by the adoption of that value which will separate an equal proportion of disturbi?'d values from the total number, as was done in the components. For the vertical component, one in eve1-y 10.5 observatinns; fm· thf' horizontal component, one in every 19.3 observations, wa8 separated aR a distm·bed value between Fcbrua1-y l, 1841, and June 30, 1845; on the average, therefore, one in every 1.5 observatious should be separated in the dip and total foTce adjoining column.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

~"riL·i4. During the time mentimwd thi> nmnbm· of nhsr,rvations of vertical force was 22,092, and of horizontal force 22,150, from which we 8hould accordingly derive nea:ly 1,470 distmbancl'S. Now the number of

computed values of J/I and of

Je~

it< 2,362: hence, marking iu each set the 1,470 highest values, the limit

'f

of ±1.'l i~ reached in t1ie dip and ±0.00091 in t11e total force, which constitute the limiting values at and beyond which di:<turbance" are recognized in each element. To rrnder the series of dioturbance remits homogeneous, thP di,tu. bancl·S at the odd hour" ai'tpr October, 18:!:;, have been omir.ted. At Toronto the limit for the recognition of disturbances in the dip* was 1. 10, aud in tho total force 0.0004, partti of the force.

Tim columns containing the number of disturbances are headed with the ldter n. \Yhen ratio:i are given, they exhibit the prnportion of the amount of disturbances during any giv,;n sub-period to the average amount of disturbance,; during the whole }'el'iod. In the first and three subsequent tables the valued for the first five months of 1841 are omitted, as there arc no adequate means of cxtt·11ding the serie~ lwyon<l four full ypars.

The ratios of the increasing distm·bances of the force have a double progression, as have also those of thH ilecreasing disturbances, though not so well marker!. Increasing rlisturh:wees .-bow a principal maximum in January, a principal minimum in J uue, and a secondary maximum and minimum in August and N ovcmbcr, respectively. Decrca:;ing disturbances show a pl"incipal maximum in January. a principal minimum in October, and a secondary maximum and minimum in September and l'tlay, respectively. It appears, the1·efore, that, upon the whole, we observe the same laws as at 'l'ornnto, viz: the disturbances increasing the force and tl1osc decrcasi11g the force follow the same progressive monthly change, and exhibit maximum values about the equinoxes and minimum values about the solstices.

In tlie years 1842-' 43, however, decreasing disturbances were in excess over increasiug ones; and at Toronto, between 1844 and 1848, the general effect of the larger disturbances of the force was to decrease the total magnetic force more than to increase it. 'l'he exce8~ in the different yr>ars appears to be rather irregular. The following tables exhibit the diurnal inequality of the difturbances. The whole 8eries, beginning with February, 1841, is employed. The sums, numbe1·s, and ratios given apply to an epoch 20 miuutes later than indicated by the tttbles .

The hourly disturbances exhibit a regular double progression, with a principal maximum at 2 a. m. and principal minimum at 8 p. m.; also a secondary maximum about 2 p. m. and a secondary minimum about 10 a. m. At Toronto these hours were, respectively, 3 a. m., 11 a. m., and 5 p. m., 9 p. m., showing an exchange of the hours of the principal and secondary minimum. 'l'hc disturbance at the hour of maximum is about eleven times greater than at the minimum hour; whereas this proportion is but one and a half to one at Philadelphia.

The ratios of the increasing and decreasing disturbances appear to follow the same law-that is, the values at any hour appear to be complementary to one another, a high 1ilus value corresponding to a low minus value. The Jlhenomenon is, however, not so distinctly brought out as from the longer series at Toronto. The last two columns contain the differences of the sums at each hour, and the average effect of the larger distmbanccs -0f the total force. From 1 p. m. to 1 a. m. the larger disturbances augment the total force; from 1 a. m. to 1 p. m. they diminish it. Greatest augmentation at 2 p. m.; greatest diminution at 4 a. m. The greatest augmentation is nearly twice as great as the greatest diminution; whereas, at 'l'oronto the opposite effect was observed. The clistribution of the disturbances of the total force according to their magnitucle, for an eq_ual increase of .00090 parts of the force, is as follows:

These values are represented by the formula, .1,=0.'35 sin (0+253° 38')+0.'10 sin (20+328° 39'), the angle 0 counting from Janrnuy 1. This formula gives a change of sigu for the middle of .April and the middle of October, or about 25 days after tl1e er1uinoxes. Analysis

ef the solar-diurnal i·ariati011. ef tlte

dip.

The solar-diurnal variation has also been expressed by Bessel's periodic function for each month, summer, winter, anil year. The augle 0 co1mts from midnight, at the rate of 15° an l1om; a positive sign indicates increase of north dip; a negative sign the reverse. The expressions are derived directly from Table IV. Diagram B exhibits the observed and computed diurnal variation for the summer months, and diagram C for tl1e winter months. Diagram D exhibits the diurnal variation of the dip for summer, winter, and the whole year. The g.;ncral clmracter of the three eurves (diagrnm D) is the same; the annual _!lnrve has its greatest value about 11 a. m., and its least value about 5 a. m., with a range of about 1.'2. In summer the epochs occur a little earlier, with a rirnge of a1out 1. 15; in winter the epochs are a little later, and the range is contracted to about l.'O. There is also a secondary maximum between 1 and 2 a. m., with a less regular secondary minimum occurring at some hour in the afternoon, or early in the night. In summer, however, these minima appear interchanged. The Toronto curves are similar to those shown on diagram D. The shifting of the epochs is the same as at Philadelphia. 'l'he morning minimum is less prominent, and the afternoon minimum constitutes the principal minimum during summer, and also, on the average, during the year. The total annual range is almoet exactly the same at tlie two places, and the times of the principal maxima also nearly coincide. 'l'he following table contains the computed times of the principal maximum and of the morning minimum; also the elapsed time, together with the amount and range for Emch month and BfJason; alt10 the times, and amount, and range of the afternoon or .early night minimum, taken from the diagrams:

These taLular ciuantities are exhibited in diagram E, which closely resembles diagram B, Part VIII, of the vertical force. The hours of no semi-annual change are 6 a. m. and 7 p. m. 'l'he greatest changes take place about 2 a. m. and 4 p. m., with a range of .000370 and .000328 parts of the force, respectively. 'l'he turning epochs are found from the variations at the hours 6 a. m. and 7 p. m. The following numbers are the differences from the respective annual means. For 20lt. the sign has been changed.

tlie solar-diurnal ·variation qf tlte total force.

The solar-diunml variation of tlie total force has also been expressed by Bessel's periodic function. 0 is counted from midnight, at the rate of 15° an hour; a positive sign indicates iucreatle of tota.l force; a negative sign the reverse. 'l'hc coefficients arc expressed in parts of the force. The formulae am deduced directly from Table VIII. Diagram .F exhibits the obsnrved and computed diurnal varhtion for the summer montl1~, and diagram G for the winter months. Diagram H exhibit8 the diurnal Yariation of the total force for summer, winter, and 1he whole year. 'l'he diurnal curve is single-crested in summer, and, on the average, during the year; but in winter it assumed a double-crested form, haYing a secondary maximum between 2 and 3 a. m., and a second:uy minimum about 6 a. m. 'l'he principal maximum in summer occurs about 2 p. m., and iu winter about one and a half hour earlier. 'l'he principal minimum in summer occurs about 10 p. m.; in. winter a Lout two hours earlier. Tlrn summer rangP is about 0.0009 am1 the winter range about 0.0004' part:; of the force. The following table contains the computed times of the principal maximum and minimum, together with the elapsed time, amount, a11d rauge of variation in force for each month and season; also the time and amount of range of the early morning secondary wave, as taken from the diagrams:

REPORT OF 'IRE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The amount and range are expressed in parts of the force. The time of the principal maximum and minimum is computed to the nearest minute or two. The diurnal range is greatest during summer, and least during winter. The small secondary inflexion obtains only during the winter months. Its range is only about the seventieth part of the larger annual range. 'Table XI contains the principal morning and afternoon epoch of the normal value of the total force. The morning epoch is taken from the diagrams ; the afternoon epoch i.i computed.

.Annual inequality r!f the dip and total force.
Tlie differences of the monthly normals, expressed in parts of the horizontal force, have been taken from Table XII of Part V. The mean of the October and December values, however, has been substituted for the November value, which produced a correction of + 0.00004 to each monthly value to balance the annual sum. The approximate values of the annu11l iner1uality of the vertical force are extracted from Part VIII, after converting the scale divisions into parts of the vertical force. 'l'able XII contains the values of the annual inequality for the horizontal and vertical components, and, by combination, those of the dip and total force.

TIIE UNITED ST.A.TES CO.A.ST SURVEY.

· From what has been said of the annual inequality of the horizontal and vertical force, it could not be expected that this inequality should appear in any decided manner in the dip aml total force. With reference to the dip, all that can be concluded is that the inequality, proba1ly, does not exceed lmlf a miuute. At Toronto, wl1ere the dip is greater, it is between 0.'8 arnl 0.'9; lower in June and July than in January and December; range, 1. 1 7. 1Yith respect to the total force, the inequality seems to be nbout 0.000:3 parts of the force, which gives nearly the same range as that found at Toronto, with this difference, however, tlrnt at Philadelphia the force is greater in the summer months and less in the winter montl1s, the reverse of wl1at has been found at the other stations. The next and last part of the discussion of the Girard College mngnctic obscrrntions will contain tLe absolute values of the magnetic declination, dip, arnl intensity.

Results and discussion

ef the observations fiJr magnetic inclination tal·cn. at Girard CoTlegc, Pltiludelphia,
in 1842, 1543, anrl lSH.

The dip circle was made by Robinson, of London, in 183G, and is 8ix inchPs in diameter.* The needles used are Jl<o. 1 and No. 2, and the poles wcTe reversed in each set of observations. 'l'he ends of the needles are marked A rmd B. The instrument was mounted upon a marble pier about 20 feet to the southea8t of the observatory. The observations for dip were made once each wt:ek, and were commenced in January, 1842; they terminated in July, 1844. There arc some interruptions, however, in the series of observations, as will be noticed in looking over the results of Table No. L This table contains an abstract of the rernlt8 taken directly from the record. It has also been compflred with the synopsis of the resultmg dips in volume III of the recnrd. The time is observatory mean time, conntcd, for convenience, from Olt. to 241/,. .Each mean result consists of twenty-four separate measures, with face of instrument west an<l east, mttrkcd side nf the needle west and ettst, and with polat·ity north and south. Three i·cadinga have been taken in each position of face of the needle. '\Vi th but a few excPptions, needle No. 1 was employed throughout the series. In the exceptional cases, where needle No. 2 or one of the Lloyd needles No. 1 or No. 3 w0re used, special corrections to refer their indications to the result by needle No. 1 have been deduced and applied.
~It is the same instrument with which I made the obseiTalions at stations in Europe, (Amor. Phil. Trans., vol. YII, part l, 1840,) and those in the magnetic survey of Pmmsykania in 1840 and 1841, and at other stali01rn fnrtLe1· northward and eastward in 184.3.

The precedin~ results indicate an .annual diminution of the dip of 1.'2. To complete the dip for the year 1843, the values for .T anuary, February, and March have been interpolated, by taking the meaus of 1842 and 1843 of these months, respectively. The interpolated dips are 71° 56.'9, 58.'9, and 5!).'0. We have the final values :

It is desirable, however, to extend the investigation of the annual effect of the secular change of the dip beyond the years above stated. In the Coast Survey report for 1856,· A1:1sistant Schott discussed the secular change of the dip at various places, and finds that the middle of the year 1842 ( 1842. 7 ::!:: 0.7 years) was an epoch of minimum dip for places between Cambridge, Massachusetts, Toronto, Canada, and Washington, District of Columbia. The expression for the secular change for Philadelphia (page 241 of the 1856 report) is derived from 19 observations, contracted to 8 normals, between 1834 and 1855. 'l'he dips extracted from a manuscript paper on my magnetic surveys in various parts of th.i northeastern States during the years 1834-'35, 1840, 1841, and 1843 are as follows: Observed dip at Philadelphia:

The annual irregularity in the dip need not be considered, as the index error of the various needles and the observing errors are much greater than the maximum amount of that irregularity, which, according to tho Toronto observations, hardly exceeds ± 11· Collecting the mean dips and mean epoch, and adopting the expression0=01 +x+y(t-t0 )+ z(t-t0 )z, where, 8=reeulting dip at any time between 1830 and 1860; 81=assumed dip at epoch, x its correction, 01=72° 00;

APPE:NDIX No. 19.
RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE UNITED STATES BY PROFESSOR J. N. NICOLLET BETWEEN 1832 AND 1836.-COMMUNICATED BY A. D. BACHE, LL.D., PRESIDENT NATIONAL ACADE)iY OF SCIENCES, SUPERINTENDENT UNITED STATES COA'ST SURVEY.-MAY, 1864.

An examination of an unpublished manuscript of certain magnetic observations, made principally in the interior of the United States by the late Professor J. N. Nicollet, about the epoch 1834, led me to the conclusion that a discussion and publication of the results of these observations might prove advantageous to science. The manuscript is incomplete, as it contains but a small portion of the record, but a summary of most of the crude results, as immediately resulting from the observations, is preserved in Mr. Nicollet's handwriting. Owing to the incompleteness of the record and the imperfection of the instrumental means at that period, the results can claim but a small amount of accuracy. Still, it was thought that their comparatively early date, and the absence of any other and better observations at some of the stations even at the present day, would, nevertheless, attach to them some value, especially in investigations of the secular change of the magnetic elements.

!.-Horizontal force.
The following table contains the ti~es of 300 vibrations, with five needles, for relative horizontal intensity. At four stations only we have a record of the temperature, which, however, proved insufficient to deduce any corrections for changes of temperature. The observations at each of the four stations are very consistent among themselves. The results by a sixth needle (No. 12) were rejected by Mr. Nicollet, the irregular results justifying their rejectioa.

The two values in brackets were interpolated as follows: For needle No. 11 the mean of the four needles Nos. 1, 2, 13, and 14 was taken, and the result by No. 11 compared with it for each station. The mean difference was thus obtained, and applied to the mean of the other needles at Nash ville. l!'or needle No. 14 the mean of Nos. 1, 2, 11, and 13 was compared with No. 14, and the correction for St. Louis applied accordingly. The next table contains the time T of one vibration and the values of ;,2 , which are proportional to X, the horizontal force. ·By means of this column we obtain an approximate value for the loss of magnetism of the needles, which appears to have been considerable. Taking the differences for the two epochs at St. Louis, Athens, Mobile, and Natchez, we find a loss for 61 months of 0.016154, and for one month of 0.000265. The next columns contain the difference, in months, from the adopted epoch, July, 1834, the correction for loss of magneti8m, and the corrected values

To introdnee the horizontal force in absolute value we have X for Baltimore, St. Louis, and Mobile, as follows:

Baltimore, (Coast Survey rep.ort for 1861, Appendix No. 22, page 247 :) The mean of the first three values or X = 4.2 55 ; the valne of X changes but little in seven years. · St. Louis, (reference as above:) The first value or X= 4.705 is adopted; X changes but little in four years.

Mobile, (Coast Survey repo1·t for 1858, page l!J2 :) X in 1857=6.143; hence, in 1834, 6.214, assuming au annual <liminntion of 0.0005 parts of the force. Introducing thcs(' value,.;, we can fOTm three column~ of 1·e~nlts, the mean of which has Leen adopted as an approximation to the horizontal force, ex1ne~sed in grnim' and feet.

2.-Inclhwtion. The records of the observations are preserved for two stations only, yjz: St. Loui~ and St. Peter. At St. Louis the method by vibrations in t.he meridian, and at right anglPs to jt, was employed. This method originated with Laplace, was te8ted by General Sabine iu 1821, al~o hy Rumker ancl Quetdet; but it appears to have bei:n abandoned since, owing to the impcrfoeti1>n of the results whr·n compared with those obtained by means of a dip circle. It should be renrnrked tl1at the method applies more }Jroperly to Rmal dips. Let m=the time of a vibration of a horizontal needle in the meridian; J>=the time of a vibmtion

At St. Louie, by the first method, the inclination was 18° 411 ; by the second method, 19° 04'. At St. Peter the second method alone was used. As to the method n~ed at the stationR given in the general table of results there is no information. The dip, liowever, as given, is largely affected with index: error. I have endeavored to determine an approximate value, at least, of this error, as, without this correction, the results would be of no value. l!'or St. Louis the following observations are on record:

which observations can lie expressed by 1=69° 23'-3.'6(t-1839.8). Three results by Nicollet for t11e mean epoch, 1836.0, give nc OO'; by the formula we find 69° 37'; hence co~ection, -1° 23'. At ~atchitoches l\fajor Graham observed, in 1840. (Sill .·Tour. IV, 1847,) 61° 15.'9; and assuming an annual rate of change of - 2', the result referred to the date of Nicollet's ohse1·vation, 1834.3, would be 61° 27 1 ; by Nicollet, 64. 0 01 1 ; hence correction, -2° 34'. At Mobile Mr. Goodfellow, of the United States Coast Survey, found 60~ 51' in 1857, which, when referred to 1834.5, would probably be 61° 36'; Nicollet has 63° 28'; hence corr~ction, -1° fi2'. At New Orleans Mr. Dean, of the United States Coast Survey, found 59° 46.'5 in 18h8, which, when referred to 1834.3, would proba.Oly be 60° 34'; Nicollet has 62° 05'; hence correction, -1° 31'. The mean of these four corrections, or -1° 50', has provi~ionally been applied to the observed dips. 27 c s

Possibly hereafter, when the secular change of the dip is better understood, a more perfect correction can be made out. The tabular results arc only rough approximation. The manuscript record, nevertheless, indicates that the observations were made with great care, subject only to a large index error.

NEW YoRK, June 15, 1864.
DEAR SIR: Your instructions, dated November 24, 18G2, authorized me to obtain information in rC'gard to the location and working condition of the telegraph liues between \.Vm·hi11gton city ancl San "FrauciHco· California, and more particuliuly the overland Pacific line~; the view being to a~r,ertain th<, best plan for exchanging time and star signals by telegraph for the establi8hment of t.hc rliffPrence nf lrmgituile lwt.wer.n

those two places. I was furtl1er authorized to. obtain the requisite instruments and teleg1·aph apparatus, and proceed to tlrn CoaBt Survey Office at W aE<hington, and there make ~uch experiments with "relay magnets," generally known as "telegraph repl'ater;;," as might be deemed expedient for the succcs~ful execution of the proposed telegraphic longitude operations. In executing that portion of your instructions rc:lating to the location and working condition of the several lines, I obtained much valuable information by corre,pondcncc with .J. H. Wade, ef\q., pre~ident of the Pacific Tclegrapl1 Company; Uolonel Anson Stagel', general superintendent United States military telegraph lines; General Marshall J,efferts, engineer for the American Teleg:raph Company, and s.everal other gentlemen, who possess much pradical knowledge relating to tdegrnph matters. 'l'hese inquiries were further extended by person.al inspection of some of the principal telegraph station~ at the west, aml for tbis purpose I visited the cities of Cleveland, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Chicago cluring the month of May, 1863. Tl1ose facts thus collected wliich have a direct beariug upon tl1e exr>cntinn nf the propmir>d longitude· operations were presented in a brief report submitted to you in Se11tembDr last. I now have the honor to report tlw rneults of my experiments for determining the "eduction time" of electro-magnets of various forms of construction. It may be proper to explain mol'e definitely the sense in which I here use the expression "eduction time." In every chronographic record which may be made through an electro-magnet, a cert.tin interval of time, however sm11ll, must elapse between the instant that a signal is made and that of its record upon the fillet or chrouographic paper. 'l'he Coast Survey tel1·grn1ihic experiments for differences of longitude have been chiefly made through electro·magncts in a c1o8ed circuit; Cl)nsequently the signals ha.vc been made b_y l1rcaking the galvanic circuit, at which inst.ant. tbe irnluced nrngneti~m of the electro-magnet becomes suddenly diminished, until its at.tractive power i~ oYercome by the tension of the armature sp1·ing, thereby transmitting the signal to the chronogrnphic paper. In case the open circuit is used, which in a fpw iuetauces has been adopted, of course the operation becomes reversed; in other words, the "induction time" would be tl1e interval between the closing of the circuit and the instant that the induced magneti;:m of the coils became sufficiently strong to overcome the tension of the armature spring. In conducting telegraphic experiments, ovcria.nd, for aecertaining differences of lone;itnde, the closed circuit appears to have several advantages over the open circuit. All the experiments whid1 1 am about to describe have been made in the closed circuit. In completing the arrangements for making tl1ese interesting and delicate experiments, the idea occurred to me that either the induction or eduction time could be mea8mecl mnre accuratt'ly by means of the chronographic method, with tu:o break circ·rits in the astrnnomical clock, than by any other. This apparatus wa>1 accordingly constructed under my direction by one of the mechanieians at tlie Coast Survey Office, Mr. Hunt. A detailed description of the single-break circnit is given in your report for the year 185G, Appendix: No. 21. It consists essentially of a delicate platinum tilt-hammer pivoted on one insulated brass plate, whHe its head rests upon another, the two plates being connected with the opposite pules of the battery. 1Vhen the pendulum at each oscillation reaches tlie vertical, a projecting pin in its centre trips tlm hammer, thus breaking the circuit and causing a record. To make the double-break, an additional tilt-hammer was added, constructed in an analogous manner, but so adjusted that it was touched by the pin and tripped at the kig1tcst point of the oscillation of the pendulum. · Sketch No. 39 sufficiently explains these various parts: C is tlie insulating bar of ivory; f 1 the brass plate upon which is pivoted the tilt-hammer, a; .f the brass plate upon which the head of the tilt rest::i; A, A 1 , are binding posts connecting the brass plates in the circuit.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The second break-circuit is attached to the lower part of the insulating bar, C ; g 1 is the brass pfate to which the second tilt-hammer, z, h', is pivoted, and g is the one upon which its head, [;, rests; B and B 1 are the binding posts connecting these plates in the second circuit; 7t is a screw for adjusting the position of the tilt, b h1. The clock was adjusted to sidereal time, and its daily rate did not exceed a second. The method pursued in determining the eduction time of electro-magnets was as follows: The difference of time between the two clock-breaks at every alternate seco11d wa~ first ascertained by crmnectiug the two break-circuits, a and b, iu the same galvanic circuit, in which aho were connect.ml a chronograph and a :first-class fillet register. The signal,; thus m;id11 hy the clock, one bring at the centre of each oscillation, tlrn otlier at tlie highest poi11t of every alternate oscillation, were recorded by the clHonngmph and fillet registers. The record of theRe clock-signals was continued about one minute, wliich gave thirty comparisons of the diffe1·enee of time between the two signals. This difference was found to be between forty-seven and forty-eight hundredths of a second. It is propc1· here to remark that in recording the clock signals a second of time was represcntecl upon the fillet paper by a line about two inches in length, while upon the chronogrnph paper it was indicated by a space a little lees t11an half an inch long; hence the greater accuracy in measuri11g the fractional parts of the second upon the fillet paper induced me to rely chiefly upon that record. 'l'he comparison of the two clock-breaks having been made, a relay-magnet (Sketch Xo. 66) was connected in the clock-circuit, B, JV, while the break-circuit apparatus, A, Al, remained in the direct circuit with the chronograph register. It will be observed that all the clock signals made through the tilt-hammer a arc immediatdy recorded Ly the chronograph, while those made by the tilt-hammer b are transmitt.ed through the relay-magnet before they can be recorded by the chronograph. A comparison of the signals tlms recorded with those previously made when both clock signal" were transmitted through the same circuit enables us to obtain the erlu1:tion tirrte of the relay magnet in the clock-circnit, B, B 1· In practical tefographing, when a relay-magnet is connected in what is usually designated the main drr:uit for the purpose of tra11smitting signal;; to a second main circ1tit by means of a smaller magnet, which is adjuRted in a local or short circuit, the two magnets thus connecteil and used together are called a "repeater," from the fact that this particular arrangement of the magnets in the main and local circuits causes every signal to be promptly rrpeated or transmitted from one main circuit to another at those places where, in the earlier days of telegraphing, a person was required to perform this labor. In the sketch, M is the main relay-magnet, and L the local magnet. With these two magnets signals can be transmitted only in one direction; hence, for the convenience of sending signals in either direction, a relay-magnet is required in eack of the two main circuits, which in turn must be connected with its smaller magnet in a local circuit. The sketch represents repeaters arranged for transmitting signals in either direction. The eduction time of a single relay-magnet was first Cletermined, then a single repeater was connected in the clock circuit, .B, B 1, after which a second repeater was added, then a third, and finally a fourth. 'l'hus we were enabled to determine the total eduction time of four_ repeaters and one i·elay-magnet, and at the same time to ascertain the eductirm time of each particular repeater. The recapitulation nf the results thus obtained is presented in the accompanying table, No. 1; each result is the mean of ten comparisons as recorded upon the fillet paper. From a ca~ual inspection of these results it will be observed that the retardation or loss of time in the transmission of signals through a telegraph repeater will vary according to the construction and aCljustmeut of each particular instrument. In the repeaters designated as No. 1 and No. 2 in Table No. 1, each main relay was three inches in length, and upon each spool (two of which form the main helix) were twenty-three coils of No. 30 silk insulated copper wire, the entire length of which was about 2,200 feet. The local helices were one and a half inch in length, and oue and a fourth in diameter, and each spool contained sixteen coils of No. 22 silk insulated copper wire. The length of the wire upon each local helix was estimated to be between seven and eight hundred feet. In t11e repeaters designated No. 3 and No. 4 in Table No. 1, the main relay was four and a half inches in length, and each spool of the main helix contained thirty coils of No. 35 silk insulated i!l'lpper wire, the length of which was estimated to be 3,600 feet. The local helices were one aud a half inch in length and one inch in diameter. There were fourteen

213

layers of No. 24 silk insulated copper wire upon each spool, and the length of wire iu each helix was estimated to be about eight hundred feet. The diamete1·s of the wires upou the several helices were carefully measured and found to be as follows: Wire No. 22 was 0.031 of an incl1 in c1iarneter. Wire No. 24 was Q.026 of an inch in c1iameter. Wire No. 30 was 0.017 of an inch in cliametm·. Wire Ko. 35 was 0.015 of an inch in diFJmeter. Ou referring to Table No. 1 it will be not.iced tl1at tlw average Nluction time of repeaters No. 1 and No. 2, with a maximum tension of the armature spring, was a little more than onc-Lundrcrlth of a sccornl of time, and with a minimum tension it was four-hundredths of a second; while repeaters No. 3 and No. 4, with a maximum tension, indicated an average rdur:twn time of six-hundredths, and with a minimum ten~ion of twelve-hundredths of a second. 'The re8i:;tance in t.he helices of repeaters No. 3 and No. 4 was found to be considerably grellte1· tlian in those of No. 1 ancl No. 2. This result wa:; expectl:<l from tlH~ cliffercuct: in the size arnl length of wim in the re11pective coils, though the large difference of the eductirm time in the 11everal in~trnm<·nts could only in part be attributed to tl1at cause. 'l'he experiments which wei·e made with a maximum tem·ion of the armature spring clearly indicated that this difference of the cductiov, time was chiefly due tn the difference in the constrnction of the helix cores or soft iron bars. I think these Pxperim1mt~ conclusively demnnstrate the fact which Profe~snr Hr·nry many years ago di~covered, viz: that the gn·ater the length of the helix core the luuger will be the inductioti or eduction time of the electro-magnet, otlier conditiom being the same. Of tliis discovery by Professor Henry I had no knowledge whatever until I had submitted the resultR of a series of experiments to him for the purpose of obtaining his view~ as to the best method for conducting further researches, and I would here express my sincere thanks tD him for the very friendly inteTcst which 011 all occasion8 he exhibited in these experimentE, and for the many suggestions which I recefred from him. Profpssor Heury proposed having the helix cores composed of small well-annealed ineulated iron wire, by which the induction or eduction time would be diminished. 'l'he experiments which I lrnd already completed showed that the cores should have a maximum length consistent with the magnetic power required from each relay coil. I accordingly prepared drawings for the construction of a helix which should be provided with several movable cores made of small iron wire insulated with silk. The instrumcut was rnauufactmed with great care by Mr. E. M. Pierson, telegraph instrument maker, at Cleveland, Ohio, now of Newark, New Jersey. 'l'o Mr. George B. Hicks, of Cleveland. inventor of the "Hicks's tclrgrapli. repeater," I was indebted for valuable aid in superintending the construction of this instrument. For greater convenience in making these experiments the instrument wa~ provided with two movable main helices, each two and three-fourths inches in length m11l 011e and a half inch in diameter. 'l'lie helix, which I lmre designate as No. 1, cousjsted of forty coil8 of No. 30 ~ilk insulated copper wire, divided into three series or sections. The first series was of twelve coih, around a thin paper tube, sufficiently large to admit the different iron cores without diffiClllt.y. Its length upon each spool was 300 feet. The second. se1ies was of twelve coils, immediately around the first, the length being 450 feet. The third was of sixteen coils, around the second, the length G75 feet, thus making the entire leugth of wirn upon each spool 1,425 feet, or 2,850 feet on the two. The object of dividing each coil into series was to determine the minimum length of wire required upon tlie helix to produce the necessary ma.gnetic power in the electro-magnet. 'l'his was satisfactorily done by first using series No. 1, then series one and two, and finally the three series together. The length and diameter of the spools of helix No. 2 were the same as those of No. 1. The first series consisted of fourteen coils of No. 35 silk insulated copper wire around a thin paper tube similar to that used in helix No. 1. The length of wire, in this series, upon each spool wa:< 450 fe<:t. 'rhe second series was of fourteen coils, immediately upon the first, the length of which was 600 feet. The third series consisted of eighteen coils, around the second, the length being 1,110 feet, thus making the entire length of wire upon each spool 2,lGO feet, or 4,3~0 feet on the two. The experiments with this helix were in all respects similar to those made with helix No. 1, and from the results obtained (see Tables Nos. 2 and 3) it appeared that the magnetic po1Ver of the electro-magnet, having twenty-four coils of No. 30 copper wire upon its helix, was about the same as when forty coils were

214

REPORT OF· TIIE SUPERINTENDENT OF

used, thus showing that with the same battery force there was no advantage gained by increasing the number of coils from twenty-four to forty. And since these experiments were made under conditions similar to those which are frequently encountered in practical telegraphing through circuits of two or three hundred miles in length, (at least so far as the same resistance in the conducting wires could make the conditions similar,) I infer that no practical advantage can be obtained by increasing the number of coils upon the telegraph relaymaguet above twenty-five or thirty, unless we increase in a corresponding ratio the size of the iron wi1·e now in general me upon most of the telegraph lines in the United States. I shall ngain have occasion to refer more particularly to this subject before closing this report. With helix No. 2 (see Table Ko. 3) the power of the electro· magnet was found to be considerably less when forty-six coils of No. 36 copper wire were upon the helix than when only twenty-eight were used, the battery being the same in both cases. From a further comparison of the results in these tables it will be observed that the magne_tic power of helix No. 1 was much greater than that of Nll. 2, while a much larger battery was required to overcome tl1e resistance through the .N"o. 35 copper wire with which thP- latter was constructed, thus confirming the opiniun which I have already expressed in regard to the importance of increasing the size of the wire now in general use for telegraph purposes. The iron coreR were conRtrncted in the following manner: Core No. 1 consiRted of two sulid soft iron bars, each thrPe inche~ in length and half an iucli in diameter. Core No. 2 was of the same length and diameter as No. 1, but constructed of well-annealed and insulated iron wire barn, each one-tenth of an inch in diameter. Core No. 3, of similar dimen.;ions as Xo. 1 and No. 2, was constructed of well-annealed iron wire sixhundredtl1s of an inch in diameter, and insulated with ~ilk. Core No. 4 was in all respects similar to No. 3, with !he single exception that the iron wire used was but three-hundredths of an inch in diameter. My first object was to ascertain the relative magnetic power which could be obtained from each of these cores, which I aceomplisltcd in the following manner: The helix com;tructed of the No. 30 wire was adjusted in a vertical position, so as to allow the several iron cores to lie placed consecutively within it while counected in the galvanic circuit. Immediately in contact with the lower surface of the core was placed a soft iron plate similar to that generally used upon the armature of a relay-magnet; this phte was well insulated with silk, and from its centre was suspended a small cup into which mustarcl-seed shot were slowly dropped until the weight became just sufficient to overcome the attractive force of the magnet, and thus !tllow the plate to fall from the surface of the core. The exact weight sustained by each core at each consecutive trial was ascertaine~ with a delicate balance which was obtained at the Coast Survey office for this purpose. Table No. 2 contains a recapitulation of the weights sustained by each core when used in helix. No. 1, and Table No. 3 those sustained by the same cores when used in helix No. 2. From a comparison of these r·'Snlts it will be noticed that the magnetic power of the electro-magnet rapidly dimini~hes as we diminish the diameter of the wire with which the magnet cores may be constructed. In practical telegraph operntions we should expect to encounter many difficulties in attempting to exchange signals upon lines from 200 to 500 miles in length with electro-magnets having so little magnet.ic power as that which was obtained from cores No. 3 and No. 4 under the most favorable conditions. I have no reason to doubt, howe\'er, that core No. 2, adjn;ted in helix No. l, would perform very satisfactorily in a well-insulated circuit of 200 or 300 miles under favorable conditions of the atmosi:here, tmt during sultry, foggy, or rainy weather, core No. 1 would undoubtedly Le found much superior to No. 2. Tables No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6, contain a recapitulation of the results of the relative eduction time of the several cores under similar conditions. It will be noticed that the eduction time of cores No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4, was, upon the average, le811 than one-ltundredth ef a ser:ond of time, while in core No. 1 it varied from one to four hundredths of a second, depending upon the adjnstment of the armature spring. The reason for this large difference between core No. 1 and the others was chiefly due to the diffp,rence of the magnetic power of the several cores as exhibited in Tables No. 2 and No. 3. 'l'he comvaratively small variation of the eduction time in cores No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4, when the armature spring was adjusted first at a maximum and then at a minimum tenRion, must, I think, be attributed to the same cause, thereby permitting but very slight change in this adjustment of the instrument.

.After the foregoing experiments hac1 been completec1, and the results submitted to Professor Henry for l1is inspection, lrn suggested that if a narrow groove were cut lengthwise and to th<~ centre of each b1ir of core No. 1 perhaps the eductiort time would thereby be somewhat dimi11ished. I accordingly carried the suggestion into execution, and the results herewith presented in table No. 7 prove hi~ theoretical deductions to have been well founded. So far as I am informed on this subject, the first experiments undertaken for t11e purpose of measuring the abs()late inrlur:tion or eductiort time of an electrn-magnet by means of a well-regulated clock were made during the winter of 1858 by .AsEistant J.E. Hilgnrd, aided by Assistant Edward Goodfellow. Some two years ago Mr. Hilgard veTy kindly permitted me to look o'er his results, and I have 110 doubt that a comparison between them and those of a similar class herewith presented "ronld show a vcTy close agreement, although the method adopted by ~Ir. Hilgard was somewhat different from that pursued by my~elf. Since these experiments were unr'lertaken for the specific purpose of determining, so far as practicable, the best mode of constructing electl'D-magnet:i intended to be. u;;ed as rnlays for transmitting with the least loss of time signals through long telegraph circuits, I respectfnl1y beg leave to offer a few rnggcstiDns in regard to the construction of telegraph in:ltrumcnts, and the size and quality of iron wire which, in my judgment, is most suitable for telegraph purposes; a subject which has at different times engaged my attention while conducting for several years past the telegraph longitude operation:; of the Coast Survey under your directions. In the construction of telegraph instruments generally, and more particularly of electro-magnets, 110 definite system based upon accurate experiments appears to have been a<loptt~d iu tLe Uuited States having in view the length, size, and quality of 1Le wire circait~ in which sucl1 instnnnent~ were designed to be useJ; consequently we find as many electro-magnets of different forms of construction (of both good and bad qualityJ as there are persons engaged in manufacturing them. So for as I have been able to learn, ea.:h instrument-maker has established certain rules of his own for determining the dimensions ancl form of each particular piece of his instrument; hence, one will construct his relay-magnets with cores tltree inches in length and half an inch in diameter, with twenty-five or thirty coils of No. 35 copper wire upon the helix . .A second makes his cores four inches long, only tl1ree-eiglitfts of an inch in diameter, and with twenty-five coils of No. 30 copper wire rtpo~- the helix, while a third constructs them four and a half inches in length and Jiaif an inch in diameter, witli thirty coils of No. 35 copper wire. These relay-magnets, so entirely different in their construction, arc frequently used indiscriminately in circuits varying from one hundred to five hundred miles, the result of which is that great difficulty is often experienced in exchanging signals between distant stat1ons. It seems to me plain that an electro-magnet having its cores three and a haif h;ches in length andfiueigltths of an inch in diameter, with thirty coils of No. 30 copper wire upon the helix, will perform more satisfactorily in a circuit four or five hundred miles in length than one witb cores three inches in length and but tkree-eigkths of an inch in diameter, and with only twenty coils of .No. 30, or perhaps No. 35, copper.wire upon the helix. It is well known that as the length of the circuit is increased the resistance against the battery current is also greatly increased; hence, to obtain the requisite magnetic power in an electro-magnet which is to be used in a circuit of five hundred miies, we should determine by a complete series of experiments what dimeusions should be given to the iron cores, and what number of coils and what size of copper wire ought to be used upon the helix, to produce a maximum power with a minimum current, in connexion with the least induction and eduction time in the electro-magnets. The results of the recent experiments have led me to the conclusion that a relay instrument baving its iron cores three inches in length and five-eighths of an inch in diameter, with thirty coils of No. 30 copper wire upon its helix, will approximately fulfil these conditions, and with your permiasion I am now having constructed for the Coast Survey four such ini>truments, which are to be used in making future determinations of differences of longitude with the electro-mitgnetic telegraph. It would be expecting too much to suppose that these instruments will at once fully meet all the requirements demanded for the successful execution of the proposed important but difficult longitude operations, and I have no doubt that further experiments will lead to additional modifications and improvements in electro-magnets. In the United States much study has already been given to the subject of insulation of telegraph lines, while the equally important matter of improving the quality and increasiug the size of the iron wire in general use for telegraph purposes has, with a few exceptions, been almost entirely overlooked.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Most of our telegraph lines were originally constmcted with wire known commercially as No. 10, which is 0.14 of au inch in diameter, ancl in :-;ome in~tances No. 11 and ~o. 12 were used, which are i·espectively 0.13 and 0.12 of an inch in diameter. It did not, however, require many years' experience to show that those lines which were constructed of the largest wire possessed several advantages over those in which No. 11 and No. 12 wire were used, aud the result bas been that upon the principal lines No. 8 and No. 9, each respectively 0.16 and 0.15 of an inch in diameter, have been substituted for No. 10 and No. 11. Further than this the improvement of the telegraph lines appears to have made but little progress, and I think t11at I am safe in estimating that at least seven-eighths of our telegraph lines are constructed with No. 8 and No. 9 wire. The exceptional cases are those where a few lines have been constructed with No. 6 iron wire, which is 0.22 of an inch in diameter, through which signals may be exchanged with greater facility than could pos~ibly be done over lines located upon the same routes but constructed of smaller wire. It i8 quite evident that this should be thr1 case, because the resistance in the larger wire iK much less than in the smaller, and where it has been found. otherwise in practice it must have resulted from a less perfect inmlation, or, what is still more probable, from the use of an ieferwr qualit!J ef wire. Of course the quality of the iron used in manufacturing the larger wire should be equally good with that used for the smaller, and certainly not less attention should be given to the annealing process, for unless we attend to both these points we shall make very little improvement by increasing the size of the wire. After much careful i·eflt,dion on the subject I have bePn lerl to the conclusion that if all t11e principal telegraph lines in the U!iited States could be riartially reconstructed by substituting No. 6, or, better still, No. 5 iron wire of the beM quality, it woulcl, in the end, prove highly advantageous to the several companies. This opinion is based upon the following reasom : In those sections where dense fogs prevail for weeks in succession, as near the sea-coast of :~Iaine and the British provinces, California and Oregon upon the Pac.ific coast, and also where it becomes nece.,ssary to constmct lines through swamps or over low, wet prairies, which are frequently encountered in the southern and western States, the lines will, during such times, be envdoped with moisture, thereby greatly impairing the insulation, and thut>. reducing the working condition to a minimum standard. The uaual remedy unG.er such circumstances is an increase of battery power; but when wire no larger than No. 8 or No. 9 is used this is not always successful, from the want of capacity of the wire. On the "other hand, if No. 5 or No. 6 iron wire of the best quality were used, instead of No. 8 or No. 9, the affficnlties to which I have alluded could be successfully overcome in foggy or stormy weather by increasing the batteries, and, under the more favorable conditions, less battery would be required for operating the line. Upon an average the battery power used in operating the various telegraph lines in the United States is equivalent to one Grove cell for every five miles of' wire in the circuit, whereas by increasing the size of the wire from No. 8 to No. 5 or No. 6 I am quite conficl.ent that the amount of battery absolutely required for all practical purposes could be reduced twenty per cent., perhaps more, an item of economy in the operating expenses which would very soon cancel the additional expenditure required for the improved construction. In regard to the advantages or disadvantages of using galvanized iron wire, my opinion is that when annealed iron wire of good quality is properly galvanized it will be both better and more economical for telegraph purposes. In exceptional cases, where it may be found. otherwise, an examination will undoubtedly prove that the wire had been marinfaet1ued from an inferior quality of iron, or, perhaps, damaged by fire or water to such a degree as to have rendered it unsalable until its imperfections were covered by being galvanized.

APPENDIX No. 21.
CO.'\IMCNICATION ON THE TRAJECTORY OF JUCOCHET SHOT :FROM A Hi-INCH HODMAN Gl:N. CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANT U.S. COAST SURVEY. BY
COAST SURVEY OFFICE, Ji<ly 19, 1864. ·on the 1st and 2d of July, 1864, some shells were thrown experimentally along the channel of the Potomac from two 15-inch guns, mounted at Jfatt.cry Hodgers and Fort Foote, in order to ascertain their ranges and other circum~tances at various elevations. 'l'hcse experiments were macle under the immediate direction of General Howe, assi~ted by Major Hamlin. The operations for the determination of the distances were attcnclcd to by myself. At Pach place a base li11e was measured with a steel band, (corrected for temperature,) one end of which was the point of observation for the flight of the shell; the distance of this point from the gun became known by the measure of the angles of the triangle. The distances to some other range objects from the gun were also determined. The angle at the gun between the line of fire (a fixed direction) and the point of observation was measured, as well as the various augles at the latter point, between the gun and the successive impacts of the shot. 'Ihc rnnges, in which these impacts were seen by the observers, clustered for this purpose closely around the central Htake, were marke<l out by stakes in the order in which they occurred, the oh~ervers having previously been numbered for thil" purpose. 'J'he angles were measured afterwards with a theodolite. The ranges of the first impact, and of several following ones, as well as the totitl range, were then computed. Tables were alflo com1rnted for directions, to be marked by stakes intersecting given constant di8tances on the line of fire, for the use of future experiments. The results were also graphically laid down. Thinking that a further development of Poisson's formula to meet the case of a ricochet shot might be

Thus taking a new r1cparture from the point of first impact, tlie preceding formula apply again to trace out the trnjcctory to the eecond impact, an<l simil'<ily for the next and all following bounds, treated as so many indqJcmlent h·vcl ranges. \Y c have, acconlingly, terminal velocity of fir~t bound, 166 yards; initial of the second, 138; hence locs at occond impact, 0.17 parts; terminal velocity of second bound, 128 yards; initial of the third, 103; los5 Ly thinl impact, 0.20 patts; terminal velocity of third bound, 9!> yards ; initial of fourth, 88; loss by fourth impact, 0.11 parts; and the final velocity with which t11e projectile plunges into t11e water, 85 yards a second. The angle of impact and rebound at the second impact is 5° 31', at the third 5° 47', at the fourth 6° 00 1, and at the last or final disappearance G0 10'. Greatest elevation of projectile above surface of water in first bouncl, 12.6 yard~, (which takes place 5 yards beyond the middle point of its lcngtl1;) greatest elevation of second bound, 8.0 yards ; of third, 5.0 yards; and of the last, 4 yards. A ball may, therefore, boun(l over a small vessel sitting low in the'watef, if midway between the first and second impact, or eveu between t11iR and the tliird point of impact. The times of flight of the successive bounds are 3.s08, :-:?.'46, l."93, and 1."72; total, including the first branch of thll curve= 13. 0 21. If the time of each bound was obaervcd, or even that of the total flight, allowance could be made for any possible difference in the angle of irnpnct and r(lbound; should the latter be found smaller, it would be indicated by a shorter flight than the computed one. 'l'he vertices of the successive ricochet bounds arc nearly tangential to a straight line inclined aLou half a dcgl'ce to the horizon.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Herring Gut.-The excellent little harbor of Herring Gut is approached from the sea by three ship channels, the mo8t eastern and least direct of which lies between the Brothers and Mosquito i8land. The obstacles in this approach are all well marked, with the exception of" Gunning Ledge"-a sunken reef of a very dangerous character. The Bhallowest and most seaward portion of this reef lies two hnndreil and thirty metres N. by E. from the northern point of Gunning Rocks, and five hundred and forty metres N.,V. by '\Y. ~ W. from the north point of the West Brother ieland. Five feet, at ordinary low water, covers the portion of this ledge to which I have referrPd, aml its sheltered posit.ion usually protects it from breakers; the kelps, however, betray its whereabout8 at low tidal stages. The sunken hulls of two vessels are said to be still occasionally seen near this reef when the water is low and clear. .A.s ships of the largest class seek a harbor in Herring Gut, I recommend that a buoy be placed, n·ot upon the reef itself, but at a distance of one hundrccl and twenty metres N. by E., where a depth of three fathoms is r<"ached at mean luw water. This point lies upon the line between the north point of the West Brother and the ligl1t-house of Herring Gut, and is nearly on the sailing course. Prom this proposed site for the buoy the light-house will bear N.\V. \V. tl1ree-fift.l1s of a mile di~taut, and the hlack buoy, which now marks a rock on the opposite Ride of this clrnnnel, ~ .1'~ 1E., one-third of a mile distant. In the position I have desc1·ibed, I think a buoy will be an aid as well as a protection to navigation. \Vithin the lrnrbur of Herring Gut there exists a small rock which ought to be m:irli;:ed. It lies on the west side of the anchorage, with the light-house bearing S.~E., (about one-third of a mile distant,) and the wind-mill of South St. George bearing N K It is covered by two feet of water at ordinary low tides, and lms about eight feet on either side of it. The three·fathom line of the lJasin lies within one hundred yards of this object when the tide is out In foggy weather the harbor of Herring Gut is crowcled with vessels of all sizes, and in the effot't to secure berths in the basin they frequeptly strike this rock and lose portions of their keels or shoeing. Four.fore.foots of vesseb, it is said, now lie on bottom near this rock; I did not sec them. This object bears u~ name that l could learn; but I have referred to it in the preamble of this report as Keel Rock. Its proper marking is mu~h desired by the citizens of Sooth St. George. My attention was callt>d to t.he rPf'fa extemli11g into tl1e lmrhor month from the rocky point on which the light-house stands. These rl'efa form a gradually inclined apron with two extending spurs. As the tlll"ec-fathom line approaches everywhere within at leaBt a tl10usa11il foet of the shore, and as the general aspect of the low rocky point indicates a dangerous approac11, I failed to see the impmtance of further marks. Comparatively fow vessels pass tkrouglt Herring Gut, the exit to the westward being obstructed by bars or 8hallow spits at the narrows off Alcxandt:r island, and by a flat sunken rock lying in the channel-way. JY!uscle Ridge Channrl.-This channel is one of the most frequented of the so-called irtlanfl communicativns along the coast of J\Iaine. It li1:s within an in-egular chain of i8lands, and extends from '\Vhite-Head light to Fisherman's islaud, where it opens upon Penobscot bay. Its most direct approach for vessels from ports to the eastward of the bay is by way of the pass between :Fisherman's and Sheep islands; but exag· gerated reports of the daugers of this eutrancc induce many vessels to pursue the more tortuous but more distinctly marked cLanuel under Owl's Head. These dangers consiet of the Grindstone Ledge on the south and Sheep Island ledg<0s on the 11orll1 side of t.he ample channel-way. Grindstone Ledge is an isolated rock, awush at low water of spring tides. In quiet weather the sea does not break npon it even at mean low water, but the kelps which grow upon it reveal its position to the observer. Four fathoms of water may be found in all directions within one huudreil yards of this object, and upon the north side the same depth may be carried within thirty yards. ThiR rock lies about four hundred metres from tbe north shore of l<"'isherman's island, and may be found at any stage of the ticle by the following: fVitli t1te.douhle tree on tlte east end ef Pishermnn' s island bearing S.E.;f E., run ojf" till tlw" Yellow Ledge" is open half way between the aforesaid island and "Marble-Head Rock." As the rock has a surface of Home three hundred square feet, it can scarcely be missed in following these directions. Coasters have the following vague rule for clearing the Grindstone: Keep White-Head light open a hancl-spike's length to westwaril. of Otter island. Of course this rule is of no avail ia t¥k weather. · I respectfully offer the opinion that a buoy near this rock would prove a protection to life and property, not only because it would warn vessels from the dangerous object itself, but also because it would reassure them in their apprehension of the Sheep I~Jand ledges, the fear of which is augmented in foggy weather by the roar of their almost incessant breakers. It is not improbable that the rote of these ledges has often driven vessels too far ove1· to the southward, and stranded them upon the Grindstone. With a buoy upon

the Grindstone, vessels may boldly run down in foggy weather till they make either this object or the bold shore of Fisherman's island, and thns this direct and ample entraucro will lose its prnRent bad name. Sliap 11/antl Ledp's.-By this uame am diKtingnishtd three r,1cky spurs which cxtcud from the uorth side of the entrance. Of these, the middle one ter.minates in a ragged pile of rocks, some six feet of which are exposed above the plane of low water, and this is the opposing danger to the Grind~tone already described. This rocky pile is about three hundred metres from the shore of Sheep island, and very near the three-fathom line of the ship channel. It appears to me that a buoy upon the Grindstone will obviate-the necesHity of the RPveral buoys which the adequate marking of the Sheep hla.nd Ledges would re,p1ire. The chairnel is so ample that, with security upon the sonth, no vessels will be likely to venture over to these ledges, and, as far as I can learn, they have rarely been the immediate cause of disaster. Complaint was made to me by the excellent Captain Sleeper, one of the petitioners whose name appears upon the documents enclosed with my instructions, that there is a rock beyond the "Breakwater Ledge," near Owl's Head cove, wl1ich fi-e<JUently b1·ings u1· com<ting vessels. I examined the spot carefully, though not at low water. The ledge is now marked by a spinille, which is intended to indicate the posltion of this dangerous obstruction at high water. About one hundred feet beyond this spindle the ledge c 4 out again with but six feet upon its summit at very low tides. Captain Sleeper $\rongly urges the necessity of a buoy upon this outer rock. ·with plenty of sea room beyond it, and a very bold shore upon the opposite side of the c11annel, it, would seem but a simple act of carelessness for a vessel to run one hundred feet from a spinrlle. At high water the outer rock has too mnch water upon it to fetch up the ordinary class of vessels seeking an anchorage in the cove; aud at lower stages of the tide the exposed and ragged form of the ledge warns the stranger to keep his distance and to suspect hidden ,dangers. Upon this outer rock ve,;sels have frequently lo~t shoeing and keels. Billings's Led'ge.-This obstacle would scarcely be classed as a dmiger to navigation, except from its proximity to the landings of the town of Eastport. Billings's Ledge i~ a large flat-topped rock, nearly one lmndrcd feet in diameter, which crowns a sandy shoal spot within two hundred yards of Bucknam's Head, (a rocky bluff at the SE. point of the island, upon which Eastport is built.) The shallowest portions of this rock arc scarcely covered at the low w:1ter of spring, and its red color, as well as its eddies, make it conspicuous until the tide is pretty well up. "\Vith the rudest estimate of the dir;tance I have given, it may be found at any etage of the tide by a 8ingle range. Bring the lone tree, on the western portion of Bucknam's Head in contact with the corner of Billings's house, (NW.) This rock, situated almost under the shadow of Bucknarn's Head, and approachable by the lead, must be regarded as an insignificant object of apprehension to the careful helmsman. I, however, recommend that a buoy be placed upon it. The great rise of the tides upon the bold shores in the neighborhood makes a very close approach to many of the rocky headlands a matter of safety and perhaps of convenience. The range of spring tides at Eastport is 21 feet. The time consumed in my examinations was lengthened by the heavy fogs which prevailed. Very respectfully yours, HENRY MITCHF.LL, Assista'/U United States Coast Survey. Professor A. D. BACHE, Superintendent United States Coast S1lrney.
