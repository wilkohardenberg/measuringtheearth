REPORT.
CA111IlRIDGE, l\IAss., December 28. 18G7. SIR: As requimd h,v law, and the regu1ations of tliP TreaR1u;-.- Department, I ha··e tlie lionor to submit my report on the progress of the eoaRt smTey of tlw Cnited StateR during the RUl'H\Ying year, from November 1, ]8uG, to .Soyemher 1, 18(>7.

PART I.
On tl1e 2Gth of February, 1867, I receiYed the commission of SnperintPrnlent of the Coast Survey. This important seryice originatt;d with Ha8sler; but it, re('eiYed its efficient orgauiz;atio11 from l~acl1e. The deep ren~rf'nce of tlw latter Superintemlent for his predecesRor was the m1tural result of his noble and magnanimous character. l{eciproea11y to presen·e his memor.r fresh and iufluentfal as long as the survey may continue is· ~m uct of justice which will lw glacll~- rf'ndered. It is only necessary couscientiousl,Y and faithfull;y to follow in his footsteps, imitate his example, and cfovelOil his plans in the administration of the smTl\\'- To descrihe \Ylrnt tl1e SuperiuteJl(lent should du is simply to tPll what Badie. actually performed. The dutie-s of the Superintendent are thus defined : 1. "The primary triangulation designated in the directicms* on that snltjeeJ:, and the astro11omical and other ollservations connected therewith, will be conducted hy the priucipal of tlie survey, who, as sucl1, will sn1leri11tentl the work in general, and he responsible for its correctness and fidelity." Impressed with the importance of this leading portion of the tield-\"''ork, I was anxious to take the field in accordance with the directions, but the melancholy illness of my predecessor had interfered with the proper lffO\isions for its execution, While, on the one hand, there was no recognition of it in the detailed estimates, and there had not been the sufficient preliminary reconnaissance, there was, on the o~!rnr hand, the necessity for quite a new outfit for the part;r, because the material had been otherwise usefully employed. The smallness of the appropTiation would not hear this additional expense, and the \Vork was reluctantly postponed to another year, when these obstacles may be removed. 2. "Ile will inspect from time to time, personally, the operations of all parties and persons employed on the surw1y, aud will report to the department any neglect or irregular performance of dut,y that may fall under his observation." - The woTk must not be suffered to degeneratA: from its high standard, nor from its present economy. By personal inspection, by unceasing criticism, by temperate and seasonable censm·e, by judicious and generous praise, and by cautious pwmotion for merit, the 11resence of the head must be everywhere reoognized as a dread to the faithless, and as an inspiration to the faithful performance of duty. Accordingly, I took the first opportunity to visit the parties in the field, as will later 'be stated in regard to Section I. I was well satisfied with the i·esults of' the examination, aud shaH strive to extend the inspection to the parfies working in the winter season at tliesouthern sedions. 3. "He will furnish the necessary formulre and methods to the assistants having calculations to make, and will gi.ve all instructions relating to t,he scientific parts of the work.'' The ease with which the survey has kept paoo witl1 tbe progress of art and scien_ce, contributing more than its full share, so that its many processes arc re~arded as the unsurpassed models of their kind, has mostly arisen from the sympathy of my predecessor for all that was uew, and his acute

discriminntion, whicl1 retained the impronmrnnt and r~jected the fallacy. The losR of his strong and co111prelH'n1tiYe jHdg111e11t must J1prn~efortl1 he supplied by concenna.ting upon the RILrVP,Y the wisdom of the bt~st sdeu<·e of the country. The country is aliYe with keen, original thought, -which is reaping: hm·yc;;t:;, buildiug machines, r;ailing r;hips, exploring the earth, aml observing the stars; which sum·r;;; the fetters of uo 1m~jndice, nor tht:> darkness of any mystery; which is opening to the people the doori.: of the uuivN·sit;v and of the academy. "\Yheneyer iuqniry may approach the sm'YP,Y it sl11111lcl always he welcome, from whatever dirnet.ion it may come, whet.her iu tlll' fonn 11f 11cw 1·n1g:gcstiu11, or of Rinccrc and rigid criticism. Some of t11e most abstrmw problenrn of the survey, as the figure of the earth, the theory of the tides, the difll,renee of lonp;itnde bet,Yeen Europe and Arneriea, and the. pl1;rsical cllanges in tile hottoms of the harbors a11d aloug the coast, lllnst be prepared for immediate discm;sion aud final r;olutiou. Steps hiffe alread,y been taken in this direction, of which the rlet ailed account will be giveu in the proper place and time. It is mmeover desirable that the subject of the probable enor of ohscrYations be reconsidered, and that new terms be introduced which Hhall be more appropriate and less likc'1.Y to mislead. It may be ·well in this place to refer to new forms of observation which it. is proposed to adopt. The telegraphi0 dete1·minatio11s ·will simply invoke the comparison of clocks, without insisting upon the s,vstem of star signals. Assistant DaYidson has d(WisPd a new form of tile portable astronomical transit instrument, equally ailapted to observation;;; of tinw in the usual way, aml to those of latHude b,y the method of e<1ual altitudes of stars north ;1ml sont.11 of the zenith, wl1ich higl1l,y commends itself for determinations of geograpl!ieal po:sitimi;..;. The ai.:sistant in charge of the office has developed a ;;;:rntem for tlie measurement of the railroad8 iu co1mection with the survPy, b~- wl1ich ib; distant determinatious will be firmly hound t<ig*'ther. As soou as por;i.;ible the execution of this work will be commenced under l!is immediate Hnperdsion. 4. "Ile will prepare the assignment of duties of the person;;; aml parties employed, an!l submit. the same to the Sccre1'nry of the Treasury for his approbation." This portion of the work ii;; e..ipecially onerous, because every six months all the field-parties must pass from the north to the south, and-the reverse. It requil'es for its judicious execution full consultation with tlie assistant in charge, t.he hydrographic inspector, the disbursing agent, and all the otticens employed. in the field. l'lans for future topographical operations, to he prepared by the principal assistant in topography from personal reconuaissance, will greatly facilitate this assignment of duties. 5. "He will SUJ><-·rvise the publication of the results of the work, and han+-the general superintendmwe of the oflice tn \Vashiugton." The Superintf.'mlent is greatly relieved of the care of the office by the assistant in charge, to whom its immediate custody is a;;;signed; and the ability aml fidelity with whicl1 this fluty is performed by Assistant Hilgard canuot be too highly commended. To enable the officers of the survey to communicate "itll equal case with the office or wiU1 the Superintendent, wherever he may be, the franking privilege is extended to both thef<e officers, for "all letters arn! documents in relation to their public duties." (;, "As soon as may he, lie will make known any results of the survey which ma;r be useful to the public, such as reefs, rocks, or other dangers on .the coast, new channels leading into harbors, &c.!' The notices given under this direction will be referred to in thell: proper sections. 7. "He will report the progress and state of the work to the Treasury Department in the month of November of each year, with the view of the same being laid before the President and Congress." By the act of l\farch .3, 1853, it is directed that "the annual Coast Survey Heport shall be submitted to Congress during the month of December in each year," but by the adjournment of Congress in that mouth its reception is necessarily postponed. · 8. "To enable him to make such re110rt, and at all times when he thinks proper, be will call upon any of the a.;;1sistants for such information as he may desire~" The reports of each campaign are regularly submitted by the various assistants, and their punctuality during the present year deserves commendation.

in :Noyern ber the fi:Jllowing estimates for tile work of the survey during the next fiscal tram;mitt.ecl to tlrn dcrmrtrnent: The increase in the sums estimated for continuing the surYey iu the several sections does not arise from au.r augwentatiou of the scale of the work. No uew center of operations is proposed, nor an increase in the nnmbel' and outfit of the parties. It it> proposed merely to keep the parties i11 tlw fiPld duriug the entire working season, as had al'11o,n.; been done \J;y the former Superintendent, all(l Ihm; to JH·esflne I.he e1'.m10my wl1it'h llas marked the previo1rn direction of the Coast Survey. Durfog the 'rnr mmi:y of the iiart1~ were with the armies and squa·lrons. At that period, therefore, the effeet of the increased cost of labor aud supplies was but partially felt. Now, even with larger appl'Opriations, it operates a.s an ernlrnrrassmeut in eYery quarter of the coast to which the parties may be assigued. It is \Yell known that the energy of our people is constantly seeking for every point aml all the channeh.; along the coast susceptible of development. Thus has arisen the prnsent scale of the work, in strict obedience to public demand. Tbe 11m11her of p:Lrties has been aqjusted with rcfrrc11cc to stea~y progress from the seyeral 1nlrking centers, and the estimates are intended merel;1; to couform to the circumsttmc('S now incident to the continuance of the various branches of the serYice. vVllen work has been commenced in aUj' quarter it cannot be abay.doned without heavy lo;;s until the topography and h,ydrography are completed. The withdra,val of a party from the fiel<l hefOI"e its sea:,;on's work is finh.;l1ed is a11 m1fortu11ate sacrifice of means and a waste of outfit whieh 8honlcl not he incurred. Hence, it is respectfully submitted, as the wi8e and economical polic;\·, to increase the appropriation to that least amount which will enable the parties to keep the :field as long as the sea8on fayors the pragress of their operations. This is 110 more than has hitherto lJeen asked and produed for, and is the least appropriation which will enable the survey to preserve its justly acquieed reputation for the strictest economy in its administration. yPar

SPECIAL SURVEYS. The sur,-eys made during the year for the immediate uses of the Engineer Department, will be mentioned under the scn-eral heads or sections of the report correspornling to the coast divisions in which the work waR done. In Sedio11 T, s1u\-eys for the special uses of' that hra11ch of the public sei..-ice were made on the St. Croix Hiver; on the Peuob1>cot; on tlie Kennebec; on the Saco; and in PortlalHl Harbor. 111 Section II, minute surveys were made at Reedy faland and Liston's Point, in Delaware l{iver. Iu Section III, a sm'Yey was made of the water approaches to Havre dti Grace and of the Patapsco Rin~r. In Section VIII, the present condition of the Mississippi Passes was ·leveloped. Tll Sectiou IX, Galveston Entrance was surveyed. In Section X, the marginal survey of the peninsula, near San Francisco, was extended to include all the ground invoh-ed in thf' study of a systeurof clefonses for that important city. The department is now awaiting results which may be ex1>ected c>arly in the season from 0110 of the patties at present engaged in the survey of the mouth of the Columbia Rin\r, in Section XI. In reNped of the precision required, the work here alluded to has taxed all the resources of the assistants to whom the details were committed. In past years the same relation has subsisted l)etween the two branches of tlie service. Hence, it is well understood that the purposes of the· }Jngineer Devartment, whether surmised in advance as being relative to defenses, or subsequent to the survey, as in cases of obstruct.ed channels, are I.test met by thP. utmost exactness attainable by the methods nsed in the coast survey. Another class of surveys, special jn their character, has claimed attention this season, as in previous years. As au iudi:'lpensalile requisite for the improvement of the navigation of the Merrimac River, m11ler the auspices of the State of }fassachusetts, a close development has been made of the obstructions in that river at l\Utcht)ll's Falls. This survey, like all others, in which the prospective outla.Y for the improvement is hnge, was made to include the tidal conditions and all the features usually consi<lc>red in eivil engineering. (See Assistant Mitchell's report, Appendix No. 14.) Serdces of like clmracter have been rendered in reference to Boston Harbor. An elaborate survey ha:,; been made of Provmcetown Harbor,· with direct reference to the improvenient of its prest"ut condition, under the advice of a commission of the State of Massachusetts The importance of this lrnrbor to the coastwise trade of the United States is evidenced by the fact that, as a plaee of refuge, it haR frequently eontained as many as five hundred vessels during stormy weatht>.r. The report of Assh;tant ·whiting, in relation to the survey of that harbor, (Appendix, No. 12,) is at oucP an t>xample of the intricate nature of the questions involved in such cases, and of the care required in the surve.Y and in collateral observations. . In I'rovidence River and in Seekonk River, the character of existing obstructions has been developed, and charts have been furnished t-0 the corporate bodies having in view the improvements in na~-igation. A chart has been made from soundings taken last summer at the request of the pilot commissioners of Ne~w York City, to show t,he present comlitiou of the water front a.t the Battery, in New York Harbor. ·

Advantage was taken of the sojoum in Paris, as a "Gnite<l States commissioner for the Ex1iosition of 18G7, of Preisident Bamanl, of Columhia College, to obtain a direct comparison of the original iron meter, n<>ed as the unit of length in. the coast suryey, witlt the platinum sfaudard of France. President Barnard, wh-0se k11-0wn devotion to science justified i1is being called 011 for such a service, met with great readiuess the request addressed to him, and joined )fr.

'!'he g(meral re1mrt in regard to operations connected with the Tidal Division is given in A111w11dix No. 11.

The phenomena of the difference of level of the l'lnrface of the wat,er at tl1t· t·xtrt>mitit·H of the Gate, which exceeds four feet for more than two hours in each tide; of the continuance of tbP flow of the water in each direction for nearl,y an hour after the le,·el has ht>Pll nead1ed; and that it is upward,; against the pressure as well as against tbe regular resistance to ,·clod(r, de.wrYP tlw attention which this accurate observer lrns given them, and will gin\ material fi.>r 11rofom1d mathematical di;;cussion. It is clear that l\1r.

'l'o com1Jlete this subject some additi01ial obserntticms will be required, aud will be made as soon as circumstances may permit. Mr. ".\ritchell's general remarks at the introduction of his report are worthy of careful study.

GEOLOGICAL CHANGES OF THE COAST AND IIARBORS.
ln a communication from Professor Agassiz, of the lHh of September, he has discussed the importance of zoologicai and geological researches to the solution of some problems of deep interest, in reforence to coast lines. The Jett.er, given in the Appendix, (No. 17,) indicates, also, the true process for ascertaining the source of tbe various deposits in a harbor, and shows that this question is intimately dependent upon knowledge of the surrounding geological strata, as well as upon the various sources and consequences of animal life. The conditions are pointed out under which some of our capes and headlands are wearing away, and a mode is indicated fur determining when th(1y Will ef'A1Se to protect, the process degradation having eonverted them into dangerous shoals. At;teution is especialls called to the interest that attaches to a careful zoological stU(ly of the reefs of Florida, and to a thorough examination of the relations of the })lants and animals which liv;.· h and upon t.hem, "iu order to determine with certaii1t.y the share they have in the formation of these

OilITU AHY.
The record of the :mn·ey has been saddened by a loss of life, unnatural to tlte ordinary course of this peaceful service. A fatal accident lias deprived it of a most efticieut assistant in tbe immediate pe1·formance of his duty. Sub-Assistant Julius Kincheloe was drowned, together with fl:n>. of a cre\Y of six hands, by the breaking of the sea, which capsized his boat outside of Tillamook Bar, ou tlte coast of Oregon, on the 20th of l\Iay. With his euergy and persen~rance, he had completed the survey of the lower part of' Tillamook Jliver and of its approaches, and had patiently watd1ed for im opportunity to veri{y the soundings by a coneluding line across the bar. Smooth water ofieriug, lie succ(·edcd after two vain attempts, passed out in his boat aud sounded to the desired distance. His work was done, when, by au unexpected breaker, the boat was swamped, aud, by a 8econd breaker, it was ea1)sized at a distance of about a mile and a half f'rom land, and within the ver~· sight of his wife. Thus perished a faithful officer. ;\fr. Kincheloe entered thP. serdce in 18i'i4. His steady application to duty, and his amiable uature, secured for him at once tlte confidence and favor of the old!;lr officers. Re acquired experience in all branches of the field-work; he was accurate in his o~yations, and judiciollsly economical iu the expenditme of the funds intrusted to him. His s~oo of life was eminently characteristic. It was due to bis reluctance to lea.ve any uncertainty in his results, and for this he risked the dangers of the surf in which he 1>erished. Having worked in most of the sections on the .At.l:intie coast and on thf' Padfic, Mr. Kincheloe was ge11erally known ill tlu~ survey. No one surpassed him in the esteem in which he was held by his associates: he was beloved and respected for his courtesy and uprightness. He was strictly devoted to the interests of the work confided to his charge, and will long be remembered in the survey.

Tb is smTey covers a reach of tlie river known as l\litchell's Falls, two miles in length, in which tlit·re arc three rapids that offered considerable difticnlt.r to tht~ party in sounding, especially in the i,;election of proper planes of reference for indicating the depths. l\fany varfations in the height of the rin·r ocemTed at difti:~rent hours of the day, under the action of the tides combining \t'ith the different diRcharges from the mills of Lawrence and Lowel1 above. The work was consequently diflfoult, but was executed with accura ·y, and a Rufticient number of bench-marks were left to aid the engineer in using all the re~mlts of the survey. The slwre.Jines, ledges, and bars, together with p1·ofiles of the rin,~r hed, surface slopes, hourly changes of e1eYation, & c., were combined into a pl1ysical map, (Sketch No. 2 7) which ingeniously exhibits at once, to those who may undertake the improvement, aJl the ekments for 1'JiCl',fiCatiOllS flIH} estimates. Under the general direction of Assi>;tant MitPJ1ell, the topograph;i', soundings, and most of the obsernttious required in this department, were made hy M:r. Il.

Tile expenses incurred in the ,.;tuYey on the Merrimack were defrayed by the Pentucket Navigatim1 Company. Bo8lon 1Iarl>01·.-The general dnties of Assistant Mitehell permitting his continnam~e as a nrnmhcr of the Unit<;d States advisory council, his regular work has been carried on within call of the harbor commission of .lUassaclrnsetts, from which questions specially intricate in character are referrNl to the council. An extract is appended from the first annual re110rt of the board of harbor commissioners to show the relation sustaiiwd towards that body: "The members of the board were ap1mintf'd on the 29th of ,June, 1866, and organized on the 9th of Ju1y. The boartl were fortunate enough to secure as an advisory council, Hear· Admiral Charles H. DaYis, Superintendent of the United StateR Naval Observatory, Major General Richai·d Delafield, of the United States corps of engineers, l\fajor G(meral A. A. Humphreys, Chief of Engineers of the United States, and Henry l\litchell, esq., assistant in the United States Coast Survey. The advice of the council in regarcl to the protection and improvement of our harbor, especially Boston Barbor, rendered as it is, gratnitom:;ly, has beeu, and will be, of the highest value and importanct>. M1-. Mitchell, as the representative of the connci.l, has been able to attend most of the meetings of the board, and we are deeply indebted to him for his ai<l. "\Ve ha,·e eng~tged as engineer of the board, Albert Boschke, esq., whose seryices on the coast survey aml in tlie survey of the harbor of Boston, as well as his other <1ualifications, specially ada1>t him for the situation." An invitation to fill a ''acancy which occurred within the present season in the advisory council has been accept,ed by the Superintendent of the Coast Survey. .Astrmwmical observations at Cambridge, }lfossaehusetts.-The transatlantic telegraph operations· undertaken last year by the Coa..'>t Suryey, for the purpose of obtaining, if possible, a more accurate determination of the differences of longitude between the principal observatories in Europe and the United States, made it desirable that a re-determination bJ.' the telegraphic method of the difference of longitude between Cambridge and w· ashington should be completed this season. Ear].'\· iu May, Assistaut George "\Y. Dean was dirf'_,(Jted to organize a party and to arrange the details requisite for the astronomiual work. Hear-Admiral Charles H. Davis, United States Navy, at that time Superintendent of' the Naval Observatory 1 at "\Va.shington, and Professor Joseph Winlock, director of Harvard Observat-ory, at Cambridge, Wl'II'e invited to co-operate with the Coa1-1t Survey in making the proposed longitude experiments~ and Jlromptl.r made arrangements for that object. The opportunity was also notified to the directors of the several astronomical_ observatories convenient to the telegraph line. The director at Duclley Observatory, ProfesS-Or G. W.

each night at the seyeral stations, am1 as Roon a;;; the telegraph line was anlilable for the use of the observeri"i, which was geuerally at n p. m., thP clock at Harvard ObserYator;y was cmrnef~tpd iu the main telegTaph circuit, and dock signals were i'\ent to the Ohsernttoriws at Albm1;.- and )\'ashington for 1fre minuteR. l\1eanwhile the clocks at those places were adjmited in their respecti\-e local telegraph circuits, for the purpose of recording their clock signals upon the chrouograpll while receiving clock signals from Harvard Obseryator;y. At, the expiratio11 of fhe minutes, tl1e HmTard clock was disl'nnuect<·ll from the inain telegraph circuit, and a<Unsted iu itci local circuit; the Dudlt·y Obsen-ator;.- clock heing nlf'anwltile placecl in the maiu circuit, and its signals recorded at Cambriclgf\ aud \Vashingtou for live minutes. fu a similar manner the clocks at coast s1:u·vt':f station .seat011, and at the ~aTal OhserYator~- at \Yasltington, were com11ared b~T telegraph with the clocks at Cambridge aud Aluauy. lmmediatHly aft.er the first set of clock comparisons were complPted between the sen·ral o1)8ervatories, each night, a second series of obserYations were made for determiniug the clock correctiom;. This usually required about au hour and a half, after which a ilec01l(l set of cloek comparisom; followed, thus furnishing the data for ascertaining the rate of each clock from the obserYatories, and also from the clock comparisuns. The requisite ou;,;ervations at HarTard Obsen-at-0ry were made by Professor \Yinlock-.'lnd his assistant, l\lr. Georgt'. 3\1. Seal'le. The im;trnment nsecl for rletenuini11g the clock coneciions was a forty-eight-inch Trouglttm1 & Simms transit, (Coast Snr\·cy, ~o. 8,) ha\iug an aperture of two arnl three-quarter inclwt>. \Vhile the longitnde experiments were in progress, l\lr. Searle Yisite<l "~a,shingtou and made several sei·ies of observMions for determining the persoual equation between himself and Assistants Dean and fl-oodfellow, and Professor Newcomh of the Naval Ohsen,aJ01·y. On his rnturn northwanl, Mr. Searle passed se,·eral days at Albany, but the weather }H'OYing unfaYomble only a fow obseiTations werP ma.de for personal equation between himself and Professor Hough. Near the close of August, Assistant Dean, with Professors Hough and ~cwcomh, joined Professor vVinlock, at Cambridge, and made the final obserYations for personal e<pmtion. · The operations here noticed will be again alluded to under the heads of Section II and Section III.

Latitu,de observations at JJ[anoniet, near Plymouth, JJ.fa,ssaclm.~etts.-These obserratiom; were commenced by As8istant U. 0. Boutelle, on the 27th of June, his part.v lla-dng been previously employed at anotlier station in this section. Sixty-seven pairs of stars were observed for latitude, on thirty uights, with an _average of six obserYations to each pair. In cmmection with these, obserYations were made on twenty-seven nights in ,July and Augnst, for local time. The value of the scaJe divisions of the level of transit No. 10 was carefully determined, and observations were made to find tl1e correction for irregularity in the form of the pinlts. To find the Yalne of the micromet.er of zt>nit11 tde8cope No. V, fiye western elongations of Polaris were obsen·e<l by one hundred and sixty-three readings, and the value of level A. was determined in terms of the micrometer by two hundred and forty obserYations on six days. Assistant Boutelle was aided in the latitude and other geodetic obsern1tions at .:\Ianomet by Messrs. F. ll. Agnew and C. S.Peirce. Sub. Assistant ,J. W. Dom1 alsojoi11ed the party in July, aml rendered good service by nutking tlil': fin;t reduction of apparent Jllaces for all tbs stars used for latitude. My first vi8it of inspection was made to this party, and I was highly gratified at the vigor and a.bility manifest in its conduct. Magnetic observations at Manomet and at Nantu-0ket, ~lta.~sa-0husetts.-At .Manornet station ten determinations of magnetic dip were made by the party of Assistant Boutelle, on fom· days in August, by two huntlred and eight observations. Half-hourly readings of maxima ~tllfl minima were taken on six days, for Yariation of the needle, and observatiom; of defiection and vibration were made on three days, to determine the horizontal intensity. The magnetic elements were determined by }fr. Boutelle also a.t :Nantucket, in June, using, as in the observations just alluded to, declinomcter No. 3, and dip circle No. 8. At Nantucket, (Cliff station,) ninety half-hourly readings were taken on four days, for variation. Six determinations of the magnetic dip were ma.de, on two days, by ninety-six observations, and two day8 were employed in determining the horizontal intensity.

He reports that the changes in azimutli ;iml len,J resulting from that arrangement are n11t greater than those iuci<lent to tl1e URI' of stone l>lockfl. Senmty-orw pairs of stars were selected for ob88ITation at Nantucket. One set of thirty-nine pairs were obserTe<l from the '.Wth of SoYember until tlw 5th of Deeemb~r, the remaining thirty-two pair,; from the 7th until the 2tlth of Deeemlwr, 18Hfi. Jn all, four hnntlred a11cl l'1l'Yen olJst·Tvations were reconled fort.he latitude, and in connection with thei.n ohscrva.tions wen· made 011 seventeen 1iights of the same period, for local time. After the 8th of December the latitude obscTvations at Nantucket were continued by J\lr ..F. H. Agnew, the attention of Assistant Bontell1' lwing requisite at Calais, )Iaine, in l'onnectiou with the determination of differe11ce of longitude b;r means of tlJe Atlantic cable, reference to which was made in the last annual report. Ohser,-atiom: for time during t11e samP 1wriorl were eontinned hy J\1r. C. B. Bontell<'. Tlw com1mLed latitude of the Htation near Nantucket, 1·esult]ng from ther;e observatious, is 41° 17' 14".17, of which AsKistant Boutelle reports the probable error w he only 0".10. , Dm·ing the winter mid early spring the records of olJservations which had accumulated in this part;y W<WP duplicated, and the field computations were made. The geo(letie obserYatious at Nantucket mquisite t'or connecting the latitude station with the · clmill of primill"Y triangles were taken 1111 in 1\ia:f of tlrn present year. ~lr. Boutelle e1·ected at Nantucket <Jlift' an obsening tTipod ancl scaffold twenty-two feet high, and posted heliotropers at 111dian Hill and Sboottiying· Hill. Primary and secondary angles were here measured, an.ct tho stations ~onth Towf'rcd Church, Folger, and Sankaty Head Light were also occupied. Twenty ang·Je;; were mPa,:-;ure<l at tl1ese stAitions upon niueteeu o~jects, by seven hundred and twenty observation8.

A compari:son of tlie effects oflateral refraction, with reference tD the differing character of the lines ohscrved, is tltus concluded iu the report of Assistant Boutelle: "Generally it has been my experience, that when a geodt'tic line passes ne,ar the surface over varying depths and teniperatures, clear vision thnmghont its length will rarely he obtained, and lateral re.fra.ction will surely be encountered/' One of the lines here alluded to pai:;se<l within tweRty foet of the wa-ter on Tuckernuck Shoal, though the ends of the line were resp~ctively eighty-one and a half and two hundred aud sixty-five feet above the sea level.

Iu allusion to the unusual local disturbance dcn:iloped by the observations1 Mr. Schott remarks: "The declination in tl1e vicinity of Hartfonl is umlouhtedly leRS than might be expectfld from the general distribution of' magneti8m. As compared with results from the general formula for declination on tlte coast of New :Buglaml, the lleviation is abo1Lt ;i4-' eaRterly, and is prohahly due to the influence of trap dikes. There is reason to think that the Recular change over clistnrhed regions is normal, or, in other words1 that the local deflection of iRogonic curves is there a permanent feature." The instrumental constauts were determined by Assistant Schott immediately after his return to V\r ashingt-On. ·

Seaforth Stewart, of the corps of V11itPd States engi11eers. Early in :May Assistant R JV[. Bache cTected signals for a dose smTey of tlw vieiuity of Port Penn, iuclucling Reedy Island. The plane-table sheet shows on a lnrg«) scale all tJw topographical details of th(~ island, an<l of two miles and a half of the west bank of tlw Helawarf', comprising an aggreg·ate of four square miles. Tlw ice liarbor at I:eedy Island was surveyed on a larger scale. Assistant Ifache followed the 11Ia11e-table work by a careful hydrographir~ survey of the vicinity of Reedy lslaml, carrying the i;omHling three-quarters of a mile eastward, and extending the work north and south a mile beyond the extrNnities of the island. The p~stiagc between Ree,dy Island and Port Penn was also carefully sounde1l as well as the ice harbor. About two thousand cm>ts of the lead were 'rccor:rled. The sm'W~.Y was eompleted on tlie 10th of .July. Before leaving this ,-iniuit,y -:\fr. Badw ran a line of le;-els from t,he tide-gauge which was used at the Reedy lsland light-house, and established a bench-mark near the ice harbor. 1'he principal points used in this special survey were carefully marked for future reference. Complete copies of the two sheets, one showing the t.opographical features, and the other the bydrngrapl1y, have, been furni;;he<l to Lieutenaut Colonel Stewart. Survey at Liston'.~ Point, (Dela,ware Rfrer,) Delaware.-A.s stated in the previous notice, this sun·ey was m:u](' for the use of the Engineer Department; the service, depending upon the result· ing map, being in charge of Lieutenant Colonel Stewart. In the latter part of .July Ao;sistant R. M. Bache established a tide-gauge at a sta,tion a few mile!'\ a hove J~i I'll on'1> Point for the adjustment of the som.tdings intended to be made. Signals were then ereeted to gfre points suitable for a survey on a large scale. The map made by Assistant Bache includes Liston's Point, and above it a mile and a half of the west b:rnk of the Delaware river, with half a mile of the bank below the point. The topographienl featurt's were mapped so as to meet any possible requirements in engineering. The hydrngra11h~' of tlie vicinity of Liston's Point was extended north and south as far a8 the }llane-table limits, aml to a distance throughout of half a mile fr(Jm the shore. Immediately above the point, where. the water is deeper, the soundings were increased in number. About ~n hundred casts of the lead were recorded. This survey was concluded on the 24th of September. The two maps resulting from this survey have boon completed by Assistant Bache since the last-mentfoued date, and copies of them h;we been furnished for the use of the Engineer Depart·

Explorations iu the Gulf Stn,am during the past year were mainly for the purpose of affording information r(·~111irf'd by tlw International Oceauic Telegraph Company in order to h1:r 1~ cable from Ke_\" \Yest to Havana. A party was fitted out iu the spring and sent under the direction of ARsistaut Henry Mitchell t.o tlie Strait of Florida in tlie sm'vP.:)'ing steamer Corv;in, Acting· l\laster Hobert Platt, comma11<liug. Assistant L. F. l'ourtalcs was aRSo(·fated with ~Ir. Mitchell and accompanied the part;r to aid in the iun·fltig-atiom:i mid study tlw organisms brought up in the specimens from the bottom of the strait. The work commenced off tlw coast of Culm, under fa>orable prospects, aLout the middle of :\fay, and good progress was made until the :3d of June. .At that date :reHow fever suddenly broke mlt ou board the Corwin. lu the course of the next four dnys three of her crew died and others on the siddi:,;t wen.· in a critical co1Hlition. Under this necessity further operations in sounding were abandoned. The sl1ip on her way northward was fortunately met by a gale from the north when 1waring Port Ho~·aI, South Carolina, and there the fover cases on board took a f\worable turn so tlia t 110 other <h·;iths occun·ed. The work <~xecuted during the few days in which operations were continued by Assistant l\litehell was of ('OllHid<~rahle interest. Thro11gh the iut.ervention of our vice-consul at Hiwana, Mr. SaYage, the steamer Corwin was allowt>d to rewfozrous at Chorrera, the pres_eut landiug point of the telegrapl1 cable. This little port lies a fow miles r.o the weo;tward of Havana, and is .contiguous to the narrow part of the Gulf Stn,am, which th<·re passes quite near to the coast of Cuba. The season betng too far as:vanced for co11tinu01u; goo1l weather, this port often afforded shelter from the strong trade winds of mid-day aud from ti.le rioleut sqna.lls of the evening.

ThP weather being· fayorable, rapid progress wa!" made, result·ing· in an aggregat>IC of oyer twenty-nine thousand soundings, nearly completing the h;ydrograpliy of the entire hay before the c1os'i of the following month.

A fatal accident occurred in the transfer. On the 28th of J\Iay :Mr. Nes got the vessel under way and ran a. liue of somHlingR through the channel of San Luis Pas8. In going out soundings wen' contimmd across the uar, it ha.Ying been alleged that the range mark;, on San I . uis Island did not carQ~ through the best water. The report of l\fr. X es thus conti1mco;: "Iu running out there was quite a l1e:n-y sea on thP hm·. Tlie cutter, however, did not ship a bucket of water, and no d:mger was appn·hended in coming iu; hut wheu returning, aml just on the har, a succession of llmtYY seas broke in mid-cha1mel, swamping the cutter almost instantly.

Topor1rapliy of Uorpu~· Cltr·iMi Bay, Texas.-This work was resumed on the 21st of .Tanuary by Suh-Assistant Charles Hosmer, with a party in the sur,·cying scbooLWl' Peirce. Working southward from the lower end of Harbor Island (Sketch No. 14) the det[ti!ed topography was extended until the 2d of .'.\Ca;y, when the survey was discontinued. The two sheets returned to the offic1~ comprise the northern and western shores of Corpus Cl1I'i8ti Bay and fifteen miles of the length of :Mustang Island, which separates the bay from the Gulf of Mexico.

AssiBtant Gilbert whilf' in this section examined the mode of working, arnl commends the character of tlle pla11e-tahle sheets. Sub-Assistant Hosmer was employed during the immmer and autumn in topographical duty in Section I, as was statd under t11at head. · Reconna·it1M:mcc.-At the end of tlie year 1860 the tdangulation of the coast of Texas had been extended southward and westward, and had included Corpus Christi Bay. R~ference to the annual report of my predecessor for the year 1861 shows that the "triangulation of the r,aguna Madre was intended in th'~ scheme of operations for that season. The stations occupied in previous years by Asisistant S. A. Gilbert. had be.en carefully marked, but it is incident to the locality that marks are not easily set so as to remain, even if n6t intentionally displaced. The health of Assistant Gilbert, impaired by constant military duty during a pecriod of about four years, did not admit of his assignment to this Reetion in the season of 1866. He was able, hut with difficulty, t-0 visit the parties detailed t.o work at GalYeston Bar and in Oorpus Christi Bay in April last; and with the energy which had marked his previous course in the triangulatiou, his stay in the section was employed in reconnaissance with reference fo the further progress of the survey. Of one of the stations under which he had set <loop the usual mark in 1800, he says : " The hill upon which it was located ha.s blown away, leaYing· a large bole in its place." It is probable, however, that the earth marks remain at tlie terminal statiomi of his work of 1860, a.nd that the triangnla.tion of the Laguna Madre, ·which is now in pt'Ogress, may be dosed on them. This is !lonfidently hoped, notwithstanding the fa.ct reported of one of the stations thus relied on, that "Corpus Christi signal is down, and the

(Sc·e 8ketd1 Xo. :!7.) A. great ol_\jectiou to the pa11tograph::1 used preYiou8 to those-made b~- .:\Ir. 8<m·nsen, arose from the weakness of the joints of the arms, Yertieally. )fr. Sorensen oYer<'auw this difficulty by termi· ,,nating. one end of each arm in a, Yertical'fork, the extl'emities of whic11 me septm1tc~d about t\Yo inclies for the reception of 111e em1 of tl1e arljace11t an11 eousistillg of a brass bar. 'l'JH' joi11 t iR fonn(·d by steel screw points through the extremities of the fork, 'Yhieh are recein·d into correo;poudiug· socket,s in the ends of the bar. This gin's a good braciug, Yertically, and forms a joint with Yery little friction. A. great :ulYtmtngl' of this strenµ;tlt i~ that it iwrmits the- application of at\justable force by means of :-;prings on tlte eugniYing point. The weak11ess of the otl1er m:1d1im·1< in the p:n'· ticular noted, required weights to be dil'eetl.r applied ou the yoiut, tl1p momt>ntum of whfrh iuterf(·red \\it11 a free mul n·:1o1ly c11m1gT' of t1in~etio11 of 11101 ion.

A gnmrnl diamond point is used for eugraving on the plate and a steel point for traeing the work to be eHµ;raYerl. · Tile pai1togra1)h beiug 1;m1y a repeati11g and not an inYe1ting maehi11e with the pointR i11 the same plane, experiments haYe been made h,\· facing thP plate duwuward in a plane iiarallel to that in ·which the tracing point monos. In this manner the drawing may be iuyert.ed on the plak, hut the difficulty of preserving correct position is so great as to make the mode now emplo:>·ed of obtain· ing an inyerted drawing preferable. It is seldom possible to use a plane-table sheet for direct reduction br meehm1ical means 011 account of the seusi~veness of the 11aper to the humidity of the atmo,;phen', which does not act equally in all its parts, resulting generally l.n a permanent coutraetiou, after the usna] exposure in the field. Recourse is therefore had to tracing Yellnm, a le"5s sensitive material and couscquPntly more permanent in its dimensions, on which a correct· iirojcctiou iH coustrneted, mul the original sheet tmced minute. hy miuuw with groat care. The reversal of the tracing giYes the reverse image ready for duplicating or reducing. The table used.is made carefull;y horizontal, the portion rPceiYing thl' plaJ-e hdng cut out to the depth of its thickness, so that itR upper surface comes in the })laiw of th('. table. The portion of the table on which the tracing is used is covered witll white paper, pasted ftrmly to it, so that the work on the tracing v;ill show distinctly. The pantograph being set to tlle proportion the map to be engraved bears to tlie original, a pr~jection is carefully made on the plate, aud the pantograph made fast in the most desirable position for free inotiou -witlt:iu the best range for acenraey. The diamond or engraving point is then set on each point of iute1·Rection of the parallels and meridians of the proje_ction on the plate, the position of the tracing point at the opposite end of the pantograph being marked in each case, so that a pr(ljection of'tlw scale of tlte original is thus constructed on tbp table, to which the tracing is cllrefnlly S('.t, minute by minute. · As there is a limit to the ~trengt.l1 of the line a diamond poi11t will cut witltout da1igcr or injury, those. lines that are required of a strength gTeater than t1tis limit, snel1 a,; ro:uh.;, fe1wei;, &e., are only clrawn in with a light liue a.s a. guide tiw t11e engraYer; other portiom1, snc.lt as eont-0nrs of

hills, are cut finally, the strength of Jine being regulated by springs acting on the diamond point and adjustable for different forces. The advantage gainrnl hy dispe11sing with the old methods of reduction, which required an experienced draughtsman at an expense quite equal to the present cost of the completed outlines in the plate, together with the greater accuracy resulting from but one operation mechanically in reducing from the original to the plate, is apparent, when we consider the usual process of drawing, tracing, transfeITing, and entering by hand, involving four distinct operations, each liable to m9re probable error than the one operation performed with the pantograph. The usual operation requires skilled labor, tlmt by tl1e pantograph requires only patience, judgment, and application, and such skill as can easily be acquired by those of average intelligence. This process, too, works to the aclvantagc of the engraver in dispensing with the least agreeable operation of his art and ghing him elcanly entered work ready for the point and graver. The work, with the present pantograplls, has been done under my direetion, by:Mr. E. Molkow, to whose patience and cheerful application through details so trying, much of the success so far achieved is due. Respectfully, &c., E. HEHHESHED1ER,

ON THE LONGITUDE BETWEEN A:lfERICA AND ETTROPE FRO:M 81GNAL8 THROUGH THE ATLANTIC CABLE.
I.-0RIGIN OF THE COAST SURVEY EXPEDITION.

The determination of longitudes by means of the electro-magnetic tdegraph was, aR is well known, first practiced by the United Stafos Coast Survey; and the methods by which it attained its full devclOJ)ment were here in use several years before they began to b(~ emplo;ved elst'where. From the year 18.!9 until the begi.nning of the late war, early in 18t.il, tht>y were unremhtingl,y pro8ecuted. At that time twenty-four inde11endent determinations had been matlf'., 1w pains lwiug spared fo~· the attainment of all possiLle precision, and the series of telegraphic longitudes extended from the northeastern boundary to New Orleans, covering two and a half hourn of longitude, aud fifteen degrees of latitude, within our own territ-0ry, as well as some portions of the British provmces. Upon the completion of the Pacific telegraph, arrangements were made· for extending the connection to San Francisco, but these wen\ reluctautly df'fe1Ted in consequenc'.e of the condition of the country. 'Por longitudes reckoned from any transatlantic zero, much coarser results only have hitherto been attaiue(l; and the uncertainty of the determinations has been twenty or thirtJ-· times greater than that between au;y of the 1winb; which form the series of American determinations, and very much larger than that between any points referred to these fundamental ones Ly the geodetic operations of the snrve,y. The Atlantic cable promised, at last, t.o afford an opportunity of conne,eting the American with the European longitudes, and thits of practically reducing the two iudepcudent series of determinations into what shonld practically be but one. The large \'iews of the late honored. he.ad of the Coast Survey, Professor Bache, led him to take immediate st~ps for the att11iume11t of this encl; and upon the first organization of the Atlantic Telegrap.h Company, t-0 the assistance of which he gave his hearty aud effective support, he obtainedt from the officers of this and of the Newfoundland companies their read;y promise of all needful facilities for determining the relati-ve longitude of their terminal stations. Immediately upon the la.nding of the cable at Trinity Ba;y, Mr. Hilgard was dispatehed t.o this remote spot, in order to decide, from personal inspection, whether the communication was sufficiently good to permit of satisfactory longitude signals without delay; but his report was necessarily adverse. Upon the organization of the telegraphic cable expedition of 1865, Mr. Hilgard, who, during Professor Bache's illness, was acting in hi>< 'behalf, obtained anew from the respective companies permission for our use of the cable, if successfully laid, and the honorable Secretary of the Treasury authorized the necessary outlays. Mr. L. F. Pourtales repaired to Heart's Content, and therb awaited the arrival of the Great Eastern, in order t.o notify me, without delay, of the character and availability of the signals, should the cable be successfull;y laid; but the rupture of the cable, in mid-ocean, made his expedition unavailing. The same preliminary steps were again taken in 1866, Mr. G. W. Dean awaiting the arrival of the Great Eastern a.t Heart's Content. The expedition of this year was happily successful, and Mr. Dean reported, by telegraph, that the sharpness of the signals was all that could be desired. Measures were at once taken for organizing the parties. Mr. Dean returned only a few hours too late to present his report whlle we were attending the session of the National Academy of Sciences, at Northam pt.on, but he found Mr. Hilgard and myself at the meeting of the American Association, in Bud'alo, where all the details for the expedition were arranged without delay, and the needful directions for im~paration of instruments and observers given by Mr. Hilgard. The large interval betweeu. the meridians of the two extremities of the cable precluded the

employment of the method of star-signals, for many reasons. This method requires a more protracted occupation of the cable than it seemed right or reasonable to solicit. The clhnate of Newfoundland, according to the hest information receiYed, is too varia b1e and uncertain to ·warrant reliarice upon the eonti11na11ee of a dear sky for three hours, while, unless the~ should promise fanmlbly, it wonld he unwise to employ the cable for trausmitting observations from Valencia, which would he useles;;;, m1less combined with sub;,;equent obseryatious of tlie same stars from Heart's Content. :Moreover, for a lougitmle so great as that to be measured, the spedal ady~n tages of the metl10d of star-signals chiefi,> disappear, tlw clock-r<ltPR becoming matters of serious importance, and entailing errors of the same order of magnitude as those of the absolute timedeterminations, while the wi<lE· sep:iration of the obsern·rs precludes that thorough elimination and control of personal ('qnatiou which h; feasible when the longitudt> observations are restricted to zenithal stars, and the ohsen-ern eau easily exchange positions and frequentl~' meet at one or tlie other Rtation. There waR also ground for confidence that the catalogue of standard stars to be employed for determining time was so well freed from systematic errors that the difference of half a quadrant in the meridi:ws would introdncP no (·rror, depmuliug on the right ascensions, no matter at what honr the com1mrism1i-; might ht> madt>-a confidence which the P\ent has fblly justifteu.
II.-PREVIOUS DETEIDIINATIO:XS OF THE TRAN8ATLANTIC LONGITUDE.

Tlw several dpterminations of long'itude bPtwecu Buropean und American stations, which ha\'e hitherto serYed as the ha,,,is for ai,;tronomical and nautical c01nputatiom1, may be classified under three hea<ll'<-from moon culminations; from eclipsPs and occ11ltations; aml from dirouometers. J\Jost of tl1em Jiaye been referTerl to 01w or 1he other of two American points-the College Observatory, at CamlJTidge, aud the ~aYal Observatory, at vVnshiJtgton. The former has preseuted especial conveniences for the chronometric expeditious, both from its close vicinity to tlw point of landing and shipment in Boston, and fI"Om the charge of these expeditions being confided to the dir(·ctor of the observatory, who was specially versed in chronomet1'ic matters, and whose office in Boston was emmectetl with the Cambridge clock b;\~ a tdegraph wire, so tlmt not evPn the transportation to the observatory \\as requisite. ThP: la.tte1·, as situated at the national capital, and administered by one of the departments of government, has heP:n naturally seleeted, in most cases during recent years, as the fundamental point for other determinations. As the European point of ref(>rence, Gref>uwich has been employed in all cases. The telegrapltic longitudes of the Coast SurvPy have, since the first ;rear, been uniformly referred to a third American point, the Seaton station of the Coast S11rvP:,y, in the Cit,v of Washin:.,rton; hut tlw longitudes of X e\Y York and Philadelphia, upon which that of Cambridge depends, were refened to the \.Vashingto11 Obsenatory, which is situate!}* 12".44 westward from the Seaton station, by geodetic mcasurement. 'J'he longitude between Cambridge and \Vashington, as deter mined b;y my pre·lPces8or, Mr. Walker, in 1848 and 1849, tis as follows:

All these investigations, though greatly varying among themselves, agreerl in the result that Ilurckhardt's value was decidedly too small, and corroborated thus the change wbich vValker's computation of the eelipsl1 of 1830 showed to be necessar;I'. Rel;ving on these confirmations "\\~alker adopted 13 the correction +1 11 .5 to Burckhardt's coustaut, and found that the transatlantic longitude deduced from eclipses was thus cliininislwd hy 2°.61 for the whole coast of the United Stat.es.

No amount of labor, effort, or expense had been spared by the Coast Survey for its chronometric expeditions, inasmuch ai;; the most accurate possible 1foterminatiou of' the transatlantic longitude was specially required 11 by law; and the thorough accuracy of Professor Newcomb's inyestigations is well known to a.;;tronomers. Yet the result of the, latest chronometric ex1)edition differs from that deduced by Newcomb, from moon culminations observed at the Washington Observatory since its regeneration, compared with those observed at Greenwich,-by more than three and a half seconds of time. The value employed by the Coast Survey, from 1852 to 1859, was 5h gm 11".2; since 1859 it has been 5h cm 11 ·.8.
Ill.-HISTORY OF THE EXPEDITION.

The building erected in Calais, Maine, and occupied as a longitude station in 1857, was still in existence, tbough much dilapidated, the stone piers being undisturbed. JUr. George Da\cidson, assistant in the Coast Survey, was to take charge of this station, witll l\fr. S. C. Cllandler, jr., as aid. Mr. Dean was assigned to the station at Heart's Content, with tl1c assistance of Mr. Edward Goodfellow, while I was to occupy the Valencia station, Mr. A. T. Mosman accompanying. Each station required a small transit instrument, a chronograph, and an astronomical clock. The most questionable feature of the arrangement was the use of the land line of wire, about 1,100 miles long, between Heart's Content and Calais. Hitherto all our telegraphic longitudes have been determined without any use of "repeaters," or double relay magnets, which have been most carefully avoided as inevitably introducing an additional element of error, or at least of uncertainty into the result. The armature times of different electro-magnets, acted on by galvanic currents of different int-ensities, enter into the result, and only their mean amount is eliminated, while one-half their difference is inseparably merged with the resultant longitude. Between Calais and Heart's Content there were known to be not only several of these repeaters, but also one or two stations,

Yet uot only our financial resm1n~Ps, hut also mll" a\·ailable tiuw and our t'.Upply of instrnments, precluded the occupation of more thau three stations at once, and it was reluctantly decided to make use of so many repeaters in this interval as careful investig·ation should show to be absolutely necessary. Messrs. Davidson and Dean left Boston for Halifax, in the stc>amer of Reptember ,-;, to make an examination of the condition of the telegraph line, aml a week later 1\lessrs. Goodfellow, Mosman, and m,pmlf sailetl in the Cunard steamship Asia, bound for Liverpool Yia Halifax and Queenstown, taking the inst,ruments for Newfoundland and lrelaml.. But a short time before OUT departure, the welcome tidings had arrived of the recovery in mid-ocean of the lost cable of 18G5, and of the successful continuation of this second line to :N"ewfoundland. To the courtesy and interest of the officers of the Cunard Compauy W<' were indebted, from the beginning to the end of our expedition, for many fayors aml mneh as;;ii-tauce. 1'ltf' cordial 8ympathy of Captain .J. P. Anderson, of her Britannic Majesty's mail steamer Africa, tlieu temporaril~· in <~01mna11d of the Asia, was of peculiar value, and calls tc)r the siucere8t w~knowledgments. I may also mention here our obligatimis to JHr. Grierson, ag·ent of the Cunard stpamship at Queeustown, who, both at the debarkation and resllipment of the instruments, assisted iu the most e:tfective manner. At Halifax tl1e accounts given by Messrs. DaYidson and Dean 1n~re far from encouragiug. Between the terminus of the Atlantic cable and the American frontier there l>I'OYed to be four repeaters, and two stations at which messages were re-written. Repeaters and batteries were at once provided by us for use at these last-nanwd station,;, and it ·was drcided that :'.\1r. llavidson i,;hould charter a schooner in which t-0 visit the various points along tl1e coast or X!w~1. Scotia, Capt' Breton Island, and Newfoundland, carr,ving wit,11 him the 11ecessaQ· outfit arnl giving the requisite instructions to the operators. This Mr. Davidson successfo.lly accomplished by dint of gl'eat cum'gy and personal exel'tion, while Ml'. Chandler, at his direction, refitted the Calais station and mounted the instruments, the first obserYations made there being on the 25th of October. Messrs. Dean and Goodfellow reached Heart's Content on the 20th September, and proceeded to the immediate preparation of au astronomical station; but were not favored with the sight of any celestial luminary until the 16th October, on which day they brought the transit and clock into tolerable adjustment, and on the 18th their regular observations commenced. On the morning of Saturday, September 22, the Asia arrived off Queenstown, where Mr. Mosmari landed with the instruments, while I kept on the Yo,vage to Lh'el']lool, and thence to London to confer with the officers of the compan~T· The management and control of the cables being with the Anglo-American Telegraph Company, which had conducted the expedition of 1866, aud not with tlte Atlantic Telegraph Compauy, on whose friendly promises of assistance we had depemled, it became necessary to apply :mew for permission 1:o use the lines, and for the needful facilities at Valencia. To the cordial friendliness of George Saward, esq., secret.a.ry of the Atlantic Company, we liad already been indebted fur many acts of courtesy, and he aided me without delay in the most effective manner. The use of the cables was at ouce granted by John C. Deane, est}., secretary of the A.ngloAmerican Company, subject, of course, to the condition that tile observations and experiments should not interfere with the regular business of the compan.''; and I was furnislled by him with letters 1:o the telegra.pllic staff at Valencia. From the eminent electricia11 to the company, Latimer Clark, esq., I received much valuable information and important practical suggestions, as well as full authority for the trial of electro-magnets in connection with the cables, beside the nee<llegalvanometers in use by the company. The astronomer royal also gave his ready sympathy to the undertakiug. His own plans had been formed, authority obtained, and some of the preparations already coum1ence<l for making- a telegraphic longitude determination hetween Valencia and Newfoundland in .June next; but with extreme kindness lie placed me in possesMion of all his special information pertaining to the suluect, and aided our operations with word and deed.

Acconling to preYious arrangement be had alrt>ad~- brou,!rht the imitrnments to that point by rail, and had Yi::;ite<l Valencia to examine the ~p:om1<l and learn wlrnt provision 'rould be required for the 8tOJw pie.rs of our transit inst.rume11t and dock, and for tlrn materials of our astronomical station. From uh; report it was manifest t.l\at tl1e n·qni8ite supplies could be obtailwd upon thf' ii-;laml, or in its immec1iate Yicinity, and early on the morning· of Octouer :J we started westward. The six large boxtcs of instrmnent8 were piled au<l carefully made fast upon a larg'e '' Jrish car,'' the only YehiclP upon springs to be found in the town, and tlw transportation of this lrngr tower on wheels forty-two miles to the feIT~': acl'Oss the Straits of Yalencia, and cleposit of the in8truments in a place of shelter, were accomplished without accident before daylight had wholly disappeared. · The lougitn<le statio1is occupied by :'.\Ir.

For tlw telegnq1hic dPterrni11atiou of 181i2, the instrument used for determining time was mounted in tlw village of K11ightstowu, at the eastern extremity of 1Jrn islaml. Tht- ernp]oyment of the same station-point, the position of vd1ich was \\'ell marked, was of course highly desirable. l\loreovt>r, it was situated at that point of the island which afforded bs far tl1e greatest conveniences, H]l(l it was dose to tlw hot.el. But the electricians of tlie company ha,-e always been extremely aYer.se to all~' cormeetion, bowen'r i.JTief~ between tile cable and :my land lines, on account of the possihilit,v of injury to the f'alile by light11i11g. This fact, to say nothing of others comwcted witl1 prompt exchange of mes:sages with Newfoundland, and a readineRs to aYail om'sPlves of any sudden change of wea.ther at either place, rendered it imperatiYe that our station should be established Yery near the building- of the telegraph company at Foilhommermn Bay, five and one-half miles west of Kniglitstown, and remote from an~· other dwelling-house except tbe unattractive cabins of tl1e veasautry. Here, as close to the telef,rraph-house as was consistent with an unobstructed meridian, the astronomical station was established, and a building constructed eleven feet wide and twenty-three feet in length. This was divided by a transvf'rse partition into two aparlmeuts; the larger of these serYing as an observator~,, while the ea.stern enu was used as a d'\.velling place. This l.Juild:i.ug was bolted to six hea\·y stones buried in the earth, and was protected from the southwest gales by the telegraph-house, thti eorner of which was within a very few yards at the nea,rest point; while rising groull(l to the northwest guarded us against the winds from that qua.rter. In the obser\'ing-room were mouuttid the transit instrument, clock, and chronograph. It also contained a table for a relay magnet and Morse register, and a rncording table. :For the kind reception whieh we met at Valencia., I know not how to give an adequate expression of rn,y thankis. A more hearty well:ome, a mm·e thorough an<l delightful hospitality, or more friendly aid, could have been found at no time or place. The inevitable 1tardships and exposure ol our life, at a distance from any permanent habitation other than the over-tenanted house of the telegraph company, and under circumstanees apparently incompatible with comfort, were thus mitigated and compensated to an incredible degree. To tlle Knight of' Kerry we were indebted, not only for a hospitality worthy the traditional re1mtatio11 of tl1e land, and for which we shall always remain personally grateful, but also for the most practical and efficient aid in furtherance of our operations. All hi.s agents received instruotions to assiRt UR by every means in their power; his buildings afforded storage for our inst.rmnents at K11ightstow11; his quarries and st.one-cutters famished piers; his factor enabled us to obtain lumber; and his carpenter was detailed for expediting the work upon our building. The gentlemen of' tlte telegraphic staff received us with a kindliness to which there was no exception ; welcoming ns to their quarters, and sharing with us their comforts. Of the sixteen electricians and operators in the service of four different companies, there is no one t-0 whom we are not indebted for essential aid in our work, as well as under personal obligations for many acts of kindness. To .Tames Graves, esq., superintendent of th.:; station, and Edgar George, esq., second in charge, we owe especial acknowledgments.

All objections to these were, however, waived in our favor by ~lr. I . .atimer Clm·k in the most cordial manner, and considerable time was expended on two p\·enings in emleavoring to obtain satisfactory signals which should be self-regh-1tering. Unfortnnatt>ly, these efforts were lllll'Uccessful. The cable could not be dischaTged with sufficitmt rapidity foT the purpose wheu the clrnrg·e was sufficiently 1;trong to actuate our i:nost sensith-e electro-magnet. A permaneut. 1ktieetio11, on]~·, was observed at Newfoundland, while the Yiilencia clock was breaking the circuit during an eighth part of eve1·y second; nor <lid any modification in the character of the hattrn-;r render these ii1terruptio11s of continuity perceptible at the other extremity of the cable. I had previously designed a.vailiug myself of an elegant suggestion of Ur.

On the 24th October, 1866, longitude-signals were exchanged with NewfoumUatul for tlie first time. Betwe('\n that date and NoYt-mber ~O four more opportunities had becn found, ancl the entire series of experiments for determining the n~locity of signals under different circnrnstanccs had beeu satisfacforily tried, aR well as some others which I found practfoable at Valencia, although not provided for in the programme. Mean\"11ile, the astronomer ro;yal, who had with his usual kimlncsR accecled to my request for a t.elegraphic connection between our station point and Greenwich, and assumed all the labOl' and embarrassment of the necessary arrangements, had calTied out the series of exchanges with Foilhommernm, an undertaking aJtende.<l wit.h no lit.tie inconYenienC'e and ,~exation from the Yariom; difficulties atfonding land lines, especially when a submarine cable of the length of that. ~wross the Irish Channel formed a part of the circuit. After many frnitless alt.empts, clock signals were exchanged on three nights, upon two of which the time was well determined at both places. Upon the 20th Noyei11her the weather at Heart's Content as well as at Valencia was extremely unpromising; no communication had _yet been obtained between that station and Calais, and it seemed best on all accounts to bring our cable signals to an end also. After visiting Greenwich to ofter such aid in the reduction of the longitude exchanges with that obser.-atory as might be acceptable to the astronomer royal, 1\Ir. Mosman reached home on the 22d December, and I followed four weeks later. The personal error, and other loss of time in observing signals, has happil.v proYed more constant and more measurable than I had ventured to anticipate. No matter how gre.at the interval, the resultant longitude will only be affected by one-half the difference of the Yalues for the two observers; while the average value for the two observers would be merged with the time of transmission for the signals. It is not the least satisfactory of our results that this interval proYed capable of measurement with an accuracy which leaves no ground for apprehension that it has appreciably affected our value for tlte longitude, and which enables us t-0 infer the Yelocity of transmission within restricted Jimits of probabl~ error. The exchanges between Heart's Content and Calais were far less satisfact.ory. Notwithstanding the laborious prt'cautions taken by Mr. Davidson, all efforts at direct communicat.ion provell una· vailing, day after day, and week after week. Mr. Davidson's health became seriously impaired, and Mr. F. W. Perkins was added to the Calais party, joining it on the 12th NoYember. Finan:.-, Mr. Davidson being called to important duties at the Isthmus of Darien, was compelled to lean Calais, and Mr. Charles 0. Boutelle, oue of the most experiencecl officers of the survey, was assigned to the charge of the station. Still, the necessity of an intermediate aRtronomica1 station at Port Hood or A.spy Bay seemed inevitable, when sudden]~· on the 11th December, on1;r a couple of hours before Mr. Boutelle's arrival, the'iong-desired communication was found to be estabfo;hed. A sharp frost had thrown the otherwise defective line into a condition of admirable insulation, so that an int.erchange of clock signals was effect.ed without difficulty. Comparisons of clock time at the two sta. tions were also made on the 12th, 14th, and 16th December, though uot in a manner wholly satis9

REPORT OF 'l'HE SUPERINTENDENT OF

junct1~re 1\fr. Dean, at H e:i.rt's Content, decided to discontinue obsen"ations mt<l dismount bis instru·
merit;;, so that tile work was hTongbt to a close, the ~ ewfoundlanu observers reaching Boston again in the last week of Df'cembcr. In reducing; the observations I have been aided in some degree by Mr. Mosman, but chiefly by ~Ir. Chandler, who has f(Jr several ;years rendered efficient, and r-;ki1lful services in computations of tbis kin(!, as well as ill mmmrous other astronomical observations and reductions. To both these gentlemen I desire to make acknowledgment for their valuable seryiees in the office as well as in the field. The nature of the undertaking had, of course, thus far precluded aur determination of personal equation between the obseryers. This was provitled fur with as little delay as possible. My plan had contemplated the entire elimination of this disturbing element at Heart's Uontent, since it would affect the longitudes of Valencia and Calahi equally, but with opposite signs. It proved that this precaution had been overlooked, and that the time had been dC'termined by Mr. Dean during the exchanges of siguals with Europe, and by Mr. Goodfellow during those with the United States; but as will be seen this proved of no practical importance. During a long series of years, the personal equation hetwetm tlrnse two gentlemen, as determined several times annually, was inappreciahle, and so too it proYe'tl in the eomparisons made after their return from the present expedition. At tlte earliest practicable date extensive obsenatious were made for the determination of personal equation between each pair of obseryers. The result of these will be given iu its place. It may perhaps be well to add a few words concerning the im;trnments usfld, which were the ordinary apparatus of the telei.,r:rapl1 part,\· of the Coast Survey, consisting at each station of a transit instrument, a ch1·onograph, and a circuit-breaking clock. The transit instruments haYe an aperture of about seven centimeters and a focal length of about one hundred and sixteen centimeters. Each is proYided with a reversing apparatus, attached to the iron stand, and capable of reversing the instrument with ease in about twm1.ty seconds; so that it is not difficult to o!JserYe a star, in one position of the axis, within 30· or 3ri· after obReTving it in the other. The illuminating lamps are placed on brackets, unconnected with the instrument and pla{;efl as far from it as may well he. The reticule carries five "tallies," or sets, of five spider-lines each, at inter·rnls of about two and a half equatorial seconds of time, the se>eral tallies being separated from one another by twice this distance. The tallies are denoted by the letters of the alphabet from B to F, inclusive, and the individual threads b;y su~ja-0ent numbers; the numeration commencing at the lamp end, or end at which the illumination is admitted to the field, so that when tl1e lamp end is west the star at its upper culmination traverses the threads in the direct order of their numeration from B1 to F;. The instrument,., are provided with diagonal eye-1liooes of magnif'.ving powers not far from one hundred, and signal keys are permanently fixed on each side in convenient positions. The chronographs at Valeneia and Heart's Content were" spring governors," by Messrs. William Bond & Son; that at Calais was a "Kerrison's regulator," with modifieations by Mr. Saxton. Upon all of them one pen, wl1ich is constantly tracing a line upon the revolving cylinder, records the signals hoth from the clock and the ouseTver by offsets from tl1i!'I normal line. The experience of eight.een years has shown that the f.,'Teater simplicity of the apparatus, when prmided with but a. single electro-magnet and recording pen, far overbalances, at least in the longitude work of the tmrv<~y, any inc-011veniences arising from a possible confusion of the clock signals with those given b;y tl1e observer. Tbe offsets produced by the former are of practically equal length, this length depending on the adjustment of the armature and strength of the ba.ttery; while those produced b_y the ohsenation signal!'> are for a practiced observer quite near enough to equality to preclude any difficulty in reading off the recoT<ls, except in very rctre cases. For portable instruments there seems to be no room for reasonable doubt as to the superiority of instruments with a. single pen, a.nd for the fixed instruments of an observatory I should, personally, also give this construction a decided preference. All signals are given by the interruption of a closed circuit, so that when the observing key is propel'ly adjusted no intenal efapses between the first pressure and the transmission of the telegraphic signal, while the moment of release of the armature from the elootro-ma.gnet is distinctly recorded.

The clocks are all provided, according to Saxton's plan, with delicate platinum tilt-hammers, resting on platinum disks, and so adjusted that a small pin fixed in tlw pendulum rod at its center of percm·1'io11 sliall strike tlte tilt-liamnwr when the rod is Yertical, aIHl thus lift the liammPr from the disk for a very brief 1icriod, gpnera11.'- about the om·-bum1rPllth part of a second. The galyanic circuit to the chronograph being conducted through the tilt-hammer and disk, the circuit becomes interrupted for a moment at each oscillation of the pendulum. The advantages of this mode of recording tbe clock-signal8 ovn any in which the gah-anic current traverses an;r portion of the clock itself, or in which the signal!' are 1n·odnced, twcordi11g to Saxton's original plan, by contact with a globule of mercury, have been sufficiently sc>t forth in previous reports, and require no repetition here.
IY.-0BSERVATIONS A'l' Y ALENCU.

Here the Krille clock and transit No. 4 werP employed. I had snppo8c>d all precautions tak·'n to insure t11at the instruments should he in good onler; but, owing prouably in part to the haste with which the ex11edition was orgallized in ·dew of the a-pproach of win1Pr, 1hi8 was not t11e case; and the want of proper condition of both these instrmne11ts, as well as of the minor telegraphic apparatus, much augmented tlie unavoidalJly serious difficulties of the enterprise. Observations were obtained on fifteen nights during our sojow·u at ,-aleJJcia, on no one of which the sky was unclouded. Ou ouly two of the fi,-e nights 011 which longitude sig·nals were exchanged with Newfoundland was it. possib]p, to ohtai1t ohsern1tions after tl1e exeliang(·; and Orn same was possible on only one of the three nights when signals were succe15sfully exchanged with Greenwich. Observations of circumpolar stars for the special purpose of determiniug the intervals of the transit-threads were out of the question. Indeed, there was but one instance when the tra11sit of any star north of GOO decliuatiou was ohse1Ted over all twenty-fiYe threads. In those rare instances when thiR would haye been possible, the stars were needed for determining t11e error of collimation. At the close of the series of observations, it was found that fift~--three complete transits had been observed over all the tlueads; and, since the equatorial inter>als for the same reticule bad been very thoroughly and satisfactorily deduced from an ample series of observations, in 18G0-'Gl, at Pensacola, it appeared that little would probably be gained by an attempt to obtain additional data at Valencia. Indeed, after assorting the thread-internlls deduced from the Yalencia obser>ations into three classes, the accordance of the mean Yalues for these classes showed a probable error amounting to o·.02 of a great circle for but few of the threads. The Pensa<iola values had been deduced from one hundred and twenty-one observations of twenty-one stars, the average declination of nine of them being 75~0. The probable error of but fe\\r of the intervals was as large as o·.005, and the combination of these values with tlaose uerh-ed from the Valencia obsen-atious gfres all needful accurac;v. The Pensacola values were, therefore, reduced to the focal adjustment of the instrument at Valencia, by diminishing each interyal by its three-tl10usandths.11art, and a triple weight assigned to the resultant values. We thus have for the equatorial intervals of the several threads from the mean of all, the following determination:

Levelings of the axis wPre, of course, made mo; frequently as possible, and the correction for inequality of the pi rnts thence deduced is -0".0l:J, the perforated end of the axis being the larger. The value resulting from Pensacola levelings having been -0·.015, the mean of these, or -0".014, is applied to all level readings as a correction for inequality of pivots. On October 27, and after November 5, the transit observations upon which the longitudes depend were made by l\Ir. Mosman alone. On the 2iith and 28th October they were made by myself, and on the 30th, the only other date which enters in any way, however .implicitly, into the longitude determinations, the transits were observed by both of us. This circumstance,, undesirable in itself, was from the necessities of the case not to.be avoided. \Vith these few explanations, and the added remark that the observations for time were, almost without exception, obtained with extreme difficulty in the intervals of clouds and rain, in one of the most unfavorahle climates of the globe. for an astronomer, I give the crude ohservations, as well as their reduction, for the groups immediately preceding and following each series of longitude signals, omitting the others, generally, as needless. The notation ancl methods of observation and reduction are as 1>repared by me for the longitude-work of the Coast Survey some fifteen years ago, and are described in detail, by Mr. Dean, in the appe11dix (p.167) to the Coast Survey Report for 1856. The conditional equations for clock-correction and azimut,h are solved by least squares, after correcting for level-error and clock-rate, the normal equations and resultant values being appended to each group.

REPORT OF THE SUPERlNTENDENT OF
Vll.-LONGI'I'FDl~ SIH:.-!ALS BETWEEN FOILHO::\I:\-IERU~f AND HEART'S 00:'.'!TENT.

·

The method of gh-ing and receidug, the s'guals for longitude between Foilhummerum and Ht·art's Co111eut was that prescribed in the programme which l liad prepared before leaYing home. Three series, of two sets ead1, were exchaIJged on caeh oecasion; each s<it cousi;,;ting, of ten signals, alternatel,Y positiYe aml ncgatiYe, and at interYa]s of about fiYc seconds, except tlmt th<' fifth arnl eight wen· iireceded by a pause of ten i;eeomls, which was ah;o the interYal betwesn the two f!ets. The pnrpose of tl!is arrangement was to discoyer whethm· the velocity of transmission was 'perceptihl,Y afte<'1Pll h_y a longer time being allowed for t,Jrn mt bl1l to rpeover H s elt~ctrical e11uilibrium, and also to faeilitate tlie identification of the indiYidnal Riguals. Some slight conYenience in the practical uetail also arose from the circumRtance that each set occupied one minute, and that each t:ieries corrnisted of ten positin~ and ten negatiYe siµ;uals. Those signals were 1~011siuered positive b;\- >vl1icll tlw Jllntinodc was put in connection with the cable and the zincoile wHl1 tlw ground. In rnceiYing tlw signals the oL;.;erYcr, ()Ir. Dean at :X fl\"fonndlarnl, a11d ms self at Valencia,) watched the !leftt>etioHH of the light-spot, while his thumb relited Oil the button of a delicately aujnsted break-circuit kt·y, wbid1 wa;.; pressed at the instant in which tht:> deft«<'t.ioa was perceiYed. This instant was tlms r<"conkil upon tlw chronograph after a certain amount of dela;\- which we will call tlw personal error of 11oting, arnl wllicll depends upon a cousiderablt> number of influences to be disc·1ssetl hereaftn. The ke,ys hy wliicl1 the signals were transmitted were made by the American Tl'legraph Conq1an,\', nnde1· the superYision of ~Ir. Dean, and are constructetl a{~cording to the arnmgement deTised by Profes8or Thomson for the Atlantic telegraph, in snclt a manner that pressure upou one hnttou produced a posith-e, and upon the other a 11egat,iYe signal, while no current flows at other times. To this arrangenwnt au additional coutriYaiwe was applied hy which the local circuit to the cbronogTaph passe(l throngh thr· same ke~' and w:t8 interrupte<f by pressure upon either huttou, so that the moment of every signal was recorded upon the chronograph of the station 'Whence it was 8t·nt. It is tlms manifeRt that the times of sendiug the signals were accurately recorded, while the times of recei Ying signals were rcconled after au interYal of time dependent on the per8oual error of noting, anil inseparable from the time of transmission through the cable, unless hy some independent means of measurement. If this interval were the sanw for both obserYers, it would bl· eliminated entire],\- from the longitude and merged with the time of transmisRion; otherwise it would affect the rnsultant longitude b~· one-half the difference between the pernoual errors of noting for the two observers. Hap1lily it proYed to he very nearly the same for l\lr. Dean and m:rself, and also mea1-mrable, so that it has been possible to eliminate its influence fmm the measure of Yelocity ~ts well al'l from the longitude. If now we (lenote the clock times at Valencia and Newfoundland h.v T ancl T' respectiY!'ly, the conn<·ction,; for reducing these to the true sidereal time by 6t and 6.V, the thn(' of transmission for the galvanic Rignals by x, aud the longitude hy J.; and if furthermore we distinguish those quantitie8 which pertain to Valencia, signals by a sul~jaceut 1, and similarly those helougfog to Newfoundland Hignal hy the sul~jacent figure!!, it is manif°t'st that if we include in x the 1>ersonal error of' noting signals, then the signals given and recorded at Valencia at the time T 1 will be registered upon the Sewfoundlaml record at T'1 =Ti +6t1 - 6t' 1 -J. + xl! and the signi1Is given and rewrde,<J at Newfoundland at T'2 will be registered upon the Valencia record at T 2 = T 12 + 6 t'2 - 6.t; + x2 , so that the com1larison of the records of Valencia signals at the two stations gives T1-T'1=6t'1-6t1 + ;, + ·r1, while the comparison of the·records of Newfoundland signals givesT2-T'2= 6 t2-6 t2 + ). + x 2, so that 2).=(T2-T'2} + (T1-T'i) + (6t2-6t'2) + (6t1 -6.t' 1 ) (x1 - x2 ) X1 X2=(T2-T'2)-(T1-T'1) + (6f'2-6t'2 )-(6t1 - 6 t11). If we aBsume the personal error of noting to be the same for the two observers and the signals to travel with equal velocity in the two directions, the term x 1-X:z will disappea~ from the first equation 7 while the second will give the mea..oure of the sum of the transmission-times and the personal errors of noting. From the time detennina.tions in Chapters IV and V, we may obtain the elock corrections as

follows, for the periods in which longitude signals were exchanged. They are first given for those epochs for which they were determined, and the interpolated values for intervals of five minutes during the period of the exchanges follow. On November 5, a double weight is assigned to the first time determination on account of the much smaller value of the azimuth error, this ha,·ing been largely changed by an oocident, (due to no carelessness of the observer,) which interrupted the first series of observations.

It is manifest that Lit - :Jt' was in no instance variable during the telegraphic exchanges, so that no correction is needed for the deduced values of x on oocount of difference of clock-rates; and there is every reason to believe, both from theoretical considerations and from special experiment, that the velocity is the same for eastward and for westward signals, and that the resultant .l. is consequently subject to no correction depending upon the clocks.

On the 25th October the cable of 1865 was employed, one half the circuit being formed by the earth. A battery of ten cells was used at each station and "condensers" were interpolated betwoon the battery and the cable. On the 28th October the connections were the same, in every- :respect, as on the 25th; but on three other days the two cables were joined so as to form a ooiuplete uieteJ]ie circuit, the number of elements employed beingNovember 5 .·..···.···.·····.........

Clock-signals were exchanged between these two stations on four nights, upon only two of wbich the clock-errors at Calais could be determined Pither imrnediately before or Roon after the exchauge, one of these two nights being the same on which the clock occasioned so much trouble. It is a source of regret, also, that tlte signals were not exchanged according to the rule laid down in the )Jrogramme, which prescribed that the Calais clock should be imt into the ('.ircuit several times, for not more than half a minute at each time, while the time-scale was graduated for both chronographs by the Heart's Content clock only. I11 this way it would not have beeu (lifficult to obtain both records on the sheets at both stations, with the ordinary connections and without the necessit;y of continual adjustments of the relay magnets, and the results would have been more satisfa<itory in other respects. On the 11th and 12th December, onl;y the first and last signals of the Heart's Content clock in each Il'.linute can be deciphered, but these are legible by reason of the omission of the seconcl-marks corresponding to the beginning of the minute. For the other two nights this difficulty does not exist. The means of the records are appended for the two stations separately. U110u the first two dates, the individual measures from the Calais registers, although nUU!bering but two in each minute, were derived from consecutive minutes.

IX.-PERSONAL ERROR IN NOTING SIGNALS.

Since the signals sent through the telegraphic cable were recorded at the transmitting station upon the chronograph aut-0matically, but at tbe receiving station through the mediation of an observer who noted the deflection of the light-spot from the galvanometer, by sending a second telegraphic signal to bis own chronograph, it will be seen that the interval x, which elapses between the giving of a signal at one station and its chronographic record at the other, may be conveniently divided iuto four difterent parts, viz: the time requisite!. For the signal to arrive at the other station. 2. For the magnet of the galvanometer to be moved through an arc sufficient to be readily perceive.cl. 3. For the observer to take cognizance of the deflection and give his signal upon the break· circuit key. 4. For this observation signal to be recorded upon the chronograph. Each of these four parts comprises the time, appreciable or otherwise, consumed in more than one distinct process; yet this division suffices for all our purposes. If these seveml illtervals be practically equal at the two stations, they become absolutely eliminated in our determination of the longitude. If they be unequal, the resultant longitude will require an increase by one-half the excess of their sum for westward signals. In either case, only their total sum at the two stations is defiermined by the operations for longitude. If we assume that the time lost upon the chronograph circuit is the same at each station, the last of the above-mentioned intervals beoomes eliminated by the comparison of the two records. The second and third depend upon the galvanometer and obse!'Ver at the receiving station, and a.re not easily to be separated from each other in any determination of their amount, but if their sum can be measured, this, substracted from our quantity a:, will aftord a. trustworthy determination of the velocity with which the signals are actually transmitted through the relegraphie cirenit. Thifl sum of the delays, dependent on the -galvanomerer ·and the obtlerver, I ha.ve called "the

Dean availed himself of this means, for measuring the personal error of noting signals, h.r connecting each tilt-hammer with a separate circuit. One of these passed through the normal signal apparatus of tbc clock, the l\lorse register, the signal key, and the galnmometer; the ot,lier, through the 1mhi-;idiary tHt-hammer, the observiug-ke~-, and the chronograph. The original signals 'vere thus recorded on the chronograph sheets, by means of a clockscale graduated to two se,coucls, while the observations of the same were registered upon the :Morse fillet; au<l a slight change made in the connect.ions at the close of the experimeut sufficed to put the records of both tilt-hammers upon the chronograph, and thus permit an accurate measurement of the inten'al between the two systems of clock signals. In the first named circuit a battery of two carbon cells was employed, resistance coil,; being interposed to reduce tl1e deflections of the galvanometer to the magnitude of those obtained through the cable; and the chronograph magnet proved sufficiently sensitive to record these. On November 10 five i>eries of measures gave for his personal error:

3. Greenwich and Foilltmnmerurri.-It has been already stated that the astronomer royal cordially anceded to m~- 1·equest that l1e woulfl take measm·es for the determination of the longitude between Greenwich and our station at Foilhommerum. Tliis request was made with diffidence, since Mr. Air,\· liad already determined the longitude of two otlwr J10ints in Valencia with all pos1:dble care, Feagh l'ifain, the highest point on the island having been measured chronometrically in 1844, and Knightstown telcgn1ii1hically in 1862, so that the cst.aulishmcut of our station at Foilhommerum implied the <letermination of an additional arc in order to connect it with Greenwich, whereas we had hoped to adopt the old station of the astronomer royal at Knightstown~ six miles to tlJe eastward. Tiu~ arrangemPnt.s for the telegraphic interchange of signals with Green wicl1 were made Ly Mr. Airy, and the reductions were executed under his direction at th(· Uoyal Obseryafory, our own share in the work being limited to the operations at Foilhommcrum. Exchanges were attempted on ten nights between the ::>d and 15th November, but were successful only on the 5th, 13th, and 14th. On the last occasion the weather preeluded us from obtaining any observations for time, so that the result depends upon two night exchanges. These pnffed, bowever, very accordant. The clock at each terminus was made to record itself u11on the chronograph at the other for half an hour, and tlie coustruction of the chronographic and signal-1,,'1.Ying apparatus at Greenwich required our clock-signals to be given by closing an open circuit, not by interrupting a closed one, and tlie Greemvich signals to be received in a similar wa;r. To meet this need, tbe relay-magnet was modified, while reeeiving signals, by transferring the conducting stop of the armature to the rear, so that the currents arriving at each second should interrupt the local circuit of the chronograph-magnet like our own clock-signals. And in sending our own signals to Greenwich the connections of the main and local circuits with the relay-magnet thus moclifiecl were respectively reversed, so that an interruption of the local circuit by our own clock produced a closure of the main cireuit, which transmitted a current to Greenwich. Thus, no loss of time was entailed in recei..-ing signals: lmt in sending them au armature-timio intervened between the actual clock-signal and its tra11smis8ion to Greenwich. This was reduced to a minimum b.r strong tension of tlie spring, and two series of experiments were made to measure the amount of the delay. For this purpose the relay-magnet being retained in the chronograph-circuit in the same manner as during t11e tram;missiou of signals to Greenwich, the two terminals of the instrument (which are in permanent connection with tlle armature, and its conducting stop, and which, during the sending of signals are cmmecterl with the two wires of tlie main line) were also lnought into communication with the chronograph-circuit on the two sides of the recording magnet. The effect of this arrangement was that when the clock signal, which is of course recorded upon the chronograph, released the armature of the relay-magnet by interrupting the galvanic circuit, t11is armature on its arrival at the outm sto1) completed a metallic connection by which the chronograph was excluded from the circuit. This was re.corded upon the chronograph, like a second interruption, which continued until the tension of the spring was overcome by the re-established current. In this manner two signals were given in each second, the first by the clock directly, the second by the relay after the lapse of the interva.l re(1nired for the armature to reach the outer stop. Then, if the chronographmagnet be adjusted with all possible delicacy, the length of the record of the total interruption will be increased by the full amount of the d(ilay in question. Series of observations were made for the investigation of this point, on the 4th and Hth of November, and indicat.e a delay of o·.02 in the communication of signals, being equivalent to a retardation of the clock to this amount in the currents sent, though not in their record; and implying a diminution both of the lougitude and of the transmission time by o·.Ol.

The Valencia. observations having been made by, or referred to, Mr. Mosman, throughout the whole period, his personal equation is eliminated; the equation between Messrs. Goodfellow and Dean, always small, may be regarded as trustworthy; and by a happ_y coincidence the personal equations of Mr. Boutelle on the west, and of Mr. Mosman on the east, seem to be almost identical; so that even a total disregard of _this quantity would have resulted very nearl;r in its perfect elimination, the oceanic arc being diminished, and the land arc increased, eaeh hy about 0-.14. The only probable influence of personal equation in the entire longitude measurement, comprising as it does three-sixteenths of the entire circumference, lies in the difference between the observations of Messrs. Dunkin and Bout~lle.

Or in words: the sum of the tnmsmi1;sion-timPs for westward and ea;;tward signals, each increased by thf" error menrred in the proeps;; of recordiug, is equal to the excess of the l'ecordPd interval upon the chronograph at the station whence the first signal was given, increased by the excess in tllC' loR8 of time Ly the cloek at that station during the interval. In our experiments the interval in question rarely amounted to so much as one hundred and sixty set'.onds, and the clock-rates ·were small. The correction due to difference of rates appears never to have surpassed the tl10usandth of a ;;econd; and since it is certainly a quantity of the second order in comparison 1vith the variation in personal error, we may disregard it, and consider the quantity .'X' 1 + ,r2 as the excess in the record, upon the eastern chronograph, of the interyal between tlH, wt~stwar<l aud eastward signals. Or, otherwise state,d, it is t!Je excess for eastward signals, above westward ones, of tlrn difference of time recorded upon the two chronographs. Half of this excess would measure the time required for the transmission and record of a signal assuming the velocit_y to be the same in each direction, could we assume the personal error in noting to be equal for the two observers. This we have, in Section IX, found not to be the case, but happily we have trnstworthy values of the absolute amount of this error for each observer. Deducting the sum of the two errors from the quai1tity x 1 + x 2 , we have determinations of the actual time cornmmecl in one westward and one eastward transmission ; or, if we as;;urne the velocity in each direction to be the same, we have the measure of twice the time required from the transmission of a signal througl1 the length of the telegraphic cable. The trausmission-time as determined for the dates of the several longitude determinations, has been deduced in Section VII, su~ject to a correction for the mean personal error in noting signals, which correction we have in Section IX, found to be 0·.303. Applying this to the results obtained we !Jave the following values for the mean time of transmission of signals upon the five nights when the longitude was determined.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

which promise to become generally accepted as a peculiarly convenient system of electrical measurement. The cable of 1865 gaye* a resistance of 4.01 olnns to the knot; the "insulation," or resistance of the coating, being 2,945 megohms to the knot, and the electrostatic capacity 0.3535 farad to the knot, or about one farad to each three and one-quarter statute miles. The cable of 186() showed for each knot a resistance of 3.89 ohms, and an insulation of 2,437 megohms, the electrostatic capacity being essentially the same as in the other. ' Thus we have in the cable of 1865, as the total resistance to conduction, about 7,650 ohms; as the total resistance of the insulator 1,505,000 ohms; as the total electrostatic capacity about 670.1 farads. In the cable of 1866 the total resistance iR about 7,270 ohms; the total insulation 1,316,000 ohms; the total electrostatic capacity 654.5 farads. The battery emplo:_red b;r tbe telegraph company was oo~a of what are known as Minotti's cells, these being a modified form of Daniell's, in which the zinc rests upon a column of wet sawdust, at the bottom of which is a layer of :,mlphate of copper, and a copper disk heing at the base of all. .l\Iy friend, l\Ir. JH. G. Farmer, to whom I applied for information, found by experiment the electro~n10th'e force of one of these cells to vary from 0.75 to 0.9u, avmaging 0.84 volt; while the average of four Daniell's cells of ordinary construction gave 0.923 volt. Hence he estimated that after the full strength of the current is den·loped, one cell should give on one cable, with earth connection, ahout one hundred and terr farads in a second. The experiments made for measuring the velocity of signals it will be well first to describe in their regular order. On the night of November 1 the first essays were made, after the use of an electromagnet had proYed hopeless, but owing to numerous difficulties incident to a first trial only a few signals were exchanged. These were matle b,Y employing a battery of twenty cells at -Valencia, having its positive electrode to the cable of 18(iG, while the two cables were connected at Newfoundland without battery, and the signals thence were given by alternately breaking and closing the circuit. In the first set no communication was made with earth, eighteen signals from Valencia and seven from Newfoundland being recorded at both stations. In the second the zincode of the battery was connected witli the ground as well as with the cable, and of the signals thus given thirteen from Valencia and three only from Newfoundland were thus recorded. On November 10 tlrn first two series of experiments were successfully made, as previously arranged in the programme, excepting that during the second series the Newfoundland battery remained without ehange, Valencia using four cells and Newfoundland twenty. On November 16 the last two series were carried out with four cells at each station. On the 16th an independent series of experiments was also instituted by causing the cables to be connected without battery at Newfoundland, while signals were given and obi;-erved at Valencia, with resistances of various amo11nts iutroduced iu the circuit, and with _variations in the battery power.
convenient scales in the British Association system, the measures adopted being named in honor of eminent discoverers in electrical science, in accord:mce with a suggestion of Mr. Clark. The mea<inre of electromotive force is 10' f, or one hundred thousand timeM the absolute unit. This has about 0.927 the t.ension of a Daniell's cell, and iR called a rolt. The measure of resistance is 107 r, or ten million times the absolute unit. This is about 1.0456 times the Liemen's unit, and is called an ohm. The measure of quantity iR 10-· q, or the hundred-millionth part of the absolute unit. This is called a farad. Consequently, with a tension of one volt, and a resistance of one million ohms, the quantity of electricity would be one fiaad in each second. Moreo"\""cr, since the volt-fara£1 is 10-3 fq, we have 1,000 volt-farad~= the absolute unit of work, or 9,808 volt-farads per second =the meter-gi·am. · One million of ohms is conveniently designated as a megohm, and one million of farads as a megafarad. ·In the manufactory tlie reRistanees found in each knot, at a temperature of 75° Fahrenheit, were 4.27 and 4.00 ohms for the two cables respccti vely, and the respectiv" insulating capacity of the coverings 349,000,000 and 342,000,000 of ohms to the k1.wt. These data show an increase of conducting power lly six per cent_ for the cable of 1866, and eight per cent. for that of 1866, while the insulation had been increased in the ratios of 8.44 and 7 .13. Hence we may roughly infer the aYerage temperature of the cables to be not far from 5° Centigrade in their ocean bed.

The first question to be irrrnstigated is whether the positfre and negative signals were transmittecl with the same velocit~-. For deciding this no knowledge of the actual time of transmission is requisite, but a simple comparison of the records of the same signals at the two stations will afford an answer. This comparison gin~s m; the inten·al T-T', or the difference of the time indicated at the same moment by the two clocks, diminishPd b,Y tl1e time of transmission, in the case of signals given from Valencia, and increased by this amount for signali; from ~ ewfonrnllaml. This inten·al is a measure of the longitude, uncorrected for clock errors or for transmission time; but for our present, purpose its absolute magnitude is unimportant, since our in(111ir.r is answered by comparing_ the results deduced from positive and from negath·e signals with each other. Any excess in the time consumed in the Jlassage of either clast\ of signals should mauifost itself by a su1)erior value in the measures of the temporary clock-difforence deriYed from that class, when the signals are sent westwardly. For eastward signals the reverse holds_ It had been intended, as will be seen b,y the original programme, to measure the velocity of signals while the batterie,.; at both t_>nds were included in the circuit, as well as when only one was employed; but since the construction of the signal-kPys rendered this arrangement difficult, and incom·enient in many respects, the plan was not carried out. In all cases the batteQ· at the receiving-station was cut off from the circuit. Consequently all our experimeuts may, as far as regards the point now in question, be arranged in four classes, according to the character of the ground connection. 'Vhen, as in the last three of these classes, both cables were included in the circuit, those siguals are called positive which put the copper of the Yalencia batterJ· to tbe cable of 18G5, or the copper of the Newfoundland battery to the cable of 186G.

Our mean Yalucs have here been recorded to thousandths of a second, a degree of precision which is of course only nominal, since tlw accuracy attainable by the mode of obserYatiou employed would scarcely warrant any reliance upon the second decimal for the mean of a number of observations m1rn!J largn than teu. Yet if this he borne in mind no misapprehension can result from the employment of three decinmlR, while on the otl1e1' hand this affonh; a reci1uocal control in the figures. It is manifest that, if we disregard the signals gfren from Valencia while the zincode was connected with the gTound on the 10th November, all the differences are of an order of magnitude wliichjustities the assumption, already probable from theoretical considerations, that the positive and negative signals travel '\\ith equal velocity under the same circumstances. This assumption I will therefore make, postponing any n·marks concerning the discordances manifested on November 10. The speed of the two kind8 of signals being thu8 taken as the same, under simi1ar circumstances, the time required for their transmission is easily deduced, being one-half the difference between the measures of longitudes from the records at the respective stations. The weak point in our determination is, of course, the absence of any automatic record of signals received; but the considerations already presented iu the chapter on the personal error in noting signals, afford ground for confidence that the uncertainty here introduced is com1Jaratively small, and that the aggregate personal error of the two ob1;enTers is very close to 0·.606. This ·value is adopted in the present investigation, and all the measurements hereinafter recorded, with which this personal error is merged, have been corrected by deducting this quantity. Then for a circuit formed by both cables, without earth connection, we have the following determinations of the sum of the times of transmission for eastward and westward signals derived from the last three series of longitude determinations, and from the second a.nd fourth series of special experiments.

REPORT OF TIIE srPERINTENDE.NT OF

Let ns now eonsider the experiments made wit110nt any eart11 corrnect.ion 1vhatever: :First, thm;p of N1wP11ilwl' ;) anrl lG, 011 which occasions the batter~· power at the two stations was the same. Ea\'11 ,;tation .-;Pllt si,::·ualt' with a battery of three .Minotti's cdls 011 the 5th aml four 011 the l()th, re<'ei ,·ing them with its lmttE"r,r <liseouuected. Tlie circnmstauC'eN at the two stations were as near!~· idP11tien1 as possible, and tlw mean interval consumed in the transmission of tht> siguah; app(·ar.'\ to han· !wen 0 8 .29 Oil the former and 0 8 .20 OU thl' latter ocem;ion. \Vith n hatt<'ry of three Minot.ti's cdls, each possessing a tensiou of 0.8! of a Yolt, and ineapalllc of g1~1teratiug more than 110 farads to the second, when circuit was made through earth and one cable ouly, the maximum permanent cnrrcut wonld not. exceed lu8 farads in tlie joined cables, and to deYelop nin<'-tenthR of this current, more than oiw ancl a quarter seconds would be 1wedctl. vYith three Danit>ll',.; cells, the maximum current would not exceed 185 farads. Assnrndl;r we cannot 8Uppose that iu tlH· lap8P of t11ree-tenths of a second, whPn not more tha11,oue-sPYenth of this current had been deYelopl'd at t ht' fartlwr station, this battery conl<l han~ charged the two joined cables, each of which possessed an electrostatic capacity of more than 650 farads. Hence the impu1i>e upou which the transmission of tlw signal de1w111ls must lrnYe lleen propagated along the conductor hy some other means than by charging its successiye parts dectric~nny, i. e., fully and in the onlinar,v sens of this expressiou. The thirty farads, more or less, whid1 eoultl h:cne been generated before the signal arrinid at the distant extremity of the cable,,, would }raye been consumed in charging th·· first six or l"PYe11 lmncht>dths of the conductor. Dnriug my Rtay at Yalencia, messages were effectively and distinctly tranRmittcd in each direction hy tlw use of a11 electromotor formed by a small pen:nssion-cap containing moistened E:and, upon which rested a particle of zinc. The currPnt here e\Tolyed could scarcel~T have amounted to morn than six or seYen farads, so that nearl,\- two minutes would have been requisite for cliarging one cnhl<~. Yet the transitio11-ti111e was certainl,y small, although it wa:-; uot definitely measured. The experiments without earth-cmrnection ou :Xo,·ember ii and 9, differed from those of the 5th and Uth or1l:y in that the N ewfoundlaud battery consisted of ten cells instead of the same number aH was emplo_vt·d at Valencia. The mean times of trausmissiou were respectiyely 0'.25 arnl 0".24, indicating an incrc~a8(1 of speed with the increase of electromotiY power. And so faT as th expe1·iments on these four days am concerned, we might infer that on the complete metallic circuit formrnl b.r the two cables the time required for transmitting t11e ;.;iguals through about 3,4i5 kilometers, or 2,rno statute miles, was not far from o·.29 for a battery of three cells, 0".26 for one of four celll'I, and 0·.215 for one of ten cells. 011 the other ltaud, the transmission-time for signals sent by a current reduced on a, siIJgle cable, lly means of a "condenser" witl1 a battery of ten cells, was on the average 0·.31 on the 25th and o·.:~4 on tlie 28th October, thP mean interval for these two days being 0".328. Each of thecontlensers used possessed an electrostati<· capacity of auout tweuty f:uads; so tl1a.t with a tension often cells, or 8.4 volts, tlwir capacity would be not far from 168 farads, or equal to that of about 590 miles (fM.'i kilometers) of cable; or, in other words, a little more than one-quarter of the capacity of 011(' whole caule. The Y:tlne of those experiments in which the batteries were connected with the earth is seriously impaired b;v the series of mistakes made at Newfoundland on the 10th Novemller. On that day twenty 1~t'lls weTe used iustead of four, aml the pre&',rilied connection of the battery with the ground was forgotten, so that both the electromotive and the electrostatic Telations became t-Oo complicated for any sate inforenceB as to the results. But apaTt from these, some other grave error appears to have been committed, by which we arc apJ>arently led to the singular result that the average time consumed in the transmission of signals was 0°.31 for the positive and only 0·.24 for the negative signals, although the only difterence between these classes consisted in an interchange of electrodes relatively to the two cables, and although the transmission-time for the two cables is shown by all our other experiments to have been practically equal. The only reason which I can discover for any difference between these two kinds of signals soom·s inadequate to explain the phenomenon, yet it ought not to be overlooked. lt is t.his: Tbe construction of the signal-keys was such, that in the only manner in which it was safe to use them for these experiments, the battery circuits remained connected with the cables at the receiving station. The cables were connected with each other without the battery, and the battery

In the experiments of Xm·ember 10, the zinc of the fonr-t·Pll battexy at Yah>ncia waf\ prm·ided with au earth connection, while the twenty-cell hatt.cry at X Pwfonu di aud wa!' imml at Pel. A ml since tl1e galvanom(>ter at each terminm; was 8ituated upon that cable to which tl1(· plati11odt' wm· applied for those signals which we term riositivP., some difference must lrn ve exi8tml in t!w aetion of tlw two classes of signals from Xew·foundland upon thP Valencia g-alYanorrwter; for tlw Xt'-wfrmn<lland signals would t"xert a tension 011 the cable of 186() wl1ich, m1 -reaching Ya1t'1l!'ia, might ~wt for :111 instant inductively upon tlw local circuit, before the dynamic equilibrium of tllt' maiu drc·nit ;.;Jumld be establishP.d by means of thP opposit<· tension upon the otht'r ca hie and the Rignal tlrns t'X11ihit4.'d upon the Valencia galnrnometer. Ob,·iously, wht·n the g-rourHl connection was madP witl1 tl1t> zinc of the Valencia hatter;\-, this diHturhi11g aetion would bp, the greakst for tbos!' signals of w!Jich the tension would thus be for a moment partially neutralized, namel,Y, for the iwsith-t~ 8ignals.

No other explanation than this has suggm;ted itself, and though~ a" alr'<'all;\· statl~tl, t hi::; smucel;\appears adequate, it would yet derive some color from the al1t-1e.uct· of an,Y analogous <liffereuceR for the two classes of signals in the first experiment of the t-1a111e day, in which tlw gnmml t·o1111e<'tion was made to the middle of each uattery. On the other hand, a similar though iuferior diftl>n·nct~ does exhibit itself in the third experiment, when· no earth eoutact wa,._ made, all(l it iH safer to ass11me Ronw additional and yet. uudiscoYered mistalrn in tlw arr:111gpme11i ol' tl1e co111w.ction;; a.t. Newfoundland, and therefore to di::;card the obRerYations of Ntn-ember 10 a1to~:-etlwr, th au to attempt to draw· any inferences from them. These would contradict tlte experiments upm1 other da;ys, when the corrnectious were managed somewhat more effective1y, although not without mistake8 ill the Newfoundland batteries on both the 6th and 9th N°'·ember. · On Noyember 16 all the arrangements seem to ha,·e been correctly made, each batter~~ consisting of four cells, arnl t1w e:nth conneetions at, both stat.ions hei11g made with the zincodt'S iu tile second experiment and with the middle of the batteries iu the third. ln the former case, all the positiYe signals found earth at the other extremity of their respective cables without affecting the other cable at all, and therefore without uumifesting· thc~mseh-e8 upon the galYanometer at the distant station, whil1~ negative signals, which differed from the positive ones only by an interchange of the cables ust'tl for the respeetiYe eh't~trodes, \Yere 01' coUl'8e receiYe<l and recorded. Thus we hitve on this occasion only the" negatfre '' signals, L c., those iu which tl!e platinorles went to the cable of 1866, at Valencia, and to that of 1865, at Newfoundland. In the latter case the effect of the arrangement would be to substitufo two circuits, each consisting of one cable with two cells at each extremity, and earth connections for the one circuit formed by a cable with four cells at the signal-gfring station and earth corrnection;.;, wen· it not that a very small portion of ea.ch of the two first-named circuits is common to tlw two, beiug formed hy the piece of metal which unites the short circuit of' the local hatt,1~rs with thP t·.ounectetl or "looped" cal>les.

The results of the r<'('orckcl signals give o·.26 as the transmission time through one cable with earth rPturu wlic~n tlw ground con11eetion was macle with thP zinc, and OS.27 when it was made with tlw middle of tlie lmtter:r, the former COITPspomli11g to the use of fonr cells at one station ouly, and t.ltP latter to t\YO (~ells at Pach. Passiul--!· next to the con:-ideratiou of the yelocit;y of signals given by closing and interrupting the circuit, which for eouvenience we will term "make-circuit'' and "break-circuit'' signals, we. have some data for tlle inn~Rtigation from the first and third Retfr,~ of expel'imeuts. For tlie first series tlw battery was at Yalencia, and the Rigna1s from :N"ewfoundlancl were necessarily gi,·en by making nn!l breaking the circuit of the battery at the other f.ltatiou, or, in the language of telei.,·Taphers, se1Hling sig11als against the current. For the third 8eries the reYerse was the cm;e, and the Valencia siguals were sPnt hy nwans of the cmTent from Newfou mlla 11d. In hotb instm1ces the signals from the battery station wen· gi>en in tht> usual way by the alternation of op11osite currents. That such au arrangement \Yas ill adaptt·cl for any important electrical iuvestig:ation is ma11ift!'st; but the few experimPnts made were of course entirt>ly iml)()rdinate to the object of the ex1wdition, and, as wilJ lie SN'n from the programmP, were Yery crmlely indicated in adnmce. The tota11,y different charnctn of fltP metJwrls mul applimwes from those wllkh hac1 come within the preYious experience of our longitude parties, a,.; well m; the very rliffPrent nomendatun·, rendered telegrat1hi<" instructions difficult. ambigno11s, a]l(l, as the eyent JH'OYed, often iueffPctiYe. The circu11Jstaue1·8 umlt>r which 0111· few sirnph· trials "'en· made were embana1>sing-, in spite of the COI'dial interest aud fricudJy assistarn·e of t11e gelltlt·mf'n of tht' teh'gTapliic 8taff on both sides of the ocean. Thf' cables were in near],\- constant llem:rnrl for ('Omniercial purposes, although all facilities were aecorded which I couM <·01rndentiousl~- ask. .!~ iwvertheless appeared desirnhle to make such few essays at measuring tlie time of trausmissiou as opportunit,y conyeuit>ntly allowed, in the liope that at least i;:;omet11iug of iut<·n'Rt might prO\e d1·<111cilile. Aud it will he pPrceiYPl1 tliat our own experience could not l>e made aYailable at the time, inasmuch aR any inferenceR mu8t hP drawn from measurementR all(l co1lati011 of d1rnnogTaphic reconfa which could only be brought into juxtaposition by some 3,000 mileR of transportation. Our data; tlms obtained, for the relatfre velocity of the makt!-cll'cuJt aml break-circuit signafa, leads to tllP singular faferenee that the latter traveled most raJJidly in the cmie of ~ewfoundland signals wi1.lt Valencia battery, while for the Valencia signals wi_t11 Newfoundland batte-rytl1ereverse was the case. 1''or thi8 I ha ye no explanation to sug·gest. It has been impossible for me to shake off a SllS}Jieiou tl1at the 1-mme error in connectim1s whidt occasioned the c1i8COI'{lance of Noveml~r JO, H1ready alluded to, may ]Jaye acted to produce the discrepancie8 here manifested; but 1 will <·onfine m;...-:,;elf to a statement of the re,;ultR, and leaye any possible reconciliation of the discrepancies to the future. TherP are two wa,\-s in which the relative veloeity of tlte two classes of signals may be examined. OnP is 11.r compm·ing the Yalue.s of the approximate longitude, as given by the make-circuits and break-circuits i·espectiYely, for which purpose all corrections for clock-error and rate may be clisregarcled. f\ince they affect both determinations alike. The other is by deducing the aggregate transmission-time for each kind of signals taken together with the corresponding ones sent in the oppol'ite direction. This latter method permits the employment of a much larger number of observatious, and hy nRe of the Yalue of the transmission-time for positive and negative signals, as pre,·iunsl;\~ llPtlur~eil, it allows a tolerably approximate measurement of the actual time fm· tlie Rignals in (jllf'l'ltiou. The former gives onl;'o- the difference of time consumed hy the two classes respectively, bnt it atforrls measures of this difference free from the influence of extraneous sources of error. l will statP the results ii:om each of these methods. Bt>ginuing witl1 that first named, it will readily be perceived t11at an excess in the approximate longitudes, as tlt>thtct>d from make-circuit signals, indicates an inferior velocity for these when the signal:;; an· from tht· west, but a superior velocity when they are sent from the e:tst. Yet such an excess is here mauifesteil iu both cases, as will be seen from the appended table.

made in battery power and in the connections for the purpose of observing the effect upon the transrni81'ion tirnf'. I haYC no acces8 to the recordR of these experi mfmts at prei;;ent, hut the rP8nlts have in f!'!'Ueral i;;ho\YU that with a well immlated line of uncoated iron wire of the Rize ordiuarily employed,* the earth forming half th<' drnuit, the time required for the signals to reach their destiuatio11 is not far from 0'.07 for each thousand miles, or, roughly, that their velocity is 22,000 kilometer:-; to thl' secoud. Tlw necessary interpolation of repeaters between Heart's Content and (:alais predude& any determination of the velocity of tlrn electrieal action, but tl1e average inten>a] of time consumed in the passage of a signal betwf'cn these two stations was 0".277, he rlistance heing 1,0~)0 miks, aud four rcpcatcrn being interposed. During the intcn'als between the signals, the electrical condition of the cable was undisturbed, and no ex:tra11eous influence prevented its return to a state of equilibrium. Tlrn Rignals were a <Jtmrtcr of a senmd loug, as nearly as might be, and interYals of five Oi' of ten seconds elapsed between the successive signals, each pa.fr of" sets" having fourteen iutenrals 5· each aud five intervals of 10·. Upon no one of the fiYe longitude nights was there any direct connection hetwee11 tl1e cable and the earth. The two extremities of the cable were connected with condensers on the :!5th and :!8th October, and all signals on tho&e occasions were therefore given by induction only; while on the 5tb, Gtb, and 9th .XoYemher a complete circuit was fbrmerl l>.r the two cables, and the battery at the recc·idng station was short-circuitl'!l. On these last three nights tht~ two cables were not connected at the stmdiug station during the intervals between tlw signals, but the batter.Y was short-circuited there also. Tlms the calJles were alwa,ys resmniug their equilibrium between the signals during each of the :five 11ights when the exchanges for longitude were made, there being upo11 tlw :first two nights only one length of cable used, but upon the last three a double length, through which the adjustment of the perturbation was to he effected. I will gi ,-e the results for these fiye 11igl1ts in tl1e same form in which they were first present,ed, viz: The mean diftereuce between the records of the same signals UJ)Oll the two registers heing the rc8ultant value of the longitude, uncorrected for clock errors or for transmission time. The 2h 52m whidt are common to all can be here omitted, only the second;; and fractions of a sccontl being 1we(lful for our purpose, and the signals are assorted according to the length of the interval which imrue(liately preceded. On each date three series of twenty signals each were sent from each station, lmt 110L a.ll were received. The average number upon which the several nilnes for each day aetually depend is sixteen positive and twenty-two negative after the JiYe-second intervals, and six positive and five negative after the ten-second intervals.

It iH thus manifest that in general a longPr time waH required for the transmission of signals after an interYal of tt·n seconds than after an inten·al of five seconds. In those cases where no earth-counection existed, and the. signals were alternatel;r positive and negative, the eable was meauwbile resuming itH electrical equilibrium, so that, a positive signal was transmitted more rapidly through the conductor when it mu1 affeeted with a larger amount of negative electricity, mid a npgatiYe signal more rapidly througlt '"conductor containing more positiYe el('ctricity. This afford;; 11ew tP8timony to the erroneous character of the 1mpy1osition that the conductor must be charg'ed tl1rongh any J10rtion of its length in order to transmit a signal be;\-ond this portion. As i,;howing the continue<1 existence of currents (doubtless engaged in re-establisbing equilibrium) dnriug- the interrals between the signals, it. may be of interest to mention that on one occasion, when the two cables had hfwn joined at Heart's Conte.nt without battery, and while the ,-alP11eia !Jattery had been temporarily disconnecte.d, signals from Newfoundland were distinctly recein;d, They wne weak, and the deflections of the needle were scarcely one-fifth as large as usual, ;vet they were none the less tlistinct, and a complete se.t of signals, ten in number, at 1noper iuterYalR :n1d ineceded hy a "rattle," was recoguizell at Valencia.

From these experiments it may fairly be concluded1. That there wmi no real <lifi'erence in the interval for the make-circuit and the break-circuit sig1rnls. The mean from the first four experiments gin~8, after application of the coITectious for pass-time of the kPy, an iuten·al of o·.261 for the make-circuit8 and 0".2GO fbr the break-circuits. 2. That the rl·lative positions of key, ga1vanomdPr1 aml battery exerted no percevtihle influence upon the result when a battery of four cells >Hts en11>loyecl. The mean intervals from the :first two and from the second two experiments are o·.258 an<l o·.2()2 rcspectiYe1_r. 3. That no a)JJH'Peiable effect was produced by the interpolation of 126 ohms resistance. The mean interntls, with awl without this resistance, were o·.258 and 0'.:W:~. 4. That no marked diminution of the interval was produced by an increase of the batte~- from two to ten cells. The n·sults with one cell, although untrustwortlry, indicate a somew11at lm;s iutnYal. The others Yary hy less than their probable errors, yet the interval was certainly not greater with two cells than with t.en. l:i. I·'rom the last three experiments it would appear that the interval was slightly longer after resistances above 250 ohms had been introduced. Yet it was uo longer in tlle twelfth experiment, when the resistance between the key and galvanometer was more than two-thirds greater than the whole resistance of the two joined cables, than in the eleventh, when it was only one-sixth as great as that of the two cable,;. G. We have every reason for believing that, in all these twelve experiments, the measures of the intervals were merely determinations of my own personal equation in noting signals, which, as has been shown in Section IX, had been found by special investigation to be about o·.275. The variations from this value amount in but few cases to more than ± OS.03, which we have seen to be the normal range. 7. These experiments are entirely confirmatory of what would have been anticipated from theory, viz; that a signal given by closing a galvanic circuit is transmitted in both directions simultaneously an<l with equal velocity under similar circumstances, so that under no ordinarily practicable eircumstanoos oonld a signal from either station fail to traverse both parts of the circuit at that station before passing on to the other.

Since the investigations* in 1850 to which I have alluded, the progress of science Jia-; thrown light upon many point;.; which \Yere then suhjP.cts of doubt or of iudi.-i1lual opiuion. The· condition of an open g·ah·auic circuit is now almost nninm;ally conceded not to he cc;.sentially different from that or an interrupted cornluctor to an electrical machine. 'l'lw velocit.v of a cnrrcut Ls :ihm known to lw depemle11t upu11 its <purntit,\-, and thl·refore gl'IH'rall~- npon ito; i11tp11sity as \n·ll as npou the resiRtance of the conductor. But it appP~us qnt>Rtion<1chlP whcUier tl11· 1:rn- is so simple a" l1as lJpe11 supposed by some who luwe regarded the velocity as iu ,·ersel;-- proportional t\I tlw capacity of the conductor multiplied hy its resiRtance, and then'fi1rc in a homogeneous c01ulnetor to the K(]nare of 3 length. J?or the problem, a8 it now pn·snuts itflelf, dr>('fl not pertain 1';0 mueli to tlH' tiuw for trmrnmis,.,iou of a given signal, as to the time for its transmissiou with a t'e1tain forcP-dPJWIL<ling 011 the srnsith-eness of the n·1·.eid11g- apparatus; since the eh~<·trical impuh;e or di,.;h1rkmce cnnsist'< of a continuous series of molPcular iuttnern~es which propagate the1m;ehes in (·,·ery possihk di Teet ion according to the inYer1>e ratio of tlicir st·Teral resistances. And the form of the cm1dnctor as well as other con(litiom; may et",;eutially modi{Y the tinw r<"quisit(· for the attaiunwnt of t11e prescribed face at the ot11er extrf'mity of tlw Jin(·. A <'nrrent may thus lw tempornril;i.- <'staulisl1ed in part of :rn op('ll circuit, eontinning until tlw batter,\· and conductors have attained an electrostatie equilibrium. The time Teqnired for attaining thiR equilibrium dPpernls of course Rim11ly on tlw capaeit,v and form of the cou!luctors an(l on the energy of the battery; but the first electrical impulse ma,\reach the most remote point of the circuit hefore a portion 1warest to the hatter;'\- l1as received it.fl full charge. Similarly in a clmied circuit the distant extremit,v of the litH' may \n·ll be suppol'ed to perceive some slight p)ectrical <list.nrllance from a signal beforP its full foree is mm1ifr·ste<l at intermediat~ points: 110 ihat a signal might be recei;-Pcl with a delie~1tP g-ah-a.11ometer at the further extremity before it could be recognized upon an electro-magnet at lla1f the distance; aml this, too, apart from any conl'ideratioJJ of increasing iuteusity in the electromotor. The circuit formed hy the two cahles might, although broken at Valeneia, tlmR Sf'TY(' to establiRh what woulcl practieallr be a lllouientar.'· current at Newfonudlarnl, when the 11atter.r at that station was introduced~deftec~ting the gah·anometer there for an instant; anu the change of statical conditiou in the cables a.t YalPncia wonlll tlterenpon he manifest to the ele1·trmwope. B11t. tl1e closure of circuit at Valencia would he ac·1·om1nmied h,r instantmwous dt>fie<'tion of the gah-auomet<·r with corresponding ins(·nsihility of the electroscope. Thu:-: a signal gin~n Ly closing or interrupting an immlated circuit. at any uoint is iustantaneously transmitted from that point ill lloth directions, mHl at full speed, but the inten·al before it. attains its total force at any other point must depr>ml upon the character of the iuter,·eniug conductor. The que,.,tion al" to the route by which signals are transmittetl when part of the eircuit is formed by the earth is tlms disposed of; and the poRition maiutaiuell in the memoir ahoYe cit.eel seems entirely corrobOl'ated, wliile it loRcs its theoretical signifieauce. Prof't·ssor Kulm fo liis h·arned and valuable Handlmch der Elektricitiitslehrc,t while doing the fullest justiee to the former i11Yestigatfon in other respects, has taken exception to the propriet;r of m;y inferences rt·garLling this question ; but careful reconsideration lms failed to conYince me of any fhiw in the argument, sut·h as it is, notwithstanding my distruRt of any reasoning from which so eminent a IJh_y8icist woi1ld disio;ent. Our experiments with the cables are inadequate for any decided detlnctions reganliug the n·lative velocity when the earth forms a part of the circuit, but it may be well to examiuc for a moment what they appcm· to indicate. The transmission-time for the several signals in our exchanges of NoYember 10 and 16 mar be approxinmtely determined hy a methotl different from those which we lmve thus far employed. Since the experiments occupied lmt a comparath-ely short thm~ on ead1 of these days, we may suppose the clock errors to have remained coustant during each series. Then from t.hose experiments in which no earth connection WllS made we may deduce the constant difforf'uce of tlie two clocktimes; and a comparison of this quantity with the difference of clock-times a;.; deducible from any set of signals will afford a nettr approximation to the actual time of transmission.

Jl,fr. Barnard, member of the Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, pre~ident of Columhia College and of the :Mining School of Nt~w York, has prese11ted an iron meter belonging to tl1e J>liilrnmphieal Society to the Conservatoire Imperial dPs Artl' et MMfors, ~tnd has rPquested a comparison of this meter wit 11 i hr original pla.tina standard in the possession of the Consen-atoirc, whicl1 it:i specially reseryed for intnnatimial verification. General Morin, director of the Conservatoire, having acceded to his ·reqtlest, M. Tresca, engineer sub-director of this csta.bli:-.;luncnt, was direct.cu to 1nak(' the verifications, which, aft.er several preparatory operations, were mad!' on Saturd:iy, Augmit 2±, 18UI, in the presence and with the assistance of l\Ir.

The two extremities retain the marki'i of the file, but they both appear to have been slightly oxi<lize<l. The principal face bears thn~e impressions of the stamp which was affixed to the platina meters and kilograms executed b~' the commission of tlw ;year VII. This stamp is an ellipse covered upm1 thme-fonrtfo; of it,; surface with lrnclmres; the remaining fourth is plain, and has near its edge the number 1.0000000, aml the trace in dott,ed line of the mean radius. This last indication, which had not beeu previously observed, has since been found upon the other articles which bear the impression of the same stamp, and which belong to the Conscrvatoirc Imperial des A.rts et l\foticrs. Two of these elliptical im1nessions ai·p placed at om.10 and om.12 from one of the extremities of the bar, mul the third at 0"'.10 from the other end.

The extreme variations during the observat.ions being comprised between 1030.82 and 103°.17, have never exceeded 00.37; and this remark confirms the conclusion as to exactness which was drawn from the identity of the means. The readings of the mercurial thermometer, plunged in the melting ice, were only noted as an accessory meam; of verification. 2. As the positive differences of the micrometer readings correspond to an increase in length, and each diYisfon represents one-thousandth of a millimeter, the United States meter is longer than the platina meter of the Conservatoire by om=.ooo 07. 3. The official report of the 5th March, 1864, which establishes the difference between the original platina meter of the Conservatoire and the original meter of the archives, an exemplar of which is hereunto annexed, having shown that the meter of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers is too long by omm.003 29, the valµe of the United States meter is determined to be 1m,OO{) 003 36 at the temperature of melting foe.

XEW MERIDIAX IN,O:TRI')IENT J:'OR TIME, LATITUDE. AND AZIMFTH. BY GEORGE DAYIDSON, ASSISTANT l'.KITED STATES COAST srHYEY.

The transit wa8 1>laeed in the meridian, and ouRen·atio11R for instrumental an<l clock corrections made therewith; the transit was tlwu rnplnced by the zenith telescope for latitude obscrYatiorn.;, which generally embraced tweln' pairs of star>:. 111 1.-;;;;~ this ilut,\ lP1l to tlw proposition to secm·e a fine 1evel to one of the fillders of the transitto adu a micrometer with Ycrtical mon'mcut of the horfaoutal thread, so that after the completio11 of tLe transit 00Re1·yatiomi tbt· smut· iuRtrument would he at Orn'.e antilahle for the latitude ollserYations liy tlw.zpnith tekt1eopc nwthotl. This i1n-01Yetl tlu' lifting of the teh·seo1ie from its bearings after till' ohservatiou upon the first star, and n·Yersiug the transit axis and llireeting the telescope to the l'iH llll' zen itl1 1lista11ce. 011 the oppositP sidP of tlie zenitlt. In Janua.ry, 18i"ii-l, drawing,,; of such an instrument with additional 11ovelties ·weTe made for the Su1Jeri11tt·u<leut of the l\ntRt Survey, antl are on file in the an~hives. In the geographical reconnaissaiu:e along the coast of Alal'ika in 1807 the peenliarities of the dimate proved that rnvidity of adjustment aucl of ob:;eryaf.ion were essential to success; and a study of tlw question lf·<l to thP present form of irnstrmneut, whereby the zenith telescope is ahandone11, as tlw new meridian instrument combines all the e;;;sentials of the transit and zenith instru111e11ts-affordi 11g means for Hit~ accurate determination of the instrumental an<l clock eorrections, for the determination of the latitude hy med1lional zenith distances, and for the determination of the astrnuomical azimuth of a g·i,~en mark b.r obserYations upon a close circ1unpohtT star at all,\' l10ur angle. Tht· main idea in thii'l new form is that the horizontal frame of the transit stand is divided into t'vo part1< lwl'izo11tally-that the upper part, for carrsing the supports of the transit axis, moves on tlrn lower par't 1,,.,, rnemrs of a short lmt large central vertical axil<; that tbe lower })art carries the foot screwR; tLat the two can be :finnly clamped together direct1," over each other, or when making a moderately small angle with each other, (l;jO or 200;) and that the ends of the frame are parts of the same C'.ircle with graduations upon the lower and a vernier upon the upper frame. The n·rtical axis ha.s an internal aperture of nenrly thr<Je inches, by which collimations can hl· malle with a trough of mercury beneath. One of the hearing8 has a movement in azimuth of two degTe1·s with a :lirwl,l" graduated micrometer screw to me:umre the amount of movement. The telescope h<ts two tinders, one larger than the other, aml furnished with a delicate level for the latitude obserrntions. It has also a fine micrometer capable of read,y adjustment in the vertical or horizontal planes. lu order to measure the inelination of the transit axis when the telescope is pointing at or near the zcnitl1, where the ordinary striding level is unavailable, a hanging level has been devised for that imrpose. The first advantage of tlie double frame is the greater Tapidity with which the instrument can be a<\justed in the vlane of the meridian, or in the plane of the vertical of a close circumpolaT star; for when once leveled no change of position of the lower frame is required, and re11eated levelings ath~r each ap1>roximation arl~ avoided. The tele8Cope, earried by the upper frame, is moved smoot.l1ly ~iml rnpi<lly in searching for the star, which, when found, is followed with regularity until within reach of the azimuth screw. 'l'he two frames are then strongly clamped togethn by four large capstan-beaded steel screws. After the tra.nsit observations are finished stops are adjusted between the upper and lower frames,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 9.
ON THE USE OF RAILWAYS FOR GEODETIC SURVEYS BY .J.E. RlLGARD, ASSlSTANT IN THE COAfiT SURVEY.

For a imrvey of an extended area of the earth's surface, the trigonomctrieal method has hitherto been the onl~' one 1wacticed with success, and indeed is the only one which it has been possible to apply with the desired precision. In a country with irregular surface tmversed by ranges of hills, the lineal measurPme11t of distant'es is, if not altogether impracticable, at least atten<led with a great sacrifice of time, money, and precision, while the trigonometrical method is facilitated hy the inequalities of the ground. \Yben the heights are wooded, but little clearing is generally required to make the stations intervisible, and in long-settled countries Yery little dHticulty has been met with from its obstruction of forests, because tl1e arable land has long been cleared. Bven over the extensive open plains of Hm1sia and India, triangulations ha,-e been carrie<l by means of eleYated st111ctures iu preference to lineal measurement, which, without special preparation of the ground, would have heen slow and tedious. \Vhen, however, a tfat country, covered in good part with dense forest, is to be surveyed, the trigonometrical method is attended with great difficulties. In addition to structures sufficiently high to o··ercome tl1e inequalities of tlw ground and the curvature of the eartl1, lines of sight rnqnire to lte opened through the woods, aud the work of the axeman becomes a serious item of expenditure. On the cmtst-liue of the C"nited States long lines of sea-bead1 occur, closely bordered in-shore by clense forest, often growing out of impassable swamps, throngll which the opening of lines is nearly impracticable. In such case8 the method of direct lineal measurement has been resorted to with good success. The distances were measured with the apparatus <lescribed in the Uoast Surve.r Report for 185i, (Appenuix No. 41\) between points as far apart as the configuration of the sh1>re would permit; the angles between sncce8sive lines were measured with a theodolite, and the directions carried forward by measurement of angles between points as far distant as they could be made intervisible. In the measuring apparatus as described, bars of fimr meters in length were used, but it hao; since been fi:mnd in practice that bars, six meters long, can be mauipulated with sufficim1t ease, and by their use the work is proportionally expedited. Still, the measurement with rods is at best a slow proeei-;i-;, compared with the rapidity with wl1ich it ma,y he effect.ell by a wheel prodded 'With a register of revolutions. For reconnaissanees, the wheel of a wagon has been extensively used; for more accurate mappii1g, that of a wheelbarrow, more or less equipped with means for recording the changes of direction and }(>yet. But, for workR comparable in precision with the results of triangulation, it is requisite that the wheel should run on a smooth, unyielding track, and that there should not be frequent changes of din'dion, which, wheo the;r do occur, 11m..,;t he kept account of with all 1wacticable accunw,Y. The iron track of railways affords the necessary conditions for the suc<~esl'!ful use of the nwmmring-wl1eel, while, by a natur~tl i-;equence, the roads have straight lines of considerable length and few curves in rcgiomi where the absence of hills renders the use of the trig·onometrical method llitlieult. l n mm\y of the States of the Uuion that lie west of the Allegheny Mountains, the execution of u trig01iomt>trical snrYe,V, as a basis for a correct map of the country, woultl be a hopeless undertaking iu th!' pre:,;e11t :;;tate of its culti\-ation. But a careful measurement of the railway lines traYersing it in enr.r clirection, accordiug to the methods which it is here proposed to develop, would afford a network not inferior iu accura-0y, and well calculated to furnish valuable additions to our kuowh~dg·i of tl1e figure of tlle earth if a proper system of determinations of latitude and longitude wen· eorubiued with it. Irrespec\th'e of the object of obtaining data for a correct map of the country, the metllods here propose<! are especi.aHy a11apted to the measurement of arcs of Jlarallels or meridians-geodetic work I>roperly Hpeakiug-a matter in which we are, as a people, greatly in arrears~ the demands of modern civilization.

The lineal Yahw of fl completk' rc>volution i'> best ascertained by repeatedly rolling the wheel over a ··pry accurately measured di1'h111cP of at ]Past one ]1m1dn~d times its girt11, on a good ayeragf' railway track. As a pradical result a Yalue thus obtained wonlJ probably he more reliable than mw obtained hy experiments on a more Iiruite<l scale, which on the other han<l migl1t be more rPadily ext'cnted. l·'or an assumed. circumference of three meterR, the comparison of two revolutio11s with the 8ix-meter standard would be conyenient and readily pcrformecl. It if; of c:ourse nceei\sary to seeure the terminal points of 8ndt a base-line by works that are quite independent of thP track. aml to which the -wlwel-mna8tirl'me11t 1·.m1 be refenwl. Thi1' b<tSP·line will equally st>rvl' for ascertaining the proper temperature correction, by making the measurement with the ·wheel at different degree8 of heat. Special att<:-ntion is given to making the thkkuess and diameter of the bulb of the attaclwd thermometer such that in tbe same expmmre tD dark heat it will acquire temperature at the same rate afl tlrn wheel. · It does not appear very difficult, after a few experiments, t(} eft'pct this eondition within the limits requirf'd ·for sufficient precision of the temperature correction. Thf' a.-erage temperature indicated should not differ from the actual average temperature of the wheel by more than 1.0 Fahrenheit, which will insure the accuracy of the eorrection for temperature within one hundred-thonsanclth part of the <liiitance measured. The plan of using· such a tlwrmometer has been preferred to that of employing a sm~oml wheel of different metal, and inferring tht' required reduction from the diffcwence in the mt"a8tHed distances, because it would IH1 equally difficult to secure the isochronic heating of the two wheels, and because there is hut littll' difti.1re11ce in tl1e expansibilit_y of t11e har1ler metals which alone could be employed . .As part of tlie lineal measurement we must treat the transfer of the marks ol1tainctl ou the track to points st'cured in the ground whf're they ·will not lw disturbed by the pas1'age of trains. Here we hl·gin to encounter tlw difficulties of our method, and at once lose the' extrem<~ accurac;y with which we commenced the operation8. If it were alwa.''S convenient to place the mark, a,t a nm1r distance off, at right angles to the track, it wclllld be r;asy to prodcle the requisitP rnPans b;y some optic<tl attaclmwnts to the wheel, which have in part been drniigned. But iu genera.I that will not be practicable, aml it may often be necessary t-0 make the mark at the distance of a few roc:ls, u11 an excavation or down an embankment, and the plan adopted therefore is to center a theodolite over the mark on the track, for whicl1 pnrpose the stand is proYided with ~tiding plate8 and a vertical collimator, to measure the angle lletween the direction of the track an<l that of the permanent mark, and to ascertain its distance either lly measurement with the beam-compass or b;y an intersection from another point on the track, one or more reYolution8 distant from the former one. Fig. 1, Sketch No. 26, illustrates a case where at the terminus a of the right-line tra-0k a to b the t.ransfor to the side-point a' is made by laying off at a a right angle and placing a' at the measured distance of three meters, the ground being level; while at the other end the mark b' was establishell at a convenient point on an elevation, and its position relative to b ascertained by measuring tl1e angle at that poirit. arid at another c, fifteen meters distant from it. The rnetl1ml of deducing the length of a' b' from a b by means of these data is too simple to require explanation here. The measured Hue follows the grades of the railway, and must of course be reduced to a horizontal plane. In general the grades will be obtained with sufficient exMtness from the engineers of the road; when that [lource of information fails, the levels must be taken, which can be done ra1>idl~·, as no great precision is requisite. Rect~fication of cur~;es.-The best way to deal with curves, when practicable, is doubtless to continue the longest straight lines to their points of intersection, and measure the distances from the points where the lines leave the track, by some convenient mode possessing sufficient precision. J<,or this purpose the measuring apparatus mentioned in the beginning of this paper is very suitable; but another means of sufficient exactness and quicker application will be found in Paine's steel tapes, whieh should here be used by stretching them over tripod stands, provided on the top with a piece of soft wood about an inch wide. The steel tapes, when arranged for this use, have at each end an additional length of one foot bryond the marks between which the measure is continued, to bring the hand of the person starting them clear of the stand; a needle point inserted into a small handle is stuck into the top of the st.-ind, by the mark on the band or tape. A simple sight movable vertically, with a spirit-level and graduated arc attached t-0 each stand, serves to note the

Iu such case we must measurl" the angkt-> at a and b, between the ~honl aml the adjacent tang-t·ut; and since au is a comparatiYel.Y short line, great care must he takell iu tile centering of tlw tlwodo. lite and mark, in order to preserYe tlw requii-;ite precision in carr,rillg forward the directimi. It i:-; best to ha,·e sen·ral similar tripods, on which thf' theodolite and tarp:C'tH may !Jp monntt>ll in a Ike manner, so :O'h"> to he interehange(l while the tripods remain in positiou, wlddt will secure the identit~· of the points oceupietl and obserYed upon. If we could rely upon the uuiform cnrn1ture of the track, it would lw ad;-isablt> to dispense with the direct measurement of the chord, and to derfre it from the length of the arc measured with tlw. wheel, by com1mting the ratio of the chord t-0 the arc from the angle subtended at the center, which is the ::mm oftlte angles abc anrl cab. It iR ])robahle that when tl.11:' whole diange in directiGu does not exceed nfteen degrees, this IJ1au may be resortf'd to without sensible errors, as small dedations from u uniform circular cmTe would not materiaJI~· affect the length of the chord. Tlw inferred value of the latter may be rendered more eertain by measuring flt(' offset a e from the middle of the arc to the chord, and making the reduction for a parabolic me, if de is fnuu<l not to ha Ye very nearly the value of the Yersed sine of half the arc. But -wheu we Paimot measure eitl1er tlie tangents or the chord directly, it will iu general be preferable to adopt the pla11 illustrated in Fig. 3; where we resort to triangulation, using a, portion of each tang('Ilt a' a and h' b as base-li1wR from which to fix the position of a poi 11t c, in reference to a and b, and outaiu tltc m0ans of carrying forw1trd om· sy;;tem of <listances aud angle;;.

When a common point c cannot he fonn<l visible from hoth tangents, it uw)· h<> necessary to intro{luce one or more intermec1iatp. triangles, as in Fig. 4, drawn to illustrate the case of a reYer8ed cm·vp.

Reductimi of tlie measured lines and angles to a simpler s.ysteni.-'Yheu the operations performed involve smaller links than tU,.,tances of three or four mile::;, it iR deRirahle to straiglitl~n out th(', work hy reducing to one common line all the shorter distances of which it is eomposNl, and by measuring the angles bet1,·ee11 such succAssive g11iile-li11es, as we will caJl them, fo carrr forward tl1e directions independent of the many angles that have entered into tJ1e framework of tlle original measurement. \Ve give an illustration in Fig. 5, showing a line of road of ratlwr unfaYorahle conditions, drawn to a scale of two inehes to the mile. The points 011 the lin<' arc numberPd in succession; the distance 1-2 has been obtaitwd by triangulation from the base 2-3, by which the position of A is at the sainc time determined; 3-4 has been measured directly with the steC"l tape; 6-fi' is obtained from 5-6, and 6'-7 from 7-S by triangulation, as shown; hf'hn·en 9 aud 10 the tangents ha,·e been measured directly to 9 1 ; the chords 11-12 and 12-13 lmvB he.en derived from the measured arcs and oft'sets, and finally B is determined from the base 14-IG. The lengths of all the right lines along the track have been ase.ertainecl with the wheel, and all the angh·s iu the scheme hM·e been measured with the theodolite, including at A and B the angles between tl~elinejoiningthem au<l tlw uext indivisible distant points Z and C. The broken line A-3-4-5-6'-7-9'-11-12-13-14-B is now reduced to the line AB by multiplying each link with the cosine of the. angle which it makes with that line, and taking the sum of the products. We thus obtain the distance A B and its direction w'ith reference to adjacent Jines.

' No small sa-ving of time and expenditure will be found to result from its convenience of transporting the sur-veying party, its material and supplies, either by ordinary trains on the road, or on a light truck used as a tender, ~ml attached to Ute Jiaud-car. The tender wilJ carry, besides tents and camp equipage, a portable tripod and scaffold for ohserring with the theodolite from an elevation of twenty feet, which is an almost indispensable means of overcoming the minor inequalities of the ground wlwn measuring the angles between stations separated by greater distances.

The employment of thP tin cone or conoid is limitell to modPratc distam~Ps, as the reflet·tion from the tiu soon uecomes dimmPd by exposure to the weather. The brilliant l'Cfiection from the glass globes sil>ered on the inside hy Liebig's method suggested their employment, since Ruch a hemisphere would, for all positions or tlu· sun, throw a retlection to nearl,\· eYer,Y point in the horizon; but it was found that tbe image, although ,·er_y brilliant, was too small in lliametn to be r<>a<lily seen, and iu fact \Yas lost, as the ligllt of the stars h; lost in the da~- time. Owing to the perfed figun· of Ute gloue the re:lleeted image of tlle 8UU oceupies not mnch more than half a degreti of its surface, and it would require a hemisphere of six or eight feet diameter to give a sufficiently large image. The idea then occurred to nw. tn anang<' in parallel row>; a :,;erif's of glass tubes silverc<l on the inside, bent in an arc of a cirde of litrge diameter, so as to have a enn·ature of about 24° 1 and placed with the upper pal't in a Yertieal position, as ma~- lJ(· better understood li;v inspeeting the illustration on Sketch No. 26.

REPORT ON THE FIELD AXD OFl'ICE WORK RELATING TO THE TIDES.

CoAsT STTRVEY Or:r·rcE, No1Jember 1, 1867. DE.A.R SIR : I haYe the honor to submit th<· folklwing report on the field and offke work performed during· the past year h;r the 'l'idal DiYiHion, now under my cltarg;e. Field-1cork.-The statiorns occupied duriug· the past year to make tidal obseryations for ge.neral 1mrposes lrnYe. bePn m; follows, Yiz: Owl's Head, l\laiue; Portland, Maine; Boston, J\iassachuse.tt>:; New York; Old Point Comfort, Yirgiuia; Dry TortngaH, Florida; San Diego and San Frmieis1·0, California; and Astoria, Oregon. At most of these statiom; obsen-ations haYe been kept up for many yean·, and should be coutinued long enong11 to satisf:r the conditions requisite for deducing from them the general la\YS of the ti(les. Tidal obser...-ations haYe been made at various other places by observers directl,\- eonneet<'d with l1ydrograplJie parties and for their Rpecial use, consequently they are generall.Y of short contimia111~e and not reported directly to this division or under its charge. The Rtation at Owl's Head was occupied for the first time 011 t11e 17th of July, 18G7, and seems to be a very good one. Obscrrntiorrn at l'ortlancl were discontinuetl the 1st of :November, 1866, and tlle gauge, after uttdt>rgoing repairs, IIWYed to Owl's Head. A new series of obRe>rvations was commenced at the Hoston mn-y yard, with an impron'd form of Saxton's self.registering t.ide-gauge, on the 1.Jth of August, 1867, awl it 'dll, no doubt, yield results of great importance in relation to the improvements goiug on in thP harhor. If coutinued long enough, it will he of great interest, too, in a scientific point of Yiew, es]Jecially when takPu iu connection with the previous observations made there. T1te observations at GoYernor's Island and Old Point Comfort have hecn continued regularly, wHh the exception of rather Herion8 stoppages b;y ice, last winter, when the gauge at the former place waR frozen up for nearl,y half a month) and at the latter several dayfl, mul the observers had to resort to other means. It is very desirable to vreveut, if vossihle, the Tecurrencc of such stoppages. Tortugas waR occupi('(l seyera1 years ago, and used as a station with which to compare others, while a regular 8eries of obi;:ervations was being made at sets of stations successively occupied along the Florida reefs an<l the whole northern coast of the Gulf of 1VIexico, for the general purpose of in...-estigatiug the m1omalies of the tide,,; on that coast. Unfortunately tliat plan had to be abandouetl before the series was finiHhed; hut it is to hP Jwpml that it can be resumed and completed soon. The observations on thl' western coast hayc continued to be entirely satisfactory. They arc all in charge of the same obsl'rYers as heretofore, under the 1:mperYision of Major G. H. Elliot, of the Corps of Engineers, ~Gnited States Army. At all t.hese stations the observations have been of excellent chai·acter, and thfl great l'xperieuce and tried fidelit;y of the observer8 give assurance that all that can be accomplished with the instruments in their kee11ing, will be done. It is generally to be desired that as soon as it can be properly done, tidal obserYations he made at a few we1l-selectml stations along the coast farther to the northwest, recently purchased from Russia. Snch observations seem to be nec·essary for clearing up the- aIIomalies which have been observed 011 the 8l1ores of Washington Territory, and the innstigation of the cotida1 lines on the Pacific coast cannot he completed without them. It is well to commence the hydrographic surYe,r of a coast by the observation of tides, if it is practicable, since the sou11dings cannot be exaetly laid do-wn on charts without t11e.m, and it may happen that the tidal data n,rc quite iusufticieut for determiuiug the correct plane of reference. If the whole wm·k is based on the tidal obserYations at the principal points for an entire year, it may be presumed to be good. · Captain a. C. Mitchell is observing tides on the coast of New Jersey in connection with the

The extrell_lit;r of the Cape,-Provineetown and that pari of Truro t·mhraced in J'ltlajorGraham's surreywas surveyed hy my;;elf, in person. The importance of Cape Cod Harbor, and t11e complex 11atnre of this section of the cape as a su~iect for survey, necestiitated close and aceurate work, which was doue, in the ap]lroved mode of the standard topograph;v of the Coast Stun';;,-, and affOl'd:; important intermediate comparison of features aboYP the water line. The h;rdrography of the Coast SurYe~· was executed, in 18::lu, hy Commauder H. S. Stellwa.geu, -Cnited States Nav~·, a,;si,;taut. Thi,; lll'anch of the stll'YPY is for the general imrpose8 of nayig:ition, and, in view of the great water area to be gone over, does not arnl cannot develop lol'ul details with the minuteness of a special sun-ey like tha:t of :Major Graham, unle8s such a sun·ey is so ordered. At the time the hydrography of the Coast Sun·ey was exPcuted, the questious now under considenition wem not antici1iated. The comparison, therefore, of this survey of Commauder Stellwagen's with tlmt of ::\Iajor Graham's and the one I ha Ye jnR1 completed, can 0111.r cover gene. ral, and not particular features. In 1857, at the request and in behalf of a former Stak eommission, 1 made, by order of the Superintendent of t,he Coast Survey, a resurvey of the outlines of the extremity of the ca1w, embracing the ground of m;y former surYey of 1848, aud including the localitier,; now under consideration; but no hydrography was executed at this time.

In the spring of 1867, another survey, mainly hydrographic, was made for the lward of StatR harbor commissioners, by A. Boschke, esq., civil engineer. This f;mrve.r was, again, for a special but different purpose-the location of a harbor line for the limit of wlml'f structures-and did not, in its case, cover the ground or develop the physical details in questiou. The means, tl1erefore, of accurate and minute comparison had not yet been obtained. To procure this end, the present board of commissioners, for the protection aml prese1Tation of this important harbor, made their call for tho special stuvcy I have just completed nuder your order. This survey has been executed in the most accurat,e and detailed manner, with the knowledge of the value and bearing of such results, only, as were correct. Datu of projections arn:l triangu.· lation points have been furnished from the office of the Coast Survey. The field-work is all based

The survey of J.\I:ijor Graham shows the fonnation of Long Point as an irregnlar neek of sand fiats and lrnmmocks, l.Jroke11 by lagoons having He,·eral openings on the iw;id.(· and 01w ou the outside, "·ith a high-water channel passiug qnitl· through the neck.

Tbe slo1)e of the extremity of thi8 mofo or spit, like it8 northern shh\ i;; w·ry abrupt; and this altrnpt slope is prei;en-ed in its steady moyement along the :door, and into the deep waters of the harbor, like the adnmctc' of an immen;;e dune. Along the margin or crest of the fiats, between Long Point aml the western eJ1tl of tht· vilhq.~e, the drainage of sand off these flats hal'l prqjected their low-water marg·in, or hauk, ar. aye.rage 1listi.lnce of two huudre1l and seYenty-1ive feet, with a lateral exteut of fin.:'. thom;aud fret, nmkiug <L superficial area of increase of 1,:~w,000 square foet. The outer slope of these fiats, which, a1' before stated, has the c1mracter of an abrupt bauk, has unde1·gone considera,ble change; and along its central section has eneronched upon the basin of the harbor, the base of the slope or bauk having a{hanced sixty feet. Between the eenter arnl southern corner of this bank there is more change than actual increase; in fact, the corner of the bank has 1·eceAled at the, turning point, and assumed a sharper bend. This indicates that the material of the lmuk itself is sul~jPct to strong nuder-water iu1luences. Between the center and northern corner of the bank, wl1ere the cnrYe and ehange from the abrupt slope is more gradual, tl~e comparison of surveys shows more disturhanct· of contour than actual change; the general position of the bank in relation to the harbor outline renwining as lieretofore. The gradual slope along the front of the village also retains its former general grouml. The marked and extensive increase of the summit of thi;;; bank between Long Poiut arnl tlw wes~rn end of the vi11age, suggests the importance of arrc;;tiug the moving surface material of the fiats behind it. A fence or dike, consti:ucted from Long Point, near the entrance of Lob::;t.er Plain, to HonKe Point Island, and from Romm Point Island to Steyeus Point, would be a f°lffor:.thle liiw, marl would shut off the greater portion of these flats, and ultimately increase the substance of the point.

This abrasion, cmised by the tidal currents both at flood and ebb, has cnt into the high sand dunes, north of the lagoon, in a de('p coYe about tweh'e hundred feet in lateral extent with an avernge eatting of one hundred and eighty feet, showing a waste of 24,000 snperfieial ~-ards.

Be:rond this cove the dunes have a(lyanced, as bef'orP stated, over the site of former high flats, otherwise unchanged, and now rjsp abruptl,r from tl1ese flats at the shore-line. This extension covers au are~t of 800x.JO .\·ards=~~:L,000 square yards. So eYidently is thi:;; a dnne movt·mc·nt, that tlw extem;iou aJHl increa;.;e cam1ot be conuecteil with the coneaYe excavation and retreat of the shore at the cove below. It would be rpasonable to appl_\· thiR dnne advancement to the gToun<l of the cut or cove i·cfoue(l to, a;; the wbol(' northmn shore of the lag'oon is bordered by dunes of the Hame character and subj(·et to tht· game wiud influences. This would nearly double the figures given above, as the 1ni.stc awl rPnwyaJ of material from the cut or coye described. As these changes indicate, on the one hand, an advance of the ;.;hort\-Ji11c upon nearly the high water plane, and, on tlie other, the entire i·emoyal of rnatel'ial between the suTface and bed of the lagoon, its capacity, as a reservoir, ha,; been in so mueh incTeased. AbovP thf' inlet, tlrn low watN· channel has changed its form and dir('ction, hut there is no eYitlf'm·e of :m;v lesR clamage than formerly; on the contrary, the channel is deeper and extends far heyornl the 1imit of the tlats re1n·eseuted on :Major Graham's chart as dry at low water.

This clia1tm·l, although rnnTowPr than whc1i }lajor Grnham suryeyed it, is show u to be dPPpeT, aml has prohahly as much, if not greater sl·ouri11J,r capacity than when it was in its former couclition. The comparison of shore-lines has shown the inlet to hawi contractell from a width of mw thousand se-\·en humlrecl in 183;3, to uiue lmncll'ed feet in 181>7, the 1wesent time. But a comparison of cross-section shows that iu this narrowing- uo proportional dimiuutim1 uf water-·wa:y ha;; occurre.d. Ma,jor Graham's chart exhibits two tlcpressionR in tl1e cross-section, not unlike those at ]Jresent existing, but of much less depth. The former are, respecti,·ely, threr: fe<·t atl(l OIH» foot, while the latter am fourteen feet and eight feet. That the artificial structures connected with tlrn bridge and romhn1y haw'. h;.- eoufining the inflow and outfiow of the tides to nearly the same patlnn1,r, aideu i11 llePpeuing the iulet, no oue can doubt. At tlie period of Major Grabam's survey, no bridge or other artificial obstruction exii'lted. The subsequent influence of these ohstructionR must also lw giYen lhw 'H'ig·ht ju considering the changes in the positions an<l. magnitudes of the shoal,; hotl1 aboY~· and l>elow tlH· illlc·t. The drainage cuuent of East Harbor, whid1 may lw 8aid to apprnad1 tlil' opening along the axis of the lagoon, impinges, as it near,; tlte inlet, upon the lilutfs of tht> main f'hon·. is deflected from its course auu turned oil' through the inlet at rather a isharp angle, after which it pursues a, nearly direct course to the sea. In studying the contours of the bottom, in the section of tll.e 1ta.rlJ01' off the entranc<> of East Harbor, as shown by the fathom curves, the inflnenccR of the info1 are markP(l i11 their effect. Were there no causes for disturbance, we should t;xpect to iind the contours here, as Plsewhere, conea:1ie, and eonformi1l{/ to t71e general trend of the slwi·c ; instead of which TH~ find them cunn,.r. Upon Major GTa.ham's chart this protrusion of the C'outourn, oft' the e11trn11ee of East Harbor, is ver.r evident and extends from the low-water Jiue to the muddy bed of the main l·al'bor. It is also evident that the projedion of these contours is not alone the i·esult of tlw pushing out of sand aJready existing in this Yicinity, or brought here hy wan\ and current action from distant ground; in which case, were this the preYailing action, the sands wonlll be thr01rn in rathe1· than protruded. But the evidence is, that isupplies of saml have been hrought out from the lagoon by the ebb current; and that these sands, and this tidal current, have been the prentiling cmrnes of this local projection of the under-water shore slope of the harbor. A compa1·ison of the survey of 1\lajor Graham with that just made (lernonstrates that this projection of sand has continued and increased during the intervening time. \Ye have no tlata by which to ascertain the increase in elevation of the shoals and bars off the cntrauc<> of the lagoon within the one-fathom line, and can, therefore, only compare their out1iue8 and lateral extent. Beside the, accumulation which may haYe occuned to increase the elevation of these shoals on either side of East Harbor Channel, the tidal current from the lagoon seems to haYe lmd the power to carry material along its path way to the crest of the decline, and pr(\ject this material oyer t.11e face of the outer slope. '.l'his depos1t is marked and extensive as far as the 1fre-fathom cm'Ye-tlle limit of our means of comparison. This increase may be stated in the following terms : The contour of the two-fathom curve shows an a.dv:mce, since Major Graham's survey, of an average distance of one hundred and seventy-fire feetfo:rDtlateral distance of six thousand, equaling 1,000,000 superficial feet.

The tlm'e-fatl10m cmTe has ad,·auce<l: in a like manner, an average distance of one hundred

Tlw fm1T-fathom rurye has adya11cefl one hundred and fifty feet hy eight thousand feet, equalliu g- 1,200, 000 superficial feet. The five-fathom ctn:ve has advance<l one hundred and teu by five thousand feet, equalling r;;;o,ooo superficial feet. Tlw total prc~jection of these curves amounts t1> an area of 3,920,000 superficial feet. To ascPdain aml illm;trate this increased deposit, we haYe taken, only, the curves of the fathom planes, ·which are the liues usually giye11 on the liydrographie charts of the Coast Surve.r. But as t>ach of these planes over-laps upon the other, it shows a deposit over the whole section. The distance of the onrlap, indicated hy the fathom curves, also sliows a de11osit which would probably average one foot iu dPpth. Estimating the 8ection bet"l'i'ee.n the two and five fathom curves--which equals an average distam~e of tl1n·e tJ1011,.;~1 ml feet-and including the lateral extent of the deposit, shown upon the chart to be six thon.sau<l fh-e lmndred feet, 1ve lmYe the extensive area of 30,500,000 superficial feet. lu otl1er iignreR, ~W,.'J00,000 culJic feet of sand Las beeu projected over this under-water shore-slope of the harbm, covering an area of sen~n 1mrn1red acres one foot deep with sand. The Jwri.zo11tal pmjeetion of this deposit iH much gi·eater and more important in its relation to the entrance and iiavigation of the harbor than this vertical shoaling would seem to indicate. 'l'lw most t~xl.emfo11 pndect.ion of t.hree-fatl10111 plane-au important depth in navigation-appears at the extreme limits of the ground affected, so that, at points two miles apart, we find the tl.J.ree-fatbom curve to have adyanced three hundred feet. ~4..~ the interve11i11g grmmd is broken and irregular, no vessel drawing eighteen feet of water should Yenture lJpyoud this line, witl.tin thiH lateral distance of two miles. In applyiuµ; the consequences of this change in the condition of the harbor to the practical question of nu,-ig:ation, it re~mlti,;: that vessels hound into Cape Cod Harbor, in standing over towa:rd the Truro shore, within this 1-1ectio11 of two miles, must shorten their range, or tack, by a distance of thn~e hundred feet. To ve;,;;,;els in distress heavy laden and laboring in stress of weather to make the harbor, every foot of sailing· distance gained, aucl available, under the lee of the Truro shore, is of great ad yantage. The iiresent tidal power of the folet ma.r he further shown by a statement of the capacity of the lagoon, which, at ordinary titles, has an area of four hundred and sixty-th1·ee acres. At high spring tides-and .Major Graham's tidal records show the rise of a storm tide, with a southeast gale, to have been sixteen feet-the whole extent of "the meadows" is overflowed, increasing the area by four hull(lred and sixty-one acres, making a reservoir capacity of nine hundred and twenty-four acres. The results of observations gauging the flow of water through the inlet, taken by direction of .Jame.s E. Frauci.~, esq., b.r A. Savary, esq., civil engineer, shows the mean volume of water flowing· on the flood tide to he 7,820 cubic foet per second. So long as thiH inlet remains open, th(~ scour of the tidal currents, added to the other activities of nature, will have a tendency to weaken portions of Beach Point and give a general insecurity to the locality. This has already been the oc~casion of large expenditures upon temporM"y work of defense. In making the statements recorded in this report, and presenting the comparative chart showing the changes which have taken and are taking place in the physical condition of the harbor, I will again allude to the charader and accuracy of the data upon which these results are based. The accuracy of the prepared chart furnished from the Engineer Bureau, the accuracy alld detail of )fajor Graham'ssuryey, and of the survey just executed, have renderedtheseresults most satisfactory and unusuallj- close in their determination. In an permanent lines and features the coincidence lias been most marked and perfect; as have also been the points, common to both surveys, U}lOD which comparisons are based. The results of these surveys unite in testifying to the encroachment of sands upon the waters of the harbor, and give no reasonable ground for assuming that these causes of injury are declining. We will not assert that the time may not come when the action of these caWJeS may decline or

The narrow strip of outf'ide beach which connects the high lands of Truro and ProYincPtown, and stretches across the head of the meadows, if.; the remains of what appears to lia n· bc·en a high riclge of sand dunes, formed prior to any record or history we h:n-e of this localit~-. That tlwy hwrn been long undisturbed by wind is evident from the existen(·e of the beach·plmn tn·e. which con·r;; the remaining inner slope of thP l1ighest of tbf'se dnnPs or hillR. Without enteriug into a discussion of the geology of thi:o; section of the ca1w. the com<iderntion of the probable orig·in and general former condition of this remarkable land is important in judging of its probable ftlture condition aml the changes which are like1~- to takl' place. The fact is patent tliat the Truro land-or main cxtremiQ· of the cape terminating at "High Head '~-was formed at an earlier period, under different influences, and contains material not present in the so-ca1led Province land. This diffflrence is marked hy t]I(~ existeuee of cla.y and of boulders, and by the peculiar form of the " bowl and (lo me" 11-::ift, distinguishing it from the Prmince land, which is of sand only-so free from all earthy matter that it will not evc11 discolor water-while the forms which the dunes and ridges here assume are mainly eharactcristic of wind drift. Whatever the original forces ma~~ ha Ye been that forrned this part of the cape, these forces have long since ceased, and changed from an action of increa,~c to that of constan1 and conUnued degradati01i. The peculiar position and form of the Province land is that of a spit, thrnst ont by the tidal currents and thrown up b~· tlle {\asb of the sea beyond the former extremity of the eape, and composed mainly of the insoluble material abraded from the shores of the main ca.peat 'rnuo and beyond. A cross-section of the cape, at the Highland Light, shows an abrupt ont,er hank of about one hundred and twenty feet in height, pro,ing that at a former period the cape at this 8ection was wider than it is now, and that probably the shore-line extended far out into whr1t is no\"\" deep water. The remains of the inside sfope of what were former high dunes on the ProYinee land, show that these dunes were formed under the lee, as it were, of this former wide and more extentled portion of the cape. It seems to be almost a law-and certainly is the pmrniling course in the foundation of such ground as Provincetown-that the first resultant of the creative forces is the outer bar or ba~k bone ridge of the spit or neck so formed. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the oute.r ridges of the peninsula of Provincetown were the earliest in date, and that the flats, marshes, and ponds now existing are subsequent accumula· tions and accidents which have taken place under tbe 8helter aud eddy intluenees of the outer hooked bar or beach. The waste of this beach~ with its bluffs and dunes, which forms the isthmus connecting the Provincetown peninsula with the Truro la11d 7 is now going on in line witil the general waste of the whole outside shore, and more rapidly perhaps at the main bend of the cape along this section than at many other points. There are now two narrow and Wflak places in the strip of beach which forms the isthmus of Provincetown-as above described-which I will call in my report and refer to on my cl1ar·ts and plans as the "oblique section '1 and the "cove section." At each of these points a line of levels has boon run from the outside slope of the beach to the inside water level of East Harbor C;:eek, as stated in the foregoing pages of my report. By comparison with the extreme high-water line-the one given on l\fajor Graham's chart-a

waste of tltrec'hnndred fiwt found opposite the "oblique ;;.eetiou ;'! and of two hundred and :fifteen feet opposite tlie '" coYe sediou." The ontsi!le head1 along this bend of the cape is swept by a strong lateral current, tending toward Hace Point, :md is also open to the full power of the ;,;everest sto1'ms, which bring upon the shore the he:rdE'st breakers. Aln·:uly tlws£· breakers han· dashed o\~er the narrow strip of sand beach at what I term the ohliqne :-;ectio11. This led to sonw v;·ork of protection to the beach. A jt>tl.ee of heaYy piles was drfren on the outer ti1ope of tile beach, but waR torn np by the :-wa as soQu as made. Sorne brush ]1edges have been set a)}(l beach-gnts,; planted along the crest of the hcacL. These han· canse(l some accmnnlation of sand and prm:ented what was already there from being l)low11 awa~-. Unt notlling has been done to preserve or increase the lJeacll at "·hat I term the "cove section," which is no~ 1lw Wf~akest poiut along the line of this sand;y isthmus. The k1cls taken b..r ::.\.Ir. llfram F. Mills and shown upon his (elalwrate plan of profiles giYe the following results: At the oblique ;,;ection the outside slope of the beach is seen to be frequently washed by the tide and sea to within about two feet of the highest point of the ridge. J:.'nJm this line of sea Ila.sh the distance through to the inside marsh is fom' hundred and thirty-se1en feet, the line passing 01er rathf'r irrPf,'11h1r gronml. The diffcreneP of level between this line of sea. dash on the outside slope of the beach and the plane of the marsll inside i8 nine aud nine-tenths feet. At tlle "coYe section," the form and character of the strip of beach is that of a single bluft~ with a steep slope from it;,; outer ere st fo the sea with a more gradual but simple inside slope toward the marsh. The dead grnss and drift at the outer edge of this bluff shows that the b1'eake1's often reach its summit. The little co,·e of insi<le marsh-from which I name the section-reduces the width of the sand :ridge constituting the entire isthmus at this point to ninety feet. The snrn·;\~ b;v )fr. l\lills was made at a season of ordinary titles and in ordinary weather, but there is alwa~-s a heavy sea on the outside shores of this section of the cape. From the line of high-water 8ea-dash on the outer slope of the beach to the same level on the inside slope, the distance across this strip of lwach i8 8ixty-fiye feet. The ehwatiDn of the little intervening bluff above this line or plane is six and six-tenths feet. Opposite this cove of marsh East Harbor Creek makes its nearest bend toward the outside beach with a small lateral creek extending still nearer to it, so that the corresponding waters are but tl1ree hnndrnd and one feet apart. The relatiom; of these water8 in their tidal epochs are peculiar at this point. The long path which the inside tide has to travel first in passing through East Harbor Inlet, then, after filling- the lagoon, :finding its way through the windings of the creek to nearly the head of the meadows, makes the time of 11igh water in the creek lh 29m later than the outside ocean tide. Our tidal observations arul the profiles of l\lr. l\lills also show the level of the water in East Harbor· Creek at the time of high water outside to be eleven and one-tenth feet below the plane of ordinary sea-dash on the outside heac11 opposite. In these results we have before us this physical condition of the case; The onl~- barrier which now pre1ents the waves of the outside ocean from dashing into anrl upon the creek and meadows of East Harbor, which are on a plane eleven feet below the summit of the breakers, as they come rolling in, is a strip of sand beach sixty-five foet wide with a little outside bluff six and a half feet in height. That thiK strip of beach antl this little bl~ are steadily diminishing, both in width and elevation, is beyond a doubt. The question seems to be simply one of time. We find in thirty-two years that two hundred feet of this beach have washed away to ninety feet now left remaining. If jt be a fact that this outside be,ach or bar is antecedent to the fiats and marshes which have formed under itH protection, then, when this protection is removed, we have a condition and relation of things which has not before exi:ited or occurred. In view of the vast power of ocean breakers, culminating with storm tides and gales, it is vain

to predict the consequences which may result should they break over and through this beach.

In the storm that carried away the first :Minot's light-house, a breach was made in the out. side beach at Xansett, which, wheu tlH' storm subsided, was oYer fiyp Imnured feet in width with a channel eleveu feet iu dP.pth. Thi,; opening remains to this da>-; a1thougl1 tlrn temle11eies to close, by the formation of a uew outside beach, are as stroug, awl tl1c imiide influences to k('ep an inlet open less faYorablC' than at the grmmd in question-which prp,;ents an unobstructed pathway through the entire cape, while the calm waters of Cape Cocl Harbor are always bl'low the summit level of the lH'eakern on the outside shore. But as;mming that no change in the existing conclition of laml or water should result from the wearing or breaking· away of this strip of beach : lt is eyident that witlJout this barrier, at periods of high tides the sea would dash oyer for many hours into the basin of the meadows This sm1llus wate1· in its outflow at ebb tide ·would tend toward the harbor as re.adi1y as it would discharge itsPlf' through the ocean inlet, should 011e be made. The scour and cutting power of East Harbor lulet would tlicrflfore lw i1wreased at each ebb tide, by a volume of watel' not accumulated hy its own flood-tidP capacit~~. That this augmented water-power would increase all the evil infiueuces of the inl<:>t is bf'yond a doubt. In yiew of this contingency, the closing of East Harbor Inlet, as proposed hy the prc>sent lward of State commissioners, fulfills a double purpose, in stopping the injury it is now doing, arnl in presenting a breakwater between the ocean aud the harbor water:;., should the outside beach bn~ak throug11. In addition to a dike at the inlet of East Harbor-which I should stroug]y rc>eommend-a guard dike at the narrow part of the meadows, near the '' wadiug place,'· would give iucreasetl lH'Otection. It is impracticable, even impossible, to resist the force" of the ocean, on such a coa:;;t as this, at the point of its attack. Security must be obtained by rear defences. Without further comment upon the facts and questions I lmve aho,-e presenteed, I am constrained to acid, Umt in all my knowledge of the coast, and iu the results of' the mauy survt·~-s I have made, involving· questions of harbor improvement and protection, 1 have fmmd no casP wl1.uh, in my judgn~ent, calls more strongly for the attention aml action of the g·cneral government ancl of the State than tllis of Cape Cod Harbor. Its value to commerce, its location, its accessibility, its shelter as a h::irbor of refuge, are unequalled on the Atlantic coast of the L'nited States. Before closiug my report, I would particularly mention the conference arnl commltation I haYe had with Henry Mitchell, esq., of the Coast Survey, who has been twice to Prm·i11c1>tow11 dming the term of my field-work there. ).Ir. Mitchell has, personally, gone over all the ground under co11sideration, and with me made some experimental tests of the harbor and Bast Harbor currents. The lateness of the season, and the limited time available for such investigations, however, rende1·ed a proper series of observations impracticable. Mr. Mitchell concurs with me in the general Yiews expressed and the (leductions m~ule. from t11e data and comparison of my surveys. I would also mention the serYiccs of Mr. Gershom Bradford, of the Coast Survey, wl10 bas executed the hydrographic work under 111;\" general charge; :M:r.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 13.
REPORT TO THE SFPERINTEXDENT OF THE COAST SURVEY ON THE TIDES A:t>."D CURRENTS OF HELL GATE, BY HEXI~Y ::IIITCHELL, CHIEF OF PHYSICAL HYDROGRAPHY, UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

SIR: I beg leave to submit the following report upon Hell Gate: Genera.l scheme of tides wul currents.-Ofthe two entrances to :Yew York Harbor, that which communieates with Long Island Sound may be classed specificall,r with arms of the sea., wllile that wMch opens from tlle ocean at Sandy Hook has an essentially different character.* In the former the water iR constrained by the rocky bed and banks; in the latter t1~e yielding sands submit themselves to the action of the wayes and currents. Although the rocks of the East River bear many traces of tlte action of running water, the:;;e may at once be recognized as subsidiary and insiguiikant ieatures-tlie depression throngl1 which the currents now flow is antecedent to, and essentially independent of, the activities which we now witness. The tidal currents which now traYerse the eastern entrance are, by the channel way, forced from their natural disposition into complications peculiarly local in cllaracter; giving rise to those whirlpools and reactions of the water which bewilder the uavigator and render the pass dangerous often to the most expert pilot. It is quite otherwise with the Sandy Hook entrance, where nearly everj- physical feature presentt>d to the observer may find a parallel or counterpart in his experience or knowledge of other portions of our coast. Unlike the Hell Gate passage, wJ1ere per11ui1w1we is the leading characteristic, the bar and channels at Sandy Hook have undergone continual variations within the brief period of our history. In the contest between the currents and the waves of the sea, the former busy in the scour of the channeli<, the latter equally busy in their destruction, we have seen, from the comparison of actual surveys extending over a century, new channels developing and older channels deteriorating. \Ve have seen Gedney's Channel improve, and we are now witnessing tbe ti.Hing np of the l\Iain Ship Channel by the advance of Sandy Houk. There are evidences that Raritan Bay was once open to the sea from the Highlands of N avcsi11k to l<'lynn's Knoll, at least, and that Sandy Hook has advanced from these highlands under the action of the waves of the sea which drive diagonally from the southeast-that is to say, there are reasons for supposing that the lower harbor of New York is a bigkt. The older portions of Sandy Hook have a considerable admixture of green sand which no doubt comes from tlte Navesink deposit. The fresh impply of material which is extending thfl point of the Hook is known to come Ull along the outer shore, and is believed to be derived from the neighborhood of J,ong Branch, where the sea i:o encroaching upon the land quite rapidly. On tlie other hand, the present aspect of New York Bar is that of a broken cordon of sand stretching from the coast of New .Jersey to that of Long Island, giving to the present opening some of the characteristics of an inlet. If the lower harbor of New York is a bight, the bar may be regarded as a recent formation, and the extension of Sandy Hook may be expected to continue. The tendency of a b,iglit, to speak in the most general language, is t-0wards i1wlos1tre. The rift of sand, which at eady stage!'! converts it into a sheltered harbor, tends ultimately to cut oif the basin from the sea; and it is not until a late period that the bar appears-not until the opening is so confined that the current through it is so quickened as to he able to hear l.l.W"ay or push seaward a portion of the sands. It may be properly argued that the land ·waters which find their way into New York Harbor will always force an outlet from the lower harbor, because the Hell Gate Pass is too htdirect, and, in times of great freshets, too confined ; lmt an adequate outlet for these back waters would fall far short of the present opeuing. In onr opinion the conservation of ample channel ways at Sandy Hook is due in some measure to the tidal circulation which the Hell Gate entrance permits. This circulation is

the life-blood of the harbor, cleansing its drnnnels from tlw silts of its rh-crs, as w<~ll as from the sewerage of its cities, and even sw<'q1i11p; the sandR fl'om it,; g'ranll RYe1rne to thP 0('.CHn. The purpose of tlJi.c; report is neither a general discussion of the pl1ysics of :Kew York Harbor nor even an essa,y upon 1l1P great tidal cirenlaticm to whid1 we !urn~ r('ferre<l. 1'.Iy special topic will be the tidal phenomena of Hell Gate; aud it i,.; only lwt·ansP tlwl'e phenomerm rll'pend so entirely upon the coexistence of the two entrances that I han· been tempteu iuto the vrecediug speculations upon the past history of these. 1-<ew York Harbor is visited by t"-o derivations from the tide-waye of the ocean, one of which approae11es lJy way of Long I >1laml Sound, th(' other by tile way of Sand;;- Hook Entr:lll(".('. These two tides meet and cross or overlap <.'ach other at Hell Gate; aud since they lliffN frnrn Pach other in times and ltcights, they cause contraRts of water deyations between the souud and the harbor, which call into existence the \ioleut currents that traYcrse tlic East Rh-er. In the course of our lalJorious tabulations of the data from my phy8ical 8urn·ys of 18i"ii and 1858, it has become apparent that the general order or scheme of the tidal i11terforence is Yery simple, and that the apparent complication8 result from the mingling ul' lrn~al pecnl iaritie8 ; for this reason I deem it essential to offer a general Yiel> of the scheme denuded of all its details before invitiug you to follow through tables and diagram to the phenomenon actually obserYed. If the entrance from the sound were closed at Throg 7s Neel;., the tide which comes in oYcr the bar would pre,'ail all over New York Harbor, and we should have on the west side of Hell Gate a tide of four and a half feet range, with its time of high wat1'r about one-lialf hour lat('r tllan at Sandy Hook, L e., eight aud a half110urs aft.m· the Routhing of tlw moo11. Tu passing through the Gate and spreading out upon the broadeT spaces beyond, thi1S tidf' would essential]~- ]ose its waYe chara<'ter and become Yery much reduced in range~ ISO that at the Brothe1·s falands it would probably be scarcely seusible. If, on the other liand, the sound entrance were to remain open and the Sandy Hook entrance be closed, a very different order of tides would 1n·evail. On the east side of Hell Gate the tide would have a rauge, of a.lmut seyen feet, aud high watl'r would occur there about tweh-e hours after the moon's transit. In passing the Gate it would suffer degradation, hut not YPry ra11idl.r 1 till it had adyance<l beyon<l tile Blackwell's Island channels. Iu the basin of the uppt·r harbor, however, it would become very small and essentially waste itself and disap1Jear in the lower harbor. If these two suppositions are correct, we ought, with botli entrances 01)eu, to find at Hell Gate a tide whose times and heights are int~rmediate between those now obserYed at Sandy Hook on the one hand and Throg's Neck upon the other; while at other poiuts tlw proportions would be unequal, according as our place of ohserTation was more distant from the meetiug point ou either side. In the subjoined tahie and its accompanying sketch, we give the two tides as they would a1)pear at Hell Gate separately, and also as they would appear combined.

If we were to suppose a dam with a narrow lead through it thrown across Hell Gate at Hallet's I'oint, the tides No. 1 and No. 2 would be those which would occur on the west and east sides respectively, and the heights in the column marked "Mean" would be thmm in the lead. On the other hand, if we suppose No. 1 aud No. 2 to be waves meeting in the ocean, we must expect them to be superimposed and their compound represented by the column marked "Sum." In the interference of tides in shallow waters or narrow channels the composite tide at their meeting point is neither the sum nor mean, but falls between these.* I have usecl 0.65 for the coefficient in com. puting the composite curve, No. 3, which appears in our diagram; and this curve corresponds (in a general manner) with that actually observed in Hell Gate. From the foregoing table and sketch, we may discover the causes and the characteristics of the currents of Hell Gate. Premising that an currents are catised by disturbances of tke surface level, we may see, without effort, that in harbors visited by a single tide wave, {not materially distorted in its figure from point to point,) slaek current must follow the stand of the tide, since at this

time the surface level is restored. Agaiu, for this sing·Ie tide, the maximum >elocity rnnst occur near tbe tinw of half tide, becmuw at t.ltis tinw the greatPst ris(' or fall, and e011s(·qnentl,\· tlte greatest tilling or draini11g is taking 11h1cP. Tn tl1e ueighborbood of Sa1t<l~- Hook or at Throg's Xeck tlte currents do f<1llow, iu the mamwr we have stated, the local tillP; lmt in tl1e East Ri n·r where two tidP waveR approad1 from opposite directionc;, the changes of surface level, and corn;equeutl.r the currents, bear no direct relation to either tide wave considered by itRelf, but depend upon the nature of the "interference," ~ts it is called. The two tides of our tah1e are supposed to meet at Hell Gate, and giYe rise to those contrw.;t:, of level which appear in onr co1nmn of ''differences}' These differeneeR an~ Urn Yertical measures of the slopel'<-ti<lal hearls, if we may use this term so looselyand they increase from zero to maximum (4.Si feet) in about three hours, then decline to zero in about the same time. 1 haYe distinguished between the dip tnwards the sound and the dip towards the harbor, by giving to the former the lllus and to thl,. latter the minus sign. \Ve observe on ente1·ing our table at 0 hours (i. e., at the instant of the moon's transit) that the ~mrface of the sound is above that of the harbor and that the disparit5· of elevations is increasing. The current should therefore be running westward through Hell Gate. A litt1e before IV hours the sound and harbor :find themselves upon a level an<l tl1erc being 110 head to induce horizontal motion, the wcstwardly current must soon cease. Bnt this equilibrium is again disturbed h,y the dissimilar changt·s of the two tides, and tlie harbor becomes in its turn hight'r thau tht· sournl, so t11at an eastwardly ('Urrent must soou lJe ei1g·eudered wliielt co11ti11uei-; till clJPcked by tht> 11t·xt I'l'Rtnrnti011 of 1eYel wllid1 tak1~8 place at tLl1ont the X hmu, &c.

Tlwre js another prominent feature disclosed by our table and diagram to which J ought to refer in this vrelimenary sketch, heeanse 1 shal1 lm\·e occaRio11 hereafter 1o gin· it importance among the ph,\"Sical peculiarities of Hell Gate. I refer to the absolute elerations of the water at the pPriotl;; of slack and maximum currents. AH I haYe said, the leYel is restored between the sound and the harbor on tl1e lV hour and again 011 the X hour; but the former takeR place at one and tl1ree-quarters foot below our datum plane, while the latter takes place as much abon>. In other ·words, if the conditions of our fahles were reulize<l, t11e deptli of' water at t1ie slack preceding eie easterly lmrreut would be three and one-half feet greater than that which would obtain at the Rlack preceding the westerly current. So also the maximum Yelocity for the westerly current would find nearly three feet mml' water tllan that for the easterly. Actual observation does not present the scheme of interference with the simplicity that I bare given to it in the pree.ediug pages; it will, howeYer, be percf'ived hereafter that I h:1n\ giYen, as an introduction to the Rubject, not a mere ltypothPRit; hut a generalization from matul'e :stmly. The following snmmmy of t.lrn leading· i1oints which I haYe attempte1l to illustrate· will serve as my gnide in the arrangement of my observed data: First. Two tide waves yisit New York Harbor, meetinµ: and ovprlapping at Hell Gate. Second. Near the meeting point of thei-;e two ti<lt·s the o!Jst~l'H\!l height.sand tinws of the compound tide are intermediate.· Third. The currents of Hell Gate are called into exist.ence Ii~- the variations in the relatfre heights of the sound and harhor; their epochs have no direct relations with those of the loeal tide or its components, and their velocities do not depc11d upon the local rates of rise or fall of tide. Fourth. The current flowing wcstwar·d through Hell Uate oecupii~s a greater section tlum that flowing to the eastward, because the former prevails during higher stages of th(· local tide than the latter.

I do not propose to desPrihe in detail the fiel<l-work which forms the basis of this discussion, because the annual reports of the CoaRt Survey may be referred to for this information; hut I ought perhaps to state briefly the history of the inquiries in Hell Gate.

tidal ~Llld nine current stations were occupied during a. brief period. At one of the tidal stations the observations were kept up continuously, but at each of the other stations a i;iugle day's observations were recorded. The n·sults from this sm·n·y were sithseoquentl.'- mapped out by Lieutenant Commanding JJ. D. Porter and forwarded b,\· Professor Bache to the Sew York Chamber of Commerce, whieh liad solidted the information. Tlie eom·s1·;.; and veloc:ities of tlw currents m1 well a:,; the tide-fables upon the Coast SurYe,v chart, now in the market, are from the first sm·n· ...-; tlw snhl'le11nent more elaborate snrveyR adt'led few new foatnres, alt110ngh they were requil'lite to develop the laws of the pheuomena. In the year 1857 Profr·ssor Bache i1rntitutcd a dotai1c(l survey of Hell Gato, and int111st,ed the exeoution of the work to rn;1·self. During the spring aml summer of 1851 four tidal stations were Oflcupied for continuous and simultaneons obsernttions throngh more than one entire lnna.tion, besides a few temporary i>tatiom; occupied for single <lays. At the same time ouserrations of the current;;;; were made at eight stations. At three of the:-;e current stations ohsen'ations C\'Cl";\ half hour were kept up over se1en dayR; at others for twenty-four hours and over. The next season, 1858, further olH-iervatious were made. A tide gauge was set up at Throg's Neck to work in conjunction with that at Go.-ermir's Island arnl eontinued in imperfect operation for a lunation; me~m whifo eigJi.teeu eurrent stations were occupied covering the spnce from Green Point to Execution Rocks. The largp:-;(. s.erieli at any oue (~U1Te11t statim1 was eigl1t days. Observations upon the courses and velodties of free tloats through Hell Gate were also ma(le; and a few temporary tidal stations wen' occupied. The tables that I Rhall introduce are compiled from the obse1Tations of 1857 :wd 1858; but it is proper to remark tliat with these before me I have looked back over the diagrams of the 1irst survP,y, or reconna.i:;;sance, and found in them all the leading features distinetly exhibited. The first table from actual ohs1~rYatio11s that I c:m offor is that giving the general elements of the tides at selected points along· the im;ide routt· from New York Bar to Throg's Neck, to which is aclded the distances of the statious measured along the sailing line, from Sandy Hook.

It will he olmerved that the wave which enters at Throg's Neck is about. four hours behind that which euterli at Sandy Hook, while at intermetliate points, in Hell Gate, the comfJmmd of these
two waves gives us intermediate times of high and low water. Agitin it will he observed that the mean range at Throg's ~eek is about fifty per cent. great.e.r than at Sandy Hook, while from Governor's Island to lfoll Gate Fe1Ty it fall~ bPlow either of tbe extremes.

I giye upon diagram* tlle obseiTed tilles of Hell (-i-at0 Ferr.Y, Hallett',.; Point, and Pot C<n-e for a period covering one lunation, at a quiet se.as011 of the year. The most preci:-m statement that we can make from au in;,;pectiou of tlw tliagram* and fable No. 2 is, that between Hell Gate Ferry and Pot Hock, tile two tiues al m1_>·,.; meet. It is iu this space that the most rapid change from high or low wat.L·r iutmTal twenrs-~1 llont l1' 30 111 in a space of less than three-quarters of :t mile-and it is in this space that tlw raage,; altl'r mo,;t rapidly, 1.40 feet. It is also in this space tltat the greate;;t disturbance of leyel oceurs; on the .:l\'erage 1.30 feet for the maximum con tr ast8 of l1eigllts on each tide. In the rntroductot'.\" remarks of this report I han· Rtated that hetwee11 the meeting tides the maximum ditfeTence of len~l ought to be 4.87 feet; aml this contrast of lieight actually occms, but is not confined to the narrow limit of Hell Uate, hut in fact is diYideu l>YPr a spae'' of perhaps twenty miles. Advancing from Sanely Hook we fit-st detect the intermingling of the Som1<l tide in the slight distortionR of the GoYeruor's Island tidal profile. t This di:stort.iou hPcomPs markPc1 h,1 thP time we reach a station at the foot of Fifty-third street near the west end of Blackwell';;; falan<l. In diagram* I offer a comparison of the tiditl profiles at the two extremitic;; of tlw weRtl'rn Blackwell's Channel from simultaneous observations. Upou the same diagTmn I han~ plotted the residual from a subtraction of one of these obserned tid('S from tlw otl1c'r. It will he seen that this develops a curve wJ1ich is at once recognizflcl as a fraetional lllnltiple of thP Round d1·la_>·P<l (m; its interval would indieate) about 011e hour in its jnm·m·y from Tlirog's Xeck. Tlw range of this multiple of the Sound tide is about Ji\- feet; we conclude from this that foll one-lrnlf of the Sound tide loses itself in traversing this channel. If thiR is Ro, we cannot coucein· thi:s Sonnd tide to be an independent wave. It was observed, in tracing; the intcrf\'.rem'('R of the tvrn ti1le8 of the Yi1w.ymd Sound, that after meeting at vVest Chop each tidP "nfferPd a rapi<ldeclim', and was to he distinctly followed but a short distance into the domain of tht> otlwr. In thii-i plac(· as i11 Hell Gate J.hp two tides have acquired such distinct forms that in their compou11d their relative po:-;ition cau he detctf'd by the eye on the plottecl profile. I concefre that the coutra-8!R of heigl1ts preReuted hy the waYes have been in part accommodated by the local action of gravity, not reduced to a I'C!!;Ular slope, however, because the time is limited.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

From a single da3-'R observations that I have plotted below,
Tidal c11rrtB in Hdl (;ate, ol1serced at stations only 100 feet apart on eithe,. siM of the Hallet'· Point RRej.

it appears that we may narrow down the meeting place of the tides to a space. of about one hundred feet oft' Hallett's Point. In this small space, 011 the 6th of June, 1857, the intervals of high water diftered two hours, and the heights, at maximum, one foot. I£ we examine closely the obi,;ervations of Pot Cove, we discover there as little trace of the western tide as we do of tlie tiasterrr at Fifty-third street. In other words, the eastern tide is followed with equal distinctn.ei,;s eight times as far from the meeting point as the westeru. The greater range of the eastern tide accounts for this in great measure; but enm if t.he two waves had the same range, their relations of time might be expected to give rise to different effects. For instance, a' the western tide proceeds towards the sound, its times of high and low water approach coincidencp, with those of the sound tide; while, in the order of things upon the other side of the meeting point, the case is reversed, the sound tide is more and more widely separating from tlie western tide as it approaches New York Harbor. It is obvious that at periods of great diurnal inequality the evidences of interference ought to be discernible a greater distance to the eastward of the meeting place of the two tides. The effects of interference upon the ranges on either side of the meeting place of tide waves of different intervals, ought to be the reyerse of each other. The range of one should be augmented, the other diminished. We do not recognize these contrasts of effects in the two approaches to Hell Gate, and I am convinced that the reason why we do not is that the two tides lose in great measure their original wave character and submit to the local action of gravity which, as I have before said, tends to reconcile all contrasts of elevation.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Some of the larger tides of IIallett's Point and Throg's Neck were lost, so that we have thought it best to omit the imperfl'ct curves for these stations. In table :Xo. 4, I gin· the lunar inter>als and lwights at which the surface levels are restored in Hell-Gate; aud, in taule No. 5, tl1e intel'vals and Yeloeities of tlrn currents. The surface of the Gate bee11mcs len~l :tbrmt, one hour before the slack prececliug the westerly current, and about fortyi(mr mumtes before tbe slack preceding the easterly current. 1f we compare these tinws with those of the tide, we fiml the first slack over two homs before the local high water, and the ~econd slack two hours before the low water.*

We observe that during most of the period of rising· tide in the harbor, the current is flowing in from the sea at Sandy Hook and out into the Sound at Hell Gate; aml during most of the falling tide it pursues the reverse course. The pilots, therefor<', call the inflow from the Sound " ebb," and the outflow "ffood.'' I do not use these term:,;, because tllf.'Y are not correctl;r applied and are calculated to mislead, as will be apparent on closer inspection of our uiagram. During the first hour after the moon's transit (and while the thh· is falling 1wer our entire field) a continuous current flows from Long Island Sound hy way of Throg's Xcek. Ikll Gak, and the East River, through the Upper into the Lower Harbor, and out to sea over tlie Bar at Sand3· Hook. During the second hour after the moon's transit this continuous :,;tream still preYails, excPpt near Sand's Point, where the easterly (ebb) current of the Sound i1rPniils. Thl~ 11eighlmrl1m1(1 of the Steppiug Stones is at this time the scene of a separation of two graur1 streams from a sttm-

mit.
During the third hour the summit is at Throg1s N e<lk, and from tllis point a stream flows eastwardly through the Sound, and another stream taking the opposite direction flows through New York Harbor. Both are continuous in opposite directions to the ocean, in which the tide has commenced to rise rapidl;\'· During the fourth hour after tTansit the streams are broken up through Hell Gate, and Raritan Bay is receiving sup1)lies of water from the Hudson Rh·er and from the ocean. During the :fifth hour after transit the Hudson RiYer is still pouring into Raritan Bay a failing stream, and a loeal ctirrent to tlw eastward through H<>ll Gate commences. During the sixth hour after transit the Upper Harbor in tllP path of the Hmlson becomes slack, while a stream sets into it from the Lower Harbor, and another stream sets out of it into Long Island Sound. During the seventh hour the current becomes continuous from the ocean through ~cw York Harbor into the Sound. 'J'he tide is rising throughout our entire field. During the eighth hour high water occurs at Sandy Hook, and the half-tide stage is reached in Hell Gate. The current is a continuous flow towards the Soundas far as S;wd's Point, where a depression exists towards which t.be currents from either direction are flowing. During the ninth hour the movement oYer the Outer Bar ceases; the Upper Harbor reaches its maximum elevation and commences to fall, hut still a steady stream sets into the Sound upon the one hand, and up the Hudson u11on the other. During the tenth hour high tide occurs from point to point along the East Rh,er anti at Dobbs' Ferry, in the Hudson. A pretty general slacking up of the Up1)er Harbor drifts takes place, although the Hudson inflow still obtains. During the eleventh hour after transit the Hudson inflow ceases; but a stream flows from the East River, (as far as the Gate,) and, uniting with an ebb stream of the HarbOl' anu that of Raritan Bay, makes the flow continuous to the ocean. During the twelfth hour the current from the Sound, Ullitiug with that of the Harbor, flows into the sea as a continuous stream.

APPENDIX No. 14.
REPORT

SL;RVEYS IN THE MERRIMACK RIVER, MADE IN 1867 BY HENRY MITCHELL, ASSIST,ANT L. S. COAST SURVEY. '

BOSTON, Oct<Jber 31, 1867. SIR :-I respectfully announce t-0 yon the completion of the surveys in the Merrimack River a,s far as at present required by the Pentucket Navigation Company, at whose expense the work has heen executed; and I have the honor to submit herewith a physical map of Mitchell's Falls, (mav No. 2,) together with numerous tables, to which I shall hereafter refer in this report. Mr. H. L. Marindin, of the Coast Survey, who was assigned by you to execute surveys under my direction, commeneed measuring base lines on the 3d of September. From these bases he developed both shores of the river for a distance of two miles, from Ring Bolt Rock (about a mile and a half aboYe Haverhill) to Kimball's Island, and fixed the positions of stakes about one hundred and fifty feet apart on either side of the river. In the course of this preliminary work he also determined the positions of all the important rocks in the river-those visible and those made appaxent by their rip1)les. There are about one hundred such rocks plotted upon the map, besides those found and fixed in position during the soundings, which followed later. I deemed it essential that these principal obstructions should be accurately laid down, not only hecause they were to be avoided, as far as might be, in projecting the course of the proposed artificial channel, but also llecause they indicate to the eye the nature and causes of the rapids. It was often necessary to send a signal man to these rocks so as to enable the observer at the plane table to distinguish them from his different positions, and to plot them more exactly. The stakes along the river, to which I haYe referred, were designed to serve as points of departure and termination for the sounding lines where these were not otherwise fixed in position by boat angles. In. order to ascertain the elevations and slopes of the river's surface and bed, and to correct the soundings so as to give a truthful representation of the depths throughout our field at a given time or stage, I established four gauges at the outset, and ultimately increased the number to ten, (designated by Roman numerals upon the chart.) :kach gauge was referred to a local bench, and :finally all were reduced to the same datum. The ten benches on the right bank of the river, designated by B 1, Bz, B3, &c., upon the chart, are all marked by holes drilled in the toi>s of boulders; a.nd the relative elevations of these, given in Table No. 1, are the results of three accordant lines of levelings, with the foot of the staff resting over the drilled Jwk in each case. The plane-table work, the soundings, and the levelings were executed by Mr. Ma.rind.in, in .a very creditable manner, and in a much shorter time than I had expected. He was favored by .fine weather, and he found in Mr. Koppmann and Mr. McClintock excellent and willing co-operators. Mr. Dmrrinicus Koppmann was temporarily employed because of his talents as a faithful draughtsman, and his a.cquaintance with some of the Coast Survey methods. Mr. McOlintock, a new a1>pointment upon the Coast Survey, discovered at once a disposition and an ability to make himself useful, as the field-books will show. Before proceeding to point out the results reached by the sm·yey, it behooves me to state the claims which the map ha.s to your confidence. It is not based on the Coast Survey triangulation, and tlie Qnly instruments used have been the plane-table, sextant, and level. Nevertheless the distances and all the visible features of the river are correctly represented. The only misgivings I have a.re with regard to rocks. I am afraid that some important boulders, hidden in the turbid waters of the channel-way, may have escaped our search. With some experience of the requirements of navigation, and some also of the wants of the marine engineer, we have endeavored to make a faithful survey upon which plans and estimates may be safely based. Beyond these practical objects we have not ventured. · A.-Mitchell's Falls is the genera.I name for the locality covered by the map, which embraces three sets of rapids, no one of them deserving the title of fallA. Two of these rapids are known, respectively, as Upper and Lower Falls; and the third, having no recognized na.me, we call
DEAR

THE UNI'I!ED ST.A.TES COAST SURVEY.

Hazeltine Rapids. The obstructions at the Upper Falls are confined to a distance of about seven hundred and eighty feet, those at the Lower Falls to a distance of about seven hundred and forty feet, and those of the Hazeltine Rapids to a distance of about one thousand feet. The foot of the Up1ler Falls is the limit of the tide, which enters our fie]d with a range of four feet at the station near Ring Rock. There was no flood current in any part of the fiel<l during our stay. At and above the Upper Falls the changes of elevation during the day are simply those due to variations of river discharge caused by the opening and shutting of the mill gates of Lawrence. .As high water, at mean, Yisits this portion of the ~Ierrimack at 11 to 12 o'clock, and as at this time of day the discharge reaches a nearly uniform stage, I have found it convenienL to take for the plane of reference the surface of the river at this time. The chart then exhibits the ordi1iary high water conditions at mid-day when the moon is in octants. In sub-sketches, I haye given the depths on the rapids at 7 and 9 a. m., when low-water spring tides preYail. The river is usually at its minimum. discharge in the morning during summer-the gates being closed during the night. B.-In Fig. 1 I have given a section of the river along its line of greatest de1>ression, Hl10wing the elevations of the bottom, the form of the plane of reference, and, in dottt~d line, a profile of the low-water plane to which the sub-sketches are reduced. In this section the least depths are, at Upper Falls, three feet for high stage, and two feet for low stage ; at the Lower Falls, fh--e feet for high water, and three and a half feet for low water; and at Hazeltine Rapids, nine feet for high water, and five feet for low wat~r. The numerical data for this section 'vill be found in Table No. 2. This line of greatest depression, although it is that of' the thread of the current at low water, does not give a characteristic view of the bed of the stream; I have therefore given another section (Fig. 2) which is characreristic of a belt one hundred feet wide along the middle of the riYer. The least depth at Upper Falls is two feet for high water, and one foot for low water; at Lower Falls, two feet at high wat.er, and three-fourths of a foot at low water; at Hazeltine Rapids, four feet at high water, and half a foot at low water. (See Table No_ 3, for elements_) The excavations which should render the river navigable would follow neither of the sections we have given throughout. It would properly follow both of them in a 11:eneral way at Upper Falls, the line between them at Lower Falls, and the line of greatest depression at Hazeltine Rapids. At the Lower Falls the first section line lies too close to the shore and at too sharp a curve, at some points, to make it a practicable triwk for towage in the midst of a strong current. 0.-Upon the sections referred t-0 above, (Figs. 1 and 2,) I have given the velocities in nautical miles per hour, at the two stages over the two falls. These are not the extreme >elocities observed, but the reduced averages for the spaces covered by the figures. On the Lower Falls we made current obseryations near times of high and low water, and measured the slopes. For period near time of high water we found a mean veloeity of 1.90 nautical miles per hour, corresponding to a Slope Of 0.41 feet per 1,000 j at period near low W~tter a mean velocity of 2.9 nautical miles with a slope of 2.1 feet per 1,000. With the general expression Velocity= a ../p we, have for high water coefficient 2.93, and for low water coefficient 2.00. I think that these coefficients are practieally near enough to the truth for use in calculating mean velocities for other slopes which may occur at other stages of the river and tide. In the lower chute of these falls the minimum velocity was found to be 6.6 miles per hour at low water, but at high wate1· only 2.5 in the same place. On the Upper Falls the greatest velocity was found near the foot of the decline, (not in the shallowest water,) and amounted to four miles at low stage, and 5.5 at high stage. It will be observed that the velocity at the Upper Falls is greater for the 1iigM7 atage, while at the Lower Fa.lls it is greater for the lower stage. There is pothing str~nge in this; the friction declines greatly as the water rises in the Upper Falls, while on the Lower Falls the high. tide diminishes the slope
~~~~I~

.

The low-water slope given upon Figs. 1 and 2 for Lower Falls is the grearest I observed, although the gauges were compared for other dates when the low tide fell at hours of the day corresponding to higher stages of the river-; it will, however, be rememb_ered that these were tides of less range, the mid-day low tide& being those of neaps, or nearly so. D.-Tbe relations of water elevations from point to point at different hours of the day may be

understood from Fig. 3 of the Physical Map, in which I give the observations of Sept,ember 27 and 28 combined. This figure rPpTesents the conditions from 8 a. m. to 6 p. m. for ordinary river discharge combined with the spring tide. It is plotted from Table No. 4. It will be obserYed that Station I is visited by the phases of the upper half of the tide; that the rise is tidal ft)r a space of nearly three hours, from 11 a. m. till 1!! p. m. The fall is more tardy, as in all tidal rrivers, and I cannot say at what hour it ceases to be tidal. The change of elevation <lue to tl1t> tide of this station is about four feet. At the next station, situated three thousand five hundred feet higher up tlrn river, and above the Hazeltine Rapids, the rise is distinctly tidal for less than onf' hour and a half, and the change of elevation due to t,ide is at this station aoout one and a half foot. At the next station (HI) we find the elevation parallel to those just mentioned at II. At Station IY, between tlle two chutes of the Lower Falls, we have positive indications of the tide, but not well defined phases. At Stations V and VI we have still the tidal rise, but ill defined. As we mount the Upper Rapids, we lose at Station vll not on1y a11 traces of the tide, but, at the honr when l1igh water should occnr, we have a depression caused by the shutting of the mill gates of La:1uence at dinner-time, (12 to 1.) At the other gauges above we have changes nearly parallel to those already noticed at VII. In all of these the dinner depression is well marked, but is sharpest at VIII, a station on the Upper Falls. The feature which will interest you most in this diagram (Fig. 3) is the rise of the tidal plane. You will observe that in the 1-;paee of one mile above Station I the absolute height of high water increases a half foot. In the Hudson River we found a rise of only threefeetin one hundred and forty miles. E.-In Figs. 4, 5, 6, and 7, I have given sections of the Upper and Lower Falls. I perceived that cross sections, vertical to the river banks, would not represent characteristic features of the bottom, and would conYey very erroneous impressions of the capacity of the stream ; I t.herefore carried the section across in the directions of strike and dip. (See Tables.) At the I .. ower Falls a ledge is partially uncovered, and appears to have formed the nucleus of" the accumulation that now constitutes the dam and causes the rapid. At the Upper Falls there is no ;;risible ledge, but it is a suggestive fact that the bar which causes the rapid has a strike not widE>ly at -variance with that of the aforesaid ledge, the former having a course south 1~0 east, the latter south rnto west, while the general courses of the river at the two points differ about 1420. The tieM-hooks of this survey have been properly duplicated and Rent to the Coast Survey archive!'; at 1'.,.ashington. lam convincr,d that this river can be made navigable for barges of four feet draught, without locks or other expensive structures. After the requisite depth is obtained by excavations, the single difficulty is the strong currents at the rapid. Thp,se currents will probably be stronger than now, in the narrow excavation, because the friction will be lessened without material lessening of the slope. That towage over these rapids is impracticable with the usual appliances, l consider too patent to admit of tliscussion; there is, however, a sim11le way of getting the barges up which I takt; the liberty to mention, in the crude form that the idea has occurred to me. I should cut straight passes through each of the rapids and place buoys (or rings in the rocks) above and below the ebute. On arriving at the lower mooring, I should secure the barges, then pa.y out my hawser and run to the upper mooring; secure the steam-tug here, then bring the hawser to the windlass, and, connecting the latter with the engine, haul the barges up to the same point. Of course the windlass and its connection with the engine should be arrangefl with special adaptation t.o the purposes mentioned. No excavations ne-ed be made nor moorings provided at the Hazeltine Rapids, until the commerce shall become too great to admit of the delay, near time of low water, that the present conditions make necessary. In looking back upon this very interesting work, and forward to its ultimate objects, I find cause to regret that tlie company should hare hesitated to afford the means for the further development of some of its details; because a iWllar s-pent in pr&perly basing a project is worth ten in the

execution.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 15.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT HENRY MYI'CHELL ON SOUNDINGS MADE TO DEVELOP THE CHARACTER OF THE STRAIT OF FLORIDA, BETWEEN KEY WEST AND HAVANA.
BOSTON, August 5, 1867. DE.AR Sut: Under date of April 20, I had the honor to receive from you instructions "to contirme the investigations which were begun last year in the Gulf Stream, between Florida Reef and the coast of Cuba, with a viewto determine the best line for a telegraph cable between Key West and Havana,'' and if possible to push tlie observations beyond this immediate object, so as to add to our general knowledge of the stream. The Coast Survey steamer Corwin, with the surveying party on board, under command of Acting Master Robert Platt, United States Navy, was placed at my 11 disposal," and Captain L. F. Pourtales, of the Coast Survey, was directed to accompany us and lend his knowledge of natural science to the enterprise. Captain Flatt's party was already at work on the Florida Reef, and Mr. Pourtales and myself, having prepared our equipments very much to our satisfaction, joined the steamer at Key West on the 13th of May. Although we felt, at the outset, some misgivings because of the lateness of the season, the interest and early success of our operations very soon wholly engrossed our minds, and our own enthusiasm seemed to communicate itself to all others on board till the appearance of yellow fever amongst the crew, and the fatal termination of some of the cases, put an abrupt barrier upon further progress. Our communications were cut off b,r quarantine, and rather than remain idle in a sickly climate we decided to anticipate your orders for our return. We, therefore, left for Port Royal on the 7th of June. Our action has receivecl your cordial support, and we feel that this was due. I shall proceed to report npon the fragment of work accomp1ished. After the necessa.ry preparations for active work, such as coaling, unpacking apparatus, &c., we left Key "\Vest for Havana on the 17th of May. Finding the sea unusually smooth beyond the reef, and that we were likely to have a calm day, we decided to lie to on the one hundred fathom line and test our instruments. By using different lines and weights, and suffering the registration to go on without resetting, we determined the coefficients of our indicators. We also drilled our men in all the manruuvers with the deep-sea lines and leads, and satisfied ourselves that in a depth of one hundred fathoms, at least, a dredge could be used with facility and success. While these trial observations were going on we kept a close watch upon the drift of the ship, and for sh mt periods anchored a boat and measured the currents. We discovered that the current ran five or six hours to the westward, and afterwards to the eastward, in other words, that we were drifting with tidal current~. The most singulM cireumstance about these currents was that thefalling tide ran t-0 the west-ward and tlw rising t-0 the eastward, the reverse of what I should have expected. We designed to repeat these observations at other stages of the moon but had not the opportunity. Our position was ten miles south of Sand Key light. The eastwardly flow was fou.r times the velocity of the westwardly drift, showing the infl.uence of the Gulf Stream. I am convinced that good service to navigation may be done by series of observations made from anchorage stations along the coast within the Gulf Stream. If there are, as has been so often stated, counter currents to the Gulf Stream which sweep in upon soundings, our coasters ought to know them, and our charts ought to show them for systematic observations. I have often been impressed with a conviction that the coastwise tidal currents are mistaken for these counter Gulf Streams, and that upon investigation their velocities and epochs may be determined. The space between Hatteras and Cape Canaveral deserves the earliest attention from this point of view. A well-found fishing Yessel with a competent sailing master, and a Coast Survey officer in charge, could make many stations in one quiet season. I offer these suggestions for what they are worth, or for what they may be worth when the Coast Survey can afford these details. After the day's. work above mentioned, we went over to Havana and delivered to the United States vice-consul, Mr. Savage, an unofiieia.l letter from Mr. Seward. Through Mr. Savage we

obtained from the Captain General, after some dela;y, a permit to rendez\-ous at Cborrera, the proposed landing place of the cable. Chorrera ]s a little basin at the mouth of the Almemlaraz Hiver. It is quite open to the north and has no bar or other obstructions at its entrance. The anchorage in three to five fathoms would scarcely accommodate a half dozen vessels, awl tl1e 110lding-grouud is at best !mt coral sand. The river, two miles perllaps from the basin, falls teu or tweln· 1:{~et lW1'}Hmtlicn1ar1.·1, and for some distance below lmrxies on in rapids. Tile b~mks are genemlly ver:1 high, am1 covernd with <lense foliage. except where the rugged ~Lml caver11ou8 limestmie rock crops out. The rather low coast in the vicilrit.y of Ol10rrera entrance is ver.1· ragg·ecl, the l11ackened coral rock being honey-combed and worn iu pot-holes hy the sea. Dnt beyoll(l the water-liue the bottom is comparabYel.'r smooth, and falls off rapidly. The measurement of this decline of the reef apron was fixed upon as a first essay. The season was already too far advanced for us to exped a continuous qniet \H>.lttlter, but ·we found the general rule to be, between daylight and 10 a. m., a smooth sea aml calm; between 10 a. ru. and 4 p. m. a sea breeze from ci~"'tward, at times quite strong, with a ,,;harp sea. After 4 o'clock, hca\-y squalls with t:>rrents of rain usually occurreu, and sometimes accompanied b:-· water SJlonts. U11on Table ~o. 1 and its accompanying profile diagram I han~ gh-en the results of our soundings from Chorrera, northward~ to a point beyond the one-thousaml-fathom li m·, ret seal'cnly twenty miles from the shore. Sefior Don Enrique de AYantave, Sah-lnspcctor General of telegraphs for the Island of Cuba, supplied us with excellent base li11es, comprising the relati \-e position;; of Fort Clwrrera, (cast angle,) .Fort Principe, (tlag~staff,) and }loroLight. Cpon .Fort Clwnera "\Yephu~ed :\Ir. Bi8sell, an aid of Captain Platt's, with instructions (which he cm'Pfull~- followetl) to ang-lt· upon the steamer with his theodolite at i·egular intenals wheneTer in sight; and :'.\Iessrs. Bradford, Glass, anll Lee, from the paddle-boxes or mark-heads of the steamer, wok angles with sextants, not onl.Y upon the determined points as loug as \-isihle, bnt als1-, UfH>ll prominent mountains, 80 as to check their positions upon the Spanish map in our posses,,;iou. There are onlythree stations on this table that lie beyond sight of the determined positions given by l\lr. Avanta\'e. These are the last three, and are quite near enough for any purpose for which this table is likely to be used, e;;pecially as there is 11otl1ing peculiar about tile pron!\' so far out. The most iwee.ipitate slope aetually measured lie,:; about one-half mile fl"()m tlw shorP, where the decline is one vertical to oneand.three-wnths horizontal. This is in tlH· neiglllJorlwoclof the one-lmiulrN1 faJJwm liue. Between tlu~ one and tlie two-hundl'ecl fathom li11es t111~ slopi' L-; still Yt~JT great, one in two and seiwi-tenths. Be;yond this the slope is more gradmtl. mHl at two hundrell irnd se,·enty fathoms we have a tlat space, the top of a terrace. This terrace is remarkable, not only because it presents a decided feature in our diagram of the profile, hut also because it was hen~ that Mr. Pourtales's dredge, on two occasions, brought to light 01'grmic forms in great ahnrnlan(·e and variety. In one of these trials, nearly :i peck of material was emptied upon tlLe 1leek, iu which appeared liYi11g cma1s, sponges, shell-fish, &c., together with other species of tllll same, apparently long dead, and perhaps not of local origin. It seemed to me that succe:;,, in the use of tile dredge depended upon an acquired skill in the proper loading and dragging of the apparatns, and that it might be used in any depth after a little experience. Hereafter, the only use that the "specimen cu11'' of the lead need be put to is to furnish indisputable evidence of the bottoms lJeiug reached. The fore slope of the '·terrace" has at 1ir8t a steep de.cline, one iu tu 111r.n1lsi:c-t.e1itlu;, but further on becomes more gradual, one in fon, as it approaches the four-linndred fathom curve two and a quarter miles off shore. And here we seem to he on the brow of iwother terr:we, far beyond; in a spaee of a mile and a quarter the arera:Je slope is 1~:> gre<1t as mw in three and a. half, with soft mMd at seven hundred and eighty-two fathoms. As it is improbablfl thnt mml can, uIHler any circumRtances, lie at the slope we have mentioned as the aiierage, WI:' are obliged to concPive that the reef apron terminates precipitately.. \Vhile the ship was drifting from the four hundred mHl six.teen fl!thom cast, we cast the dredge and hanfoll it i11 from a position wl1ieh plot,,; ahout wlwr{', tl1e six hundred fathoms should be.

to the extremit.r of the reef apron, and to gratify the curiosity that I have felt to connect the phenomena of life with those of the temperature and pressure of the sea, and to find, perhaps, in these terram~s the limits of range for certain species; since the discovery of life, at great depths, has shaken somewhat my preconceived ideas as to the great age and thickness of the reef. As we h1we said, the sounding in seven hundred and eighty-two fathoms lay quite beyond the extremity of the reef apron in soft mud. I find, consulting the record, that "our lead buried itself two feet (nearly half its length) in a white mud." From this point to the curYe of one thou.sand fathoms (the greatest depth yet obtained in the Straits of Florida) the decline was found on the average about one in se1'enty;four, about the natural slope of muds depositeu on the borders of tidal channels in our harbors and bays. Current ob.~crvation8.-Perhaps there is no locality which offers greater facility for an intimate study of the Gulf Stream than the neighborhood in which we have been working. Here the stream is narrow, and presses close in upon the coast, and here the variations of depth are most rapid. As we have seen from the table of soundings, the thousand fathom line is scarcely out of sight of the high lands of Cuba, and there is am1Jle testimony from different explorations that the variations of temperature with the depth are here most decidedly marked. Although I do not assume that the phenomena presented in a limited section of the Gulf Stream, however well defined, must necessarily reflect tlie couditions of its whole course, I offer our results in Table No. 2 as a few positive facts which are beyond cavil, notwithstanding that they stanrl in contradiction to an accepted theory in defense of which I have myself ofrered circumstantial e1;id.ence heretofore.· I allude here to the theory of a polar current under-running the Gulf Stream and counter to its course. I am rather surprised that this theory, however plausible to explain the low temperature and support the heat origin of the Gnlf Stream, should never have been tested by simple observations upon the facts. The evidence of this table is that the Gulf Stremn has a nearly 1miform velocity, and constant eoursefor a depth of six kundredfatltoms, although its temperature 1,arie.~ in Otis depth 400 Fahrenheit. The means we employed for obtaining the directions and rates of the sub-currents were similar to those described in Appendix No. 26 of the Coast Survey Report of 1859. For deteet-i1ig the e.ri.~tcnce of counter currents or for measuring the changes varying uniformly with the depth, our means will bear criticism. During our stay at Chorrera the inner edge of the stream was occasionally well defined, and lay ft few lmmlred feet from salient {Joints of the raggecl shore line. We were, however, told by the fishermen that it occasionally receded a long distance. It may be seen by our table that we repeated the coastwise current observations, and .on the 23d and 31st, actually traversed the same line witlt our floats with large variations of velocit~'· These Yariations may bear some relation to the ti<le. On the 23d we observed at anu soon after low water, while on the 31st we worked at the high water of au unusually great tide. Our table indicates a diminution of velocity with distance from the two hundred and seventy fathom line; and our reckoning at stations still further out (not given in our table) indicates the same, so that we could but regard the westward bound coasters as following blindly a traditional custom when we saw them " hug the shore" to avoid the Gulf Stream. In preparing my outfit considerations of economy led me to lay in but few detaching leads, especially as I could not comprehend their advantage. From the best testimouy aml reasoning that I could C'AJmmand it appeared that the principal resistances to be overcome in hauling up, were those of friction afong the line, and those resulting from the abrupt fig1ire of the lead; so that seY· enty to one hundred pounds could make but little difference except that it might snap the line in a sharp sea by its dead weight. I therefore reduced my lines to the minimum. size, and gave to my leads the most attenuated forms. But experience has taught me that the form of the lead is unimportant, but that its weight is alt-itnp-0rtant. With eight hunclred fatho~s of line to haul in, fifty per centum more power was required when the se,·ent~--five pound lead failed to detach, than wllen the line and .s1lindle only remained; and at less depths tl1e difference was even greater. I pur1lose to make the forms and weights of leads, in their relation to the resistances to hauling in, matters of spedal experiment, because it, app(\ars to me that some anomalies present themselves here. In comparing onr recent work with that of last year, I am struck with the evidences of im* Am. Jour. Scienoo, Jan., 1867, page 73.

proved manipulation. I think that Captain Platt and hiR execntiYe officer, l\Ir. Dimon, have deYeloped a great deal of skill in meeting the difficulties of deep Rea-work; and J have suggested t-0 the former to write a report on every detail of a working day, that his experience may benefit others. Reports on manipulation are, to my mind, of Vl~r.Y great Yalne wht>ll carefully written. I have presumed that Mr. Pourtales would write out his dPscripliom. of' the orga11isms lnought up from the bottom, and comnnmicate them directly, so I hnn· not askt-d him to join me in this report.

On t11is and subsequent da:rs several specimens of a siphonophora were found attached to the sounding lines, generally in its lower part, but it is not possible to say at what depth tb-0y were floating. TJ1ey were never found in the dredge. On the 25th a cast of the dredge was made in a depth estimated at the time as three hun· dred and fifty fathoms, five hundred and fifty fathoms of line being run out. Mr. Mitchell's plotting seems to indicate deeper water. Very little was obtained and that mostly dead, viz: some

LETTERS OF PROFESSOR AGASSIZ ON THE RELATIO"'.': OF GEOLOGICAL AND ZOOLOGIC_\L RESEARCHES TO GE~ERAL INTERESTS, IN THE DEYELOP:\1ENT OF COAST FEAlTRES.

NAHANT, September 11, 186<. Far from considering _your request a tax upon m:'I· time, it gives me th<> gr<>ate,<;t pleasure to have au opportunit.Y of la.Ying hefore you 1mme statementf' and reflections, whil'11 I trm;t will satisfy yon that geolog;'I· and natural history can be made subsen·ient to the great iutere;.;t;.; of a civilized community to a far greater extent than is generally admitted. The question of the Harbor of Bosto11, for instance, has a geolog'ical and a zoological side »hich has thus far onl.Y been considered indirect]_\·. In order to ascertain wber1Cl' the materials m·e derived which i1ccmnulate in the haruor, the shores ougl1t to be strnlied geologieally with a kind of accuracy and minuteness rnwer required by geological surve;-.·s ma(le for economical purposes. The hanks of the harbor, where\~er it is not rock-hound, consist, of drift which itself rests upon the various rock formations of the district. Now this drift I haYe aRcertained to have extended formerly many miles beyond our present shores, aml it is daily was11ing away by the action of tides, winds, and currents. Until you know with precision the mineralogical comp()sition of the drift of this immediate vicinity, and so accurately as to be able to recognize it in an~- nPw com bi11atfo11 into which it may be brought whe11 carried off b.y t11e sea, all examinatio1Js of soundings may he of little use. Should it however he ascertained that tlie larger amount of loose materials spreading: OYer the harbor is derived from some one or the other of the drift islands in the bay, a sea-wall to stop the denudation may be of greater aud more immcdiak use than any other operation. Again, it is geologically certain that all the drift islands of the h<~rbor haw· formed uy the encroaehment of the sea upon a slleet of drift which extended in unbroken continuity from Cape Ann to Cape Cod and further south. This sl1eet of drift is constantl.r diminishing; and, in centuries to com<', whieh, not· withstanding the immeasurable duration of geological periods, I t111st may be reached while the United States remain a flourishing empire, it will be removed still furtuer, so far, indeed, tliat l foresee the time wuen t.he whole peninsula of Cape Cod shall disappear. Under these circumst:mces it is the duty of a wise administration to establish with precision t11e rate mHl tlrn Pxtent of tllis destn1ctio11, that the coming generations may he forewarned. In this connection I would <Hh-ise the making of a thorough stlr\'e.r of the harbor, to ascertain the extent of rock surface mul of drift, and the re1atiYe position of the two, with maps to show their relations to tl1e different levels of the sea,, whereby the unequal a<ition of the tides upon the various banks may be estim:ited. The zoological side of the question relates to the amount of loose materials aecumulating in consequence of the increase of animal and vegetable life, especiall;y of those microscopic beiugs, which, notwithstanding their extraordiimr.y minuteness, form, in conrse of time, Yast (leposits of solid materials. Ehrenberg has shown that the harbor of Frishhaff, on the Prussian coast of the Baltic, is filling, not in consequence of the accumulatiou of inorganic sediments, but by the rapid increase and decay of innumerable animalcules. To what ext~nt such deposits ma;y accumulate has also been shown by Ehrenberg, who ascertained mauy years ago that the eity of Berlin rests upon a deposit of about eighteen feet in thickness, consisting almost exclnsin·ly of tht' solid parts of such microscopic beings. These two cases may suffice to show how im11ortant a zoological investigation of t1ie harhor de11osits is likely to be. I need hardly add that the deposits flooded into the harbor by the numerous rh'ers and creeks emptying into it, ought to be investigate<! with the same care and minuteness as the drift materials. This investigation should ·also include the drainage of the cit;y. But this is only a small part of the applications I woultl recommend to be ma(le of geological and zoological knowledge to the purposes of the Coast Surve;y. The reefs of Florida are a subject of the deepest interest, and the mere geodetic and hydmgraphic survey of their whole range would be far from exhausting the subjeet. It is my deliberate opinion that the great reef of _Florida

deserYes to be explorerl with as much minuteness and fullness as the Gulf Stream, and that the investig~1tion will rN111in· a;;; much lahor and time as has thus far been bestowed upon the Gulf Stream. Hen· again g·Pological and zoolog·ieal knowledg;e is imlir,;pensable to the completion of the work. 'l'lw r1>t·f eonsists maiutr of the accmnulated Rolid materials of a variet;1~ of animals and a te"~ pla11t.s. The rPiatiou,.; of these animab aud plants to one au other while ali ni in and upon the reef, onght to be studied more fully than has hee11 the (·m;e before, in ordei· to determine with certafot;1· the sliare t11ey lia Ye in tl1e fonnatiou of tlwr,;e immeuse submarine walls, so dangerous to narigation. The imryeyc;, as they haye been made thus for~ furnish m1ly tlie 11ece8sary inforn;ation coucerning tlte pn·scnt form autl extent of the l't'ef. Bnt >Ye know that it is coustantl;y changing, increasing·, enlarging, spreacling, ri,.,;11g in Rnclt a way awl at such a rate that the surveys of oue centur,v b(·conw iuRutlkiPnt for the next. A knowlpclge of tlH'8t; chaug·e8 can only be obtained hy a naturulist fawiliar with tlw 8t111eture aud mode of growth of animals. The sm·w;y I made about fifteen year:'i ago, :it the req111~st of .rour Jame11tr~d prP1lpcpssor, could ouly be considered as a reconuaio;:o;auee, in Yiew of the extent and importaH<'l' of t11e work. I woald, therefore, reco11mw11d to you to organizP a party RJlt·<·iall.\- detailed to carry on these inYestigatiow;, in connection with and by the side of the regular geodetic aml hy<lrograpliic sm·Yey. Ilere, also, would geolog·ical knowledg(· be of great achantage to the explorer; al](} iu f'1mfir111ation of my recommendation 1 need 0111;1· rPmind yon uf :1 :-;trikinp; fact in the histor,\- of our science: More than thirty years ago, bdore Dana & Darwin had published tlH\ir heautiful i11Ye8tigatious upon the coral reefs, a pnpi1 of mine, the late Amant Gressly, had traced the structure and mode of growth of cornl rppfs, and atolls in the .Zum .}fountain,.;, tlnm anticipating by a geological inYestig<ttion what zoologists did afterwards b~- dredging in tlie cwean. Tlw structure of the reefs of our shores is therefore more likely to he fully mtderstoocl by one who is e11nall,y familiar with zoology and geology than b~· a su1Te,ror who lias no farniliarit,Y with either of the:,;e sciences. There is another I't'a.SOll wll.r I would strongly urge upon yon the application of natural sciences to tlie work of the snrYey. The depth of the ocean is a great obstacle to a satisfadory exploration of its bottom. Hut wc kuow now that nearly all dry land bas been sea bottom before it was raised aboye the levd of the water. This, at least, is the caRc with all me stratified rocks aml m1neons dq1osits forming part of the earth's crust. Now it would greatl;r facilit:tte the stun,r of tht> bottom uf the sea, if, afte.r ascertaining by soundings the general character of the bottom iu any pa1ticular region, corresponding bottoms on dry land weri~ exmni11cd aud hoth better apprn· ciate<1 hy a comp:nison of the OJH' with the other. The shoals of the southern coast of 1\fassachnSPttR ha Ye beeu snrn·yed, aucl their position is now known with great accuracy; but their internal strneture, their mo11e of fomiation, iR only imperfectly ascertained, owing to tlrn difficulty of cutting into thPm aml examiiiing in sitn the materials of which they are composed. Nothing, on the cont.ntr,\', hrnai;;ier tlmu to explore the structure and composition of the drift-hills, which are cut through h_y all om· railroad track8. ::Sow the shoals arul rips of .Nantucket; Jmn:\ their counterpart on tlie maill laud; and even along the shores of BoRton Harbor, in the direction of Dorchester and l\Iilton, snclt shrn1l.-: nwy be examined far away from the wat<-rs to which they owe their de1>osition. Here, theu, is the place to complete the exploration for which soundings and dreclgings giYe only imper· foct i11formatio11. I nePtl uot. extend tliese remarks further to Ratis(y yon of the importance of geological and zoological re-<;earc11es in connection with the regular operations of the Coast Survey. Permit me, however, t-0 add a few words upon some points which seem to me legitimately to belong to the Coast SnrYey, to which suffieient attention has not yet be,en paid. I allude, first, to the salt marshes of onr 8horcs, their formation and uses, a.s well as their gradual disappearance under the adyancing progresR of tlte sea ; second, to the extended low islands in the form of reefs stretching along the coast of the southeru States, the bm1is of which may be old coral reefs; third, to the form of all our estuarie;,;, which has resulted from the conflict of the sea with the drift formation, aud is therefore, in a measure, a geological proh1t>m ; fourth, to th-0 extensive deposits of foraminifora along the coast, which ought to be compared with the deposits of t.ripoli found in many tertiary formations; fifth, to the general form and outline of our continent, with all its indentations, which tire due to their geological structure. Indeed, the character of every harbor is the result of

The first part exhibits the incc1itio11 anrl plan of work proposed, and the details of e:xt·cution; tlien follow descriptions of the coast, of the gn·at ( ceauic cuneats of tlu~ Xortlt l'ticiik. arnl th<' <li..;cussion of their intlneuce upon the routes IJetwceu .Japan nrnl Chiua :rntl the Paci tic eo:ist of the United States; of the climate, veg-(·table prodnetious of tlw couutry, the minerals. ti;.;heries, furs, &c., and of tlw inhabitant;; and tlu_·ir prospecth-e relation to the He'Y order of rules aml t1·ade, with offidal statements of their timn bers. J>etnilK of the coai-;t li1w, harhors, ha.\;;, hei11llamli;;, &1·., nrP giYen, in part from personal obsern1tio11, lmt prineipally from tl1P <le:-<cripti0118 of Y mH'OIIY<:'r, J\foarer, Portlock, Dixon, Li;;iansky, &c. A liM of fonr hundrcu and thirty-four geographi«al positions is giYen in the appernlix;, · Geographical determinations depeJl(ling upon the fi<'ld computation of As;;ist:mt :\fosman'8 astronomical observations nre giw·n for the stations occupied. T!Je general coast map, not yPt fini8lwcl, is compiled from the maps of Tebcnkoff, from manuscript ma].)s, kindly fnrnishe(l me by l'ri11ce l\laksoutoff, govcn101· of the 1ate }{u8sian colonies, and from examinations of my own. I also p1·01wse a plan of carrying on the work in this new rpgiou, wlwre the rt>fiJW(l metlrnds of more favorable coasts must be modified, aud instrnuwnts impro,-ed to outain observations rapidly with our usual p1-ecisiou. The.mode of working, means b.\· which accnratt.· result!' cau he obtained, and the llroper season for fielll 1m.rties, havP been especially studied, aml I mu sure that iu these matte-rs alone the Coa.st Survey bas obtaiul'd information aud experience \rhich will more than save the cost of our operations on tl1is expedition in the next se:umn's ·work. The appendixes colltain information that could not well be introduced in the body of the t"e}lort, and yet of interest a.nd value. Throughon.t the :report all bearings are true, nnle;;s otherwise spPdally mentioued, a,nd distances arc in nantica.l miles. Even on a coast with prevailing good weather aud control of the steamer's movements, the amount of labor for a full season would lmve been large for a party limited to live perso11s; but on a coast compa.ratively unknown to us, and proverbial for thick, i~tiuy, and heavy weather, it could not be exi)ected that all would be aecomplished in less tlrn.11 three :months of a working season. The iutei1tion was to ooyer the ground as far as pmcticable, and

In mw of th·~m an ext.t':usi\e deposit of :fhm, white mai·llle was found abont fift.eeu miles from Sit.ka, cropping ont upon the wa.tcr'.s edge, with deep water close to it. T11is will furnish good material for the construction of light-houses. Dr. Ke1logg, botanist, was unremitting in hi;:; examinations of the botan:y of the vicinity. Prince -1\:Ia.Jn.;outoff directed t11at specimens of the different woods be obtained for me by our return. Mr. Harford, Cllrlchologist and naturalist, seized every opportunity of adding to our collect.ion of shells, and obta.im,rl and pr<>sf·rved tlw specimens of birds shot.

mil.es north of the northern assigned position; but no rocks were seen and no special exanriDation attempted, although birds were seen and heard that do not go far from land. To determine the position of this danger was one of the duties of my original plan, as some doubts arc expressed of its existence, even by tlle navigators of the Russian-American Company; but I refer you to my descripth"e report of this coast for particulars. From Sitka to this place we had a current in our favor of allout t.en miles in forty-three hours. From the Parn1)lona Rock a course was lai1l to pass near the assigne<l po:,;ilion of the Sea Otter Banks, especially as it would only increase the distance to Port Etches half a dozen miles; but during the day, the weather looking squally from the southeast, and the pilot reporting the general prevalence of bad weather at the entrai1ce, the programme was changed, and the vessel headed for St. Paul on tlte island of Kadiak, which we reached August 26, through thick weather. On this trip observations for time and latitude were made h,y Mr. Mosman upon every opportunit.y. In approaching the northern a.nd eastern part of Kadiak from the direction of Kayak or Middleton Island, the same bank was foumi t.hat Portlock got one sounding of seventy fathoms upon in 1788, in latitude 530 10', and longitude 1490 14', over one hundred miles from St. Paul. The first sounding from the Lincoln was eighty fathoms, over a bottom of Blllall stones, mud, and sand. Fishing-lines were got over, but nothing took the bait, which we subsequently found taken with avidity in another locality. Thence to St. Paul the soundings decreased to forty-five fathoms in thirty-five miles, increasing again half-way to St. Paul t.o ninety-five, with no bottom. At the various localities where bottom was reached, the lead showed broken pieces of rock, black pebbles, &c., always associated with mud. I have named this the Portlock Bank. At St. Paul tlie observatory was at onc.e landed, ancl the astronomical station selected on the bluff at the south sicle of the Chagavka Cove, about half a mile northeast of the town. )fr. Mosman succeeded iu obtaining the first really good observations since leaving San Francisco. During our stay of five days, thirty-seven transits of stars were observed on three nights for error of chrenometers, a.nd one hundred observations on nine stars upon two nights, with the vertical circle, for latitude. Observations were made for absolute magnetic declination with the magnetomet.er, a.1ld azimuth observations made in connection therewith. I° twice measured a base of 432.37 meters, and selected and occupied points for a local triangulation of the northern channel from the northwest point of Woode(l Island to the tlag-sta.ff' in St. Paul; we had only ~ne and a half days' fair weather in which to do the work. Bearings upon the dangerous l'eef ealled Williams Bank, off the entrance to the north channel, were obtained. The looality of a dangerous rock in the middle of the entrance to this channel was given to me by Cap- · tain Archimandritoff, who lost a vessel upon it. I refer you to my lett.er No. :n, August 31, 1867, for a description of the harbor of St. Paul, which was formerly the first, and is now the second post of importance of the Rassian-American colonies. From GeneraLPavloft' I obtained a specimen of the volcanic a.shes that fell in lfaroh, 1867, over this island to the depth of half an inch. The nearest volcano is that of the Redoubt, ele.ven thousand two hundred and seventy feet high, on the west shore of Cook's Inlet, and distant iu a straight line one hundred and sixty-five miles. I was very anxious to establish a tidal station at this place, but while it was difficult if not impracticable to obtain a competent observer, I deemed it more important to establish one on the westernmost island we -should v:ii!it. · It was proposed to visit St. Paul Island in the Behring Sea, and sabsequently Cook's Inlet, both demanding study and consideration as tidal stations. F1'0lil St. Paul I reported t.o you upon the aids necessary "to navigation in approa.ching that anchorage. On the 31st of August we starred for Unalaska, passing out of the north channel of St. Paul threugh a narrow strait, between Kadiak and Spruce Islands; then through tbe northern strait between Kadia.k and Afognak I~lands; then through the Petries or Ohelekoft' Strait, between Kadia.k and the 86tl~ast shores of the peninsula of Alaska. It was impossible "to determine the relativ~ positions @f ~ beadlands along the northwest shore of Kadiak, as the weather had shut down thick, squally, and 1amy before getting through the northern strait, a.nd by evening, when we were oft' thew~ point rJf Ute isl~d, the bad weather had increased, with heavy rain, fog, and squalls from ta.~ At night~ played about the stem. davits.

Ou this trip tlw seermd of the patent logs was lost, and the third could not be ma.de to record reliably. · At noon on the 4th of September the vessel suddenly and unexpectedly made the southeastern part of Sannakh lteef, only a couple of ·hundred yards ahead, in a den;;e fog, with light winds and heavy swell from the southward. For a minute or two she was in the most imminent danger. On the morning of September 15, with variable weather, hottom was found in fifty fathoms, and obserYations for longitude ohtainfld by Mr. Mm;man. At noon the weather was very thick·and drizzly, with a heavy swell from the southward, and bottom found with sixty-five fathoms of line, upon which was a bait()d hook. The lead was allowed t.o remain upon the bottom a few minutes, and when brought up had a fiue cod upon it. All the a,·ailable line,<; were soon in requisition; tbe fish bit so rapidI~- and eager!~- that i'requentl~-two and in some cases three were brougl1t up on one line. We drifted all the aften~oon along this liank to the northward and westward, with the same depth of water, tlle fish biting well, though all were in capital condition and full of food. Their maws were full of a variet.y of fish, among others the halilmt, squid, sea lice, &c. The smallest fish weighed about twelve to fourteen pound;;, tbe heaviest being twenty-seven pounds. We obtained no further observations that day, nor the next, on account of the same thick, disagref'.able weather; but from l\fr. l\fosman's obsen'atious I place that part of the bank where we caught the cod in latitude 530 30', longitude 1640 )'{()', I.ring sixty-five miles east-southeast true from the middle of the Akutan PaI;s, and forty miles south-southeast from the Unimalski Pass. The longitude is better than the latitude. Tlte weather was altogether too unfavorable to make an extended examiuat.ion of the locality. At fom· in the afternoon of &ptember 6 we anchored in the entrance of Ulakhta Harbor, in the bay of 'Cnalaska, aud a couple of miles outside the village and harbor of Illoolook For a full description of this locality I refer you to my letter number 22, dated September 12, when reporting upon the oost position fOl' a light-house in this bay. l\fr. Mosman established the astronomical station on the extremity of the boulder tongue forming the harbor of Ulakhta, and during the seven days of our stay olltained eleven transits of stars for time upon two nights, sixty upon the sun with the vertical circle for latit.ude, and six for azimuth in connection with the observations for absolute magnetic declination. As at all former stations, Mr. Forney assisted Mr. 1\:losman as Tecorder, and as magnetic observer after the instrument was pla(·.t·d in position. I commenced the work for a local triangulation, to embrace Ulakhta and J1loolook Harbor and approa.ches, but aftt.~r settiug up nearly aH the signals and measuring a base of 540 merors on the · :first <lay, was taken violently ill and confined to my berth three days. When the weather permitfod the remaining f'!ignals were set up, and observations made hy Sub-Assistant F.,arqubar, and by Mr. Hamel, with 1\fr. Forney as recorder. During my illness 1\fr. Forney set up the box tidegauge at thfl usual landing place in front of the village of llloolook. When able to visit the ·village I ascertainetl that this situation was not available in winter, on account of th~ swell coming in directly from Behring Sea, not very violently, but too great for the tide-box to withstand, or to obta.in satisfootor.Y results with an untrained observer. A study of the few tides observed here, averaging not over four feet, and therein differing so greatly from the large tides at Sitka and Kadiak, satisfied me of the importance of this station, where the Pacific Ocean and Behring Sea inter<>-0mmunicate. For a permanent station I selected a position at the northwest end of the point formed by the stream behind the town and the bay in front, and made a contract with the factor of the Huss.ian-Americau Company to com;truct a Jlier, as per accompanying written agreement, together with a wharf to c,onnect it with the shore, and also to aslilist the ohserver in removing the gauge from its present 1msition and setting it up at the proposed site. I paid hlm half the contract money in advance. Mr. Mosman established a bench mark npon the church, and determined the difference of level betwe.en it and the top of the gauge. TQ;is difference of level should receive frequent attention, because the earthquakes have in some cases depressed particular loca.lities. I was shown one pa.rt of the point, near that select.eel for the future station, where the ground had sunk about one foot. At the time of our visit no one was com1letent to u~derta.ke this duty. The tidal observer :for this station js an Aleute, named Paul Panshin1 S:lll'geon of tlJe RnssianAmerican Company at this place; besides his regular tidal duties, which are similar ~ ~oliie described for the Sitka. observer, he will make a regule.r series of meteorologieaJ o'b.wrvation.&,.eabm-

cing the barometer, wet and dry bulb thermometers, temperature of the water, sk;Y coyered, force
arnl dirr,ction of the wind, &c. I left with him one Coast SnrYer mean-time chronometer, aneroid barometer, three thermometers, hooks, paper, &c., lantern, hatclH·t, nails, and some pieces of scant· ling, because no wood is found on the isla1lfl. Lest the tide~l)()X be carried awa;y by storms or ice, I left with him a :fifteen-foot open gauge, diYidcd to feet and tenth;,;. His instrnetiom;, of which I furnish you a eopy, were tram1lated iuto Russian. The dates of obserrntion will he those of the United States. In addition to these duties he is to collect at his own expem1e and prese1Te for the Coast Suryey specimens of the skeletons and skins of land and water animals. Por all these i;;er"\ices I engaged to pay him ten dollars per month in gold, and t.ook his voucher for titre<' and a half months' advance pay. The priest of the Unalaska district has promised to advise him if any difficulty should arise. From Innocent Shayesnikoft", priest of tlte Unalaska district, residing at Il1oolook, I obtai1rnd a copy of his original meteorological obse1-vations from October, 18GG, to :::\Ia;1·, 186i, and shoulcl have receiyed much more but that our time was limited, .and he was not aware at :first of my wh1h to gather all s{1ch information. He is a man of sagacity in observing natural phenomena, and would be a valuable person in such a region for collecting information. He gaye me a 8ketch of a paraselene which he observed February 19, 186i, from 8!1: a. m. to 2 p. m. I append sketch of the same, merely as a specimen. From this bay I directed l\Iessrs. Blake ancl Kellogg to make the ascent of the volcano of Mak(ishin, and furnished them with barometers to determine tlie elevation. Two officers and two men from the ship formed part of the expedition, and several Ale11tfa11s accompanied them to })ack their provisions and tent. The summit of the volcano was readied in three days, and the pa1·ty hatl a short glimpse of the great crater, whence are constantly emitted va,st volumes of sulphurous vapor, steam, &c. The mountain is covered with eternal snow, and from its side towards Captain's Harhor, (Lhe westem half of Unalaska Bay,) a small glacier works down the valley to a point about. 2, 100 feet above the ocean; the snow Jm~e1 is ahont 3, 100 feet a hove the ocean, and the line of vegetation ceases at 2,450 feet. The elevation of the peak wa8 made J,691 feet by one of the barometers-two having readied the limit of their range a thousand feet lower. At daylight of the morning of their ascent, Mr. Mosman fortunately obtained some mea;;nres of the zenith distance of the peak with the vertical circle; but they remained uncornputed until the distance from his station is known. I a11peud the observatio!lS made upon the trip. At this harbor the proposed trip to the isla.nd of St. Paul, about two hundred an<l forty miles to the northward in the Behring Sea, was abandoned hy Oa.ptain Howard, and also that to Cook's Inlet, on account of the lateness of the season, the short supply of coal, and the autfoipated bad weather. Therefore our destination was Sitka dire<Jt, that the vessel might take part in the ceremonies att~mding the transfer of the territory, and the raising of the American 1hig by the commissioner. We started from Ulakhta on the 13th of September, with a fine day and a beautiful view of the volcano of 1\fakushin, from the crater of which were rolling volumes of cloud-like-.v3P9r.. The Yessel passed through the narrow stnLit between Unalaska and U nalga Islands; the heavy swell of the .Behring Sea was lost, and the Pacific entered without perceptible motion. From the Pacific approach to this entrance, the view was magnificent; far to the s0t1thwestward stretched the mountains of Unalaska.; both passages and boundaries were sliarp and distinct. The volcanic peak of Aklltan, 3,532 feet high, was alone enveloped in cloud, while far to the north an<l northwc8t were visible the snow-clad volcanic peaks of Devastation, 5,5:35 feet elevation; Shishaldin, 8,953 feet, and between these were smaller peaks and a snow-covered range; beyond Sl1isbaldin another curiously-shaped snow-clad peak was yisible. Grewingk calls it tile volcano Khaginak. The first two mountains were distant from sixty-five to ninety-five miles. Ca1)tain Archimandrit<:iff, who had served thii·ty years in the employment of the Russian-American Company, informed me that he had never seen the sea so calm, nor such au extensive line of islaucl shores visible at any one time. A view of the straits was taken by Mr. Hamel, and to insure accuracy of detail I measured all the horizontal and vertical imgles. When in latitude 53° 38', longitude 1650 24', we sounded in one hundred and four fathoms over a bottQin of bla.ck sand, the middle of Akoutan Straits bearing north 430 west, distant thirty-three miles. The vessel after some heavy wea.ther from east, round by-the south to west, reached Sitka Sound. on the ~vening ()f the 20th of September, passing through the western channel, in very thick

weather, late at night i being guirled in part by the light upon the governor's house, which was lighted in answer to our signal gun. On the 21st the obserrntory was again set np a.t Sitka, and during our stay, until October 13, when we started for Chilkaht River, Mr. Mosman obtained seventy transits of stars for time upon nine nights; one hundred and sixty-eight observations with the Yertical circle on the sun for Ja.titnde and time; and two hundred and seventy-six observations with the vel'tic·a1 circle upon eighteen stars for latitude. Observations for azimutl1, to determine the magnetic declination, were also made. In this work he was assisfod by Mr. Forney, as recorder. For local triangulation, Mr. Farquhar set up two or three sig·nals towards the west channel, and occupied two stations. I measured the base twice. September 23 was arranged for the geologist and botanist of my party to make a boat excursion to the south end of Partovshiskof Island in search of some magnetic iron ore, the localit.r reported to have affected the compass so much as to reverse the direction of the ne~dle; but the programme was changed by the steamer carrying the whole party and agreeing to return next night. At night the vessel anchored in Kotleana Bay; the next day she went int.o Little Noquashinski Ba.y, and getting aground, Messrs. Mosman aml }'orney sounded through the channel to the northwest entrance, while the vessel returned and passed ]nto Olga Strait, anchoring there with rainy, tl1ick weather. But even witl1 this disagreeable weather, Mr. Blake went to the reported locality of iron ore and returned unsuccessfol. On the 25th we had the first clear day for a week, and the vessel anchored in Little Noquashinski Bay in sixteen fathoms over soft muddy bottom, abreast of a low, flat space on the south side of the bay, one mile from the northwestern entrance. This low ground was bol'dercd on both sides by small streams1 and was cm·ered with a heavy carpet of water-soaked spliagnum, forming almost a bog. The trees which bad been growing on this space many years before hacl evidently been torn away by their roots, and the holes are now fi1lccl with water. The exte.nt of this comparatively cleared ground is about twenty-five acres, and its greatest elevation above water about twenty feet; in front the shore is low and flat; behind it is a narrow valley with great mountains at the head. I have described this small valley because it has been proposed to the military governor of Alaska as a suitable location for a military post. Around this part of Noquasbinski Bay, on either side and abreast the entrance, the borders are comparatively low and densely wooded. From this place I was very anxious to return at once to Sitka for transit observations, to obtain the traveling rates of the chronometers for the last month, but, not having power to do so, Messrs. Mosman and Forney, after making twenty-four observations upon the sun with the vertical circle for time, made an examination of the N ewski passage leading to Salisbury S ound and Peril Strait. I went up the arm of the bay making in from the north, and found the depth of water across the inlet sixteen fathoms, with soft black mud bottom. Mr. Blake again made search for the iron ore, and incidentally made some soundings in the bay at the south end of Soukoi Strait, of which he furnished a sketch. · After heavy rains during the afternoon and night of the 25th, the weather cleared a little on the 26th, and the ve&'lel went to St. John's Bay, about eight miles distant to the northward. Mr. Blake made an examination of the small stream coming in here, and reported to rue that his experiments upon specimens found there indicated the existence of good coal. An expedition was agreed 11pon :for the next day, when the vesS('l went towards the entrance of Salisbury Sound, and lll)(lII mturning left Messrs. Blake and Harford with an armed boat's crew in Newski Strait to return to tl1e bay, make further examination and report to me at Sitka, where we arrived a. rn., September 29. Messrs. Blake and Harford made one day's examination in a very heavy rain and storm of wind, and reportt1d to me on the afternoon of the 29th with specimens of coal. I refer you w his report on this subject. The 30th of September was the first fine day we bad seen, and I was anxious to make a personal examination of the position of the Zenobia Rock, at the entrance to the west channel to the harbor of Sitka, but could not pro(}Ure a boat for this duty. Transit observations for time were obtained by ~Ir. Mosman. On the Sth of October the vessel carried General Da.na to the Red.oubtski in Oserski Bay, at the outlet of Gloubokoo Lake; the weather was too thick a.ud ,~iny for astronomical -0bservations, but on the trip I made observations upoi1 tbesnmnrlt:-Of :Mt.

diameter of the rim of the crater. The next day the vessel started for Sitka., and I left Messrs. Hamel and Blake, with one sailor granted from the YeRRel, to make a sketch of this entrance and to examine the geology of the bold gorge in which the lake JieR and at whose head is an immense glacier. On the 12th I obtained from the governor a pilot to accompany a boat from the vessel to bring back this party, who reported to me next day. On the eYening of October 9 we obtained our first letters from the Atlantic since June 21. On the 13th the vessel started for the month of the Chilkaht l{iver, in latitude 5()0 14', at the head of Chatham Strait8. That night we anchored at the south entrance to Olga Strait, but the weather was cloudy and we got no observations. The next night we anchored under Point Skalitch, at the eastern entrance t-0 Peril Straits; again the weather waR cloudy aml no chance for observing. On the 15th we anchored in Barlowe Cow, at the head of Admiralty 1R1aud, in very heavy squally weather. As we were rounding the northwest point of the cove we saw an immense glacier through the thick weather, and got a bearing upon it north 15° east by compass. The geology of the cove was partially examined in very squally weather. Ou the rnth we anchored at the mouth of tl1e Chi1kaht '>vith very squally and rainy weather, aml no chance for observing. Soundings made in Chatham Strait, about latitude 58° 32', with one hu:ndred and fifty fathoms of line, gave no bottom. On the 17th Mr. Blake made a short visit to the glacier on the west side of the strait, in latitude 590 07' approximate, and during· the day and e\·ening _Mr. .Mo8man made one hundred and twenty-six observations upon five stars aml the sun with the vertical circle for time and latitude. The station is upon a small island without trees, about two miles from the month of the Tiver, and named Stony Island. His results place it seven miles thrtlier north, and three minutes of arc east of Tebenkoffs position, and se,·eu miles north and eleven minutes east of Liudenberg's. We reached Sitka ou the 19th, and l\fr. Mosman got good transitobservatious, after which the weatlier was very ba<l for many days. Fonr stations were occupied by Mr. Farquhar in extending the local triangnlation of Sitk~i, harbor. Mr. Mosman made his la8t observation8 at Sitka on the 26th, obtaining on this last Yisit twenty-five transits of stars on five nights. From the tidal obE'lervations I computed the mean rise and faU of tides at Sitka for two months; and Mr. Forney the times of the n1-0on's transits. Mr. ~fosman was engaged in reducing field-work for the diffe,rence of lohgitude between Sitka and Kadiak, Unalaska, and Chilkaht. On the 27th of October the Yessel started for Victoria by the inland route, and was at anchor in Little Naquoshinski Inlet when the heavy southeast gale of the 28th swept <>Yer Sitka, tlriYing three or four vessels ashore, and nearly foundering the United Sta.tes stea.mer Ossipee at sea. Captain Dall, of the steamship John L. Stephens, has informed me that during the gale he steamed through the throat connecting the two harbors, to the eastern one, and anchored there in nine and a half fathoms, t1·ailing well to the northern shore abreast the hospital, and lwld on by a single anchor of two thousand pounds throughout the blow. His vessel stands very high above water, having been built for the trade between Panama and San Francisco; therefore the gale l1ad a large amount of" surface to act upon; When her anchor was got, after great labor, it brought up a large quantity of very te.nacious mud. He pronounces the bottom capital ltolding ground; whe1·eas the Russian navigators of the company have held that it is not good, being gravel, with a coating of mud, and that a vessel lies uneasily; but the Stephens discharged the remainder of her army freight from "this anchorage. The Russians acknowledged that the gale was the lteitviest that had visit.ed Sitka for many years. As the eastern anchora.ge is larger than the western, and free of snn.k.en :rooks, the ¢option of it as the better anchorage for large vessels may be confidently recommended. On the 29th of October the vessel again anchored at Skalitch, the southeast point of the entrance to Peril Straitfrom Chatham Strait; weather thick and no observation. On the 30tll anchored at Kaik Harbt>r; weather unfavorable, rain and clomls. October 31 ancl10red in Wrangel passage; weather cloudy aud thick. On the 1st of November anchored off the north end of ""'range! Island near the mouth of the Stakeen River, and remained here two nights, but got no observations on account of rainy weather. November 3 we anchored ina small basin at the north en~ t<> l'angas Narrows, but the night was thick and cloudy, with rain. November 4 we were at Fort Simpson, with rain and thick weather. November 5, we anchored near Lawson Ba~· lluring

On the 12th a good series of transits was observed, and the observatory and instruments were taken down. I have received Assistant J. S. Lawson's report of the work on the triangulation connecting the work of Washington Sound and Admiralty Inlet with the present astronomical station at Victoria, and thus llringing forward the latitude and longitude of my old astronomical station at Point Hudson "the best _geographically determined position on the northwest coast," north of B_an Francisco. In tbe plan I pro1)0sed for this work I urged upon Mr. Lawson the necessity and expediency of adopting the light-houses as triangulation stations, and occup;\·ing eccentric points. ln liis table of L .M Z's, embracing se\·enteen stations, nine or ten of them bad been previously occupied by me between 1853 and 1857, but some of them have been necessarily reoccupied. His computation placeA my astronomical station, on Laurel Point, at Victoria, in latitude 480 25' 3011 .6i and longitude 1230 22' 05'' .92, or 8lt 13m 28·.39. ·The vessel aITived in San Francisco on the night of the 18th of November, and several nights were lost ou account of rain; hut J\Ir.

The following results of J\fr. )fosman's field computations are given as appro:ximate, but suf· ficiently close for most praetieal purposes.

Mr. Mosman is under instructions to reduce all his worK: this winter, unless you otherwise direct. The report of W. G. "\V. Harford, conchologist of my party, is annexed, and I cannot refrain from commending him as an earnest, conscientious worker, ever ready aud willing to.execute any duty assigned to him. Dr. Kellogg, botanist, has made a preliminary and popular report of the woods, &c., of the regions visitecl, and will send his :final report by the next steamer. He has been indefatigable in tlie. execution of his duties, which be has pursued with enthusiasm. Theo. A. Blake, geologist and mining engineer, is preparing his report, and "'IJ"ill forward it by next steamer. He was always ready and anxious to undertake any boat expedition whenever the interests of the sur\'ey could be advanced in his department. His opportunities for work as a geologist were particularly bad, on account of t11e almost impassable nature of the country, its covex·ing of sphagnum, and the short time we could spare at any station. For Mr. Mosman, I can speak in the highest terms of his efficiency and proficiency in the different branches of the work of such an expedition. The discussion of bis observations will show

his ability as an obsen·er, and cannot but indicate his aptness and ingenuity in O\'ercoming details of execution under adversQ circumstances. His watdifulness in such an unfavorable climate fi-equently saved many days by quickly seizing opportunities that an ordinary obser,·er would let slip. Withont his assistance the geographical results of the expedition would ha\e ueeu meager, or ta,xed my strength to the uttermost; and I cannot do less than earnestly recommend him for promotion at the close of the expedition. Mr. Forney has diligently performed all the duties assignell him, and has exhibited a constant desire to thoroughly understand the different operations of the snn·ey. Mr. Hamel, who had been in the party of Assistant A. F. Hodgers, wa8 of great sen·ice to me in his acquaintance with the Hussian language, both in translating and int("rpreting. All the views made on the trip were executed by him; the computation of the local triangulations and the plotting of most of the work. All that he undertakes is done faithfully and cheerfully. Mr. Fa.rquhar was engaged in reducing Tebenkoff's charts, and in reducing manuscript maps obtained from the governor and navigators of the Russian-American Compan;v. He kept the reg. ular meteorological record of the expedition. My assistimts generally have always endeavored to lighten my labors and given a hearty sup· port to all my undertakings, and I thank them sincerely for the sympathy they ever displayed.
THE COAST OF .ALASKA-GENERAL DESCRIPTIO-:<I.

The Pacific coast of Alaska commences at the southward, in latitude 54° 40', forming the north shores of Dixon Sound, and sweeps in a long, regular curve to the northward and westward for five hundred and fifty miles, to the vicinity of' the entranr,e of Prince W'illiam Sound, and thence seven hundred and twenty-five miles southward and westward ~o the extremity of Alaska Peninsula, where the line of islands generally known as the Aleufom strefohes towards the coast of Kamtschatka in a long curve, with the convexity to the south. The highest point of the great bend of the main coas~ line north of Sitka is in latitude 60~0 and longitude 145~0 at Controller's Bay; and the western and southern point of Alaska Peuinsula is in latitude m;o and longitude 163°, where it is separated by the dangerous strait of Isanotsky from the extensive but nearly snow-clad island of Unimak, marked with great volcanic peaks covered with eternal snow. From Isanotsky Strait the Aleutians sweep in a very regular curve t-0 the sontl1wa1'd and westward for seven hundred and fifty miles, reaching the latitude of 51!0 in longitude 1soo, and thence northward and westward three hundred and twenty-five miles towards Behring's Island, in 550 of latitmle and 1950 of longit~de; but Altl1, the western of the Aleutians, and Copper faland, just east of Behring Island, a,re separated by a strait two hundred miles "\\'ide, through the middle of which the boundary line of the treaty passes. The Aleutian Islands a:re tlie summits of the mountain range which sweeps along foe American coast from the southward, thence round the head of Prince William Soull(l and Cook's Inlet, and down the Alaska Peninsula. The peninsula and island8 are marked by many volcanoes in activity, aml reaehing·elevations as great as 12,000 f{>,et on the west shores of Cook's Inlet, 8,953 feet on Unimak, 5 1691 on Unalaska, 4,852 on Atkha, 6,975 on Tanaga, 3,700 on Kyska, and 3 10&1 on Altu. N()J't,h of the peninsula of Alaska the coast has a general direction northward to latitude 660 in the Arctic Sea, indented by four large bays or sounds, respectively named Bristol, Kouskovin, Norton, and Kotzebue; and receiving among others the great river Kwichpak, having its sources about the one hundred and thirtieth degree of west longitude in British America. The extensive sheet of water north of the Aleutians to Behring's Strait in latitude 65g 0 , and between the American and Asiatic continents, is known as the Behring Sea, and, so far as sounded, consim of a very est.e.nsive snbm.arine plateau of remarkable evenness of surface at a very small depth. It is· ~ked by several large islands, upon two of which, St. Paul ~nd St. George, are located Russiml iltetories. .. Off the southeastern shore of the Alask:fi, Peninsula lies the large island of Kadiak, which has numerous a<ijacent islands separated by ~w and navigable straits. North of Kadiak, and forming pa.rt of the eastern shore of the ~ka Peninsula, is Cook's Inlet, one hundred and fiftynine miles Ieng and from 'fifty to twenty mil~s in width, penetrl\ting the territory to latitude 61°, longitude lOOo, and receiving a large river near itB head.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The great extent of water lying in the curve of the coast between Dixon Sound ood the south part of Kadiak has been named, by the Superintendent of the Ooast Survey, the Gulf of Alaska. From Dixon Sound, in 540 40', to the Chilkaht, in 590 14', the main land is guarded by a vast archipelago of ver.r large islands, most of them having high mountains throughout, and all cm·ered with a demm growth of large spruce anrl cedar. The dimensions of this assemblage of islands averages almnt seventy-five miles east aucl west, and two hundred and sixt~·-five uortl1uorthwest and south-southeast, divided by numerous navigable passages, one of which, nam~d by Vancouver Chatham Strait, stretches in a straight line one hundred and ninety-fiye miles n-early north-northwest from Cape Ommaney, in latitude 560 10', to the month of the Chilkaht, in latitmfo 590 14', with an average width of seven or eight miles, and great depth of water. Tbis great strait has numerous anchorages and small ba~Ts, and several large passages connecting it with the other straits to the eastward, and two important ones with the sea to north of Sitka. Of the latter, one passes through Peril Strait aml Salisbury Sonml to the Gulf of Alaska, about twenty miles north of Sitka Sound, with a navigable branch to Sitka, and the second through Cross Sound, or Icy Strait, to Alaska Gulf; about seventy-five miles north of Sitka Sound. The north shore of Cross Sound is the southern part of the peninsula of the main land lying between Chatham Strait and the Gulf of Alaska, and the termination of the great range of coast mountains that embraces ~founts St. Elias, Fain..-eatlmr, anil Crillon. To the above extensive archipelago, embracing a !'ihore line of nearly eight thousand statute miles, I would suggm;t the name of "Alexander Archip1dago," in honor of the Emperor of Russia. :From Icy Strait the coast is very slightly indented by bays up to the extreme northern part of the Gulf of Alaska, in longitude 1420. Here the extensive area of water, islands, and peninsulas, kuow11 as 1~rince 1VIlliam Sound, stretches inland to the base of t,he great mountains for sixty miles, with a width of nearly the same distance. One hundred miles westward of that sound is Cook's Inlet, and the peninsula lying between them is denominated the Kenai Peninsula.
GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE COAST.

The sea-coast of the Alexander Archipe.!ago is formed of very irregular outline on account of the numerous bays, straits, and islandR. The south coast, facing upon Dixon Sound, arnl extendinp; eighty miles from the mouth of Portland Canal to Cape Kygane, exhibits headland, shore, and mountains covered with Sitka spruce and yellow cedar to their summits. The mountains attain an elevation of two or three thousand feet, with no valleys for cultivation between them. The same description applies to the coast from Kygane to foy Strait. It is remarkable that outside the seacoast line of this archipelago but two islauds am laid clown, both being small, and ten to fiftsen miles oft' the iisland of Prince of Wales. Tlte same abi;ence of coast islands westward of Icy Strait is remarked as far as the eastern mouth of Copper Rh·er, in longitmle 1,!JP, being a distance of five hundretl miles of coast from Kygane. ':Vestward of Icy Strait the coast mountain range attains au elevation of about eight or nhrn thousand feet, covered in most imrt with i1erpetual snow ; with some magnificent snow peake; reaching tJie great height of nearly fifteen thousand feet, and frequently seen at a distance of over one hundred and fifty miles at sea. The immediate sea-coast west of Ltuya Bay, thirty-two miles northwestward from Icy Strait to Prince William Sound, is colnparatively low, wooded ground, but close backed by icy-fooe,d steeps that come down from the high mountain range, and, as at the head of Behring's Bay and Icy Bay, frequently reaching th~ coast line. A great part of the immediate shores of Pri:qce William Sound is low, as are most of the pro· jecting arms and 89IDe of the islands on the western side. The extreme northwestern arm ,of this sound stretches through what is laid down on the map as low ground, w within ten miles of the head of Turn-again Arm of Cook's Inlet. The western shores of Kenai Peninsula are low and well wQOded, but rise to bold mountains a few miles back. Although the elevation of this spur or peninsula is less than that of the Mount St. Elias range, yet it is sufficiently great to devefop numerous glaciers, wbieh work down to the

waters of the sound and to the heads of the bay8 011 the l'loutheast coast. A Yery large one exi,.;ts on the lake at the head of tl1erfrer, debouclting into Gook's Inlet about latitude GOO 20'. The peninsula of Alaska appears to be formed b~- a continuation of the Jlount St. Elias ran1te, broken or detlected at Prince \Villiarn Sound, and embraces some Yer:; hiA'h aml Yolcanic J>eaki-. The southeast. shores of the peninsula are gent>rnlly bold and ro('ky. aud a8 far westwartl as abreast of the island of Kadiak there is timber on tlu~ ]my 111argi11 of tile coast, hut gradually becoming scarcer to the west of Kadiak, when it ceai'.ie" altogetlier. \Vith the narrnwi11g of the penimmla man,y bays indent its shores on both sides, and 11m1ierou,,; lake::;, 0onucckd h,v small ::;treams, exist amoug the mountains. '.rhe northwest coast is Iow aud sandy, and baekPd by a 11a1Tow, low belt of land coYered witl1 herbage. For Urn last sixty miles to tlw westward the pe11iuf;uJa is e01nparatively low, and nearly dh-ide<l into islands hy deep bayR iudeuting its shon~s. The chain of mountainous iKlands thence westward to the coast of Kamt!lchatka comm1~nces with the high aud exten,,iYe one called Uniruak, having near its eastern extremity tlw great Yolcanic peak of Shishal<.lin, said to have an elevation of nearly nine thonsaml foet. Further WPHtward the islands dimiuish in extnnt and frequenc;\-, ;vet amoug them an· m:rny high voleanic peaks. Tl1e climate also ehangeK, judging from the appt~arnnce of the suow upou tlw high rnugt' of U uiruak in Septeml>er, when t11ere was 110 snow on the mountains of linalaska~ except ou the peak of l\Iakushin, with its five thous<wd sc,·en hundred feet. of ele,-ation aml small g:btcier. Thi:s motlifi. cation of climate should naturally be expected when the wanner \1-aters and winds of the l'ncific can pass fully through the numerous straits. \Vest of Uual:tska we should expect a. colder climate from the influence of the Behring Sea current flowing south, unles::; more than eouuterbalancet1 h;\the warmer soutll winds from tile Pacific. Abreast of the southern coast of the peninsula of AlaskaJ for oue ltuu<lred miles from its extremity, lie numerous large and high islands, extending as far off sl1ore as sixty miles, aud reaching the latitude of 540 39' in longitude 11'.19°. Some of the Hussian naxigators iuform me that the positions of these islands are poorly determined, as their business rarely called them among them. Broad off the southeast coast of the peninHula, towards Cook's lnll't, aial ::;ep:trat1~t1 from t.11e penimmla h;\' the Petries or Ol1dekoff Strait, twenty-five to thi1·ty-fiye miles wide, lil·s ihe large and important i81and of Kadiak, with Spruce, Afognak, and other islands to the northeastward, and the Trinity Islands off its south west extremity. The elevation of the mountaius of Ka<liak riscR probabJ:v on'r three tlwm:mml feet, as some were trigonometrieally measured that were twenty-four hundred feet high quite near tl1e coast of Chiniak Bay. This island and its accessories uia.y be really considered a prolongatiou of the 1wuiusu1a of Kenai parallel with the peninsula of Alaska, and tile Chdekofi:' Strait, a, continuati.ou of Uook's Inlet. The north end of Afognak foland is ou1y forty miles from the soutb cud of Kerwi Peninsula, with a, cluster of high ban·en islands lying between them. That extensive banks exist well out to sea, off the south and southeast coast of Alaska Kadiak, and some of the Aleutians, there can remain little doubt, from the few observations of the o1d navigators and the determinations made upon this expedition. The limit of tlmt off the northeast end of Kadiak, discovered by Portlock, in 178G, has been extended; aud au important fishing bank, situated off the Akutan and Unimak Straits, heretofore unknown, has been sounded upon, and its position approximately determined, iu very thick weather. Souudiug;,; obtaim~d thirty miles off the Shumagin Islands indic>.ate a bank in that vicinity. Other banks, frequented by the codfishing vessels from San Francisco and Victoria, exist in the wcsteru part of tlte Gulf of Ala>!ka and towanl the Slmmagin Islands, lmt their exact position is kept ft secret hy the p:u-ties intfi·· ested, and we visited this region too late in a bad season to fall in with any of the fishing vessels. Part of the :fishers visit the sea of Ochotsk, abounding in cod. Of the waters adjoining the coast very little is known with accuracy. The currents have bePn only incidentally determined; the surface and deep-sea fompe1·atm-es have not, been iuvestignted, and the general results are obtained from the practical experience or opinions of nav:igaton;, in a region where the opportunities for determining a vessel's position are very limited indeed on J:wcouut of the large percentage of thick weather. 26

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

From the mffigators of the Russian-American Company I have obtained much valuable information, aml I desire to espedall.r mention Captains Paul Lemasheffsky .and Illarion Archirnandrito:fi' for their log-hooks, extending oYer fifteen years, and for tracings of manuscript maps. These logt:> an' forwarded to you with the collections of the expeditions. From Captains N ewbaum and Katlin I obtained many interesting facts and descriptions, and some manuscript maps and tracings. In consn1ting the works of the old navigators I find many important descriptions of headlands, bays, &c., Rcatterc1l through their Yoluminous pages, but it. would require more time than 'is at present at my clisposal to collate them. Yet it is a matter that should be undertaken at once, and ever.r authority scrupulously searched that may possibly afford a single fact, because I am convinced that it would take years of labor of a few parties of the Coast Surve.r in such a climate to amass tlJis straggling information. Such a compilation would also indicate the points specially needing examination. Considering the means at their disposal, and the special objects of the Russian-American Company, they Jiaye added very much to our stock of general geographical knowledge, and I am satis:tied that the archiYes of the company would reveal much more. In matters of minute detail their surveys are deficient, but their general l'esults axe good.
CURRENTS OF THE NORTH PACIFIC.

'l'hc North P~Lcific presents a peculiarly striking analogy to the North Atlantic in the existence of a great warm current, which sweeps along the eastern coast of Asia to the northeastward, crosses tlie l'acifie, and washes tlle northwest coast of America, aifects the climate of the whole coast, and gives a much liigher temperature along the seaboard than would exist under normal circumstances. The map herewith appended, exhibiting the tracks of the San Francisco and Qbina steamers, shows the general direction of this ocean stream. The .Ja1)auese have long been wdl aware of this great current, which washes the southea.stern shores of their empire, and have gh'en to it the name Kuro-Siwo or Black Stream, from its deep blue color when compared with the neighboring waters of the Pacific. It has been noticed by nearly all the ul<l 1mYigat,ors ancl explorers, and a S,YRtematic series of observations was undertaken by the United.Stat('s expedition to Japan under Commodore Perry. This singular current, with the water at an aYerage maximum temperature of 860-being that of equatorial waters, aml the same as the Gulf Stream of tile Atlantic-affords a solution to the fact of the Bonin Islands, in the hLtitude of 27p, haYing an exclusiyely tropical vegetation, the cause of which was 1011g a myster,y to naturalists_ It also accounts for the productiveness of the southern islands of the .Japan group in sugar and other products, usually confined to intertropical regions. The results of observations, corroborated by the fact of the high temperature above stated, show Yery satisfactoril.Y that the Japan stream has its origin in the great northern equatorial current. This great northern equatorial current, leaving the coast of Lower California and the Gulf of Califomia hetween t11e latitudes of 15° and 25°, sweeps across the whole Paciftc, with its axis two or tl1ree degrees south of the Sandwich Islands, and thence continuing on the parallel of 15°, and coming gradually northward until it passes the position of the Ladrone Islands, in latitude 17° and longitude 2140 west, is gradually deflected to the north and northeast, along the .Asiatic coast, but apparently with decreased velocit;y; although Beechey says that, when between the south end of Formosa and the island of Botel Tobago Sima, lying sh."t . y miles eastward, he experienced a current which carried tlie vL1ssel north 560 west twenty-six miles in the night, or two and a half miles per hour. He does not state the temperature of the water; and several leagues off the Vele Rete Rocks, situated oft' the south end of Formosa, the weather being nearly calm, the vessel was drawn into a very strong current rip, and continued in it seveml. hours, during which no bottom could be found witll one hundred fathoms of line. Experiments with a buoy gave a cWTent to the southeast of seven-eightl1s of a mile per hour, but be doubts the accuracy of the results. The wa.t.er was much agitated and made cousiderable noise, and had a vessel seen it or heard it· in the night she must have taken it for breakers and put about. On Beechey~s voyage from the Sandwich Islands oo the

Ladrones he kept outside the northern limit of the great equatorial st.ream, and ex11erienced a counter current to the eastward of nearly seven miles per day . .A.tone hundred and twenty leagues eastward of Formosa the ;¥Ion soon current of the Caroline Islands runs northward and then northeast, to add its waters to those of the grPat Japan stream. The combined wa.ters of the O:troline a111l Pqnatorial stream:s m·e tl1rown against the island of Formosa, in latitude 220 and longitude 2390 west, almost in the same latitucfo as thP nar1·owest part of the Gulf Stream of the .Atlantic, and moo of longitude -..vest; thence tlefleckd to the northward and northeastward, and in the parallel of 31° strike the southern extremit~- of Ja11an, and pass close along the northeastern coasts of :Ni1)hon. Off the south and east point of ~i11hou, in latitude 350, longitude 2200 west, the stream begins to spread, and by tlie time it reachel'< latitwle 380 and longitude 210°, it has been divided or split info two by the intrusion of the cold polar cmTent. The contact of the cold and warm waters gives rise to the constant fogs that exist in this region. One branch of the stream, callei:l the Kamtschatka current, moves to the northeast ue.arly parallel with the coast of Japan, the Kurile Islands, and the coast of Kamtschatka, its axis JlaRsiug just cast of Copper Island, in latitude 550, longitmle lfno, and running directly for Behriug Strait. Tile other and greater branch follows the parallel of 350 eastward, being detlectetl a uegret· or two toward the south in longitude 180° by the impinging of the cold Behring Sea cmTent, run11i11g soutlnrnrd through the Fox Islands; but in longitude 1700 it regains its latitu<le, and finall~- reache;;. the latitude of 45° to 50°, in about longitude 1430, where it appears to ngain tfrl'ide. The main body of the stream stretches directly towards the coast of .A.meriea, runs down the east coast of Oregon and California, a:ud finally sweeps back int.o the great northern equatorial current. Tlw existence of this current is well demonstrated by the wrecks of ,TapanPse junlrn upon thi> co:u-;t of \\-asllington Territory and Oregon. Many years ago, upon the beach south of Point Adams, at the <>utrauce to the Columbia River, there was cast away a Chinese or Japanese junk, with many ha1u1s an<l a cargo of beeswax. The ship was totally lost, but the crew saved. In support of this Indian tradition pieces of this wax, coated with sand and bleached ne,arly white, are occasionally thrown upon the beach after great storms. Formerly a great deal was found, but now it is rarely met "-itl1. lu 18iil we saw many pieces of it. In 1833 a Japanese juuk was wrecked near Cape Flatt el',\·, of whicl1 act"ounta can be found in Belcher's narrative, and in that of the United States exploring expellitiou. \Vithin the last four years a Japanese junk was found in mid-ocean by the bark Aukland, aml the crew brought to San Francisco. These wrecks are abundant evidence of the force and tlireetion of this great current, in conjunction with the prevailing summer winds. Of the northern branch of this great stream, flowing towards Alaska, I will ,;p('ak lwreafter. The Kamtschatka current after passing through Behring Strait strerehes towanls ilH· eoast of America, as is fully proved by the existence of drift-wood along the American shores and in the waters of the current, while none is found on the Asiatic coast or in the waters :u~jaeent. I have this season conversed with American whaling captains who left the Arctic as late a;;. Odober 12, and their experience of years confirms the above statement. The interesting fact may here be stated that there has rarely been such an open season in the Arctic as that just passed. Captain Williams went as far westward as 1sso, and had then nothing but open sea before him. Captain Thomas went as far north as 720 5i'i 1 · From both I have many facts of importan~e in r<'ganl to the locality of Herald Island, &c. This current passes t,hrough the Behring Strait with a velocity ranging from one and a half to three knots per hour. It is hardly probable that it citn run with much greater velocity, as the whalers can gener·ally work against it with a liead wind. The ice that sometimes moves southward through the stmit is not fairly attributable to a change in the current, but to the fact that the wanner water of the Kamtschatka current strikiug the American coast permits the ice to form on the shores northwest of East Cape, and even to oyerlap the ca,pe. A heavy northwest wind arising will break up this point of ice and force it southward against the current. The great body of wat-er carried into the Arctic Ocean, through the Behring Strait, <loubtless assists in forming the current which runs out of Davis Strait into the North Atlantic, forming the oold polar current that hugs the eastern shore of America as far south as the peninsnla of Florida, a.nd even underrnns that current. . Among the tangible proofs of the origin and existence of the Kamtschatka current are the following: In Septembe~, 1862, a Ja.paue.se vessel was wrecked on the island of Alt.11. She had be,en

drh-en off tlw coast of .Japan two or three months before with a crew of twelve men, of which she had lost nine hefon g·oing a~hore, and had thus l..et·u drifted eighteen hundred miles in this current. "Among the floating bodies which the sea drives upon the shores of Copper Island, the true right c:irn11l10r wood, aud :mother sort of wood very wliitt>, soft, aml ::;wec~t-sL·ented 1 are occasionally
fonutl."

But tlw whole of the waters of the Kamtschatka current <lo not pass through Behring Strait. Striking against the south shore of the large island of St. Lawrenee, part of the waters are deflected to eastwaru, southward, aml finally westward of south, casting their floating wood on the American coast and the north f-lhores of the Aleutian Islands. NaYigators assure me that when passing south of the Aleutians, lwtween 17;)0 and 1850 of' longitmle, they encounter a cold current from the northward, bringing with it ma,sses of se<t-weed, 1lrn1ht,less torn from the 8hores of the island8. In the vicinity of th<· island of St. Lawrence the temperature of this return stream is 47°; north of the Aleutians it is also 47°; near these islands and south of them it is 4!JO, Routheast of them 510. Bt>twct·n tl1e Kamtschatka cnrrent and the Asiatic coast and islands is a cold polar counter current, coming from the Behring Sea. It follows the coast of Kamtschatka., the trend of the Knrile Islands, giYes 1fae to tlw cmTentl; flowing west into the south part of the Ochotsk Sea, and strikes tbe northern and Pastern part of the 0oast of ,Japan. A small amount of the water of this current pa;;sc·s into the ,Japitn Sea through the Tsngar Strait, hnt the greater part ke.t'ps along the past coast inside, and probabl;\' underrunning the great .Japan strpam, tile uortl1wester11 edge of wltich is 8trong1y marked !Jy a sudden depression in tbe tPm1wr;1tnrc of the "'att>r, amounting to lf>O and 300, while the borders of the stream where it chafes are marked by strong cnrrent rips, often rescmhling beiwy brea1rnrs on reefs and Rlwals. This difference of the thermal condition of the waters of thest~ two streams causes the harassing pren1lence of fogs. Seai· the ori;:dn of tl1e great .Japan current the stream is mmally conilnml bet.ween tlm islands of Formosa and l\Iajido-Sima, with a width of one hundred miles, lmt to the n01·thward of the latter it rnpidly mqrnmls ou its southern limits and reaches tlie 1,00 ()1100 and Bonin groups, attaining a width to tlw northward of the latter of five hnn<lred miles. Its southern and e{~stern limit is not diHtinl'tl;\- ddinetl, there being a gradual thermal approximation to that of the air and water. · The velocit,Y of U1P strPam varies much, and we liave no reliable data whatever of its velocity towanlR the coast of Amerh-a, Tl1e United Stat(·S ,Japan expt>.dition determined its velocity l>etwem1 the l'!outh eud of Formosa and the strait8 of Tsngar, a (list.anee of nine hundred miles, at thirty-five to forty miles per day; and upon one occasion, off the Gulf of Yeddo, in latitude 34°, its maximum strength was n~eordl'd as high as eighty miles per day. In the latitude of 350, at seventy leagues from tl1P eon st, its 1lireetion is east-northeast, and its rate forty-eight miles per day; while at twerr ty-fiYe leagnes from thf' coast in the same latitude it is seventy-two miles per day, corrobor.iting the ahove maximum Yelocity. King also assures trn that in these latitudes 11e fonml it running at the mtP of five miles per hour. The rate and direction vary with the season as well as the distance from the com;t. In November it;; course lwcomes more northerly, and in July more easterly. The western body of the Behring Sea current from the north strikes this great stream in about latitude 39° aud lougitnde 20.30 west, and splits it, but being too feeble to overcome it, passed lrnneath it aml is gradually brought to the surface upon reaching shoaler water. \.Ve have thermal ohl'lervations in proof of the existence of a cold sub-stream between Florida aud the Bahamas, aml we also know dearly the existence of "coJcl walls" working, as it were, :1gainst and through the stream of the Atlantic. The whirls and eddies observed in the middle of the great Japan stream, off the coast of .Japan, indicate the existeuce of a similar cold sub-current; and walls of cold water are imlieated hy the obserYations of the United States expedition. Beechey's thermal observation A in the axis of tlw stream in latitude 3;>0 and longitude 134zo west, corroborate these indications, for he fonll(l tlie temperatrn·t1 of t11e w:tter at 8even hundred and sixty fathoms 2so colder than at the surface; aml two <lays later, when on his com·se north-northwest to Petropaulski, in the fork between tht' Kamtscbatka amt' Japan streams, "the temperature at one lrnmlretl and eighty fathoms was as col<l a,c; at five hundrecl fathomR in the above position; a.nd also that it was 200 colder at three hundred and eighty fathoms in this position than it was at seven hundred and sixty fathoms in the above." Thus at three hundred and eighty fathoms he found the temperature 480 colder

than the surface water of the great stream which had already left the coast of ,Japan tweke hundred miles. Of conrKe, und<'r such thermal conditions, Beecltey found himself enveloped in dem;e and continuous fogs and drizzling rains all tlie wa,y to Pctropaulski, with the exception of oue day in latitude 500. \Vldle there is no doubt wliateYer tliat tlu; gTeater Lod~· of water of the great Japan stream flows to the eastward arter tli,·iding off the coast of .Japan, the fact ii; ah\\I t\d1h;11t from the decreased velocity of the Kamtschatka current off the cmu:;t of that peninsula, ·where TeRsa11 found it, in the latitude of Petropaulski, runuing at the rat.e of only seven to ten miles per <la,Y in an east. northeast aml no1iJ1east direction. The observations upon the western limit of tl1c eol<l Bd1ring Sea curre11t also indicate tlie co11tractef1 wi<Hh of this current. On the contrary, the eash'rn and main branch has, in the longitude of 1HJO west, a breadth of ~oo of latiturlt' from :2:20 to .J-:) 0 . On the southern limit the temperature is 78°, or four degree:; al>ove that of tlw gTt·at equatorial cm·rent returning from the California coast; and its northern limit of u4°, or 110 to 13° greater than the yariable currents to the northward. The passages of the China and San Francisco steamers will, in tiuw, afford UR means of .determining many peculiarities of this emTe11t. In the Yicinity of the great nortliern curve of this current, about longitude limo mid latitude 440, all naYigatol'S haYe found drift-wood, seal, sea-otter, laud bird;;, and many indications of land. I have collected many notices of this charact<'r, fllld will submit tl1em to yon in a St'Jl~uat·e report. Between this great bend all(.l the Saud"'ich Islands lies what is called .Fliem'l'US whirl1iool or eddy. ~either the great stream, nor an~y part of it, is laid down as pa8sing aR far nortl1 as latitude 50°, and hence is not sup1)osed to pass into the Gulf of Alaska; but it is reasonable to Rnppose that, while the great body of the stream sweeps round and follows the direction of the we:;;tern coast of America to the Gulf of California, a branch continues direct to\\'at'ds th<~ Alex:tnder a.rchipelago, and striking the southern part of that coast is detlt:>cted to tlw northward and W('stward 1 and follows the trend of the coast round the Gulf of Alaska to the westwanl, aml, finally, to the southwestward. Upon no other supposition can we rea:souah1,y account for tlte lilg·h isotlteruml line that exists directly upon this coast. The current to tlrn northward, westward, an1l snnthwestward, along the coasts of the Gulf of Alaska, is well known to 1uwigators, aml ii; ~t·nernlly conce1lell to have a velocity of ten to twenty miles per day. 01w of the Itussian lrnvigaton: informs me that be has found i~ rtmning at least thirty-six miles per da;1-. Upon om· trip from Sitka to tlw Pamplona Iwcks, on a straight cunrse, we found but little cnrrm1t in onr f~n-or, hnt het\rPeu tlw Sl1umagin Islands and the Saunakh faland and reef it was vei·y Rtrnng io the sontlnnml ,along the coast. If the position of the reef is correctly laid down, we experie11cctl a current of not less tlu~n four or five knots per hour, between eight o'cloek a. m. and haJt:past twelYe p. rn., (Jll the 4th of September. A study of the titles of Alaska will aid in soking the problem of the cxist<'m'P of tbis extreme northern branch; and au exploration of the region of the ocean wlwre the didde takes place nwy develQp causes for the division of tlie great 8tream and the 1leftectiou of each part. There is doubtless an eddy between this Alaska branch when 8wPeping- westward aml tlte main stream running eastward; for Li:siansky, on his voyage from Katliak to Sitka, in ,June, 1805, which he made in six days, to within a few rniks of l\Iount Edge cumbe, with fair winds, had an "easterly current which had pushed him forward, during the last five days, and still flowed in the same directiou." I have been thus extended iu my investigations upon this great Japanese stream and its branches, that its effects upon the climate of Alaska may be properly understood, and also its efti.;,ct upQn the question of the great circle route from San Francisco to Cl1ina. These currents, their effects .\lpon the 'veather, and the pre\·ailing westerly winds, will, in the absence of the stTongest advantages, decide the question against the great circle route from S:rn Fraucisco to Yokohama, or even to Hakodadi. ObsmTatiou has demonstrated the almost e011ti1m· ous state of foggy and thick weather rnsulting from the meeting of the cold wat.t'r,,; of the Ut·hring Sea_(lurreut with the umthern e,tlge of the great .Japan stream 1lowing eastwanl. The experience of the steamship Colorado, of 4,100 tons, on her first yoyage from Yokohama to Sau Francisco, in

attempting to run along the great circle route, was so fearful as to det.er the vessels of the line again attempting the northern passage. The Colorado had to run southward to reach good weather. '.l'he local a]l{l very variable currents about the Aleutians, the thick weather, and tho supposecl existence of islands south of the chain, combine to render an approach to them extremely hazardous; but, with fine weather, uo coast affords bett.er marked outlines and landmarks. A ves1·ml, making the great circle-track to the eastward, would have the great Japan stream in her fayor to about latitude 43°, longitude 204° west, or about 1,440 miles; then the cold Behting Sea current and the end of the Alaska current to latitude 470 and longitude 157° west, or 1,980 miles; finally to San Francisco, about 1,860 miles, passing through the great bend of the Japan stream where so many indications of land have been recorded, and where the weather is almost iuvarjab1y thick and bad in summer, aud cold aud boisterous in winter. On this track the summer winds \YOu]d generally be favorable, and, with good weather, it would be altogether the desirable route: but, with thick, foggy weather for nearly the whole of this distance,' undeLermined velocity and direction of tlw cnrrcnts except in general terms, great variability of climate to passengers and cargo, and extra hazard and risk to life and ship, some great and positive advantage oyer all these must exist to warrant the adoption of it. The westward trip would have hea-vy, adverse winds nearly the whole distanc(~; large sea and adverse currents for two-thirds the distance. In such a case, a few days' extra bad weather would consume the vessel's coal and i·un the supply short just when in the axis of the main stream. The greatest inducement for adopting the great circle, under such circumstances, would be the discovery of de11osits of good coal among the Aleutian Islands, or within a reasonable distanoo of the harbo\' nearest the great circle Toute. The commercial advautages of the steam route to China, through the warmer and more equable latitudes, must always outweigh any merely theoretical and shorter but more hazardous route. .A. study of the currents, winds, and weather, on the lower latitude route, will lead to the conclusion that is being solved practicall~» From the south end of Japan to San .l<'raucisco, a course very little north of a direct line on a l\Ier('ator pr<'.iection carries a vessel across the great Japan stream, in part through the axis of the nmin hranel1 tlowiug eastward, across the northern part of Flienreus whirlpool, and across the California stream, with favorable or light winds the greater part of the distance. In returniug, the course shoulcl be southward of the direct course, taking advantage of the California stream and favorable northwest wimlR, and entering the upper limit of the waters moving westward to the longitude of the Sandwich Ishtnds, to form part of the great northern equatorial current, thence westward, through variable and feeble currents, until the upper limits of the western part of the equatorial current are entered. The other advantages of this route are fine weather and an equable and warm temperature. This line is alread,y competing for the passenger travel between France and England and China, and it is an important consideration with the c.ompany that the passengers will not have to undergo a rapid transition from the heat of the tropics to the penetrating fogs of the North Pacific. Should good coal be developed near Sitka, a depot for the company could be readily establishe·1 on some of the islands near the present route of the ships, and supplied from .Alaska. By taking advantage of the ocean currents and the prevailing northwest winds, much quicker time could be made by the coal-ships than the distance would lead us to suppose. Of the smaller and local currents in the Behring Sea and among the .A.leutes, it is hardly necessary to enter into detail, as mention of them will be made when describing the features of tbe coast.
THE CLIMATE.

The experience and obserYations of a few months upon this coast can do little towards determining the average conditions of the climate ; but, through the kindness of Prince Maksoulo:ff, I have been able to compile much valuable recorded information, and have received many interesting facts from the personal knowledge of the Ilussian navigators. The existence of a branch of the Japan stream, carrying to this coast its waters, with a high thermal condition, imposes, at the outset, the necessity of a high isothermal line along the whole northwest coast of America. The records of the state of the thermometer establish the foot, and the botany of the whole region adds its certain confirmation.

On our passage inside of Vancouver~s faland, from Victoria t-0 Fort Simpson, in 540 3!', the temperature of the surface water, in the latter part of Ju1y and early part of August, was 52°.1; that of the air, 54°.U. Outside the Alexander Archipelago, from Fort Simpson to Sitka, in 570 03', the temperatru·p, of the surface water was 52°.1, air 54°.9. In Sitka harbor, where the cold waters of the mountains affect the waters of the sound, our observations, from August 13 to 22, gave 500.5 for the surface water, and 530,4 for the air. On the Yoyage from Sitka to Kadiak, Augm.;t22 to 26, the surface water was 49°.4, and the ternperatm·e of the air 53°.5-tlle temperature of the water decreasing from 50°.6 to 470,1, but irregularly. In the harbor of St. Paul, from August 26 to 31, the surface water was 45°.8, air 490,5, On the voyage from Kadiak to Unalaska, Augu&t 31 to September 6, the surface water was 45°.9, and yery uniform, the lowest being 450,1; the tem1wrature of the air was 4'8°.9. In Ulakhta harbor, in I;nalaska bay, from September 6 to 1~, tlw surfa~e water was 450,4, and air 510.0-the temperature of the water reaching as low as 420.9. From Unalaska to Sitka, September 13 to 20, the, surface water was 490,4, rising from 46'.:l to 50°. In Sitka harbor, from September 21 to 26, the surface water was 49°.4, and the air 510.u. At the mouth of the Ohilkaht River, at the head of Chatham Strait, in latitude 59° 12', and sixty miles east of Mount Fairweather, October 17 and 18, the temperature of the water was 300 1 and the air 420.2. At Sitka, on the 27th of Octolier, when the mountains were coyered with snow, anti snow and hail had fallen on the water, its temperature was 410, and that of the air 440, In all these cases it is remarked that the temperature of the air was nearly three degrees higher than that of the water. Lisiansky, on his voyage from Kadiak to Sitka, August 16-20, 1804, with fresh westerly winds, found the temperature of the air 590, and barometer 29.5 inches, but he records no observations for the temperature of the water. June 15-22, 1805, on his Yoyage from Sitka to Kadiak, with moderate easterly winds, the temperatlue of the ait· was 5:1o, barometer 29.5 inches; November 11to15, 1804, on the voyage from Sitka to Kadiak, ""ith fresh easterly gales, the temperature of the air was 460, barometer 29.2. The observations of Lisiansky have a, certain value, but the temperature of the water would have added greatly to their importlmce. We see in those regularly recorded by my party, three times a day, that a great body of warm water exists off the coast; for we hardly reach Rixty miles inside the .Alexander Archipelago before the temperature decreases from 460 .5 to 390:. The whole southeast coast of the Alaska Peninsula is bathed by tl1ese same waters which retain a high temperature to Kadiak ; thence westward this temperature dMreases, although the latitude decreases. The report of Dr. Kellogg exhibits a flora that could not exist in this latitude without au unusually high isothermal condition, accompanied with a great condensation of vapor and precipitation of rain. Our collection of shells has not yet been studied sufficiently to afford data on tMs point, but we have the authority of S. P. Woodward's Manual of the Mollusca for saying that among the Aleutian Islands "the influence of tho Asiatic current is shown in the presence of two s1)ecies of Haliotis, while affinity with the fauna of W . .America is strongly indicated by the oecurrence of Patella, (seurra,) three species of Crepidula, two of Fissurella, and species of Bu/Jin, Placmwmia, Cardita, S<Widomm, and Petricola1 which ~re more abundant anl!. range further than their allies in the Atlantic;" p. 373. So far separated from works of reference on this distant expedition, I have not been able to obtain much data concerning the climafo of the interior of Alaska. From gold miners who have been nearly ten years on the Stakeen River, debouching into the Alexander Archipelago, in latitude 56°, I learn that east of the Coast range of mountains the summers are dry and comparatively warm, the winters very severe, with heavy falls of snow that completely stop mining operations. The country is sparsely covered with a growth of small trees. Major Pope, engaged in exploring the inla.n.d route for the Russian-American Telegraph line, reports that in latitude 550 and lon gitudc 126°, two degrees south of Sitka, and one hundred and sixty miles east of Queen Charlotte Sournl, "ground ice" can be found at any time of the year at a depth of from six to eight feet below the ~urface, a.nd m that region the surfaee usually freezes to the depth of two feet in tlie winter, leaving an intervening stratum of unfrozen soil from four to six feet thick. This gronnd ice docs not Prevent the growth of vegetables, a fact confirmed by Seeman in his " Botany of H . .M. S. Herald,

In the general b1llle will be found one month of unusually cold and extraordinary clearness of weatller. In }iiovember, 1853, the mean temperature of the month was only 190.85, but 0.451 inch of ,;now fell upou parts of six days, and the mouth was marked by strong northeast winds. The highest mean for :m,y mouth in twelve years is 580.3 for July, 1860, during which month nine days are recorded upon which rain fell, but no record appears of tltc:» amount. The mean of all the minima taken from the daily observations for nine years of the above peTiml is 38°.<j, and of tile maximum for seven years 48o.9, showing a remarkalJly equable climate, whilst its humidity is demonstrated by the small difforenccs of the wet and dry bulb thermometers.

The greatest amount of rain that fell during any one year, according to the tabulated appendix, was 95.8 inches, or 8 foet, in 1850 ; the smallest was 58.G inches, in 1861. The most that fell in any one month was 19.5, in October, 1853; the smallest was O.i> in eh, in :'.S"oycmber, 1853. But Appendix K shows that a rain-fall of 21.3 inches took place in August, 1867; 10.0 inclJes in September, and about li:i inches in Octouer, or quite 52 inches of rain (]nriug the periud of onr expe<lition to Alaska. Appendix K giyes in detail the daily mPans for the months of )lay, .Jnne, Jul,y, Aug-ust, and Septemuer, 18Gi, indicating, in part, the weather we haYe unfortnuately eneouukrcd, and the amount of clear sky, from means of nineteen hourly obseryations each day. Lutke bas giye11 interesting tables, compiled from two years' obsen·ations in 1828 and 1829 7 wherein we find there were, on an average, each year, 170 days calm, 182 thiys with moderat~ windR, and 63 days with strong winds. Also, an average of 74 fine tla;1·s, 17 4 days on ·which rain or snow had fallen at interyals, and 117 days on which rain or snow had fallen continually. The enormous amount, of rain-fall along· a seaboard essentially c1olldy throughout the year, has its normal effect upon the class of vegetation that will succeed in ripening Uil<ler such conditions of climate. Tlle whole extent of country sub;cct to these rains is covered whh sphagnum from one to two feet in deptb, and e\·en on tbe steepest hillsides this carpet is saturated with water, and renders progress tbrongh it very slmv arnl difficult, especially when there is a he1wy growth of wood and underbrush. At Fort Simpson, the Stakeen, Chilkaht.· Kadiak, Unalaska, and tht· islands ·westward, this morass exists to the summits or snow line of the mountains. ln no part of the country, except on two or three mountain sides on Chatham Strait, between the eastern entrance of Peril Strait and the mouth of the Chilkaht, have we seen herbage or trees destroyed by fire, as is so universally resorted to in \.Yasbington and Oregon, both by the nath-es and b_y t11e settlers. At our different stations we attempted to obtain the temperature of the earth three feet below the surface, but never penetrated a foot before the hole was filled with water. The preYailing winds in wi11te.r are easterly, and if from the southward are accomvanied with rain and snow; when from the nort,heast the weather is generally clear and cold. The stormy weathe1· commences in October; storms and tem1)ests are frequent. in November and December, and from tlie vicinity of Sitka the aurora borealis is seen frequently and yer.y brilliant during clear, cold nights. The winter weather breaks up about the end of l\Jarch, and the Russian-American Com11auy's vessels are ready for their first fur trading early in April! when tile weather is cold but comparatively dry. March, April, May, .Tune, and July, and sometimes .Aur,,rust, are good months, with an average monthly rain-fall not much greater than that on the Atlantic coast. The general opinion of the. old navigators and fur traders, who visifod and sometimes wintered on this coast, was, that after the middle of September it was next to impossible to continue their examinations 01· trading trips, and tlte.Y either sought more southern latitudes or wintered in some well-sheltered harbor. The latter was generally avoided, on account of the losses susbined in their crews by the ravages of scurvy. It is to be noted, however, that these trading vessels for discovery alone rated only from 100 to 320 tons burden. The weather in Cook's Inlet, north of 60° of latitude, is said to be much better in summer than along the coast generally. \Vhen fogs and rain are prevailing along the seaboard and at the enti-ance to the inlet, clear skies and pleasant weather exist twenty miles within the inlet, unless very heavy sontheaster8 be blowing. Dixon reports that from July 19 to August 30, 1786, he observed the mean state of the thermometer to be 5S;t 0 · Unless exceptional, this is warmer than Sitka. Most of the old navigators speak of the pleasant aspect of its shores and its summE.'r climate. The company's naYigators all combine to commend it. Unfortunately we. have not any available records of meteorological observations at the nuss:tln factory of St. Nicholas, on the east si<le of the inlet, at the mouth of t11e river Kakny, in latitude 60032'. Teheukoff says the climate of Cook's Inlet is more expressed than the rest of the colonies. The thermometer in summer frequently rises to 950, (280 Reaumur,) and in winter falls as low as 530 below zero, (-400 Reaumur,) when the inlet freezes as far south as Katchetmakski Bay. In the spring the great tides break up the ice, which very oft-0n lifts rooks of considerable size and scatters them over the bay and its shores. We have no regular record of the temperature at Prince William Sound, one hundred miles ea.st of Cook's Inlet. The following extracts from Meares's intmduction to his narrative must be taken with the knowledge that he wintered here under very unfavorable circumstances, in a small 27

bay, close under the north flank of high mountains that did not allow the rays of the sun to reach him. He had at noon in midwinter but a faint and glimmering light, the meridian sun not being higl1er than fiO-lrn was in latitude 60o 30'-and that obscured from them by hill8 reaching 22° high to the southward; snow covered the earth to a great depth. He ran short of good provisions, and Jost most of his crew by scurvy. On the fast day of October, 1786, the thermometer fell to 320, with the mornings and evenings sharp. In Nov-ember, the thermometer ranged from 260 to 2so, and iee formed from the vessel to the shore. In December, the temperature fell to 200, where it continued most of the month. In January and February, 1787, the temperature continued for the greater part of that time at 150, altlwugh it sometimes foll to 140. In the first half of January were heavy falls of snow. March was col<l as .Tamrnry and February, with much snow; the temperature continued for the most part at 1.:;o to l()o, although it 8ometime8 rose to 170. The first part of April was frosty, accompanied with Yiolent southerly winds. At the eu<l of the month the thermometer iu the 811ll rose to 32° ; at night it fell to 27°. To the mi(ldle of May the thermometer in the shade stood at 400, and at night fell to 3:! 0 , with thin ice, and the main body of ice with which his vessel was surrounded began to loosen from shore. l{efleeting upon tlie l1iglt latitude of this so1tml, its ~waters emhracecl by high mountains on tl1ree sidm.;, f'hilling it with the eternal snows and glaciers of the Mount St. Elias rauge, we may be surprised at the comparatively high temperature of the winter, especially in the location he selected, out of the n'ach of all sun influence for a couple of months. At this high latitude the lowm·;t record lie g·iyes is 14C> Fahrenheit, hut the uniformity is remarkable, and especiaUy as continuing beJow 3:.?0 for six mouths. Tebenkofi' (1848) gh-es a dark picture of the appearance an cl c1imate of P1'ince "\Yillirtm Sound, calling it desolate, gloomy, and deserted; surrounded h;v rocks and pine forests; mountains covered with eternal snow, an<l enn~loped in iwrpetual fog, or invisible witl1 drizzling rain. Rain falls sometimes for a whole month, and there are not more than sixty or ninety sunny days in the year· During the months of July and August the thermometer showed 590 on fair da;ys and 46° on rainy days. The frost in winter is very severe, but of short duration, for the south winds change it suddenly to thaw and rain.
CLIMATE OF KADIAK.

I was unable to obtain any meteorological record at St. Paul, and our knowledge of it i:tJ extremely limited. In general terms we know that it is warmer in summer than at Sitka, and colder u winter: and this is corroborated by the fad that ice obtained at Sitka for the San Praucisco market was found unfit for commerce 011 aceount of being fu11 of air-holes, &c., hy which it rapidly melted, aud recourse was hacl to the ice formed by the colder winters of Kadiak. The yearly supply to San Francisco for the whole interior and seaboard consumption is about three thousand two hundred tons, of which nearly one-half is lost by melting; and it is a curious fact that the deman<l is no greater now than it was fourteen years ago. The following information concerning the ice crop was obtained at San Francisco and St. Paul: The ice lake is about ftve hundred yards from the shom and nearly surrounded by wood, so that the spray from the ocean beach does not reach it. It is partly artificial, having been increased in area and depth by the formation of a dam sixteen feet high, which gives the lake an ext-0nt of two thousand two hundred feet, by seven hundred, and a depth of twenty-two feet. The snq)lus water drives an overshot wheel giving motion to a saw-mill. The ice crop comes to maturity by Decembe,r; th<-: cutting commencing when there is twelve inches thick of clear, solid ice, and ending in February, when it has generally increased to eigl1teen incl1es. The cold is uniform, and the ice has not been known to make more than one and a half inch per night, although the thermometer has been only once recorded as low as 18° below zero during'the last five or six years. During these unusual cold epoohs the air is quitB calm and labor practicable. The average fall of snow is three feet and lasts until June, when it disappears ve1·y quickly, and grass springs forward with remarkable rapidity.

In the latter part of August we found grass growing from the sphagnum and ha dug an an·r· age height of 11ot ks" than two feet, while in many places it was fully three feet. It is usually cut about the first of August, and _eiucs well antl rapidly with a few warm days. Some stackll we examine<l were iu as fill(' condition alJ(las swe('t as any we have seen on the Atlantic slope. \Yesteru men with us coIToborate our botanist in saying that this is really a filH· grazing country, and capable of sustaining a Yer.y 11nge uu111bl·1· of cattle. The condition of Urn cattle we saw ahout St. l'aul au<l 011 Spruce Island, at tlie frecclrneu's settlement, was fine, and the fia.-or of tlie beef we obtained was goocl. Lisiairnky mentions barley having been sown in 180-1, and that it succeeded in mauJ- places; but the dark and rainj- weatlier is uufaxoraule to ngriculture. Cahbage8, carrots, tnrnips, and potatoes are 8uccessfL1l1J- raised, aud tlw natives have many wPll-fe11cec1 gartleus on tlie low grormd abreast of ChagaYka Cffrn. Potatoes were iu bloom when we left, Aug·ust 31. The clearness of the weather depends entirely upon the direction of the winds. Fine weather accompanies winds from the south, round by the west, to uorth; with ea:-;ting in them, fogs and min preYail. During the month of December, tliough the winds hlew from the north, the weather was tolerably mild. The thermometer was not lower than 380 till the twent,\--fouTth, whPu it sunk to 2G 0 · The gronuil wa8 then coYered 'vith snow and remailwd so several month8. The 1\i11t('r, howevf\T, was JJOi. supposed to set iu till tl1e lwgi1111i11g of ,Jannar,L Dnring its continuance, a few days of February excepted, the <Lil' wa" llr·;<-- and dear, with fresh winds from tlle points hetween west and southwest. The seYPrest frost was on the 22d of ,Tanuars, when the thermometer fell to zero. The last days of February aml the oeginning of l\-farcl1 were also so cold that the mercur.r stood between 13° and 14°. During this period I purposely measured the tllickness of ice in the ponds near the settlement, and found it to be eighteen inches. On the 9th of 1\laTc11 eommenced the return of spring. (Lisiaiisky, 1mge 171.) The \\inter we passed hPre was au exceptionally <lQ· one. (Page 190.) The navigators of the Russian-American Company asRure me that tlrn most -,iolcnt wiu<ls are those coming in great gusts from the m<mntains behind the town, sometimes eYen unroofing the houses and dri-,ing the vessels from their moorings. The old archives of the compau.r doubtless con ta.in much vaJuable information about the climate and productions of this place, as St. Paul was origina11y their principal establishment, and only ~-iplded to Sitka 011 accmmt of tlw warlike character nf the Kolo;.;diians, au1l the greah~r ahumlance of sea oHer about the Alexander Archipelago. During our stay at Ka<liak, from August 26 to 31, the mean temperature of the air was 49°.5, and of the water 450.s.
CLDIATE OF THE ALEFTIA=" ISL.ANDS.

Our stay at Unalaska was too limited to enable us to judge of the climate except in the inftueuce it has upon the botany of the islands. There are no trees of any siz10 whrLtever upon any of the Aleutian islands. .A few Sitka spruce bmught to Unalaska Bay, aud planted upon an island in the western roadstead, or Captain's Harbor, some thirt,y ,years :since, are said not to have grown as many inches in that time; but it appears to me quite probable that if trees were placed in good situations at first, and properly attended to, the.y would succeetl. This single and unsuccessful attempt well exemplifies the retarding effect which the single and sole aim of for trading has had upon the development of the colony. Bishop Veniaminoff says that great numbers of de~d willows are found among the mountains of Unalaska. ~ot a stick of timber can be procured nearer than Ka.cliak, aud every bit of drift-wood is eagerly seized upon for fuel, for which t11e inhabitants are dependent upon the heavy growth of sphagnum covering mountain and valley. Grasses grow luxuriantly, and when cut and cured are used to feed the small Siberian breed of cattle through the winter. The barometer observations my assistants made <luring the ascent of tlie active volcano of Makushin, SeJltember 7 to 11, place the line of perpetual snow on that mountain a.t three thousand one hundred and ten feet, while the lowest limit of the small glacier was one thousand feet lower; and vegetation ceased at two thousand four hundred and fifty feet above the sea., except the low form of vegetation known as "red snow."

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

On the 13th of September, when we passed through the Un alga Strait to the Pacific, the whole outline of mountain summits t-0 the east and west was sharply and clearly defineJ against a beautifully clear sky, and snow had not yet appeared upon them; but the published meteorological obsernttions of the Greek Bisliop Veniaminoff, made at Illoolook, between the years 1825 and 18.'H, afford such useful material from which to draw fair conclusions of the climate that I haYe rearranged his abstracts and placed the results in tlle .Appendix I, but present some of the results in this place. The dates are reckoned according to "old style." The mean temperature of the year, from nine years' observations, is 380.03, or 40_9 below that of Sitka.

The mean range rluring the day, from the morning to the afternoon obs@rvation, is only 5°.0. The highest temperature recorded is 770 upon two occasions, and the lowe!'\t 0°.6 below zero; bnt only upon nine occasions is it recorded less than ten degrees above zero. The mean height of the barometer for nine years is 29.74 inches; the highest reading during that period being 30.71 inches, and lowest 28.37 inches. The barometer reaches its highest monthly mean 29.91 inches in .Tnly, when winds from the southeast to southwest prevail; and its lowest 29.60 inches in November, when westnly windR Jlrevail. Tlie fluctuations of the barometer are very great throughout the year, aYeraging 1.78 inch in each montl1; the greatest range being 2 ..'31 in December, and the least 1.07 in July. The clearest months, without clouds, are December, January, and February, when the north and northwest winds prevail. August, September, and October are the months in which the most rain falls, during which time winds from the south to west 1ueYail. The rain-fall is not recorded; bnt he says that rain falls during some part of the twenty-four hours upou one hundred and fifty days of each year, and estimates the total fall at only 27 inches, which must be much underestimated. Snow falls some time in every month except June, July, and August, and is recorde,d in every month except July. Thunder-storms are very rare, only seventeen being recorded in seven years and none in winter. Earthquakes are comparati vel,r frequent, no less than thirty-two being recorded in seven years. The clearest month is January, and at any season clear weather accompanies or follows north winds. Very strong winds prevail from October to March. At Unalaska the aurora borealis is rarely seen, it being recorded but once during the above period of observation, when it appeared like the dawn of day on the 16th of February, 1831, 0. S. On the horizon it was dark, but higher up the sky was lighter. It was my pleasure at Illoolook to make the acquaintance of the Rev. Innocent Shayesnikoff, priest of the Unalaska district, and to receive from him a copy of his meteorological journal from October, 1866, to March, 1867. I have had it translated and arranged in Appendix J. He has a full series of observation~. but his time was too short and too much oocupied to copy more than the above before our departure. As he expressed a desire to add to our stock of knowledge of this region, I furnished him with some official envelopes addressed to you.

At Sitka fruit trees were introduced in tlrn p;o··crnor's garden, m1cl >::pedal attention de·oted to tlieir culture, but tliey JrnvP 11ot hornc frnit, excf'pt a f1~"- small 1'Jie··imem; that Ile\-er matured. Berries aboulHl throughout tl1e country in great almmlancc and of larg·1~ siz\', hut ge1wra1l.Y lack 1laYor, on account of the absence of direct sunlight. ;\lost of the henie" were ripe wl1en we left for Kadiak, August 22, and potatoes were in full bloom. The potatm·R yid11 well, 1mt are of small size and watery. Cranberries grow wild, are quite small and wcll-fia,·on·(l, but not in almrnlanee about Sitka; tliey might lw easily cultivatrnl here, and would form a valuahh~ addition to the California market, which now receives its supplies from the northern coast. None of th(· cereals an~ 1·11ll iYaterl, and it is very doubtful if they would succeed. In fact, except a few very small gardens helongiug to private inclividuals, nothing is cultivated, the population trusting mainly for their fi-1od to the annual Sllpplies brought from San Francisco and St. Petersburg h:y the com1rnl\Y's vessl"ls. There is no Rpace cleared about Sitka for the raising of grass, and there are few hmses mul cattle demand~ ing it; but there appears 110 difficulty in raising as large crops of grass as at Kailiak, if the lantl were cleared of wood and the increase of cattle demanded it. The prcYailing forest tree is the Sitka spruce, growing to great. size alHl covering en·ry foot of ground, and climbing the steepest mountain sicles to the height of two thousand or two thousand fiv<> hundred feet aboye the sea. \.Ye ha Ye measured felled trees of this spruce that were one lnuHlre1l and eighty feet long and four feet thick at the butt, while adjareut standing tree-s measured OYer six ft>et in diameter, and were branchless for m'er fift;r feet, Hemlock, alders, and willow,.; are fountl, lmt lhe most Yalnable wood of the country is the yellow cedar, ·with a fti1e, eYen texture, fragrant smell, good size, and greater st,rength than the spruce. I first callet1 public attention to the Port Orford white cedar, in 1851, and, while admitting its many good qualities, haYe no hesitation in saying that the yellow cedar of Alaska is a much superior wood. It is readily worked, takes a smooth surface, and is remarkably durable. It '\ill make a Yaluable addition to the cabinet woodR of the California market, is superior as a ship timber to any on the coast, and, from our short examination, we arfl satisfied that it may he obtainerl of ample size for frames and kBees of ordinarr-sized Yessels. At Skalitch anchorage one was measured eighteen feet in cfrcnmference, and estimated oyer one hundred and twenty-five feet in height. I have obtained and forwarded to you Jlart of the kl·e1son and frame of one of the Russian-American Company's small vessels, which was com;tructed of this wood oYer thirty-two :years ago, and has been lying a wreck upon the beach for several years. It exhibits not the least sign of decay or teredo attacks; tlie wood around tlw copper and iron bolts is nearly as weU preserved as on the day they were driven, and the bolt.-, are in good J>rPsf'1Tation. The hulls of an the trading and ftshing vessels on this new coast may be constructed of this durable wood upon any of the innumerable bays of the Ale:xander Archipelago. vYhile the vast forests of wood exist upon the waters of Puget Sound, Admiralty Inlet, and the Straits of Fuca, it may be commercially unprofitable to cut and sl1ip even this ;yellow cedar to the California market, unless native la.bor can be obtained at low rates to get it ont; yet, even if unaYailable at the present time, it affords an inexhaustible resource iu future, and wi11 prove of the greatest importa.uc.e as the supplies decrnase to the southward. This timber is found from the southern boundary of Alaska to the furthest point northward we examined in Chatham Strait. The spruce, yellow c<»dar, hemlock, &c., cover the coast as far north as Ltuyn Ba;y, whence westward t<> Prince William Sound Yery little is known, all navigators reporting a Yery forbidding low coast, covered in part with wood, but closely backed by tlle great St. Elias range, with its summits avera.ging from 8,000 to 9 1000 feet, and every gorge filled with snow or glaciers. The Russian Company has no facfury along this stretch of coast, and their explorers report numerous small streams running through it to the ocean. On Prince William Sound, notwithstanding the severity of the winters, vege\ation is reported to spring up with great rapidity, and berries of every variety and in great abundance flourish where the low snores are not densely covered with spruce, alder, and birch. The same remarks apply to Cook's Inlet, with its warmer summer and more vigorous rngetation. Its western shores are covered with timber.

Similar products continue to Alaska Peninsula and tlm nortl1ern Il3TL of the island of Karfo1k, although on thi.s i;,;laml we found the trees smaller and shorter, and growing only in the valleys or low grom1d;.;, and in (lotnparati\'ely small areas along the northern coast lines. 'Ve sa1v none covering the mountain sides. Mention has already been made, of the productions of K:1diak, in the Yicinity of St. Paul. At thi;,; place and upon the lands about the settlements on Spruce Island my ai-;sistaut:-; estimate(l the nnmhe,r of cattle at two huudretl. Tbe Yegetable productions of Gualaska were found similar to those of Sitka and Kadiak;. bnt no trees exist west of the middle of Kadiak and the peninsula abreast of it. Turnips and potatoes are cultinited by a few of the Aleutians, after removing· the covering of sphagnum from the soil; aud were there an:r proper aud cultiYatecl incentiYe to industry anll improyement, no one can doubt tht> capability of the, soil affording fair quantities. Bishop Yeniaminoft' sa~·s that the potato ;yields from four to SPYen fold aml attains "great 8ize/' from t11ree to ten making a, pound weight! Ile is our authority for sa:ying that among the mountains of Ena1ai;;ka are found great numbers of dead willows. 1 fonud growing in 1:--nalaslm Bay, in great q11antities, in certain localitil's, the pea called h:r botanists Pi.~um ma1·itimum, and from it8 luxuriance and size have little doubt but that it could be readily cult.i rntetl. n wai-i found in all the s.tages from flowering to the ripe fruit on the 7th of Se1)tember. Seed was procured for growing ou the Atlantic coast. Captain Br.rant has found thi8 pea gTowing· aH far north as Norton Sound, in latitude 64°. Throughout the whole country the iields are brilliant with mmi.Y-colored ffowcrs, gratif)"ing the e.ve, and satisfying the explorer that the eonntr~· has a moderate climate. ThP mn-ig·ators of the Hussian-Ameri('an Company inform me that the produetjous of all tbe islandR to the west.ward are similar to tl10He of Unalaska. Tebenkoff say8 that the potato is cultivated by the inhabitants in eYery Yillage of the eonntr:y. I lmYe no ayailahle Holuces of information concerning the vegetation northward of the peninsula of Alaska from B1·istol Bay, in 58°, to the month of the KYicl1pak, in ()3°. Further to the northward we haye the eYideuce of Seeman, in his "Botany of the Vo;rnge of her }\fajel\ty's 8llip Hernld, 184;'.5-'51," to slw"· that the coast even in this bigl1 latitude has a vegetation dne to a much lower latitude. He says tlie ('limatP is considerably mihler than that of tlie eastern shores of .America in the same parallel. ThP proofs we rn~Pd 11ot deduct~ from artificial tables; nature herself has written them on the face of the country. The abnmhmce of animal life, the occnrrcnce of many southern plants, and, aboYe all, the limit of the woods, if compared with the opposHe shores, furnish indb;putable eYidence. Ou the eastern side of . A.Jnerica no forests are found aho\·t'. the mouth of the river Egg, aboYe the 60th degree of latitude; on the western they extend al'\ far as latitude 6fi 0 44', or nead:;· seven degre('l'i further towards the pole. ''The summer sets i11 most rapidly, and the lamfacape is quickly overspread with a lively green; flocks of geese and duckH arriYe from the south; the ploYer, the snipe, and many other birds enliven the air with their notes." "The s1m is now al way8 above the horizon, and the ra:rs falling continually upon the Rnrfaec of the earth prcn~nt the temperature from cooling down t-00 much; and thus, notwithstanding the low altitude of the sun, a degree of warmth is produced which, under other circumstances, would not be possible, t11e thermometer rising as high as 6lO Fahrenheit. \Vith the sun shining throughout the twenty-four hours the growth of plants is rapid in the extreme. The snow has hardly disap1)earcd before a mass of herbage has sprung up, and t11e spots which a few days before presented nothing save a white sheet are teeming with an active vegetation, producing leaves, flowers, and fruit in rapid succession." The whole eountr;y, from Norton Sound to Point Barrow, is a va;:;t moorland, whose level is only interrupted by promontories and isolated mountains. The rain and snow· water, prevented by a frozen soil from descencling through it, form numerous 1agoons, or when the formation of the ground opposes this, bogs, the general a1>pect and vegetation of which do not materially differ from those "of northern Europe, being covered with a dense mass of lichens, mosses, and other uliginous forms. Places are covered with plants and sometimes difficult to pass. "Wherever drainage exists, either on the shores of the sea, the banks of the rivers, or the slopes of the, bills, the ground is free from pe<it. Such localities are generally clad with a luxuriant herbage, and produce the rarest as well as the most beautiful plants."

Captain Thomas infrmns we that this season (18Gi) has been remarkably open, and that he reached the latitude of i2° 5!'V.

Moreon·r, at the -worked out-crop iu Coal Harbor it exists in veins of ra1·ely more than a foot in thickness. This coal has been faithfully tried ou tbe Hussian stenmer8, and after very many experiments has been abandoned and rccourt:ic bad to the Kanaimo coals from Vancouver's Islanu. The navigators and engineei·s of the l~us,;ian steamers inform inc that, it is very light, burns with great rapidit~~, and letwes ver;}· much ash all(l clinker. Tht\ same general remark::; a1>ply to the coal obtained from Bnglisl1 Harbor, at tl1e entrance to Cook's Inlet, and first found and reported by Portlock. But I am informed tbat at the northwest point of the entrance to Tchugatchek lla,y, under the Anchor Point of old navigators, there is au unworked vein of coal of seven feet in thickness, aud this or similar -Yeins crop out upon the shore of Cook's Inlet for twenty miles to the northwanl towardi,; Anchor Point. This coal has not been opened, and I forward to you a manuscript map by one of the Russian captains showing its position. I also send a manuscript map of English Harbor. Two imsition11 on Chatham Strait are reported to furnish coal. One has been worked and tried by the Russians and condemned ; the other <lepeuds upon Indian reports. Shoulll petroleum come to be used as a steam-producing fuel on steamships, there is a prosped of a supply beiug obtained from the southeast shore of Alaska Peninsula, at or near Katmay Bay, in latitude 51.P 01', longitmle 1540 54', and abreast of Kadiak Island. I have been furnished with a specimen of the crude oil obtained there two or three years since. The finder reports that he fouud three streams in the above locality covered with petroleum. It also remains to be seen whethe1' the specimens of bituminous coal which were discoyered by the geologist of my party will lead to the discovery of a deposit of this coal sufficient in quantity and quality to make it available.

favorable are all the geological surrounding,,; that I woulrl respectfully urge upon the government the necessity of haying it tliorouglt and exhaustive examination made of this locality. Such expl()rati()n could be aided by an escort of the tro()ps from Sitka, under the guidance of scientific men. I refer you to :l\Ir. Blake';; repMt for the ge()logical imlications which suggest the strong J>rolJability of a large deposit of gooll coal. Spt>cimeus of pure copper ha,,e been gathered from Yarious localities, but the principal source is on the Atria or Copper Hiyer, about twenty-five or thirty miles above its mouth, where disco,very and rnscarch arc retarded on account of the reported hostility of the nati\'es. I have obtained from Mr. Klinkofstrom, Russian consul at San :Francisco, a specimen of this copper, and masses of about a cubic foot are obtained from the river. All the peculiarl,y-ftgnred copper-plates of the natives, twenty-six i11clrns hy fifteen inches, and so much prized as heir-looms by the Iudians as far south as Vancouver's Island, are hammered out of pure copper obtainerl from this river. Copper combined witlt quartz is found in several localities, and Bishor) Venin,minoff says that near l\Iaknshin Bay, between the dista:;t pass and the Tarasoosky Ba,v, there exists a lake high among the mouutains, aud that met:tllie copper is found along the shores of the lake. Silver has been reportetl in several places, hut when m.r assistants sought the localities the guides could not point them out. At St. Paul I found specimens of quartz with sulphate of iron and lead. Upon analysis iu Sa,n Francisco, kindly made for the Uoast Survey free of charge by John Hewston, jr., )L D., it was found to contain only $4 15 per two thousand pounds, and had in it a trace of gold. Gol<l is found on the Stakeen River, and even with very crude means of working the miners report that they can Imtke from $3 to $7 per day, but the climate forbids them working more than six months of the year. Proper methods of working the fine gold placers of this river would yield twice the above amount. Gold is reported on the Kakny Ith-er, which enters Cook's Inlet on its eastern side about latitude 60° 321 , at the Hussian stat]on of St. Kicholas, but I have no authentic information on the subject be,yond the statement by Tebenkoff. \Vhile we were at Sitka experienced miners made two prospecting tours over part of Baranoff Island, but without finding the ' color." The slate and quartz formation around Barlowe Cove, at the head of Admiralty Island, on Chatham Strait, in latitude 58° 24', is almost an exact counterpart of many rich gold localities in California, but the heavy weather that prevailed while we were there a fow hours prevented any other than a cnsual examination of one view of quartz five feet thick cropping out upon the shore. It was much disintegrated and abounded in iron pyrites. In Little Naquoshiuski Inlet, fiftee.11 miles from Sitka, m;y party discovered very fine marble in inexhaustible quantities, and at the mouth of the Ohilkaht specimens of marble of a very coarse grain, and otlrnrs of a remarkably fine crystallization, were discovered, all being white, very pure and unmarked. On the flank of the mountain Verstova, which attains an elevation of 3,381 feet, bismuth of remarkably pure qua1ity is said to be found, my informant being one of tlte Russian-American Company's officers. The weather was so shockingly bad and the season so late that it was impracticable to send a party of exploration, although the time would occupy but one day. Tlte specimen I obtained was said to have come from the Koloshes l"tiver, but, that appeare1l doubtful, as it was not water-worn, and Mr. Blake made two explorations of the river· for two or three miles without discovering any signs. Iron ore is report-0d in the vicinity of Sitka, but after two searches in the localities indicated the examination was abartdoned; ;yet in this case I attribut-0 the failure to our informant's inaptitude for topographical description. The hot springs, lying on. the southwest part of Sitka Sound, about- fifteen miles from Sitka, were not visited, and we know nothing more than from the meagre descriptions of others. They are of very liigh temperature, sulphurous, and reported to effect cures in rheumatic affections.
FUR-DEARING .ANIMALS.

Of the number and value of the different varieties of skins obtained from the Indians by the Russian-American Company it is impossible to form an opinion, as the very existence of their trade depended upon the secrecy with which it was conducted. That the company has been able

THE UNITED STA.TES COAST SURVEY.

to maintain a large establish~nent in persons and material is strong circumstanfotl proof of the value of the trade. The almost absurdly small amount of trading; articles paid to tlie Indians for their most valuable skins is so man·ellom;l,r low that it would astonish those who haxe to pay such enormous prices for the mauufactured fnrs ju our large cities. Tlie company it1>elf must realize oYer a thousand per cent. upon the first cost of the skins, and then it must be considered that the coast Indians are not engaged solely in huntiug, but act as inte:rtraders 1)et'We:en the company's agents and the interior Indians, who ai·e neYer permitted to Yisit the coast. 'I'he Hudson's Bay Oompany has had a purchaAed right to trade in certain localities on this coast, arnl their traders have availed themselves to tbe uttermost to olJtain the greatest. possible sup11lies. From the mouth of the Cbilkaht alone they took this year over twenty-three hundred martens or" Hussian sable:>." It is useless for me to enter into the description of the different kinds of fun; upon the coast or of the habitat and relative abunddbce of the different animals. The gon·ruor of the c01n11a11y had a map in colors exhibitil]g at a glance the localities of ever.r fur animal a11d its frequency. This map was obtained for the govermnent by Captain Howard_ The policy of the com1Jany l1as been to maintain a regular supply, and to this end they place restrictions upon the trade, even designating islands and localities where the animals shall not be taken. When the supply of any animal is running short, or an island is found peculiarly adapted to su11port certain kinds, a stock is placed upon the island and the natiyes fOTbithlen to hunt there. for a series of years. Tile use of fire-arms is prohibited in the pursuit of certain animals, a;; the noise is certain to !lrive them away. The number of sea.-otter skius now annually obtained does not amount to over eleven hundred, where the supply seventy years since, in the Alexander Arcliipelag:o alone, was eight thousand, of whicll it was confeRsed that the American for traders secured o··er six:ty per cent. Between Yakutat Bay and lJixon Sound, 'fehenkoft' says that not a single sea otter is fonnd, attributing their absence not so much to their destruction as t-0 the noi8e of 11re-arms. An important consiUe1'ation in sustaining the yalue of the fur trade, and thereby continuing an industrial pursuit to the natives, will be the rigid governmental direC'tion of the imipPr seasons for killing the different fur-bearing animals, and to a certain extent the manner of taking t11em. Where the practice is t-0 kill by spears an<l arrows, without guns, it will lw wise to continue the <mstom, at least until the inhabitants have become accnstomeu to the ucw order of things, and tlie habits of the traders. \Vhere the practice prevail8 to kill with fire-arms, it appcms politic to per· mit the sale of inferior powder and !'·rms in prescribe<! quantities, otherwise those natives obtain· ing fur-bearing animals and game by these means will be at a loss to keC'p up the supply with hows and arrows, which they have abandoned many years. Every Indian in the A1exandei~ ~.\rchipelago and along the main possesses one or more muskets, and one or two single or <loublc-harrclled pistols; bows and arrows are unknown, except as mere matters of trade as curiosities, and for thm;e purposes obtained from interior or very distant tribes. In a few years the whole fur trade will degenerate int-0 an illicit traffic with whisky smugglers, unless the most rigid and inflexible means are employed to suppress it. The Indians themselves giye aid and oomfort to the smuggler by timely warning of approaching danger by false informa· tion t-0 the officers of t)le law, and by secreting the small vessels of the smuggler when beiugsearched for. The thousand harbors of the coast, the thick weather, and the multitude of channels and straits, many of which are not even ye,t laid down, give the :ulvant.age to tbe 8mugglei·.
TJIE FISHERIES.

·Next to the fur trade, in ifs Aigitimate pursuit, the fisheries of the coast of tlrn new Territ-Ory will prove the most valuable and certain; in fact, I consider them the most important acquisition to our Pacific coast. As the banks of Newf'Oundland have been to the trade of tlie Atlantic, so will the greater banks of Ala.ska be to the Pacific; inexhaustible in supply of fish that are equal if not superior in size and· quality to 'those of the Atlantic ; and the pursuit thereof developing a race of seamen yearly decreasing, as our steam marine, commercial and naval, is increasing. We'havethereite:rated and disinterested statements of all the old navigators and fur traders that -every part of the coast abounds in cod, halibut, salmon, and every variety of fish inhabiting comparatively oold waters, and the experience of the present expedition 'stablisbed t11e truthfulness of their descriptions. 28

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

8alnwn.-At some of the entrances to shallow fresh-water streams the water is packed with salmon, aml the bears come down in - numbers to feed npon them, selecting the heads only. On some of tbe lwachc1;, near these streams, the seine will take them in thousands. In the bays lead. ing to the 8mall streams at their head, on the sonthea8t sifle of Alnska Penimmla, the salmon are crowded so thickly that the progress of a boat is imp('ded, and should a southeast storm arise at such times the fish are driven on the beach in innumerable quantities; one of the Russian n~viga· tors assures me that he has seen the beach strewn two to three feet thick with the stranded salmon. I forward yon a sketch of the outlet of Gloubokoe or Deep Lake, on the south side of Sitka S1mnd, where the Russian-American Company have built darns, traps, foot bridges, l1onse,s, &c., in the most substantial manner. The dams and traps lie across the upper part of the rapids, which have a fall of nine feet over rocks. The traps are large i:ctangular spaces made with stakes placed perpendicularly and near enough to each other to allow a free flow of water, and yet prevent the ~mlmou passing between them. The side of the trap towards the descent has an opening like the entsance to au ordinary rat-trap on a large scale. The :fish rnshe;,; up the rapids and passes througl1 this opening to the staked inclosnre, where it remains swimming against the moderately st,rong current. When several salmon have entered they are lifted out by a kind of wicker basket· and place<l in large boxes lying between the trat1S, of which there are six, with means of adding as many more. The last ~"ear's catch that was packed for market amounted to five hundred and twenty barrels, containing from eighteen to twenty-five salmon each. As high as one thousand salmon have been taken in one day. · The great winter food of the natives is dry and smoked salmon, of which they lay in very large supplies. Cod.-But the most valuable fish on the coast is the cod, and, so far as ascertained, it has already been very profitable to those interested in it, although in one or two instances Josses have occurred by finding the nargo improperly cured. Tl1ose persons interested in it refuse to give detailed information of their outfit, catch, profits, or of the banks where the fish are caught. It is, however, generally uu<lerstood that the principal fishing grounds are about the Sbumagin Islands, while some fish off the island of Kadiak, and a few go as far as the Ochotsk Sea; fishing along the western shores of tlle peuirnmht of Kamtschatka, where the fish average about twelve pounds each. In our voyage to Ka<liak and Urrnlaska, an<l returning to Sitka, we saw none of the numerous fishing :tleet that was out this season ; probably on account of the lateness of the season, but more likely because we passed through the Pctries or Chelekoff Sjrait, between Kadiak and the peniu · snla. The Portlock bank, which we sounded over, off the northeast part of Kadiak, is possibly not a favorable ground for cod on account of the muddiness of the bottom, although certain localities may afford good feeding grounds. In 1866 twenty-three ve_:.;sels, comprising _barks 1 brigs and schooners, started from San Francisco for the various fishing grounds, hut concealed their particular destinations ; their time for leaying San Francisco is as early as ::\farch, arrivjng on the grounds in April; and they should leave about September. Two or three smaU schooner8 sailed from Victoria and made fair catches, so much so that the importation of co<l inro the poril!! of British Columbia has ceased. The amount of fish brought into the San Francisco market in the season of 1866 was estimatecl at from eight hundred to a thousand tons, which would appear a very low estimate, as all the ves· sels reportecl full cargoes. Ko rongnes and sounds were quoted, and were evidently not saved i and only a small quantity of cod-liver oil was saved by one of the vessels from Victoria. The supply from the Alaska banks has stopped the importation of codfish from the eastern ports to San J<'rancisco, and when the curing process is properly understood and carried out, the Pacific coasts of America and Asia will become consumers. The fish liave not been cured on the Aleutian Islands because the territory belonged to Russia, but were kept in salt as long as six months, or until the return of the vessel to San Francisco, evidently to the injury of the .cargo. Many of the persons engaging in the business knew nothing of the manner of catching or of curing the fish, 3ret the prices commamled were from thirteen to seven and a half cents (gold) per pound; and last February the average rate was nine and a half cents. Que vessel carried her full cargo direct to Australia, and received eight cents per pound.

The large amount of fish consumed in California, where the population is largely Catholic, has always created and snst:tined a largl' demand, and the new cargoes are quickly dispost·<l of at rates ranging as high as thirteen cents per pound. The southern c11astx of America are almost wholly Catholic in their iwpulation, and so soon as the fi::ih are well cured, the demand frolll that source will increase. It is doubtful whether we can compete with tile Asiatic fishermen in their own ports. Some of the vessels are said to commence fishing along the Alaska coast 11orth of 540 40', and to work northward along numerous lmnks which they appear to ha Ye fouml. Tlw fish are taken in from fifteen to forty fathoms of water; the best fish in the deepest water. It has been found practically that the Ochotsk sea is too distant from Sau Francisco, and the fleet of 1807 from San Francisco were supposed to be bomul generally to the vicinity of the Shumag"in lslands. They report that wherever the water is sufficieutl,r shoal the cod is ,-er,y abundant. In 1866 the largest takes were off th6 Shurnagin Islands, off which we got soundings this ~-~ar in forty and fift,y fathoms at a distance of thirty-fh-c miles. The soundings of Portlock, of Vancouver, and of this expedition 1n·o,-e the existence of a eom:parativel:y shoal bank, extending along the southeastern coast of AJogTiak and Kadiak, with a deep pocket of ninety fathoms, no bottom, twenty-fi\·e miles east of St. Paul. The shoalest water obtained on this bank by this expedition was forty-five fathoms in latitude 580 16', longitude 1±9° 42', aecordi ng to ]\fr. Mosman's observations. It is fair to assume that this bank extmHls along tlw southeast shore of Kadiak, as incidental and m1conneckd observations indicate. South by east fourteen miles from the eastern end of the easternmost of the Trinity Islands, Vancou Yer found bottom at fifty fathoms. Soundiugs on the English chart 2172 give fifty-11\'e fathoms near!~· midway between the Trinity Isles and lTkamok Island, which lies on the prolongation of the longer axis of Kadiak, fifty miles from the Trinity. }"ifteen miles south of Ukamok Vancouvel' got seve11t,\--five fathoms, sand and shell bottom. Thirty-five miles east from the soutli end of the island of :Kiuniak, the southernmost of the Shumagin Islands, we obtained coral and sand bottom in fortv fathoms of water; the position as determined by Mr. Mosman is in latitude 54° 38', longitude 1B8° <H·'. Ten miles further westward the depth of water was fifty fathoms. In neither of these localities were an;y attempts made to fish. Tebenkoff gives soundings of 45 fathoms fifty miles south 330 west of the soutliernrnost point of the Shumagius, on the line and nearly half way towards the dangerous reef and hilaml of Sannakh. From that position the nea,rest islands to the northward are about, thirty-five miles distant. In latitude 540 20' and longitude 162° 30', about nine miles southeast from the Sannakh reef, we got bottom in thirty-five fathoms, rock and barnades being brought up by the lead. But the exact point of the reef from which we. took our departure was not known, on account of the dense fog prevailing when we unexpectedly made it. The bank whern trial was first made for fish was found oll the fifth of September, during a :prevalence of thick weather. Mr. Mosman fortunately seized an opening and obtained good observations for longitude; with an approximate latitude, the position is in latitude 53° 35' all(l longitude rn40101, and near it soundings were obta:lned in fifty fathoms of water, the lead bringingup sand and a small star-fish. 'Vith thick drizzly weather the vessel driftfld to the nOl'thwest by compass, until sixty-five fathoms were struck with sandy, pebbly bottom. Here the lead-line was b:iited, and while on the bottom the first cod took the hook. The fish proved very plenty, fat, and bit eagerly; frequently two were brought up on a double-hooked line, and sometimes three were brought up on a line with thrne hooks. The largest measured thirty-seven inches in length, and several reached thirty-six inches. The finest was thirty-six inches long, twent,r-three inehes ~rirth, and weighed twenty-seven pounds; was very fat and certainly of as fine if not fiuer flavor tha11 cud I had eaten eleven months before, freshly caught on the south coast of Newfoundland. The vessel drifted to the northwestward all the afternoon over this bank, with the same depth of water and fish biting well, alt.hough all appeared in capital condition and their maws full of food, such as squid, halibut head, fil'!h the size of a herring, sea-lice, &c. We got no obsen-ations that noon or afternoon, nor any all the next day, on account of thick, foggy, drizzling weather, but, the vessel could not have been far from latitude 53° 40' and longitude 1640 30', lying ::iixty-iive miles east-southeast true from the middle of the Akoutan Pass, and fort,y miles south-southeast from the Unima.l Pass. The weather was a.Jt,ogether too unfavorable to make an extended examination of

220

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

.

this localit:r- The fifty-fathom position is forty miles broad oft' the nearest island of the Kriniatzkin grouri, lying between Unimak and Unalaska. Much deeper water, one hundred and four fathoms, oYer a bottom of black sand, was subsequently found in latitude 530 38', longitude 1650 25', fort_y-tl1ree miles ·westward of the above cod bank, and twenty-five miles broad o:ff the islands. In addition to the already acknowledged Ruccess of the cod-fishers from San Francisco and Victoria, and our own experience, I add that of Captain Bryant, formerly a whaler in the North Pacific, and now an influential member of the Massachusetts legislature, quoting from your notes of May 26: "Behring Sea is a mighty reserYoir of cod and halibut, so that he never threw over his lines without bringing up fish in whatever part of the sea he might happen." The soundings of this sea, aud of the Arctic Ocean north of Behring Strait, indicate it as the most remarkable submarine plateau of s11cli great extent yet known. On the eastern half of this sea soundings of fess than fifty fathoms are found oyer an extent of eighteen thousand square miles. "South of Alaska, at a distance of say fifty miles from shore, there are banks running parallel to the coast, admirable for cod-fishing; these banks can usually be recognized by the lighter color of the water." The fishiug smacks carry their bait from San Francisco at a cost of about one hundred dollars in gold for a one-hundred-ton .vessel. We fished with clams, the Sakizotkerus nuttall-ii, obtained at Fort Simpson on our way up; but there are plenty of small fish, herring, clams, &c., suitable for bait, in all the harbors along the coast. The importance of the possession of these islands can liardly be overestimated; not only can onr fishermen enter and fish in every bay when heavy weather compels them t-0 leave the banks, but they g·ive ample opportunities for the successful curing of the fish, certainly as great, if not greater, than I saw on the south shore of Newfoundland. Instead of making the long trip to and from Sau :Francisco, and of keeping the fish so long in salt, especially if imperfectly cleaned, it appears feasible to make a general depot and curing establishment1 as at Kadiak, whence vesse}s could carry the catch of all the smacks, which might readily refit in winter and be ready for the opm1ingof thenext season. I mention Kadiak as affording the nearest available timber for repairs and as already a depot for the ice crop of the Pacific. In conversation with the govei·nor of the Russian colonies upon the value of the cod fisheries, he acknowledged that the Russian government had not been aware of the extent, value and importance of the cod grounds as a new industry in the Pacific. While its commercial value is so great to us, it will prove of great service to the Aleutians, who are patient, skillful, and fearless in their fishing. Under proper guidance they may be very profitably emi>loyed in the taking and curing offish; and in order that our fishermen may know where to find labor among these islands, I procured from the priest of the Unalaska district the population of every village from Attu t-0 Unga. These statistics will be found under the head of population, &c. Herring.-In September, when drawing the seine for salmon at Illoolook Harbor, several her· ring were obtained of large size, fatter and of much finer flavor than the herring caught on the California coast. No information was obtained of the season when they visit the coast. They are found in the vicinity of Sitka, and doubtless visit the whole seaboard. Portlock mentions that, "when hauling the seine, he caught large quantities of herring and some salmon. The herrings, though small, were very good, and two hogsheads of them were salted for sea store." The herring, besides its own intrinsie value, has an important bearing on the question of the cod fisheries in supplying bait, which is now carried from San Francisco for that purpose at large prices. Wlwle.-The waters surrounding the Territory of Alaska have always boon celebrated for their wha1e. fisheries, and the Russian-American Company formerly paid some attention to this branch of industry and profit, and had surveys made in Cook's Inlet for asoortaining the proper anchorages and harbors for their whalers in winter. They even established a ship-building station in Besur· rection Bay, on the eastern shore of the Kenai Peninsula. But as the whaling was not so remunerative as the fur trade, their whole e:ltom were directed to the full legitimate development of that business. Some of the Russian navigators inform me that their best whaling grO\llld, from the middle of June to the middle of July, was in the region named Fairweather Gronnd by the .A.mer· ican whalers, and lying between the Pamplona Beef and the shores off Mount Fa.irwea.ther. The

richness of this locality is confirmed by all the old navigators and fur traders, who found tl1esc waters abounding in whales, especial1y in the region of the Barren Islamls, between the I>euinsula of Kenai and the Island of Kadiak. As early as June 4, (1787,) Dixon, when four or five leagues off Port Mui grave, found many whales pla~ving about his ship. Captain Bryant, in his notes, says that Fairweather Ground is at proper seasons the great receptacle of the mollusk called" whale's food," the clio, a minute animal about the size of a flax seed, aud haYing a gelatinous consistency it covers the ocean like a scum. "-This mollusk drifts along with the coast current towards the west at the rate of about one mile per hour. During this season the sea and all the adjacent bays are filled with the whale. The mollusk collects umler the lee of the submarine range of Pamplona. The whaling season continues from the last of June to the middle of -Tuly." It becomes an interesting question to trace back the path of this mollusk; the indicatiouK of whale in the vicinity of the diYide of the Japan current, about latitude 47° and longitude 147°, arc such as to suggest the probability of the mollusk being brought by the great stream towards the coast. The old navigators notice many whales in that region as early as April. The Clio borealis, a small animal with a -flat head, body, and tail like a tadpole, but ha.Ying in addition a pair of wings, by means of which it progresses, inhabits the .Arctic seas, and when the weather is calm is so abundant that the surface of the ocean is covered by them. They swarm in such myriads as to serve as the great part of the food for whales. About Unalaska we saw numbers of sperm whale in September, and in August the sperm whaler, William Gifford, was entering the north strait of Kadiak to fi.11 up, reporting m;; having left the coast of Queen Charlotte Island, where four other sperm whalers were fishing this season. The Gifford had been out from New Bedford since November, 1863, her time lwingftve ;rears. Slie l1ad sent home 2, 700 gallons of sperm oil, worth $90,000 in gold, arnl had on board four hmulred barrels more, intending to take nothing but sperm whale, until near tho end of her cruise. The command of a1l the bays and straits .of the north west coast resorted to by the whale gives very great advantages to our whalers, that need only be mentioned to be appreciated: fishing at all seasons, opportunities to winter and refit, depots for cargoes, and regularity in tr:msshipping them to the east or to the Pacific ports. A great many whales are found in the straits of the archipelago Alexander, but the very deep water is a drawback to successful fishing. For the last six years the whaling fleet of the Arctic has averaged not less than eighty \"esse1s, of which seventy belonged to the United States. Their average catch in those watBrs amounts to not less than twelve hundred barrels each, and about 20,000 pounds of whalebone, rnckoning the latter at sixteen pounds to the barrel of oil. One reason given to me by the whalers for preferring the Arctic regions over the Gulf of Alaska is the shallower water. In ~e .Arctic Ocean and Behring Sea the depth of water is about thirt~' fathoms, and the whale, in "sounding," after being struck, drives his head into the muddy bottom, and has it covered with mud when he rises. The whaler learns readily where and when he will rise in such a depth; but in the deeper wate1·s of the Gulf of Alaska, the whale does not strike bottom in sounding, and it ill ver,y difficult to estimate where he will rise, and not unfrequently sounds again and again, and thus draws the boats far from the vessel.
WALRUS IVORY.

Coal Harbor, on the north side of the island of Unga, has been the point for receiving the walrus tusks, obtained from the Walrus Islands, on the north side of the Alaska Peninsula. During the wint.er the walrus is said to be driven on great bodies of ice into the larger bay, thirty miles long and ten miles wide, embracing the Walrus Islands. Here the Indians kill them, secure the tusks, and trade them to an em.:ploye of the Russian-American Company stationed at the storehouse in Moller Bay, at the mouth of a small stream in latitude 550 55', and longitude 160° 41'. Thence the stock was carried on the sh01:iJ.ders of the natives, or on dog-sledges, across the peninsula to the head of Portage Bay, twelve miles deep by four miles wide, and lying north-nortl1west and south-southeast by oompass, and directly north of Unga Island. In Portage Bay they are :met by another body of Indians in their bidarkas, or skin canoes, from Coal Harbor, whither the

222

tusks are transported. In some seasons ten tons of these tusks are secured by the Indians, and the_1' are valued at i;event.r cents (gold) per pound at Sitka. Large quantities of the tusks are obtained in trade aud capture by the Arctic whalers, who also try out the oil. The sy:-;tematic hunting of the walrus, prompted by better prices than ha ye been paid by the barely life-sustaining tariff of the Russian-American Company, will develop this valuable branch of industry.

It is not necessary to enter into an elaborate account of the divisions and subdivisions of the Indian races that inhabit the seaboard of Alaska, although I haYe had translated and gathered materials upon that subject; nor is it expected that I will give any account of the manners and customs of the people. The annexed official table of the population of Alaska, excluding Esquimaux, Koloshes, and inland tribes, has been obtained, through the kindness of Prince Maksoutoff, from the archives of the Russian-American Company, at Sitka, and includes the Russian half-breeds, (known throughout this Territory as Creoles,) the Aleutians, which embrace the Aglemootians of Alaska Peninsula, and the natives of Cook's Inlet or Kenai Bay, Priuce William Sound, and Cop1)er River. The inhabitants of Lemusin, Behring, and Copper Islands, are embraced by the table; but in arriving at the numbers now subject to the laws of the United States, they and the Russians are excluded from the final enumeration. The total adult and minor population then stands 4,511 males and 4,505 females. The Koloshes are inhabitants of the Alexander Archipelago, and extend as far west as Yakuta.t Bay, and many of them visit the Copper River every season for the purpose of trade. They are · supposed to number four or five thousand, although Tebenkoff places them at forty thousand, and describes them as a fierce and treacherous race. Bishop Veniaminoff estimates the number of Koloshes, from Yakutat Eay to Dixon Sound, as five thousand eight hundred and fifty. The Esquimaux, north of Norton Sound and round the Arctic shores, are estimated by Beechey to number twenty-five hundred. Through the courtesy of the officers of the company, I am able to further subdivide the sums given in the table among their respective islands and distiicts. On the island of Attu, 115 male and 105 female Aleutians. On the island of .A.tkha, 146 male and 159 female Aleutians. On the island of St. Paul, 147 male and 136 female Aleutians. The population of the islands and villages of the Unalaska and Unga districts was kindly furnished me_ by the priest of Illoolook, and differs slightly from the records at Sitka. It is here given in ru;t{)mo, as indicating to our fishermen and traders where labor can be procured. It is compiled for the year 1867.

Upon the islands of Kadiak and Afognak there are of Russians, 50 males; of Creoles, adult males, 209, children, 240; adult females, 216, children, 196; of Aleutians, adult males, 628, children, 326, adult females, 560, children, 324; making a total of 2,499. The Koloshian colouy, at St. Paul, formed of redeemed slaves of Sitka, is not enumerated; judging from the number of houses, they probably number sixty people. On Alaska Peninsula., opposite Kadiak, there are of Aglemootians, 439 adult males, and 311 children; of adult females, 422, and 261 children; making a total of 1,433. The Indians about the entrance to Cook's Inlet, and round to Copper River, number 223 adult males, and 151 children; 225 adult females, and 113 children. The Indians in the northern part of Cook's Inlet number 324 adult males, and 167 children; 393 adult females, and 203 children. The Aleutians are very distinct, in their looks, manners, language, and customs, from all the other Indians of the northwest, and many of them bear a close resemblance to the less marked of the·Japanese, so much so that the question at once arises whether this people has not bet\n directly derived from cast-away or shipwrecked inhabitants of Japan, carried thither by.the Kamtschatka branch of the great Japanese stream ; some of the names of their islands, the name of their chief, and other peculiarities strongly indicate this origin, but it is not our province to investigate the problem in this place. They are a quiet, patient people, gifted with a gre,at deal of ingenuity, and always trns.ted implicitly by the Russians. The priest of the Unalaska district is an Aleutian, and a man of more than ordinary natural ability and taste. The surgeon of the company sen·ice at Illoolook, now the Coast Survey tidal observer, is also a full-blooded native, who will, I feel satisfied, a~quit

himself creditably in his obser""ations. Many of the block-houses of the Russian Company are constructed hy the Aleutians; and the church at Illoolook is a good specimen of their workmanship; even the capitals of the interior wooden columns were car\'fid hy thPm w:ith rude means. They make skillful mechauics, aml the i11·i11ci1wl rnechanician and instn1ment-repairer at Sitka is an Aleutian, who earl.r displa~-ed talent, and was sent at the company's expense to St. Petersburg, where he learned the business of an optician. His workmanship exhibits talent that needed a large field to develop. This man's°"'ife, a f'ull-l>looded Indian, and their daughter, attended by command the'hall given to the United States officers by the Prince and Princess l\faksoutoff, during our stay at Sitka. The thirty-eight charts of Tebenkoff's atlas were engraved upon copper by an Aleutian. The bida rkas or ;;;kin canoes of the Aleutians, constructed for one, two, or three persons, are fine specimens of ingenuity and form; the light frame is constructed of' wood, where the article is so scarce that it must be brought from Kadiak, or sought for on the beaches. , In the management of these canoes they display cool courage and thorough knowledge of their capabilities. In the early days of the first sea-otter hunters, they made coast voyages of a thousand to fifteen hundred mi.les with them, traveling from Unalaska as far as Sitka Sound. Vancouver found sevenhundreg of these canoes, with fifteen hundred natives of Unalaska and Kadiak, as far eastward as Behring Bay. Barano:ff took six hundred of these canoes and one thousand men to Sitka in 1804. As models they arc not excelled by any of those I have seen on the Pacific coast; and as simple mechanical constructions, they are vastly superior to any southward. Their large skin boats, baidars, capa1J1e of carrying from forty to sixty persons, were used in trading between distant islands as far as St. Paul and St. George, when the Russians first reached the country. They are still in use, and were employed at Ulakhta Harbor to coal the steamer Lincoln. The Aleutians arc very ingenious in their traps for catching the smaller fur- bearing animals, very neat in their Rpears, walrus barbs, and sinew twine, and apt in adopting the simplest means to obtain their ends. I have a specimen of their application of the cam in so trifling-an article m1 a clasp for holding the edge of any fabric wl1ich they are sewing. They soon become very handy ~with the use of ordinary tools, do good blacksmith work, use the lathe, &c.; but unfortunately have hu<l few incentives to continued industry and improvement. The great number of officially recognized holillays during the year-eighty-six besides Sundays-has aver~· bad effect upon their industry, and tends to keep them close acquaintances with poverty. In fact, the waut of' incentfrc for industry is the great drawback to development in general on this coast, and would appear to have been the unexpresse(l but inevitable policy of the Hussian-American Company. In caning 1igures from walrus tusks, or the tusks of the fossil mammoth found on Kotzebue Sound, the Aleufoms display patience, and in many cases considerable ingenuity, constnicting out of walrus tusk small figures of hunters, rocks, seal, and fish, representing the practice of seal hunting, making mimic representation of' their dancing and musical entertainments, &c. In hunting the sea otter and seals they exhibit their tenacity of purpose by watching for days at a time rather than lose the object of their pursuit. They do not use the bow and arrow but the small ivory-headed spea.r, thrown with the aid of a hand-board, and their exhibiti-0ns of skill proved their expertness and proficiency. Most of the crews of the Russian Company's vessels are composed of Aleutians, but they do not make the hardy sailor that the European ·or American does. Another peculiarity we noticed in their favor at Unalaska: whenever a woman was one of two or three persons in a bidarka, she was not compelled to use the paddle, as we have heretofore invariably seen on the Pacific coast. The women make very nice specimens of $eWing, and those of Unalaska have l1een always noted for their skill. No murder has been committed among the Aleutians for the last fifty years, and when one did occm~ the whole race was horror-struck. Of tlie Kolm1hies, of the Alexander .Archipelago, we have seen comparatively little. They have forty large houses outside the stockade at Sitka, averaging thirty feet front by .fifty deep and twenty in height, constructed mostly of boards from two to four feet wide, which they make from the spruce and cedar. Enormous posts and beams form the frame, and they are roofed with boards similar to the sides, but have no chimneys, only an opening in the roof' for the escape of the smoke. Some of them have pretensions to com.fort and cleanliness insid~ having well· scrubbed boards laid for a floor, round the center spa.oo of six or seven feet square, which u,; filled in with pebbles a.nd used as the 1ireplaoo. Their canoes, hollowed from the trunks ·Of trees, display

This error has been continuerl w tlw ]ll'l's<·ut da~·, and upon the slightest opportunity, or for fancied slight, the,v assume immense air,;, swaggPr with cool iusulence mid t.hreate11 war. The pnwtice ol tlw R.ussian-Americau Compan,\- of selling- 1.o t11em <'l'I'· tain quantities of rum has transmitted to our goYernment a legac~- vregnaut with num~· edls. The policy of trading fire·arms, powde1· and ball to them for temporary gain in trade lias assisted in degenerating- the race and effeetually 1lestroyed tlwir natural wealth, the sea-otter. The problem to br> solYed is a peculiar one, and it wonltl be out of placl' in me to make suggestions as to tltlc' best polil'y to he imrsut><l in treating tlwm, especialJy as the present military goy. ernor, ):[;~jor General J.C.

On the 8takeeu RiYer tlwy cans<:'d some annoyance to the early miners, but of late they have not 1uo\·ed troublesome, especially since the death of two prom. inent hostile chiefs. The Iudi::ms from the neighhorhood of Kaik are the sanw that sent a <'auoe load of fighting meu, about tlrn year 18.>6, all the way from the Clarence Strnit to "Ybidbe,\· Island, iu )Vaslriugton Territorr, to behead ex·Uolll·ctor of Customs Ebl':Y, in rl·talia1i011 for the killing of one of thefr cl1 ief me11 when thP United States ste.amer 1\'IassaclmsrHs opent>Jl her ha tteries on the temporar.-r encampment of Stake.en or Kaik Indians, on the sand point opposit!i the saw.mills of Port Gamble, where the men were employed as laborers.

It is lmtjust to the Imlian chief,.; to sa~· that when tht' \'l)SSel returned they covered her deck with fine sea.otter and other skins as a preRent to the captain and tnulPr and a token of peace. One or two other instances of attack upon small traders have been brought to my notice, but enough has beeu stated to show that these Indians must he treated with firmness. The commercial rivalry that bas existed between the traders of the l{nssiall-Americau Company and the Hudson's BayComp:m;r, whieh held a trading lease of part of the Russian sea-bound territory, has tended to keep a.live and engender excited f'lwliugs on the 1rnrt. of the Indians.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CAPES. BAYS, HARBORS, ISLANPS, ETC.

It woald he almm;t impnssilile 1 within reasonable limit8, and certainly be.rond the labor of one persou in the time allowed, to give a detailed description of the great number of known harhors aml anchorage,;, rocks, islands, and points that abound in the Alexander Archipelago. Imle('(l so umuerous are they that mm1.v of them are yet unexplored or known only in general characteristics to tlie trader. I<rom Icy Strait and the mouth of the Chilkaht to the head of Puget Sound, this great labyrinth of waters stands unequalled in tlw world for safe aml bold inland navigation. The s1~herrie8 of Finla11d and the fiords of X onrn.r sink into insignificance before the great dimensions of these straitis and sounds. They are magnificent na,-igable "Yo-semites." The extent of shore line of the archipelago is nearly 8,000 statute miles, and by their exploration and description Vancouver is entitled to indisputable celebrity. A number of harbors have been partiall,y examinell and preliminarily smn'yed by the old miYigators and by the officers of the Itnssian-American Company. .Many of these have been already published iu detached form in books aml maps, and cliarts of fran·l, bnt no attempt was made to arrange them in any sort of order until Tebeukoff undertook to aggregate the labors of VanconYer, La Perouse, Kotzebue, Beechey, and others, with the nnmc1'ous l~ussian explorationR, in an atlas of thirty-eight charts rmblished in 1848. His descriptive memoil' does not till the requirements of a directory of the coast, but is more occupietl with the names of tlw officers ~who made certain explorations. ~Iany of these tentative examinations were made in tbeir searche8 for nPw fields of traffic, for winter harbors for the whalers of the company, and also to iustrud the mates in such duties, and to familiarize them with the dificrcut parts of the coast. By very numerous voyages and systematic reports, combined with comparatiYely recent English and French explorations, theJ· lutYe improYed the general geographical positions of prominent points and harliurs along· the whole coast and on the line of the Aleutians, although a vast amount of general, and especially of detailed labor, is yet t-0 be accomplished. In fact there is not even a small map of any part of the coast, or of any harbor, which can be counted as worth more than a reconnaissance or preliminary survey. The shortness of the working season and its uncertainty, combined with the paramount object of the fur trade, accounts for the lack of geographic<tl knowledge of this coast, and in l'-Onsideration of these drawbacks the company deserves great credit for the amount of geographical work its officers have accom11lished.
DIXON SOUND.

This sheet of water, opening upon the Pacific Ocean, lies between the north side of Queen Charlotte Island and the south capes and shores of the Alexander .Archipelago, between the latitudes of 5P 10' and ;34° 35', and longitudes 131 o and 133~0. From the north part lead several straits and sounds; from the northeastern part, which wl\s originally named Buccleugh Sound by :l\Ieares in 1789, leatls the channel to the Portland Canal, the southern dividing line between British Columbia and Alaska. Dixon Sound opens southward upon extem1ive wat:ers leading southward among the islands. It is comparatively free from dangers, having, however, a few rocks on the north side that are reported to be not well laid down. It is named on some maps Granitza Sound, and on others Kygane Strait. It was discovered and named by Dixon.

(Vol. II, p. 3±0.) The entrance to Portland, according to Vancouver and Russian authorities, is in latitude 540 42 1 , longitude 1000 '..!5' ·
CLARENCE SO"UND.

From the north side of Dixon Sound, in longitude 131~0, Cla.rence Sound opens with a width of fifteen to twenty miles; runs in a general northwest-by-north direction for 011e hundred aud twe,nty miles; thence westward twenty miles; arnl finall.v south-souUrnast. for twenty-fh-e miles, with the large islands called Coronation and \Varren, at its western entrance, where it mingles its waters with those at the entrance to Chatham Strait. The average width of the whole sound is about seven miles, but at some places its available channel is much reduced by islets and rocks. In a measure it surrounds the island called Prince of \Vales, the sontl1ern point of which is tLe initial point of the boundary line between Alaska and British Colnmliia. :N"umerous strait8 are reported to exist through parts of this large island, diYicling it into an extensive gmup, and is hence sometimes called the Prince of 'Vales Archipelago. From the eastern side of Clarence Strait great arms penetrate in a general direction to the northeastward until they reach the lJu8e of the coast mountains; these arms or inlets are known as the Boca-de-Quadra, Behm Cmial, a large one not mimed, Ernest Sound, Sta.keen Sonu<l, 'Vrangel Strait, &c. Their waters are nadgable, the shores generally very bold and covered with timber; and the whole forming an intrieac,v of inland nadgation difficult to describe in detail, and best studied on the chart. 'fhe southwestern aud parts of the ea.stern shores of 'Vales Archipelago have remained unexplored since the examinations of tlie Spaniards, who left little more than numerous names to prominent capes, points, unexplored ln1:vs and straits. In many cases it is very diffimtlt to reconcifo the desc·riptions of the old navigato1·s.

The entrance is iu Jatitmle 54° 49', longitude 131° 45', and on Tebenkofrs atlas is laid down about a mile wide and two miles deep, expanding into an ample basin insicle the mouth, which has an islet and rock in it. The course to enter this bay iR marked on another Russian chart as on the north side of the islet.. No depth. of water or details are given. ~<\.nother bay and anchorage is indicated as a stopping place for trading vessels about two miles further northward, along the ;;ame sl10re T<lliitcliago.ff Bay.-In latitude 55° 01' there i11 marked another small bay and anchorage on the south side of the southeast point of the entrance to :'\foira Sound. No name is giYen to this anchorage, but the large bay filled with falands just to the southward is called Tchitchagotl' by the Russians.
TANG.AS BAY.

This large bay is on the eastern sicle of the sound, on the middle one of the three large islands forming the Gra.virm group lying between Tangas Narrows and Clarence Sound. There are two entrances U1 this barhor, separated by a Jarge wooded island, or rather by a group of five or six smaller islands. noth entrances are in latitude 540 59', and the islands separating them are in longitude 1310 23', and ha.ve an extent of two miles ea.ch way.

The tliree large islands and numerous small ones designated as the GraYina group ha ,-e 11eYer been outlined. Two large cllannels pass through tllem from Clarence Sound to tbe Tang.as Xarrows, which opens into the sound in latitude 55° 2G', longitude 1;;2° 4:!', and has several aachorages throughout its length, with a very pretty basin on the east side of tlw uortlteru entra1rne atHl two or three mile:o; inside tlw northern point. This basin has a small islet in its entrance, and anchorage is obtained in twelve to fifteen fathoms of water over a mmld,v bottom. At the north entrance to Ta.ngas Narrows the north arm of Behm Canal leads from Clare11ce Sound to the north-northeast.
MOIRA
SOU~D.

The entrance to this sound lies in about latitude 5J0 02', is about t"·o mil<·s in width, and has several islets off each point. It penetrnt.es \Yales Island auout six: miles to the soutltwest; then turns sharply to the northwest. for six or eight miles, and terminateH near the head8 of Chohnondeley Souud, which comes from the north-noTtheast, and Tliakak Ba;y, which come:s from the southwest from Cordova Bay. "The land in the neighborhood of l\:Ioira Sound is high and rather stcE;p towards Clarence Sound; but north of "\Vedge Island, (in latitude 550 07',) the straight and compact; shores are moderately elevated, and the interior country is composed of lofty though uneven mountaius, prmlnciug an almost impenetrable forest of pine trees from the wat.er side nertrly tll their smnmits, hnt hy no means so high as we had been accustomed to see in the more inland country." (Vauconver, Vol. II, p. 381.)
CHOLMONDELEY SOL:"ND.

In latitude 550 17', Point Tchasine, or \Vatch Point, runs two miles directly west to the eastern side of the entrance to Cholmondeley Sound, one or two miles wide, and off which lie several h;lauds. This sound runs south-southwest for ten or twelve miles and opens into several unexplored arms. The head of the main body of water lies near the heads of l\Ioira Smmd and of Tliakak Ba.r, which opens into the northeast part of the unexplored bay of Cordova. On the inside of the entn~ncc to the sound and on the eastern si<le lies the native sctt.Jement of Chasintzeff.
KAZ.A.RN BAY.

An anchorage is laid down at t.he ent.rance of Kazan1 Bay, the opening to which lies in lafitmfo 550 27', longitude 132° 01 1, one and a hitlf mile inside the point eastward of it. A large island li<'s northeast of this point· while a broad unexplored arm of the sound runs westward of Kazarn. The ' . bay is four miles long, about one mile wide, runs about south-southwest, and has a settlewe.ut at its

PORT STE"-ART
A~D ADJACE~T

SHORE.

In the north arm of B!'hm Canal, wl1ich opens into the east side of Clarence Sound, in latitude 5;,o .30', at the lrnad of Tangas Narrows, lies Port Stewart, of whid1 the islet three-eighths of a mile northwest of the south point lies in latitude 55° 38' 1.>'', longitude 131° 45', on the western side of the canal. From the south point the north point bears north by west one and a l1alf mile. The general direction of the bay is northwe>it, and the depth two miles; but the upper part of the bay, receiving a small stream, is nearly filled by a flat at its western part, leaving a small bay in the north part land-locked with from six to 11ine fathoms of water, and one-quarter of a mile in extent; this has a narrow channel with seven fathoms close to the north shore, and rocks and shoal ground to the south of the channel. The islets on the south shore are nearly connected by shoals only visible at lmv water; but good entrance may be had in fifteen to twenty fathoms to the northward, and between them and a row of three smaller islets one-quarter of a mile off the northern shore. One-quarter of a mile south of the 11orth point h; a ror~ky patch with deep water all around. On the same side of Behm Canal, six miles north of Port Stewart, lies tllc opening to an extensi \'e bay running four miles west-northwest, with islets and rocks in the entrance, and an extensive settlement noted at the head on Tebenkoff'"' chart. This bay has no name on the charts. The point of land making out between Behm Canal and Clarence Sound is called Cape Caamano b;y Tebenkoft'; it lies in latitude 550 2~l', longitude 131 o 51 '. The sontl1 point of the entrance to Ernest Sound is ca11ed Point .Mesurier, and is situated in latitude 550 46', with a rock lying over a mile west-northwest from its extremity. From the point the shore runs east four miles to the entrance of a small bay not yet named, and running to tlm southeast two miles. It is one of the anchorages of the Russian steamers. The low wooded point called Tonkoi, on the western side of Clarence Sound, and seven miles west-north west from Point l\fosurier, has an anchorage on the north side, about one mile inside the point. The depth of water is not marked. This point lies abreast of the mass of islands forming the southern point of York Island, (Duke of York, Vancouver,) and Clarence Sound is here contracted to a width of four miles. From Tonkoi P1)int tlw shore runs northwest by west for six: miles, to the narrow opening of a large basin which Tebenkoff marks as an anchorage. It has a small islet in the entrance.
ETOLIN II.ARBOR.

fo latitude 56° 15' the large arm called Stakeen Strait makes into Clarence Sound from the northeast. This strait leads to the mouth of the Stakcen River by two arms. 'l'here is no station immediately at the mouth of Stakeen River, but on the northwest part of Wrangel Island (Kacbanna on Tebenkoff) is the small harbor of Etolin, in latitude 560 31' 3011 and longitude 132° 23' 30", where the Russians formerly had a stockaded factory. The harbor is very contracted, 011ly five lrnndred yards wide, opens to the northwest and runs to the southeast for about six hundred yards, but has good soundings, regularly decreasing from ten fathoms at the entrance to three and a half well inside the bay, abreast of the small island. A plan of' this is given in the Russian chart No. 10 of the Pacific Ocean series. This harbor is within t""·o miles of the north end of the island, off which lies a small islet, between which and the point we anchored in about sixteen fathoms, and found dil'lagreeahle counter currents running. From this islet the mouth of the Stakeen Rh-er, fronted by very extensive sandflats, lies nearly north eight miles distant. These flats extend southward from the mouth for six miles, and westward six miles, from the main to the islands forming the nort.I1 sl10res of Stakeen Sound, and thus block a straight wide passage to Frederick Sound, (Prince Frederick's Sound of Vancouver,) except for boats at high water. The river has a channel through these flats close along the main shore to the southward. The geographical position of the southeast point entrance to the rfrer is latitude 56° 40', longitude rn20 20'.

WRANGEL STHA11'.

It woul<l sen·e no practical purpose to endeavor to describe the intricacy of islands and sonncls l'iouth of Prederick Souud and east of Chatham Strait. Then' is 011l_y om~ a niilahlt' charm el lwtWPt>ll Clarence and Frederick Sound east, of Coronation Island, and that iis \Vraugel Strait, opening from the northwestern part of Stakeen Sound, in latitude [)()O 3.'.>' and 1ongitude 13:! 0 48'. It is tortuous, very narrow, has low wooded shores, broad beaches, and a mid-channel depth of not less than four or five fathoms. A sketch of this, on a large scale, is given on sheet No. lOb of the Russian charts of the Pacific Ocean series. This sketch is not Yer.r accurate, but can be used, especially at low watm·, when a few rocks not laicl tlown upon it. show th1,1rnselves. From the north end of \Vraugel Strait is visible the first great glacier that we baye seen upon the shores of these waters, although two are reported cveu south of Fort Simpson, oil the arms penetrating the continent in that vicinity. This glacier is 011 the north sideDf tlw em;tern part of Frederick Sound; and from two islarnls, about three miles northwest of \\Trangel Strait, it bore uorth by west true distant ten or fifteen miles: as well as we cotlld jmlge througlt the uiist aml rain. Rain clouds completel,v enveloped the top8 of the mountains between which it flowed. It was seen over a low i)()int on the north and east side of the sounu, and apparently opeued upon the shore in the bay east of Point Vandeput, about latitude ;no Ot?', longitmle 1320 5-!'. In this vicinity one of the early ice ships from San Francisco filled with glacier ice in the winter of 1853-'."i4. Anchorage is laid down on the west side of Point Vandeput, but no depth is marked.
CA.PE KYGANE.

Returning to Dixon Sound, and following the Pacific shores northward, we first notice Cape Kygane or Muzou, the extreme southwest point of the Territory of Alaska, in latitude 54° 4:!', longitude 1320 43'.8, according to the Coast Survey approximate determination. Tebcukoff gives a very indistinct view of it at a distance of twenty miles from the (lirection 11outlt 43° west. On the lHh of August we saw the ca1le within the distance of a mile, but cove1·ed with rainclouds nearly to the water. A view of the cape as it appeared to us was secured. No description of this important headland is found in any of the narratives within reach. Very fortunat.ely I was able to obtain sextant obsen·ations near tile cape in a momentary break in the clouds, and hope the results will allow us to consiuer its position moderately well determined. The wat,er arouncl the cape appeared bold, but showed strong current markings inside our position, which was ahout one mife distant.

KYGANE IIARBOR.

On the east 1-iil1e of Cape K,yg(rne., and about two and a half miles northward of its extremity, aftPr passing· a great number of islets close along the shore, tluee harbors open to the eastward upon CordoYa Bay, and two and a half miles weE;t of the southern point of the first large island (unnamed) in the hay. The soundings in tlrn approacheR to the harbors are about forty fathmm;. The southern baruor is about three-eighths of a mile wide, rum; west-northwest for one aml a half mileo, aml has a large islet inside and towards the southern slwre .. Up to this islet the soundings are not Jess than thirty fatltnms, and thm1ce gradually dt'crease towards the head. The second entr;rncc, lf'SH thau half a mil(' north of the southern one; is the opening into two arms of one bay, divided by a long uarrow island lying west..i10rthwest. The southern arm is that used a>; au anclwrage; i» one mile deep and less than a quarter of a mile wide, with soundings of six fathoms at the entrance, increasing to sixt<·en fathoms, and then diminishing to eight at the lwar1, where there is quite a snug hoat cm'e 011 the R011tl1 side, and a narrow passage to the northern arm on the north side. The northern :um or harbor has almost the samf' dimensions as the other, with deeper water at the entranc<~, (twenty-<>ight fathoms,) and a basin with six to eight fathoms at the head. The anchorag(e ill the middle lrnrhor or soutlwrn arm of the two northern harbors is placed in latitm1e ii40 46' aml longitude 1:t20 4.'l' :30", according to the chart of Btulin, given on the 11,ussian m tp No. 10. Tebenkoff gives 5J0 42', and 1;320 39', with a rise and fall of tide of sixteen feet.
KAZAN IlAY.

The west slwre of Cape Kygane is indented hy many Rmall bays opf;n to the ocean swell. In latitude 54° 48', el1w1;n mile;.; we;.;t-northwest of tlte cape, is tht> entrance to the large bay of Kazan, divicfod into two hy the large islaud called Dolgoi, or Long Island. 'l'he bay is three miles wide at the eutrance, and stretches eigl1t miles east-northeast, and at its lwad is filled by a lm·g(; munher of small islanrts. Between the south shore and Long Jsland the widtll of the ha~- is about onP mile, and from the southwestern point of tl1e entrance, called Ca1w Bazan~ runs east-northeast for five mi1es, haYiug ;;oundiugs of twent~' fathoms in the entran<'e, witl1 ten to fom:term until the east end of the island approaches a point from tlie sontliern sliore, when a depth of eight fa,thoms is found iu the passage half a mile wide. The anchorage is to the east of the. point of the main, with bottom in fifteen fathoms. The I~nssian mwigators inform me that in southwest gales a heavy swell rolls into this bay, which is exposed directly to the ocean, ~'et the chart clearly indicates that perfectly safe auchorage is to be had here. This is the "Jlort l\Iem·es" of Meares, who anchored here in twenty-three fathoms, over sand atHl shells. lfo plat~l'tl it in latitmle fi±o ."il', and thirt;y.fh-e miles east of Forrester Tslaml, (page 329.) Meares gives also a r011gh sketch of the place. Zarelbo places Cape Bazan in latitude 540 48', and longitude 1320 54', and states the rise and fall of tide at fourteen foct. He girns a rough eye-sketch of it in chart No. 9.
FORRESTER ISLAND.

The south end of this island lies in latitude 5J0 48', longitude 1330 29', distant thirty miles west 12° north from Cape Kyg{tne, sixteen miles broad off Uie coast and twenty miles south of Cape Bartolomo. Tebenkofl:' Jays it down as a high island, fl.Ye miles long by one and a half mile wicle, witlt rocks ofi' the soutl1 end, awl rocks and islet off the north end. We passed it in the night of the 11th of August, in thick, rainy weather, and got a very indistinct glimpse of it. The following descri])tion is from l\frares, page 3!.!7, August 13, 1788: "Douglas Island is a small island about two miles in circumference, and there are two or three small, lo\l', and rock,y islands lying off its north and south ends. It is yery l!igh, aml covered with verdure, and may be se1~11 at the distance of sixteen or seventeen leagues. It lies ten leagues from the main 1aud, in the latitude of 54° 58' and longitude 1330 17' ."

PORT PR01'EOTION.

This bay is situated on the northwest extremity of \\' ak8 Island, \Yhere the Clarence Sound turns from its north and ;;;outh course abruptly to the east. It opens to the northwest, aud its rsoutlwrn extremity or lwad Jies at the base of a Yer:r rt>markable barren, peaked mountain, which YancouYer named Mount Caldel'. This extinct yolcano is conspicuous iu ma11y points of ·dew, not from its superior elevation when compared with other mountains on the main, hut from its height above the rest of tlle country i11 its immediate Yicinity, and from its heiu~ visibli.' in ntrious directians at a groat distance. Point Baker, at the northern part of the bay, is on an islet close to the shore from the northeast point of entrance, from whence the opposite voint lie;.; south 270 west, at a distance of three-quarters of a mi)e. The channel is good aud free to enter, yet there is one 'lnl'k~ng rock, visible only at low fofos, lyillg south 1ao east. six lmmlred yards from J>oiut Baker. TJw kelp upon it will ,brive warning at high water, and on all sides tl1ere is a depth of from eight to twelve fathoms close to it.

North of Admiralty Island the Chatham Strait is mmally designated Lynn Canal, at the head of which enters Chilkaht River on tlle west, separated by Seduction Tongue from a deep hay on the east. Tl1e astronomical station of the Coast Survey was on the small treeless islet off the mouth of Chilkaht, and Mr. Mosman found the position 'to differ from the survey of Lindenberg, of th.e Russian-American Company. The correction in Jatitnde is se\'en miles.

But the channel inYariabl;v used bytbe Hnssians ii,.: that hetween Vitskari and J(ulichoft'. On the Engli1-;h chart this cham1el is erroneously contracted by t11P l:1ying tlow11 of a sm1kPn rPPf extending one mile east of Yitskari, nearly on the line towards Kuliehoff. Tlw Hussian captains assert that thl'y can and luwe passf'u Vitskari along it;:; sontllcm\t face within half a cable's kugth when steering a direct course to )-lochnati, a course north 1;:! 0 east, true.

It ammared, from the distance of a mile or t\ro, to be about fi.Jrty yards long· and ten feet aboye high water, with a rough irregular surface. In smooth weatlH'r it bas been lauded upon, a11d it has been recommernlml tha1 a light be placed upon it, as from thi'1 point it would illuminate an arc of the horizon beyoml the sound from south fi(iO west towurd Bi<Jrka lrdand, south 88° west toward Cape Edgecumhe, all(l be a g·uide to clear the rod' off Biorka. l<'rom the northwest poiut of Biorlrn lt bears north 6° east, distant seyen miles. From the rock oft' Biorka it bears north 210 east, distant l'<eYen and a half miles. Kulicho:ff Hock is laid down on the English chart south 100 east, two miles from Vitskari. 1t is about twenty feet hig·h, and less in extent than Yitslrnri. Tlwre are sn11kcn ror~ks to the north and soutlt\p·st of it, :ihout lrnll' a mile distant, and one tmrards Vitskari, a.bout a 'lnarter of a mile off, with tlet>p water and dangerom;; sunken rocks between tli0 Knlichoff imll tlw iRlets off Point Bourauof. Hut Tebenkoff aml the old l~ussian charts place the Vitskari an<l Kulichoff three mile.s a.part, while the latest unpublished HnRsian examinations about Kuliclloff phwe tlw reef a short distance north of the rock, with a passage of tweke fathoms between them and close to the rock, aud one of th<> Russian captains repmts pnssing through this channel. The English chart places Kulichoff morn than two miles from Bonranof, but the latest Russian determination mnke11 it only one and a half mile. For four milPs inside of Vitskari Rock we find clear, deep water, up to the range of wooded islands and rocks lying for two miles outside of Sitka. Through this barrier of islands there are tbrre channels to the anchorages east and west of the town. These passages are known as tl1e eastern, middle aml western, the fonner hPing tlw longest, and the middle one the shortest, to either a11chor· age. In approaching these islnndR in thick weather, the officers of the company endeavor to find the islarnl of lUoclmati, which is from. twenty to thirty feet high, rocky, aIHl covered with a thick growth of spruce, whosf' dark foliag(·, with the black rocks beneath, brought out in relief by the surf breaking aloug its front and on the outlying rock, makes it discernible through the fog wl1t·n other islands are indsible. This i11Iet lies fiye miles north 620 east from Vitskari, aml between t1ie middlP :-i IHI western chmmels, aml a Y<>ssel making it can take either, and safely run for the anchorage. "\Vhen the fog is lifting, from the coming in of a westerly wind, this island a}lpears first. Abre:tst of l\'Iochnati the westnu channel is about three-quarters of a mile wide, with a large reef, bare at low water, forming the western side; and the middle channel is contracted by sunken and exposed rocks to a much narrower entrance. The English chart, based upon that of La Perouse, gives a good idea of the f~hannels and the anchorages, which should only be eutered under the guidance of a pilot, or with good local knowledge. The inrlications of the Coast Survey local triangulation about Sitka harbor proper would seem to show that the base line of the original survey was erroneous, and this may possibly expl:iin the announcement on the English chart that "there are discrepaucies between this chart and the plan of Sitka (2~Htl) wl1ich cannot be arljusted." The harbor of Sitka is Yery contracted, and, in the western anchorage, numerous mooring buoys have been laid down by the Russian-American Company near the t<>wn, although this part of the harbor is narrow and marked by three sunken rocks, The eastern harbor receives the greater sweev of the southeasters) and a heavy swell is said tQ be brought in from the sound, so that the company's vessels prefer to anchor in the western, as they can discharge more readily, and especiaJly because, during the winter, the officers and crews are taken from the ships, wbich are left with only one keeper. But the British men.of-war use the ealitern harbor.

In the great gale of October 28, 18()7-the severest at this place for very many years-three or four ve8sels broke adrift from their mooring,; and several were driven ashore. The steamship ,John L.

The following is the- be,;t de'1cription that can be dnn1·n up from Portlock's sketch a,ud text: The opeuing to Portlock lmruor lips uetwePn two points l,\i11g northwest and southeast from each other aud tlistlint from three to four miles apart. This entrance is, however, diyided into three passages by two large, bluff, wooded islands lying directly between the points. 'rhe southeast island receired the name of Hogan, and that to the uorthwest, Hill. The ;.;onth passage is about half a mile wide, with bold shores and twenty fathoms of water. The middle passage i;,; a mile wide a.t the outer part, bnt at the inner part is contrm:te!l to half a mile, with t,eu fat11011u; of water, b,y two I.Jiu<, islets and rocks from the soutlieast point of llill IsLmd. The northern passage is narrow, and no soundings are given. Hoc;ks lie off tbe southeast voint of the bay au<l off the south poiut of Bogan bland, aml bare, rocky isleti:; and rocks off the northwest point of Hogan Island. The i;onth side of Hill Island is ''low land, forming itself into seYeral small bays, from whose points are breakers at no great distance," with hold rocks extPnding nearls half a mile off the southeast poi11t. Tl1e deepPst water in the middle passage between Hill and Hogan Islands is forty-six fathoms over rocky bottom; the length of tlti8 passage is about a mile; ha;; hold, ro(iky sliores, and the course through it is nearly northeast by east. Tlte best cou1se in would be to steer cast northeast for a wood ml islet insiue, and l,ying lmlf a mile north-northeast from the north point arn1 i;,;let of Hogau falall!l; hetwl~eu this wooded i:,;let and Hogan falarnl a 'lfopth of thirt.r-two fathoms is g·iven. The southeast passage ii:; about a mile in length. Immediately upon passing the hold rocks oft' the southeast point of Hill Island the water <lecpem; very quickly to thirty and forty fathoms, and a most spacious and excellent harbor opens to view, trending to the northwest and southeast, and running deep into the northward, with a number of small islands scattered about. Running up towar!ls tlie northwest part of the harbor, and afttn' passing; the i:;mall isl:rnd dose to thP uorth side of Uie unrtheast, point of Hill Island, Portlock anchored iu thirty-one fathomR of water, muddy bottom; the rocks off the eaRt part of Hill faland being just shut in by the small island, and bearing sonth three or four miles. (According t'> the Hketch they l1ore about south-southeast, distant one mile.) The country ~Hljacent to Portlock Harbor abounds with white cedar, wJ1ich was cut and sawed into Rheathing-hoards. (Page '.W2.) TlliR is evidently the yellow cedar of Alaska. Teuenkofti:,; eliart ~ives no illPa of a deep ba;y in this locality, although he has the name in latitude ;J70 45'.
ICY STRAIT OR CROSS SOUND.

The entrance to this stmit, is wide, open, and unobstructed by rock, -shoal, or island. This appears to be the case for ten miles within the heads, and Vancouver says that, if it possesses any navigable ot1jectiou, it is the unfathomable depth of water which eTerywht'1'e exists except yery near the shores, along which in many places are detached rocks, lying, however, out of the wity of nayigatiou, and sufficiently conspicuous to he aYoiued. The entrance is eleven miles wide between Cape S1>eucer on tlie nortli and Point Bingham on the soatb., bearing south HP east from the former. Inside of Citpe Spencer the strait expands into a great bay running fifteen miles north-northwest, and from ten to four miles wide. Six miles inside of Point Bingliam a Jlassage two miles wide opens to the south-southeast and runs ten miles in that direction, when it tnrns abruptly to the west-southwest, and reaches the ocean in about six or eight miles. This souml has been called Icy Strait, antl appears to well deserve the appellation. Tebenkoff says that ice is found there all the year, impeding navigation; and in July ~ind August Vancouver's officers :found part of the pasSilge almost closed with the ice. _Frequently the masses of ice are

Captain llrya11t says tlrnt tl1ere is a submarine range in the vicinity of the position usual1y assigned to it, lmt this can hardly be the case if they are the resort of the sea-otter, as will he shown to be the case. Tebenkoff says : "In the approximate latitude of the Dry Bay (latitude 59° 03') there exists a rock discovered in 17i9 by a Spaniard, Captain Arleiga, which he called Rook Pamplona. In 1794 Mate Ta1in, in the ship Orel, (Eagle,) saw it and named it after his vessel, but did not de.temrine its position."

The longitude of this island is not positively determined. It wa.'< visited in 1808 h.\' one of the mates of the Russian-_A_merican Company, and he reports that it is above sev('ll milN; long- from north to south, with a breadth of about three miles. The north end is iu latitmle ;)\)O $0 1, longitude 1460 30'. Off both extremities of the island are reefs extending three mile8 on tlie pmh;ngation of the longer axis. Off the northern reef is a rock upon which the water lireaks in great jt>ts, gidng it the form of a pillar, even with a comparatively smooth sea, and it has been appropriately named the Fountain. On the west side is a rock situated southwest three miles from the northern poiut of tlw islaud and north-northwest of the place used for anchoring, where a small cow: exi.-;ts with tllirtecn fathoms of water on~r a gravelly botfom.

The bay 1·n11R north u7° east for fiye and a half miles, diminishing rapi<lly in the htst two miles to a uarrow 8hallow bay. The southeast shore is bounded by high mountains, skirted along the immediatl· shore with a narrow belt of wooded land. The northwest shor(~ is bold, and for the first two miles formeu by the soutlrnast face of a high peninsula, terminating at the northeast by Cape Phipps, where a uarrow channel separates it from the m:tin and gin~s pas8age to a I:trge inner' hay or lagoon,'tl1e head of which stretchc8 8outhwest towards the sou11d, from which it is separated by a beaeh oHly a few huullre<l yards wide. This lagoon is about tvrn miles Jong and nearly one wide, with sha1low water occupied bs flats, but affording a channel of twelve feet water, nearly to I·'ort Constautiue, which lies north only two-fifths of a mile from the north point of the entrance t-0 Etches. \Vhere thl\ passage leaus from Port Etches to Constantine, or Brook Harbor, as the lagoon is called, the shore:'\ reeede and form a hay a mile wide, 11m'theast mul southwest,, aiHl nearly three quarters of ~t mile deep, with auehorage iu from five to seyen fathoms of water half a mile from shor(·, awl ·ffer Yery enm bottom. A~t the best auehoragc Point Phipps bears west and three rocky islets north. A small stream empties from the north into this indentation north of the aboye rocks. The Huf>si:rns lmYe an anchorage in the coYe on the southeast shore, east-southeast from Point Pliipps, with two sma11 stream:.; entering it. It appears well protected and has regular omundings in firn and f(mr fathoms. l'ortlock anchored here in 1787, anu called the island protecting it Garden faland, beca1rne he plant{;d a variety of garden seeds upon it. This anchorage affords an alnmdance of muscles and crabs, and the Indians supplied l'ortlock's vessel with Jllenty of cod and halibut canght in the bay. He named Constantine Harbor Brook Harbor. 'I'he l'Jugli8h chart by Belcher gi\'es a depth of two and a half fatlloms as the least water into Consta11tine Ilarlmr, but, a rock hadug ouly 8ix foet at low water i8 laid rlown in mid-channel on the Bnssian surYey by Chornoff. The current through the strait, which is only two hundred yards wide, sometimes runs four knots per hour. On the outer bay they arc also quite strong, and the rise and fall of tide is stated to be nine and a half foet. Fort Constance serves as a defense of the Tchugatz Indians against the eneroachments and attacks of the Ko1osbes anu 1Igalentz. At this bay Portlock cut sticks for spare topmasts, mizzenmast, and mainyard, besides getting out boards, &c. His men cimght fine cod and halibut in plenty, large quantities of herring, and as mauy as two thousand salmon at each haul of the seine.
SNUG CORNER COVE.

Twent;r miles north of Port Etches entrance is the south point of a loug, low wooded peninsula, stretching well into the souud from the east-northeast, and formed by Port Fidalgo on the north an(l Port Gravina on the south. Off-this point lie rocks, and a large islet off its west point. The northwest point of this peninsula forms the western point of the entrance to the Snug Corner Cuve of Cook, where the DiscoverJ' was anchored. We have not Cook's narrative for the description of this place.
MONT.A.GlJE ISL.A.ND.

This large and high fa;land may be said to lie broad in the entrance t-0 Prince William Sound, with passage;;; thereto at the northeast and southwest extremities of the island. It is forty-five miles long,-with an aw~mge width of seven miles, and lies n01·theast by north and southwest liy south, its southern point, named Cape Cleare, stretching well out into the Gulf of Alaska, and situ· ated in latitude 5!1° 4-W, longitude 1480 01'. The northern point lies abreast of the entrai1ce to Port Etches, about fiye and a half miles distant, forming the principal entrance to the sound, and through which the currents rush yery strongly. The currents through the entrance west of the southern extremity of the island are represented as running three and four knots per hour, and quite irregularly. The immediate shores of the island are well wooded, and much lower on the northeastern side than on the eastern.

This bay is situated on the northwest shore of .'.\Iontague falarnl, twPlYe mil!·s witl1 i11 tl1P sonthwest point of the island, and nearly abreast of the ishmd Latouche, that forms tlw we;;;t side ot' the channel. It is in latitude 590 fi8', longitude 147° 5J'. Portlock says that after a boat examination he hauled in for it, and anchored in twenty fathoms, oyer a mu<ld,'1- bottom. In r1mniug- iIJto tlie hay, just off tl1e south point, the soundings were seyen and eight fathoms, oYer a bottom of black mud and sand. This bank ap1)earcd to me ri.early across the mo11tJ1 of the liay, amL aftpr passiug it, the water deepened to twenty-one fathoms; and with this tlepth the south point of the (·11tra11Cl' bore southwest by south, about one and a half mile; the north point hore northwest hy west half west, about one mile; and the distance from the nearest northern shore was about a mile. His rough sketch of this bay shows that it lies about northeast by east for thrr~c and a half miles, with irregular soundings from the seyen-fathom bar across tlie e11trn11cc to twt·11t,'l--two fothoms in spots, and carrying ten fathoms to the head. In the extreme northeast part is a small indeutatim1, half a mile inextent, with four and a half to six fathoms water; and a stream tlows iuto the eastern part of this cove. The whole eaRt head of the harbor is au extensive flat. A YC.'lscl can lie in the cove in four and a half to five fatl10111s, about a cable's length from shore, with the south point of' the _harbor just shut in by the point forming the coye. This point may he taken close aboard, as the water is quite hold. The south point of the entrance is named Point Br;nmt; the northern, Point ·w ooclcock; their distance apart, about two miles, bearing northeast hy north and south west by south. The only wind to which tliis bay is exposed is from the southwest, au<l then a Yessel may run up into the cove and anchor in four and a half fathoms. From McI~eod H:u·bor, i11 sounding across the channel towards Latouche IsJarnl, fift,'1- and sixty fathoms are fouml over a muddy bottom soon after quitting tlie lrnrhor; no hot tom in mid-chmmel with seventy fathoms. Close to the shore of Latouche Island, within a cable's length, the soundings are from forty to fifty fathoms, and these arc carried to the north extreme of tb0 island.
Il.ANJ\JNG BAY.

Northeastward from McLeod Harbor the shores of Montagne Island are bold, with soundings of thirty fathoms over a muddy bottom, about a mile from land. About five leagues from McLeod Harbor, Portlock says lte came to a deep, wide bay where YesseJs may safely ride at anchor in from twenty to ten fathoms, muddy bottom. · With ten fathoms the anchorage is near the bottom of the bay, and about half a mile from shore, but the beRt anchorage seems to be nearest the south side, and no nearer the shore tba11 in from ten to twelve fathoms water. A fresh-water Rtremn enters into the south part of the ba;y, where Portlock drew his seines, and in one tide caught a quantity of salmon sufficient to load two boats.
G-REEN ISLES.

These islands lie four mile~ westward of the entrance to Chalmers Harbor on the northern part of Montague Island, and the soundings in the channel to the sound vary· from thirt~·-ftn· to twenty fathoms, until nearing the Green IslPs, when the water shoals, and frequently sew~n and eight fathoms were found by Portlock, with rockJ- and shell bottom.

POINT ELRINGTON.

Tliis is the south point of the middle island lietween the south end of Monta.gue Island and Cape Puget, aml lies fiye miles east of the latter. It is thus described by Vancouver: "A high, steep, barren prnrnontory, of small extent, connected to the south end of the island ~ya narrow isthmus."
POIN'l' PYKE.

North of Point Elrington about five or six miles is the south point of an unnamed island. It is bold and rocky, with a nmnher of islets lying off it, and was named by Vancouver, who states that it is remarkable fo1· its sugarloaf form. To the north of Point Pyke is a tolerably well-sheltered bay, surrounded on all sides by lofty abrupt, snowy mountains. To the north of this thereis a second bay, and also a narrow opening ten miles long to the northeast.

KE::'IAI PEXIXSrLA.

The western shores of Prince William Sound form the northeast part of the peninsula of Kenai, of which tlie outer or gulf shore commences with Cape Puget. The termination of t.he peninsula is named Cape Elizabeth. From Cape Puget to Cape Elizabrth thr Rhores ha;re been very wcl1 explm·ed b~- the R.ussian navigators, sf'arching for good harbors and shelter for the Russian whalt'rs. ThPir 1·eports show that the line of coast is broken by hays and coves, lmt no11e offering go()1l andrnragt>, there being very close to the shores not less than thirty to fift,\· fathoms of water. The coafit i:;; Yer~- rocky a111l steep and mountainous, yet covered with wood, while the ravines and gorges between the mountains ·contain in many places glaciers which stretch back from the hea,ds of the ba:ni eYen to tile gorges descending towards Cook's Inlet.
CAPE PUGET.

This cape, forming the southwest poiut of the entrance to Priucc 'Villhuu Sound, i;;; in latitude 590 53', longitude 1130 3!', and from this point the coast ha;;; a general treud for one hundred and ten miles to the Tsebugatz islands, formerly known as Cape Elizabeth. There is a glacier at the head of the bay just west, aud forming the mtpe, arnl in the second 'bay, se\·e11 miles \Yestwart1, a largt> glacier comes down i.nto the ocean, and is repreRented by the Hussian na...-igators a8 a Yer.1.· \Jeantifu1 and grand object, when seen in a c1ear day. \Ve finrl no description of Cape Paget! hut Tebenkoff's map represents it as a bold, higli, rocky head, with a face two miles long towards the 1wutlrnast, and having a line of rocks in front, with an islet off the eastern termination.
RESURRECTION RA.Y.

This extensive arm of the sea, from fifteen to twenty miles long, and six to three miles ·wide, lies twenty-five miles west of Cape I'ugct and northeast of the Chiswcll lslauds. It was wdl known in the fast century and selected as the future ship-yarcl of the Russian-American Company; but it does not present the proper facilities, on account of the great depth of water, the severity of the climate, and the wild nature of the coast. In Vancom·er's time four English shipwrights were conducting the ship-building of the company at this place. By frequent explmations of tlte company's officers the position of this bay is well known, but we have found no detailed description of it. Tebenkoff represents the western shore as low, the head as shallow, with a glacier at the northeast part; the eastern shore a.s bold and rocky, and Cape Resurrection, the eastern point of entrance, as a long, moderately low, narrow point, lint rocky and abrupt. Three large, low islands lie, respectively, 8onthwest, west, and northwest of this cape, while the Chhrwell Islands form a large group fifteen miles southwest of it.
ClIIS'\YELL ISLANDS AND SEAL ROCKS.

Forty-seven miles south 750 west from Cape Cleare, the south point of Montague Island, Tebenkoff locates thA Seal Rocks five miles outside of the Chiswell lslauds. Fifteen miles off t.hese Vancouver obtained s01.mdings in seventy-five fathoms, and l)ortloek gives seventy-six fathoms over a muddy bottom forty-five miles south 60° east from them. The recession of the coast line between Cape Puget and the seal rocks is named Blying's Sound, indented by several large bays open to the south. Of the Chiswell Islands Vancouver says: "V\~e passed them and found the center of the southernmost group in latitude 590 31' ; from these the easternmost, which is a single detache<l rock, lies north 540 east about a league distant, and the northernmost which the hazy weather permitted our seeing, having several less islets and rocks about it, lies north 150° east, five miles distant. These were all we saw of the Chi.swell Islamls, which are a group of naked, rugged rocks, seemingly destitute of soil and every kind ·of vegetation. The southern group is named the Seal Rocks by Tebenkoff, and the middle and principal one of the five is placed in latitude 13!)0 34', longitude 149° 321· What Vancouver called the Chiswells proper is in reality a. group of islets, and the broken and numerous points of two long, low, wooded promontories, stretching southward and forming Aya.lik Bay, off which lie the Chiswell Islands, n01·th by west five miles from the Seal rock.

Senmty-six miles .-;outh, seyenty-two we.it from Cacpe Ckitre, lie the I>ye Islands, forming- part of thf' en stern Rhme of the deep bay ofNuka, fifteen rnil<~s long and six to two miles wide. This bay lia,.; a gPneral direetion to the north-northeast, with alteruntely lo"- and bolll rocky shoreR, while the main arm has several smaller ones. The head of the em;tern oue, sen~uteen miles north-northeast from tJie southernmost of the three PyP Islarnls, is formed by ;i glacier. The other rniiu arm extends to the north-northwest, and then north-northeast, and is much more extermiYc than the eastern. The shores of both are wooded. Vancouver says: "The southernmost part of the Pye h;Jmuls, from fHWeral points of view, frn·ms a very c011spicuous peak, which, thouglt uot n~markable for its grnat height, yet from its singular appearance is not easil,v to be mistaken in the neighborhood, as it {}escends with great regularit;v from its summit to the water's edge. Its southern extremity, by our ohse1Tations, j,.; situated in latitude ii!l 0 J !l' ." He says that a group of rocks lying south 7:-;::i we8t, nearly four miles clistant from the southernmost of the Pye Isl<tnds, must be ver.r dangerous in thick weather, especiall.'- as at high water, during the spring tides, it is probably ove1·floweu. Tebenkoff says the rocks lie south noo west, six miles distant from the southernmost part of the Pye Rocks, and two and a half miles square off the large rock;y islands forming the westmn side of the eutrimce to Nuka nay. The approximate geographic.al position of tl1e soutl1ern point of Pye Ishtnds, according fo Tebenkoff, is Iatitml iilJ 0 20', longitude 1;;0° :?8 1 · Nine miles east h.r north of the Pye Islands Vancouver g;in~s soundings in seventy-fh-e fathoms.

Half wa.'' from the P;rn Islands to Cape Elizabeth the outer cape is called Point Gore, in latitude 590 rn 1 , longitude 150° 58 1 , ancl the three-miles-wide entrance to the west of it is the opening· to Port Dick, which runs northward ten miles, with a broad arm ten miles long penetrating to the west. The immediate shores of this bay are low and wooded, with streams coming into the hea(l of each arm 1 and no glacier laid down on Tebenkoff.
TCHUG ATZ ISLANDS.

Three large islands, from t'vo to three miles off the southern end of the Kenai Peninsula, are disposed in a curve around it. The eastern and western are large, three or four miles extent, and lie twelYe miles apart. The middle one is smaller, and lies half wa;y between them and a little to the southward. Three islet8 are laid down one mile off the western side of the eastern ishtnd; rocks a hove and below water one ai.ul a half mile off the west side of the middle one, and rocks one mile off the southeast face of the western oue.

The WPst.ern point of the western island of the Tchugatz is named Cape Elizabeth, and is formed by high lanu. Tebeukoff Ia~·s it down in latitude 590 9', longitude 151 o 51 1· In tbe strait between theTchugatz Island and the main or Kenai Peninsula there is a good anchorage and shelter, according to Portlock, whose boats traYersed all these waters; but Vancouver doubts the existence of a channel to the southward and east.ward through these narrow straits, as he discovered some low, lurk}ng rocks, which had the appearance of being conn~ted with a clu st-er of rQcks above tbe surface of tlie Sf'.a, lying from the eape south 500 east, a.t the (li8tance of three or four miles.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
COOK'S INLE1'.

The general dirPetion of this b'Teat arm of the sea is north-northeast, and its length one hundred aml sixty miles. 1"'7 ithin the Capps Donglas and Elizabeth it expands to sb:ty-ftve miles in width; in fifty-five miles from the entrance it contracts suddenly to twenty-fiye miles, w11ence it gradually diminishes to twelve or fifteen, with the channel contracted by ReYcral extensive flat~ off the rivers emptying into it. Its extreme northern })()int is in latitude t>1° HY, at the mouth of.the Strchitna Ri\·er coming from the north, and "abounding in sla,te." Gook's Inlet iR the gTeat boast of the Riu;sian mwigators and authoritieR as the best part of Alaska, arnl has been favorably noticed by nearly all the old discoverers. The well-known existence of coal upon its short>s and iu its bays may make it a very valuable acquisition to the Paciftc Coast. The em;tem shore of Cook'R Inlet, after pa1:;sing Tclmg·atchek Bay, is undulating, and this characteristic extends fifteen miles inland to the base of the mountains. It has a pleasant, green appParant~e in s11111mer, rnn·erml with herbage arnl dotted wit.11 patel1es and clumps oftimher. But the character of the soil is marsh and peat. The same sphagnum covers it that is found throughout the Alexander Archipelago, Kadiak and Una1a8ka. Eastward of this comparatively low ground rises the mountain range that extends through the length of the Kenai Peninsula, and ftlled "ith glaciers on both flanks. TlH· WPstern shores have a narrow border of low wooded land at the foot of the Alaska Mountailrn. "\Yestward of J\lt. Augustine Island the shores appear the margiu of" an extensin~ low couutry lying before the 1nv·;e of thelic rugged mountains." (Vancouver.) Northwanl of this i:slancl t,be shores are ''indented and broken iut.o CO\~es ancl small bays that appear capable of affording anchorage.'' "The points of the entrance of these bays are in general steep and rock:_v, behind which rises a compact mountainoL1s country to a considerable height, clad in perpetual snow. A narrow flat margin along the shorn is tolerably well wooded." Twenty miles northwest by west from the northeast point of Augustine, is a small bay opening to the southeast, with a small islet on the south side of the mouth. A.t the head of this bay is a factory of the Hussian-American Company, from which a trail leads about seven miles through a gap in the mountains, to a series of small lakes discharging within a distance of fifteen miles into the great 1ake of llliamua. which empties through the Kviclmk River into Bristol Bay, on the northwest side of the peninsula of Alaska. Tlle great. volcanic peaks of llliamna and Redoubt, rising to 12,066 and 11,270 feet elevation, respectively, (8ee view;; in Tebenkoff chart,) lie in tlle range of compact, connected and very high mountains binding the western shores of the inlet, but throughout these waters the shoreR are well wooded, and north of the U.edoubt the mountains retreat well to the northwest. Twent~·-eight miles n01thwest of Cape Douglas is the eastern point of J\it. Augustine Island, about eight miles in <liameter and nearly round. Between it and the shores to the south-southwest, sixteen miles distant, lies the Bay of K.amichak, with soullllings from seven to thirteen fathoms on a line directly across it from north and south, and passing tangent to the west sille of the island.
MOUNT .A.UGUSTIJ\'"E ISI,.A.ND.

This forms a very remarkable island, rising with a uniform ascent from the shores to its lofty summit, whicI1 is nearly perpendicular O\'er the ceuter of the island, in<}]ining, however, a Jittle to thl' eastern side. Towards the soutl1 side the shore is Yery low, from whence it rises with a regular but- steep ascPnt and forms a lofty, uniform, conical mountain, presenting nearly tlie same appearance from every r·oint of view, and clotliecl down to the water's edge with snow and ice, (May, 1794,) through which neither tree nor shrub protrude. Great fragments of rock Jine its northeast, north, and northwest. shorcsr which are steep and rugged. The natives say these rocks are borne there and deposited by the great masses -0f ice driving out of the inlet when it breaks up, and they affirm to noticing t.lle increase within not remote times. Tbe widtl1 of the passage between the western side of the islaml and the neaxest jutting, rooky point of the mainland to tbe west-northwest is six miles, through which Vancouver's boats passed half a league west of the island in seven, five, and nine fathoms, and anchored on. the noTthwest side in twelve fathonftt, over muddy bottom.

The shores of th is bay, named Bourdien's Bay b;r Vancou>er, as well as the shores of the whole inlet, baye been closely examined and well delineated by the office1·s of the Rm;siaH-American Company. In the mid-channel of Cook's Inlet, before re~whing the great contraction of the bay abreast of Anchor Point, in latitude 590 51', tlie depth of water is thirty-three fathoms, and decreases Yery regularly to ten fathoms at the head, in 610 06', where the approximate risf' and fall in spring tides is twenty-seyen feet. The extremity of the peninsula of Kenai, for the last fifty miles towards Cape Elizabeth, is only twenty miles wide, owing to a long arm of the inlet, called 'l'clmgatcltek Bay, making in the southwest point and nearly parallel with the peninsula. The southwest and nortl1west shores of the extremity of the peninsula are indenteu by several good ltarbors, now assumiug importrrnce on account of the deposit of coal well known to exist there, and of others previously k11mv11 only to tlte Russian auth~rities, and on this expedition communicated to the Coast SurYey with manuscript maps.
PORT CIIATHAM.

This is the nrst bay inside of Cook's Inlet on the shores of the Kenai Peninsula, aml the southern points of its entrance may be said to be formed b;y Cape Elizabeth. VanconYer giYes a plan of it which has been copied by Tebenko:ff. From that cape, marked by a small islet off it, the southwest point of the inner e11trance to the harbor bears north 45° east, distant five and a half miles, and half a mile before reaching that point there is a rocky patch marked by an islet. lnside the entrmwc the harbor extends about teu miles east, and has an average wiuth of one mile. The passage iuto it after lea Ying Cape Elizabeth is free from all obstructions hut such a.s are sufficiently conspicuous or easilJ' aYoided. These consist principally of shoals that extend a little distance from each point of the ltarbor. Even hetween tlte islet and rocky patch southwest from the south point of the entrance, a passage exists that has from seYen to twelve fathoms of water. The soundings in general in Port Chatham are tolerably 1·egnlar from five to twenty-five fathoms; the bottom a stiff clay. The shores are in most places a low border, very well wooded with spruce and some shrubs. This border forms a narrow margin between the shore awl the foot of the mountain, up which to a certain height trees and plants grow; but the tops of the mountains are, covered with snow. (!\fay, 1794.) Tlte anchorage on the south shore is on<> and a half mile inside the point, in latitude 590 14'. The rise and fall of the tides near the changes of the moon is fourteen feet, and neaps about eleven feet, but they are greatly influenced b;y the force and direction of tl1e winds. Vancouver considers thh· harbor, with reference to its proximity to the ocean, eal'le of access, egress, and convenient communication with the shores, superior to any in these regions. Bnt he never examined Tchuga.tchek Bay, where the currents are not so uncertain an<l nuiaule, where the bay is four or .five miles wide, and especially where bright clear weather exists while the whole of the Cape Elizabeth region is in fog and drizzle. Russian and American captains give the preference to the northern bays.
GRAHAM HARBOR.

Eleven miles north 270 west from Cape Elizabeth is the long, rounding, low, wooded point named Point Bede, guarded by some rocks. Oil' t,his point the ebb ~rrent sets from tltc north by compass, at the rate of two knots per hour; the fiood sets from the south, and runs nearly at the same rate; the rise and fall of the tide is reported at fourteen feet. For five miles beyond Point Bede the shore runs about northeast by east to the south point of the Graham harbor of Portlock, (the English harbor of the Rl~sisians.) Through the kindness of the Russian officers we are enabled to forward you a tracing of a manuscript chart of this bay, with rocks laid down that have been very recently discovered. This harbor ts the one where coal was first discovered on this coast by Portlock, and the anchorage close under the north point was named by him Coal Bay. He gives a sketch of the harbor and a view exhibiting the locality of the coal seams.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The enkance to the harbor is formed by Dangerous Cape on the north and Russian Point on the south, the former lying north 18CJ east, two arnl a quarter miles from the Alexander settlement on the lattl'r. A rocky n·<·f extends one mile northwest from Dangerom; Cape, and detached rocks with interYm1ing deep passages stretch out three-quarters of a mile s1rn01west frn111 tl1f1 same cape. There is a Hiu::;.;ian station and an ~~lentian ,-illage on Unssian I'oint, and a "p1easa11t picee of 1:1Jl(1 alJ011t twn hnn<lred yards wide stretches southwurd an<l westward of this point for one mile, bordered by a good sandy beach ou one side, and on ti.le inside by a small lake of fre:::;h water, which empties itself into the sea'' three-quarters of a mile from the station. This lake or lagoon is one of a cltaiu of lakes reaching well inland_ This" beach terminates at each end in higl1 points of land, which form a snug bay where small eraft might lie with safet.r-" From Hussian Point au extensiYe shoal makes hroad off the shores of the above beach for one mile, ·with part of it, just under the point, bare at half tideTh() gc·neral dirt>ction of the buy is son th ()2'."l east for four and a half miles; th.en sonth-southeast for two llliles, ('JH]ing, howeYer, in veI':_Y extensive mud flats, reeeh-ing several small streams, which Pmtlock entered "ith Lh,; boat at high water. These streams were fille1l witl1 salmon, which the l1earn 1·anw down tn feed 1111011. One mile within tlte entra1we, and nearly in the middle of the bay, lies Passage Island, about half a mile long in the directiou of the bay, and a quarter of a mile broad. AlJreast of the inner poiut of tl1is i8laud the harbor contracts to one mile iu width, maintaining that width for the next three miles_ From the southwesh:>rn point of Passage Island a long reef extends over a mile west-southwest, nearJ,r across the south chaunel to Hussian Point, off which a ver_y narrow 1mssage exists, and Portlock says he examined it and found plenty of water. The passage on the north side of the island is the better one, with rocks off eacli point for a couple of hundred yards, but leaving a channel of five hundred yards wide, with seventeen fathoms of water OYer a muddy bottom. Ju Pntering this hay b,\' the north channel Portlock sa;p1 he fonnd a" :;;trong outset current, although the tide was flood," and upon leaving it "with the flood tide was cauied out very rapidly by curreut,s to the northward past Dangerous Cape." Tbree-quarters of a mile inside the nortlwast J>oint, abreast of the cast end of Passage. Island1 a number of sunken rocks stretch across the harbor about half way. The J{ussian sketch exhibits one i·ock iu this ledgT\ ahoYe 1Yater, and three and five fathoms over the rest. It will be well to pass a quarter of a mile east of Passage Island to clear a sand· tongue making out from it, and then haul southward for the southern shore towards a house on the beach. Safe anchorage may be had anywhere in the harbor, and towards the head in ten fathoms water, where the bottom is mudd,y. Close under Dangerous Cape is Coal Bay, a small anchorage of less than half a mile in extent, witl1 soun<liugs from twelve to fi \'e fatlioims on~r fine black sand_ To enter this cove and clear the reef off the cape, run for Passage Island until the cape bean; north by east one half east (true) about one mile distant, and steer north 30° east (true) towards the middle of the cove. It will not be safe to bring the cape anything to the north of the first course, as a, rock with one aud a half fathom at low water lies north 50° west, one mile from the nortli point of Passage Island. A village is located on the small stream in the southeast part of the cove_ A second cove, twice as large as Coal Ba,y, lies one mile south-southeast from the latter, with good anchorages in ten t-0 ft~teen fathoms of water. The northern shores of this cove, which is about three-quarters of a mile wide, are bold and rocky, and guarded by rocks, but at the bead of it there is a fine smooth beach, near which is a run of good water. Another opening, close under the point at the south, is the entrance to a salt-water lagoon or lake, called Selenic Lake.. Here Portlock reports wood of different kinds in great abundance, such as pine, (spruce,) black birch, witch hazel, and poplar. Many of the pines are large enough for lower masts of vessels of four lumdred tons, and in eYery place wern plants anu shrubs of many varieties growing with great strength and vigor.

Three miles east-northeast of the eastern point of the latter bay is a bolll, rocky point, forming the southwestern point of the entrance to a broad bay full of islands, with a long arm penetrating some miles to the southeast, but nnexpl01·et1. Twenty-fixe fathoms are noted in the eutrance, and anchorages designated close under the western point.
TCirFGATCHEK BAY.

Nineteen or twenty miles north 5±0 cast from tlle reef off Dangerous Cape is the north point of the entrance to Tchugatclwk na,''· This point is low, three miles long, and oYer half a mile wide, stretching from the north shore half way across the entrance. In approaching this point the immuscript map obtained from the Russian oillccrs locatrs two sunken rocks Uiat are almost in the mid· dle of tlie approaches to the bay. Tl1e first one bears south (iGO -west, fin· and a half miles from tlie extremity of Entrance I'oint, and the second sontlJ .:rn° west, distant two and three-quarter miles from the same. Tebenkoff does not give them on his chart. Close off the point ten and fifteen fathoms are given, and tweuty-seven in the middle of the entrance. :From tlti"l point the hay has a general direction north 470 east for nineteen miles to the head~ but the last four miles are occupied u,y a broad flat, with an island in it, although Tebenkoff gives fonr fathoms around this islancl. This flat carries a broad margin along the whole northwestern shore, even to }Jntranee Point. Along the inside of this tongue (Entrance Point) the beach or flat extends nearly half way to the point, contracting the anchorage bay, bnt still le:n'ing it about one and threeqnarters of a mile in extent, with seven fhthoms of water. Upon this tongue, fl urea.st of the hroatl heac11 or ilat, is a long, 11arrow l:igoon. Oatsitle of the point, to the northward, is n hrnatl hcacl.1. for some mih's to the northwest. Inside this tongue of land, and al.1reast the anchorage. there is found an extensive coal seam, seven foet thick, and not yet ~-orked hy the company, because it opens upon the beach at low tide, and will require, outlay of capital to develop and work it. This, or simila,r seams, crops out on the shore between the ba:y and Anchor Poiut in two places for an extent of se\·eral miles. ]from Entnrnce Point tlirf'erniles ~muth 750 east there is an isletjoinecl to the southern sl1orf\ by a low sand tongue; this decreases the adual width of the entrance of the bay. East of that islet are two or three coves, but no soundings arc given for them, except at the entrance of the second, where twenty-seven fathoms is laid down in the approaches. · The geographical position of the extremity of Entrance Point is la,titude 50° 37' 10", and longitude 1510 22' 10". From Entrauce Point the coast rmu1 nearly straight for t1Vent.r-one miles north 50° west to Anchor Point, in latitude 59° 51', longitude 151° 53 1· The climate of this bay is much preferable to that at Graham Harbor. Navigators report t,hat they have anchored here, and had clear, beautiful weather~ while they coulll see the thick, heavy masses of fog and rain clouds along the mouth of the inlet in the vicinity of Cape Elizabeth. In winter it is, however, very cold, and in excessively cold winters the whole inlet freezes nearl,\· or quite as far south as Anchor Point.. The Coast Surzey has been furnished with a manuscript chart of the coast, including Tchugatchek Bay, from Russian Point to Anchor Point.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

This suqject jg brought to au abrupt. termination at this date, (December 27,) because it is necessary to close at some point, as the description of the whole coast hence to the Arctic Ocean, including the Aleutian Islands, &c., will require se,·eral hundred pages, and demand the searching of all the old arHl recent mwigators for the details of headlands, hays, &c., scattered through their rrnnatives. Suell materials are very ,-aluahle, but inaccessible to the navigator, the whaler, and the fisherman, yet should he gathered by the Coast Snrvey, especially as it would require years of examination in 8UCh a climate, and with such short, working Seasons, to aggregate a thorough descriptive rnenroir of the coast. Most of the descriptions are meager and indefinite, but they could remain until supplanted by the minute accuracy of the survey as the work progresses, just as the compiled charts will graduaUy yield to our exact determinations. There is yet a large amount of interesting information to communicate during the reduction of obsena.tions for the determination of geographical positions, upon the probability of islands in the Gulf of Alaska imd a{ljacent waters, currents, &c. It will, however, require much time and study to place it in proper shape, but will be communicated as early as practicable. It may, however, be mentione<l here that during the voyage home the places were ascertained where the vessels engaged in cod-fishing principally fish. The waters between Alaska Peninsula and tl1e Sluunagin Islands are well protected from the heayy swell of the Pacific, and the San Francisco vessels have generally resorted there, and it is their practice on Saturday nights to run for Coal Harbor, on the north end of Unga Island, and remain there over Sunday night, when they again start for a week's fishing. The proposed plan of operations for the Coast Survey work demanded on the coast of the new territor.r, where new means and methods must be devised to insure progress with the necessary precision of the Coast Survey, has not been incorporated with thi:-i mport, because, upon reflection, it is deemed adYisable to develop it in a separate communication in detail, that would have little interest outside the organization of the work. Yer.r respectfully and truly, yours, GEORGE DAVIDSON, .Assistant United States CoaJJt Survey.
Professor BENJAMIN PEIRCE,

Superintendent United States Coast Survey, Washington, D. <J.

APPENDIX A.
The following list of the geograpl1ical positions of four hundred and twenty-four places, principally upon the coast of Alaska, has been compiled chiefly from Russian authorities. In its preparation the intention was to introduce all determinations of position tlutt appeared to haYe been made by actual obserYatiou, even when the localities are quite close. In the arcliipelago Alexander most of Vancouver's latitudes haye been introduced, although in such waters they are not of great practical value. It is believed the latitudes are generally within two miles of the actual position ; and in many cases where several observers had determined them independently, the errors may be less than a mile. The longitudes of harbors regularly Yisited by vessels of the l~ussian-American Compar.y appear to be fairly determined, except toward the western termination of the Atlantic chain, wl1ere large discrepancies, reaching 30' of arc, are exhibited by the comparison of results between Russian authorities and the lJnited States exploring expedition to the Nort,h Pacific in 1855. Positions by different authorities are given in some instances to show these discrepancies. The comparison of the latitudes and longitudes at Victoria, Fort Simpson, Sitka, Chilkaht, Kadiak, and Unalaska, between English and Russian and the United States Coast Surrny determinations, exhibits larger errors than might have been expected. The uncertainties that ex1st in the geographical positions of many islands, headlands, straits, and reefs; the great dissimilarity of outline and extent of recent examinations of some of the \Vestern Aleutians; their want of reliable data concerning the tides, currents, and winds; the almost t-0tal want of detailed descriptions of headlands, reefs, ba.ys, straits, &c.; and the circumstantial testimony of the Aleutian fishermen concerning islands visited hy them and not laid down upon the charts, point to the great necessity for au exhaustive geogn111hical Teconnaissance of the coast, as was done for the coast of the United States between Mexico and British Columbia.

UNITED STATES COAST SFRVEY STATION,

Sitlw, A/al{ka, Ai1g1rnt 21, 1867. DEAR SIR: In atocordancc with your instructions, I make the following report HllOn the aids necessary to navigation in Sitka Sound, and the approaches to tlle ha1·bor of New Archangel or Sitka: The heads forming the entrance to 8itka Sound are soutll pohit of' Kruzov Island, called Cape Edgecnmbe, and tlie northwest point of lliorka (Birch) Island; the latter bearing east by south oneq tiarter Routh (compass) eleYen and a half miles from the former, which is the rocky, lJlufl'8lwre of the wooded vlateau making out from the base of the extinct Yolcano, Monnt Edgecum be, situated a bont four and a half miles north-uortheast from tl1e cape, and having a YfWy extender1 horizontal summit, the rim of the crater, and 2,855 feet above the ocean, with regularly sloping side8. Thus far I have seen it in thick weather only, arnl consider it a remarkable and characteristic land-fall for this port. It has been esteeme1l 1mch by navigators of all countries, there being nothing similar to it in this region. The navigators of' the Russian-American Company inform me they consider it the most recognizable hc;~dlaml along this coast, being readily known fifty miles at sea. The immediate shores of Cape Edgecumbe are formed of high, bold, and rocky bluffs, mostly of lava, and guarded by many rocks. The southern end ofKruZO\' Island, forming the north side of Sitka Sound, i·uns from Cape Edgecumbe a general conrse of northeast three-quarters east for seven miles, to Otmoloi Point, or Point of Shoals. Nearly midway between these points and one and a half mile off the shore lies the wooded islet of St. Lazara, or Cape Island, with from twenty to five fathoms between it and tbe shore. From Otmoloi Point, on a line directly across the sound, to Bouronov Point, on the island of Bai·anoff, the bearing is east by north three-quarters north, and distance sPveu and a half miles, being tbe narrowest part of the sound, which is further contracted on this line by dangerous reefa and rocks, leaving, however, between them three passages, with deep water, and each nearly one and a half mile wide. Among these clangers lies Vitskari Rock, or rocks, with adjacent sunken reefs. The principal rock, I judged in passing it, to have an extent of over one hundred foct, and about ten feet above high water, with an irregular an<l broken surface. Upon the English chart No. 2337 a reef is laid dowu..as stretching out one mile to the northeastward; but Captain Lemaschaffski, of the Russian-American Compau~-, informs me that ou a north-northeast course he llas passed, in very deep water, onequarter of a mile from Vitskari. As I saw it, the breakers do not extend far from the rock. Frqro Otmoloi Point it _bears ea~t by north three-quarters north about three and a quaxter miles, an~ ~IO the northwest pomt of Bwrka northwest by west three-quarters west, seven and a quarter miles;.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SUltVEY.

Riorka Islaml is about two miles long, in a northwest and southeast line; eomparatiw·ly low, with rocky, bluff shore>1, ei::;pecially marked on the north Ride, aml a couple of islets off tl1e northwest point. lt is coYercd with low trees. The ua,-igators of the Hussian-American C'ompauy inform me that there is a narrow, contracted harbor, about oue mile and a half east of the northwest point of Biorka, with ten, seren, a1ul fiye fathoms of watPr, nffordiug protection from the southeast swell. Tb is wou11l duu btless affmd a capital anchorage for pilot-lioats. Ou the English map !!:~:n, there is laid down, two miles northe~u;t h~· east mte-half east from the north t·nd of Biorka Island, a rocky patch, of half rt mile in extent, having ten feet of water upon it at low water. Captain Iiemaschafiski informs me that he has watche(l this roek when a ver,Y he[wy but smooth swell waR ro1ling in, and that it breaks only in 01ie single 8]1ot, arn1 tlwn onlr every few mi1111tt>s, (sa,\- fi ,.e or six.) He expresses his con,·ictiou tlmt them is uo more than one rock in this situation, with deep water around it. For four wiles inside the Vitskari aud Kulichoff HockR the sonnd is free from dangers up to the range of numerous islet?. aml rocks lying for two mile:-; outside tl1e anchorage of :New Arclrnngel. Through this mass of islets them are three channels leading to the anchorage, known as the eastern, middle, and western channels, the former being the lougest. In approaehi11g these islands in thick weather, tlJP miYigators of the Russiau-AnwrieaD Compau~- endeaYor to maklc' tlw islaml of I\Iochnati, which is from tw-ent;y to thirt.y foet high, rocky, a111l 1~0Yere1l with a thick grow-th of spruce, whose dark foliage, with tlie hlaek rocks heneath, brought out in greater i·elief hy the surf ureakiug around its base, and on tho outlying A1mke11 rock, makes it discernihk through the fog when other islands are uurecognizable. Tliis islet lies between the entrancC's of tlw westeru and middle c!tannel, and a vt's>ml making it can take either, and safely rnu through for an anehon1ge. \Ylw11 the fog· is lifting from tl1e coming in of a westerl;v wind, or otlwrwise.. this islaud applc'ars to sta1111 out clearly before the others do. 'YLen a.breast of J\Ioclmati, the westem chmmel is about thmc-qnar. tcrs of a mile in width, with a large reef, bare at low tide, and tvrn or three rocks, visible at big-h water, forming the we::;teru 8ide of the channel. 'l'he middle channel is contracted hy sunken and exposed rocks to a much more limited entrance. From VitRkari Rock to J\1ochuati, tlw lwaring i8 northeast by noi·th, and the distauce fhre miles. The best auclwr:1ge is in the eastern harbor where deeper w;1ter, greater extent, an (1 good bottom are found. I woulu therefore reconuuencl that two lights he establishetl iu Sitl>:<t Sound; one on the Vitskari Rock and the other on Mochuati; that the building on the former be -painted black, as beiug much more rea(lily made out iu thick weather, eRpeciall,,- with breaking water a1·ouutl it. The bnildiugs on Moclrnati should be white, if the mass of trees is retained, as sl10uhl be tlte ca.se. lf these trt>es are cut down, it will be a serious mistake. If the tower is built. liigl1er than the tops or t!JP trlc'es, (which I judge to rise seYenty.five foet abow the island,) t.he upper part shonhl be paiuted black. The light on l\Ioclrnati should he of about the same order as that on Fort Point, irt the Golden Gat,e, and, I tbink, need not rise more than eighty foet above the water. The light on Vitskari should be about one hnudrPd feet above the sea, aud thus be Yisible from a ship's deck about six:teen miles in clear weather. lt would command au arc of the horizon of seventy degrees from suuthwest by west, round the south to south-soothe.a.st, a fow degrees of this arc being inten~epte<l by tl1e islaml of St. Lazara. A Yessel from the southwanl wonlrl thus opPn it by Biorka l81and, when well in with the coast. I think the ligl1t should be about tlw same order as that of Poiut Boneta, at the entrance to the Goltlen Gate. The present arrangement of an approaching vesisel's gun in thick weather, or at nig·ht, being answered by a gun and li~ht from the governor's house, might well be retained in part, by answering a yessel's gnn fron1 Vitskari, ifpr:wticable. It was impossible t-0 land upon Vitskari dnriug our Rta,v at N<>w Archm1gl'l, on aecount of conturued lmd weather, either to nwasure its extent or to ascertain the nature of the rock!'\, and t11e difficulties of working tlie.re; but from onr examination of the rocks on the adjacent islands, tliere is no doubt of its affording secure and ample foundation. Of building material there fa quite n Yaricty iu the vicinity of Sitka; the best we haY<' discovered.is a marble formation of great extent and fine texture onl;r fifteen miles from New Archangel, outcropping to the water's edge, with a hold, high hill behind it, and a rnurow channel with six fathoms water in front of it, and thtee fathoms directly at tbe shore at 1Jigl1 water. 011 the other side of this narrow channel is a broad flat., bare at low watt>r, making out from ;<;}rn opJlOsite shore.

I luwe not refl·rred t.o the Knlichoft' Hock (twenty :feet out of water, with adjacent reefs) as requiring· arg·nment against its claims for a light.hom;p Ritt~ in prPfPreuce to Vit.skari, hecause I consider the Vitskari the more dangerous locality, and on that side of the sound which vessels would prefer to work in, as the southern and eastern shores of tht' sound are broken up by inrmmeralJle islets and rockR. Ju addition to lights it may be necessar;.· to add lmo;vs upon the edges of the Vitskari and Knlidwff rePfS, but this will requhe a detailed examination to dcterminf' the necessity, and wbetlter lmuys cau he rmcl1ored here. On Ua· e1lge of tlu1 reef fnrmi11g the we11t sirle of tl1e entrance to the we;;;tern chanuel .l recommend a lmo;\-, or the building of a beacon (stone) on the onfor extremity of the pitrt uncovering at low water. The whole extent of this ledge is about one-quarter of a mile northwPst and southeast, and one-eighth of a mile wide. Upon the rock iu mid-channel north-northwest of the west ernl of .Ja1lonski Island, and northeast one-half east from the west end of Batter';)~ Island, uncovering at half tides, I would propm;e tl1at a heacon of dark stone be built. This would save the expernse of replacing aml repairing buoys, and be a much better and mort> readily recognized mark in thick weather. 1 think it should have a base of about twent:> foet diameter, and rise in the form of a frustum of a cone to twenty feet ele,·ation. Upon the rock in the channel abreast the western part of the Indian Yillage, I recommend that a mooring buoy be affixed. The rock is marked as out of water 011 the British Admiralty chart 2348, but it is cornred at high and ordinary low waters. At the entrance to the middle channel lies the Polivnoi Rock, about four feet above high water, with a passage of deep water on either side. Tu the east-Orn channel are several sunken rocks. Simpson Rock, with two and three-quarter fathoms, one quarter of a mile south by -west from the e111l of (~uitoway Island 1 and over half a mile from Pig Rock, with the main channel between them, and ten fathoms close to it. About five-eighths of a mile northwest hy west from Simpson Rock lies the Tzaritza Rock, with one fathom of water, and upon which the sea sometimes breaks; it 11as ten fathoms c1otie to it. This rock hears nortlnve::<t tl1rec-quarters, distant one-half mile from the northwest poiut of Oshipki Island, with a deep chanud between them. The Zenohia Rock, reported to have from Pight to fifteen feet water upon it at low water, is laid down b;y one of the captains of the Hussian-American Compau;r to the eastwanl of tbe line joining l,ig Hock and Kulichoff Rock, and reports it as a bayonet rock. On the English chart 23;)7, it is placed half a mile west of the above JlOflition. Another navigator of the Russian-American Compauy could 11ot find this sharp rock, but fi:mnd one having a flat top in a slightly different localit;y. The position of tliis rock can only be found and deterrninPd in good smooth weathPr, either b~· sweeping or watching for eddies around it. There is a depth of ten to seventeen fathoms c1011e alongside. From the south side of Dolgoi Tslanrl it bearfl 011e-11uarter south (compass) and distant nearly a mile from the west end of the island. It wi1l he nt>eessary to make a detailed examination of this locality for the poi:;ition of a buoy. If a complete system of lights was warranted hy the commercial importa11ce of this sound, it would be necessary to locate a light npon Cape Edgecumbe, and another on Biorka Island in addition to the fonigoing; but nuder present circumstances I think the inner lights and aids to navigation are sufficient and first needed. If only one were to be locat~d I would recommend the Vitskari rock as the best position. ThP geograpliical 11ositio11 of the Coast Survey station at Sitka is latitude 570 02' 52", longitude 135° l71 0il", and the obserred magnetic variatiou, August 71 1867, was 280 50'.8 east.

rocks. The officer,3 of the H.trnsian-American C1)mpany inform me that a very heavy disagreeable swell roU;,; into this auchorage from the open bay of Chinyak. The two entrances to St. Paul Harbor generally adopted are designated the northern, round the north end of Wooded Island, and tlm soutllern, round the south end of the same island. Both ends of this island have extensive reefs oil" them. "\Vooded Island is somewl1at the form of a lozenge, being two and a half miles long, northnortllwest and south-soutl1east, and one aud a half mile across. Its surface is undulating,, and diversified by open spaces covered with herbage and mas8PS of timber aml shrubbery, giving it a pleasant appearance from sea. The shore8 are generally bold, rocky bluffs, that attain on the outer face an elevation of about one lrnndrcd feet. The island in the highest part may be about two hundred and fifty feet alJOYP the sea. To the eastward and seaward of it, and separated b;r a channel one mile wide, lies Long or Bare Island, which is nearly four milf's loug, north-northeast and south-southwest, ayeragfog a mile iu width, with alternate ]ow aud bold shorel' that rise to two hundred foet, the surface rolling, aud varied hy herbage and a few scattt>riug patche8 of trees. It has extensive recfa off it8 north aud south points, and the channel het,veen it and \V ooded lsland has not l.Jeen sonlJ(lecl out, but is said to afford deep water. Its Horthern extremity lie8 four and a half miles east of "\Vhite Spruce Cape, and has a trident shape. On the west 8ide, and one mile within the northwest point, is the opeuiug to an extensive laud-locked liarbor with from three to ten fathoms water. It iR about three-quarters of a mile long and one-quarter of a mile broad. Here tlie Iiu,,sian-American Company at one time had a small settlement, and a place for making bricks, abandoned on account of the inferior character of the bricks. The north point of the islaud is about two b uudred or two hundred and fifty feet high, with bold, roek;r shores; the smf'ace rolling aud coYered with herbage. We pas:,;ed' close to it when entering St. Paul by the sout11 channel, and I hall a fair chance to judge of its aYailability and importarwe as a position for a light-house. "\Ve left by the north channel, close around "\Vhite Spruce Cape, aml con firmed our first impressions. It would be seen hy veRsels coming out of Narrow Strait to the -..rest-northwest, aml from Marmot Bay, when clear of 8pru ce Island. A reef with a small i8let makPs off three-quarters of a mile from tlie J>Oint, wl1ile a reef and islet lie half a mile southeast from the south end. Both channels have dangers in their approaches; tlie northern channel lias a sunken ledge called " Williams Hauk," lying three miles north of the north end of Long Island. It has deep water arouud it. U p011 it were formerly two lmo;ys, Tell am] hhrn. Tlie llearings I obtained upon the breaker on this bank, from my station on Near Island, place it half a mile nem·er tut~ northwest point of Long· Island than it is laid down on tlie charts; and from tliat station, recommended as a second ligbt-l10use 1o1ite, it hears north 44° 12' east (<'om pass.) Between it and the reef off the north west poiut lies a sunken, sharp, isolated rock, not 011 an.r map, and 11aving hut ten feet of water upon it at low water, with veQ- deep wateT around it, and no breaker seen upon it. 01rn of the 1::-ussiau. American Compau:r's yessels, the Kadiak, struck upon it iu April, l~fj(); her bottom pierced, when she filled and was lost. Its position was afterward8 determined, the locality having lJeen found by watchiugtbe swirling of the cunents. lt is two miles nortb-northwest from the nortlnnst pofot of Long lsland, and with 'Yilliams and the reef off the point, lies on the prolongation of the shore of' the west side of tJ1e island. One mile north-northeast from White Spruce Cape is a rook and reef. In the southern approaches lie8 a single rnck, called the Humpback, eight(·e.n feet above water, having bold water arouutl it, and bearing south 63° east, three miles from the south point of" Long Island. Ot.l1er dangers near the entrances of the harbor are exhibited in tl1e al·t:ompau;ring sketch. To aYoid these innel' dangers, and also to give a ves8el's position by cross-lwarings upon two ol~jt·cts to avoid 'Villiams Bauk and the llumplJack, I would recommend a harbor light to be located upon the high ridge at tlrn northern end of Rocky Island, abreast of the town. .From my station, about one LurulrNl and fifteen feet ahove the sea, I saw the 1lat-topped islets off Chiu,vak Point, about one lmudred and twenty feet high, over 1,he south eud of Wooded Island; um not certain that I sitw the Humpback, but foel sure that a slight elevation of the light would be seen from a vessel's deck nea.r the rock, o\·er the bluff, south point of Wooded Island. The light would be seen up to the anchorage off tlie ie.e company's wharf by hoth channels, and also for the whole bay of" Chinyak and the channel to the south and east. The reefs in the entrance tu the channels to the southeastwa,rd of Near Island have gene1-ally

some large rock showing aboYe water; but a buoy would be needed on the north end of the reef, making near]~· half a mile northward from the extremity of Toposkoff lslE't, with 8e\Teu fathoms water close to its extremity. A buoy should also mark the extremit,Y of the reef making north from the nurt11 point of Xear J,.;land, and l'orming one Ride of thl' entnmce to the narrow harbor of St. Paul. A shoal spot of Tock, coYered with haruacle,.;, and showing· whit£', (locally attrilmkd to chalk,) with nine feet of water on it at low water, is laid down h~- the rnn-ig-atorR of the Bnsi'lia11America11 Company one-half a mile south by eaBt from the sonth pllint of \\.oode<l IRlarnl, and onehalf of a mile soutlrnTest three-quarterB west from the inner Hnmpliac·k rocl.:, I~·ing· off the n·ef :lt the south end of \YoodPd Island. About halfway betwel'JJ thiH im1er Humpback aucl t11e sontl1 eud of Long Island, on a line of deep souudings, lies a rock with four feet, but it will alwa:rn be avoided by kee}Jing outside that liue. There is no doubt but that the a1lproaches and entrances to this harbor need extensive aml 1lPtailed examination. The two lights recornmencled arc amply sufficient to mark the ap11roaclws antl entrauce to tht· harbor, howf'\·er important it might become. Should only one be lmilt, I recornmeud that upon Bare or Long lslan<l. The materials for the light 011 l~ong Island could llC Yery safely landed in the land-locked bay on the west side of the island, aml thence transported to the Bite, about one mile distant. Upon Near Island a roadwa~- would lun-e to be made along the steep sides of the island for carrying up stone and materials; probahl:-- the stone composing the islanll might be mlaptetl fur lmillling purposes; it crops out at the summit of the island. Stone for buildings is found in the harbor of St. Paul; it consists of a hig·lily metamorphic sandston(>o; in some places very much shattered into fragments too small for U8C; in other plae.es it can be found iu an1ilable quantity. The gp.ncral character of tile stone in this ,·icinity is slate. I know of no limestone here for the makinµ: of lime. Ver;y respectfully and truly yours, GEOHGE DAYIDSO~,

Ulakltt<i- Harbor, U1wln.ska Bay, Sc11te111ber 12, 1867. In acconlauce with your instruct.ions T make the following report upon the aids to navigation necessary to Unalaska Bay in Unalaska Island, one of the g1·oup of .Fox Islands of the Aleutian chain. Unalaska Bay lies on the north side of Unalaska Island, which has a length of nearly sixtyfive miles southwest by west and northeast h~' e::ist, (compass,) and an ayerage width of fift-een miles. Cape Kalekhta, the eastern point of the entrance to the ba,y, Jilis about ten miles ''rnstsouthwp,st from the middle of Akutan Strait, lying hflt,weeu the Ishmd of Akutan on the northeast and Unalga Island on the southwest, and connecting the Pacific ocean with the Behring Sea. The middle of the passage, which is three miles wide, lies in latitude 5-10 and longitude 16fP, both approximate. Cape Kalekhta is a rocky precipitous headland, rising to an eleYation of about fifteen hundred foet, and well marked when seen from the strait b;\' a high pinnacle rock close to its base, while about half a mile outside of it lies a rocky ledge not laid llown on the charts. The we.stern head is high, bold, and forms a long, curving shore line for two or three miles. It is called Cape Cheerful, and, upon approa~hing it from the northward and eastm1nl, is readily recognized by a large cascade of one hundred and fifty feet high plunging directly into the sea from the base of an extinct volcano about twenty-five hundred foet high; from Cape Kalekhta it bears west.southwest about eight and a half miles.
DEAR SIR:

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Tlw gPIIPl'al tlin'<·tinu nf' the hay is about south-snuUiwest for eleven miles, contracting to a small harbor called Captain's Harbor. The bay, about half way inside the entrance, is divided by a bold, high islarnl callNl Amokuak, rising precipitous!;\- tc1 au devation of eighteen huudred feet, and stretching sonthwaTd with decreasiug elenition to Captain's Harl.or, so m:; to form Illoolook Harbor ou its pastl'rn l'ide, eight miles inside Kalekhta Cape. From the northeast point of this ii;laud a loug, 1iarrO\Y, low howlder tm1g11c, covered with coarse herbage, makes out awl stretches son th wanl for one and a half milt", am1 ahont one-half mile from the island, forming anothei'· fine }and-locked harbor, called lllakhta Bay, ha Ying from fifteen to twenty fathoms of water throughout. :N"Par the t·xtremit.r of thi8 tongne is a half-finished house. On the extremity was establislled the secmHLtry mltronomical station of the Coast Survey, where Sub-Assistant ~Iosman obtained g;oo<l obserY:ttions f(ir latitmli>, 1011git mfo, aml magnetic declination. Between this to11gue am1 the easter11 shore, wliiel1 i:s twenty-one hundred foet hig·h and precipitous, lies the entrance to llloolook Harl.Jor, 01w mile wide, with a depth of water from twents· to se>en fathoms, over irregular bottom. The rock laid down on some maps near!:-.- in mid-channel is really quite close to the eastern shore. 'J'he Yillage of Illoolook lil'S at the head of the harbor, about eight miles from Kalekhta Cape, and two awl a half mile;.; from Atrwknak HPatl, arnl faces the Behring Sea. At, this village I established a tidal station, at which .l\Ir. S. Forney, aid, erected a box-gauge, as will be detailed in my 1'4'port. Tho location for a lig'l1t-ltouse for llloolook Harbor proper would be on the bluff, about one mile north of tlie dllage, and three-<1nart(,rs of a mile south of our observatory, on a prolongation of rlakhta T1111g·1ie; but it affords a n'ry limited are of visibility, am1, on account of the extent of thP harbor and bay, and their fn~edom from hidden dang;ers, I uo not deem it advisable to locate a light so far inside, bnt would recommend the adoption of a. point on the outer face of the precipitous bead of Arnoknak, as marked iu the accompanying sketch. AtlPr pnttiug up the signah; for the local survey of Illoolook, and examining around the base of this cliff for 1ight.]wust' purposes, I was taken ill and confined to my berth so that I coulcl not exteml the ex:ftrniuatiou, hut eon firmed my judgment when leaving the bay on the steamer. On the outer face of this head the light would lrn,ve au <trc ofdsibility extending from north 70° west (compass,) tangent to Cape Cheerful, round by the north to north 24° east, tangent to Cape Kalekhta. ln this situation it would possess the advantage of guiding a vessel into Capt.ain's Harbor, on the west si<le of Amoknak ll'lland, and would be seen after pa8sing seYen or eight miles westward through Akutan Strait. A position would have to be selected about one hundred or one hundred and fifty feet above the w11t.er, where t,he wall-like diff begins to slope inward, and possibly a cutting made to give Rpace for the base of tbe tower, wbich should be painted white, as it would he 1m·~jectcd against the dark, rocky mass behind it. To reach the position that would open Cape Cheerful, a road way wonld have to be made for about hi11f a mile from the lowland at the head of Ulakhta Bay, where a Y("Ssel can anchor in ten fathoms, rocky bottom, close to shore. The dwelling could he located here, where some of the Aleutians ha"·e small patches of garden for raisi11g turnips, potatoes, cabbage, &c. The geographical position of the site for the light-honse, clerlucecl from our observations on Ulakhta. Tongue, is latitude 530 55' :>811 , longitude 1660 27' 44", and the magnetic variation September 10, 1867, wits 190 47'.4 cast. This hay may become an important point for the curing of the cotlfish caught on the hank we discoYered in this Yicinity. It is sometimes visited by whalers, hut no supplies are at present ob· tainablc to iudnce their Yi sits. Upon our coming out of this bay and passing eastward through the narrow strait of Uualga~ lying between the small iisland of Unalga and Unalaska, we counted ten sperm whales within an hour. Upon our ent{lring, a week previous, we saw nearly as many to the east-Rontbeast of the straits. In my report will be, found a more particular description of these straits, accompanied by a view takeu of them from the sonthPastward. Very respectfully and truly yours,

me as geologist of the recent expedition to A1ask(t. I regret UuLt it iR uot more complete, but must plead as an excuse the hurriedness of our trip, few opportuuities for exploration, and the short time allowed for its !)reparation.

GENERAL TOPOGRAPHICAL AND GEOLOGIGA L FEATt:RES OF THE NORTHWESTERN COAST OF A)IERICA, FROl\I Tiffi STRAITS OF JUAN DE FUCA TO THE PARALLEL 01'' 1->IXTY DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE.

By a glance at the charts of the northwe8tern coast of America it will be Reen that the entire coast between the straits of Fuca and about the sixtieth parallel is cut up into a Yast archipelago of island:;;, between which are narrow and intricate channels, abounding in good anchorages, aud affording peculiar facilities for inland navigation. The shores of the mainland are deeply indented with long and narrow inlets, bordered by high and abrupt mountains, generally wooded from near their summits down nearly to the water's edge, presenting natural views of the wildest anu most impressiYe character. Of the islands, the largest and most important is Vancouyer. Further north is t11e large and outlying island of Queen Charlotte. The city of Victoria is situated upon the southeastern extremity of the former, at the head of a narrow inlet from th<' straits of Fuca. The land on the western and northern coast of Vancouver Isla ml is high au(l mounta.inons, while on the southeastern shore, particularly in the neighborhood of Victoria, it presents a gently undulating surface of large extent. The southern shore of the Straits of Fuca is very bold, being bordered })y the Ol;rmpic range of Snowy Mountains, in Washington Territory, the peaks of which attain an altitude of seyen thousand eight hundred feet above the sea. The shores of Vancouver in the vicinity of Victoria are rocky but rarely high. The prevailing rock is highly crystalline, granitic in appearance, but consists of feldspar and foiiate(l hornblende or pyroxene, and is probably igneous in its origin. It is well exposed along tl1e shores of the har. bor and on the summits of the hills back and to the east of the city. The most prominent geological feature is the grooved, scooped, and rounded surfa.ces of this rock; no angular summits or pieces in. situ are to be found ; the rocks everywhere present the same rounded summits and smooth s11rfaces. Perhaps the most striking example of this is to be seen in the small, barren, rocky island off the southeastern extremity of Vancouver, known as Trial Island, which we passed in approaching Victoria upon the retnm of the expeditiou. I measured the direction of several of the grooves aloag the shore ea.st of the Hudson Bay Company's store, and found that it was quite uniform, not varying much from north 100 west. In some places they are a foot or more in width and of equa.l or greater depth. In the outskirts of the city, between it and Beacon Hill, at the head of the small inlet which forms the harbor, isquite a large area of level a1luvial land. A ditch or drain recently dug through this for a considerable distance, the bottom of which I should estimate to be at lea.st twenty feet above high water, has exposed an ancient sea beach. The marine shells whieh occur there are a.II of existing species. The existence of this bea.eh proves a comparatively recent upheaval an<l its deposition subsequent to the ex:tensive denudation and erosion caused by glacial action on the underlying rockH. 36

REPORT 01<' THE SUPERINTENDENT OP

The eastern coast of Vaneouver, as well as the shores of the Rmall islands to the eastward, are friuged witl1 rernmt deiJOsits, horizontally stratified, son and friable. Upon these tlw sea is constantly eneroaehi11g, as shown by the piles of debris under the steep banks, which are generally not onr fifty feet in height. Erratic boulders of rock, the material of which is foreign to their pn~sent position, are of frequent occurrence. On the left shore of Aetive Pass, going north, is one which contaius, by estimate, at least eighty cnbic yanls of stone. SEwenty miles llista.nt from Victoria, on the eastern side of Vancom-er Islauu, extensive deposits of coal occur, known as the .Nauaimo J\Iines. The;;e mines were opened in the year 1852 by tlte Hudson Bay Company, hut have since pa8se<l into the lrnnds of other p:trties. Thf' total shipments of coal from them from the year 1852 to the present ti1m~ probably exeeed two hundred thousand tons, and, according to l\factie,* amountell at the .end of the year 1861 to one hundred aIHl twenty-three thousand nine hundred and tl1irt.een torn;. Thti coa.1 is higltl_y bihnuinous, well suited for family use and steaming purposes. The beds are known to belong to the cretaceous period, and are much upheaved and faulted, rendering their exploration difticult and expensive. The cutl is furnished on the wharf at Nauaimo at six dollars (gold) per ton.t The followiug is a statement of analyses showing the composition of this as compared with the other coals of the Pacific Coast, given by .r.

The mines known as the Bellingham Bay coal mines are located in vYashingt-011 Territory very nearly opposite those of Nauaimo, and are probably of the same geological age. Entering the Gulf of Georgia, which for a consideuhle distance separates Vancouver falau<l from the main land by the Active Pass, we cross the forty-ninth parallel or northern boundary of Washington Tel'I'itory; but a few miles north of this line is the moutll of Frazer River, upon the head.wate:rs of which, in Brithih Columbia, are the gold mines that causeu in Uie year 1858 tlie great gold excitement in Oalifnmia. This river rises in ahout fJ50 north latitude and 122° west longitude, and running in a southerly direction for four hundred miles in the valley between the Rocky Mountains and tile prolongation of the Cascade range, breaks through the latter at ahout 50°, and, fl.owing through a comparatively broad alluvial valley in a westerly direction, empties into the Gulf of Georgia. I have been unable to ascertain the total amount of gold shipments made by Wells, Fargo & Compan,y from Victoria, which would give an a1)proximate idea of the yield of these mines; but those from the year of discove~T' 1858, to the year 1861, inclusive, amounted to $3,750,111 30.t Howe Sound, a few miles above the mouth of Frazer River, is the first of a series of long, narrow, and deep inlets, bordered by high and rugged mountains, with which the whole coast of British Columbia and that of the southern part of the new Territory of Ala.aka are deeply indented. -------------------·-------------------------------"Vanoonver Island and British Columbia, by Matthew Macfie, P.·R. ·G.

At the head of the Gulf of Georgia, v~rncouyer Island approaches nearer the main land, aIHl is separated from it and the adjoining i.slands, first, u.r Disc<ffery Passage, and aftenranl:s by Johrnstoue Straits, 'Which end near Queen Charlotte Sound, north of Vancouver. The land bordering these channel" is high, particularly 011 tlie southern shore of Johnstone Straits, where it Yaries from one to five thousand feet in eleYation, J\fouut Palmerston being the highest summit, (five thousand feet.) A few miles lmlow :Fort I~u1}ert, four beds of good cmtl am saill to cexist, aucl m1 the ornmsite side of the island, in (.),uatsino Son11d, (isometimes spelled Koiskeemo,) fh'c lJeds, Yaryiug from three to six feet in thickness, an· reported to lmye been found. The inlets which occur at the head of the Gulf of G,eorgia, northeast of Yancouver Island, are worthy of special remark. They are from forty to sixty mile,; in length, from one to two miles only in lJre~ulth, awl are walled with abrupt mountairns from four to eight thousand feet ht height, the highest being Superb l\Iountaiu, (eight thousand feet,) at the head of llntte llllet. According to the accurate charts of Captaiu llichards, royal na,·y, thne are places irr tLese fiords, within one-half mile or less of shore, where 110 bottom was found at tllree hundred fathoms. Goirrg through the narrow channel, ea st of Hope Ts1aml, we crossed Queen Charlotte, and entered Fitzhugh Sound and FiRher's Channel, near the head of which iR the Jndiaa town of Bellabella. At this place the rocks are metamorphic, as shown by the regularly stratified slates oecurrirrg there. About twenty-five miles northeast from the entrance to :Milbank Sound is a high J\'ITami!lal mountain, estimated at three thousand feet in elevation, wooded to the summit, with the exception of a white streak some three hundreu feet broad at its base, and exteuding from the bottom to within perhaps three hundred foet of the summit. This is prohab]y the scar of an avalane11e that has laid bare the rocks tlu1t h1wc been afterwards stained white "·ith the wash from decaying yegtablc matter, though its appearance at first suggested a limestone formation. The mountain masses around Carter Bay are apparently made up of a hard and highl,y quartz08e granite. The scenery in the mtrrow channel going north from Carter Bay is 1ery remarkable. Huge granitic mountains rise·o11 either side to hr,ights e:>it,imated from twenty-five hnndretl to three thousand feet; ir1 urnny p1aces bare rocky surfaces are exposed, but in general they are densely wooded with evergreen trees nearly to their summits, on which, and in the shatled ravines on their northeru slo1ws, lie patches of snow. The winter accumulations of snow on these mountains must be very great, for their sides are furrowed with cl1aunels 1n·uthmed by running water, and scarred by aYa1anches or snow slides, which have cut huge swaths in the thick timber. Another prominent feature in this channel is the great number of cascades to be seen in passing; th.e larger and more imposing ones are the outflows of lakes situated high in the mountains, and but a short distance from the channel itself. At Lawson Bay, opposite the mouth of Skeena River, the rocks are metamorphic slates, sandstones, and shales, trending northwest and southeast; some small barren quartz veins accompany the slates. Fort Simpson, an important trading post of the Hnrlson Bay Company, is situated on the northern J>art of Ohemsian Island, at the head of Chatham Sound, within a shor.t distance of the southen1 limit of the new Territory of Alaska. 'l'he islands in the immediate neighborhood t.o the southwest are comparatively low, though to the north au:d northwest high snow-capped mountains are to he seen. The rocks in the vicinity of the fort are regularly stratified mica schists, generally garnetiferous, and sometimes pyritiferous ; these pass into gneiss and gmnite. Their trend, as examined along the shore near the fort, is nearly northwest and southeast, (mag.,) and their dip is thirty degrees to the northeast. The schists are seamed wi£h numerous intercalated quartz veins, in some instances highly charged with iron pyrites. According to the factor of the Hudson Bay Company at this post gold is to he found by panning almost anywhere in the vicinity; repeated trials which I made at tlifferent points, particularly in the bed of a small stream two miles· northeast from the furt, failed to establish the correctness of bis assertion.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

On the Stachin Hiver, one hundred and fifty miles north of Fort Simpson, which for the last thirty miles of its course flows through our Territory, deposits of auriferous grayel have been worked for several years. The principal mining camp is at Slmkesville, in British Columbia, on the river, one hundred and fifty miles from its mouth. The gold is generally fine and smooth; the yield has been from two to eight dollars per day to the man, working in the simplest way with a rocker. Owing to the rigorous winter climate, depth of snow, and necessity of transporting provisions from the mouth of the river in the winter months, to afford subsistence during the spring and summer, the mining season is necessarily short. .According to information received from a Mr. Sargent, at Sitka, and fully corroborated by other intelligent parties, a remarkable canon exists on the Stachin River, commencing a short <listanoo above Shakesville, and extending for fifty miles further back into the interior, at places two hundred feet and over in depth, and varying from seven to forty feet in width at top, though the channel through which the river :flows is wider. , According to information received from differei1t miners, who have spent many years on the Stachin, the timber in the interior is superior to that along the coast. On the east side of Mangel Island, near the telegraph company's station, the rocks are regularly stratified, and consist of clay slates and a micaceons sandstone. .A miner, recently from Shakesville, states that three miles above the town, on the river, is a vein or bed of good anthracite coal ; this lacks confirmation. On the islands north of the mouth of the Stachin River, and east of Sitka Island, are considerable areas of level alluvial land, particularly at the head of Mangel Straits, the narrow and intricate channel through which we passed en route for the Stacbin R.iver.
SITKA AND .ADJOINING ISLA.."rrlS.

Sitka, or Baranoff Island, lies between the parallels of 56° 10' and 570 38' north latitude, and the meridians of 134° 20' and 1250 26' west longitude. The town of the same name, at present the most populous in the Territory, is situated about midway on the western coast at the head of Sitka Ra:1·. On the northwest side of this bay, and l,ying between Sitka Island and the ocean, is Edgecumbe Island. The volcano of Edgecumbe, which forms a prominent lamlmark for navigators in entering the Bay of Sitka, rises from the broad and gentle slope terminating in Ca1>e Edgecnmbe, on the southern part of the island. Between the islands of Edgecumbe and Sitka are the smaller islands of Krefstoffsky and the more northerly one, Portowtscbikof. West of the town of Sitka, at the head of the bay, is an archipelago of small islands that forms an effectual barrier against the sea, but through which the approach is somewhat difficult. The island itself is very mountainous. The summits have a. peculiarly sharp and jagged appearance. Snow and ico--glaciers of limited extent-are to be seen on the flanks of the mountains in various directions. For an , elevation of at least two thousand feet the island is covered with a dense growth of evergreen trees, the principal varieties of which are the Sitka spruce, giant arbor-vitre, and the hemlock. Immediately behind the town, on the east side of a small stream called Indian River, Verstova Mountain, a sharp angular peak, rises to the height~ trigonometrica.lly determined, of three thousand three hundred and seventy-four feet. This, Grewingk, in his book on the northwest coast of .America, incorrectly states to be the highest mountain on Sitka Island, which is one nmss of rugged mountains, many of which are capped with eternal snow. The character of the shore line is but a reproduction on a smaller scale of that of the northwest coast already described, beilig very much cut up by narrow inlets and deep bays. I made, during our stay at Sitka and its vi:cinity, several excursions to various points, embracing a range of coast from twenty miles north to twelve miles southwest of the town. The rocks upon which the town of Sitka is built consist ofa hard conglomerate or grit, sometimes coarse, but generally fine, often passing into argillite; this formation extends from the Deep S a, twelve miles south west from Sitka, of which I shall speak more in detail, to the northern end

of Portowtschikof, and, according to Hrewingk, oyer the nortliern end of Edgecnmbe Island; the islarul of Krefstotfsky, as well as the smaller islands west of Sitka, beiug composed of rocks of the same general character. Grcwingk'" states (p. !W) that "the Russian engineer Doroschin found in Naquashinski Bay, opposit.e the island of Krefstoflsky, limestone, also silver and iron ores in remarkable quantities; more accurate information in regard to this is wanting." I visited the limestone locality, v.-hich proved to be in Naquashinski. Bay, opposite to the northeastern end of the larger island, (which, as far as I could learn, had no name,) east of Krefstoffsky, and separated from it by Olga 8traits. No silver or iron ores were found b~- me, and I doubt their existence in that locality. According to Dr. Tilling, a geutlernau of high culture and of scientific attaimuents, large deposits of magnetic iron ore occur on the coast of Bdgecumbe, opposite the island of Krefstoff::>ky; owing to an error in pointing out on the c1iart the exact position of the locality, mistakiug the island Portowtscliikoff for Krcfstoffsky, it was not found, thougll some time was spent in se~trching for it. He afterwards corrected the error ; l>ut circumstances were such as to prevent further exploration, and the report was not Yerified. About ten miles southwest of Sitka is what is known as the Deep Sea, a long aud narrow fresh-water Jake, ten miles in length and rarely over three-quarters of a mile in breadth. This deep lake trends northea.st and southwest; is nine feet aboYe tide-water, with which it is oonnected through a break in the mountains on the northwest side about midway of its leugth. It discharges its surplus water into Oyerskoi Bay, an inlet making into the southeast from Sitka Bay, at the head of which is located the fishing station called the Redoubt. Thr, lake hi bordered h~y high and precipitous mountains, Y<tr~ing by estimation from fifteen hundred to three thousand feet in height; the summits on the northeast side are generally sliarp, while those opposite are rounded. Abrupt and nearly >ertical cli:ft's of sienitic granite are to be seen near the head of the lake on the southeastern side. At its head is a narrow valle.r covered with a thick growth of alders and wooded with heavy timber. The view of the snow-capped and ice covered mountains beyond, once the foreground of autumnal tinted foliage, and through the tops of the lofty evergreen trees, is very remarkable for its extreme beauty. I have no doubt as to tile existence of an extensive glacier on its tlauk, though the limited time at my command did not admit of my continuing on n1> the valley. The reconnaissance of the shores ,\·hieh I made, shows that the rock on the southeastern side is sienitic granite, while that on the northwestern is a grit similar to that at. Sitka. The line of separation seems to cross the lake ohliquel.r; at least within oue mile of the northeastern end sienitie granite is to be found on both sides. The origin of this deep lake is to be ascribed to glacial action; it may lmve formerly existed as an inlet from the ocean, and by uphea.val became a fresh-water lake, a supJ)Osition not at all unlikely, for traces of volcanic action still exist on the narrow strip of land which separn.tes its sonthern end from the ocean, in the hot sulphur springs occurring there. The incrnstatiou deposited by these waters consists maiuly of sulphur. While exploring along the course of a small stream which empties into St. John Bay, north of Sitka, in the granite detritus, along its banks I found pieces of coal; these were largely intermixed with rock, to which their preservation was undoubtedly due. In company with Mr. Harford, the conchologist of the expedition, a more extended exploration was made. Owing to the great difficulty of the traveling and unfavorable weather, we were unable to pursue investigations for a greater distance t.han seven miles from the mouth of the stream. It was our intention to camp for the night and explore the branches of the creek, but the impossibility of starting a fire in the drenching rain, everything being perfectly saturated with wat.er, and our own condition from constant wading in the stream, by which alone we had been able to peuetrat;e as far as we did., rendered this impossible, and we were compelled to retrace our steps to our camp on the bay.

REI'ORT OF THE suPgRINTl.;NDENT OF

The ge11era l eourse of the stream is east and west; its rise for the first four or five milt·s is not very rapid; along its hanks are small areas of fiat a1luvial laud, particularly near its mouth. The ebarrnel often seimrates into two or three, inelosing small islands 011 the level bottom land. The rocks in situ are rarely exposed, but at two points on the stream fine black shales and soft friable sau<lstoue:-i, \Yithout fossils, however, were seen trending approximately northeast aud southwest, and i1icliued at a high angle. Piccctl of eoal, much intermixed with foreign substances, princii1ally limestone of grertter or less size, were found along· the course of the stream for a distance of ,four miles. Highly crystalline limestone, white, streaked with gray, was also found in the df.l'tritus. The uense growth· of t,im her, tbiek masses of' fallen and decaying trees, covered witl1 dee11 n;oss, thickets of the thmny shrub, Pana.x: ltonida, and the general mountainous chara-0ter of this loca.,._., will 1·cudcr its future exploration exceedingly difficult. On examination the coal found proves t-0 be bituminous, hut the bell or beds from which it was broken will, if discovered, aftord coal of vast.Iy superior quality to any heretofore known to exist in the Territory. The eastern coast of Sitka Island presents m1 almos1, unbroken front, of 81low-covl>red mountains, showing a marked climatic difference from that of the western, the climai·e of which is of course modified by its proximity to the opeu sea, and probably by a warm current setting from the Asiatic Coast, aualogons to the Gulf Stream of the Atlantic. Tlie only opportunity of examiniug the rocks ou the eastern side w::is at Schelich Bay, on the northeasti>,rn extremity of the island, where the rock is sienite and, I judge, metamorphic. I l1ad uo opportunity of visiting the extinct volcano of Edgecuml1e, lmt during our stay at Sitka had se\'eml fiue -dews of it. It is a very symmetrical volcanic cone, two thousand eight hundred foet iu height. Its angle of slope is about twenty-five degrees. According to Lisiausk~y the crater is three miles in circumference, and its depth two hundred :w<l eighty foet, which Grewingk remarks is twice as large as that of Stromboli. There is lmt little vegetation on its steep slope, though it is well-wooded flt its base. Grewingk states that the \vestern coast is composed principally of basaltic Java, while on the eastern shorn the rocks are found to be a porous andesite or feldspathi.c lava, and a mixture of glassy feldspar with pitchstone, when compact resembling porphyry. Accounts as to its activity in former times difter. Lisiansky was on the summit in 1804 and foull(l no evidenc{ls of recent volcanic action. A.long the shores of Barlow Bay, at the northern extremity of .A_dmiralty Island, 011 the east side of Chatham Straits, are numerous quartz Yeins. Our time there being very short and the we:tther exceedingly inclement, I was enabled to Yisit but one of them, which is exposed in the high rock~· bluff on the westeru side of the bay. Hs course is the same as that of the regularly stratified, fine-grained miea schists which inclose it, viz., northwest and southeast, magnetic dip vertical. The only metalliferous ingredient which I found was iron pyrit:es. The Iudian settlement Chilkaht is located at the head of Lynn Channel, on the eastern side of the western bay, the l1ead of the inlet being divided into two bays by a peninsula p1·ojecting to the southward. Our time at this locality was very short, but particularly interesting on account of au opportunity of visiting the extensive and beautiful glacier which isf'lues from a narrow gorge on the west side of the channel, nine or ten miles south of Chilkaht. A.fter leaving the mYine it spreads itself into a vast fan-shape<l mass from two to three miles broad. At its base is a low :llat a quarter of a mile in breadth, ma.de from the wash from the de1iosits at the foot of the glacier, which are composed of fragments, sometimes of great size, of slate, sienitic granite, and a finely cr~·stalline, beautiful white marble. Two moraines a,re t-0 he seen on its northern slope, showing it to be made up by the con:tlucnce of at least three, and perhaps four, smaller ones. Its angle of inclination, determined from calculations on observations made by yourself, from where it issues from the radue to its base, is 40 23', the distance being three-quarters of a mile. On tlie east side of Lynn Channel, stretcl1ing for twenty miles along the shore, is a lofty range of snow-covered and sharp-pointed mountains, in which every marked depression has its glooier of greater or less extent.

KAlHAK, AND AD.TOINING
ISLAND~.

Tlw islam1 of Kadiak 1ie8 east of the peninsula of Alaska, between the parallels of 560 45' anil 530, and is separated from it by Chelekoff Straits. The settlt-ment of St. Paul is on the northeast coast of the islaud. Tlie genPral appearam·e of the country is Rtrikingly different f'mm that of the coast uorth and i'ionth of Sitka. Though the i8land is generally mountainous, the valle;vs are broader than on the islan<l of Sitka. The growth of trees (Sitka spruce) is appanmtl;-,~ confined to within uarTow limits, 11one hPing noticed at a greater elevation than from three to four hunclred feet, and Uiese being in groups aIHl clusters, not covering the entire face of the country as at Sitka. In the Yicinity of the settlement of St. Paul, and along the shores to the north of it, the rocks are metamorphic, shales and sandstones trending twenty-three degrees to the west of nortl1, (true.) The finely-comminuted shales giye to the beaches in the vicinity a peculiar}.'- black appearance. The sandstone, which is hard and durahfo, is much shattered, though pieces 011c culJic foot in size, for building purposes, may reatlily be obtained. A mile or more north of the town a small quartz Yein, highly charged with iron v:yrites, galena, and blende, is to bl< seen in the bluff along the shore. An assa_'I· of a small sample of this, made at the laboratory of the San Francisco a;;;sa_ying and refining works, l)y :Mr .·John Hcwston, shows it to contain four dollars and some cents iii silYer to the ton, as well as a trace of gold. The small island east of St. Paul, called Doljoi, ahm \Yooded and Spruce falamls, seem to be made up of the same material as that occuITing at St. Paul's. Lines of stratification in tlie mountains back of town, at the lteatl of the bay to the west, are distinctly visible. It iK doubtful if any volcano exists on the islaml of Kadiak; no eyitle11ces of it were seen in passing throug-h the narrow straits to the north of the island. According to Grewingk, gra11hite occurs in smaH veins on the western coast. I was informed by Captain Paul Lemascheffsky, of the Rm;sian-Americ:m Fur Company, that lead ore, probi1bly g~\1ena, occm·s in considerable quantities in Eagak, or Orloffsky Bay, on the east side of Kadiak, latitude 57° 13', and that a good article of roofing slate is to be fouud at the same locality.
ISLAND OF UNA.LASKA.-EXPEIJITION TO AND .A.SCENT OF THE VOLCANO
~AKUSHO<.

The shores of Unalaska, as seen from the Akutan Pass, art' bol<l and rocky; the hills and mountains are covered with grass, but not a tree is to be seen on the island. The eastern shore of Captain's Bay, at the head of which the chief settlement of the island, Illoolook, is situat.ed, is formed of hills varying from one thousand to eighteen hurnli'ed feet in height, t11e mass of which consists of porphyries and volcanic breccia. These rocks are frequently intrsected with narrow trapdikes cutting the,m iu all directions. The town itself is situa,ted on a narrow strip of low laud, formed of volcanic tletritus, between which and the main island a small stream runs and empties into Captain's Ra;y. The few days that were spent by the expedition at Unala.ska were employed in an exploration and ascent of Mount Makushin, an active volcano on the northwest part of tlie island. The party, comi)osed of Dr. Kellogg, botanist of the expedition, Lieutenants Hodgson and Ball, officers of the Li!lcoln, mul myself, started on the morning of the 7th of September, passed through the narrow passage between the long naITow island in Captain's Bay and the main island, the shores of which are entirely composed of volcanic rocks, and landed on the beach at the head of Captain's

Bay.
A valley, at the head of which l\fakushin is locat,ed, some miles in length and at the beach This gradually narrows down to one-half a mile in breadth five miles to the westward1 its course being nearly due east and west. On either side, bigh, steep, and grass-covered hills rise to heights estimated from eight to fifteen hundred foet, the side8 of which are gullied by streams from the patches of melting snow on or near their summits. ·A river one hundred feet wide at its uiouth, and having itR main source in the RnowR an(l

one mile and one-half in width, lay before us.

288

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

glacier of Makushiu, winds through the valley, approaching the northern more than the southern bordering hills, and finall.r :flows into Captain Bay, quite near the southern limit of the valley. Thealluvia,l land is CO\'ered with a luxuriant growtl1 of grass, very dense and often breast high, and although much of it is a marsh, it is probably susceptible of drainage. A small willow shrub co>ers considerable area along the banks of the stream. "\Vc camped for the night on the north side of the va'ley, four miles distant from the_ beach. The morning of the following day we ascended the grassy range of hills north of our camp. ' Opposite tltis point, on the southern side of the valley, is a bold volcanic range, with sharp and angular peaks, rising from a ravine which Hnters the valley from the suutlnvest. Its serrate£l 8mmnit is marked by snow in patches, from which the water flows, marking its flanks with silver threads, which contrast beautifully with the dark frowning crags and bare rocky surfaces. l'assing over a series of slight elevations and depressions, we reached the foot of a bare conical hill, made up of volcanic ashes. The ascent was soon made, and we beheld, for the first time, a panoramic view of the surrounding country and waters: the island, with its deeply indented shores and intricate channels; its complex system of mountain peaks, with here and there a volcanic cone rising in beautiful symmetry and overshadowing the sharp and more angular summits of surrounding hills; the bold and rocky shore line, produced by the action of the water cutting the hills away at their base, causing extensive caviug·s and slidings-an a-Otion greatly assisted by the sharp and frequent shocks of earthquakes which occur here. Another prominent feature is the numerous tntp-dikes which stand out in bold relief, owing to their superior hardness, and stretching out into the water form rocky reefs, on and over which the sea is constantly breaking. To the west, the valley, which had narrowed down at the poiut before mentioned, _lay beneath us. The stream, which had run nearly upon a level with its banks, now tumbled and foamed through deep rocky gorges aud channels which it, with its own power, had cut through the volcanic debris and lava out.flmvs, while further west it s111'eads out into a fan-Jike form and <lrains the vast amphitheater of mountains which flank the grand snow-covered volcauo. A glacier, with imperfectly formed moraines, curves gracefully around a sharp ridge formed by an outflow from the side, which reaches to within, perhaps, one thousand feet of the summit. Descending this small volcanic cone, which by barometrical measurement is nineteen hundred and twenty-seven feet high, and following the summit of thf'. ridge, we gained the side of a rocky spur which juts from the flank of the main mountain, and from thence passed to the deposits of the glacier which have accumulated in enormou8 quantities at its foot. The finer mabwial is constantly being removed by running waters, leaving large angular masses of porous basaltic lava piled in heaps. 'Ve had now gained the lowest limit of the glacier, at an elevation of nineteen hundred and sixty-nine feet. On either side of the glacier vertical walls of lava rise from one to two hundred feet in height, which from a distance resemble huge fortifications. But little difficulty was experienced in traversing the ice, the inclination being small and the crevasses generally narrow. The line of perpetual snow was reached at an elevation of two thousand nine hundred and seventy-nine feet. We camped for the night at an elevation of three thousand two hundred and eighty-seven feet; the thermometer stood at 340 before morning. During the night we heard subterranean noises in the direction of the cratier, and experieneed a 11eav.r gale, which threatened to carry away our tent. To the northwest of our camp, looking across the snow-field and a wild chasm, a bold and rugged wall of lava forms the westiern side of a bay making in from the north. The mist and fog rolling in from the sea made the view rather uncertain, but I am quite confident that a much deeper bay exists to the north of the volcano than is indicated upon the charts. Ou the morning of the 9th, leaving our camp, we started for the summit with a good prospect for a comparatively clear day, but before 9 a. m. we were enveloped in a thick fog, and it was only by the change of slope and sound of running water in the crater that we were made aware of our

final success.
The slope, which to our camp had not exceeded twelve, became much steeper, from fifteen to seventeen, and near the summit was twenty-five degrees. ·

The fog lifting for a moment. gave us a view of the crater, two thousand feet broad lJy estimat··, and filled witlt snow, in the northwest portion of which was an orifice giYing vent to clouds of smoke and sulphurous fumes. The thermometer indicate(! 320, or the freezing point. The return to camp was made by compass, the fog being so thick as to obscure objects twenty feet dista::it. vVe reached the point on the beach from which we start,ed on the morning of the fo1lowing <lay, retracing with some unim1iortaut variations the route by which ·we went. The olJservations for eleYation were made with three aneroid barouwters, which, to a11 elPYation of about four thousand feet, eorrespon<led very closely; be_youd that point one ceased to indicate, though the others continued to work satisfactorily to the summit. '.rhc height of l\fakushin, as determined by these observations, is five thousand nine hu11dred and sixty-one (5,9Gl) feet. At least three extinct volcanic cones are to be seen on the peninsula northeast from l\Iakushiu volcano; one rises from t.lte water near the entrance to and on the northeast side of Captain Bay. On the morniug of our departure from Unalaska, after passing to the south through the Akutan passage, we had a most magnificent view of the snow-coYered 1-olcanic pea.ks on U ninmk Island, and the vast intermcQ,iate snow-fields, glaciers reaching down nearly to the sea. The accompanying sketch giyes but a poor illm;tration of the view, but will serve to indicate ap1>roximately the relative positions of the volcanoes, two of which are remarkable fo1' their symmetry and heiglit, Pogrom11aja aml Shishaldin. Destruction Pea.k, so called from the destruction of life caused by its eru1ition in 18G3, is uet.ween the two just mentioned.
KNOWN FOSSILIFEROUS LOCALITIES OF
ALASKA-~IINERAL

RESOURCES-VOLCANOES AND

GLACIERS.

According to Grewingk, fossils of the carboniferous age occur at Cape Beaufort, on the Arctic coast, of the jurassic period, at the bay of Katmai, on the east coast of the peninsula of Alaska. Tertiary fossils ham been collected at Sacharow and Jgatskoi Ba;n'.I, on the island of Kadiak, at Pawlowsky Bay, on the peninsula of Al~ska; also on the island of Unalaska, at the north-uorthwest foot of Makushin. Mastodon bones and teeth are found at Eschotty Bay, Kotzebue Sound, and on the Bibiilow Islands in Behring Sea. Exaggerated ideas have been formed of the known mineral wealth of Alaska. Beds of coal are known to exist at several localities: on the eastern shore of Cook's Iulet, on foe Kenuim1 Peninsula, all the way between Fort Nicholas and Tschuwatichick Bay, are two coal beds Yisibfo at iow water, which are said to be from four to five feet in thickness. I am indebted to Captain Paul Lemascheffsky, of the Hussian-American Fur Companr, for the following information: 9n the coast of the peninsula of Alaska, opposite the islaIHl of Kadiak 1 latitude 580 10', longitude 1540 17', is a bay in which Uie company's steamer Constantine, under command of Captain Luidfoos, anchored, in 1865. He found there a vein of good coal, two feet in thickness. On the island of Unga are two workable beds, one of twenty-six inches, the other of thirty inches in thickness, according to the measurements made by Mr. Shri:ide.r (an employe of the RussianAmerican Company) for the Russian gove.rnment. They are exposed in a high bluff, and are inclined at an angle of eight degrees. Coal is also known to occurin the neighborhood of Cape Beaufort, on the Arctic Ocean, and it is probably of good quality, but its position is such as to render it of no commercial importa,ncc. The coal from Cook's.Inlet and the island of Unga is of known poor quality, beiug nothing more than lignite, and is of the most recent geological age. With regard to that on the peniusula of Alaska, accounts are contradictory, but the probability is that it will be found to Jtave had a contem1>oraneous origin, and to be of the same lignitic character. The entirely different character of the pieces recently found on the island of Sitka would induce

37

290

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

the expectation of tlie ultimate discovery of coal 011 that island of au earlier geological age, similar to that found at N auaim, and on Queen Charlotte Island, further south. .Hxtensive deposits of iron ore are reported, though none as yet are known to have been found. I received from Mr. Kadiu, in Sitka, some small specimens of galena, said to have been brought by the Imlians from Whale Bay, about twenty miles south of Sitka. Gold.-It is doubtful if gold occurs on the Stachin River, within the limits of the new Territory, in sufficient quantity to pay for working. Its existence is reported on the Takoo River, nortli of the Stachin; on the Copper, and with more certainty on the Kaknoo J{,iver, the mouth of which, on Cook's Inlet, the Russian fort St. Nicholas is located. Copper.-l\fasses of metallic copper, many pom1ds in weight, l1ave been brought from Copper River, though little or nothing is known of its original locality; expeditions which have been undertaken for the exploration of that riYer having either been driYen back, or the members murdered by the Indians. As fa1· as could be ascertained, 110 silver ores, pro1ler, lmvc been yet found in the Territory; at least in such quantity as to give promise of profitable working. It is to be remarked here, that considerable dfficulty was experienced in ascertaining facts in regard to the localities of ores, minerals, &c., either on account of the extreme reticence on the part of the Russians, induced by thL Jiope of future personal gain, m by the restrictions under which they may have been placed. · A volcano on the northern part o Prince of "\Vales Island, latitude 560 10', is the commencement of a series of volcanoes extending along the coast a distance of two hundred and fifty miles, culminating in 1\' mmt St. Elias, tlie elevation of wl1ich, as given on tlle cllart, is 14,970 feet. On tlle wes'. m side of Cook'i,i Inlet is the commencement of another series, GoryiLlaya a.ml Illiaminsk Mot .·tains, respectively 11,270 feet and 12,066 feet in elevation, which stretches io the southwest, forming the peninsula of Alaska and the long chain of Aleutian Islands, extendiug far towards the peninsula of Kamtschatka. The trend of the rocks, both on the western coast of British Columbia and of the southwestern part of Alaska, as also those east of the peninsula of Alaska on the island of Kadiak, is parallel to these two great lines of upheaval Glaciers, which have played such an important part in the configuration of the northwest coast, cutting it up into such a vast labyrinth uf channels and islands, are quite munerous along the coast and inland waters north of Sitka Island ; these, perhaps, attain their grandest proportions on the flanks of Mount St. Elias, where, I am told, there is one thirty miles in width, reaching to the sea. The lowest known limit of existing glaciers on tlle coast is at the head of the narrow inlets to the east of Fort Simpson, inBritish Columbia, latitude 5401 approximately.

The limited time previous t.o your departure for the east prevents a more complete report from being made, and also renders it impossible to identify all the species coJlected. The bfrds, TI.shes, &c., are sent forward as collected; the localities in each case being correctly given and attached to the specimens. The mollnsca, being more particularly within my department of study, are, with the exception of three or four species, identified and properly labeled aooording to the present standard, and conforming to the labeling of the collection of the California Academy of Sciences ; the collection of the State Museum, made by the geological survey of this State; and the private collection of Mr. R. E. C. Stearns, of San Francisco; to the latter gentleman, to Dr. J. G. Cooper, and to Professor J. D. Whitney, State geologist, I gratefully aeknowledge attentions and facilities afforded to me in making up the list of shells. It is unnecessary to remind you that the limited nlllllbe1· of species and specimens collected~a.t

the various points at which the Lincoln stopped is due to want of opportunity and the unfavorable condition of the weather and the tides. The concl10logical collection is not without interest, as we haye detected several of the boreal forms of the north. Atlantic, and a few s1lecies identieal with the species of the northeast coast of ~orth America. I regret exceedingly that the collections are so meager. In closing, permit me to acknowledge the consideration and kindness which I have met with from yourself as chief of the Coast Snn'ey party in this expedition.

Tht- bird-foot bramble (Rubus pellatus, Smitl1) ltas fow frnit grains, too small, pulp,'\" aml red; found in o;hady womfa, ereeping on;r mosses and mtten log8. Tl11' red fruited wlwrilt·berry, ( 1-accininm parl'ifolium, Smith,) eYer~-,Y!tere found, \H' had wellnigh fo1·gottc11 to 11ofr. This i8 the mw most uninmmlly Hougbt, after, arnl i:-; the fine;;t for tmts, jellies, pies, &c. X o natiYe in th<>. season wonlcl be without tlt<·m. Red elderberrie8 (Sambucus pubens, ::\Iieh.) are boiled, besides Yarious roots, with which they flaYor their ft,.;h-sonps, or dwwaers, or tlrn;; 1·011tl'ihnte to their nutriment. Even the hips of the PHrly wild i·ose (Rosn blm11la, Ait.) are used; also the Scotch loYerage, (Ligusticum scotieuni.) The Karntsdiatkm1 lily we fom1d both nutritious aud of a pleasant, sweetish, an_ylaccom; and mucilaginous quality. This has by some authors hccu co11si<1cred R trne lily, the littfo lmlboidlct r;calc8 8HITOUJHling the main stem lwing considered as true> 8calcs, and the flower lacking nectaries, &c. Others of later authority consider it a species of checkered lily, (Frittillarin clwmt.<icltatcensis, Fi8d~) The roots look remarkably neat and white, quite ilffiting to tlrn <';n~ as well as the palat0. Thi8 plant coukl uudoubtedl_y be cultivated to alh-antage amid mossuogs and inc<'SSant rains, regardless of snows and storms. It is the "edible lily" of northern traveler!'! and historia11s. The roots of gTH8SeR, land and swamp, polygonums, &c., we must forego. The roots of thv mTow graRs (Jfenyanthes trifoliata) might he greatl~- imprm·ed in quality, when in a state of w1tnre the:-- serve so well for needful culinary purposes. l\fany of these water-plauts we saw but could not procure at Kadiak and other places. The island of Kadiak is mostly bare of trees, but not of slll"uhs, grasses, and varim18 herbs, for these clothe the mountains to thefr summits, among wllich the alder, willow, elder, J\fenzies' shrubs, rose, &c., with here and there a. 11arrow leafod po}llar. All that is wortliy the name of timber here iR the Sitka spruce, (.Abies srtehensis.) This tree resembles in form and foliage our sih-er firs. The largest we saw were three feet in diameter, ninety to one hundred feet high, and they are relatiYel,v of low growth :uHl rapid taper, apt to be knotty 1 and in open expnsnres branching to their -bases. In the governor's yard were some masts and 8-pars m:er a, lmndred foet long, 8-carcely tapering two inches in thirty or forty fi.>1~t; yet thesr, were from Kafliak f8laud, so that gooll timber of' thiR SJ>ruce may be obtained, although we had 110 opportimity of seei11g noteworth.r Rpecimens in a growing stat-0. M~my masts and spars are from Spr1Wl' rslmHl, ten to :fifteen miles distant, from which the~· are floated in rafts. Tlw mm111tai118 hem are in general more abrupt towards the sea and sloping inland; yet on tlw sea-silks we IliHl a fow foot-hills and rolling ridges on which only are distributed this forest growth, which is h;\- no means continuous, hut marked with beautiful venla11t openings like plantecl lawns. The f:\O!llbcr green of their foliage is slightly relieved by a silvery t.int, but one unvaried form, too precisely conic, with a stiff n.nd rigid horizontal spray, renders the scene somewhat monotonous, Ull3.C(~Ompanied as it iR by any other forest trees. There is at Sitka' a variety this sprue<l with finer pinule8 and pPrnlant wa.Ying hranchlets, 1vc think more hmiutiful, though less regular. This timher growth is confined to the eastern valleys and declivities, indicating that tlie currents of wind, like tl10,,e of the ocean, are chiefly from the we.stern quarter.

The lowlaml are limite1l to a fow acres iu extPnt, which are lialile to be too wet. The summer climate here, unlike Sitka and the coast below·, is, however, suffidm1tly filir for 1rnying. We saw rnaay lll0\\'11 ,-alleys where a good supply of hay from the native grasses had been secured for winter use. The cattle were fat and milk alnrndant. \Ve did not, ho\YC\Tr, relii'ih the flavor of the butter, although it looketl yellow and rcmarlmuly rich. V\rhether t1tis wa>1 mving to the mode of making, we could not determine. In tile villages we visited-two on '' C l1uya'' 01· Spnice lshmdruost of the inhabitants were far away in search of berries. To their ererlit hP it 11ot<>d, the floors were well scoured, and many rmlfl iurlications of neatness were obRerve11. It is tlu·rnfon· fair to presume that the coarse weeds arnl ·wild gTasses were accouutable for the fiavor of tl1e butter. On this island we saw many cozy and sheltered valleys 11ndcr very indifterent and partial cultivation, only here ~nd there a valley shorn by the sc;ythe, but everywhere abounding in grass or sociallte circles of Sitka spruce, alders; willows, elders, and l\Ienzie's shrub of humble proportions, and a fow small poplars. At one of these settlements the only iwrson at home wfls a ve1wrable, gra;y-Jutiretl Russian. Before hi8 hut were lmndretls of salmon hangiug on poles, drying, expo::;ed to the 1yeather; cured without a particle of salt! Our host, "\lith native hospitality and tme politeness, brought forth a kit, or large bucket, we.Unigh filled with the choicest luxury of the village, to wit, picklell mushrooms, which he assured us had been gathered only three days predons to our visit. I tested them, and pronounced them good in point of flavor ; but as I recognizetl t.lwm as tlrn Agaricus muttibaUs, which, in the uncured state, were known to he excPediugly nauseous, affecting ver.'~ disagreeahl,\- thefauces and throat--even causing sickness by simply holding them for a ft.ow moments in the palm of the hand-I dared not eat t,ltem. These are a part of the market rcsourC('S of the settlement, doubtless designed for the governor or some notable personage, at Paul'i,; Bay, as 1\lr. McPherson, our interpreter~ suggested. Unalaska Bay, on the side Yisited by your party in the mouth of September, 186i, abounds in grasses, witlt a climate better adapted for lrnying than the eoast of Oregon. Tbe cattle we saw were remarkably fat, and the beef very tender and delicate, rarely surpassed b:r a.ny well-fed '3tock. In this island we found much unmown grass. The ayailable and good arallle land wltich we 8aw lay chiefly near the coast formed by the meeting, mixing, and massing of tl1e valley-washes with the high surf-sand of the sea, which forms a fiue, rich, light, and genial soil, well snited to ganlen aud root-crop culture. The turnips here were large and of excellent qualit:y. Carrot.81 parsui1ls, and cabbage lacked careful.attention, but were good. Potatoes were in bloom, which should neYeT be allowed. They were scarcely half grown. They are cultivated in elevated beds about three or four foet across the fiattencd top. Our mode of planting by hilling or ridging we think would be preferable in a climate like this, too often (henching the earth with an excess of moisture, which requires to be readily shed, or beclouded by cold fogs, so that the crops require to makf'. the most of the quickening sun and fair weather. It occurs to us that many choice sunny hillsides here would produce good crops under the thrifty han~ of enterprise. They are already cleared and ready f'or tb.e plow. Where grain-like grasses grow and mature well, it. seems fair to infer that oats and barley would thrive, provided_ they were fall-sown like the native grasses, which are often in snclt haste to root that thf'.y even sprout in ea.r before reaehing the soil. This is abundantly verified by reference to our collection. SeYeral of these grasses had already matured and cast tl1eir seecl before we arrivetl, showing sufficient length of season. Indeed no grain will yield morn than half a, crop of poor quality, if they do not fail alt-Ogether, when spring-sown, whether north or south. .A. KELI.OGG, l\L D.,

BACHE .

.c\.lexaIHlPl' Dallas Bache was born at Philadelphia on the 19th of July, 1806, and died at His ·was a life deyoted to the service of his friehds, his country, and science; it was inspired by high aims, and always true to its inspiration. It was rooted in deep wisdom, it deyeloped into an expanded growth of beneficial influence, and it ripened a full harTest o:f rich results. Rarely has there been such a complete and continuous unity of purpose, such a freedom from waste of intellectual power, and so successful an accomplishment of Yaried but connected plans. Oeganization and administration were his natural tasks, and Jiis etlrrcation and opportuuities <leveloped his nature. Ile filled many important offices, and undertook an cxtraoTdiuary Ylll"iety of diftieult duty; but his clear perception and strong will combined them into a consist(mt whole. He was the center of many powers; the bond of union of diverse, and, except through him, contradictory energies; profound science and high philanthropy rejoiced to trust tlwfr dean·st foternsts to him; men of all politics and of every art and doctrine had faith in him, and lie jrn·tified tlrnir faith. All the influences t.o '>vbicl1 be wa8 subject conspired to build - him up into a great and good man. '-'1:ien he was graduated at "\Vest Point·, at the head of his class, great expectations were entertained of him, which were not disa1)pointed. He was conspicuous for the noble traits of character which 1)ec1tliarly dii,;tinguish the illustrious graduates of that admirable institution. Sincere and manly speech, comwientious and unflinching performance of duty, unquestioning self-sacrifice, intense and grat{'ful love of tl1e country to which they owe their education, honest recognition of other men's rig-ht;; and merits, freedom fromjealousy, fertility in adapting means to ends, and practical good sense and sound judgment, all these qualities were eminently his~ and he ~as the finest exponent of the posAibilities of a military education for civil service. It was here, and in performance of his duty m; a military engineer, that he learned the 1)rinciples a.ud practice of administering affairs and directing- men, and that methods of organization first germinated in his mind. For eight years he (}eyoted himself to }Jbysical science in his prefessorshi1i in the University of Pennsylvania. His clear teaching and his valuable investigations contributed as much to the reputation of that city :fm science as any one of the greatest uames by which Philadelphia has been adorned. As president of Girard College, he studied all the educational institutions of Europe. Circumstances which even his influence could not control deprived the college of the full benefits of hi,; accumulated stores of knowledge. But the opportunity was given him to develop his studies upon education in the High School of Philadelphia. His organization of this institution was a marvellous adaptation of the best systems of academic education known in Europe, to American wants ; and it has beeu the model upon which, consciously or unconsciously, the lead;ing high ~chools of the country have lJeen constructed. In 1843 Professor :Bache was app-0inted to be Superintendent of the Coast Survey. What it is now, he made it It is his true and lasting monument. It will never cease to be the admiration of the scientific world. His name needs not to be carved by the hand of a sculptor. It is inscribed on the entablature of the survey by bis own greatness. It is written upon the flood of the Gulf Stream ; upou the pulse of the ocean's tide; upon the oscillation of the earth's magnetism. It is written on the bases of verification, on the great triangles with which these bases were brought into ~omparison, and on the hill-tops which he occupied for his stati0n.s; it is written on every shoal and rock and danger to navigation, and every channel discovered by the survey, and on the beautiful charts in which they are used by tlie grateful sailors; and it is Written on 'all the investigations in geology, astronomy, and terrestrial physics, which have been conducted by the strongest intellect of the country combined under his control. No other name can replace his, Of stand by its side. To whatever place and at whatever time the knowledge ·Gf the Coast Survey of the United States shall penetrate., it must carry with it the name of Bache. He is gone; but be is not forgotten. ·while he lived he was the acknowledged head of the science of his country; a.nd he still lives, a glorious example and a cheering inspiration to us in the service of oar country, of science, and of mankind.

APPENDIX No. 20.
TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF A. D. BACHE, LL.D., LATE
SVPERI~TENDE~T

OF THE COAST SVRYEY.

Professor Bache died at Newport, Rhode Island, on the 17th of February, 18G'i, aftl'r a lingering illness, the origin of which was a paralytic attack in the year 18G4. The decease was thus officially announced by the honorable Secretar;">- of the Treasnl'y:
"TREASURY DEPART:\.I:E~T, FelJnwry 18, 1867. "In the death of the Superintendent of the Coast Smvey, Profrssor Bache, the department mourns the loss of one of its most -valuable and most highly cherished officerR. IliR decease occurred at Newport, Rhode Island, on the 17th instant, in his sixty-first year. "No man within the present generation was more widel:y known in the walks of practical Rei· ence ;. none has been so closely identified with collateral service in the variom; 1m1Jlie dep:irtments. "Alexander Dallas Bache was born at Philadelphia, July 19, 1806. He gradaated at the Military Academy in 1825, and there remained a year as Assistant Professo1'. Subsequently, having resigned from the Corps of Engineers, he filled, at intervals, nut.ii the year 18±3, an important chair in the University of Pennsylvania. "Within the same period he was, during five years, President of Girard College, and matured the system of education adopted for the Philadelphia High School, yiellling to t hut ol~ject time for examining the principles of systematic education in Europe. · ''His devotion to practical science and his abilities as an administratiYe officer being well known, Professor Bache was appointed in December, 1843, to the vacant 1rnst of Superintendent of the Coast Survey. Under his direction that great national work has been eminent no less for its abundant results than for its high scientific character, which has won the approbation of the leading learned bodies of the world, among whom his name has long heen held in honor. He possessed by nature the qualities most conducive to success in the management of widely-extended public interests. Invariably mild and forbearing towards those serving under his direction, his unremitting energies and his untiring patience were as invariably given to the accomplishment of the ser· vice in view. "His sympathy with the efforts of others, and readiness to give ci·edit for tlleir exert.ions, secured a cordial spirit of co-operation. Sagacity, perfect freedom from bias, and constant activity within the sphere of his public duties, strongly marked his relations with this department. "He was a member of the Light-house Board, and participat~d in its organization ; a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution; and ever the valued associate of leading men to wl!om are committed questions in regard to matt.ers of public utility. His ad-vice was eagerly sought in the determination.of many local and general facilities to further the interests of commerce and navigation.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

cbief passed beyond the bouncls of earthly existence yesterday about nine o'clock in the morning, at Newport, where, since his return from Europe, he had awaited the termination of his sufferings. Although long looked for, the end strikes upon our feelings scarcely less severe than if he had been taken away suddenly, and without warning. "We meet to gh'e expression to our deep sense of the loss we have thus sustained; to our appreciation of his admirahle character and eminent public services; and to tender our sympathies to the bereaved family. ' "In a certain degree most of us belong to his family, for such was ltis sympathy with all, that the members of the Coast Survey have stood to him rather in such·relation than as o:fficial subordinates ; and each one present doubtless feels a sense of personal loss. "Profe880r Bache had, more than most men of his day, won the close regard of his fellowworkers in the field of science; the confidence of the nation in his wisdom and integrity; and the Joye of those with whom he was personally associated. What he has done for the Cpast Survey, the great work of his life, is familiar to us all. He infused into it life and vigor, inspired the public confidence, enlarged the scope of the work, and increased its scale more than fivefold. He has made it the trust of the mariner, and the admiration of the scientific world. "In all departments in which the efforts of- Professor Bache were exercised, his peculiar powers for organization became conspicuous. .A. great part of his success in this respect was dne to discriminative sagacity; to the ready ear which he gave to the suggestions of others, and his sense of justice in according credit for such as were adopted. "'Of my own felings I cannot trust myself to speak. Like yourselves, I have lost in him a friend and guide-a second father. Under the shadow of bis gi'flat name I have loved to live, and 11ave prospered. The future seems bereft of its best hope-that of' enjoying his approbation." Assistant Cutts spoke as follows: "It is not my intention, nor is it the occasion, to refer to the eminent services of our late Superintendent, or to the distinguished consideration accorded· to them both at home and allroad. The eareer <>f Professor Bache is interwoven with the history of Amei:ican progress during the last thirty years. .A.s a man ever foremost in the advancement. of' science; of rare learning, sound judgment, and of intense labor; as a gentleman of varied acoomplishments, and of stern integ;rity of Charad.er, devoting all alike, and at all times, to the interests and honor of the government, the entire country will mourn his loss. "To us, the assistants in the Coast Survey, the occasion is one suggestive of deeper feeling than an estimate or even admiration of his labors, or of the valuable and wide-spread results that rewm·ded them. He was not only our chief with whom we were connected by official -ties, but a personal friend, bound to us by intimate and even pleasant association for many years. Kind and considerat;e in every act and word, he attracted us, as it were, to the e-arnest performance of duty, as well by a desire to secure his approval as from a strict sense of official responsibility. We have .known him in the field and in the office, a partaker in our laoors, and the most incessant worker of all. We have consulted with him in regard to details of the survey, and always with the feeling that we were co-operating with a friend who, while ready to adopt any suggested expedient that might facilitate progress or increase efficiency, never failed to give credit where credit was due. "There is perhaps no one now present who cannot and who does not on this sad occasion recall to mind some incident connected with Professor Bache, full of pleasant memories, either illustra-tive of his genial disposition, or of his thoughtful kindness, or of some other of the many eminent qualities for which he was justly distinguished, and by which he had se.cnred our respect, our regard, and our personal attachment. It is with such feelings that we meet to-day to commune in regard to his memory, and to express our sympathy with the afflicted family and relatives. I feel assured that, although most of our associates are absent, some on duty on the .A.tla.ntie and Gulf coasts, and others on the distant shores of the Pacific, every word that bas been uttered to-day, of regard and respect for the memory of Professor Biwhe, will find an echo in their hearts and sentiments. "1 now move that a committee of three, of the assistants now present, be appointed to draft resolutions expressive of the sense of this meeting." The chairman named Assistant C. O. Boutelle, Captain C. P. Patterson, and Assistant Henry Mitehell, as tbe committee on resolutions.

In accordance with the direction of t1ie honorable Secretary of the Treasury, the Coast Sur.,..ey Office had been draped in black. During the absence of the committPe, Assistant HilgaTd announce<l the ge.neral order of proceedings for the funeral. On the return of the committee, the following· preamble and resolutions were read hy Assistant Boutelle and unanimously adopted, after which the meeting adjourned. "Whereas, in t.11e proYidence of God, our beloyed Superintendent and chief has be<>n remoYed from us by death: We, the officers and employcs of the United Stall"s Coast Suryey, now in V\~ af:.hton, desire, 011 behalf of oursclycs and our absent as;:;ociates, to expres,.; our sorro'\\: at the great and irreparable loss we have sustained by his death; to unite in a tribute of affectionate' n'spPl't to hiH memory; to give expression to our sense of his higl1 qualitieR, tlw grf'at sen-ices he has Tendered to his country and to science; and to offer our respectful sympathies and condolence to his sorrowing family. "'\Vhateyer of excellence there may be in the extcnd<'d system of operationi:; now carried on by the Coast Survey on every portion of our coast js due to Professor Bache. He came to the chargt~ of the work at a time when its operations were conducted upon a small Realn and restricted to a limited portion of the coast. In a wouderfull,Y Rhort 8pace of time he succeeded in winning the confide11ce of his official superior, and in securing the consent of Congress to a gradual enlargement of the work to its present scale. He called to his assistance men of thought aml men of action from civil life, and from the army and uayy, and, with a rnre felicity, discerning a11d ap111,ying the special aptitudes of each indivi(lual, he wrought out from discord:mt material a harmonious whole. "He combined high adminii;.trative ability with ·igor and energy in execution. \Yhile allowing and inYiting free CTiticism of Jiis plans rluri11g their inception, he exacted a rigorous accouutabilit:y from foe officers intnrnted with their execution. Discipline under his auministration was none the less real that it was not apparent. "Professor Bache was eminently just. 'l'hc Coast SurYC~y reports-those monuments of his fame-are full o.f evidence of the scrupulous care witll which every officer serving Ullder him received inoper credit for his labors. His quick and readj~ appreciation of merit in en~r;r dep.trtment of scientific inquiry and action, whether theoretic or pra.ctical, has been felt through the entire country, and has been of lasting benefit. To his fostering care aml aid we owe the present perfection of the telegraphic method of obtaining longitude, which has recently achieved its cTowning triumph in the determination by the Coast Survey of the precise difference of longitude bctweeu any two points in Europe and .America, through the .Atlantic cable. "Of those great intellectual qualities, aided by the highest culture, which made Professor Bache the foremost scientific man of .America, this is not the time or place to speak. Other and more eloquent tongues aud pens wm rncord his eulogy, but none with greater love and veneration. ''.At the breaking out of the great rebellion new duties and responsibilities were <leYolYed upon him, and he met them all. In the midst of these onerous duties he found time to be an earnest worker in the organization of the Sanitary Commission. As the war grew in proportiou, so did - the demand upon bis energies. In the construction of defenses around his native city of Philadelphia, when menaced by invasion in 1863, his powers of endurance were straineu beyond bearing, and in the succeeding year he was seized with the malady which has now terminated in his death. He has given his life to his country, iu its great struggle for national existence, as truly as did any of those heroes who laid down their lives upon the field of battle. "While we honor and respect the memory of our chief for his great abilities and untiring industry, for his wisdom and forethought, his scientific skill and administrative power, we also feel that he was more to us than is implied in all these high qualities. 'Ve feel that we ham each lost a personal friend whom we dearly loved, and to whom, aside from all official relations, eaeh felt a personal tie of warm affection. 'Ve remember him as the genial, cordial companion in social intercourse, as the wise and friendly counsellor in difficulty, as the kind and sympathizing consoler in sorrow and distress, ever ready to do~ kind act, to seek out and to bring forward modest merit and true worth, and never wearying in well-doing. "Such has been w us the man whose death we this day deplore, and as a tribute to the memory Gf our respect,ed and honored chief, and our beloved and valuerl. friend, be it, therefore,
